CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 1994

ARIZONA v. EVANS
certiorari to the supreme court of arizona
No. 93-1660. Argued December 7, 1994--Decided March 1, 1995
Respondent was arrested by Phoenix police during a routine traffic stop

when a patrol car's computer indicated that there was an outstanding
misdemeanor warrant for his arrest. A subsequent search of his car
revealed a bag of marijuana, and he was charged with possession. Respondent moved to suppress the marijuana as the fruit of an unlawful
arrest, since the misdemeanor warrant had been quashed before his arrest. The trial court granted the motion, but the Court of Appeals
reversed on the ground that the exclusionary rule's purpose would not
be served by excluding evidence obtained because of an error by employees not directly associated with the arresting officers or their police
department. In reversing, the Arizona Supreme Court rejected the
distinction between clerical errors committed by law enforcement personnel and similar mistakes by court employees and predicted that the
exclusionary rule's application would serve to improve the efficiency of
criminal justice system recordkeepers.

Held:

1. This Court has jurisdiction to review the State Supreme Court's
decision. Under Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, when a state-court
decision fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with federal law, and when the adequacy and independence of
any possible state-law ground is not clear from the opinion's face, this
Court will accept as the most reasonable explanation that the state
court decided the case the way it did because it believed that federal
law required it to do so. This standard for determining whether a

2 ARIZONA v. EVANS

Syllabus
state-court decision rests upon an adequate and independent state
ground was adopted (1) to obviate the unsatisfactory and intrusive practice of requiring state courts to clarify their decisions to this Court's
satisfaction and (2) to provide state judges with a clearer opportunity
to develop state jurisprudence unimpeded by federal interference and
yet preserve the federal law's integrity. Michigan properly serves its
purpose and should not be disturbed. State courts are free both to
interpret state constitutional provisions to accord greater protection to
individual rights than do similar provisions of the United States Constitution and to serve as experimental laboratories. However, in cases
where they interpret the United States Constitution, they are not free
from the final authority of this Court. In this case, the State Supreme
Court based its decision squarely upon its interpretation of federal law
when it discussed the appropriateness of applying the exclusionary rule,
and it offered no plain statement that its references to federal law were
being used only for the purpose of guidance and did not compel the
result reached. Pp. 6-10.

2. The exclusionary rule does not require suppression of evidence
seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment where the erroneous information resulted from clerical errors of court employees. The exclusionary rule is a judicially created remedy designed to safeguard against
future violations of Fourth Amendment rights through its deterrent
effect. However, the issue of exclusion is separate from whether the
Amendment has been violated. The Amendment does not expressly
preclude the use of evidence obtained in violation of its commands, and
exclusion is appropriate only where the rule's remedial objectives are
thought most efficaciously served. The same framework that this
Court used in United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, to determine that
there was no sound reason to apply the exclusionary rule as a means of
deterring misconduct on the part of judicial officers responsible for issuing search warrants applies in this case. The exclusionary rule was
historically designed as a means of deterring police misconduct, not mistakes by court employees. See id., at 916. In addition, respondent
offers no evidence that court employees are inclined to ignore or subvert
the Fourth Amendment or that lawlessness among these actors requires
application of the extreme sanction of exclusion. See ibid. In fact, the
Justice Court Clerk testified that this type of error occurred only once
every three or four years. Finally, there is no basis for believing that
application of the exclusionary rule will have a significant effect on court
employees responsible for informing the police that a warrant has been
quashed. Since they are not adjuncts to the law enforcement team engaged in ferreting out crime, they have no stake in the outcome of particular prosecutions. Application of the exclusionary rule also could not

be expected to alter an arresting officer's behavior, since there is no

4 ARIZONA v. EVANS

Opinion of the Court
acted in reliance on a police record indicating the existenceof an outstanding arrest warrant--a record that is later determined to be erroneous--must be suppressed by virtue ofthe exclusionary rule regardless of the source of the error.
The Supreme Court of Arizona held that the exclusionary
rule required suppression of evidence even if the erroneousinformation resulted from an error committed by an employee of the office of the Clerk of Court. We disagree.In January 1991, Phoenix police officer Bryan Sargent observed respondent Isaac Evans driving the wrong way on aone-way street in front of the police station. The officer
stopped respondent and asked to see his driver's license.
After respondent told him that his license had been suspended, the officer entered respondent's name into a computer data terminal located in his patrol car. The computer
inquiry confirmed that respondent's license had been suspended and also indicated that there was an outstanding misdemeanor warrant for his arrest. Based upon the outstanding warrant, Officer Sargent placed respondent under arrest.
While being handcuffed, respondent dropped a hand-rolled
cigarette that the officers determined smelled of marijuana.
Officers proceeded to search his car and discovered a bag of
marijuana under the passenger's seat.

The State charged respondent with possession of marijuana. When the police notified the Justice Court that they
had arrested him, the Justice Court discovered that the arrest warrant previously had been quashed and so advised
the police. Respondent argued that because his arrest was
based on a warrant that had been quashed 17 days prior to
his arrest, the marijuana seized incident to the arrest should
be suppressed as the fruit of an unlawful arrest. Respondent also argued that "[t]he `good faith' exception to the exclusionary rule [was] inapplicable . . . because it was police error,
not judicial error, which caused the invalid arrest." App. 5.

At the suppression hearing, the Chief Clerk of the Justice
Court testified that a Justice of the Peace had issued the

5Cite as: 514 U. S. 1 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
arrest warrant on December 13, 1990, because respondent
had failed to appear to answer for several traffic violations.
On December 19, 1990, respondent appeared before a pro tem
Justice of the Peace who entered a notation in respondent's
file to "quash warrant." Id., at 13.

The Chief Clerk also testified regarding the standard court
procedure for quashing a warrant. Under that procedure a
justice court clerk calls and informs the warrant section of
the Sheriff 's Office when a warrant has been quashed. The
Sheriff 's Office then removes the warrant from its computer
records. After calling the Sheriff 's Office, the clerk makes
a note in the individual's file indicating the clerk who made
the phone call and the person at the Sheriff 's Office to whom
the clerk spoke. The Chief Clerk testified that there was no
indication in respondent's file that a clerk had called and notified the Sheriff 's Office that his arrest warrant had been
quashed. A records clerk from the Sheriff 's Office also testified that the Sheriff 's Office had no record of a telephone
call informing it that respondent's arrest warrant had been
quashed. Id., at 42-43.

At the close of testimony, respondent argued that the evidence obtained as a result of the arrest should be suppressed
because "the purposes of the exclusionary rule would be
served here by making the clerks for the court, or the clerk
for the Sheriff 's office, whoever is responsible for this mistake, to be more careful about making sure that warrants
are removed from the records." Id., at 47. The trial court
granted the motion to suppress because it concluded that the
State had been at fault for failing to quash the warrant.
Presumably because it could find no "distinction between
State action, whether it happens to be the police department
or not," id., at 52, the trial court made no factual finding as
to whether the Justice Court or Sheriff 's Office was responsible for the continued presence of the quashed warrant in the
police records.

6 ARIZONA v. EVANS

Opinion of the Court
A divided panel of the Arizona Court of Appeals reversedbecause it "believe[d] that the exclusionary rule [was] not

intended to deter justice court employees or Sheriff 's Officeemployees who are not directly associated with the arresting
officers or the arresting officers' police department." 172Ariz. 314, 317, 836 P. 2d 1024, 1027 (1992). Therefore, it
concluded, "the purpose of the exclusionary rule would notbe served by excluding the evidence obtained in this case."
Ibid.The Arizona Supreme Court reversed. 177 Ariz. 201, 866
P. 2d 869 (1994). The court rejected the "distinction drawnby the court of appeals . . . between clerical errors committed
by law enforcement personnel and similar mistakes by courtemployees." Id., at 203, 866 P. 2d, at 871. The court predicted that application of the exclusionary rule would "hope-fully serve to improve the efficiency of those who keep records in our criminal justice system." Id., at 204, 866 P. 2d,at 872. Finally, the court concluded that "[e]ven assuming
that deterrence is the principal reason for application of theexclusionary rule, we disagree with the court of appeals that
such a purpose would not be served where carelessness by acourt clerk results in an unlawful arrest."

Ibid.We granted certiorari to determine whether the exclusionary rule requires suppression of evidence seized incident toan arrest resulting from an inaccurate computer record, regardless of whether police personnel or court personnel wereresponsible for the record's continued presence in the police
computer. 511 U. S. 1126 (1994).1 We now reverse.We first must consider whether we have jurisdiction to
review the Arizona Supreme Court's decision. Respondentargues that we lack jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. $ 1257 because the Arizona Supreme Court never passed upon the

Fourth Amendment issue and instead based its decision onthe Arizona good-faith statute, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 13-

3925 (1993), an adequate and independent state ground. Inthe alternative, respondent asks that we remand to the Arizona Supreme Court for clarification.In

Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032 (1983), we adopted astandard for determining whether a state-court decision

rested upon an adequate and independent state ground.When "a state court decision fairly appears to rest primarily
on federal law, or to be interwoven with the federal law, andwhen the adequacy and independence of any possible state
law ground is not clear from the face of the opinion, we willaccept as the most reasonable explanation that the state
court decided the case the way it did because it believed thatfederal law required it to do so."

Id., at 1040-1041. Weadopted this practice, in part, to obviate the "unsatisfactory

and intrusive practice of requiring state courts to clarifytheir decisions to the satisfaction of this Court." Id., at
1041. We also concluded that this approach would "providestate judges with a clearer opportunity to develop state
jurisprudence unimpeded by federal interference, and yetwill preserve the integrity of federal law."

Ibid.
Justice Ginsburg would overrule Michigan v. Long,
supra, because she believes that the rule of that case "im-pedes the States' ability to serve as laboratories for testing

solutions to novel legal problems." Post, at 24.2 The opin2 Justice Ginsburg certainly is correct when she notes that " `[s]ince
Long, we repeatedly have followed [its] "plain statement" requirement.' "

8 ARIZONA v. EVANS

Opinion of the Court
ion in Long describes the 60-year history of the Court's differing approaches to the determination whether the judgment of the highest court of a State rested on federal or
nonfederal grounds. 463 U. S., at 1038-1040. When we
were in doubt, on some occasions we dismissed the writ of
certiorari; on other occasions we vacated the judgment of
the state court and remanded so that it might clarify the
basis for its decision. See ibid. The latter approach did not
always achieve the desired result and burdened the state
courts with additional work. Ibid.

We believe that Michigan v. Long properly serves its purpose and should not be disturbed. Under it, state courts are
absolutely free to interpret state constitutional provisions to
accord greater protection to individual rights than do similar
provisions of the United States Constitution. They also are
free to serve as experimental laboratories, in the sense that
Justice Brandeis used that term in his dissenting opinion in
New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 311 (1932) (urging that the Court not impose federal constitutional restraints on the efforts of a State to "serve as a laboratory").
Under our decision today, the State of Arizona remains free
to seek whatever solutions it chooses to problems of law enforcement posed by the advent of computerization.3 Indeed,
it is freer to do so because it is disabused of its erroneous
view of what the United States Constitution requires.

State courts, in appropriate cases, are not merely free to--
they are bound to--interpret the United States Constitution.
In doing so, they are not free from the final authority of this

v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 740 (1991) (opinion of O'Connor, J.) (declining
to expand the Long and Harris presumption to instances "where the relevant state court decision does not fairly appear to rest primarily on federal
law or to be interwoven with such law").

3 Justice Ginsburg acknowledges as much when she states that since

Long, "state courts, on remand, have reinstated their prior judgments
after clarifying their reliance on state grounds." Post, at 32 (citing
statistics).

Opinion of the Court
Court. This principle was enunciated in Cohens v. Virginia,6 Wheat. 264 (1821), and presumably

Justice Ginsburgdoes not quarrel with it.
4 In Minnesota v. National Tea Co.,

309 U. S. 551 (1940), we recognized that our authority as finalarbiter of the United States Constitution could be eroded by

a lack of clarity in state-court decisions.

"It is fundamental that state courts be left free and un-fettered by us in interpreting their state constitutions.

But it is equally important that ambiguous or obscureadjudications by state courts do not stand as barriers to
a determination by this Court of the validity under thefederal constitution of state action. Intelligent exercise
of our appellate powers compels us to ask for the elimi-nation of the obscurities and ambiguities from the opinions in such cases. . . . For no other course assures thatimportant federal issues, such as have been argued here,
will reach this Court for adjudication; that state courtswill not be the final arbiters of important issues under
the federal constitution; and that we will not encroachon the constitutional jurisdiction of the states." Id.,
at 557.
We therefore adhere to the standard adopted in Michigan v.
Long, supra.Applying that standard here, we conclude that we have

jurisdiction. In reversing the Court of Appeals, the ArizonaSupreme Court stated that "[w]hile it may be inappropriate
to invoke the exclusionary rule where a magistrate has is-sued a facially valid warrant (a discretionary judicial function) based on an erroneous evaluation of the facts, the law,or both,

Leon, 468 U. S. 897 . . . (1984), it is useful and proper

4 Surely if we have jurisdiction to vacate and remand a state-court judgment for clarification, post, at 34, n. 7, we also must have jurisdiction to
determine whether a state-court judgment is based upon an adequate and
independent state ground. See Abie State Bank v. Bryan, 282 U. S. 765,
773 (1931).

Opinion of the Court
to do so where negligent record keeping (a purely clericalfunction) results in an unlawful arrest." 177 Ariz., at 204,

866 P. 2d, at 872. Thus, the Arizona Supreme Court's deci-sion to suppress the evidence was based squarely upon its
interpretation of federal law. See ibid. Nor did it offer a
plain statement that its references to federal law were"being used only for the purpose of guidance, and d[id] not

themselves compel the result that [it] reached." Long,
supra, at 1041.

The Fourth Amendment states that "[t]he right of the peo-ple to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,

against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,
supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to
be seized." We have recognized, however, that the Fourth
Amendment contains no provision expressly precluding the
use of evidence obtained in violation of its commands. See
United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 906 (1984). "The wrong
condemned by the [Fourth] Amendment is `fully accomplished' by the unlawful search or seizure itself," ibid. (quoting United States v. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338, 354 (1974)), and
the use of the fruits of a past unlawful search or seizure
" `work[s] no new Fourth Amendment wrong,' " Leon, supra,
at 906 (quoting Calandra, supra, at 354).

"The question whether the exclusionary rule's remedy is
appropriate in a particular context has long been regarded
as an issue separate from the question whether the Fourth
Amendment rights of the party seeking to invoke the rule
were violated by police conduct." Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S.
213, 223 (1983); see also United States v. Havens, 446 U. S.
620, 627-628 (1980); Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 486-487
(1976); Calandra, supra, at 348. The exclusionary rule operates as a judicially created remedy designed to safeguard
against future violations of Fourth Amendment rights
through the rule's general deterrent effect. Leon, supra, at

906; Calandra, supra, at 348. As with any remedial device,the rule's application has been restricted to those instances

where its remedial objectives are thought most efficaciouslyserved. Leon, supra, at 908; Calandra, supra, at 348.
Where "the exclusionary rule does not result in appreciabledeterrence, then, clearly, its use . . . is unwarranted."
United States v. Janis, 428 U. S. 433, 454 (1976).In

Leon, we applied these principles to the context of apolice search in which the officers had acted in objectively

reasonable reliance on a search warrant, issued by a neutraland detached Magistrate, that later was determined to be
invalid. 468 U. S., at 905. On the basis of three factors,we determined that there was no sound reason to apply the
exclusionary rule as a means of deterring misconduct on thepart of judicial officers who are responsible for issuing warrants. See Illinois v. Krull, 480 U. S. 340, 348 (1987) (ana-lyzing

Leon, supra). First, we noted that the exclusionaryrule was historically designed " `to deter police misconduct

rather than to punish the errors of judges and magistrates.' "
Krull, supra, at 348 (quoting Leon, supra, at 916). Second,there was " `no evidence suggesting that judges and magistrates are inclined to ignore or subvert the Fourth Amend-ment or that lawlessness among these actors requires the
application of the extreme sanction of exclusion.' " Krull,supra, at 348 (quoting Leon, supra, at 916). Third, and of
greatest importance, there was no basis for believing thatexclusion of evidence seized pursuant to a warrant would
have a significant deterrent effect on the issuing judge ormagistrate.

Krull, supra, at 348.The Leon Court then examined whether application of the

exclusionary rule could be expected to alter the behavior ofthe law enforcement officers. We concluded:

"[W]here the officer's conduct is objectively reasonable,`excluding the evidence will not further the ends of the
exclusionary rule in any appreciable way; for it is pain-fully apparent that . . . the officer is acting as a reason514us1$30H 06-11-98 18:12:59 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
able officer would and should act in similar circum-stances. Excluding the evidence can in no way affect

his future conduct unless it is to make him less willing todo his duty.' " Leon, supra, at 919-920 (quoting Stone,

supra, at 539-540 (White, J., dissenting)).
See also Massachusetts v. Sheppard, 468 U. S. 981, 990-991(1984) ("[S]uppressing evidence because the judge failed to

make all the necessary clerical corrections despite his assur-ances that such changes would be made will not serve the
deterrent function that the exclusionary rule was designedto achieve"). Thus, we held that the "marginal or nonexistent benefits produced by suppressing evidence obtained inobjectively reasonable reliance on a subsequently invalidated
search warrant cannot justify the substantial costs of exclu-sion." Leon, supra, at 922.

Respondent relies on United States v. Hensley, 469 U. S.221 (1985), and argues that the evidence seized incident to
his arrest should be suppressed because he was the victimof a Fourth Amendment violation. Brief for Respondent
10-12, 21-22. In Hensley, the Court determined that evi-dence uncovered as a result of a stop pursuant to

Terry v.Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968), was admissible because the officers

who made the stop acted in objectively reasonable relianceon a flyer that had been issued by officers of another police
department who possessed a reasonable suspicion to justifya

Terry stop. 469 U. S., at 231. Because the Hensley Courtdetermined that there had been no Fourth Amendment violation, id., at 236, the Court never considered whether theseized evidence should have been excluded. Hensley does
not contradict our earlier pronouncements that "[t]he ques-tion whether the exclusionary rule's remedy is appropriate
in a particular context has long been regarded as an issueseparate from the question whether the Fourth Amendment
rights of the party seeking to invoke the rule were violatedby police conduct."

Opinion of the Court
Respondent also argues that Whiteley v. Warden, Wyo.
State Penitentiary, 401 U. S. 560 (1971), compels exclusion of
the evidence. In Whiteley, the Court determined that the
Fourth Amendment had been violated when police officers
arrested Whiteley and recovered inculpatory evidence based
upon a radio report that two suspects had been involved in
two robberies. Id., at 568-569. Although the "police were
entitled to act on the strength of the radio bulletin," the
Court determined that there had been a Fourth Amendment
violation because the initial complaint, upon which the arrest
warrant and subsequent radio bulletin were based, was insufficient to support an independent judicial assessment of
probable cause. Id., at 568. The Court concluded that "an
otherwise illegal arrest cannot be insulated from challenge
by the decision of the instigating officer to rely on fellow
officers to make the arrest." Ibid. Because the "arrest
violated [Whiteley's] constitutional rights under the Fourth
and Fourteenth Amendments; the evidence secured as an incident thereto should have been excluded from his trial.
Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961)." Id., at 568-569.

Although Whiteley clearly retains relevance in determining whether police officers have violated the Fourth Amendment, see Hensley, supra, at 230-231, its precedential value
regarding application of the exclusionary rule is dubious. In
Whiteley, the Court treated identification of a Fourth
Amendment violation as synonymous with application of the
exclusionary rule to evidence secured incident to that violation. 401 U. S., at 568-569. Subsequent case law has
rejected this reflexive application of the exclusionary rule.
Cf. Illinois v. Krull, 480 U. S. 340 (1987); Sheppard, supra;
United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897 (1984); United States
v. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338 (1974). These later cases have
emphasized that the issue of exclusion is separate from
whether the Fourth Amendment has been violated, see, e. g.,
Leon, supra, at 906, and exclusion is appropriate only if the

Opinion of the Court
remedial objectives of the rule are thought most efficaciouslyserved, see

Calandra, supra, at 348.
Our approach is consistent with the dissenting Justices'position in

Krull, our only major case since Leon and Sheppard involving the good-faith exception to the exclusionary
rule. In that case, the Court found that the good-faithexception applies when an officer conducts a search in objectively reasonable reliance on the constitutionality of a stat-ute that subsequently is declared unconstitutional.

Krull,
supra, at 346. Even the dissenting Justices in Krull agreedthat

Leon provided the proper framework for analyzing
whether the exclusionary rule applied; they simply thought
that "application of Leon's stated rationales le[d] to a contrary result." 480 U. S., at 362 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).
In sum, respondent does not persuade us to abandon the
Leon framework.

Applying the reasoning of Leon to the facts of this case,
we conclude that the decision of the Arizona Supreme Court
must be reversed. The Arizona Supreme Court determined
that it could not "support the distinction drawn . . . between
clerical errors committed by law enforcement personnel and
similar mistakes by court employees," 177 Ariz., at 203, 866
P. 2d, at 871, and that "even assuming . . . that responsibility
for the error rested with the justice court, it does not follow
that the exclusionary rule should be inapplicable to these
facts," ibid.

This holding is contrary to the reasoning of Leon, supra;
Massachuset ts v. Sheppard, supra; and, Kr ull, supra.
If court employees were responsible for the erroneous
computer record, the exclusion of evidence at trial would
not sufficiently deter future errors so as to warrant such a
severe sanction. First, as we noted in Leon, the exclusionary rule was historically designed as a means of deterring
police misconduct, not mistakes by court employees. See
Leon, supra, at 916; see also Krull, supra, at 350. Second,
respondent offers no evidence that court employees are in514us1$30H 06-11-98 18:12:59 PAGES OPINPGT

15Cite as: 514 U. S. 1 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
clined to ignore or subvert the Fourth Amendment or thatlawlessness among these actors requires application of the

extreme sanction of exclusion. See Leon, supra, at 916, andn. 14; see also

Krull, supra, at 350-351. To the contrary, the
Chief Clerk of the Justice Court testified at the suppression
hearing that this type of error occurred once every three orfour years. App. 37.

Finally, and most important, there is no basis for believingthat application of the exclusionary rule in these circumstances will have a significant effect on court employees re-sponsible for informing the police that a warrant has been
quashed. Because court clerks are not adjuncts to the law
enforcement team engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime, see Johnson v. United States,
333 U. S. 10, 14 (1948), they have no stake in the outcome of
particular criminal prosecutions. Cf. Leon, supra, at 917;
Krull, supra, at 352. The threat of exclusion of evidence
could not be expected to deter such individuals from failing
to inform police officials that a warrant had been quashed.
Cf. Leon, supra, at 917; Krull, supra, at 352.

If it were indeed a court clerk who was responsible for the
erroneous entry on the police computer, application of the
exclusionary rule also could not be expected to alter the behavior of the arresting officer. As the trial court in this case
stated: "I think the police officer [was] bound to arrest. I
think he would [have been] derelict in his duty if he failed to
arrest." App. 51. Cf. Leon, supra, at 920 (" `Excluding the
evidence can in no way affect [the officer's] future conduct
unless it is to make him less willing to do his duty.' " quoting
Stone, 428 U. S., at 540 (White, J., dissenting)). The Chief
Clerk of the Justice Court testified that this type of error
occurred "on[c]e every three or four years." App. 37. In
fact, once the court clerks discovered the error, they immediately corrected it, id., at 30, and then proceeded to search
their files to make sure that no similar mistakes had occurred, id., at 37. There is no indication that the arresting

O'Connor, J., concurring
officer was not acting objectively reasonably when he reliedupon the police computer record. Application of the Leon

framework supports a categorical exception to the exclusion-ary rule for clerical errors of court employees. See Leon,
supra, at 916-922; Sheppard, supra, at 990-991.5The judgment of the Supreme Court of Arizona is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded to that court forproceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Souter and
Justice Breyer join, concurring.

The evidence in this case strongly suggests that it was acourt employee's departure from established recordkeeping

procedures that caused the record of respondent's arrestwarrant to remain in the computer system after the warrant
had been quashed. Prudently, then, the Court limits itselfto the question whether a court employee's departure from
such established procedures is the kind of error to which theexclusionary rule should apply. The Court holds that it is
not such an error, and I agree with that conclusion and jointhe Court's opinion. The Court's holding reaffirms that the
exclusionary rule imposes significant costs on society's lawenforcement interests and thus should apply only where its
deterrence purposes are "most efficaciously served," ante,at 11.

In limiting itself to that single question, however, theCourt does not hold that the court employee's mistake in this
case was necessarily the only error that may have occurredand to which the exclusionary rule might apply. While the

5 The Solicitor General, as amicus curiae, argues that an analysis similar
to that we apply here to court personnel also would apply in order to
determine whether the evidence should be suppressed if police personnel
were responsible for the error. As the State has not made any such argument here, we agree that "[t]he record in this case . . . does not adequately
present that issue for the Court's consideration." Brief for United States
as Amicus Curiae 13. Accordingly, we decline to address that question.

police were innocent of the court employee's mistake, theymay or may not have acted reasonably in their reliance

on
the recordkeeping system itself. Surely it would not be rea-sonable for the police to rely, say, on a recordkeeping system,

their own or some other agency's, that has no mechanism to
ensure its accuracy over time and that routinely leads tofalse arrests, even years after the probable cause for any

such arrest has ceased to exist (if it ever existed).This is saying nothing new. We have said the same with
respect to other information sources police use, informantsbeing an obvious example. In

Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213
(1983), the Court indicated that where an informant providesinformation about certain criminal activities but does not

specify the basis for his knowledge, a finding of probable
cause based on that information will not be upheld unless theinformant is "known for [his] unusual reliability."

Id., at
233, citing United States v. Sellers, 483 F. 2d 37, 40, n. 1(CA5 1973) (involving informant who had provided accurate

information "in more than one hundred instances in mattersof investigation"); see generally 1 W. LaFave, Search and
Seizure $ 3.3(b) (2d ed. 1987 and Supp. 1995). Certainly thereliability of recordkeeping systems deserves no

less scrutiny than that of informants. Of course, the comparison to
informants may be instructive the opposite way as well. So
long as an informant's reliability does pass constitutional
muster, a finding of probable cause may not be defeated by
an after-the-fact showing that the information the informant
provided was mistaken. See 2 id., $ 3.5(d), at 21, n. 73 (citation omitted); see also 1 id., $ 3.2(d), at 575 ("It is axiomatic
that hindsight may not be employed in determining whether
a prior arrest or search was made upon probable cause").

In recent years, we have witnessed the advent of powerful,
computer-based recordkeeping systems that facilitate arrests in ways that have never before been possible. The
police, of course, are entitled to enjoy the substantial advantages this technology confers. They may not, however, rely
on it blindly. With the benefits of more efficient law enforce514us1$30J 06-11-98 18:12:59 PAGES OPINPGT

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Breyer joins,concurring.
In joining the Court's opinion, I share Justice O'Connor's understanding of the narrow scope of what we hold
today. To her concurrence, which I join as well, I add onlythat we do not answer another question that may reach us

in due course, that is, how far, in dealing with fruits of com-puterized error, our very concept of deterrence by exclusion
of evidence should extend to the government as a whole, notmerely the police, on the ground that there would otherwise
be no reasonable expectation of keeping the number of re-sulting false arrests within an acceptable minimum limit.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
Justice Ginsburg has written an important opinion explaining why the Court unwisely departed from settled lawwhen it interpreted its own jurisdiction so expansively in

Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032 (1983). I join her dissentand her conclusion that the writ of certiorari should be dismissed. Because the Court has addressed the merits, how-ever, I add this comment on its holding.

The Court seems to assume that the Fourth Amendment--
and particularly the exclusionary rule, which effectuates theAmendment's commands--has the limited purpose of deterring police misconduct. Both the constitutional text and thehistory of its adoption and interpretation identify a more majestic conception. The Amendment protects the fundamen-tal "right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,
papers, and effects," against all official searches and seizures
that are unreasonable. The Amendment is a constraint on
the power of the sovereign, not merely on some of its agents.
See Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438, 472-479 (1928)
(Brandeis, J., dissenting). The remedy for its violation imposes costs on that sovereign, motivating it to train all of

its personnel to avoid future violations. See Stewart, TheRoad to Mapp v. Ohio and Beyond: The Origins, Development and Future of the Exclusionary Rule in Search-and-Seizure Cases, 83 Colum. L. Rev. 1365, 1400 (1983).

The exclusionary rule is not fairly characterized as an "ex-treme sanction,"

ante, at 11 (internal quotation marks omit-ted). As Justice Stewart cogently explained, the implementation of this constitutionally mandated sanction merelyplaces the government in the same position as if it had not
conducted the illegal search and seizure in the first place.1Given the undisputed fact in this case that the Constitution
prohibited the warrantless arrest of respondent, there isnothing "extreme" about the Arizona Supreme Court's conclusion that the State should not be permitted to profit fromits negligent misconduct.

Even if one accepts deterrence as the sole rationale for theexclusionary rule, the Arizona Supreme Court's decision is
correct on the merits. The majority's reliance on United
States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897 (1984), is misplaced. The searchin that case had been authorized by a presumptively valid

warrant issued by a California Superior Court Judge. In

1 See Stewart, The Road to Mapp v. Ohio and Beyond: The Origins,
Development and Future of the Exclusionary Rule in Search-and-Seizure
Cases, 83 Colum. L. Rev. 1365, 1392 (1983). I am fully aware of the
Court's statements that the question whether the exclusionary rule should
be applied is distinct from the question whether the Fourth Amendment
has been violated. Indeed, the majority twice quotes the same statement
from the Court's opinion in Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 223 (1983).
See ante, at 10, 12. I would note that such eminent Members of this
Court as Justices Holmes, Brandeis, Harlan, and Stewart have expressed
the opposite view. See, e. g., Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438, 470
(1928) (Holmes, J., dissenting); id., at 477-479 (Brandeis, J., dissenting);
Whiteley v. Warden, Wyo. State Penitentiary, 401 U. S. 560 (1971) (Harlan,
J.); Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206 (1960) (Stewart, J.); Stewart,

supra, at 1383-1385. The majority today candidly acknowledges that
Justice Harlan's opinion for the Court in Whiteley "treated identification
of a Fourth Amendment violation as synonymous with application of the
exclusionary rule to evidence secured incident to that violation." Ante,

Stevens, J., dissenting
contrast, this case involves a search pursuant to an arrest
made when no warrant at all was outstanding against respondent. The holding in Leon rested on the majority's
doubt "that exclusion of evidence seized pursuant to a warrant will have a significant deterrent effect on the issuing
judge or magistrate." Id., at 916. The reasoning in Leon
assumed the existence of a warrant; it was, and remains,
wholly inapplicable to warrantless searches and seizures.2

The Fourth Amendment's Warrant Clause provides the
fundamental check on official invasions of the individual's
right to privacy. E. g., Harris v. United States, 331 U. S.
145, 195-196 (1947) (Jackson, J., dissenting); see generally
Kamisar, Does (Did) (Should) the Exclusionary Rule Rest on
a "Principled Basis" Rather Than an "Empirical Proposition"?, 16 Creighton L. Rev. 565, 571-579 (1983). Leon
stands for the dubious but limited proposition that courts
should not look behind the face of a warrant on which police
have relied in good faith. The Leon Court's exemption of
judges and magistrates from the deterrent ambit of the exclusionary rule rested, consistently with the emphasis on the
warrant requirement, on those officials' constitutionally determined role in issuing warrants. See 468 U. S., at 915-
917. Taken on its own terms, Leon's logic does not extend
to the time after the warrant has issued; nor does it extend
to court clerks and functionaries, some of whom work in the
same building with police officers and may have more regular and direct contact with police than with judges or
magistrates.

2 As Justice O'Connor observed in her dissent in Illinois v. Krull, 480
U. S. 340 (1987): "[T]he Leon Court relied explicitly on the tradition of

judicial independence in concluding that, until it was presented with evidence to the contrary, there was relatively little cause for concern that
judicial officers might take the opportunity presented by the good-faith
exception to authorize unconstitutional searches." Id., at 365. I joined
that dissent, and I take exception to the majority's pronouncement that
today's opinion is "consistent with" it. Ante, at 14.

The Phoenix Police Department was part of the chain ofinformation that resulted in respondent's unlawful, warrantless arrest. We should reasonably presume that law en-forcement officials, who stand in the best position to monitor
such errors as occurred here, can influence mundane commu-nication procedures in order to prevent those errors. That
presumption comports with the notion that the exclusionaryrule exists to deter future police misconduct systemically.
See, e. g., Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 492 (1976); Dunawayv.

New York, 442 U. S. 200, 221 (1979) (Stevens, J., concur-ring); see generally Kamisar, 16 Creighton L. Rev., at 659-

662; Stewart, 83 Colum. L. Rev., at 1400. The deterrent pur-pose extends to law enforcement as a whole, not merely to
"the arresting officer." Compare ante, at 15, with Whiteleyv.

Warden, Wyo. State Penitentiary, 401 U. S. 560, 568 (1971).Consequently, the Phoenix officers' good faith does not diminish the deterrent value of invalidating their arrest ofrespondent.

The Court seeks to minimize the impact of its holding on
the security of the citizen by referring to the testimony ofthe Chief Clerk of the East Phoenix Number One Justice

Court that in her "particular court" this type of error oc-curred " `maybe on[c]e every three or four years.' " See

on which to base a conclusion that computer error poses no
appreciable threat to Fourth Amendment interests. For
support, the Court cites a case from 1948. See ante, at 15,
citing Johnson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10. The Court
overlooks the reality that computer technology has changed
the nature of threats to citizens' privacy over the past half
century. See post, at 26-28. What has not changed is the
reality that only that fraction of Fourth Amendment violations held to have resulted in unlawful arrests is ever noted
and redressed. As Justice Jackson observed: "There may
be, and I am convinced that there are, many unlawful
searches . . . of innocent people which turn up nothing incriminating, in which no arrest is made, about which courts
do nothing, and about which we never hear." Brinegar v.
United States, 338 U. S. 160, 181 (1949) (dissenting opinion).
Moreover, even if errors in computer records of warrants
were rare, that would merely minimize the cost of enforcing
the exclusionary rule in cases like this.

While I agree with Justice Ginsburg that premature
adjudication of this issue is particularly unwise because we
have much to learn about the consequences of computer
error as well as the efficacy of other preventive measures,
see post, at 29-30, one consequence of the Court's holding
seems immediately obvious. Its most serious impact will be
on the otherwise innocent citizen who is stopped for a minor
traffic infraction and is wrongfully arrested based on erroneous information in a computer data base. I assume the police officer who reasonably relies on the computer information would be immune from liability in a $ 1983 action. Of
course, the Court has held that respondeat superior is unavailable as a basis for imposing liability on his or her municipality. See Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs.,

have any power to discourage official error of this kind, itmust be through application of the exclusionary rule.

The use of general warrants to search for evidence of vio-lations of the Crown's revenue laws understandably outraged
the authors of the Bill of Rights. See, e. g., Lo-Ji Sales, Inc.v.

New York, 442 U. S. 319, 325 (1979); Weeks v. United States,232 U. S. 383, 389-391 (1914). " `It is a power, that places

searched on a public street simply because some bureaucrathas failed to maintain an accurate computer data base strikes
me as equally outrageous. In this case, of course, such anerror led to the fortuitous detection of respondent's unlawful
possession of marijuana, and the suppression of the fruit ofthe error would prevent the prosecution of his crime. That
cost, however, must be weighed against the interest in pro-tecting other, wholly innocent citizens from unwarranted indignity. In my judgment, the cost is amply offset by an ap-propriately "jealous regard for maintaining the integrity of
individual rights." Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643, 647 (1961).For this reason, as well as those set forth by

Court thus follows the presumption announced in Michiganv.

Long, 463 U. S. 1032 (1983): If it is unclear whether a statecourt's decision rests on state or federal law, Long dictates

the assumption that the state court relied on federal law.On the basis of that assumption, the Court asserts jurisdiction to review the decision of the Arizona Supreme Court.The Long presumption, as I see it, impedes the States'
ability to serve as laboratories for testing solutions to novellegal problems. I would apply the opposite presumption
and assume that Arizona's Supreme Court has ruled for itsown State and people, under its own constitutional recognition of individual security against unwarranted state intru-sion. Accordingly, I would dismiss the writ of certiorari.

Isaac Evans was arrested because a computer record erro-neously identified an outstanding misdemeanor arrest warrant in his name. The Arizona Supreme Court's suppressionof evidence obtained from this unlawful arrest did not rest
on a close analysis of this Court's Fourth Amendment prece-dents. Indeed, the court found our most relevant decision,
United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897 (1984), "not helpful."177 Ariz. 201, 203, 866 P. 2d 869, 871 (1994). Instead, the

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
Specifically, the Arizona Supreme Court saw the growinguse of computerized records in law enforcement as a development presenting new dangers to individual liberty; excludingevidence seized as a result of incorrect computer data, the
Arizona court anticipated, would reduce the incidence of uncorrected records:

"The dissent laments the `high costs' of the exclusion-ary rule, and suggests that its application here is `purposeless' and provides `no offsetting benefits.' Such anassertion ignores the fact that arrest warrants result in
a denial of human liberty, and are therefore among the
most important of legal documents. It is repugnant tothe principles of a free society that a person should ever

be taken into police custody because of a computer errorprecipitated by government carelessness. As automation increasingly invades modern life, the potential forOrwellian mischief grows. Under such circumstances,
the exclusionary rule is a `cost' we cannot afford to be
without." Id., at 204, 866 P. 2d, at 872.

Thus, the Arizona court did not consider this case to in-volve simply and only a court employee's slip in failing to

communicate with the police, or a police officer's oversight infailing to record information received from a court employee.
That court recognized a "potential for Orwellian mischief " in
the government's increasing reliance on computer technologyin law enforcement. The Arizona Supreme Court concluded

that Leon's distinction between police conduct and judicialconduct loses force where, as here, the error derives not from
a discretionary judicial function, but from inattentive recordkeeping. Application of an exclusionary rule in the circumstances Evans' case presents, the Arizona court said, "will
hopefully serve to improve the efficiency of those who keep
records in our criminal justice system." Ibid.

Invoking Long, this Court's majority presumes that the
Arizona Supreme Court relied on federal law. Long in514us1$30P 06-11-98 18:12:59 PAGES OPINPGT

structs that a state-court opinion discussing both state andfederal precedents shall be deemed to rely on federal law,

absent a plain statement in the opinion that the decisionrests on state law. 463 U. S., at 1040-1042.

this case illustrates, I would choose the opposite plain state-ment rule. I would presume, absent a plain statement to

the contrary, that a state court's decision of the kind here atissue rests on an independent state-law ground.

Widespread reliance on computers to store and convey in-formation generates, along with manifold benefits, new possibilities of error, due to both computer malfunctions and oper-ator mistakes. Most germane to this case, computerization
greatly amplifies an error's effect, and correspondingly inten-sifies the need for prompt correction; for inaccurate data can
infect not only one agency, but the many agencies that shareaccess to the data base. The computerized data bases of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Crime Informa-tion Center (NCIC), to take a conspicuous example, contain

2 The Long presumption becomes operative when two conditions are
met: (1) the state-court decision must "fairly appea[r] to rest primarily on
federal law, or to be interwoven with the federal law"; and (2) "the adequacy and independence of any possible state law ground [must] not [be]
clear from the face of the opinion." 463 U. S., at 1040-1041.

3 I recognize, in accord with Long on this point, that there will be cases

in which a presumption concerning exercise of the Court's jurisdiction should yield, i. e., exceptional instances in which vacation of a state
court's judgment and remand for clarification of the court's decision is in
order. See id., at 1041, n. 6 ("There may be certain circumstances in
which clarification is necessary or desirable, and we will not be foreclosed
from taking the appropriate action."); Capital Cities Media, Inc. v. Toole,

court might deem appropriate to clarify the ground of its decision).

over 23 million records, identifying, among other things, per-sons and vehicles sought by law enforcement agencies nationwide. See Hearings before the Subcommittee on theDepartments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary,
and Related Agencies of the House Committee on Appropria-tions, 102d Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2B, p. 467 (1992). NCIC information is available to approximately 71,000 federal, state,and local agencies. See Hearings before the Subcommittee
on the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, theJudiciary, and Related Agencies of the House Committee on
Appropriations, 103d Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 2A, p. 489 (1993).Thus, any mistake entered into the NCIC spreads nationwide in an instant.Isaac Evans' arrest exemplifies the risks associated with
computerization of arrest warrants. Though his arrest wasin fact warrantless--the warrant once issued having been
quashed over two weeks before the episode in suit--the com-puter reported otherwise. Evans' case is not idiosyncratic.
Rogan v. Los Angeles, 668 F. Supp. 1384 (CD Cal. 1987), simi-larly indicates the problem. There, the Los Angeles Police
Department, in 1982, had entered into the NCIC computeran arrest warrant for a man suspected of robbery and murder. Because the suspect had been impersonating TerryDean Rogan, the arrest warrant erroneously named Rogan.
Compounding the error, the Los Angeles Police Departmenthad failed to include a description of the suspect's physical
characteristics. During the next two years, this incorrectand incomplete information caused Rogan to be arrested four
times, three times at gunpoint, after stops for minor trafficinfractions in Michigan and Oklahoma. See id., at 1387-
1389.4 In another case of the same genre, the DistrictCourt observed:

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
"Because of the inaccurate listing in the NCIC computer, defendant was a `marked man' for the five months
prior to his arrest . . . . At any time . . . a routine check
by the police could well result in defendant's arrest,
booking, search and detention. . . . Moreover, this could

happen anywhere in the United States where law enforcement officers had access to NCIC information.
Defendant was subject to being deprived of his liberty
at any time and without any legal basis." United States
v. Mackey, 387 F. Supp. 1121, 1124 (Nev. 1975).

In the instant case, the Court features testimony of the
Chief Clerk of the Justice Court in East Phoenix to the effect
that errors of the kind Evans encountered are reported only
"on[c]e every three or four years." Ante, at 15 (citing App.
37). But the same witness also recounted that, when the
error concerning Evans came to light, an immediate check
revealed that three other errors of the very same kind
had occurred on "that same day." See ante, at 21-22, and
n. 3 (Stevens, J., dissenting).

This Court and the Arizona Supreme Court hold diverse
views on the question whether application of an exclusionary
rule will reduce the incidence of erroneous computer data
left without prompt correction. Observing that "court
clerks are not adjuncts to the law enforcement team engaged
in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime,"
the Court reasons that "there is no basis for believing that
application of the exclusionary rule in these circumstances
will have a significant effect on court employees responsible
for informing the police that a warrant has been quashed."
Ante, at 15. In the Court's view, exclusion of evidence, even
if capable of deterring police officer errors, cannot deter the

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
carelessness of other governmental actors.5 Whatever federal precedents may indicate--an issue on which I voice no
opinion--the Court's conclusion is not the lesson inevitably
to be drawn from logic or experience.

In this electronic age, particularly with respect to recordkeeping, court personnel and police officers are not neatly
compartmentalized actors. Instead, they serve together
to carry out the State's information-gathering objectives.
Whether particular records are maintained by the police or
the courts should not be dispositive where a single computer
data base can answer all calls. Not only is it artificial to
distinguish between court clerk and police clerk slips; in
practice, it may be difficult to pinpoint whether one official,
e. g., a court employee, or another, e. g., a police officer,
caused the error to exist or to persist. Applying an exclusionary rule as the Arizona court did may well supply a
powerful incentive to the State to promote the prompt updating of computer records. That was the Arizona Supreme
Court's hardly unreasonable expectation. The incentive to
update promptly would be diminished if court-initiated records were exempt from the rule's sway.

5 It has been suggested that an exclusionary rule cannot deter carelessness, but can affect only intentional or reckless misconduct. This suggestion runs counter to a premise underlying all of negligence law--that imposing liability for negligence, i. e., lack of due care, creates an incentive
to act with greater care.

That the mistake may have been made by a clerical worker does not
alter the conclusion that application of the exclusionary rule has deterrent
value. Just as the risk of respondeat superior liability encourages employers to supervise more closely their employees' conduct, so the risk of
exclusion of evidence encourages policymakers and systems managers to
monitor the performance of the systems they install and the personnel
employed to operate those systems. In the words of the trial court, the
mistake in Evans' case was "perhaps the negligence of the Justice Court,
or the negligence of the Sheriff's office. But it is still the negligence of
the State." App. 51.

The debate over the efficacy of an exclusionary rule re-veals that deterrence is an empirical question, not a logical

one. "It is one of the happy incidents of the federal systemthat a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose,
serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic ex-periments without risk to the rest of the country."

NewState Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 311 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). With that facet of our federalism inmind, this Court should select a jurisdictional presumption
that encourages States to explore different means to securerespect for individual rights in modern times.

Historically, state laws were the source, and state courtsthe arbiters, of individual rights. Linde, First Things First:
Rediscovering the States' Bills of Rights, 9 U. Balt. L. Rev.379, 382 (1980). The drafters of the Federal Bill of Rights
looked to provisions in state constitutions as models. Id.,at 381. Moreover, many States that adopted constitutions
after 1789 modeled their bills of rights on pre-existing stateconstitutions, rather than on the Federal Bill of Rights.
Ibid. And before this Court recognized that the FourteenthAmendment--which constrains actions by States--incorporates provisions of the Federal Bill of Rights, state consti-tutional rights, as interpreted by state courts, imposed the
primary constraints on state action. Brennan, State Con-stitutions and the Protection of Individual Rights, 90 Harv.
L. Rev. 489, 501-502 (1977).State courts interpreting state law remain particularly
well situated to enforce individual rights against the States.Institutional constraints, it has been observed, may limit the
ability of this Court to enforce the federal constitutionalguarantees. Sager, Fair Measure: The Legal Status of
Underenforced Constitutional Norms, 91 Harv. L. Rev. 1212,1217-1218 (1978). Prime among the institutional constraints, this Court is reluctant to intrude too deeply intoareas traditionally regulated by the States. This aspect of

federalism does not touch or concern state courts interpret-ing state law.

III
Under Long, when state courts engage in the essentialprocess of developing state constitutional law, they may insulate their decisions from this Court's review by means of aplain statement of intent to rest upon an independent state
ground. The plain statement option does not, however,make pleas for reconsideration of the Long presumption
much ado about nothing.6 Both on a practical and on a sym-bolic level, the presumption chosen matters.

The presumption is an imperfect barometer of statecourts' intent. Although it is easy enough for a state court
to say the requisite magic words, the court may not recog-nize that its opinion triggers Long's plain statement requirement. "[A]pplication of Long 's presumption depends on awhole series of `soft' requirements: the state decision must
`fairly appear' to rest `primarily' on federal law or be `inter-woven' with federal law, and the independence of the state
ground must be `not clear' from the face of the state opinion.These are not self-applying concepts." P. Bator, D. Meltzer,
P. Mishkin, & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler's The FederalCourts and the Federal System 552 (3d ed. 1988) (hereinafter
Hart and Wechsler); cf. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722,735-740 (1991) (declining to apply

Long presumption to sum-mary dismissal order).

Can the highest court of a State satisfy Long's "plainstatement" requirement in advance, through a blanket disclaimer? The New Hampshire Supreme Court, for example,has declared: "We hereby make clear that when this court
cites federal or other State court opinions in construing pro-visions of the New Hampshire Constitution or statutes, we

6 Long has generated many pages of academic commentary, some supportive, some critical of the presumption. See, e. g., P. Bator, D. Meltzer,
P. Mishkin, & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the
Federal System 553, n. 3 (3d ed. 1988) (citing commentary).

rely on those precedents merely for guidance and do not con-sider our results bound by those decisions."

State v. Ball,
124 N. H. 226, 233, 471 A. 2d 347, 352 (1983). See also Statev.

Kennedy, 295 Ore. 260, 267, 666 P. 2d 1316, 1321 (1983)
("Lest there be any doubt about it, when this court cites
federal opinions in interpreting a provision of Oregon law, itdoes so because it finds the views there expressed persuasive, not because it considers itself bound to do so by itsunderstanding of federal doctrines."). This Court's stated
reluctance to look beneath or beyond the very state-courtopinion at issue in order to answer the jurisdictional question, see Long, 463 U. S., at 1040, may render such blanket
declarations ineffective. Cf. Hart and Wechsler 553 ("[T]he
Court's protestations--that its presumption shows greater
respect for state courts than asking them to clarify their
opinions--ring hollow: Long simply puts the burden of clarification on the state court in advance.").

Application of the Long presumption has increased the incidence of nondispositive United States Supreme Court determinations--instances in which state courts, on remand,
have reinstated their prior judgments after clarifying their
reliance on state grounds. Westling, Advisory Opinions and
the "Constitutionally Required" Adequate and Independent
State Grounds Doctrine, 63 Tulane L. Rev. 379, 389, and n. 47
(1988) (pre-Long, i. e., between January 1, 1978, and June 30,
1983, 14.3% of decisions (2 of 14) involving potentially adequate and independent state grounds were reinstated on
state grounds upon remand; post-Long, i. e., between July 1,
1983, and January 1, 1988, 26.7% of such decisions (4 of 15)
were reinstated on remand). Even if these reinstatements
do not render the Supreme Court's opinion technically "advisory," see Hart and Wechsler 537, they do suggest that the
Court unnecessarily spent its resources on cases better left,
at the time in question, to state-court solution.

The Long presumption, in sum, departs from the traditional understanding that "every federal court is `without

jurisdiction' unless `the contrary appears affirmatively from
the record.' " Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U. S. 673, 692
(1986) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (quoting King Bridge Co. v.
Otoe County, 120 U. S. 225, 226 (1887)). And it is out of sync
with the principle that this Court will avoid constitutional
questions when an alternative basis of decision fairly presents itself. Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346-347
(1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). Most critically, as this case
shows, the Long presumption interferes prematurely with
state-court endeavors to explore different solutions to new
problems facing modern society.

I recognize that "[s]ince Long, we repeatedly have followed [its] `plain statement' requirement," Harris v. Reed,
489 U. S. 255, 261, n. 7 (1989), and that precedent ought not
be overruled absent strong cause. But the Long ruling itself did

"a virtual about-face regarding the guidelines for determining the reviewability of state court decisions in situations where the state court opinion is not absolutely
clear about the bases on which it rests. The traditional
presumption was that the Court lacked jurisdiction unless its authority to review was clear on the face of the
state court opinion. When faced with uncertainty, the
Court in the past occasionally remanded such cases to
the state court for clarification. But more commonly,
the Court would deny jurisdiction where there was
uncertainty." G. Gunther, Constitutional Law 56 (12th
ed. 1991).

Restoring a main rule "deny[ing] jurisdiction where there
[is] uncertainty," ibid., would stop this Court from asserting
authority in matters belonging, or at least appropriately left,
to the States' domain. Cf. Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304
U. S. 64, 77-80 (1938). Recognizing that "adequate state

wise," Long, 463 U. S., at 1066 (Stevens, J., dissenting),7would also avoid premature settlement of important federal

questions. The submission for the United States is tellingin this regard. While filing in support of petitioner, the
United States acknowledges the problem occasioned by"erroneous information contained in law enforcement
computer-information systems," but does not see this caseas a proper vehicle for a pathmarking opinion. The United
States suggests that the Court "await a case in which rele-vant characteristics of such systems and the legal questions
they pose can be thoroughly explored." Brief for UnitedStates as

Amicus Curiae 13.

The Arizona Supreme Court found it "repugnant to theprinciples of a free society," 177 Ariz., at 204, 866 P. 2d,

at 872, to take a person "into police custody because of acomputer error precipitated by government carelessness."
Ibid. Few, I believe, would disagree. Whether, in order toguard against such errors, "the exclusionary rule is a `cost'
we cannot afford to be without," ibid., seems to me a ques-tion this Court should not rush to decide. The Court errs,
as I see it, in presuming that Arizona rested its decision onfederal grounds. I would abandon the

Long presumptionand dismiss the writ because the generally applicable obligation affirmatively to establish the Court's jurisdiction has notbeen satisfied.

7 For instances in which a state court's decision, even if arguably placed
on a state ground, embodies a misconstruction of federal law threatening
gravely to mislead, or to engender disuniformity, confusion, or instability,
a Supreme Court order vacating the judgment and remanding for clarification should suffice. See Hart and Wechsler 554; see also supra, at 26,

SWINT et al. v. CHAMBERS COUNTYCOMMISSION

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 93-1636. Argued January 10, 1995--Decided March 1, 1995
In the wake of police raids on a nightclub in Chambers County, Alabama,

two of the club's owners joined by an employee and a patron (all petitioners here) sued respondent Chambers County Commission, along with a
municipality and three individual police officers; petitioners sought damages and other relief under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 for alleged civil rights
violations. The District Court denied the summary judgment motions
of all five defendants, ruling, inter alia, that the individual officers were
not entitled to qualified immunity from suit and that the sheriff who
authorized the raids, although a state employee, may have been the
county's final policymaker for law enforcement. The District Court
stated that it would rule dispositively on the county's liability before
jury deliberations. Invoking the rule that an order denying qualified
immunity is appealable before trial, Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511,
530, the individual defendants immediately appealed. The county commission also appealed, arguing that the denial of its summary judgment
motion was immediately appealable as a collateral order satisfying the
test announced in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S.
541, 546, and, alternatively, that the Eleventh Circuit had "pendent appellate jurisdiction" to decide the questions presented by the commission. The Eleventh Circuit rejected the county commission's first argument, but asserted pendent jurisdiction over the commission's appeal.
Determining that the sheriff was not a policymaker for the county, the
Eleventh Circuit held that the county commission qualified for summary judgment.

Held: The Eleventh Circuit lacked jurisdiction to rule on the county commission's liability at this interlocutory stage of the litigation and, accordingly, should have dismissed the commission's appeal. Pp. 41-51.

(a) The order denying the county commission's summary judgment
motion was not an appealable collateral order under Cohen, supra, at
546, which allows immediate appeal from decisions that are conclusive,
resolve important questions separate from the merits, and are effectively unreviewable on appeal from final judgment. The order in question fails this test because it was tentative, the District Court having
announced its intention to revisit its initial determination. Moreover,

514us1$31Z 05-29-98 14:50:44 PAGES OPINPGT
36 SWINT v. CHAMBERS COUNTY COMM'N

Syllabus
the order is effectively reviewable after final judgment, because the
commission's assertion that the sheriff is not its policymaker ranks
solely as a defense to liability, not as an immunity from suit that is
effectively lost if the case is erroneously permitted to go to trial. See
Mitchell, supra, at 526. Pp. 41-43.

(b) There is no "pendent party" appellate jurisdiction of the kind the
Eleventh Circuit purported to exercise. Although that court unquestionably had jurisdiction immediately to review the denial of the individual officers' summary judgment motions, it did not thereby gain authority to review at once the unrelated question of the county commission's
liability. The parties' arguments to the contrary drift away from the
statutory instructions Congress has given to control the timing of appellate proceedings. In particular, 28 U. S. C. $ 1292(b) confers on district
courts first line discretion to certify for immediate appeal interlocutory
orders deemed pivotal and debatable; this provision grants to the court
of appeals discretion to review only orders first certified by the district
court. If courts of appeals had jurisdiction of the type here claimed
by the Eleventh Circuit, $ 1292(b)'s two-tiered arrangement would be
severely undermined. Furthermore, provisions Congress passed in
1990 and 1992, 28 U. S. C. $ 2072(c) and 28 U. S. C. $ 1292(e), designate
the rulemaking process as the way to define or refine when a district
court ruling is "final" and when an interlocutory order is appealable.
These legislative provisions counsel resistance to expansion of appellate
jurisdiction by court decision. Abney v. United States, 431 U. S. 651,
662-663, and United States v. Stanley, 483 U. S. 669, 676-677, securely
support the conclusion that the Eleventh Circuit lacked jurisdiction to
review the denial of the county commission's summary judgment motion.
Although the parties are correct that this Court has not universally
required courts of appeals to confine review to the precise decision independently subject to review, the Court need not definitively or preemptively settle here whether or when it may be proper for a court of appeals with jurisdiction over one ruling to review, conjunctively, related
rulings that are not themselves independently appealable. The parties
do not--indeed could not--contend that the District Court's decision to
deny the commission's motion on the ground that the sheriff may have
been a county policymaker was inextricably intertwined with that
court's decision to deny the individual defendants' qualified immunity
motions, or that review of the former decision was necessary to ensure
meaningful review of the latter. Pp. 43-51.

Opinion of the Court
that the Eleventh Circuit lacked jurisdiction to rule on thecounty commission's liability at this interlocutory stage of

the litigation.The Eleventh Circuit unquestionably had jurisdiction to
review the denial of the individual police officer defendants'motions for summary judgment based on their alleged qualified immunity from suit. But the Circuit Court did notthereby gain authority to review the denial of the Chambers
County Commission's motion for summary judgment. Thecommission's appeal, we hold, does not fit within the "collateral order" doctrine, nor is there "pendent party" appellateauthority to take up the commission's case. We therefore
vacate the relevant portion of the Eleventh Circuit's judg-ment and remand the case for proceedings consistent with
this opinion. I

On December 14, 1990, and again on March 29, 1991, lawenforcement officers from Chambers County and the city of
Wadley, Alabama, raided the Capri Club in ChambersCounty as part of a narcotics operation. The raids were
conducted without a search warrant or an arrest warrant.Petitioners filed suit, alleging, among other claims for relief,
violations of their federal civil rights. Petitioners namedas defendants the county commission; the city of Wadley;
and three individual defendants, Chambers County SheriffJames C. Morgan, Wadley Police Chief Freddie Morgan, and
Wadley Police Officer Gregory Dendinger.

The five defendants moved for summary judgment onvarying grounds. The three individual defendants asserted

qualified immunity from suit on petitioners' federal claims.

it liable under $ 1983. See Monell v. New York City Dept.
of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 694 (1978) (a local government
may not be sued under $ 1983 for injury inflicted solely by
its nonpolicymaking employees or agents). The Chambers
County Commission argued that County Sheriff James C.
Morgan, who authorized the raids, was not a policymaker for
the county.

The United States District Court for the Middle District
of Alabama denied the motions for summary judgment. The
District Court agreed that $ 1983 liability could not be imposed on the city for an injury inflicted by a nonpolicymaking employee; that court denied the city's summary judgment motion, however, because the city had failed to argue
that Wadley Police Chief Freddie Morgan was not its policymaker for law enforcement. Regarding the county commission's motion, the District Court was "persuaded by the
Plaintiffs that Sheriff [James C.] Morgan may have been the
final decision-maker for the County in ferreting out crime,
although he is a State of Alabama employee." App. to Pet.
for Cert. 67a. The District Court later denied the defendants' motions for reconsideration, but indicated its intent to
revisit, before jury deliberations, the question whether Sheriff Morgan was a policymaker for the county:

"The Chambers County Defendants correctly point
out that whether Sheriff James Morgan was the final
policy maker is a question of law that this Court can
decide. What th[is] Court decided in its [prior order]
was that the Plaintiffs had come forward with sufficient
evidence to persuade this Court that Sheriff Morgan
may be the final policy maker for the County. The parties will have an opportunity to convince this Court that
Sheriff Morgan was or was not the final policy maker

for the County, and the Court will make a ruling as a
matter of law on that issue before the case goes to the
jury." Id., at 72a.

Invoking the rule that an order denying qualified immunity is appealable before trial, Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S.
511, 530 (1985), the individual defendants immediately appealed. The city of Wadley and the Chambers County Commission also appealed, arguing, first, that the denial of their
summary judgment motions--like the denial of the individual defendants' summary judgment motions--was immediately appealable as a collateral order satisfying the test announced in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337
U. S. 541, 546 (1949) (decisions that are conclusive, that
resolve important questions apart from the merits of the
underlying action, and that are effectively unreviewable on
appeal from final judgment may be appealed immediately).
Alternatively, the city and county commission urged the
Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals to exercise "pendent appellate jurisdiction," a power that court had asserted in earlier cases. Stressing the Eleventh Circuit's undisputed jurisdiction over the individual defendants' qualified immunity
pleas, the city and county commission maintained that, in the
interest of judicial economy, the court should resolve, simultaneously, the city's and commission's appeals.

The Eleventh Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part
the District Court's order denying summary judgment for the
individual defendants. 5 F. 3d 1435, 1448 (1993), modified, 11
F. 3d 1030, 1031-1032 (1994). Next, the Eleventh Circuit held
that the District Court's rejections of the county commission's and city's summary judgment motions were not immediately appealable as collateral orders. 5 F. 3d, at 1449,
1452. Nevertheless, the Circuit Court decided to exercise
pendent appellate jurisdiction over the county commission's
appeal. Id., at 1449-1450. Holding that Sheriff James C.

Opinion of the Court
Morgan was not a policymaker for the county in the area oflaw enforcement, the Eleventh Circuit reversed the District

Court's order denying the county commission's motion forsummary judgment.

Id., at 1450-1451. The Eleventh Circuit declined to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over
the city's appeal because the District Court had not yet de-cided whether Wadley Police Chief Freddie Morgan was a

policymaker for the city. Id., at 1451-1452.1We granted certiorari to review the Court of Appeals' decision that Sheriff Morgan is not a policymaker for ChambersCounty. 512 U. S. 1204 (1994). We then instructed the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing this question:Given the Eleventh Circuit's jurisdiction to review immediately the District Court's refusal to grant summaryjudgment for the individual defendants in response to their

pleas of qualified immunity, did the Circuit Court also have

jurisdiction to review at once the denial of the countycommission's summary judgment motion? 513 U. S. 958

(1994). We now hold that the Eleventh Circuit should havedismissed the county commission's appeal for want of
jurisdiction.

II

We inquire first whether the denial of the county commission's summary judgment motion was appealable as a collateral order. The answer, as the Court of Appeals recognized,
is a firm "No."

By statute, federal courts of appeals have "jurisdiction of
appeals from all final decisions of the district courts," except
where direct review may be had in this Court. 28 U. S. C.

$ 1291. "The collateral order doctrine is best understood not
as an exception to the `final decision' rule laid down by Con1 On Sheriff James C. Morgan's suggestion for rehearing en banc, the
Eleventh Circuit modified its opinion with respect to an issue not relevant
here and denied rehearing en banc. 11 F. 3d 1030 (1994).

gress in $ 1291, but as a `practical construction' of it." Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U. S. 863,
867 (1994) (quoting Cohen, 337 U. S., at 546). In Cohen, we
held that $ 1291 permits appeals not only from a final decision
by which a district court disassociates itself from a case, but
also from a small category of decisions that, although they do
not end the litigation, must nonetheless be considered "final."
Id., at 546. That small category includes only decisions that
are conclusive, that resolve important questions separate
from the merits, and that are effectively unreviewable on
appeal from the final judgment in the underlying action.
Ibid.

The District Court planned to reconsider its ruling on the
county commission's summary judgment motion before the
case went to the jury. That court had initially determined
only that "Sheriff Morgan . . . may have been the final policy
maker for the County." App. to Pet. for Cert. 67a (emphasis
added). The ruling thus fails the Cohen test, which "disallow[s] appeal from any decision which is tentative, informal
or incomplete." 337 U. S., at 546; see Coopers & Lybrand v.
Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, 469 (1978) (order denying class certification held not appealable under collateral order doctrine,
in part because such an order is "subject to revision in the
District Court").

Moreover, the order denying the county commission's summary judgment motion does not satisfy Cohen's requirement

that the decision be effectively unreviewable after final judgment. When we placed within the collateral order doctrine
decisions denying pleas of government officials for qualified
immunity, we stressed that an official's qualified immunity is
"an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability; and like an absolute immunity, it is effectively lost if a
case is erroneously permitted to go to trial." Mitchell, 472
U. S., at 526 (emphasis in original).

Opinion of the Court
The county commission invokes our decision in Monell,which held that municipalities are liable under $ 1983 only

for violations of federal law that occur pursuant to officialgovernmental policy or custom. Monell, the commission
contends, should be read to accord local governments a quali-fied right to be free from the burdens of trial. Accordingly,
the commission maintains, the commission should be able toappeal immediately the District Court's denial of its summary judgment motion. This argument undervalues a corepoint we reiterated last Term: "$ 1291 requires courts of appeals to view claims of a `right not to be tried' with skepti-cism, if not a jaundiced eye,"

Digital Equipment, 511 U. S.,at 873, for "virtually every right that could be enforced appropriately by pretrial dismissal might loosely be describedas conferring a `right not to stand trial,' "

ibid.; cf. UnitedStates v. MacDonald, 435 U. S. 850, 858-859 (1978) (denial of

pretrial motion to dismiss an indictment on speedy trialgrounds held not appealable under collateral order doctrine).

The commission's assertion that Sheriff Morgan is not itspolicymaker does not rank, under our decisions, as an immunity from suit. Instead, the plea ranks as a "mere defenseto liability."

Mitchell, 472 U. S., at 526. An erroneous rul-ing on liability may be reviewed effectively on appeal from

final judgment. Therefore, the order denying the countycommission's summary judgment motion was not an appealable collateral order.

III

Although the Court of Appeals recognized that the Dis-trict Court's order denying the county commission's summary judgment motion was not appealable as a collateral
order, the Circuit Court reviewed that ruling by assumingjurisdiction pendent to its undisputed jurisdiction to review

the denial of the individual defendants' summary judgmentmotions. Describing this "pendent appellate jurisdiction" as
discretionary, the Eleventh Circuit concluded that judicial

economy warranted its exercise in the instant case: "If theCounty Commission is correct about the merits in its appeal," the court explained, "reviewing the district court'sorder would put an end to the entire case against the
County . . . ." 5 F. 3d, at 1450.2

2 The Federal Courts of Appeals have endorsed the doctrine of pendent
appellate jurisdiction, although they have expressed varying views about
when such jurisdiction is properly exercised. See, e. g., Roque-Rodriguez
v. Lema Moya, 926 F. 2d 103, 105, n. 2 (CA1 1991) (noting that the First
Circuit has "refrained" from exercising pendent appellate jurisdiction, but
characterizing the Circuit's practice as "self-imposed"); Golino v. New
Haven, 950 F. 2d 864, 868-869 (CA2 1991) (exercising discretion to consider

(internal quotation marks omitted); Roberson v. Mullins, 29 F. 3d 132,

Opinion of the Court
Petitioners join respondent Chambers County Commission
in urging that the Eleventh Circuit had pendent appellate
jurisdiction to review the District Court's order denying the
commission's summary judgment motion. Both sides emphasize that $ 1291's final decision requirement is designed
to prevent parties from interrupting litigation by pursuing
piecemeal appeals. Once litigation has already been interrupted by an authorized pretrial appeal, petitioners and the
county commission reason, there is no cause to resist the
economy that pendent appellate jurisdiction promotes. See
Supplemental Brief for Petitioners 16-17; Supplemental
Brief for Respondent 5, 9. Respondent county commission
invites us to adopt a " `libera[l]' " construction of $ 1291, and
petitioners urge an interpretation sufficiently "[p]ractical"
and "[f]lexible" to accommodate pendent appellate review as
exercised by the Eleventh Circuit. See id., at 4; Supplemental Brief for Petitioners 14.

These arguments drift away from the statutory instructions Congress has given to control the timing of appellate
proceedings. The main rule on review of "final decisions,"

$ 1291, is followed by prescriptions for appeals from "interlocutory decisions," $ 1292. Section 1292(a) lists three cateinjunction order "extends to all matters `inextricably bound up' with th[at]
order"); Robinson v. Volkswagenwerk AG, 940 F. 2d 1369, 1374 (CA10
1991) (pendent appellate jurisdiction is properly exercised where "review
of the appealable issue involves consideration of factors closely related or
relevant to the otherwise nonappealable issue" and judicial economy is
served by review), cert. denied, 502 U. S. 1091 (1992); Stewart v. Baldwin
County Bd. of Ed., 908 F. 2d 1499, 1509 (CA11 1990) ("Pendent jurisdiction
is properly exercised over nonappealable decisions of the district court
when the reviewing court already has jurisdiction over one issue in the
case."); Consarc Corp. v. Iraqi Ministry, 27 F. 3d 695, 700 (CADC 1994)
("This Circuit has invoked [pendent appellate jurisdiction] only in a narrow
class of cases, to review an interlocutory order that itself is not yet subject
to appeal but is `closely related' to an appealable order.").

Opinion of the Court
gories of immediately appealable interlocutory decisions.3
Of prime significance to the jurisdictional issue before us,
Congress, in 1958, augmented the $ 1292 catalog of immediately appealable orders; Congress added a provision,

$ 1292(b), according the district courts circumscribed authority to certify for immediate appeal interlocutory orders
deemed pivotal and debatable. Section 1292(b) provides:

"When a district judge, in making in a civil action an
order not otherwise appealable under this section, shall
be of the opinion that such order involves a controlling
question of law as to which there is substantial ground
for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal
from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation, he shall so state in writing in
such order. The Court of Appeals which would have
jurisdiction of an appeal of such action may thereupon,
in its discretion, permit an appeal to be taken from such
order, if application is made to it within ten days after
the entry of the order: Provided, however, That application for an appeal hereunder shall not stay proceedings
in the district court unless the district judge or the
Court of Appeals or a judge thereof shall so order."

3 Section 1292(a) provides in relevant part:
"[T]he courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from:

"(1) Interlocutory orders of the district courts . . . granting, continuing,
modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or
modify injunctions, except where a direct review may be had in the Supreme Court;

"(2) Interlocutory orders appointing receivers, or refusing orders to
wind up receiverships or to take steps to accomplish the purposes thereof,
such as directing sales or other disposals of property;

"(3) Interlocutory decrees of such district courts or the judges thereof
determining the rights and liabilities of the parties to admiralty cases in
which appeals from final decrees are allowed."

Opinion of the Court
Congress thus chose to confer on district courts first line
discretion to allow interlocutory appeals.4 If courts of appeals had discretion to append to a Cohen-authorized appeal
from a collateral order further rulings of a kind neither independently appealable nor certified by the district court, then
the two-tiered arrangement $ 1292(b) mandates would be severely undermined.5

4 When it passed $ 1292(b), Congress had before it a proposal, by Jerome
Frank of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, to give the courts
of appeals sole discretion to allow interlocutory appeals. Judge Frank
had opposed making interlocutory appeal contingent upon procurement of
a certificate from the district judge; he advanced instead the following
proposal:

" `It shall be the duty of the district judge to state in writing whether
in his opinion the appeal is warranted; this statement shall be appended
to the petition for appeal or, as promptly as possible after the filing of
such petition in the court of appeals, shall be forwarded to said court by
the district judge. The court of appeals shall take into account, but shall
not be bound by, such statement in exercising its discretion.' " Undated
letter from study committee to the Tenth Circuit Judicial Conference, in
S. Rep. No. 2434, 85th Cong., 2d Sess., 8-9 (1958).

5 This case indicates how the initial discretion Congress lodged in district courts under $ 1292(b) could be circumvented by the "liberal" or
"flexible" approach petitioners and respondent prefer. The District Court
here ruled only tentatively on the county commission's motion and apparently contemplated receipt of further evidence from the parties before
ruling definitively. See order denying motions to reconsider, App. to Pet.
for Cert. 72a ("The parties will have an opportunity to convince this Court
that Sheriff Morgan was or was not the final policy maker for the County,
and the Court will make a ruling as a matter of law on that issue before
the case goes to the jury."); cf. Swint v. Wadley, 5 F. 3d 1435, 1452 (CA11
1993) (to determine whether an official is a final policymaker, a district
court "should examine not only the relevant positive law . . . but also the
relevant customs and practices having the force of law") (emphasis in
original). In view of the incomplete state of the District Court's adjudication, including some uncertainty whether plaintiffs meant to sue the
county as discrete from the commission members, it is unlikely that a

$ 1292(b) certification would have been forthcoming from the District
Judge.

48 SWINT v. CHAMBERS COUNTY COMM'N

Opinion of the Court
Two relatively recent additions to the Judicial Code alsocounsel resistance to expansion of appellate jurisdiction in

the manner endorsed by the Eleventh Circuit. The RulesEnabling Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 2071

et seq., gives this Court "the
power to prescribe general rules of practice and procedure
. . . for cases in the United States district courts . . . andcourts of appeals." $ 2072(a). In 1990, Congress added

$ 2072(c), which authorizes us to prescribe rules "defin[ing]
when a ruling of a district court is final for the purposes of
appeal under section 1291." Two years later, Congress
added $ 1292(e), which allows us to "prescribe rules, in accordance with section 2072 . . . to provide for an appeal of an
interlocutory decision to the courts of appeals that is not
otherwise provided for under [$ 1292] (a), (b), (c), or (d)."

Congress thus has empowered this Court to clarify when
a decision qualifies as "final" for appellate review purposes, and to expand the list of orders appealable on an
interlocutory basis. The procedure Congress ordered for
such changes, however, is not expansion by court decision,
but by rulemaking under $ 2072. Our rulemaking authority
is constrained by $$ 2073 and 2074, which require, among
other things, that meetings of bench-bar committees established to recommend rules ordinarily be open to the public,

$ 2073(c)(1), and that any proposed rule be submitted to Congress before the rule takes effect, $ 2074(a). Congress' designation of the rulemaking process as the way to define or
refine when a district court ruling is "final" and when an
interlocutory order is appealable warrants the Judiciary's
full respect.6

6 In the instant case, the Eleventh Circuit asserted not merely pendent
appellate jurisdiction, but pendent party appellate jurisdiction: The court
appended to its jurisdiction to review the denial of the individual defendants' qualified immunity motions jurisdiction to review the denial of the
commission's summary judgment motion. We note that in 1990, Congress endeavored to clarify and codify instances appropriate for the exercise of pendent or "supplemental" jurisdiction in district courts. 28

Opinion of the Court
Two decisions of this Court securely support the conclu-sion that the Eleventh Circuit lacked jurisdiction instantly

to review the denial of the county commission's summaryjudgment motion: Abney v. United States, 431 U. S. 651
(1977), and United States v. Stanley, 483 U. S. 669 (1987). In
Abney, we permitted appeal before trial of an order denyinga motion to dismiss an indictment on double jeopardy

grounds. Immediate appeal of that ruling, we held, fitwithin the Cohen collateral order doctrine. 431 U. S., at 662.
But we further held that the Court of Appeals lacked author-ity to review simultaneously the trial court's rejection of the
defendant's challenge to the sufficiency of the indictment.
Id., at 662-663. We explained:

"Our conclusion that a defendant may seek immediateappellate review of a district court's rejection of his double jeopardy claim is based on the special considerationspermeating claims of that nature which justify a departure from the normal rule of finality. Quite obviously,such considerations do not extend beyond the claim of
formal jeopardy and encompass other claims presentedto, and rejected by, the district court in passing on the
accused's motion to dismiss. Rather, such claims areappealable if, and only if, they too fall within Cohen's
collateral-order exception to the final-judgment rule.Any other rule would encourage criminal defendants to
seek review of, or assert, frivolous double jeopardyclaims in order to bring more serious, but otherwise
nonappealable questions to the attention of the courts ofappeals prior to conviction and sentence."

Id., at 663(citation omitted).

Petitioners suggest that Abney should control in criminalcases only. Supplemental Brief for Petitioners 11. But the
concern expressed in Abney--that a rule loosely allowingpendent appellate jurisdiction would encourage parties to

tal jurisdiction" over "claims that involve the joinder or intervention of
additional parties").

parlay Cohen-type collateral orders into multi-issue interloc-utory appeal tickets--bears on civil cases as well.

In Stanley, we similarly refused to allow expansion of thescope of an interlocutory appeal. That civil case involved
an order certified by the trial court, and accepted by the
appellate court, for immediate review pursuant to $ 1292(b).Immediate appellate review, we held, was limited to the

certified order; issues presented by other, noncertifiedorders could not be considered simultaneously. 483 U. S.,
at 676-677.The parties are correct that we have not universally required courts of appeals to confine review to the precise decision independently subject to appeal. See, e. g., Thornburgh
v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476
U. S. 747, 755-757 (1986) (Court of Appeals reviewing District Court's ruling on preliminary injunction request properly reviewed merits as well); Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin,
417 U. S. 156, 172-173 (1974) (Court of Appeals reviewing
District Court's order allocating costs of class notification
also had jurisdiction to review ruling on methods of notification); Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Stude, 346 U. S. 574, 578
(1954) (Court of Appeals reviewing order granting motion to
dismiss properly reviewed order denying opposing party's
motion to remand); Deckert v. Independence Shares Corp.,
311 U. S. 282, 287 (1940) (Court of Appeals reviewing order
granting preliminary injunction also had jurisdiction to review order denying motions to dismiss). Cf. Schlagenhauf
v. Holder, 379 U. S. 104, 110-111 (1964) (Court of Appeals
exercising mandamus power should have reviewed not only
whether District Court had authority to order mental and
physical examinations of defendant in personal injury case,
but also whether there was good cause for the ordered
examinations).

We need not definitively or preemptively settle here
whether or when it may be proper for a court of appeals,
with jurisdiction over one ruling, to review, conjunctively,

Opinion of the Court
related rulings that are not themselves independently ap-pealable. See supra, at 48 (describing provisions by Congress for rulemaking regarding appeals prior to the districtcourt's final disposition of entire case). The parties do not
contend that the District Court's decision to deny the Cham-bers County Commission's summary judgment motion was
inextricably intertwined with that court's decision to denythe individual defendants' qualified immunity motions, or
that review of the former decision was necessary to ensuremeaningful review of the latter. Cf. Kanji, The Proper
Scope of Pendent Appellate Jurisdiction in the CollateralOrder Context, 100 Yale L. J. 511, 530 (1990) ("Only where
essential to the resolution of properly appealed collateral or-ders should courts extend their Cohen jurisdiction to rulings
that would not otherwise qualify for expedited consider-ation."). Nor could the parties so argue. The individual
defendants' qualified immunity turns on whether they vio-lated clearly established federal law; the county commission's
liability turns on the allocation of law enforcement powerin Alabama.

* * *
The Eleventh Circuit's authority immediately to reviewthe District Court's denial of the individual police officer defendants' summary judgment motions did not include author-ity to review at once the unrelated question of the county
commission's liability. The District Court's preliminary rul-ing regarding the county did not qualify as a "collateral
order," and there is no "pendent party" appellate jurisdictionof the kind the Eleventh Circuit purported to exercise. We
therefore vacate the relevant portion of the Eleventh Cir-cuit's judgment and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 94-18. Argued January 10, 1995--Decided March 6, 1995
Petitioners filed this action in the Federal District Court, alleging that

their securities trading account had been mishandled by respondent
brokers. An arbitration panel, convened under the arbitration provision in the parties' standard-form contract and under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), awarded petitioners punitive damages and other
relief. The District Court and the Court of Appeals disallowed the punitive damages award because the contract's choice-of-law provision
specifies that "the laws of the State of New York" should govern, but
New York law allows only courts, not arbitrators, to award punitive
damages.

Held: The arbitral award should have been enforced as within the scope

of the contract between the parties. Pp. 55-64.

(a) This case is governed by what the contract has to say about the
arbitrability of petitioners' punitive damages claim. The FAA's central
purpose is to ensure "that private agreements to arbitrate are enforced
according to their terms." Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of
Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 479. This
Court's decisions make clear that if contracting parties agree to include
punitive damages claims within the issues to be arbitrated, the FAA
ensures that their agreement will be enforced according to its terms

arbitration. See, e. g., Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U. S.
265. Pp. 55-58.

(b) The Court of Appeals misinterpreted the parties' contract by
reading the choice-of-law provision and the arbitration provision as conflicting. Although the agreement contains no express reference to punitive damages claims, the fact that it is intended to include such claims
is demonstrated by considering separately the impact of each of the two
provisions, and then inquiring into their meaning taken together. This
process reveals that the choice-of-law provision is not, in itself, an unequivocal exclusion of punitive damages claims, that the arbitration provision strongly implies that an arbitral award of punitive damages is
appropriate, and that the best way to harmonize the two is to read "the
laws of the State of New York" to encompass substantive principles that

New York courts would apply, but not to include special rules limiting
the authority of arbitrators. Thus, the choice-of-law provision covers

I
In 1985, petitioners, Antonio Mastrobuono, then an assist-ant professor of medieval literature, and his wife Diana Mastrobuono, an artist, opened a securities trading account withrespondent Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc. (Shearson), by executing Shearson's standard-form Client's Agreement. Re-spondent Nick DiMinico, a vice president of Shearson, managed the Mastrobuonos' account until they closed it in 1987.In 1989, petitioners filed this action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleging thatrespondents had mishandled their account and claiming damages on a variety of state and federal law theories.Paragraph 13 of the parties' agreement contains an arbitration provision and a choice-of-law provision. Relying onthe arbitration provision and on $$ 3 and 4 of the Federal
Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C. $$ 3, 4, respondents filed amotion to stay the court proceedings and to compel arbitration pursuant to the rules of the National Association ofSecurities Dealers. The District Court granted that motion,
and a panel of three arbitrators was convened. After con-ducting hearings in Illinois, the panel ruled in favor of
petitioners.In the arbitration proceedings, respondents argued that
the arbitrators had no authority to award punitive damages.Nevertheless, the panel's award included punitive damages
of $400,000, in addition to compensatory damages of $159,327.Respondents paid the compensatory portion of the award but
filed a motion in the District Court to vacate the award ofpunitive damages. The District Court granted the motion,
812 F. Supp. 845 (ND Ill. 1993), and the Court of Appeals forthe Seventh Circuit affirmed, 20 F. 3d 713 (1994). Both
courts relied on the choice-of-law provision in paragraph 13

of the parties' agreement, which specifies that the contractshall be governed by New York law. Because the New York

Court of Appeals has decided that in New York the powerto award punitive damages is limited to judicial tribunals and
may not be exercised by arbitrators, Garrity v. Lyle Stuart,
Inc., 40 N. Y. 2d 354, 353 N. E. 2d 793 (1976), the DistrictCourt and the Seventh Circuit held that the panel of arbitrators had no power to award punitive damages in this case.We granted certiorari, 513 U. S. 921 (1994), because the
Courts of Appeals have expressed differing views onwhether a contractual choice-of-law provision may preclude
an arbitral award of punitive damages that otherwise wouldbe proper. Compare

Earlier this Term, we upheld the enforceability of a predis-pute arbitration agreement governed by Alabama law, even
though an Alabama statute provides that arbitration agree-ments are unenforceable. Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v.

Opinion of the Court
U. S. 213, 220 (1985). After determining that the FAAapplied to the parties' arbitration agreement, we readily

concluded that the federal statute pre-empted Alabama'sstatutory prohibition.

Allied-Bruce, 513 U. S., at 272-273,
281-282.

Petitioners seek a similar disposition of the case before ustoday. Here, the Seventh Circuit interpreted the contract

to incorporate New York law, including the Garrity rule thatarbitrators may not award punitive damages. Petitioners
ask us to hold that the FAA pre-empts New York's prohibi-tion against arbitral awards of punitive damages because this
state law is a vestige of the " ` "ancient" ' " judicial hostility
to arbitration. See Allied-Bruce, 513 U. S., at 270, quoting
Bernhardt v. Polygraphic Co. of America, Inc., 350 U. S. 198,
211, n. 5 (1956) (Frankfurter, J., concurring). Petitioners
rely on Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S. 1 (1984), and
Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S. 483 (1987), in which we held that
the FAA pre-empted two California statutes that purported
to require judicial resolution of certain disputes. In Southland, we explained that the FAA not only "declared a national policy favoring arbitration," but actually "withdrew
the power of the states to require a judicial forum for the
resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to
resolve by arbitration." 465 U. S., at 10.

Respondents answer that the choice-of-law provision in
their contract evidences the parties' express agreement that
punitive damages should not be awarded in the arbitration
of any dispute arising under their contract. Thus, they
claim, this case is distinguishable from Southland and Perry,
in which the parties presumably desired unlimited arbitration but state law stood in their way. Regardless of whether
the FAA pre-empts the Garrity decision in contracts not expressly incorporating New York law, respondents argue that
the parties may themselves agree to be bound by Garrity,
just as they may agree to forgo arbitration altogether. In
other words, if the contract says "no punitive damages," that

Opinion of the Court
is the end of the matter, for courts are bound to interpretcontracts in accordance with the expressed intentions of the

parties--even if the effect of those intentions is to limitarbitration.

We have previously held that the FAA's proarbitrationpolicy does not operate without regard to the wishes of the
contracting parties. In Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v.
Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489U. S. 468 (1989), the California Court of Appeal had construed a contractual provision to mean that the parties in-tended the California rules of arbitration, rather than the
FAA's rules, to govern the resolution of their dispute. Id.,at 472. Noting that the California rules were "manifestly
designed to encourage resort to the arbitral process," id., at476, and that they "generally foster[ed] the federal policy
favoring arbitration," id., at 476, n. 5, we concluded that suchan interpretation was entirely consistent with the federal
policy "to ensure the enforceability, according to their terms,of private agreements to arbitrate,"

id., at 476. After refer-ring to the holdings in
Southland and Perry, which struckdown state laws limiting agreed-upon arbitrability, we

added:

"But it does not follow that the FAA prevents the en-forcement of agreements to arbitrate under different

rules than those set forth in the Act itself. Indeed, sucha result would be quite inimical to the FAA's primary
purpose of ensuring that private agreements to arbi-trate are enforced according to their terms. Arbitration under the Act is a matter of consent, not coercion,and parties are generally free to structure their arbitration agreements as they see fit. Just as they may limitby contract the issues which they will arbitrate, see Mitsubishi [Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.,473 U. S. 614, 628 (1985)], so too may they specify by
contract the rules under which that arbitration will beconducted." Volt, 489 U. S., at 479.

58 MASTROBUONO v. SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON, INC.

Opinion of the Court
Relying on our reasoning in Volt, respondents thus arguethat the parties to a contract may lawfully agree to limit

the issues to be arbitrated by waiving any claim for punitivedamages. On the other hand, we think our decisions in
Allied-Bruce, Southland, and Perry make clear that if con-tracting parties agree to

include claims for punitive damageswithin the issues to be arbitrated, the FAA ensures that

their agreement will be enforced according to its terms evenif a rule of state law would otherwise exclude such claims
from arbitration. Thus, the case before us comes down towhat the contract has to say about the arbitrability of petitioners' claim for punitive damages.

III
Shearson's standard-form "Client Agreement," which peti-tioners executed, contains 18 paragraphs. The two relevant

provisions of the agreement are found in paragraph 13.2The first sentence of that paragraph provides, in part, that
the entire agreement "shall be governed by the laws of the

2 "Paragraph 13 of the Client's Agreement provides:
"This agreement shall inure to the benefit of your [Shearson's] successors and assigns[,] shall be binding on the undersigned, my [petitioners']
heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, and shall be governed by the
laws of the State of New York. Unless unenforceable due to federal or
state law, any controversy arising out of or relating to [my] accounts, to
transactions with you, your officers, directors, agents and/or employees
for me or to this agreement or the breach thereof, shall be settled by
arbitration in accordance with the rules then in effect, of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or the Boards of Directors of the
New York Stock Exchange, Inc. and/or the American Stock Exchange Inc.
as I may elect. If I do not make such election by registered mail addressed to you at your main office within 5 days after demand by you that
I make such election, then you may make such election. Judgment upon
any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction thereof. This agreement to arbitrate does not apply to future
disputes arising under certain of the federal securities laws to the extent
it has been determined as a matter of law that I cannot be compelled to
arbitrate such claims." App. to Pet. for Cert. 44.

State of New York." App. to Pet. for Cert. 44. The secondsentence provides that "any controversy" arising out of the

transactions between the parties "shall be settled by arbitra-tion" in accordance with the rules of the National Association
of Securities Dealers (NASD), or the Boards of Directors of
the New York Stock Exchange and/or the American StockExchange.

Ibid. The agreement contains no express
reference to claims for punitive damages. To ascertainwhether paragraph 13 expresses an intent to include or exclude such claims, we first address the impact of each of thetwo relevant provisions, considered separately. We then
move on to the more important inquiry: the meaning of the
two provisions taken together. See Restatement (Second)
of Contracts $ 202(2) (1979) ("A writing is interpreted as a
whole").

The choice-of-law provision, when viewed in isolation, may
reasonably be read as merely a substitute for the conflictof-laws analysis that otherwise would determine what law to
apply to disputes arising out of the contractual relationship.
Thus, if a similar contract, without a choice-of-law provision,
had been signed in New York and was to be performed in
New York, presumably "the laws of the State of New York"
would apply, even though the contract did not expressly so
state. In such event, there would be nothing in the contract
that could possibly constitute evidence of an intent to exclude
punitive damages claims. Accordingly, punitive damages
would be allowed because, in the absence of contractual intent to the contrary, the FAA would pre-empt the Garrity
rule. See supra, at 58, and n. 8, infra.

Even if the reference to "the laws of the State of New
York" is more than a substitute for ordinary conflict-of-laws
analysis and, as respondents urge, includes the caveat, "detached from otherwise-applicable federal law," the provision
might not preclude the award of punitive damages because
New York allows its courts, though not its arbitrators, to
enter such awards. See Garrity, 40 N. Y. 2d, at 358, 353

60 MASTROBUONO v. SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON, INC.

Opinion of the Court
N. E. 2d, at 796. In other words, the provision might includeonly New York's substantive rights and obligations, and not

the State's allocation of power between alternative tribu-nals.

3 Respondents' argument is persuasive only if "New

York law" means "New York decisional law, including thatState's allocation of power between courts and arbitrators,

notwithstanding otherwise-applicable federal law." But, aswe have demonstrated, the provision need not be read so
broadly. It is not, in itself, an unequivocal exclusion of puni-tive damages claims.

4

The arbitration provision (the second sentence of para-graph 13) does not improve respondents' argument. On the

contrary, when read separately this clause strongly impliesthat an arbitral award of punitive damages is appropriate.
It explicitly authorizes arbitration in accordance with NASDrules;

5 the panel of arbitrators in fact proceeded under that

3 In a related point, respondents argue that there is no meaningful
distinction between "substance" and "remedy," that is, between an entitlement to prevail on the law and an entitlement to a specific form of
damages. See Brief for Respondents 25-27. We do not rely on such
a distinction here, nor do we pass upon its persuasiveness.

4 The dissent makes much of the similarity between this choice-of-law

clause and the one in Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees
of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468 (1989), which we took to
incorporate a California statute allowing a court to stay arbitration pending resolution of related litigation. In Volt, however, we did not interpret
the contract de novo. Instead, we deferred to the California court's construction of its own State's law. Id., at 474 ("[T]he interpretation of private contracts is ordinarily a question of state law, which this Court does
not sit to review"). In the present case, by contrast, we review a federal
court's interpretation of this contract, and our interpretation accords with
that of the only decisionmaker arguably entitled to deference--the arbitrator. See n. 1, supra.

5 The contract also authorizes (at petitioners' election) that the arbitration be governed by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange or the
American Stock Exchange, instead of those of the NASD. App. to Pet. for
Cert. 44. Neither set of alternative rules purports to limit an arbitrator's
discretion to award punitive damages. Moreover, even if there were any
doubt as to the ability of an arbitrator to award punitive damages under

Opinion of the Court
set of rules.6 The NASD's Code of Arbitration Procedureindicates that arbitrators may award "damages and other relief." NASD Code of Arbitration Procedure || 3741(e) (1993).While not a clear authorization of punitive damages, this provision appears broad enough at least to contemplate such aremedy. Moreover, as the Seventh Circuit noted, a manual
provided to NASD arbitrators contains this provision:

"B. Punitive Damages
"The issue of punitive damages may arise with greatfrequency in arbitrations. Parties to arbitration are informed that arbitrators can consider punitive damagesas a remedy." 20 F. 3d, at 717.

Thus, the text of the arbitration clause itself surely does notsupport--indeed, it contradicts--the conclusion that the parties agreed to foreclose claims for punitive damages.7
the Exchanges' rules, the contract expressly allows petitioners, the claimants in this case, to choose NASD rules; and the panel of arbitrators in
this case in fact proceeded under NASD rules.

6 As the Solicitor General reminds us, one NASD rule is not before us,

namely Rule 21(f)(4) of the NASD Rules of Fair Practice, which reads:
" `No agreement [between a member and a customer] shall include any
condition which . . . limits the ability of a party to file any claim in arbitration or limits the ability of the arbitrators to make any award.' " Brief
for United States et al. 6.

Rule 21(f)(4) applies only to contracts executed after September 7, 1989.
Notwithstanding any effect it may have on agreements signed after that
date, this rule is not applicable to the agreement in this case, which was
executed in 1985.

7 "Were we to confine our analysis to the plain language of the arbitration clause, we would have little trouble concluding that a contract clause
which bound the parties to `settle' `all disputes' through arbitration conducted according to rules which allow any form of `just and equitable'
`remedy of relief' was sufficiently broad to encompass the award of punitive damages. Inasmuch as agreements to arbitrate are `generously construed,' Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, [Inc., 473
U. S. 614, 626 (1985)], it would seem sensible to interpret the `all disputes'
and `any remedy or relief ' phrases to indicate, at a minimum, an intention
to resolve through arbitration any dispute that would otherwise be settled

62 MASTROBUONO v. SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON, INC.

Opinion of the Court
Although neither the choice-of-law clause nor the arbitration clause, separately considered, expresses an intent to
preclude an award of punitive damages, respondents argue
that a fair reading of the entire paragraph 13 leads to that
conclusion. On this theory, even if "New York law" is ambiguous, and even if "arbitration in accordance with NASD
rules" indicates that punitive damages are permissible, the
juxtaposition of the two clauses suggests that the contract
incorporates "New York law relating to arbitration." We
disagree. At most, the choice-of-law clause introduces an
ambiguity into an arbitration agreement that would otherwise allow punitive damages awards. As we pointed out in
Volt, when a court interprets such provisions in an agreement covered by the FAA, "due regard must be given to the
federal policy favoring arbitration, and ambiguities as to the
scope of the arbitration clause itself resolved in favor of arbitration." 489 U. S., at 476. See also Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 24-25
(1983).8

Moreover, respondents cannot overcome the common-law
rule of contract interpretation that a court should construe
ambiguous language against the interest of the party that
drafted it. See, e. g., United States Fire Ins. Co. v. Schnackenberg, 88 Ill. 2d 1, 4, 429 N. E. 2d 1203, 1205 (1981); Graff
v. Billet, 64 N. Y. 2d 899, 902, 477 N. E. 2d 212, 213-214

in a court, and to allow the chosen dispute resolvers to award the same
varieties and forms of damages or relief as a court would be empowered
to award. Since courts are empowered to award punitive damages with
respect to certain types of claims, the Raytheon-Automated arbitrators
would be equally empowered." Raytheon Co. v. Automated Business
Systems, Inc., 882 F. 2d 6, 10 (CA1 1989).

8 "The Arbitration Act establishes that, as a matter of federal law, any

doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in
favor of arbitration, whether the problem at hand is the construction of
the contract language itself or an allegation of waiver, delay, or a like
defense to arbitrability." Moses H. Cone, 460 U. S., at 24-25.

Opinion of the Court
(1984); 9 Restatement (Second) of Contracts $ 206; United
States v. Seckinger, 397 U. S. 203, 210 (1970). Respondents
drafted an ambiguous document, and they cannot now claimthe benefit of the doubt. The reason for this rule is to protect the party who did not choose the language from an unintended or unfair result.10 That rationale is well suited tothe facts of this case. As a practical matter, it seems unlikely that petitioners were actually aware of New York'sbifurcated approach to punitive damages, or that they had
any idea that by signing a standard-form agreement to arbi-trate disputes they might be giving up an important substantive right. In the face of such doubt, we are unwilling toimpute this intent to petitioners.

Finally respondents' reading of the two clauses violatesanother cardinal principle of contract construction: that a
document should be read to give effect to all its provisions
and to render them consistent with each other. See, e. g., In
re Halas, 104 Ill. 2d 83, 92, 470 N. E. 2d 960, 964 (1984);
Crimmins Contracting Co. v. City of New York, 74 N. Y. 2d

$ 202(5). We think the best way to harmonize the choice-of9 We cite precedent from Illinois, the forum State and place where the
contract was executed, and New York, the State designated in the contract's choice-of-law clause. The parties suggest no other State's law as
arguably relevant to this controversy.

10 The drafters of the Second Restatement justified the rule as follows:

"Where one party chooses the terms of a contract, he is likely to provide
more carefully for the protection of his own interests than for those of the
other party. He is also more likely than the other party to have reason
to know of uncertainties of meaning. Indeed, he may leave meaning deliberately obscure, intending to decide at a later date what meaning to
assert. In cases of doubt, therefore, so long as other factors are not decisive, there is substantial reason for preferring the meaning of the other
party." Restatement (Second) of Contracts $ 206, Comment a (1979).

law provision with the arbitration provision is to read "thelaws of the State of New York" to encompass substantive

principles that New York courts would apply, but not toinclude special rules limiting the authority of arbitrators.
Thus, the choice-of-law provision covers the rights and dutiesof the parties, while the arbitration clause covers arbitration;
neither sentence intrudes upon the other. In contrast, re-spondents' reading sets up the two clauses in conflict with
one another: one foreclosing punitive damages, the otherallowing them. This interpretation is untenable.

We hold that the Court of Appeals misinterpreted theparties' agreement. The arbitral award should have been
enforced as within the scope of the contract. The judgmentof the Court of Appeals is, therefore, reversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Thomas, dissenting.
In Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees ofLeland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 478 (1989), we

held that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) simply requirescourts to enforce private contracts to arbitrate as they would
normal contracts--according to their terms. This holdingled us to enforce a choice-of-law provision that incorporated
a state procedural rule concerning arbitration proceedings.Because the choice-of-law provision here cannot reasonably
be distinguished from the one in Volt, I dissent.1

1 The Seventh Circuit adopted a de novo standard of review of the arbitrators' decision. Although we have not yet decided what standard of
review to apply in cases of this sort, see First Options of Chicago, Inc. v.
Kaplan, cert. granted, 513 U. S. 1040 (1994), petitioners waived the argument that a deferential standard was appropriate. Petitioners did not
raise the argument in their petition for certiorari or in their opening brief.
While the standard of review may be an antecedent question, see United
States Nat. Bank of Ore. v. Independent Ins. Agents of America, Inc., 508
U. S. 439 (1993), given petitioners' waiver of the argument it seems more
appropriate to resolve the question in First Options than here.

I
A

In Volt, Stanford University had entered into a construction contract under which Volt Information Sciences, Inc.,
was to install certain electrical systems on the Stanford campus. The contract contained an agreement to arbitrate all
disputes arising out of the contract. A choice-of-law clause
in the contract provided that "[t]he Contract shall be governed by the law of the place where the Project is located,"
id., at 470 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted),
which happened to be California. When a dispute arose regarding compensation, Volt invoked arbitration. Stanford
filed an action in state court, however, and moved to stay
arbitration pursuant to California Rules of Civil Procedure.
Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. $ 1281.2(c) (West 1982). Opposing
the stay, Volt argued that the relevant state statute authorizing the stay was pre-empted by the FAA, 9 U. S. C. $ 1
et seq.

We concluded that even if the FAA pre-empted the state
statute as applied to other parties, the choice-of-law clause
in the contract at issue demonstrated that the parties had
agreed to be governed by the statute. Rejecting Volt's position that the FAA imposes a proarbitration policy that precluded enforcement of the statute permitting the California
courts to stay the arbitration proceedings, we concluded that
the Act "simply requires courts to enforce privately negotiated agreements to arbitrate, like other contracts, in accordance with their terms." 489 U. S., at 478. As a result, we
interpreted the choice-of-law clause "to make applicable
state rules governing the conduct of arbitration," id., at 476,
even if a specific rule itself hampers or delays arbitration.
We rejected the argument that the choice-of-law clause was
to be construed as incorporating only substantive law, and
dismissed the claim that the FAA pre-empted those contract
provisions that might hinder arbitration.

We so held in Volt because we concluded that the FAAdoes not force arbitration on parties who enter into contracts

involving interstate commerce. Instead, the FAA requiresonly that "arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in
[the parties'] agreement." 9 U. S. C. $ 4. Although we willconstrue ambiguities concerning the scope of arbitrability in
favor of arbitration, see Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospitalv.

Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 24-25 (1983), we re-main mindful that "as with any other contract, the parties'

intentions control," Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. SolerChrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 626 (1985). Thus, if
the parties intend that state procedure shall govern, federalcourts must enforce that understanding. "There is no federal policy favoring arbitration under a certain set of proce-dural rules; the federal policy is simply to ensure the enforceability, according to their terms, of private agreementsto arbitrate."

Volt, 489 U. S., at 476.

B
In this case, as in Volt, the parties agreed to mandatoryarbitration of all disputes. As in

Volt, the contract at issuehere includes a choice-of-law clause. Indeed, the language

of the two clauses is functionally equivalent: Whereas thechoice-of-law clause in

Volt provided that "[t]he Contractshall be governed by the law of [the State of California]," id.,

at 470 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), theone before us today states, in paragraph 13 of the Client's
Agreement, App. to Pet. for Cert. 44, that "[t]his agreement. . . shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York."
New York law prohibits arbitrators from awarding punitivedamages,

Garrity v. Lyle Stuart, Inc., 40 N. Y. 2d 354, 353N. E. 2d 793 (1976), and permits only courts to award such

damages. As in Volt, petitioners here argue that the NewYork rule is "antiarbitration," and hence is pre-empted by
the FAA. In concluding that the choice-of-law clause is am514us1$32N 06-11-98 18:14:25 PAGES OPINPGT

67Cite as: 514 U. S. 52 (1995)
Thomas, J., dissenting
biguous, the majority essentially accepts petitioners' argu-ment.

Volt itself found precisely the same argument irrelevant, however, and the majority identifies no reason to thinkthat the state law governing the interpretation of the parties' choice-of-law clause supports a different result.

The majority claims that the incorporation of New Yorklaw "need not be read so broadly" as to include both substantive and procedural law, and that the choice of New York law"is not, in itself, an unequivocal exclusion of punitive damages claims." Ante, at 60. But we rejected these same ar-guments in

Volt, and the Garrity rule is just the sort of
"state rul[e] governing the conduct of arbitration" that Voltrequires federal courts to enforce. 489 U. S., at 476. "Just

as [the parties] may limit by contract the issues which they
will arbitrate, so too may they specify by contract the rulesunder which that arbitration will be conducted."

Id., at 479
(citation omitted). To be sure, the majority might be correctthat

Garrity is a rule concerning the State's allocation of
power between "alternative tribunals," ante, at 60, although
Garrity appears to describe itself as substantive New York
law.2 Nonetheless, Volt makes no distinction between rulesthat serve only to distribute authority between courts and

arbitrators (which the majority finds unenforceable) andother types of rules (which the majority finds enforceable).
Indeed, the California rule in Volt could be considered to beone that allocates authority between arbitrators and courts,
for it permits California courts to stay arbitration pending resolution of related litigation. See Volt, supra, at
471.

2 The New York Court of Appeals rested its holding on the principle
that punitive damages are exemplary social remedies intended to punish,
rather than to compensate. Because the power to punish can rest only in
the hands of the State, the court found that private arbitrators could not
wield the authority to impose such damages. Garrity v. Lyle Stuart, Inc.,
40 N. Y. 2d, at 360, 353 N. E. 2d, at 796-797.

II
The majority relies upon two assertions to defend its departure from Volt. First, it contends that "[a]t most, the
choice-of-law clause introduces an ambiguity into an arbitration agreement." Ante, at 62. We are told that the agreement "would otherwise allow punitive damages awards,"
ibid., because of paragraph 13's statement that arbitration
would be conducted "in accordance with the rules then in
effect, of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
[NASD]." App. to Pet. for Cert. 44. It is unclear which
NASD "rules" the parties mean, although I am willing to
agree with the majority that the phrase refers to the NASD
Code of Arbitration Procedure. But the provision of the
NASD Code offered by the majority simply does not speak
to the availability of punitive damages. It only states:

"The award shall contain the names of the parties, the
name of counsel, if any, a summary of the issues, including the type(s) of any security or product, in controversy, the damages and other relief requested, the damages and other relief awarded, a statement of any other
issues resolved, the names of the arbitrators, the dates
the claim was filed and the award rendered, the number
and dates of hearing sessions, the location of the hearings, and the signatures of the arbitrators concurring
in the award." NASD Code of Arbitration Procedure

$ 41(e) (1985).

It is clear that $ 41(e) does not define or limit the powers
of the arbitrators; it merely describes the form in which the
arbitrators must announce their decision. The other provisions of $ 41 confirm this point. See, e. g., $ 41(a) ("All
awards shall be in writing and signed by a majority of the
arbitrators . . ."); $ 41(c) ("Director of Arbitration shall endeavor to serve a copy of the award" to the parties); $ 41(d)
(arbitrators should render an award within 30 days); $ 41(f )

(awards shall be "publicly available"). The majority cannotfind a provision of the NASD Code that specifically addresses punitive damages, or that speaks more generally tothe types of damages arbitrators may or may not allow.
Such a rule simply does not exist. The code certainly does
not require that arbitrators be empowered to award punitivedamages; it leaves to the parties to define the arbitrators'

remedial powers.The majority also purports to find a clear expression of the
parties' agreement on the availability of punitive damages in"a manual provided to NASD arbitrators."

Ante, at 61.
But paragraph 13 of the Client's Agreement nowhere mentions this manual; it mentions only "the rules then in effect,
of the [NASD]." App. to Pet. for Cert. 44. The manual
does not fit either part of this description: it is neither "of
the [NASD]," nor a set of "rules."

First, the manual apparently is not an official NASD document. The manual was not promulgated or adopted by the
NASD. Instead, it apparently was compiled by members of
the Securities Industry Conference on Arbitration (SICA) as
a supplement to the Uniform Code of Arbitration, which the
parties clearly did not adopt in paragraph 13. Petitioners
present no evidence that the NASD has a policy of giving
this specific manual to its arbitrators. Nor do petitioners
assert that this manual was even used in the arbitration that
gave rise to this case. More importantly, there is no indication in the text of the Client's Agreement that the parties
intended this manual to be used by the arbitrators.

Second, the manual does not provide any "rules" in the
sense contemplated by paragraph 13; instead, it provides
general information and advice to the arbitrator, such as
"Hints for the Chair." SICA, Arbitrator's Manual 21 (1992).
The manual is nothing more than a sort of "how to" guide
for the arbitrator. One bit of advice, for example, states:
"Care should be exercised, particularly when questioning a
witness, so that the arbitrator does not indicate disbelief.

Grimaces, frowns, or hand signals should all be avoided. A`poker' face is the goal." Id., at 19.

3

Even if the parties had intended to adopt the manual, itcannot be read to resolve the issue of punitive damages.

When read in context, the portion of the SICA manual uponwhich the majority relies seems only to explain what punitive damages are, not to establish whether arbitrators havethe authority to award them:

"The issue of punitive damages may arise with greatfrequency in arbitrations. Parties to arbitration are
informed that arbitrators can consider punitive damagesas a remedy. Generally, in court proceedings, punitive
damages consist of compensation in excess of actualdamages and are awarded as a form of punishment
against the wrongdoer. If punitive damages areawarded, the decision of the arbitrators should clearly
specify what portion of the award is intended as punitivedamages, and the arbitrators should consider referring
to the authority on which they relied." Id., at 26-27.
A glance at neighboring passages, which explain the purposeof "Compensatory/Actual Damages," "Injunctive Relief,"

"Interest," "Attorneys' Fees," and "Forum Fees," see id., at26-29, confirms that the SICA manual does not even attempt
to provide a standardized set of procedural rules.Even if one made the stretch of reading the passage on
punitive damages to relate to an NASD arbitrator's author-ity, the SICA manual limits its own applicability in the situa3 Other "rules" include: "The Chair should maintain decorum at all
times. Shouting, profanity, or gratuitous remarks should be stopped."
SICA, Arbitrator's Manual 20. "Some attorneys think that the more
often a statement is made, the truer it becomes. The Chair, however,
should discourage needless repetition." Ibid. "Immediately after the
close of the hearing, the arbitrators usually remain in the hearing room
either to begin deliberations or set a date for deliberation. Unlike jurors,
the panel members are not restricted from discussing the case among
themselves." Id., at 25.

tion presented by this case. According to the manual's Codeof Ethics for Arbitrators, "[w]hen an arbitrator's authority is

derived from an agreement of the parties, the arbitratorshould neither exceed that authority nor do less than is required to exercise that authority completely." Id., at 38.Regarding procedural rules, the code states that "[w]here
the agreement of the parties sets forth procedures to be fol-lowed in conducting the arbitration or refers to rules to be
followed, it is the obligation of the arbitrator to comply withsuch procedures or rules."

Id., at 38-39. The manualclearly contemplates that the parties' agreement will define

the powers and authorities of the arbitrator. Thus, we aredirected back to the rest of paragraph 13 and the intent of
the parties, whose only expression on the issue is their deci-sion to incorporate the laws of New York.

4

My examination of the Client's Agreement, the choice-of-law provision, the NASD Code of Procedure, and the SICA

manual demonstrates that the parties made their intentclear, but not in the way divined by the majority. New York
law specifically precludes arbitrators from awarding punitivedamages, and it should be clear that there is no "conflict," as
the majority puts it, between the New York law and theNASD rules. The choice-of-law provision speaks directly to
the issue, while the NASD Code is silent. Giving effect toevery provision of the contract requires us to honor the parties' intent, as indicated in the text of the agreement, to pre-clude the award of punitive damages by arbitrators.

III
Thankfully, the import of the majority's decision is limitedand narrow. This case amounts to nothing more than a fed4 It is telling that petitioners did not even claim until their reply brief
that paragraph 13 expressed an intent to reserve to arbitrators the authority to award punitive damages. Instead, petitioners consistently have argued only that the agreement did not constitute a "waiver" of their "right"
to obtain punitive damages.

eral court applying Illinois and New York contract law to anagreement between parties in Illinois. Much like a federal

Syllabus

CURTISS-WRIGHT CORP. v. SCHOONEJONGEN et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 93-1935. Argued January 17, 1995--Decided March 6, 1995
Petitioner Curtiss-Wright Corp. amended its employee benefit plan to provide that the postretirement health care coverage it had maintained for
many years would cease for retirees upon the termination of business
operations in the facility from which they retired. In ruling for respondent retirees in their ensuing suit, the District Court found, among
other things, that the new provision constituted an "amendment" to the
plan; that the plan documents nowhere contained a valid "procedure for
amending [the] plan, and for identifying the persons who have authority
to amend the plan," as required by $ 402(b)(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA); and that the proper remedy
for this violation was to declare the provision void ab initio. The Court
of Appeals affirmed, holding that the standard reservation clause contained in Curtiss-Wright's plan constitution--which states that "[t]he
Company reserves the right . . . to modify or amend" the plan--is too
vague to be an amendment procedure under $ 402(b)(3).

Held:

1. Curtiss-Wright's reservation clause sets forth a valid amendment
procedure. Pp. 78-86.

(a) The clause satisfies the plain text of $ 402(b)(3)'s two requirements. Since ERISA's general definitions section makes quite clear
that the term "person," wherever it appears in the statute, includes
companies, the clause appears to satisfy $ 402(b)(3)'s identification requirement by naming "[t]he Company" as "the perso[n]" with amendment authority. This outright identification necessarily indicates a procedure for identifying the person as well, since the plan, in effect, says
that the procedure is to look always to the company rather than to any
other party. The reservation clause also contains a "procedure for
amending [the] plan." Section 402(b)(3) requires only that there be an
amendment procedure, and its literal terms are indifferent to the procedure's level of detail. As commonly understood, a procedure is a "particular way" of doing something, and a plan that says in effect it may
be amended only by "[t]he Company" adequately sets forth a particular
way of making an amendment. Principles of corporate law provide a
ready-made set of rules for deciding who has authority to act on behalf
of the company. But to read $ 402(b)(3) as requiring a plan to specify

514us1$33z 05-29-98 14:51:51 PAGES OPINPGT
74 CURTISS-WRIGHT CORP. v. SCHOONEJONGEN

Syllabus
on its face who has authority to act on the company's behalf might lead
to the invalidation of myriad amendment procedures that no one would
think violate the statute. Pp. 78-81.

(b) There is no support for respondents' argument that Congress
intended amendment procedures to convey enough detail to serve beneficiaries' interest in knowing their plans' terms. Section 402(b)(3)'s primary purpose is to ensure that every plan has a workable amendment
procedure, while ERISA's goal of enabling plan beneficiaries to learn
their rights and obligations under the plan at any time is served by an
elaborate scheme, detailed elsewhere in the statute, which specifies that
a plan must be written, meet certain reporting and disclosure requirements, and be made available for inspection at the plan administrator's
office. Pp. 81-85.

2. On remand, the Court of Appeals must decide whether CurtissWright's valid amendment procedure was complied with in this case.
The answer will depend on a fact-intensive inquiry, under applicable
corporate law principles, into who at Curtiss-Wright had plan amendment authority and whether they approved the new provision. If the
new provision was not properly authorized when issued, the question
would arise whether any subsequent actions served to ratify it ex post.
Pp. 85-86.

Opinion of the Court
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
Section 402(b)(3) of the Employee Retirement IncomeSecurity Act of 1974 (ERISA), 88 Stat. 875, 29 U. S. C.

$ 1102(b)(3), requires that every employee benefit plan pro-vide "a procedure for amending such plan, and for identifying
the persons who have authority to amend the plan." Thiscase presents the question whether the standard provision
in many employer-provided benefit plans stating that "TheCompany reserves the right at any time to amend the plan"
sets forth an amendment procedure that satisfies $ 402(b)(3).We hold that it does.

I
For many years, petitioner Curtiss-Wright voluntarilymaintained a postretirement health plan for employees who

had worked at certain Curtiss-Wright facilities; respondentsare retirees who had worked at one such facility in WoodRidge, New Jersey. The specific terms of the plan, the Dis-trict Court determined, could be principally found in two
plan documents: the plan constitution and the Summary PlanDescription (SPD), both of which primarily covered active
employee health benefits.In early 1983, presumably due to the rising cost of health
care, a revised SPD was issued with the following newprovision: "TERMINATION OF HEALTH CARE BENEFITS . . . . Coverage under this Plan will cease for retireesand their dependents upon the termination of business
operations of the facility from which they retired." App.49. The two main authors of the new SPD provision,

76 CURTISS-WRIGHT CORP. v. SCHOONEJONGEN

Opinion of the Court
testified that they did not think the provision effected a"change" in the plan, but rather merely clarified it.

Id.,
at 70-71, 79. Probably for this reason, the record is lessthan clear as to which Curtiss-Wright officers or committees

had authority to make plan amendments on behalf of the
company and whether such officers or committees approvedor ratified the new SPD provision. In any event, later

that year, Curtiss-Wright announced that the Wood-Ridgefacility would close. Shortly thereafter, an executive vice
president wrote respondents a series of letters informingthem that their post-retirement health benefits were being
terminated.

Respondents brought suit in federal court over the termination of their benefits, and many years of litigation ensued.
The District Court ultimately rejected most of respondents'
claims, including their contention that Curtiss-Wright had
bound itself contractually to provide health benefits to them
for life. The District Court agreed, however, that the new
SPD provision effected a significant change in the plan's
terms and thus constituted an "amendment" to the plan; that
the plan documents nowhere contained a valid amendment
procedure, as required by $ 402(b)(3); and that the proper
remedy for the $ 402(b)(3) violation was to declare the new
SPD provision void ab initio. The court eventually ordered Curtiss-Wright to pay respondents $2,681,086 in back
benefits.

On appeal, Curtiss-Wright primarily argued that the plan
documents did contain an amendment procedure, namely, the
standard reservation clause contained in the plan constitution and in a few secondary plan documents. The clause
states: "The Company reserves the right at any time and
from time to time to modify or amend, in whole or in part,
any or all of the provisions of the Plan." App. 37; see also
2 RIA Pension Coordinator || 13,181, p. 13,276R-124 (1994)
(reproducing IRS' prototype employee benefits plan, which
contains similar language). In Curtiss-Wright's view, this

Opinion of the Court
clause sets forth an amendment procedure as required by thestatute. It says, in effect, that the plan is to be amended

by
"[t]he Company."The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit rejected this

argument, as well as all other arguments before it, and affirmed the District Court's remedy. See 18 F. 3d 1034(1994). It explained: "A primary purpose of $ 402(b)(3) is to

ensure that all interested parties [including beneficiaries]will know how a plan may be altered and who may make
such alterations. Only if they know this information willthey be able to determine with certainty at any given time
exactly what the plan provides." Id., at 1038. And the
court suggested that $ 402(b)(3) cannot serve that purpose
unless it is read to require that every amendment procedure
specify precisely "what individuals or bodies within the Company c[an] promulgate an effective amendment." Id., at
1039. In the court's view, then, a reservation clause that
says that the plan may be amended "by the Company," without more, is too vague. In so holding, the court distinguished a case, Huber v. Casablanca Industries, Inc., 916
F. 2d 85 (1990), in which it had upheld a reservation clause
that said, in effect, that the plan may be amended "by the
Trustees." "By the trustees," the court reasoned, had a
very particular meaning in Huber; it meant "by resolutio[n]
at a regularly constituted board [of trustees] meeting in
accordance with the established process of the trustees."
18 F. 3d, at 1039 (citation omitted).

In a footnote, the court related the concurring views of
Judge Roth. Id., at 1039, n. 3. According to the court,
Judge Roth thought that the notion of an amendment
"by the Company" should be read in light of traditional corporate law principles, which is to say amendment "by the
board of directors or whomever of the company has the
authority to take such action." Ibid. And read in this
more specific way, "by the Company" indicates a valid
amendment procedure that satisfies $ 402(b)(3). She con514us1$33J 05-29-98 14:51:51 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
curred rather than dissented, however, because, in thecourt's words, "neither [Curtiss-Wright's] board nor any

other person or entity within [Curtiss-Wright] with thepower to act on behalf of `the Company' ratified [the new
SPD provision]." Ibid.Curtiss-Wright petitioned for certiorari on the questions
whether a plan provision stating that "[t]he Company" re-serves the right to amend the plan states a valid amendment
procedure under $ 402(b)(3) and, if not, whether the properremedy is to declare this or any other amendment void
ab initio. We granted certiorari on both. 512 U. S. 1288(1994).

II
In interpreting $ 402(b)(3), we are mindful that ERISAdoes not create any substantive entitlement to employerprovided health benefits or any other kind of welfare bene-fits. Employers or other plan sponsors are generally free
under ERISA, for any reason at any time, to adopt, modify,or terminate welfare plans. See

Adams v. Avondale Indus-tries, Inc., 905 F. 2d 943, 947 (CA6 1990) ("[A] company does

not act in a fiduciary capacity when deciding to amend orterminate a welfare benefits plan"). Nor does ERISA establish any minimum participation, vesting, or funding re-quirements for welfare plans as it does for pension plans.
See Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S. 85, 90-91 (1983).Accordingly, that Curtiss-Wright amended its plan to deprive respondents of health benefits is not a cognizable com-plaint under ERISA; the only cognizable claim is that the
company did not do so in a permissible manner.

A
The text of $ 402(b)(3) actually requires two things: a "pro-cedure for amending [the] plan"

and "[a procedure] for identi-fying the persons who have authority to amend the plan."

With respect to the second requirement, the general "Defi-nitions" section of ERISA makes quite clear that the term

514us1$33J 05-29-98 14:51:51 PAGES OPINPGT

79Cite as: 514 U. S. 73 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
"person," wherever it appears in the statute, includes compa-nies. See 29 U. S. C. $ 1002(9) ("The term `person' means an

individual, partnership, joint venture, corporation, mutualcompany, joint-stock company, trust, estate, unincorporated
organization, association, or employee organization"). The
Curtiss-Wright reservation clause thus appears to satisfy thestatute's identification requirement by naming "[t]he Company" as "the perso[n]" with amendment authority.The text of $ 402(b)(3) speaks, somewhat awkwardly, of requiring a procedure for identifying the persons with amend-ment authority, rather than requiring identification of those
persons outright. Be that as it may, a plan that simply identifies the persons outright necessarily indicates a procedure
for identifying the persons as well. With respect to the
Curtiss-Wright plan, for example, to identify "[t]he Company" as the person with amendment authority is to say, in
effect, that the procedure for identifying the person with
amendment authority is to look always to "[t]he Company."
Such an identification procedure is more substantial than
might first appear. To say that one must look always to
"[t]he Company" is to say that one must look only to "[t]he
Company" and not to any other person--that is, not to any
union, not to any third-party trustee, and not to any of the
other kinds of outside parties that, in many other plans, exercise amendment authority.

The more difficult question in this case is whether the
Curtiss-Wright reservation clause contains a "procedure for
amending [the] plan." To recall, the reservation clause says
in effect that the plan may be amended "by the Company."
Curtiss-Wright is correct, we think, that this states an
amendment procedure and one that, like the identification
procedure, is more substantial than might first appear. It
says the plan may be amended by a unilateral company decision to amend, and only by such a decision--and not, for example, by the unilateral decision of a third-party trustee or
upon the approval of the union. Moreover, to the extent

80 CURTISS-WRIGHT CORP. v. SCHOONEJONGEN

Opinion of the Court
that this procedure is the barest of procedures, that is be-cause the Curtiss-Wright plan is the simplest of plans: a voluntarily maintained single-employer health plan that is ad-ministered by the employer and funded by the employer.
More complicated plans, such as multiemployer plans,
may have more complicated amendment procedures, and$ 402(b)(3) was designed to cover them as well.

In any event, the literal terms of $ 402(b)(3) are ultimatelyindifferent to the level of detail in an amendment procedure,
or in an identification procedure for that matter. The pro-vision requires only that there

be an amendment procedure,
which here there is. A "procedure," as that term is
commonly understood, is a "particular way" of doing something, Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1807
(1976), or "a manner of proceeding," Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1542 (2d ed. 1987). Certainly a plan that says it may be amended only by a unilateral
company decision adequately sets forth "a particular way"
of making an amendment. Adequately, that is, with one
refinement.

In order for an amendment procedure that says the plan
may be amended by "[t]he Company" to make any sense,
there must be some way of determining what it means for

amend. Restatement (Second) of Trusts $ 331, Comment c
(1957). After all, only natural persons are capable of making decisions. As Judge Roth suggested, however, principles of corporate law provide a ready-made set of rules for
determining, in whatever context, who has authority to make
decisions on behalf of a company. Consider, for example, an
ordinary sales contract between "Company X" and a third
party. We would not think of regarding the contract as
meaningless, and thus unenforceable, simply because it does
not specify on its face exactly who within "Company X" has
the power to enter into such an agreement or carry out its

Opinion of the Court
terms. Rather, we would look to corporate law principlesto give "Company X" content. See 2 W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of Law of Private Corporations $ 466, p. 505 (rev. ed.1990) ("[A] corporation is bound by contracts entered into by
its officers and agents acting on behalf of the corporation andfor its benefit, provided they act within the scope of their
express or implied powers"). So too here.In the end, perhaps the strongest argument for a textual
reading of $ 402(b)(3) is that to read it to require specificationof individuals or bodies within a company would lead to improbable results. That is, it might lead to the invalidationof myriad amendment procedures that no one would think
violate $ 402(b)(3), especially those in multiemployer plans--which, as we said, $ 402(b)(3) covers as well. For example,
imagine a multiemployer plan that says "This Plan may beamended at any time by written agreement of two-thirds of
the participating Companies, subject to the approval of theplan Trustees." This would seem to be a fairly robust
amendment procedure, and we can imagine numerous vari-ants of it. Yet, because our hypothetical procedure does not
specify who within any of "the participating Companies" hasauthority to enter into such an amendment agreement (let
alone what counts as the "approval of the plan Trustees"),respondents would say it is insufficiently specific to pass
muster under $ 402(b)(3). Congress could not have intendedsuch a result.

B
Curtiss-Wright's reservation clause thus satisfies the plaintext of both requirements in $ 402(b)(3). Respondents nonetheless argue that, in drafting $ 402(b)(3), Congress intendedamendment procedures to convey enough detail to serve beneficiaries' interest in knowing the terms of their plans. Or-dinarily, we would be reluctant to indulge an argument based
on legislative purpose where the text alone yields a clearanswer, but we do so here because it is the argument the
Court of Appeals found persuasive.

82 CURTISS-WRIGHT CORP. v. SCHOONEJONGEN

Opinion of the Court
Section 402(b)(3)'s primary purpose is obviously functional:to ensure that every plan

has a workable amendment procedure. This is clear from not only the face of the provisionbut also its placement in $ 402(b), which lays out the requisite

functional features of ERISA plans. 29 U. S. C. $ 1102(b)
(every ERISA plan shall have, in addition to an amendmentprocedure, "a procedure for establishing and carrying out a

funding policy and method," "[a] procedure under the planfor the allocation of responsibilities for the operation and administration of the plan," and "[a] basis on which paymentsare made to and from the plan").

Requiring every plan to have a coherent amendment procedure serves several laudable goals. First, for a plan not to
have such a procedure would risk rendering the plan forever
unamendable under standard trust law principles. See
Restatement (Second) of Trusts, supra, $ 331(2). Second,
such a requirement increases the likelihood that proposed
plan amendments, which are fairly serious events, are recognized as such and given the special consideration they deserve. Finally, having an amendment procedure enables
plan administrators, the people who manage the plan on a
day-to-day level, to have a mechanism for sorting out, from
among the occasional corporate communications that pass
through their offices and that conflict with the existing plan
terms, the bona fide amendments from those that are not.
In fact, plan administrators may have a statutory responsibility to do this sorting out. See 29 U. S. C. $ 1104(a)(1)(D)
(plan administrators have a duty to run the plan "in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan
insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent
with the provisions of [the statute]," which would include the
amendment procedure provision). That Congress may have
had plan administrators in mind is suggested by the fact
that $ 402(b)(3), and $ 402(b) more generally, is located in
the "fiduciary responsibility" section of ERISA. See 29
U. S. C. $$ 1101-1114.

83Cite as: 514 U. S. 73 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
Respondents argue that $ 402(b)(3) was intended not onlyto ensure that every plan has an amendment procedure, but

also to guarantee that the procedure conveys enough detailto enable beneficiaries to learn their rights and obligations
under the plan at any time. Respondents are no doubt right
that one of ERISA's central goals is to enable plan benefici-aries to learn their rights and obligations at any time. But

ERISA already has an elaborate scheme in place for en-abling beneficiaries to learn their rights and obligations at
any time, a scheme that is built around reliance on the faceof written plan documents.

The basis of that scheme is another of ERISA's core functional requirements, that "[e]very employee benefit plan
shall be established and maintained pursuant to a written
instrument." 29 U. S. C. $ 1102(a)(1) (emphasis added). In
the words of the key congressional report, "[a] written plan
is to be required in order that every employee may, on examining the plan documents, determine exactly what his rights
and obligations are under the plan." H. R. Rep. No. 93-
1280, p. 297 (1974) (emphasis added). ERISA gives effect to
this "written plan documents" scheme through a comprehensive set of "reporting and disclosure" requirements, see 29
U. S. C. $$ 1021-1031, of which $ 402(b)(3) is not part. One
provision, for example, requires that plan administrators
periodically furnish beneficiaries with a Summary Plan
Description, see 29 U. S. C. $ 1024(b)(1), the purpose being to
communicate to beneficiaries the essential information about
the plan. Not surprisingly, the information that every SPD
must contain includes the "name and address" of plan administrators and other plan fiduciaries, but not the names and
addresses of those individuals with amendment authority.

$ 1022(b). The same provision also requires that plan administrators furnish beneficiaries with summaries of new
amendments no later than 210 days after the end of the plan
year in which the amendment is adopted. See $ 1024(b)(1).
Under ERISA, both Summary Plan Descriptions and plan

514us1$33J 05-29-98 14:51:51 PAGES OPINPGT
84 CURTISS-WRIGHT CORP. v. SCHOONEJONGEN

Opinion of the Court
amendment summaries "shall be written in a manner calcu-lated to be understood by the average plan participant."

$ 1022(a)(1).More important, independent of any information automatically distributed to beneficiaries, ERISA requires that every
plan administrator make available for inspection in the ad-ministrator's "principal office" and other designated locations

a set of all currently operative, governing plan documents,see $ 1024(b)(2), which necessarily includes any new, bona
fide amendments. See also $ 1024(b)(4) (requiring plan ad-ministrators, upon written request, to furnish beneficiaries
with copies of governing plan documents for a reasonable
copying charge). As indicated earlier, plan administrators
appear to have a statutory responsibility actually to run the
plan in accordance with the currently operative, governing
plan documents and thus an independent incentive for obtaining new amendments as quickly as possible and for weeding out defective ones.

This may not be a foolproof informational scheme, although it is quite thorough. Either way, it is the scheme
that Congress devised. And we do not think Congress intended it to be supplemented by a faraway provision in another part of the statute, least of all in a way that would lead
to improbable results, supra, at 81.

In concluding that Curtiss-Wright's reservation clause
sets forth a valid amendment procedure, we do not mean to
imply that there is anything wrong with plan beneficiaries
trying to prove that unfavorable plan amendments were
not properly adopted and are thus invalid. This is exactly
what respondents are trying to do here, and nothing in
ERISA is designed to obstruct such efforts. But nothing

in ERISA is designed to facilitate such efforts either. To
be sure, some companies that have plans with the standard
reservation clause may want to provide greater specification
to their amendment procedures precisely to avoid such costly
litigation. Or they may want to retain the flexibility that

85Cite as: 514 U. S. 73 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
designating "[t]he Company" (read in light of corporate law)provides them. But either way, this is simply a species of a

larger dilemma companies face whenever they must desig-nate who, on behalf of the company, may take legally binding
actions that third parties may later have an interest inchallenging as unauthorized. Cf. R. Clark, Corporate Law

$ 3.3.2 (1986). It is not a dilemma ERISA addresses.ERISA, rather, follows standard trust law principles in
dictating only that whatever level of specificity a companyultimately chooses, in an amendment procedure or elsewhere, it is bound to that level.

III
Having determined that the Curtiss-Wright plan satisfies$ 402(b)(3), we do not reach the question of the proper remedy for a $ 402(b)(3) violation. On remand, the Court of Ap-peals will have to decide the question that has always been
at the heart of this case: whether Curtiss-Wright's validamendment procedure--amendment "by the Company"--
was complied with in this case. The answer will depend ona fact-intensive inquiry, under applicable corporate law principles, into what persons or committees within Curtiss-Wright possessed plan amendment authority, either by express delegation or impliedly, and whether those persons orcommittees actually approved the new plan provision contained in the revised SPD. See 2 W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia ofthe Law of Private Corporations $ 444, pp. 397-398 (1990)
(authority may be by express delegation or it "may be in-ferred from circumstances or implied from the acquiescence
of the corporation or its agents in a general course of busi-ness"). If the new plan provision is found not to have been
properly authorized when issued, the question would thenarise whether any subsequent actions, such as the executive
vice president's letters informing respondents of the termi-nation, served to ratify the provision

ex post. See id.,$ 437.10, at 386.

SHALALA, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMANSERVICES

v. GUERNSEY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 93-1251. Argued October 31, 1994--Decided March 6, 1995
After the refinancing of its bonded debt resulted in a "defeasance" loss

for accounting purposes, respondent health care provider (hereinafter
Hospital) determined that it was entitled to Medicare reimbursement
for part of that loss. Although the Hospital contended that it should
receive its full reimbursement in the year of the refinancing, the fiscal
intermediary agreed with petitioner Secretary of Health and Human
Services that the loss had to be amortized over the life of the Hospital's
old bonds in accord with an informal Medicare reimbursement guideline,
PRM $ 233. The District Court ultimately sustained the Secretary's
position, but the Court of Appeals reversed. Interpreting the Secretary's Medicare regulations, 42 CFR pt. 413, to require reimbursement
according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the latter
court concluded that, because PRM $ 233 departed from GAAP, it effected a substantive change in the regulations and was void by reason
of the Secretary's failure to issue it in accordance with the notice-andcomment provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).

Held:

1. The Secretary is not required to adhere to GAAP in making provider reimbursement determinations. Pp. 91-97.

(a) The Medicare regulations do not require reimbursement according to GAAP. The Secretary's position that 42 CFR $ 413.20(a)--which
specifies, inter alia, that "[t]he principles of cost reimbursement require
that providers maintain sufficient financial records . . . for proper determination of costs," and that "[s]tandardized definitions, accounting, statistics, and reporting practices that are widely accepted in the hospital
and related fields are followed"--ensures the existence of adequate provider records but does not dictate the Secretary's own reimbursement
determinations is supported by the regulation's text and the overall
structure of the regulations and is therefore entitled to deference as a
reasonable regulatory interpretation. Moreover, $ 413.24--which requires that a provider's cost data be based on the accrual basis of accounting--does not mandate reimbursement according to GAAP, since
GAAP is not the only form of accrual accounting. In fact, PRM $ 233
reflects a different accrual method. Pp. 92-95.

88 SHALALA v. GUERNSEY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL

Syllabus
(b) The Secretary's reading of her regulations is consistent with
the Medicare statute, which does not require adherence to GAAP, but
merely instructs that, in establishing methods for determining reimbursable costs, she should "consider, among other things, the principles
generally applied by national organizations or established prepayment
organizations (which have developed such principles) . . . ," 42 U. S. C.

$ 1395x(v)(1)(A). Nor is there any basis for suggesting that the Secretary has a statutory duty to promulgate regulations that address every
conceivable question in the process of determining equitable reimbursement. To the extent that $ 1395x(v)(1)(A)'s broad delegation of authority to her imposes a rulemaking obligation, it is one she has without
doubt discharged by issuing comprehensive and intricate regulations
that address a wide range of reimbursement questions and by relying
upon an elaborate adjudicative structure to resolve particular details
not specifically addressed by regulation. The APA does not require
that all the specific applications of a rule evolve by further, more precise
rules rather than by adjudication, and the Secretary's mode of determining benefits by both rulemaking and adjudication is a proper exercise of
her statutory mandate. Pp. 95-97.

2. The Secretary's failure to follow the APA notice-and-comment
provisions in issuing PRM $ 233 does not invalidate that guideline. It
was proper for the Secretary to issue a guideline or interpretive rule
in determining that defeasance losses should be amortized. PRM $ 233
is the Secretary's means of implementing the statute's mandate that
the Medicare program bear neither more nor less than its fair share of
reimbursement costs, 42 U. S. C. $ 1395x(v)(1)(A)(i), and the regulatory
requirement that only the actual cost of services rendered to beneficiaries during a given year be reimbursed, 42 CFR $ 413.9. As such,
PRM $ 233 is a prototypical example of an interpretive rule issued by
an agency to advise the public of its construction of the statutes and
rules it administers. Interpretive rules do not require notice and
comment, although they also do not have the force and effect of law
and are not accorded that weight in the adjudicatory process. APA
rulemaking would be required if PRM $ 233 adopted a new position inconsistent with any of the Secretary's existing regulations. However,
because the Secretary's regulations do not bind her to make Medicare
reimbursements in accordance with GAAP, her determination in PRM

$ 233 to depart from GAAP by requiring bond defeasance losses to be
amortized does not amount to a substantive change to the regulations.
Pp. 97-100.

3. An examination of the nature and objectives of GAAP illustrates
the unlikelihood that the Secretary would choose to impose upon herself
the duty to go through the time-consuming rulemaking process when514us1$34z 05-27-98 14:27:39 PAGES OPINPGT

ever she disagreed with any anouncements or changes in GAAP and
wished to depart from them. Pp. 100-102.

(a) GAAP does not necessarily reflect economic reality, and its conservative orientation in guiding judgments and estimates ill serves
Medicare reimbursement and its mandate to avoid cross-subsidization.
Pp. 100-101.

(b) GAAP is not a lucid or encyclopedic set of pre-existing rules.
It encompasses the conventions, rules, and procedures that define accepted accounting practice at a particular point in time, and changes
over time. Even at any one point, GAAP consists of multiple sources,
any number of which might present conflicting treatments of a particular accounting question. Pp. 101-102.

dication and interpretive rules, rather than by regulationsthat address all accounting questions in precise detail.

The particular dispute concerns whether the Medicareregulations require reimbursement according to generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and whether the re-imbursement guideline the Secretary relied upon is invalid
because she did not follow the notice-and-comment provi-sions of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) in issuing
it. We hold that the Secretary's regulations do not requirereimbursement according to GAAP and that her guideline is
a valid interpretive rule. I

Respondent Guernsey Memorial Hospital (hereinafterHospital) issued bonds in 1972 and 1982 to fund capital improvements. In 1985, the Hospital refinanced its bondeddebt by issuing new bonds. Although the refinancing will
result in an estimated $12 million saving in debt servicecosts, the transaction did result in an accounting loss, sometimes referred to as an advance refunding or defeasance loss,of $672,581. The Hospital determined that it was entitled to
Medicare reimbursement for about $314,000 of the loss. Thetotal allowable amount of the loss is not in issue, but its timing is. The Hospital contends it is entitled to full reimburse-ment in one year, the year of the refinancing; the Secretary
contends the loss must be amortized over the life of the oldbonds.

The Secretary's position is in accord with an informalMedicare reimbursement guideline. See U. S. Dept. of
Health and Human Services, Medicare Provider Reimburse-ment Manual $ 233 (Mar. 1993) (PRM). PRM $ 233 does not
purport to be a regulation and has not been adopted pursu-ant to the notice-and-comment procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act. The fiscal intermediary relied on $ 233and determined that the loss had to be amortized. The Provider Reimbursement Review Board disagreed, see App. toPet. for Cert. 54a, but the Administrator of the Health Care

Opinion of the Court
Financing Administration reversed the Board's decision, seeid., at 40a. In the District Court the Secretary's position

was sustained, see Guernsey Memorial Hospital v. Sulli-van, 796 F. Supp. 283 (SD Ohio 1992), but the Court of Appeals reversed, see Guernsey Memorial Hospital v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 996 F. 2d 830 (CA61993). In agreement with the Hospital, the court interpreted the Secretary's own regulations to contain a "flatstatement that generally accepted accounting principles `are
followed' " in determining Medicare reimbursements. Id., at833 (quoting 42 CFR $ 413.20(a)). Although it was willing to
accept the argument that PRM $ 233's treatment of advancerefunding losses "squares with economic reality," 996 F. 2d,
at 834, the Court of Appeals concluded that, because PRM$ 233 departed from GAAP, it "effects a substantive change
in the regulations [and is] void by reason of the agency's fail-ure to comply with the Administrative Procedure Act in
adopting it." Id., at 832. Once the court ruled that GAAPcontrolled the timing of the accrual, it followed that the Hospital, not the Secretary, was correct and that the entire lossshould be recognized in the year of refinancing.

We granted certiorari, 511 U. S. 1016 (1994), and nowreverse.

II
Under the Medicare reimbursement scheme at issue here,participating hospitals furnish services to program beneficiaries and are reimbursed by the Secretary through fiscalintermediaries. See 42 U. S. C. $$ 1395g and 1395h (1988
and Supp. V). Hospitals are reimbursed for "reasonablecosts," defined by the statute as "the cost actually incurred,
excluding therefrom any part of incurred cost found to beunnecessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services." $ 1395x(v)(1)(A). The Medicare Act, 79 Stat. 290, asamended, 42 U. S. C. $ 1395 et seq., authorizes the Secretary
to promulgate regulations "establishing the method or meth-ods to be used" for determining reasonable costs, directing

Opinion of the Court
her in the process to "consider, among other things, theprinciples generally applied by national organizations or established prepayment organizations (which have developedsuch principles) in computing" reimbursement amounts.

$ 1395x(v)(1)(A).The Secretary has promulgated, and updated on an annual
basis, regulations establishing the methods for determiningreasonable cost reimbursement. See

Good Samaritan Hos-pital v. Shalala, 508 U. S. 402, 404-407 (1993). The relevant

provisions can be found within 42 CFR pt. 413 (1994). Re-spondent contends that two of these regulations, $$ 413.20(a)
and 413.24, mandate reimbursement according to GAAP, andthe Secretary counters that neither does.

A
Section 413.20(a) provides as follows:

"The principles of cost reimbursement require thatproviders maintain sufficient financial records and statistical data for proper determination of costs payableunder the program. Standardized definitions, accounting, statistics, and reporting practices that are widelyaccepted in the hospital and related fields are followed.
Changes in these practices and systems will not be re-quired in order to determine costs payable under the
principles of reimbursement. Essentially the methodsof determining costs payable under Medicare involve
making use of data available from the institution's basisaccounts, as usually maintained, to arrive at equitable
and proper payment for services to beneficiaries."
Assuming, arguendo, that the "[s]tandardized definitions,accounting, statistics, and reporting practices" referred to by

the regulation refer to GAAP, that nevertheless is just thebeginning, not the end, of the inquiry. The decisive question
still remains: Who is it that "follow[s]" GAAP, and for whatpurposes? The Secretary's view is that $ 413.20(a) ensures

93Cite as: 514 U. S. 87 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
the existence of adequate provider records but does not dic-tate her own reimbursement determinations. We are persuaded that the Secretary's reading is correct.Section 413.20(a) sets forth its directives in an ordered
progression. The first sentence directs that providers must
maintain records that are sufficient for proper determinationof costs. It does not say the records are conclusive of the

entire reimbursement process. The second sentence makesit clear to providers that standardized accounting practices
are followed. The third sentence reassures providers thatchanges in their recordkeeping practices and systems are not
required in order to determine what costs the provider can
recover when principles of reimbursement are applied to the
provider's raw cost data. That sentence makes a distinction
between recordkeeping practices and systems on one hand
and principles of reimbursement on the other. The last sentence confirms the distinction, for it contemplates that a provider's basic financial information is organized according to
GAAP as a beginning point from which the Secretary "arrive[s] at equitable and proper payment for services." This
is far different from saying that GAAP is by definition an
equitable and proper measure of reimbursement.

The essential distinction between recordkeeping requirements and reimbursement principles is confirmed by the
organization of the regulations in 42 CFR pt. 413 (1994). Subpart A sets forth introductory principles. Subpart B, containing the regulation here in question, is entitled "Accounting Records and Reports." The logical conclusion is that
the provisions in subpart B concern recordkeeping requirements rather than reimbursement, and closer inspection reveals this to be the case. Section 413.20 is the first section
in subpart B, and is entitled "Financial data and reports."
In addition to $ 413.20(a), the other paragraphs in $ 413.20
govern the "[f]requency of cost reports," "[r]ecordkeeping
requirements for new providers," "[c]ontinuing provider recordkeeping requirements," and "[s]uspension of program

Opinion of the Court
payments to a provider . . . [who] does not maintain . . .adequate records." Not until the following subparts are

cost reimbursement matters considered. Subpart C is enti-tled "Limits on Cost Reimbursement," subpart D "Apportionment [of Allowable Costs]," subpart E "Payments to Providers," and subparts F through H address reimbursementof particular cost categories. The logical sequence of a regulation or a part of it can be significant in interpreting itsmeaning.

It is true, as the Court of Appeals said, that $ 413.20(a)"does not exist in a vacuum" but rather is a part of the
overall Medicare reimbursement scheme. 996 F. 2d, at
835. But it does not follow from the fact that a provider's
cost accounting is the first step toward reimbursement that
it is the only step. It is hardly surprising that the reimbursement process begins with certain recordkeeping
requirements.

The regulations' description of the fiscal intermediary's
role underscores this interpretation. The regulations direct
the intermediary to consult and assist providers in interpreting and applying the principles of Medicare reimbursement
to generate claims for reimbursable costs, $ 413.20(b), suggesting that a provider's own determination of its claims involves more than handing over its existing cost reports.
The regulations permit initial acceptance of reimbursable
cost claims, unless there are obvious errors or inconsistencies, in order to expedite payment. $ 413.64(f)(2). When a
subsequent, more thorough audit follows, it may establish
that adjustments are necessary. Ibid.; see also $$ 421.100(a),
(c). This sequence as well is consistent with the Secretary's
view that a provider's cost accounting systems are only the
first step in the ultimate determination of reimbursable
costs.

The Secretary's position that $ 413.20(a) does not bind her
to reimburse according to GAAP is supported by the regulation's text and the overall structure of the regulations. It

is a reasonable regulatory interpretation, and we must deferto it. Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U. S. 504, 512

(1994); see also Martin v. Occupational Safety and HealthReview Comm'n, 499 U. S. 144, 151 (1991) ("Because applying
an agency's regulation to complex or changing circumstancescalls upon the agency's unique expertise and policymaking
prerogatives, we presume that the power authoritatively tointerpret its own regulations is a component of the agency's
delegated lawmaking powers"); Lyng v. Payne, 476 U. S. 926,939 (1986) ("agency's construction of its own regulations is
entitled to substantial deference").Respondent argues that, even if $ 413.20(a) does not mandate reimbursement according to GAAP, $ 413.24 does.This contention need not detain us long. Section 413.24 requires that a provider's cost data be based on the accrualbasis of accounting, under which "revenue is reported in the
period when it is earned, regardless of when it is collected,and expenses are reported in the period in which they are
incurred, regardless of when they are paid." $ 413.24(b)(2).But GAAP is not the only form of accrual accounting; in fact,
both the GAAP approach and PRM $ 233 reflect differentmethods of accrual accounting. See Accounting Principles
Board (APB) Opinion No. 26, |||| 5-8, reprinted at App. 64-66(describing alternative accrual methods of recognizing advance refunding losses, including the one adopted in PRM$ 233). Section 413.24 does not, simply by its accrual accounting requirement, bind the Secretary to make reim-bursements according to GAAP.

The Secretary's reading of her regulations is consistentwith the Medicare statute. Rather than requiring adherence to GAAP, the statute merely instructs the Secretary, inestablishing the methods for determining reimbursable
costs, to "consider, among other things, the principles gener-ally applied by national organizations or established prepay514us1$34L 05-27-98 14:27:39 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ment organizations (which have developed such principles) incomputing the amount of payment . . . to providers of services." 42 U. S. C. $ 1395x(v)(1)(A).Nor is there any basis for suggesting that the Secretary
has a statutory duty to promulgate regulations that, either
by default rule or by specification, address every conceivablequestion in the process of determining equitable reimbursement. To the extent the Medicare statute's broad delega-tion of authority imposes a rulemaking obligation, see

ibid.,
it is one the Secretary has without doubt discharged. See
Good Samaritan Hospital v. Shalala, 508 U. S., at 418, and
n. 13, 419, n. 15. The Secretary has issued regulations to
address a wide range of reimbursement questions. The
regulations are comprehensive and intricate in detail, addressing matters such as limits on cost reimbursement,
apportioning costs to Medicare services, and the specific
treatment of numerous particular costs. As of 1994, these
regulations consumed some 640 pages of the Code of Federal Regulations.

As to particular reimbursement details not addressed
by her regulations, the Secretary relies upon an elaborate
adjudicative structure which includes the right to review
by the Provider Reimbursement Review Board, and, in
some instances, the Secretary, as well as judicial review in
federal district court of final agency action. 42 U. S. C.

$ 1395oo(f)(1); see Bethesda Hospital Assn. v. Bowen, 485
U. S. 399, 400-401 (1988). That her regulations do not resolve the specific timing question before us in a conclusive
way, or "could use a more exact mode of calculating," does
not, of course, render them invalid, for the "methods for the
estimation of reasonable costs" required by the statute only
need be "generalizations [that] necessarily will fail to yield
exact numbers." Good Samaritan, supra, at 418. The
APA does not require that all the specific applications of a
rule evolve by further, more precise rules rather than by
adjudication. See NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U. S. 267

Opinion of the Court
(1974); SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U. S. 194 (1947). The Sec-retary's mode of determining benefits by both rulemaking

and adjudication is, in our view, a proper exercise of her stat-utory mandate.

III
We also believe it was proper for the Secretary to issue aguideline or interpretive rule in determining that defeasance

losses should be amortized. PRM $ 233 is the means to en-sure that capital-related costs allowable under the regulations are reimbursed in a manner consistent with the stat-ute's mandate that the program bear neither more nor less
than its fair share of costs. 42 U. S. C. $ 1395x(v)(1)(A)(i)("[T]he necessary costs of efficiently delivering covered services to individuals covered by [Medicare] will not be borneby individuals not so covered, and the costs with respect to
individuals not so covered will not be borne by [Medicare]").The Secretary has promulgated regulations authorizing reimbursement of capital-related costs such as respondent'sthat are "appropriate and helpful in . . . maintaining the
operation of patient care facilities," 42 CFR $ 413.9(b)(2)(1994); see generally $$ 413.130-413.157, including "[n]ecessary and proper interest" and other costs associated withcapital indebtedness, $ 413.153(a)(1); see also $$ 413.130(a)(7)
and (g). The only question unaddressed by the otherwisecomprehensive regulations on this particular subject is
whether the loss should be recognized at once or spread overa period of years. It is at this step that PRM $ 233 directs
amortization.Although one-time recognition in the initial year might be
the better approach where the question is how best to por-tray a loss so that investors can appreciate in full a company's financial position, see APB Opinion 26, |||| 4-5, re-printed at App. 64, the Secretary has determined in PRM

$ 233 that amortization is appropriate to ensure that Medi-care only reimburse its fair share. The Secretary must calculate how much of a provider's total allowable costs are

514us1$34L 05-27-98 14:27:40 PAGES OPINPGT
98 SHALALA v. GUERNSEY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL

Opinion of the Court
attributable to Medicare services, see 42 CFR $$ 413.5(a),413.9(a), and (c)(3) (1994), which entails calculating what proportion of the provider's services were delivered to Medicarepatients, $$ 413.50 and 413.53. This ratio is referred to as
the provider's "Medicare utilization." App. to Pet. for Cert.
49a. In allocating a provider's total allowable costs to Medi-care, the Secretary must guard against various contingencies. The percentage of a hospital's patients covered byMedicare may change from year to year; or the provider may
drop from the Medicare program altogether. Either willcause the hospital's Medicare utilization to fluctuate. Given
the undoubted fact that Medicare utilization will not be an
annual constant, the Secretary must strive to assure that
costs associated with patient services provided over time be
spread, to avoid distortions in reimbursement. As the provider's yearly Medicare utilization becomes ascertainable,
the Secretary is able to allocate costs with accuracy and the
program can bear its proportionate share. Proper reimbursement requires proper timing. Should the Secretary
reimburse in one year costs in fact attributable to a span of
years, the reimbursement will be determined by the provider's Medicare utilization for that one year, not for later years.
This leads to distortion. If the provider's utilization rate
changes or if the provider drops from the program altogether
the Secretary will have reimbursed up front an amount other
than that attributable to Medicare services. The result
would be cross-subsidization, id., at 50a, which the Act forbids. 42 U. S. C. $ 1395x(v)(1)(A)(i).

That PRM $ 233 implements the statutory ban on crosssubsidization in a reasonable way is illustrated by the Administrator's application of $ 233 to the facts of this case.
The Administrator found that respondent's loss "did not relate exclusively to patient care services rendered in the year
of the loss . . . . [but were] more closely related to [patient
care services in] the years over which the original bond term
extended." App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a. Because the loss

99Cite as: 514 U. S. 87 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
was associated with patient services over a period of time,
the Administrator concluded that amortization was required
to avoid the statutory ban on cross-subsidization:

"The statutory prohibition against cross-subsidization
[citing the provision codified at 42 U. S. C. $ 1395x
(v)(1)(A)], requires that costs recognized in one year, but
attributable to health services rendered over a number
of years, be amortized and reimbursed during those
years when Medicare beneficiaries use those services."
Id., at 50a (footnote omitted).

"By amortizing the loss to match it to Medicare utilization over the years to which it relates, the program is
protected from any drop in Medicare utilization, and the
provider is likewise assured that it will be adequately
reimbursed if Medicare utilization increases. Further,
the program is protected from making a payment attributable to future years and then having the provider drop
out of the Program before services are rendered to
Medicare beneficiaries in those future years." Id., at
49a (footnote omitted).

As an application of the statutory ban on crosssubsidization and the regulatory requirement that only the
actual cost of services rendered to beneficiaries during a
given year be reimbursed, 42 U. S. C. $ 1395x(v)(1)(A)(i); 42
CFR $ 413.9 (1994), PRM $ 233 is a prototypical example of
an interpretive rule " `issued by an agency to advise the public of the agency's construction of the statutes and rules
which it administers.' " Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U. S.
281, 302, n. 31 (1979) (quoting Attorney General's Manual on
the Administrative Procedure Act 30, n. 3 (1947)). Interpretive rules do not require notice and comment, although, as
the Secretary recognizes, see Foreword to PRM, they also
do not have the force and effect of law and are not accorded
that weight in the adjudicatory process, ibid.

Opinion of the Court
We can agree that APA rulemaking would still be requiredif PRM $ 233 adopted a new position inconsistent with any

of the Secretary's existing regulations. As set forth in PartII, however, her regulations do not require reimbursement
according to GAAP. PRM $ 233 does not, as the Court ofAppeals concluded it does, "effec[t] a substantive change in
the regulations." 996 F. 2d, at 832.

IV
There is much irony in the suggestion, made in support ofthe Hospital's interpretation of the statute and regulations,

that the Secretary has bound herself to delegate the determi-nation of any matter not specifically addressed by the regulations to the conventions of financial accounting that compriseGAAP. The Secretary in effect would be imposing upon
herself a duty to go through the time-consuming rulemakingprocess whenever she disagrees with any announcements or
changes in GAAP and wishes to depart from them. Examin-ing the nature and objectives of GAAP illustrates the unlikelihood that the Secretary would choose that course.Contrary to the Secretary's mandate to match reimbursement with Medicare services, which requires her to deter-mine with some certainty just when and on whose account
costs are incurred, GAAP "do[es] not necessarily paralleleconomic reality." R. Kay & D. Searfoss, Handbook of Accounting and Auditing, ch. 5, p. 7 (2d ed. 1989). Financialaccounting is not a science. It addresses many questions as
to which the answers are uncertain and is a "process [that]involves continuous judgments and estimates." Id., ch. 5, at
7-8. In guiding these judgments and estimates, "financialaccounting has as its foundation the principle of conservatism, with its corollary that `possible errors in measurement[should] be in the direction of understatement rather than
overstatement of net income and net assets.' " Thor Power
Tool Co. v. Commissioner, 439 U. S. 522, 542 (1979) (citationomitted). This orientation may be consistent with the ob514us1$34L 05-27-98 14:27:40 PAGES OPINPGT

101Cite as: 514 U. S. 87 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
jective of informing investors, but it ill serves the needs ofMedicare reimbursement and its mandate to avoid crosssubsidization. Cf. id., at 543 ("[T]he accountant's conserva-tism cannot bind the Commissioner [of the IRS] in his efforts
to collect taxes").

GAAP is not the lucid or encyclopedic set of pre-existingrules that the dissent might perceive it to be. Far from a

single-source accounting rulebook, GAAP "encompasses theconventions, rules, and procedures that define accepted accounting practice at a particular point in time." Kay &Searfoss, ch. 5, at 7 (1994 Update). GAAP changes and,
even at any one point, is often indeterminate. "[T]he determination that a particular accounting principle is generally
accepted may be difficult because no single source exists
for all principles." Ibid. There are 19 different GAAP
sources, any number of which might present conflicting
treatments of a particular accounting question. Id., ch. 5, at
6-7. When such conflicts arise, the accountant is directed
to consult an elaborate hierarchy of GAAP sources to determine which treatment to follow. Ibid. We think it is a
rather extraordinary proposition that the Secretary has
consigned herself to this process in addressing the timing
of Medicare reimbursement.

The framework followed in this case is a sensible structure
for the complex Medicare reimbursement process. The Secretary has promulgated regulations setting forth the basic
principles and methods of reimbursement, and has issued interpretive rules such as PRM $ 233 that advise providers
how she will apply the Medicare statute and regulations in
adjudicating particular reimbursement claims. Because the
Secretary's regulations do not bind her to make Medicare
reimbursements in accordance with GAAP, her determination in PRM $ 233 to depart from GAAP by requiring bond
defeasance losses to be amortized does not amount to a substantive change to the regulations. It is a valid interpretive
rule, and it was reasonable for the Secretary to follow that

policy here to deny respondent's claim for full reimburse-ment of its defeasance loss in 1985.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Scalia, Justice
Souter, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

Unlike the Court, I believe that general Medicare report-ing and reimbursement regulations require provider costs to

be treated according to "generally accepted accounting prin-ciples." As a result, I would hold that contrary guidelines
issued by the Secretary of Health and Human Services in aninformal policy manual and applied to determine the timing
of reimbursement in this case are invalid for failure to com-ply with the notice and comment procedures established by
the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. $ 553. Becausethe Court holds to the contrary, I respectfully dissent.

I
It is undisputed, as the Court notes, ante, at 90, that re-spondent, Guernsey Memorial Hospital (Hospital), is entitled

to reimbursement for the reasonable advance refunding costsit incurred when it refinanced its capital improvement bonds
in 1985. The only issue here is one of timing: whether reim-bursement is to be made in a lump sum in the year of the
refinancing, in accordance with generally accepted account-ing principles (known in the accounting world as GAAP), or
in a series of payments over the remaining life of the originalbonds, as the Secretary ultimately concluded after applying

$ 233 of the Medicare Provider Reimbursement Manual(PRM). The Hospital challenged the Secretary's reimbursement decision under the Medicare Act, 42 U. S. C. $ 1395oo(f),which incorporates the Administrative Procedure Act, 5
U. S. C. $ 551 et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. V), by reference.Under the governing standard, reviewing courts are to "hold

unlawful and set aside" an agency action that is "arbitrary,capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law." 5 U. S. C. $ 706(2)(A). We must give sub-stantial deference to an agency's interpretation of its own
regulations, Lyng v. Payne, 476 U. S. 926, 939 (1986), but an
agency's interpretation cannot be sustained if it is " `plainlyerroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.' "

Stinson
v. United States, 508 U. S. 36, 45 (1993) (quoting Bowles v.
Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U. S. 410, 414 (1945)). In
my view, that is the case here.The Medicare Act requires that, for reimbursement purposes, the actual reasonable costs incurred by a provider
"shall be determined in accordance with regulations establishing the method or methods to be used . . . in determining
such costs." 42 U. S. C. $ 1395x(v)(1)(A). The Secretary's
regulations similarly provide that the "[r]easonable cost of
any services must be determined in accordance with regulations establishing the method or methods to be used, and
the items to be included." 42 CFR $ 413.9(b)(1) (1994). The
Secretary is not bound to adopt GAAP for reimbursement
purposes; indeed, the statute only requires that, in promulgating the necessary regulations, "the Secretary shall consider, among other things, the principles generally applied
by national organizations or established prepayment organizations (which have developed such principles) in computing
the amount of payment . . . to providers of services . . . ."
42 U. S. C. $ 1395x(v)(1)(A). Neither the Hospital nor the
Court of Appeals disputes that the Secretary has broad and
flexible authority to prescribe standards for reimbursement.
See Good Samaritan Hospital v. Shalala, 508 U. S. 402, 418,
n. 13 (1993).

Nevertheless, the statute clearly contemplates that the
Secretary will state the applicable reimbursement methods
in regulations--including default rules that cover a range of
situations unless and until specific regulations are promulgated to supplant them with respect to a particular type of

104 SHALALA v. GUERNSEY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL

O'Connor, J., dissenting
cost. Indeed, despite the Court's suggestion to the contrary,
ante, at 96, only by employing such default rules can the
Secretary operate the sensible, comprehensive reimburse-ment scheme that Congress envisioned. Otherwise, without

such background guidelines, providers would not have the
benefit of regulations establishing the accounting principlesupon which reimbursement decisions will be based, and administrators would be free to select, without having to com-ply with notice and comment procedures, whatever accounting rule may appear best in a particular context (so long asit meets minimum standards of rationality). In my view, the
question becomes simply whether the Secretary has in fact
adopted GAAP as the default rule for cost reimbursement
accounting.

Like the Court, see ante, at 95-96, I do not think that 42
CFR $ 413.24(a) (1994), which provides that Medicare cost
data "must be based on . . . the accrual basis of accounting,"
requires the use of GAAP. As the regulation itself explains,
"[u]nder the accrual basis of accounting, revenue is reported
in the period when it is earned, regardless of when it is
collected, and expenses are reported in the period in which
they are incurred, regardless of when they are paid."

$ 413.24(b)(2). This definition of "accrual basis" simply incorporates the dictionary understanding of the term, thereby
distinguishing the method required of cost providers from
"cash basis" accounting (under which revenue is reported
only when it is actually received and expenses are reported
only when they are actually paid). GAAP employs the generally accepted form of accrual basis accounting, but not the
only possible form. In fact, both the applicable GAAP rule,
established by Early Extinguishment of Debt, Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 26 (1972), reprinted at App. 62,
and PRM $ 233 appear to reflect accrual, as opposed to cash
basis, accounting principles.

Although $ 413.24 simply opens the door for the Secretary
to employ GAAP, $ 413.20 makes clear that she has, in fact,

514us1$34J 05-27-98 14:27:40 PAGES OPINPGT

105Cite as: 514 U. S. 87 (1995)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
incorporated GAAP into the cost reimbursement process.That section provides that "[s]tandardized definitions, accounting, statistics, and reporting practices that are widelyaccepted in the hospital and related fields are followed."

$ 413.20(a). As the Court of Appeals noted, "[i]t is undisputed, in the case at bar, that Guernsey Memorial Hospitalkeeps its books on the accrual basis of accounting and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
Guernsey Memorial Hospital v. Secretary of HHS, 996 F. 2d
830, 834 (CA6 1993). Similarly, related entities in the healthcare field employ GAAP as their standardized accounting

practices. See American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Audits of Providers of Health Care Services

$ 3.01, p. 11 (1993) ("Financial statements of health care entities should be prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles"); Brief for American Hospital
Association et al. as Amici Curiae 7-8 ("Generally accepted
accounting principles have always provided the standard
definitions and accounting practices applied by nongovernment hospitals in maintaining their books and records"). Accordingly, the Secretary concedes that, under

$ 413.20, the Hospital at the very least was required to submit its request for Medicare reimbursement in accordance
with GAAP. Guernsey Memorial Hospital v. Sullivan,
796 F. Supp. 283, 288-289 (SD Ohio 1992); Tr. of Oral Arg. 8.

The remainder of $ 413.20 demonstrates, moreover, that
the accounting practices commonly used in the health care
field determine how costs will be reimbursed by Medicare,
not just how they are to be reported. The first sentence of

$ 413.20(a) begins with a statement that the provision explains what "[t]he principles of cost reimbursement require."
(Emphasis added.) And the sentence emphasizing that
standardized accounting and reporting practices "are followed" is itself accompanied by the promise that "[c]hanges
in these practices and systems will not be required in order
to determine costs payable [that is, reimbursable] under the

514us1$34J 05-27-98 14:27:40 PAGES OPINPGT
106 SHALALA v. GUERNSEY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL

O'Connor, J., dissenting
principles of reimbursement." The language of the regula-tion, taken as a whole, indicates that the accounting system

maintained by the provider ordinarily forms the basis fordetermining how Medicare costs will be reimbursed. I find
it significant that the Secretary, through the Administrator
of the Health Care Finance Administration, has changed herinterpretation of this regulation, having previously concluded that this provision generally requires the costs ofMedicare providers to be reimbursed according to GAAP
when that construction was to her benefit. See Dr. David
M. Brotman Memorial Hospital v. Blue Cross Assn. /Blue
Cross of Southern California, HCFA Admin. Decision, CCH
Medicare and Medicaid Guide || 30,922, p. 9839 (1980) (holding
that, "[u]nder 42 CFR 405.406 [now codified as $ 413.20], the
determination of costs payable under the program should
follow standardized accounting practices" and applying the
GAAP rule--that credit card costs should be treated as expenses in the period incurred--and not the PRM's contrary
rule--that such costs should be considered reductions of
revenue).

Following the Secretary's current position, the Court concludes, ante, at 92-93, that $ 413.20 was intended to do no
more than reassure Medicare providers that they would not
be required fundamentally to alter their accounting practices
for reporting purposes. Indeed, the Court maintains, the
regulation simply ensures the existence of adequate provider
financial records, maintained according to widely accepted
accounting practices, that will enable the Secretary to calculate the costs payable under the Medicare program using
some other systemwide method of determining costs, which
method she does not, and need not, state in any regulations.
For several reasons, I find the Court's interpretation of

$ 413.20 untenable.

Initially, the Court's view is belied by the text and structure of the regulations. As the Court of Appeals noted, "the
sentence in [$ 413.20(a)] that says standardized reporting

514us1$34J 05-27-98 14:27:40 PAGES OPINPGT

O'Connor, J., dissenting
practices `are followed' does not exist in a vacuum." 996F. 2d, at 835. The Provider Reimbursement Review Board

has explained: "[T]he purpose of cost reporting is to enablea hospital's costs to be known so that its reimbursement can
be calculated. For that reason, there must be some consistency between the fundamental principles of cost reportingand those principles used for cost reimbursement."

Fort
Worth Osteopathic Medical Center v. Blue Cross and Blue
Shield Ass'n/Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas, CCH
Medicare and Medicaid Guide || 40,413, p. 31,848 (1991). Thetext of $ 413.20 itself establishes this link between cost reporting and cost reimbursement by explaining that a provider hospital generally need not modify its accounting and
reporting practices in order to determine what costs Medicare will reimburse. That is, "the methods of determining
costs payable under Medicare involve making use of data
available from the institution's basis accounts, as usually
maintained, to arrive at equitable and proper payment for
services to beneficiaries." $ 413.20(a). By linking the reimbursement process to the provider's existing financial records, the regulation contemplates that both the agency and
the provider will be able to determine what costs are reimbursable. It would make little sense to tie cost reporting
to cost reimbursement in this manner while simultaneously
mandating different accounting systems for each.

In addition, as the Court aptly puts it, "[t]he logical sequence of a regulation . . . can be significant in interpreting
its meaning." Ante, at 94. Consideration of how a provider's claim for reimbursement is processed undermines the
Court's interpretation of $ 413.20(a). The Court suggests
that the fiscal intermediaries who make the initial reimbursement decisions take a hospital's cost report as raw data
and apply a separate set of accounting principles to determine the proper amount of reimbursement. In certain situations, namely where the regulations provide for specific departures from GAAP, this is undoubtedly the case. But the

108 SHALALA v. GUERNSEY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL

O'Connor, J., dissenting
description of the intermediary's role in the regulations con-templates reliance on the GAAP-based cost report

as determining reimbursable costs in considering the ordinary claim.See,

e. g., $ 413.60(b) (providing that, "[a]t the end of the [reporting] period, the actual apportionment, based on the cost
finding and apportionment methods selected by the provider, determines the Medicare reimbursement for the actual
services provided to beneficiaries during the period" (empha-sis added)); $ 413.64(f)(2) ("In order to reimburse the provider as quickly as possible, an initial retroactive adjustmentwill be made as soon as the cost report is received. For this
purpose, the costs will be accepted as reported, unless there
are obvious errors or inconsistencies, subject to later audit.
When an audit is made and the final liability of the program
is determined, a final adjustment will be made" (emphasis
added)). The fiscal intermediary, then, is essentially instructed to check the hospital's cost report for accuracy, reasonableness, and presumably compliance with the regulations. But that task seems to operate within the framework
of the hospital's normal accounting procedure--i. e., GAAP--
and not some alternative, uncodified set of accounting principles employed by the Secretary. See generally 42 CFR

$$ 421.1-421.128 (1994).

I take seriously our obligation to defer to an agency's reasonable interpretation of its own regulations, particularly
"when, as here, the regulation concerns `a complex and
highly technical regulatory program,' in which the identification and classification of relevant `criteria necessarily require significant expertise and entail the exercise of judgment grounded in policy concerns.' " Thomas Jefferson
Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U. S. 504, 512 (1994) (quoting Pauley v.
BethEnergy Mines, Inc., 501 U. S. 680, 697 (1991)). In this
case, however, the Secretary advances a view of the regulations that would force us to conclude that she has not fulfilled
her statutory duty to promulgate regulations determining
the methods by which reasonable Medicare costs are to be

calculated. If $ 413.20 does not incorporate GAAP as thebasic method for determining cost reimbursement in the

absence of a more specific regulation, then there is no reg-ulation that specifies an overall methodology to be applied in
the cost determination process. Given that the regulatoryscheme could not operate without such a background
method, and given that the statute requires the Secretary tomake reimbursement decisions "in accordance with regulations establishing the method or methods to be used," 42U. S. C. $ 1395x(v)(1)(A), I find the Secretary's interpretation
to be unreasonable and unworthy of deference.Unlike the Court, therefore, I would hold that $ 413.20 requires the costs incurred by Medicare providers to be reim-bursed according to GAAP in the absence of a specific regulation providing otherwise. The remainder of my decisionflows from this conclusion. PRM $ 233, which departs from
the GAAP rule concerning advance refunding losses, doesnot have the force of a regulation because it was promulgated without notice and comment as required by the Admin-istrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. $ 553. And, contrary to
the Secretary's argument, PRM $ 233 cannot be a valid "in-terpretation" of the Medicare regulations because it is
clearly at odds with the meaning of $ 413.20 itself. Thus, Iwould conclude that the Secretary's refusal, premised upon
an application of PRM $ 233, to reimburse the Hospital's bonddefeasement costs in accordance with GAAP was invalid.

II
The remaining arguments advanced by the Court in sup-port of the Secretary's position do not alter my view of the

regulatory scheme. The Court suggests that a contrary de-cision, by requiring the Secretary to comply with the notice
and comment provisions of the Administrative Procedure Actin promulgating reimbursement regulations, would impose
an insurmountable burden on the Secretary's administrationof the Medicare program. I disagree. Congress obviously

O'Connor, J., dissenting
thought that the Secretary could manage that task when itrequired that she act by regulation. Moreover, despite the

Court's suggestion, ante, at 96, nothing in my position re-quires the agency to adopt substantive rules addressing
every detailed and minute reimbursement issue that might
arise. An agency certainly cannot foresee every factual sce-nario with which it may be presented in administering its

programs; to fill in the gaps, it must rely on adjudication ofparticular cases and other forms of agency action, such as
the promulgation of interpretive rules and policy statements,that give effect to the statutory principles and the background methods embodied in the regulations. Far from
being foreclosed from case-by-case adjudication, the Secretary is simply obligated, in making those reimbursement decisions, to abide by whatever ground rules she establishes
by regulation. Under the Court's reading of the regulations, the Secretary in this case did not apply any accounting
principle found in the regulations to the specific facts at
issue--and indeed could not have done so because no such
principles are stated outside the detailed provisions governing particular reimbursement decisions. I believe that the
Medicare Act's command that reimbursement requests by
providers be evaluated "in accordance with regulations establishing the method or methods to be used" precludes
this result.

Moreover, I find it significant that the bond defeasement
situation at issue here was foreseen. If the Secretary had
the opportunity to include a section on advance refunding
costs in the PRM, then she could have promulgated a regulation to that effect in compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act, thereby giving the public a valuable opportunity
to comment on the regulation's wisdom and those adversely
affected the chance to challenge the ultimate rule in court.
An agency is bound by the regulations it promulgates and
may not attempt to circumvent the amendment process
through substantive changes recorded in an informal policy

manual that are unsupported by the language of the regula-tion. Here, Congress expressed a clear policy in the Medicare Act that the reimbursement principles selected by theSecretary--whatever they may be--must be adopted subject
to the procedural protections of the Administrative Procedure Act. I would require the Secretary to comply withthat statutory mandate.

The PRM, of course, remains an important part of theMedicare reimbursement process, explaining in detail what
the regulations lay out in general and providing those whomust prepare and process claims with the agency's statements of policy concerning how those regulations should be
applied in particular contexts. One role for the manual,
therefore, is to assist the Secretary in her daunting task of
overseeing the thousands of Medicare reimbursement decisions made each year. As the foreword to the PRM explains, "[t]he procedures and methods set forth in this manual have been devised to accommodate program needs and
the administrative needs of providers and their intermediaries and will assure that the reasonable cost regulations are
uniformly applied nationally without regard to where covered services are furnished." Indeed, large portions of the
PRM are devoted to detailed examples, including step-bystep calculations, of how certain rules should be applied to
particular facts. The manual also provides a forum for the
promulgation of interpretive rules and general statements of
policy, types of agency action that describe what the agency
believes the statute and existing regulations require but that
do not alter the substantive obligations created thereby.
Such interpretive rules are exempt from the notice and comment provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, see 5
U. S. C. $ 553(b)(A), but they must explain existing law and
not contradict what the regulations require.

As a result, the policy considerations upon which the
Court focuses, see ante, at 97-100, are largely beside the
point. Like the Court of Appeals, I do not doubt that the

112 SHALALA v. GUERNSEY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL

O'Connor, J., dissenting
amortization approach embodied in PRM $ 233 "squares witheconomic reality," 996 F. 2d, at 834, and would likely be upheld as a rational regulation were it properly promulgated.Nor do I doubt that amortization of advance refunding costs
may have certain advantages for Medicare reimbursement
purposes. It is certainly true that the Act prohibits theMedicare program from bearing more or less than its proper

share of hospital costs, 42 U. S. C. $ 1395x(v)(1)(A)(i), but im-mediate recognition of advance refunding losses does not violate this principle. While the Court, like the Secretary, as-sumes that advance refunding costs are properly attributed
to health care services rendered over a number of years, it
does not point to any evidence in the record substantiating
that proposition. In fact, what testimony there is supports
the view that it is appropriate to recognize advance refunding losses in the year of the transaction because the provider
no longer carries the costs of the refunded debt on its books
thereafter; the losses in question simply represent a onetime recognition of the difference between the net carrying
costs of the old bonds and the price necessary to reacquire
them. See, e. g., App. 14-15, 22. While reasonable people
may debate the merits of the two options, the point is that
both appear in the end to represent economically reasonable
and permissible methods of determining what costs are properly reimbursable and when. Given that neither approach is
commanded by the statute, the cross-subsidization argument
should not alter our reading of $ 413.20.

Finally, the Secretary argues that she was given a "broad
and flexible mandate" to prescribe standards for Medicare
reimbursement, and that, as a result, "it is exceedingly unlikely that the Secretary would have intended, in general
regulations promulgated as part of the initial implementation of the Medicare Act, to abdicate to the accounting profession (or to anyone else) ultimate responsibility for making
particular cost reimbursement determinations." Brief for
Petitioner 19. She points out that the purpose of Medicare

O'Connor, J., dissenting
reimbursement, to provide payment of the necessary costs
of efficient delivery of covered services to Medicare beneficiaries, may not be identical to the objective of financial
accounting, which is "to provide useful information to management, shareholders, creditors, and others properly interested" and "has as its foundation the principle of [financial]
conservatism." Thor Power Tool Co. v. Commissioner, 439
U. S. 522, 542 (1979) (rejecting taxpayer's assertion that an
accounting principle that conforms to GAAP must be presumed to be permissible for tax purposes). The Court
makes this argument as well. See ante, at 100-101.

Reading the regulations to employ GAAP, even though it
is possible that the relevant reimbursement standard will
change over time as the position of the accounting profession
evolves, does not imply an abdication of statutory authority
but a necessary invocation of an established body of accounting principles to apply where specific regulations have not
provided otherwise. The Secretary is, of course, not bound
by GAAP in such a situation and, indeed, has promulgated
reimbursement regulations that depart from the GAAP
default rule in specific situations. Compare, e. g., $ 413.134
(f)(2) (limited recognition of gain or loss on involuntary conversion of depreciable asset) with R. Kay & D. Searfoss,
Handbook of Accounting and Auditing, ch. 15, p. 14 (2d ed.
1989 and 1994 Supp.) (gains or losses are recognized under
GAAP in the period of disposal of a depreciable asset, even
if reinvested in a similar asset). The Secretary would also
be free to devise a reimbursement scheme that does not involve GAAP as a background principle at all if she believes,
as the Court argues, that use of GAAP binds her to a cost
allocation methodology ill suited to Medicare reimbursement,
see ante, at 101. Our task is simply to review the regulations the Secretary has in fact adopted, and I conclude that
the Secretary has incorporated GAAP as the reimbursement
default rule.

O'Connor, J., dissenting

III
Contrary to the Court's conclusion, I do not believe thatthe Administrator's reimbursement decision can be defended

as a rational application of the statute and the existing regu-lations. The Hospital sought reimbursement for its advance
refunding costs in accordance with GAAP and in compliancewith the Secretary's published regulations. The Administrator applied PRM $ 233, which calls for a departure fromGAAP in this instance, to deny the Hospital's request; that
decision contradicted the agency's own regulations andtherefore resulted in a reimbursement decision that was "not
in accordance with law" within the meaning of the Adminis-trative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. $ 706(2)(A). I agree with
the court below that "[t]he `nexus' that exists in the regula-tions between cost reporting and cost reimbursement is too
strong . . . to be broken by a rule not adopted in accordancewith the rulemaking requirements of the Administrative
Procedure Act." 996 F. 2d, at 836. Because the Courtholds otherwise, I respectfully dissent.

GOEKE, SUPERINTENDENT, RENZ CORRECTIONALCENTER

v. BRANCH

on petition for writ of certiorari to the unitedstates court of appeals for the eighth circuit

No. 94-898. Decided March 20, 1995
Before a Missouri trial court could hold a hearing to consider respondent's

motion for a new trial and to sentence her for the murder of her husband, respondent took flight. She was recaptured and sentenced to life
imprisonment without possibility of parole. The State Court of Appeals dismissed her timely notice of appeal on direct review and an appeal of the trial court's denial of her motion for postconviction relief,
finding that, under Missouri's well-established fugitive dismissal rule, a
defendant who attempts to escape justice after conviction forfeits her
right to appeal. Subsequently, the Federal District Court rejected her
procedural due process argument and denied her petition for habeas
relief. On appeal, the Eighth Circuit found that dismissal of respondent's appeal where her preappeal flight had no adverse effect on the
appellate process violated substantive due process. The court also concluded that the State had waived its argument that application of the
court's ruling constituted a new rule that could not be announced in a
case on collateral review under Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288.

Held: The State did not waive the Teague issue, and application of the

Eighth Circuit's novel rule violates Teague's holding. The record supports the State's position that it raised the Teague claim in the District
Court and the Eighth Circuit. Thus, it must be considered now, and it
is dispositive. See Caspari v. Bohlen, 510 U. S. 383, 389. The Eighth
Circuit's fugitive dismissal rule was neither dictated nor compelled by
existing precedent when respondent's conviction became final. Nor
does the rule fall into Teague's exception for watershed rules of criminal
procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the
criminal proceeding.

Certiorari granted; 37 F. 3d 371, reversed.

Per Curiam.
In this case, the Eighth Circuit granted habeas relief onthe ground that it is a violation of Fourteenth Amendment

due process for a state appellate court to dismiss the appealof a recaptured fugitive where there is no demonstrated ad514US1$35z 02-06-97 10:31:42 PAGES OPINPGT

Per Curiam
verse effect on the appellate process. The court declined toconsider whether application of its ruling in respondent's

case would violate the principle of Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S.288 (1989) (plurality opinion), concluding the State had
waived that argument. The State raised the Teague bar,
and application of the Eighth Circuit's novel rule violates
Teague's holding. For this reason, certiorari is granted and
the judgment is reversed.In 1986, a Missouri jury convicted Lynda Branch of the

first-degree murder of her husband. On retrial after theMissouri Court of Appeals reversed her conviction because
of an error in the admission of evidence, the jury again convicted her. Branch moved for a new trial, and the trial
court scheduled a hearing for April 3, 1989, to consider this
motion and to sentence her. Before the hearing, however,
Branch, who was free on bail, took flight to a neighboring
county. She was recaptured on April 6, 1989, and sentenced
to life imprisonment without possibility of parole.

Branch filed a timely notice of appeal on direct review and
an appeal of the trial court's denial of her motion for postconviction relief. In 1991, the Missouri Court of Appeals
consolidated and dismissed the appeals under Missouri's
well-established fugitive dismissal rule, which provides that
a defendant who attempts to escape justice after conviction
forfeits her right to appeal. State v. Branch, 811 S. W. 2d
11, 12 (Mo. App. 1991) (citing State v. Carter, 98 Mo. 431, 11
S. W. 979 (1889)). "[E]ven in the absence of prejudice to the
state," the court explained, "the dismissal was justified by a
more fundamental principle: preservation of public respect
for our system of law." 811 S. W. 2d, at 12. Branch did not
seek review in this Court.

On petition for federal habeas relief under 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254, Branch alleged that the dismissal of her consolidated
appeal violated due process. The District Court undertook
what it termed a procedural due process analysis under the
framework set forth in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319,

335 (1976), and denied relief. App. to Pet. for Cert. 17, 22-24. Branch appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Eighth

Circuit, arguing she had stated a procedural due process vio-lation. For the first time, at oral argument, the Eighth Circuit panel suggested the claim was a substantive, not a procedural, due process claim. Id., at 137. Branch's counsel, ofcourse, welcomed the suggestion. On that ground, a divided

panel held that dismissal of an appeal where preappeal flighthad no adverse effect on the appellate process violated the
defendant's substantive rights under the Fourteenth Amend-ment. After the Eighth Circuit denied the State's motion
for rehearing en banc, the majority modified its opinion to
explain that it would not confront the applicability of Teague
because the State had waived the point. Branch v. Turner,
37 F. 3d 371, 374-375 (1994).

The application of Teague is a threshold question in a federal habeas case. Caspari v. Bohlen, 510 U. S. 383, 388-390
(1994). Although a court need not entertain the defense if
the State has not raised it, see Schiro v. Farley, 510 U. S.
222, 229 (1994); Godinez v. Moran, 509 U. S. 389, 397, n. 8
(1993), a court must apply it if it was raised by the State,
Caspari, supra, at 389.

The State's Teague argument was preserved on this record
and in the record before the Court of Appeals. In the District Court, the State argued that respondent's due process
claim "is barred from litigation in federal habeas corpus unless the Court could say, as a threshold matter, that it would
make its new rule of law retroactive. Teague v. Lane."
App. to Pet. for Cert. 99 (citation omitted). In its brief on
appeal, the State pointed out that it had raised the Teague
issue before the District Court, see Branch, supra, at 374,
and argued that if the court were to decide that a constitutional rule prohibited dismissal, "such a conclusion could not
be enforced in this collateral-attack proceeding consistently
with the principles set forth in Teague v. Lane, and its progeny," App. to Pet. for Cert. 129, n. 5 (citation omitted). Con514US1$35z 02-06-97 10:31:42 PAGES OPINPGT

fronted for the first time at oral argument with a substantivedue process claim, the State reasserted that "the prohibition

of Teague against Lane on the enforcement of new rules ofconstitutional law for the first time in a collateral attack proceeding in federal court applies with full force to this case."
Id., at 152. The next five pages of the record are devotedto the court's questions and the State's responses regarding

the Teague issue. App. to Pet. for Cert. 153-157.This record supports the State's position that it raised the
Teague claim. The State's efforts to alert the Eighth Circuitto the

Teague problem provided that court with ample opportunity to make a reasoned judgment on the issue. Cf. Webb
v. Webb, 451 U. S. 493, 501 (1981) (federal claim properly
raised where there is "no doubt from the record that [the
claim] was presented in the state courts and that those
courts were apprised of the nature or substance of the federal claim"). The State did not waive the Teague issue; it
must be considered now; and it is dispositive. See Caspari,
supra, at 389; Gilmore v. Taylor, 508 U. S. 333, 338-339
(1993).

A new rule for Teague purposes is one where " `the result
was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant's conviction became final.' " Caspari, supra, at 390
(quoting Teague, 489 U. S., at 301) (emphasis deleted); Gilmore, supra, at 339-340; Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S. 461,
466-467 (1993). The question is " `whether a state court
considering [the defendant's] claim at the time his conviction
became final would have felt compelled by existing precedent
to conclude that the rule [he] seeks was required by the Constitution.' " Caspari, supra, at 390 (quoting Saffle v. Parks,
494 U. S. 484, 488 (1990)).

Neither respondent nor the Eighth Circuit identifies existing precedent for the proposition that there is no substantial
basis for appellate dismissal when a defendant fails to appear
at sentencing, becomes a fugitive, demonstrates contempt for
the legal system, and imposes significant cost and expense

on the State to secure her recapture. The Eighth Circuitopined that a substantive due process violation arose from

conduct that was "arbitrary," "conscience-shocking," "op-pressive in a constitutional sense," or "interferes with fundamental rights," and that dismissal of Branch's appeal fell
within that category. Branch, supra, at 375. These argu-ments are not based upon existing or well-settled authority.

Respondent and the Court of Appeals rely for the mostpart on

Ortega-Rodriguez v. United States, 507 U. S. 234,
248-249 (1993). There, the Court held, as a matter of itssupervisory power to administer the federal court system,

that absent some adverse effect of preappeal flight on the
appellate process, "the defendant's former fugitive status
may well lack the kind of connection to the appellate process that would justify an appellate sanction of dismissal."
Id., at 251. The case was decided almost two years after
Branch's conviction became final. The rationale of the opinion, moreover, was limited to supervisory powers; it did not
suggest that dismissal of a fugitive's appeal implicated constitutional principles. Nor was that suggestion made in any
of our earlier cases discussing the fugitive dismissal rule in
the federal or state courts. See Estelle v. Dorrough, 420
U. S. 534 (1975); Molinaro v. New Jersey, 396 U. S. 365 (1970);
Allen v. Georgia, 166 U. S. 138 (1897); Bohanan v. Nebraska,
125 U. S. 692 (1887); Smith v. United States, 94 U. S. 97
(1876). The Ortega-Rodriguez dissent reinforced this point:
"There can be no argument that the fugitive dismissal rule
. . . violates the Constitution because a convicted criminal
has no constitutional right to an appeal." 507 U. S., at 253
(Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting) (citation omitted).

The Eighth Circuit did rely on Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U. S.
387 (1985), where the Court held that the Due Process
Clause, guaranteeing a defendant effective assistance of
counsel on his first appeal as of right, did not permit the
dismissal of an appeal where the failure to comply with appellate procedure was the result of ineffective assistance of

Per Curiam
counsel. The Court did not hold, as respondent argues andthe Eighth Circuit seemed to conclude, that due process requires state courts to provide for appellate review where thewould-be appellant has not satisfied reasonable preconditions
on her right to appeal as a result of her own conduct. Evitts
turned on the right to effective assistance of counsel; it leftintact "the States' ability to conduct appeals in accordance

with reasonable procedural rules." Id., at 398-399.Branch argues that even if

Teague does apply, the rule
announced by the Eighth Circuit falls into Teague's exceptionfor " `watershed rules of criminal procedure' implicating the

fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding." Saffle v. Parks, supra, at 495 (citing Teague, supra,
at 311). The new rule here is not among the "small core
of rules requiring observance of those procedures that . . .
are `implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.' " Graham,
supra, at 478 (some internal quotation marks omitted; citations omitted). Because due process does not require a
State to provide appellate process at all, Evitts, supra, at
393; McKane v. Durston, 153 U. S. 684, 687 (1894), a former
fugitive's right to appeal cannot be said to " `be so central to
an accurate determination of innocence or guilt,' " Graham,
supra, at 478 (quoting Teague, supra, at 313), as to fall within
this exception to the Teague bar.

As we explained in Allen v. Georgia, supra, at 140, where
the Court upheld against constitutional attack the dismissal
of the petition of a fugitive whose appeal was pending, "if
the Supreme Court of a State has acted in consonance with
the constitutional laws of a State and its own procedure, it
could only be in very exceptional circumstances that this
court would feel justified in saying that there had been a
failure of due legal process. We might ourselves have pursued a different course in this case, but that is not the test."
The Eighth Circuit converted a rule for the administration
of the federal courts into a constitutional one. We do not
(and we may not, in the face of the State's invocation of

Teague) reach the merits of that contention. The resultreached by the Court of Appeals was neither dictated nor

compelled by existing precedent when Branch's convictionbecame final, and Teague prevents its application to her case.
The petition for certiorari is granted, and the judgment ofthe Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 93-1783. Argued January 9, 1995--Decided March 21, 1995
The Director of the Labor Department's Office of Workers' Compensation

Programs petitioned the Court of Appeals for review of a Benefits
Review Board decision that, inter alia, denied Jackie Harcum fulldisability compensation under the Longshore and Harbor Workers'
Compensation Act (LHWCA). Harcum did not seek review and, while
not opposing the Director's pursuit of the action, expressly declined to
intervene on his own behalf in response to an inquiry by the court.
Acting sua sponte, the court concluded that the Director lacked standing to appeal the benefits denial because she was not "adversely affected
or aggrieved" thereby within the meaning of $ 21(c) of the Act, 33
U. S. C. $ 921(c).

Held: The Director is not "adversely affected or aggrieved" under

$ 921(c). Pp. 125-136.

(a) Section 921(c) does not apply to an agency acting as a regulator
or administrator under the statute. This is strongly suggested by the
fact that, despite long use of the phrase "adversely affected or aggrieved" as a term of art to designate those who have standing to appeal
a federal agency decision, no case has held that an agency, without benefit of specific authorization to appeal, falls within that designation; by
the fact that the United States Code's general judicial review provision,
5 U. S. C. $ 702, which employs the phrase "adversely affected or aggrieved," specifically excludes agencies from the category of persons
covered, $ 551(2); and by the clear evidence in the Code that when an
agency in its governmental capacity is meant to have standing, Congress says so, see, e. g., 29 U. S. C. $$ 660(a) and (b). While the text of
a particular statute could make clear that "adversely affected or aggrieved" is being used in a peculiar sense, the Director points to no such
text in the LHWCA. Pp. 125-130.

(b) Neither of the categories of interest asserted by the Director
demonstrates that "adversely affected or aggrieved" in this statute must
have an extraordinary meaning. The Director's interest in ensuring
adequate payments to claimants is insufficient. Agencies do not automatically have standing to sue for actions that frustrate the purposes

of their statutes; absent some clear and distinctive responsibility conferred upon the agency, an "adversely affected or aggrieved" judicial
review provision leaves private interests (even those favored by public
policy) to be vindicated by private parties. Heckman v. United States,

427 U. S. 424; and General Telephone Co. of Northwest v. EEOC, 446
U. S. 318, distinguished. Also insufficient is the Director's asserted interest in fulfilling important administrative and enforcement responsibilities. She fails to identify any specific statutory duties that an erroneous Board ruling interferes with, reciting instead conjectural harms
to abstract and remote concerns. Pp. 130-136.

PROGRAMS v. NEWPORT NEWS SHIPBUILDING & DRY DOCK CO.

Opinion of the Court

I
On October 24, 1984, Jackie Harcum, an employee of re-spondent Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co.,

was working in the bilge of a steam barge when a piece ofmetal grating fell and struck him in the lower back. His
injury required surgery to remove a herniated disc, andcaused prolonged disability. Respondent paid Harcum benefits under the LHWCA until he returned to light-duty workin April 1987. In November 1987, Harcum returned to his
regular department under medical restrictions. He provedunable to perform essential tasks, however, and the company
terminated his employment in May 1988. Harcum ulti-mately found work elsewhere, and started his new job in
February 1989.Harcum filed a claim for further benefits under the
LHWCA. Respondent contested the claim, and the disputewas referred to an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). One
of the issues was whether Harcum was entitled to benefitsfor total disability, or instead only for partial disability, from
the date he stopped work for respondent until he began hisnew job. "Disability" under the LHWCA means "incapacity
because of injury to earn the wages which the employee wasreceiving at the time of injury in the same or any other employment." 33 U. S. C. $ 902(10).After a hearing on October 20, 1989, the ALJ determined
that Harcum was partially, rather than totally, disabled whenhe left respondent's employ, and that he was therefore owed
only partial-disability benefits for the interval of his unem-ployment. On appeal, the Benefits Review Board affirmed
the ALJ's judgment, and also ruled that under 33 U. S. C.$ 908(f), the company was entitled to cease payments to Harcum after 104 weeks, after which time the LHWCA specialfund would be liable for disbursements pursuant to $ 944.

The Director petitioned the United States Court of Ap-peals for the Fourth Circuit for review of both aspects of the
Board's ruling. Harcum did not seek review and, while not

decision is in turn appealable to a United States court ofappeals, at the instance of "[a]ny person adversely affected

or aggrieved by" the Board's order. $ 921(c).With regard to claims that proceed to ALJ hearings, the
Act does not by its terms make the Director a party to the
proceedings, or grant her authority to prosecute appeals tothe Board, or thence to the federal courts of appeals. The

Director argues that she nonetheless had standing to peti-tion the Fourth Circuit for review of the Board's order, because she is a "person adversely affected or aggrieved" under$ 921(c). Specifically, she contends the Board's decision injures her because it impairs her ability to achieve the Act's
purposes and to perform the administrative duties the Act
prescribes.

The phrase "person adversely affected or aggrieved" is a
term of art used in many statutes to designate those who
have standing to challenge or appeal an agency decision,
within the agency or before the courts. See, e. g., federal
Communications Act of 1934, 47 U. S. C. $ 402(b)(6); Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, 29 U. S. C. $ 660(a); Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, 30 U. S. C. $ 816.
The terms "adversely affected" and "aggrieved," alone or in
combination, have a long history in federal administrative
law, dating back at least to the federal Communications
Act of 1934, $ 402(b)(2) (codified, as amended, 47 U. S. C.

$ 402(b)(6)). They were already familiar terms in 1946,
when they were embodied within the judicial review provision of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C.

$ 702, which entitles "[a] person . . . adversely affected or
aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant
statute" to judicial review. In that provision, the qualification "within the meaning of a relevant statute" is not an addition to what "adversely affected or aggrieved" alone conveys;
but is rather an acknowledgment of the fact that what constitutes adverse effect or aggrievement varies from statute
to statute. As the United States Department of Justice, At514us1$36K 05-27-98 14:36:59 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
torney General's Manual on the Administrative ProcedureAct (1947) put it, "The determination of who is `adversely

affected or aggrieved . . . within the meaning of any relevantstatute' has `been marked out largely by the gradual judicial
process of inclusion and exclusion, aided at times by thecourts' judgment as to the probable legislative intent derived
from the spirit of the statutory scheme.' " Id., at 96 (citationomitted). We have thus interpreted $ 702 as requiring a litigant to show, at the outset of the case, that he is injured infact by agency action and that the interest he seeks to vindicate is arguably within the "zone of interests to be protectedor regulated by the statute" in question.

Association of
Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397U. S. 150, 153 (1970); see also Clarke v. Securities Industry

Assn., 479 U. S. 388, 395-396 (1987).Given the long lineage of the text in question, it is significant that counsel have cited to us no case, neither in thisCourt nor in the courts of appeals, neither under the APA
nor under individual statutory-review provisions such as thepresent one, which holds that, without benefit of specific authorization to appeal, an agency, in its regulatory or policy-making capacity, is "adversely affected" or "aggrieved." Cf.
Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Perini North River Associates, 459 U. S. 297, 302-305 (1983)(noting the issue of whether the Director has standing under

$ 921(c), but finding it unnecessary to reach the question).2

2 In addition to not reaching the $ 921(c) question, Perini also took as a
given (because it had been conceded below) the answer to another question: whether the Director (rather than the Benefits Review Board) is the
proper party respondent to an appeal from the Board's determination.
See 459 U. S., at 304, n. 13. Obviously, an agency's entitlement to party
respondent status does not necessarily imply that agency's standing

to appeal: The National Labor Relations Board, for example, is always
the party respondent to an employer or employee appeal, but cannot
initiate an appeal from its own determination. 29 U. S. C. $$ 152(1),
160(f). Indeed, it can be argued, as amici in this case have done, that if
the Director is the proper party respondent in the court of appeals (as her

PROGRAMS v. NEWPORT NEWS SHIPBUILDING & DRY DOCK CO.

Opinion of the Court

There are cases in which an agency has been held to be adversely affected or aggrieved in what might be called its nongovernmental capacity--that is, in its capacity as a member
of the market group that the statute was meant to protect.
For example, in United States v. ICC, 337 U. S. 426 (1949),
we held that the United States had standing to sue the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in federal court to overturn a Commission order that denied the Government recovery of damages for an allegedly unlawful railroad rate. The
Government, we said, "is not less entitled than any other
shipper to invoke administrative and judicial protection."
Id., at 430.3 But the status of the Government as a statutory beneficiary or market participant must be sharply distinguished from the status of the Government as regulator
or administrator.

The latter status would be at issue if--to use an example
that continues the ICC analogy--the Environmental Protecregulations assert, see 20 CFR $ 802.410 (1994)), in initiating an appeal
she would end up on both sides of the case. See Brief for National Association of Waterfront Employers et al. as Amici Curiae 17, n. 14. Our
opinion today intimates no view on the party-respondent question.

3 United States v. ICC accorded the United States standing despite the

facts that (1) the Interstate Commerce Act contained no specific judicial
review provision, and (2) the APA's general judicial review provision ("person adversely affected or aggrieved") excludes agencies from the definition
of "person." See infra, at 129. It would thus appear that an agency
suing in what might be termed a nongovernmental capacity escapes that
definitional limitation. The LHWCA likewise contains a definition of
"person" that does not specifically include agencies. 33 U. S. C. $ 902(1).
We chose not to rely upon that provision in this opinion because it seemed
more likely to sweep in the question of the Director's authority to appeal
Board rulings that are adverse to the $ 944 special fund, which deserves
separate attention. It is possible that the Director's status as manager
of the privately financed fund removes her from the "person" limitation,
just as it may remove her from the more general limitation that agencies
qua agencies are not "adversely affected or aggrieved." We leave those
issues to be resolved in a case where the Director's relationship to the
fund is immediately before us.

tion Agency sued to overturn an ICC order establishing hightariffs for the transportation of recyclable materials. Cf.

United States v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency
Procedures (SCRAP), 412 U. S. 669 (1973). Or if the Department of Transportation, to further a policy of encouraging so-called "telecommuting" in order to reduce traffic con-gestion, sued as a "party aggrieved" under 28 U. S. C. $ 2344,

to reverse the Federal Communications Commission's ap-proval of rate increases on second phone lines used for modems. We are aware of no case in which such a "policy in-terest" by an agency has sufficed to confer standing under
an "adversely affected or aggrieved" statute or any other
general review provision. To acknowledge the general adequacy of such an interest would put the federal courts into
the regular business of deciding intrabranch and intraagency
policy disputes--a role that would be most inappropriate.

That an agency in its governmental capacity is not "adversely affected or aggrieved" is strongly suggested, as well,
by two aspects of the United States Code: First, the fact that
the Code's general judicial review provision, contained in the
APA, does not include agencies within the category of "person adversely affected or aggrieved." See 5 U. S. C. $ 551(2)
(excepting agencies from the definition of "person"). Since,
as we suggested in United States v. ICC, the APA provision
reflects "the general legislative pattern of administrative
and judicial relationships," 337 U. S., at 433-434, it indicates that even under specific "adversely affected or aggrieved" statutes (there were a number extant when the
APA was adopted) agencies as such normally do not have
standing. And second, the United States Code displays
throughout that when an agency in its governmental capacity is meant to have standing, Congress says so. The
LHWCA's silence regarding the Secretary's ability to take
an appeal is significant when laid beside other provisions of
law. See, e. g., Black Lung Benefits Act (BLBA), 30 U. S. C.

relative to [a] claim for benefits"); Title VII of the CivilRights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-5(f)(1) (authorizing the Attorney General to initiate civil actions against pri-vate employers) and $ 2000e-4(g)(6) (authorizing the Equal
Employment Opportunities Commission to "intervene in acivil action brought . . . by an aggrieved party . . ."); Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U. S. C.$ 1132(a)(2) (granting Secretary power to initiate various
civil actions under the Act). It is particularly illuminatingto compare the LHWCA with the Occupational Safety and
Health Act of 1970 (OSHA), 29 U. S. C. $ 651 et seq. Section660(a) of OSHA is virtually identical to $ 921(c): It allows
"[a]ny person adversely affected or aggrieved" by an orderof the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission
(a body distinct from the Secretary, as the Benefits ReviewBoard is) to petition for review in the courts of appeals.
OSHA, however, further contains a $ 660(b), which expresslygrants such petitioning authority to the Secretary--suggesting, of course, that the Secretary would not be considered"adversely affected or aggrieved" under $ 660(a), and should
not be considered so under $ 921(c).All of the foregoing indicates that the phrase "person adversely affected or aggrieved" does not refer to an agencyacting in its governmental capacity. Of course the text of a
particular statute could make clear that the phrase is beingused in a peculiar sense. But the Director points to no such
text in the LHWCA, and relies solely upon the mere exist-ence and impairment of her governmental interest. If that
alone could ever suffice to contradict the normal meaning ofthe phrase (which is doubtful), it would have to be an interest
of an extraordinary nature, extraordinarily impaired. Aswe proceed to discuss, that is not present here.

III
The LHWCA assigns four broad areas of responsibilityto the Director: (1) supervising, administering, and making

514us1$36K 05-27-98 14:36:59 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
rules and regulations for calculation of benefits and processing of claims, 33 U. S. C. $$ 906, 908-910, 914, 919, 930, and
939; (2) supervising, administering, and making rules and
regulations for provision of medical care to covered workers,

$ 907; (3) assisting claimants with processing claims and receiving medical and vocational rehabilitation, $ 939(c); and (4)
enforcing compensation orders and administering payments
to and disbursements from the special fund established by
the Act for the payment of certain benefits, $$ 921(d) and
944. The Director does not assert that the Board's decision
hampers her performance of these express statutory responsibilities. She claims only two categories of interest that
are affected, neither of which remotely suggests that she has
authority to appeal Board determinations.

First, the Director claims that because the LHWCA "has
many of the elements of social insurance, and as such is designed to promote the public interest," Brief for Petitioner
17, she has standing to "advance in federal court the public
interest in ensuring adequate compensation payments to
claimants," id., at 18. It is doubtful, to begin with, that the
goal of the LHWCA is simply the support of disabled workers. In fact, we have said that, because "the LHWCA represents a compromise between the competing interests of
disabled laborers and their employers," it "is not correct to
interpret the Act as guaranteeing a completely adequate
remedy for all covered disabilities." Potomac Elec. Power
Co. v. Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs,
449 U. S. 268, 282 (1980). The LHWCA is a scheme for fair
and efficient resolution of a class of private disputes, managed and arbitered by the Government. It represents a
"quid pro quo between employer and employee. Employers
relinquish certain legal rights which the law affords to them
and so, in turn, do the employees." 1 M. Norris, The Law
of Maritime Personal Injuries $ 4.1, p. 106 (4th ed. 1990) (emphasis added).

132 DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION
PROGRAMS v. NEWPORT NEWS SHIPBUILDING & DRY DOCK CO.

Opinion of the Court

But even assuming the single-minded, compensate-the-employee goal that the Director posits, there is nothing to

suggest that the Director has been given authority to pursuethat goal in the courts. Agencies do not automatically have
standing to sue for actions that frustrate the purposes of
their statutes. The Interior Department, being chargedwith the duty to "protect persons and property within areas

of the National Park System," 16 U. S. C. $ 1a-6(a), does notthereby have authority to intervene in suits for assault
brought by campers; or (more precisely) to bring a suit forassault when the camper declines to do so. What the Director must establish here is such a clear and distinctive responsibility for employee compensation as to overcome the
universal assumption that "person adversely affected or
aggrieved" leaves private interests (even those favored by
public policy) to be litigated by private parties. That we
are unable to find. The Director is not the designated champion of employees within this statutory scheme. To the contrary, one of her principal roles is to serve as the broker of
informal settlements between employers and employees. 33
U. S. C. $ 914(h). She is charged, moreover, with providing
"information and assistance" regarding the program to all
persons covered by the Act, including employers. $$ 902(1),
939(c). To be sure, she has discretion under $ 939(c) to provide "legal assistance in processing a claim" if it is requested
(a provision that is perhaps of little consequence, since the
Act provides attorney's fees to successful claimants, see

$ 928); but that authority, which is discretionary with her and
contingent upon a request by the claimant, does not evidence
the duty and power, when the claimant is satisfied with his
award, to contest the award on her own.

The Director argues that her standing to pursue the public's interest in adequate compensation of claimants is supported by our decisions in Heckman v. United States, 224
U. S. 413 (1912), Moe v. Confederated Salish and Kootenai

dena City Bd. of Ed. v. Spangler, 427 U. S. 424 (1976), and
General Telephone Co. of Northwest v. EEOC, 446 U. S. 318
(1980). Brief for Petitioner 18. None of those cases is ap-posite.

Heckman and Moe pertain to the United States'
standing to represent the interests of Indians; the former
holds, see 224 U. S., at 437, and the latter indicates in dictum,see 425 U. S., at 474, n. 13, that the Government's status as

guardian confers standing. The third case, Spangler, supra,at 427, based standing of the United States upon an explicit
provision of Title IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 authoriz-ing suit, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000h-2, and the last,

General Telephone Co., supra, at 325, based standing of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) upon a specific
provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 authorizing suit, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-5(f )(1). Those two cases certainly establish that Congress could have conferred standing
upon the Director without infringing Article III of the Constitution; but they do not at all establish that Congress did
so. In fact, General Telephone Co. suggests just the opposite, since it describes how, prior to the 1972 amendment
specifically giving the EEOC authority to sue, only the "aggrieved person" could bring suit, even though the EEOC was
authorized to use " `informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion' " to eliminate unlawful employment
practices, 446 U. S., at 325--an authority similar to the Director's informal settlement authority here.

The second category of interest claimed to be affected by
erroneous Board rulings is the Director's ability to fulfill
"important administrative and enforcement responsibilities."
Brief for Petitioner 18. The Director fails, however, to identify any specific statutory duties that an erroneous Board
ruling interferes with, reciting instead conjectural harms to
abstract and remote concerns. She contends, for example,
that "incorrect claim determinations by the Board frustrate
[her] duty to administer and enforce the statutory scheme in
a uniform manner." Id., at 18-19. But it is impossible to

Opinion of the Court

understand how a duty of uniform administration and enforcement by the Director (presumably arising out of the
prohibition of arbitrary action reflected in 5 U. S. C. $ 706)hinges upon correct

adjudication by someone else. The Director does not (and we think cannot) explain, for example,
how an erroneous decision by the Board affects her abilityto process the underlying claim, $ 919, provide information

and assistance regarding coverage, compensation, and proce-dures, $ 939(c), enforce the final award, $ 921(d), or perform
any other required task in a "uniform" manner.If the correctness of adjudications were essential to the
Director's performance of her assigned duties, Congress
would presumably have done what it has done with many
other agencies: made adjudication her responsibility. In fact,
however, it has taken pains to remove adjudication from her
realm. The LHWCA Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 1251,
assigned administration to the Director, 33 U. S. C. $ 939(a);
assigned initial adjudication to ALJ's, $ 919(d); and created
the Board to consider appeals from ALJ decisions, $ 921.
The assertion that proper adjudication is essential to proper
performance of the Director's functions is quite simply contrary to the whole structure of the Act. To make an implausible argument even worse, the Director must acknowledge
that her lack of control over the adjudicative process does not
even deprive her of the power to resolve legal ambiguities in
the statute. She retains the rulemaking power, see $ 939(a),
which means that if her problem with the present decision
of the Board is that it has established an erroneous rule of
law, see Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense
Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984), she has full power to alter
that rule. See Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505
U. S. 469, 476 (1992) ("[T]he [Board] is not entitled to any
special deference"). Her only possible complaint, then, is
that she does not agree with the outcome of this particular
case. The Director also claims that precluding her from
seeking review of erroneous Board rulings "would reduce

Opinion of the Court
the incentive for employers to view the Director's informalresolution efforts as authoritative, because the employer

could proceed to a higher level of review from which theDirector could not appeal." Brief for Petitioner 19. This
argument assumes that her informal resolution efforts are
supposed to be "authoritative." We doubt that. The struc-ture of the statute suggests that they are supposed to be

facilitative--a service to both parties, rather than an imposi-tion upon either of them. But even if the opposite were
true, we doubt that the unlikely prospect that the Directorwill appeal

when the claimant does not will have much of
an impact upon whether the employer chooses to spurn the
Director's settlement proposal and roll the dice before the
Board. The statutory requirement of adverse effect or aggrievement must be based upon "something more than an
ingenious academic exercise in the conceivable." United
States v. SCRAP, 412 U. S., at 688.

The Director seeks to derive support for her position from
Congress' later enactment of the BLBA in 1978, but it seems
to us that the BLBA militates precisely against her position.
The BLBA expressly provides that "[t]he Secretary shall be
a party in any proceeding relative to a claim for benefits
under this part." 30 U. S. C. $ 932(k). The Director argues
that since the Secretary is explicitly made a party under the
BLBA, she must be meant to be a party under the LHWCA
as well. That is not a form of reasoning we are familiar
with. The normal conclusion one would derive from putting
these statutes side by side is this: When, in a legislative
scheme of this sort, Congress wants the Secretary to have
standing, it says so.

Finally, the Director retreats to that last redoubt of losing
causes, the proposition that the statute at hand should be
liberally construed to achieve its purposes, see, e. g., Northeast Marine Terminal Co. v. Caputo, 432 U. S. 249, 268
(1977). That principle may be invoked, in case of ambiguity,
to find present rather than absent elements that are essential

to operation of a legislative scheme; but it does not add fea-tures that will achieve the statutory "purposes" more effectively. Every statute purposes, not only to achieve certainends, but also to achieve them by particular means--and
there is often a considerable legislative battle over whatthose means ought to be. The withholding of agency authority is as significant as the granting of it, and we have no rightto play favorites between the two. Construing the LHWCA
as liberally as can be, we cannot find that the Director is"adversely affected or aggrieved" within the meaning of

$ 921(c). * * *

For these reasons, the judgment of the United StatesCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is affirmed.

So ordered.
Justice Ginsburg, concurring in the judgment.
The Court holds that the Director of the Office of Workers'Compensation Programs of the United States Department of

Labor (OWCP) lacks standing under $ 21(c) of the Longshoreand Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA or Act),
44 Stat. 1424, as amended, 33 U. S. C. $ 901 et seq., to seekjudicial review of LHWCA claim determinations. Before
amendment of the LHWCA in 1972, the Act's administratorhad authority to seek review of LHWCA claim determinations in the courts of appeals. The Court reads the 1972amendments as divesting the Act's administrator of access to
federal appellate tribunals formerly open to the administra-tor's petitions. The practical effect of the Court's ruling is
to order a disparity between two compensatory schemes--the LHWCA and the Black Lung Benefits Act (BLBA), 83
Stat. 792, as amended, 30 U. S. C. $ 901 et seq.--measuresthat Congress intended to work in essentially the same way.

Significantly, however, the Court observes that our prece-dent "certainly establish[es] that Congress could have con514us1$36p 05-27-98 14:36:59 PAGES OPINPGT

ferred standing upon the [OWCP] Director without infringing Article III of the Constitution." Ante, at 133 (emphasis
in original).1 While I do not challenge the Court's conclusion that the Director lacks standing under the amended Act,
I write separately because I am convinced that Congress did
not advert to the change--the withdrawal of the LHWCA
administrator's access to judicial review--wrought by the
1972 LHWCA amendments. Since no Article III impediment stands in its way, Congress may speak the final word
by determining whether and how to correct its apparent
oversight.

I

Before the 1972 amendments to the LHWCA, the OWCP
Director's predecessors as administrators of the Act, officials
called OWCP deputy commissioners, adjudicated LHWCA
claims in the first instance. 33 U. S. C. $$ 919, 923 (1970 ed.);
see Kalaris v. Donovan, 697 F. 2d 376, 381-382 (CADC), cert.

claim determination could be challenged in federal district

Boat Sales, Inc., 314 U. S. 244, 245 (1941). As a defending
party in district courts, the deputy commissioner could appeal adverse rulings to the courts of appeals pursuant to 28

alia, Parker, supra).

The 1972 LHWCA amendments shifted the deputy com-missioners' adjudicatory authority to Department of Labor

administrative law judges (ALJ's). Although district directors--as deputy commissioners are now called 2--are empow-ered to investigate LHWCA claims and attempt to resolve

them informally, they must order a hearing before an ALJupon a party's request. 33 U. S. C. $ 919. The 1972 amendments also replaced district court injunctive actions with ap-peals to the newly created Benefits Review Board. Just as
the deputy commissioners were parties before district courtsprior to 1972, the Director--as the Secretary's delegate--is
a party before the Benefits Review Board under the currentscheme. 20 CFR $ 801.2(a)(10) (1994). Either the Director
or another party may invoke Board review of an ALJ's decision. 33 U. S. C. $ 921(b)(3); 20 CFR $$ 801.102, 801.2(a)(10)
(1994). As before the amendments, further review is available in the courts of appeals. 33 U. S. C. $ 921(c).

The Court holds that the LHWCA, as amended in 1972,
does not entitle the Director to appeal Benefits Review
Board decisions to the courts of appeals. Congress surely
decided to transfer adjudicative functions from the deputy
commissioners to ALJ's, and from the district courts to the
Benefits Review Board. But there is scant reason to believe
that Congress consciously decided to strip the Act's administrator of authority that official once had to seek judicial review of claim determinations adverse to the administrator's
position. In amending the LHWCA in 1972, Congress did
not expressly address the standing of the Secretary of Labor
or his delegate to petition for judicial review. Congress did
use the standard phrase "person adversely affected or aggrieved" to describe proper petitioners to the courts of appeals. See 33 U. S. C. $ 921(c). But it is doubtful that Con2 20 CFR $$ 701.301(a)(7), 702.105 (1994).

gress comprehended the full impact of that phrase: Not onlydoes it qualify employers and injured workers to seek judicial review but, as interpreted, it ordinarily disqualifies agen-cies acting in a governmental capacity from petitioning for
court review.3 II

Congress' 1978 revision of the BLBA reveals the judicialreview design Congress ordered when it consciously attended to this matter. The 1978 BLBA amendments wereadopted, in part, to keep adjudication of BLBA claims under
the same procedural regime as the one Congress devised forLHWCA claims. In the 1978 BLBA prescriptions, Congress expressly provided for the party status of the OWCPDirector. See 30 U. S. C. $ 932(k) ("The Secretary [of Labor]
shall be a party in any proceeding relative to a claim for[black lung] benefits.").

Congress enacted the BLBA in 1969 to afford compensa-tion to coal miners and their survivors for death or disability
caused by pneumoconiosis (black lung disease). See Useryv. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U. S. 1, 8 (1976). The
BLBA generally adopts the claims adjudication schemeof the LHWCA. 30 U. S. C. $ 932(a). Congress amended
the BLBA in 1978 to clarify that the BLBA continuouslyincorporates LHWCA claim adjudication procedures. See

$ 7(a)(1), 92 Stat. 98 (amending BLBA to incorporateLHWCA "as it may be amended from time to time"); S. Rep.
No. 95-209, p. 18 (1977) (BLBA amendment "makes clearthat any and all amendments to the [LHWCA]" are incorporated by the BLBA, including "the 1972 amendments relat-ing to the use of Administrative Law Judges in claims
adjudication").

compared with the role of an advocate general or ministe`re public in civil
law proceedings. See generally M. Glendon, M. Gordon, & C. Osakwe,

Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment

In the context of assuring automatic application of
LHWCA procedures to black lung claims, see H. R. Conf.
Rep. No. 95-864, pp. 22-23 (1978), Congress added to the
BLBA the provision for the Secretary of Labor's party status "in any proceeding relative to a claim for [black lung]
benefits." See $ 7(k), 92 Stat. 99. According to the Report
of the Senate Committee on Human Resources:

"Some question has arisen as to whether the adjudication procedures applicable to black lung claims incorporating various sections of the amended [LHWCA]
confe[r] standing upon the Secretary of Labor or his
designee to appear, present evidence, file appeals or respond to appeals filed with respect to the litigation and
appeal of claims. In establishing the [LHWCA] procedures it was the intent of this Committee to afford the
Secretary the right to advance his views in the formal
claims litigation context whether or not the Secretary
had a direct financial interest in the outcome of the
case. The Secretary's interest as the officer charged
with the responsibility for carrying forth the intent of
Congress with respect to the [BLBA] should be deemed
sufficient to confer standing on the Secretary or such
designee of the Secretary who has the responsibility for
the enforcement of the [BLBA], to actively participate
in the adjudication of claims before the Administrative
Law Judge, Benefits Review Board, and appropriate
United States Courts." S. Rep. No. 95-209, supra, at
21-22 (emphasis added).

Even if this passage cannot force an uncommon reading
of the LHWCA words "person adversely affected or aggrieved," see ante, at 130, it strongly indicates that Congress
considered vital to sound administration of the Act the administrator's access to court review.

ANDERSON, DIRECTOR, CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES, et al. v.

EDWARDS, guardian ad litem for

EDWARDS, et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 93-1883. Argued January 18, 1995--Decided March 22, 1995
The federal "family filing unit rule," 42 U. S. C. $ 602(a)(38), requires that

all cohabiting nuclear family members be grouped into a single "assistance unit" (AU) for purposes of eligibility and benefits determinations
under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program.
California's "non-sibling filing unit rule" (California Rule) additionally
groups into a single AU all needy children who live in the same household, whether or not they are siblings, if there is only one adult caring
for them. When application of the California Rule resulted in decreases in the maximum per capita AFDC benefits due respondents,
who include Verna Edwards and her cohabiting dependent minor granddaughter and two grandnieces, they brought this action for declaratory
and injunctive relief against petitioners, the state officials charged with
administering California's AFDC program, claiming that the California
Rule violates federal law. The District Court granted summary judgment for respondents, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: Federal law does not prohibit California from grouping into a single

AU all needy children living in the same household under the care of
one relative. Pp. 149-158.

(a) The California Rule does not violate 45 CFR $ 233.20(a)(2)(viii),
an AFDC regulation prohibiting States from reducing the amount of
assistance "solely because of the presence in the household of a nonlegally responsible individual." Respondents are simply wrong when
they contend that, e. g., it was solely the arrival in Mrs. Edwards' home
of her grandnieces that triggered a decline in the per capita benefits
that previously were paid to her granddaughter; rather, it was the
grandnieces' presence plus their application for AFDC assistance
through Mrs. Edwards. Had the grandnieces, after coming to live with
Mrs. Edwards, either not applied for assistance or applied through
a different caretaker relative living in the home, the California
Rule would not have affected the granddaughter's benefits at all.

(b) Nor does the California Rule violate 45 CFR $$ 233.20(a)(2)(viii),
233.20(a)(3)(ii)(D), and 233.90(a)(1), which prohibit States from assuming
that a cohabitant's income is available to a needy child absent a casespecific determination that it is actually or legally available. First, the
California Rule does not necessarily reduce the benefits of all needy
children when one of them receives outside income, for California may
rationally assume that the caretaker will observe her duties to all of the
AU's members and will take into account the receipt of any such income
by one child when expending funds on behalf of the AU. Second, the
California Rule simply authorizes the combination of incomes of all AU
members in order to determine the amount of the AU's assistance payment. This accords with the very definition of an AU as the group of
individuals whose income and resources are considered "as a unit" in
determining the amount of benefits, 45 CFR $ 206.10(b)(5), and is authorized by the AFDC statute itself, 42 U. S. C. $ 602(a)(7)(A), which provides that a state agency "shall, in determining need, take into consideration any . . . income and resources of any child or relative claiming
[AFDC assistance]." In light of the great latitude that States have in
administering their AFDC programs, see, e. g., Dandridge v. Williams,
397 U. S. 471, 478, that statute is reasonably construed to allow States,
in determining a child's need (and therefore the amount of her assistance), to consider the income and resources of all cohabiting children
and relatives also claiming assistance. The availability regulations are
addressed to an entirely different problem: attempts by States to count
income and resources controlled by persons outside the AU for the purpose of determining the amount of the AU's assistance. See 42 Fed.
Reg. 6583-6584, and, e. g., King v. Smith, 392 U. S. 309. The California
Rule has no such effect. Pp. 152-155.

(c) Respondents' alternative arguments--(1) that the federal family
filing unit rule occupies the field and thereby pre-empts California from
adopting its Rule, and (2) that the California Rule violates 45 CFR

$$ 233.10(a)(1) and 233.20(a)(1)(i), which require equitable treatment
among AFDC recipients--lack merit. Pp. 156-158.

146 ANDERSON v. EDWARDS

Opinion of the Court
"assistance unit" all needy children who live in the samehousehold under the care of one relative. Such grouping

allows States to grant equal assistance to equally sizedneedy households, regardless of whether the children in the
household are all siblings. The Court of Appeals for theNinth Circuit concluded that federal law forbids States to
equalize assistance in this manner. We disagree and accord-ingly reverse.

I
AFDC is a joint federal-state public assistance programauthorized by Title IV-A of the Social Security Act, 49 Stat.

627, 42 U. S. C. $ 601 et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. V). As itsname indicates, the AFDC program "is designed to provide
financial assistance to needy dependent children and the par-ents or relatives who live with and care for them." Shea v.
Vialpando, 416 U. S. 251, 253 (1974). The program "reim-burses each State which chooses to participate with a percentage of the funds it expends," so long as the State "admin-ister[s] its assistance program pursuant to a state plan that
conforms to applicable federal statutes and regulations."
Heckler v. Turner, 470 U. S. 184, 189 (1985) (citing 42 U. S. C.$$ 602, 603).

One applicable federal rule requires state plans to providethat all members of a nuclear family who live in the same
household must apply for AFDC assistance if any one ofthem applies; in addition, the income of all of these applicants
must be aggregated in determining their eligibility andthe amount of their monthly benefits. See 42 U. S. C.

$ 602(a)(38) (1988 ed., Supp. V); 45 CFR $ 206.10(a)(1)(vii)(1993). See generally

Bowen v. Gilliard, 483 U. S. 587(1987) (upholding rule against constitutional challenges).

This "family filing unit rule" requires that all cohabiting nu-clear family members be grouped into a single AFDC "assistance unit" (AU), defined by federal law as "the group of indi-viduals whose income, resources and needs are considered as
a unit for purposes of determining eligibility and the amount

of payment." 45 CFR $ 206.10(b)(5) (1993). The regulation
at issue in this case--California's "non-sibling filing unit
rule" (California Rule)--goes even further in this regard.
It provides: "Two or more AUs in the same home shall
be combined into one AU when . . . [t]here is only one [adult]
caretaker relative." Cal. Dept. of Social Servs., Manual of
Policies & Procedures $ 82-824.1.13, App. to Pet. for Cert.
52. In other words, the California Rule groups into a single
AU all needy children who live in the same household,
whether or not they are siblings, if there is only one adult
caring for all of them.

The consolidation of two or more AU's into a single AU
pursuant to the California Rule results in a decrease in the
maximum per capita AFDC benefits for which the affected
individuals are eligible. This occurs because, while California (like many States) increases the amount of assistance
for each additional person added to an AU, the increase is
not proportional. Thus, as the number of persons in the
AU increases, the per capita payment to the AU decreases.1

1 Between July 1, 1989, and August 31, 1991, California adhered to the
following schedule of maximum monthly AFDC payments:

Number of Maximum aid Per capita
persons in AU payment payment

1 $ 341 $341.00

148 ANDERSON v. EDWARDS

Opinion of the Court
See, e. g., Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U. S. 471, 473-474(1970) (sustaining a Maryland AFDC regulation under which

"the standard of need increases with each additional personin the household, but the increments become proportionately smaller").

The situation of respondent Verna Edwards and her rela-tives illustrates the operation of these two rules. Initially,

Mrs. Edwards received AFDC assistance on behalf of hergranddaughter, for whom she is the sole caretaker.

2 As a

one-person AU, the granddaughter was eligible to receive a"maximum aid payment" of $341 per month prior to September 1991. See n. 1, supra. Later, Mrs. Edwards began car-ing for her two grandnieces, who are siblings. Pursuant to
the federal family filing unit rule, the grandnieces aregrouped together in a two-person AU, which was eligible to
receive $560 per month in benefits prior to September 1991.
See ibid. Because none of these children received any outside income, Mrs. Edwards received $901 per month in
AFDC assistance on behalf of the three girls. In June 1991,
however, Mrs. Edwards received notice that pursuant to the
California Rule, her granddaughter and two grandnieces
would be grouped together into a single three-person AU,
which was eligible to receive only $694 per month. See ibid.
The California Rule thus reduced AFDC payments to the
Edwards household by $207 per month.

On behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, Mrs.
Edwards, her three relatives, and other respondents brought
this action against petitioners, the state officials charged
with administering California's AFDC program, in the DisCal. Welf. & Inst. Code Ann. $ 11450(a)(1) (West Supp. 1994), as modified
by $$ 11450.01(a), (b) and 11450.015(a).

2 Mrs. Edwards does not receive AFDC assistance for herself. As explained in the text, the family filing unit rule requires parents to apply for
assistance along with their children. But apart from this rule, caretaker
relatives need not apply for assistance along with the needy children for
whom they care, although they may do so.

trict Court for the Eastern District of California. Pursuantto Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, respondents sought a

declaration that the California Rule violates federal law andan injunction prohibiting petitioners from enforcing it. On
cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Courtgranted the requested relief. It found the California Rule
indistinguishable in relevant respects from the Washingtonregulation invalidated in

Beaton v. Thompson, 913 F. 2d 701(CA9 1990).

In a brief opinion, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-cuit affirmed. It found the California Rule "virtually identical" to the Washington regulation that Beaton had held tobe "inconsistent with federal law and regulation."

Edwardsv. Healy, 12 F. 3d 154, 155 (1993). Since the Court of Appeals issued its decision, the Department of Health andHuman Services (HHS)--which administers the AFDC program on the federal level--determined that its own AFDCregulations "do not conflict with the State policy option to
consolidate assistance units in the same household." Trans-mittal No. ACF-AT-94-6 (Mar. 16, 1994), App. to Pet. for

at odds with the decision below.3 We granted certiorari toresolve this conflict, 512 U. S. 1288 (1994), and we now

In Beaton, the Ninth Circuit ruled that grouping intothe same AU all needy children (both siblings and nonsiblings alike) who live in the same household is inconsistentwith three different federal AFDC regulations, namely, 45

Opinion of the Court
(1993).4 See Beaton, supra, at 704. Respondents rely principally on these three regulations in their submission here.

As we examine the regulations, we keep in mind that in
AFDC cases, "the starting point of the . . . analysis must be
a recognition that . . . federal law gives each State great
latitude in dispensing its available funds." Dandridge,
supra, at 478. Accord, Shea, 416 U. S., at 253 (States "are
given broad discretion in determining both the standard of
need and the level of benefits"). In light of this cardinal

4 Section 233.20(a)(2)(viii) provides:
"[T]he money amount of any need item included in the standard will not
be prorated or otherwise reduced solely because of the presence in the
household of a non-legally responsible individual; and the [state] agency
will not assume any contribution from such individual for the support of
the assistance unit . . . ."

Section 233.20(a)(3)(ii) provides in part:

"[I]n determining need and the amount of the assistance payment, . . . :. . . . .

"(D) Income . . . and resources available for current use shall be considered. To the extent not inconsistent with any other provision of this
chapter, income and resources are considered available both when actually
available and when the applicant or recipient has a legal interest in a
liquidated sum and has the legal ability to make such sum available for
support and maintenance."

Section 233.90(a)(1) provides:
"The determination whether a child has been deprived of parental support or care by reason of the death, continued absence from the home, or
physical or mental incapacity of a parent, or (if the State plan includes
such cases) the unemployment of his or her parent who is the principal

parent, or in relation to the child's stepparent who is married, under State
law, to the child's natural or [adoptive] parent and is legally obligated to
support the child under State law of general applicability which requires
stepparents to support stepchildren to the same extent that natural or
adoptive parents are required to support their children. Under this requirement, the inclusion in the family, or the presence in the home, of a
`substitute parent' or `man-in-the-house' or any individual other than one
described in this paragraph is not an acceptable basis for a finding of ineligibility or for assuming the availability of income by the State . . . ."

principle, we conclude that the federal regulations do notpreclude the adoption of the California Rule.

A
According to $ 233.20(a)(2)(viii), States may not reduce theamount of assistance for which AFDC applicants are eligible

"solely because of the presence in the household of a non-legally responsible individual." Using the example of Mrs.
Edwards and her relatives, respondents observe that, al-though the granddaughter received AFDC benefits of $341
per month before the two grandnieces came to live in Mrs.Edwards' household, she received only one-third of $694, or
$231.33, per month after the grandnieces arrived and theCalifornia Rule took effect. See Brief for Respondents 6,
22. This reduction in the granddaughter's per capita bene-fits occurred, according to respondents, "solely because of the
presence in the household of " the grandnieces, who are"non-legally responsible individual[s]" in relation to the
granddaughter.Respondents are simply wrong. It was not solely the
presence of the grandnieces that triggered the decline in percapita benefits paid to the granddaughter; rather, it was the
grandnieces' presence plus their application for AFDC as-sistance through Mrs. Edwards. Had the two grandnieces,
after coming to live in Mrs. Edwards' home, either not ap-plied for assistance or applied through a different caretaker
relative living in that home, the California Rule would nothave affected the granddaughter's benefits at all.

5

5 Although needy children will receive less in per capita benefits under
the California Rule, this reduction affects only children who share a household. California is simply recognizing the economies of scale that inhere
in such living arrangements. See, e. g., Bowen v. Gilliard, 483 U. S. 587,
599 (1987) (crediting " `the common sense proposition that individuals living with others usually have reduced per capita costs because many of
their expenses are shared' " (quoting Termini v. Califano, 611 F. 2d 367,
370 (CA2 1979))).

152 ANDERSON v. EDWARDS

Opinion of the Court

B
Respondents also argue that the California Rule violatesthe "availability" principle, which is implemented, in one

form or another, by all three federal regulations. Section233.90(a)(1) provides that "the inclusion in the family, or the
presence in the home, of a `substitute parent' or `man-in-the-house' or any individual other than [the child's parent] is not
an acceptable basis for . . . assuming the availability of in-come" to a needy child. Likewise, $ 233.20(a)(2)(viii) provides that States may "not assume any contribution from[a nonlegally responsible] individual for the support of the
assistance unit." Finally, $ 233.20(a)(3)(ii)(D) provides gen-erally that States shall, "in determining need and the amount
of the assistance payment," count only "[i]ncome . . . andresources available for current use"; the regulation adds that
"income and resources are considered available both whenactually available and when [legally available]."

According to respondents, the California Rule assumesthat income from relatives is contributed to, or otherwise
available to, a needy child without a determination that it isactually available. If Mrs. Edwards' granddaughter were to
begin receiving $75 per month in outside income, for exam-ple, the AU of which she is a part would receive $75 less in
monthly AFDC benefits, and the two grandnieces would eachaccordingly receive $25 less in per capita monthly benefits.
Thus, the California Rule assertedly "assumes," in violationof all three federal regulations, that the granddaughter will
contribute $25 per month of her outside income to eachgrandniece and also that such income will therefore be available to each grandniece--without a case-specific determina-tion that such contribution will in fact occur.

Respondents' argument fails for at least two reasons.First, its premise is questionable. Although in this example,
the grandnieces each will nominally receive $25 less in percapita monthly benefits, they will

actually receive less inbenefits only if one assumes that Mrs. Edwards will expend

514us1$37N 06-11-98 18:24:41 PAGES OPINPGT

153Cite as: 514 U. S. 143 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
an equal amount of AFDC assistance on each of the threechildren--without regard to any other relevant circumstances, such as whether one of them receives outside in-come. Not only would such assumption fail to reflect reality,
see, e. g., Gilliard, 483 U. S., at 600, n. 14, it would also be
inconsistent with the duty imposed on caretakers by federallaw to spend AFDC payments "in the best interests of the

child[ren]" for whom they care, 42 U. S. C. $ 605, a duty spe-cifically implemented by California law, see,

e. g., Cal. Welf. &
Inst. Code Ann. $$ 11005.5, 11480 (West 1991). Thus, Cali-fornia may rationally assume that a caretaker will observe

her duties to all the members of the AU and will take into
account the receipt of any outside income by one child when
expending funds on behalf of the AU.

Second, respondents' argument misperceives the operation
of the California Rule. In the foregoing example, California
would simply add the monthly income of all members of the
AU--$75 (granddaughter) plus $0 (first grandniece) plus $0
(second grandniece) for a total of $75--and reduce the
monthly assistance payment to the Edwards family AU accordingly. It should be clear from this example that the
monthly payment to the AU is reduced not because the California Rule "assumes" that any income is available to the
grandnieces, but because it places the two grandnieces into
the same AU as the granddaughter (whose income is actually
available to herself). What respondents are really attacking is the rule that the income of all members of the AU is
combined in order to determine the amount of the assistance
payment to the AU. This attack ignores the very definition
of an AU: the group of individuals whose income and resources are considered "as a unit" for purposes of determining the amount of the assistance payment. 45 CFR

$ 206.10(b)(5) (1993). Accord, Brief for Respondents 4 ("All
of the income and resources of everyone in the assistance
unit are taken into consideration in establishing the benefit
payment").

154 ANDERSON v. EDWARDS

Opinion of the Court
Perhaps respondents are arguing that the regulations simply forbid California to combine the incomes of all needy children in a household--whether by grouping them into the
same AU or otherwise. But whatever are the limits that
federal law imposes on States' authority in this regard, the
combination of incomes effected by the California Rule is
authorized by the AFDC statute itself, which provides that
a state agency "shall, in determining need, take into consideration any . . . income and resources of any child or relative claiming [AFDC assistance]." 42 U. S. C. $ 602(a)(7)(A)
(1988 ed. and Supp. V). In light of the "great latitude,"
Dandridge, 397 U. S., at 478, and the "broad discretion,"
Shea, 416 U. S., at 253, that States have in administering
their AFDC programs, this statute is reasonably construed
to allow States, in determining a child's need (and therefore
how much assistance she will receive), to take into consideration the income and resources of all cohabiting children and
relatives also claiming AFDC assistance.

The availability regulations are addressed to an entirely
different problem, namely, the counting of income and resources controlled by persons outside the AU for the purpose
of determining the amount of assistance to be provided to
the AU. The regulations were adopted to implement our
decisions in three AFDC cases. See 42 Fed. Reg. 6583-6584
(1977) (citing King v. Smith, 392 U. S. 309 (1968); Lewis v.
Martin, 397 U. S. 552 (1970); Van Lare v. Hurley, 421 U. S.
338 (1975)). In all three cases, the State had counted as
available to the AU income that was not actually or legally
available because it was controlled by a person who was not
a member of the AU and who was not applying for AFDC
assistance. See King, supra, at 311 (a " `substitute father,' "
defined as any able-bodied man who cohabited with the
mother of the needy children in or outside her home); Lewis,
supra, at 554 ("an adult male person assuming the role of
spouse to the mother," such as a common-law husband, or a

Opinion of the Court
nonadopting stepfather not legally obligated to support thechildren); Van Lare, supra, at 339, 340 (a "nonpaying

lodge[r]," who was "a person not a recipient of AFDC"). Ac-cord, Bray v. Dowling, 25 F. 3d 135, 144 (CA2 1994) (the
federal availability regulations "were established to addressspecific concerns regarding the imputation of income from
non-AFDC sources"), cert. pending, No. 94-5845.The California Rule has no such effect. The combined income of the three-person AU comprising the granddaughterand two grandnieces of Mrs. Edwards is not calculated with
reference to the income either of Mrs. Edwards herself or ofanyone else inside or outside the Edwards household who is
not a member of the AU and who is not applying for AFDCassistance. In sum, the California Rule does not violate any
of the three federal regulations on which the Court of Ap-peals relied.

6

6 We are aware that in certain situations in which a member of a consolidated AU begins to receive outside income (such as monthly child support
payments, an inheritance, or even lottery winnings), the household would
receive a larger AFDC monthly payment if the recipient (along with all
members of her nuclear family, as required by the federal family filing
unit rule) terminated her participation in the AFDC program. See, e. g.,
Gilliard, 483 U. S., at 591 (citing example from prior to federal rule's adoption). Were California law to forbid a person to "opt out" of the AFDC
program in these situations, it might be said that the State had reduced
AFDC assistance to the AU's remaining members based solely on the
presence or the income of a person who is not applying for such assistance.

We find it unnecessary to determine whether California law ever forbids
a person who begins receiving outside income to opt out of the AFDC
program. Certainly, nothing in the California Rule itself speaks to this
issue. Furthermore, because respondents challenged the California Rule
on its face by seeking to enjoin its enforcement altogether, see First
Amended Complaint in No. CV-S 91 1473 (ED Cal.), pp. 16-17 (Jan. 10,
1992), they could not sustain their burden even if they showed that a possible application of the rule (in concert with another statute or regulation)
violated federal law. See United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745
(1987) (a facial challenge is "the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances ex514us1$37N 06-11-98 18:24:41 PAGES OPINPGT

III
Respondents offer two alternative grounds to support the
judgment below. Neither has merit, and we may dispose ofthem quickly.

First, respondents argue that the California Rule is aninvalid expansion of the family filing unit rule, 42 U. S. C.

$ 602(a)(38). According to respondents, when Congress de-creed that all members of a nuclear family must be grouped
together in a single AU, it intended to prevent States from
including any additional persons in that AU (as does the Cali-fornia Rule). We reject the notion that Congress' directive

regarding the composition of assistance units "occupied thefield" and thereby pre-empted States from adopting any
additional rules touching this area. What we said about"workfare" in

New York State Dept. of Social Servs. v. Dublino, 413 U. S. 405, 414 (1973), applies here as well: "If Con-gress had intended to pre-empt state plans and efforts in

such an important dimension of the AFDC program . . . ,
such intentions would in all likelihood have been expressedin direct and unambiguous language." The language of

$ 602(a)(38) requires States to embrace the family filing unitrule; it does not further limit States' discretion in a direct or
unambiguous manner.Second, respondents argue that the California Rule
violates two other federal regulations that require equit-able treatment among AFDC recipients. See 45 CFR

$ 233.10(a)(1) (1993) ("[T]he eligibility conditions imposed . . .
must not result in inequitable treatment of individuals orgroups"); $ 233.20(a)(1)(i) ("[T]he determination of need and

amount of assistance for all applicants [must] be made on anobjective and equitable basis"). Assuming that these provisions even "creat[e] a `federal right' that is enforceable under

ists under which the [rule] would be valid"). Though an as-applied challenge that presented the opt-out issue in a concrete factual setting might
require a court to decide it, such a challenge is not now before us.

Opinion of the Court
[42 U. S. C.] $ 1983," Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Assn., 496
U. S. 498, 509 (1990), we find that the California Rule affirmatively fosters equitable treatment among AFDC recipients.

For example, prior to September 1991 a caretaker relative
responsible for three brothers having no outside income
would have received AFDC benefits of $694 per month on
their behalf. Yet before the California Rule was applied to
her household, Mrs. Edwards received monthly benefits of
$901 for the three girls for whom she cared. See supra, at
148. The $207 difference is due solely to the fact that in one
household all of the children are siblings, while in the other
they are not. The potential inequities in the absence of the
California Rule are even greater. Six needy siblings living
in the same household in California could have received up
to $1,057 per month in benefits before September 1991. But
prior to the California Rule's adoption, six needy nonsiblings
who lived in the same household could have received as much
as $2,046, or almost double. See n. 1, supra. The California Rule sensibly and equitably eliminates these disparities
by providing that equally sized and equally needy households
will receive equal AFDC assistance. Thus, the rule does
not violate the equitable treatment regulations.7

7 In its 1994 Transmittal, see supra, at 149, HHS examined all of the
federal AFDC rules at issue in this case--the three availability regulations, the statutory family filing unit rule, and the equitable treatment
regulations. The agency concluded: "Apart from complying with [the
family filing unit rule and a related rule], States are authorized to set
the State-wide policy, to be applied in all cases, whether and under what
conditions two or more assistance units in the same household are to be
consolidated or retained as separate units." App. to Pet. for Cert. 35.
Because we have independently reached the same conclusion, we have no
occasion to decide whether we must defer to the agency's position. Cf.
Martin v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm'n, 499 U. S. 144,
150 (1991) ("It is well established `that an agency's construction of its own
regulations is entitled to substantial deference' " (quoting Lyng v. Payne,
476 U. S. 926, 939 (1986))).

159OCTOBER TERM, 1994
Syllabus

QUALITEX CO. v. JACOBSON PRODUCTS CO., INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 93-1577. Argued January 9, 1995--Decided March 28, 1995
Petitioner Qualitex Company has for years colored the dry cleaning press

pads it manufactures with a special shade of green gold. After respondent Jacobson Products (a Qualitex rival) began to use a similar
shade on its own press pads, Qualitex registered its color as a trademark
and added a trademark infringement count to the suit it had previously
filed challenging Jacobson's use of the green-gold color. Qualitex won
in the District Court, but the Ninth Circuit set aside the judgment on
the infringement claim because, in its view, the Trademark Act of 1946
(Lanham Act) does not permit registration of color alone as a trademark.

Held: The Lanham Act permits the registration of a trademark that consists, purely and simply, of a color. Pp. 162-174.

(a) That color alone can meet the basic legal requirements for use as
a trademark is demonstrated both by the language of the Act, which
describes the universe of things that can qualify as a trademark in the
broadest of terms, 15 U. S. C. $ 1127, and by the underlying principles
of trademark law, including the requirements that the mark "identify
and distinguish [the seller's] goods . . . from those manufactured or sold
by others and to indicate [their] source," ibid., and that it not be "functional," see, e. g., Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc.,
456 U. S. 844, 850, n. 10. The District Court's findings (accepted by the
Ninth Circuit and here undisputed) show Qualitex's green-gold color has
met these requirements. It acts as a symbol. Because customers
identify the color as Qualitex's, it has developed secondary meaning, see,
e. g., id., at 851, n. 11, and thereby identifies the press pads' source.
And, the color serves no other function. (Although it is important to
use some color on press pads to avoid noticeable stains, the court found
no competitive need in the industry for the green-gold color, since other
colors are equally usable.) Accordingly, unless there is some special
reason that convincingly militates against the use of color alone as a
trademark, trademark law protects Qualitex's use of its green-gold
color. Pp. 162-166.

(b) Jacobson's various special reasons why the law should forbid the
use of color alone as a trademark--that a contrary holding (1) will
produce uncertainty and unresolvable court disputes about what shades
of a color a competitor may lawfully use; (2) is unworkable in light of

the limited supply of colors that will soon be depleted by competitors;
(3) is contradicted by many older cases, including decisions of this Court
interpreting pre-Lanham Act trademark law; and (4) is unnecessary because firms already may use color as part of a trademark and may rely
on "trade dress" protection--are unpersuasive. Pp. 166-174.

sists, purely and simply, of a color. We conclude that, some-times, a color will meet ordinary legal trademark requirements. And, when it does so, no special legal rule preventscolor alone from serving as a trademark.

I
The case before us grows out of petitioner Qualitex Com-pany's use (since the 1950's) of a special shade of green-gold

color on the pads that it makes and sells to dry cleaning firmsfor use on dry cleaning presses. In 1989, respondent Jacobson Products (a Qualitex rival) began to sell its own presspads to dry cleaning firms; and it colored those pads a similar
green gold. In 1991, Qualitex registered the special green-gold color on press pads with the Patent and Trademark
Office as a trademark. Registration No. 1,633,711 (Feb. 5,1991). Qualitex subsequently added a trademark infringement count, 15 U. S. C. $ 1114(1), to an unfair competitionclaim, $ 1125(a), in a lawsuit it had already filed challenging
Jacobson's use of the green-gold color.Qualitex won the lawsuit in the District Court. 21
U. S. P. Q. 2d 1457 (CD Cal. 1991). But, the Court of Ap-peals for the Ninth Circuit set aside the judgment in Qualitex's favor on the trademark infringement claim because, inthat Circuit's view, the Lanham Act does not permit Qualitex, or anyone else, to register "color alone" as a trademark.13 F. 3d 1297, 1300, 1302 (1994).

The Courts of Appeals have differed as to whether or notthe law recognizes the use of color alone as a trademark.
Compare NutraSweet Co. v. Stadt Corp., 917 F. 2d 1024, 1028(CA7 1990) (absolute prohibition against protection of color
alone), with In re Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 774 F. 2d1116, 1128 (CA Fed. 1985) (allowing registration of color pink
for fiberglass insulation), and Master Distributors, Inc. v.Pako Corp., 986 F. 2d 219, 224 (CA8 1993) (declining to establish per se prohibition against protecting color alone as atrademark). Therefore, this Court granted certiorari. 512

Opinion of the Court
U. S. 1287 (1994). We now hold that there is no rule abso-lutely barring the use of color alone, and we reverse the

judgment of the Ninth Circuit.

II
The Lanham Act gives a seller or producer the exclusiveright to "register" a trademark, 15 U. S. C. $ 1052 (1988 ed.

and Supp. V), and to prevent his or her competitors fromusing that trademark, $ 1114(1). Both the language of the
Act and the basic underlying principles of trademark lawwould seem to include color within the universe of things
that can qualify as a trademark. The language of the Lan-ham Act describes that universe in the broadest of terms.
It says that trademarks "includ[e] any word, name, symbol,or device, or any combination thereof." $ 1127. Since
human beings might use as a "symbol" or "device" almostanything at all that is capable of carrying meaning, this language, read literally, is not restrictive. The courts and thePatent and Trademark Office have authorized for use as a
mark a particular shape (of a Coca-Cola bottle), a particularsound (of NBC's three chimes), and even a particular scent
(of plumeria blossoms on sewing thread). See, e. g., Regis-tration No. 696,147 (Apr. 12, 1960); Registration Nos. 523,616
(Apr. 4, 1950) and 916,522 (July 13, 1971); In re Clarke, 17U. S. P. Q. 2d 1238, 1240 (TTAB 1990). If a shape, a sound,
and a fragrance can act as symbols why, one might ask, cana color not do the same?

A color is also capable of satisfying the more importantpart of the statutory definition of a trademark, which requires that a person "us[e]" or "inten[d] to use" the mark

"to identify and distinguish his or her goods, includinga unique product, from those manufactured or sold by

others and to indicate the source of the goods, even ifthat source is unknown." 15 U. S. C. $ 1127.

True, a product's color is unlike "fanciful," "arbitrary," or"suggestive" words or designs, which almost automatically

tell a customer that they refer to a brand. Abercrombie &
Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., 537 F. 2d 4, 9-10 (CA2
1976) (Friendly, J.); see Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc.,505 U. S. 763, 768 (1992). The imaginary word "Suntost,"

or the words "Suntost Marmalade," on a jar of orange jam
immediately would signal a brand or a product "source"; thejam's orange color does not do so. But, over time, customers

may come to treat a particular color on a product or its pack-aging (say, a color that in context seems unusual, such as
pink on a firm's insulating material or red on the head of alarge industrial bolt) as signifying a brand. And, if so, that
color would have come to identify and distinguish the
goods--i. e., "to indicate" their "source"--much in the way
that descriptive words on a product (say, "Trim" on nail clippers or "Car-Freshner" on deodorizer) can come to indicate
a product's origin. See, e. g., J. Wiss & Sons Co. v. W. E.
Bassett Co., 59 C. C. P. A. 1269, 1271 (Pat.), 462 F. 2d 567,
569 (1972); Car-Freshner Corp. v. Turtle Wax, Inc., 268
F. Supp. 162, 164 (SDNY 1967). In this circumstance, trademark law says that the word (e. g., "Trim"), although not
inherently distinctive, has developed "secondary meaning."
See Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456
U. S. 844, 851, n. 11 (1982) ("[S]econdary meaning" is acquired when "in the minds of the public, the primary significance of a product feature . . . is to identify the source of the
product rather than the product itself "). Again, one might
ask, if trademark law permits a descriptive word with secondary meaning to act as a mark, why would it not permit a
color, under similar circumstances, to do the same?

We cannot find in the basic objectives of trademark law
any obvious theoretical objection to the use of color alone
as a trademark, where that color has attained "secondary
meaning" and therefore identifies and distinguishes a particular brand (and thus indicates its "source"). In principle,
trademark law, by preventing others from copying a sourceidentifying mark, "reduce[s] the customer's costs of shopping

(and not an imitating competitor) will reap the financial,
reputation-related rewards associated with a desirable product. The law thereby "encourage[s] the production of quality products," ibid., and simultaneously discourages those
who hope to sell inferior products by capitalizing on a consumer's inability quickly to evaluate the quality of an item
offered for sale. See, e. g., 3 L. Altman, Callmann on Unfair
Competition, Trademarks and Monopolies $ 17.03 (4th ed.
1983); Landes & Posner, The Economics of Trademark Law,
78 T. M. Rep. 267, 271-272 (1988); Park 'N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar
Park & Fly, Inc., 469 U. S. 189, 198 (1985); S. Rep. No. 100-
515, p. 4 (1988). It is the source-distinguishing ability of a
mark--not its ontological status as color, shape, fragrance,
word, or sign--that permits it to serve these basic purposes.
See Landes & Posner, Trademark Law: An Economic Perspective, 30 J. Law & Econ. 265, 290 (1987). And, for that
reason, it is difficult to find, in basic trademark objectives, a
reason to disqualify absolutely the use of a color as a mark.

Neither can we find a principled objection to the use of
color as a mark in the important "functionality" doctrine of
trademark law. The functionality doctrine prevents trademark law, which seeks to promote competition by protecting
a firm's reputation, from instead inhibiting legitimate competition by allowing a producer to control a useful product feature. It is the province of patent law, not trademark law, to
encourage invention by granting inventors a monopoly over
new product designs or functions for a limited time, 35
U. S. C. $$ 154, 173, after which competitors are free to use
the innovation. If a product's functional features could be

Opinion of the Court
used as trademarks, however, a monopoly over such featurescould be obtained without regard to whether they qualify as

patents and could be extended forever (because trademarksmay be renewed in perpetuity). See

Kellogg Co. v. National
Biscuit Co., 305 U. S. 111, 119-120 (1938) (Brandeis, J.); Inwood Laboratories, Inc., supra, at 863 (White, J., concurringin result) ("A functional characteristic is `an important ingredient in the commercial success of the product,' and, afterexpiration of a patent, it is no more the property of the originator than the product itself ") (citation omitted). Function-ality doctrine therefore would require, to take an imaginary
example, that even if customers have come to identify thespecial illumination-enhancing shape of a new patented light
bulb with a particular manufacturer, the manufacturer may
not use that shape as a trademark, for doing so, after thepatent had expired, would impede competition--not by protecting the reputation of the original bulb maker, but byfrustrating competitors' legitimate efforts to produce an
equivalent illumination-enhancing bulb. See, e. g., Kellogg
Co., supra, at 119-120 (trademark law cannot be used to extend monopoly over "pillow" shape of shredded wheat biscuitafter the patent for that shape had expired). This Court

consequently has explained that, "[i]n general terms, a product feature is functional," and cannot serve as a trademark,
"if it is essential to the use or purpose of the article or if
it affects the cost or quality of the article," that is, if exclusive use of the feature would put competitors at a significant non-reputation-related disadvantage. Inwood Laboratories, Inc., supra, at 850, n. 10. Although sometimes color
plays an important role (unrelated to source identification) in
making a product more desirable, sometimes it does not.
And, this latter fact--the fact that sometimes color is not
essential to a product's use or purpose and does not affect
cost or quality--indicates that the doctrine of "functionality"
does not create an absolute bar to the use of color alone as a
mark. See Owens-Corning, 774 F. 2d, at 1123 (pink color of
insulation in wall "performs no non-trademark function").

166 QUALITEX CO. v. JACOBSON PRODUCTS CO.

Opinion of the Court
It would seem, then, that color alone, at least sometimes,
can meet the basic legal requirements for use as a trademark.
It can act as a symbol that distinguishes a firm's goods and
identifies their source, without serving any other significant
function. See U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office, Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure

$ 1202.04(e), p. 1202-13 (2d ed. May, 1993) (hereinafter PTO
Manual) (approving trademark registration of color alone
where it "has become distinctive of the applicant's goods
in commerce," provided that "there is [no] competitive need
for colors to remain available in the industry" and the color
is not "functional"); see also 1 McCarthy $$ 3.01[1], 7.26,
pp. 3-2, 7-113 ("requirements for qualification of a word or
symbol as a trademark" are that it be (1) a "symbol," (2)
"use[d] . . . as a mark," (3) "to identify and distinguish the
seller's goods from goods made or sold by others," but that
it not be "functional"). Indeed, the District Court, in this
case, entered findings (accepted by the Ninth Circuit) that
show Qualitex's green-gold press pad color has met these
requirements. The green-gold color acts as a symbol.
Having developed secondary meaning (for customers identified the green-gold color as Qualitex's), it identifies the press
pads' source. And, the green-gold color serves no other
function. (Although it is important to use some color on
press pads to avoid noticeable stains, the court found "no
competitive need in the press pad industry for the green-gold
color, since other colors are equally usable." 21 U. S. P. Q.
2d, at 1460.) Accordingly, unless there is some special reason that convincingly militates against the use of color alone
as a trademark, trademark law would protect Qualitex's use
of the green-gold color on its press pads.

III
Respondent Jacobson Products says that there are four
special reasons why the law should forbid the use of color

167Cite as: 514 U. S. 159 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
alone as a trademark. We shall explain, in turn, why we,ultimately, find them unpersuasive.

First, Jacobson says that, if the law permits the use ofcolor as a trademark, it will produce uncertainty and unresolvable court disputes about what shades of a color a competitor may lawfully use. Because lighting (morning sun,twilight mist) will affect perceptions of protected color, competitors and courts will suffer from "shade confusion" as theytry to decide whether use of a similar color on a similar product does, or does not, confuse customers and thereby infringea trademark. Jacobson adds that the "shade confusion"
problem is "more difficult" and "far different from" the "determination of the similarity of words or symbols." Brief
for Respondent 22.

We do not believe, however, that color, in this respect, is
special. Courts traditionally decide quite difficult questions
about whether two words or phrases or symbols are sufficiently similar, in context, to confuse buyers. They have
had to compare, for example, such words as "Bonamine" and
"Dramamine" (motion-sickness remedies); "Huggies" and
"Dougies" (diapers); "Cheracol" and "Syrocol" (cough syrup);
"Cyclone" and "Tornado" (wire fences); and "Mattres" and
"1-800-Mattres" (mattress franchisor telephone numbers).
See, e. g., G. D. Searle & Co. v. Chas. Pfizer & Co., 265 F. 2d
385, 389 (CA7 1959); Kimberly-Clark Corp. v. H. Douglas
Enterprises, Ltd., 774 F. 2d 1144, 1146-1147 (CA Fed. 1985);
Upjohn Co. v. Schwartz, 246 F. 2d 254, 262 (CA2 1957); Hancock v. American Steel & Wire Co. of N. J., 40 C. C. P. A.
(Pat.) 931, 935, 203 F. 2d 737, 740-741 (1953); Dial-AMattress Franchise Corp. v. Page, 880 F. 2d 675, 678 (CA2
1989). Legal standards exist to guide courts in making such
comparisons. See, e. g., 2 McCarthy $ 15.08; 1 McCarthy

$$ 11.24-11.25 ("[S]trong" marks, with greater secondary
meaning, receive broader protection than "weak" marks).
We do not see why courts could not apply those standards
to a color, replicating, if necessary, lighting conditions under

514us1$38Q 05-27-98 14:52:04 PAGES OPINPGT
168 QUALITEX CO. v. JACOBSON PRODUCTS CO.

Opinion of the Court
which a colored product is normally sold. See Ebert, Trade-mark Protection in Color: Do It By the Numbers!, 84 T. M.

Rep. 379, 405 (1994). Indeed, courts already have done soin cases where a trademark consists of a color plus a design,
i. e., a colored symbol such as a gold stripe (around a sewer
pipe), a yellow strand of wire rope, or a "brilliant yellow"band (on ampules). See,

e. g., Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co.
v. Tallman Conduit Co., 149 U. S. P. Q. 656, 657 (TTAB 1966);
Amstead Industries, Inc. v. West Coast Wire Rope & Rigging Inc., 2 U. S. P. Q. 2d 1755, 1760 (TTAB 1987); In re
Hodes-Lange Corp., 167 U. S. P. Q. 255, 256 (TTAB 1970).

Second, Jacobson argues, as have others, that colors are in
limited supply. See, e. g., NutraSweet Co., 917 F. 2d, at 1028;
Campbell Soup Co. v. Armour & Co., 175 F. 2d 795, 798 (CA3
1949). Jacobson claims that, if one of many competitors can
appropriate a particular color for use as a trademark, and
each competitor then tries to do the same, the supply of colors will soon be depleted. Put in its strongest form, this
argument would concede that "[h]undreds of color pigments
are manufactured and thousands of colors can be obtained by
mixing." L. Cheskin, Colors: What They Can Do For You 47
(1947). But, it would add that, in the context of a particular
product, only some colors are usable. By the time one discards colors that, say, for reasons of customer appeal, are not
usable, and adds the shades that competitors cannot use lest
they risk infringing a similar, registered shade, then one is
left with only a handful of possible colors. And, under these
circumstances, to permit one, or a few, producers to use colors as trademarks will "deplete" the supply of usable colors
to the point where a competitor's inability to find a suitable
color will put that competitor at a significant disadvantage.

This argument is unpersuasive, however, largely because
it relies on an occasional problem to justify a blanket prohibition. When a color serves as a mark, normally alternative
colors will likely be available for similar use by others. See,
e. g., Owens-Corning, 774 F. 2d, at 1121 (pink insulation).

169Cite as: 514 U. S. 159 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
Moreover, if that is not so--if a "color depletion" or "colorscarcity" problem does arise--the trademark doctrine of

"functionality" normally would seem available to prevent theanticompetitive consequences that Jacobson's argument posits, thereby minimizing that argument's practical force.

The functionality doctrine, as we have said, forbids the useof a product's feature as a trademark where doing so will put

a competitor at a significant disadvantage because the fea-ture is "essential to the use or purpose of the article" or
"affects [its] cost or quality." Inwood Laboratories, Inc.,456 U. S., at 850, n. 10. The functionality doctrine thus protects competitors against a disadvantage (unrelated to recognition or reputation) that trademark protection might otherwise impose, namely, their inability reasonably to replicate
important non-reputation-related product features. For example, this Court has written that competitors might be free
to copy the color of a medical pill where that color serves to
identify the kind of medication (e. g., a type of blood medicine) in addition to its source. See id., at 853, 858, n. 20
("[S]ome patients commingle medications in a container and
rely on color to differentiate one from another"); see also J.
Ginsburg, D. Goldberg, & A. Greenbaum, Trademark and Unfair Competition Law 194-195 (1991) (noting that drug color
cases "have more to do with public health policy" regarding
generic drug substitution "than with trademark law").
And, the federal courts have demonstrated that they can
apply this doctrine in a careful and reasoned manner, with
sensitivity to the effect on competition. Although we need
not comment on the merits of specific cases, we note that
lower courts have permitted competitors to copy the green
color of farm machinery (because customers wanted their
farm equipment to match) and have barred the use of black
as a trademark on outboard boat motors (because black has
the special functional attributes of decreasing the apparent
size of the motor and ensuring compatibility with many different boat colors). See Deere & Co. v. Farmhand, Inc., 560

1316, 1320 (ED Pa. 1987) (blue color of fertilizer held functional because it indicated the presence of nitrogen). TheRestatement (Third) of Unfair Competition adds that, if a

design's "aesthetic value" lies in its ability to "confe[r] a sig-nificant benefit that cannot practically be duplicated by the
use of alternative designs," then the design is "functional."Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition $ 17, Comment

c,
pp. 175-176 (1993). The "ultimate test of aesthetic functionality," it explains, "is whether the recognition of trademark
rights would significantly hinder competition." Id., at 176.

The upshot is that, where a color serves a significant nontrademark function--whether to distinguish a heart pill from
a digestive medicine or to satisfy the "noble instinct for giving the right touch of beauty to common and necessary
things," G. Chesterton, Simplicity and Tolstoy 61 (1912)--
courts will examine whether its use as a mark would permit
one competitor (or a group) to interfere with legitimate
(nontrademark-related) competition through actual or potential exclusive use of an important product ingredient. That
examination should not discourage firms from creating esthetically pleasing mark designs, for it is open to their competitors to do the same. See, e. g., W. T. Rogers Co. v. Keene,
778 F. 2d 334, 343 (CA7 1985) (Posner, J.). But, ordinarily,
it should prevent the anticompetitive consequences of Jacobson's hypothetical "color depletion" argument, when, and
if, the circumstances of a particular case threaten "color
depletion."

Third, Jacobson points to many older cases--including Supreme Court cases--in support of its position. In 1878, this
Court described the common-law definition of trademark
rather broadly to "consist of a name, symbol, figure, letter,
form, or device, if adopted and used by a manufacturer or

Opinion of the Court
merchant in order to designate the goods he manufacturesor sells to distinguish the same from those manufactured or

sold by another." McLean v. Fleming, 96 U. S. 245, 254.Yet, in interpreting the Trademark Acts of 1881 and 1905,
21 Stat. 502, 33 Stat. 724, which retained that common-law
definition, the Court questioned "[w]hether mere color canconstitute a valid trade-mark,"

A. Leschen & Sons Rope Co.
v. Broderick & Bascom Rope Co., 201 U. S. 166, 171 (1906),and suggested that the "product including the coloring matter is free to all who make it," Coca-Cola Co. v. Koke Co.
of America, 254 U. S. 143, 147 (1920). Even though these
statements amounted to dicta, lower courts interpreted themas forbidding protection for color alone. See,

e. g., Campbell
Soup Co., 175 F. 2d, at 798, and n. 9; Life Savers Corp. v.
Curtiss Candy Co., 182 F. 2d 4, 9 (CA7 1950) (quoting Campbell Soup, supra, at 798).

These Supreme Court cases, however, interpreted trade-mark law as it existed

before 1946, when Congress enacted
the Lanham Act. The Lanham Act significantly changedand liberalized the common law to "dispense with mere technical prohibitions," S. Rep. No. 1333, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 3(1946), most notably, by permitting trademark registration
of descriptive words (say, "U-Build-It" model airplanes)
where they had acquired "secondary meaning." See Abercrombie & Fitch Co., 537 F. 2d, at 9 (Friendly, J.). The Lanham Act extended protection to descriptive marks by mak-ing clear that (with certain explicit exceptions not relevant

here)

"nothing . . . shall prevent the registration of a mark
used by the applicant which has become distinctive
of the applicant's goods in commerce." 15 U. S. C.

$ 1052(f ) (1988 ed., Supp. V).

This language permits an ordinary word, normally used for
a nontrademark purpose (e. g., description), to act as a trademark where it has gained "secondary meaning." Its logic

172 QUALITEX CO. v. JACOBSON PRODUCTS CO.

Opinion of the Court
would appear to apply to color as well. Indeed, in 1985, theFederal Circuit considered the significance of the Lanham

Act's changes as they related to color and held that trade-mark protection for color was consistent with the

"jurisprudence under the Lanham Act developed in ac-cordance with the statutory principle that if a mark is
capable of being or becoming distinctive of [the] appli-cant's goods in commerce, then it is capable of serving
as a trademark." Owens-Corning, 774 F. 2d, at 1120.
In 1988, Congress amended the Lanham Act, revising portions of the definitional language, but left unchanged the lan-guage here relevant. $ 134, 102 Stat. 3946, 15 U. S. C. $ 1127.

It enacted these amendments against the following back-ground: (1) the Federal Circuit had decided

Owens-Corning;
(2) the Patent and Trademark Office had adopted a clear
policy (which it still maintains) permitting registrationof color as a trademark, see PTO Manual $ 1202.04(e) (at

p. 1200-12 of the January 1986 edition and p. 1202-13 of theMay 1993 edition); and (3) the Trademark Commission had
written a report, which recommended that "the terms `sym-bol, or device' . . . not be deleted or narrowed to preclude
registration of such things as a color, shape, smell, sound, orconfiguration which functions as a mark," The United States
Trademark Association Trademark Review Commission Report and Recommendations to USTA President and Board ofDirectors, 77 T. M. Rep. 375, 421 (1987); see also 133 Cong.

Rec. 32812 (1987) (statement of Sen. DeConcini) ("The bill Iam introducing today is based on the Commission's report
and recommendations"). This background strongly suggests that the language "any word, name, symbol, or device,"
15 U. S. C. $ 1127, had come to include color. And, when it
amended the statute, Congress retained these terms. Indeed, the Senate Report accompanying the Lanham Act revision explicitly referred to this background understanding, in
saying that the "revised definition intentionally retains . . .

173Cite as: 514 U. S. 159 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
the words `symbol or device' so as not to preclude the regis-tration of colors, shapes, sounds or configurations where they

function as trademarks." S. Rep. No. 100-515, at 44. (Inaddition, the statute retained language providing that "[n]o
trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others shall be refused registra-tion . . . on account of its nature" (except for certain specified

reasons not relevant here). 15 U. S. C. $ 1052 (1988 ed.,Supp. V).)

This history undercuts the authority of the precedent onwhich Jacobson relies. Much of the pre-1985 case law rested
on statements in Supreme Court opinions that interpreted
pre-Lanham Act trademark law and were not directly related to the holdings in those cases. Moreover, we believe
the Federal Circuit was right in 1985 when it found that the
1946 Lanham Act embodied crucial legal changes that liberalized the law to permit the use of color alone as a trademark
(under appropriate circumstances). At a minimum, the Lanham Act's changes left the courts free to reevaluate the preexisting legal precedent which had absolutely forbidden the
use of color alone as a trademark. Finally, when Congress
reenacted the terms "word, name, symbol, or device" in 1988,
it did so against a legal background in which those terms had
come to include color, and its statutory revision embraced
that understanding.

Fourth, Jacobson argues that there is no need to permit
color alone to function as a trademark because a firm already
may use color as part of a trademark, say, as a colored circle
or colored letter or colored word, and may rely upon "trade
dress" protection, under $ 43(a) of the Lanham Act, if a competitor copies its color and thereby causes consumer confusion regarding the overall appearance of the competing products or their packaging, see 15 U. S. C. $ 1125(a) (1988 ed.,
Supp. V). The first part of this argument begs the question.
One can understand why a firm might find it difficult to place
a usable symbol or word on a product (say, a large industrial

174 QUALITEX CO. v. JACOBSON PRODUCTS CO.

Opinion of the Court
bolt that customers normally see from a distance); and, insuch instances, a firm might want to use color, pure and simple, instead of color as part of a design. Neither is the sec-ond portion of the argument convincing. Trademark law
helps the holder of a mark in many ways that "trade dress"protection does not. See 15 U. S. C. $ 1124 (ability to prevent importation of confusingly similar goods); $ 1072 (con-structive notice of ownership); $ 1065 (incontestible status);

$ 1057(b) (prima facie evidence of validity and ownership).Thus, one can easily find reasons why the law might provide
trademark protection in addition to trade dress protection.

IV
Having determined that a color may sometimes meet thebasic legal requirements for use as a trademark and that respondent Jacobson's arguments do not justify a special legalrule preventing color alone from serving as a trademark
(and, in light of the District Court's here undisputed findingsthat Qualitex's use of the green-gold color on its press pads
meets the basic trademark requirements), we conclude thatthe Ninth Circuit erred in barring Qualitex's use of color as
a trademark. For these reasons, the judgment of the NinthCircuit is

Reversed.

Syllabus

OKLAHOMA TAX COMMISSION v. JEFFERSONLINES, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 93-1677. Argued November 28, 1994--Decided April 3, 1995
Respondent Jefferson Lines, Inc., a common carrier, did not collect or

remit to Oklahoma the state sales tax on bus tickets sold in Oklahoma
for interstate travel originating there, although it did so for tickets sold
for intrastate travel. After Jefferson filed for bankruptcy, petitioner,
Oklahoma Tax Commission, filed proof of claims for the uncollected
taxes, but the Bankruptcy Court found that the tax was inconsistent
with the Commerce Clause in that it imposed an undue burden on interstate commerce and presented a danger of multiple taxation. The District Court affirmed. The Court of Appeals also affirmed, holding that
the tax was not fairly apportioned. Rejecting the Commission's position that a bus ticket sale is a wholly local transaction justifying a
State's sales tax on the ticket's full value, the court reasoned that such
a tax is indistinguishable from New York's unapportioned tax on an
interstate bus line's gross receipts struck down by this Court in Central
Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. Mealey, 334 U. S. 653.

Held: Oklahoma's tax on the sale of transportation services is consistent

with the Commerce Clause. Pp. 179-200.

(a) Under Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274, Oklahoma's tax is valid if it is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus
with the State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to the services provided by the
State. The activity here clearly has a nexus with Oklahoma, the State
where the ticket is purchased and the service originates. Pp. 179-184.

(b) The purpose of the second prong of Complete Auto's test is to
ensure that each State taxes only its fair share of an interstate transaction. A properly apportioned tax must be both internally and externally consistent. Internal consistency looks to whether a tax's identical
application by every State would place interstate commerce at a disadvantage as compared with intrastate commerce. There is no failure of
such consistency in this case, for if every State were to impose a tax
identical to Oklahoma's--i. e., a tax on ticket sales within the State for
travel originating there--no sale would be subject to more than one
State's tax. External consistency, on the other hand, looks to the economic justification for the State's claim upon the value taxed, to discover

514us1$39Z 06-11-98 18:17:15 PAGES OPINPGT
176 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. JEFFERSON LINES, INC.

Syllabus
whether the tax reaches beyond the portion of value that is fairly attributable to economic activity within the taxing State. Pp. 184-185.

(c) Where taxation of income from interstate business is in issue, apportionment disputes have often focused on slicing a taxable pie among
several States in which the taxpayer's activities contributed to taxable
income. When examining the taxation of a sale of goods, however, the
sale is most readily viewed as a discrete event facilitated by the laws
and amenities of the place of sale, and the transaction itself does not
readily reveal the extent to which interstate activity affects the value
on which a buyer is taxed. Thus, taxation of sales has been consistently
approved without any division of the tax base among different States
and has been found properly measurable by the gross charge for the
purchase, regardless of any activity outside the taxing jurisdiction that
might have preceded the sale or might occur in the future. Therefore,
an internally consistent, conventional sales tax has long been held to be
externally consistent as well. Pp. 186-188.

(d) A sale of services can ordinarily be treated as a local state event
just as readily as a sale of tangible goods can be located solely within
the State of delivery. Sales of services with performance wholly in the
taxing State justify that State's taxation of the transaction's entire gross
receipts in the hands of the seller. Even where interstate activity contributes to the value of the service performed, sales with performance
in the taxing State justify that State's taxation of the seller's entire
gross receipts. See, e. g., Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue,
303 U. S. 250. In this case, although the service is performed only partially within the taxing State, the buyer is no more subject to double
taxation on the sale of services than the buyer of goods would be. The
taxable event here comprises agreement, payment, and delivery of some
of the services in the taxing State. No other State can claim to be the
site of the same combination, and these combined events are commonly
understood to suffice for a sale. Central Greyhound, supra, distinguished. Pp. 188-191.

(e) Jefferson offers no convincing reasons to reconsider whether this
internally consistent tax on sales of services could fail the external consistency test for lack of further apportionment. It has raised no specter
of successive taxation so closely related to the transaction as to indicate
potential unfairness of Oklahoma's tax on the sale's full amount. Nor is
the fact that Oklahoma could feasibly apportion its tax on the basis of
mileage, as New York was required to do in Central Greyhound, supra,
a sufficient reason to conclude that the tax exceeds Oklahoma's fair
share. Pp. 191-196.

(f) The tax also meets the remaining two prongs of Complete Auto's

goods and services pay the taxes, which must be collectedand remitted to the State by sellers. $ 1361.

Respondent Jefferson Lines, Inc., is a Minnesota corpora-tion that provided bus services as a common carrier in Oklahoma from 1988 to 1990. Jefferson did not collect or remitthe sales taxes for tickets it had sold in Oklahoma for bus
travel from Oklahoma to other States, although it did collectand remit the taxes for all tickets it had sold in Oklahoma
for travel that originated and terminated within that State.After Jefferson filed for bankruptcy protection on October
27, 1989, petitioner, Oklahoma Tax Commission, filed proofof claims in Bankruptcy Court for the uncollected taxes for
tickets for interstate travel sold by Jefferson.2 Jeffersoncited the Commerce Clause in objecting to the claims, and
argued that the tax imposes an undue burden on interstatecommerce by permitting Oklahoma to collect a percentage of
the full purchase price of all tickets for interstate bus travel,even though some of that value derives from bus travel
through other States. The tax also presents the danger ofmultiple taxation, Jefferson claimed, because any other State
through which a bus travels while providing the services soldin Oklahoma will be able to impose taxes of their own upon
Jefferson or its passengers for use of the roads.The Bankruptcy Court agreed with Jefferson, the District
Court affirmed, and so did the United States Court of Ap-peals for the Eighth Circuit.

including railroads both steam and electric, motor transportation companies, taxicab companies, pullman car companies, airlines, and other means
of transportation for hire." As a result of recent amendments, the statute
presently provides for a 41/2 percent tax rate.

2 The parties have stipulated that the dispute concerns only those taxes

for Jefferson's in-state sales of tickets for travel starting in Oklahoma and
ending in another State. App. 5; Tr. of Oral Arg. 3-4. The Commission
does not seek to recover any taxes for tickets sold in Oklahoma for travel
wholly outside of the State or for travel on routes originating in other
States and terminating in Oklahoma. Accordingly, the validity of such
taxes is not before us.

Opinion of the Court
F. 3d 90 (1994). The Court of Appeals held that Oklahoma'stax was not fairly apportioned, as required under the established test for the constitutionality of a state tax on inter-state commerce. See Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady,
430 U. S. 274, 279 (1977). The Court of Appeals understoodits holding to be compelled by our decision in

Central Grey-hound Lines, Inc. v. Mealey, 334 U. S. 653 (1948), which held

unconstitutional an unapportioned state tax on the gross re-ceipts

3 of a company that sold tickets for interstate bus

travel. The Court of Appeals rejected the Commission's po-sition that the sale of a bus ticket is a wholly local transaction

justifying a sales tax on the ticket's full value in the Statewhere it is sold, reasoning that such a tax is indistinguishable
from the unapportioned tax on gross receipts from interstatetravel struck down in

Central Greyhound. 15 F. 3d, at 92-93. We granted certiorari, 512 U. S. 1204 (1994), and now

Despite the express grant to Congress of the power to"regulate Commerce . . . among the several States," U. S.

do if it were free to place burdens on the flow of commerceacross its borders that commerce wholly within those borders would not bear. The provision thus " `reflect[s] a central concern of the Framers that was an immediate reasonfor calling the Constitutional Convention: the conviction that

also The Federalist Nos. 42 (J. Madison), 7 (A. Hamilton), 11
(A. Hamilton).

The command has been stated more easily than its object
has been attained, however, and the Court's understanding
of the dormant Commerce Clause has taken some turns. In
its early stages, see 1 J. Hellerstein & W. Hellerstein, State
Taxation |||| 4.05-4.08 (2d ed. 1993) (hereinafter Hellerstein & Hellerstein); Hartman, supra n. 3, $$ 2:9-2:16, the
Court held the view that interstate commerce was wholly
immune from state taxation "in any form," Leloup v. Port of
Mobile, 127 U. S. 640, 648 (1888), "even though the same
amount of tax should be laid on [intrastate] commerce," Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing Dist., 120 U. S. 489, 497 (1887);
see also Cooley v. Board of Wardens of Port of Philadelphia

approach, according to which, for example, the Court would
invalidate a state tax levied on gross receipts from interstate
commerce, New Jersey Bell Telephone Co. v. State Bd. of
Taxes and Assessments of N. J., 280 U. S. 338 (1930); Meyer

Freight Tax, 15 Wall. 232, 278 (1873), but would allow a taxmerely measured by gross receipts from interstate commerce as long as the tax was formally imposed upon fran-chises,

Maine v. Grand Trunk R. Co., 142 U. S. 217 (1891), or
" `in lieu of all taxes upon [the taxpayer's] property,' " United
States Express Co. v. Minnesota, 223 U. S. 335, 346 (1912).4See generally Lockhart, Gross Receipts Taxes on Interstate

Transportation and Communication, 57 Harv. L. Rev. 40,43-66 (1943) (hereinafter Lockhart). Dissenting from this
formal approach in 1927, Justice Stone remarked that it was"too mechanical, too uncertain in its application, and too remote from actualities, to be of value." Di Santo v. Pennsylvania, 273 U. S. 34, 44 (1927) (dissenting opinion).

In 1938, the old formalism began to give way with JusticeStone's opinion in

Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue,
303 U. S. 250, which examined New Mexico's franchise tax,
measured by gross receipts, as applied to receipts from outof-state advertisers in a journal produced by taxpayers in
New Mexico but circulated both inside and outside the State.
Although the assessment could have been sustained solely
on prior precedent, see id., at 258; Lockhart 66, and n. 122,
Justice Stone added a dash of the pragmatism that, with a
brief interlude, has since become our aspiration in this quarter of the law. The Court had no trouble rejecting the claim
that the "mere formation of the contract between persons in
different states" insulated the receipts from taxation, Western Live Stock, 303 U. S., at 253, and it saw the business of
"preparing, printing and publishing magazine advertising
[as] peculiarly local" and therefore subject to taxation by the

4 The Court had indeed temporarily adhered to an additional distinction
between taxes upon interstate commerce such as that struck down in the
Case of State Freight Tax, and taxes upon gross receipts from such commerce, which were upheld that same Term in State Tax on Railway Gross
Receipts, 15 Wall. 284 (1873). This nice distinction was abandoned prior
to the New Jersey Bell case in Philadelphia & Southern S. S. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 122 U. S. 326 (1887).

Opinion of the Court
State within which the business operated. Id., at 258. Themore "vexed question," however, was one that today we

would call a question of apportionment: whether the inter-state circulation of the journal barred taxation of receipts
from advertisements enhanced in value by the journal's widedissemination.

Id., at 254. After rebuffing any such chal-lenge on the ground that the burden on interstate commerce

was "too remote and too attenuated" in the light of analogoustaxation of railroad property, id., at 259, Justice Stone provided an "added reason" for sustaining the tax:

"So far as the value contributed to appellants' New Mex-ico business by circulation of the magazine interstate is

taxed, it cannot again be taxed elsewhere any more thanthe value of railroad property taxed locally. The tax is
not one which in form or substance can be repeated byother states in such manner as to lay an added burden
on the interstate distribution of the magazine." Id., at260.

The Court explained that "[i]t was not the purpose of thecommerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even thoughit increases the cost of doing the business." Id., at 254.
Soon after Western Live Stock, the Court expressly restedthe invalidation of an unapportioned gross receipts tax on
the ground that it violated the prohibition against multipletaxation:

"The vice of the statute as applied to receipts frominterstate sales is that the tax includes in its measure,
without apportionment, receipts derived from activitiesin interstate commerce; and that the exaction is of such
a character that if lawful it may in substance be laid tothe fullest extent by States in which the goods are sold
as well as those in which they are manufactured." J. D.

See also Gwin, White & Prince, Inc. v. Henneford, 305 U. S.434, 438-439 (1939).

After a brief resurgence of the old absolutism that pro-scribed all taxation formally levied upon interstate commerce, see Freeman v. Hewit, 329 U. S. 249 (1946); Spector
Motor Service, Inc. v. O'Connor, 340 U. S. 602 (1951), theCourt returned to

Western Live Stock's multiple taxation
rule in Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota, 358 U. S. 450 (1959), and we categorically abandoned
the latter-day formalism when Complete Auto Transit, Inc.v.

Brady, 430 U. S. 274 (1977), overruled Spector and Freeman. In Complete Auto, a business engaged in transport-ing cars manufactured outside the taxing State to dealers

within it challenged a franchise tax assessed equally on all
gross income derived from transportation for hire within theState. The taxpayer's challenge resting solely on the fact

that the State had taxed the privilege of engaging in an in-terstate commercial activity was turned back, and in sustaining the tax, we explicitly returned to our prior decisions that

"considered not the formal language of the tax statute
but rather its practical effect, and have sustained a tax
against Commerce Clause challenge when the tax is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the
taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate
against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to the
services provided by the State." 430 U. S., at 279.

Since then, we have often applied, and somewhat refined,
what has come to be known as Complete Auto's four-part
test. See, e. g., Goldberg v. Sweet, 488 U. S. 252 (1989) (tax
on telephone calls); D. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, 486 U. S.
24 (1988) (use tax); Container Corp. of America v. Franchise

184 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. JEFFERSON LINES, INC.

Opinion of the Court

III

A
It has long been settled that a sale of tangible goods hasa sufficient nexus to the State in which the sale is consummated to be treated as a local transaction taxable by thatState. McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Coal Mining Co., 309
U. S. 33 (1940) (upholding tax on sale of coal shipped intotaxing State by seller). So, too, in addressing the interstate
provision of services, we recently held that a State in whichan interstate telephone call originates or terminates has the
requisite Commerce Clause nexus to tax a customer's pur-chase of that call as long as the call is billed or charged to a
service address, or paid by an addressee, within the taxingState.

Goldberg, supra, at 263. Oklahoma's tax falls com-fortably within these rules. Oklahoma is where the ticket

is purchased, and the service originates there. These factsare enough for concluding that "[t]here is `nexus' aplenty
here." See D. H. Holmes, supra, at 33. Indeed, the tax-payer does not deny Oklahoma's substantial nexus to the instate portion of the bus service, but rather argues that nexusto the State is insufficient as to the portion of travel outside
its borders. This point, however, goes to the second prongof

Complete Auto, to which we turn.

B
The difficult question in this case is whether the tax isproperly apportioned within the meaning of the second

prong of Complete Auto's test, "the central purpose [ofwhich] is to ensure that each State taxes only its fair share
of an interstate transaction." Goldberg, supra, at 260-261.This principle of fair share is the lineal descendant of Western Live Stock's prohibition of multiple taxation, which isthreatened whenever one State's act of overreaching combines with the possibility that another State will claim itsfair share of the value taxed: the portion of value by which

514us1$39M 06-11-98 18:17:15 PAGES OPINPGT

185Cite as: 514 U. S. 175 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
one State exceeded its fair share would be taxed again by a
State properly laying claim to it.

For over a decade now, we have assessed any threat of
malapportionment by asking whether the tax is "internally
consistent" and, if so, whether it is "externally consistent" as
well. See Goldberg, supra, at 261; Container Corp., supra,
at 169. Internal consistency is preserved when the imposition of a tax identical to the one in question by every other
State would add no burden to interstate commerce that intrastate commerce would not also bear. This test asks nothing about the degree of economic reality reflected by the tax,
but simply looks to the structure of the tax at issue to see
whether its identical application by every State in the Union
would place interstate commerce at a disadvantage as compared with commerce intrastate. A failure of internal consistency shows as a matter of law that a State is attempting
to take more than its fair share of taxes from the interstate
transaction, since allowing such a tax in one State would
place interstate commerce at the mercy of those remaining
States that might impose an identical tax. See Gwin,
White & Prince, 305 U. S., at 439. There is no failure of it
in this case, however. If every State were to impose a tax
identical to Oklahoma's, that is, a tax on ticket sales within
the State for travel originating there, no sale would be subject to more than one State's tax.

External consistency, on the other hand, looks not to the
logical consequences of cloning, but to the economic justification for the State's claim upon the value taxed, to discover
whether a State's tax reaches beyond that portion of value
that is fairly attributable to economic activity within the taxing State. See Goldberg, supra, at 262; Container Corp.,
supra, at 169-170. Here, the threat of real multiple taxation
(though not by literally identical statutes) may indicate a
State's impermissible overreaching. It is to this less tidy
world of real taxation that we turn now, and at length.

186 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. JEFFERSON LINES, INC.

Opinion of the Court

1
The very term "apportionment" tends to conjure up alloca-tion by percentages, and where taxation of income from interstate business is in issue, apportionment disputes haveoften centered around specific formulas for slicing a taxable
pie among several States in which the taxpayer's activitiescontributed to taxable value. In

Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair,437 U. S. 267 (1978), for example, we considered whether

Iowa could measure an interstate corporation's taxable in-come by attributing income to business within the State " `in
that proportion which the gross sales made within the statebear to the total gross sales.' "

Id., at 270. We held that itcould. In Container Corp., we decided whether California

could constitutionally compute taxable income assignable toa multijurisdictional enterprise's in-state activity by apportioning its combined business income according to a formula"based, in equal parts, on the proportion of [such] business'
total payroll, property, and sales which are located in thetaxing State." 463 U. S., at 170. Again, we held that it
could. Finally, in Central Greyhound, we held that NewYork's taxation of an interstate bus line's gross receipts was
constitutionally limited to that portion reflecting miles trav-eled within the taxing jurisdiction. 334 U. S., at 663.

In reviewing sales taxes for fair share, however, we havehad to set a different course. A sale of goods is most readily
viewed as a discrete event facilitated by the laws and ameni-ties of the place of sale, and the transaction itself does not
readily reveal the extent to which completed or anticipatedinterstate activity affects the value on which a buyer is
taxed. We have therefore consistently approved taxation ofsales without any division of the tax base among different
States, and have instead held such taxes properly measura-ble by the gross charge for the purchase, regardless of any
activity outside the taxing jurisdiction that might have pre-ceded the sale or might occur in the future. See,

e. g., Mc-Goldrick v. Berwind-White Coal Mining Co., supra.

187Cite as: 514 U. S. 175 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
Such has been the rule even when the parties to a salescontract specifically contemplated interstate movement of

the goods either immediately before, or after, the transfer ofownership. See,

e. g., Wardair Canada Inc. v. Florida Dept.
of Revenue, 477 U. S. 1 (1986) (upholding sales tax on airplane fuel); State Tax Comm'n of Utah v. Pacific States Cast
Iron Pipe Co., 372 U. S. 605 (1963) (per curiam) (upholding
tax on sale that contemplated purchaser's interstate ship-ment of goods immediately after sale). The sale, we held,

was "an activity which . . . is subject to the state taxingpower" so long as taxation did not "discriminat[e]" against
or "obstruc[t]" interstate commerce, Berwind-White, 309
U. S., at 58, and we found a sufficient safeguard against the
risk of impermissible multiple taxation of a sale in the fact
that it was consummated in only one State. As we put it in
Berwind-White, a necessary condition for imposing the tax
was the occurrence of "a local activity, delivery of goods
within the State upon their purchase for consumption."
Ibid. So conceived, a sales tax on coal, for example, could
not be repeated by other States, for the same coal was not
imagined ever to be delivered in two States at once. Conversely, we held that a sales tax could not validly be imposed
if the purchaser already had obtained title to the goods as
they were shipped from outside the taxing State into the
taxing State by common carrier. McLeod v. J. E. Dilworth
Co., 322 U. S. 327 (1944). The out-of-state seller in that case
"was through selling" outside the taxing State. Id., at 330.
In other words, the very conception of the common sales tax
on goods, operating on the transfer of ownership and possession at a particular time and place, insulated the buyer from
any threat of further taxation of the transaction.

In deriving this rule covering taxation to a buyer on sales
of goods we were not, of course, oblivious to the possibility
of successive taxation of related events up and down the
stream of commerce, and our cases are implicit with the understanding that the Commerce Clause does not forbid the

188 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. JEFFERSON LINES, INC.

Opinion of the Court
actual assessment of a succession of taxes by different Stateson distinct events as the same tangible object flows along.

Thus, it is a truism that a sales tax to the buyer does notpreclude a tax to the seller upon the income earned from a
sale, and there is no constitutional trouble inherent in theimposition of a sales tax in the State of delivery to the customer, even though the State of origin of the thing sold mayhave assessed a property or severance tax on it. See
Berwind-White, 309 U. S., at 53; cf. Commonwealth Edison
Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609 (1981) (upholding severancetax on coal mined within the taxing State). In light of this

settled treatment of taxes on sales of goods and other succes-sive taxes related through the stream of commerce, it is fair
to say that because the taxable event of the consummatedsale of goods has been found to be properly treated as
unique, an internally consistent, conventional sales tax haslong been held to be externally consistent as well.

2
A sale of services can ordinarily be treated as a local stateevent just as readily as a sale of tangible goods can be located solely within the State of delivery. Cf. Goldberg v.
Sweet, 488 U. S. 252 (1989). Although our decisional law onsales of services is less developed than on sales of goods, one

category of cases dealing with taxation of gross sales re-ceipts in the hands of a seller of services supports the view
that the taxable event is wholly local. Thus we have heldthat the entire gross receipts derived from sales of services
to be performed wholly in one State are taxable by thatState, notwithstanding that the contract for performance of
the services has been entered into across state lines withcustomers who reside outside the taxing State. Western
Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250 (1938). So,too, as we have already noted, even where interstate circulation contributes to the value of magazine advertising pur-chased by the customer, we have held that the Commerce
Clause does not preclude a tax on its full value by the State

189Cite as: 514 U. S. 175 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
of publication. Id., at 254, 258-259. And where the services are performed upon tangible items retrieved from and
delivered to out-of-state customers, the business performing
the services may be taxed on the full gross receipts from
the services, because they were performed wholly within the
taxing State. Department of Treasury of Ind. v. IngramRichardson Mfg. Co. of Ind., 313 U. S. 252 (1941). Interstate
activity may be essential to a substantial portion of the value
of the services in the first case and essential to performance
of the services in the second, but sales with at least partial
performance in the taxing State justify that State's taxation
of the transaction's entire gross receipts in the hands of the
seller. On the analogy sometimes drawn between sales and
gross receipts taxes, see International Harvester Co. v. Department of Treasury, 322 U. S. 340, 347-348 (1944); but see
Norton Co. v. Department of Revenue of Ill., 340 U. S. 534,
537 (1951), there would be no reason to suppose that a different apportionment would be feasible or required when the
tax falls not on the seller but on the buyer.

Cases on gross receipts from sales of services include one
falling into quite a different category, however, and it is on
this decision that the taxpayer relies for an analogy said to
control the resolution of the case before us. In 1948, the
Court decided Central Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. Mealey, 334
U. S. 653, striking down New York's gross receipts tax on
transportation services imposed without further apportionment on the total receipts from New York sales of bus services, almost half of which were actually provided by carriage
through neighboring New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The
Court held the statute fatally flawed by the failure to apportion taxable receipts in the same proportions that miles
traveled through the various States bore to the total. The
similarity of Central Greyhound to this case is, of course,
striking, and on the assumption that the economic significance of a gross receipts tax is indistinguishable from a tax
on sales the Court of Appeals held that a similar mileage

190 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. JEFFERSON LINES, INC.

Opinion of the Court
apportionment is required here, see 15 F. 3d, at 92-93, as thetaxpayer now argues.

We, however, think that Central Greyhound provides thewrong analogy for answering the sales tax apportionment
question here. To be sure, the two cases involve the identi-cal services, and apportionment by mileage per State is
equally feasible in each. But the two diverge crucially inthe identity of the taxpayers and the consequent opportunities that are understood to exist for multiple taxation of thesame taxpayer.

Central Greyhound did not rest simply onthe mathematical and administrative feasibility of a mileage

apportionment, but on the Court's express understandingthat the seller-taxpayer was exposed to taxation by New Jersey and Pennsylvania on portions of the same receipts thatNew York was taxing in their entirety. The Court thus understood the gross receipts tax to be simply a variety of taxon income, which was required to be apportioned to reflect
the location of the various interstate activities by which itwas earned. This understanding is presumably the reason
that the Central Greyhound Court said nothing about thearguably local character of the levy on the sales transaction.5 Instead, the Court heeded Berwind-White's warn-ing about "[p]rivilege taxes requiring a percentage of the
gross receipts from interstate transportation," which "if sus-tained, could be imposed wherever the interstate activity
occurs . . . ." 309 U. S., at 45-46, n. 2.Here, in contrast, the tax falls on the buyer of the services,
who is no more subject to double taxation on the sale of theseservices than the buyer of goods would be. The taxable
event comprises agreement, payment, and delivery of someof the services in the taxing State; no other State can claim
to be the site of the same combination. The economic activ-ity represented by the receipt of the ticket for "consumption"
in the form of commencement and partial provision of the

sales within New York State, 334 U. S., at 664, 666 (Murphy, J., dissenting),

Opinion of the Court
transportation thus closely resembles Berwind-White's "de-livery of goods within the State upon their purchase for consumption," id., at 58, especially given that full "consumption"or "use" of the purchased goods within the taxing State has
never been a condition for taxing a sale of those goods. Al-though the taxpayer seeks to discount these resemblances
by arguing that sale does not occur until delivery is made,nothing in our case law supports the view that when delivery
is made by services provided over time and through space aseparate sale occurs at each moment of delivery, or when
each State's segment of transportation State by State is com-plete. The analysis should not lose touch with the common
understanding of a sale, see Goldberg, 488 U. S., at 262; thecombined events of payment for a ticket and its delivery for
present commencement of a trip are commonly understoodto suffice for a sale.

In sum, the sales taxation here is not open to the doubletaxation analysis on which Central Greyhound turned, and
that decision does not control. Before we classify the Okla-homa tax with standard taxes on sales of goods, and with
the taxes on less complicated sales of services, however, twoquestions may helpfully be considered.

3
Although the sale with partial delivery cannot be dupli-cated as a taxable event in any other State, and multiple

taxation under an identical tax is thus precluded, is therea possibility of successive taxation so closely related to the
transaction as to indicate potential unfairness of Oklahoma'stax on the full amount of sale? And if the answer to that
question is no, is the very possibility of apportioning by mile-age a sufficient reason to conclude that the tax exceeds the
fair share of the State of sale?

Opinion of the Court
same threat of multiple taxation assumed to exist in thatcase: further taxation, that is, of some portion of the value

already taxed, though not under a statute in every respectidentical to Oklahoma's. But the claim does not hold up.
The taxpayer has failed to raise any specter of successivetaxes that might require us to reconsider whether an internally consistent tax on sales of services could fail the ex-ternal consistency test for lack of further apportionment (a
result that no sales tax has ever suffered under our cases).If, for example, in the face of Oklahoma's sales tax, Texas
were to levy a sustainable, apportioned gross receipts tax onthe Texas portion of travel from Oklahoma City to Dallas,
interstate travel would not be exposed to multiple taxationin any sense different from coal for which the producer may
be taxed first at point of severance by Montana and the cus-tomer may later be taxed upon its purchase in New York.
The multiple taxation placed upon interstate commerce bysuch a confluence of taxes is not a structural evil that flows
from either tax individually, but it is rather the "accidentalincident of interstate commerce being subject to two different taxing jurisdictions." Lockhart 75; See Moorman Mfg.
Co., 437 U. S., at 277.6

6 Any additional gross receipts tax imposed upon the interstate bus line
would, of course, itself have to respect well-understood constitutional
strictures. Thus, for example, Texas could not tax the bus company on
the full value of the bus service from Oklahoma City to Dallas when the
ticket is sold in Oklahoma, because that tax would, among other things,
be internally inconsistent. And if Texas were to impose a tax upon the
bus company measured by the portion of gross receipts reflecting in-state
travel, it would have to impose taxes on intrastate and interstate journeys
alike. In the event Texas chose to limit the burden of successive taxes
attributable to the same transaction by combining an apportioned gross
receipts tax with a credit for sales taxes paid to Texas, for example, it
would have to give equal treatment to service into Texas purchased subject to a sales tax in another State, which it could do by granting a credit
for sales taxes paid to any State. See, e. g., Henneford v. Silas Mason
Co., 300 U. S. 577, 583-584 (1937) (upholding use tax which provided credit
for sales taxes paid to any State); Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co. v.

Opinion of the Court
Nor has the taxpayer made out a case that Oklahoma'ssales tax exposes any buyer of a ticket in Oklahoma for

travel into another State to multiple taxation from taxes im-posed upon passengers by other States of passage. Since a
use tax, or some equivalent on the consumption of services,is generally levied to compensate the taxing State for its

Reily, 373 U. S. 64, 70 (1963) ("[E]qual treatment for in-state and out-ofstate taxpayers similarly situated is the condition precedent for a valid
use tax on goods imported from out-of-state"); Maryland v. Louisiana,
451 U. S. 725, 759 (1981) (striking down Louisiana's "first use" tax on imported gas because "the pattern of credits and exemptions allowed under
the . . . statute undeniably violates this principle of equality"); Tyler Pipe
Industries, Inc. v. Washington State Dept. of Revenue, 483 U. S. 232, 240-
248 (1987) (striking down Washington's gross receipts wholesaling tax exempting in-state, but not out-of-state, manufacturers); see also Boston
Stock Exchange v. State Tax Comm'n, 429 U. S. 318, 331-332 (1977).

Although we have not held that a State imposing an apportioned gross
receipts tax that grants a credit for sales taxes paid in state must also
extend such a credit to sales taxes paid out of state, see, e. g., Halliburton,
supra, at 77 (Brennan, J., concurring); Silas Mason, supra, at 587; see also
Williams v. Vermont, 472 U. S. 14, 21-22 (1985), we have noted that equality of treatment of interstate and intrastate activity has been the common
theme among the paired (or "compensating") tax schemes that have
passed constitutional muster, see, e. g., Boston Stock Exchange, supra, at
331-332. We have indeed never upheld a tax in the face of a substantiated charge that it provided credits for the taxpayer's payment of in-state
taxes but failed to extend such credit to payment of equivalent out-of-state
taxes. To the contrary, in upholding tax schemes providing credits for
taxes paid in state and occasioned by the same transaction, we have often
pointed to the concomitant credit provisions for taxes paid out of state as
supporting our conclusion that a particular tax passed muster because it
treated out-of-state and in-state taxpayers alike. See, e. g., Itel Containers Int'l Corp. v. Huddleston, 507 U. S. 60, 74 (1993); D. H. Holmes Co. v.
McNamara, 486 U. S. 24, 31 (1988) ("The . . . taxing scheme is fairly apportioned, for it provides a credit against its use tax for sales taxes that have
been paid in other States"); General Trading Co. v. State Tax Comm'n of
Iowa, 322 U. S. 335 (1944); Silas Mason, supra, at 584. A general requirement of equal treatment is thus amply clear from our precedent. We express no opinion on the need for equal treatment when a credit is allowed
for payment of in- or out-of-state taxes by a third party. See Darnell v.
Indiana, 226 U. S. 390 (1912).

incapacity to reach the corresponding sale, it is commonly
paired with a sales tax, see, e. g., D. H. Holmes, 486 U. S., at
31; Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Comm'n, 429 U. S.
318, 331-332 (1977); Henneford v. Silas Mason Co., 300 U. S.
577 (1937), being applicable only when no sales tax has been
paid or subject to a credit for any such tax paid. Since any
use tax would have to comply with Commerce Clause requirements, the tax scheme could not apply differently to
goods and services purchased out of state from those purchased domestically. Presumably, then, it would not apply
when another State's sales tax had previously been paid, or
would apply subject to credit for such payment. In either
event, the Oklahoma ticket purchaser would be free from
multiple taxation.

True, it is not Oklahoma that has offered to provide a
credit for related taxes paid elsewhere, but in taxing sales
Oklahoma may rely upon use-taxing States to do so. This
is merely a practical consequence of the structure of use
taxes as generally based upon the primacy of taxes on sales,
in that use of goods is taxed only to the extent that their
prior sale has escaped taxation. Indeed the District of
Columbia and 44 of the 45 States that impose sales and
use taxes permit such a credit or exemption for similar

taxes paid to other States. See 2 Hellerstein & Hellerstein
|| 18.08, p. 18-48; 1 All States Tax Guide || 256 (1994). As
one state court summarized the provisions in force:

"These credit provisions create a national system under
which the first state of purchase or use imposes the tax.
Thereafter, no other state taxes the transaction unless
there has been no prior tax imposed . . . or if the tax
rate of the prior taxing state is less, in which case the
subsequent taxing state imposes a tax measured only
by the differential rate." KSS Transportation Corp. v.
Baldwin, 9 N. J. Tax 273, 285 (1987).

Opinion of the Court
The case of threatened multiple taxation where a sales taxis followed by a use tax is thus distinguishable from the case

of simultaneous sales taxes considered in Goldberg, wherewe were reassured to some degree by the provision of a
credit in the disputed tax itself for similar taxes placed uponthe taxpayer by other States. See

Goldberg, 488 U. S., at264 ("To the extent that other States' telecommunications

taxes pose a risk of multiple taxation, the credit provisioncontained in the [t]ax [a]ct operates to avoid actual multiple
taxation"). In that case, unlike the sales and use schemesposited for the sake of argument here, each of the competing
sales taxes would presumably have laid an equal claim onthe taxpayer's purse.

b
Finally, Jefferson points to the fact that in this case, unlikethe telephone communication tax at issue in

Goldberg, Okla-homa could feasibly apportion its sales tax on the basis of

mileage as we required New York's gross receipts tax to doin

Central Greyhound. Although Goldberg indeed notedthat "[a]n apportionment formula based on mileage or some

other geographic division of individual telephone calls wouldproduce insurmountable administrative and technological
barriers," 488 U. S., at 264-265, and although we agree thatno comparable barriers exist here, we nonetheless reject the
idea that a particular apportionment formula must be usedsimply because it would be possible to use it. We have
never required that any particular apportionment formula or
method be used, and when a State has chosen one, an object-ing taxpayer has the burden to demonstrate by " `clear and

cogent evidence,' " that " `the income attributed to the State
is in fact out of all appropriate proportions to the businesstransacted . . . in that State, or has led to a grossly distorted

result.' " Container Corp., 463 U. S., at 170, quoting Moorman Mfg. Co., 437 U. S., at 274 (internal quotation marks
omitted; citations omitted). That is too much for Jefferson

Opinion of the Court
to bear in this case. It fails to show that Oklahoma's tax onthe sale of transportation imputes economic activity to the

State of sale in any way substantially different from thatimputed by the garden-variety sales tax, which we have perennially sustained, even though levied on goods that havetraveled in interstate commerce to the point of sale or that
will move across state lines thereafter. See, e. g., Wardair
Canada Inc. v. Florida Dept. of Revenue, 477 U. S. 1 (1986);McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Coal Mining Co., 309 U. S. 33

(1940); State Tax Comm'n of Utah v. Pacific States Cast Iron
Pipe Co., 372 U. S. 605 (1963); see also Western Live Stock,
303 U. S., at 259 (upholding tax where measure of the tax
"include[s] the augmentation attributable to the [interstate]commerce in which [the object of the tax] is employed");

Goldberg, 488 U. S., at 262 (upholding tax upon the purchaseof an interstate telephone call which had "many of the characteristics of a sales tax . . . [e]ven though such a retail pur-chase is not a purely local event since it triggers simultaneous activity in several States"). Nor does Oklahoma's taxraise any greater threat of multiple taxation than those sales
taxes that have passed muster time and again. There is
thus no reason to leave the line of longstanding precedentand lose the simplicity of our general rule sustaining sales

taxes measured by full value, simply to carve out an excep-tion for the subcategory of sales of interstate transportation
services. We accordingly conclude that Oklahoma's tax onticket sales for travel originating in Oklahoma is externally
consistent, as reaching only the activity taking place withinthe taxing State, that is, the sale of the service. Cf.

tax principles in favor of an analogy between sales and gross receipts

We now turn to the remaining two portions of Complete
Auto's test, which require that the tax must "not discrimi-nate against interstate commerce," and must be "fairly related to the services provided by the State." 430 U. S., at279. Oklahoma's tax meets these demands.

A State may not "impose a tax which discriminates againstinterstate commerce . . . by providing a direct commercial
advantage to local business." Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota, 358 U. S., at 458; see alsoAmerican Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. 266,

269 (1987). Thus, States are barred from discriminatingagainst foreign enterprises competing with local businesses,
see, e. g., id., at 286, and from discriminating against commer-cial activity occurring outside the taxing State, see, e. g., Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Comm'n, 429 U. S. 318(1977). No argument has been made that Oklahoma disdence. Our decisions cannot be reconciled with the view that two taxes
must inevitably be equated for purposes of constitutional analysis by virtue of the fact that both will ultimately be "pass[ed] . . . along to the
customer" or calculated in a similar fashion, ibid. Indeed, were that to
be the case, we could not, for example, dismiss successive taxation of the
extraction, sale, and income from the sale of coal as consistent with the
Commerce Clause's prohibition against multiple taxation.

Justice Breyer's opinion illuminates the difference between his view
and our own in its suggestion, post, at 206, that our disagreement turns
on differing assessments of the force of competing analogies. His analogy
to Central Greyhound derives strength from characterizing the tax as
falling on "interstate travel," post, at 207, or "transportation," post, at 202.
Our analogy to prior cases on taxing sales of goods and services derives
force from identifying the taxpayer in categorizing the tax and from the
value of a uniform rule governing taxation on the occasion of what is
generally understood as a sales transaction. The significance of the taxpayer's identity is, indeed, central to the Court's longstanding recognition
of structural differences that permit successive taxation as an incident of
multiple taxing jurisdictions. The decision today is only the latest example of such a recognition and brings us as close to simplicity as the conceptual distinction between sales and income taxation is likely to allow.

Opinion of the Court
criminates against out-of-state enterprises, and there is nomerit in the argument that the tax discriminates against interstate activity.The argument proffered by Jefferson and

amicus Greyhound Lines is largely a rewriting of the apportionment challenge rejected above, and our response needs no reiterationhere. See Brief for Respondent 40; Brief for Greyhound

Lines, Inc., as Amicus Curiae 20-27. Jefferson takes theadditional position, however, that Oklahoma discriminates
against out-of-state travel by taxing a ticket "at the full 4%rate" regardless of whether the ticket relates to "a route
entirely within Oklahoma" or to travel "only 10 percent
within Oklahoma." Brief for Respondent 40. In making
the same point, amicus Greyhound invokes our decision in
Scheiner, which struck down Pennsylvania's flat tax on all
trucks traveling in and through the State as "plainly discriminatory." 483 U. S., at 286. But that case is not on point.

In Scheiner, we held that a flat tax on trucks for the privilege of using Pennsylvania's roads discriminated against interstate travel, by imposing a cost per mile upon out-of-state
trucks far exceeding the cost per mile borne by local trucks
that generally traveled more miles on Pennsylvania roads.
Ibid. The tax here differs from the one in Scheiner, however, by being imposed not upon the use of the State's roads,
but upon "the freedom of purchase." McLeod v. J. E. Dilworth Co., 322 U. S., at 330. However complementary the
goals of sales and use taxes may be, the taxable event for
one is the sale of the service, not the buyer's enjoyment or
the privilege of using Oklahoma's roads. Since Oklahoma
facilitates purchases of the services equally for intrastate
and interstate travelers, all buyers pay tax at the same rate
on the value of their purchases. See D. H. Holmes, 486
U. S., at 32; cf. Scheiner, supra, at 291 ("[T]he amount of
Pennsylvania's . . . taxes owed by a trucker does not vary
directly . . . with some . . . proxy for value obtained from
the State"). Thus, even if dividing Oklahoma sales taxes by

Opinion of the Court
in-state miles to be traveled produces on average a higherfigure when interstate trips are sold than when the sale is of

a wholly domestic journey, there is no discrimination againstinterstate travel; miles traveled within the State simply are
not a relevant proxy for the benefit conferred upon the par-ties to a sales transaction. As with a tax on the sale of
tangible goods, the potential for interstate movement afterthe sale has no bearing on the reason for the sales tax. See,
e. g., Wardair Canada Inc. v. Florida Dept. of Revenue, 477U. S. 1 (1986) (upholding sales tax on airplane fuel); cf.

Com-monwealth Edison Co., 453 U. S., at 617-619 (same for severance tax). Only Oklahoma can tax a sale of transportationto begin in that State, and it imposes the same duty on
equally valued purchases regardless of whether the purchaseprompts interstate or only intrastate movement. There is
no discrimination against interstate commerce.

D
Finally, the Commerce Clause demands a fair relationbetween a tax and the benefits conferred upon the taxpayer

by the State. See Goldberg, 488 U. S., at 266-267; D. H.Holmes, supra, at 32-34; Commonwealth Edison, supra, at
621-629. The taxpayer argues that the tax fails this finalprong because the buyer's only benefits from the taxing
State occur during the portion of the journey that takesplace in Oklahoma. The taxpayer misunderstands the import of this last requirement.The fair relation prong of

Complete Auto requires no de-tailed accounting of the services provided to the taxpayer on

account of the activity being taxed, nor, indeed, is a Statelimited to offsetting the public costs created by the taxed
activity. If the event is taxable, the proceeds from the taxmay ordinarily be used for purposes unrelated to the taxable
event. Interstate commerce may thus be made to pay itsfair share of state expenses and " `contribute to the cost of
providing all governmental services, including those serv514us1$39M 06-11-98 18:17:16 PAGES OPINPGT

ices from which it arguably receives no direct "benefit." ' "Goldberg, supra, at 267, quoting Commonwealth Edison,

supra, at 627, n. 16 (emphasis in original). The bus terminalmay not catch fire during the sale, and no robbery there may
be foiled while the buyer is getting his ticket, but police andfire protection, along with the usual and usually forgotten
advantages conferred by the State's maintenance of a civi-lized society, are justifications enough for the imposition of a
tax. See Goldberg, supra, at 267. Complete Auto's fourthcriterion asks only that the measure of the tax be reasonably
related to the taxpayer's presence or activities in the State.See

Commonwealth Edison, supra, at 626, 629. What wehave already said shows that demand to be satisfied here.

The tax falls on the sale that takes place wholly inside Okla-homa and is measured by the value of the service purchased.

Oklahoma's tax on the sale of transportation services doesnot contravene the Commerce Clause. The judgment of

the Court of Appeals is reversed, accordingly, and the caseis remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion. It is so ordered.

I agree with the Court's conclusion that Oklahoma's salestax does not facially discriminate against interstate commerce. See ante, at 198-199. That seems to me the mostwe can demand to certify compliance with the "negative
Commerce Clause"--which is "negative" not only because itnegates state regulation of commerce, but also because it
does not appear in the Constitution. See Amerada HessCorp. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, N. J. Dept. of Treasury,

Revenue, 483 U. S. 232, 254, 259-265 (1987) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).

I would not apply the remainder of the eminently unhelpful, so-called "four-part test" of Complete Auto Transit, Inc.
v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274, 279 (1977). Under the real Commerce Clause ("The Congress shall have Power . . . To regulate Commerce . . . among the several States," U. S. Const.,
Art. I, $ 8), it is for Congress to make the judgment that
interstate commerce must be immunized from certain sorts
of nondiscriminatory state action--a judgment that may embrace (as ours ought not) such imponderables as how much
"value [is] fairly attributable to economic activity within the
taxing State," and what constitutes "fair relation between
a tax and the benefits conferred upon the taxpayer by the
State." Ante, at 185, 199 (emphases added). See Tyler
Pipe, supra, at 259. I look forward to the day when Complete Auto will take its rightful place in Part II of the Court's
opinion, among the other useless and discarded tools of our
negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice O'Connor joins,
dissenting.

Despite the Court's lucid and thorough discussion of the
relevant law, I am unable to join its conclusion for one simple
reason. Like the judges of the Court of Appeals, I believe
the tax at issue here and the tax that this Court held unconstitutional in Central Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. Mealey, 334
U. S. 653 (1948), are, for all relevant purposes, identical.
Both cases involve taxes imposed upon interstate bus transportation. In neither case did the State apportion the tax
to avoid taxing that portion of the interstate activity performed in other States. And, I find no other distinguishing
features. Hence, I would hold that the tax before us violates the Constitution for the reasons this Court set forth in
Central Greyhound.

Breyer, J., dissenting
Central Greyhound considered a tax imposed by the State
of New York on utilities doing business in New York--a tax
called " `[e]mergency tax on the furnishing of utility services.' " Id., at 664 (Murphy, J., dissenting) (quoting New
York Tax Law $ 186-a). That tax was equal to "two per
centum" of "gross income," defined to include "receipts received . . . by reason of any sale . . . made" in New York.
334 U. S., at 664. The New York taxing authorities had applied the tax to gross receipts from sales (in New York) of
bus transportation between New York City and cities in upstate New York over routes that cut across New Jersey and
Pennsylvania. Id., at 654. The out-of-state portion of the
trips accounted for just over 40 percent of total mileage.
Id., at 660.

Justice Frankfurter wrote for the Central Greyhound
Court that "it is interstate commerce which the State is
seeking to reach," id., at 661; that the "real question [is]
whether what the State is exacting is a constitutionally fair
demand . . . for that aspect of the interstate commerce to
which the State bears a special relation," ibid.; and that by
"its very nature an unapportioned gross receipts tax makes
interstate transportation bear more than `a fair share of the
cost of the local government whose protection it enjoys,' "
id., at 663 (quoting Freeman v. Hewit, 329 U. S. 249, 253
(1946)). The Court noted:

"If New Jersey and Pennsylvania could claim their right
to make appropriately apportioned claims against that
substantial part of the business of appellant to which
they afford protection, we do not see how on principle
and in precedent such a claim could be denied. This
being so, to allow New York to impose a tax on the gross
receipts for the entire mileage--on the 57.47% within
New York as well as the 42.53% without--would subject
interstate commerce to the unfair burden of being taxed

tection to those portions, as well as to a State whichdoes not." 334 U. S., at 662.

The Court essentially held that the tax lacked what itwould later describe as "external consistency." Container
Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U. S. 159, 169(1983). That is to say, the New York law violated the Commerce Clause because it tried to tax significantly more than"that portion of the revenues from the interstate activity
which reasonably reflects the in-state component of the ac-tivity being taxed."

Goldberg v. Sweet, 488 U. S. 252, 262(1989).

The tax before us bears an uncanny resemblance to theNew York tax. The Oklahoma statute (as applied to
"[t]ransportation . . . by common carriers") imposes an"excise tax" of 4% on "the gross receipts or gross proceeds
of each sale" made in Oklahoma. Okla. Stat., Tit. 68,$ 1354(1)(C) (Supp. 1988) (emphasis added). The New York
statute imposed a 2% tax on the "receipts received . . . byreason

of any sale . . . made" in New York. See supra, at202 (emphasis added). Oklahoma imposes its tax on the

total value of trips of which a large portion may take placein other States. New York imposed its tax on the total
value of trips of which a large portion took place in otherStates. New York made no effort to apportion the tax
to reflect the comparative cost or value of the in-state andout-of-state portions of the trips. Neither does Oklahoma.
Where, then, can one find a critical difference?Not in the language of the two statutes, which differs only
slightly. Oklahoma calls its statute an "excise tax" and "lev-ie[s]" the tax "upon all sales" of transportation. New York
called its tax an "[e]mergency tax on . . . services" and leviedthe tax on " `gross income,' " defined to include " `receipts . . .
of any sale.' " This linguistic difference, however, is not sig-nificant. As the majority properly recognizes, purely formal
differences in terminology should not make a constitutionaldifference. Ante, at 183. In both instances, the State im514us1$39Q 06-11-98 18:17:16 PAGES OPINPGT
204 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. JEFFERSON LINES, INC.

Breyer, J., dissenting
poses the tax on gross receipts as measured by sales. Bothtaxes, then, would seem to have the same practical effect on

the, inherently interstate, bus transportation activity. Ifthe

Central Greyhound Court was willing to look through
New York's formal labels ("[e]mergency tax on . . . services";
"gross income" tax) to the substance (a tax on gross receiptsfrom sales), why should this Court not do the same?

The majority sees a number of reasons why the result hereshould be different from that in

Central Greyhound, but I
do not think any is persuasive. First, the majority pointsout that the New York law required a seller, the bus company, to pay the tax, whereas the Oklahoma law says that
the "tax . . . shall be paid by the consumer or user to the
vendor." Okla. Stat., Tit. 68, $ 1361(A) (Supp. 1988). This
difference leads the majority to characterize the former as a
"gross receipts" tax and the latter as a constitutionally distinguishable "sales tax." This difference, however, seems
more a formal, than a practical difference. The Oklahoma
law makes the bus company ("the vendor") and "each principal officer . . . personally liable" for the tax, whether or not
they collect it from the customer. Ibid. Oklahoma (as far
as I can tell) has never tried to collect the tax directly from
a customer. And, in any event, the statute tells the customer to pay the tax, not to the State, but "to the vendor."
Ibid. The upshot is that, as a practical matter, in respect to
both taxes, the State will calculate the tax bill by multiplying the rate times gross receipts from sales; the bus company
will pay the tax bill; and, the company will pass the tax along
to the customer.

Second, the majority believes that this case presents a significantly smaller likelihood than did Central Greyhound that
the out-of-state portions of a bus trip will be taxed both "by
States which give protection to those portions, as well as
[by] . . . a State which does not." Central Greyhound, 334
U. S., at 662. There is at least a hint in the Court's opinion
that this is so because the "taxable event" to which the Okla514us1$39Q 06-11-98 18:17:16 PAGES OPINPGT

205Cite as: 514 U. S. 175 (1995)
Breyer, J., dissenting
homa tax attaches is not the interstate transportation of pas-sengers but the sale of a bus ticket (combined, perhaps, with

transportation to the state line). See ante, at 190 ("The tax-able event comprises agreement, payment, and delivery of
some of the services in the taxing State . . ."). Thus, the
majority suggests that a tax on transportation (as opposedto the sale of a bus ticket) by a different State might be

"successive," ante, at 192, but is not "double taxation" in aconstitutionally relevant way,

ante, at 191; see ante, at 190
("[N]o other State can claim to be the site of the same combi-nation"). I concede that Oklahoma could have a tax of the

kind envisioned, namely, one that would tax the bus company
for the privilege of selling tickets. But, whether or not such
a tax would pass constitutional muster should depend upon
its practical effects. To suggest that the tax here is constitutional simply because it lends itself to recharacterizing the
taxable event as a "sale" is to ignore economic reality. Because the sales tax is framed as a percentage of the ticket
price, it seems clear that the activity Oklahoma intends to
tax is the transportation of passengers--not some other kind
of conduct (like selling tickets).

In any event, the majority itself does not seem to believe
that Oklahoma is taxing something other than bus transportation; it seems to acknowledge the risk of multiple taxation.
The Court creates an ingenious set of constitutionally based
taxing rules in footnote 6--designed to show that any other
State that imposes, say, a gross receipts tax on its share of
bus ticket sales would likely have to grant a credit for the
Oklahoma sales tax (unless it forced its own citizens to pay
both a sales tax and a gross receipts tax). But, one might
have said the same in Central Greyhound. Instead of enforcing its apportionment requirement, the Court could have
simply said that once one State, like New York, imposes a
gross receipts tax on "receipts received . . . by reason of any
sale . . . made" in that State, any other State, trying to tax
the gross receipts of its share of bus ticket sales, might have

206 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. JEFFERSON LINES, INC.

Breyer, J., dissenting
to give some kind of credit. The difficulties with this ap-proach lie in its complexity and our own inability to foresee

all the ways in which other States might effectively tax theirown portion of the journey now (also) taxed by Oklahoma.
Under the Court's footnote rules, is not a traveler who buys
a ticket in Oklahoma still threatened with a duplicative taxby a State that does

not impose a sales tax on transportation
(and thus, would not have to offer a credit for the sales taxpaid in Oklahoma)? Even if that were not so, the constitutional problem would remain, namely, that Oklahoma is im-posing an unapportioned tax on the portion of travel outside
the State, just as did New York.

Finally, the majority finds support in Goldberg v. Sweet,
488 U. S. 252 (1989), a case in which this Court permitted
Illinois to tax interstate telephone calls that originated, or
terminated, in that State. However, the Goldberg Court
was careful to distinguish "cases [dealing] with the movement of large physical objects over identifiable routes, where
it was practicable to keep track of the distance actually traveled within the taxing State," id., at 264, and listed Central
Greyhound as one of those cases, 488 U. S., at 264. Telephone service, the Goldberg Court said, differed from movement of the kind at issue in Central Greyhound, in that, at
least arguably, the service itself is consumed wholly within
one State, or possibly two--those in which the call is charged
to a service address or paid by an addressee. 488 U. S., at
263. Regardless of whether telephones and buses are more
alike than different, the Goldberg Court did not purport to
modify Central Greyhound, nor does the majority. In any
event, the Goldberg Court said, the tax at issue credited taxpayers for similar taxes assessed by other States. 488 U. S.,
at 264.

Ultimately, I may differ with the majority simply because
I assess differently the comparative force of two competing
analogies. The majority finds determinative this Court's
case law concerning sales taxes applied to the sale of goods,

207Cite as: 514 U. S. 175 (1995)
Breyer, J., dissenting
which cases, for example, permit one State to impose a sever-ance tax and another a sales tax on the same physical item

(say, coal). In my view, however, the analogy to sales taxesis not as strong as the analogy to the tax at issue in Central
Greyhound. After all, the tax before us is not a tax imposedupon a product that was made in a different State or was
consumed in a different State or is made up of ingredientsthat come from a different State or has itself moved in interstate commerce. Rather, it is a tax imposed upon interstatetravel itself--the very essence of interstate commerce.
And, it is a fairly obvious effort to tax more than "that por-tion" of the "interstate activity['s]" revenue "which reasonably reflects the in-state component." Goldberg v. Sweet,supra, at 262. I would reaffirm the Central Greyhound
principle, even if doing so requires different treatment forthe inherently interstate service of interstate transportation,
and denies the possibility of having a single, formal consti-tutional rule for all self-described "sales taxes." The Court
of Appeals wrote that this "is a classic instance of an unap-portioned tax" upon interstate commerce.

In re JeffersonLines, Inc., 15 F. 3d 90, 93 (CA8 1994). In my view, that is

right. I respectfully dissent.

WHITAKER v. SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA,SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY (MERRILL REESE,

INC., REAL PARTY IN INTEREST)
on motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis

No. 94-7743. Decided April 17, 1995
Since 1987, pro se petitioner Whitaker has filed 24 claims for relief, including 18 petitions for certiorari, all of which have been denied without recorded dissent. Earlier this Term, this Court directed the Clerk
of the Court not to accept further petitions for extraordinary writs from
Whitaker in noncriminal matters unless he pays the required docketing fee and submits his petitions in compliance with Rule 33, In re
Whitaker, 513 U. S. 1, 2, and warned Whitaker about his frequent filing
patterns with respect to petitions for writ of certiorari, ibid.

Held: Pursuant to this Court's Rule 39.8, Whitaker is denied leave to

proceed in forma pauperis in the instant case, and the Clerk is instructed not to accept any further petitions for certiorari from him
in noncriminal matters unless he pays the required docketing fee and
submits his petitions in compliance with Rule 33. Like other similar
orders this Court has issued, see, e. g., In re Sassower, 510 U. S. 4, this
order will allow the Court to devote its limited resources to the claims
of petitioners who have not abused the Court's process.

Motion denied.

Per Curiam.
Pro se petitioner Fred Whitaker has filed a petition forwrit of certiorari and requests leave to proceed in forma

pauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. Pursuant to Rule39.8, we deny petitioner's request to proceed

in forma pau-peris.* Petitioner is allowed until May 8, 1995, to pay the

docketing fees required by Rule 38 and to submit his petitionin compliance with this Court's Rule 33. For the reasons
explained below, we also direct the Clerk of the Court not to

*Rule 39.8 provides: "If satisfied that a petition for a writ of certiorari,
jurisdictional statement, or petition for an extraordinary writ, as the case
may be, is frivolous or malicious, the Court may deny a motion for leave
to proceed in forma pauperis."

accept any further petitions for certiorari from petitioner innoncriminal matters unless he pays the docketing fees required by Rule 38 and submits his petition in compliancewith Rule 33.

Petitioner is a prolific filer in this Court. Since 1987, he
has filed 24 petitions for relief, including 6 petitions forextraordinary relief and 18 petitions for certiorari. Fifteen

of the twenty-four petitions have been filed in the last fourTerms, and we have denied all 24 petitions without recorded
dissent. We also have denied petitioner leave to proceed
in forma pauperis pursuant to Rule 39.8 of this Court for
the last three petitions in which he has sought extraordinary
relief. See In re Whitaker, 513 U. S. 1 (1994); In re Whitaker, 511 U. S. 1105 (1994); In re Whitaker, 506 U. S. 983
(1992). And earlier this Term, we directed the Clerk of
the Court "not to accept any further petitions for extraordinary writs from petitioner in noncriminal matters unless he
pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38(a) and submits
his petition in compliance with Rule 33." 513 U. S., at 2.
Though we warned petitioner at that time about his "frequent filing patterns with respect to petitions for writ of
certiorari," ibid., we limited our sanction to petitions for extraordinary writs.

We now find it necessary to extend that sanction to petitions for certiorari filed by petitioner. In what appears to
be an attempt to circumvent this Court's prior order, petitioner has labeled his instant petition a "petition for writ of
certiorari" even though it would seem to be more aptly
termed a "petition for an extraordinary writ": He argues
that the California Supreme Court erred in denying his petition for review of a California Court of Appeals order
which denied his petition for writ of mandate/prohibition
seeking to compel a California trial judge to make a particular ruling in a civil action filed by petitioner. And the legal
arguments petitioner makes in his instant "petition for writ
of certiorari" are, just as those made in his previous 18 pe514us1$40H 06-11-98 18:18:53 PAGES OPINPGT

titions for certiorari, frivolous. As we told petitioner ear-lier this Term, "[t]he goal of fairly dispensing justice . . .

is compromised when the Court is forced to devote its lim-ited resources to the processing of repetitious and frivolous
requests." Ibid. (internal quotation marks and citationomitted).

Petitioner's abuse of petitions for certiorari has occurredonly in noncriminal cases, and we limit our sanction accordingly. This order therefore will not prevent petitioner fromfiling a petition for certiorari to challenge criminal sanctions
that might be imposed upon him. But like other similar or-ders we have issued, see

In re Sassower, 510 U. S. 4 (1993);
Day v. Day, 510 U. S. 1 (1993); Demos v. Storrie, 507 U. S.290 (1993); Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals,

506 U. S. 1 (1992), this order will allow the Court to devoteits limited resources to the claims of petitioners who have
not abused our process. It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
A simple denial would adequately serve the laudable goalof conserving the Court's "limited resources."

Syllabus

PLAUT et al. v. SPENDTHRIFT FARM, INC., et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 93-1121. Argued November 30, 1994--Decided April 18, 1995
In a 1987 civil action, petitioners alleged that in 1983 and 1984 respondents

committed fraud and deceit in the sale of stock in violation of $ 10(b) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities
and Exchange Commission. The District Court dismissed the action
with prejudice following this Court's decision in Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind,
Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350, 364, which required
that suits such as petitioners' be commenced within one year after the
discovery of the facts constituting the violation and within three years
after such violation. After the judgment became final, Congress enacted $ 27A(b) of the 1934 Act, which provides for reinstatement on motion of any action commenced pre-Lampf but dismissed thereafter as
time barred, if the action would have been timely filed under applicable
pre-Lampf state law. Although finding that the statute's terms required that petitioners' ensuing $ 27A(b) motion be granted, the District
Court denied the motion on the ground that $ 27A(b) is unconstitutional.
The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: Section 27A(b) contravenes the Constitution's separation of powers

to the extent that it requires federal courts to reopen final judgments
entered before its enactment. Pp. 215-240.

(a) Despite respondents' arguments to the contrary, there is no reasonable construction on which $ 27A(b) does not require federal courts
to reopen final judgments in suits dismissed with prejudice by virtue of
Lampf. Pp. 215-217.

(b) Article III establishes a "judicial department" with the "province
and duty . . . to say what the law is" in particular cases and controversies. Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177. The Framers crafted
this charter with an expressed understanding that it gives the Federal
Judiciary the power, not merely to rule on cases, but to decide them
conclusively, subject to review only by superior courts in the Article III
hierarchy. Thus, the Constitution forbids the Legislature to interfere
with courts' final judgments. Pp. 219-225.

(c) Section 27A(b) effects a clear violation of the foregoing principle
by retroactively commanding the federal courts to reopen final judgments. This Court's decisions have uniformly provided fair warning
that retroactive legislation such as $ 27A(b) exceeds congressional pow514us1$41z 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT

Syllabus
ers. See, e. g., Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S. S.
Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 113. Petitioners are correct that when a new law
makes clear that it is retroactive, an appellate court must apply it in
reviewing judgments still on appeal, and must alter the outcome accordingly. However, once a judgment has achieved finality in the highest
court in the hierarchy, the decision becomes the last word of the judicial
department with regard to the particular case or controversy, and Congress may not declare by retroactive legislation that the law applicable
to that case was in fact something other than it was. It is irrelevant
that $ 27A(b) reopens (or directs the reopening of) final judgments in a
whole class of cases rather than in a particular suit, and that the final
judgments so reopened rested on the bar of a statute of limitations
rather than on some other ground. Pp. 225-230.

(d) Apart from $ 27A(b), the Court knows of no instance in which
Congress has attempted to set aside the final judgment of an Article III
court by retroactive legislation. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(b), 20 U. S. C.

$ 1415(e)(4), 28 U. S. C. $ 2255, 50 U. S. C. App. $ 520(4), and, e. g., the
statutes at issue in United States v. Sioux Nation, 448 U. S. 371, 391-
392, Sampeyreac v. United States, 7 Pet. 222, 238, Paramino Lumber
Co. v. Marshall, 309 U. S. 370, and Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co., 18 How. 421, distinguished. Congress's prolonged reticence would be amazing if such interference were not understood to be
constitutionally proscribed by the Constitution's separation of powers.
The Court rejects the suggestion that $ 27A(b) might be constitutional
if it exhibited prospectivity or a greater degree of general applicability. Pp. 230-240.

1 F. 3d 1487, affirmed.

Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist,

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question presented in this case is whether $ 27A(b) ofthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, to the extent that it

In 1987, petitioners brought a civil action against respond-ents in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky. The complaint alleged that in 1983 and1984 respondents had committed fraud and deceit in the sale
of stock in violation of $ 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Actof 1934 and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The case was mired in pretrial proceedings in theDistrict Court until June 20, 1991, when we decided

Lampf,
Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S.350. Lampf held that "[l]itigation instituted pursuant to

364. We applied that holding to the plaintiff-respondentsin Lampf itself, found their suit untimely, and reinstated

a summary judgment previously entered in favor of thedefendant-petitioners. Ibid. On the same day we decided
James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529(1991), in which a majority of the Court held, albeit in different opinions, that a new rule of federal law that is applied tothe parties in the case announcing the rule must be applied
as well to all cases pending on direct review. See Harper v.
Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 509 U. S. 86, 92 (1993). Thejoint effect of Lampf and Beam was to mandate application

of the 1-year/3-year limitations period to petitioners' suit.The District Court, finding that petitioners' claims were untimely under the Lampf rule, dismissed their action withprejudice on August 13, 1991. Petitioners filed no appeal;
the judgment accordingly became final 30 days later. See28 U. S. C. $ 2107(a) (1988 ed., Supp. V);

Griffith v. Kentucky,479 U. S. 314, 321, n. 6 (1987).

On December 19, 1991, the President signed the FederalDeposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991,
105 Stat. 2236. Section 476 of the Act--a section that hadnothing to do with FDIC improvements--became $ 27A of

On February 11, 1992, petitioners returned to the District
Court and filed a motion to reinstate the action previously
dismissed with prejudice. The District Court found that the
conditions set out in $$ 27A(b)(1) and (2) were met, so that
petitioners' motion was required to be granted by the terms
of the statute. It nonetheless denied the motion, agreeing
with respondents that $ 27A(b) is unconstitutional. Memorandum Opinion and Order, Civ. Action No. 87-438 (ED Ky.,

II
Respondents bravely contend that $ 27A(b) does not require federal courts to reopen final judgments, arguing first
that the reference to "the laws applicable in the jurisdiction
. . . as such laws existed on June 19, 1991" (the day before
Lampf was decided) may reasonably be construed to refer
precisely to the limitations period provided in Lampf itself,
in which case petitioners' action was time barred even under

216 PLAUT v. SPENDTHRIFT FARM, INC.

Opinion of the Court

$ 27A.2 It is true that "[a] judicial construction of a statuteis an authoritative statement of what the statute meant before as well as after the decision of the case giving rise tothat construction."

Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., 511
U. S. 298, 312-313 (1994); see also id., at 313, n. 12. But
respondents' argument confuses the question of what the law
in fact was on June 19, 1991, with the distinct question of
what $ 27A means by its reference to what the law was. Wethink it entirely clear that it does not mean the law enunciated in Lampf, for two independent reasons. First, Lampfprovides a uniform, national statute of limitations (instead of
using the applicable state limitations period, as lower federalcourts had previously done. See

Lampf, 501 U. S., at 354,
and n. 1). If the statute referred to that law, its reference
to the "laws applicable in the jurisdiction" (emphasis added)would be quite inexplicable. Second, if the statute refers to

the law enunciated in Lampf, it is utterly without effect, a
result to be avoided if possible. American Nat. Red Cross
v. S. G., 505 U. S. 247, 263-264 (1992); see 2A N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction $ 46.06 (Sands rev. 4th ed.
1984). It would say, in subsection (a), that the limitations
period is what the Supreme Court has held to be the limitations period; and in subsection (b), that suits dismissed as
untimely under Lampf which were timely under Lampf (a
null set) shall be reinstated. To avoid a constitutional question by holding that Congress enacted, and the President
approved, a blank sheet of paper would indeed constitute
"disingenuous evasion." George Moore Ice Cream Co. v.
Rose, 289 U. S. 373, 379 (1933).

2 Since respondents' reading of the statute would avoid a constitutional
question of undoubted gravity, we think it prudent to entertain the argument even though respondents did not make it in the Sixth Circuit. Of
course the Sixth Circuit did decide (against respondents) the point to
which the argument was directed. See 1 F. 3d 1487, 1490 (1993) ("The
statute's language is plain and unambiguous. . . . [It] commands the Federal
courts to reinstate cases which those courts have dismissed").

Opinion of the Court
As an alternative reason why $ 27A(b) does not require thereopening of final judgments, respondents suggest that the

subsection applies only to cases still pending in the federalcourts when $ 27A was enacted. This has only half the defect of the first argument, for it makes only half of $ 27Apurposeless--$ 27A(b). There is no need to "reinstate" actions that are still pending; $ 27A(a) (the new statute of limi-tations) could and would be applied by the courts of appeals.
On respondents' reading, the only consequence of $ 27A(b)would be the negligible one of permitting the plaintiff in the
pending appeal from a statute-of-limitations dismissal to re-turn

immediately to the district court, instead of waiting forthe court of appeals' reversal. To enable $ 27A(b) to achieve

such an insignificant consequence, one must disregard thelanguage of the provision, which refers generally to suits
"dismissed as time barred." It is perhaps arguable that thisdoes

not include suits that are not yet finally dismissed, i. e.,suits still pending on appeal; but there is no basis for the

contention that it includes only those. In short, there is noreasonable construction on which $ 27A(b) does not require
federal courts to reopen final judgments in suits dismissedwith prejudice by virtue of

Lampf.

Respondents submit that $ 27A(b) violates both the sepa-ration of powers and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth

Amendment.3 Because the latter submission, if correct,might dictate a similar result in a challenge to state legislation under the Fourteenth Amendment, the former is thenarrower ground for adjudication of the constitutional questions in the case, and we therefore consider it first. Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concur-ring). We conclude that in $ 27A(b) Congress has exceeded

its authority by requiring the federal courts to exercise

Opinion of the Court
"[t]he judicial Power of the United States," U. S. Const., Art.III, $ 1, in a manner repugnant to the text, structure, and

traditions of Article III.Our decisions to date have identified two types of legislation that require federal courts to exercise the judicial power
in a manner that Article III forbids. The first appears in
United States v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128 (1872), where we refused
to give effect to a statute that was said "[to] prescribe rulesof decision to the Judicial Department of the government in

cases pending before it." Id., at 146. Whatever the precisescope of

Klein, however, later decisions have made clear that
its prohibition does not take hold when Congress "amend[s]
applicable law." Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Soc., 503
U. S. 429, 441 (1992). Section 27A(b) indisputably does set
out substantive legal standards for the Judiciary to apply,
and in that sense changes the law (even if solely retroactively). The second type of unconstitutional restriction
upon the exercise of judicial power identified by past cases
is exemplified by Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409 (1792), which
stands for the principle that Congress cannot vest review of
the decisions of Article III courts in officials of the Executive
Branch. See, e. g., Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v.
Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103 (1948). Yet under any
application of $ 27A(b) only courts are involved; no officials
of other departments sit in direct review of their decisions.
Section 27A(b) therefore offends neither of these previously
established prohibitions.

We think, however, that $ 27A(b) offends a postulate of Article III just as deeply rooted in our law as those we have
mentioned. Article III establishes a "judicial department"
with the "province and duty . . . to say what the law is" in
particular cases and controversies. Marbury v. Madison, 1
Cranch 137, 177 (1803). The record of history shows that
the Framers crafted this charter of the judicial department
with an expressed understanding that it gives the Federal
Judiciary the power, not merely to rule on cases, but to de514us1$41k 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT

cide them, subject to review only by superior courts in theArticle III hierarchy--with an understanding, in short, that

"a judgment conclusively resolves the case" because "a `judi-cial Power' is one to render dispositive judgments." Easterbrook, Presidential Review, 40 Case W. Res. L. Rev. 905,926 (1990). By retroactively commanding the federal courts
to reopen final judgments, Congress has violated this funda-mental principle.

A
The Framers of our Constitution lived among the ruins ofa system of intermingled legislative and judicial powers,

which had been prevalent in the colonies long before theRevolution, and which after the Revolution had produced
factional strife and partisan oppression. In the 17th and18th centuries colonial assemblies and legislatures functioned as courts of equity of last resort, hearing original ac-tions or providing appellate review of judicial judgments.
G. Wood, The Creation of the American Republic 1776-1787,pp. 154-155 (1969). Often, however, they chose to correct
the judicial process through special bills or other enactedlegislation. It was common for such legislation not to prescribe a resolution of the dispute, but rather simply to setaside the judgment and order a new trial or appeal. M.
Clarke, Parliamentary Privilege in the American Colonies49-51 (1943). See, e. g., Judicial Action by the Provincial
Legislature of Massachusetts, 15 Harv. L. Rev. 208 (1902)(collecting documents from 1708-1709); 5 Laws of New
Hampshire, Including Public and Private Acts, Resolves,Votes, Etc., 1784-1792 (Metcalf ed. 1916). Thus, as described in our discussion of Hayburn's Case, supra, at 218,such legislation bears not on the problem of interbranch
review but on the problem of finality of judicial judgments.The vigorous, indeed often radical, populism of the revolutionary legislatures and assemblies increased the frequencyof legislative correction of judgments. Wood,

supra, at 155-156, 407-408. See also INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 961

(1983) (Powell, J., concurring). "The period 1780-1787 . . .was a period of `constitutional reaction' " to these developments, "which . . . leaped suddenly to its climax in the Phila-delphia Convention." E. Corwin, The Doctrine of Judicial
Review 37 (1914). Voices from many quarters, official as
well as private, decried the increasing legislative interfer-ence with the private-law judgments of the courts. In 1786,

the Vermont Council of Censors issued an "Address of theCouncil of Censors to the Freemen of the State of Vermont"
to fulfill the council's duty, under the State Constitution of1784, to report to the people " `whether the legislative and
executive branches of government have assumed to them-selves, or exercised, other or greater powers than they are
entitled to by the Constitution.' " Vermont State Papers
1779-1786, pp. 531, 533 (Slade ed. 1823). A principal methodof usurpation identified by the censors was "[t]he instances

. . . of judgments being vacated by legislative acts." Id., at540. The council delivered an opinion

"that the General Assembly, in all the instances wherethey have vacated judgments, recovered in due course
of law, (except where the particular circumstances of thecase evidently made it necessary to grant a new trial)
have exercised a power not delegated, or intended to bedelegated, to them, by the Constitution. . . . It supercedes the necessity of any other law than the pleasureof the Assembly, and of any other court than themselves:
for it is an imposition on the suitor, to give him the trouble of obtaining, after several expensive trials, a finaljudgment agreeably to the known established laws of

the land; if the Legislature, by a sovereign act, can interfere, reverse the judgment, and decree in such manner,
as they, unfettered by rules, shall think proper." Ibid.

So too, the famous report of the Pennsylvania Council of
Censors in 1784 detailed the abuses of legislative interference with the courts at the behest of private interests and

factions. As the General Assembly had (they wrote) madea custom of "extending their deliberations to the cases of

individuals," the people had "been taught to consider an ap-plication to the legislature, as a shorter and more certain
mode of obtaining relief from hardships and losses, than the
usual process of law." The censors noted that because "fa-vour and partiality have, from the nature of public bodies of

men, predominated in the distribution of this relief . . . [t]hesedangerous procedures have been too often recurred to, since
the revolution." Report of the Committee of the Council ofCensors 6 (Bailey ed. 1784).

This sense of a sharp necessity to separate the legislative
from the judicial power, prompted by the crescendo of legislative interference with private judgments of the courts, triumphed among the Framers of the new Federal Constitution.
See Corwin, The Progress of Constitutional Theory Between
the Declaration of Independence and the Meeting of the Philadelphia Convention, 30 Am. Hist. Rev. 511, 514-517 (1925).
The Convention made the critical decision to establish a judicial department independent of the Legislative Branch by
providing that "the judicial Power of the United States shall
be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts
as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish."
Before and during the debates on ratification, Madison, Jefferson, and Hamilton each wrote of the factional disorders
and disarray that the system of legislative equity had
produced in the years before the framing; and each thought
that the separation of the legislative from the judicial power
in the new Constitution would cure them. Madison's Federalist No. 48, the famous description of the process by which
"[t]he legislative department is every where extending the
sphere of its activity, and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex," referred to the report of the Pennsylvania
Council of Censors to show that in that State "cases belonging to the judiciary department [had been] frequently drawn
within legislative cognizance and determination." The Fed514us1$41k 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT

eralist No. 48, pp. 333, 337 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). Madison re-lied as well on Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia,

which mentioned, as one example of the dangerous concen-tration of governmental powers into the hands of the legislature, that "the Legislature . . . in many instances decidedrights which should have been left to judiciary controversy."
Id., at 336 (emphasis deleted).4If the need for separation of legislative from judicial power
was plain, the principal effect to be accomplished by thatseparation was even plainer. As Hamilton wrote in his exegesis of Article III, $ 1, in The Federalist No. 81:

"It is not true . . . that the parliament of Great Britain,or the legislatures of the particular states, can rectify

the exceptionable decisions of their respective courts, inany other sense than might be done by a future legislature of the United States. The theory neither of theBritish, nor the state constitutions, authorises the revisal of a judicial sentence, by a legislative act. . . . Alegislature without exceeding its province cannot reverse a determination once made, in a particular case;though it may prescribe a new rule for future cases."
The Federalist No. 81, p. 545 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).
The essential balance created by this allocation of authoritywas a simple one. The Legislature would be possessed of

power to "prescrib[e] the rules by which the duties andrights of every citizen are to be regulated," but the power
of "[t]he interpretation of the laws" would be "the properand peculiar province of the courts."

Id., No. 78, at 523, 525.

4 Read in the abstract these public pronouncements might be taken, as
the Solicitor General does take them, see Brief for United States 28-30,
to disapprove only the practice of having the legislature itself sit as a court
of original or appellate jurisdiction. But against the backdrop of history,
that reading is untenable. Many, perhaps a plurality, of the instances of
legislative equity in the period before the framing simply involved duly
enacted laws that nullified judgments so that new trials or judicial rulings
on the merits could take place. See supra, at 219.

Opinion of the Court
See also Corwin, The Doctrine of Judicial Review, at 42.The Judiciary would be, "from the nature of its functions, . . .

the [department] least dangerous to the political rights of theconstitution," not because its acts were subject to legislative
correction, but because the binding effect of its acts was limited to particular cases and controversies. Thus, "thoughindividual oppression may now and then proceed from the

courts of justice, the general liberty of the people can neverbe endangered from that quarter: . . . so long as the judiciary
remains truly distinct from both the legislative and execu-tive." The Federalist No. 78, at 522, 523.

Judicial decisions in the period immediately after ratifica-tion of the Constitution confirm the understanding that it
forbade interference with the final judgments of courts. In
Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386 (1798), the Legislature of Connect-icut had enacted a statute that set aside the final judgment

of a state court in a civil case. Although the issue beforethis Court was the construction of the

Ex Post Facto Clause,
Art. I, $ 10, Justice Iredell (a leading Federalist who hadguided the Constitution to ratification in North Carolina)

noted that

"the Legislature of [Connecticut] has been in the uniform, uninterrupted, habit of exercising a general super-intending power over its courts of law, by granting new

trials. It may, indeed, appear strange to some of us,that in any form, there should exist a power to grant,
with respect to suits depending or adjudged, new rights
of trial, new privileges of proceeding, not previously rec-ognized and regulated by positive institutions . . . . The

power . . . is judicial in its nature; and whenever it is
exercised, as in the present instance, it is an exercise of
judicial, not of legislative, authority." Id., at 398.

The state courts of the era showed a similar understanding
of the separation of powers, in decisions that drew little distinction between the federal and state constitutions. To

Opinion of the Court
choose one representative example from a multitude: InBates v. Kimball, 2 Chipman 77 (Vt. 1824), a special Act of

the Vermont Legislature authorized a party to appeal fromthe judgment of a court even though, under the general law,
the time for appeal had expired. The court, noting that theunappealed judgment had become final, set itself the question "Have the Legislature power to vacate or annul an exist-ing judgment between party and party?"

Id., at 83. Theanswer was emphatic: "The necessity of a distinct and separate existence of the three great departments of government. . . had been proclaimed and enforced by . . . Blackstone,
Jefferson and Madison," and had been "sanctioned by thepeople of the United States, by being adopted in terms more
or less explicit, into all their written constitutions." Id., at84. The power to annul a final judgment, the court held
(citing Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall., at 410), was "an assumptionof Judicial power," and therefore forbidden.

Bates v. Kim-ball, supra, at 90. For other examples, see Merrill v. Sherburne, 1 N. H. 199 (1818) (legislature may not vacate a finaljudgment and grant a new trial);

Lewis v. Webb, 3 Greenleaf299 (Me. 1825) (same); T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations

95-96 (1868) (collecting cases); J. Sutherland, Statutory Con-struction 18-19 (J. Lewis ed. 1904) (same).

By the middle of the 19th century, the constitutional equi-librium created by the separation of the legislative power to
make general law from the judicial power to apply that lawin particular cases was so well understood and accepted that
it could survive even Dred Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393(1857). In his First Inaugural Address, President Lincoln
explained why the political branches could not, and need not,interfere with even that infamous judgment:

"I do not forget the position assumed by some, that con-stitutional questions are to be decided by the Supreme
Court; nor do I deny that such decisions must be bindingin any case, upon the parties to a suit, as to the object
of that suit . . . . And while it is obviously possible that

such decision may be erroneous in any given case, stillthe evil effect following it, being limited to that particular case, with the chance that it may be over-ruled, andnever become a precedent for other cases, can better be
borne than could the evils of a different practice." 4R. Basler, The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln 268
(1953) (First Inaugural Address 1861).
And the great constitutional scholar Thomas Cooley ad-dressed precisely the question before us in his 1868 treatise:

"If the legislature cannot thus indirectly control theaction of the courts, by requiring of them a construction
of the law according to its own views, it is very plain itcannot do so directly, by setting aside their judgments,
compelling them to grant new trials, ordering the dis-charge of offenders, or directing what particular steps
shall be taken in the progress of a judicial inquiry."Cooley, supra, at 94-95.

Section 27A(b) effects a clear violation of the separation-of-powers principle we have just discussed. It is, of course,

retroactive legislation, that is, legislation that prescribeswhat the law

was at an earlier time, when the act whoseeffect is controlled by the legislation occurred--in this case,

the filing of the initial Rule 10b-5 action in the DistrictCourt. When retroactive legislation requires its own application in a case already finally adjudicated, it does no moreand no less than "reverse a determination once made, in a
particular case." The Federalist No. 81, at 545. Our deci-sions stemming from

Hayburn's Case--although their pre-cise holdings are not strictly applicable here, see supra, at

218--have uniformly provided fair warning that such an actexceeds the powers of Congress. See, e. g., Chicago &
Southern Air Lines, Inc., 333 U. S., at 113 ("Judgmentswithin the powers vested in courts by the Judiciary Article

Gordon v. United States, 117
U. S. Appx. 697, 700-704 (1864) (opinion of Taney, C. J.)( judgments of Article III courts are "final and conclusive

upon the rights of the parties"); Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall.,at 411 (opinion of Wilson and Blair, JJ., and Peters, D. J.)
("[R]evision and control" of Article III judgments is "radically inconsistent with the independence of that judicial
power which is vested in the courts"); id., at 413 (opinion of
Iredell, J., and Sitgreaves, D. J.) ("[N]o decision of any court
of the United States can, under any circumstances, . . . be
liable to a revision, or even suspension, by the [l]egislature
itself, in whom no judicial power of any kind appears to be
vested"). See also Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont
Bridge Co., 18 How. 421, 431 (1856) ("[I]t is urged, that the
act of congress cannot have the effect and operation to annul
the judgment of the court already rendered, or the rights
determined thereby . . . . This, as a general proposition, is
certainly not to be denied, especially as it respects adjudication upon the private rights of parties. When they have
passed into judgment the right becomes absolute, and it is
the duty of the court to enforce it"). Today those clear
statements must either be honored, or else proved false.

It is true, as petitioners contend, that Congress can always
revise the judgments of Article III courts in one sense:
When a new law makes clear that it is retroactive, an appellate court must apply that law in reviewing judgments still
on appeal that were rendered before the law was enacted,
and must alter the outcome accordingly. See United States
v. Schooner Peggy, 1 Cranch 103 (1801); Landgraf v. USI
Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 273-280 (1994). Since that is

227Cite as: 514 U. S. 211 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
so, petitioners argue, federal courts must apply the "new"law created by $ 27A(b) in finally adjudicated cases as well;

for the line that separates lower court judgments that arepending on appeal (or may still be appealed), from lower
court judgments that are final, is determined by statute, see,
e. g., 28 U. S. C. $ 2107(a) (30-day time limit for appeal to fed-eral court of appeals), and so cannot possibly be a

constitutional line. But a distinction between judgments fromwhich all appeals have been forgone or completed, and judgments that remain on appeal (or subject to being appealed),is implicit in what Article III creates: not a batch of unconnected courts, but a judicial department composed of "inferior Courts" and "one supreme Court." Within that hierarchy, the decision of an inferior court is not (unless the time
for appeal has expired) the final word of the department as
a whole. It is the obligation of the last court in the hierarchy that rules on the case to give effect to Congress's latest
enactment, even when that has the effect of overturning the
judgment of an inferior court, since each court, at every
level, must "decide according to existing laws." Schooner
Peggy, supra, at 109. Having achieved finality, however, a
judicial decision becomes the last word of the judicial department with regard to a particular case or controversy, and
Congress may not declare by retroactive legislation that the
law applicable to that very case was something other than
what the courts said it was. Finality of a legal judgment is
determined by statute, just as entitlement to a government
benefit is a statutory creation; but that no more deprives the
former of its constitutional significance for separation-ofpowers analysis than it deprives the latter of its significance
for due process purposes. See, e. g., Cleveland Bd. of Ed. v.
Loudermill, 470 U. S. 532 (1985); Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S.
215 (1976).

To be sure, $ 27A(b) reopens (or directs the reopening of)
final judgments in a whole class of cases rather than in a
particular suit. We do not see how that makes any differ514us1$41k 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ence. The separation-of-powers violation here, if there isany, consists of depriving judicial judgments of the conclusive effect that they had when they were announced, not ofacting in a manner--viz., with particular rather than general
effect--that is unusual (though, we must note, not impossible) for a legislature. To be sure, a general statute such asthis one may reduce the perception that legislative interference with judicial judgments was prompted by individual fa-voritism; but it is legislative interference with judicial judgments nonetheless. Not favoritism, nor even corruption,but

power is the object of the separation-of-powers prohibition. The prohibition is violated when an individual final
judgment is legislatively rescinded for even the very best of
reasons, such as the legislature's genuine conviction (supported by all the law professors in the land) that the judgment was wrong; and it is violated 40 times over when 40
final judgments are legislatively dissolved.

It is irrelevant as well that the final judgments reopened
by $ 27A(b) rested on the bar of a statute of limitations. The
rules of finality, both statutory and judge made, treat a dismissal on statute-of-limitations grounds the same way they
treat a dismissal for failure to state a claim, for failure to
prove substantive liability, or for failure to prosecute: as a
judgment on the merits. See, e. g., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.
41(b); United States v. Oppenheimer, 242 U. S. 85, 87-88
(1916). Petitioners suggest, directly or by implication, two
reasons why a merits judgment based on this particular
ground may be uniquely subject to congressional nullification. First, there is the fact that the length and indeed even
the very existence of a statute of limitations upon a federal
cause of action is entirely subject to congressional control.
But virtually all of the reasons why a final judgment on the
merits is rendered on a federal claim are subject to congressional control. Congress can eliminate, for example, a particular element of a cause of action that plaintiffs have found
it difficult to establish; or an evidentiary rule that has often

229Cite as: 514 U. S. 211 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
excluded essential testimony; or a rule of offsetting wrong(such as contributory negligence) that has often prevented

recovery. To distinguish statutes of limitations on theground that they are mere creatures of Congress is to distinguish them not at all. The second supposedly distinguishing
characteristic of a statute of limitations is that it can be ex-tended, without violating the Due Process Clause, after the

cause of the action arose and even after the statute itself hasexpired. See,

e. g., Chase Securities Corp. v. Donaldson,
325 U. S. 304 (1945). But that also does not set statutes oflimitations apart. To mention only one other broad category of judgment-producing legal rule: Rules of pleading and
proof can similarly be altered after the cause of action arises,
Landgraf v. USI Film Products, supra, at 275, and n. 29,
and even, if the statute clearly so requires, after they have
been applied in a case but before final judgment has been
entered. Petitioners' principle would therefore lead to the
conclusion that final judgments rendered on the basis of a
stringent (or, alternatively, liberal) rule of pleading or proof
may be set aside for retrial under a new liberal (or, alternatively, stringent) rule of pleading or proof. This alone provides massive scope for undoing final judgments and would
substantially subvert the doctrine of separation of powers.

The central theme of the dissent is a variant on these arguments. The dissent maintains that Lampf "announced" a
new statute of limitations, post, at 246, in an act of "judicial
. . . lawmaking," post, at 247, that "changed the law," post, at
250. That statement, even if relevant, would be wrong.
The point decided in Lampf had never before been addressed

by this Court, and was therefore an open question, no matter
what the lower courts had held at the time. But the more
important point is that Lampf as such is irrelevant to this
case. The dissent itself perceives that "[w]e would have the
same issue to decide had Congress enacted the Lampf rule,"
and that the Lampf rule's genesis in judicial lawmaking
rather than, shall we say, legislative lawmaking, "should not

affect the separation-of-powers analysis." Post, at 247.Just so. The issue here is not the validity or even the source

of the legal rule that produced the Article III judgments,but rather the immunity from legislative abrogation of those
judgments themselves. The separation-of-powers questionbefore us has nothing to do with

Lampf, and the dissent'sattack on Lampf has nothing to do with the question before

us. C

Apart from the statute we review today, we know of noinstance in which Congress has attempted to set aside the
final judgment of an Article III court by retroactive legis-lation. That prolonged reticence would be amazing if such
interference were not understood to be constitutionally pro-scribed. The closest analogue that the Government has
been able to put forward is the statute at issue in United
States v. Sioux Nation, 448 U. S. 371 (1980). That law re-quired the Court of Claims, " `[n]otwithstanding any other

provision of law . . . [to] review on the merits, without re-gard to the defense of res judicata or collateral estoppel,' " a
Sioux claim for just compensation from the United States--even though the Court of Claims had previously heard and
rejected that very claim. We considered and rejectedseparation-of-powers objections to the statute based upon
Hayburn's Case and United States v. Klein. See 448 U. S.,at 391-392. The basis for our rejection was a line of precedent (starting with Cherokee Nation v. United States, 270
U. S. 476 (1926)) that stood, we said, for the proposition that"Congress has the power to waive the res judicata effect of

a prior judgment entered in the Government's favor on a
claim against the United States." Sioux Nation, 448 U. S.,at 397. And our holding was as narrow as the precedent on

which we had relied: "In sum, . . . Congress' mere waiver ofthe res judicata effect of a prior judicial decision rejecting
the validity of a legal claim against the United States does

The Solicitor General suggests that even if Sioux Nationis read in accord with its holding, it nonetheless establishes

that Congress may require Article III courts to reopen theirfinal judgments, since "if res judicata were compelled by Article III to safeguard the structural independence of the
courts, the doctrine would not be subject to waiver by anyparty litigant." Brief for United States 27 (citing

Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833, 850-851(1986)). But the proposition that legal defenses based upon

doctrines central to the courts' structural independencecan never be waived simply does not accord with our cases.
Certainly one such doctrine consists of the "judicial Power"
to disregard an unconstitutional statute, see Marbury, 1Cranch, at 177; yet none would suggest that a litigant may

never waive the defense that a statute is unconstitutional.See,

e. g., G. D. Searle & Co. v. Cohn, 455 U. S. 404, 414 (1982).
What may follow from our holding that the judicial powerunalterably includes the power to render final judgments is

not that waivers of res judicata are always impermissible,but rather that, as many Federal Courts of Appeals have
held, waivers of res judicata need not always be accepted--
that trial courts may in appropriate cases raise the res judi-cata bar on their own motion. See,

e. g., Coleman v. Ramada Hotel Operating Co., 933 F. 2d 470, 475 (CA7 1991); In
re Medomak Canning, 922 F. 2d 895, 904 (CA1 1990); Holloway Constr. Co. v. United States Dept. of Labor, 891 F. 2d

" `only was providing a forum so that a new judicial review of the Black
Hills claim could take place.' " Post, at 256 (quoting 448 U. S., at 407).
That is quite consistent with the res judicata holding. Any party who
waives the defense of res judicata provides a forum for a new judicial
review.

Opinion of the Court
courts themselves would obviously raise no issue of separation of powers, and would be precisely in accord with the
language of the decision that the Solicitor General relies
upon. We held in Schor that, although a litigant had consented to bring a state-law counterclaim before an Article I
tribunal, 478 U. S., at 849, we would nonetheless choose to
consider his Article III challenge, because "when these Article III limitations are at issue, notions of consent and waiver
cannot be dispositive," id., at 851 (emphasis added). See
also Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 878-879 (1991)
(finding a "rare cas[e] in which we should exercise our discretion" to hear a waived claim based on the Appointments
Clause, Art. II, $ 2, cl. 2).6

Petitioners also rely on a miscellany of decisions upholding
legislation that altered rights fixed by the final judgments of
non-Article III courts, see, e. g., Sampeyreac v. United
States, 7 Pet. 222, 238 (1833); Freeborn v. Smith, 2 Wall. 160
(1865), or administrative agencies, Paramino Lumber Co. v.
Marshall, 309 U. S. 370 (1940), or that altered the prospective effect of injunctions entered by Article III courts,
Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co., 18 How., at 421. These
cases distinguish themselves; nothing in our holding today
calls them into question. Petitioners rely on general statements from some of these cases that legislative annulment of
final judgments is not an exercise of judicial power. But
even if it were our practice to decide cases by weight of prior
dicta, we would find the many dicta that reject congressional

6 The statute at issue in United States v. Sioux Nation, 448 U. S. 371
(1980), seemingly prohibited courts from raising the res judicata defense
sua sponte. See id., at 432-433 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). The Court
did not address that point; as far as appears it saw no reason to raise the
defense on its own. Of course the unexplained silences of our decisions
lack precedential weight. See, e. g., Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619,
630-631 (1993).

power to revise the judgments of Article III courts to be the
more instructive authority. See supra, at 225-226.7

Finally, petitioners liken $ 27A(b) to Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 60(b), which authorizes courts to relieve parties
from a final judgment for grounds such as excusable neglect,
newly discovered evidence, fraud, or "any other reason justifying relief . . . ." We see little resemblance. Rule 60(b),
which authorizes discretionary judicial revision of judgments
in the listed situations and in other " `extraordinary circumstances,' " Liljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition Corp.,
486 U. S. 847, 864 (1988), does not impose any legislative
mandate to reopen upon the courts, but merely reflects and

7 The dissent tries to turn the dicta of the territorial-court cases, Sampeyreac and Freeborn, into holdings. It says of Sampeyreac that "the
relevant judicial power that the [challenged] statute arguably supplanted
was this Court's Article III appellate jurisdiction." Post, at 253. Even
if it were true that the judicial power under discussion was that of this
Court (which is doubtful), the point could still not possibly constitute a
holding, since there was no "supplanted power" at issue in the case. One
of the principal grounds of decision was that the finality of the territorial
court's decree had not been retroactively abrogated. The decree had
been entered under a previous statute which provided that a decree "shall
be final and conclusive between the parties." Sampeyreac v. United
States, 7 Pet., at 239 (emphasis in original). The asserted basis for reopening was fraud, in that Sampeyreac did not actually exist. We reasoned that "as Sampeyreac was a fictitious person, he was no party to the
decree, and the act [under which the decree had allegedly become final] in
strictness does not apply to the case." Ibid.

The dissent likewise says of Freeborn that "the `judicial power' to which
the opinion referred was this Court's Article III appellate jurisdiction."
Post, at 255. Once again, even if it was, the point remains dictum. No
final judgment was at issue in Freeborn. The challenged statute reached
only " `cases of appeal or writ of error heretofore prosecuted and now
pending in the supreme court of the United States,' " see post, at 254, n. 7
(quoting 13 Stat. 441) (emphasis added). As we have explained, see
supra, at 226, Congress may require (insofar as separation-of-powers limitations are concerned) that new statutes be applied in cases not yet final
but still pending on appeal.

234 PLAUT v. SPENDTHRIFT FARM, INC.

Opinion of the Court
confirms the courts' own inherent and discretionary power,"firmly established in English practice long before the foundation of our Republic," to set aside a judgment whose en-forcement would work inequity.

Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v.
Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U. S. 238, 244 (1944). Thus, Rule
60(b), and the tradition that it embodies, would be relevantrefutation of a claim that reopening a final judgment is always a denial of property without due process; but they areirrelevant to the claim that legislative instruction to reopen
impinges upon the independent constitutional authority ofthe courts.

The dissent promises to provide "[a] few contemporary examples" of statutes retroactively requiring final judgments
to be reopened, "to demonstrate that [such statutes] are ordinary products of the exercise of legislative power." Post, at
256. That promise is not kept. The relevant retroactivity,
of course, consists not of the requirement that there be set
aside a judgment that has been rendered prior to its being
setting aside--for example, a statute passed today which
says that all default judgments rendered in the future may
be reopened within 90 days after their entry. In that sense,
all requirements to reopen are "retroactive," and the designation is superfluous. Nothing we say today precludes a law
such as that. The finality that a court can pronounce is no
more than what the law in existence at the time of judgment
will permit it to pronounce. If the law then applicable says
that the judgment may be reopened for certain reasons, that
limitation is built into the judgment itself, and its finality is
so conditioned. The present case, however, involves a judgment that Congress subjected to a reopening requirement
which did not exist when the judgment was pronounced.
The dissent provides not a single clear prior instance of such
congressional action.

The dissent cites, first, Rule 60(b), which it describes as a
"familiar remedial measure." Ibid. As we have just discussed, Rule 60(b) does not provide a new remedy at all, but

is simply the recitation of pre-existing judicial power. Thesame is true of another of the dissent's examples, 28 U. S. C.

$ 2255, which provides federal prisoners a statutory motionto vacate a federal sentence. This procedure " `restates,
clarifies and simplifies the procedure in the nature of the
ancient writ of error coram nobis.' " United States v. Hayman, 342 U. S. 205, 218 (1952) (quoting the 1948 Reviser's
Note to $ 2255). It is meaningless to speak of these statutesas applying "retroactively," since they simply codified judicial practice that pre-existed. Next, the dissent cites theprovision of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940,
54 Stat. 1178, 50 U. S. C. App. $ 520(4), which authorizes
courts, upon application, to reopen judgments against members of the Armed Forces entered while they were on active
duty. It could not be clearer, however, that this provision
was not retroactive. It says: "If any judgment shall be rendered in any action or proceeding governed by this section
against any person in military service during the period of
such service . . . such judgment may . . . be opened . . . ."
(Emphasis added.)

The dissent also cites, post, at 258, a provision of the Handicapped Children's Protection Act of 1986, 82 Stat. 901, 20
U. S. C. $ 1415(e)(4)(B) (1988 ed. and Supp. V), which provided for the award of attorney's fees under the Education
for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, 89 Stat. 773, 20
U. S. C. $ 1411 et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. V). This changed
the law regarding attorney's fees under the Education for
All Handicapped Children Act, after our decision in Smith v.
Robinson, 468 U. S. 992 (1984), found such fees to be unavailable. The provision of the Statutes at Large adopting this
amendment to the United States Code specified, in effect,
that it would apply not only to proceedings brought after its
enactment, but also to proceedings pending at the time of,
or brought after, the decision in Smith. See 100 Stat. 798.
The amendment says nothing about reopening final judgments, and the retroactivity provision may well mean noth514us1$41k 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ing more than that it applies not merely to new suits commenced after the date of its enactment, but also to
previously filed (but not yet terminated) suits of the specified sort. This interpretation would be consistent with the
only case the dissent cites, which involved a court-entered
consent decree not yet fully executed. Counsel v. Dow, 849
F. 2d 731, 734, 738-739 (CA2 1988). Alternatively, the
statute can perhaps be understood to create a new cause of
action for attorney's fees attributable to already concluded
litigation. That would create no separation-of-powers problem, and would be consistent with this Court's view that
"[a]ttorney's fee determinations . . . are `collateral to the main
cause of action' and `uniquely separable from the cause of
action to be proved at trial.' " Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S., at 277 (quoting White v. New Hampshire
Dept. of Employment Security, 455 U. S. 445, 451-452
(1982)).8

The dissent's perception that retroactive reopening provisions are to be found all about us is perhaps attributable to
its inversion of the statutory presumption regarding retroactivity. Thus, it asserts that Rule 60(b) must be retroactive,
since "[n]ot a single word in its text suggests that it does not
apply to judgments entered prior to its effective date."

8 Even the dissent's scouring the 50 States for support has proved unproductive. It cites statutes from five States, post, at 258-259, nn. 12-13.
Four of those statutes involve a virtually identical provision, which permits the state-chartered entity that takes over an insolvent insurance company to apply to have any of the insurer's default judgments set aside.
See Del. Code Ann., Tit. 18, $ 4418 (1989); Fla. Stat. $ 631.734 (1984); N. Y.
Ins. Law $ 7717 (McKinney Supp. 1995); 40 Pa. Cons. Stat. $ 991.1716
(Supp. 1994). It is not at all clear, indeed it seems to us unlikely, that
these statutes applied retroactively, to judgments that were final before
enactment of the scheme that created the state-chartered entity. The last
statute involves a discretionary procedure for allowing appeal by pro se
litigants, Va. Code Ann. $ 8.01-428(C) (Supp. 1994). It is obvious that the
provision did not apply retroactively, to judgments rendered before the
procedures were established.

Opinion of the Court
Post, at 256-257. This reverses the traditional rule, con-firmed only last Term, that statutes do

not apply retroactively unless Congress expressly states that they do. See
Landgraf, supra, at 277-280. The dissent adds that "the
traditional construction of remedial measures . . . support[s]
construing [Rule 60(b)] to apply to past as well as futurejudgments."

Post, at 257. But reliance on the vaguely remedial purpose of a statute to defeat the presumptionagainst retroactivity was rejected in the companion cases of

Landgraf, see 511 U. S., at 284-286, and n. 37, and Rivers v.
Roadway Express, 511 U. S., at 309-313. Cf. Landgraf,
supra, at 297 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) ("This presumption
[against retroactive legislation] need not be applied to remedial legislation . . .") (citing Sampeyreac, 7 Pet., at 238).

The dissent sets forth a number of hypothetical horribles
flowing from our assertedly "rigid holding"--for example,
the inability to set aside a civil judgment that has become
final during a period when a natural disaster prevented the
timely filing of a certiorari petition. Post, at 262. That is
horrible not because of our holding, but because the underlying statute itself enacts a "rigid" jurisdictional bar to entertaining untimely civil petitions. Congress could undoubtedly enact prospective legislation permitting, or indeed
requiring, this Court to make equitable exceptions to an otherwise applicable rule of finality, just as district courts do
pursuant to Rule 60(b). It is no indication whatever of the
invalidity of the constitutional rule which we announce, that
it produces unhappy consequences when a legislature lacks
foresight, and acts belatedly to remedy a deficiency in the
law. That is a routine result of constitutional rules. See,
e. g., Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37 (1990) (Ex Post
Facto Clause precludes postoffense statutory extension of a
criminal sentence); United States Trust Co. of N. Y. v. New
Jersey, 431 U. S. 1 (1977) (Contract Clause prevents retroactive alteration of contract with state bondholders); Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, 295 U. S. 555, 589-

United States v. Security Industrial Bank, 459 U. S. 70, 78(1982).

Finally, we may respond to the suggestion of the concurrence that this case should be decided more narrowly. Theconcurrence is willing to acknowledge only that "

sometimes
Congress lacks the power under Article I to reopen an other-wise closed court judgment,"

post, at 240-241. In the present context, what it considers critical is that $ 27A(b) is"exclusively retroactive" and "appli[es] to a limited number

of individuals." Post, at 241. If Congress had only "pro-vid[ed] some of the assurances against `singling out' that
ordinary legislative activity normally provides--say, prospectivity and general applicability--we might have a dif-ferent case."

Post, at 243.
This seems to us wrong in both fact and law. In pointof fact, $ 27A(b) does not "single out" any defendant for adverse treatment (or any plaintiff for favorable treatment).Rather, it identifies a class of actions (those filed preLampf,
timely under applicable state law, but dismissed as timebarred postLampf ) which embraces many plaintiffs and defendants, the precise number and identities of whom we even
now do not know. The concurrence's contention that the
number of covered defendants "is too small (compared with
the number of similar, uncovered firms) to distinguish
meaningfully the law before us from a similar law aimed at
a single closed case," post, at 244 (emphasis added), renders
the concept of "singling out" meaningless.

More importantly, however, the concurrence's point seems
to us wrong in law. To be sure, the class of actions identified
by $ 27A(b) could have been more expansive (e. g., all actions
that were or could have been filed pre-Lampf ) and the provision could have been written to have prospective as well as
retroactive effect (e. g., "all post-Lampf dismissed actions,
plus all future actions under Rule 10b-5, shall be timely if
brought within 30 years of the injury"). But it escapes us

Opinion of the Court
how this could in any way cause the statute to be any lessan infringement upon the judicial power. The nub of that

infringement consists not of the Legislature's acting in a par-ticularized and hence (according to the concurrence) nonlegislative fashion; 9 but rather of the Legislature's nullifyingprior, authoritative judicial action. It makes no difference
whatever to that separation-of-powers violation that it is in
gross rather than particularized (e. g., "we hereby set aside
all hitherto entered judicial orders"), or that it is not accompanied by an "almost" violation of the Bill of AttainderClause, or an "almost" violation of any other constitutional

provision.Ultimately, the concurrence agrees with our judgment
only "[b]ecause the law before us embodies risks of the verysort that our Constitution's `separation of powers' prohibition
seeks to avoid." Post, at 246. But the doctrine of separation of powers is a structural safeguard rather than a rem-edy to be applied only when specific harm, or risk of specific

harm, can be identified. In its major features (of which theconclusiveness of judicial judgments is assuredly one) it is a
prophylactic device, establishing high walls and clear distinc-tions because low walls and vague distinctions will not be
judicially defensible in the heat of interbranch conflict. It is
interesting that the concurrence quotes twice, and cites with-out quotation a third time, the opinion of Justice Powell in

9 The premise that there is something wrong with particularized legislative action is of course questionable. While legislatures usually act
through laws of general applicability, that is by no means their only legitimate mode of action. Private bills in Congress are still common, and
were even more so in the days before establishment of the Claims Court.
Even laws that impose a duty or liability upon a single individual or firm
are not on that account invalid--or else we would not have the extensive
jurisprudence that we do concerning the Bill of Attainder Clause, including cases which say that it requires not merely "singling out" but also
punishment, see, e. g., United States v. Lovett, 328 U. S. 303, 315-318
(1946), and a case which says that Congress may legislate "a legitimate
class of one," Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425,

Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S., at 959. But Justice Powell wroteonly for himself in that case. He alone expressed dismay

that "[t]he Court's decision . . . apparently will invalidateevery use of the legislative veto," and opined that "[t]he
breadth of this holding gives one pause." Ibid. It did notgive pause to the six-Justice majority, which put an end to
the long-simmering interbranch dispute that would other-wise have been indefinitely prolonged. We think legislated
invalidation of judicial judgments deserves the same categor-ical treatment accorded by

Chadha to congressional invalida-tion of executive action. The delphic alternative suggested

by the concurrence (the setting aside of judgments is allright so long as Congress does not "impermissibly tr[y] to
apply, as well as make, the law," post, at 241) simply pro-longs doubt and multiplies confrontation. Separation of
powers, a distinctively American political doctrine, profitsfrom the advice authored by a distinctively American poet:
Good fences make good neighbors.

* * *
We know of no previous instance in which Congress hasenacted retroactive legislation requiring an Article III court

to set aside a final judgment, and for good reason. The Con-stitution's separation of legislative and judicial powers denies
it the authority to do so. Section 27A(b) is unconstitutionalto the extent that it requires federal courts to reopen final
judgments entered before its enactment. The judgment ofthe Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Breyer, concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the majority that $ 27A(b) of the SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934, 15 U. S. C. $ 78aa-1 (1988 ed., Supp.

V) (hereinafter $ 27A(b)) is unconstitutional. In my view,the separation of powers inherent in our Constitution means
that at least sometimes Congress lacks the power under Ar514us1$41q 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT

241Cite as: 514 U. S. 211 (1995)
Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
ticle I to reopen an otherwise closed court judgment. Andthe statutory provision here at issue, $ 27A(b), violates a

basic "separation-of-powers" principle--one intended to pro-tect individual liberty. Three features of this law--its exclusively retroactive effect, its application to a limited number of individuals, and its reopening of closed judgments--taken together, show that Congress here impermissibly tried

to apply, as well as make, the law. Hence, $ 27A(b) fallsoutside the scope of Article I. But, it is far less clear, and
unnecessary for the purposes of this case to decide, that sep-aration of powers "is violated"

whenever an "individual final
judgment is legislatively rescinded" or that it is "violated 40
times over when 40 final judgments are legislatively dissolved." See ante, at 228. I therefore write separately.

The majority provides strong historical evidence that Congress lacks the power simply to reopen, and to revise, final
judgments in individual cases. See ante, at 219-222. The
Framers would have hesitated to lodge in the Legislature
both that kind of power and the power to enact general laws,
as part of their effort to avoid the "despotic government"
that accompanies the "accumulation of all powers, legislative,
executive, and judiciary, in the same hands." The Federalist
No. 47, p. 241 (J. Gideon ed. 1831) (J. Madison); id., No. 48, at
249 (quoting T. Jefferson, Notes on the State of Virginia).
For one thing, the authoritative application of a general law
to a particular case by an independent judge, rather than by
the legislature itself, provides an assurance that even an unfair law at least will be applied evenhandedly according to
its terms. See, e. g., 1 Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws 174
(T. Nugent transl. 1886) (describing one objective of the "separation of powers" as preventing "the same monarch or senate," having "enact[ed] tyrannical laws" from "execut[ing]
them in a tyrannical manner"); W. Gwyn, The Meaning of
the Separation of Powers 42-43, 104-106 (1965) (discussing
historically relevant sources that explain one purpose of separation of powers as helping to assure an "impartial rule of

Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
law"). For another thing, as Justice Powell has pointed out,the Constitution's "separation-of-powers" principles reflect,

in part, the Framers' "concern that a legislature should notbe able unilaterally to impose a substantial deprivation on
one person." INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 962 (1983) (opinion concurring in judgment). The Framers "expressed" thisprinciple, both in "specific provisions, such as the Bill of Attainder Clause," and in the Constitution's "general allocationof power."

Ibid.; see United States v. Brown, 381 U. S.
437, 442 (1965) (Bill of Attainder Clause intended to imple-ment the separation of powers, acting as "a general safeguard against legislative exercise of the judicial function");
Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 136 (1810) (Marshall, C. J.) ("It
is the peculiar province of the legislature to prescribe general rules for the government of society; the application of
those rules to individuals in society would seem to be the
duty of other departments"); cf. Hurtado v. California, 110
U. S. 516, 535-536 (1884).

Despite these two important "separation-of-powers" concerns, sometimes Congress can enact legislation that focuses
upon a small group, or even a single individual. See, e. g.,
Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425,
468-484 (1977); Selective Service System v. Minnesota Public Interest Research Group, 468 U. S. 841, 846-856 (1984);
Brown, supra, at 453-456. Congress also sometimes passes
private legislation. See Chadha, supra, at 966, n. 9 (Powell,
J., concurring in judgment) ("When Congress grants particular individuals relief or benefits under its spending power,
the danger of oppressive action that the separation of powers
was designed to avoid is not implicated"). And, sometimes
Congress can enact legislation that, as a practical matter,
radically changes the effect of an individual, previously entered court decree. See Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co., 18 How. 421 (1856). Statutes that apply
prospectively and (in part because of that prospectivity) to
an open-ended class of persons, however, are more than sim514us1$41q 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT

243Cite as: 514 U. S. 211 (1995)
Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
ply an effort to apply, person by person, a previously enactedlaw, or to single out for oppressive treatment one, or a handful, of particular individuals. Thus, it seems to me, if Con-gress enacted legislation that reopened an otherwise closed
judgment but in a way that mitigated some of the here relevant "separation-of-powers" concerns, by also providingsome of the assurances against "singling out" that ordinary

legislative activity normally provides--say, prospectivityand general applicability--we might have a different case.
Cf. Brown, supra, at 461 ("Congress must accomplish [itsdesired] results by rules of general applicability. It cannot
specify the people upon whom the sanction it prescribes is
to be levied"). Because such legislation, in light of those
mitigating circumstances, might well present a different constitutional question, I do not subscribe to the Court's more
absolute statement.

The statute before us, however, has no such mitigating features. It reopens previously closed judgments. It is entirely retroactive, applying only to those Rule 10b-5 actions
actually filed, on or before (but on which final judgments
were entered after) June 19, 1991. See 15 U. S. C. $ 78j(b)
and 17 CFR 240.10b-5 (1994). It lacks generality, for it applies only to a few individual instances. See Hearings on
H. R. 3185 before the Subcommittee on Telecommunications
and Finance of the House of Representatives Committee on

(listing, by case name, only 15 cases that had been dismissed
on the basis of Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow
v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350 (1991)). And, it is underinclusive, for it excludes from its coverage others who, relying
upon pre-Lampf limitations law, may have failed to bring
timely securities fraud actions against any other of the Nation's hundreds of thousands of businesses. I concede that
its coverage extends beyond a single individual to many potential plaintiffs in these class actions. But because the legislation disfavors not plaintiffs but defendants, I should think

Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
that the latter number is the more relevant. And, that num-ber is too small (compared with the number of similar, uncovered firms) to distinguish meaningfully the law before usfrom a similar law aimed at a single closed case. Nor does
the existence of $ 27A(a), which applies to Rule 10b-5 actions
pending at the time of the legislation, change this conclusion.That provision seems aimed at too few additional individuals

to mitigate the low level of generality of $ 27A(b). SeeHearings on H. R. 3185,

supra, at 5-6 (listing 17 cases in
which dismissal motions based on Lampf were pending).The upshot is that, viewed in light of the relevant, libertyprotecting objectives of the "separation of powers," this case
falls directly within the scope of language in this Court's
cases suggesting a restriction on Congress' power to reopen
closed court judgments. See, e. g., Chicago & Southern Air
Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 113 (1948)
("Judgments within the powers vested in courts by the Judiciary Article of the Constitution may not lawfully be revised
[or] overturned . . . by another Department of Government");
Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co., supra, at 431 ("[I]f the remedy in this case had been an action at law, and a judgment
rendered in favor of the plaintiff for damages, the right to
these would have passed beyond the reach of the power of
congress"); Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409, 413 (1792) (letter
from Justice Iredell and District Judge Sitgreaves to President Washington) ("[N]o decision of any court of the United
States can, under any circumstances, in our opinion, agreeable to the Constitution, be liable to a revision, or even suspension, by the Legislature itself ").

At the same time, because the law before us both reopens
final judgments and lacks the liberty-protecting assurances
that prospectivity and greater generality would have provided, we need not, and we should not, go further--to make
of the reopening itself, an absolute, always determinative
distinction, a "prophylactic device," or a foundation for the
building of a new "high wal[l]" between the branches.

Ante, at 239. Indeed, the unnecessary building of such wallsis, in itself, dangerous, because the Constitution blends, as

well as separates, powers in its effort to create a governmentthat will work for, as well as protect the liberties of, its citizens. See The Federalist No. 48 (J. Madison). That doctrine does not "divide the branches into watertight compart-ments," nor "establish and divide fields of black and white."

Youngstown Sheet & Tube
Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 635 (1952) (Jackson, J., concur-ring) (referring to the need for "workable government");

id.,
at 596-597 (Frankfurter, J., concurring); Mistretta v. United
States, 488 U. S. 361, 381 (1989) (the doctrine does not create
a "hermetic division among the Branches" but "a carefully
crafted system of checked and balanced power within each
Branch"). And, important separation-of-powers decisions of
this Court have sometimes turned, not upon absolute distinctions, but upon degree. See, e. g., Crowell v. Benson, 285
U. S. 22, 48-54 (1932); A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v.
United States, 295 U. S. 495, 551-555 (1935) (Cardozo, J., concurring). As the majority invokes the advice of an American poet, one might consider as well that poet's caution, for
he not only notes that "Something there is that doesn't love
a wall," but also writes, "Before I built a wall I'd ask to
know/ What I was walling in or walling out." R. Frost,
Mending Wall, The New Oxford Book of American Verse
395-396 (R. Ellmann ed. 1976).

Finally, I note that the cases the dissent cites are distinguishable from the one before us. Sampeyreac v. United
States, 7 Pet. 222 (1833), considered a law similar to $ 27A(b)
(it reopened a set of closed judgments in fraud cases), but
the Court did not reach the here relevant issue. Rather, the
Court rested its conclusion upon the fact that Sampeyreac
was not "a real person," while conceding that, were he real,
the case "might present a different question." Id., at 238-
239. Freeborn v. Smith, 2 Wall. 160 (1865), which involved

Stevens, J., dissenting
an Article I court, upheld a law that applied to all cases pend-ing on appeal (in the Supreme Court) from the territory of

Nevada, irrespective of the causes of action at issue or whichparty was seeking review. See

id., at 162. That law had
generality, a characteristic that helps to avoid the problem
of legislatively singling out a few individuals for adversetreatment. See

Chadha, 462 U. S., at 966 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment). Neither did United States v. Sioux Nation, 448 U. S. 371 (1980), involve legislation that adversely
treated a few individuals. Rather, it permitted the reopen-ing of a case against the United States. See

id., at 391.
Because the law before us embodies risks of the very sortthat our Constitution's "separation-of-powers" prohibition

seeks to avoid, and because I can find no offsetting legislative
safeguards that normally offer assurances that minimize
those risks, I agree with the Court's conclusion and I join
its judgment.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,
dissenting.

On December 19, 1991, Congress enacted $ 27A of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U. S. C. $ 78aa-1 (1988
ed., Supp. V) (hereinafter 1991 amendment), to remedy a
flaw in the limitations rule this Court announced on June
20, 1991, in Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v.
Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350 (1991). In Lampf the Court replaced the array of state statutes of limitations that had governed shareholder actions under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, 15 U. S. C. $ 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5, 17 CFR
240.10b-5 (1994) (hereinafter 10b-5 actions), with a uniform
federal limitations rule. Congress found only one flaw in
the Court's new rule: its failure to exempt pending cases
from its operation. Accordingly, without altering the prospective effect of the Lampf rule, the 1991 amendment remedied its flaw by providing that pre-Lampf law should determine the limitations period applicable to all cases that had

been pending on June 20, 1991--both those that remainedpending on December 19, 1991, when $ 27A was enacted, and

those that courts dismissed between June 20 and December19, 1991. Today the Court holds that the 1991 amendment
violates the Constitution's separation of powers because, byencompassing the dismissed claims, it requires courts to reopen final judgments in private civil actions.Section 27A is a statutory amendment to a rule of law
announced by this Court. The fact that the new rule an-nounced in

Lampf was a product of judicial, rather than con-gressional, lawmaking should not affect the separation-ofpowers analysis. We would have the same issue to decidehad Congress enacted the

Lampf rule but, as a result of inad-vertence or perhaps a scrivener's error, failed to exempt

pending cases, as is customary when limitations periods areshortened.

1 In my opinion, if Congress had retroactively restored rights its own legislation had inadvertently or un-fairly impaired, the remedial amendment's failure to exclude

dismissed cases from the benefited class would not make itinvalid. The Court today faces a materially identical situation and, in my view, reaches the wrong result.Throughout our history, Congress has passed laws that
allow courts to reopen final judgments. Such laws charac-teristically apply to judgments entered before as well as
after their enactment. When they apply retroactively, theymay raise serious due process questions,

2 but the Court

1 Our decisions prior to Lampf consistently held that retroactive application of new, shortened limitations periods would violate "fundamental
notions of justified reliance and due process." Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind,
Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350, 371 (1991) (O'Connor, J.,
dissenting); see, e. g., Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97 (1971); Saint
Francis College v. Al-Khazraji, 481 U. S. 604 (1987).

2 Because the Court finds a separation-of-powers violation, it does not

reach respondents' alternative theory that $ 27A(b) denied them due process under the Fifth Amendment, a theory the Court of Appeals did not
identify as an alternative ground for its holding. In my judgment, the
statute easily survives a due process challenge. Section 27A(b) is ration514us1$41i 05-27-98 15:19:40 PAGES OPINPGT

has never invalidated such a law on separation-of-powersgrounds until today. Indeed, only last Term we recognized

Congress' ample power to enact a law that "in effect `re-stored' rights that [a party] reasonably and in good faith
thought he possessed before the surprising announcement"of a Supreme Court decision.

Rivers v. Roadway Express,Inc., 511 U. S. 298, 310 (1994) (discussing Frisbie v. Whitney,

9 Wall. 187 (1870)). We conditioned our unambiguous re-statement of the proposition that "Congress had the power
to enact legislation that had the practical effect of restoringthe status quo retroactively," 511 U. S., at 310, only on Congress' clear expression of its intent to do so.A large class of investors reasonably and in good faith
thought they possessed rights of action before the surprisingannouncement of the

Lampf rule on June 20, 1991. When itenacted the 1991 amendment, Congress clearly expressed its

intent to restore the rights Lampf had denied the aggrievedclass. Section 27A comported fully with Rivers and with
other precedents in which we consistently have recognizedCongress' power to enact remedial statutes that set aside
classes of final judgments. The only remarkable feature of
ally related to a legitimate public purpose. Cf., e. g., Concrete Pipe &
Products of Cal., Inc. v. Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern Cal., 508 U. S. 602, 636-641 (1993). Given the existence of statutes
and rules, such as Rule 60(b), that allow courts to reopen apparently "final"
judgments in various circumstances, see infra, at 256-259, respondents
cannot assert an inviolable "vested right" in the District Court's postLampf dismissal of petitioners' claims. In addition, $ 27A(b) did not upset
any "settled expectations" of respondents. Cf. Landgraf v. USI Film
Products, 511 U. S. 244, 266 (1994). In Landgraf, we concluded that Congress did not intend $ 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a
(1988 ed., Supp. V), to apply retroactively because retroactive application
would have placed a new legal burden on past conduct. 511 U. S., at 280-
286. Before 1991 no one could have relied either on the yet-to-beannounced rule in Lampf or on the Court's unpredictable decision to apply
that rule retroactively. All of the reliance interests that ordinarily support a presumption against retroactivity militate in favor of allowing retroactive application of $ 27A.

this enactment is the fact that it remedied a defect in a new
judge-made rule rather than in a statute.

The familiar history the Court invokes, involving colonial
legislatures' ad hoc decisions of individual cases, " `unfettered
by rules,' " ante, at 220 (quoting Vermont State Papers 1779-
1786, p. 540 (Slade ed. 1823)), provides no support for its
holding. On the contrary, history and precedent demonstrate that Congress may enact laws that establish both substantive rules and procedures for reopening final judgments.
When it enacted the 1991 amendment to the Lampf rule,
Congress did not encroach on the judicial power. It decided
neither the merits of any 10b-5 claim nor even whether any
such claim should proceed to decision on the merits. It did
provide that the rule governing the timeliness of 10b-5 actions pending on June 19, 1991, should be the pre-Lampf
statute of limitations, and it also established a procedure for
Article III courts to apply in determining whether any dismissed case should be reinstated. Congress' decision to extend that rule and procedure to 10b-5 actions dismissed during the brief period between this Court's law-changing
decision in Lampf and Congress' remedial action is not a
sufficient reason to hold the statute unconstitutional.

I
Respondents conducted a public offering of common stock
in 1983. Petitioners, suing on behalf of themselves and
other purchasers of the stock, filed a 10b-5 action in 1987 in
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Kentucky, alleging violations of substantive federal rules
that had been in place since 1934. Respondents moved to
dismiss the complaint as untimely because petitioners had
filed it more than three years after the events in dispute.
At that time, settled law in Kentucky and elsewhere in the
United States directed federal courts to determine statutes
of limitations applicable to 10b-5 actions by reference to

250 PLAUT v. SPENDTHRIFT FARM, INC.

Stevens, J., dissenting
state law.3 The relevant Kentucky statute provided a 3-year limitations period,

4 which petitioners contended ran

from the time the alleged fraud was or should have beendiscovered. A Magistrate agreed with petitioners and recommended denial of respondents' motion to dismiss, but by1991 the District Court had not yet ruled on that issue. The
factual question whether petitioners should have discoveredrespondents' alleged 10b-5 violations more than three years
before they filed suit remained open for decision by an Arti-cle III judge on June 20, 1991.

On that day, this Court's decision in Lampf changed thelaw. The Court concluded that every 10b-5 action is time
barred unless brought within three years of the alleged vio-lation and one year of its discovery. Moreover, it applied
that novel rule to pending cases. As Justice O'Connorpointed out in her dissent, the Court held the plaintiffs' suit
"time barred under a limitations period that did not existbefore," a holding that "depart[ed] drastically from our established practice and inflict[ed] an injustice on the [plain-tiffs]."

Lampf, 501 U. S., at 369.5 The inequitable conse-quences of Lampf reached beyond the parties to that case,

3 "Federal judges have `borrowed' state statutes of limitations because
they were directed to do so by the Congress of the United States under

5 The Lampf opinion drew two other dissents. Justice Kennedy,

joined by Justice O'Connor, would have adopted a different substantive
limitations rule. See 501 U. S., at 374. Justice Souter and I would
have adhered to "four decades of . . . settled law" and maintained the
existing regime until Congress enacted a new federal statute of limitations. Id., at 366-367 (Stevens, J., dissenting). No one dissented from
the proposition that a uniform federal limitations period would be wise
policy.

injuring a large class of litigants that includes petitioners.Without resolving the factual issue that would have determined the timeliness of petitioners' complaint before Lampf,the District Court dismissed the instant action as untimely
under the new limitations period dictated by this Court.Because

Lampf had deprived them of any nonfrivolous basisfor an appeal, petitioners acquiesced in the dismissal, which

therefore became final on September 12, 1991.Congress responded to Lampf by passing $ 27A, which became effective on December 19, 1991. The statute changedthe substantive limitations law, restoring the pre-Lampf limitations rule for two categories of 10b-5 actions that hadbeen pending on June 19, 1991. Subsection (a) of $ 27A applies to cases that were still pending on December 19, 1991.The Courts of Appeals have uniformly upheld the constitutionality of that subsection,6 and its validity is not challengedin this case. Subsection (b) applies to actions, like the instant case, that (1) were dismissed after June 19, 1991, and(2) would have been timely under the preLampf regime.This subsection authorized the district courts to reinstate

dismissed cases if the plaintiff so moved within 60 days afterthe effective date of $ 27A. The amendment was not selfexecuting: Unless the plaintiff both filed a timely motion forreinstatement and then satisfied the court that the complaint
had been timely filed under applicable pre-Lampf law, thedismissal would remain in effect.

In this case petitioners made the required showing, butthe District Court refused to reinstate their case. Instead,

it held $ 27A(b) unconstitutional. 789 F. Supp. 231 (ED Ky.1992). The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, contrary

to an earlier decision of the Fifth Circuit, affirmed. 1 F. 3d1487 (1993).

II
Aside from $ 27A(b), the Court claims to "know of no in-stance in which Congress has attempted to set aside the final

judgment of an Article III court by retroactive legislation."
Ante, at 230. In fact, Congress has done so on several occa-sions. Section 27A(b) is part of a remedial statute. As

early as 1833, we recognized that a remedial statute author-izing the reopening of a final judgment after the time for
appeal has expired is "entirely unexceptionable" even thoughit operates retroactively. "It has been repeatedly decided in
this court, that the retrospective operation of such a lawforms no objection to it. Almost every law, providing a new
remedy, affects and operates upon causes of action existingat the time the law is passed." Sampeyreac v. United
States, 7 Pet. 222, 239 (1833). We have upheld remedial stat-utes that carried no greater cause for separation-of-powers
concerns than does $ 27A(b); others have provoked no chal-lenges. In contrast, the colonial directives on which the
majority relies were nothing like remedial statutes.The remedial 1830 law we construed in

Sampeyreacstrongly resembled $ 27A(b): It authorized a class of litigants

to reopen claims, brought under an 1824 statute, that courtshad already finally adjudicated. The 1824 statute authorized proceedings to establish title to certain lands in theState of Missouri and the territory of Arkansas. It provided
for an appeal to this Court within one year after the entryof the judgment or decree, "and should no appeal be taken,
the judgment or decree of the district court shall in like man-ner be final and conclusive." 7 Pet., at 238. In 1827 the
Arkansas Territorial Court entered a decree in favor of oneSampeyreac, over the objection of the United States that the
nominal plaintiff was a fictitious person. Because no appeal

253Cite as: 514 U. S. 211 (1995)
Stevens, J., dissenting
was taken from that decree, it became final in 1828. In 1830Congress passed a special statute authorizing the Arkansas

court to reopen any decree entered under the 1824 statuteif, prior to July 1, 1831, the United States filed a bill of
review alleging that the decree had been based on forged
evidence of title. The United States filed such a bill andobtained a reversal of the 1827 decree from the Arkansas

court.The successors in interest of the fictitious Mr. Sampeyreac
argued in this Court that the Arkansas court should not haveentertained the Government's bill of review because the 1830
statute "was the exercise of a judicial power, and it is no
answer to this objection, that the execution of its provisions
is given to a court. The legislature of the union cannot use
such a power." Id., at 229. We categorically rejected that
argument: "The law of 1830 is in no respect the exercise of
judicial powers." Id., at 239. Of course, as the majority
notes, ante, at 232-233, the particular decree at stake in
Sampeyreac had issued not from an Article III court but
from a territorial court. However, our opinion contains no
suggestion that Congress' power to authorize the reopening
of judgments entered by the Arkansas court was any
broader than its power to authorize the reopening of judgments entered under the same statute by the United States
District Court in Missouri. Moreover, the relevant judicial
power that the 1830 statute arguably supplanted was this
Court's Article III appellate jurisdiction--which, prior to the
1830 enactment, provided the only avenue for review of the
trial courts' judgments.

Similarly, in Freeborn v. Smith, 2 Wall. 160 (1865), the
Court rejected a challenge to an Act of Congress that removed an accidental impediment to the exercise of our appellate jurisdiction. When Congress admitted Nevada into the
Union as a State in March 1864, ch. 36, 13 Stat. 30, it neglected to provide for the disposition of pending appeals from
final judgments previously entered by the Supreme Court of

254 PLAUT v. SPENDTHRIFT FARM, INC.

Stevens, J., dissenting
the Nevada Territory. Accordingly, the Freeborn defendants in error moved to dismiss a writ of error to the territorial court on the ground that we had no power to decide
the case. At the suggestion of plaintiffs in error, the Court
deferred ruling on the motion until after February 27, 1865,
when Congress passed a special statute that authorized the
Court to decide this and similar cases.7 Defendants in error
renewed their motion, arguing that Congress could not reopen judgments that were already final and unreviewable
because Congress was not competent to exercise judicial
power.

Defendants in error argued that, "[i]f it be possible for a
right to attach itself to a judgment, it has done so here, and
there could not be a plainer case of an attempt to destroy it
by legislative action." 2 Wall., at 165. The Court, however,
noted that the omission in the 1864 statute had left the case
"in a very anomalous situation," id., at 174, and that passage
of the later statute "was absolutely necessary to remove an
impediment in the way of any legal proceeding in the case."
Id., at 175. It concluded that such "acts are of a remedial
character, and are peculiar subjects of legislation. They are
not liable to the imputation of being assumptions of judicial
power." Ibid. As in Sampeyreac, although Freeborn in7 The Act provided, in part:
"That all cases of appeal or writ of error heretofore prosecuted and now
pending in the supreme court of the United States, upon any record from
the supreme court of the Territory of Nevada, may be heard and determined by the supreme court of the United States, and the mandate of
execution or of further proceedings shall be directed by the supreme court
of the United States to the district court of the United States for the
district of Nevada, or to the supreme court of the State of Nevada, as the
nature of said appeal or writ of error may require, and each of these courts
shall be the successor of the supreme court of Nevada Territory as to all
such cases, with full power to hear and determine the same, and to award
mesne or final process thereon. . . . Provided, That said appeals shall be
prosecuted and said writs of errors sued out at any time before the first
day of July, eighteen hundred and sixty-six." Ch. 64, $ 8, 13 Stat. 441.

volved the review of a judgment entered by a territorialcourt, the "judicial power" to which the opinion referred was

this Court's Article III appellate jurisdiction. If Congressmay enact a law authorizing this Court to reopen decisions
that we previously lacked power to review, Congress must
have the power to let district courts reopen their ownjudgments.

Also apposite is United States v. Sioux Nation, 448 U. S.371 (1980), which involved the Sioux Nation's longstanding
claim that the Government had in 1877 improperly abrogatedthe treaty by which the Sioux had held title to the Black
Hills. The Sioux first brought their claim under a special
1920 jurisdictional statute. The Court of Claims dismissed
the suit in 1942, holding that the 1920 Act did not give the
court jurisdiction to consider the adequacy of the compensation the Government had paid in 1877. Congress passed a
new jurisdictional statute in 1946, and in 1950 the Sioux
brought a new action. In 1975 the Court of Claims, although acknowledging the merit of the Sioux's claim, held
that the res judicata effect of the 1942 dismissal barred the
suit. In response, Congress passed a statute in 1978 that
authorized the Court of Claims to take new evidence and
instructed it to consider the Sioux's claims on the merits,
disregarding res judicata. The Sioux finally prevailed. We
held that the 1978 Act did not violate the separation of
powers. 448 U. S., at 407.

The Court correctly notes, see ante, at 230-231, and n. 5,
that our opinion in Sioux Nation prominently discussed
precedents establishing Congress' power to waive the res
judicata effect of judgments against the United States. We
never suggested, however, that those precedents sufficed to
overcome the separation-of-powers objections raised against
the 1978 Act. Instead, we made extensive comments about
the propriety of Congress' action that were as necessary to
our holding then as they are salient to the Court's analysis
today. In passing the 1978 Act, we held, Congress

"only was providing a forum so that a new judicial re-view of the Black Hills claim could take place. This review was to be based on the facts found by the Court ofClaims after reviewing all the evidence, and an application of generally controlling legal principles to thosefacts. For these reasons, Congress was not reviewing
the merits of the Court of Claims' decisions, and did notinterfere with the finality of its judgments.

"Moreover, Congress in no way attempted to pre-scribe the outcome of the Court of Claims' new review
of the merits." 448 U. S., at 407.
Congress observed the same boundaries in enacting $ 27A(b).Our opinions in Sampeyreac, Freeborn, and Sioux Nation

correctly characterize statutes that specify new grounds forthe reopening of final judgments as remedial. Moreover,
these precedents correctly identify the unremarkable natureof the legislative power to enact remedial statutes. "[A]cts
. . . of a remedial character . . . are the peculiar subjects oflegislation. They are not liable to the imputation of being
assumptions of judicial power." Freeborn, 2 Wall., at 175.A few contemporary examples of such statutes will suffice to
demonstrate that they are ordinary products of the exerciseof legislative power.

The most familiar remedial measure that provides for re-opening of final judgments is Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure. That Rule both codified common-lawgrounds for relieving a party from a final judgment and
added an encompassing reference to "any other reason justi-fying relief from the operation of the judgment."

8 The full text of Rule 60(b) provides:
"On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a
party or a party's legal representative from a final judgment, order, or
proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise,
or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence
could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule
59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic),

single word in its text suggests that it does not apply to
judgments entered prior to its effective date. On the contrary, the purpose of the Rule, its plain language, and the
traditional construction of remedial measures all support
construing it to apply to past as well as future judgments.
Indeed, because the Rule explicitly abolished the commonlaw writs it replaced, an unintended gap in the law would
have resulted if it did not apply retroactively.9

misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged,
or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise
vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application; or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment. The motion shall be made within a reasonable
time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after the
judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or taken. A motion under
this subdivision (b) does not affect the finality of a judgment or suspend
its operation. This rule does not limit the power of a court to entertain
an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment, order, or proceeding, or to grant relief to a defendant not actually personally notified
as provided in Title 28, U. S. C. $ 1655, or to set aside a judgment for fraud
upon the court. Writs of coram nobis, coram vobis, audita querela, and
bills of review and bills in the nature of a bill of review, are abolished, and
the procedure for obtaining any relief from a judgment shall be by motion
as prescribed in these rules or by an independent action."

This Court adopted the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and submitted
them to Congress as the Rules Enabling Act required. They became effective after Congress adjourned without altering them. See generally
308 U. S. 647 (letter of transmittal to Congress, Jan. 3, 1938).

9 In its criticism of this analysis of Rule 60(b), the majority overstates

our holdings on retroactivity in Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 280, and Rivers v.
Roadway Express, Inc., 511 U. S. 298 (1994). Our opinion in Landgraf
nowhere says "that statutes do not apply retroactively unless Congress
expressly states that they do." Ante, at 237. To the contrary, it says
that, "[w]hen . . . the statute contains no such express command, the court
must determine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect,"
an inquiry that requires "clear congressional intent favoring such a result." Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 280 (emphasis added); see also id., at 273-
275; Rivers, 511 U. S., at 304-309. In the case of Rule 60(b), the factors

Other examples of remedial statutes that resemble $ 27Ainclude the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, 50

U. S. C. App. $ 520(4), which authorizes members of theArmed Forces to reopen judgments entered while they were
on active duty; the Handicapped Children's Protection Act of1986, 20 U. S. C. $ 1415(e)(4)(B) (1988 ed. and Supp. V), which
provided for recovery of attorney's fees under the Educationfor All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, 20 U. S. C. $ 1411
et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. V); 10 and the federal habeascorpus statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 2255, which authorizes federal
courts to reopen judgments of conviction. The habeas stat-ute, similarly to Rule 60(b), replaced a common-law writ, see
App. to H. R. Rep. No. 308, 80th Cong., 2d Sess., A180 (1947),and thus necessarily applied retroactively.

11 State statutes

that authorize the reopening of various types of default judg-ments

12 and judgments that became final before a party reintent. Moreover, neither Landgraf nor Rivers "rejected" consideration
of a statute's remedial purpose in analyzing Congress' intent to apply the
statute retroactively. Compare ante, at 237, with Landgraf, 511 U. S., at
281-286, and n. 37, and Rivers, 511 U. S., at 304-311.

10 When it enacted the Handicapped Children's Protection Act, Congress

overruled our contrary decision in Smith v. Robinson, 468 U. S. 992 (1984),
by applying the Act retroactively to any action either pending on or
brought after July 4, 1984, the day before we announced Smith. See 100
Stat. 798. Accordingly, a court has applied the Act retroactively to a case
in which the parties had entered into a consent decree prior to its enactment. See Counsel v. Dow, 849 F. 2d 731, 738-739 (CA2 1988). The
Court's attempts to explain away the retroactivity provision, ante, at 235-
236, simply do not comport with the plain language of the Act.

11 The Government also calls our attention to 28 U. S. C. $ 1655, a statute

that requires courts to reopen final in rem judgments upon entries of
appearance by defendants who were not personally served. See Brief for
United States 24-25, and n. 17. While that statute had only prospective
effect, the Court offers no reason why Congress could not pass a similar
statute that would apply retroactively to judgments entered under preexisting procedures.

ceived notice of their entry,13 as well as provisions for mo-tions to reopen based on newly discovered evidence,

demonstrate the widespread acceptance of remedial statutesthat allow courts to set aside final judgments. As in the

case of Rule 60(b), logic dictates that these statutes be con-strued to apply retroactively to judgments that were final at
the time of their enactments. All of these remedial statutesannounced generally applicable rules of law as well as establishing procedures for reopening final judgments.15In contrast, in the examples of colonial legislatures' review
of trial courts' judgments on which today's holding rests, thelegislatures issued directives in individual cases without purporting either to set forth or to apply any legal standard.Cf.

ante, at 219-225; see, e. g., INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919,961-962 (1983) (Powell, J., concurring in judgment). The

principal compendium on which the Court relies, ante, at 219,accurately describes these legislative directives:

"In these records, which are of the first quarter of the18th century, the provincial legislature will often be
found acting in a judicial capacity, sometimes tryingcauses in equity, sometimes granting equity powers to
some court of the common law for a particular tempo-rary purpose, and constantly granting appeals, new
trials, and other relief from judgments, on equitable
13 For example, a Virginia statute provides that, when a pro se litigant
fails to receive notice of the trial court's entry of an order, even after the
time to appeal has expired, the trial judge may within 60 days vacate the
order and grant the party leave to appeal. Va. Code Ann. $ 8.01-428(C)
(Supp. 1994).

14 See Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390, 410-411, and nn. 8-11 (1993)

(citing state statutes).

15 The Court offers no explanation of why the Constitution should be

construed to interpose an absolute bar against these statutes' retroactive
application. Under the Court's reasoning, for example, an amendment
that broadened the coverage of Rule 60(b) could not apply to any inequitable judgments entered prior to the amendment. The Court's rationale for
this formalistic restriction remains elusive.

grounds." Judicial Action by the Provincial Legisla-ture of Massachusetts, 15 Harv. L. Rev. 208, n. 1 (1902).

The Framers' disapproval of such a system of ad hoc legisla-tive review of individual trial court judgments has no bearing on remedial measures such as Rule 60(b) or the 1991amendment at issue today. The history on which the Court
relies provides no support for its holding.

III
The lack of precedent for the Court's holding is not, ofcourse, a sufficient reason to reject it. Correct application

of separation-of-powers principles, however, confirms thatthe Court has reached the wrong result. As our most recent
major pronouncement on the separation of powers noted, "wehave never held that the Constitution requires that the three
branches of Government `operate with absolute independ-ence.' " Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654, 693-694 (1988)
(quoting United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 707 (1974)).Rather, our jurisprudence reflects "Madison's flexible approach to separation of powers." Mistretta v. United States,488 U. S. 361, 380 (1989). In accepting Madison's conception
rather than any "hermetic division among the Branches," id.,at 381, "we have upheld statutory provisions that to some
degree commingle the functions of the Branches, but thatpose no danger of either aggrandizement or encroachment,"
id., at 382. Today's holding does not comport with theseideals.

Section 27A shares several important characteristics withthe remedial statutes discussed above. It does not decide
the merits of any issue in any litigation but merely removesan impediment to judicial decision on the merits. The impediment it removes would have produced inequity becausethe statute's beneficiaries did not cause the impediment. It
requires a party invoking its benefits to file a motion withina specified time and to convince a court that the statute entitles the party to relief. Most important, $ 27A(b) specifies

261Cite as: 514 U. S. 211 (1995)
Stevens, J., dissenting
both a substantive rule to govern the reopening of a classof judgments--the preLampf limitations rule--and a procedure for the courts to apply in determining whether aparticular motion to reopen should be granted. These characteristics are quintessentially legislative. They reflect
Congress' fealty to the separation of powers and its intentionto avoid the sort of ad hoc excesses the Court rightly criticizes in colonial legislative practice. In my judgment, all ofthese elements distinguish $ 27A from "judicial" action and
confirm its constitutionality. A sensible analysis would atleast consider them in the balance.

Instead, the Court myopically disposes of $ 27A(b) by holding that Congress has no power to "requir[e] an Article III
court to set aside a final judgment." Ante, at 240. That
holding must mean one of two things. It could mean that
Congress may not impose a mandatory duty on a court to set
aside a judgment even if the court makes a particular finding,
such as a finding of fraud or mistake, that Congress has not
made. Such a rule, however, could not be correct. Although Rule 60(b), for example, merely authorizes federal
courts to set aside judgments after making appropriate findings, Acts of Congress characteristically set standards that
judges are obligated to enforce. Accordingly, Congress
surely could add to Rule 60(b) certain instances in which
courts must grant relief from final judgments if they make
particular findings--for example, a finding that a member of
the jury accepted a bribe from the prevailing party. The
Court, therefore, must mean to hold that Congress may not
unconditionally require an Article III court to set aside a
final judgment. That rule is both unwise and beside the
point of this case.

A simple hypothetical example will illustrate the practical
failings of the Court's new rule. Suppose Congress, instead
of endorsing the new limitations rule fashioned by the Court
in Lampf, had decided to return to the pre-Lampf regime
(or perhaps to enact a longer uniform statute). Subsection

(a) of $ 27A would simply have provided that the law in effectprior to June 19, 1991, would govern the timeliness of all

10b-5 actions. In that event, subsection (b) would still havebeen necessary to remedy the injustice caused by this
Court's failure to exempt pending cases from its new rule.In my judgment, the statutory correction of the inequitable
flaw in Lampf would be appropriate remedial legislationwhether or not Congress had endorsed that decision's substantive limitations rule. The Court, unfortunately, appearsequally consistent: Even though the class of dismissed 10b-5
plaintiffs in my hypothetical would have been subject to thesame substantive rule as all other 10b-5 plaintiffs, the
Court's reasoning would still reject subsection (b) as animpermissible exercise of "judicial" power.

The majority's rigid holding unnecessarily hinders theGovernment from addressing difficult issues that inevitably
arise in a complex society. This Court, for example, lackspower to enlarge the time for filing petitions for certiorari
in a civil case after 90 days from the entry of final judgment,no matter how strong the equities. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2101(c).
If an Act of God, such as a flood or an earthquake, sufficientlydisrupted communications in a particular area to preclude
filing for several days, the majority's reasoning would appearto bar Congress from addressing the resulting inequity. If
Congress passed remedial legislation that retroactivelygranted movants from the disaster area extra time to file
petitions or motions for extensions of time to file, today'sholding presumably would compel us to strike down the legislation as an attack on the finality of judgments. Such aruling, like today's holding, would gravely undermine federal
courts' traditional power "to set aside a judgment whoseenforcement would work inequity." Ante, at 234.

16

16 The Court also appears to bar retroactive application of changes in
the criminal law. Its reasoning suggests that, for example, should Congress one day choose to abolish the federal death penalty, the new statute

Stevens, J., dissenting
Even if the rule the Court announces today were sound, itwould not control the case before us. In order to obtain the

benefit of $ 27A, petitioners had to file a timely motion andpersuade the District Court they had timely filed their complaint under pre-Lampf law. In the judgment of the Dis-trict Court, petitioners satisfied those conditions. Congress
reasonably could have assumed, indeed must have expected,that some movants under $ 27A(b) would fail to do so. The
presence of an important condition that the District Courtmust find a movant to have satisfied before it may reopen a
judgment distinguishes $ 27A from the unconditional con-gressional directives the Court appears to forbid.

Moreover, unlike the colonial legislative commands onwhich the Court bases its holding, $ 27A directed action not
in "a civil case," ante, at 223 (discussing Calder v. Bull, 3Dall. 386 (1798)), but in a large category of civil cases.

17 The

Court declares that a legislative direction to reopen a classof 40 cases is 40 times as bad as a direction to reopen a

single final judgment because "power is the object of theseparation-of-powers prohibition." See ante, at 228. This
self-evident observation might be salient if $ 27A(b) uncondi-tionally commanded courts to reopen judgments even absent
findings that the complaints were timely under pre-Lampflaw. But Congress did not decide--and could not know how
any court would decide--the timeliness issue in any particucould not constitutionally save a death row inmate from execution if his
conviction had become final before the statute was passed.

17 At the time Congress was considering the bill that became $ 27A, a

House Subcommittee reported that Lampf had resulted in the dismissal
of 15 cases, involving thousands of plaintiffs in every State (of whom over
32,000 had been identified) and claims totaling over $692.25 million. In
addition, motions to dismiss based on Lampf were then pending in 17 cases
involving thousands of plaintiffs in every State and claims totaling over
$4.578 billion. Hearing on H. R. 3185, before the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, 102d Cong., 1st Sess., 1-4 (1991).

lar case in the affected category. Congress, therefore, had
no way to identify which particular plaintiffs would benefit
from $ 27A. It merely enacted a law that applied a substantive rule to a class of litigants, specified a procedure for
invoking the rule, and left particular outcomes to individualized judicial determinations--a classic exercise of legislative power.

"All we seek," affirmed a sponsor of $ 27A, "is to give the
victims [of securities fraud] a fair day in court." 18 A statute, such as $ 27A, that removes an unanticipated and unjust
impediment to adjudication of a large class of claims on their
merits poses no danger of "aggrandizement or encroachment." Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 382.19 This is particularly
true for $ 27A in light of Congress' historic primacy over
statutes of limitations.20 The statute contains several
checks against the danger of congressional overreaching.
The Court in Lampf undertook a legislative function. Essentially, it supplied a statute of limitations for 10b-5 ac18 137 Cong. Rec. S18624 (Nov. 27, 1991) (statement of Sen. Bryan).
19 Today's decision creates a new irony of judicial legislation. A challenge to the constitutionality of $ 27A(a) could not turn on the sanctity of
final judgments. Section 27A(a) benefits litigants who had filed appeals
that Lampf rendered frivolous; petitioners and other law-abiding litigants
whose claims Lampf rendered untimely had acquiesced in the dismissal of
their actions. By striking down $ 27A(b) on a ground that would leave

$ 27A(a) intact, the Court indulges litigants who protracted proceedings
but shuts the courthouse door to litigants who proceeded with diligence
and respect for the Lampf judgment.

20 "Statutes of limitation find their justification in necessity and convenience rather than in logic. They represent expedients, rather than
principles. . . . They are by definition arbitrary, and their operation does
not discriminate between the just and the unjust claim, or the voidable
and unavoidable delay. They have come into the law not through the
judicial process but through legislation. They represent a public policy
about the privilege to litigate. . . . [T]he history of pleas of limitation shows
them to be good only by legislative grace and to be subject to a relatively
large degree of legislative control." Chase Securities Corp. v. Donaldson, 325 U. S. 304, 314 (1945) (Jackson, J.) (footnote and citation omitted).

tions. The Court, however, failed to adopt the transitionrules that ordinarily attend alterations shortening the time

to sue. Congress, in $ 27A, has supplied those rules. Thestatute reflects the ability of two coequal branches to cooperate in providing for the impartial application of legal rulesto particular disputes. The Court's mistrust of such cooperation ill serves the separation of powers.21

IV
The Court has drawn the wrong lesson from the Framers'disapproval of colonial legislatures' appellate review of judicial decisions. The Framers rejected that practice, not outof a mechanistic solicitude for "final judgments," but because
they believed the impartial application of rules of law, rather

21 Although I agree with Justice Breyer's general approach to the
separation-of-powers issue, I believe he gives insufficient weight to two
important features of $ 27A. First, he fails to recognize that the statute
restored a pre-existing rule of law in order to remedy the manifest injustice produced by the Court's retroactive application of Lampf. The only
" `substantial deprivation' " Congress imposed on defendants was that
properly filed lawsuits proceed to decisions on the merits. Cf. ante, at
242 (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting INS v. Chadha, 462
U. S. 919, 962 (1983) (Powell, J., concurring in judgment)). Second, he
understates the class of defendants burdened by $ 27A: He finds the statute underinclusive because it provided no remedy for potential plaintiffs
who may have failed to file timely actions in reliance on pre-Lampf limitations law, but he denies the importance of $ 27A(a), which provided a
remedy for plaintiffs who appealed dismissals after Lampf. See ante, at
243-244 (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment). The coverage of $ 27A is
coextensive with the retroactive application of the general rule announced
in Lampf. If Congress had enacted a statute providing that the Lampf
rule should apply to all cases filed after the statute's effective date and
that the pre-Lampf rule should apply to all cases filed before that date,
Justice Breyer could not reasonably condemn the statute as special legislation. The only difference between such a statute and $ 27A is that

$ 27A covered all cases pending on the date of Lampf--June 20, 1991--
rather than on the effective date of the statute--December 19, 1991. In
my opinion, $ 27A has sufficient generality to avoid the characteristics of
a bill of attainder.

than the will of the majority, must govern the disposition ofindividual cases and controversies. Any legislative interference in the adjudication of the merits of a particular casecarries the risk that political power will supplant evenhanded justice, whether the interference occurs before orafter the entry of final judgment. Cf.

United States v.Klein, 13 Wall. 128 (1872); Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409 (1792).

Section 27A(b) neither commands the reinstatement of anyparticular case nor directs any result on the merits. Congress recently granted a special benefit to a single litigant ina pending civil rights case, but the Court saw no need even
to grant certiorari to review that disturbing legislativefavor.

22 In an ironic counterpoint, the Court today places a

higher priority on protecting the Republic from the restora-tion to a large class of litigants of the opportunity to have

Article III courts resolve the merits of their claims."We must remember that the machinery of government
would not work if it were not allowed a little play in itsjoints."

Bain Peanut Co. of Tex. v. Pinson, 282 U. S. 499,501 (1931) (Holmes, J.). The three branches must cooperate

in order to govern. We should regard favorably, rather thanwith suspicious hostility, legislation that enables the judiciary to overcome impediments to the performance of its mis-sion of administering justice impartially, even when, as here,
this Court has created the impediment.23 Rigid rules oftenmake good law, but judgments in areas such as the review
of potential conflicts among the three coequal branches of the

Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 258 ("The parties agree that $ 402(b) [of the Civil
Rights Act of 1991] was intended to exempt a single disparate impact
lawsuit against the Wards Cove Packing Company").

23 Of course, neither the majority nor I would alter its analysis had Congress, rather than the Court, enacted the Lampf rule without any exemption for pending cases, then later tried to remedy such unfairness by enacting $ 27A. Thus, the Court's attribution of $ 27A to "the legislature's
genuine conviction (supported by all the law professors in the land) that
[Lampf] was wrong," ante, at 228, is quite beside the point.

Federal Government partake of art as well as science. Thatis why we have so often reiterated the insight of Justice

Jackson:

"The actual art of governing under our Constitutiondoes not and cannot conform to judicial definitions of the

power of any of its branches based on isolated clausesor even single Articles torn from context. While the
Constitution diffuses power the better to secure liberty,it also contemplates that practice will integrate the
dispersed powers into a workable government. It en-joins upon its branches separateness but interdependence, autonomy but reciprocity." Youngstown Sheet &Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 635 (1952) (concurring opinion).
We have the authority to hold that Congress has usurpeda judicial prerogative, but even if this case were doubtful I

would heed Justice Iredell's admonition in Calder v. Bull, 3Dall., at 399, that "the Court will never resort to that authority, but in a clear and urgent case." An appropriate regardfor the interdependence of Congress and the judiciary amply
supports the conclusion that $ 27A(b) reflects constructivelegislative cooperation rather than a usurpation of judicial
prerogatives.Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

v. WHITECOTTON et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe federal circuit

No. 94-372. Argued February 28, 1995--Decided April 18, 1995
Respondents, Margaret Whitecotton and her parents, filed a claim for compensation under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, alleging that Margaret had suffered encephalopathy as a result of her
vaccination against diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT). Under
the Act, a claimant who, like Margaret, does not attempt to prove actual
causation must make out a prima facie case by showing that "the first
symptom or manifestation of the onset . . . of any . . . [listed] condition . . . occurred within the time period after vaccine administration
set forth in the Vaccine Injury Table." 42 U. S. C. $ 300aa-11(c)(1)(C)(i).
That table specifies a 3-day period for encephalopathy following a DPT
vaccination. $ 300aa-14(a). The Special Master ruled that Margaret
had failed to make out a prima facie case, finding, inter alia, that by the
time she received her vaccination she was "clearly microcephalic," that
this condition evidenced pre-existing encephalopathy, and that, accordingly, "the first symptom or manifestation" of her condition's onset had
occurred before her vaccination and the 3-day table period. The Court
of Federal Claims affirmed, but the Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit reversed, holding, among other things, that a claimant satisfies
the table requirements whenever she shows that any symptom or manifestation of a listed condition occurred within the table time period,
even if there was evidence of the condition before the vaccination.

Held: A claimant who shows that she experienced symptoms of an injury

after receiving a vaccination does not make out a prima facie case for
compensation under the Act where the evidence fails to indicate that
she had no symptoms of that injury before the vaccination. The Court
of Appeals' assertion that the Act does not "expressly state" that a
claimant relying on the table must show that the child sustained no
injury prior to her vaccination--i. e., that the first symptom of the injury occurred after vaccination--simply does not square with $ 300aa-

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question in this case is whether a claimant who showsthat she experienced symptoms of an injury after receiving

a vaccination makes out a prima facie case for compensationunder the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986,
100 Stat. 3755, 42 U. S. C. $ 300aa-1 et seq. (1988 ed. andSupp. V), where the evidence fails to indicate that she had
no symptoms of that injury before the vaccination. We holdthat the claimant does not make out a case for compensation.

270 SHALALA v. WHITECOTTON

Opinion of the Court
No. 99-908, pp. 3-7 (1986). Special masters in the Court ofFederal Claims hear vaccine-related complaints, 42 U. S. C.

$ 300aa-12(c) (1988 ed., Supp. V), which they adjudicate in-formally, $ 300aa-12(d)(2), within strict time limits, $ 300aa-
12(d)(3)(A), subject to similarly expeditious review, $ 300aa-
12(e)(2). A claimant alleging that more than $1,000 indamages resulted from a vaccination after the Act's effective

date in 1988 must exhaust the Act's procedures and refuseto accept the resulting judgment before filing any

de novo
civil action in state or federal court. 42 U. S. C. $ 300aa-11(a) (1988 ed. and Supp. V).

The streamlining does not stop with the mechanics of
litigation, but goes even to substantive standards of proof.
While a claimant may establish prima facie entitlement to
compensation by introducing proof of actual causation,

$ 300aa-11(c)(1)(C)(ii), she can reach the same result by
meeting the requirements of what the Act calls the Vaccine Injury Table. The table lists the vaccines covered
under the Act, together with particular injuries or conditions
associated with each one. 42 U. S. C. $ 300aa-14 (1988 ed.,
Supp. V). A claimant who meets certain other conditions
not relevant here makes out a prima facie case by showing
that she (or someone for whom she brings a claim) "sustained, or had significantly aggravated, any illness, disability,
injury, or condition set forth in the Vaccine Injury Table
in association with [a] vaccine . . . or died from the administration of such vaccine, and the first symptom or manifestation of the onset or of the significant aggravation of any
such illness, disability, injury, or condition or the death occurred within the time period after vaccine administration
set forth in the Vaccine Injury Table." 42 U. S. C. $ 300aa-
11(c)(1)(C)(i). Thus, the rule of prima facie proof turns the
old maxim on its head by providing that if the post hoc event
happens fast, ergo propter hoc. The Secretary of Health and
Human Services may rebut a prima facie case by proving
that the injury or death was in fact caused by "factors unre514us1$42M 05-29-98 14:52:58 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
lated to the administration of the vaccine . . . ." $ 300aa-13(a)(1)(B). If the Secretary fails to rebut, the claimant is

entitled to compensation. 42 U. S. C. $ 300aa-13(a)(1) (1988ed. and Supp. V).

Respondents, Margaret Whitecotton and her parents, filed
a claim under the Act for injuries Margaret allegedly sus-tained as a result of vaccination against diphtheria, pertussis,

and tetanus (or DPT) on August 18, 1975, when she wasnearly four months old. They alleged that Margaret (whom
we will refer to as claimant) had suffered encephalopathyafter the DPT vaccination, and they relied on the table
scheme to make out a prima facie case. The Act defines encephalopathy as "any significant acquired abnormality of,
or injury to, or impairment of function of the brain," 42
U. S. C. $ 300aa-14(b)(3)(A), and lists the condition on the
Vaccine Injury Table in association with the DPT vaccine.
Under the Act, a claimant who does not prove actual causation must show that "the first symptom or manifestation of
the onset or of the significant aggravation" of encephalopathy occurred within three days of a DPT vaccination in order
to make out a prima facie right to compensation. $ 300aa-
11(c)(1)(C)(i); 42 U. S. C. $ 300aa-14(a) (1988 ed., Supp. V).

The Special Master found that claimant had suffered clonic
seizures on the evening after her vaccination and again the
following morning, App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a, 27a, and
accepted those seizures as symptoms of encephalopathy.
He also found, however, that by the time claimant received
the vaccination she was "clearly microcephalic" (meaning
that she had a head size more than two standard deviations
below the mean for a girl her age) and that her microcephaly
was a symptom or evidence of encephalopathy that existed
before the vaccination. Id., at 32a-33a. Accordingly, the
Master concluded that the first symptom or manifestation
of the onset of claimant's encephalopathy had occurred before the vaccination and the ensuing 3-day period provided
for in the table. Id., at 34a.

514us1$42M 05-29-98 14:52:58 PAGES OPINPGT
272 SHALALA v. WHITECOTTON

Opinion of the Court
The Master then considered whether the series of seizureswas "the first symptom or manifestation . . . of [a] significant

aggravation" of the claimant's encephalopathy, 42 U. S. C.$ 300aa-11(c)(1)(C)(i), and again decided that it was not.
The Act defines "significant aggravation" as "any change for
the worse in a preexisting condition which results in mark-edly greater disability, pain, or illness accompanied by substantial deterioration of health." $ 300aa-33(4). The Mas-ter found that "[t]here is nothing to distinguish this case
from what would reasonably have been expected consider-ing [claimant's] microcephaly. . . . [T]here was nothing that
occurred in temporal relationship to the DPT vaccination
which indicates that it is more likely than not that the vaccine permanently aggravated her condition. . . . [T]he seizures did not continue and there was no dramatic turn for
the worse in her condition . . . . Thus, there is no basis for
implicating the vaccine as the cause of any aspect of [claimant's] present condition." App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a-43a.
Because he found that claimant had failed to satisfy the table
requirements, and had not tried to prove actual causation,
the Master denied her compensation for failure to make out
a prima facie case.

The Court of Federal Claims found the Master's decision
neither arbitrary nor otherwise unlawful, see 42 U. S. C.

$ 300aa-12(e)(2) (1988 ed., Supp. V), and affirmed. The
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit then reversed, holding that a claimant satisfies the table requirements for the
"first symptom or manifestation of the onset" of an injury
whenever she shows that any symptom or manifestation of
a listed condition occurred within the time period after vaccination specified in the table, even if there was evidence of
the condition before the vaccination. Because claimant here
showed symptoms of encephalopathy during the 3-day period
after her DPT vaccination, the Court of Appeals concluded
for that reason alone that she had made out a prima facie
entitlement to recovery. 17 F. 3d 374, 376-377 (1994).

Opinion of the Court
The Court of Appeals went on to say that the Secretaryhad failed to rebut this prima facie case because she had not

shown that claimant's encephalopathy was caused by "factorsunrelated to the administration of the vaccine," 42 U. S. C.

$ 300aa-13(a)(1)(B). The Court of Appeals relied on the pro-vision that a "facto[r] unrelated" cannot include an "idiopathic" condition, $ 300aa-13(a)(2)(A), which the court readto mean that even when the Secretary can point to a specific
factor, unrelated to the vaccine, as the source of a claimant'sinjury, she does not defeat a prima facie case when the cause
of the identified factor is itself unknown. Taking the Sec-retary to have relied on claimant's microcephaly as the unrelated factor (or as associated with it), the court ruled theSecretary's evidence insufficient on the ground that the cause
of microcephaly is unknown. 17 F. 3d, at 377-378.*We granted certiorari to address the Court of Appeals's
construction of the Act's requirements for making and rebut-ting a prima facie case. 513 U. S. 959 (1994). Because we
hold that the court erroneously construed the provisions de-fining a prima facie case under the Act, we reverse without
reaching the adequacy of the Secretary's rebuttal.

II
The Court of Appeals declared that nowhere does the Act"expressly state" that a claimant relying on the table to

establish a prima facie case for compensation must show"that the child sustained no injury prior to administration
of the vaccine," that is, that the first symptom of the injury

*The Court of Appeals's language can also be read as casting doubt on
the Special Master's conclusion that claimant's microcephaly evidenced a
pre-existing encephalopathy. We express no view as to the validity of
that conclusion.

The Secretary has recently issued new regulations that may affect the
Court of Appeals's definition of an idiopathic condition in future cases.
These regulations apply only to petitions for compensation filed after
March 10, 1995, and accordingly have no application to the present case.

Opinion of the Court
occurred after vaccination. 17 F. 3d, at 376. This statement simply does not square with the plain language of
the statute. In laying out the elements of a prima facie
case, the Act provides that a claimant relying on the table
(and not alleging significant aggravation) must show that
"the first symptom or manifestation of the onset . . . of [her
table illness] . . . occurred within the time period after vaccine administration set forth in the Vaccine Injury Table."

$ 300aa-11(c)(1)(C)(i). If a symptom or manifestation of a
table injury has occurred before a claimant's vaccination,
a symptom or manifestation after the vaccination cannot
be the first, or signal the injury's onset. There cannot be
two first symptoms or onsets of the same injury. Thus, a
demonstration that the claimant experienced symptoms of
an injury during the table period, while necessary, is insufficient to make out a prima facie case. The claimant must
also show that no evidence of the injury appeared before
the vaccination.

In coming to the contrary conclusion, the Court of Appeals
relied on language in the table, which contains the heading,
"Time period for first symptom or manifestation of onset
. . . after vaccine administration." 42 U. S. C. $ 300aa-14(a)
(1988 ed., Supp. V). The Court of Appeals saw a "significant" distinction, 17 F. 3d, at 376, between this language and
that of 42 U. S. C. $ 300aa-11(c)(1)(C)(i), which is set forth
above. We do not. The key to understanding the heading
is the word "onset." Since the symptom or manifestation
occurring after the vaccination must be evidence of the table
injury's onset, an injury manifested before the vaccination
could qualify only on the theory that it could have two onsets, one before the vaccination, one after it. But it cannot:
one injury, one onset. Indeed, even if the language of the
heading did conflict with the text of $ 300aa-11(c)(1)(C)(i), the
latter would prevail, since the table heading was obviously
meant to be a short form of the text preceding it.

275Cite as: 514 U. S. 268 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
The Court of Appeals sought to shore up the contrary con-clusion with two further arguments. As the court read the

Act, Congress "expressly made the absence of preexistinginjury an element of the prima facie case" for residual seizure disorder (another table injury), 17 F. 3d, at 376; thus,
the court reasoned, Congress had implicitly rejected anyneed to negate the pre-existence of other injuries like encephalopathy. This argument rests on a misreading of thelanguage in question. The statutory notes explaining the
table provide that a claimant "may be considered to havesuffered a residual seizure disorder if [she] did not suffer a
seizure or convulsion unaccompanied by fever or accompanied by a fever of less than 102 degrees Fahrenheit before
the first seizure or convulsion after the administration of
the vaccine involved . . . ." $ 300aa-14(b)(2). But this is
not the language that requires a claimant alleging a seizure
disorder to demonstrate the absence of pre-existing symptoms. This provision specifies instead that certain types of
seizures (those accompanied by a high fever) may not be considered symptoms of residual seizure disorder, and, so, do
not preclude a prima facie case even when a claimant suffered them before vaccination. The language carries no implication about a claimant's burden generally and does nothing to undermine Congress's global provision that a claimant
who has actually suffered symptoms of a listed injury before
vaccination cannot make out a prima facie case of the injury's
onset after vaccination.

Finally, we cannot accept the Court of Appeals's argument
that because the causal "factors unrelated" on which the Secretary may rely to defeat a prima facie case can include occurrences before vaccination, see $ 300aa-13(a)(2)(B), such
occurrences cannot bar the establishment of a prima facie
case in the first instance. The "factors unrelated" provision
is wholly independent of the first-symptom and onset provisions, serving the distinct purpose of allowing the Secretary
to defeat a claim even when an injury has not manifested

itself before vaccination. It does not relieve a claimant ofthe clear statutory requirements for making out a prima

facie case. III

The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the FederalCircuit is accordingly reversed, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Breyer joins,concurring.

Margaret Whitecotton was born in 1975 with a conditionknown as microcephaly, defined commonly (but not universally) as a head size smaller than two standard deviationsbelow the norm. At the age of four months, she received a
diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT) vaccination. Priorto receiving her vaccine, Margaret had never had a seizure.
The day after receiving her vaccine, she suffered a series ofseizures that required three days of hospitalization. Over
the next five years, Margaret had intermittent seizures.She now has cerebral palsy and hip and joint problems and
cannot communicate verbally. In 1990, Margaret's parentsapplied for compensation for her injuries under the National
Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986. The Special Masterdenied compensation, and the Court of Federal Claims
agreed. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit re-versed, 17 F. 3d 374 (1994), finding that the Whitecottons had
made out a prima facie case for compensation.Although I join the Court's opinion rejecting the Court of
Appeals' reading of the pertinent statutory provision, I writeseparately to make two points. First, I wish to indicate an
additional factor supporting my conclusion that the Court ofAppeals' reading of 42 U. S. C. $ 300aa-11(c)(1)(C)(i) is inconsistent with congressional intent. Second, I wish to under-score the limited nature of the question the Court decides.

277Cite as: 514 U. S. 268 (1995)
O'Connor, J., concurring
Examining the language of $ 300aa-11(c)(1)(C)(i), theCourt properly rejects the Court of Appeals' determination

that a claimant may make out a prima facie "onset" case sim-ply by proving that she experienced a symptom of a "table
illness" within the specified period after receiving a vaccination. Ante, at 273-274. To establish a table case, the stat-ute requires that a claimant prove by a preponderance of the

evidence either (1) that she suffered the first symptom ormanifestation of the onset of a table condition within the
period specified in the table or (2) that she suffered the firstsymptom or manifestation of a significant aggravation of
a pre-existing condition within the same period. As the
Court rightly concludes, proof that the claimant suffered a
symptom within the period is necessary but not sufficient
to satisfy either burden; the word "first" is significant and
requires that the claimant demonstrate that the postvaccine
symptom, whether of onset or of significant aggravation, was
in fact the very first such manifestation.

The Court relies on a commonsense consideration of the
words "first" and "onset" in reaching this conclusion: "If a
symptom or manifestation of a table injury has occurred before a claimant's vaccination, a symptom or manifestation
after the vaccination cannot be the first, or signal the injury's
onset." Ante, at 274. I find equally persuasive the observation that the Court of Appeals' reading deprives the "significant aggravation" language in the provision of all meaningful effect. The term "significant aggravation" is defined
in the statute to mean "any change for the worse in a preexisting condition which results in markedly greater disability, pain, or illness accompanied by substantial deterioration of health." 42 U. S. C. $ 300aa-33(4). If, as the Court
of Appeals determined, a claimant makes out an "onset" case
any time she can demonstrate that any symptom occurred
within the relevant period, all cases in which children experience postvaccine symptoms within the table period become "onset" cases. The phrase "significant aggravation,"

278 SHALALA v. WHITECOTTON

O'Connor, J., concurring
and any limitations Congress sought to impose by includinglanguage like "

markedly greater disability" and "substantial
deterioration of health," are altogether lost.To the extent possible, we adhere to "the elementary

canon of construction that a statute should be interpreted
so as not to render one part inoperative." Department of
Revenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc., 510 U. S. 332, 340
(1994) (internal quotation marks omitted); Pennsylvania
Dept. of Public Welfare v. Davenport, 495 U. S. 552, 562
(1990). The construction adopted by the Court of Appealscontravenes this principle. Our reading gives effect to the

"onset" and the "significant aggravation" language while according "first" its commonsense meaning.

Today's decision is quite limited. The Court of Appeals
had no occasion to address the Whitecottons' challenges to
the Special Master's factual findings with respect to their
daughter's condition. We assume, arguendo, the soundness
of his conclusions that Margaret Whitecotton suffered a preexisting encephalopathy that was manifested by her prevaccine microcephaly. But this may not be the case, and the
Whitecottons of course may challenge these findings as
clearly erroneous on remand. The Court of Appeals also
did not address the Whitecottons' argument, rejected by the
Special Master, that their daughter suffered a significant aggravation of whatever pre-existing condition she may have
had as a result of the vaccine. This factual challenge appears to be open as well, as does a challenge to the legal
standard used by the Special Master to define "significant
aggravation."

We also do not pass on the Secretary's argument that the
Court of Appeals misstated petitioner's burden under 42
U. S. C. $ 300aa-13(a)(1)(B) (1988 ed. and Supp. V) in rebutting a claimant's prima facie case. Given our holding with
respect to the claimant's burden, it is speculative at this time
whether any effort on our part to evaluate the Court of Appeals' approach to the "facto[r] unrelated" standard will find

concrete application in this case. That said, the approachtaken by the Court of Appeals, under which the Secretary

may not point to an underlying condition that predated useof a vaccine and obviously caused a claimant's ill health, if
the cause of that underlying condition is unknown, may wellwarrant our attention in the future.

FREIGHTLINER CORP. et al. v. MYRICK et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 94-286. Argued February 22, 1995--Decided April 18, 1995
In separate state common-law suits, respondents alleged that the absence

of an antilock braking system (ABS) in tractor-trailers manufactured by
petitioners constituted a negligent design defect that caused accidents
injuring one respondent and killing another's spouse. The District
Court granted summary judgments for petitioners, holding that respondents' claims were pre-empted by the National Traffic and Motor
Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (Act) and by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration's Standard 121, even though the applicable portion of that standard had previously been suspended by the Ninth Circuit. Among other things, the Act forbids any State to "establish, or
continue in effect," a motor vehicle safety standard "[w]henever a Federal . . . standard . . . is in effect" with respect to "the same aspect of
performance," 15 U. S. C. $ 1392(d), while Standard 121 imposed vehicle
stability requirements and truck stopping distances shorter than those
that could be achieved with brakes lacking ABS. The Eleventh Circuit
consolidated the cases and reversed, holding that respondents' claims
were not expressly pre-empted under Circuit precedent and were not
impliedly pre-empted due to a conflict between state law and the federal
regulatory scheme.

Held:

1. Respondents' lawsuits are not expressly pre-empted. Because of
Standard 121's suspension, there is simply no "minimum," $ 1391(2),
"objective," $ 1392(a), federal standard addressing stopping distances or
vehicle stability for trucks. States thus remain free to "establish, or
continue in effect," their own safety standards concerning those "aspects of performance." $ 1392(d). Moreover, the absence of regulation
cannot itself constitute regulation in this instance. The lack of a federal
standard did not result from an affirmative decision of officials to refrain
from regulating brakes, but from the decision of a federal court that the
Government had not compiled sufficient evidence to justify its regulations. Ray v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 435 U. S. 151, 178, distinguished.
Pp. 286-287.

2. Because respondents' common-law actions do not conflict with federal law, they cannot be pre-empted by implication. This Court has
found implied conflict pre-emption where it is "impossible for a private

v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, 518, distinguished. First, it is not
impossible for petitioners to comply with both federal and state law
because there is simply no federal standard for a private party to comply with. Nothing in the Act or its regulations currently regulates the
use of ABS devices. Second, a finding of liability against petitioners
would undermine no federal objectives or purposes with respect to such

Opinion of the Court
Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
By statute, the Secretary of Transportation has the au-thority to issue appropriate safety standards for motor vehicles and their equipment. Respondents filed lawsuits under
state common law alleging negligent design defects in equip-ment manufactured by petitioners. Petitioners claim that

these actions are pre-empted by a federal safety standard,even though the standard was suspended by a federal court.
We hold that the absence of a federal standard cannot implicitly extinguish state common law.

I
This case arises from two separate but essentially identical
accidents in Georgia involving tractor-trailers. In bothcases, 18-wheel tractor-trailers attempted to brake suddenly

and ended up jackknifing into oncoming traffic. Neither ve-hicle was equipped with an antilock braking system (ABS).

In the first case, respondent Ben Myrick was the driver ofan oncoming vehicle that was hit by a tractor-trailer manufactured by petitioner Freightliner. The accident left himpermanently paraplegic and brain damaged. In the second
case, the driver of an oncoming car, Grace Lindsey, waskilled when her vehicle collided with a tractor-trailer manufactured by petitioner Navistar.

1 ABS "helps prevent loss of control situations by automatically controlling the amount of braking pressure applied to a wheel. With these systems, the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) monitors wheel-speeds, and
changes in wheel-speeds, based on electric signals transmitted from sensors located at the wheels or within the axle housings. If the wheels start
to lock, the ECU signals a modulator control valve to actuate, thereby
reducing the amount of braking pressure applied to the wheel that is being
monitored." 57 Fed. Reg. 24213 (1992).

In respondent Myrick's case, the District Court held that the claims were pre-empted by federallaw and granted summary judgment for petitioner Freightliner. Myrick v. Fruehauf Corp., 795 F. Supp. 1139 (ND Ga.1992). Following the opinion in the Myrick case, the District Court granted summary judgment in the Lindsey actionin favor of petitioner Navistar.

The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit consoli-dated the cases and reversed.

in Taylor v. General Motors Corp., 875 F. 2d 816 (CA111989), cert. denied, 494 U. S. 1065 (1990), the state-law tort
claims were not expressly pre-empted. The Court of Ap-peals rejected petitioners' alternative argument that the
claims were pre-empted due to a conflict between state lawand the federal regulatory scheme. We granted certiorari,

In 1966, Congress enacted the Safety Act "to reduce trafficaccidents and deaths and injuries to persons resulting from

traffic accidents." 15 U. S. C. $ 1381. The Act requires
the Secretary of Transportation to establish "appropriateFederal motor vehicle safety standards." $ 1392(a). The

Act defines a safety standard as "a minimum standard for

Opinion of the Court
motor vehicle performance, or motor vehicle equipment per-formance, which is practicable, which meets the need for

motor vehicle safety and which provides objective criteria."$ 1391(2).

The Safety Act's express pre-emption clause provides:

"Whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standardestablished under this subchapter is in effect, no State

or political subdivision of a State shall have any author-ity either to establish, or to continue in effect, with respect to any motor vehicle or item of motor vehicleequipment any safety standard applicable to the same
aspect of performance of such vehicle or item of equip-ment which is not identical to the Federal standard.
Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventingany State from enforcing any safety standard which is
identical to a Federal safety standard." $ 1392(d).
The Act also contains a saving clause, which states: "Compli-ance with any Federal motor vehicle safety standard issued

under this subchapter does not exempt any person from anyliability under common law." $ 1397(k).

The Secretary has delegated the authority to promulgatesafety standards to the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). 49 CFR$ 1.50(a) (1994). In 1970, the predecessor to NHTSA issued
regulations concerning vehicles equipped with air brakes,which are used in trucks and tractor-trailers. Known as
Standard 121, this regulation imposed stopping distancesand vehicle stability requirements for trucks. See 36 Fed.
Reg. 3817 (1971).2 Because these stopping distances were

2 Standard 121 required air-brake equipped vehicles to stop within certain distances at various speeds without deviating from a 12-foot-wide
lane, and without any wheel lock-up. 49 CFR $ 571.121 S5.3.1 (1972).
The initial stopping distance requirement from 60 miles per hour was 217
feet on a dry surface. The regulation also established brake actuation
and release times, as well as other aspects of brake performance. Ibid.

Opinion of the Court
shorter than those that could be achieved with brakes with-out ABS, several manufacturers notified NHTSA that ABS

devices would be required. Some manufacturers askedNHTSA to alter the standard itself because they believed
that ABS devices were unreliable and rendered vehicles dangerously unsafe when combined with new, more effectivebrakes. In 1974, NHTSA responded that Standard 121 was

practical and that ABS devices did not cause accidents. Seegenerally

Paccar, Inc. v. NHTSA, 573 F. 2d 632, 637-638
(CA9), cert. denied, 439 U. S. 862 (1978).Several manufacturers and trade associations then sought

review of Standard 121 in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit. That court remanded the case to NHTSA because
"a careful review of the extensive record" indicated that "the
Standard was neither reasonable nor practicable at the time
it was put into effect." 573 F. 2d, at 640. The court found
that NHTSA had failed to consider the high failure rate of
ABS devices placed in actual use, id., at 642, and that "there
[was] a strong probability that [ABS] has created a potentially more hazardous highway situation than existed before
the Standard became operative," id., at 643. Until NHTSA
compiled sufficient evidence to show that ABS would not create the possibility of greater danger, the court concluded, the
Standard would remain suspended. Ibid.

After the Ninth Circuit's decision in Paccar, the agency
amended Standard 121 so that the stopping distance and
lock-up requirements no longer applied to trucks and trailers. NHTSA nevertheless left the unamended Standard 121
in the Code of Federal Regulations so that "the affected
sections [could] most easily be reinstated" when the agency
met Paccar's requirements. 44 Fed. Reg. 46849 (1979).
NHTSA also stated that the provisions would remain in
place so that manufacturers would know "what the agency
still considers to be reasonable standards for minimum acceptable performance." Ibid. Although NHTSA has developed new stopping distance standards, to this day it still

Opinion of the Court
has not taken final action to reinstate a safety standard gov-erning the stopping distance of trucks and trailers.

III
Despite the fact that Standard 121 remains suspended,petitioners maintain that respondents' lawsuits are expressly

pre-empted. We disagree. The Act's pre-emption clauseapplies only "[w]henever a Federal motor vehicle safety
standard . . . is in effect" with respect to "the same aspectof performance" regulated by a state standard. 15 U. S. C.

$ 1392(d). There is no express federal standard addressingstopping distances or vehicle stability for trucks or trailers.
No NHTSA regulation currently establishes a "minimumstandard for . . . motor vehicle equipment performance,"

$ 1391(2), nor is any standard "stated in objective terms,"$ 1392(a). There is simply no minimum, objective standard
stated at all. Therefore, States remain free to "establish, orto continue in effect," their own safety standards concerning
those "aspect[s] of performance." $ 1392(d).Petitioners insist, however, that the absence of regulation
itself constitutes regulation. Relying upon our opinion inRay v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 435 U. S. 151 (1978), petitioners assert that the failure of federal officials " `affirmativelyto exercise their full authority takes on the character of a
ruling that no such regulation is appropriate or approvedpursuant to the policy of the statute.' "

Id., at 178 (quotingBethlehem Steel Co. v. New York State Labor Relations Bd.,

330 U. S. 767, 774 (1947). Unlike this case, however, wefound in Ray that Congress intended to centralize all authority over the regulated area in one decisionmaker: the FederalGovernment. 435 U. S., at 177. Here, there is no evidence
that NHTSA decided that trucks and trailers should be freefrom all state regulation of stopping distances and vehicle
stability. Indeed, the lack of federal regulation did not re-sult from an affirmative decision of agency officials to refrain
from regulating air brakes. NHTSA did not decide that the

Opinion of the Court
minimum, objective safety standard required by 15 U. S. C.$ 1392(a) should be the absence of all standards, both federal

and state.3 Rather, the lack of a federal standard stemmedfrom the decision of a federal court that the agency had
not compiled sufficient evidence to justify its regulations.

IV
Even if $ 1392(d) does not expressly extinguish state tortlaw, petitioners argue that respondents' lawsuits are preempted by implication because the state-law principle theyseek to vindicate would conflict with federal law. We have
recognized that a federal statute implicitly overrides statelaw either when the scope of a statute indicates that Congress intended federal law to occupy a field exclusively, English v. General Elec. Co., 496 U. S. 72, 78-79 (1990), or whenstate law is in actual conflict with federal law. We have

found implied conflict pre-emption where it is "impossiblefor a private party to comply with both state and federal
requirements," id., at 79, or where state law "stands as anobstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress." Hines v. Davidowitz,312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941).

A
As an initial matter, we must address the argument thatwe need not reach the conflict pre-emption issue at all. According to respondents and the Court of Appeals, Cipollonev. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504 (1992), held that implied
pre-emption cannot exist when Congress has chosen to in-clude an express pre-emption clause in a statute. This argument is without merit. In Cipollone we did hold that the

3 Because no federal safety standard exists, we need not reach respondents' argument that the term "standard" in 15 U. S. C. $ 1392(d) pre-empts
only state statutes and regulations, but not common law. We also need
not address respondents' claim that the saving clause, $ 1397(k), does not
permit a manufacturer to use a federal safety standard to immunize itself
from state common-law liability.

288 FREIGHTLINER CORP. v. MYRICK

Opinion of the Court
pre-emptive scope of the two statutes at issue was governedby the language in each Act. That conclusion rested on a

familiar canon of statutory construction and on the absenceof any reason to infer any broader pre-emption. Instead of
announcing a categorical rule precluding the coexistence of
express and implied pre-emption, however, the relevant pas-sage in the opinion stated:

"In our opinion, the pre-emptive scope of the 1965 Act
and the 1969 Act is governed entirely by the expresslanguage in $ 5 of each Act. When Congress has considered the issue of pre-emption and has included in the
enacted legislation a provision explicitly addressing thatissue, and when that provision provides a `reliable indicium of congressional intent with respect to state au-thority,'

Malone v. White Motor Corp., 435 U. S., at 505,
`there is no need to infer congressional intent to pre-empt state laws from the substantive provisions' of the

legislation. California Federal Savings & Loan Assn.
v. Guerra, 479 U. S. 272, 282 (1987) (opinion of Marshall, J.). Such reasoning is a variant of the familiar
principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius: Con-gress' enactment of a provision defining the pre-emptive

reach of a statute implies that matters beyond thatreach are not pre-empted. In this case, the other provisions of the 1965 and 1969 Acts offer no cause to lookbeyond $ 5 of each Act. Therefore, we need only identify the domain expressly pre-empted by each of those
sections. As the 1965 and 1969 provisions differ sub-stantially, we consider each in turn."

Id., at 517.

The fact that an express definition of the pre-emptive
reach of a statute "implies"--i. e., supports a reasonable inference--that Congress did not intend to pre-empt other
matters does not mean that the express clause entirely forecloses any possibility of implied pre-emption. Indeed, just
two paragraphs after the quoted passage in Cipollone, we

Opinion of the Court
engaged in a conflict pre-emption analysis of the FederalCigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, 79 Stat. 282, as

amended, 15 U. S. C. $ 1331 et seq., and found "no gen-eral, inherent conflict between federal pre-emption of state
warning requirements and the continued vitality of statecommon-law damages actions." 505 U. S., at 518. Our subsequent decisions have not read Cipollone to obviate theneed for analysis of an individual statute's pre-emptive effects. See, e. g., CSX Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood, 507 U. S.658, 673, n. 12 (1993) ("We reject petitioner's claim of implied
`conflict' pre-emption . . . on the basis of the preceding anal-ysis"). At best,

Cipollone supports an inference that anexpress pre-emption clause forecloses implied pre-emption;

it does not establish a rule.

B
Petitioners' pre-emption argument is ultimately futile,however, because respondents' common-law actions do not

conflict with federal law. First, it is not impossible for peti-tioners to comply with both federal and state law because
there is simply no federal standard for a private party tocomply with. Nothing in the Safety Act or its regulations
currently regulates the use of ABS devices. As Standard121 imposes no requirements either requiring or prohibiting
ABS systems, tractor-trailer manufacturers are free to obeystate standards concerning stopping distances and vehicle
stability.Second, we cannot say that the respondents' lawsuits frustrate "the accomplishment and execution of the full purposesand objectives of Congress."

Hines, supra, at 67. In theabsence of a promulgated safety standard, the Act simply

fails to address the need for ABS devices at all. Further,Standard 121 currently has nothing to say concerning ABS
devices one way or the other, and NHTSA has not orderedtruck manufacturers to refrain from using ABS devices. A
finding of liability against petitioners would undermine no

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit is affirmed.

291OCTOBER TERM, 1994
Syllabus

HEINTZ et al. v. JENKINS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 94-367. Argued February 21, 1995--Decided April 18, 1995
Petitioner Heintz is a lawyer representing a bank that sued respondent

Jenkins to recover the balance due on her defaulted car loan. After a
letter from Heintz listed the amount Jenkins owed as including the cost
of insurance bought by the bank when she reneged on her promise to
insure the car, Jenkins brought this suit against Heintz and his law
firm under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which forbids "debt
collector[s]" to make false or misleading representations and to engage
in various abusive and unfair practices. The District Court dismissed
the suit, holding that the Act does not apply to lawyers engaging in
litigation. The Court of Appeals disagreed and reversed.

Held: The Act must be read to apply to lawyers engaged in consumer

debt-collection litigation for two rather strong reasons. First, a lawyer
who regularly tries to obtain payment of consumer debts through legal
proceedings meets the Act's definition of "debt collector": one who "regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, [consumer]
debts owed . . . another," 15 U. S. C. $ 1692a(6). Second, although an
earlier version of that definition expressly excluded "any attorney-atlaw collecting a debt as an attorney on behalf of and in the name of a
client," Congress repealed this exemption in 1986 without creating a
narrower, litigation-related, exemption to fill the void. Heintz's arguments for nonetheless inferring the latter type of exemption--(1) that
many of the Act's requirements, if applied directly to litigation activities,
will create harmfully anomalous results that Congress could not have
intended; (2) that a postenactment statement by one of the 1986 repeal's
sponsors demonstrates that, despite the removal of the earlier blanket
exemption, the Act still does not apply to lawyers' litigating activities;
and (3) that a nonbinding "Commentary" by the Federal Trade Commission's staff establishes that attorneys engaged in sending dunning letters and other traditional debt-collection activities are covered by the
Act, while those whose practice is limited to legal activities are not--
are unconvincing. Pp. 294-299.

25 F. 3d 536, affirmed.

Breyer, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
The issue before us is whether the term "debt collector"in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 91 Stat. 874, 15

U. S. C. $$ 1692-1692o (1988 ed. and Supp. V), applies to alawyer who "regularly,"

through litigation, tries to collectconsumer debts. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that it does. We agree with the Seventh Circuitand we affirm its judgment.

The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act prohibits "debt col-lector[s]" from making false or misleading representations
and from engaging in various abusive and unfair practices.The Act says, for example, that a "debt collector" may not
use violence, obscenity, or repeated annoying phone calls, 15U. S. C. $ 1692d; may not falsely represent "the character,
amount, or legal status of any debt," $ 1692e(2)(A); and maynot use various "unfair or unconscionable means to collect or
attempt to collect" a consumer debt, $ 1692f. Among otherthings, the Act sets out rules that a debt collector must
follow for "acquiring location information" about thedebtor, $ 1692b; communicating about the debtor (and the

debt) with third parties, $ 1692c(b); and bringing "[l]egal
actions," $ 1692i. The Act imposes upon "debt collector[s]"
who violate its provisions (specifically described) "[c]ivil liability" to those whom they, e. g., harass, mislead, or treat unfairly. $ 1692k. The Act also authorizes the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) to enforce its provisions. $ 1692l(a).
The Act's definition of the term "debt collector" includes
a person "who regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed [to] . . . another." $ 1692a(6).
And, it limits "debt" to consumer debt, i. e., debts "arising
out of . . . transaction[s]" that "are primarily for personal,
family, or household purposes." $ 1692a(5).

The plaintiff in this case, Darlene Jenkins, borrowed
money from the Gainer Bank in order to buy a car. She
defaulted on her loan. The bank's law firm then sued Jenkins in state court to recover the balance due. As part of
an effort to settle the suit, a lawyer with that law firm,
George Heintz, wrote to Jenkins' lawyer. His letter, in listing the amount she owed under the loan agreement, included
$4,173 owed for insurance, bought by the bank because she
had not kept the car insured as she had promised to do.

Jenkins then brought this Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act suit against Heintz and his firm. She claimed that
Heintz's letter violated the Act's prohibitions against trying to collect an amount not "authorized by the agreement
creating the debt," $ 1692f(1), and against making a "false
representation of . . . the . . . amount . . . of any debt,"

$ 1692e(2)(A). The loan agreement, she conceded, required
her to keep the car insured " `against loss or damage' " and
permitted the bank to buy such insurance to protect the car
should she fail to do so. App. to Pet. for Cert. 17. But, she
said, the $4,173 substitute policy was not the kind of policy
the loan agreement had in mind, for it insured the bank not
only against "loss or damage" but also against her failure to
repay the bank's car loan. Hence, Heintz's "representation"

Opinion of the Court
about the "amount" of her "debt" was "false"; amounted toan effort to collect an "amount" not "authorized" by the loan

agreement; and thus violated the Act.Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, the District Court dismissed Jenkins' Fair Debt
Collection lawsuit for failure to state a claim. The courtheld that the Act does not apply to lawyers engaging in litigation. However, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Cir-cuit reversed the District Court's judgment, interpreting the
Act to apply to litigating lawyers. 25 F. 3d 536 (1994). TheSeventh Circuit's view in this respect conflicts with that of
the Sixth Circuit. See Green v. Hocking, 9 F. 3d 18 (1993)
(per curiam). We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict.
513 U. S. 959 (1994). And, as we have said, we conclude that
the Seventh Circuit is correct. The Act does apply to lawyers engaged in litigation.

There are two rather strong reasons for believing that the
Act applies to the litigating activities of lawyers. First, the
Act defines the "debt collector[s]" to whom it applies as including those who "regularly collec[t] or attemp[t] to collect,
directly or indirectly, [consumer] debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another." $ 1692a(6). In ordinary
English, a lawyer who regularly tries to obtain payment of
consumer debts through legal proceedings is a lawyer who
regularly "attempts" to "collect" those consumer debts.
See, e. g., Black's Law Dictionary 263 (6th ed. 1990) ("To collect a debt or claim is to obtain payment or liquidation of it,
either by personal solicitation or legal proceedings").

Second, in 1977, Congress enacted an earlier version of
this statute, which contained an express exemption for lawyers. That exemption said that the term "debt collector"
did not include "any attorney-at-law collecting a debt as an
attorney on behalf of and in the name of a client." Pub.
L. 95-109, $ 803(6)(F), 91 Stat. 874, 875. In 1986, however,
Congress repealed this exemption in its entirety, Pub. L. 99-
361, 100 Stat. 768, without creating a narrower, litigation514us1$44q 05-27-98 15:30:01 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
related, exemption to fill the void. Without more, then, onewould think that Congress intended that lawyers be subject

to the Act whenever they meet the general "debt collector"definition.

Heintz argues that we should nonetheless read the statute
as containing an implied exemption for those debt-collectingactivities of lawyers that consist of litigating (including, he

assumes, settlement efforts). He relies primarily on threearguments.

First, Heintz argues that many of the Act's requirements,if applied directly to litigating activities, will create harmfully anomalous results that Congress simply could not have
intended. We address this argument in light of the fact
that, when Congress first wrote the Act's substantive provisions, it had for the most part exempted litigating attorneys
from the Act's coverage; that, when Congress later repealed
the attorney exemption, it did not revisit the wording of
these substantive provisions; and that, for these reasons,
some awkwardness is understandable. Particularly when
read in this light, we find Heintz's argument unconvincing.

Many of Heintz's "anomalies" are not particularly anomalous. For example, the Sixth Circuit pointed to $ 1692e(5),
which forbids a "debt collector" to make any "threat to take
action that cannot legally be taken." The court reasoned
that, were the Act to apply to litigating activities, this provision automatically would make liable any litigating lawyer
who brought, and then lost, a claim against a debtor. Green,
supra, at 21. But, the Act says explicitly that a "debt collector" may not be held liable if he "shows by a preponderance
of evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such
error." $ 1692k(c). Thus, even if we were to assume that
the suggested reading of $ 1692e(5) is correct, we would not
find the result so absurd as to warrant implying an exemption for litigating lawyers. In any event, the assumption

514us1$44q 05-27-98 15:30:01 PAGES OPINPGT
296 HEINTZ v. JENKINS

Opinion of the Court
would seem unnecessary, for we do not see how the fact thata lawsuit turns out ultimately to be unsuccessful could, by

itself, make the bringing of it an "action that cannot legallybe taken."

The remaining significant "anomalies" similarly depend
for their persuasive force upon readings that courts seemunlikely to endorse. For example, Heintz's strongest

"anomaly" argument focuses upon the Act's provisions gov-erning "[c]ommunication in connection with debt collection."

$ 1692c. One of those provisions requires a "debt collector"not to "communicate further" with a consumer who "notifies"
the "debt collector" that he or she "refuses to pay" or wishes
the debt collector to "cease further communication."

$ 1692c(c). In light of this provision, asks Heintz, how can
an attorney file a lawsuit against (and thereby communicate
with) a nonconsenting consumer or file a motion for summary
judgment against that consumer?

We agree with Heintz that it would be odd if the Act empowered a debt-owing consumer to stop the "communications" inherent in an ordinary lawsuit and thereby cause an
ordinary debt-collecting lawsuit to grind to a halt. But, it
is not necessary to read $ 1692c(c) in that way--if only because that provision has exceptions that permit communications "to notify the consumer that the debt collector or
creditor may invoke" or "intends to invoke" a "specified remedy" (of a kind "ordinarily invoked by [the] debt collector
or creditor"). $$ 1692c(c)(2), (3). Courts can read these exceptions, plausibly, to imply that they authorize the actual
invocation of the remedy that the collector "intends to
invoke." The language permits such a reading, for an ordinary court-related document does, in fact, "notify" its recipient that the creditor may "invoke" a judicial remedy. Moreover, the interpretation is consistent with the statute's
apparent objective of preserving creditors' judicial remedies.
We need not authoritatively interpret the Act's conductregulating provisions now, however. Rather, we rest our

297Cite as: 514 U. S. 291 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
conclusions upon the fact that it is easier to read $ 1692c(c)as containing some such additional, implicit, exception than

to believe that Congress intended, silently and implicitly, tocreate a far broader exception, for all litigating attorneys,
from the Act itself.

Second, Heintz points to a statement of CongressmanFrank Annunzio, one of the sponsors of the 1986 amendment

that removed from the Act the language creating a blanketexemption for lawyers. Representative Annunzio stated
that, despite the exemption's removal, the Act still wouldnot apply to lawyers' litigating activities. Representative
Annunzio said that the Act

"regulates debt collection, not the practice of law. Congress repealed the attorney exemption to the act, notbecause of attorney[s'] conduct in the courtroom, but because of their conduct in the backroom. Only collectionactivities, not legal activities, are covered by the act. . . .
The act applies to attorneys when they are collecting
debts, not when they are performing tasks of a legalnature. . . . The act only regulates the conduct of debt

collectors, it does not prevent creditors, through theirattorneys, from pursuing any legal remedies available to
them." 132 Cong. Rec. 30842 (1986).
This statement, however, does not persuade us.

For one thing, the plain language of the Act itself saysnothing about retaining the exemption in respect to litigation. The line the statement seeks to draw between "legal"activities and "debt collection" activities was not necessarily
apparent to those who debated the legislation, for litigating,
at first blush, seems simply one way of collecting a debt.
For another thing, when Congress considered the Act, other
Congressmen expressed fear that repeal would limit lawyers'
"ability to contact third parties in order to facilitate settlements" and "could very easily interfere with a client's right
to pursue judicial remedies." H. R. Rep. No. 99-405, p. 11

not during the legislative process, but after the statute became law. It therefore is not a statement upon which otherlegislators might have relied in voting for or against the Act,

but it simply represents the views of one informed personon an issue about which others may (or may not) have
thought differently.

Finally, Heintz points to a "Commentary" on the Act by
the FTC's staff. It says:

"Attorneys or law firms that engage in traditional debt
collection activities (sending dunning letters, makingcollection calls to consumers) are covered by the [Act],

but those whose practice is limited to legal activities
are not covered." Federal Trade Commission--Statements of General Policy or Interpretation Staff Commentary on the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 53Fed. Reg. 50097, 50100 (1988) (emphasis added; footnote

omitted).
We cannot give conclusive weight to this statement. TheCommentary of which this statement is a part says that it

"is not binding on the Commission or the public." Id., at
50101. More importantly, we find nothing either in the Actor elsewhere indicating that Congress intended to authorize

the FTC to create this exception from the Act's coverage--an exception that, for the reasons we have set forth above,
falls outside the range of reasonable interpretations of the
Act's express language. See, e. g., Brown v. Gardner, 513
U. S. 115, 120-122 (1994); see also Fox v. Citicorp Credit
Servs., Inc., 15 F. 3d 1507, 1513 (CA9 1994) (FTC staff 's
statement conflicts with Act's plain language and is therefore
not entitled to deference); Scott v. Jones, 964 F. 2d 314, 317

CELOTEX CORP. v. EDWARDS et ux.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 93-1504. Argued December 6, 1994--Decided April 19, 1995
The United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas entered a judgment in favor of respondents and against petitioner Celotex
Corp. To stay execution of the judgment pending appeal, petitioner
posted a supersedeas bond, with an insurance company (Northbrook)
serving as surety. After the Fifth Circuit affirmed the judgment, Celotex filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the Bankruptcy Court for the
Middle District of Florida. Exercising its equitable powers under 11
U. S. C. $ 105(a), the Bankruptcy Court issued an injunction, which, in
pertinent part, prohibited judgment creditors from proceeding against
sureties without the Bankruptcy Court's permission. Respondents
thereafter filed a motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
65.1 in the Northern District of Texas seeking permission to execute
against Northbrook on the bond. The District Court granted the motion. The Fifth Circuit affirmed and later denied Celotex's petition for
rehearing, rejecting the argument that its decision allowed a collateral
attack on the Bankruptcy Court order.

Held: Respondents must obey the Bankruptcy Court's injunction. The

well-established rule that "persons subject to an injunctive order issued
by a court with jurisdiction are expected to obey that decree until it is
modified or reversed, even if they have proper grounds to object to the
order," GTE Sylvania, Inc. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc.,
445 U. S. 375, 386, applies to bankruptcy cases, Oriel v. Russell, 278
U. S. 358. A bankruptcy court has jurisdiction over proceedings "arising under," "arising in," or "related to" a Chapter 11 case. 28 U. S. C.

$$ 1334(b) and 157(a). The "related to" language must be read to grant
jurisdiction over more than simply proceedings involving the debtor's
property or the estate. Respondents' immediate execution on the bond
is at least a question "related to" Celotex's bankruptcy. While the proceeding against Northbrook does not directly involve Celotex, the Bankruptcy Court found that allowing respondents and other bonded judgment creditors to execute immediately on the bonds would have a direct
and substantial adverse effect on Celotex's ability to undergo a successful
Chapter 11 reorganization. The fact that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65.1 provides an expedited procedure for executing on supersedeas
bonds does not mean that such a procedure cannot be stayed by a law514us2$45z 05-27-98 16:00:19 PAGES OPINPGT

Since it is for the court of first instance to determine the question of
the validity of the law, and since its orders are to be respected until its
decision is reversed, respondents should have challenged the injunction
in the Bankruptcy Court rather than collaterally attacking the injunction in the Texas federal courts. Pp. 306-313.

Opinion of the Court
from executing on the bond without the Bankruptcy Court'spermission. We hold that respondents were obligated to

obey the injunction issued by the Bankruptcy Court.

I
In 1987 respondents Bennie and Joann Edwards filed suitin the United States District Court for the Northern District

of Texas against petitioner Celotex Corporation (and others)alleging asbestos-related injuries. In April 1989 the District Court entered a $281,025.80 judgment in favor of re-spondents and against Celotex. To stay execution of the
judgment pending appeal, Celotex posted a supersedeasbond in the amount of $294,987.88, with Northbrook Property and Casualty Insurance Company serving as suretyon the bond. As collateral for the bond, Celotex allowed
Northbrook to retain money owed to Celotex under a settle-ment agreement resolving insurance coverage disputes between Northbrook and Celotex.The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
affirmed, issuing its mandate on October 12, 1990, and thusrendering "final" respondents' judgment against Celotex.
Edwards v. Armstrong World Industries, Inc., 911 F. 2d1151 (1990). That same day, Celotex filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code inthe United States Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District
of Florida.1 The filing of the petition automatically stayedboth the continuation of "proceeding[s] against" Celotex and
the commencement of "any act to obtain possession of prop-erty" of Celotex.

2 11 U. S. C. $$ 362(a)(1) and (3).

1 For purposes of this case, we assume respondents' judgment became
final before Celotex filed its petition in bankruptcy.

2 As of the filing date, more than 141,000 asbestos-related bodily injury

lawsuits were pending against Celotex, and over 100 asbestos-related
bodily injury cases were in some stage of appeal, with judgments totaling
nearly $70 million being stayed by supersedeas bonds that Celotex had
posted.

Opinion of the Court
On October 17, 1990, the Bankruptcy Court exercised itsequitable powers under 11 U. S. C. $ 105(a) and issued an injunction (hereinafter Section 105 Injunction) to augment theprotection afforded Celotex by the automatic stay. In pertinent part, the Section 105 Injunction stayed all proceedings
involving Celotex "regardless of . . . whether the matter ison appeal and a supersedeas bond has been posted by [Celotex]." App. to Pet. for Cert. A-28.3 Respondents, whosebonded judgment against Celotex had already been affirmed
on appeal, filed a motion pursuant to Federal Rule of CivilProcedure 65.1 in the District Court seeking permission to
execute against Northbrook on the supersedeas bond. Both
Celotex and Northbrook opposed this motion, asserting that
all proceedings to enforce the bonds had been enjoined by
the Bankruptcy Court's Section 105 Injunction. Celotex
brought to the District Court's attention the fact that, since
respondents had filed their Rule 65.1 motion, the Bankruptcy
Court had reaffirmed the Section 105 Injunction and made
clear that the injunction prohibited judgment creditors like
respondents from proceeding against sureties without the
Bankruptcy Court's permission:

"Where at the time of filing the petition, the appellate
process between Debtor and the judgment creditor had
been concluded, the judgment creditor is precluded from
proceeding against any supersedeas bond posted by
Debtor without first seeking to vacate the Section 105

3 The Bankruptcy Court noted that, upon request of a party in interest
and following 30 days' written notice and a hearing, it would "consider
granting relief from the restraints imposed" by the Section 105 Injunction.
App. to Pet. for Cert. A-28. Several of Celotex's bonded judgment creditors whose cases were still on appeal filed motions requesting that the
Bankruptcy Court lift the Section 105 Injunction (1) to enable their pending appellate actions to proceed and (2) to permit them to execute upon
the bonds once the appellate process concluded in their favor. The Bankruptcy Court granted the first request but denied the second. In re Celotex, 128 B. R. 478, 484 (1991) (Celotex I).

Opinion of the Court
stay entered by this Court." In re Celotex, 128 B. R.478, 485 (1991) (Celotex I).

Despite the Bankruptcy Court's reaffirmation and clarifica-tion of the Section 105 Injunction, the District Court allowed
respondents to execute on the bond against Northbrook.4

4 Two days after the District Court entered its order, the Bankruptcy
Court ruled on motions to lift the Section 105 Injunction that had been
filed by several bonded judgment creditors who, like respondents, had prevailed against Celotex on appeal. The Bankruptcy Court again reaffirmed the Section 105 Injunction and it again explained that the injunction prohibited judgment creditors like respondents from executing on the
supersedeas bonds against third parties without its permission. In re
Celotex, 140 B. R. 912, 914 (1992) (Celotex II). It refused to lift the Section 105 Injunction at that time, finding that Celotex would suffer irreparable harm. It reasoned that if the judgment creditors were allowed to
execute against the sureties on the supersedeas bonds, the sureties would
in turn seek to lift the Section 105 Injunction to reach Celotex's collateral
under the settlement agreements, possibly destroying any chance of a successful reorganization plan. See id., at 914-915.

To protect the bonded judgment creditors, the Bankruptcy Court ordered that: (1) the sureties involved, including Northbrook, establish escrow accounts sufficient to insure full payment of the bonds; (2) Celotex
create an interest-bearing reserve account or increase the face amount
of any supersedeas bond to cover the full amount of judgment through
confirmation; and (3) Celotex provide in any plan that the bonded claimants' claims be paid in full unless otherwise determined by the court or
agreed by the claimant. Id., at 917. The Bankruptcy Court also directed
Celotex to file "any preference action or any fraudulent transfer action or
any other action to avoid or subordinate any judgment creditor's claim
against any judgment creditor or against any surety on any supersedeas
bond within 60 days of the entry" of its order. Ibid. Accordingly, Celotex filed an adversary proceeding against respondents, 227 other similarly
situated bonded judgment creditors in over 100 cases, and the sureties
on the supersedeas bonds, including Northbrook. See Second Amended
Complaint in Celotex Corp. v. Allstate Ins. Co., Adversary No. 92-584
(Bkrtcy. Ct. MD Fla.). In that proceeding, Celotex asserts that the
bonded judgment creditors should not be able to execute on their bonds
because, by virtue of the collateralization of the bonds, the bonded judgment creditors are beneficiaries of Celotex asset transfers that are voidable as preferences and fraudulent transfers. See ibid. Celotex also

Opinion of the Court
Celotex appealed, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed. Ed-wards v. Armstrong World Industries, Inc., 6 F. 3d 312

(1993) (Edwards II). It first held that, because the appel-late process for which the supersedeas bond was posted had
been completed, Celotex no longer had a property interestin the bond and the automatic stay provisions of 11 U. S. C.

$ 362 therefore did not prevent respondents from executingagainst Northbrook. 6 F. 3d, at 315-317. The court then
acknowledged that "[t]he jurisdiction of bankruptcy courtshas been extended to include stays on proceedings involving
third parties under the auspices of 28 U. S. C. $ 1334(b)," id.,at 318, and that the Bankruptcy Court itself had ruled that
the Section 105 Injunction enjoined respondents' proceedingagainst Northbrook to execute on the supersedeas bond.
Ibid. The Fifth Circuit nevertheless disagreed with themerits of the Bankruptcy Court's Section 105 Injunction,
holding that "the integrity of the estate is not implicated inthe present case because the debtor has no present or future
interest in this supersedeas bond." Id., at 320. The courtreasoned that the Section 105 Injunction was "manifestly unfair" and an "unjust result" because the supersedeas bondwas posted "to cover precisely the type of eventuality which
occurred in this case, insolvency of the judgment debtor."
Id., at 319. In concluding that the Section 105 Injunctionwas improper, the Fifth Circuit expressly disagreed with the

reasoning and result of Willis v. Celotex Corp., 978 F. 2d 146(1992), cert. denied, 507 U. S. 1030 (1993), where the Court
of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, examining the same Sec-tion 105 Injunction, held that the Bankruptcy Court had the
power under 11 U. S. C. $ 105(a) to stay proceedings againstsureties on the supersedeas bonds. 6 F. 3d, at 320.

Celotex filed a petition for rehearing, arguing that theFifth Circuit's decision allowed a collateral attack on an

Circuit denied the petition, stating in part that "we have notheld that the bankruptcy court in Florida was necessarily

Id., at321. Because of the conflict between the Fifth Circuit's

Respondents acknowledge that the Bankruptcy Court'sSection 105 Injunction prohibited them from attempting to
execute against Northbrook on the supersedeas bond postedby Celotex. Brief in Opposition 6, n. 2 (recognizing that the
Section 105 Injunction "was intended to, and did, enjoin col-lection attempts like those made by [respondents] against
Northbrook in this case"). In GTE Sylvania, Inc. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 445 U. S. 375, 386(1980), we reaffirmed the well-established rule that "persons

subject to an injunctive order issued by a court with jurisdic-tion are expected to obey that decree until it is modified or
reversed, even if they have proper grounds to object to theorder." In

GTE Sylvania, we went on to say:

"There is no doubt that the Federal District Court inDelaware had jurisdiction to issue the temporary restraining orders and preliminary and permanent injunc-tions. Nor were those equitable decrees challenged as
only a frivolous pretense to validity, although of coursethere is disagreement over whether the District Court
erred in issuing the permanent injunction. Underthese circumstances, the CPSC was required to obey the
injunctions out of respect for judicial process." Id., at386-387 (internal quotation marks, citations, and footnote omitted).

Opinion of the Court
This rule was applied in the bankruptcy context more than60 years ago in

Oriel v. Russell, 278 U. S. 358 (1929), where
the Court held that turnover orders issued under the oldbankruptcy regime could not be collaterally attacked in a

later contempt proceeding. Respondents acknowledge the
validity of the rule but contend that it has no applicationhere. They argue that the Bankruptcy Court lacked

jurisdiction to issue the Section 105 Injunction, though much oftheir argument goes to the correctness of the Bankruptcy

Court's decision to issue the injunction rather than to itsjurisdiction to do so.

The jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts, like that ofother federal courts, is grounded in, and limited by, statute.
Title 28 U. S. C. $ 1334(b) provides that "the district courts
shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civilproceedings arising under title 11, or arising in or related to

cases under title 11." The district courts may, in turn, refer"any or all proceedings arising under title 11 or arising in or
related to a case under title 11 . . . to the bankruptcy judgesfor the district." 28 U. S. C. $ 157(a). Here, the Bankruptcy Court's jurisdiction to enjoin respondents' proceedingagainst Northbrook must be based on the "arising under,"
"arising in," or "related to" language of $$ 1334(b) and 157(a).

Respondents argue that the Bankruptcy Court had juris-diction to issue the Section 105 Injunction only if their proceeding to execute on the bond was "related to" the Celotexbankruptcy. Petitioner argues the Bankruptcy Court indeed had such "related to" jurisdiction. Congress did not
delineate the scope of "related to" 5 jurisdiction, but its choice

5 Proceedings "related to" the bankruptcy include (1) causes of action
owned by the debtor which become property of the estate pursuant to 11
U. S. C. $ 541, and (2) suits between third parties which have an effect on
the bankruptcy estate. See 1 Collier on Bankruptcy || 3.01[1][c][iv],
p. 3-28 (15th ed. 1994). The first type of "related to" proceeding involves
a claim like the state-law breach of contract action at issue in Northern

308 CELOTEX CORP. v. EDWARDS

Opinion of the Court
of words suggests a grant of some breadth. The jurisdic-tional grant in $ 1334(b) was a distinct departure from the

jurisdiction conferred under previous Acts, which had beenlimited to either possession of property by the debtor or consent as a basis for jurisdiction. See S. Rep. No. 95-989,pp. 153-154 (1978). We agree with the views expressed by
the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Pacor, Inc. v.
Higgins, 743 F. 2d 984 (1984), that "Congress intended togrant comprehensive jurisdiction to the bankruptcy courts

so that they might deal efficiently and expeditiously with allmatters connected with the bankruptcy estate," id., at 994;
see also H. R. Rep. No. 95-595, pp. 43-48 (1977), and thatthe "related to" language of $ 1334(b) must be read to give
district courts (and bankruptcy courts under $ 157(a)) juris-diction over more than simply proceedings involving the
property of the debtor or the estate. We also agree withthat court's observation that a bankruptcy court's "related
to" jurisdiction cannot be limitless. See Pacor, supra, at994; cf.

Board of Governors, FRS v. MCorp Financial, Inc.,502 U. S. 32, 40 (1991) (stating that Congress has vested "limited authority" in bankruptcy courts).6

Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50 (1982). The
instant case involves the second type of "related to" proceeding.

6 In attempting to strike an appropriate balance, the Third Circuit in

Pacor, Inc. v. Higgins, 743 F. 2d 984 (1984), devised the following test for
determining the existence of "related to" jurisdiction:

"The usual articulation of the test for determining whether a civil proceeding is related to bankruptcy is whether the outcome of that proceeding
could conceivably have any effect on the estate being administered in
bankruptcy. . . . Thus, the proceeding need not necessarily be against the
debtor or against the debtor's property. An action is related to bankruptcy if the outcome could alter the debtor's rights, liabilities, options, or
freedom of action (either positively or negatively) and which in any way
impacts upon the handling and administration of the bankrupt estate."
Id., at 994 (emphasis in original; citations omitted).

The First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits have adopted the Pacor test with little or no variation. See In re
G. S. F. Corp., 938 F. 2d 1467, 1475 (CA1 1991); A. H. Robins Co. v. Pic514us2$45h 05-27-98 16:00:20 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
We believe that the issue whether respondents are entitled
to immediate execution on the bond against Northbrook is at
least a question "related to" Celotex's bankruptcy.7 Admittedly, a proceeding by respondents against Northbrook on
the supersedeas bond does not directly involve Celotex, except to satisfy the judgment against it secured by the bond.
But to induce Northbrook to serve as surety on the bond,

Inc., 910 F. 2d 784, 788, and n. 19 (CA11 1990). The Second and Seventh
Circuits, on the other hand, seem to have adopted a slightly different test.
See In re Turner, 724 F. 2d 338, 341 (CA2 1983); In re Xonics, Inc., 813
F. 2d 127, 131 (CA7 1987); Home Ins. Co. v. Cooper & Cooper, Ltd., 889
F. 2d 746, 749 (CA7 1989). But whatever test is used, these cases make
clear that bankruptcy courts have no jurisdiction over proceedings that
have no effect on the estate of the debtor.

7 The dissent agrees that respondents' proceeding to execute on the supersedeas bond is "related to" Celotex's bankruptcy, post, at 318, n. 5, but
noting that "only the district court has the power [under 28 U. S. C.

$ 157(c)(1)] to enter `any final order or judgment' " in related "[n]on-core
proceedings," post, at 321-322, the dissent concludes that the Bankruptcy
Court here did not possess sufficient "related to" jurisdiction to issue the
Section 105 Injunction, post, at 322. The Section 105 Injunction, however,
is only an interlocutory stay which respondents have yet to challenge.
See infra, at 313. Thus, the Bankruptcy Court did not lack jurisdiction
under $ 157(c)(1) to issue the Section 105 Injunction because that injunction was not a "final order or judgment."

In any event, respondents have waived any claim that the granting of
the Section 105 Injunction was a noncore proceeding under $ 157(c)(1).
Respondents base their arguments solely on 28 U. S. C. $ 1334, and concede
in their brief that the "bankruptcy court had subject matter jurisdiction
to issue orders affecting the bond, then, only if the proceedings on the
bond were `related' to the Celotex bankruptcy itself within the meaning
of $ 1334(b)." Brief for Respondents 22. We conclude, and the dissent
agrees, that those proceedings are so related. See post, at 317-318, and
n. 5. We thus need not (and do not) reach the question whether the granting of the Section 105 Injunction was a "core" proceeding.

310 CELOTEX CORP. v. EDWARDS

Opinion of the Court
Celotex agreed to allow Northbrook to retain the proceeds ofa settlement resolving insurance coverage disputes between

Northbrook and Celotex. The Bankruptcy Court found thatallowing respondents--and 227 other bonded judgment creditors--to execute immediately on the bonds would have a
direct and substantial adverse effect on Celotex's ability toundergo a successful reorganization. It stated:

"[I]f the Section 105 stay were lifted to enable the judgment creditors to reach the sureties, the sureties in turnwould seek to lift the Section 105 stay to reach Debtor's

collateral, with corresponding actions by Debtor to preserve its rights under the settlement agreements. Sucha scenario could completely destroy any chance of resolving the prolonged insurance coverage disputes cur-rently being adjudicated in this Court. The settlement
of the insurance coverage disputes with all of Debtor'sinsurers may well be the linchpin of Debtor's formulation of a feasible plan. Absent the confirmation of a feasible plan, Debtor may be liquidated or cease to existafter a carrion feast by the victors in a race to the courthouse." In re Celotex, 140 B. R. 912, 915 (1992) (Celotex II).

In light of these findings by the Bankruptcy Court, it is
relevant to note that we are dealing here with a reorganization under Chapter 11, rather than a liquidation under Chap-ter 7. The jurisdiction of bankruptcy courts may extend

more broadly in the former case than in the latter. Cf. Continental Ill. Nat. Bank & Trust Co. v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R.
Co., 294 U. S. 648, 676 (1935). And we think our holding--
that respondents' immediate execution on the supersedeas
bond is at least "related to" the Celotex bankruptcy--is in
accord with representative recent decisions of the Courts of
Appeals. See, e. g., American Hardwoods, Inc. v. Deutsche
Credit Corp., 885 F. 2d 621, 623 (CA9 1989) (finding "related
to" jurisdiction where enforcement of state-court judgment

Respondents, relying on our decision in Board of Gover-nors, FRS v. MCorp Financial, Inc., 502 U.

In

MCorp, we held that thegrant of jurisdiction in $ 1334(b) to district courts sitting in

bankruptcy did not authorize an injunction against a regula-tory proceeding, but there we relied on "the specific preclusive language" of 12 U. S. C. $ 1818(i)(1), which stated that" `no court shall have jurisdiction to affect by injunction or
otherwise the issuance or enforcement of any [Board] noticeor order.' " 502 U. S., at 39, 42. There is no analogous
statutory prohibition against enjoining the maintenanceof a proceeding under Rule 65.1. That Rule provides:

proceeding to execute on the bond in the Fifth Circuit and the $ 105 stay

argue, technically, that though the proceeding to execute on the bond is
"related to" the Title 11 case, the stay proceeding "arises under" Title 11,
or "arises in" the Title 11 case. See In re Monroe Well Serv., Inc., 67

Opinion of the Court
of a bond or stipulation or other undertaking with oneor more sureties, each surety submits to the jurisdiction

of the court and irrevocably appoints the clerk of thecourt as the surety's agent upon whom any papers affecting the surety's liability on the bond or undertakingmay be served. The surety's liability may be enforced
on motion without the necessity of an independentaction. . . ."

This Rule outlines a streamlined procedure for executing onbonds. It assures judgment creditors like respondents that
they do not have to bring a separate action against sureties,and instead allows them to collect on the supersedeas bond
by merely filing a motion. Just because the Rule providesa simplified procedure for collecting on a bond, however, does
not mean that such a procedure, like the more complicatedprocedure of a full-fledged lawsuit, cannot be stayed by a
lawfully entered injunction.Much of our discussion dealing with the jurisdiction of

the Bankruptcy Court under the "related to" language of$$ 1334(b) and 157(a) is likewise applicable in determining
whether or not the Bankruptcy Court's Section 105 Injunc-tion has "only a frivolous pretense to validity." GTE Sylvania, 445 U. S., at 386 (internal quotation marks and cita-tion omitted). The Fourth Circuit has upheld the merits of
the Bankruptcy Court's Section 105 Injunction, see Willis,978 F. 2d, at 149-150, and even the Fifth Circuit in this case
did not find "that the bankruptcy court in Florida was neces-sarily wrong." See

Edwards II, 6 F. 3d, at 321. But weneed not, and do not, address whether the Bankruptcy Court

acted properly in issuing the Section 105 Injunction.9

9 The dissent contends that Celotex's attempts to set aside the supersedeas bond are "patently meritless" because none of Celotex's claims can
impair Northbrook's obligation to respondents. See post, at 325. That
premise, however, is not so clear as to give the Section 105 Injunction
"only a frivolous pretense to validity." There is authority suggesting
that, in certain circumstances, transfers from the debtor to another for

We have made clear that " `[i]t is for the court of first in-stance to determine the question of the validity of the law,

and until its decision is reversed for error by orderly review,either by itself or by a higher court, its orders based on its
decision are to be respected.' " Walker v. Birmingham, 388U. S. 307, 314 (1967) (quoting

Howat v. Kansas, 258 U. S. 181,189-190 (1922)). If respondents believed the Section 105

Injunction was improper, they should have challenged it inthe Bankruptcy Court, like other similarly situated bonded
judgment creditors have done. See Celotex II, 140 B. R.,at 912. If dissatisfied with the Bankruptcy Court's ultimate
decision, respondents can appeal "to the district court forthe judicial district in which the bankruptcy judge is serving," see 28 U. S. C. $ 158(a), and then to the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, see $ 158(d). Respondentschose not to pursue this course of action, but instead to

collaterally attack the Bankruptcy Court's Section 105 In-junction in the federal courts in Texas. This they cannot be
permitted to do without seriously undercutting the orderlyprocess of the law.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals, accordingly, is
reversed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,
dissenting.

Today the majority holds that an Article III court erred
when it allowed plaintiffs who prevailed on appeal to collecton a supersedeas bond in the face of an injunction issued by

a non-Article III judge. Because, in my view, the majority
the benefit of a third party may be recovered from that third party. See
In re Air Conditioning, Inc. of Stuart, 845 F. 2d 293, 296-299 (CA11),

(1987), modified on other grounds, 835 F. 2d 584 (CA5 1988). Although
we offer no opinion on the merits of that authority or on whether it fits
the facts here, it supports our conclusion that the stay was not frivolous.

314 CELOTEX CORP. v. EDWARDS

Stevens, J., dissenting
attaches insufficient weight to the fact that the challengedinjunction was issued by a non-Article III judge, I respectfully dissent. I

The outlines of the problems I perceive are best drawn bystarting with an examination of the injunctions and opinions
issued by the Bankruptcy Judge in this case. As the major-ity notes, Bennie and Joann Edwards (the Edwards) won a
tort judgment against Celotex Corporation for damages Ben-nie Edwards suffered as a result of exposure to asbestos.
To stay the judgment pending appeal, Celotex arranged forNorthbrook Property and Casualty Insurance Company
(Northbrook) to post a supersedeas bond to cover the fullamount of the judgment. On October 12, 1990, before Celotex filed its voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the Bank-ruptcy Code, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
affirmed the Edwards' judgment against Celotex. It isundisputed that, when the Edwards' judgment was affirmed,
any property interest that Celotex retained in the superse-deas bond was extinguished.

The filing of Celotex's bankruptcy petition on October 12,1990, triggered the automatic stay provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. See 11 U. S. C. $ 362(a). On October 17, 1990,the Bankruptcy Judge, acting pursuant to 11 U. S. C. $ 105(a),

1

supplemented the automatic stay provisions with an emer-gency order staying, inter alia, all proceedings "involving

any of the Debtors [i. e., Celotex]." App. to Pet. for Cert.A-28. The supersedeas bond filed in the Edwards' case,
however, evidences an independent obligation on the part of

1 Title 11 U. S. C. $ 105(a) provides:
"The court may issue any order, process, or judgment that is necessary
or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title. No provision of
this title providing for the raising of an issue by a party in interest shall
be construed to preclude the court from, sua sponte, taking any action or
making any determination necessary or appropriate to enforce or implement court orders or rules, or to prevent an abuse of process."

Northbrook. For that reason, neither the automatic stay
of proceedings against the debtor pursuant to $ 362(a) of
the Bankruptcy Code nor the Bankruptcy Judge's October
17, $ 105(a) stay restrained the Edwards from proceeding against Northbrook to enforce Northbrook's obligations
under the bond. As the Court of Appeals correctly held,
the October 17 order enjoined the prosecution of proceedings
involving "the Debtors," but did not expressly enjoin the Edwards from proceeding against Northbrook. See Edwards
v. Armstrong World Industries, Inc., 6 F. 3d 312, 315 (CA5
1993).

On May 3, 1991, the Edwards commenced their proceeding
against Northbrook by filing a motion pursuant to Rule 65.1
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 2 to enforce the supersedeas bond. Several weeks later--on June 13, 1991--
the Bankruptcy Court entered a new three-paragraph order
enjoining all of Celotex's judgment creditors from collecting
on their supersedeas bonds. Paragraph 1 of the order addressed creditors whose appellate process had not yet concluded. Paragraph 2 addressed creditors whose appellate
process concluded only after Celotex had filed for bankruptcy. Paragraph 3 applied to judgment creditors, such as
the Edwards, whose appeals had concluded before the filing
of the bankruptcy petition. Paragraph 3 expressly precluded those creditors from proceeding against any bond
"without first seeking to vacate the Section 105 stay entered
by this Court." In re Celotex Corp., 128 B. R. 478, 485
(Bkrtcy. Ct. MD Fla. 1991).

2 Rule 65.1 states:
"Whenever these rules . . . require or permit the giving of security by
a party, and security is given in the form of a bond or stipulation or other
undertaking with one or more sureties, each surety submits to the jurisdiction of the court and irrevocably appoints the clerk of the court as the
surety's agent upon whom any papers affecting the surety's liability on
the bond or undertaking may be served. The surety's liability may be
enforced on motion without the necessity of an independent action."

316 CELOTEX CORP. v. EDWARDS

Stevens, J., dissenting
The opinion supporting that order explained that Para-graphs 1 and 2 rested in part on the theory that the debtor

retains a property interest in the supersedeas bonds untilthe appellate process was complete, and any attempt to collect on those bonds was therefore covered in the first instance by $ 362(a)'s automatic stay provisions. The opinionrecognized that that rationale did not cover supersedeas

bonds posted in litigation with judgment creditors, such asthe Edwards, whose appellate process was complete. The
Bankruptcy Judge concluded, however, that $ 105(a) gavehim the power to stay the collection efforts of such bonded
judgment creditors. The Bankruptcy Judge contended that
other courts had utilized the $ 105(a) stay "to preclude actions which may `impede the reorganization process,' " id.,
at 483, quoting In re Johns-Manville Corp., 837 F. 2d 89,
93 (CA2), cert. denied, 488 U. S. 868 (1988), or " `which will
have an adverse impact on the Debtor's ability to formulate
a Chapter 11 plan,' " 128 B. R., at 483, quoting A. H. Robins
Co. v. Piccinin, 788 F. 2d 994 (CA4), cert. denied, 479 U. S.
876 (1986). But cf. n. 12, infra. Apparently viewing his
own authority as virtually limitless, the Bankruptcy Judge
described a general bankruptcy power "to stop ongoing litigation and to prevent peripheral court decisions from dealing
with issues . . . without first allowing the bankruptcy court
to have an opportunity to review the potential effect on the
debtor." 128 B. R., at 484. He concluded that in "mega"
cases in which "potential conflicts with other judicial determinations" might arise, "the powers of the bankruptcy court
under Section 105 must in the initial stage be absolute."
Ibid.

I do not agree that the powers of a bankruptcy judge, a
non-Article III judge, "must . . . be absolute" at the initial
stage or indeed at any stage. Instead, the jurisdiction and
the power of bankruptcy judges are cabined by specific and
important statutory and constitutional constraints that operate at every phase of a bankruptcy. In my view, those con514us2$45i 05-27-98 16:00:20 PAGES OPINPGT

straints require that the judgment of the Court of Appeals
be affirmed.

The majority concludes that the Court of Appeals must be
reversed because the Bankruptcy Judge had jurisdiction to
issue the injunction and because the injunction had more
than a " `frivolous pretense to validity.' " Ante, at 312.
Even applying the majority's framework, I would affirm the
Court of Appeals. As I will demonstrate, the constraints on
the jurisdiction and authority of the Bankruptcy Judge compel the conclusion that the Bankruptcy Judge lacked jurisdiction to issue the challenged injunction, and that the injunction has only a " `frivolous pretense to validity.' " I will also
explain, however, why the majority's deferential approach
seems particularly inappropriate as applied to this particular
injunction, now in its fifth year of preventing enforcement of
supersedeas bonds lodged in an Article III court.

II
In my view, the Bankruptcy Judge lacked jurisdiction to
issue an injunction that prevents an Article III court from
allowing a judgment creditor to collect on a supersedeas
bond posted in that court by a nondebtor. In reaching the
contrary conclusion, the majority relies primarily on the
Bankruptcy Judge's "related to" jurisdiction, and thus I will
address that basis of jurisdiction first. The majority properly observes that, under 28 U. S. C. $ 1334(b), the district
court has broad bankruptcy jurisdiction, extending to "all
civil proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in or related to cases under title 11." 3 The majority also notes cor3 The full text of $ 1334 reads as follows:
"(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the district
courts shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction of all cases under
title 11.

"(b) Notwithstanding any Act of Congress that confers exclusive jurisdiction on a court or courts other than the district courts, the dis514us2$45i 05-27-98 16:00:20 PAGES OPINPGT

rectly that the Edwards' action to enforce the supersedeasbond is within the district court's "related to" jurisdiction,

4

because allowing creditors such as the Edwards "to executeimmediately on the bonds would have a direct and substantial adverse effect on Celotex's ability to undergo a success-ful reorganization."

Ante, at 310.5 The majority then obtrict courts shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil
proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in or related to cases under
title 11.

"(c)(1) Nothing in this section prevents a district court in the interest
of justice, or in the interest of comity with State courts or respect for
State law, from abstaining from hearing a particular proceeding arising
under title 11 or arising in or related to a case under title 11.

"(2) Upon timely motion of a party in a proceeding based upon a State
law claim or State law cause of action, related to a case under title 11 but
not arising under title 11 or arising in a case under title 11, with respect
to which an action could not have been commenced in a court of the United
States absent jurisdiction under this section, the district court shall abstain from hearing such proceeding if an action is commenced, and can
be timely adjudicated, in a State forum of appropriate jurisdiction. Any
decision to abstain or not to abstain made under this subsection is not
reviewable by appeal or otherwise by the court of appeals under section
158(d), 1291, or 1292 of this title or by the Supreme Court of the United
States under section 1254 of this title. This subsection shall not be construed to limit the applicability of the stay provided for by section 362 of
title 11, United States Code, as such section applies to an action affecting
the property of the estate in bankruptcy.

"(d) The district court in which a case under title 11 is commenced or is
pending shall have exclusive jurisdiction of all of the property, wherever
located, of the debtor as of the commencement of such case, and of property of the estate." 28 U. S. C. $ 1334 (1988 ed. and Supp. V).

4 As $ 1334(b) indicates, the district court's "related to" jurisdiction is

"original but not exclusive."

5 I do not take issue with the conclusion that the Edwards' attempt to

collect on the supersedeas bond falls within the "related to" jurisdiction
of the district court. Cf. 1 Collier on Bankruptcy || 3.01[1][c][iv], p. 3-29
(15th ed. 1994) (hereinafter Collier) (" `Related' proceedings which involve
litigation between third parties, which could have some effect on the administration of the bankruptcy case, are illustrated by suits by creditors
against guarantors"). Despite the Edwards' argument to the contrary, it
seems to me quite clear that allowing the Edwards to recover from North514us2$45i 05-27-98 16:00:20 PAGES OPINPGT

serves that, under 28 U. S. C. $ 157(a), the district court may"refe[r]" to the bankruptcy judge "any or all cases under title

11 and any or all proceedings arising under title 11 or arisingin or related to a case under title 11."

6 Thus, the majority

concludes that, because the Edwards' action to enforce the

brook on the supersedeas bond would have an adverse impact on Celotex
because Northbrook would then be able to retain the insurance proceeds
that Celotex pledged as collateral when the bond was issued. Indeed, I
am willing to assume that if all of the bonds were enforced, the reorganization efforts would fail and Celotex would have to be liquidated. In my
judgment, however, the specter of liquidation is not an acceptable basis
for concluding that a bankruptcy judge, and not just the district court,
has jurisdiction to interfere with the performance of a third party's fixed
obligation to a judgment creditor.

I also agree with the majority, ante, at 308-309, n. 6, that the facts of
this case do not require us to resolve whether Pacor v. Higgins, 743 F. 2d
984 (CA3 1984), articulates the proper test for determining the scope of
the district court's "related to" jurisdiction.

6 The text of $ 157 reads in relevant part as follows:

"(a) Each district court may provide that any or all cases under title 11
and any or all proceedings arising under title 11 or arising in or related
to a case under title 11 shall be referred to the Bankruptcy Judges for
the district.

"(b)(1) Bankruptcy judges may hear and determine all cases under title
11 and all core proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in a case
under title 11, referred under subsection (a) of this section, and may enter
appropriate orders and judgments, subject to review under section 158 of
this title.. . . . .

"(c)(1) A bankruptcy judge may hear a proceeding that is not a core proceeding but that is otherwise related to a case under title 11. In such
proceeding, the Bankruptcy Judge shall submit proposed findings of fact
and conclusions of law to the district court, and any final order or judgment shall be entered by the district judge after considering the Bankruptcy Judge's proposed findings and conclusions and after reviewing de
novo those matters to which any party has timely and specifically objected.

"(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection,
the district court, with the consent of all the parties to the proceeding,
may refer a proceeding related to a case under title 11 to a bankruptcy
judge to hear and determine and to enter appropriate orders and judgments, subject to review under section 158 of this title."

Stevens, J., dissenting
supersedeas bond was within the District Court's "related
to" jurisdiction and because the District Court referred all
matters to the Bankruptcy Judge, the Bankruptcy Judge had
jurisdiction over the Edwards' action.

In my view, the majority's approach pays insufficient attention to the remaining provisions of $ 157, and, more importantly, to the decision of this Court that gave rise to their
creation. The current jurisdictional structure of the Bankruptcy Code reflects this Court's decision in Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50
(1982), which in turn addressed the Bankruptcy Reform Act
of 1978, 92 Stat. 2549. The 1978 Act significantly restructured the Bankruptcy Code. The Act created "bankruptcy
courts" and vested in them "jurisdiction over all `civil proceedings arising under title 11 [the Bankruptcy title] or arising in or related to cases under title 11.' " Northern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 54, quoting 28 U. S. C. $ 1471(b) (1976 ed.,
Supp. IV). As the plurality opinion in Northern Pipeline
observed, "[t]his jurisdictional grant empowers bankruptcy
courts to entertain a wide variety of cases," involving
"claims based on state law as well as those based on federal
law." 458 U. S., at 54. The Act also bestowed upon the
judges of the bankruptcy courts broad powers to accompany
this expanded jurisdiction. See n. 6, supra; Northern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 55. The Act did not, however, make the
newly empowered bankruptcy judges Article III judges. In
particular, it denied bankruptcy judges the life tenure and
salary protection that the Constitution requires for Article
III judges. See U. S. Const., Art. III, $ 1.

In Northern Pipeline, this Court held that the Act was
unconstitutional, at least insofar as it allowed a non-Article
III court to "entertain and decide" a purely state-law claim.
458 U. S., at 91 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment);
see also id., at 86 (plurality opinion). The plurality opinion
distinguished the revamped bankruptcy courts from prior

district court "adjuncts" which the Court had found did not
violate Article III. The plurality noted that, in contrast to
the narrow, specialized jurisdiction exercised by these prior
adjuncts, "the subject-matter jurisdiction of the bankruptcy
courts encompasses not only traditional matters of bankruptcy, but also `all civil proceedings arising under title 11
or arising in or related to cases under title 11.' " Id., at 85.
In addition, prior adjuncts "engaged in statutorily channeled
factfinding functions," while the bankruptcy courts "exercise
`all of the jurisdiction' conferred by the Act on the district
courts." 7 Ibid.

In response to Northern Pipeline, Congress passed the
Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984
(1984 amendments), 98 Stat. 333. Section 157 was passed as
part of the 1984 amendments. Section 157 establishes two
broad categories of proceedings: "core proceedings" and
"[n]on-core proceedings." For "all core proceedings arising
under title 11, or arising in a case under title 11, referred
under [$ 157(a)]," $ 157(b)(1) permits bankruptcy judges to
"hear and determine" the proceedings and to "enter appropriate orders and judgments." For noncore proceedings
"otherwise related to a case under title 11," $ 157(c)(1) permits the bankruptcy court only to "hear" the proceedings
and to "submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of
law to the district court." See 1 Collier || 3.01[1][c][iv], at
3-28 ("[C]ivil proceedings `related to cases under title 11' "

contained in section[s] 157(c)(1) and (c)(2)"). For these "related proceedings," 1 Collier || 3.01[1][c][iv], at 3-28, only the

district court has the power to enter "any final order orjudgment."

8

In my view, the distinction between the jurisdiction to"hear and determine" core proceedings on the one hand and

the jurisdiction only to "hear" related proceedings on theother hand is critical, if not dispositive. I believe that the
jurisdiction to hear (and yet not to determine) a case under$ 157(c)(1) provides insufficient jurisdiction to a bankruptcy
judge to permit him to issue a binding injunction that pre-vents an Article III court from exercising its conceded jurisdiction over the case.9 The unambiguous text of $ 157(c)(1)

8 The district court may enter judgment only after de novo review of
the bankruptcy judge's recommendation with respect to any matters to
which one of the parties has raised a timely objection. See 28 U. S. C.

$ 157(c)(1).

9 It should be noted that the Bankruptcy Judge's order cannot be upheld

on the ground that it purported to enjoin only the Edwards and thus did
not enjoin directly the Article III court. First, the Bankruptcy Judge's
orders cannot be interpreted so narrowly. The October 17 order enjoined,
inter alia, "all Entities" from "commencing or continuing any judicial, administrative or other proceeding involving any of the Debtors." App. to
Pet. for Cert. A-28. In my view, the word "entities" includes courts. Indeed, the Bankruptcy Judge's order tracks $ 362(a)'s automatic stay provisions, which provide, in part, that the automatic stay is applicable "to all
entities" and which enjoin "the commencement or continuation . . . of a
judicial, administrative, or other action or proceeding against the debtor."
11 U. S. C. $ 362(a)(1). The Courts of Appeals have uniformly held that
"entities," as used in $ 362, include courts. See, e. g., Maritime Electric
Co., 959 F. 2d 1194, 1206 (CA3 1991) ("$ 362's stay is mandatory and `applicable to all entities', including state and federal courts"); Pope v. Manville
Forest Products Corp., 778 F. 2d 238, 239 (CA5 1985) ("just the entry of
an order of dismissal, even if entered sua sponte, constitutes a judicial
act toward the disposition of the case and hence may be construed as a
`continuation' of a judicial proceeding"); Ellis v. Consolidated Diesel Electric Corp., 894 F. 2d 371, 372-373 (CA10 1990) (District Court's entry of
summary judgment violated $ 362(a)'s automatic stay); see also Maritime
Electric Co., 959 F. 2d, at 1206 (collecting cases). Cf. 2 Collier || 101.15,
at 101-62 to 101-63 (" `Entity' is the broadest of all definitions which relate to bodies or units").

More importantly, though the Bankruptcy Judge's June 13 order enjoins " `the judgment creditor,' " In re Celotex Corp., 128 B. R. 478, 485

Stevens, J., dissenting
requires that the bankruptcy judge's participation in related
proceedings be merely advisory rather than adjudicative.
In my view, having jurisdiction to grant injunctions over
cases that one may not decide is inconsistent with such an
advisory role. An injunction is an extraordinary remedy
whose impact on private rights may be just as onerous as a
final determination. The constitutional concerns that animate the current jurisdictional provisions of the Bankruptcy
Code and that deny non-Article III tribunals the power to
determine private controversies apply with equal force to
the entry of an injunction interfering with the exercise of
the admitted jurisdiction of an Article III tribunal.10

In sum, my view on the sufficiency of "related to" jurisdiction to sustain the injunction in this case can be stated quite
simply: If a bankruptcy judge lacks jurisdiction to "determine" a question, the judge also lacks jurisdiction to issue an
injunction that prevents an Article III court, which concededly does have jurisdiction, from determining that ques(Bkrtcy. Ct. MD Fla. 1991), the order clearly has the same practical effect
as if it enjoined the court directly. My objection to the majority's approach does not at all depend on whether the order that prevents the
Article III court from exercising its jurisdiction does so directly or indirectly. Instead, my view is simply that a Bankruptcy Judge who lacks
jurisdiction to decide an issue may not prevent an Article III court that
is ready and willing to exercise its conceded jurisdiction from doing so.

10 In addition, 28 U. S. C. $ 1334(c)(2) provides for mandatory abstention

in cases involving state-law claims for which the sole basis of bankruptcy
jurisdiction is "related to" jurisdiction. That provision thus makes clear
that no order could have been entered over the Edwards' objection if their
tort action had been tried in a state rather than a federal court. The
Bankruptcy Judge's order, which does not distinguish proceedings to enforce supersedeas bonds that were posted in state-court proceedings, fails
to address the implications of this mandatory abstention provision.

I also believe that Congress would have expected bankruptcy judges to
show the same deference to federal courts adjudicating state-law claims
under diversity jurisdiction, at least when the bankruptcy judge purports
to act on the basis of his "related to" jurisdiction and when the federal
action can be "timely adjudicated." Ibid.

tion.11 Any conclusion to the contrary would trivialize theconstitutional imperatives that shaped the Bankruptcy

Code's jurisdictional provisions.12

III
Petitioner and the majority rely primarily on "related to"jurisdiction. Indeed, the Court's holding appears to rest almost entirely on the view that a bankruptcy judge has juris-diction to enjoin proceedings in Article III courts whenever
those proceedings are "related to" a pending Title 11 case.See ante, at 307-311. Two footnotes in the Court's opinion,
however, might be read as suggesting alternative bases of

11 I agree with the majority that the Bankruptcy Judge's order is a temporary injunction, and thus it is not a "final order or judgment." Ante,
at 309, n. 7. The temporary nature of the injunction, however, is irrelevant. As I have stated repeatedly in the text, I believe that a statutory
scheme that deprives a bankruptcy judge of jurisdiction to "determine" a
case also deprives that judge of jurisdiction to issue binding injunctions--
even temporary ones--that would prevent an Article III court with jurisdiction over the case from determining it.

12 The cases on which the Bankruptcy Judge relied are entirely consistent with my approach, and they provide at most indirect support for his
order. In A. H. Robins Co. v. Piccinin, 788 F. 2d 994, 997 (CA4), cert.
denied, 479 U. S. 876 (1986), the challenged injunction was issued by an
Article III court ("[T]he district court granted Robins' request for a preliminary injunction"); and in In re Johns-Manville Corp., 837 F. 2d 89,
91-92 (CA2), cert. denied, 488 U. S. 868 (1988), the Court of Appeals found
that the Bankruptcy Judge had jurisdiction to enter the injunction in a
core proceeding because the insurance policies that were the subject of
the injunction were property of the bankruptcy estate. Thus, those cases
do not support the present injunction, which was issued by a non-Article
III judge and which affects supersedeas bonds that are concededly not
property of the debtor's estate.

I also note that in Willis v. Celotex Corp., 978 F. 2d 146 (1992), cert.
denied, 507 U. S. 1030 (1993), though upholding the very injunction at issue
in this case, the Fourth Circuit engaged in no detailed jurisdictional analysis and entirely omitted any discussion of the significance of the Bankruptcy Judge's non-Article III status.

jurisdiction. See ante, at 304-305, n. 4, 311, n. 8. Thosetwo footnotes require a brief response.

In footnote 4 of its opinion, the Court refers to two differ-ent claims advanced by Celotex in the bankruptcy proceedings: a claim that "the bonded judgment creditors should notbe able to execute on their bonds because, by virtue of the
collateralization of the bonds, the bonded judgment creditorsare beneficiaries of Celotex asset transfers that are voidable
as preferences and fraudulent transfers"; and a claim that"the punitive damages portions of the judgments can be
voided or subordinated." There is little doubt that thoseclaims are properly characterized as ones "arising under"
Title 11 within the meaning of 28 U. S. C. $ 1334(b); 13 how-ever, it does not necessarily follow from that characterization
that the Bankruptcy Judge had jurisdiction to issue the in-junction in support of the prosecution of those claims. Celotex's complaint was not filed until months after the Bank-ruptcy Judge's injunction issued. The claims raised in that
complaint cannot retroactively provide a jurisdictional basisfor the Bankruptcy Judge's injunction.

Moreover, Celotex's attempts to set aside the Edwards'supersedeas bond are patently meritless. It strains credu13 "[W]hen a cause of action is one which is created by title 11, then that
civil proceeding is one `arising under title 11.' " 1 Collier || 3.01[1] [c][iii],
at 3-26. A perusal of the complaint reveals that Celotex seeks relief
under causes of action created by the Bankruptcy Code. See, e. g., Count
I (11 U. S. C. $ 547(b) (seeking to avoid preferential transfers)); Count III
(11 U. S. C. $ 548(a)(2)(A) (seeking to avoid constructively fraudulent transfers)); Count IV (11 U. S. C. $ 544 (seeking to avoid transactions that would
constitute constructively fraudulent transfers under state law)); Count
VII (11 U. S. C. $ 502 (seeking to disallow punitive damages awards);
Count VII (11 U. S. C. $ 510(c)(1) (seeking equitable subordination of pending punitive damages awards to the claims of unsecured creditors)). Cf.,
e. g., 1 Collier || 3.01[1][c][iii], at 3-27 ("[C]ourts interpreting this language
have held that `arising under title 11' includes causes of action to recover
fraudulent conveyances"). My acknowledgment of these claims, of course,
is not intended as a suggestion that they have merit.

Stevens, J., dissenting
lity, to suggest that a supersedeas bond, posted almost a yearand a half before the bankruptcy petition was filed, could be

set aside as a preference or as a fraudulent transfer for thebenefit of Celotex's adversaries in bitterly contested litigation. Conceivably, Celotex's provision of security to Northbrook might be voidable, but that possibility could not impairthe rights of the judgment creditors to enforce the bond

against Northbrook even though they might be unwittingbeneficiaries of the fraud. That possibility, at most, would
be relevant to the respective claims of Northbrook and Celo-tex to the pledged collateral. Similarly, the fact that the
Edwards' judgment included punitive as well as compensatory damages does not provide even an arguable basis for
reducing Northbrook's obligations under the supersedeas
bond. Even if there is a basis for subordinating a portion of
Northbrook's eventual claim against Celotex on "bankruptcy
law grounds," that has nothing to do with the Edwards' claim
against Northbrook. It thus seems obvious that, at least
with respect to the Edwards, Celotex has raised frivolous
claims in an attempt to manufacture bankruptcy jurisdiction
and thereby to justify a bankruptcy judge's injunction that
had been issued over one year earlier. Cf. Siler v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 213 U. S. 175, 191-192 (1909) ("Of
course, the Federal question must not be merely colorable or
fraudulently set up for the mere purpose of endeavoring to
give the court jurisdiction").

In its footnote 8, the Court appears to suggest that the
injunction prohibiting the Edwards from proceeding against
Northbrook (described in the footnote as the "stay proceeding") may "aris[e] under" Title 11 or may "arise in" the Title
11 case. Perhaps this is accurate in a literal sense: The injunction did, of course, "arise under" Title 11 because 11
U. S. C. $ 105(a) created whatever power the Bankruptcy
Judge had to issue the injunction. Similarly, the injunction
"arises in" the Title 11 case because that is where it originated. It cannot be the law, however, that a bankruptcy

judge has jurisdiction to enter any conceivable order that a
party might request simply because $ 105(a) authorizes some
injunctions or because the request was first made in a pending Title 11 case. Cf. 2 Collier || 105.01[1], at 105-3 (Section
105 "is not an independent source of jurisdiction, but rather
it grants the courts flexibility to issue orders which preserve
and protect their jurisdiction"). The mere filing of a motion
for a $ 105 injunction to enjoin a proceeding in another forum
cannot be a jurisdictional bootstrap enabling a bankruptcy
judge to exercise jurisdiction that would not otherwise exist.

IV
Even if I believed that the Bankruptcy Judge had jurisdiction to issue his injunction, I would still affirm the Court of
Appeals because in my view the Bankruptcy Judge's injunction has only a "frivolous pretense to validity."

In 1898, Congress codified the bankruptcy laws. Under
the 1898 Bankruptcy Act, most bankruptcy proceedings were
conducted by "referees" who resolved controversies involving property in the actual or constructive possession of the
court, as well as certain disputes involving property in the
possession of third parties. In $ 2(a)(15) of the 1898 Act,
Congress vested in bankruptcy courts the power to:

"[M]ake such orders, issue such process, and enter such
judgments in addition to those specifically provided for
as may be necessary for the enforcement of the provisions of this Act." Act of July 1, 1898, 30 Stat. 546.

In 1938, Congress clarified both the powers and the limitations on the injunctive authority of referees in bankruptcy
by adding to the end of $ 2(a)(15), "Provided, however, That
an injunction to restrain a court may be issued by the judge
only." 52 Stat. 843 (emphasis in original).

In 1978, through the Bankruptcy Reform Act, Congress
significantly revised the Bankruptcy Code and the role of

514us2$45i 05-27-98 16:00:20 PAGES OPINPGT
328 CELOTEX CORP. v. EDWARDS

Stevens, J., dissenting
bankruptcy referees.14 Though stopping short of makingbankruptcy referees Article III judges, Congress significantly increased the status, the duties, and the powers ofthose referees. For example, as we noted in Northern Pipeline, the expanded powers under the new Act included "thepower to hold jury trials, . . . to issue declaratory judgments,
[and] to issue writs of habeas corpus under certain circum-stances." 458 U. S., at 55. In addition, Congress again provided for broad injunctive powers. Thus, for example, inthe place of $ 2(a)(15), Congress added 11 U. S. C. $ 105, which
provided in relevant part: "The [bankruptcy court] may issueany order, process, or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title." See also 458U. S., at 55 ("Congress has allowed bankruptcy judges the
power . . . to issue all writs necessary in aid of the bank-ruptcy court's expanded jurisdiction"). Once again, however, along with both this marked expansion of the powerof bankruptcy judges and the broad delegation of injunctive
authority, Congress indicated its intent to limit the powerof those judges to enjoin other courts: Although Congress
provided that "[a] bankruptcy court shall have the powers ofa court of equity, law, and admiralty," it also provided that
bankruptcy courts "may not enjoin another court." 28U. S. C. $ 1481 (1982 ed.).

15 Thus, for well over 50 years

prior to the adoption of the 1984 amendments to the Bank-ruptcy Code, it was clear that Congress intended to deny

bankruptcy judges the power to enjoin other courts.

14 In 1973, bankruptcy "referees" were redesignated as "judges." See
Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50,
53, n. 2 (1982). As did the plurality opinion in Northern Pipeline, see
ibid., I will continue to refer to all judges under the pre-1978 Act as
"referees."

15 Congress also limited the power of bankruptcy courts to "punish a

criminal contempt not committed in the presence of the judge of the court
or warranting a punishment of imprisonment." 28 U. S. C. $ 1481 (1982
ed.).

Stevens, J., dissenting
The 1984 amendments, inter alia, repealed $ 1481 (and its
express limitation on injunctive authority), leaving $ 105 as
the only source of the bankruptcy judge's injunctive authority.16 Given that Northern Pipeline required a contraction
in the authority of bankruptcy judges,17 and given that the
1984 amendments regarding the powers of the bankruptcy
courts were passed to comply with Northern Pipeline,18 it
would be perverse--and in my view "frivolous"--to contend
that Congress intended the repeal of $ 1481 to operate as an
authorization for those judges to enjoin proceedings in other
courts, thus significantly expanding the powers of bankruptcy judges.

My view of the consequence of the 1984 amendments is
reinforced by the structure of $ 1481. When Congress
placed restrictions on the injunctive power of the bankruptcy
courts, it did so in $ 1481, right after the clause granting
those courts "the powers of a court of equity, law, and admiralty." In my view, this suggests that Congress saw

$ 1481--and not $ 105(a)--as the source of any power to enjoin other courts. Thus, the removal of $ 1481 by the 1984
amendments is properly viewed as eliminating the sole
source of congressionally granted authority to enjoin other
courts. Cf. In re Hipp, 895 F. 2d 1503, 1515-1516 (CA5 1990)
(concluding on similar reasoning that $ 1481, not $ 105(a), was
the source of the bankruptcy court's power to punish criminal contempt under the 1978 Act).

16 The 1984 amendments also repealed the authorization of bankruptcy
judges to act pursuant to the All Writs Act. See 2 Collier || 105.01[1],
at 105-3.

17 The plurality opinion expressly noted its concerns about the bankruptcy judge's exercise of broad injunctive powers. See n. 7, supra.

18 See, e. g., 130 Cong. Rec. 20089 (1984) ("[Northern Pipeline] held that

the broad powers granted to bankruptcy judges under the Bankruptcy
Act of 1978 were judicial powers and violated Article III of the Constitution. The present Bill attempts to cure the problem").

330 CELOTEX CORP. v. EDWARDS

Stevens, J., dissenting
Nor does anything in the 1986 amendments to the Bank-ruptcy Code alter my analysis.

19 The primary effect of

those amendments was to give the bankruptcy judges thepower to issue orders

sua sponte.20 The 1986 amendments,
therefore, do not reflect any expansion of the power of Bank-ruptcy Judges to enjoin other courts.

The Bankruptcy Judge's error with respect to this injunction thus seems clear, and the injunction falls, therefore,within the exception recognized by the majority for injunctions with only a "frivolous pretense to validity." I recog-nize, of course, that one may legitimately question the "frivolousness" of the injunction in light of the Fourth Circuit'supholding the very injunction at issue in this case, see

Willis
v. Celotex Corp., 978 F. 2d 146 (1992), cert. denied, 507 U. S.1030 (1993), and the disagreement of a substantial number of

my colleagues. In my view, however, the Bankruptcy
Judge's error is sufficiently plain that the Court of Appeals
was justified in allowing the Edwards to collect on their
bond.21

19 See Bankruptcy Judges, United States Trustees, and Family Farmer
Bankruptcy Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-554, 100 Stat. 3088. With respect to
11 U. S. C. $ 105, the 1986 amendments added the second sentence of the
current version of $ 105(a). See 100 Stat. 3097.

20 The only relevant legislative history regarding the changes to $ 105(a)

is contained in Senator Hatch's view that the amendment "allows a bankruptcy court to take any action on its own, or to make any necessary
determination to prevent an abuse of process and to help expedite a case
in a proper and justified manner." 132 Cong. Rec. 28610 (1986).

21 Neither of the cases cited by the majority, ante, at 312-313, n. 9, provides any reason to conclude otherwise. As the majority notes, those
cases hold that the bankruptcy trustee may recover from a third party
(e. g., the Edwards) funds transferred from the debtor (e. g., Celotex) to
another (e. g., Northbrook) for the benefit of that third party. Both cases,
however, make clear that the obligation of the Northbrook-like guarantor
(a bank in each case) to pay the third party was not at issue. See In re
Compton Corp., 831 F. 2d 586, 590 (1987) ("[T]he trustee is not attempting
to set aside the post petition payments by [the bank] to [the third party]
under the letter of credit as a preference"), modified on other grounds, 835

V
The Court's holding today rests largely on its view thatthe Edwards' proper remedy is to appeal the Bankruptcy

Judge's injunction, first to the District Court and then tothe Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The Court
concedes, however, that the Edwards need not do so if theBankruptcy Judge exceeded his jurisdiction, or if the injunction is supported by nothing more than "a frivolous pretenseto validity." Ante, at 312. For the reasons already stated,
I think both of those conditions are satisfied in this case.The non-Article III Bankruptcy Judge simply lacked both
jurisdiction and authority to prevent an Article III courtfrom exercising its unquestioned jurisdiction to decide a matter that is related only indirectly to the bankruptcy proceed-ing. I think it important, however, to add a few brief words
explaining why I find this injunction especially troublingand why the injunction should be viewed with a particularly
critical eye.First, the justification offered by the Bankruptcy Judge
should give the Court pause. As originally articulated, thejustification for this injunction was that emergency relief
was required lest the reorganization of Celotex become im-possible and liquidation follow. Apart from the fact that the
"emergency" rationale is plainly insufficient to support anotherwise improper injunction that has now lasted for more
than four years, the judge's reasoning reveals reliance on themisguided notion that a good end is a sufficient justification
for the existence and exercise of power. His reference tothe need to exercise "absolute" power to override "potential conflicts with other judicial determinations" that mighthave a "potential impact on the debtor" should invite far

295-296 (CA11), cert. denied sub nom. First Interstate Credit Alliance v.
American Bank of Martin County, 488 U. S. 993 (1988). Thus, in my
view, those cases cannot form the basis for any nonfrivolous argument that
Northbrook may avoid its obligation to pay the Edwards.

Stevens, J., dissenting
more exacting scrutiny of his order than the Court deemsappropriate.

Second, that the subject of the injunction was a superse-deas bond makes the injunction suspect. A supersedeas
bond may be viewed as putting the integrity of the court in
which it is lodged on the line. As the Court of Appealsnoted, the Edwards were "promised by the court" that the

supersedeas bond would be available if they prevailed onappeal. 6 F. 3d, at 320. For that reason, in my opinion,
questions relating to the enforceability of a supersedeasbond should generally be answered in the forum in which
the bond is posted.

Moreover, whenever possible, such questions should be resolved before the court accepts the bond as security for collection of the judgment being appealed. After a debtor has
benefited from the postponement of collection of an adverse
judgment, both that debtor and its successors in interest
should normally be estopped from asserting that the judgment creditors who relied to their detriment on the validity
of the bond had no right to do so. The very purpose of a
supersedeas bond is to protect judgment creditors from the
risk that insolvency of the debtor may impair their ability to
enforce the judgment promptly. When the bond has served
the purpose of forestalling immediate levies on the judgment
debtor's assets--levies that might have precipitated an earlier bankruptcy--it is inequitable to postpone payment
merely because the risk against which the bond was intended
to provide protection has actually occurred. See id., at 319
("It is manifestly unfair to force the judgment creditor to
delay the right to collect with a promise to protect the judgment only to later refuse to allow that successful plaintiff to
execute the bond because the debtor has sought protection
under the laws of bankruptcy"); In re Southmark, 138 B. R.
820, 827-828 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Tex. 1992) (internal quotation
marks omitted) ("The principal risk against which such
bonds are intended as a protection is insolvency. To hold

that the very contingency against which they guard shall, ifit happens, discharge them, seems to us bad law and worse

logic"). The inequity that the Court today condones doesnot, of course, demonstrate that its legal analysis is incorrect.
It does, however, persuade me that the Court should notreview this case as though it presented an ordinary collateral
attack on an injunction entered by an Article III court.22Instead, the Court should, I believe, more carefully consider
which of the two competing tribunals is guilty of trespassingin the other's domain.

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

22 Indeed, one wonders if the same analysis would apply to a bankruptcy
judge's injunction that purported to prevent this Court from allowing a
successful litigant to enforce a supersedeas bond posted by a nondebtor in
this Court pursuant to our Rule 23.4.

McINTYRE, executor of ESTATE OF McINTYRE,DECEASED

v. OHIO ELECTIONS COMMISSION

certiorari to the supreme court of ohio
No. 93-986. Argued October 12, 1994--Decided April 19, 1995
After petitioner's decedent distributed leaflets purporting to express the

views of "CONCERNED PARENTS AND TAX PAYERS" opposing
a proposed school tax levy, she was fined by respondent for violating

$ 3599.09(A) of the Ohio Code, which prohibits the distribution of campaign literature that does not contain the name and address of the person or campaign official issuing the literature. The Court of Common
Pleas reversed, but the Ohio Court of Appeals reinstated the fine. In
affirming, the State Supreme Court held that the burdens $ 3599.09(A)
imposed on voters' First Amendment rights were "reasonable" and
"nondiscriminatory" and therefore valid. Declaring that $ 3599.09(A) is
intended to identify persons who distribute campaign materials containing fraud, libel, or false advertising and to provide voters with a mechanism for evaluating such materials, the court distinguished Talley v.
California, 362 U. S. 60, in which this Court invalidated an ordinance
prohibiting all anonymous leafletting.

Held: Section 3599.09(A)'s prohibition of the distribution of anonymous

campaign literature abridges the freedom of speech in violation of the
First Amendment. Pp. 341-357.

(a) The freedom to publish anonymously is protected by the First
Amendment, and, as Talley indicates, extends beyond the literary realm
to the advocacy of political causes. Pp. 341-343.

(b) This Court's precedents make abundantly clear that the Ohio Supreme Court's reasonableness standard is significantly more lenient than
is appropriate in a case of this kind. Although Talley concerned a different limitation than $ 3599.09(A) and thus does not necessarily control
here, the First Amendment's protection of anonymity nevertheless applies. Section 3599.09(A) is not simply an election code provision subject to the "ordinary litigation" test set forth in Anderson v. Celebrezze,
460 U. S. 780, and similar cases. Rather, it is a regulation of core political speech. Moreover, the category of documents it covers is defined
by their content--only those publications containing speech designed to
influence the voters in an election need bear the required information.
See, e. g., First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 776-777.
When a law burdens such speech, the Court applies "exacting scrutiny,"

Syllabus
upholding the restriction only if it is narrowly tailored to serve an overriding state interest. See, e. g., id., at 786. Pp. 343-347.

(c) Section 3599.09(A)'s anonymous speech ban is not justified by
Ohio's asserted interests in preventing fraudulent and libelous statements and in providing the electorate with relevant information. The
claimed informational interest is plainly insufficient to support the statute's disclosure requirement, since the speaker's identity is no different
from other components of a document's contents that the author is free
to include or exclude, and the author's name and address add little to
the reader's ability to evaluate the document in the case of a handbill
written by a private citizen unknown to the reader. Moreover, the
state interest in preventing fraud and libel (which Ohio vindicates by
means of other, more direct prohibitions) does not justify $ 3599.09(A)'s
extremely broad prohibition of anonymous leaflets. The statute encompasses all documents, regardless of whether they are arguably false or
misleading. Although a State might somehow demonstrate that its enforcement interests justify a more limited identification requirement,
Ohio has not met that burden here. Pp. 348-353.

(d) This Court's opinions in Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 792, n. 32--which
commented in dicta on the prophylactic effect of requiring identification of the source of corporate campaign advertising--and Buckley v.
Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 75-76--which approved mandatory disclosure of
campaign-related expenditures--do not establish the constitutionality
of $ 3599.09(A), since neither case involved a prohibition of anonymous
campaign literature. Pp. 353-356.

Opinion of the Court

I
On April 27, 1988, Margaret McIntyre distributed leaflets
to persons attending a public meeting at the Blendon MiddleSchool in Westerville, Ohio. At this meeting, the superintendent of schools planned to discuss an imminent referen-dum on a proposed school tax levy. The leaflets expressed
Mrs. McIntyre's opposition to the levy.2 There is no sugges-tion that the text of her message was false, misleading, or
libelous. She had composed and printed it on her home com-puter and had paid a professional printer to make additional
copies. Some of the handbills identified her as the author;
others merely purported to express the views of "CON-CERNED PARENTS AND TAX PAYERS." Except for

the help provided by her son and a friend, who placed someof the leaflets on car windshields in the school parking lot,
Mrs. McIntyre acted independently.

2 The following is one of Mrs. McIntyre's leaflets, in its original typeface:

Opinion of the Court
While Mrs. McIntyre distributed her handbills, an official
of the school district, who supported the tax proposal, advised her that the unsigned leaflets did not conform to the
Ohio election laws. Undeterred, Mrs. McIntyre appeared at
another meeting on the next evening and handed out more
of the handbills.

The proposed school levy was defeated at the next two
elections, but it finally passed on its third try in November
1988. Five months later, the same school official filed a complaint with the Ohio Elections Commission charging that
Mrs. McIntyre's distribution of unsigned leaflets violated

$ 3599.09(A) of the Ohio Code.3 The commission agreed and
imposed a fine of $100.

3 Ohio Rev. Code Ann. $ 3599.09(A) (1988) provides:
"No person shall write, print, post, or distribute, or cause to be written,
printed, posted, or distributed, a notice, placard, dodger, advertisement,
sample ballot, or any other form of general publication which is designed
to promote the nomination or election or defeat of a candidate, or to promote the adoption or defeat of any issue, or to influence the voters in
any election, or make an expenditure for the purpose of financing political
communications through newspapers, magazines, outdoor advertising
facilities, direct mailings, or other similar types of general public political
advertising, or through flyers, handbills, or other nonperiodical printed
matter, unless there appears on such form of publication in a conspicuous
place or is contained within said statement the name and residence or
business address of the chairman, treasurer, or secretary of the organization issuing the same, or the person who issues, makes, or is responsible
therefor. The disclaimer `paid political advertisement' is not sufficient to
meet the requirements of this division. When such publication is issued
by the regularly constituted central or executive committee of a political
party, organized as provided in Chapter 3517. of the Revised Code, it shall
be sufficiently identified if it bears the name of the committee and its
chairman or treasurer. No person, firm, or corporation shall print or reproduce any notice, placard, dodger, advertisement, sample ballot, or any
other form of publication in violation of this section. This section does
not apply to the transmittal of personal correspondence that is not reproduced by machine for general distribution.

"The secretary of state may, by rule, exempt, from the requirements of
this division, printed matter and certain other kinds of printed communications such as campaign buttons, balloons, pencils, or like items, the size

Opinion of the Court
The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas reversed.
Finding that Mrs. McIntyre did not "mislead the public nor
act in a surreptitious manner," the court concluded that the
statute was unconstitutional as applied to her conduct.
App. to Pet. for Cert. A-34 to A-35. The Ohio Court of
Appeals, by a divided vote, reinstated the fine. Notwithstanding doubts about the continuing validity of a 1922 decision of the Ohio Supreme Court upholding the statutory
predecessor of $ 3599.09(A), the majority considered itself
bound by that precedent. Id., at A-20 to A-21, citing State
v. Babst, 104 Ohio St. 167, 135 N. E. 525 (1922). The dissenting judge thought that our intervening decision in Talley v.
California, 362 U. S. 60 (1960), in which we invalidated a city
ordinance prohibiting all anonymous leafletting, compelled
the Ohio court to adopt a narrowing construction of the
statute to save its constitutionality. App. to Pet. for Cert.
A-30 to A-31.

The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed by a divided vote. The
majority distinguished Mrs. McIntyre's case from Talley on
the ground that $ 3599.09(A) "has as its purpose the identification of persons who distribute materials containing false
statements." 67 Ohio St. 3d 391, 394, 618 N. E. 2d 152, 154

or nature of which makes it unreasonable to add an identification or disclaimer. The disclaimer or identification, when paid for by a campaign
committee, shall be identified by the words `paid for by' followed by the
name and address of the campaign committee and the appropriate officer
of the committee, identified by name and title."

Section 3599.09(B) contains a comparable prohibition against unidentified
communications uttered over the broadcasting facilities of any radio or
television station. No question concerning that provision is raised in this
case. Our opinion, therefore, discusses only written communications and,
particularly, leaflets of the kind Mrs. McIntyre distributed. Cf. Turner
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 637-638 (1994) (discussing
application of First Amendment principles to regulation of television and
radio).

The complaint against Mrs. McIntyre also alleged violations of two other
provisions of the Ohio Code, but those charges were dismissed and are not
before this Court.

Opinion of the Court
(1993). The Ohio court believed that such a law should beupheld if the burdens imposed on the First Amendment

rights of voters are " `reasonable' " and " `nondiscriminatory.' " Id., at 396, 618 N. E. 2d, at 155, quoting Anderson
v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 788 (1983). Under that standard, the majority concluded that the statute was plainlyvalid:

"The minor requirement imposed by R.C. 3599.09 that
those persons producing campaign literature identifythemselves as the source thereof neither impacts the

content of their message nor significantly burdens their
ability to have it disseminated. This burden is morethan counterbalanced by the state interest in providing

the voters to whom the message is directed with a mech-anism by which they may better evaluate its validity.
Moreover, the law serves to identify those who engagein fraud, libel or false advertising. Not only are such
interests sufficient to overcome the minor burden placed
upon such persons, these interests were specifically ac-knowledged in [

First Nat. Bank of Boston v.] Bellotti[,
435 U. S. 765 (1978),] to be regulations of the sort whichwould survive constitutional scrutiny." 67 Ohio St. 3d,

at 396, 618 N. E. 2d, at 155-156.
In dissent, Justice Wright argued that the statute should
be tested under a more severe standard because of its sig-nificant effect "on the ability of individual citizens to freely

express their views in writing on political issues." Id.,at 398, 618 N. E. 2d, at 156-157. He concluded that

$ 3599.09(A) "is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling
state interest and is, therefore, unconstitutional as applied
to McIntyre." Id., at 401, 618 N. E. 2d, at 159.

Mrs. McIntyre passed away during the pendency of this
litigation. Even though the amount in controversy is only
$100, petitioner, as the executor of her estate, has pursued
her claim in this Court. Our grant of certiorari, 510 U. S.

Opinion of the Court
1108 (1994), reflects our agreement with his appraisal of theimportance of the question presented.

II
Ohio maintains that the statute under review is a reason-able regulation of the electoral process. The State does not

suggest that all anonymous publications are pernicious orthat a statute totally excluding them from the marketplace
of ideas would be valid. This is a wise (albeit implicit) con-cession, for the anonymity of an author is not ordinarily a
sufficient reason to exclude her work product from the pro-tections of the First Amendment.

"Anonymous pamphlets, leaflets, brochures and even bookshave played an important role in the progress of mankind."
Talley v. California, 362 U. S., at 64. Great works of litera-ture have frequently been produced by authors writing
under assumed names.4 Despite readers' curiosity and thepublic's interest in identifying the creator of a work of art,
an author generally is free to decide whether or not to dis-close his or her true identity. The decision in favor of anonymity may be motivated by fear of economic or official re4 American names such as Mark Twain (Samuel Langhorne Clemens)
and O. Henry (William Sydney Porter) come readily to mind. Benjamin
Franklin employed numerous different pseudonyms. See 2 W. Bruce,
Benjamin Franklin Self-Revealed: A Biographical and Critical Study
Based Mainly on His Own Writings, ch. 5 (2d ed. 1923). Distinguished
French authors such as Voltaire (Francois Marie Arouet) and George Sand
(Amandine Aurore Lucie Dupin), and British authors such as George Eliot
(Mary Ann Evans), Charles Lamb (sometimes wrote as "Elia"), and
Charles Dickens (sometimes wrote as "Boz"), also published under assumed names. Indeed, some believe the works of Shakespeare were
actually written by the Earl of Oxford rather than by William Shaksper
of Stratford-on-Avon. See C. Ogburn, The Mysterious William Shakespeare: The Myth & the Reality (2d ed. 1992); but see S. Schoenbaum,
Shakespeare's Lives (2d ed. 1991) (adhering to the traditional view that
Shaksper was in fact the author). See also Stevens, The Shakespeare
Canon of Statutory Construction, 140 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1373 (1992) (commenting on the competing theories).

Opinion of the Court
taliation, by concern about social ostracism, or merely by adesire to preserve as much of one's privacy as possible.

Whatever the motivation may be, at least in the field of liter-ary endeavor, the interest in having anonymous works enter
the marketplace of ideas unquestionably outweighs any public interest in requiring disclosure as a condition of entry.5Accordingly, an author's decision to remain anonymous, like

other decisions concerning omissions or additions to the con-tent of a publication, is an aspect of the freedom of speech
protected by the First Amendment.The freedom to publish anonymously extends beyond the
literary realm. In Talley, the Court held that the FirstAmendment protects the distribution of unsigned handbills
urging readers to boycott certain Los Angeles merchantswho were allegedly engaging in discriminatory employment
practices. 362 U. S. 60. Writing for the Court, Justice
Black noted that "[p]ersecuted groups and sects from timeto time throughout history have been able to criticize oppressive practices and laws either anonymously or not at all."
Id., at 64. Justice Black recalled England's abusive press
licensing laws and seditious libel prosecutions, and he re-minded us that even the arguments favoring the ratification

of the Constitution advanced in the Federalist Papers werepublished under fictitious names.

Id., at 64-65. On occasion, quite apart from any threat of persecution, an advocate
may believe her ideas will be more persuasive if her readersare unaware of her identity. Anonymity thereby provides a

way for a writer who may be personally unpopular to ensurethat readers will not prejudge her message simply because
they do not like its proponent. Thus, even in the field of

5 Though such a requirement might provide assistance to critics in evaluating the quality and significance of the writing, it is not indispensable.
To draw an analogy from a nonliterary context, the now-pervasive practice
of grading law school examination papers "blindly" (i. e., under a system
in which the professor does not know whose paper she is grading) indicates
that such evaluations are possible--indeed, perhaps more reliable--when
any bias associated with the author's identity is prescinded.

political rhetoric, where "the identity of the speaker is animportant component of many attempts to persuade," City

of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U. S. 43, 56 (1994) (footnote omitted),the most effective advocates have sometimes opted for anonymity. The specific holding in Talley related to advocacyof an economic boycott, but the Court's reasoning embraced
a respected tradition of anonymity in the advocacy of politi-cal causes.

6 This tradition is perhaps best exemplified by

the secret ballot, the hard-won right to vote one's consciencewithout fear of retaliation.

III
California had defended the Los Angeles ordinance atissue in

Talley as a law "aimed at providing a way to identifythose responsible for fraud, false advertising and libel." 362

U. S., at 64. We rejected that argument because nothing inthe text or legislative history of the ordinance limited its
application to those evils.7 Ibid. We then made clear that

6 That tradition is most famously embodied in the Federalist Papers,
authored by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay, but signed
"Publius." Publius' opponents, the Anti-Federalists, also tended to publish under pseudonyms: prominent among them were "Cato," believed to
be New York Governor George Clinton; "Centinel," probably Samuel
Bryan or his father, Pennsylvania judge and legislator George Bryan; "The
Federal Farmer," who may have been Richard Henry Lee, a Virginia
member of the Continental Congress and a signer of the Declaration of
Independence; and "Brutus," who may have been Robert Yates, a New
York Supreme Court justice who walked out on the Constitutional Convention. 2 H. Storing, ed., The Complete Anti-Federalist (1981). A forerunner of all of these writers was the pre-Revolutionary War English
pamphleteer "Junius," whose true identity remains a mystery. See Encyclopedia of Colonial and Revolutionary America 220 (J. Faragher ed. 1990)
(positing that "Junius" may have been Sir Phillip Francis). The "Letters
of Junius" were "widely reprinted in colonial newspapers and lent considerable support to the revolutionary cause." Powell v. McCormack, 395
U. S. 486, 531, n. 60 (1969).

7 In his concurring opinion, Justice Harlan added these words:

"Here the State says that this ordinance is aimed at the prevention of
`fraud, deceit, false advertising, negligent use of words, obscenity, and
libel,' in that it will aid in the detection of those responsible for spreading

Opinion of the Court
we did "not pass on the validity of an ordinance limited toprevent these or any other supposed evils." Ibid. The

Ohio statute likewise contains no language limiting its appli-cation to fraudulent, false, or libelous statements; to the extent, therefore, that Ohio seeks to justify $ 3599.09(A) as ameans to prevent the dissemination of untruths, its defense
must fail for the same reason given in Talley. As the factsof this case demonstrate, the ordinance plainly applies even
when there is no hint of falsity or libel.Ohio's statute does, however, contain a different limitation:
It applies only to unsigned documents designed to influencevoters in an election. In contrast, the Los Angeles ordinance prohibited all anonymous handbilling "in any placeunder any circumstances." Id., at 60-61. For that reason,
Ohio correctly argues that Talley does not necessarily con-trol the disposition of this case. We must, therefore, decide
whether and to what extent the First Amendment's protec-tion of anonymity encompasses documents intended to influence the electoral process.Ohio places its principal reliance on cases such as

Ander-son v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780 (1983); Storer v. Brown, 415

U. S. 724 (1974); and Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428 (1992),in which we reviewed election code provisions governing the
voting process itself. See Anderson, supra (filing dead-lines); Storer, supra (ballot access); Burdick, supra (write-in
voting); see also Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn., 479U. S. 208 (1986) (eligibility of independent voters to vote in
party primaries). In those cases we refused to adopt "any
material of that character. But the ordinance is not so limited, and I
think it will not do for the State simply to say that the circulation of all
anonymous handbills must be suppressed in order to identify the distributors of those that may be of an obnoxious character. In the absence of a
more substantial showing as to Los Angeles' actual experience with the
distribution of obnoxious handbills, such a generality is for me too remote
to furnish a constitutionally acceptable justification for the deterrent effect
on free speech which this all-embracing ordinance is likely to have." 362

`litmus-paper test' that will separate valid from invalid restrictions." Anderson, 460 U. S., at 789, quoting Storer, 415
U. S., at 730. Instead, we pursued an analytical process
comparable to that used by courts "in ordinary litigation":
We considered the relative interests of the State and the
injured voters, and we evaluated the extent to which the
State's interests necessitated the contested restrictions.
Anderson, 460 U. S., at 789. Applying similar reasoning in
this case, the Ohio Supreme Court upheld $ 3599.09(A) as a
"reasonable" and "nondiscriminatory" burden on the rights
of voters. 67 Ohio St. 3d, at 396, 618 N. E. 2d, at 155, quoting Anderson, 460 U. S., at 788.

The "ordinary litigation" test does not apply here. Unlike
the statutory provisions challenged in Storer and Anderson,

$ 3599.09(A) of the Ohio Code does not control the mechanics
of the electoral process. It is a regulation of pure speech.
Moreover, even though this provision applies evenhandedly
to advocates of differing viewpoints,8 it is a direct regulation
of the content of speech. Every written document covered
by the statute must contain "the name and residence or business address of the chairman, treasurer, or secretary of the
organization issuing the same, or the person who issues,
makes, or is responsible therefor." Ohio Rev. Code Ann.

$ 3599.09(A) (1988). Furthermore, the category of covered
documents is defined by their content--only those publications containing speech designed to influence the voters in
an election need bear the required markings.9 Ibid. Consequently, we are not faced with an ordinary election restric8 Arguably, the disclosure requirement places a more significant burden
on advocates of unpopular causes than on defenders of the status quo.
For purposes of our analysis, however, we assume the statute evenhandedly burdens all speakers who have a legitimate interest in remaining
anonymous.

9 Covered documents are those "designed to promote the nomination or

election or defeat of a candidate, or to promote the adoption or defeat of
any issue, or to influence the voters in any election . . . ." $ 3599.09(A).

tion; this case "involves a limitation on political expressionsubject to exacting scrutiny."

Meyer v. Grant, 486 U. S. 414,
420 (1988).10Indeed, as we have explained on many prior occasions,

the category of speech regulated by the Ohio statute oc-cupies the core of the protection afforded by the First
Amendment:

"Discussion of public issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of thesystem of government established by our Constitution.

The First Amendment affords the broadest protection
to such political expression in order `to assure [the]unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about

of political and social changes desired by the people.'
Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476, 484 (1957). Although First Amendment protections are not confinedto `the exposition of ideas,'

Winters v. New York, 333
U. S. 507, 510 (1948), `there is practically universalagreement that a major purpose of that Amendment was

to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs,

Mills v. Alabama, 384 U. S. 214, 218 (1966). This no
more than reflects our `profound national commitment
to the principle that debate on public issues should be

Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191 (1992), although the law at issue--
forbidding campaign-related speech within 100 feet of the entrance to a
polling place--was an election-related restriction, both the plurality and
dissent applied strict scrutiny because the law was "a facially contentbased restriction on political speech in a public forum." Id., at 198; see

zenry to make informed choices among candidates foroffice is essential, for the identities of those who are

elected will inevitably shape the course that we followas a nation. As the Court observed in Monitor Patriot
Co. v. Roy, 401 U. S. 265, 272 (1971), `it can hardly bedoubted that the constitutional guarantee has its fullest
and most urgent application precisely to the conduct ofcampaigns for political office.' "

Buckley v. Valeo, 424U. S. 1, 14-15 (1976) (per curiam).

Of course, core political speech need not center on acandidate for office. The principles enunciated in Buckley
extend equally to issue-based elections such as the schooltax referendum that Mrs. McIntyre sought to influence
through her handbills. See First Nat. Bank of Bostonv. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 776-777 (1978) (speech on income
tax referendum "is at the heart of the First Amendment'sprotection"). Indeed, the speech in which Mrs. McIntyre
engaged--handing out leaflets in the advocacy of a politicallycontroversial viewpoint--is the essence of First Amendment
expression. See International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U. S. 672 (1992); Lovell v. City ofGriffin, 303 U. S. 444 (1938). That this advocacy occurred

in the heat of a controversial referendum vote only strength-ens the protection afforded to Mrs. McIntyre's expression:
Urgent, important, and effective speech can be no lessprotected than impotent speech, lest the right to speak be
relegated to those instances when it is least needed. See
Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U. S. 1, 4 (1949). No form ofspeech is entitled to greater constitutional protection than

Mrs. McIntyre's.When a law burdens core political speech, we apply "exacting scrutiny," and we uphold the restriction only if it is nar-rowly tailored to serve an overriding state interest. See,
e. g., Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 786. Our precedents thus makeabundantly clear that the Ohio Supreme Court applied a
significantly more lenient standard than is appropriate ina case of this kind.

Opinion of the Court

IV
Nevertheless, the State argues that, even under thestrictest standard of review, the disclosure requirement

in $ 3599.09(A) is justified by two important and legitimatestate interests. Ohio judges its interest in preventing
fraudulent and libelous statements and its interest in provid-ing the electorate with relevant information to be sufficiently
compelling to justify the anonymous speech ban. These twointerests necessarily overlap to some extent, but it is useful
to discuss them separately.Insofar as the interest in informing the electorate means
nothing more than the provision of additional informationthat may either buttress or undermine the argument in a
document, we think the identity of the speaker is no differentfrom other components of the document's content that the
author is free to include or exclude.11 We have already heldthat the State may not compel a newspaper that prints editorials critical of a particular candidate to provide space for areply by the candidate. Miami Herald Publishing Co. v.
Tornillo, 418 U. S. 241 (1974). The simple interest in pro-viding voters with additional relevant information does not
justify a state requirement that a writer make statements ordisclosures she would otherwise omit. Moreover, in the
case of a handbill written by a private citizen who is notknown to the recipient, the name and address of the author
add little, if anything, to the reader's ability to evaluate the

11 "Of course, the identity of the source is helpful in evaluating ideas.
But `the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted
in the competition of the market' (Abrams v. United States, [250 U. S. 616,
630 (1919) (Holmes, J., dissenting)]). Don't underestimate the common
man. People are intelligent enough to evaluate the source of an anonymous writing. They can see it is anonymous. They know it is anonymous. They can evaluate its anonymity along with its message, as long
as they are permitted, as they must be, to read that message. And then,
once they have done so, it is for them to decide what is `responsible', what
is valuable, and what is truth." New York v. Duryea, 76 Misc. 2d 948,
966-967, 351 N. Y. S. 2d 978, 996 (1974) (striking down similar New York

document's message. Thus, Ohio's informational interestis plainly insufficient to support the constitutionality of its

disclosure requirement.The state interest in preventing fraud and libel stands
on a different footing. We agree with Ohio's submission
that this interest carries special weight during election cam-paigns when false statements, if credited, may have serious

adverse consequences for the public at large. Ohio does not,
however, rely solely on $ 3599.09(A) to protect that interest.
Its Election Code includes detailed and specific prohibitions
against making or disseminating false statements during
political campaigns. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. $$ 3599.09.1(B),
3599.09.2(B) (1988). These regulations apply both to candidate elections and to issue-driven ballot measures.12 Thus,

12 Section 3599.09.1(B) provides:
"No person, during the course of any campaign for nomination or election to public office or office of a political party, by means of campaign
materials, including sample ballots, an advertisement on radio or television
or in a newspaper or periodical, a public speech, press release, or otherwise, shall knowingly and with intent to affect the outcome of such campaign do any of the following:

"(1) Use the title of an office not currently held by a candidate in a manner
that implies that the candidate does currently hold that office or use the
term `re-elect' when the candidate has never been elected at a primary,
general, or special election to the office for which he is a candidate;

"(2) Make a false statement concerning the formal schooling or training
completed or attempted by a candidate; a degree, diploma, certificate,
scholarship, grant, award, prize, or honor received, earned, or held by a
candidate; or the period of time during which a candidate attended any
school, college, community technical school, or institution;

"(3) Make a false statement concerning the professional, occupational,
or vocational licenses held by a candidate, or concerning any position the
candidate held for which he received a salary or wages;

"(4) Make a false statement that a candidate or public official has been
indicted or convicted of a theft offense, extortion, or other crime involving
financial corruption or moral turpitude;

this section, `voting record' means the recorded `yes' or `no' vote on a bill,
ordinance, resolution, motion, amendment, or confirmation."

Section 3599.09.2(B) provides:

"No person, during the course of any campaign in advocacy of or in opposition to the adoption of any ballot proposition or issue, by means of campaign material, including sample ballots, an advertisement on radio or television or in a newspaper or periodical, a public speech, a press release, or
otherwise, shall knowingly and with intent to affect the outcome of such
campaign do any of the following:

"(1) Falsely identify the source of a statement, issue statements under
the name of another person without authorization, or falsely state the endorsement of or opposition to a ballot proposition or issue by a person
or publication;

"(2) Post, publish, circulate, distribute, or otherwise disseminate, a false
statement, either knowing the same to be false or acting with reckless
disregard of whether it was false or not, that is designed to promote the
adoption or defeat of any ballot proposition or issue." $ 3599.09.2(B).

We need not, of course, evaluate the constitutionality of these provisions. We quote them merely to emphasize that Ohio has addressed directly the problem of election fraud. To the extent the anonymity ban
indirectly seeks to vindicate the same goals, it is merely a supplement to
the above provisions.

13 The same can be said with regard to "libel," as many of the above-quoted

Election Code provisions prohibit false statements about candidates. To
the extent those provisions may be underinclusive, Ohio courts also

Opinion of the Court
to the making of false statements by unscrupulous prevaricators. Although these ancillary benefits are assuredly legitimate, we are not persuaded that they justify $ 3599.09(A)'s
extremely broad prohibition.

As this case demonstrates, the prohibition encompasses
documents that are not even arguably false or misleading.
It applies not only to the activities of candidates and their
organized supporters, but also to individuals acting independently and using only their own modest resources.14 It
applies not only to elections of public officers, but also to

enforce the common-law tort of defamation. See, e. g., Varanese v. Gall,
35 Ohio St. 3d 78, 518 N. E. 2d 1177 (1988) (applying the standard of New
York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964), to an Ohio public official's
state-law libel claim arising from an election-related advertisement).
Like other forms of election fraud, then, Ohio directly attacks the problem
of election-related libel; to the extent that the anonymity ban serves the
same interest, it is merely a supplement.

14 We stressed the importance of this distinction in Buckley v. Valeo,

424 U. S. 1, 37 (1976):
"Treating these expenses [the expenses incurred by campaign volunteers]
as contributions when made to the candidate's campaign or at the direction
of the candidate or his staff forecloses an avenue of abuse without limiting
actions voluntarily undertaken by citizens independently of a candidate's
campaign." (Footnote omitted.)

Again, in striking down the independent expenditure limitations of the
Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, 18 U. S. C. $ 608(e)(1) (1970 ed.,
Supp. IV) (repealed 1976), we distinguished another section of the statute
($ 608(b), which we upheld) that placed a ceiling on contributions to a political campaign.

"By contrast, $ 608(e)(1) limits expenditures for express advocacy of candidates made totally independently of the candidate and his campaign. Unlike contributions, such independent expenditures may well provide little
assistance to the candidate's campaign and indeed may prove counterproductive. The absence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate or his agent not only undermines the value of the
expenditure to the candidate, but also alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as a quid pro quo for improper commitments from
the candidate. Rather than preventing circumvention of the contribution
limitations, $ 608(e)(1) severely restricts all independent advocacy despite
its substantially diminished potential for abuse." 424 U. S., at 47.

the character or strength of the author's interest in anonymity. Moreover, as this case also demonstrates, the absence

Election Code. Nor has the State explained why it can

United States v. CIO, [335 U. S. 106 (1948)], simply is not present in a
popular vote on a public issue." First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,
435 U. S. 765, 790 (1978) (footnote omitted).

16 As the Illinois Supreme Court explained in People v. White, 116 Ill.

2d 171, 180, 506 N. E. 2d 1284, 1288 (Ill. 1987), which struck down a similar statute:

"Implicit in the State's . . . justification is the concern that the public could
be misinformed and an election swayed on the strength of an eleventhhour anonymous smear campaign to which the candidate could not meaningfully respond. The statute cannot be upheld on this ground, however,
because it sweeps within its net a great deal of anonymous speech completely unrelated to this concern. In the first place, the statute has no
time limit and applies to literature circulated two months prior to an election as well as that distributed two days before. The statute also prohibits anonymous literature supporting or opposing not only candidates, but
also referenda. A public question clearly cannot be the victim of character assassination."

The temporal breadth of the Ohio statute also distinguishes it from the
Tennessee law that we upheld in Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191 (1992).
The Tennessee statute forbade electioneering within 100 feet of the entrance to a polling place. It applied only on election day. The State's
interest in preventing voter intimidation and election fraud was therefore
enhanced by the need to prevent last-minute misinformation to which
there is no time to respond. Moreover, Tennessee geographically confined the reach of its law to a 100-foot no-solicitation zone. By contrast,
the Ohio law forbids anonymous campaign speech wherever it occurs.

more easily enforce the direct bans on disseminating falsedocuments against anonymous authors and distributors than

against wrongdoers who might use false names and ad-dresses in an attempt to avoid detection. We recognize that
a State's enforcement interest might justify a more limitedidentification requirement, but Ohio has shown scant cause
for inhibiting the leafletting at issue here.

V
Finally, Ohio vigorously argues that our opinions in FirstNat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765 (1978), and

Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976) (per curiam), amplysupport the constitutionality of its disclosure requirement.
Neither case is controlling: The former concerned the scopeof First Amendment protection afforded to corporations; the
relevant portion of the latter concerned mandatory disclo-sure of campaign-related expenditures. Neither case involved a prohibition of anonymous campaign literature.In

Bellotti, we reversed a judgment of the Supreme Judi-cial Court of Massachusetts sustaining a state law that prohibited corporate expenditures designed to influence the voteon referendum proposals. 435 U. S. 765. The Massachusetts court had held that the First Amendment protects cor-porate speech only if its message pertains directly to the
business interests of the corporation. Id., at 771-772. Con-sistently with our holding today, we noted that the "inherent
worth of the speech in terms of its capacity for informing thepublic does not depend upon the identity of its source,
whether corporation, association, union, or individual." Id.,at 777. We also made it perfectly clear that we were not
deciding whether the First Amendment's protection of cor-porate speech is coextensive with the protection it affords to
individuals.17 Accordingly, although we commented in dicta

17 "In deciding whether this novel and restrictive gloss on the First
Amendment comports with the Constitution and the precedents of this
Court, we need not survey the outer boundaries of the Amendment's pro514us2$46i $U46 05-27-98 16:42:00 PAGES OPLGxPGT

Opinion of the Court
on the prophylactic effect of requiring identification of thesource of corporate advertising,

18 that footnote did not necessarily apply to independent communications by an individuallike Mrs. McIntyre.

Our reference in the Bellotti footnote to the "prophylacticeffect" of disclosure requirements cited a portion of our earlier opinion in Buckley, in which we stressed the importanceof providing "the electorate with information `as to where
political campaign money comes from and how it is spentby the candidate.' " 424 U. S., at 66. We observed that the
"sources of a candidate's financial support also alert the voterto the interests to which a candidate is most likely to be
responsive and thus facilitate predictions of future perform-ance in office." Id., at 67. Those comments concerned contributions to the candidate or expenditures authorized by thecandidate or his responsible agent. They had no reference
to the kind of independent activity pursued by Mrs. Mc-Intyre. Required disclosures about the level of financial
support a candidate has received from various sources aresupported by an interest in avoiding the appearance of
corruption that has no application to this case.
tection of corporate speech, or address the abstract question whether corporations have the full measure of rights that individuals enjoy under the
First Amendment." Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 777-778.

In a footnote to that passage, we continued:
"Nor is there any occasion to consider in this case whether, under different circumstances, a justification for a restriction on speech that would
be inadequate as applied to individuals might suffice to sustain the same
restriction as applied to corporations, unions, or like entities." Id., at
777-778, n. 13.

18 "Corporate advertising, unlike some methods of participation in political campaigns, is likely to be highly visible. Identification of the source
of advertising may be required as a means of disclosure, so that the people
will be able to evaluate the arguments to which they are being subjected.
See Buckley, 424 U. S., at 66-67; United States v. Harriss, 347 U. S. 612,
625-626 (1954). In addition, we emphasized in Buckley the prophylactic
effect of requiring that the source of communication be disclosed. 424
U. S., at 67." Id., at 792, n. 32.

Opinion of the Court
True, in another portion of the Buckley opinion we ex-pressed approval of a requirement that even "independent

expenditures" in excess of a threshold level be reported tothe Federal Election Commission. Id., at 75-76. But that
requirement entailed nothing more than an identification tothe Commission of the amount and use of money expended in
support of a candidate. See id., at 157-159, 160 (reproducingrelevant portions of the statute

19 ). Though such mandatory

reporting undeniably impedes protected First Amendmentactivity, the intrusion is a far cry from compelled selfidentification on all election-related writings. A writtenelection-related document--particularly a leaflet--is often a
personally crafted statement of a political viewpoint. Mrs.McIntyre's handbills surely fit that description. As such,
identification of the author against her will is particularlyintrusive; it reveals unmistakably the content of her
thoughts on a controversial issue. Disclosure of an expendi-ture and its use, without more, reveals far less information.
It may be information that a person prefers to keep secret,and undoubtedly it often gives away something about the
spender's political views. Nonetheless, even though moneymay "talk," its speech is less specific, less personal, and less
provocative than a handbill--and as a result, when money
supports an unpopular viewpoint it is less likely to precipi-tate retaliation.

19 One of those provisions, addressing contributions by campaign committees, required:

"the identification of each person to whom expenditures have been made
by such committee or on behalf of such committee or candidate within the
calendar year in an aggregate amount or value in excess of $100, the
amount, date, and purpose of each such expenditure and the name and
address of, and office sought by, each candidate on whose behalf such expenditure was made." 2 U. S. C. $ 434(b)(9) (1970 ed., Supp. IV) (reprinted
in Buckley, 424 U. S., at 158).

A separate provision, 2 U. S. C. $ 434(e) (1970 ed., Supp. IV) (reprinted
in Buckley, 424 U. S., at 160), required individuals making contributions
or expenditures to file statements containing the same information.

356 McINTYRE v. OHIO ELECTIONS COMM'N

Opinion of the Court
Not only is the Ohio statute's infringement on speech more
intrusive than the Buckley disclosure requirement, but it
rests on different and less powerful state interests. The
Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, at issue in Buckley,
regulates only candidate elections, not referenda or other
issue-based ballot measures; and we construed "independent
expenditures" to mean only those expenditures that "expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified
candidate." Id., at 80. In candidate elections, the Government can identify a compelling state interest in avoiding the
corruption that might result from campaign expenditures.
Disclosure of expenditures lessens the risk that individuals
will spend money to support a candidate as a quid pro quo
for special treatment after the candidate is in office. Curriers of favor will be deterred by the knowledge that all expenditures will be scrutinized by the Federal Election Commission and by the public for just this sort of abuse.20
Moreover, the federal Act contains numerous legitimate disclosure requirements for campaign organizations; the similar
requirements for independent expenditures serve to ensure
that a campaign organization will not seek to evade disclosure by routing its expenditures through individual supporters. See Buckley, 424 U. S., at 76. In short, although
Buckley may permit a more narrowly drawn statute, it
surely is not authority for upholding Ohio's open-ended
provision.21

20 This interest also serves to distinguish United States v. Harriss, 347
U. S. 612 (1954), in which we upheld limited disclosure requirements for
lobbyists. The activities of lobbyists who have direct access to elected
representatives, if undisclosed, may well present the appearance of
corruption.

21 We note here also that the federal Act, while constitutional on its face,

may not be constitutional in all its applications. Cf. Brown v. Socialist
Workers '74 Campaign Comm. (Ohio), 459 U. S. 87, 88 (1982) (holding Ohio

Opinion of the Court

VI
Under our Constitution, anonymous pamphleteering is nota pernicious, fraudulent practice, but an honorable tradition

of advocacy and of dissent. Anonymity is a shield from thetyranny of the majority. See generally J. Mill, On Liberty
and Considerations on Representative Government 1, 3-4(R. McCallum ed. 1947). It thus exemplifies the purpose
behind the Bill of Rights, and of the First Amendment inparticular: to protect unpopular individuals from retaliation--and their ideas from suppression--at the hand of anintolerant society. The right to remain anonymous may be
abused when it shields fraudulent conduct. But politicalspeech by its nature will sometimes have unpalatable consequences, and, in general, our society accords greater weightto the value of free speech than to the dangers of its misuse.
See Abrams v. United States, 250 U. S. 616, 630-631 (1919)(Holmes, J., dissenting). Ohio has not shown that its interest in preventing the misuse of anonymous election-relatedspeech justifies a prohibition of all uses of that speech. The
State may, and does, punish fraud directly. But it cannotseek to punish fraud indirectly by indiscriminately outlawing
a category of speech, based on its content, with no necessaryrelationship to the danger sought to be prevented. One
would be hard pressed to think of a better example of thepitfalls of Ohio's blunderbuss approach than the facts of the
case before us.The judgment of the Ohio Supreme Court is reversed.

Justice Ginsburg, concurring.
The dissent is stirring in its appreciation of democraticvalues. But I do not see the Court's opinion as unguided

by "bedrock principle," tradition, or our case law. See post,at 375-378, 378-380. Margaret McIntyre's case, it seems to
me, bears a marked resemblance to Margaret Gilleo's case 1
and Mary Grace's.2 All three decisions, I believe, are sound,and hardly sensational, applications of our First Amendment jurisprudence.

In for a calf is not always in for a cow. The Court's deci-sion finds unnecessary, overintrusive, and inconsistent with

American ideals the State's imposition of a fine on an individ-ual leafleteer who, within her local community, spoke her
mind, but sometimes not her name. We do not thereby holdthat the State may not in other, larger circumstances require
the speaker to disclose its interest by disclosing its identity.Appropriately leaving open matters not presented by McIntyre's handbills, the Court recognizes that a State's interest
in protecting an election process "might justify a more lim-ited identification requirement."

Ante, at 353. But the
Court has convincingly explained why Ohio lacks "cause forinhibiting the leafletting at issue here."

ferent methodology to this case. Instead of asking whether"an honorable tradition" of anonymous speech has existed

throughout American history, or what the "value" of anony-mous speech might be, we should determine whether the
phrase "freedom of speech, or of the press," as originallyunderstood, protected anonymous political leafletting. I
believe that it did. I

The First Amendment states that the government "shallmake no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the
press." U. S. Const., Amdt. 1. When interpreting the FreeSpeech and Press Clauses, we must be guided by their original meaning, for "[t]he Constitution is a written instrument.As such its meaning does not alter. That which it meant
when adopted, it means now." South Carolina v. United
States, 199 U. S. 437, 448 (1905). We have long recognizedthat the meaning of the Constitution "must necessarily depend on the words of the constitution [and] the meaning andintention of the convention which framed and proposed it for
adoption and ratification to the conventions . . . in the severalstates."

Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657, 721(1838). See also INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 959 (1983).

We should seek the original understanding when we inter-pret the Speech and Press Clauses, just as we do when we
read the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment. Whenthe Framers did not discuss the precise question at issue, we
have turned to "what history reveals was the contemporaneous understanding of [the Establishment Clause's] guaran-tees."

Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, 673 (1984). "[T]he
line we must draw between the permissible and the impermissible is one which accords with history and faithfully re-flects the understanding of the Founding Fathers."

II
Unfortunately, we have no record of discussions of anony-mous political expression either in the First Congress, which

drafted the Bill of Rights, or in the state ratifying conven-tions. Thus, our analysis must focus on the practices and
beliefs held by the Founders concerning anonymous politicalarticles and pamphlets. As an initial matter, we can safely
maintain that the leaflets at issue in this case implicate thefreedom of the press. When the Framers thought of the
press, they did not envision the large, corporate newspaperand television establishments of our modern world. Instead, they employed the term "the press" to refer to themany independent printers who circulated small newspapers
or published writers' pamphlets for a fee. See generally B.Bailyn & J. Hench, The Press & the American Revolution
(1980); L. Levy, Emergence of a Free Press (1985); B. Bailyn,The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution (1967).
"It was in this form--as pamphlets--that much of the mostimportant and characteristic writing of the American Revolution occurred." 1 B. Bailyn, Pamphlets of the AmericanRevolution 3 (1965). This practice continued during the
struggle for ratification. See, e. g., Pamphlets on the Consti-tution of the United States (P. Ford ed. 1888). Regardless
of whether one designates the right involved here as oneof press or one of speech, however, it makes little difference
in terms of our analysis, which seeks to determine onlywhether the First Amendment, as originally understood,
protects anonymous writing.There is little doubt that the Framers engaged in anonymous political writing. The essays in the Federalist Papers,published under the pseudonym of "Publius," are only the
most famous example of the outpouring of anonymous politi-cal writing that occurred during the ratification of the Constitution. Of course, the simple fact that the Framers en-gaged in certain conduct does not necessarily prove that they
forbade its prohibition by the government. See post, at 373

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
(Scalia, J., dissenting). In this case, however, the historicalevidence indicates that Founding-era Americans opposed

attempts to require that anonymous authors reveal theiridentities on the ground that forced disclosure violated the
"freedom of the press."

For example, the earliest and most famous American expe-rience with freedom of the press, the 1735 Zenger trial, centered around anonymous political pamphlets. The case in-volved a printer, John Peter Zenger, who refused to reveal
the anonymous authors of published attacks on the CrownGovernor of New York. When the Governor and his council
could not discover the identity of the authors, they prosecuted Zenger himself for seditious libel. See J. Alexander,
A Brief Narrative of the Case and Trial of John Peter Zenger
9-19 (S. Katz ed. 1972). Although the case set the Colonies
afire for its example of a jury refusing to convict a defendant
of seditious libel against Crown authorities, it also signified
at an early moment the extent to which anonymity and the
freedom of the press were intertwined in the early American mind.

During the Revolutionary and Ratification periods, the
Framers' understanding of the relationship between anonymity and freedom of the press became more explicit. In
1779, for example, the Continental Congress attempted to
discover the identity of an anonymous article in the Pennsylvania Packet signed by the name "Leonidas." Leonidas,
who actually was Dr. Benjamin Rush, had attacked the Members of Congress for causing inflation throughout the States
and for engaging in embezzelment and fraud. 13 Letters of
Delegates to Congress 1774-1789, p. 141, n. 1 (G. Gawalt &
R. Gephart eds. 1986). Elbridge Gerry, a delegate from
Massachusetts, moved to haul the printer of the newspaper
before Congress to answer questions concerning Leonidas.
Several Members of Congress then rose to oppose Gerry's
motion on the ground that it invaded the freedom of the
press. Merriweather Smith of Virginia rose, quoted from

the offending article with approval, and then finished with
a declaration that "[w]hen the liberty of the Press shall be
restrained . . . the liberties of the People will be at an end."
Henry Laurens, Notes of Debates, July 3, 1779, id., at 139.
Supporting Smith, John Penn of North Carolina argued that
the writer "no doubt had good designs," and that "[t]he liberty of the Press ought not to be restrained." Ibid. In the
end, these arguments persuaded the assembled delegates,
who "sat mute" in response to Gerry's motion. Id., at 141.
Neither the printer nor Dr. Rush ever appeared before Congress to answer for their publication. D. Teeter, Press
Freedom and the Public Printing: Pennsylvania, 1775-83, 45
Journalism Q. 445, 451 (1968).

At least one of the state legislatures shared Congress'
view that the freedom of the press protected anonymous
writing. Also in 1779, the upper house of the New Jersey
State Legislature attempted to punish the author of a satirical attack on the Governor and the College of New Jersey
(now Princeton) who had signed his work "Cincinnatus." R.
Hixson, Isaac Collins: A Quaker Printer in 18th Century
America 95 (1968). Attempting to enforce the crime of seditious libel, the State Legislative Council ordered Isaac Collins--the printer and editor of the newspaper in which the
article had appeared--to reveal the author's identity. Refusing, Collins declared: " `Were I to comply . . . I conceive I
should betray the trust reposed in me, and be far from acting
as a faithful guardian of the Liberty of the Press.' " Id., at
96. Apparently, the State Assembly agreed that anonymity
was protected by the freedom of the press, as it voted to
support the editor and publisher by frustrating the council's
orders. Id., at 95.

By 1784, the same Governor of New Jersey, William
Livingston, was at work writing anonymous articles that
defended the right to publish anonymously as part of the
freedom of the press. Under the pseudonym "Scipio,"

Livingston wrote several articles attacking the legislature's
failure to lower taxes, and he accused a state officer of stealing or losing state funds during the British invasion of New
Jersey. Id., at 107-109; Scipio, Letter to the Printer, Feb.
24, 1784, The New-Jersey Gazette. Responding to the allegations, the officer called upon Scipio "to avow your publication, give up your real name." S. Tucker, To Scipio, Mar. 2,
1784, The New-Jersey Gazette. Livingston replied with a
four-part series defending "the Liberty of the Press." Although Livingston at first defended anonymity because it encouraged authors to discuss politics without fear of reprisal,
he ultimately invoked the liberty of the press as the guardian
for anonymous political writing. "I hope [Tucker] is not seriously bent upon a total subversion of our political system,"
Scipio wrote. "And pray may not a man, in a free country,
convey thro' the press his sentiments on publick grievances
. . . without being obliged to send a certified copy of the
baptismal register to prove his name." Scipio, On the Liberty of the Press IV, Apr. 26, 1784, The New-Jersey Gazette.

To be sure, there was some controversy among newspaper
editors over publishing anonymous articles and pamphlets.
But this controversy was resolved in a manner that indicates
that the freedom of the press protected an author's anonymity. The tempest began when a Federalist, writing anonymously himself, expressed fear that "emissaries" of "foreign
enemies" would attempt to scuttle the Constitution by "fill[ing] the press with objections" against the proposal. Boston Independent Chronicle, Oct. 4, 1787, in 13 Documentary
History of the Ratification of the Constitution 315 (J. Kaminski & G. Saladino eds. 1981) (hereinafter Documentary History). He called upon printers to refrain from publishing
when the author "chooses to remain concealed." Ibid.
Benjamin Russell, the editor of the prominent Federalist
newspaper the Massachusetts Centinel, immediately adopted
a policy of refusing to publish Anti-Federalist pieces unless the

author provided his identity to be "handed to the publick, if
required." Massachusetts Centinel, Oct. 10, 1787, id., at
312, 315-316. A few days later, the Massachusetts Gazette
announced that it would emulate the example set by the
Massachusetts Centinel. Massachusetts Gazette, Oct. 16,
1787, id., at 317. In the same issue, the Gazette carried an
article claiming that requiring an anonymous writer to leave
his name with the printer, so that anyone who wished to
know his identity could be informed, "appears perfectly reasonable, and is perfectly consistent with the liberty of the
press." A Citizen, Massachusetts Gazette, Oct. 16, 1787, id.,
at 316. Federalists expressed similar thoughts in Philadelphia. See A Philadelphia Mechanic, Philadelphia Independent Gazetteer, Oct. 29, 1787, id., at 318-319; Galba, Philadelphia Independent Gazetteer, Oct. 31, 1787, id., at 319. The
Jewel, Philadelphia Independent Gazetteer, Nov. 2, 1787, id.,
at 320.

Ordinarily, the fact that some founding-era editors as a
matter of policy decided not to publish anonymous articles
would seem to shed little light upon what the Framers
thought the government could do. The widespread criticism
raised by the Anti-Federalists, however, who were the driving force behind the demand for a Bill of Rights, indicates
that they believed the freedom of the press to include the
right to author anonymous political articles and pamphlets.1
That most other Americans shared this understanding is reflected in the Federalists' hasty retreat before the withering
criticism of their assault on the liberty of the press.

Opposition to Russell's declaration centered in Philadelphia. Three Philadelphia papers published the "Citizen"
piece that had run in the Massachusetts Gazette. Id., at

1 The Anti-Federalists recognized little difficulty in what today would
be a state-action problem, because they considered Federalist conduct in
supporting the Constitution as a preview of the tyranny to come under
the new Federal Government.

318-320.2 In response, one of the leading Anti-Federalistwriters, the "Federal Farmer," attacked Russell's policy:

"What can be the views of those gentlemen in Boston, whocountenanced the Printers in shutting up the press against
a fair and free investigation of this important system in the
usual way?" Letters From the Federal Farmer No. 5, Oct.13, 1787, in 2 The Complete Anti-Federalist 254 (H. Storing

ed. 1981). Another Anti-Federalist, "Philadelphiensis," alsolaunched a substantial attack on Russell and his defenders
for undermining the freedom of the press. "In this desper-ate situation of affairs . . . the friends of this despotic scheme
of government, were driven to the last and only alternativefrom which there was any probability of success; namely, the
abolition of the freedom of the Press." Philadelphiensis,
Essay I, Independent Gazetteer, Nov. 7, 1787, 3 id., at 102.In Philadelphiensis' eyes, Federalist attempts to suppress

the Anti-Federalist press by requiring the disclosure of authors' identities only foreshadowed the oppression permitted
by the new Constitution. "Here we see pretty plainly
through [the Federalists'] excellent regulation of the press,
how things are to be carried on after the adoption of the new
constitution." Id., at 103. According to Philadelphiensis,
Federalist policies had already ruined freedom in Massachusetts: "In Boston the liberty of the press is now completely
abolished; and hence all other privileges and rights of the
people will in a short time be destroyed." Id., at 104.

Not limited to Philadelphia, the Anti-Federalist attack was
repeated widely throughout the States. In New York, one
writer exclaimed that the Federalist effort to suppress ano2 As noted earlier, several pieces in support appeared in the Federalist
newspaper, the Philadelphia Independent Gazetteer. They were immediately answered by two Anti-Federalists in the Philadelphia Freeman's
Journal. These Anti-Federalists accused the Federalists of "preventing
that freedom of enquiry which truth and honour never dreads, but which
tyrants and tyranny could never endure." 13 Documentary History
317-318.

nymity would "reverse the important doctrine of the freedom of the press," whose "truth" was "universally acknowledged." Detector, New York Journal, Oct. 25, 1787, in 13Documentary History 318. "Detector" proceeded to proclaim that Russell's policy was "the introduction of this first
trait of slavery into your country!" Ibid. Responding tothe Federalist editorial policy, a Rhode Island AntiFederalist wrote: "The Liberty of the Press, or the Libertywhich

every Person in the United States at present enjoys
. . . is a Privilege of infinite Importance . . . for which . . . wehave fought and bled," and that the attempt by "our aristocratical Gentry, to have every Person's Name published who
should write against the proposed Federal Constitution, has
given many of us a just Alarm." Argus, Providence United
States Chronicle, Nov. 8, 1787, id., at 320-321. Edward
Powars, editor of the Anti-Federalist Boston American Herald, proclaimed that his pages would remain "free and open
to all parties." Boston American Herald, Oct. 15, 1787, id.,
at 316. In the Boston Independent Chronicle of Oct. 18,
1787, "Solon" accused Russell of attempting to undermine a
"freedom and independence of sentiments" which "should
never be checked in a free country" and was "so essential to
the existance of free Governments." Id., at 313.

The controversy over Federalist attempts to prohibit
anonymous political speech is significant for several reasons.
First, the Anti-Federalists clearly believed the right to author and publish anonymous political articles and pamphlets
was protected by the liberty of the press. Second, although
printers' editorial policies did not constitute state action, the
Anti-Federalists believed that the Federalists were merely
flexing the governmental powers they would fully exercise
upon the Constitution's ratification. Third, and perhaps
most significantly, it appears that the Federalists agreed
with the Anti-Federalist critique. In Philadelphia, where
opposition to the ban was strongest, there is no record that
any newspaper adopted the nonanonymity policy, nor that of

any city or State aside from Russell's Massachusetts Centineland the Federalist Massachusetts Gazette. Moreover, these

two papers' bark was worse than their bite. In the face ofwidespread criticism, it appears that Russell retreated from
his policy and, as he put it, " `readily' " reprinted severalanonymous Federalist and Anti-Federalist essays to show
that claims that he had suppressed freedom of the press" `had not any foundation in truth.' " 13 Documentary History 313-314. Likewise, the Massachusetts Gazette refusedto release the names of Anti-Federalist writers when requested. Ibid. When Federalist attempts to ban anonym-ity are followed by a sharp, widespread Anti-Federalist defense in the name of the freedom of the press, and then byan open Federalist retreat on the issue, I must conclude that
both Anti-Federalists and Federalists believed that the free-dom of the press included the right to publish without revealing the author's name. III

The historical record is not as complete or as full as Iwould desire. For example, there is no evidence that, after
the adoption of the First Amendment, the Federal Govern-ment attempted to require writers to attach their names to
political documents. Nor do we have any indication that thefederal courts of the early Republic would have squashed
such an effort as a violation of the First Amendment. Theunderstanding described above, however, when viewed in
light of the Framers' universal practice of publishing anony-mous articles and pamphlets, indicates that the Framers
shared the belief that such activity was firmly part of thefreedom of the press. It is only an innovation of modern
times that has permitted the regulation of anonymousspeech.

The large quantity of newspapers and pamphlets theFramers produced during the various crises of their generation show the remarkable extent to which the Framers reliedupon anonymity. During the break with Great Britain, the

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
revolutionaries employed pseudonyms both to conceal their
identity from Crown authorities and to impart a message.
Often, writers would choose names to signal their point of
view or to invoke specific classical and modern "crusaders in
an agelong struggle against tyranny." A. Schlesinger, Prelude to Independence 35 (1958). Thus, leaders of the struggle for independence would adopt descriptive names such as
"Common Sense," a "Farmer," or "A True Patriot," or historical ones such as "Cato" (a name used by many to refer to
the Roman Cato and to Cato's letters), or "Mucius Scaevola."
Id., at xii-xiii. The practice was even more prevalent during the great outpouring of political argument and commentary that accompanied the ratification of the Constitution.
Besides "Publius," prominent Federalists signed their
articles and pamphlets with names such as "An American
Citizen," "Marcus," "A Landholder," "Americanus"; AntiFederalists replied with the pseudonyms "Cato," "Centinel,"
"Brutus," the "Federal Farmer," and "The Impartial Examiner." See generally 1-2 Debate on the Constitution (B. Bailyn ed. 1993). The practice of publishing one's thoughts
anonymously or under pseudonym was so widespread that
only two major Federalist or Anti-Federalist pieces appear
to have been signed by their true authors, and they may
have had special reasons to do so.3

If the practice of publishing anonymous articles and pamphlets fell into disuse after the Ratification, one might infer
that the custom of anonymous political speech arose only in
response to the unusual conditions of the 1776-1787 period.

1787, 1 Debate on the Constitution 345 (B. Bailyn ed. 1993); Martin, The

631. Both men may have made an exception to the general practice because they both had attended the Philadelphia Convention, but had refused to sign the Constitution. As leaders of the fight against ratification,
both men may have believed that they owed a personal explanation to
their constituents of their decision not to sign.

After all, the Revolution and the Ratification were not "elections," per se, either for candidates or for discrete issues.
Records from the first federal elections indicate, however,
that anonymous political pamphlets and newspaper articles
remained the favorite media for expressing views on candidates. In Pennsylvania, for example, writers for or against
the Federalist and Anti-Federalist candidates wrote under
the names "Numa," "Pompilius," "A Friend to Agriculture,
Trade, and Good Laws," "A Federal Centinel," a "Freeman,"
"Centinel," "A Real Patriot to All True Federalists," "A Mechanic," "Justice," "A German Federalist," and so on. See
generally 1 Documentary History of the First Federal Elections 1788-1790, pp. 246-362 (M. Jensen & R. Becker eds.
1976). This appears to have been the practice in all of the
major States of which we have substantial records today.
See 1 id., at 446-464 (Massachusetts); 2 id., at 108-122, 175-
229 (Maryland); 2 id., at 387-397 (Virginia); 3 id., at 204-216,
436-493 (New York). It seems that actual names were used
rarely, and usually only by candidates who wanted to explain
their positions to the electorate.

The use of anonymous writing extended to issues as well
as candidates. The ratification of the Constitution was not
the only issue discussed via anonymous writings in the press.
James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, for example, resorted to pseudonyms in the famous "Helvidius" and "Pacificus" debates over President Washington's declaration of
neutrality in the war between the British and French. See
Hamilton, Pacificus No. 1, June 29, 1793, in 15 Papers of Alexander Hamilton 33-43 (H. Syrett ed. 1969); Madison, Helvidius No. 1, Aug. 24, 1793, in 15 Papers of James Madison 66-73
(T. Mason, R. Rutland, J. Sisson eds. 1985). Anonymous
writings continued in such Republican papers as the Aurora
and Federalists organs such as the Gazette of the United
States at least until the election of Thomas Jefferson. See
generally J. Smith, Freedom's Fetters (1956).

This evidence leads me to agree with the majority's result,but not its reasoning. The majority fails to seek the original

understanding of the First Amendment, and instead at-tempts to answer the question in this case by resorting to
three approaches. First, the majority recalls the historicalpractice of anonymous writing from Shakespeare's works to
the Federalist Papers to Mark Twain. Ante, at 341, and n. 4,342-343, and n. 6, 357. Second, it finds that anonymous
speech has an expressive value both to the speaker and tosociety that outweighs public interest in disclosure. Third,
it finds that $ 3599.09(A) cannot survive strict scrutinybecause it is a "content-based" restriction on speech.

I cannot join the majority's analysis because it deviatesfrom our settled approach to interpreting the Constitution
and because it superimposes its modern theories concerningexpression upon the constitutional text. Whether "great
works of literature"--by Voltaire or George Eliot have beenpublished anonymously should be irrelevant to our analysis,
because it sheds no light on what the phrases "free speech"or "free press" meant to the people who drafted and ratified
the First Amendment. Similarly, whether certain types ofexpression have "value" today has little significance; what

isimportant is whether the Framers in 1791 believed anonymous speech sufficiently valuable to deserve the protectionof the Bill of Rights. And although the majority faithfully
follows our approach to "content-based" speech regulations,we need not undertake this analysis when the original understanding provides the answer.While, like

Justice Scalia, I am loath to overturn a cen-tury of practice shared by almost all of the States, I believe

the historical evidence from the framing outweighs recenttradition. When interpreting other provisions of the Constitution, this Court has believed itself bound by the text ofthe Constitution and by the intent of those who drafted and
ratified it. It should hold itself to no less a standard when

interpreting the Speech and Press Clauses. After review-ing the weight of the historical evidence, it seems that the

Framers understood the First Amendment to protect anauthor's right to express his thoughts on political candidates
or issues in an anonymous fashion. Because the majorityhas adopted an analysis that is largely unconnected to
the Constitution's text and history, I concur only in thejudgment.

Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice joins,dissenting.
At a time when both political branches of Government andboth political parties reflect a popular desire to leave more
decisionmaking authority to the States, today's decisionmoves in the opposite direction, adding to the legacy of inflexible central mandates (irrevocable even by Congress) im-posed by this Court's constitutional jurisprudence. In an
opinion which reads as though it is addressing some peculiarlaw like the Los Angeles municipal ordinance at issue in

Talley v. California, 362 U. S. 60 (1960), the Court invalidates aspecies of protection for the election process that exists, in a

variety of forms, in every State except California, and thathas a pedigree dating back to the end of the 19th century.
Preferring the views of the English utilitarian philosopherJohn Stuart Mill, ante, at 357, to the considered judgment of
the American people's elected representatives from coast tocoast, the Court discovers a hitherto unknown right-to-beunknown while engaging in electoral politics. I dissent fromthis imposition of free-speech imperatives that are demonstrably not those of the American people today, and thatthere is inadequate reason to believe were those of the society that begat the First Amendment or the Fourteenth.

The question posed by the present case is not the easiestsort to answer for those who adhere to the Court's (and the

society's) traditional view that the Constitution bears its
original meaning and is unchanging. Under that view, "[o]n
every question of construction, [we should] carry ourselves
back to the time when the Constitution was adopted; recollect the spirit manifested in the debates; and instead of trying [to find] what meaning may be squeezed out of the text,
or invented against it, conform to the probable one in which
it was passed." T. Jefferson, Letter to William Johnson
(June 12, 1823), in 15 Writings of Thomas Jefferson 439, 449
(A. Lipscomb ed. 1904). That technique is simple of application when government conduct that is claimed to violate the
Bill of Rights or the Fourteenth Amendment is shown, upon
investigation, to have been engaged in without objection at
the very time the Bill of Rights or the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. There is no doubt, for example, that
laws against libel and obscenity do not violate "the freedom
of speech" to which the First Amendment refers; they existed and were universally approved in 1791. Application of
the principle of an unchanging Constitution is also simple
enough at the other extreme, where the government conduct
at issue was not engaged in at the time of adoption, and there
is ample evidence that the reason it was not engaged in is
that it was thought to violate the right embodied in the constitutional guarantee. Racks and thumbscrews, well-known
instruments for inflicting pain, were not in use because they
were regarded as cruel punishments.

The present case lies between those two extremes.
Anonymous electioneering was not prohibited by law in 1791
or in 1868. In fact, it was widely practiced at the earlier
date, an understandable legacy of the revolutionary era in
which political dissent could produce governmental reprisal.
I need not dwell upon the evidence of that, since it is described at length in today's concurrence. See ante, at 360-

369 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). The practice of
anonymous electioneering may have been less general in 1868,

514us2$46k $U46 05-27-98 16:42:00 PAGES OPLGxPGT

Scalia, J., dissenting
when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, but at least
as late as 1837 it was respectable enough to be engaged in
by Abraham Lincoln. See 1 A. Beveridge, Abraham Lincoln
1809-1858, pp. 215-216 (1928); 1 Uncollected Works of Abraham Lincoln 155-161 (R. Wilson ed. 1947).

But to prove that anonymous electioneering was used frequently is not to establish that it is a constitutional right.
Quite obviously, not every restriction upon expression that
did not exist in 1791 or in 1868 is ipso facto unconstitutional,
or else modern election laws such as those involved in Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191 (1992), and Buckley v. Valeo,
424 U. S. 1 (1976), would be prohibited, as would (to mention
only a few other categories) modern antinoise regulation of
the sort involved in Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U. S. 77 (1949),
and Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781 (1989), and
modern parade-permitting regulation of the sort involved in
Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U. S. 569 (1941).

Evidence that anonymous electioneering was regarded as
a constitutional right is sparse, and as far as I am aware
evidence that it was generally regarded as such is nonexistent. The concurrence points to "freedom of the press" objections that were made against the refusal of some Federalist newspapers to publish unsigned essays opposing the
proposed Constitution (on the ground that they might be the
work of foreign agents). See ante, at 364-366 (Thomas, J.,
concurring in judgment). But, of course, if every partisan
cry of "freedom of the press" were accepted as valid, our
Constitution would be unrecognizable; and if one were to
generalize from these particular cries, the First Amendment
would be not only a protection for newspapers, but a restriction upon them. Leaving aside, however, the fact that no
governmental action was involved, the Anti-Federalists had
a point, inasmuch as the editorial proscription of anonymity
applied only to them, and thus had the vice of viewpoint
discrimination. (Hence the comment by Philadelphiensis,

Scalia, J., dissenting
quoted in the concurrence: " `Here we see pretty plainly
through [the Federalists'] excellent regulation of the press,
how things are to be carried on after the adoption of the
new constitution.' " Ante, at 365 (quoting Philadelphiensis,
Essay I, Independent Gazetteer, Nov. 7, 1787, in 3 Complete
Anti-Federalist 103 (H. Storing ed. 1981)).)

The concurrence recounts other pre- and post-Revolution
examples of defense of anonymity in the name of "freedom
of the press," but not a single one involves the context of
restrictions imposed in connection with a free, democratic
election, which is all that is at issue here. For many of
them, moreover, such as the 1735 Zenger trial, ante, at 361,
the 1779 "Leonidas" controversy in the Continental Congress, ibid., and the 1779 action by the New Jersey Legislative Council against Isaac Collins, ante, at 362, the issue of
anonymity was incidental to the (unquestionably free-speech)
issue of whether criticism of the government could be punished by the state.

Thus, the sum total of the historical evidence marshaled
by the concurrence for the principle of constitutional entitlement to anonymous electioneering is partisan claims in the
debate on ratification (which was almost like an election) that
a viewpoint-based restriction on anonymity by newspaper
editors violates freedom of speech. This absence of historical testimony concerning the point before us is hardly remarkable. The issue of a governmental prohibition upon
anonymous electioneering in particular (as opposed to a government prohibition upon anonymous publication in general)
simply never arose. Indeed, there probably never arose
even the abstract question whether electoral openness and
regularity was worth such a governmental restriction upon
the normal right to anonymous speech. The idea of close
government regulation of the electoral process is a more
modern phenomenon, arriving in this country in the late
1800's. See Burson v. Freeman, supra, at 203-205.

What we have, then, is the most difficult case for determining the meaning of the Constitution. No accepted existence of governmental restrictions of the sort at issue here
demonstrates their constitutionality, but neither can their
nonexistence clearly be attributed to constitutional objections. In such a case, constitutional adjudication necessarily
involves not just history but judgment: judgment as to
whether the government action under challenge is consonant
with the concept of the protected freedom (in this case, the
freedom of speech and of the press) that existed when the
constitutional protection was accorded. In the present case,
absent other indication, I would be inclined to agree with
the concurrence that a society which used anonymous political debate so regularly would not regard as constitutional
even moderate restrictions made to improve the election
process. (I would, however, want further evidence of common practice in 1868, since I doubt that the Fourteenth
Amendment time-warped the post-Civil War States back to
the Revolution.)

But there is other indication, of the most weighty sort:
the widespread and longstanding traditions of our people. Principles of liberty fundamental enough to have been
embodied within constitutional guarantees are not readily
erased from the Nation's consciousness. A governmental
practice that has become general throughout the United
States, and particularly one that has the validation of
long, accepted usage, bears a strong presumption of constitutionality. And that is what we have before us here.

Courts have declared some of these laws unconstitutional in recent
years, relying upon our decision in Talley v. California, 362 U. S. 60 (1960).
See, e. g., State v. Burgess, 543 So. 2d 1332 (La. 1989); State v. North Dakota Ed. Assn., 262 N. W. 2d 731 (N. D. 1978); People v. Duryea, 76 Misc.

of, have upheld the laws. See, e. g., Commonwealth v. Evans, 156 Pa.
Super. 321, 40 A. 2d 137 (1944); State v. Freeman, 143 Kan. 315, 55 P. 2d

3 It might be accurate to say that, insofar as the judicially unconstrained

judgment of American legislatures is concerned, approval of the law before
us here is universal. California, although it had enacted an election disclosure requirement as early as 1901, see Act of Mar. 15, 1901, ch. 138, $ 1,
1901 Cal. Stats. 297, abandoned its law (then similar to Ohio's) in 1983, see
Act of Sept. 11, 1983, ch. 668, 1983 Cal. Stats. 2621, after a California Court
of Appeal, relying primarily on our decision in Talley, had declared the
provision unconstitutional, see Schuster v. Imperial County Municipal
Court, 109 Cal. App. 3d 887, 167 Cal. Rptr. 447 (1980), cert. denied, 450
U. S. 1042 (1981).

Scalia, J., dissenting
stand for the proposition that postadoption tradition cannotalter the core meaning of a constitutional guarantee. As we

said in Johnson, "[i]f there is a bedrock principle underlyingthe First Amendment, it is that the government may not
prohibit the expression of an idea simply because societyfinds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable." 491 U. S., at
414. Prohibition of expression of contempt for the flag,whether by contemptuous words, see

Street v. New York, 394U. S. 576 (1969), or by burning the flag, came, we said, within

that "bedrock principle." The law at issue here, by contrast,forbids the expression of no idea, but merely requires identification of the speaker when the idea is uttered in the elec-toral context. It is at the periphery of the First Amendment, like the law at issue in Burson, where we tookguidance from tradition in upholding against constitutional
attack restrictions upon electioneering in the vicinity ofpolling places, see 504 U. S., at 204-206 (plurality opinion);
id., at 214-216 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).

II
The foregoing analysis suffices to decide this case for me.Where the meaning of a constitutional text (such as "the

freedom of speech") is unclear, the widespread and long-accepted practices of the American people are the best
indication of what fundamental beliefs it was intended toenshrine. Even if I were to close my eyes to practice,
however, and were to be guided exclusively by deductiveanalysis from our case law, I would reach the same result.

Three basic questions must be answered to decide thiscase. Two of them are readily answered by our precedents;
the third is readily answered by common sense and by adecent regard for the practical judgment of those more familiar with elections than we are. The first question is whetherprotection of the election process justifies limitations upon
speech that cannot constitutionally be imposed generally.(If not, Talley v. California, which invalidated a flat ban on

514us2$46k $U46 05-27-98 16:42:00 PAGES OPLGxPGT

Scalia, J., dissenting
all anonymous leafletting, controls the decision here.) Ourcases plainly answer that question in the affirmative--indeed, they suggest that no justification for regulation is morecompelling than protection of the electoral process. "Other
rights, even the most basic, are illusory if the right to vote
is undermined." Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U. S. 1, 17 (1964).The State has a "compelling interest in preserving the integrity of its election process." Eu v. San Francisco County
Democratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 231 (1989). So
significant have we found the interest in protecting the elec-toral process to be that we have approved the prohibition

of political speech entirely in areas that would impede that
process. Burson, supra, at 204-206 (plurality opinion).

The second question relevant to our decision is whether a
"right to anonymity" is such a prominent value in our constitutional system that even protection of the electoral process
cannot be purchased at its expense. The answer, again, is
clear: no. Several of our cases have held that in peculiar
circumstances the compelled disclosure of a person's identity
would unconstitutionally deter the exercise of First Amendment associational rights. See, e. g., Brown v. Socialist
Workers '74 Campaign Comm. (Ohio), 459 U. S. 87 (1982);
Bates v. Little Rock, 361 U. S. 516 (1960); NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S. 449 (1958). But those
cases did not acknowledge any general right to anonymity,
or even any right on the part of all citizens to ignore the
particular laws under challenge. Rather, they recognized
a right to an exemption from otherwise valid disclosure
requirements on the part of someone who could show a
"reasonable probability" that the compelled disclosure would
result in "threats, harassment, or reprisals from either
Government officials or private parties." This last quotation is from Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S., at 74 (per curiam),
which prescribed the safety valve of a similar exemption in
upholding the disclosure requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act. That is the answer our case law pro514us2$46k $U46 05-27-98 16:42:00 PAGES OPLGxPGT
380 McINTYRE v. OHIO ELECTIONS COMM'N

Scalia, J., dissenting
vides to the Court's fear about the "tyranny of the majority,"
ante, at 357, and to its concern that " `[p]ersecuted groups
and sects from time to time throughout history have beenable to criticize oppressive practices and laws either anonymously or not at all,' " ante, at 342 (quoting Talley, 362 U. S.,
at 64). Anonymity can still be enjoyed by those who requireit, without utterly destroying useful disclosure laws. The

record in this case contains not even a hint that Mrs. McIn-tyre feared "threats, harassment, or reprisals"; indeed, she
placed her name on some of her fliers and meant to place iton all of them. See App. 12, 36-40.

The existence of a generalized right of anonymity in
speech was rejected by this Court in Lewis Publishing Co.
v. Morgan, 229 U. S. 288 (1913), which held that newspapers
desiring the privilege of second-class postage could be required to provide to the Postmaster General, and to publish,
a statement of the names and addresses of their editors, publishers, business managers, and owners. We rejected the
argument that the First Amendment forbade the requirement of such disclosure. Id., at 299. The provision that
gave rise to that case still exists, see 39 U. S. C. $ 3685, and
is still enforced by the Postal Service. It is one of several
federal laws seemingly invalidated by today's opinion.

The Court's unprecedented protection for anonymous
speech does not even have the virtue of establishing a clear
(albeit erroneous) rule of law. For after having announced
that this statute, because it "burdens core political speech,"
requires " `exacting scrutiny' " and must be "narrowly tailored to serve an overriding state interest," ante, at 347 (ordinarily the kiss of death), the opinion goes on to proclaim
soothingly (and unhelpfully) that "a State's enforcement interest might justify a more limited identification requirement," ante, at 353. See also ante, at 358 (Ginsburg, J.,
concurring) ("We do not . . . hold that the State may not in
other, larger circumstances require the speaker to disclose
its interest by disclosing its identity"). Perhaps, then, not

Scalia, J., dissenting
all the state statutes I have alluded to are invalid, but just
some of them; or indeed maybe all of them remain valid in
"larger circumstances"! It may take decades to work outthe shape of this newly expanded right-to-speak-incognito,

even in the elections field. And in other areas, of course, a
whole new boutique of wonderful First Amendment litiga-tion opens its doors. Must a parade permit, for example,

be issued to a group that refuses to provide its identity, orthat agrees to do so only under assurance that the identity
will not be made public? Must a municipally owned theaterthat is leased for private productions book anonymously
sponsored presentations? Must a government periodical
that has a "letters to the editor" column disavow the policy that most newspapers have against the publication of
anonymous letters? Must a public university that makes
its facilities available for a speech by Louis Farrakhan or
David Duke refuse to disclose the on-campus or off-campus
group that has sponsored or paid for the speech? Must a
municipal "public-access" cable channel permit anonymous
(and masked) performers? The silliness that follows upon a
generalized right to anonymous speech has no end.

The third and last question relevant to our decision is
whether the prohibition of anonymous campaigning is effective in protecting and enhancing democratic elections. In
answering this question no, the Justices of the majority set
their own views--on a practical matter that bears closely
upon the real-life experience of elected politicians and not
upon that of unelected judges--up against the views of 49
(and perhaps all 50, see n. 4, supra) state legislatures and
the Federal Congress. We might also add to the list on the
other side the legislatures of foreign democracies: Australia,
Canada, and England, for example, all have prohibitions upon
anonymous campaigning. See, e. g., Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, $ 328 (Australia); Canada Elections Act,
R. S. C., ch. E-2, $ 261 (1985); Representation of the People
Act, 1983, $ 110 (England). How is it, one must wonder, that

Scalia, J., dissenting
all of these elected legislators, from around the country andaround the world, could not see what six Justices of this

Court see so clearly that they are willing to require the en-tire Nation to act upon it: that requiring identification of the
source of campaign literature does not improve the quality
of the campaign?The Court says that the State has not explained "why it

can more easily enforce the direct bans on disseminatingfalse documents against anonymous authors and distributors
than against wrongdoers who might use false names and ad-dresses in an attempt to avoid detection."

Ante, at 352-353.
I am not sure what this complicated comparison means. I
am sure, however, that (1) a person who is required to put
his name to a document is much less likely to lie than one
who can lie anonymously, and (2) the distributor of a leaflet
which is unlawful because it is anonymous runs much more
risk of immediate detection and punishment than the distributor of a leaflet which is unlawful because it is false. Thus,
people will be more likely to observe a signing requirement
than a naked "no falsity" requirement; and, having observed
that requirement, will then be significantly less likely to lie
in what they have signed.

But the usefulness of a signing requirement lies not only
in promoting observance of the law against campaign falsehoods (though that alone is enough to sustain it). It lies also
in promoting a civil and dignified level of campaign debate--
which the State has no power to command, but ample power
to encourage by such undemanding measures as a signature
requirement. Observers of the past few national elections
have expressed concern about the increase of character assassination--"mudslinging" is the colloquial term--engaged
in by political candidates and their supporters to the detriment of the democratic process. Not all of this, in fact not
much of it, consists of actionable untruth; most is innuendo,
or demeaning characterization, or mere disclosure of items of
personal life that have no bearing upon suitability for office.

Imagine how much all of this would increase if it could bedone anonymously. The principal impediment against it is

the reluctance of most individuals and organizations to bepublicly associated with uncharitable and uncivil expression.
Consider, moreover, the increased potential for "dirty
tricks." It is not unheard-of for campaign operatives to cir-culate material over the name of their opponents or their

opponents' supporters (a violation of election laws) in orderto attract or alienate certain interest groups. See,

e. g.,
B. Felknor, Political Mischief: Smear, Sabotage, and Reformin U. S. Elections 111-112 (1992) (fake United Mine Workers'

newspaper assembled by the National Republican Congressional Committee); New York v. Duryea, 76 Misc. 2d 948, 351
N. Y. S. 2d 978 (Sup. 1974) (letters purporting to be from the
"Action Committee for the Liberal Party" sent by Republicans). How much easier--and sanction free!--it would be to
circulate anonymous material (for example, a really tasteless, though not actionably false, attack upon one's own candidate) with the hope and expectation that it will be attributed to, and held against, the other side.

The Court contends that demanding the disclosure of the
pamphleteer's identity is no different from requiring the disclosure of any other information that may reduce the persuasiveness of the pamphlet's message. See ante, at 348-349.
It cites Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U. S.
241 (1974), which held it unconstitutional to require a newspaper that had published an editorial critical of a particular
candidate to furnish space for that candidate to reply. But it
is not usual for a speaker to put forward the best arguments
against himself, and it is a great imposition upon free speech
to make him do so. Whereas it is quite usual--it is expected--for a speaker to identify himself, and requiring that
is (at least when there are no special circumstances present)
virtually no imposition at all.

We have approved much more onerous disclosure requirements in the name of fair elections. In Buckley v. Valeo, 424

384 McINTYRE v. OHIO ELECTIONS COMM'N

Scalia, J., dissenting
U. S. 1 (1976), we upheld provisions of the Federal ElectionCampaign Act that required private individuals to report to

the Federal Election Commission independent expendituresmade for communications advocating the election or defeat
of a candidate for federal office. Id., at 80. Our primary
rationale for upholding this provision was that it served an"informational interest" by "increas[ing] the fund of information concerning those who support the candidates." Id., at81. The provision before us here serves the same informational interest, as well as more important interests, which Ihave discussed above. The Court's attempt to distinguish
Buckley, see ante, at 356, would be unconvincing, even if itwere accurate in its statement that the disclosure requirement there at issue "reveals far less information" than requiring disclosure of the identity of the author of a specificcampaign statement. That happens not to be accurate, since

the provision there at issue required not merely "[d]isclosureof an expenditure and its use, without more."

Ante, at 355.
It required, among other things:

"the identification of each person to whom expenditures
have been made . . . within the calendar year in an aggregate amount or value in excess of $100, the amount,
date, and purpose of each such expenditure and the
name and address of, and office sought by, each candidate on whose behalf such expenditure was made." 2
U. S. C. $ 434(b)(9) (1970 ed., Supp. IV) (emphasis added).

See also 2 U. S. C. $ 434(e) (1970 ed., Supp. IV). (Both
reproduced in Appendix to Buckley, supra, at 158, 160.)
Surely in many if not most cases, this information will
readily permit identification of the particular message that
the would-be-anonymous campaigner sponsored. Besides
which the burden of complying with this provision, which
includes the filing of quarterly reports, is infinitely more
onerous than Ohio's simple requirement for signature of

campaign literature. If Buckley remains the law, this isan easy case.

* * *
I do not know where the Court derives its perception that"anonymous pamphleteering is not a pernicious, fraudulent

practice, but an honorable tradition of advocacy and of dis-sent."

Ante, at 357. I can imagine no reason why an anon-ymous leaflet is any more honorable, as a general matter,

than an anonymous phone call or an anonymous letter. Itfacilitates wrong by eliminating accountability, which is ordinarily the very purpose of the anonymity. There are ofcourse exceptions, and where anonymity is needed to avoid
"threats, harassment, or reprisals" the First Amendmentwill require an exemption from the Ohio law. Cf.

NAACPv.
Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S. 449 (1958). But tostrike down the Ohio law in its general application--and similar laws of 49 other States and the Federal Government--on the ground that all anonymous communication is in our
society traditionally sacrosanct, seems to me a distortion ofthe past that will lead to a coarsening of the future.

I respectfully dissent.

STONE v. IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATIONSERVICE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 93-1199. Argued November 28, 1994--Decided April 19, 1995
In 1988, an Immigration Judge ordered petitioner Stone deported. The

Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed on July 26, 1991, and denied Stone's motion to reopen and/or reconsider the deportation in February 1993. Shortly thereafter, he petitioned the Court of Appeals for
review of both the deportation and reconsideration orders. The court
dismissed the petition for want of jurisdiction to the extent that it
sought review of the underlying deportation determination, holding that
the filing of the reconsideration motion did not toll the running of the
90-day filing period for review of final deportation orders specified in

$ 106(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).

Held: A timely motion for reconsideration of a BIA decision does not toll

the running of $ 106(a)(1)'s 90-day period. Pp. 390-406.

(a) The parties agree that a deportation order becomes final upon the
BIA's dismissal of an appeal and that the 90-day appeal period started
to run in this case on July 26, 1991. It is also clear that the Hobbs
Administrative Orders Review Act, which Congress has directed governs review of deportation orders, embraces a tolling rule: The timely
filing of a motion to reconsider renders the underlying order nonfinal
for purposes of judicial review. ICC v. Locomotive Engineers, 482 U. S.
270. That conventional tolling rule would apply to this case had Congress specified using the Hobbs Act to govern review of deportation
orders without further qualification. Pp. 390-393.

(b) However, Congress instead specified 10 exceptions to the use of
Hobbs Act procedures, one of which is decisive here. Section 106(a)(6),
added to the INA in 1990, provides that whenever a petitioner seeks
review of an order under $ 106, "any review sought with respect to a
motion to reopen or reconsider such an order shall be consolidated with
the review of the order." By its terms, $ 106(a)(6) contemplates two
petitions for review and directs the courts to consolidate the matters.
The direction that the motion to reopen or reconsider is to be consolidated with the review of the underlying order, not the other way
around, indicates that the action to review the underlying order remains
active and pending before the court. Were a motion for reconsideration
to render the underlying order nonfinal, there would be, in the normal

387Cite as: 514 U. S. 386 (1995)
Syllabus
course, only one petition for review filed and hence nothing for the Judiciary to consolidate. Since it appears that only the no-tolling rule
would give rise to two separate petitions for review simultaneously before the courts, which it is plain $ 106(a)(6) contemplates, it would seem
that only that rule gives meaning to the section. Pp. 393-395.

(c) Petitioner's construction of $ 106(a)(6)--which presumes that a reconsideration motion renders the underlying order nonfinal if the motion
is filed before a petition for review but that finality is unaffected if the
reconsideration motion is filed after the petition for review--is unacceptable. It is implausible that Congress would direct different results
in the two circumstances. Moreover, it is presumed that Congress intends its amendment of a statute to have real and substantial effect, yet
under petitioner's construction the consolidation provision would have
effect only in the rarest of circumstances. Pp. 395-398.

(d) Underlying considerations of administrative and judicial efficiency,
as well as fairness to the alien, support the conclusion that Congress
intended to depart from the conventional tolling rule in deportation
cases. While an appeal of a deportation order results in an automatic
stay, a motion for agency reconsideration does not. Congress might not
have wished to impose on aliens the Hobson's choice of petitioning for
reconsideration at the risk of immediate deportation or forgoing reconsideration and petitioning for review to obtain the automatic stay. In
addition, the tolling rule's policy of delayed review would be at odds
with Congress' fundamental purpose in enacting $ 106, which was to
abbreviate the judicial review process in order to prevent aliens from
forestalling deportation by dilatory tactics in the courts. Pp. 398-401.

(e) A consideration of the analogous practice of appellate court review
of district court judgments confirms the correctness of this Court's construction of Congress' language. The filing of a motion for relief from
judgment more than 10 days after judgment under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 60(b)--the closest analogy to the petition for agency reconsideration here--does not affect the finality of a district court's judgment.
If filed before the appeal is taken, it does not toll the running of the
time to take an appeal; if filed after the notice of appeal, appellate court
jurisdiction is not divested. Each case gives rise to two separate appellate proceedings that can be consolidated. However, if a post-trial motion that renders an underlying judgment nonfinal is filed before an
appeal, it tolls the time for review, and if filed afterwards, it divests the
appellate court of jurisdiction. Thus, it gives rise to only one appeal in
which all matters are reviewed. In contrast, the hybrid tolling rule
suggested by the dissent--that a reconsideration motion before the BIA
renders the original order nonfinal if made before a petition for judicial
review is filed but does not affect the finality of the order if filed after514us2$47Z 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT

Petitioner, Marvin Stone, is a citizen of Canada and a busi-nessman and lawyer by profession. He entered the United

States in 1977 as a nonimmigrant visitor for business and hassince remained in the United States.

On January 3, 1983, Stone was convicted of conspiracy andmail fraud, in violation of 18 U. S. C. $$ 371 and 1341. He
served 18 months of a 3-year prison term. In March 1987,after his release, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) served him with an order to show cause why heshould not be deported as a nonimmigrant who had remained
in the United States beyond the period authorized by law.In January 1988, after a series of hearings, an Immigration Judge ordered Stone deported. The IJ concluded thatunder the regulations in effect when Stone entered the
United States, an alien on a nonimmigrant for business visa

Opinion of the Court
could remain in the country for an initial period not to exceedsix months with the privilege of seeking extensions, which

could be granted in 6-month increments. 8 CFR $ 214.2(b) (1977). The IJ ordered deportation under 8 U. S. C.

$ 1251(a)(2) (now $ 1251(a)(1)(B) (1988 ed., Supp. V)) based on
petitioner's testimony that he had remained in the UnitedStates since 1977 without seeking any extension. The IJ

denied Stone's application for suspension of deportationunder 8 U. S. C. $ 1254(a)(1), concluding that Stone's conviction of mail fraud and 18-month incarceration barred him, asa matter of law, from establishing "good moral character" as
required by $ 1254. See $ 1101(f)(7).

Stone's administrative appeals were as follows: he appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which affirmed
the IJ's determinations and dismissed the appeal on July 26,
1991; he filed a "Motion to Reopen and/or to Reconsider"
with the BIA in August 1991; on February 3, 1993, some
17 months later, the BIA denied the reconsideration motion
as frivolous.

Judicial review was sought next. The record does not
give the precise date, but, sometime in February or March
1993, Stone petitioned the Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit for review of both the July 26, 1991, deportation
order and the February 3, 1993, order denying reconsideration. The Court of Appeals dismissed the petition for want
of jurisdiction to the extent the petition sought review of the
July 26, 1991, order, the underlying deportation determination. The court held that the filing of the reconsideration
motion did not toll the running of the 90-day filing period for
review of final deportation orders. 13 F. 3d 934, 938-939

A

Section 106(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act(INA) specifies that "a petition for review [of a final deportation order] may be filed not later than 90 days after thedate of the issuance of the final deportation order, or, in
the case of an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, notlater than 30 days after the issuance of such order." 8
U. S. C. $ 1105a(a)(1) (1988 ed. and Supp. V). The clause per-taining to an "aggravated felony" is not a factor in the analysis, petitioner's offense not being within that defined term.See $ 1101(a)(43). He had the benefit of the full 90-day filing
period. There is no dispute that a deportation order "be-come[s] final upon dismissal of an appeal by the Board of
Immigration Appeals," 8 CFR $ 243.1 (1977), and, the partiesagree, the 90-day period started on July 26, 1991.

The parties disagree, however, regarding the effect thatpetitioner's later filing of a timely motion to reconsider had
on the finality of the order. Petitioner contends that atimely motion to reconsider renders the underlying order
nonfinal, and that a petition seeking review of both the orderand the reconsideration denial is timely if filed (as this petition was) within 90 days of the reconsideration denial. TheINS argues that the finality and reviewability of an order
are unaffected by the filing of a motion to reconsider or toreopen. In its view the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction
to review the denial of the motion to reconsider but not toreview the original order.

Opinion of the Court
We considered the timeliness of a review petition wherethere is a motion to reconsider or reopen an agency's order

in ICC v. Locomotive Engineers, 482 U. S. 270 (1987). TheInterstate Commerce Commission's governing statute provided that, with certain exceptions, judicial review of ICC
orders would be governed by the Hobbs Administrative Or-ders Review Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 2341

et seq. See Locomotive
Engineers, 482 U. S., at 277. We held that "the timely peti-tion for administrative reconsideration stayed the running of

the Hobbs Act's limitation period until the petition had beenacted upon by the Commission."

Id., at 284. Our conclusion, we acknowledged, was in some tension with the language of both the Hobbs Act, which permits an aggrieved
party to petition for review "within 60 days after [the] entry"
of a final order, 28 U. S. C. $ 2344, and of 49 U. S. C. $ 10327(i),
"which provides that, `[n]otwithstanding' the provision authorizing the Commission to reopen and reconsider its orders
($ 10327(g)), `an action of the Commission . . . is final on the
date on which it is served, and a civil action to enforce, enjoin, suspend, or set aside the action may be filed after that
date.' " Locomotive Engineers, supra, at 284. We found
the controlling language similar to the corresponding provision of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C.

$ 704, which provides that "agency action otherwise final

is final for the purposes of this section [entitled `Actions
Reviewable'] whether or not there has been presented or
determined an application for . . . any form of reconsideratio[n]"-- "language [that] has long been construed . . . merely
to relieve parties from the requirement of petitioning for rehearing before seeking judicial review . . . but not to prevent
petitions for reconsideration that are actually filed from rendering the orders under reconsideration nonfinal." Locomotive Engineers, supra, at 284-285 (citation omitted).

In support of that longstanding construction of the APA
language, we cited dicta in two earlier cases, American
Farm Lines v. Black Ball Freight Service, 397 U. S. 532, 541

514us2$47l 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT
392 STONE v. INS

Opinion of the Court
(1970); CAB v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 367 U. S. 316, 326-327
(1961), and the holding in Outland v. CAB, 284 F. 2d 224, 227
(CADC 1960), a decision cited with approval in both Black
Ball and Delta. Outland justified treating orders as nonfinal for purposes of review during the pendency of a motion
for reconsideration in terms of judicial economy: "[W]hen the
party elects to seek a rehearing there is always a possibility
that the order complained of will be modified in a way which
renders judicial review unnecessary." Outland, supra, at
227.

As construed in Locomotive Engineers both the APA and
the Hobbs Act embrace a tolling rule: The timely filing of a
motion to reconsider renders the underlying order nonfinal
for purposes of judicial review. In consequence, pendency
of reconsideration renders the underlying decision not yet
final, and it is implicit in the tolling rule that a party who
has sought rehearing cannot seek judicial review until the
rehearing has concluded. 4 K. Davis, Administrative Law
Treatise $ 26:12 (2d ed. 1988); United Transportation Union
v. ICC, 871 F. 2d 1114, 1118 (CADC 1989); Bellsouth Corp. v.
FCC, 17 F. 3d 1487, 1489-1490 (CADC 1994). Indeed, those
Circuits that apply the tolling rule have so held. See
Fleary, 950 F. 2d, at 711-712 (deportation order not reviewable during pendency of motion to reopen); Hyun Joon
Chung v. INS, 720 F. 2d 1471, 1474 (CA9 1984) (same).

Section 106 of the INA provides that "[t]he procedure prescribed by, and all the provisions of chapter 158 of title 28,
shall apply to, and shall be the sole and exclusive procedure
for, the judicial review of all final orders of deportation . . . ."
8 U. S. C. $ 1105a(a) (1988 ed. and Supp. V). The reference
to chapter 158 of Title 28 is a reference to the Hobbs Act.
In light of our construction of the Hobbs Act in Locomotive
Engineers, had Congress used that Act to govern review of
deportation orders without further qualification, it would
follow that the so-called tolling rule applied.

Opinion of the Court
The INS, however, proffers a different reading of Locomo-tive Engineers. Relying on our statement that the provision of the APA, 5 U. S. C. $ 704, has been construed "not toprevent petitions for reconsideration that are actually filed
from rendering the orders under reconsideration nonfinal,"482 U. S., at 285 (emphasis supplied), the INS understands
Locomotive Engineers to set forth merely a default rulefrom which agencies may choose to depart. It argues that
it did so here.If the case turned on this theory, the question would arise
whether an agency subject to either the APA or the HobbsAct has the authority to specify whether the finality of its
orders for purposes of judicial review is affected by the filingof a motion to reconsider. The question is not presented
here. Both the Hobbs Act and the APA are congressionalenactments, and Congress may alter or modify their application in the case of particular agencies. We conclude thatin amending the INA Congress chose to depart from
the ordinary judicial treatment of agency orders underreconsideration.

B
Congress directed that the Hobbs Act procedures wouldgovern review of deportation orders, except for 10 specified

qualifications. See 8 U. S. C. $ 1105a(a). Two of those ex-ceptions are pertinent. The first, contained in $ 106(a)(1) of
the INA, provides an alien with 90 days to petition for re-view of a final deportation order (30 days for aliens convicted
of an aggravated felony), instead of the Hobbs Act's 60-dayperiod. See 8 U. S. C. $ 1105a(a)(1) (1988 ed., Supp. V). The
second and decisive exception is contained in $ 106(a)(6), aprovision added when Congress amended the INA in 1990.
The section provides:

"[W]henever a petitioner seeks review of an order underthis section, any review sought with respect to a motion to reopen or reconsider such an order shall be

Opinion of the Court
consolidated with the review of the order." 8 U. S. C.

$ 1105a(a)(6).

By its terms, $ 106(a)(6) contemplates two petitions for review and directs the courts to consolidate the matters. The
words of the statute do not permit us to say that the filing
of a petition for reconsideration or reopening dislodges the
earlier proceeding reviewing the underlying order. The
statute, in fact, directs that the motion to reopen or reconsider is to be consolidated with the review of the order, not
the other way around. This indicates to us that the action
to review the underlying order remains active and pending
before the court. We conclude that the statute is best understood as reflecting an intent on the part of Congress that
deportation orders are to be reviewed in a timely fashion
after issuance, irrespective of the later filing of a motion to
reopen or reconsider.

Were a motion for reconsideration to render the underlying order nonfinal, there would be, in the normal course, only
one petition for review filed and hence nothing for the judiciary to consolidate. As in Locomotive Engineers itself, review would be sought after denial of reconsideration, and
both the underlying order and the denial of reconsideration
would be reviewed in a single proceeding, insofar, at least,
as denial of reconsideration would be reviewable at all. See
Locomotive Engineers, 482 U. S., at 280. Indeed, the Ninth
Circuit, which before the 1990 amendment had held that
pendency of a reconsideration motion did render a deportation order nonfinal, understood that the tolling rule contemplates just one petition for review: "Congress visualized a
single administrative proceeding in which all questions relating to an alien's deportation would be raised and resolved,
followed by a single petition in a court of appeals for judicial
review . . . ." Yamada v. INS, 384 F. 2d 214, 218 (CA9 1967).
The tolling rule is hard to square with the existence of two
separate judicial review proceedings.

395Cite as: 514 U. S. 386 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
Under the no-tolling rule, by contrast, two separate peti-tions for review will exist in the normal course. An order

would be final when issued, irrespective of the later filing of areconsideration motion, and the aggrieved party would seek
judicial review of the order within the specified period.
Upon denial of reconsideration, the petitioner would file aseparate petition to review that second final order. Because

it appears that only the no-tolling rule could give rise totwo separate petitions for review simultaneously before the
courts, which it is plain $ 106(a)(6) contemplates, it wouldseem that only that rule gives meaning to the section.

Although the consolidation provision does not mention tolling, see post, at 408 (Breyer, J., dissenting), tolling would
be the logical consequence if the statutory scheme provided
for the nonfinality of orders upon the filing of a reconsideration motion. Locomotive Engineers' conclusion as to tolling
followed as a necessary consequence from its conclusion
about finality. Finality is the antecedent question, and as to
that matter the consolidation provision speaks volumes. All
would agree that the provision envisions two petitions for
review. See post, at 408 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Because
only "final deportation order[s]" may be reviewed, 8 U. S. C.

$ 1105a(a)(1), it follows by necessity that the provision requires for its operation the existence of two separate final
orders, the petitions for review of which could be consolidated. The two orders cannot remain final and hence the
subject of separate petitions for review if the filing of the
reconsideration motion rendered the original order nonfinal.
It follows that the filing of the reconsideration motion does
not toll the time to petition for review. By speaking to finality, the consolidation provision does say quite a bit about
tolling.

Recognizing this problem, petitioner at oral argument
sought to give meaning to $ 106(a)(6) by offering a different
version of what often might occur. Petitioner envisioned an
alien who petitioned for review of a final deportation order,

514us2$47l 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT
396 STONE v. INS

Opinion of the Court
and, while the petition was still pending, went back to theagency to seek its reconsideration or, if new evidence had

arisen, reopening. If, upon denial of reconsideration or re-opening, the alien sought review, and the review of the original order were still pending, $ 106(a)(6) would apply and the
two petitions would be consolidated. The dissent relies onthe same assumed state of events. See

post, at 409-410.
That construct, however, is premised on a view of finalityquite inconsistent with the tolling rule petitioner himself

proposes. If, as petitioner advocates, the filing of a timelypetition for reconsideration before seeking judicial review
renders the underlying order nonfinal, so that a reviewing
court would lack jurisdiction to review the order until after
disposition of the reconsideration motion, one wonders how
a court retains jurisdiction merely because the petitioner delays the reconsideration motions until after filing the petition
for judicial review of the underlying order. The policy supporting the nonfinality rule--that "when the party elects to
seek a rehearing there is always a possibility that the order
complained of will be modified in a way which renders judicial review unnecessary," Outland, 284 F. 2d, at 227--applies
with equal force where the party seeks agency rehearing
after filing a petition for judicial review. Indeed, the Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, whose decision in Outland we cited in support of our construction in
Locomotive Engineers, has so held in the years following our
decision. See Wade v. FCC, 986 F. 2d 1433, 1434 (1993) (per
curiam) ("The danger of wasted judicial effort . . . arises
whether a party seeks agency reconsideration before, simultaneous with, or after filing an appeal or petition for judicial
review") (citations omitted). The Wade holding rested on,
and is consistent with, our decision in a somewhat analogous
context that the filing of a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
59 motion to alter or amend a district court's judgment strips
the appellate court of jurisdiction, whether the Rule 59 motion is filed before or after the notice of appeal. See Griggs

Opinion of the Court
v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U. S. 56, 61 (1982)
(per curiam). Our decision, based on a construction of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4), noted the "theoreti-cal inconsistency" of permitting the district court to retain

jurisdiction to decide the Rule 59 motion while treating the
notice of appeal as "adequate for purposes of beginning theappeals process."

Griggs, supra, at 59.
We need not confirm the correctness of the Wade decision,but neither should we go out of our way to say it is incorrect,

as petitioner and the dissent would have us do. The incon-sistency in petitioner's construction of $ 106(a)(6) is the same
inconsistency that we noted in Griggs. Petitioner assumes
that a reconsideration motion renders the underlying order
nonfinal if the motion is filed before a petition for review, but
that finality is unaffected if the reconsideration motion is
filed one day after the petition for review. It is implausible
that Congress would direct different results in the two circumstances. At any rate, under petitioner's construction
the consolidation provision would have effect only in the
rarest of circumstances.

When Congress acts to amend a statute, we presume it
intends its amendment to have real and substantial effect.
See Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 339 (1979) (Court
must construe statute to give effect, if possible, to every
provision); Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103, 109-111
(1990) (same). Had Congress intended review of INS orders
to proceed in a manner no different from review of other
agencies, as petitioner appears to argue, there would have
been no reason for Congress to have included the consolidation provision. The reasonable construction is that the
amendment was enacted as an exception, not just to state an
already existing rule. Section 106(a)(6) is an explicit exception to the general applicability of the Hobbs Act procedures,
so it must be construed as creating a procedure different
from normal practice under the Act. We conclude, as did
the Court of Appeals, see 13 F. 3d, at 938, and the Seventh

514us2$47l 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT
398 STONE v. INS

Opinion of the Court
Circuit, see Akrap, 966 F. 2d, at 271, that the consolidationprovision Congress inserted when it amended the Act in 1990

is best understood as reflecting its expectation that in theparticular context of INS deportation orders the normal tolling rule will not apply. C

Underlying considerations of administrative and judicialefficiency, as well as fairness to the alien, support our conclusion that Congress intended to depart from the conventionaltolling rule in deportation cases.

Deportation orders are self-executing orders, not depend-ent upon judicial enforcement. This accounts for the automatic stay mechanism, the statutory provision providing thatservice of the petition for review of the deportation order
stays the deportation absent contrary direction from thecourt or the alien's aggravated felony status. See 8 U. S. C.

$ 1105a(a)(3). The automatic stay would be all but a neces-sity for preserving the jurisdiction of the court, for the
agency might not otherwise refrain from enforcement. In-deed, the INA provides that "nothing in this section [Judicial
review of orders of deportation and exclusion] shall be con-strued to require the Attorney General to defer deportation
of an alien after the issuance of a deportation order becauseof the right of judicial review of the order granted by this
section." 8 U. S. C. $ 1105a(a)(8) (1988 ed., Supp. V). Andit has been the longstanding view of the INS, a view we
presume Congress understood when it amended the Act in1990, that a motion for reconsideration does not serve to stay
the deportation order. 8 CFR $ 3.8 (1977). Cf. Delta Air
Lines, 367 U. S., at 325-327 (certificate of public convenienceand necessity effective when issued though not final for purposes of judicial review because of pendency of reconsidera-tion motion).

Were the tolling rule to apply here, aliens subject to de-portation orders might well face a Hobson's choice: petition
for agency reconsideration at the risk of immediate deporta514us2$47l 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT

399Cite as: 514 U. S. 386 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
tion, or forgo reconsideration and petition for review to ob-tain the automatic stay. The choice is a hard one in deportation cases, in that the consequences of deportation areso final, unlike orders in some other administrative contexts.
Once an alien has been deported, the courts lack jurisdiction to review the deportation order's validity. See 8U. S. C. $ 1105a(c). This choice is one Congress might not

have wished to impose on the alien.An alien who had filed for agency reconsideration might
seek to avoid immediate deportation by seeking a judicialstay. At oral argument, petitioner suggested a habeas corpus action as one solution to the dilemma. Even on the assumption that a habeas corpus action would be available, see

$ 1105a(a) (Exclusiveness of procedure), the solution is unsatisfactory. In evaluating those stay applications the courts
would be required to assess the probability of the alien's prevailing on review, turning the stay proceedings into collateral previews of the eventual petitions for review--indeed a
preview now implicating the district court, not just the court
of appeals. By inviting duplicative review in multiple
courts, the normal tolling rule would frustrate, rather than
promote, its stated goal of judicial economy.

From an even more fundamental standpoint, the policies
of the tolling rule are at odds with Congress' policy in adopting the judicial review provisions of the INA. The tolling
rule reflects a preference to postpone judicial review to ensure completion of the administrative process. Reconsideration might eliminate the need for judicial intervention, and
the resultant saving in judicial resources ought not to be
diminished by premature adjudication. By contrast, Congress' "fundamental purpose" in enacting $ 106 of the INA
was "to abbreviate the process of judicial review . . . in order
to frustrate certain practices . . . whereby persons subject to
deportation were forestalling departure by dilatory tactics
in the courts." Foti v. INS, 375 U. S. 217, 224 (1963). Congress' concern reflected the reality that "in a deportation

Opinion of the Court
proceeding . . . as a general matter, every delay works tothe advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to

remain in the United States." INS v. Doherty, 502 U. S. 314,321-325 (1992). Congress' intent in adopting and then
amending the INA was to expedite both the initiation and
the completion of the judicial review process. The tollingrule's policy of delayed review would be at odds with the

congressional purpose.The dissent does not dispute that a principal purpose of
the 1990 amendments to the INA was to expedite petitionsfor review and to redress the related problem of successive
and frivolous administrative appeals and motions. In the
Immigration Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101-649, 104 Stat. 5048,
Congress took five steps to reduce or eliminate these abuses.
First, it directed the Attorney General to promulgate regulations limiting the number of reconsideration and reopening
motions that an alien could file. $ 545(b). Second, it instructed the Attorney General to promulgate regulations
specifying the maximum time period for the filing of those
motions, hinting that a 20-day period would be appropriate.
See ibid. Third, Congress cut in half the time for seeking
judicial review of the final deportation order, from 180 to
90 days. See ibid. Fourth, Congress directed the Attorney
General to define "frivolous behavior for which attorneys
may be sanctioned" in connection with administrative appeals and motions. See $ 545(a). In the dissent's view, a
fifth measure, the consolidation provision, was added for no
apparent reason and bears no relation to the other amendments Congress enacted at the same time. It is more plausible that when Congress took the first four steps to solve a
problem, the fifth--the consolidation provision--was also
part of the solution, and not a step in the other direction.
By envisioning that a final deportation order will remain
final and reviewable for 90 days from the date of its issuance
irrespective of the later filing of a reconsideration motion,
Congress' amendment eliminates much if not all of the incen514us2$47l 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT

tive to file a meritless reconsideration motion, and, like theother amendments adopted at the same time, expedites the

time within which the judicial review process of the deporta-tion order begins.

D
A consideration of the analogous practice of appellatecourt review of district court judgments confirms the correctness of our construction of Congress' language. Theclosest analogy to the INS' discretionary petition for agency
reconsideration is the motion for relief from judgment underFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). The effect of Rule
60(b) motions (at least when made more than 10 days afterjudgment, an exception discussed below), on the finality and
appealability of district court judgments is comparable to theeffect of reconsideration motions on INS orders. With the
exception noted, the filing of a Rule 60(b) motion does nottoll the running of the time for taking an appeal, see Fed.
Rule Civ. Proc. 60(b); 11 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Prac-tice and Procedure $ 2871 (1973) (Wright & Miller), and the
pendency of the motion before the district court does notaffect the continuity of a prior-taken appeal. See

ibid.And last but not least, the pendency of an appeal does not

affect the district court's power to grant Rule 60 relief. See
Standard Oil Co. of Cal. v. United States, 429 U. S. 17, 18-19(1976) (per curiam); Wright & Miller $ 2873 (1994 Supp.). A

litigant faced with an unfavorable district court judgmentmust appeal that judgment within the time allotted by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4, whether or not the liti-gant first files a Rule 60(b) motion (where the Rule 60 motion
is filed more than 10 days following judgment). Either be-fore or after filing his appeal, the litigant may also file a Rule
60(b) motion for relief with the district court. The denial ofthe motion is appealable as a separate final order, and if the
original appeal is still pending it would seem that the courtof appeals can consolidate the proceedings. In each of these
respects, the practice of litigants under Rule 60(b) is, under

Opinion of the Court
our construction, identical to that of aliens who file motionsfor reconsideration before the BIA. In each case two separate postdecision appeals are filed.For reasons not relevant here, in 1991 the Rules of Appellate Procedure were amended to provide that Rule 60(b) motions filed within 10 days of a district court's judgment dotoll the time for taking an appeal. See Fed. Rule App. Proc.

4(a)(4)(F). That amendment added Rule 60(b) motions filedwithin 10 days of judgment to a list of other post-trial motions that toll the running of the time for appeal, a list thatincludes Rule 59 motions to alter or amend a judgment. See
Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(4)(C). A consideration of this provision of the appellate rules is quite revealing. The list of
post-trial motions that toll the time for appeal is followed,
and hence qualified, by the language interpreted in Griggs,
language that provides in express terms that these motions
also serve to divest the appellate court of jurisdiction where
the motions are filed after appeal is taken.

The language of Rule 4 undermines the dissent's reliance
on a presumption that appellate court jurisdiction once asserted is not divested by further proceedings at the trial or
agency level. See post, at 410. Indeed, the practice is most
often to the contrary where appellate court review of district
court judgments subject to post-trial motions is concerned.
See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(4) (specifying that the majority
of postjudgment motions filed with the district court divest
the appellate court of jurisdiction that had once existed). A
district court judgment subject to one of these enumerated
motions, typified by Rule 59, is reviewable only after, and in
conjunction with, review of the denial of the post-trial motion, and just one appeal pends before the appellate court at
any one time.

In short, the Rules of Appellate Procedure evince a consistent and coherent view of the finality and appealability of
district court judgments subject to post-trial motions. The
majority of post-trial motions, such as Rule 59, render the

403Cite as: 514 U. S. 386 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
underlying judgment nonfinal both when filed before an appeal is taken (thus tolling the time for taking an appeal),
and when filed after the notice of appeal (thus divesting the
appellate court of jurisdiction). Other motions, such as Rule
60(b) motions filed more than 10 days after judgment, do not
affect the finality of a district court's judgment, either when
filed before the appeal (no tolling), or afterwards (appellate
court jurisdiction not divested). Motions that do toll the
time for taking appeal give rise to only one appeal in which
all matters are reviewed; motions that do not toll the time
for taking an appeal give rise to two separate appellate proceedings that can be consolidated.

E
Our colleagues in dissent agree that the consolidation provision envisions the existence of two separate petitions for
review. See post, at 408. To give the provision meaning
while at the same time concluding that the tolling rule applies, the dissent is compelled to conclude that a reconsideration motion before the BIA renders the original order nonfinal if made before a petition for judicial review is filed but
does not affect the finality of the order if filed afterwards.
See post, at 413-414. The hybrid tolling rule the dissent
suggests has no analogue at all in the appellate court-district
court context. On the contrary, as we have just observed,
the uniform principle where appellate review of district
court judgments is concerned is that motions that toll
produce but one appeal, motions that do not toll produce two.
It is only by creating this new hybrid that the dissent can
give meaning to the consolidation provision, and avoid the
Hobson's choice for the alien. While litigants who practice
before the district courts and the BIA will have familiarity
with both types of post-trial motions discussed above, and
will have no difficulty practicing under the rule we announce
today, practitioners would have no familiarity with the hy514us2$47l 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT
404 STONE v. INS

Opinion of the Court
brid tolling rule the dissent is compelled to devise in orderto give the consolidation provision meaning.

It is worthwhile pausing to consider just how many stepsthe dissent must take to reconcile the consolidation provision
with the tolling rule it prefers. The dissent's construction
would require that the Court conclude, without any briefing,that our decision in

Griggs does not apply to agency review.
The dissent would as well disrupt administrative law in gen-eral by overturning the practice of the Court of Appeals with

the most experience reviewing agency decisions when facedwith agency reconsideration motions made after petition for
review (the District of Columbia Circuit), thereby resolving
a circuit split without any briefing or argument. See post,
at 412. Our construction avoids each of these extraordinary
steps. It creates a practice parallel to that of appellate
courts reviewing district court judgments subject to pending
Rule 60(b) motions filed more than 10 days after judgment
and requires us to take no firm position on whether Griggs
applies to agency review where tolling does occur.

But the full import of our decision in Griggs, and the concomitant problem addressed in Wade, are in some sense secondary to our fundamental point of dispute with the dissent.
In our view the consolidation provision reflects Congress' intent to depart from the normal tolling rule in this context,
whereas on the dissent's view it does not. Congress itself
was explicit in stating that the consolidation provision is an
exception to the applicability of the Hobbs Act procedures,
see supra, at 393, and it took the deliberate step of amending
the Act in 1990 to add the provision. The challenge for the
dissent is not, then, just to give the consolidation provision
some work to do that is consistent with the tolling rule, but
to give it some work as an exception to the applicability of
the Hobbs Act procedures, a meaning that explains why Congress might have taken trouble to add it. The dissent's construction of the consolidation provision gives it effect, if any,
only in what must be those rare instances where aliens first

Opinion of the Court
petition for judicial review and then seek agency reconsider-ation. And, more important, its construction cannot account

for Congress' decision to amend the Act in 1990 to providethat the Hobbs Act procedures, which in the normal course
include the tolling rule, shall apply "except" for the consoli-dation provision.

F
Whatever assessment Congress might have made in enact-ing the judicial review provisions of the INA in the first instance, we conclude from the consolidation provision addedin 1990 that it envisioned two separate petitions filed to review two separate final orders. To be sure, it would havebeen preferable for Congress to have spoken with greater
clarity. Judicial review provisions, however, are jurisdic-tional in nature and must be construed with strict fidelity to
their terms. As we have explained:

"Section 106(a) is intended exclusively to prescribe andregulate a portion of the jurisdiction of the federal

courts. As a jurisdictional statute, it must be construedboth with precision and with fidelity to the terms by
which Congress has expressed its wishes." Cheng FanKwok v. INS, 392 U. S. 206, 212 (1968).

This is all the more true of statutory provisions specifyingthe timing of review, for those time limits are, as we have
often stated, "mandatory and jurisdictional," Missouri v.Jenkins, 495 U. S. 33, 45 (1990), and are not subject to equitable tolling. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 26(b).

* * *
The consolidation provision in $ 106(a)(6) reflects Congress'understanding that a deportation order is final, and reviewable, when issued. Its finality is not affected by the subse-quent filing of a motion to reconsider. The order being final
when issued, an alien has 90 days from that date to seekreview. The alien, if he chooses, may also seek agency re514us2$47l 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT

consideration of the order and seek review of the dispositionupon reconsideration within 90 days of its issuance. Where

the original petition is still before the court, the court shallconsolidate the two petitions. See 8 U. S. C. $ 1105a(a)(6)
(1988 ed., Supp. V).Because Stone's petition was filed more than 90 days after
the issuance of the BIA's July 26, 1991, decision, the Courtof Appeals lacked jurisdiction to review that order.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Breyer, with whom Justice O'Connor and
Justice Souter join, dissenting.

The majority reads $ 106(a) of the Immigration and Na-tionality Act (INA), 8 U. S. C. $ 1105a(a) (1988 ed., Supp. V),

as creating an exception to the ordinary legal rules that gov-ern the interaction of (1) motions for agency reconsideration
with (2) time limits for appeals. In my view, the statutedoes not create such an exception. And, reading it to do so
risks unnecessary complexity in the technical, but important,
matter of how one petitions a court for judicial review of anadverse agency decision. For these reasons, I dissent.

This Court, in ICC v. Locomotive Engineers, 482 U. S. 270(1987), considered the interaction between reconsideration
motions and appeal time limits when one wants to petition acourt of appeals to review an adverse judgment of an administrative agency (which I shall call an "agency/court" appeal).The Court held that this interaction resembled that which
takes place between (1) an appeal from a district court judgment to a court of appeals (which I shall call a "court/court"appeal) and (2) certain motions for district court reconsideration, namely, those filed soon after entry of the district courtjudgment. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(4). The relevant
statute (commonly called the Hobbs Act) said that a petitionfor review of a final agency order may be filed in the court

Breyer, J., dissenting
of appeals "within 60 days after its entry." 28 U. S. C.$ 2344. The Court concluded, on the basis of precedent, that

the filing of a proper petition for reconsideration, "within theperiod allotted for judicial review of the original order . . .
tolls the period for judicial review of the original order."
482 U. S., at 279. That order can "be appealed to the courts. . . after the petition for reconsideration is denied."

Ibid.
See also id., at 284-285.In my view, we should interpret the INA as calling for

tolling, just as we interpreted the Hobbs Act in Locomotive
Engineers. For one thing, the appeals time limit language
in the INA is similar to that in the Hobbs Act. Like the
Hobbs Act, the INA does not mention tolling explicitly; it
simply says that "a petition for review may be filed not later
than 90 days after the date of the issuance of the final deportation order." INA $ 106(a)(1), 8 U. S. C. $ 1105a(a)(1) (1988
ed., Supp. V). More importantly, the INA explicitly states
that the "procedure prescribed by, and all the provisions of
[the Hobbs Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 2341 et seq.,] shall apply to, and
shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for, the judicial review of all final orders of deportation." INA $ 106(a), 8
U. S. C. $ 1105a(a). This statutory phrase is not conclusive
because it is followed by several exceptions, one of which is
the subsection setting the "[t]ime for filing [a] petition" for
review. INA $ 106(a)(1), 8 U. S. C. $ 1105a(a)(1). But, the
context suggests that the reason for calling the latter clause
an exception lies in the number of days permitted for filing--
90 in the INA, as opposed to 60 in the Hobbs Act. Nothing
in the language of $ 106(a) (which was amended three years
after Locomotive Engineers, see Immigration Act of 1990,

$ 545(b), 104 Stat. 5065) suggests any further exception in
respect to tolling.

Finally, interpreting the INA and the Hobbs Act consistently makes it easier for the bar to understand, and to follow,
these highly technical rules. With consistent rules, a nonimmigration-specialist lawyer (say, a lawyer used to working

514us2$47q 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT
408 STONE v. INS

Breyer, J., dissenting
in the ordinary agency/court context) who seeks reconsidera-tion of a Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) decision is less

likely to lose his client's right to appeal simply throughinadvertence.

The majority reaches a different conclusion because it
believes that one subsection of the INA, $ 106(a)(6), is incon-sistent with the ordinary

Locomotive Engineers tolling
rule. That subsection says that

"whenever a petitioner seeks [(1)] review of [a final de-portation] order . . . any [(2)] review sought with respect

to a motion to reopen or reconsider such an order shall
be consolidated with the review of the order." 8U. S. C. $ 1105a(a)(6) (1988 ed., Supp. V).

This "consolidation" subsection, however, says nothing
about tolling. Indeed, it does not address, even in a general
way, the timing of petitions for judicial review; it just sayswhat must happen when two reviews make it separately to

the court of appeals and are on the court's docket at the sametime (

i. e., they must be consolidated). And, the legislative
history is likewise silent on the matter. See, e. g., H. R.Conf. Rep. No. 101-955, pp. 132-133 (1990). Given that

$ 106(a)(6) was enacted only three years after Locomotive
Engineers, it seems unlikely that Congress consciously
created a significantly different approach to the reviewdeadline/reconsideration-petition problem (with the conse-quent risk of confusing lawyers) in so indirect a manner.

Nevertheless, the majority believes this subsection is
inconsistent with the ordinary Locomotive Engineers tolling
rule because application of the ordinary tolling rule would
normally lead an alien to appeal both (1) the original deportation order and (2) a denial of agency reconsideration, in a
single petition, after the denial takes place. Thus, in the
majority's view, one could never find (1) a petition to review
an original deportation order and (2) a petition to review a
denial of a motion to reconsider that order, properly together

409Cite as: 514 U. S. 386 (1995)
Breyer, J., dissenting
in the court of appeals at the same time. And, for that rea-son, there would be nothing to "consolidate" under the statute. An opposite rule (one which denies tolling) would, inthe majority's view, sometimes produce (simultaneously)
both (1) an initial appeal from the original order and (2) an
appeal from a denial of reconsideration (if the reconsidera-tion motion were decided, and the second appeal taken,

before the court could decide the initial appeal). The "no-tolling" rule would therefore sometimes produce two appeals, ready for consolidation. The majority concludes thatit must infer this "no-tolling" rule in order to give the "consolidation" subsection some work to do and thereby make it
legally meaningful.

I do not believe it necessary, however, to create a special
exception from the ordinary Locomotive Engineers tolling
rule in order to make the "consolidation" subsection meaningful, for even under that ordinary tolling rule, the "consolidation" subsection will have work to do. Consider the following case: The BIA enters a final deportation order on Day
Zero. The alien files a timely petition for review in a court
of appeals on Day 50. Circumstances suddenly change--say,
in the alien's home country--and on Day 70 the alien then
files a motion to reopen with the agency. (The majority says
such a filing "must be" a "rare" happening, ante, at 404, but
I do not see why. New circumstances justifying reopening
or reconsideration might arise at any time. Indeed, this situation must arise with some frequency, since INS regulations expressly recognize that a motion to reopen or reconsider may be filed after judicial review has been sought.
See, e. g., 8 CFR $ 3.8(a) (1994) (requiring that motions to
reopen or reconsider state whether the validity of the order
to be reopened has been, or is, the subject of a judicial proceeding).) The agency denies the reconsideration motion on
Day 100. The alien then appeals that denial on Day 110.
In this case, the court of appeals would have before it two
appeals: the appeal filed on Day 50 and the appeal filed on

514us2$47q 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT
410 STONE v. INS

Breyer, J., dissenting
Day 110. The "consolidation" subsection tells the court ofappeals to consolidate those two appeals and decide them

together. (In fact, the alien might well have informed thecourt of appeals, say on Day 70, about the reconsideration
motion, in which case the court, unless it thought the motion
a frivolous stalling device, might have postponed decision onthe merits of the initial appeal, awaiting the results of the

reconsideration decision, an appeal from which it could thenconsolidate with the initial appeal. See,

e. g., Gebremichael
v. INS, 10 F. 3d 28, 33, n. 13 (CA1 1993) (decision on appealstayed until the agency resolved alien's motion for reconsideration; initial appeal then consolidated with the appeal from
the denial of rehearing).) In this example, the subsection
would have meaning as an "exception" to the Hobbs Act, cf.
ante, at 404-405, since nothing in the Hobbs Act requires the
consolidation of court reviews.

The majority understands this counterexample, but rejects it, for fear of creating both a conceptual and a precedential problem. Neither of those perceived problems, however, is significant. The conceptual problem the majority
fears arises out of the fact that, under the ordinary tolling
rule, the filing of a petition for reconsideration is deemed to
render an otherwise "final" initial (but not-yet-appealed)
order "nonfinal" for purposes of court review. Hence, one
may not appeal the merits of that initial order until the district court or agency finally decides the reconsideration petition. The majority believes that the reconsideration petition in the counterexample above (a petition filed after an
appeal is taken from the initial order) also renders "nonfinal," and hence not properly appealable, the initial order,
removing the initial appeal from the court of appeals, and
thereby leaving nothing to consolidate.

The answer to this conceptual argument lies in the "general principle" that "jurisdiction, once vested, is not divested,
although a state of things should arrive in which original
jurisdiction could not be exercised." United States v. The

Breyer, J., dissenting
Little Charles, 26 F. Cas. 979, 982 (No. 15,612) (CC Va. 1818)(Marshall, C. J., Circuit Justice), quoted in

Republic Nat.
Bank of Miami v. United States, 506 U. S. 80 (1992). Thefirst appeal, as of Day 50, has reached the court of appeals.

Thus, conceptually speaking, one should not consider a later
filed motion for reconsideration as having "divested" thecourt of jurisdiction. And, practically speaking, it makes

sense to leave the appeal there, permitting the court of ap-peals to decide it, or to delay it, as circumstances dictate (say,
depending upon the extent to which effort and resources al-ready have been expended in prosecuting and deciding the
appeal). After all, we have long recognized that courts have
inherent power to stay proceedings and "to control the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and
effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants." Landis v.
North American Co., 299 U. S. 248, 254 (1936); cf. 28 U. S. C.

$ 1367(c)(3) (1988 ed., Supp. V) (providing that district court
may, but need not, decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim when it has dismissed all claims over which
it has original jurisdiction).

The precedential problem, in the majority's view, arises
out of Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U. S.
56 (1982) (per curiam), a court/court case in which this Court
held that the filing of a reconsideration motion under Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 59 caused an earlier filed notice of
appeal to " `self-destruc[t],' " 459 U. S., at 61, despite the fact
that the earlier-filed notice had "vested" the Court of Appeals
with "jurisdiction." Were the same principle to apply in the
agency/court context, then the reconsideration motion filed
on Day 70 would cause the earlier filed petition for review,
filed on Day 50, to "self-destruct," leaving nothing for the
court of appeals to consolidate with an eventual appeal from
an agency denial of a reconsideration motion (on Day 100).

Griggs, however, does not apply in the agency/court context. This Court explicitly rested its decision in Griggs
upon the fact that a specific Federal Rule of Appellate Proce514us2$47q 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT
412 STONE v. INS

Breyer, J., dissenting
dure, Rule 4(a)(4), provides for the "self-destruction." ThatRule says that upon the filing of, say, a Rule 59 motion to

amend a district court judgment, a "notice of appeal filedbefore the disposition of [

e. g., that Rule 59 motion] shall have
no effect." By its terms, Rule 4(a)(4) applies only in the
court/court context; and, to my knowledge, there is no com-parable provision applicable in agency/court contexts such as

this one. In the absence of such a provision, Griggs explic-itly adds that the "district courts and courts of appeals

would
both have had the power to modify the same judgment," 459U. S., at 60 (emphasis added)--as I believe the agency and

the Court of Appeals have here.

I recognize that at least one Court of Appeals has adopted
an agency/court rule analogous to the "self-destruct" rule set
forth in Rule 4(a)(4). Wade v. FCC, 986 F. 2d 1433, 1434
(CADC 1993) (per curiam); see also Losh v. Brown, 6 Vet.
App. 87, 89 (1993). But see Berroteran-Melendez v. INS,
955 F. 2d 1251, 1254 (CA9 1992) (court retains jurisdiction
when motion to reopen is filed after the filing of a petition
for judicial review); Lozada v. INS, 857 F. 2d 10, 12 (CA1
1988) (court retained jurisdiction over petition for review
notwithstanding later filed motion to reopen, but held case
in abeyance pending agency's decision on the motion). That
court's conclusion, however, was based upon a single observation: that "[t]he danger of wasted judicial effort that attends the simultaneous exercise of judicial and agency jurisdiction arises whether a party seeks agency reconsideration
before, simultaneous with, or after filing an appeal." Wade,
supra, at 1434 (citations omitted) (referring to the danger
that the agency's ruling might change the order being
appealed, thereby mooting the appeal and wasting any appellate effort expended). While this observation is true
enough, it does not justify the "self-destruct" rule, because
it fails to take into account other important factors, namely,
(a) the principle that jurisdiction, once vested, is generally
not divested, and (b) the fact that, in some cases (say, when

Breyer, J., dissenting
briefing and argument already have been completed in thecourt of appeals) judicial economy may actually weigh

against stripping the court of jurisdiction. On this lastpoint, it is significant that under the Federal Rules, the motions to revise or reopen court judgments that cause an earlier filed appeal to "self-destruct" must be filed within a fewdays after the entry of judgment. See,

e. g., Fed. Rule Civ.
Proc. 4(a)(4) (10 days). The agency rules before us, in con-trast, permit a motion for reconsideration (or reopening) well

after the entry of the agency's final order. See 8 CFR$ 3.8(a) (1994) (no time limit on motion for reconsideration
filed with BIA). See also, e. g., 10 CFR $ 2.734(a)(1) (1995)
(Nuclear Regulatory Commission may consider untimely motion to reopen where "grave issue" raised). This timing difference means that it is less likely in the court/court context
than in the agency/court context that "self-destruction" of
an earlier filed notice of appeal would interrupt (and therefore waste) a court of appeals review already well underway.
Consequently, this Court should not simply assume that the
court/court rule applies in the agency/court context.

The majority ultimately says we ought not decide whether
the "self-destruct" rule applies in the agency/court context.
Ante, at 397, 404. But, the decision cannot be avoided.
That is because the majority's basic argument--that a tolling rule would deprive the consolidation subsection of meaning--depends upon the assumption that the "self-destruct"
rule does apply. And, for the reasons stated above, that assumption is not supported by any statutory or rule-based
authority.

Because this matter is so complicated, an analogy to the
court/court context may help. In that context, in a normal
civil case, a losing party has 30 days to file an appeal (60, if
the Government is a party). Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(1).
The Rules then distinguish between two kinds of reconsideration motions: those filed within 10 days (including motions
for relief from judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Proce514us2$47q 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT
414 STONE v. INS

Breyer, J., dissenting
dure 60(b)), which toll the time for appeal, and those filedafter 10 days (in the main, other Rule 60(b) motions), which

do not toll the time for appeal. See Fed. Rule App. Proc.4(a)(4). When a party files a motion of the first sort (which
I shall call an "immediate" reconsideration motion), a previously filed notice of appeal "self-destructs." Ibid. Whena party files a motion of the second sort (which I shall call a

"distant" reconsideration motion), a previously filed notice ofappeal remains valid. A complex set of rules creates this
system, and lawyers normally refer to those rules in orderto understand what they are supposed to do. See Fed. Rule
App. Proc. 4(a) (and Rules of Civil Procedure cited therein).

Agency reconsideration motions are sometimes like "immediate" court reconsideration motions, filed soon after
entry of a final order, but sometimes they are like "distant"
reconsideration motions, filed long after entry of a final
order. (Petitioner in this case filed his motion 35 days after
entry of an order that he had 90 days to appeal.) The problem before us is that we lack precise rules, comparable to the
Federal Rules of Appellate and Civil Procedure, that distinguish (for appeal preserving purposes) between the "immediate" and the "distant" reconsideration motion. We therefore
must read an immigration statute, silent on these matters,
in one of three possible ways: (1) as creating rules that make
Federal Rules-type distinctions; (2) in effect, as analogizing an agency reconsideration motion to the "distant" court
reconsideration motion (and denying tolling); or (3) in effect, as analogizing an agency reconsideration motion to the
"immediate" court reconsideration motion (and permitting
tolling).

The first possibility is a matter for the appropriate Rules
Committees, not this Court. Those bodies can focus directly
upon the interaction of reconsideration motions and appellate
time limits; they can consider relevant similarities and differences between agency/court and court/court appeals; and
they can consider the relevance of special, immigration514us2$47q 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT

related circumstances, such as the fact that the filing of a
petition for review from a "final" deportation order automatically stays deportation, INA $ 106(a)(3), 8 U. S. C.

$ 1105a(a)(3) (1988 ed., Supp. V). The second possibility
(that adopted by the majority) creates a serious risk of unfair
loss of a right to appeal, because it is inconsistent with Locomotive Engineers (thereby multiplying complexity). And,
it has no basis in the INA, which generally incorporates the
procedures of the Hobbs Act and the text and history of
which simply do not purport to make an exception denying
tolling. The third possibility, in my view, is the best of the
three, for it promotes uniformity in practice among the agencies; it is consistent with the Hobbs Act, whose procedures
the INA generally adopts; and it thereby helps to avoid inadvertent or unfair loss of the right to appeal.

The upshot is that Locomotive Engineers, Griggs, the language of the immigration statute before us, the language of
the Federal Rules, and various practical considerations together argue for an interpretation of INA $ 106(a) that both
(1) permits the filing of a motion for reconsideration to toll
the time for petitioning for judicial review (when no petition
for review has yet been filed), and (2) permits court review
that has already "vested" in the court of appeals to continue
there (when the petition for review was filed prior to the
filing of the motion for reconsideration). This interpretation
simply requires us to read the language of the INA as this
Court read the Hobbs Act in Locomotive Engineers. It
would avoid creating any "Hobson's choice" for the alien, cf.
ante, at 398-399, for an alien could both appeal (thereby obtaining an automatic stay of deportation, INA $ 106(a)(3), 8
U. S. C. $ 1105a(a)(3)), and then also petition for reconsideration. And, it would avoid entrapping the unwary lawyer
who did not immediately file a petition for court review,
thinking that a reconsideration petition would toll the appeal
time limit as it does in other agency/court contexts.

416 STONE v. INS

Breyer, J., dissenting
This approach does not undermine Congress' goal of expe-diting the deportation-order review process. Although the

court of appeals might postpone decision of an appeal pend-ing the agency's decision on a later filed motion to reopen or
reconsider, it need not do so. If the motion is frivolous, or
made for purposes of delay, the INS can call that fact tothe court's attention. And, of course, the agency can simply

decide the motion quickly. The alien could prevent thecourt of appeals from acting by not filing an appeal from the
original order, but, instead (as here) simply filing a reconsid-eration motion. That motion would toll the time for taking
an appeal. But, the fact that the alien would lose the benefit
of the automatic stay would act as a check on aliens filing
frivolous reconsideration motions (without filing an appeal)
solely for purposes of delay.

The majority, and the parties, compare and contrast the
tolling and nontolling rules in various court-efficiency and
delay-related aspects. But, on balance, these considerations
do not argue strongly for one side or the other. When Congress amended the INA in 1990 (adding, among other things,
the consolidation subsection) it did hope to diminish delays.
But, the statute explicitly set forth several ways of directly
achieving this objective. See, e. g., Immigration Act of 1990,

$ 545(a), 104 Stat. 5063 (creating INA $ 242B(d), 8 U. S. C.

$ 1252b(d), directing the Attorney General to issue regulations providing for summary dismissal of, and attorney sanctions for, frivolous administrative appeals); $ 545(b)(1) (reducing time for petitioning for review from 6 months to 90
days); $ 545(d)(1) (directing the Attorney General to issue
regulations limiting the number of motions to reopen and to
reconsider an alien may file and setting a maximum time
period for the filing of such motions); $ 545(d)(2) (directing
the Attorney General to do the same with respect to the
number and timing of administrative appeals). Significantly, the statute did not list an antitolling rule as one of
those ways. At the same time, Congress enacted certain

417Cite as: 514 U. S. 386 (1995)
Breyer, J., dissenting
measures apparently designed to make the deportation-order review process more efficient. See,

e. g., $ 545(d)(2)
(asking the Attorney General to issue regulations specifyingthat the administrative appeal of a deportation order must

be consolidated with the appeal of all motions to reopen or
reconsider that order; providing for the filing of appellateand reply briefs; and identifying the items to be included in

the notice of administrative appeal). In light of these lastmentioned provisions, the consolidation subsection would
seem consistent with Congress' purposes in 1990 even with-out an implicit no-tolling rule.

Indeed, the Attorney General has construed one of these
last mentioned 1990 amendments as authorizing, in a somewhat analogous situation, a tolling provision roughly similar
to that in Locomotive Engineers. In $ 545(d)(2) of the 1990
Act, Congress asked the Attorney General to issue regulations with respect to "the consolidation of motions to reopen
or to reconsider [an Immigration Judge's deportation order]
with the appeal [to the BIA] of [that] order." 104 Stat. 5066
(emphasis added). In response, the Attorney General has
proposed a regulation saying, among other things, that "[a]
motion to reopen a decision rendered by an Immigration
Judge . . . that is pending when an appeal [to the BIA] is filed
. . . shall be deemed a motion to remand [the administrative
appeal] for further proceedings before the Immigration
Judge . . . . Such motion . . . shall be consolidated with, and
considered by the Board [later] in connection with, the appeal to the Board . . . ." 59 Fed. Reg. 29386, 29388 (1994)
(proposed new 8 CFR $ 3.2(c)(4)). See also 59 Fed. Reg., at
29387 (proposed new $ 3.2(b) (parallel provision for motions
to reconsider)). This approach, which is comparable to the
Locomotive Engineers tolling rule, would govern the interaction of administrative appeals and motions to reopen the
decision of an Immigration Judge. It seems logical that
Congress might want the same rule to govern the analogous
situation concerning the interaction of petitions for judicial

Breyer, J., dissenting
review and motions to reconsider or reopen a decision ofthe BIA.

One final point. The INS argues that the Court shoulddefer to one of its regulations, 8 CFR $ 243.1 (1994), which, it
says, interprets INA $ 106(a) as eliminating the tolling rule.See,

e. g., Shalala v. Guernsey Memorial Hospital, ante, at94-95; Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense

Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843 (1984). The regulation inquestion, however, says nothing about tolling. To the contrary, it simply defines "final order of deportation," usinglanguage very similar to the language this Court, in Locomotive Engineers, interpreted as embodying the tolling rule.Compare the regulation here at issue, 8 CFR $ 243.1 (1994)
("[A]n order of deportation . . . shall become final upon [theBIA's] dismissal of an appeal" from the order of a single immigration judge), with the language at issue in Locomotive
Engineers, 49 U. S. C. $ 10327(i) ("[A]n action of the [Inter-state Commerce] Commission . . . is final on the date on

which it is served"). A lawyer reading the regulation sim-ply would not realize that the INS intended to create an
unmentioned exception to a critically important technicalprocedure. Moreover, the INS itself has apparently interpreted the regulation somewhat differently at differenttimes. Compare Brief for Respondent 13-17 (arguing that
the regulation embodies a no-tolling rule) with Chu v. INS,875 F. 2d 777, 779 (CA9 1989) (in which INS argued that a
reconsideration motion makes the initial order nonfinal, andthereby implies tolling). See, e. g., Thomas Jefferson Univ.
v. Shalala, 512 U. S. 504, 514-515 (1994) (inconsistent in-terpretation entitled to "considerably less deference" than
consistently held agency view). For these reasons, I donot accept the INS' claim that its silent regulation creates
a "no tolling" rule.I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

419OCTOBER TERM, 1994
Syllabus

KYLES v. WHITLEY, WARDEN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 93-7927. Argued November 7, 1994--Decided April 19, 1995
Petitioner Kyles was convicted of first-degree murder by a Louisiana jury

and sentenced to death. Following the affirmance of his conviction and
sentence on direct appeal, it was revealed on state collateral review that
the State had never disclosed certain evidence favorable to him. That
evidence included, inter alia, (1) contemporaneous eyewitness statements taken by the police following the murder; (2) various statements
made to the police by an informant known as "Beanie," who was never
called to testify; and (3) a computer printout of license numbers of cars
parked at the crime scene on the night of the murder, which did not list
the number of Kyles's car. The state trial court nevertheless denied
relief, and the State Supreme Court denied Kyles's application for discretionary review. He then sought relief on federal habeas, claiming,
among other things, that his conviction was obtained in violation of
Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, 87, which held that the suppression by
the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused violates due process
where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment. The
Federal District Court denied relief, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed.

Held:

1. Under United States v. Bagley, 473 U. S. 667, four aspects of materiality for Brady purposes bear emphasis. First, favorable evidence is
material, and constitutional error results from its suppression by the
government, if there is a "reasonable probability" that, had the evidence
been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have
been different. Thus, a showing of materiality does not require demonstration by a preponderance that disclosure of the suppressed evidence
would have resulted ultimately in the defendant's acquittal. 473 U. S.,
at 682, 685. United States v. Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 112-113, distinguished. Second, Bagley materiality is not a sufficiency of evidence
test. One does not show a Brady violation by demonstrating that some
of the inculpatory evidence should have been excluded, but by showing
that the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole
case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.
Third, contrary to the Fifth Circuit's assumption, once a reviewing court
applying Bagley has found constitutional error, there is no need for further harmless-error review, since the constitutional standard for materi514us2$48z 05-27-98 17:22:45 PAGES OPINPGT
420 KYLES v. WHITLEY

Syllabus
ality under Bagley imposes a higher burden than the harmless-error
standard of Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 623. Fourth, the
state's disclosure obligation turns on the cumulative effect of all suppressed evidence favorable to the defense, not on the evidence considered item by item. 473 U. S., at 675, and n. 7. Thus, the prosecutor,
who alone can know what is undisclosed, must be assigned the responsibility to gauge the likely net effect of all such evidence and make disclosure when the point of "reasonable probability" is reached. Moreover,
that responsibility remains regardless of any failure by the police to
bring favorable evidence to the prosecutor's attention. To hold otherwise would amount to a serious change of course from the Brady line of
cases. As the more likely reading of the Fifth Circuit's opinion shows
a series of independent materiality evaluations, rather than the cumulative evaluation required by Bagley, it is questionable whether that court
evaluated the significance of the undisclosed evidence in this case under
the correct standard. Pp. 432-441.

2. Because the net effect of the state-suppressed evidence favoring
Kyles raises a reasonable probability that its disclosure would have
produced a different result at trial, the conviction cannot stand, and
Kyles is entitled to a new trial. Pp. 441-454.

(a) A review of the suppressed statements of eyewitnesses--whose
testimony identifying Kyles as the killer was the essence of the State's
case--reveals that their disclosure not only would have resulted in a
markedly weaker case for the prosecution and a markedly stronger one
for the defense, but also would have substantially reduced or destroyed
the value of the State's two best witnesses. Pp. 441-445.

(b) Similarly, a recapitulation of the suppressed statements made
to the police by Beanie--who, by the State's own admission, was essential to its investigation and, indeed, "made the case" against Kyles--
reveals that they were replete with significant inconsistencies and affirmatively self-incriminating assertions, that Beanie was anxious to see
Kyles arrested for the murder, and that the police had a remarkably
uncritical attitude toward Beanie. Disclosure would therefore have
raised opportunities for the defense to attack the thoroughness and even
the good faith of the investigation, and would also have allowed the
defense to question the probative value of certain crucial physical evidence. Pp. 445-449.

(c) While the suppression of the prosecution's list of the cars at the
crime scene after the murder does not rank with the failure to disclose
the other evidence herein discussed, the list would have had some value
as exculpation of Kyles, whose license plate was not included thereon,
and as impeachment of the prosecution's arguments to the jury that the
killer left his car at the scene during the investigation and that a grainy

Opinion of the Court
photograph of the scene showed Kyles's car in the background. It
would also have lent support to an argument that the police were irresponsible in relying on inconsistent statements made by Beanie.
Pp. 450-451.

(d) Although not every item of the State's case would have been
directly undercut if the foregoing Brady evidence had been disclosed, it
is significant that the physical evidence remaining unscathed would, by
the State's own admission, hardly have amounted to overwhelming proof
that Kyles was the murderer. While the inconclusiveness of that
evidence does not prove Kyles's innocence, and the jury might have
found the unimpeached eyewitness testimony sufficient to convict, confidence that the verdict would have been the same cannot survive a
recap of the suppressed evidence and its significance for the prosecution. Pp. 451-454.

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
After his first trial in 1984 ended in a hung jury, petitionerCurtis Lee Kyles was tried again, convicted of first-degree

murder, and sentenced to death. On habeas review, we fol-low the established rule that the state's obligation under
Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), to disclose evidencefavorable to the defense, turns on the cumulative effect of all
such evidence suppressed by the government, and we holdthat the prosecutor remains responsible for gauging that effect regardless of any failure by the police to bring favorableevidence to the prosecutor's attention. Because the net effect of the evidence withheld by the State in this case raises

Opinion of the Court
a reasonable probability that its disclosure would haveproduced a different result, Kyles is entitled to a new trial.

I
Following the mistrial when the jury was unable to reacha verdict, Kyles's subsequent conviction and sentence of

death were affirmed on direct appeal. State v. Kyles, 513So. 2d 265 (La. 1987), cert. denied, 486 U. S. 1027 (1988). On
state collateral review, the trial court denied relief, but theSupreme Court of Louisiana remanded for an evidentiary
hearing on Kyles's claims of newly discovered evidence.During this state-court proceeding, the defense was first able
to present certain evidence, favorable to Kyles, that theState had failed to disclose before or during trial. The state
trial court nevertheless denied relief, and the State SupremeCourt denied Kyles's application for discretionary review.
State ex rel. Kyles v. Butler, 566 So. 2d 386 (La. 1990).Kyles then filed a petition for habeas corpus in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana,which denied the petition. The Court of Appeals for the
Fifth Circuit affirmed by a divided vote. 5 F. 3d 806 (1993).As we explain,

infra, at 440-441, there is reason to questionwhether the Court of Appeals evaluated the significance of

undisclosed evidence under the correct standard. Because"[o]ur duty to search for constitutional error with painstaking care is never more exacting than it is in a capital case,"
Burger v. Kemp, 483 U. S. 776, 785 (1987),1 we granted certio-rari, 511 U. S. 1051 (1994), and now reverse.

1 The dissent suggests that Burger is not authority for error correction
in capital cases, at least when two previous reviewing courts have found
no error. Post, at 457. We explain, infra, at 440-441, that this is not a
case of simple error correction. As for the significance of prior review,
Burger cautions that this Court should not "substitute speculation" for the
"considered opinions" of two lower courts. 483 U. S., at 785. No one
could disagree that "speculative" claims do not carry much weight against
careful evidentiary review by two prior courts. There is nothing speculative, however, about Kyles's Brady claim.

Opinion of the Court

II

A
The record indicates that, at about 2:20 p.m. on Thurs-day, September 20, 1984, 60-year-old Dolores Dye left the

Schwegmann Brothers' store (Schwegmann's) on Old Gen-tilly Road in New Orleans after doing some food shopping.
As she put her grocery bags into the trunk of her red FordLTD, a man accosted her and after a short struggle drew
a revolver, fired into her left temple, and killed her. Thegunman took Dye's keys and drove away in the LTD.

New Orleans police took statements from six eyewit-nesses,

2 who offered various descriptions of the gunman.

They agreed that he was a black man, and four of them saidthat he had braided hair. The witnesses differed significantly, however, in their descriptions of height, age, weight,build, and hair length. Two reported seeing a man of 17 or
18, while another described the gunman as looking as old as28. One witness described him as 5'4" or 5'5", medium build,
140-150 pounds; another described the man as slim and closeto six feet. One witness said he had a mustache; none of the
others spoke of any facial hair at all. One witness said themurderer had shoulder-length hair; another described the
hair as "short."Since the police believed the killer might have driven his
own car to Schwegmann's and left it there when he drove offin Dye's LTD, they recorded the license numbers of the cars
remaining in the parking lots around the store at 9:15 p.m. onthe evening of the murder. Matching these numbers with
registration records produced the names and addresses ofthe owners of the cars, with a notation of any owner's police

2 The record reveals that statements were taken from Edward Williams
and Lionel Plick, both waiting for a bus nearby; Isaac Smallwood, Willie
Jones, and Henry Williams, all working in the Schwegmann's parking lot
at the time of the murder; and Robert Territo, driving a truck waiting at
a nearby traffic light at the moment of the shooting, who gave a statement
to police on Friday, the day after the murder.

record. Despite this list and the eyewitness descriptions,the police had no lead to the gunman until the Saturday evening after the shooting.At 5:30 p.m., on September 22, a man identifying himself
as James Joseph called the police and reported that on theday of the murder he had bought a red Thunderbird from a
friend named Curtis, whom he later identified as petitioner,Curtis Kyles. He said that he had subsequently read about
Dye's murder in the newspapers and feared that the car hepurchased was the victim's. He agreed to meet with the
police.

A few hours later, the informant met New Orleans Detective John Miller, who was wired with a hidden body micro-phone, through which the ensuing conversation was recorded. See App. 221-257 (transcript). The informant nowsaid his name was Joseph Banks and that he was called
Beanie. His actual name was Joseph Wallace.3His story, as well as his name, had changed since his
earlier call. In place of his original account of buying aThunderbird from Kyles on Thursday, Beanie told Miller
that he had not seen Kyles at all on Thursday, id., at 249-250, and had bought a red LTD the previous day, Friday,

id.,
at 221-222, 225. Beanie led Miller to the parking lot of anearby bar, where he had left the red LTD, later identified

as Dye's.Beanie told Miller that he lived with Kyles's brother-in-law
(later identified as Johnny Burns),4 whom Beanie repeatedlycalled his "partner."

Id., at 221. Beanie described Kyles
as slim, about 6-feet tall, 24 or 25 years old, with a "bush"
hairstyle. Id., at 226, 252. When asked if Kyles ever wore

3 Because the informant had so many aliases, we will follow the convention of the court below and refer to him throughout this opinion as Beanie.

4 Johnny Burns is the brother of a woman known as Pinky Burns. A

number of trial witnesses referred to the relationship between Kyles and
Pinky Burns as a common-law marriage (Louisiana's civil law notwithstanding). Kyles is the father of several of Pinky Burns's children.

his hair in plaits, Beanie said that he did but that he "had abush" when Beanie bought the car. Id., at 249.

During the conversation, Beanie repeatedly expressed con-cern that he might himself be a suspect in the murder. He
explained that he had been seen driving Dye's car on Fridayevening in the French Quarter, admitted that he had changed
its license plates, and worried that he "could have beencharged" with the murder on the basis of his possession of
the LTD. Id., at 231, 246, 250. He asked if he would be putin jail.

Id., at 235, 246. Miller acknowledged that Beanie'spossession of the car would have looked suspicious, id., at

247, but reassured him that he "didn't do anything wrong,"
id., at 235.Beanie seemed eager to cast suspicion on Kyles, who allegedly made his living by "robbing people," and had tried tokill Beanie at some prior time. Id., at 228, 245, 251. Beanie
said that Kyles regularly carried two pistols, a .38 and a .32,and that if the police could "set him up good," they could
"get that same gun" used to kill Dye. Id., at 228-229.Beanie rode with Miller and Miller's supervisor, Sgt. James
Eaton, in an unmarked squad car to Desire Street, where hepointed out the building containing Kyles's apartment.

Id.,at 244-246.

Beanie told the officers that after he bought the car, he andhis "partner" (Burns) drove Kyles to Schwegmann's about 9
p.m. on Friday evening to pick up Kyles's car, described asan orange four-door Ford.

5 Id., at 221, 223, 231-232, 242.

When asked where Kyles's car had been parked, Beanie re-plied that it had been "[o]n the same side [of the lot] where

the woman was killed at." Id., at 231. The officers laterdrove Beanie to Schwegmann's, where he indicated the space
where he claimed Kyles's car had been parked. Beanie wenton to say that when he and Burns had brought Kyles to pick

Opinion of the Court
up the car, Kyles had gone to some nearby bushes to retrievea brown purse,

id., at 253-255, which Kyles subsequently hid
in a wardrobe at his apartment. Beanie said that Kyles had"a lot of groceries" in Schwegmann's bags and a new baby's

potty "in the car." Id., at 254-255. Beanie told Eaton that
Kyles's garbage would go out the next day and that if Kyleswas "smart" he would "put [the purse] in [the] garbage."

Id., at 257. Beanie made it clear that he expected some re-ward for his help, saying at one point that he was not "doing
all of this for nothing." Id., at 246. The police repeatedlyassured Beanie that he would not lose the $400 he paid for
the car. Id., at 243, 246.

After the visit to Schwegmann's, Eaton and Miller took
Beanie to a police station where Miller interviewed him
again on the record, which was transcribed and signed by
Beanie, using his alias "Joseph Banks." See id., at 214-220.
This statement, Beanie's third (the telephone call being the
first, then the recorded conversation), repeats some of the
essentials of the second one: that Beanie had purchased a red
Ford LTD from Kyles for $400 on Friday evening; that Kyles
had his hair "combed out" at the time of the sale; and that
Kyles carried a .32 and a .38 with him "all the time."

Portions of the third statement, however, embellished or
contradicted Beanie's preceding story and were even internally inconsistent. Beanie reported that after the sale, he
and Kyles unloaded Schwegmann's grocery bags from the
trunk and back seat of the LTD and placed them in Kyles's
own car. Beanie said that Kyles took a brown purse from
the front seat of the LTD and that they then drove in separate cars to Kyles's apartment, where they unloaded the groceries. Id., at 216-217. Beanie also claimed that, a few
hours later, he and his "partner" Burns went with Kyles to
Schwegmann's, where they recovered Kyles's car and a "big
brown pocket book" from "next to a building." Id., at 218.
Beanie did not explain how Kyles could have picked up his
car and recovered the purse at Schwegmann's, after Beanie

had seen Kyles with both just a few hours earlier. The po-lice neither noted the inconsistencies nor questioned Beanie

about them.Although the police did not thereafter put Kyles under
surveillance, Tr. 94 (Dec. 6, 1984), they learned about events
at his apartment from Beanie, who went there twice on Sun-day. According to a fourth statement by Beanie, this one

given to the chief prosecutor in November (between the firstand second trials), he first went to the apartment about 2
p.m., after a telephone conversation with a police officer whoasked whether Kyles had the gun that was used to kill Dye.
Beanie stayed in Kyles's apartment until about 5 p.m., when
he left to call Detective John Miller. Then he returned
about 7 p.m. and stayed until about 9:30 p.m., when he left
to meet Miller, who also asked about the gun. According to
this fourth statement, Beanie "rode around" with Miller until
3 a.m. on Monday, September 24. Sometime during those
same early morning hours, detectives were sent at Sgt. Eaton's behest to pick up the rubbish outside Kyles's building.
As Sgt. Eaton wrote in an interoffice memorandum, he had
"reason to believe the victims [sic] personal papers and the
Schwegmann's bags will be in the trash." Record, Defendant's Exh. 17.

At 10:40 a.m., Kyles was arrested as he left the apartment,
which was then searched under a warrant. Behind the
kitchen stove, the police found a .32-caliber revolver containing five live rounds and one spent cartridge. Ballistics tests
later showed that this pistol was used to murder Dye. In a
wardrobe in a hallway leading to the kitchen, the officers
found a homemade shoulder holster that fit the murder
weapon. In a bedroom dresser drawer, they discovered two
boxes of ammunition, one containing several .32-caliber
rounds of the same brand as those found in the pistol. Back
in the kitchen, various cans of cat and dog food, some of them
of the brands Dye typically purchased, were found in
Schwegmann's sacks. No other groceries were identified as

possibly being Dye's, and no potty was found. Later thatafternoon at the police station, police opened the rubbish

bags and found the victim's purse, identification, and otherpersonal belongings wrapped in a Schwegmann's sack.

The gun, the LTD, the purse, and the cans of pet food weredusted for fingerprints. The gun had been wiped clean.
Several prints were found on the purse and on the LTD, butnone was identified as Kyles's. Dye's prints were not found
on any of the cans of pet food. Kyles's prints were found,however, on a small piece of paper taken from the front
passenger-side floorboard of the LTD. The crime laboratoryrecorded the paper as a Schwegmann's sales slip, but without
noting what had been printed on it, which was obliterated inthe chemical process of lifting the fingerprints. A second
Schwegmann's receipt was found in the trunk of the LTD,but Kyles's prints were not found on it. Beanie's fingerprints were not compared to any of the fingerprints found.Tr. 97 (Dec. 6, 1984).

The lead detective on the case, John Dillman, put togethera photo lineup that included a photograph of Kyles (but not
of Beanie) and showed the array to five of the six eyewit-nesses who had given statements. Three of them picked the
photograph of Kyles; the other two could not confidentlyidentify Kyles as Dye's assailant.

B
Kyles was indicted for first-degree murder. Before trial,his counsel filed a lengthy motion for disclosure by the State

of any exculpatory or impeachment evidence. The prosecu-tion responded that there was "no exculpatory evidence of
any nature," despite the government's knowledge of the fol-lowing evidentiary items: (1) the six contemporaneous eyewitness statements taken by police following the murder; (2)records of Beanie's initial call to the police; (3) the tape recording of the Saturday conversation between Beanie andofficers Eaton and Miller; (4) the typed and signed statement

Opinion of the Court
given by Beanie on Sunday morning; (5) the computer print-out of license numbers of cars parked at Schwegmann's on

the night of the murder, which did not list the number ofKyles's car; (6) the internal police memorandum calling for
the seizure of the rubbish after Beanie had suggested that
the purse might be found there; and (7) evidence linkingBeanie to other crimes at Schwegmann's and to the unrelated

murder of one Patricia Leidenheimer, committed in Januarybefore the Dye murder.

At the first trial, in November, the heart of the State'scase was eyewitness testimony from four people who were
at the scene of the crime (three of whom had previously
picked Kyles from the photo lineup). Kyles maintained his
innocence, offered supporting witnesses, and supplied an
alibi that he had been picking up his children from school at
the time of the murder. The theory of the defense was that
Kyles had been framed by Beanie, who had planted evidence
in Kyles's apartment and his rubbish for the purposes of
shifting suspicion away from himself, removing an impediment to romance with Pinky Burns, and obtaining reward
money. Beanie did not testify as a witness for either the
defense or the prosecution.

Because the State withheld evidence, its case was much
stronger, and the defense case much weaker, than the full
facts would have suggested. Even so, after four hours of
deliberation, the jury became deadlocked on the issue of
guilt, and a mistrial was declared.

After the mistrial, the chief trial prosecutor, Cliff Strider,
interviewed Beanie. See App. 258-262 (notes of interview).
Strider's notes show that Beanie again changed important
elements of his story. He said that he went with Kyles to
retrieve Kyles's car from the Schwegmann's lot on Thursday,
the day of the murder, at some time between 5 and 7:30 p.m.,
not on Friday, at 9 p.m., as he had said in his second and
third statements. (Indeed, in his second statement, Beanie
said that he had not seen Kyles at all on Thursday. Id., at

Opinion of the Court
249-250.) He also said, for the first time, that when theyhad picked up the car they were accompanied not only by

Johnny Burns but also by Kevin Black, who had testified forthe defense at the first trial. Beanie now claimed that after
getting Kyles's car they went to Black's house, retrieved a
number of bags of groceries, a child's potty, and a brownpurse, all of which they took to Kyles's apartment. Beanie

also stated that on the Sunday after the murder he had beenat Kyles's apartment two separate times. Notwithstanding
the many inconsistencies and variations among Beanie'sstatements, neither Strider's notes nor any of the other notes
and transcripts were given to the defense.

In December 1984, Kyles was tried a second time. Again,
the heart of the State's case was the testimony of four eyewitnesses who positively identified Kyles in front of the jury.
The prosecution also offered a blown-up photograph taken at
the crime scene soon after the murder, on the basis of which
the prosecutors argued that a seemingly two-toned car in the
background of the photograph was Kyles's. They repeatedly suggested during cross-examination of defense witnesses that Kyles had left his own car at Schwegmann's on
the day of the murder and had retrieved it later, a theory for
which they offered no evidence beyond the blown-up photograph. Once again, Beanie did not testify.

As in the first trial, the defense contended that the eyewitnesses were mistaken. Kyles's counsel called several
individuals, including Kevin Black, who testified to seeing
Beanie, with his hair in plaits, driving a red car similar to
the victim's about an hour after the killing. Tr. 209 (Dec. 7,
1984). Another witness testified that Beanie, with his hair
in braids, had tried to sell him the car on Thursday evening,
shortly after the murder. Id., at 234-235. Another witness
testified that Beanie, with his hair in a "Jheri curl," had attempted to sell him the car on Friday. Id., at 249-251. One
witness, Beanie's "partner," Burns, testified that he had seen
Beanie on Sunday at Kyles's apartment, stooping down near

Opinion of the Court
the stove where the gun was eventually found, and the de-fense presented testimony that Beanie was romantically interested in Pinky Burns. To explain the pet food found inKyles's apartment, there was testimony that Kyles's family
kept a dog and cat and often fed stray animals in theneighborhood.

Finally, Kyles again took the stand. Denying any involve-ment in the shooting, he explained his fingerprints on the
cash register receipt found in Dye's car by saying thatBeanie had picked him up in a red car on Friday, September
21, and had taken him to Schwegmann's, where he purchased
transmission fluid and a pack of cigarettes. He suggested
that the receipt may have fallen from the bag when he re-moved the cigarettes.

On rebuttal, the prosecutor had Beanie brought into thecourtroom. All of the testifying eyewitnesses, after viewing Beanie standing next to Kyles, reaffirmed their previousidentifications of Kyles as the murderer. Kyles was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death.Beanie received a total of $1,600 in reward money. See Tr.
of Hearing on Post-Conviction Relief 19-20 (Feb. 24, 1989);
id., at 114 (Feb. 20, 1989).Following direct appeal, it was revealed in the course of

state collateral review that the State had failed to discloseevidence favorable to the defense. After exhausting state
remedies, Kyles sought relief on federal habeas, claiming,among other things, that the evidence withheld was material
to his defense and that his conviction was thus obtained inviolation of

Brady. Although the United States District
Court denied relief and the Fifth Circuit affirmed,6 Judge

6 Pending appeal, Kyles filed a motion under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 60(b)(2) and (6) to reopen the District Court judgment. In that
motion, he charged that one of the eyewitnesses who testified against him
at trial committed perjury. In the witness's accompanying affidavit, Darlene Kersh (formerly Cahill), the only such witness who had not given
a contemporaneous statement, swears that she told the prosecutors and

III
The prosecution's affirmative duty to disclose evidence fa-vorable to a defendant can trace its origins to early 20thcentury strictures against misrepresentation and is of coursemost prominently associated with this Court's decision in
Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963). See id., at 86 (rely-ing on Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U. S. 103, 112 (1935), and
Pyle v. Kansas, 317 U. S. 213, 215-216 (1942)). Brady held"that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process wherethe evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment,
irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution."373 U. S., at 87; see

Moore v. Illinois, 408 U. S. 786, 794-795

detectives she did not have an opportunity to view the assailant's face and
could not identify him. Nevertheless, Kersh identified Kyles untruthfully, she says, after being "told by some people . . . [who] I think . . . were
district attorneys and police, that the murderer would be the guy seated
at the table with the attorney and that that was the one I should identify
as the murderer. One of the people there was at the D. A.'s table at the
trial. To the best of my knowledge there was only one black man sitting
at the counsel table and I pointed him out as the one I had seen shoot the
lady." Kersh claims to have agreed to the State's wishes only after the
police and district attorneys assured her that "all the other evidence
pointed to [Kyles] as the killer." Affidavit of Darlene Kersh 5, 7.

The District Court denied the motion as an abuse of the writ, although
its order was vacated by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit with
instructions to deny the motion on the ground that a petitioner may not
use a Rule 60(b) motion to raise constitutional claims not included in the
original habeas petition. That ruling is not before us. After denial of
his Rule 60(b) motion, Kyles again sought state collateral review on the
basis of Kersh's affidavit. The Supreme Court of Louisiana granted discretionary review and ordered the trial court to conduct an evidentiary
hearing; all state proceedings are currently stayed pending our review of
Kyles's federal habeas petition.

Opinion of the Court
(1972). In United States v. Agurs, 427 U. S. 97 (1976), however, it became clear that a defendant's failure to request
favorable evidence did not leave the Government free of all
obligation. There, the Court distinguished three situations
in which a Brady claim might arise: first, where previously
undisclosed evidence revealed that the prosecution introduced trial testimony that it knew or should have known was
perjured, 427 U. S., at 103-104; 7 second, where the Government failed to accede to a defense request for disclosure of
some specific kind of exculpatory evidence, id., at 104-107;
and third, where the Government failed to volunteer exculpatory evidence never requested, or requested only in a
general way. The Court found a duty on the part of the
Government even in this last situation, though only when
suppression of the evidence would be "of sufficient significance to result in the denial of the defendant's right to a fair
trial." Id., at 108.

In the third prominent case on the way to current Brady
law, United States v. Bagley, 473 U. S. 667 (1985), the Court
disavowed any difference between exculpatory and impeachment evidence for Brady purposes, and it abandoned the distinction between the second and third Agurs circumstances,
i. e., the "specific-request" and "general- or no-request" situations. Bagley held that regardless of request, favorable evidence is material, and constitutional error results from its
suppression by the government, "if there is a reasonable
probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been differ7 The Court noted that "a conviction obtained by the knowing use of
perjured testimony is fundamentally unfair, and must be set aside if there
is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected
the judgment of the jury." Agurs, 427 U. S., at 103 (footnote omitted).
As the ruling pertaining to Kersh's affidavit is not before us, we do not
consider the question whether Kyles's conviction was obtained by the
knowing use of perjured testimony and our decision today does not address any claim under the first Agurs category. See n. 6, supra.

Opinion of the Court
ent." 473 U. S., at 682 (opinion of Blackmun, J.); id., at 685(White, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).

Four aspects of materiality under Bagley bear emphasis.Although the constitutional duty is triggered by the potential impact of favorable but undisclosed evidence, a showing of materiality does not require demonstration by a pre-ponderance that disclosure of the suppressed evidence

would have resulted ultimately in the defendant's acquittal(whether based on the presence of reasonable doubt or acceptance of an explanation for the crime that does not incul-pate the defendant).

Id., at 682 (opinion of Blackmun, J.)
(adopting formulation announced in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 694 (1984)); Bagley, supra, at 685 (White,
J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (same);
see 473 U. S., at 680 (opinion of Blackmun, J.) (Agurs "rejected
a standard that would require the defendant to demonstrate
that the evidence if disclosed probably would have resulted
in acquittal"); cf. Strickland, supra, at 693 ("[W]e believe
that a defendant need not show that counsel's deficient conduct more likely than not altered the outcome in the case");
Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U. S. 157, 175 (1986) ("[A] defendant
need not establish that the attorney's deficient performance
more likely than not altered the outcome in order to establish
prejudice under Strickland"). Bagley's touchstone of materiality is a "reasonable probability" of a different result, and
the adjective is important. The question is not whether the
defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in its absence he
received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence. A "reasonable probability" of a
different result is accordingly shown when the government's
evidentiary suppression "undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial." Bagley, 473 U. S., at 678.

The second aspect of Bagley materiality bearing emphasis
here is that it is not a sufficiency of evidence test. A defendant need not demonstrate that after discounting the incul514us2$48m 05-27-98 17:22:46 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
patory evidence in light of the undisclosed evidence, therewould not have been enough left to convict. The possibility

of an acquittal on a criminal charge does not imply an insuf-ficient evidentiary basis to convict. One does not show a
Brady violation by demonstrating that some of the inculpa-tory evidence should have been excluded, but by showing
that the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to putthe whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.8Third, we note that, contrary to the assumption made by
the Court of Appeals, 5 F. 3d, at 818, once a reviewing courtapplying

Bagley has found constitutional error there is noneed for further harmless-error review. Assuming, arguendo, that a harmless-error enquiry were to apply, a Bagleyerror could not be treated as harmless, since "a reasonable
probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been differ-ent," 473 U. S., at 682 (opinion of Blackmun, J.);

id., at 685
(White, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment),necessarily entails the conclusion that the suppression must

have had " `substantial and injurious effect or influence indetermining the jury's verdict,' "

Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507
U. S. 619, 623 (1993), quoting Kotteakos v. United States, 328
U. S. 750, 776 (1946). This is amply confirmed by the devel-opment of the respective governing standards. Although

8 This rule is clear, and none of the Brady cases has ever suggested that
sufficiency of evidence (or insufficiency) is the touchstone. And yet the
dissent appears to assume that Kyles must lose because there would still
have been adequate evidence to convict even if the favorable evidence had
been disclosed. See post, at 463 (possibility that Beanie planted evidence
"is perfectly consistent" with Kyles's guilt), ibid. ("[T]he jury could well
have believed [portions of the defense theory] and yet have condemned
petitioner because it could not believe that all four of the eyewitnesses
were similarly mistaken"), post, at 468 (the Brady evidence would have
left two prosecution witnesses "totally untouched"), 469 (Brady evidence
"can be logically separated from the incriminating evidence that would
have remained unaffected").

436 KYLES v. WHITLEY

Opinion of the Court
Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18, 24 (1967), held that aconviction tainted by constitutional error must be set aside

unless the error complained of "was harmless beyond a rea-sonable doubt," we held in Brecht that the standard of harmlessness generally to be applied in habeas cases is the Kotteakos formulation (previously applicable only in reviewingnonconstitutional errors on direct appeal), Brecht, supra, at

622-623. Under Kotteakos a conviction may be set asideonly if the error "had substantial and injurious effect or
influence in determining the jury's verdict." Kotteakos,supra, at 776. Agurs, however, had previously rejected
Kotteakos as the standard governing constitutional disclo-sure claims, reasoning that "the constitutional standard of
materiality must impose a higher burden on the defendant."
Agurs, 427 U. S., at 112. Agurs thus opted for its formula-tion of materiality, later adopted as the test for prejudice in

Strickland, only after expressly noting that this standardwould recognize reversible constitutional error only when
the harm to the defendant was greater than the harm suffi-cient for reversal under

Kotteakos. In sum, once there hasbeen Bagley error as claimed in this case, it cannot subsequently be found harmless under Brecht.9The fourth and final aspect of Bagley materiality to be
stressed here is its definition in terms of suppressed evidenceconsidered collectively, not item by item.

10 As Justice

Blackmun emphasized in the portion of his opinion writtenfor the Court, the Constitution is not violated every time the

9 See also Hill v. Lockhart, 28 F. 3d 832, 839 (CA8 1994) ("[I]t is unnecessary to add a separate layer of harmless-error analysis to an evaluation of
whether a petitioner in a habeas case has presented a constitutionally
significant claim for ineffective assistance of counsel").

10 The dissent accuses us of overlooking this point and of assuming that

the favorable significance of a given item of undisclosed evidence is enough
to demonstrate a Brady violation. We evaluate the tendency and force of
the undisclosed evidence item by item; there is no other way. We evaluate its cumulative effect for purposes of materiality separately and at the
end of the discussion, at Part IV-D, infra.

514us2$48m 05-27-98 17:22:46 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
government fails or chooses not to disclose evidence thatmight prove helpful to the defense. 473 U. S., at 675, and

n. 7. We have never held that the Constitution demands anopen file policy (however such a policy might work out in
practice), and the rule in Bagley (and, hence, in Brady) requires less of the prosecution than the ABA Standards forCriminal Justice, which call generally for prosecutorial disclosures of any evidence tending to exculpate or mitigate.See ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Prosecution Function and Defense Function 3-3.11(a) (3d ed. 1993) ("A prose-cutor should not intentionally fail to make timely disclosure
to the defense, at the earliest feasible opportunity, of the
existence of all evidence or information which tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigate the offense charged
or which would tend to reduce the punishment of the accused"); ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct 3.8(d)
(1984) ("The prosecutor in a criminal case shall . . . make
timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or information known to the prosecutor that tends to negate the guilt
of the accused or mitigates the offense").

While the definition of Bagley materiality in terms of the
cumulative effect of suppression must accordingly be seen as
leaving the government with a degree of discretion, it must
also be understood as imposing a corresponding burden. On
the one side, showing that the prosecution knew of an item
of favorable evidence unknown to the defense does not
amount to a Brady violation, without more. But the prosecution, which alone can know what is undisclosed, must be
assigned the consequent responsibility to gauge the likely
net effect of all such evidence and make disclosure when the
point of "reasonable probability" is reached. This in turn
means that the individual prosecutor has a duty to learn of
any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the
government's behalf in the case, including the police. But
whether the prosecutor succeeds or fails in meeting this obligation (whether, that is, a failure to disclose is in good faith

514us2$48m 05-27-98 17:22:46 PAGES OPINPGT
438 KYLES v. WHITLEY

Opinion of the Court
or bad faith, see Brady, 373 U. S., at 87), the prosecution's
responsibility for failing to disclose known, favorable evidence rising to a material level of importance is inescapable.

The State of Louisiana would prefer an even more lenient
rule. It pleads that some of the favorable evidence in issue
here was not disclosed even to the prosecutor until after
trial, Brief for Respondent 25, 27, 30, 31, and it suggested
below that it should not be held accountable under Bagley
and Brady for evidence known only to police investigators
and not to the prosecutor.11 To accommodate the State in
this manner would, however, amount to a serious change of
course from the Brady line of cases. In the State's favor
it may be said that no one doubts that police investigators
sometimes fail to inform a prosecutor of all they know. But
neither is there any serious doubt that "procedures and regulations can be established to carry [the prosecutor's] burden
and to insure communication of all relevant information on
each case to every lawyer who deals with it." Giglio v.
United States, 405 U. S. 150, 154 (1972). Since, then, the
prosecutor has the means to discharge the government's
Brady responsibility if he will, any argument for excusing a
prosecutor from disclosing what he does not happen to know
about boils down to a plea to substitute the police for the
prosecutor, and even for the courts themselves, as the final
arbiters of the government's obligation to ensure fair trials.

Short of doing that, we were asked at oral argument to
raise the threshold of materiality because the Bagley standard "makes it difficult . . . to know" from the "perspective [of
the prosecutor at] trial . . . exactly what might become important later on." Tr. of Oral Arg. 33. The State asks for "a
certain amount of leeway in making a judgment call" as to
the disclosure of any given piece of evidence. Ibid.

11 The State's counsel retreated from this suggestion at oral argument,
conceding that the State is "held to a disclosure standard based on what
all State officers at the time knew." Tr. of Oral Arg. 40.

439Cite as: 514 U. S. 419 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
Uncertainty about the degree of further "leeway" thatmight satisfy the State's request for a "certain amount" of it

is the least of the reasons to deny the request. At bottom,what the State fails to recognize is that, with or without
more leeway, the prosecution cannot be subject to any disclosure obligation without at some point having the responsibil-ity to determine when it must act. Indeed, even if due process were thought to be violated by every failure to disclosean item of exculpatory or impeachment evidence (leaving
harmless error as the government's only fallback), the prose-cutor would still be forced to make judgment calls about
what would count as favorable evidence, owing to the very
fact that the character of a piece of evidence as favorable
will often turn on the context of the existing or potential
evidentiary record. Since the prosecutor would have to exercise some judgment even if the State were subject to this
most stringent disclosure obligation, it is hard to find merit
in the State's complaint over the responsibility for judgment
under the existing system, which does not tax the prosecutor
with error for any failure to disclose, absent a further showing of materiality. Unless, indeed, the adversary system of
prosecution is to descend to a gladiatorial level unmitigated
by any prosecutorial obligation for the sake of truth, the
government simply cannot avoid responsibility for knowing
when the suppression of evidence has come to portend such
an effect on a trial's outcome as to destroy confidence in its
result.

This means, naturally, that a prosecutor anxious about
tacking too close to the wind will disclose a favorable piece
of evidence. See Agurs, 427 U. S., at 108 ("[T]he prudent
prosecutor will resolve doubtful questions in favor of disclosure"). This is as it should be. Such disclosure will serve
to justify trust in the prosecutor as "the representative . . .
of a sovereignty . . . whose interest . . . in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall
be done." Berger v. United States, 295 U. S. 78, 88 (1935).

440 KYLES v. WHITLEY

Opinion of the Court
And it will tend to preserve the criminal trial, as distinctfrom the prosecutor's private deliberations, as the chosen

forum for ascertaining the truth about criminal accusations.See

Rose v. Clark, 478 U. S. 570, 577-578 (1986); Estes v.
Texas, 381 U. S. 532, 540 (1965); United States v. Leon, 468
U. S. 897, 900-901 (1984) (recognizing general goal of estab-lishing "procedures under which criminal defendants are `acquitted or convicted on the basis of all the evidence whichexposes the truth' " (quoting

Alderman v. United States, 394
U. S. 165, 175 (1969)). The prudence of the careful prosecu-tor should not therefore be discouraged.

There is room to debate whether the two judges in the
majority in the Court of Appeals made an assessment of the
cumulative effect of the evidence. Although the majority's
Brady discussion concludes with the statement that the
court was not persuaded of the reasonable probability that
Kyles would have obtained a favorable verdict if the jury
had been "exposed to any or all of the undisclosed materials,"
5 F. 3d, at 817, the opinion also contains repeated references
dismissing particular items of evidence as immaterial and so
suggesting that cumulative materiality was not the touchstone. See, e. g., id., at 812 ("We do not agree that this
statement made the transcript material and so mandated
disclosure . . . . Beanie's statement . . . is itself not decisive"), 814 ("The nondisclosure of this much of the transcript
was insignificant"), 815 ("Kyles has not shown on this basis
that the three statements were material"), 815 ("In light of
the entire record . . . we cannot conclude that [police reports
relating to discovery of the purse in the trash] would, in reasonable probability, have moved the jury to embrace the theory it otherwise discounted"), 816 ("We are not persuaded
that these notes [relating to discovery of the gun] were material"), 816 ("[W]e are not persuaded that [the printout of the
license plate numbers] would, in reasonable probability, have

Opinion of the Court
ence"). The result reached by the Fifth Circuit majority iscompatible with a series of independent materiality evaluations, rather than the cumulative evaluation required byBagley, as the ensuing discussion will show.

IV
In this case, disclosure of the suppressed evidence to com-petent counsel would have made a different result reasonably probable. A

As the District Court put it, "the essence of the State'scase" was the testimony of eyewitnesses, who identified
Kyles as Dye's killer. 5 F. 3d, at 853 (Appendix A). Disclo-sure of their statements would have resulted in a markedly
weaker case for the prosecution and a markedly strongerone for the defense. To begin with, the value of two of
those witnesses would have been substantially reduced ordestroyed.

The State rated Henry Williams as its best witness, whotestified that he had seen the struggle and the actual shooting by Kyles. The jury would have found it helpful to probethis conclusion in the light of Williams's contemporaneous
statement, in which he told the police that the assailant was"a black male, about 19 or 20 years old, about 5'4" or 5'5", 140
to 150 pounds, medium build" and that "his hair looked likeit was platted." App. 197. If cross-examined on this description, Williams would have had trouble explaining how
he could have described Kyles, 6-feet tall and thin, as a manmore than half a foot shorter with a medium build.

12 Indeed, since Beanie was 22 years old, 5'5" tall, and 159 pounds,

12 The record makes numerous references to Kyles being approximately
six feet tall and slender; photographs in the record tend to confirm these
descriptions. The description of Beanie in the text comes from his police
file. Record photographs of Beanie also depict a man possessing a medium build.

the defense would have had a compelling argument that

The trial testimony of a second eyewitness, Isaac Smallwood, was equally damning to Kyles. He testified that
Kyles was the assailant, and that he saw him struggle with
Dye. He said he saw Kyles take a ".32, a small black gun"
out of his right pocket, shoot Dye in the head, and drive off
in her LTD. When the prosecutor asked him whether he
actually saw Kyles shoot Dye, Smallwood answered "Yeah."
Tr. 41-48 (Dec. 6, 1984).

Smallwood's statement taken at the parking lot, however,
was vastly different. Immediately after the crime, Small13 The defense could have further underscored the possibility that
Beanie was Dye's killer through cross-examination of the police on their
failure to direct any investigation against Beanie. If the police had disclosed Beanie's statements, they would have been forced to admit that
their informant Beanie described Kyles as generally wearing his hair in a
"bush" style (and so wearing it when he sold the car to Beanie), whereas
Beanie wore his in plaits. There was a considerable amount of such
Brady evidence on which the defense could have attacked the investigation as shoddy. The police failed to disclose that Beanie had charges
pending against him for a theft at the same Schwegmann's store and was
a primary suspect in the January 1984 murder of Patricia Leidenheimer,
who, like Dye, was an older woman shot once in the head during an armed
robbery. (Even though Beanie was a primary suspect in the Leidenheimer murder as early as September, he was not interviewed by the
police about it until after Kyles's second trial in December. Beanie confessed his involvement in the murder, but was never charged in connection
with it.) These were additional reasons for Beanie to ingratiate himself
with the police and for the police to treat him with a suspicion they did not
show. Indeed, notwithstanding Justice Scalia's suggestion that Beanie
would have been "stupid" to inject himself into the investigation, post, at
461, the Brady evidence would have revealed at least two motives for
Beanie to come forward: he was interested in reward money and he was
worried that he was already a suspect in Dye's murder (indeed, he had
been seen driving the victim's car, which had been the subject of newspaper and television reports). See supra, at 425-426. For a discussion of
further Brady evidence to attack the investigation, see especially Part
IV-B, infra.

Opinion of the Court
wood claimed that he had not seen the actual murder and
had not seen the assailant outside the vehicle. "I heard a
lound [sic] pop," he said. "When I looked around I saw a
lady laying on the ground, and there was a red car coming
toward me." App. 189. Smallwood said that he got a look
at the culprit, a black teenage male with a mustache and
shoulder-length braided hair, as the victim's red Thunderbird
passed where he was standing. When a police investigator
specifically asked him whether he had seen the assailant
outside the car, Smallwood answered that he had not; the
gunman "was already in the car and coming toward me."
Id., at 188-190.

A jury would reasonably have been troubled by the adjustments to Smallwood's original story by the time of the second trial. The struggle and shooting, which earlier he had
not seen, he was able to describe with such detailed clarity
as to identify the murder weapon as a small black .32-caliber
pistol, which, of course, was the type of weapon used. His
description of the victim's car had gone from a "Thunderbird" to an "LTD"; and he saw fit to say nothing about the
assailant's shoulder-length hair and moustache, details noted
by no other eyewitness. These developments would have
fueled a withering cross-examination, destroying confidence
in Smallwood's story and raising a substantial implication
that the prosecutor had coached him to give it.14

14 The implication of coaching would have been complemented by the
fact that Smallwood's testimony at the second trial was much more precise
and incriminating than his testimony at the first, which produced a hung
jury. At the first trial, Smallwood testified that he looked around only
after he heard something go off, that Dye was already on the ground, and
that he "watched the guy get in the car." Tr. 50-51 (Nov. 26, 1984).
When asked to describe the killer, Smallwood stated that he "just got a
glance of him from the side" and "couldn't even get a look in the face."
Id., at 52, 54.

The State contends that this change actually cuts in its favor under
Brady, since it provided Kyles's defense with grounds for impeachment

444 KYLES v. WHITLEY

Opinion of the Court
Since the evolution over time of a given eyewitness's de-scription can be fatal to its reliability, cf. Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U. S. 98, 114 (1977) (reliability depends in part onthe accuracy of prior description); Neil v. Biggers, 409 U. S.
188, 199 (1972) (reliability of identification following imper-missibly suggestive lineup depends in part on accuracy of
witness's prior description), the Smallwood and Williamsidentifications would have been severely undermined by use
of their suppressed statements. The likely damage is bestunderstood by taking the word of the prosecutor, who contended during closing arguments that Smallwood and Wil-liams were the State's two best witnesses. See Tr. of Closing Arg. 49 (Dec. 7, 1984) (After discussing Territo's andKersh's testimony: "Isaac Smallwood, have you ever seen a
better witness[?] . . . What's better than that is HenryWilliams. . . . Henry Williams was the closest of them all

without any need to disclose Smallwood's statement. Brief for Respondent 17-18. This is true, but not true enough; inconsistencies between the
two bodies of trial testimony provided opportunities for chipping away
on cross-examination but not for the assault that was warranted. While
Smallwood's testimony at the first trial was similar to his contemporaneous account in some respects (for example, he said he looked around only
after he heard the gunshot and that Dye was already on the ground), it
differed in one of the most important: Smallwood's version at the first trial
already included his observation of the gunman outside the car. Defense
counsel was not, therefore, clearly put on notice that Smallwood's capacity
to identify the killer's body type was open to serious attack; even less was
he informed that Smallwood had answered "no" when asked if he had seen
the killer outside the car. If Smallwood had in fact seen the gunman only
after the assailant had entered Dye's car, as he said in his original statement, it would have been difficult if not impossible for him to notice two
key characteristics distinguishing Kyles from Beanie, their heights and
builds. Moreover, in the first trial, Smallwood specifically stated that the
killer's hair was "kind of like short . . . knotted up on his head." Tr. 60
(Nov. 26, 1984). This description was not inconsistent with his testimony
at the second trial but directly contradicted his statement at the scene of
the murder that the killer had shoulder-length hair. The dissent says that
Smallwood's testimony would have been "barely affected" by the expected
impeachment, post, at 468; that would have been a brave jury argument.

right here"). Nor, of course, would the harm to the State'scase on identity have been confined to their testimony alone.

The fact that neither Williams nor Smallwood could haveprovided a consistent eyewitness description pointing to
Kyles would have undercut the prosecution all the more be-cause the remaining eyewitnesses called to testify (Territo
and Kersh) had their best views of the gunman only as hefled the scene with his body partly concealed in Dye's car.
And even aside from such important details, the effectiveimpeachment of one eyewitness can call for a new trial even
though the attack does not extend directly to others, as wehave said before. See

Agurs, 427 U. S., at 112-113, n. 21.

B
Damage to the prosecution's case would not have been con-fined to evidence of the eyewitnesses, for Beanie's various

statements would have raised opportunities to attack notonly the probative value of crucial physical evidence and the
circumstances in which it was found, but the thoroughnessand even the good faith of the investigation, as well. By the
State's own admission, Beanie was essential to its investiga-tion and, indeed, "made the case" against Kyles. Tr. of Closing Arg. 13 (Dec. 7, 1984). Contrary to what one might hopefor from such a source, however, Beanie's statements to the
police were replete with inconsistencies and would have al-lowed the jury to infer that Beanie was anxious to see Kyles
arrested for Dye's murder. Their disclosure would have re-vealed a remarkably uncritical attitude on the part of the
police.If the defense had called Beanie as an adverse witness, he
could not have said anything of any significance withoutbeing trapped by his inconsistencies. A short recapitulation
of some of them will make the point. In Beanie's initialmeeting with the police, and in his signed statement, he said
he bought Dye's LTD and helped Kyles retrieve his car fromthe Schwegmann's lot on Friday. In his first call to the po514us2$48m 05-27-98 17:22:46 PAGES OPINPGT
446 KYLES v. WHITLEY

Opinion of the Court
lice, he said he bought the LTD on Thursday, and in his conversation with the prosecutor between trials it was again on
Thursday that he said he helped Kyles retrieve Kyles's car.
Although none of the first three versions of this story mentioned Kevin Black as taking part in the retrieval of the car
and transfer of groceries, after Black implicated Beanie by
his testimony for the defense at the first trial, Beanie
changed his story to include Black as a participant. In
Beanie's several accounts, Dye's purse first shows up variously next to a building, in some bushes, in Kyles's car, and
at Black's house.

Even if Kyles's lawyer had followed the more conservative
course of leaving Beanie off the stand, though, the defense
could have examined the police to good effect on their knowledge of Beanie's statements and so have attacked the reliability of the investigation in failing even to consider Beanie's
possible guilt and in tolerating (if not countenancing) serious
possibilities that incriminating evidence had been planted.
See, e. g., Bowen v. Maynard, 799 F. 2d 593, 613 (CA10 1986)
("A common trial tactic of defense lawyers is to discredit
the caliber of the investigation or the decision to charge the
defendant, and we may consider such use in assessing a possible Brady violation"); Lindsey v. King, 769 F. 2d 1034, 1042
(CA5 1985) (awarding new trial of prisoner convicted in Louisiana state court because withheld Brady evidence "carried
within it the potential . . . for the . . . discrediting . . . of the
police methods employed in assembling the case").15

15 The dissent, post, at 464, suggests that for jurors to count the sloppiness of the investigation against the probative force of the State's evidence
would have been irrational, but of course it would have been no such thing.
When, for example, the probative force of evidence depends on the circumstances in which it was obtained and those circumstances raise a possibility of fraud, indications of conscientious police work will enhance probative
force and slovenly work will diminish it. See discussion of purse and gun,
infra, at 447-449.

Opinion of the Court
By demonstrating the detectives' knowledge of Beanie'saffirmatively self-incriminating statements, the defense

could have laid the foundation for a vigorous argument thatthe police had been guilty of negligence. In his initial meeting with police, Beanie admitted twice that he changed the
license plates on the LTD. This admission enhanced thesuspiciousness of his possession of the car; the defense could

have argued persuasively that he was no bona fide purchaser.And when combined with his police record, evidence of prior
criminal activity near Schwegmann's, and his status as a sus-pect in another murder, his devious behavior gave reason to
believe that he had done more than buy a stolen car. There
was further self-incrimination in Beanie's statement that
Kyles's car was parked in the same part of the Schwegmann's
lot where Dye was killed. Beanie's apparent awareness of
the specific location of the murder could have been based, as
the State contends, on television or newspaper reports, but
perhaps it was not. Cf. App. 215 (Beanie saying that he
knew about the murder because his brother-in-law had seen
it "on T. V. and in the paper" and had told Beanie). Since
the police admittedly never treated Beanie as a suspect, the
defense could thus have used his statements to throw the
reliability of the investigation into doubt and to sully the
credibility of Detective Dillman, who testified that Beanie
was never a suspect, Tr. 103-105, 107 (Dec. 6, 1984), and that
he had "no knowledge" that Beanie had changed the license
plate, id., at 95.

The admitted failure of the police to pursue these pointers
toward Beanie's possible guilt could only have magnified the
effect on the jury of explaining how the purse and the gun
happened to be recovered. In Beanie's original recorded
statement, he told the police that "[Kyles's] garbage goes out
tomorrow," and that "if he's smart he'll put [the purse] in
[the] garbage." App. 257. These statements, along with
the internal memorandum stating that the police had "reason
to believe" Dye's personal effects and Schwegmann's bags

Opinion of the Court
would be in the garbage, would have supported the defense'stheory that Beanie was no mere observer, but was determining the investigation's direction and success. The potentialfor damage from using Beanie's statement to undermine the
ostensible integrity of the investigation is only confirmed bythe prosecutor's admission at one of Kyles's postconviction
hearings, that he did not recall a single instance before thiscase when police had searched and seized garbage on the
street in front of a residence, Tr. of Hearing on Post-Conviction Relief 113 (Feb. 20, 1989), and by Detective John
Miller's admission at the same hearing that he thought atthe time that it "was a possibility" that Beanie had planted
the incriminating evidence in the garbage, Tr. of Hearing onPost-Conviction Relief 51 (Feb. 24, 1989). If a police officer
thought so, a juror would have, too.16To the same effect would have been an enquiry based on
Beanie's apparently revealing remark to police that "if youcan set [Kyles] up good, you can get that same gun."

17 App.

228-229. While the jury might have understood that Beaniemeant simply that if the police investigated Kyles, they

would probably find the murder weapon, the jury could alsohave taken Beanie to have been making the more sinister

16 The dissent, rightly, does not contend that Beanie would have had a
hard time planting the purse in Kyles's garbage. See post, at 471
(arguing that it would have been difficult for Beanie to plant the gun and
homemade holster). All that would have been needed was for Beanie to
put the purse into a trash bag out on the curb. See Tr. 97, 101 (Dec. 6,
1984) (testimony of Detective Dillman; garbage bags were seized from "a
common garbage area" on the street in "the early morning hours when
there wouldn't be anyone on the street").

17 The dissent, post, at 461-462, argues that it would have been stupid

for Beanie to have tantalized the police with the prospect of finding the
gun one day before he may have planted it. It is odd that the dissent
thinks the Brady reassessment requires the assumption that Beanie was
shrewd and sophisticated: the suppressed evidence indicates that within a
period of a few hours after he first called police Beanie gave three different accounts of Kyles's recovery of the purse (and gave yet another about
a month later).

Opinion of the Court
suggestion that the police "set up" Kyles, and the defensecould have argued that the police accepted the invitation.

The prosecutor's notes of his interview with Beanie wouldhave shown that police officers were asking Beanie the
whereabouts of the gun all day Sunday, the very day whenhe was twice at Kyles's apartment and was allegedly seen
by Johnny Burns lurking near the stove, where the gun waslater found.

18 Beanie's same statement, indeed, could have

been used to cap an attack on the integrity of the investiga-tion and on the reliability of Detective Dillman, who testified

on cross-examination that he did not know if Beanie had beenat Kyles's apartment on Sunday. Tr. 93, 101 (Dec. 6, 1984).

19

18 The dissent would rule out any suspicion because Beanie was said to
have worn a "tank-top" shirt during his visits to the apartment, post, at
471; we suppose that a small handgun could have been carried in a man's
trousers, just as a witness for the State claimed the killer had carried it,
Tr. 52 (Dec. 6, 1984) (Williams). Similarly, the record photograph of the
homemade holster indicates that the jury could have found it to be constructed of insubstantial leather or cloth, duct tape, and string, concealable
in a pocket.

19 In evaluating the weight of all these evidentiary items, it bears mention that they would not have functioned as mere isolated bits of good luck
for Kyles. Their combined force in attacking the process by which the
police gathered evidence and assembled the case would have complemented, and have been complemented by, the testimony actually offered
by Kyles's friends and family to show that Beanie had framed Kyles. Exposure to Beanie's own words, even through cross-examination of the police officers, would have made the defense's case more plausible and reduced its vulnerability to credibility attack. Johnny Burns, for example,
was subjected to sharp cross-examination after testifying that he had seen
Beanie change the license plate on the LTD, that he walked in on Beanie
stooping near the stove in Kyles's kitchen, that he had seen Beanie with
handguns of various calibers, including a .32, and that he was testifying
for the defense even though Beanie was his "best friend." Tr. 260, 262-
263, 279, 280 (Dec. 7, 1984). On each of these points, Burns's testimony
would have been consistent with the withheld evidence: that Beanie had
spoken of Burns to the police as his "partner," had admitted to changing
the LTD's license plate, had attended Sunday dinner at Kyles's apartment,
and had a history of violent crime, rendering his use of guns more likely.
With this information, the defense could have challenged the prosecution's

C
Next to be considered is the prosecution's list of the cars
in the Schwegmann's parking lot at mid-evening after themurder. While its suppression does not rank with the failure to disclose the other evidence discussed here, it wouldhave had some value as exculpation and impeachment, and
it counts accordingly in determining whether Bagley's stand-ard of materiality is satisfied. On the police's assumption,
argued to the jury, that the killer drove to the lot and lefthis car there during the heat of the investigation, the list
without Kyles's registration would obviously have helped
Kyles and would have had some value in countering an argument by the prosecution that a grainy enlargement of a photograph of the crime scene showed Kyles's car in the background. The list would also have shown that the police
either knew that it was inconsistent with their informant's
second and third statements (in which Beanie described retrieving Kyles's car after the time the list was compiled) or
never even bothered to check the informant's story against
known fact. Either way, the defense would have had further support for arguing that the police were irresponsible in
relying on Beanie to tip them off to the location of evidence
damaging to Kyles.

The State argues that the list was neither impeachment
nor exculpatory evidence because Kyles could have moved
his car before the list was created and because the list does

good faith on at least some of the points of cross-examination mentioned
and could have elicited police testimony to blunt the effect of the attack
on Burns.

Justice Scalia suggests that we should "gauge" Burns's credibility
by observing that the state judge presiding over Kyles's postconviction
proceeding did not find Burns's testimony in that proceeding to be convincing, and by noting that Burns has since been convicted for killing Beanie.
Post, at 471-472. Of course neither observation could possibly have affected the jury's appraisal of Burns's credibility at the time of Kyles's
trials.

Opinion of the Court
not purport to be a comprehensive listing of all the cars inthe Schwegmann's lot. Such argument, however, confuses

the weight of the evidence with its favorable tendency, andeven if accepted would work against the State, not for it. If
the police had testified that the list was incomplete, theywould simply have underscored the unreliability of the investigation and complemented the defense's attack on the failureto treat Beanie as a suspect and his statements with a presumption of fallibility. But however the evidence wouldhave been used, it would have had some weight and its tendency would have been favorable to Kyles.

D
In assessing the significance of the evidence withheld, onemust of course bear in mind that not every item of the State's

case would have been directly undercut if the Brady evi-dence had been disclosed. It is significant, however, that
the physical evidence remaining unscathed would, by theState's own admission, hardly have amounted to overwhelming proof that Kyles was the murderer. See Tr. of Oral Arg.56 ("The heart of the State's case was eye-witness identification"); see also Tr. of Hearing on Post-Conviction Relief 117(Feb. 20, 1989) (testimony of chief prosecutor Strider) ("The
crux of the case was the four eye-witnesses"). Ammunitionand a holster were found in Kyles's apartment, but if the
jury had suspected the gun had been planted the significanceof these items might have been left in doubt. The fact that
pet food was found in Kyles's apartment was consistent withthe testimony of several defense witnesses that Kyles owned
a dog and that his children fed stray cats. The brands ofpet food found were only two of the brands that Dye typically bought, and these two were common, whereas the onespecialty brand that was found in Dye's apartment after her
murder, Tr. 180 (Dec. 7, 1984), was not found in Kyles's apart-ment,

id., at 188. Although Kyles was wrong in describingthe cat food as being on sale the day he said he bought it, he

was right in describing the way it was priced at Schweg-mann's market, where he commonly shopped.

20

Similarly undispositive is the small Schwegmann's receipton the front passenger floorboard of the LTD, the only physical evidence that bore a fingerprint identified as Kyles's.Kyles explained that Beanie had driven him to Schwegmann's on Friday to buy cigarettes and transmission fluid,and he theorized that the slip must have fallen out of the
bag when he removed the cigarettes. This explanation isconsistent with the location of the slip when found and with
its small size. The State cannot very well argue that thefingerprint ties Kyles to the killing without also explaining
how the 2-inch-long register slip could have been the receiptfor a week's worth of groceries, which Dye had gone to
Schwegmann's to purchase. Id., at 181-182.21

20 Kyles testified that he believed the pet food to have been on sale because "they had a little sign there that said three for such and such, two
for such and such at a cheaper price. It wasn't even over a dollar." Tr.
341 (Dec. 7, 1984). When asked about the sign, Kyles said it "wasn't
big. . . [i]t was a little bitty piece of slip . . . on the shelf." Id., at 342.
Subsequently, the prices were revealed as in fact being "[t]hree for 89
[cents]" and "two for 77 [cents]," id., at 343, which comported exactly with
Kyles's earlier description. The director of advertising at Schwegmann's
testified that the items purchased by Kyles had not been on sale, but also
explained that the multiple pricing was thought to make the products
"more attractive" to the customer. Id., at 396. The advertising director
stated that store policy was to not have signs on the shelves, but he also
admitted that salespeople sometimes disregarded the policy and put signs
up anyway, and that he could not say for sure whether there were signs
up on the day Kyles said he bought the pet food. Id., at 398-399. The
dissent suggests, post, at 473, that Kyles must have been so "very poor"
as to be unable to purchase the pet food. The total cost of the 15 cans of
pet food found in Kyles's apartment would have been $5.67. See Tr. 188,
395 (Dec. 7, 1984). Rather than being "damning," post, at 472, the pet
food evidence was thus equivocal and, in any event, was not the crux of
the prosecution's case, as the State has conceded. See supra, at 451 and
this page.

21 The State's counsel admitted at oral argument that its case depended

on the facially implausible notion that Dye had not made her typical
weekly grocery purchases on the day of the murder (if she had, the receipt

453Cite as: 514 U. S. 419 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
The inconclusiveness of the physical evidence does not, tobe sure, prove Kyles's innocence, and the jury might have

found the eyewitness testimony of Territo and Kersh suffi-cient to convict, even though less damning to Kyles than that
of Smallwood and Williams.22 But the question is notwhether the State would have had a case to go to the jury if
it had disclosed the favorable evidence, but whether we canbe confident that the jury's verdict would have been the
same. Confidence that it would have been cannot survive a
recap of the suppressed evidence and its significance for theprosecution. The jury would have been entitled to find

(a) that the investigation was limited by the police's un-critical readiness to accept the story and suggestions of
an informant whose accounts were inconsistent to thepoint, for example, of including four different versions
of the discovery of the victim's purse, and whose ownbehavior was enough to raise suspicions of guilt;
(b) that the lead police detective who testified waseither less than wholly candid or less than fully
informed;
(c) that the informant's behavior raised suspicions thathe had planted both the murder weapon and the victim's

purse in the places they were found;
(d) that one of the four eyewitnesses crucial to the
State's case had given a description that did not matchthe defendant and better described the informant;

(e) that another eyewitness had been coached, since hehad first stated that he had not seen the killer outside
the getaway car, or the killing itself, whereas at trial he
would have been longer), but that she had indeed made her typical weekly
purchases of pet food (hence the presence of the pet food in Kyles's apartment, which the State claimed were Dye's). Tr. of Oral Arg. 53-54.

22 See supra, at 445. On remand, of course, the State's case will be

weaker still, since the prosecution is unlikely to rely on Kersh, who now
swears that she committed perjury at the two trials when she identified
Kyles as the murderer. See n. 6, supra.

claimed to have seen the shooting, described the murderweapon exactly, and omitted portions of his initial description that would have been troublesome for the case;
(f) that there was no consistency to eyewitness descrip-tions of the killer's height, build, age, facial hair, or

hair length.
Since all of these possible findings were precluded by theprosecution's failure to disclose the evidence that would have

supported them, "fairness" cannot be stretched to the pointof calling this a fair trial. Perhaps, confidence that the verdict would have been the same could survive the evidenceimpeaching even two eyewitnesses if the discoveries of gun
and purse were above suspicion. Perhaps those suspiciouscircumstances would not defeat confidence in the verdict if
the eyewitnesses had generally agreed on a description andwere free of impeachment. But confidence that the verdict
would have been unaffected cannot survive when suppressedevidence would have entitled a jury to find that the eyewitnesses were not consistent in describing the killer, that twoout of the four eyewitnesses testifying were unreliable, that
the most damning physical evidence was subject to suspicion,that the investigation that produced it was insufficiently
probing, and that the principal police witness was insuffi-ciently informed or candid. This is not the "massive" case
envisioned by the dissent, post, at 475; it is a significantlyweaker case than the one heard by the first jury, which could
not even reach a verdict.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and

Scalia notes, see post, at 456-460, precludes us from hearing argument on the merits of even a "substantial percentage" of the capital cases that confront us. Compare
Coleman v. Balkcom, 451 U. S. 949 (1981) (Stevens, J.,
concurring in denial of certiorari), with id., at 956 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). Even aside from its legal importance,
however, this case merits "favored treatment," cf. post, at457, for at least three reasons. First, the fact that the jury

was unable to reach a verdict at the conclusion of the first
trial provides strong reason to believe the significant errors
that occurred at the second trial were prejudicial. Second,
cases in which the record reveals so many instances of the
state's failure to disclose exculpatory evidence are extremely
rare. Even if I shared Justice Scalia's appraisal of the
evidence in this case--which I do not--I would still believe
we should independently review the record to ensure that
the prosecution's blatant and repeated violations of a wellsettled constitutional obligation did not deprive petitioner of
a fair trial. Third, despite my high regard for the diligence
and craftsmanship of the author of the majority opinion in
the Court of Appeals, my independent review of the case left
me with the same degree of doubt about petitioner's guilt
expressed by the dissenting judge in that court.

Our duty to administer justice occasionally requires busy
judges to engage in a detailed review of the particular facts
of a case, even though our labors may not provide posterity
with a newly minted rule of law. The current popularity of
capital punishment makes this "generalizable principle,"
post, at 460, especially important. Cf. Harris v. Alabama,
513 U. S. 504, 519-520, and n. 5 (1995) (Stevens, J., dissenting). I wish such review were unnecessary, but I cannot
agree that our position in the judicial hierarchy makes it inappropriate. Sometimes the performance of an unpleasant

Scalia, J., dissenting
duty conveys a message more significant than even the mostpenetrating legal analysis.

Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

In a sensible system of criminal justice, wrongful conviction is avoided by establishing, at the trial level, lines of
procedural legality that leave ample margins of safety (forexample, the requirement that guilt be proved beyond a

reasonable doubt)--not by providing recurrent and repeti-tive appellate review of whether the facts in the record show
those lines to have been narrowly crossed. The defect ofthe latter system was described, with characteristic candor,
by Justice Jackson:

"Whenever decisions of one court are reviewed by another, a percentage of them are reversed. That reflectsa difference in outlook normally found between personnel comprising different courts. However, reversal bya higher court is not proof that justice is thereby better
done." Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443, 540 (1953) (opinion concurring in result).

Since this Court has long shared Justice Jackson's view,today's opinion--which considers a fact-bound claim of error

rejected by every court, state and federal, that previouslyheard it--is, so far as I can tell, wholly unprecedented. The
Court has adhered to the policy that, when the petitioner
claims only that a concededly correct view of the law wasincorrectly applied to the facts, certiorari should generally

(i. e., except in cases of the plainest error) be denied.
United States v. Johnston, 268 U. S. 220, 227 (1925). That
policy has been observed even when the fact-bound assess-ment of the federal court of appeals has differed from that

of the district court, Sumner v. Mata, 449 U. S. 539, 543
(1981); and under what we have called the "two-court rule,"
the policy has been applied with particular rigor when dis514us2$48k 05-27-98 17:22:46 PAGES OPINPGT

Scalia, J., dissenting
trict court and court of appeals are in agreement as to whatconclusion the record requires. See,

e. g., Graver Tank &
Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Products Co., 336 U. S. 271, 275 (1949).How much the more should the policy be honored in this

case, a federal habeas proceeding where not only both lower
federal courts but also the state courts on postconvictionreview have all reviewed and rejected precisely the factspecific claim before us. Cf. 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d) (requiringfederal habeas courts to accord a presumption of correctness
to state-court findings of fact); Sumner, supra, at 550, n. 3.Instead, however, the Court not only grants certiorari to
consider whether the Court of Appeals (and all the previous
courts that agreed with it) was correct as to what the facts
showed in a case where the answer is far from clear, but in
the process of such consideration renders new findings of fact
and judgments of credibility appropriate to a trial court of
original jurisdiction. See, e. g., ante, at 425 ("Beanie seemed
eager to cast suspicion on Kyles"); ante, at 441, n. 12 ("Record photographs of Beanie . . . depict a man possessing a
medium build"); ante, at 449, n. 18 ("the record photograph
of the homemade holster indicates . . .").

The Court says that we granted certiorari "[b]ecause `[o]ur
duty to search for constitutional error with painstaking care
is never more exacting than it is in a capital case,' Burger v.
Kemp, 483 U. S. 776, 785 (1987)." Ante, at 422. The citation is perverse, for the reader who looks up the quoted opinion will discover that the very next sentence confirms the
traditional practice from which the Court today glaringly departs: "Nevertheless, when the lower courts have found that
[no constitutional error occurred], . . . deference to the shared
conclusion of two reviewing courts prevent[s] us from substituting speculation for their considered opinions." Burger v.
Kemp, 483 U. S. 776, 785 (1987).

The greatest puzzle of today's decision is what could have
caused this capital case to be singled out for favored treatment. Perhaps it has been randomly selected as a symbol,

514us2$48k 05-27-98 17:22:46 PAGES OPINPGT
458 KYLES v. WHITLEY

Scalia, J., dissenting
to reassure America that the United States Supreme Courtis reviewing capital convictions to make sure no factual error

has been made. If so, it is a false symbol, for we assuredlydo not do that. At, and during the week preceding, our February 24 Conference, for example, we considered and disposed of 10 petitions in capital cases, from seven States. Wecarefully considered whether the convictions and sentences

in those cases had been obtained in reliance upon correctprinciples of federal law; but if we had tried to consider, in
addition, whether those correct principles had been applied,not merely plausibly, but

accurately, to the particular facts
of each case, we would have done nothing else for the week.
The reality is that responsibility for factual accuracy, in capital cases as in other cases, rests elsewhere--with trial judges
and juries, state appellate courts, and the lower federal
courts; we do nothing but encourage foolish reliance to pretend otherwise.

Straining to suggest a legal error in the decision below
that might warrant review, the Court asserts that "[t]here is
room to debate whether the two judges in the majority in
the Court of Appeals made an assessment of the cumulative
effect of the evidence," ante, at 440. In support of this it
quotes isolated sentences of the opinion below that supposedly "dismiss[ed] particular items of evidence as immaterial,"
ibid. This claim of legal error does not withstand minimal
scrutiny. The Court of Appeals employed precisely the
same legal standard that the Court does. Compare 5 F. 3d
806, 811 (CA5 1993) ("We apply the [United States v.] Bagley[, 473 U. S. 667 (1985),] standard here by examining
whether it is reasonably probable that, had the undisclosed
information been available to Kyles, the result would have
been different"), with ante, at 441 ("In this case, disclosure
of the suppressed evidence to competent counsel would have
made a different result reasonably probable"). Nor did the
Court of Appeals announce a rule of law, that might have
precedential force in later cases, to the effect that Bagley

459Cite as: 514 U. S. 419 (1995)
Scalia, J., dissenting
requires a series of independent materiality evaluations; infact, the court said just the contrary. See 5 F. 3d, at 817

("[W]e are not persuaded that it is reasonably probable thatthe jury would have found in Kyles' favor if exposed to any
or all of the undisclosed materials") (emphasis added). If
the decision is read, shall we say, cumulatively, it is clearbeyond cavil that the court assessed the cumulative effect of

the Brady evidence in the context of the whole record. See5 F. 3d, at 807 (basing its rejection of petitioner's claim on
"a complete reading of the record"); id., at 811 ("Rather thanreviewing the alleged

Brady materials in the abstract, we
will examine the evidence presented at trial and how the
extra materials would have fit"); id., at 813 ("We must bear
[the eyewitness testimony] in mind while assessing the probable effect of other undisclosed information"). It is, in other
words, the Court itself which errs in the manner that it accuses the Court of Appeals of erring: failing to consider the
material under review as a whole. The isolated snippets it
quotes from the decision merely do what the Court's own
opinion acknowledges must be done: to "evaluate the tendency and force of the undisclosed evidence item by item;
there is no other way." Ante, at 436, n. 10. Finally, the
Court falls back on this: "The result reached by the Fifth
Circuit majority is compatible with a series of independent
materiality evaluations, rather than the cumulative evaluation required by Bagley," ante, at 441. In other words, even
though the Fifth Circuit plainly enunciated the correct legal
rule, since the outcome it reached would not properly follow
from that rule, the Fifth Circuit must in fact (and unbeknownst to itself) have been applying an incorrect legal rule.
This effectively eliminates all distinction between mistake in
law and mistake in application.

What the Court granted certiorari to review, then, is not
a decision on an issue of federal law that conflicts with a
decision of another federal or state court; nor even a decision
announcing a rule of federal law that because of its novelty

514us2$48k 05-27-98 17:22:46 PAGES OPINPGT

Scalia, J., dissenting
or importance might warrant review despite the lack of aconflict; nor yet even a decision that patently errs in its application of an old rule. What we have here is an intenselyfact-specific case in which the court below unquestionably
applied the correct rule of law and did not unquestionablyerr--precisely the type of case in which we are

most inclinedto deny certiorari. But despite all of that, I would not have

dissented on the ground that the writ of certiorari should bedismissed as improvidently granted. Since the majority is
as aware of the limits of our capacity as I am, there is littlefear that the grant of certiorari in a case of this sort will
often be repeated--which is to say little fear that today'sgrant has any generalizable principle behind it. I am still
forced to dissent, however, because, having improvidentlydecided to review the facts of this case, the Court goes on
to get the facts wrong. Its findings are in my view clearlyerroneous, cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a), and the Court's verdict would be reversed if there were somewhere further toappeal.

I
Before proceeding to detailed consideration of the evi-dence, a few general observations about the Court's methodology are appropriate. It is fundamental to the discoveryrule of

Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), that the mate-riality of a failure to disclose favorable evidence "must be

evaluated in the context of the entire record." UnitedStates v. Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 112 (1976). It is simply not
enough to show that the undisclosed evidence would haveallowed the defense to weaken, or even to "destro[y]," ante,
at 441, the particular prosecution witnesses or items ofprosecution evidence to which the undisclosed evidence relates. It is petitioner's burden to show that in light of allthe evidence, including that untainted by the

Brady viola-tion, it is reasonably probable that a jury would have entertained a reasonable doubt regarding petitioner's guilt. SeeUnited States v. Bagley, 473 U. S. 667, 682 (1985); Agurs,

supra, at 112-113. The Court's opinion fails almost entirelyto take this principle into account. Having spent many

pages assessing the effect of the Brady material on twoprosecution witnesses and a few items of prosecution evidence, ante, at 441-451, it dismisses the remainder of theevidence against Kyles in a quick page-and-a-half,

ante, at451-453. This partiality is confirmed in the Court's attempt

to "recap . . . the suppressed evidence and its significance forthe prosecution," ante, at 453 (emphasis added), which omits
the required comparison between that evidence and the evi-dence that was disclosed. My discussion of the record will
present the half of the analysis that the Court omits, empha-sizing the evidence concededly unaffected by the

Brady vio-lation which demonstrates the immateriality of the violation.

In any analysis of this case, the desperate implausibility ofthe theory that petitioner put before the jury must be kept
firmly in mind. The first half of that theory--designed toneutralize the physical evidence (Mrs. Dye's purse in his garbage, the murder weapon behind his stove)--was that peti-tioner was the victim of a "frame-up" by the police informer
and evil genius, Beanie. Now it is not unusual for a guiltyperson who knows that he is suspected of a crime to try to
shift blame to someone else; and it is less common, but notunheard of, for a guilty person who is neither suspected nor
subject to suspicion (because he has established a perfectalibi), to call attention to himself by coming forward to point
the finger at an innocent person. But petitioner's theory isthat the guilty Beanie, who could plausibly be accused of the
crime (as petitioner's brief amply demonstrates), but whowas not a suspect any more than Kyles was (the police as
yet had no leads, see ante, at 424), injected both Kyles andhimself into the investigation in order to get the innocent
Kyles convicted.1 If this were not stupid enough, the

1 The Court tries to explain all this by saying that Beanie mistakenly
thought that he had become a suspect. The only support it provides for
this is the fact that, after having come forward with the admission that

514us2$48k 05-27-98 17:22:46 PAGES OPINPGT
462 KYLES v. WHITLEY

Scalia, J., dissenting
wicked Beanie is supposed to have suggested that the police
search his victim's premises a full day before he got around
to planting the incriminating evidence on the premises.

The second half of petitioner's theory was that he was the
victim of a quadruple coincidence, in which four eyewitnesses to the crime mistakenly identified him as the murderer--three picking him out of a photo array without hesitation, and all four affirming their identification in open court
after comparing him with Beanie. The extraordinary mistake petitioner had to persuade the jury these four witnesses
made was not simply to mistake the real killer, Beanie, for
the very same innocent third party (hard enough to believe),
but in addition to mistake him for the very man Beanie had
chosen to frame--the last and most incredible level of coincidence. However small the chance that the jury would believe any one of those improbable scenarios, the likelihood
that it would believe them all together is far smaller. The
Court concludes that it is "reasonably probable" the undisclosed witness interviews would have persuaded the jury of
petitioner's implausible theory of mistaken eyewitness testimony, and then argues that it is "reasonably probable" the
undisclosed information regarding Beanie would have persuaded the jury of petitioner's implausible theory regarding
the incriminating physical evidence. I think neither of
those conclusions is remotely true, but even if they were the
Court would still be guilty of a fallacy in declaring victory
on each implausibility in turn, and thus victory on the whole,

he had driven the dead woman's car, Beanie repeatedly inquired whether
he himself was a suspect. See ante, at 442, n. 13. Of course at that point
he well should have been worried about being a suspect. But there is
no evidence that he erroneously considered himself a suspect beforehand.
Moreover, even if he did, the notion that a guilty person would, on the
basis of such an erroneous belief, come forward for the reward or in order
to "frame" Kyles (rather than waiting for the police to approach him first)
is quite simply implausible.

Scalia, J., dissenting
without considering the infinitesimal probability of the jury's
swallowing the entire concoction of implausibility squared.

This basic error of approaching the evidence piecemeal is
also what accounts for the Court's obsessive focus on the
credibility or culpability of Beanie, who did not even testify
at trial and whose credibility or innocence the State has
never once avowed. The Court's opinion reads as if either
petitioner or Beanie must be telling the truth, and any evidence tending to inculpate or undermine the credibility of
the one would exculpate or enhance the credibility of the
other. But the jury verdict in this case said only that petitioner was guilty of the murder. That is perfectly consistent with the possibilities that Beanie repeatedly lied, ante,
at 445, that he was an accessory after the fact, cf. ante, at
445-446, or even that he planted evidence against petitioner,
ante, at 448. Even if the undisclosed evidence would have
allowed the defense to thoroughly impeach Beanie and to
suggest the above possibilities, the jury could well have believed all of those things and yet have condemned petitioner
because it could not believe that all four of the eyewitnesses
were similarly mistaken.2

Of course even that much rests on the premise that competent counsel would run the terrible risk of calling Beanie, a
witness whose "testimony almost certainly would have inculpated [petitioner]" and whom "any reasonable attorney
would perceive . . . as a `loose cannon.' " 5 F. 3d, at 818.
Perhaps because that premise seems so implausible, the
Court retreats to the possibility that petitioner's counsel,

2 There is no basis in anything I have said for the Court's charge that
"the dissent appears to assume that Kyles must lose because there would
still have been adequate [i. e., sufficient] evidence to convict even if the
favorable evidence had been disclosed." Ante, at 435, n. 8. I do assume,
indeed I expressly argue, that petitioner must lose because there was,
is, and will be overwhelming evidence to convict, so much evidence that
disclosure would not "have made a different result reasonably probable."
Ante, at 441.

464 KYLES v. WHITLEY

Scalia, J., dissenting
even if not calling Beanie to the stand, could have used theevidence relating to Beanie to attack "the reliability of the

investigation." Ante, at 446. But that is distinctly less ef-fective than substantive evidence bearing on the guilt or innocence of the accused. In evaluating Brady claims, we as-sume jury conduct that is both rational and obedient to the
law. We do not assume that even though the whole mass ofthe evidence, both disclosed and undisclosed, shows petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury will punishsloppy investigative techniques by setting the defendant
free. Neither Beanie nor the police were on trial in thiscase. Petitioner was, and no amount of collateral evidence
could have enabled his counsel to move the mountain ofdirect evidence against him.

II
The undisclosed evidence does not create a " `reasonableprobability' of a different result." Ante, at 434 (quoting

United States v. Bagley, 473 U. S., at 682). To begin withthe eyewitness testimony: Petitioner's basic theory at trial
was that the State's four eyewitnesses happened to mistakeBeanie, the real killer, for petitioner, the man whom Beanie
was simultaneously trying to frame. Police officers testifiedto the jury, and petitioner has never disputed, that three of
the four eyewitnesses (Territo, Smallwood, and Williams)were shown a photo lineup of six young men four days after
the shooting and, without aid or duress, identified petitioneras the murderer; and that all of them, plus the fourth eyewitness, Kersh, reaffirmed their identifications at trial afterpetitioner and Beanie were made to stand side by side.

Territo, the first eyewitness called by the State, was wait-ing at a red light in a truck 30 or 40 yards from the Schwegmann's parking lot. He saw petitioner shoot Mrs. Dye, starther car, drive out onto the road, and pull up just behind Territo's truck. When the light turned green petitioner pulled

beside Territo and stopped while waiting to make a turn.
Petitioner looked Territo full in the face. Territo testified,
"I got a good look at him. If I had been in the passenger
seat of the little truck, I could have reached out and not even
stretched my arm out, I could have grabbed hold of him."
Tr. 13-14 (Dec. 6, 1984). Territo also testified that a detective had shown him a picture of Beanie and asked him if the
picture "could have been the guy that did it. I told him
no." Id., at 24. The second eyewitness, Kersh, also saw
petitioner shoot Mrs. Dye. When asked whether she got "a
good look" at him as he drove away, she answered "yes."
Id., at 32. She also answered "yes" to the question whether
she "got to see the side of his face," id., at 31, and said that
while petitioner was stopped she had driven to within reaching distance of the driver's-side door of Mrs. Dye's car and
stopped there. Id., at 34. The third eyewitness, Smallwood, testified that he saw petitioner shoot Mrs. Dye, walk
to the car, and drive away. Id., at 42. Petitioner drove
slowly by, within a distance of 15 or 25 feet, id., at 43-45,
and Smallwood saw his face from the side. Id., at 43. The
fourth eyewitness, Williams, who had been working outside
the parking lot, testified that "the gentleman came up the
side of the car," struggled with Mrs. Dye, shot her, walked
around to the driver's side of the car, and drove away. Id.,
at 52. Williams not only "saw him before he shot her," id.,
at 54, but watched petitioner drive slowly by "within less
than ten feet." Ibid. When asked "[d]id you get an opportunity to look at him good?", Williams said, "I did."
Id., at 55.

The Court attempts to dispose of this direct, unqualified,
and consistent eyewitness testimony in two ways. First, by
relying on a theory so implausible that it was apparently not
suggested by petitioner's counsel until the oral-argumentcum-evidentiary-hearing held before us, perhaps because it
is a theory that only the most removed appellate court could

Scalia, J., dissenting
love. This theory is that there is a reasonable probabilitythat the jury would have changed its mind about the eyewitness identification because the Brady material would havepermitted the defense to argue that the eyewitnesses only
got a good look at the killer when he was sitting in Mrs.Dye's car, and thus could identify him, not by his height and
build, but only by his face. Never mind, for the moment,that this is factually false, since the

Brady material showedthat only one of the four eyewitnesses, Smallwood, did not

see the killer outside the car.3 And never mind, also, thedubious premise that the build of a man 6-feet tall (like petitioner) is indistinguishable, when seated behind the wheel,from that of a man less than 5

1/2-feet tall (like Beanie). To

assert that unhesitant and categorical identification by fourwitnesses who viewed the killer, close-up and with the sun

high in the sky, would not eliminate reasonable doubt if it
were based only on facial characteristics, and not on heightand build, is quite simply absurd. Facial features are

the
primary means by which human beings recognize one an-other. That is why police departments distribute "mug "

shots of wanted felons, rather than Ivy-League-type posturepictures; it is why bank robbers wear stockings over their
faces instead of floor-length capes over their shoulders; it iswhy the Lone Ranger wears a mask instead of a poncho; and
it is why a criminal defense lawyer who seeks to destroy an

3 Smallwood and Williams were the only eyewitnesses whose testimony
was affected by the Brady material, and Williams's was affected not because it showed he did not observe the killer standing up, but to the contrary because it showed that his estimates of height and weight based on
that observation did not match Kyles. The other two witnesses did observe the killer in full. Territo testified that he saw the killer running
up to Mrs. Dye before the struggle began, and that after the struggle he
watched the killer bend down, stand back up, and then "stru[t]" over to
the car. Tr. 12 (Dec. 6, 1984). Kersh too had a clear opportunity to observe the killer's body type; she testified that she saw the killer and Mrs.
Dye arguing, and that she watched him walk around the back of the car
after Mrs. Dye had fallen. Id., at 29-30.

identifying witness by asking "You admit that you saw onlythe killer's face?" will be laughed out of the courtroom.

It would be different, of course, if there were evidence thatKyles's and Beanie's faces looked like twins, or at least bore
an unusual degree of resemblance. That facial resemblance
would explain why, if Beanie committed the crime, all fourwitnesses picked out Kyles at first (though not why they continued to pick him out when he and Beanie stood side-by-sidein court), and would render their failure to observe the
height and build of the killer relevant. But without evi-dence of facial similarity, the question "You admit that you
saw only the killer's face?" draws no blood; it does not explain any witness's identification of petitioner as the killer.
While the assumption of facial resemblance between Kyles
and Beanie underlies all of the Court's repeated references
to the partial concealment of the killer's body from view, see,
e. g., ante, at 442-443, 443-444, n. 14, 445, the Court never
actually says that such resemblance exists. That is because
there is not the slightest basis for such a statement in the
record. No court has found that Kyles and Beanie bear any
facial resemblance. In fact, quite the opposite: every federal
and state court that has reviewed the record photographs,
or seen the two men, has found that they do not resemble
each other in any respect. See 5 F. 3d, at 813 ("Comparing
photographs of Kyles and Beanie, it is evident that the former is taller, thinner, and has a narrower face"); App. 181
(District Court opinion) ("The court examined all of the pictures used in the photographic line-up and compared Kyles'
and Beanie's pictures; it finds that they did not resemble one
another"); id., at 36 (state trial court findings on postconviction review) ("[Beanie] clearly and distinctly did not resemble the defendant in this case") (emphasis in original). The
District Court's finding controls because it is not clearly erroneous, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a), and the state court's
finding, because fairly supported by the record, must be presumed correct on habeas review. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d).

Scalia, J., dissenting
The Court's second means of seeking to neutralize the im-pressive and unanimous eyewitness testimony uses the same

"build-is-everything" theory to exaggerate the effect of theState's failure to disclose the contemporaneous statement of
Henry Williams. That statement would assuredly have permitted a sharp cross-examination, since it contained estima-tions of height and weight that fit Beanie better than petitioner. Ante, at 441-442. But I think it is hyperbole to saythat the statement would have "substantially reduced or
destroyed" the value of Williams' testimony. Ante, at 441.Williams saw the murderer drive slowly by less than 10 feet
away, Tr. 54 (Dec. 6, 1984), and unhesitatingly picked him
out of the photo lineup. The jury might well choose to give
greater credence to the simple fact of identification than to
the difficult estimation of height and weight.

The Court spends considerable time, see ante, at 443,
showing how Smallwood's testimony could have been discredited to such a degree as to "rais[e] a substantial implication that the prosecutor had coached him to give it." Ibid.
Perhaps so, but that is all irrelevant to this appeal, since all
of that impeaching material (except the "facial identification"
point I have discussed above) was available to the defense
independently of the Brady material. See ante, at 443-444,
n. 14. In sum, the undisclosed statements, credited with everything they could possibly have provided to the defense,
leave two prosecution witnesses (Territo and Kersh) totally
untouched; one prosecution witness (Smallwood) barely affected (he saw "only" the killer's face); and one prosecution
witness (Williams) somewhat impaired (his description of the
killer's height and weight did not match Kyles). We must
keep all this in due perspective, remembering that the relevant question in the materiality inquiry is not how many
points the defense could have scored off the prosecution witnesses, but whether it is reasonably probable that the new
evidence would have caused the jury to accept the basic thesis that all four witnesses were mistaken. I think it plainly

is not. No witness involved in the case ever identified anyone but petitioner as the murderer. Their views of the
crime and the escaping criminal were obtained in bright daylight from close at hand; and their identifications were reaffirmed before the jury. After the side-by-side comparison
between Beanie and Kyles, the jury heard Territo say that
there was "[n]o doubt in my mind" that petitioner was the
murderer, Tr. 378 (Dec. 7, 1984); heard Kersh say "I know it
was him. . . . I seen his face and I know the color of his skin.
I know it. I know it's him," id., at 383; heard Smallwood
say "I'm positive . . . [b]ecause that's the man who I seen kill
that woman," id., at 387; and heard Williams say "[n]o doubt
in my mind," id., at 391. With or without the Brady evidence, there could be no doubt in the mind of the jury either.

There remains the argument that is the major contribution
of today's opinion to Brady litigation; with our endorsement,
it will surely be trolled past appellate courts in all future
failure-to-disclose cases. The Court argues that "the effective impeachment of one eyewitness can call for a new trial
even though the attack does not extend directly to others, as
we have said before." Ante, at 445 (citing Agurs v. United
States, 427 U. S., at 112-113, n. 21). It would be startling if
we had "said [this] before," since it assumes irrational jury
conduct. The weakening of one witness's testimony does
not weaken the unconnected testimony of another witness;
and to entertain the possibility that the jury will give it such
an effect is incompatible with the whole idea of a materiality
standard, which presumes that the incriminating evidence
that would have been destroyed by proper disclosure can be
logically separated from the incriminating evidence that
would have remained unaffected. In fact we have said nothing like what the Court suggests. The opinion's only authority for its theory, the cited footnote from Agurs, was
appended to the proposition that "[a Brady] omission must
be evaluated in the context of the entire record," 427 U. S.,

at 112. In accordance with that proposition, the footnoterecited a hypothetical that shows how a witness's testimony

could have been destroyed by withheld evidence that contra-dicts the witness.

4 That is worlds apart from having it

destroyed by the corrosive effect of withheld evidence thatimpeaches (or, as here, merely weakens)

some other corrobo-rating witness.

The physical evidence confirms the immateriality of thenondisclosures. In a garbage bag outside petitioner's home
the police found Mrs. Dye's purse and other belongings. In-side his home they found, behind the kitchen stove, the .32-
caliber revolver used to kill Mrs. Dye; hanging in a ward-robe, a homemade shoulder holster that was "a perfect fit"
for the revolver, Tr. 74 (Dec. 6, 1984) (Detective Dillman);in a dresser drawer in the bedroom, two boxes of gun
cartridges, one containing only .32-caliber rounds of the samebrand found in the murder weapon, another containing .22,
.32, and .38-caliber rounds; in a kitchen cabinet, eight emptySchwegmann's bags; and in a cupboard underneath that cabinet, one Schwegmann's bag containing 15 cans of pet food.Petitioner's account at trial was that Beanie planted the
purse, gun, and holster, that petitioner received the ammuni-tion from Beanie as collateral for a loan, and that petitioner
had bought the pet food the day of the murder. That ac-count strains credulity to the breaking point.

4 " `If, for example, one of only two eyewitnesses to a crime had told the
prosecutor that the defendant was definitely not its perpetrator and if this
statement was not disclosed to the defense, no court would hesitate to
reverse a conviction resting on the testimony of the other eyewitness.
But if there were fifty eyewitnesses, forty-nine of whom identified the
defendant, and the prosecutor neglected to reveal that the other, who was
without his badly needed glasses on the misty evening of the crime, had
said that the criminal looked something like the defendant but he could not
be sure as he had only a brief glimpse, the result might well be different.' "

The Court is correct that the Brady material would havesupported the claim that Beanie planted Mrs. Dye's belongings in petitioner's garbage and (to a lesser degree) thatBeanie planted the gun behind petitioner's stove. Ante, at
448. But we must see the whole story that petitioner pre-sented to the jury. Petitioner would have it that Beanie did
not plant the incriminating evidence until the day after heincited the police to search petitioner's home. Moreover, he
succeeded in surreptitiously placing the gun behind thestove, and the matching shoulder holster in the wardrobe,
while at least 10 and as many as 19 people were present inpetitioner's small apartment.

5 Beanie, who was wearing

blue jeans and either a "tank-top" shirt, Tr. 302 (Dec. 7, 1984)(Cathora Brown), or a short-sleeved shirt,

id., at 351 (peti-tioner), would have had to be concealing about his person

not only the shoulder holster and the murder weapon, butalso a different gun with tape wrapped around the barrel
that he showed to petitioner. Id., at 352. Only appellatejudges could swallow such a tale. Petitioner's only supporting evidence was Johnny Burns's testimony that he sawBeanie stooping behind the stove, presumably to plant the
gun. Id., at 262-263. Burns's credibility on the stand canperhaps best be gauged by observing that the state judge
who presided over petitioner's trial stated, in a postconvic-tion proceeding, that "[I] ha[ve] chosen to totally disregard
everything that [Burns] has said," App. 35. See also id., at165 (District Court opinion) ("Having reviewed the entire
record, this court without hesitation concurs with the trialcourt's determination concerning the credibility of [Burns]").
Burns, by the way, who repeatedly stated at trial that Beaniewas his "best friend," Tr. 279 (Dec. 7, 1984), has since been

Petitioner did not claim that the ammunition had beenplanted. The police found a .22-caliber rifle under petitioner's mattress and two boxes of ammunition, one contain-ing .22, .32, and .38-caliber rounds, another containing only
.32-caliber rounds of the same brand as those found loadedin the murder weapon. Petitioner's story was that Beanie

gave him the rifle and the .32-caliber shells as security for aloan, but that he had taken the .22-caliber shells out of the
box. Tr. 353, 355 (Dec. 7, 1984). Put aside that the latterdetail was contradicted by the facts; but consider the inherent implausibility of Beanie's giving petitioner collateral inthe form of a box containing only .32 shells, if it were true
that petitioner did not own a .32-caliber gun. As the FifthCircuit wrote, "[t]he more likely inference, apparently chosen
by the jury, is that [petitioner] possessed .32-caliber ammu-nition because he possessed a .32-caliber firearm." 5 F. 3d,
at 817.We come to the evidence of the pet food, so mundane and
yet so very damning. Petitioner's confused and changingexplanations for the presence of 15 cans of pet food in a

the jury's appraisal of Burns's credibility at the time of Kyles's trials."
Ante, at 450, n. 19. That is obviously true. But it is just as obviously
true that because we have no findings about Burns's credibility from the
jury and no direct method of asking what they thought, the only way that
we can assess the jury's appraisal of Burns's credibility is by asking (1)
whether the state trial judge, who saw Burns's testimony along with the
jury, thought it was credible; and (2) whether Burns was in fact credible--
a question on which his later behavior towards his "best friend" is highly
probative.

fense in this case"). The Court disposes of the pet food evi-dence as follows:

"The fact that pet food was found in Kyles's apartmentwas consistent with the testimony of several defense
witnesses that Kyles owned a dog and that his childrenfed stray cats. The brands of pet food found were only
two of the brands that Dye typically bought, and thesetwo were common, whereas the one specialty brand that
was found in Dye's apartment after her murder, Tr. 180(Dec. 7, 1984), was not found in Kyles's apartment,

id.,
at 188. Although Kyles was wrong in describing the
cat food as being on sale the day he said he boughtit, he was right in describing the way it was priced at

Schwegmann's market, where he commonly shopped."
Ante, at 451-452; see also ante, at 452, n. 20.

The full story is this. Mr. and Mrs. Dye owned two catsand a dog, Tr. 178 (Dec. 7, 1984), for which she regularly

bought varying brands of pet food, several different brandsat a time.

Id., at 179, 180. Found in Mrs. Dye's home after
her murder were the brands Nine Lives, Kalkan, and Pussn' Boots.

Id., at 180. Found in petitioner's home were
eight cans of Nine Lives, four cans of Kalkan, and three cansof Cozy Kitten.

Id., at 188. Since we know that Mrs. Dye
had been shopping that day and that the murderer made off
with her goods, petitioner's possession of these items waspowerful evidence that he was the murderer. Assuredly the

jury drew that obvious inference. Pressed to explain whyhe just happened to buy

15 cans of pet food that very day
(keep in mind that petitioner was a very poor man, see id.,
at 329, who supported a common-law wife, a mistress, and
four children), petitioner gave the reason that "it was on
sale." Id., at 341. The State, however, introduced testimony from the Schwegmann's advertising director that the
pet food was not on sale that day. Id., at 395. The dissenting judge below tried to rehabilitate petitioner's testimony

514us2$48k 05-27-98 17:22:47 PAGES OPINPGT
474 KYLES v. WHITLEY

Scalia, J., dissenting
by interpreting the "on sale" claim as meaning "for sale," areference to the pricing of the pet food (e. g., "3 for 89 cents"),

which petitioner claimed to have read on a shelf sign in thestore. Id., at 343. But unless petitioner was parodying
George Leigh Mallory, "because it was for sale" would havebeen an irrational response to the question it was given in
answer to: Why did you buy so many cans? In any event,the Schwegmann's employee also testified that store policy
was not to put signs on the shelves at all. Id., at 398-399.The sum of it is that petitioner, far from explaining the presence of the pet food, doubled the force of the State's evidenceby perjuring himself before the jury, as the state trial judge
observed. See supra, at 472-473.7I will not address the list of cars in the Schwegmann's
parking lot and the receipt, found in the victim's car, thatbore petitioner's fingerprints. These were collateral matters that provided little evidence of either guilt or innocence.The list of cars, which did not contain petitioner's automobile, would only have served to rebut the State's introductionof a photograph purporting to show petitioner's car in the
parking lot; but petitioner does not contest that the list wasnot comprehensive, and that the photograph was taken about
six hours before the list was compiled. See 5 F. 3d, at 816.

7 I have charitably assumed that petitioner had a pet or pets in the
first place, although the evidence tended to show the contrary. Petitioner
claimed that he owned a dog or puppy, that his son had a cat, and that
there were "seven or eight more cats around there." Tr. 325 (Dec. 7,
1984). The dog, according to petitioner, had been kept "in the country"
for a month and half, and was brought back just the week before petitioner
was arrested. Id., at 337-338. Although petitioner claimed to have kept
the dog tied up in a yard behind his house before it was taken to the
country, id., at 336-337, two defense witnesses contradicted this story.
Donald Powell stated that he had not seen a dog at petitioner's home since
at least six months before the trial, id., at 254, while Cathora Brown said
that although Pinky, petitioner's wife, sometimes fed stray pets, she had
no dog tied up in the back yard. Id., at 304-305. The police found no
evidence of any kind that any pets lived in petitioner's home at or near
the time of the murder. Id., at 75 (Dec. 6, 1984).

Thus its rebuttal value would have been marginal at best.The receipt--although it showed that petitioner must at

some point have been both in Schwegmann's and in the mur-dered woman's car--was as consistent with petitioner's story
as with the State's. See ante, at 452.

* * *
The State presented to the jury a massive core of evidence(including four eyewitnesses) showing that petitioner was

guilty of murder, and that he lied about his guilt. The effectthat the Brady materials would have had in chipping away
at the edges of the State's case can only be called immaterial.For the same reasons I reject petitioner's claim that the
Brady materials would have created a "residual doubt" suf-ficient to cause the sentencing jury to withhold capital
punishment.I respectfully dissent.

RUBIN, SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY v.COORS BREWING CO.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 93-1631. Argued November 30, 1994--Decided April 19, 1995
Because $ 5(e)(2) of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAAA or

Act), 27 U. S. C. $ 205(e)(2), prohibits beer labels from displaying alcohol
content, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF)
rejected respondent brewer's application for approval of proposed labels
that disclosed such content. Respondent filed suit for relief on the
ground that the relevant provisions of the Act violated the First Amendment's protection of commercial speech. The Government argued that
the labeling ban was necessary to suppress the threat of "strength wars"
among brewers, who, without the regulation, would seek to compete in
the marketplace based on the potency of their beer. The District Court
invalidated the labeling ban, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Although the latter court found that the Government's interest in suppressing "strength wars" was "substantial" under the test set out in
Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447
U. S. 557, the court held that the ban violates the First Amendment
because it fails to advance that interest in a direct and material way.

Held: Section 5(e)(2) violates the First Amendment's protection of commercial speech. Pp. 480-491.

(a) In scrutinizing a regulation of commercial speech that concerns
lawful activity and is not misleading, a court must consider whether
the governmental interest asserted to support the regulation is "substantial." If that is the case, the court must also determine whether
the regulation directly advances the asserted interest and is no more
extensive than is necessary to serve that interest. Central Hudson,
supra, at 566. Here, respondent seeks to disclose only truthful, verifiable, and nonmisleading factual information concerning alcohol content.
Pp. 480-482.

(b) The interest in curbing "strength wars" is sufficiently "substantial" to satisfy Central Hudson. The Government has a significant interest in protecting the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens by
preventing brewers from competing on the basis of alcohol strength,
which could lead to greater alcoholism and its attendant social costs.
Cf. Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of P. R., 478 U. S.
328, 341. There is no reason to think that strength wars, if they were

Syllabus
to occur, would not produce the type of social harm that the Government hopes to prevent. However, the additional asserted interest in
"facilitat[ing]" state efforts to regulate alcohol under the Twenty-first
Amendment is not sufficiently substantial to meet Central Hudson's
requirement. Even if the Government possessed the authority to
facilitate state powers, the Government has offered nothing to suggest
that States are in need of federal assistance in this regard. United
States v. Edge Broadcasting Co., 509 U. S. 418, 431-435, distinguished.
Pp. 483-486.

(c) Section 205(e)(2) fails Central Hudson's requirement that the
measure directly advance the asserted Government interest. The labeling ban cannot be said to advance the governmental interest in suppressing strength wars because other provisions of the FAAA and
implementing regulations prevent $ 205(e)(2) from furthering that interest in a direct and material fashion. Although beer advertising would
seem to constitute a more influential weapon in any strength war than
labels, the BATF regulations governing such advertising prohibit statements of alcohol content only in States that affirmatively ban such advertisements. Government regulations also permit the identification of
certain beers with high alcohol content as "malt liquors," and they require disclosure of content on the labels of wines and spirits. There is
little chance that $ 205(e)(2) can directly and materially advance its aim,
while other provisions of the same Act directly undermine and counteract its effects. Pp. 486-490.

(d) Section 205(e)(2) is more extensive than necessary, since available
alternatives to the labeling ban--including directly limiting the alcohol
content of beers, prohibiting marketing efforts emphasizing high alcohol
strength, and limiting the ban to malt liquors, the segment of the beer
market that allegedly is threatened with a strength war--would prove
less intrusive to the First Amendment's protections for commercial
speech. Pp. 490-491.

Opinion of the Court
Court for the District of Colorado seeking a declaratoryjudgment that the relevant provisions of the Act violated the

First Amendment; respondent also sought injunctive reliefbarring enforcement of these provisions. The Government
took the position that the ban was necessary to suppress the
threat of "strength wars" among brewers, who, without theregulation, would seek to compete in the marketplace based

on the potency of their beer.The District Court granted the relief sought, but a panel
of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed andremanded.

Adolph Coors Co. v. Brady, 944 F. 2d 1543
(1991). Applying the framework set out in Central Hudson
Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S.
557 (1980), the Court of Appeals found that the Government's
interest in suppressing alcoholic "strength wars" was "substantial." Brady, supra, at 1547-1549. It further held,
however, that the record provided insufficient evidence to
determine whether the FAAA's ban on disclosure "directly
advanced" that interest. Id., at 1549-1551. The court
remanded for further proceedings to ascertain whether a
" `reasonable fit' " existed between the ban and the goal of
avoiding strength wars. Id., at 1554.

After further factfinding, the District Court upheld the
ban on the disclosure of alcohol content in advertising but
invalidated the ban as it applied to labels. Although the
Government asked the Tenth Circuit to review the invalidation of the labeling ban, respondent did not appeal the court's
decision sustaining the advertising ban. On the case's second appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court.

our recent decision in Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761 (1993),

that the " `challenged regulation advances [the Government's]

(quoting Edenfield, supra, at 767-768). After reviewing the

had failed to demonstrate that the prohibition in any wayprevented strength wars. The court found that there was

no evidence of any relationship between the publication offactual information regarding alcohol content and competition on the basis of such content. 2 F. 3d, at 358-359.We granted certiorari, 512 U. S. 1203 (1994), to review the
Tenth Circuit's decision that $ 205(e)(2) violates the FirstAmendment. We conclude that the ban infringes respondent's freedom of speech, and we therefore affirm.

II

A
Soon after the ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment,which repealed the Eighteenth Amendment and ended the

Nation's experiment with Prohibition, Congress enacted theFAAA. The statute establishes national rules governing
the distribution, production, and importation of alcohol andestablished a Federal Alcohol Administration to implement
these rules. Section 5(e)(2) of the Act prohibits any pro-ducer, importer, wholesaler, or bottler of alcoholic beverages
from selling, shipping, or delivering in interstate or foreigncommerce any malt beverages, distilled spirits, or wines in
bottles

"unless such products are bottled, packaged, and labeledin conformity with such regulations, to be prescribed by

the Secretary of the Treasury, with respect to packag-ing, marking, branding, and labeling and size and fill
of container . . . as will provide the consumer withadequate information as to the identity and quality
of the products, the alcoholic content thereof (except
that statements of, or statements likely to be consideredas statements of, alcoholic content of malt beverages

are prohibited unless required by State law and exceptthat, in case of wines, statements of alcoholic content
shall be required only for wines containing more than 14per centum of alcohol by volume), the net contents of

Opinion of the Court
the package, and the manufacturer or bottler or im-porter of the product." 27 U. S. C. $ 205(e)(2) (emphasis added).
The Act defines " `malt beverage[s]' " in such a way as toinclude all beers and ales. $ 211(a)(7).

Implementing regulations promulgated by BATF (underdelegation of authority from the Secretary of the Treasury)
prohibit the disclosure of alcohol content on beer labels. 27CFR $ 7.26(a) (1994).

1 In addition to prohibiting numerical

indications of alcohol content, the labeling regulations pro-scribe descriptive terms that suggest high content, such as

"strong," "full strength," "extra strength," "high test," "highproof," "pre-war strength," and "full oldtime alcoholic
strength." $ 7.29(f). The prohibitions do not preclude la-bels from identifying a beer as "low alcohol," "reduced
alcohol," "non-alcoholic," or "alcohol-free." Ibid.; see also$$ 7.26(b)-(d). By statute and by regulation, the labeling
ban must give way if state law requires disclosure of alco-hol content.

B
Both parties agree that the information on beer labels con-stitutes commercial speech. Though we once took the position that the First Amendment does not protect commercialspeech, see Valentine v. Chrestensen, 316 U. S. 52 (1942), we
repudiated that position in Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Vir-ginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748 (1976).
There we noted that the free flow of commercial informationis "indispensable to the proper allocation of resources in a
free enterprise system" because it informs the numerous pri-vate decisions that drive the system.

Id., at 765. Indeed,we observed that a "particular consumer's interest in the

1 BATF has suspended $ 7.26 to comply with the District Court's order
enjoining the enforcement of that provision. 58 Fed. Reg. 21228 (1993).
Pending the final disposition of this case, interim regulations permit the
disclosure of alcohol content on beer labels. 27 CFR $ 7.71 (1994).

Opinion of the Court
free flow of commercial information . . . may be as keen, ifnot keener by far, than his interest in the day's most urgent

political debate." Id., at 763.Still, Virginia Board of Pharmacy suggested that certain
types of restrictions might be tolerated in the commercialspeech area because of the nature of such speech. See

id.,at 771-772, n. 24. In later decisions we gradually articulated

a test based on " `the "commonsense" distinction betweenspeech proposing a commercial transaction, which occurs
in an area traditionally subject to government regulation,and other varieties of speech.' " Central Hudson, 447 U. S.,
at 562 (quoting Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U. S.447, 455-456 (1978)).

Central Hudson identified several fac-tors that courts should consider in determining whether a

regulation of commercial speech survives First Amendmentscrutiny:

"For commercial speech to come within [the FirstAmendment], it at least must concern lawful activity and
not be misleading. Next, we ask whether the assertedgovernmental interest is substantial. If both inquiries

asserted, and whether it is not more extensive than isnecessary to serve that interest." 447 U. S., at 566.

We now apply Central Hudson's test to $ 205(e)(2).2

2 The Government argues that Central Hudson imposes too strict a
standard for reviewing $ 205(e)(2), and urges us to adopt instead a far
more deferential approach to restrictions on commercial speech concerning
alcohol. Relying on United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co., 509 U. S. 418
(1993), and Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of P. R., 478
U. S. 328 (1986), the Government suggests that legislatures have broader
latitude to regulate speech that promotes socially harmful activities, such
as alcohol consumption, than they have to regulate other types of speech.
Although Edge Broadcasting and Posadas involved the advertising of
gambling activities, the Government argues that we also have applied this
principle to speech concerning alcohol. See California v. LaRue, 409

Opinion of the Court

III
Both the lower courts and the parties agree that respond-ent seeks to disclose only truthful, verifiable, and nonmisleading factual information about alcohol content on its beerlabels. Thus, our analysis focuses on the substantiality of
the interest behind $ 205(e)(2) and on whether the label-ing ban bears an acceptable fit with the Government's goal.
A careful consideration of these factors indicates that$ 205(e)(2) violates the First Amendment's protection of commercial speech. A

The Government identifies two interests it considers suf-ficiently "substantial" to justify $ 205(e)(2)'s labeling ban.
First, the Government contends that $ 205(e)(2) advancesCongress' goal of curbing "strength wars" by beer brewers
who might seek to compete for customers on the basis ofalcohol content. According to the Government, the FAAA's
restriction prevents a particular type of beer drinker--one
U. S. 109, 138 (1972) (holding that States may ban nude dancing in bars
and nightclubs that serve liquor).

Neither Edge Broadcasting nor Posadas compels us to craft an exception to the Central Hudson standard, for in both of those cases we applied
the Central Hudson analysis. Indeed, Edge Broadcasting specifically
avoided reaching the argument the Government makes here because the
Court found that the regulation in question passed muster under Central
Hudson. 509 U. S., at 425. To be sure, Posadas did state that the Puerto
Rico Government could ban promotional advertising of casino gambling
because it could have prohibited gambling altogether. 478 U. S., at 346.
But the Court reached this argument only after it already had found that
the state regulation survived the Central Hudson test. See 478 U. S.,
at 340-344. The Court raised the Government's point in response to an
alternative claim that Puerto Rico's regulation was inconsistent with
Carey v. Population Services Int'l, 431 U. S. 678 (1977), and Bigelow v.
Virginia, 421 U. S. 809 (1975). Posadas, supra, at 345-346.

Nor does LaRue support the Government's position. LaRue did not
involve commercial speech about alcohol, but instead concerned the regulation of nude dancing in places where alcohol was served. 409 U. S., at
114.

Opinion of the Court
who selects a beverage because of its high potency--fromchoosing beers solely for their alcohol content. In the Government's view, restricting disclosure of information regard-ing a particular product characteristic will decrease the extent to which consumers will select the product on the basis
of that characteristic.Respondent counters that Congress actually intended the

FAAA to achieve the far different purpose of preventingbrewers from making inaccurate claims concerning alcohol
content. According to respondent, when Congress passedthe FAAA in 1935, brewers did not have the technology to
produce beer with alcohol levels within predictable tolerances--a skill that modern beer producers now possess.
Further, respondent argues that the true policy guiding federal alcohol regulation is not aimed at suppressing strength
wars. If such were the goal, the Government would not
pursue the opposite policy with respect to wines and distilled
spirits. Although $ 205(e)(2) requires BATF to promulgate
regulations barring the disclosure of alcohol content on beer
labels, it also orders BATF to require the disclosure of alcohol content on the labels of wines and spirits. See 27 CFR

$ 4.36 (1994) (wines); $ 5.37 (distilled spirits).

Rather than suppressing the free flow of factual information in the wine and spirits markets, the Government seeks
to control competition on the basis of strength by monitoring
distillers' promotions and marketing. Respondent quite correctly notes that the general thrust of federal alcohol policy
appears to favor greater disclosure of information, rather
than less. This also seems to be the trend in federal regulation of other consumer products as well. See, e. g., Nutrition
Labeling and Education Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101-535, 104
Stat. 2353, as amended (requiring labels of food products sold
in the United States to display nutritional information).

Respondent offers a plausible reading of the purpose behind $ 205(e)(2), but the prevention of misleading statements
of alcohol content need not be the exclusive Government in514us2$49n 06-11-98 16:59:46 PAGES OPINPGT

485Cite as: 514 U. S. 476 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
terest served by $ 205(e)(2). In Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of P. R., 478 U. S. 328, 341 (1986), we
found that the Puerto Rico Legislature's interest in promot-ing the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens by reducing

their demand for gambling provided a sufficiently "substantial" governmental interest to justify the regulation of gam-bling advertising. So too the Government here has a significant interest in protecting the health, safety, and welfareof its citizens by preventing brewers from competing on the
basis of alcohol strength, which could lead to greater alcohol-ism and its attendant social costs. Both panels of the Court
of Appeals that heard this case concluded that the goal of
suppressing strength wars constituted a substantial interest,
and we cannot say that their conclusion is erroneous. We
have no reason to think that strength wars, if they were to
occur, would not produce the type of social harm that the
Government hopes to prevent.

The Government attempts to bolster its position by arguing that the labeling ban not only curbs strength wars, but
also "facilitates" state efforts to regulate alcohol under the
Twenty-first Amendment. The Solicitor General directs us
to United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co., 509 U. S. 418
(1993), in which we upheld a federal law that prohibited lottery advertising by radio stations located in States that did
not operate lotteries. That case involved a station located
in North Carolina (a nonlottery State) that broadcast lottery
advertisements primarily into Virginia (a State with a lottery). We upheld the statute against First Amendment
challenge in part because it supported North Carolina's antigambling policy without unduly interfering with States that
sponsored lotteries. Id., at 431-435. In this case, the Government claims that the interest behind $ 205(e)(2) mirrors
that of the statute in Edge Broadcasting because it prohibits
disclosure of alcohol content only in States that do not affirmatively require brewers to provide that information. In
the Government's view, this saves States that might wish to

Opinion of the Court
ban such labels the trouble of enacting their own legislation,and it discourages beer drinkers from crossing state lines to

buy beer they believe is stronger.We conclude that the Government's interest in preserving
state authority is not sufficiently substantial to meet the re-quirements of

Central Hudson. Even if the Federal Gov-ernment possessed the broad authority to facilitate state

powers, in this case the Government has offered nothing thatsuggests that States are in need of federal assistance.
States clearly possess ample authority to ban the disclosureof alcohol content--subject, of course, to the same First
Amendment restrictions that apply to the Federal Govern-ment. Unlike the situation in

Edge Broadcasting, the poli-cies of some States do not prevent neighboring States from

pursuing their own alcohol-related policies within their re-spective borders. One State's decision to permit brewers
to disclose alcohol content on beer labels will not precludeneighboring States from effectively banning such disclosure
of that information within their borders.

B
The remaining Central Hudson factors require that a validrestriction on commercial speech directly advance the governmental interest and be no more extensive than necessaryto serve that interest. We have said that "[t]he last two
steps of the Central Hudson analysis basically involve a con-sideration of the `fit' between the legislature's ends and the
means chosen to accomplish those ends." Posadas, supra,at 341. The Tenth Circuit found that $ 205(e)(2) failed to advance the interest in suppressing strength wars sufficientlyto justify the ban. We agree.

Just two Terms ago, in Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761(1993), we had occasion to explain the

Central Hudson factorconcerning whether the regulation of commercial speech "directly advances the governmental interest asserted." Cen-tral Hudson, 447 U. S., at 566. In Edenfield, we decided

487Cite as: 514 U. S. 476 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
that the Government carries the burden of showing that thechallenged regulation advances the Government's interest

"in a direct and material way." 507 U. S., at 767. That bur-den "is not satisfied by mere speculation or conjecture;
rather, a governmental body seeking to sustain a restrictionon commercial speech must demonstrate that the harms it
recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviatethem to a material degree."

Id., at 770-771. We cautionedthat this requirement was critical; otherwise, "a State could

with ease restrict commercial speech in the service of otherobjectives that could not themselves justify a burden on commercial expression." Id., at 771.The Government attempts to meet its burden by pointing
to current developments in the consumer market. It claimsthat beer producers are already competing and advertising
on the basis of alcohol strength in the "malt liquor" segmentof the beer market.

3 The Government attempts to show

that this competition threatens to spread to the rest of themarket by directing our attention to respondent's motives in

bringing this litigation. Respondent allegedly suffers fromconsumer misperceptions that its beers contain less alcohol
than other brands. According to the Government, once re-spondent gains relief from $ 205(e)(2), it will use its labels to
overcome this handicap.Under the Government's theory, $ 205(e)(2) suppresses the
threat of such competition by preventing consumers fromchoosing beers on the basis of alcohol content. It is assuredly a matter of "common sense," Brief for Petitioner 27,that a restriction on the advertising of a product characteristic will decrease the extent to which consumers select a prod-uct on the basis of that trait. In addition to common sense,
the Government urges us to turn to history as a guide. Ac3 " `Malt liquor' is the term used to designate those malt beverages with
the highest alcohol content . . . . Malt liquors represent approximately
three percent of the malt beverage market." Adolph Coors Co. v. Bentsen, 2 F. 3d 355, 358, n. 4 (CA10 1993).

488 RUBIN v. COORS BREWING CO.

Opinion of the Court
cording to the Government, at the time Congress enactedthe FAAA, the use of labels displaying alcohol content had

helped produce a strength war. Section 205(e)(2) allegedlyrelieved competitive pressures to market beer on the basis
of alcohol content, resulting over the long term in beers with
lower alcohol levels.We conclude that $ 205(e)(2) cannot directly and materially

advance its asserted interest because of the overall irratio-nality of the Government's regulatory scheme. While the
laws governing labeling prohibit the disclosure of alcoholcontent unless required by state law, federal regulations
apply a contrary policy to beer advertising. 27 U. S. C.

$ 205(f)(2); 27 CFR $ 7.50 (1994). Like $ 205(e)(2), these restrictions prohibit statements of alcohol content in advertising, but, unlike $ 205(e)(2), they apply only in States that affirmatively prohibit such advertisements. As only 18 States
at best prohibit disclosure of content in advertisements, App.
to Brief for Respondent 1a-12a, brewers remain free to disclose alcohol content in advertisements, but not on labels, in
much of the country. The failure to prohibit the disclosure
of alcohol content in advertising, which would seem to constitute a more influential weapon in any strength war than labels, makes no rational sense if the Government's true aim
is to suppress strength wars.

Other provisions of the FAAA and its regulations similarly undermine $ 205(e)(2)'s efforts to prevent strength
wars. While $ 205(e)(2) bans the disclosure of alcohol content on beer labels, it allows the exact opposite in the case
of wines and spirits. Thus, distilled spirits may contain
statements of alcohol content, 27 CFR $ 5.37 (1994), and such
disclosures are required for wines with more than 14 percent
alcohol, 27 CFR $ 4.36 (1994). If combating strength wars
were the goal, we would assume that Congress would regulate disclosure of alcohol content for the strongest beverages
as well as for the weakest ones. Further, the Government
permits brewers to signal high alcohol content through use

489Cite as: 514 U. S. 476 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
of the term "malt liquor." Although the Secretary has pro-scribed the use of various colorful terms suggesting high alcohol levels, 27 CFR $ 7.29(f ) (1994), manufacturers still candistinguish a class of stronger malt beverages by identifying
them as malt liquors. One would think that if the Govern-ment sought to suppress strength wars by prohibiting numerical disclosures of alcohol content, it also would precludebrewers from indicating higher alcohol beverages by using
descriptive terms.While we are mindful that respondent only appealed the
constitutionality of $ 205(e)(2), these exemptions and incon-sistencies bring into question the purpose of the labeling ban.
To be sure, the Government's interest in combating strengthwars remains a valid goal. But the irrationality of this
unique and puzzling regulatory framework ensures that thelabeling ban will fail to achieve that end. There is little
chance that $ 205(e)(2) can directly and materially advanceits aim, while other provisions of the same Act directly undermine and counteract its effects.This conclusion explains the findings of the courts below.
Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals found thatthe Government had failed to present any credible evidence
showing that the disclosure of alcohol content would promotestrength wars. In the District Court's words, "none of the
witnesses, none of the depositions that I have read, no credi-ble evidence that I have heard, lead[s] me to believe that
giving alcoholic content on labels will in any way promote. . . strength wars." App. to Pet. for Cert. A-38. See also
Bentsen, 2 F. 3d, at 359. Indeed, the District Court con-cluded that "[p]rohibiting the alcoholic content disclosure of
malt beverages on labels has little, if anything, to do withthe type of advertising that promotes strength wars." App.
to Pet. for Cert. A-36.4 As the FAAA's exceptions and reg4 Not only was there little evidence that American brewers intend to
increase alcohol content, but the lower courts also found that "in the
United States . . . the vast majority of consumers . . . value taste and

Opinion of the Court
ulations would have counteracted any effect the labelingban had exerted, it is not surprising that the lower courts

did not find any evidence that $ 205(e)(2) had suppressedstrength wars.

The Government's brief submits anecdotal evidence andeducated guesses to suggest that competition on the basis of
alcohol content is occurring today and that $ 205(e)(2)'s banhas constrained strength wars that otherwise would burst
out of control. These various tidbits, however, cannot over-come the irrationality of the regulatory scheme and the
weight of the record. The Government did not offer anyconvincing evidence that the labeling ban has inhibited
strength wars. Indeed, it could not, in light of the effect ofthe FAAA's other provisions. The absence of strength wars
over the past six decades may have resulted from any num-ber of factors.

Nor do we think that respondent's litigating positions canbe used against it as proof that the Government's regulation
is necessary. That respondent wishes to disseminate factualinformation concerning alcohol content does not demonstrate
that it intends to compete on the basis of alcohol content.Brewers may have many different reasons--only one of
which might be a desire to wage a strength war--why theywish to disclose the potency of their beverages.

Even if $ 205(e)(2) did meet the Edenfield standard, itwould still not survive First Amendment scrutiny because
the Government's regulation of speech is not sufficiently tai-lored to its goal. The Government argues that a sufficient
"fit" exists here because the labeling ban applies to only oneproduct characteristic and because the ban does not prohibit
all disclosures of alcohol content--it applies only to those in-volving labeling and advertising. In response, respondent
suggests several alternatives, such as directly limiting thealcohol content of beers, prohibiting marketing efforts emlower calories--both of which are adversely affected by increased alcohol
strength." Bentsen, 2 F. 3d, at 359; accord, App. to Pet. for Cert. A-37.

phasizing high alcohol strength (which is apparently the pol-icy in some other western nations), or limiting the labeling

ban only to malt liquors, which is the segment of the marketthat allegedly is threatened with a strength war. We agree
that the availability of these options, all of which could ad-vance the Government's asserted interest in a manner less
intrusive to respondent's First Amendment rights, indicatesthat $ 205(e)(2) is more extensive than necessary.

IV
In sum, although the Government may have a substantialinterest in suppressing strength wars in the beer market,

the FAAA's countervailing provisions prevent $ 205(e)(2)from furthering that purpose in a direct and material fashion. The FAAA's defects are further highlighted by theavailability of alternatives that would prove less intrusive to
the First Amendment's protections for commercial speech.Because we find that $ 205(e)(2) fails the Central Hudson
test, we affirm the decision of the court below.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, concurring in the judgment.
Although I agree with the Court's persuasive demon-stration that this statute does not serve the Government's

purported interest in preventing "strength wars," I writeseparately because I am convinced that the constitutional
infirmity in the statute is more patent than the Court's opin-ion indicates. Instead of relying on the formulaic approach
announced in Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. PublicServ. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557 (1980), I believe the
Court should ask whether the justification for allowing moreregulation of commercial speech than other speech has any
application to this unusual statute.In my opinion the "commercial speech doctrine" is unsuited to this case, because the Federal Alcohol Administra514us2$49i 06-11-98 16:59:46 PAGES OPINPGT

tion Act (FAAA) neither prevents misleading speech norprotects consumers from the dangers of incomplete information. A truthful statement about the alcohol content of maltbeverages would receive full First Amendment protection in
any other context; without some justification tailored to thespecial character of commercial speech, the Government
should not be able to suppress the same truthful speechmerely because it happens to appear on the label of a product
for sale. I

The First Amendment generally protects the right not tospeak as well as the right to speak. See

McIntyre v. OhioElections Comm'n, ante, at 342; Miami Herald Publishing

Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U. S. 241 (1974); cf. Wallace v. Jaffree, 472U. S. 38, 51-52 (1985). In the commercial context, however,
government is not only permitted to prohibit misleadingspeech that would be protected in other contexts,

VirginiaBd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council,

Inc., 425 U. S. 748, 771-772 (1976), but it often requires af-firmative disclosures that the speaker might not make voluntarily.1 The regulation of statements about alcohol contentin the statute before us today is a curious blend of prohibitions and requirements. It prohibits the disclosure of thestrength of some malt beverages while requiring the disclosure of the strength of vintage wines. In my judgment theformer prohibition is just as unacceptable in a commercial
context as in any other because it is not supported by therationales for treating commercial speech differently under

the First Amendment: that is, the importance of avoiding
deception and protecting the consumer from inaccurate or
incomplete information in a realm in which the accuracy of
speech is generally ascertainable by the speaker.

I am willing to assume that an interest in avoiding the
harmful consequences of so-called "strength wars" would
justify disclosure requirements explaining the risks and predictable harms associated with the consumption of alcoholic
beverages. Such a measure could be justified as a means to
ensure that consumers are not led, by incomplete or inaccurate information, to purchase products they would not purchase if they knew the truth about them. I see no basis,
however, for upholding a prohibition against the dissemination of truthful, nonmisleading information about an alcoholic
beverage merely because the message is propounded in a
commercial context.

II

The Court's continued reliance on the misguided approach
adopted in Central Hudson makes this case appear more difficult than it is. In Central Hudson, the Court held that
commercial speech is categorically distinct from other speech
protected by the First Amendment. 447 U. S., at 561-566,
and n. 5. Defining "commercial speech," alternatively, as
"expression related solely to the economic interests of the
speaker and its audience," id., at 561, and as " `speech proposing a commercial transaction,' " id., at 562, quoting Ohralik
v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U. S. 447, 455-456 (1978), the
Court adopted its much-quoted four-part test for determining when the government may abridge such expression. In
my opinion the borders of the commercial speech category
are not nearly as clear as the Court has assumed, and its
four-part test is not related to the reasons for allowing more
regulation of commercial speech than other speech. See
Central Hudson, 447 U. S., at 579-582 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).

494 RUBIN v. COORS BREWING CO.

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
The case before us aptly demonstrates the artificiality of arigid commercial/noncommercial distinction. The speech at

issue here is an unadorned, accurate statement, on the labelof a bottle of beer, of the alcohol content of the beverage
contained therein. This, the majority finds, ante, at 481-482, is "commercial speech." The majority does not explain
why the words "4.73% alcohol by volume" 2 are commercial.Presumably, if a nonprofit consumer protection group were
to publish the identical statement, "Coors beer has 4.73%alcohol by volume," on the cover of a magazine, the Court
would not label the speech "commercial." It thus appears,
from the facts of this case, that whether or not speech is"commercial" has no necessary relationship to its content.

If the Coors label is commercial speech, then, I suppose it
must be because (as in Central Hudson) the motivation ofthe speaker is to sell a product, or because the speech tends

to induce consumers to buy a product.3 Yet, economic moti-vation or impact alone cannot make speech less deserving of

constitutional protection, or else all authors and artists whosell their works would be correspondingly disadvantaged.
Neither can the value of speech be diminished solely becauseof its placement on the label of a product. Surely a piece of
newsworthy information on the cover of a magazine, or abook review on the back of a book's dust jacket, is entitled
to full constitutional protection.As a matter of common sense, any description of commercial speech that is intended to identify the category of speech
entitled to less First Amendment protection should relate tothe reasons for permitting broader regulation: namely, commercial speech's potential to mislead. See Virginia Bd. of

2 The 4.73 percent figure comes from an "[i]ndependent [l]aboratory
[a]nalysis" of Coors beer cited in a Coors advertisement. App. 65.

3 The inducement rationale might also apply to a consumer protection

publication, if it is sold on a newsrack, as some consumers will buy the
publication because they wish to learn the varying alcohol contents of competing products.

New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964),the special character of commercial expression justifies restrictions on misleading speech that would not be toleratedelsewhere. As Justice Stewart explained:

"In contrast to the press, which must often attempt toassemble the true facts from sketchy and sometimes
conflicting sources under the pressure of publicationdeadlines, the commercial advertiser generally knows
the product or service he seeks to sell and is in a positionto verify the accuracy of his factual representations before he disseminates them. The advertiser's access tothe truth about his product and its price substantially
eliminates any danger that government regulation offalse or misleading price or product advertising will
chill accurate and nondeceptive commercial expression.There is, therefore, little need to sanction `some falsehood in order to protect speech that matters.' " Vir-ginia Bd. of Pharmacy, 425 U. S., at 777-778 (concurring
opinion), quoting Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S.,at 341.

4 Justice Stewart's reasoning has been the subject of scholarly criticism,
on the ground that some speech surrounding a commercial transaction is
not readily verifiable, while some political speech is easily verifiable by
the speaker. See Farber, Commercial Speech and First Amendment Theory, 74 Nw. U. L. Rev. 372, 385-386 (1979). Although I agree that Justice
Stewart's distinction will not extend to every instance of expression, I
think his theory makes good sense as a general rule. Most of the time, if

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
See also Bates, 433 U. S., at 383.Not only does regulation of inaccurate commercial speech

exclude little truthful speech from the market, but false ormisleading speech in the commercial realm also lacks the
value that sometimes inheres in false or misleading political
speech. Transaction-driven speech usually does not touchon a subject of public debate, and thus misleading statements

in that context are unlikely to engender the beneficial publicdiscourse that flows from political controversy. Moreover,
the consequences of false commercial speech can be particu-larly severe: Investors may lose their savings, and consumers
may purchase products that are more dangerous than theybelieve or that do not work as advertised. Finally, because
commercial speech often occurs in the place of sale, consumers may respond to the falsehood before there is time formore speech and considered reflection to minimize the risks

of being misled. See Ohralik, 436 U. S., at 447, 457-458 (distinguishing in-person attorney solicitation of clients from
written solicitation). The evils of false commercial speech,
which may have an immediate harmful impact on commercial
transactions, together with the ability of purveyors of commercial speech to control falsehoods, explain why we tolerate
more governmental regulation of this speech than of most
other speech.

In this case, the Government has not identified a sufficient
interest in suppressing the truthful, unadorned, informative
speech at issue here. If Congress had sought to regulate all
statements of alcohol content (say, to require that they be
of a size visible to consumers or that they provide specific

a seller is representing a fact or making a prediction about his product,
the seller will know whether his statements are false or misleading and
he will be able to correct them. On the other hand, the purveyor of political speech is more often (though concededly not always) an observer who
is in a poor position to verify its truth. The paradigm example of this
latter phenomenon is, of course, the journalist who must rely on confidential sources for his information.

information for comparative purposes) in order to preventbrewers from misleading consumers as to the true alcohol

content of their beverages, then this would be a differentcase. But absent that concern, I think respondent has a constitutional right to give the public accurate informationabout the alcoholic content of the malt beverages that it produces. I see no reason why the fact that such informationis disseminated on the labels of respondent's products should
diminish that constitutional protection. On the contrary,the statute at issue here should be subjected to the same
stringent review as any other content-based abridgment ofprotected speech.

III
Whatever standard is applied, I find no merit whatsoeverin the Government's assertion that an interest in restraining

competition among brewers to satisfy consumer demand forstronger beverages justifies a statutory abridgment of truthful speech. Any "interest" in restricting the flow of accu-rate information because of the perceived danger of that
knowledge is anathema to the First Amendment; morespeech and a better informed citizenry are among the central
goals of the Free Speech Clause. Accordingly, the Constitu-tion is most skeptical of supposed state interests that seek
to keep people in the dark for what the government believesto be their own good. See Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, 425
U. S., at 769-770; Bates, 433 U. S., at 374-375. One of thevagaries of the "commercial speech" doctrine in its current
form is that the Court sometimes takes such paternalisticmotives seriously. See United States v. Edge Broadcasting
Co., 509 U. S. 418, 439-440 (1993) (Stevens, J., dissenting);
Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of P. R.,478 U. S. 328, 358 (1986) (Brennan, J., dissenting).

In my opinion, the Government's asserted interest, thatconsumers should be misled or uninformed for their own protection, does not suffice to justify restrictions on protectedspeech in any context, whether under "exacting scrutiny" or

some other standard. If Congress is concerned about thepotential for increases in the alcohol content of malt beverages, it may, of course, take other steps to combat theproblem without running afoul of the First Amendment--for
example, Congress may limit directly the alcoholic contentof malt beverages. But Congress may not seek to accomplish the same purpose through a policy of consumerignorance, at the expense of the free-speech rights of the
sellers and purchasers. See Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, 425U. S., at 756-757. If varying alcohol strengths are lawful, I
see no reason why brewers may not advise customers thattheir beverages are stronger--or weaker--than competing
products.In my opinion, this statute is unconstitutional because,
regardless of the standard of review, the First Amendmentmandates rejection of the Government's proffered justification for this restriction. Although some regulations ofstatements about alcohol content that increase consumer
awareness would be entirely proper, this statutory provisionis nothing more than an attempt to blindfold the public.

Accordingly, I concur in the Court's judgment.

CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS

et al. v. MORALES

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 93-1462. Argued January 9, 1995--Decided April 25, 1995
Respondent was sentenced to 15 years to life for the 1980 murder of his

wife and became eligible for parole in 1990. As required by California
law, the Board of Prison Terms (Board) held a hearing in 1989, at which
time it found respondent unsuitable for parole for numerous reasons,
including the fact that he had committed his crime while on parole for
an earlier murder. Respondent would have been entitled to subsequent
suitability hearings annually under the law in place when he murdered
his wife. The law was amended in 1981, however, to allow the Board
to defer subsequent hearings for up to three years for a prisoner convicted of more than one offense involving the taking of a life, if the
Board finds that it is not reasonable to expect that parole would be
granted at a hearing during the intervening years and states the bases
for the finding. Pursuant to this amendment, the Board scheduled respondent's next hearing for 1992. He then filed a federal habeas corpus
petition, asserting that as applied to him, the 1981 amendment constituted an ex post facto law barred by the United States Constitution.
The District Court denied the petition, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the retrospective law made a parole hearing less
accessible to respondent and thus effectively increased his sentence in
violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.

Held: The amendment's application to prisoners who committed their

crimes before it was enacted does not violate the Ex Post Facto
Clause. Pp. 504-514.

(a) The amendment did not increase the "punishment" attached to
respondent's crime. It left untouched his indeterminate sentence and
the substantive formula for securing any reductions to the sentencing
range. By introducing the possibility that the Board would not have to
hold another parole hearing in the year or two after the initial hearing,
the amendment simply altered the method to be followed in fixing a
parole release date under identical substantive standards. Lindsey v.
Washington, 301 U. S. 397; Miller v. Florida, 482 U. S. 423; and Weaver
v. Graham, 450 U. S. 24, distinguished. Pp. 504-508.

(b) Under respondent's expansive view, the Clause would forbid any
legislative change that has any conceivable risk of affecting a prisoner's

punishment. In contrast, this Court has long held that the question of
what legislative adjustments are of sufficient moment to transgress the
constitutional prohibition must be a matter of degree, and has declined
to articulate a single "formula" for making this determination. There
is no need to do so here, either, since the amendment creates only the
most speculative and attenuated possibility of increasing the measure of
punishment for covered crimes, and such conjectural effects are insufficient under any threshold that might be established under the Clause.
The amendment applies only to those who have taken more than one
life, a class of prisoners for whom the likelihood of release on parole is
quite remote. In addition, it affects the timing only of subsequent hearings, and does so only when the Board makes specific findings in the
first hearing. Moreover, the Board has the authority to tailor the frequency of subsequent hearings. Respondent offers no support for his
speculation that prisoners might experience an unanticipated change
that is sufficiently monumental to alter their suitability for parole, or
that such prisoners might be precluded from receiving a subsequent
expedited hearing. Nor is there a reason to think that postponing an
expedited hearing would extend any prisoner's actual confinement period. Since a parole release date often comes at least several years
after a suitability finding, the Board could consider when a prisoner
became "suitable" for parole in setting the actual release date.

their crimes before it was enacted violates the Ex Post FactoClause. We conclude that it does not.

I
California twice has convicted respondent Jose RamonMorales of murder. In 1971, the body of respondent's girlfriend, Gina Wallace, was found in an abandoned medicalbuilding. She had been shot in the head, neck, and abdomen;
her right thumb had been amputated and her face slashedrepeatedly. A bloody fingerprint near the body matched respondent's. A jury found respondent guilty of first-degreemurder, and he was sentenced to life in prison.

While serving his sentence at the State Training Facilityin Soledad, California, respondent met Lois Washabaugh, a
75-year-old woman who had begun visiting inmates aftergaining an interest in prison reform. Ms. Washabaugh visited respondent on numerous occasions, and respondent keptin contact with her through correspondence. Respondent's
letters eventually expressed a romantic interest in Ms. Wash-abaugh, and the two were married some time after respondent's release to a halfway house in April 1980.On July 4, 1980, Ms. Washabaugh left her home and told
friends that she was moving to Los Angeles to live withher new husband. Three days later, police officers found
a human hand on the Hollywood Freeway in Los Angeles.Ms. Washabaugh was reported missing at the end of July,
and fingerprint identification revealed that the hand washers. Her body was never recovered. Respondent was
subsequently arrested and found in possession of Ms. Wash-abaugh's car, purse, credit cards, and diamond rings.

Respondent pleaded nolo contendere to the second-degreemurder of Ms. Washabaugh. He was sentenced to a term of
15 years to life, but became eligible for parole beginning in1990. As required by California law, see Cal. Penal Code
Ann. $ 3041 (West 1982), the Board of Prison Terms (Board)held a hearing on July 25, 1989, to determine respondent's

Opinion of the Court
suitability for parole. California law required the Board toset a release date for respondent unless it found that "the

public safety requires a more lengthy period of incarcerationfor this individual." $ 3041(b). The Board found respondent unsuitable for parole for numerous reasons, includingthe heinous, atrocious, and cruel nature of his offense; the
mutilation of Ms. Washabaugh during or after the mur-der; respondent's record of violence and assaultive behavior;
and respondent's commission of his second murder while onparole for his first. Supplemental App. to Pet. for Cert. 45.

Under the law in place at the time respondent murderedMs. Washabaugh, respondent would have been entitled to
subsequent suitability hearings on an annual basis. 1977Cal. Stats., ch. 165, $ 46. In 1981, however, the California
Legislature had authorized the Board to defer subsequentsuitability hearings for up to three years if the prisoner has
been convicted of "more than one offense which involves thetaking of a life" and if the Board "finds that it is not reasonable to expect that parole would be granted at a hearingduring the following years and states the bases for the finding." Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 3041.5(b)(2) (West 1982).1 Inlight of the considerations that led it to find respondent unsuitable for parole, and based on its conclusion that a longerperiod of observation was required before a parole release
date could be projected, the Board determined that it wasnot reasonable to expect that respondent would be found
suitable for parole in 1990 or 1991. Pursuant to the 1981amendment, the Board scheduled the next hearing for 1992.

1 The statute was again amended in 1990 to allow the Board the alternative of deferring hearings for five years if the prisoner has been convicted
of more than two murders, Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 3041.5(b)(2)(C) (West
Supp. 1994), 1990 Cal. Stats., ch. 1053, and in 1994 to extend that alternative to prisoners convicted of even a single murder, 1994 Cal. Stats., ch.
560. The 5-year deferral applies, however, "only to offenses committed
before July 1, 1977, or on or after January 1, 1991," 1990 Cal. Stats., ch.
1053, and thus appears to have no application to respondent, whose most
recent crime was committed in 1980.

Opinion of the Court
Respondent then filed a federal habeas corpus petition in
the United States District Court for the Central District of
California, asserting that he was being held in custody in
violation of the Federal Constitution. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2254.
Respondent argued that as applied to him, the 1981 amendment constituted an ex post facto law barred by Article I,

$ 10, of the United States Constitution. The District Court
denied respondent's habeas petition, but the United States
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. 16 F. 3d
1001 (1994).2 Because "a prisoner cannot be paroled without
first having a parole hearing," the Court of Appeals concluded that "any retrospective law making parole hearings
less accessible would effectively increase the [prisoner's] sentence and violate the ex post facto clause." Id., at 1004.
The Court of Appeals accordingly held that the Board was
constitutionally constrained to provide respondent with annual parole suitability hearings, as required by the law in
effect when he committed his crime. Id., at 1006.

We granted certiorari, 512 U. S. 1287 (1994), and we now
reverse.

II

Article I, $ 10, of the Constitution prohibits the States
from passing any "ex post facto Law." In Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37, 41 (1990), we reaffirmed that the Ex Post
Facto Clause incorporated "a term of art with an established
meaning at the time of the framing of the Constitution." In
accordance with this original understanding, we have held
that the Clause is aimed at laws that "retroactively alter the
definition of crimes or increase the punishment for criminal
acts." Id., at 43 (citing Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 391-392

2 During the pendency of this action, respondent appeared before the
Board for his 1992 suitability hearing. The Board again found respondent
unsuitable and again determined that it was not reasonable to expect that
he would be found suitable for parole at the following two annual hearings.
Respondent's next suitability hearing was then set for 1995.

Opinion of the Court
(1798) (opinion of Chase, J.); Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U. S. 167,169-170 (1925)).

The legislation at issue here effects no change in the defi-nition of respondent's crime. Instead, the question before
us is whether the 1981 amendment to $ 3041.5 increases the
"punishment" attached to respondent's crime. In arguingthat it does, respondent relies chiefly on a trilogy of cases

holding that a legislature may not stiffen the "standard ofpunishment" applicable to crimes that have already been
committed. See Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U. S. 397, 401(1937);

Miller v. Florida, 482 U. S. 423 (1987); Weaver v.
Graham, 450 U. S. 24 (1981).

In Lindsey, we established the proposition that the Constitution "forbids the application of any new punitive measure
to a crime already consummated." 301 U. S., at 401. The
petitioners in Lindsey had been convicted of grand larceny,
and the sentencing provision in effect at the time they committed their crimes provided for a maximum sentence of "not
more than fifteen years." Id., at 398. The applicable law
called for sentencing judges to impose an indeterminate sentence up to whatever maximum they selected, so long as it
did not exceed 15 years. Id., at 398, 400. Before the petitioners were sentenced, however, a new statute was passed
that required the judge to sentence the petitioners to the
15-year maximum; under the new statute, the petitioners
could secure an earlier release only through the grace of the
parole board. Id., at 398-399. We held that the application
of this statute to petitioners violated the Ex Post Facto
Clause because "the measure of punishment prescribed by
the later statute is more severe than that of the earlier."
Id., at 401.

Weaver and Miller held that the Ex Post Facto Clause
forbids the States to enhance the measure of punishment
by altering the substantive "formula" used to calculate the
applicable sentencing range. In Weaver, the petitioner
had been sentenced to 15 years in prison for his crime of

Opinion of the Court
second-degree murder. Both at the time of his crime and atthe time his sentence was imposed, state statutes provided

a formula for mandatory reductions to the terms of all pris-oners who complied with certain prison regulations and state
laws. The statute that the petitioner challenged and thatwe invalidated retroactively reduced the amount of "gain
time" credits available to prisoners under this formula.Though the statute preserved the possibility that some prisoners might win back these credits if they convinced prisonofficials to exercise their discretion to find that they were
especially deserving, see 450 U. S., at 34, n. 18, we found thatit effectively eliminated the lower end of the possible range
of prison terms. Id., at 26-27, 31-33. The statute at issuein Miller contained a similar defect. The Florida sentencing scheme had established "presumptive sentencing ranges"for various offenses, which sentencing judges were required
to follow in the absence of "clear and convincing reasons"for a departure. At the time that the petitioner in Miller
committed his crime, his presumptive sentencing rangewould have been 3

1/2 to 41/2 years. Before his sentencing,

however, the state legislature altered the formula for estab-lishing the presumptive sentencing range for certain sexual

offenses by increasing the "primary offense points" assignedto those crimes. As a result, petitioner's presumptive range
jumped to 51/2 to 7 years. We held that the resulting in-crease in the "quantum of punishment" violated the Ex Post
Facto Clause. 482 U. S., at 433-434.3

3 Our opinions in Lindsey, Weaver, and Miller suggested that enhancements to the measure of criminal punishment fall within the ex post facto
prohibition because they operate to the "disadvantage" of covered offenders. See Lindsey, 301 U. S., at 401; Weaver, 450 U. S., at 29; Miller, 482
U. S., at 433. But that language was unnecessary to the results in those
cases and is inconsistent with the framework developed in Collins v.
Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37, 41 (1990). After Collins, the focus of the ex
post facto inquiry is not on whether a legislative change produces some
ambiguous sort of "disadvantage," nor, as the dissent seems to suggest,
on whether an amendment affects a prisoner's "opportunity to take advan514us2$50N 05-27-98 18:19:34 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
Respondent insists that the California amendment beforeus is indistinguishable from the legislation at issue in Lindsey, Weaver, and Miller, and he contends that those casescontrol this one. We disagree. Both before and after the
1981 amendment, California punished the offense of second-degree murder with an indeterminate sentence of "confinement in the state prison for a term of 15 years to life." Cal.Penal Code Ann. $ 190 (West 1982). The amendment also
left unchanged the substantive formula for securing any re-ductions to this sentencing range. Thus, although 15 years
was the formal "minimum" term of confinement, see ibid.,respondent was able to secure a one-third "credit" or reduction in this minimum by complying with prison rules andregulations, see $ 2931. The amendment had no effect on
the standards for fixing a prisoner's initial date of "eligibil-ity" for parole, see In re Jackson, 39 Cal. 3d 464, 476, 703
P. 2d 100, 108 (1985), or for determining his "suitability" forparole and setting his release date, see Cal. Penal Code Ann.

$$ 3041, 3041.5 (West 1982).The 1981 amendment made only one change: It introduced
the possibility that after the initial parole hearing, the Boardwould not have to hold another hearing the very next year,
or the year after that, if it found no reasonable probabilitythat respondent would be deemed suitable for parole in the
interim period. $ 3041.5(b)(2). In contrast to the laws atissue in

Lindsey, Weaver, and Miller (which had the purposeand effect of enhancing the range of available prison terms,

see Miller, supra, at 433-434), the evident focus of the Cali-fornia amendment was merely " `to relieve the [Board] from
the costly and time-consuming responsibility of schedulingparole hearings' " for prisoners who have no reasonable
chance of being released. In re Jackson, supra, at 473, 703P. 2d, at 106 (quoting legislative history). Rather than

tage of provisions for early release," see post, at 518, but on whether any
such change alters the definition of criminal conduct or increases the penalty by which a crime is punishable.

Opinion of the Court
changing the sentencing range applicable to covered crimes,the 1981 amendment simply "alters the method to be followed" in fixing a parole release date under identical sub-stantive standards. See Miller, supra, at 433 (contrasting
adjustment to presumptive sentencing range with change in"the method to be followed in determining the appropriate
sentence"); see also Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U. S. 282, 293-294 (1977) (contrasting change in the "quantum of punishment" with statute that merely "altered the methods em-ployed in determining whether the death penalty was to be
imposed"). III

Respondent nonetheless urges us to hold that the Ex Post
Facto Clause forbids any legislative change that has anyconceivable risk of affecting a prisoner's punishment. In

his view, there is "no principled way to determine how sig-nificant a risk of enhanced confinement is to be tolerated."
Brief for Respondent 39. Our cases have never acceptedthis expansive view of the

Ex Post Facto Clause, and we willnot endorse it here.

Respondent's approach would require that we invalidateany of a number of minor (and perhaps inevitable) mechanical changes that might produce some remote risk of impacton a prisoner's expected term of confinement. Under respondent's approach, the judiciary would be charged underthe

Ex Post Facto Clause with the micromanagement of anendless array of legislative adjustments to parole and sentencing procedures, including such innocuous adjustments aschanges to the membership of the Board of Prison Terms,
restrictions on the hours that prisoners may use the prisonlaw library, reductions in the duration of the parole hearing,
restrictions on the time allotted for a convicted defendant'sright of allocution before a sentencing judge, and page limitations on a defendant's objections to presentence reports oron documents seeking a pardon from the governor. These
and countless other changes might create some speculative,

Opinion of the Court
attenuated risk of affecting a prisoner's actual term of confinement by making it more difficult for him to make a persuasive case for early release, but that fact alone cannot end
the matter for ex post facto purposes.4

Indeed, contrary to the approach advocated by respondent,
we have long held that the question of what legislative adjustments "will be held to be of sufficient moment to transgress the constitutional prohibition" must be a matter of
"degree." Beazell, 269 U. S., at 171. In evaluating the constitutionality of the 1981 amendment, we must determine
whether it produces a sufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to the covered crimes.5 We
have previously declined to articulate a single "formula" for
identifying those legislative changes that have a sufficient
effect on substantive crimes or punishments to fall within
the constitutional prohibition, see ibid., and we have no occasion to do so here. The amendment creates only the most
speculative and attenuated possibility of producing the prohibited effect of increasing the measure of punishment for
covered crimes, and such conjectural effects are insufficient
under any threshold we might establish under the Ex Post
Facto Clause. See Dobbert, supra, at 294 (refusing to accept
"speculation" that the effective punishment under a new

4 The dissent proposes a line between those measures that deprive prisoners of a parole hearing and those that "make it more difficult for prisoners to obtain release." Post, at 524. But this arbitrary line has absolutely no basis in the Constitution. If a delay in parole hearings raises ex
post facto concerns, it is because that delay effectively increases a prisoner's term of confinement, and not because the hearing itself has independent constitutional significance. Other adjustments to mechanisms surrounding the sentencing process should be evaluated under the same
standard.

5 Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, see post, at 519, we express no

view as to the constitutionality of any of a number of other statutes that
might alter the timing of parole hearings under circumstances different
from those present here.

statutory scheme would be "more onerous" than under theold one).

First, the amendment applies only to a class of prisonersfor whom the likelihood of release on parole is quite remote.

The amendment enabled the Board to extend the time be-tween suitability hearings only for those prisoners who have
been convicted of "more than one offense which involves thetaking of a life." Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 3041.5(b)(2) (West
1982).7 The California Supreme Court has noted that about

6 The dissent suggests that any "speculation" as to the effect of the
amendment on prison terms should "ru[n] in the other direction," post, at
525, but this approach effectively shifts to the State the burden of persuasion as to respondent's ex post facto claim. Not surprisingly, the dissent
identifies no support for its attempt to undo the settled rule that a claimant must bear the risk of nonpersuasion as to the existence of an alleged
constitutional violation. Although we have held that a party asserting an
ex post facto claim need not carry the burden of showing that he would
have been sentenced to a lesser term under the measure or range of punishments in place under the previous statutory scheme, see Lindsey v.
Washington, 301 U. S., at 401, we have never suggested that the challenging party may escape the ultimate burden of establishing that the
measure of punishment itself has changed. Indeed, elimination of that
burden would eviscerate the view of the Ex Post Facto Clause that we
reaffirmed in Collins. Just as "[t]he inhibition upon the passage of ex
post facto laws does not give a criminal a right to be tried, in all respects,
by the law in force when the crime charged was committed," Gibson v.
Mississippi, 162 U. S. 565, 590 (1896), neither does it require that the sentence be carried out under the identical legal regime that previously

prevailed.

7 The dissent mischaracterizes our analysis in suggesting that we somehow have concocted a "reduced" standard of judicial scrutiny for application to "a narrow group as unpopular . . . as multiple murderers." Post,
at 522. The ex post facto standard we apply today is constant: It looks to
whether a given legislative change has the prohibited effect of altering
the definition of crimes or increasing punishments. Our application of
that standard necessarily considers a number of factors--including, in this
case, that the 1981 amendment targets a group of prisoners whom the
California Legislature deemed less likely than others to secure early release on parole--but the constitutional standard is neither "enhanced" nor

90% of all prisoners are found unsuitable for parole at theinitial hearing, while 85% are found unsuitable at the second

and subsequent hearings. In re Jackson, 39 Cal. 3d, at 473,703 P. 2d, at 105. In light of these numbers, the amendment
"was seen as a means `to relieve the [Board] from the costlyand time-consuming responsibility of scheduling parole hearings for prisoners who have no chance of being released.' "
Ibid. (quoting legislative history).Second, the Board's authority under the amendment is

carefully tailored to that end. The amendment has no effecton the date of any prisoner's initial parole suitability hearing;
it affects the timing only of subsequent hearings. Accord-ingly, the amendment has no effect on any prisoner unless
the Board has first concluded, after a hearing, not only thatthe prisoner is unsuitable for parole, but also that "it is not
reasonable to expect that parole would be granted at a hear-ing during the following years." Cal. Penal Code Ann.

Morris v. Castro, 166 Cal. App. 3d 33, 38, 212 Cal. Rptr. 299,302 (1985); the Board must conduct "a full hearing and review" of all relevant facts, ibid., and state the bases for itsfinding. Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 3041.5(b)(2) (West 1982).
Though California law is not entirely clear on this point, thereliability of the Board's determination may also be enhanced
by the possibility of an administrative appeal. See 15 Cal.Admin. Code $ 2050 (1994).

Moreover, the Board retains the authority to tailor thefrequency of subsequent suitability hearings to the particular circumstances of the individual prisoner. The default re-quirement is an annual hearing, but the Board may defer
the next hearing up to two years more depending on thecircumstances. Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 3041.5(b)(2) (West

Opinion of the Court
peated violent crimes both in prison and while on parolecould perhaps expect a 3-year delay between suitability

hearings, while a prisoner who poses a lesser threat to the"public safety," see $ 3041(b), might receive only a 2-year
delay. In light of the particularized findings required under
the amendment and the broad discretion given to the Board,the narrow class of prisoners covered by the amendment cannot reasonably expect that their prospects for early releaseon parole would be enhanced by the opportunity of annual
hearings. For these prisoners, the amendment simplyallows the Board to avoid the futility of going through the
motions of reannouncing its denial of parole suitability on a
yearly basis.

Respondent suggests that there is some chance that the
amendment might nevertheless produce an increased term
of confinement for some prisoners who might experience a
change of circumstances that could render them suitable for
parole during the period between their hearings. Brief for
Respondent 39. Respondent fails, however, to provide any
support for his speculation that the multiple murderers and
other prisoners subject to the amendment might experience
an unanticipated change that is sufficiently monumental to
alter their suitability for release on parole. Even if we assume the possibility of such a change, moreover, there is no
reason to conclude that the amendment will have any effect
on any prisoner's actual term of confinement, for the current
record provides no basis for concluding that a prisoner who
experiences a drastic change of circumstances would be precluded from seeking an expedited hearing from the Board.
Indeed, the California Supreme Court has suggested that
under the circumstances hypothesized by respondent "the
Board could advance the suitability hearing," In re Jackson,
supra, at 475, 703 P. 2d, at 107, and the California Department of Corrections indicates in its brief that the Board's
"practice" is to "review for merit any communication from
an inmate asking for an earlier suitability hearing," Reply

Opinion of the Court
Brief for Petitioner 3, n. 1. If the Board's decision to post-pone the hearing is subject to administrative appeal, the controlling regulations also seem to preserve the possibility of abelated appeal. See 15 Cal. Admin. Code $ 2050 (1994) (time
limits for administrative appeals "are directory only and may
be extended"). An expedited hearing by the Board--eitheron its own volition or pursuant to an order entered on

an administrative appeal--would remove any possibility ofharm even under the hypothetical circumstances suggested
by respondent.Even if a prisoner were denied an expedited hearing, there
is no reason to think that such postponement would extend
any prisoner's actual period of confinement. According to
the California Supreme Court, the possibility of immediate
release after a finding of suitability for parole is largely "theoretica[l]," In re Jackson, 39 Cal. 3d, at 474, 703 P. 2d, at
106; in many cases, the prisoner's parole release date comes
at least several years after a finding of suitability. To the
extent that these cases are representative, it follows that
"the `practical effect' of a hearing postponement is not significant." Id., at 474, 703 P. 2d, at 106-107. This is because
the Board is bound by statute to consider "any sentencing
information relevant to the setting of parole release dates"
with an eye toward establishing "uniform terms for offenses
of similar gravity and magnitude in respect to their threat
to the public." Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 3041(a) (West 1982).
Under these standards, the fact that a prisoner had been
"suitable" for parole prior to the date of the hearing certainly would be "relevant" to the Board's decision in setting
an actual release date, and the Board retains the discretion
to expedite the release date of such a prisoner. Thus, a prisoner who could show that he was "suitable" for parole two
years prior to such a finding by the Board might well be
entitled to secure a release date that reflects that fact. Such
a prisoner's ultimate date of release would be entirely unaffected by the change in the timing of suitability hearings.

Given these circumstances, we conclude that the Californialegislation at issue creates only the most speculative and

attenuated risk of increasing the measure of punishmentattached to the covered crimes. The Ninth Circuit's judgment that the amendment violates the Ex Post Facto Clauseis accordingly reversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter joins,dissenting.

In 1980, respondent was charged with the murder of hiswife. Despite respondent's previous conviction for firstdegree murder, and despite the serious character of the 1980offense, California accepted his plea of nolo contendere to
the offense of second-degree murder. The trial judge im-posed a sentence of imprisonment for 15 years to life, under
which respondent became eligible for parole in 1990.The law in effect at the time of respondent's offense entitled him to a hearing before the Board of Prison Terms(Board) in 1989 and in each year thereafter. In 1981, however, California amended its parole statute. The amendedstatute permitted the Board to delay parole hearings for
multiple murderers for up to three years, provided the Boardfound that "it is not reasonable to expect that parole would
be granted at a hearing during the following years." Cal.Penal Code Ann. $ 3041.5(b)(2) (West 1982). In 1989, the
Board determined that respondent was not yet "suitable" forparole, and, after making the requisite findings, the Board
deferred respondent's next hearing for three years. Thequestion before the Court is whether the California Legislature's 1981 elimination of the statutory right to an annualparole hearing increased the punishment for respondent's
1980 offense and thereby violated the Ex Post Facto Clause.In answering that question, I begin with certain propositions of law that I do not understand the Court to dispute.

Those propositions compel the conclusion that, as applied tothe general prison population, replacing a statutory right to

an annual parole hearing with a right to such a hearing everythree years would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the
Federal Constitution. Though nowhere disputing this con-clusion, the majority holds that the 1981 amendment to the
California parole statute is not ex post facto legislationbecause it applies only to a small subset of the prison population, namely multiple murderers, see ante, at 510, andbecause the Board must make a special finding before
depriving a prisoner of an annual hearing, see ante, at 511.In my view, neither of these features is sufficient to save
what is otherwise a plainly invalid statute.

I
The Constitution provides that "[n]o State shall . . . passany . . . ex post facto Law." Art. I, $ 10. The Framers

viewed the prohibition on ex post facto legislation as one ofthe fundamental protections against arbitrary and oppressive government.1 Thus, for example, Madison noted that"ex post facto laws . . . are contrary to the first principles of
the social compact and to every principle of sound legisla-tion." The Federalist No. 44, p. 282 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).
Similarly, Hamilton counted the prohibition on ex post factolaws among the three protections that he described as
"greater securities to liberty and republicanism than any [theConstitution] contains."

Id., No. 84, at 511.Although the text of the Ex Post Facto Clause is not selfexplanatory, its basic coverage has been well understood atleast since 1798, when the Court in

Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall.

1 That the Framers included two separate clauses in the Constitution
prohibiting ex post facto legislation, see Art. I, $ 9, cl. 3 ("No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed"); Art. I, $ 10 ("No State shall
. . . pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the
Obligation of Contracts"), highlights the Framers' appraisal of the importance of that prohibition.

386, 390, identified four categories of ex post facto laws.2The case before us today implicates the third Calder category, which consists of "[e]very law that changes the punish-ment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed." Ibid. (emphasis inoriginal). This Court has consistently condemned laws falling in that category. Thus, in Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U. S. 167(1925), Justice Stone noted that it "is settled, by decisions of
this Court so well known that their citation may be dis-pensed with, that any statute . . . which makes more burdensome the punishment for a crime, after its commission, . . .is prohibited as

ex post facto." Id., at 169-170. We reaf-firmed Justice Stone's observation only a few years ago: "The

Beazell formulation is faithful to our best knowledge of theoriginal understanding of the

Ex Post Facto Clause: Legisla-tures may not retroactively . . . increase the punishment for

criminal acts." Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37, 43(1990).

In light of the importance that the Framers placed on the
Ex Post Facto Clause, we have always enforced the prohibi-tion against the retroactive enhancement scrupulously. Any

statute that authorizes an increased term of imprisonmentfor a past offense is invalid. Thus, although the Court has
carefully examined laws changing the conditions of confine-ment to determine whether they are favorable or unfavorable to the prisoner, see, e. g., Rooney v. North Dakota, 196U. S. 319, 325 (1905);

In re Medley, 134 U. S. 160, 171 (1890),no Member of the Court has ever voted to uphold a statute

2 "1st. Every law that makes an action done before the passing of the
law, and which was innocent when done, criminal; and punishes such action. 2d. Every law that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it
was, when committed. 3d. Every law that changes the punishment, and
inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when
committed. 4th. Every law that alters the legal rules of evidence, and
receives less, or different, testimony, than the law required at the time of
the commission of the offence, in order to convict the offender." Calder
v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390 (1798) (emphasis in original).

that retroactively increased the length of time that a pris-oner must remain imprisoned for past offenses, see,

e. g.,
Miller v. Florida, 482 U. S. 423 (1987) (unanimous opinion);
Weaver v. Graham, 450 U. S. 24 (1981) (without dissent).

Our ex post facto jurisprudence concerning increased
punishment has established three important propositions.First, the Court has squarely held that an individual prisoner

need not prove that the retroactive application of a law au-thorizing an increased punishment for a past offense has actually affected the sentence that that prisoner must serve.In

Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U. S. 397 (1937), for example,
petitioners were sentenced under a law that required a sen-tence of 15 years; the law in effect at the time of the offense

gave the judge discretion to impose a lesser sentence. The
State contended that petitioners had failed to show thatthere was an

ex post facto violation because petitioners
might have received a 15-year sentence even under the oldlaw. We unanimously rejected the State's contention:

"[T]he ex post facto clause looks to the standard of pun-ishment prescribed by a statute, rather than to the sentence actually imposed. . . ."Removal of the possibility of a sentence of less than
fifteen years, at the end of which petitioners would befreed from further confinement and the tutelage of a
parole revocable at will, operates to their detriment inthe sense that the standard of punishment adopted by
the new statute is more onerous than that of the old."
Id., at 401.

Only a few years ago, in Miller v. Florida, 482 U. S. 423
(1987), we unanimously reaffirmed the holding in Lindsey,
noting that "Lindsey establishes `that one is not barred from
challenging a change in the penal code on ex post facto
grounds simply because the sentence he received under the
new law was not more onerous than that which he might
have received under the old.' " 482 U. S., at 432 (citation

omitted). As we stated succinctly in Weaver v. Graham, 450
U. S., at 33, "[t]he inquiry looks to the challenged provision,
and not to any special circumstances that may mitigate its
effect on the particular individual."

Second, we have noted that an impermissible increase in
the punishment for a crime may result not only from statutes
that govern initial sentencing but also from statutes that
govern parole or early release. Thus, in Weaver v. Graham,
we addressed a Florida statute that altered the availability
of good-time credits. We rejected any notion that the removal of good-time credits did not constitute an increase in
punishment, explaining that "a prisoner's eligibility for reduced imprisonment is a significant factor entering into both
the defendant's decision to plea bargain and the judge's calculation of the sentence to be imposed." Id., at 32, citing
Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539, 557 (1974); Warden v.
Marrero, 417 U. S. 653, 658 (1974). See also Greenfield v.
Scafati, 277 F. Supp. 644, 645 (Mass. 1967) (three-judge
court) ("The availability of good conduct deductions is considered an essential element of the sentence"), summarily
aff 'd, 390 U. S. 713 (1968).

Finally, we have held that an increase in punishment occurs when the State deprives a person of the opportunity
to take advantage of provisions for early release. Thus, in
Weaver we emphasized that "petitioner is . . . disadvantaged
by the reduced opportunity to shorten his time in prison simply through good conduct." 450 U. S., at 33-34. Our statement in Weaver was consistent with our holding in Lindsey
that "[i]t is plainly to the substantial disadvantage of petitioners to be deprived of all opportunity to receive a sentence which would give them freedom from custody and control prior to the expiration of the 15-year term." 301 U. S.,
at 401-402. See also Greenfield v. Scafati, 277 F. Supp. 644

found an ex post facto violation in a statute that eliminatedthe opportunity to accumulate gain time for the first six

months following parole revocation as applied to an inmatewhose crime occurred before the statute's enactment).

These settled propositions make perfectly clear that theretroactive application of a simple statute that changed the
frequency of a statutorily mandated annual parole suitabilityhearing would constrict an inmate's opportunity to earn
early release and would thus constitute increased punish-ment in violation of the

Ex Post Facto Clause. It is thus nosurprise that nearly every Federal Court of Appeals and

State Supreme Court to consider the issue has so held. See,
e. g., 16 F. 3d 1001 (CA9 1994) (case below); Roller v. Cava-naugh, 984 F. 2d 120 (CA4), cert. dism'd, 510 U. S. 42 (1993);

Akins v. Snow, 922 F. 2d 1558 (CA11), cert. denied, 501 U. S.1260 (1991); Rodriguez v. United States Parole Commission,
594 F. 2d 170 (CA7 1979); State v. Reynolds, 642 A. 2d 1368(N. H. 1994); Griffin v. State, 315 S. C. 285, 433 S. E. 2d 862
(1993), cert. denied, 510 U. S. 1093 (1994); Tiller v. Klincar,138 Ill. 2d 1, 561 N. E. 2d 576 (1990), cert. denied, 498 U. S.
1031 (1991).3The 1981 amendment at issue in this case, of course, is not
such a simple statute. It is therefore necessary to considerwhether the particular features of that amendment eliminate
the ex post facto problems.

3 The two contrary decisions cited by the parties, see Bailey v. Gardebring, 940 F. 2d 1150 (CA8 1991); In re Jackson, 39 Cal. 3d 464, 703 P. 2d
100 (1985), do not undermine my thesis. In Bailey v. Gardebring, a 2-to-1
decision, the Court of Appeals found no ex post facto violation when Minnesota failed to provide a prisoner with an annual parole hearing. However, one member of the majority premised his conclusion on the view that
the Minnesota parole regulations were not "laws"; the other member of
the majority concurred only in the result, but authored no opinion. In In
re Jackson, the California Supreme Court upheld the very amendment at
issue in this case and thus did not speak to the more general situation I
have described in the text.

The first special feature that the majority identifies in the1981 amendment, see

ante, at 510, is that it applies only tothe narrow class of prisoners who have "been convicted, in

the same or different proceedings, of more than one offensewhich involves the taking of a life." Cal. Penal Code Ann.

$ 3041.5(b)(2) (West 1982). In my view, the 1981 amend-ment's narrow focus on that discrete class of prisoners implicates one of the principal concerns that underlies the consti-tutional prohibition against retrospective legislation--the
danger that the legislature will usurp the judicial power andwill legislate so as to administer justice unfairly against particular individuals. This concern has been at the forefrontof our

ex post facto jurisprudence. As Justice Harlan noted:"[T]he policy of the prohibition against

ex post facto legisla-tion would seem to rest on the apprehension that the legislature, in imposing penalties on past conduct, . . . may be actingwith a purpose not to prevent dangerous conduct generally
but to impose by legislation a penalty against specific per-sons or classes of persons." James v. United States, 366
U. S. 213, 247, n. 3 (1961) (Harlan, J., concurring in part anddissenting in part). Our cases have thus consistently noted
that the Ex Post Facto Clauses protect against the dangerof such "vindictive legislation."

Miller v. Florida, 482 U. S.,at 429; Weaver v. Graham, 450 U. S., at 29; see also Malloy

v. South Carolina, 237 U. S. 180, 183 (1915). The narrowerthe class burdened by retroactive legislation, the greater the
danger that the legislation has the characteristics of a bill ofattainder.

apply either to named individuals or to easily ascertainable members of a
group in such a way as to inflict punishment on them without a judicial
trial are bills of attainder prohibited by the Constitution." United
States v. Lovett, 328 U. S. 303, 315-316 (1946) (internal quotation marks

(Breyer, J., concurring in judgment) (finding a separation-of-powers violation in part because of the statute's "application to a limited number of individuals"); see generally ante,at 241-242 (discussing the dangers of statutes focused at particular groups of individuals).I believe that the 1981 amendment implicates this core

expost facto concern. The narrow class of affected individuals

belies the majority's acceptance of the proposition that "theevident focus," ante, at 507, of the 1981 amendment was to
save costs. Surely, even today, multiple murderers make upbut a small fraction of total parole hearings; eliminating
those hearings would seem unlikely to create substantialsavings. Indeed, though the majority gives credence to the
budget-cutting rationale, petitioners are much more frankabout their motivations, as they urge the Court to "reexamine" its ex post facto jurisprudence "[i]n view of the nationaltrend towards the implementation of harsher penalties and
conditions of confinement for offenders and inmates." Brieffor Petitioners 11 (footnote omitted).

I agree with petitioners' implication that the 1981 amend-ment is better viewed as part of that national trend toward
"get-tough-on-crime" legislation. The California statutechallenged in this case is one of many currently popular statutes designed to cut back on the availability of parole. TheCalifornia Legislature has adopted several similar provisions
in recent years,5 and a number of other States have passedcomparable legislation.

6 Such measures are, of course, entirely legitimate when they operate prospectively, but their

are obviously closely related. See, e. g., Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87,
138-139 (1810).

5 The California Legislature appears to have altered the frequency of

parole hearings for some prisoners on at least three occasions since the
1981 amendment. See 1986 Cal. Stats., ch. 248, $ 166; 1990 Cal. Stats.,
ch. 1053, $ 1; 1994 Cal. Stats., ch. 560, $ 1.

importance and prevalence surely justify careful reviewwhen those measures change the consequences of past

conduct.The danger of legislative overreaching against which the
Ex Post Facto Clause protects is particularly acute when thetarget of the legislation is a narrow group as unpopular (to
put it mildly) as multiple murderers. There is obviously lit-tle legislative hay to be made in cultivating the multiple murderer vote. For a statute such as the 1981 amendment,therefore, the concerns that animate the

Ex Post FactoClause demand enhanced, and not (as the majority seems to

believe) reduced, judicial scrutiny.7

III
The second feature of the 1981 amendment on which themajority relies is the provision requiring that the Board

make certain findings before it may defer the annual hear-ings. At the time of respondent's crime, the Board was instructed either to set a parole date at an inmate's initial pa-role hearing or, if it set no date, to provide the inmate with
a written statement explaining the reasons for the denial andsuggesting "activities in which he might participate that will
benefit him while he is incarcerated." The statute providedthat the Board "shall hear each case annually thereafter."
Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 3041.5(b)(2) (West 1982).The 1981 amendment allows the Board to defer the annual
hearings for multiple murderers for up to three years if "the[B]oard finds that it is not reasonable to expect that parole

7 Though the Court suggests that "multiple murderers" have a particularly low likelihood of parole, ante, at 510-511, n. 7, the statute in effect
at the time of respondent's offense determined that even multiple murderers were sufficiently likely candidates for early release to be entitled to an
annual parole hearing. The grant of that statutory right reflected the
California Legislature's judgment that such a hearing provided an important avenue to reduced punishment. The Ex Post Facto Clause, properly
construed, should prevent the legislature from revising that judgment
retroactively.

would be granted at a hearing during the following yearsand states the bases for the finding." Ibid. The statute

does not contain any provision authorizing any sort of reviewof a Board order dispensing with annual hearings. Nor does
it provide any procedure for dealing with exceptionalchanged circumstances warranting the setting of a release
date that might arise before the next scheduled hearing. Inshort, the amended statute vests unreviewable discretion in
the Board to dispense with annual hearings for up to threeyears by making the required finding.

In my view, the requirement that the Board make thisfinding is insufficient to render the 1981 amendment constitutional. We have previously expressed doubts that an earlyrelease regime that substitutes administrative discretion for
statutory requirements complies with the Ex Post FactoClause. In Weaver v. Graham, we noted that the state statute at issue reduced the amount of gain time to which aninmate was "automatically entitled . . . simply for avoiding
disciplinary infractions and performing his assigned tasks."450 U. S., at 35. The State argued, however, that the statute as a whole caused inmates no increase in punishmentbecause the statute provided inmates with new ways to earn
gain time. We rejected the State's argument, noting that"the award of the extra gain time is purely discretionary,
contingent on both the wishes of the correctional authoritiesand special behavior by the inmate."

Ibid.The reasoning behind our skepticism in

Weaver is applica-ble to this case. As is true under almost any factfinding

regime, the Board will occasionally make mistakes and willdefer parole hearings for inmates who would have been
found suitable at those hearings.8 Because the parole hear8 There may be reasons to be particularly skeptical of the reliability of
the Board's findings with respect to deferrals under the 1981 amendment.

parole and the determination that the inmate will not be suitable for
parole in the next three years are expected to be separate determina514us2$50I 05-27-98 18:19:34 PAGES OPINPGT

ing is a prerequisite for early release, the inmates affectedby the Board's errors will have had their punishment increased. In my view, the Court's speculation about possiblemethods of correcting the Board's erroneous findings or of
persuading the Board to reinstate a canceled hearing on thebasis of new evidence is plainly insufficient to bridge the significant gap between the protection afforded by an unquali-fied right to annual hearings and the unreviewable discretion
of an administrative agency to dispense with such hearings.9

IV
Two final elements of the majority's opinion require com-ment. First, the majority suggests that a holding in respondent's favor would require that we "invalidate" an "end-less array of legislative adjustments," thus plunging the
judiciary into micromanagement of state parole procedures.Ante, at 508. The majority's fear is completely unfounded.
The provision of a parole hearing in California differs fromall of the matters set forth by the majority in one critical
way: It is an absolute prerequisite to release. For the threeyears in which respondent is denied his hearing, he is absolutely deprived of any parole opportunity. Though thechanges to which the majority refers might well make it
more difficult for prisoners to obtain release, none of themdeprives prisoners of the opportunity for release. Our cases

to deny parole and to delay a subsequent hearing for two years must be
the same.' " In re Jackson, 39 Cal. 3d, at 478, 703 P. 2d, at 109. Indeed,
in respondent's case, the findings on parole suitability and on the possibility of future parole are remarkably similar. The Board's findings on
which the majority relies so heavily thus seem of particularly questionable utility.

9 I find it somewhat ironic that the majority posits the existence of

nonstatutory, extraordinary remedies as a cure for legislation ostensibly
motivated entirely by an interest in administrative efficiency.

are absolutely clear that the retroactive deprivation of theopportunity for early release constitutes

ex post facto legislation. The majority's parade of hypothetical horribles iseasily distinguishable from the case before us, and it thus

provides no justification for diverging from our settled
approach.Second, the majority attempts to circumvent our

ex post
facto cases by characterizing the risk that the statute willactually increase any inmate's punishment as "speculative."

In my view, the speculation runs in the other direction.Under the present California parole procedures, there is no
possibility that an inmate will benefit from the 1981 amendment: Instead of an unqualified statutory right to an annual
hearing, the amendment leaves the inmate with no protection against either the risk of a mistaken prediction or the
risk that the Board may be influenced by its interest in curtailing its own workload. Moreover, the statute gives an
inmate no right to advance favorable changed circumstances
as a basis for a different result. Unlike the ex post facto
law condemned in Weaver, and also unlike the statutes approved in Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U. S. 282 (1977), and
Rooney v. North Dakota, 196 U. S. 319 (1905), the 1981
amendment contains no off-setting benefits for the inmate.
By postponing and reducing the number of parole hearings,
ostensibly for the sole purpose of cutting administrative
costs, the amendment will at best leave an inmate in the
same position he was in, and will almost inevitably delay the
grant of parole in some cases.

The Court concludes, nevertheless, that it is "speculative"
to say that the statute will increase inmates' punishment.
To draw such a conclusion, the Court "speculates" about the
accuracy of the Board's predictions, it "speculates" about the
parole suitability of a class of prisoners, it "speculates" about
the length of time that elapses between an eventual parole
hearing and the ultimate release date, and it "speculates"
as to the availability of procedures to deal with unexpected

punishment as "speculative" seems to me not only unpersua-sive, but actually perverse.

527OCTOBER TERM, 1994
Syllabus

UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 94-395. Argued February 22, 1995--Decided April 25, 1995
The Government assessed a tax against Jerrold Rabin and placed a lien

on all of his property, including his interest in the home he jointly owned
with respondent Lori Williams, his then-wife. Before the Government
recorded its lien, Rabin transferred his interest in the home to Williams,
as part of a division of assets in contemplation of divorce. Although
Williams was not personally liable for the tax, she paid it under protest
to remove the lien and sued for a refund under 28 U. S. C. $ 1346(a)(1),
which waives the Government's sovereign immunity from suit in "[a]ny
civil action . . . for the recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to
have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected." The Government responded that it was irrelevant whether the Government had a
right to Williams' money because she lacked standing to seek a refund
under $ 1346(a)(1). According to the Government, that provision authorizes refund actions only by the assessed party, i. e., Rabin. The
District Court accepted this jurisdictional argument, but the Court of
Appeals reversed.

Held: Section 1346(a)(1) authorizes a refund suit by a party who, though

not assessed a tax, paid the tax under protest to remove a federal tax
lien from her property. Pp. 531-541.

(a) Williams' plea falls squarely within $ 1346(a)(1)'s broad and unequivocal language authorizing suit for "any . . . tax . . . erroneously . . .
collected." Pp. 531-532.

(b) The Government's strained reliance on the interaction of three
other provisions to narrow $ 1346(a)(1)'s waiver of sovereign immunity
is rejected. The Government argues: Under 26 U. S. C. $ 7422, a party
may not bring a refund action without first exhausting administrative
remedies; under 26 U. S. C. $ 6511, only a "taxpayer" may exhaust; under
26 U. S. C. $ 7701(a)(14), Williams is not a taxpayer. The Government's
argument fails at two statutory junctures. First, the word "taxpayer"
in $ 6511(a)--the provision governing administrative claims--cannot
bear the weight the Government puts on it. This provision's plain
terms provide only a deadline for filing for administrative relief, not a
limit on who may file. Further, the Government's claim that Williams
is not at this point a "taxpayer" is unpersuasive. In placing a lien on
her home and then accepting the tax payment she made under protest,

514us2$51z 05-27-98 19:59:25 PAGES OPINBXPGT n
528 UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMS

Syllabus
the Government surely subjected Williams to a tax, even though she
was not the assessed party. Colorado Nat. Bank of Denver v. Bedford,
310 U. S. 41, 52, distinguished. Pp. 532-536.

(c) The Government's strained reading of $ 1346(a)(1) would leave
people in Williams' position without a remedy. This consequence reinforces the conclusion that Congress did not intend refund actions
under $ 1346(a)(1) to be unavailable to persons situated as Williams is.
Though the Government points to the levy, quiet title, and separate-fund
remedies authorized by 26 U. S. C. $ 7426, 28 U. S. C. $ 2410(a)(12), and
26 U. S. C. $ 6325(b)(3), respectively, none of those realistically would be
available to Williams or others in her situation. Moreover, because
those remedies offer predeprivation relief, they do not become superfluous if some third-party suits are authorized by $ 1346(a)(1), a postdeprivation remedy available only if the taxpayer has paid the Government in full. Pp. 536-538.

(d) The principle on which the Government relies, that parties generally may not challenge the tax liabilities of others, is not unyielding.
See, e. g., Stahmann v. Vidal, 305 U. S. 61. The burden on that principle is mitigated here because Williams' main challenge is to the existence of a lien against her property, rather than to the underlying assessment on her husband. Moreover, the Government's forecast that
allowing her to sue will lead to rampant abuse by parties volunteering
to pay others' taxes seems implausible. In any event, the disposition
herein does not address the circumstances, if any, under which a party
who volunteers to pay a tax assessed against someone else may seek a
refund under $ 1346(a). Pp. 538-540.

24 F. 3d 1143, affirmed.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents the question whether respondent LoriWilliams, who paid a tax under protest to remove a lien on

her property, has standing to bring a refund action under 28U. S. C. $ 1346(a)(1), even though the tax she paid was assessed against a third party. We hold that respondent hasstanding to sue for a refund. Respondent's suit falls within
the broad language of $ 1346(a)(1), which gives federal courtsjurisdiction to hear "[a]ny civil action against the United
States for the recovery of any internal-revenue tax allegedto have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected,"
and only a strained reading of other relevant provisionswould bar her suit. She had no realistic alternative to
payment of a tax she did not owe,1 and we do not believeCongress intended to leave parties in respondent's position
without a remedy. I

Before this litigation commenced, respondent Lori Wil-liams and her then-husband Jerrold Rabin jointly owned
their home. As part owner of a restaurant, Rabin person-ally incurred certain tax liabilities, which he failed to satisfy.
In June 1987 and March 1988, the Government assessedRabin close to $15,000 for these liabilities, and thereby placed
a lien in the assessed amount on all his property, includinghis interest in the house. See 26 U. S. C. $ 6321 ("If any person liable to pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay the sameafter demand, the amount . . . shall be a lien in favor of
the United States upon all property and rights to property,whether real or personal, belonging to such person."). The
Government has not alleged that Williams is personally lia-ble for these or any subsequent assessments.

1 Seeking summary disposition in the District Court, the Government
did not contend otherwise or question the District Court's understanding
that "the plaintiff here is left without a remedy." App. 22.

530 UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMS

Opinion of the Court
Meanwhile, Rabin and Williams divided their maritalproperty in contemplation of divorce. Williams did not have

notice of the lien when Rabin deeded his interest in thehouse to her on October 25, 1988, for the Government did
not file its tax lien until November 10, 1988. As consideration for the house, Williams assumed three liabilities forRabin (none of them tax liabilities) totaling almost $650,000.

App. 7-8 (Statement of Uncontroverted Facts presented byattorneys for United States). In the ensuing months, the
Government made further assessments on Rabin in excessof $26,000, but did not file notice of them until June 22, 1989.

Williams entered a contract on May 9, 1989, to sell the
house, and agreed to a closing date of July 3. Id., at 8. One
week before the closing, the Government gave actual notice
to Williams and the purchaser of over $41,000 in tax liens
which, it claimed, were valid against the property or proceeds of the sale. The purchaser threatened to sue Williams
if the sale did not go through on schedule. Believing she
had no realistic alternative--none having been suggested by
the Government--Williams, under protest, authorized disbursement of $41,937 from the sale proceeds directly to the
Internal Revenue Service so that she could convey clear title.

After the Government denied Williams' claim for an administrative refund, she filed suit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, claiming
she had taken the property free of the Government's lien
under 26 U. S. C. $ 6323(a) (absent proper notice, tax lien not
valid against purchaser). To enforce her rights, she invoked
28 U. S. C. $ 1346(a)(1), which waives the Government's sovereign immunity from suit by authorizing federal courts to
adjudicate "[a]ny civil action against the United States for
the recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to have
been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected." In a
trial on stipulated facts, the Government maintained that it
was irrelevant whether the Government had a right to Williams' money; her plea could not be entertained, the Govern514us2$51P 05-27-98 19:59:25 PAGES OPINBXPGT n

Opinion of the Court
ment insisted, because she lacked standing to seek a refundunder $ 1346(a)(1).

2 According to the Government, that provision authorizes actions only by the assessed party, i. e.,Rabin. The District Court accepted this jurisdictional argument, relying on precedent set in the Fifth and SeventhCircuits.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
reversed, 24 F. 3d 1143, 1145 (1994), guided by Fourth Circuitprecedent.

4 To resolve this conflict among the Courts of Appeals, we granted certiorari, 513 U. S. 959 (1994), and nowaffirm.

II
The question before us is whether the waiver of sovereign
immunity in $ 1346(a)(1) authorizes a refund suit by a partywho, though not assessed a tax, paid the tax under protest

to remove a federal tax lien from her property. In resolvingthis question, we may not enlarge the waiver beyond the
purview of the statutory language. Department of Energyv.

Ohio, 503 U. S. 607, 614-616 (1992). Our task is to discern
the "unequivocally expressed" intent of Congress, construing
ambiguities in favor of immunity. United States v. Nordic
Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 33 (1992) (internal quotation
marks omitted).To fathom the congressional instruction, we turn first to

the language of $ 1346(a). This provision does not say thatonly the person assessed may sue. Instead, the statute uses
broad language:

2 The dissent, perhaps finding unappealing the Government's defense of
unjustified taking, tenders factual inferences, post, at 545-546, both unfavorable to Williams and beyond the parties' stipulation of uncontroverted
facts. The sole issue in this case, however, is whether one in Williams'
situation has standing to sue for a refund, and to that issue the strength
of Williams' case on the merits is not relevant.

v. United States, 542 F. 2d 421, 425 (CA7 1976).

532 UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMS

Opinion of the Court
"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction,concurrent with the United States Court of Federal

Claims, of:"(1) Any civil action against the United States for the
recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to havebeen

erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, orany penalty claimed to have been collected without

authority or any sum alleged to have been excessive orin any manner wrongfully collected under the internalrevenue laws." 28 U. S. C. $ 1346(a) (1988 ed. and Supp.V) (emphasis added).

Williams' plea to recover a tax "erroneously . . . collected"falls squarely within this language.

The broad language of $ 1346(a)(1) mirrors the broadcommon-law remedy the statute displaced: actions of assumpsit for money had and received, once brought againstthe tax collector personally rather than against the United
States. See Ferguson, Jurisdictional Problems in FederalTax Controversies, 48 Iowa L. Rev. 312, 327 (1963). Assumpsit afforded a remedy to those who, like Williams, had paidmoney they did not owe--typically as a result of fraud, duress, or mistake. See H. Ballantine, Shipman on Common-Law Pleading 163-164 (3d ed. 1923). Assumpsit refund
actions were unavailable to volunteers, a limit that wouldnot have barred Williams because she paid under protest.
See Philadelphia v. Collector, 5 Wall. 720, 731-732 (1867)("Where the party voluntarily pays the money, he is without
remedy; but if he pays it by compulsion of law, or underprotest, or with notice that he intends to bring suit to test
the validity of the claim, he may recover it back . . . .").

III
Acknowledging the evident breadth of $ 1346(a)(1), theGovernment relies on the interaction of three other provisions to narrow the waiver of sovereign immunity. TheGovernment argues: Under 26 U. S. C. $ 7422, a party may

Opinion of the Court
not bring a refund action without first exhausting adminis-trative remedies; under 26 U. S. C. $ 6511, only a "taxpayer"

may exhaust; under 26 U. S. C. $ 7701(a)(14), Williams is nota taxpayer.

It is undisputed that $ 7422 requires administrative ex-haustion.

5 If Williams is eligible to exhaust, she did so by

filing an administrative claim. But to show that Williams isnot eligible to exhaust, the Government relies first on 26

U. S. C. $ 6511(a), which provides in part:

"(a) Period of limitation on filing claim
"Claim for credit or refund of an overpayment of anytax imposed by this title in respect of which tax the

taxpayer is required to file a return shall be filed by the
taxpayer within 3 years from the time the return wasfiled or 2 years from the time the tax was paid, whichever of such periods expires the later, or if no returnwas filed by the taxpayer, within 2 years from the time
the tax was paid." (Emphasis added.)
From the statute's use of the term "taxpayer," rather than"person who paid the tax," the Government concludes that

only a "taxpayer" may file for administrative relief under$ 7422, and thereafter pursue a refund action under 28
U. S. C. $ 1346(a)(1).6 Then, to show that Williams is not

5 Section 7422(a) provides in relevant part:
"No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recovery
of any internal revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally
assessed or collected, or of any penalty claimed to have been collected
without authority, or of any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any
manner wrongfully collected, until a claim for refund or credit has been
duly filed with the Secretary, according to the provisions of law in that
regard, and the regulations of the Secretary established in pursuance
thereof."

6 Title 26 U. S. C. $ 6532(a)(1), governing the time to file a refund suit in

court, reads in part:
"No suit or proceeding under section 7422(a) for the recovery of any internal revenue tax, penalty, or other sum, shall be begun before the expira514us2$51P 05-27-98 19:59:25 PAGES OPINBXPGT n
534 UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMS

Opinion of the Court
a "taxpayer," the Government relies on 26 U. S. C. $ 7701
(a)(14), which defines "taxpayer" as "any person subject to
any internal revenue tax." According to the Government, a
party who pays a tax is not "subject to" it unless she is the
one assessed.

The Government's argument fails at both statutory junctures. First, the word "taxpayer" in $ 6511(a)--the provision governing administrative claims--cannot bear the
weight the Government puts on it. This provision's plain
terms provide only a deadline for filing for administrative
relief,7 not a limit on who may file. To read the term "taxpayer" as implicitly limiting administrative relief to the
party assessed is inconsistent with other provisions of the
refund scheme, which expressly contemplate refunds to parties other than the one assessed. Thus, in authorizing the
Secretary to award a credit or refund "[i]n the case of any
overpayment," 26 U. S. C. $ 6402(a) describes the recipient
not as the "taxpayer," but as "the person who made the
overpayment." Similarly, in providing for credits and refunds for sales taxes and taxes on tobacco and alcohol, 26
U. S. C. $ 6416(a) and 26 U. S. C. $ 6419(a) describe the recipient as "the person who paid the tax."

tion of 6 months from the date of filing the claim required under such
section unless the Secretary renders a decision thereon within that time,
nor after the expiration of 2 years from the date of mailing by certified
mail or registered mail by the Secretary to the taxpayer of a notice of the
disallowance of the part of the claim to which the suit or proceeding
relates."

7 As a statute of limitations, $ 6511(a) does narrow the waiver of sovereign immunity in $ 1346(a)(1) by barring the tardy. See United States v.
Dalm, 494 U. S. 596, 602 (1990) ("Read together, the import of these sections [$$ 1346(a)(1), 7422(a), 6511(a)] is clear: unless a claim for refund of a
tax has been filed within the time limits imposed by $ 6511(a), a suit for
refund, regardless of whether the tax is alleged to have been `erroneously,'
`illegally,' or `wrongfully collected,' $$ 1346(a)(1), 7422(a), may not be maintained in any court.").

535Cite as: 514 U. S. 527 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
Further, even if, as the Government contends, only "tax-payers" could seek administrative relief under $ 6511, the

Government's claim that Williams is not at this point a"taxpayer" is unpersuasive. Section 7701(a)(14), defining
"taxpayer," informs us that "[w]hen used in [the InternalRevenue Code], where not otherwise distinctly expressed or
manifestly incompatible with the intent thereof, . . . [t]heterm `taxpayer' means any person subject to any internal
revenue tax." 8 That definition does not exclude Williams.The Government reads the definition as if it said "any person
who is assessed any internal revenue tax," but these are notCongress' words. The general phrase "subject to" is
broader than the specific phrase "assessed" and, in the taxcollection context before us, we think it is broad enough to
include Williams. In placing a lien on her home and thenaccepting her tax payment under protest, the Government
surely subjected Williams to a tax, even though she was notthe assessed party.

In support of its reading of "taxpayer," the Governmentcites our observation in Colorado Nat. Bank of Denver v.
Bedford, 310 U. S. 41, 52 (1940), that "[t]he taxpayer is theperson ultimately liable for the tax itself." The Government
takes this language out of context. We were not interpret-ing the term "taxpayer" in the Internal Revenue Code, but
deciding whether a state tax scheme was consistent with fed-eral law. In particular, we were determining whether Colorado had imposed its service tax on a bank's customers(which was consistent with federal law) or on the bank itself
(which was not). Though the bank collected and paid thetax, its incidence fell on the customers. Favoring substance
over form, we said: "The person liable for the tax [the bank],primarily, cannot always be said to be the real taxpayer.

8 The Treasury's regulation, 26 CFR $ 301.7701-16 (1994), adds nothing
to the statute; in particular, the regulation does not ascribe any special or
limiting meaning to the statute's "subject to" terminology.

Opinion of the Court
The taxpayer is the person ultimately liable for the tax it-self." Ibid. As a result, we determined that the tax had

been imposed on the customers rather than the bank. IfColorado Nat. Bank is relevant at all, it shows our preference for commonsense inquiries over formalism--a prefer-ence that works against the Government's technical argument in this case. IV

As we have just developed, 28 U. S. C. $ 1346(a)(1) clearlyallows one from whom taxes are erroneously or illegally collected to sue for a refund of those taxes. And 26 U. S. C.$ 6402(a), with similar clarity, authorizes the Secretary to pay
out a refund to "the person who made the overpayment."The Government's strained reading of $ 1346(a)(1), we note,
would leave people in Williams' position without a remedy.See

supra, at 529, n. 1. This consequence reinforces ourconclusion that Congress did not intend refund actions under

$ 1346(a)(1) to be unavailable to persons situated as Lori Wil-liams is. Though the Government points to three other
remedies, none was realistically open to Williams. Norwould any of the vaunted remedies be available to others in
her situation. See, e. g., Martin v. United States, 895 F. 2d992 (CA4 1990);

Barris v. United States, 851 F. Supp. 696(WD Pa. 1994);
Brodey v. United States, 788 F. Supp. 44(Mass. 1991) (all ordering refunds of amounts erroneously

collected to the people who paid those amounts).If the Government has not levied on property--as it has
not levied on Williams' home--the owner cannot challengesuch a levy under 26 U. S. C. $ 7426. Nor would an action
under 28 U. S. C. $ 2410(a)(1) to quiet title afford meaningfulrelief to someone in Williams' position. The first lien on her
property, for nearly $15,000, was filed just six months beforethe closing; and liens in larger sum--over $26,000, out of
$41,937--were filed only 11 days before the closing. (Wil-liams did not receive actual notice of

any of the liens untilbarely a week before the closing.) She simply did not have

537Cite as: 514 U. S. 527 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
time to bring a quiet title action. She urgently sought to
sell the property, but a sale would have been difficult before
a final judgment in such litigation, which could have been
protracted. In contrast, a refund suit would allow her to
sell the property and simultaneously pay off the lien, leaving
her free to litigate with the Government without tying up
her real property, whose worth far exceeded the value of the
Government's liens.

Nor may Williams and persons similarly situated rely on

$ 6325(b)(3) for such an arrangement. This provision permits the Government to discharge a lien on property if the
owner sets aside a fund that becomes subject to a new lien;
the parties then can litigate the propriety of the new lien
after the property is sold. However, $ 6325(b)(3) and its implementing regulation render this remedy doubtful indeed,
for it is available only at the Government's discretion. See

$ 6325(b)(3) ("[T]he Secretary may issue a certificate of discharge [of a federal tax lien] of any part of the property subject to the lien if such part of the property is sold and, pursuant to an agreement with the Secretary, the proceeds of such
sale are to be held, as a fund subject to the liens and claims
of the United States, in the same manner and with the same
priority as such liens and claims had with respect to the discharged property.") (emphasis added); 26 CFR $ 301.6325-
1(b)(3) (1994) ("A district director [of the Internal Revenue
Service] may, in his discretion, issue a certificate of discharge of any part of the property subject to a [tax lien] if
such part of the property is sold and, pursuant to a written
agreement with the district director, the proceeds of the sale
are held, as a fund subject to the liens and claims of the
United States, in the same manner and with the same priority as the lien or claim had with respect to the discharged
property.") (emphasis added).

So far as the record shows, the Government did not afford
Williams an opportunity to substitute a fund pursuant to

538 UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMS

Opinion of the Court

$ 6325(b)(3).9 This omission is not surprising, for on theGovernment's theory of who may sue under $ 1346(a)(1),

the Government had scant incentive to agree to such anarrangement with people caught in Williams' bind. Under

$ 6325(b)(3), the Government does not receive cash, but an-other lien (albeit one on a fund). In contrast, if the Government resists a $ 6325(b)(3) agreement, it is likely to get cashimmediately: property owners eager to remove a tax lien will
have to pay, as did Williams. If they may not sue under$ 1346(a)(1), their payment is nonrefundable. An agreement
pursuant to $ 6325(b)(3) thus dependent on the district direc-tor's grace cannot sensibly be described as available to
Williams.We do not agree with the Government that, if $ 1346(a)(1)
authorizes some third-party suits, the levy, quiet title,and separate-fund remedies become superfluous. Section
1346(a)(1) is a postdeprivation remedy, available only if thetaxpayer has paid the Government in full. Flora v. United
States, 362 U. S. 145 (1960). The other remedies offerpredeprivation relief. The levy provision in 26 U. S. C.

Likewise, 28 U. S. C. $ 2410 allows a property owner to havea lien discharged without ever paying the tax. Under 26

the Government's discretion.

Opinion of the Court
the tax liabilities of others. According to the Government,
undermining this principle will lead to widespread abuse: In
particular, parties will volunteer to pay the tax liabilities of
others, only to seek a refund once the Government has
ceased collecting from the real taxpayer.

Although parties generally may not challenge the tax liabilities of others, this rule is not unyielding. A taxpayer's
fiduciary may litigate the taxpayer's liability, even though
the fiduciary is not herself liable. See 26 CFR $ 301.6903-
1(a) (1994) (the fiduciary must "assume the powers, rights,
duties, and privileges of the taxpayer with respect to the
taxes imposed by the Code"); ibid. ("The amount of the tax
or liability is ordinarily not collectible from the personal estate of the fiduciary but is collectible from the estate of the
taxpayer . . . ."); 15 J. Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation $ 58.08 (1994) (refund claims for decedents filed by executor, administrator, or other fiduciary of estate). Similarly,
certain transferees may litigate the tax liabilities of the
transferor; if the transfer qualifies as a fraudulent conveyance under state law, the Code treats the transferee as the
taxpayer, see 26 U. S. C. $ 6901(a)(1)(A); 5 J. Rabkin & M.
Johnson, Federal Income, Gift and Estate Taxation $ 73.10,
pp. 73-82 to 73-87 (1992), so the transferee may contest the
transferor's liability either in tax court, see 14 Mertens,
supra, $ 53.50, or in a refund suit under $ 1346(a)(1). See id.,

$ 53.55. Furthermore, the Court has allowed a refund action by parties who were not assessed, albeit under a different statute. See Stahmann v. Vidal, 305 U. S. 61 (1938) (cotton producers could bring a refund action for a federal cotton
ginning tax if they had paid the tax, even though the tax
was assessed against ginners rather than producers).

The burden on the principle that a party may not challenge
the tax liability of another is mitigated, moreover, because
Williams' main challenge is to the existence of a lien against
her property, rather than to the underlying assessment on

Opinion of the Court
her husband. That is, her primary claim is not that her husband never owed the tax 10--a matter that, had she not paid
these taxes herself under the duress of a lien, would not normally be her concern. Rather, she asserts that the Government has attached a lien on the wrong property, because the
house belongs to her rather than to him--a scenario which
leaves her "subject to" the tax in a meaningful and immediate way.

We do not find disarming the Government's forecast that
allowing Williams to sue will lead to rampant abuse. The
Government's posited scenario seems implausible; it is not
clear what incentive a volunteer has to pay someone else's
taxes as a way to help that person evade them. Nor does
the Government report that such schemes are commonplace
among the millions of taxpayers in the Fourth and Ninth
Circuits, Circuits that permit persons in Williams' position
to bring refund suits. Furthermore, our holding does not
authorize the host of third-party challenges the Government
fears. Williams paid under protest, solely to gain release of
the Government's lien on her property--a lien she attacked
as erroneously maintained. We do not decide the circumstances, if any, under which a party who volunteers to pay a
tax assessed against someone else may seek a refund under

$ 1346(a).

10 On motion for summary judgment in District Court, Williams did challenge her husband's liability as well. See Plaintiff's Notice of Motion and
Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment 13. However, counsel retreated
from this claim at oral argument. Tr. of Oral Arg. 36 ("We're not arguing
that she's going to go into court and litigate the liability of her exhusband."); id., at 37 ("[W]e're not saying that she wa[nts] [to] go into
court and litigate his tax liability. That's his problem, not hers."). Moreover, to affirm the Ninth Circuit's judgment, we can rely solely on Williams' standing to challenge the lien, regardless of whether she has standing to challenge the underlying assessment on her husband. Accordingly,
we need not resolve whether Williams is still asserting her challenge to
the underlying assessment, let alone whether she has standing to do so.

* * *
The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals forthe Ninth Circuit is

Affirmed.
Justice Scalia, concurring.
I join the opinion of the Court, except insofar as it holdsthat Williams is a "taxpayer" within the meaning of 26

U. S. C. $$ 6511(a) and 7701(a)(14), see ante, at 534-536.That seems to me unnecessary to the decision, since

$ 6511(a), an administrative exhaustion provision, has too re-mote a bearing upon $ 1346(a)(1), the jurisdictional provision
at issue, to create by implication the significant limitationupon jurisdiction that the Government asserts.

I acknowledge the rule requiring clear statement of waiv-ers of sovereign immunity, see

post, at 544 (dissenting opin-ion), and I agree that the rule applies even to determination

of the scope of explicit waivers. See, e. g., United States v.
Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 34 (1992). The rule doesnot, however, require explicit waivers to be given a meaning

that is implausible--which would in my view be the result ofrestricting the unequivocal language of $ 1346(a)(1) by reference to $ 6511(a). " `The exemption of the sovereign fromsuit involves hardship enough where consent has been withheld. We are not to add to its rigor by refinement of con-struction where consent has been announced.' "

UnitedStates v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 338 U. S. 366, 383

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

The Court, in an unusual departure from the bedrock prin-ciple that waivers of sovereign immunity must be "unequivocally expressed," holds that respondent may sue for a refundof a tax which was not assessed against her. In so doing, it

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
outlines in some detail what it conceives to be the equitiesof respondent's situation--a factor not usually of great significance in construing the Internal Revenue Code. I be-lieve that the Court's picture of the equities is misleadingly
inaccurate, and that its effort to stretch the law to avoid
these perceived inequities is quite contrary to establisheddoctrine.

The legal question at hand is whether the Government haswaived its sovereign immunity in 28 U. S. C. $ 1346(a)(1) to
authorize respondent, who conceded that she "is not thetaxpayer," App. 16, to file a refund suit. In answering
that question, it must be remembered that $ 1346(a)(1) is "ajurisdictional provision which is a keystone in a carefully
articulated and quite complicated structure of tax laws."
Flora v. United States, 362 U. S. 145, 157 (1960). Section"1346(a)(1) must be read in conformity with other statutory

provisions [26 U. S. C. $$ 7422(a) and 6511(a)] which qualifya taxpayer's right to bring a refund suit."

United States
v. Dalm, 494 U. S. 596, 601-602 (1990).Section 1346(a)(1) provides:

"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction,concurrent with the United States Court of Federal
Claims, of:"(1) Any civil action against the United States for the
recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to havebeen erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or
any penalty claimed to have been collected without
authority or any sum alleged to have been excessive orin any manner wrongfully collected under the internalrevenue laws." 28 U. S. C. $ 1346(a)(1) (1988 ed. and
Supp V).

The jurisdiction conferred by $ 1346(a)(1) is limited by 26
U. S. C. $ 7422(a). Like $ 1346(a)(1), $ 7422(a) contains no
language limiting a refund suit to the "taxpayer," but its
"express language . . . conditions a district court's authority

to hear a refund suit." Dalm, supra, at 609, n. 6. It re-quires that "a claim for refund or credit [first be] filed with

the Secretary, according to the provisions of law in that re-gard." 26 U. S. C. $ 7422(a). There are two "provisions of
law" dealing with such claims. Title 26 U. S. C. $ 6511(a)provides in part that a

"[c]laim for credit or refund of an overpayment of anytax imposed by this title in respect of which tax the
taxpayer is required to file a return shall be filed by the
taxpayer within 3 years from the time the return wasfiled or 2 years from the time the tax was paid." (Emphasis added.)
Title 26 U. S. C. $ 6532(a), which imposes a period of limita-tions on suits for refunds in court and is entitled "Suits by

taxpayers for refund," states that

"[n]o suit or proceeding under section 7422(a) . . . shallbe begun before the expiration of 6 months from the

date of filing the claim required under such section . . . ,nor after the expiration of 2 years from the date of mailing by certified mail or registered mail by the Secretaryto the

taxpayer of a notice of the disallowance" (empha-sis added).

Both $$ 6511(a) and 6532(a) clearly are limited to the "tax-payer," and the term "taxpayer" is in turn defined in

$ 7701(a)(14) to mean "any person subject to any internal rev-enue tax." Reading these provisions as a whole, the conclusion is inescapable that only a "taxpayer" ($ 7701(a)(14)) whohas filed a timely claim for refund (under $ 6511(a)) and a
timely suit for refund (under $ 6532(a)) is authorized to main-tain a suit for refund in any court ($ 7422(a)) for an "erroneously or illegally assessed or collected" tax (28 U. S. C.$ 1346(a)(1)).

The Court describes 26 U. S. C. $ 6511(a) as providing "onlya deadline for filing for administrative relief, not a limit
on who may file." Ante, at 534. But the "plain terms" of

514us2$51H 05-27-98 19:59:25 PAGES OPINBXPGT n
544 UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMS

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting

$ 6511(a), ibid., do impose such a limit--a refund claim maybe filed only "by the taxpayer." The Court discounts the

notion that the term "taxpayer" limits administrative reliefto the party assessed by concluding that such a construction
"is inconsistent with other provisions of the refund scheme."
Ibid. The "other provisions" cited by the Court, however,are in no way inconsistent with the above construction of

$ 6511(a): the fact that the Secretary is authorized to re-fund any overpayment to "the person who made the overpayment," $ 6402(a), or to "the person who paid the tax,"$$ 6416(a), 6419(a), does not mean that such a person may
bring suit if she disagrees with the Secretary's calculation of
the amount of the overpayment. And even if such an inconsistency did exist, an "inconsistency" is not enough to carry
the day when dealing with a waiver of sovereign immunity;
"inconsistency" simply means ambiguity, and because a
waiver of sovereign immunity must be " `unequivocally expressed,' " any ambiguity is construed in favor of immunity.
United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 33 (1992).

The Court proceeds to argue that, even if only "taxpayers"
could seek administrative relief under $ 6511, respondent
qualifies as a "taxpayer." Ante, at 535. That term is
defined in the Code as "any person subject to any internal
revenue tax." $ 7701(a)(14). The Court says this phrase
is "broad enough to include [respondent]" because the Government "place[d] a lien on her home and then accept[ed]
her tax payment." Ante, at 535. This is remarkably imprecise reasoning.

Respondent was subjected to a tax lien, but this does not
mean she was "subject to any internal revenue tax" in the
normal sense of that phrase as used in the Code. The tax
was assessed against Rabin, not respondent, and respondent
has equivocated as to whether she is simply challenging the
lien or also challenging Rabin's underlying tax assessment.
The underlying tax, and the lien to enforce liability for that
tax, are obviously two different things. One may have a tax

545Cite as: 514 U. S. 527 (1995)
Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
assessed against him, and if he pays it in a timely manner hewill never be subject to a lien. Conversely, one against

whom the tax was not assessed may nonetheless be subjectto a lien to enforce collection of that tax. The Court says it
will decide here only the challenge to the lien, thereby leaving the tax totally unchallenged in this proceeding. Ante,at 539-540, and n. 10. This is quite contrary to the language

quoted above, which allows only the person "subject to anyinternal revenue

tax" to file the claim for refund which is the
necessary prerequisite for bringing a refund suit under$ 1346(a)(1).

The Court believes its position is reinforced by its conclusion that respondent is left without a remedy if she cannot
bring a refund suit under $ 1346(a)(1). Equities ordinarily
do not assume such a dominant role when dealing with questions of sovereign immunity, but if they are to play that role,
the equities ought to be those which can be confirmed on the
record before us.

The undisputed facts of record which evoke the Court's
sympathy are these. Rabin and respondent owned the property in question as joint tenants. In June 1987, and in
March 1988, the Government made federal employment tax
assessments totaling nearly $15,000 against Rabin. A federal tax lien securing the taxes and interest owed by Rabin
arose "at the time the assessment [was] made," 26 U. S. C.

$ 6322, and reached "all property and rights to property,
whether real or personal, belonging to" Rabin at that time.

$ 6321. In October 1988, Rabin and respondent entered into
a "transfer agreement," whereby Rabin agreed to convey his
interest in the property to respondent and to indemnify her
for the payment of any liens on the property. Rabin transferred his interest in the property to respondent by executing a quitclaim deed. The deed, recorded nearly three
months before any divorce proceedings had commenced, described respondent as " `an unmarried woman.' " App. 14.
This misrepresentation--stating that respondent was " `an

546 UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMS

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
unmarried woman' " at the time of the transfer--raises thequestion whether the property was conveyed to respondent

"in contemplation of divorce," as the Court says, ante, at 530,or whether it was done in an attempt to shield Rabin's assets
from the tax lien. In November 1988, the Government recorded notice of the federal tax lien. Respondent com-menced divorce proceedings against Rabin in January 1989,

and in May 1989, while the divorce petition was pending,respondent entered into an agreement to sell the property.
In June 1989, the Government filed notice of additional taxliens, including a lien in respondent's name as nominee,
agent, alter ego, and holder of a beneficial interest in the
property for Rabin. The closing date for the sale of the
property was July 3, 1989.

Respondent thus faced a situation not uncommon to those
who seek to transfer a clear title to real property: Her property was subject to federal tax liens. But despite the
Court's suggestion to the contrary, respondent clearly had
available to her at least two remedies. She could have
brought an action to "quiet title" under 28 U. S. C.

$ 2410(a)(1), or she could have sought from the Secretary a
"certificate of discharge" of the property under 26 U. S. C.

$ 6325(b)(3).

The Court, relying on respondent's bald assertion that she
had no notice of the liens until the week before the closing,
concludes that a quiet title action under $ 2410(a) would not
have afforded respondent meaningful relief because only "a
refund suit would allow her to sell the property and simultaneously pay off the lien, leaving her free to litigate with the
Government without tying up her real property." Ante, at
537. This simply begs the question. Obviously, a quiet
title action brought at the time respondent agreed to sell the
property could not have proceeded to judgment before the
closing date, but that is true of lawsuits to quiet title against
all sorts of other liens that may prevent the conveyance of
clear title. The existence of outstanding liens on property

547Cite as: 514 U. S. 527 (1995)
Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
is a fact of life, and heretofore lienors--least of all the UnitedStates--have not been required to afford the legal equivalent

of "same day service" to finally adjudicate title before theclosing date.

Respondent was not left only with the remedy of a quiet
title action; she could have sought from the Secretary a "cer-tificate of discharge" of the property under 26 U. S. C.

$ 6325(b)(3) by agreeing to hold the proceeds of the sale ofthe property "as a fund subject to the liens and claims of the
United States," with the propriety of the liens to be litigatedin a subsequent action under $ 7426(a)(3). The Court finds
this remedy inadequate because it was a "doubtful" remedy
upon which respondent could not "rely," since the certificate
of discharge could issue only in the exercise of the Secretary's discretion. Ante, at 537. That the Secretary must
exercise discretion does not make $ 6325(b)(3) a "doubtful"
remedy. Congress appropriately granted the Secretary discretion to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether the
proceeds from the sale of property will be sufficient to protect the Government's tax lien. And because the worth of
respondent's property "far exceeded the value of the Government's liens," ibid., the Secretary most likely would have
issued a certificate of discharge in this case. But respondent
never sought to invoke this remedy, and the cases are legion
holding that a person may not claim an administrative remedy was inadequate if she never sought to invoke it. See,
e. g., McGee v. United States, 402 U. S. 479, 483 (1971) (a Selective Service registrant may not complain in court if the
registrant "has failed to pursue normal administrative remedies and thus has sidestepped a corrective process which
might have cured or rendered moot the very defect later
complained of "); Geo. F. Alger Co. v. Peck, 74 S. Ct. 605, 606-
607, 98 L. Ed. 1148, 1150 (1954) (Reed, J., in chambers) (a
company may not complain in court when it failed to take
advantage of an available administrative remedy, even
though that remedy may "cause inconvenience and ex514us2$51H 05-27-98 19:59:25 PAGES OPINBXPGT n

pense"); cf. McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U. S. 140, 145 (1992)(exhaustion of administrative remedies "appl[ies] with particular force when the action under review involves exercise ofthe agency's discretionary power or when the agency proceedings in question allow the agency to apply its specialexpertise") (citing

McKart v. United States, 395 U. S. 185,194 (1969)).

To make a bad matter worse, the Court faults the Govern-ment for not "afford[ing respondent] an opportunity" to pursue this remedy. Ante, at 537. This makes one wonderwhether we are entering an era where internal revenue
agents must give warnings to delinquent taxpayers and lien-ees analogous to the warnings required in criminal cases by
our decision in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966).Certainly the Court has never so held before, and one may
hope that it would not so hold in the future. Indeed, sincerespondent concedes in her brief that the Government was
not required to tell her about the discretionary relief avail-able, Brief for Respondent 20, it is surprising to see the
Court suggest to the contrary.If this case involved the interpretation of a statute designed to confer new benefits or rights upon a class of indi-viduals, today's decision would be more understandable,
since such a statute would be "entitled to a liberal construc-tion to accomplish its beneficent purposes." Cosmopolitan
Shipping Co. v. McAllister, 337 U. S. 783 (1949) (construingthe Jones Act); see also

Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Buell,480 U. S. 557, 562 (1987) (stating that the Federal Employers'

Liability Act is a "broad remedial statute" which must begiven a " `liberal construction' "). But it would surely come
as news to the millions of taxpayers in this country that theInternal Revenue Code has a "beneficent purpose" as far as
they are concerned. It does not, and the Court is mistakento decide this case in a way that can only be justified if it
does.

UNITED STATES v. LOPEZ
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 93-1260. Argued November 8, 1994--Decided April 26, 1995
After respondent, then a 12th-grade student, carried a concealed handgun

into his high school, he was charged with violating the Gun-Free School
Zones Act of 1990, which forbids "any individual knowingly to possess
a firearm at a place that [he] knows . . . is a school zone," 18 U. S. C.

$ 922(q)(1)(A). The District Court denied his motion to dismiss the indictment, concluding that $ 922(q) is a constitutional exercise of Congress' power to regulate activities in and affecting commerce. In reversing, the Court of Appeals held that, in light of what it characterized
as insufficient congressional findings and legislative history, $ 922(q) is
invalid as beyond Congress' power under the Commerce Clause.

Held: The Act exceeds Congress' Commerce Clause authority. First, although this Court has upheld a wide variety of congressional Acts regulating intrastate economic activity that substantially affected interstate
commerce, the possession of a gun in a local school zone is in no sense an
economic activity that might, through repetition elsewhere, have such a
substantial effect on interstate commerce. Section 922(q) is a criminal
statute that by its terms has nothing to do with "commerce" or any sort
of economic enterprise, however broadly those terms are defined. Nor
is it an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which
the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity
were regulated. It cannot, therefore, be sustained under the Court's
cases upholding regulations of activities that arise out of or are connected with a commercial transaction, which, viewed in the aggregate,
substantially affects interstate commerce. Second, $ 922(q) contains no
jurisdictional element that would ensure, through case-by-case inquiry,
that the firearms possession in question has the requisite nexus with
interstate commerce. Respondent was a local student at a local school;
there is no indication that he had recently moved in interstate commerce, and there is no requirement that his possession of the firearm
have any concrete tie to interstate commerce. To uphold the Government's contention that $ 922(q) is justified because firearms possession
in a local school zone does indeed substantially affect interstate commerce would require this Court to pile inference upon inference in a
manner that would bid fair to convert congressional Commerce Clause

Opinion of the Court
Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.

In the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, Congress madeit a federal offense "for any individual knowingly to possess
a firearm at a place that the individual knows, or hasreasonable cause to believe, is a school zone." 18 U. S. C.

$ 922(q)(1)(A) (1988 ed., Supp. V). The Act neither regulatesa commercial activity nor contains a requirement that the
possession be connected in any way to interstate commerce.
We hold that the Act exceeds the authority of Congress "[t]oregulate Commerce . . . among the several States . . . ."

U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3.On March 10, 1992, respondent, who was then a 12th-grade
student, arrived at Edison High School in San Antonio,Texas, carrying a concealed .38-caliber handgun and five bullets. Acting upon an anonymous tip, school authorities con-fronted respondent, who admitted that he was carrying the
weapon. He was arrested and charged under Texas law
with firearm possession on school premises. See Tex. Penal

A federal grand jury indicted respondent on one count of

of $ 922(q). Respondent moved to dismiss his federal indictment on the ground that $ 922(q) "is unconstitutional as it is
beyond the power of Congress to legislate control over our

Cert. 55a. Respondent waived his right to a jury trial.The District Court conducted a bench trial, found him guilty
of violating $ 922(q), and sentenced him to six months' imprisonment and two years' supervised release.On appeal, respondent challenged his conviction based on

his claim that $ 922(q) exceeded Congress' power to legislateunder the Commerce Clause. The Court of Appeals for the
Fifth Circuit agreed and reversed respondent's conviction.It held that, in light of what it characterized as insufficient
congressional findings and legislative history, "section 922(q),
in the full reach of its terms, is invalid as beyond the power
of Congress under the Commerce Clause." 2 F. 3d 1342,
1367-1368 (1993). Because of the importance of the issue,
we granted certiorari, 511 U. S. 1029 (1994), and we now
affirm.

We start with first principles. The Constitution creates a
Federal Government of enumerated powers. See Art. I, $ 8.
As James Madison wrote: "The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and
defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite." The Federalist No. 45,
pp. 292-293 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). This constitutionally
mandated division of authority "was adopted by the Framers
to ensure protection of our fundamental liberties." Gregory
v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 458 (1991) (internal quotation
marks omitted). "Just as the separation and independence
of the coordinate branches of the Federal Government serve
to prevent the accumulation of excessive power in any one
branch, a healthy balance of power between the States and
the Federal Government will reduce the risk of tyranny and
abuse from either front." Ibid.

The Constitution delegates to Congress the power "[t]o
regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the
several States, and with the Indian Tribes." Art. I, $ 8,

Opinion of the Court
cl. 3. The Court, through Chief Justice Marshall, first de-fined the nature of Congress' commerce power in Gibbons

v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 189-190 (1824):

"Commerce, undoubtedly, is traffic, but it is somethingmore: it is intercourse. It describes the commercial

intercourse between nations, and parts of nations, inall its branches, and is regulated by prescribing rules
for carrying on that intercourse."
The commerce power "is the power to regulate; that is, toprescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed.

This power, like all others vested in congress, is complete initself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed in theconstitution."

Id., at 196. The Gibbons Court, however,acknowledged that limitations on the commerce power are

inherent in the very language of the Commerce Clause.

"It is not intended to say that these words compre-hend that commerce, which is completely internal, which

is carried on between man and man in a State, or be-tween different parts of the same State, and which does
not extend to or affect other States. Such a powerwould be inconvenient, and is certainly unnecessary.

"Comprehensive as the word `among' is, it may veryproperly be restricted to that commerce which concerns
more States than one. . . . The enumeration presupposessomething not enumerated; and that something, if we
regard the language, or the subject of the sentence, mustbe the exclusively internal commerce of a State."

Id.,at 194-195.

For nearly a century thereafter, the Court's CommerceClause decisions dealt but rarely with the extent of Congress' power, and almost entirely with the Commerce Clauseas a limit on state legislation that discriminated against interstate commerce. See, e. g., Veazie v. Moor, 14 How. 568,573-575 (1853) (upholding a state-created steamboat monop514us3$52H 05-27-98 16:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT

oly because it involved regulation of wholly internal com-merce);

Kidd v. Pearson, 128 U. S. 1, 17, 20-22 (1888) (upholding a state prohibition on the manufacture of intoxicat-ing liquor because the commerce power "does not comprehend the purely internal domestic commerce of a State which
is carried on between man and man within a State or be-tween different parts of the same State"); see also L. Tribe,

American Constitutional Law 306 (2d ed. 1988). Under thisline of precedent, the Court held that certain categories of
activity such as "production," "manufacturing," and "min-ing" were within the province of state governments, and
thus were beyond the power of Congress under the Commerce Clause. See Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111,
121 (1942) (describing development of Commerce Clause
jurisprudence).

In 1887, Congress enacted the Interstate Commerce Act,
24 Stat. 379, and in 1890, Congress enacted the Sherman Antitrust Act, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U. S. C. $ 1 et seq.
These laws ushered in a new era of federal regulation under
the commerce power. When cases involving these laws first
reached this Court, we imported from our negative Commerce Clause cases the approach that Congress could not
regulate activities such as "production," "manufacturing,"
and "mining." See, e. g., United States v. E. C. Knight Co.,
156 U. S. 1, 12 (1895) ("Commerce succeeds to manufacture,
and is not part of it"); Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S.
238, 304 (1936) ("Mining brings the subject matter of commerce into existence. Commerce disposes of it"). Simultaneously, however, the Court held that, where the interstate
and intrastate aspects of commerce were so mingled together that full regulation of interstate commerce required
incidental regulation of intrastate commerce, the Commerce
Clause authorized such regulation. See, e. g., Shreveport
Rate Cases, 234 U. S. 342 (1914).

In A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295
U. S. 495, 550 (1935), the Court struck down regulations that

Opinion of the Court
fixed the hours and wages of individuals employed by an in-trastate business because the activity being regulated related to interstate commerce only indirectly. In doing so,the Court characterized the distinction between direct and
indirect effects of intrastate transactions upon interstatecommerce as "a fundamental one, essential to the maintenance of our constitutional system." Id., at 548. Activitiesthat affected interstate commerce directly were within Congress' power; activities that affected interstate commerceindirectly were beyond Congress' reach.

Id., at 546. Thejustification for this formal distinction was rooted in the fear

that otherwise "there would be virtually no limit to the fed-eral power and for all practical purposes we should have a
completely centralized government." Id., at 548.Two years later, in the watershed case of

NLRB v. Jones &Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1 (1937), the Court upheld the

National Labor Relations Act against a Commerce Clausechallenge, and in the process, departed from the distinction
between "direct" and "indirect" effects on interstate com-merce.

Id., at 36-38 ("The question [of the scope of Con-gress' power] is necessarily one of degree"). The Court held

that intrastate activities that "have such a close and substan-tial relation to interstate commerce that their control is
essential or appropriate to protect that commerce fromburdens and obstructions" are within Congress' power to
regulate. Id., at 37.In

United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100 (1941), the Courtupheld the Fair Labor Standards Act, stating:

"The power of Congress over interstate commerce is notconfined to the regulation of commerce among the
states. It extends to those activities intrastate whichso affect interstate commerce or the exercise of the
power of Congress over it as to make regulation of themappropriate means to the attainment of a legitimate end,
the exercise of the granted power of Congress to regu-late interstate commerce." Id., at 118.

Opinion of the Court
See also United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co., 315 U. S.110, 119 (1942) (the commerce power "extends to those intrastate activities which in a substantial way interfere with orobstruct the exercise of the granted power").

In Wickard v. Filburn, the Court upheld the application
of amendments to the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938to the production and consumption of homegrown wheat.

317 U. S., at 128-129. The Wickard Court explicitly re-jected earlier distinctions between direct and indirect effects
on interstate commerce, stating:

"[E]ven if appellee's activity be local and though it may
not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever itsnature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial

economic effect on interstate commerce, and this irre-spective of whether such effect is what might at some
earlier time have been defined as `direct' or `indirect.' "
Id., at 125.

The Wickard Court emphasized that although Filburn's owncontribution to the demand for wheat may have been trivial

by itself, that was not "enough to remove him from the scopeof federal regulation where, as here, his contribution, taken
together with that of many others similarly situated, is farfrom trivial."

Id., at 127-128.
Jones & Laughlin Steel, Darby, and Wickard ushered in
an era of Commerce Clause jurisprudence that greatly ex-panded the previously defined authority of Congress under

that Clause. In part, this was a recognition of the greatchanges that had occurred in the way business was carried
on in this country. Enterprises that had once been local or
at most regional in nature had become national in scope.
But the doctrinal change also reflected a view that earlier
Commerce Clause cases artificially had constrained the authority of Congress to regulate interstate commerce.

But even these modern-era precedents which have expanded congressional power under the Commerce Clause

Opinion of the Court
confirm that this power is subject to outer limits. In
Jones & Laughlin Steel, the Court warned that the scope of
the interstate commerce power "must be considered in the
light of our dual system of government and may not be extended so as to embrace effects upon interstate commerce so
indirect and remote that to embrace them, in view of our
complex society, would effectually obliterate the distinction
between what is national and what is local and create a completely centralized government." 301 U. S., at 37; see also
Darby, supra, at 119-120 (Congress may regulate intrastate
activity that has a "substantial effect" on interstate commerce); Wickard, supra, at 125 (Congress may regulate activity that "exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate
commerce"). Since that time, the Court has heeded that
warning and undertaken to decide whether a rational basis
existed for concluding that a regulated activity sufficiently
affected interstate commerce. See, e. g., Hodel v. Virginia
Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264,
276-280 (1981); Perez v. United States, 402 U. S. 146, 155-156
(1971); Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294, 299-301 (1964);
Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241,
252-253 (1964).2

Similarly, in Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183 (1968), the
Court reaffirmed that "the power to regulate commerce,
though broad indeed, has limits" that "[t]he Court has ample
power" to enforce. Id., at 196, overruled on other grounds,
National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833 (1976),
overruled by Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit

does not necessarily make it so") (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment);
Heart of Atlanta Motel, 379 U. S., at 273 ("[W]hether particular operations
affect interstate commerce sufficiently to come under the constitutional
power of Congress to regulate them is ultimately a judicial rather than a
legislative question, and can be settled finally only by this Court") (Black,

558 UNITED STATES v. LOPEZ

Opinion of the Court
Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985). In response to the dissent'swarnings that the Court was powerless to enforce the limitations on Congress' commerce powers because "[a]ll activitiesaffecting commerce, even in the minutest degree,

[Wickard],
may be regulated and controlled by Congress," 392 U. S., at
204 (Douglas, J., dissenting), the Wirtz Court replied thatthe dissent had misread precedent as "[n]either here nor in

Wickard has the Court declared that Congress may use arelatively trivial impact on commerce as an excuse for broad
general regulation of state or private activities," id., at 197,n. 27. Rather, "[t]he Court has said only that where

a general regulatory statute bears a substantial relation to commerce, the de minimis character of individual instances arising under that statute is of no consequence." Ibid. (first
emphasis added).

Consistent with this structure, we have identified three
broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate
under its commerce power. Perez, supra, at 150; see also
Hodel, supra, at 276-277. First, Congress may regulate the
use of the channels of interstate commerce. See, e. g.,
Darby, 312 U. S., at 114; Heart of Atlanta Motel, supra, at
256 (" `[T]he authority of Congress to keep the channels of
interstate commerce free from immoral and injurious uses
has been frequently sustained, and is no longer open to question' " (quoting Caminetti v. United States, 242 U. S. 470, 491
(1917))). Second, Congress is empowered to regulate and
protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the
threat may come only from intrastate activities. See, e. g.,
Shreveport Rate Cases, 234 U. S. 342 (1914); Southern R. Co.
v. United States, 222 U. S. 20 (1911) (upholding amendments
to Safety Appliance Act as applied to vehicles used in intrastate commerce); Perez, supra, at 150 ("[F]or example, the
destruction of an aircraft (18 U. S. C. $ 32), or . . . thefts from
interstate shipments (18 U. S. C. $ 659)"). Finally, Congress'
commerce authority includes the power to regulate those ac514us3$52H 05-27-98 16:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT

559Cite as: 514 U. S. 549 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
tivities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce,
Jones & Laughlin Steel, 301 U. S., at 37, i. e., those activities
that substantially affect interstate commerce, Wirtz, supra,at 196, n. 27.

Within this final category, admittedly, our case law has not
been clear whether an activity must "affect" or "substan-tially affect" interstate commerce in order to be within

Congress' power to regulate it under the Commerce Clause.Compare

Preseault v. ICC, 494 U. S. 1, 17 (1990), with Wirtz,
supra, at 196, n. 27 (the Court has never declared that "Con-gress may use a relatively trivial impact on commerce as

an excuse for broad general regulation of state or private
activities"). We conclude, consistent with the great weight
of our case law, that the proper test requires an analysis of
whether the regulated activity "substantially affects" interstate commerce.

We now turn to consider the power of Congress, in the
light of this framework, to enact $ 922(q). The first two categories of authority may be quickly disposed of: $ 922(q) is not
a regulation of the use of the channels of interstate commerce, nor is it an attempt to prohibit the interstate transportation of a commodity through the channels of commerce;
nor can $ 922(q) be justified as a regulation by which Congress has sought to protect an instrumentality of interstate
commerce or a thing in interstate commerce. Thus, if

$ 922(q) is to be sustained, it must be under the third category as a regulation of an activity that substantially affects
interstate commerce.

First, we have upheld a wide variety of congressional Acts
regulating intrastate economic activity where we have concluded that the activity substantially affected interstate
commerce. Examples include the regulation of intrastate
coal mining; Hodel, supra, intrastate extortionate credit
transactions, Perez, supra, restaurants utilizing substantial
interstate supplies, McClung, supra, inns and hotels catering
to interstate guests, Heart of Atlanta Motel, supra, and pro514us3$52H 05-27-98 16:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
duction and consumption of homegrown wheat, Wickard v.Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942). These examples are by no

means exhaustive, but the pattern is clear. Where economicactivity substantially affects interstate commerce, legislation
regulating that activity will be sustained.Even

Wickard, which is perhaps the most far reaching ex-ample of Commerce Clause authority over intrastate activity,

involved economic activity in a way that the possession of agun in a school zone does not. Roscoe Filburn operated a
small farm in Ohio, on which, in the year involved, he raised23 acres of wheat. It was his practice to sow winter wheat
in the fall, and after harvesting it in July to sell a portion ofthe crop, to feed part of it to poultry and livestock on the
farm, to use some in making flour for home consumption,and to keep the remainder for seeding future crops. The
Secretary of Agriculture assessed a penalty against himunder the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 because he
harvested about 12 acres more wheat than his allotmentunder the Act permitted. The Act was designed to regulate
the volume of wheat moving in interstate and foreign com-merce in order to avoid surpluses and shortages, and concomitant fluctuation in wheat prices, which had previouslyobtained. The Court said, in an opinion sustaining the application of the Act to Filburn's activity:

"One of the primary purposes of the Act in question wasto increase the market price of wheat and to that end to

limit the volume thereof that could affect the market.It can hardly be denied that a factor of such volume and
variability as home-consumed wheat would have a sub-stantial influence on price and market conditions. This
may arise because being in marketable condition suchwheat overhangs the market and, if induced by rising
prices, tends to flow into the market and check priceincreases. But if we assume that it is never marketed,
it supplies a need of the man who grew it which wouldotherwise be reflected by purchases in the open market.

Opinion of the Court
Home-grown wheat in this sense competes with wheatin commerce." 317 U. S., at 128.

Section 922(q) is a criminal statute that by its terms hasnothing to do with "commerce" or any sort of economic
enterprise, however broadly one might define those terms.3Section 922(q) is not an essential part of a larger regulation
of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme couldbe undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated.
It cannot, therefore, be sustained under our cases upholdingregulations of activities that arise out of or are connected
with a commercial transaction, which viewed in the aggre-gate, substantially affects interstate commerce.

Second, $ 922(q) contains no jurisdictional element whichwould ensure, through case-by-case inquiry, that the firearm
possession in question affects interstate commerce. For ex-ample, in

United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336 (1971), theCourt interpreted former 18 U. S. C. $ 1202(a), which made it

3 Under our federal system, the " `States possess primary authority for
defining and enforcing the criminal law.' " Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507
U. S. 619, 635 (1993) (quoting Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 128 (1982)); see
also Screws v. United States, 325 U. S. 91, 109 (1945) (plurality opinion)
("Our national government is one of delegated powers alone. Under our
federal system the administration of criminal justice rests with the States
except as Congress, acting within the scope of those delegated powers,
has created offenses against the United States"). When Congress criminalizes conduct already denounced as criminal by the States, it effects
a " `change in the sensitive relation between federal and state criminal
jurisdiction.' " United States v. Enmons, 410 U. S. 396, 411-412 (1973)
(quoting United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 349 (1971)). The Government acknowledges that $ 922(q) "displace[s] state policy choices in . . . that
its prohibitions apply even in States that have chosen not to outlaw the
conduct in question." Brief for United States 29, n. 18; see also Statement of President George Bush on Signing the Crime Control Act of 1990,

Opinion of the Court
a crime for a felon to "receiv[e], posses[s], or transpor[t] incommerce or affecting commerce . . . any firearm." 404

U. S., at 337. The Court interpreted the possession compo-nent of $ 1202(a) to require an additional nexus to interstate
commerce both because the statute was ambiguous and because "unless Congress conveys its purpose clearly, it willnot be deemed to have significantly changed the federal-state

balance." Id., at 349. The Bass Court set aside the convic-tion because, although the Government had demonstrated
that Bass had possessed a firearm, it had failed "to showthe requisite nexus with interstate commerce."

Id., at 347.
The Court thus interpreted the statute to reserve the constitutional question whether Congress could regulate, without
more, the "mere possession" of firearms. See id., at 339,
n. 4; see also United States v. Five Gambling Devices, 346
U. S. 441, 448 (1953) (plurality opinion) ("The principle is old
and deeply imbedded in our jurisprudence that this Court
will construe a statute in a manner that requires decision of
serious constitutional questions only if the statutory language leaves no reasonable alternative"). Unlike the statute in Bass, $ 922(q) has no express jurisdictional element
which might limit its reach to a discrete set of firearm possessions that additionally have an explicit connection with or
effect on interstate commerce.

Although as part of our independent evaluation of constitutionality under the Commerce Clause we of course consider legislative findings, and indeed even congressional committee findings, regarding effect on interstate commerce,
see, e. g., Preseault v. ICC, 494 U. S., at 17, the Government
concedes that "[n]either the statute nor its legislative history
contain[s] express congressional findings regarding the effects upon interstate commerce of gun possession in a school
zone." Brief for United States 5-6. We agree with the
Government that Congress normally is not required to make
formal findings as to the substantial burdens that an activity
has on interstate commerce. See McClung, 379 U. S., at 304;

Opinion of the Court
see also Perez, 402 U. S., at 156 ("Congress need [not] makeparticularized findings in order to legislate"). But to the

extent that congressional findings would enable us to evalu-ate the legislative judgment that the activity in question
substantially affected interstate commerce, even though nosuch substantial effect was visible to the naked eye, they are
lacking here.4The Government argues that Congress has accumulated
institutional expertise regarding the regulation of firearmsthrough previous enactments. Cf.

Fullilove v. Klutznick,448 U. S. 448, 503 (1980) (Powell, J., concurring). We agree,

however, with the Fifth Circuit that importation of previousfindings to justify $ 922(q) is especially inappropriate here
because the "prior federal enactments or Congressionalfindings [do not] speak to the subject matter of section 922(q)
or its relationship to interstate commerce. Indeed, section922(q) plows thoroughly new ground and represents a sharp
break with the long-standing pattern of federal firearms leg-islation." 2 F. 3d, at 1366.

The Government's essential contention, in fine, is that wemay determine here that $ 922(q) is valid because possession
of a firearm in a local school zone does indeed substantiallyaffect interstate commerce. Brief for United States 17.
The Government argues that possession of a firearm in aschool zone may result in violent crime and that violent
crime can be expected to affect the functioning of the na-tional economy in two ways. First, the costs of violent

4 We note that on September 13, 1994, President Clinton signed into law
the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L.
103-322, 108 Stat. 1796. Section 320904 of that Act, id., at 2125, amends

$ 922(q) to include congressional findings regarding the effects of firearm
possession in and around schools upon interstate and foreign commerce.
The Government does not rely upon these subsequent findings as a substitute for the absence of findings in the first instance. Tr. of Oral Arg. 25
("[W]e're not relying on them in the strict sense of the word, but we think
that at a very minimum they indicate that reasons can be identified for
why Congress wanted to regulate this particular activity").

Opinion of the Court
crime are substantial, and, through the mechanism of insur-ance, those costs are spread throughout the population. See

United States v. Evans, 928 F. 2d 858, 862 (CA9 1991). Sec-ond, violent crime reduces the willingness of individuals to
travel to areas within the country that are perceived to be
unsafe. Cf. Heart of Atlanta Motel, 379 U. S., at 253. TheGovernment also argues that the presence of guns in schools

poses a substantial threat to the educational process bythreatening the learning environment. A handicapped educational process, in turn, will result in a less productive citi-zenry. That, in turn, would have an adverse effect on the
Nation's economic well-being. As a result, the Government
argues that Congress could rationally have concluded that

$ 922(q) substantially affects interstate commerce.

We pause to consider the implications of the Government's
arguments. The Government admits, under its "costs of
crime" reasoning, that Congress could regulate not only all
violent crime, but all activities that might lead to violent
crime, regardless of how tenuously they relate to interstate
commerce. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 8-9. Similarly, under the
Government's "national productivity" reasoning, Congress
could regulate any activity that it found was related to the
economic productivity of individual citizens: family law (including marriage, divorce, and child custody), for example.
Under the theories that the Government presents in support
of $ 922(q), it is difficult to perceive any limitation on federal
power, even in areas such as criminal law enforcement or
education where States historically have been sovereign.
Thus, if we were to accept the Government's arguments, we
are hard pressed to posit any activity by an individual that
Congress is without power to regulate.

Although Justice Breyer argues that acceptance of the
Government's rationales would not authorize a general federal police power, he is unable to identify any activity that
the States may regulate but Congress may not. Justice
Breyer posits that there might be some limitations on Con514us3$52H 05-27-98 16:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT

when viewed in light of the dissent's expansive analysis, aredevoid of substance.

Justice Breyer focuses, for the most part, on the threat
that firearm possession in and near schools poses to the edu-cational process and the potential economic consequences

flowing from that threat. Post, at 619-624. Specifically,the dissent reasons that (1) gun-related violence is a serious
problem; (2) that problem, in turn, has an adverse effect onclassroom learning; and (3) that adverse effect on classroom
learning, in turn, represents a substantial threat to trade and
commerce. Post, at 623. This analysis would be equally
applicable, if not more so, to subjects such as family law and
direct regulation of education.

For instance, if Congress can, pursuant to its Commerce
Clause power, regulate activities that adversely affect the
learning environment, then, a fortiori, it also can regulate
the educational process directly. Congress could determine
that a school's curriculum has a "significant" effect on the
extent of classroom learning. As a result, Congress could
mandate a federal curriculum for local elementary and secondary schools because what is taught in local schools has a
significant "effect on classroom learning," cf. ibid., and that,
in turn, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.

Justice Breyer rejects our reading of precedent and argues that "Congress . . . could rationally conclude that
schools fall on the commercial side of the line." Post, at 629.
Again, Justice Breyer's rationale lacks any real limits because, depending on the level of generality, any activity can
be looked upon as commercial. Under the dissent's rationale, Congress could just as easily look at child rearing as
"fall[ing] on the commercial side of the line" because it provides a "valuable service--namely, to equip [children] with
the skills they need to survive in life and, more specifically,
in the workplace." Ibid. We do not doubt that Congress

Opinion of the Court
has authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate nu-merous commercial activities that substantially affect interstate commerce and also affect the educational process.That authority, though broad, does not include the authority
to regulate each and every aspect of local schools.

Admittedly, a determination whether an intrastate activityis commercial or noncommercial may in some cases result

in legal uncertainty. But, so long as Congress' authority islimited to those powers enumerated in the Constitution, and
so long as those enumerated powers are interpreted as hav-ing judicially enforceable outer limits, congressional legislation under the Commerce Clause always will engender "legaluncertainty."

Post, at 630. As Chief Justice Marshall
stated in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819):

"Th[e] [federal] government is acknowledged by all to
be one of enumerated powers. The principle, that it canexercise only the powers granted to it . . . is now universally admitted. But the question respecting the extent
of the powers actually granted, is perpetually arising,and will probably continue to arise, as long as our system shall exist." Id., at 405.
See also Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 195 ("The enumera-tion presupposes something not enumerated"). The Constitution mandates this uncertainty by withholding from Congress a plenary police power that would authorize enactmentof every type of legislation. See Art. I, $ 8. Congress has

operated within this framework of legal uncertainty eversince this Court determined that it was the Judiciary's duty
"to say what the law is." Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch
137, 177 (1803) (Marshall, C. J.). Any possible benefit from
eliminating this "legal uncertainty" would be at the expense
of the Constitution's system of enumerated powers.

In Jones & Laughlin Steel, 301 U. S., at 37, we held that
the question of congressional power under the Commerce
Clause "is necessarily one of degree." To the same effect

Opinion of the Court
is the concurring opinion of Justice Cardozo in Schechter
Poultry:

"There is a view of causation that would obliterate thedistinction between what is national and what is local in

the activities of commerce. Motion at the outer rim iscommunicated perceptibly, though minutely, to recording instruments at the center. A society such as ours`is an elastic medium which transmits all tremors
throughout its territory; the only question is of theirsize.' " 295 U. S., at 554 (quoting

United States v.
A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp., 76 F. 2d 617, 624 (CA2
1935) (L. Hand, J., concurring)).

These are not precise formulations, and in the nature ofthings they cannot be. But we think they point the way to

a correct decision of this case. The possession of a gun in a
local school zone is in no sense an economic activity thatmight, through repetition elsewhere, substantially affect any

sort of interstate commerce. Respondent was a local stu-dent at a local school; there is no indication that he had recently moved in interstate commerce, and there is no re-quirement that his possession of the firearm have any
concrete tie to interstate commerce.To uphold the Government's contentions here, we would
have to pile inference upon inference in a manner that would
bid fair to convert congressional authority under the Com-merce Clause to a general police power of the sort retained

by the States. Admittedly, some of our prior cases havetaken long steps down that road, giving great deference to
congressional action. See supra, at 556-558. The broad
language in these opinions has suggested the possibility of
additional expansion, but we decline here to proceed any further. To do so would require us to conclude that the Constitution's enumeration of powers does not presuppose something not enumerated, cf. Gibbons v. Ogden, supra, at 195,
and that there never will be a distinction between what is

truly national and what is truly local, cf. Jones & Laughlin
Steel, supra, at 30. This we are unwilling to do.

For the foregoing reasons the judgment of the Court ofAppeals is

Affirmed.
Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice O'Connor joins,
concurring.

The history of the judicial struggle to interpret the Commerce Clause during the transition from the economic sys-tem the Founders knew to the single, national market still

emergent in our own era counsels great restraint before theCourt determines that the Clause is insufficient to support
an exercise of the national power. That history gives mesome pause about today's decision, but I join the Court's
opinion with these observations on what I conceive to be its
necessary though limited holding.

Chief Justice Marshall announced that the national authority reaches "that commerce which concerns more States than
one" and that the commerce power "is complete in itself, may
be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed in the constitution." Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 194, 196 (1824). His statements
can be understood now as an early and authoritative recognition that the Commerce Clause grants Congress extensive
power and ample discretion to determine its appropriate exercise. The progression of our Commerce Clause cases from
Gibbons to the present was not marked, however, by a coherent or consistent course of interpretation; for neither the
course of technological advance nor the foundational principles for the jurisprudence itself were self-evident to the
courts that sought to resolve contemporary disputes by enduring principles.

Furthermore, for almost a century after the adoption of
the Constitution, the Court's Commerce Clause decisions did
not concern the authority of Congress to legislate. Rather,

Kennedy, J., concurring
the Court faced the related but quite distinct question of theauthority of the States to regulate matters that would be

within the commerce power had Congress chosen to act.The simple fact was that in the early years of the Republic,
Congress seldom perceived the necessity to exercise its
power in circumstances where its authority would be calledinto question. The Court's initial task, therefore, was to

elaborate the theories that would permit the States to actwhere Congress had not done so. Not the least part of the
problem was the unresolved question whether the congres-sional power was exclusive, a question reserved by Chief
Justice Marshall in Gibbons v. Ogden, supra, at 209-210.

At the midpoint of the 19th century, the Court embraced
the principle that the States and the National Government
both have authority to regulate certain matters absent the
congressional determination to displace local law or the necessity for the Court to invalidate local law because of the
dormant national power. Cooley v. Board of Wardens of
Port of Philadelphia ex rel. Soc. for Relief of Distressed
Pilots, 12 How. 299, 318-321 (1852). But the utility of that
solution was not at once apparent, see generally F. Frankfurter, The Commerce Clause under Marshall, Taney and
Waite (1937) (hereinafter Frankfurter), and difficulties of
application persisted, see Leisy v. Hardin, 135 U. S. 100,
122-125 (1890).

One approach the Court used to inquire into the lawfulness
of state authority was to draw content-based or subjectmatter distinctions, thus defining by semantic or formalistic
categories those activities that were commerce and those
that were not. For instance, in deciding that a State could
prohibit the in-state manufacture of liquor intended for outof-state shipment, it distinguished between manufacture and
commerce. "No distinction is more popular to the common
mind, or more clearly expressed in economic and political
literature, than that between manufactur[e] and commerce.
Manufacture is transformation--the fashioning of raw mate514us3$52L 05-27-98 16:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT

rials into a change of form for use. The functions of commerce are different." Kidd v. Pearson, 128 U. S. 1, 20
(1888). Though that approach likely would not have survived even if confined to the question of a State's authority
to enact legislation, it was not at all propitious when applied
to the quite different question of what subjects were within
the reach of the national power when Congress chose to
exercise it.

This became evident when the Court began to confront
federal economic regulation enacted in response to the rapid
industrial development in the late 19th century. Thus, it
relied upon the manufacture-commerce dichotomy in United
States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U. S. 1 (1895), where a manufacturers' combination controlling some 98% of the Nation's
domestic sugar refining capacity was held to be outside the
reach of the Sherman Act. Conspiracies to control manufacture, agriculture, mining, production, wages, or prices, the
Court explained, had too "indirect" an effect on interstate
commerce. Id., at 16. And in Adair v. United States, 208
U. S. 161 (1908), the Court rejected the view that the commerce power might extend to activities that, although local
in the sense of having originated within a single State, nevertheless had a practical effect on interstate commercial activity. The Court concluded that there was not a "legal or
logical connection . . . between an employe' 's membership in
a labor organization and the carrying on of interstate commerce," id., at 178, and struck down a federal statute forbidding the discharge of an employee because of his membership
in a labor organization. See also The Employers' Liability
Cases, 207 U. S. 463, 497 (1908) (invalidating statute creating
negligence action against common carriers for personal injuries of employees sustained in the course of employment,
because the statute "regulates the persons because they
engage in interstate commerce and does not alone regulate
the business of interstate commerce").

Kennedy, J., concurring
Even before the Court committed itself to sustainingfederal legislation on broad principles of economic practicality, it found it necessary to depart from these decisions.The Court disavowed

E. C. Knight's reliance on the
manufacturing-commerce distinction in Standard Oil Co. of
N. J. v. United States, 221 U. S. 1, 68-69 (1911), declaringthat approach "unsound." The Court likewise rejected the

rationale of Adair when it decided, in Texas & New Orleans
R. Co. v. Railway Clerks, 281 U. S. 548, 570-571 (1930), that
Congress had the power to regulate matters pertaining tothe organization of railroad workers.

In another line of cases, the Court addressed Congress'
efforts to impede local activities it considered undesirable by
prohibiting the interstate movement of some essential element. In the Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321 (1903), the Court
rejected the argument that Congress lacked power to prohibit the interstate movement of lottery tickets because it
had power only to regulate, not to prohibit. See also Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, 220 U. S. 45 (1911); Hoke v.
United States, 227 U. S. 308 (1913). In Hammer v. Dagenhart, 247 U. S. 251 (1918), however, the Court insisted that
the power to regulate commerce "is directly the contrary of
the assumed right to forbid commerce from moving," id., at
269-270, and struck down a prohibition on the interstate
transportation of goods manufactured in violation of child
labor laws.

Even while it was experiencing difficulties in finding satisfactory principles in these cases, the Court was pursuing a
more sustainable and practical approach in other lines of decisions, particularly those involving the regulation of railroad
rates. In the Minnesota Rate Cases, 230 U. S. 352 (1913),
the Court upheld a state rate order, but observed that Congress might be empowered to regulate in this area if "by
reason of the interblending of the interstate and intrastate
operations of interstate carriers" the regulation of interstate
rates could not be maintained without restrictions on "intra514us3$52L 05-27-98 16:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT

Kennedy, J., concurring
state rates which substantially affect the former." Id., at432-433. And in the

Shreveport Rate Cases, 234 U. S. 342
(1914), the Court upheld an Interstate Commerce Commis-sion order fixing railroad rates with the explanation that congressional authority, "extending to these interstate carriers
as instruments of interstate commerce, necessarily embracesthe right to control their operations in all matters having

such a close and substantial relation to interstate traffic thatthe control is essential or appropriate to the security of that
traffic, to the efficiency of the interstate service, and to themaintenance of conditions under which interstate commerce
may be conducted upon fair terms and without molestation
or hindrance." Id., at 351.

Even the most confined interpretation of "commerce"
would embrace transportation between the States, so the
rate cases posed much less difficulty for the Court than cases
involving manufacture or production. Nevertheless, the
Court's recognition of the importance of a practical conception of the commerce power was not altogether confined to
the rate cases. In Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U. S.
375 (1905), the Court upheld the application of federal antitrust law to a combination of meat dealers that occurred in
one State but that restrained trade in cattle "sent for sale
from a place in one State, with the expectation that they will
end their transit . . . in another." Id., at 398. The Court
explained that "commerce among the States is not a technical
legal conception, but a practical one, drawn from the course
of business." Ibid. Chief Justice Taft followed the same
approach in upholding federal regulation of stockyards in
Stafford v. Wallace, 258 U. S. 495 (1922). Speaking for the
Court, he rejected a "nice and technical inquiry," id., at 519,
when the local transactions at issue could not "be separated
from the movement to which they contribute," id., at 516.

Reluctance of the Court to adopt that approach in all of its
cases caused inconsistencies in doctrine to persist, however.
In addressing New Deal legislation the Court resuscitated

the abandoned abstract distinction between direct and indi-rect effects on interstate commerce. See

Carter v. Carter
Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238, 309 (1936) (Act regulating price ofcoal and wages and hours for miners held to have only "secondary and indirect" effect on interstate commerce); Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Alton R. Co., 295 U. S. 330, 368 (1935)(compulsory retirement and pension plan for railroad carrier

employees too "remote from any regulation of commerce assuch");

A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States,
295 U. S. 495, 548 (1935) (wage and hour law provision ofNational Industrial Recovery Act had "no direct relation to

interstate commerce").

The case that seems to mark the Court's definitive commitment to the practical conception of the commerce power is
NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1 (1937),
where the Court sustained labor laws that applied to manufacturing facilities, making no real attempt to distinguish
Carter, supra, and Schechter, supra. 301 U. S., at 40-41.
The deference given to Congress has since been confirmed.
United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 116-117 (1941),
overruled Hammer v. Dagenhart, supra. And in Wickard
v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942), the Court disapproved
E. C. Knight and the entire line of direct-indirect and
manufacture-production cases, explaining that "broader interpretations of the Commerce Clause [were] destined to supersede the earlier ones," 317 U. S., at 122, and "[w]hatever
terminology is used, the criterion is necessarily one of
degree and must be so defined. This does not satisfy those
who seek mathematical or rigid formulas. But such formulas are not provided by the great concepts of the Constitution," id., at 123, n. 24. Later examples of the exercise of
federal power where commercial transactions were the subject of regulation include Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v.
United States, 379 U. S. 241 (1964), Katzenbach v. McClung,
379 U. S. 294 (1964), and Perez v. United States, 402 U. S. 146

of the Court's practical conception of commercial regulationand are not called in question by our decision today.

The history of our Commerce Clause decisions contains atleast two lessons of relevance to this case. The first, as
stated at the outset, is the imprecision of content-basedboundaries used without more to define the limits of the
Commerce Clause. The second, related to the first but ofeven greater consequence, is that the Court as an institution
and the legal system as a whole have an immense stake inthe stability of our Commerce Clause jurisprudence as it has
evolved to this point. Stare decisis operates with greatforce in counseling us not to call in question the essential
principles now in place respecting the congressional powerto regulate transactions of a commercial nature. That fundamental restraint on our power forecloses us from revertingto an understanding of commerce that would serve only an
18th-century economy, dependent then upon production andtrading practices that had changed but little over the preceding centuries; it also mandates against returning to the timewhen congressional authority to regulate undoubted commercial activities was limited by a judicial determinationthat those matters had an insufficient connection to an interstate system. Congress can regulate in the commercialsphere on the assumption that we have a single market and
a unified purpose to build a stable national economy.In referring to the whole subject of the federal and state
balance, we said this just three Terms ago:

"This framework has been sufficiently flexible overthe past two centuries to allow for enormous changes

in the nature of government. The Federal Governmentundertakes activities today that would have been unimaginable to the Framers in two senses: first, becausethe Framers would not have conceived that any government would conduct such activities; and second, becausethe Framers would not have believed that the Federal
Government, rather than the States, would assume such

responsibilities. Yet the powers conferred upon theFederal Government by the Constitution were phrased

in language broad enough to allow for the expansion ofthe Federal Government's role." New York v. United
States, 505 U. S. 144, 157 (1992) (emphasis deleted).
It does not follow, however, that in every instance the Courtlacks the authority and responsibility to review congressional attempts to alter the federal balance. This case re-quires us to consider our place in the design of the Government and to appreciate the significance of federalism in thewhole structure of the Constitution.

Of the various structural elements in the Constitution,separation of powers, checks and balances, judicial review,
and federalism, only concerning the last does there seem tobe much uncertainty respecting the existence, and the content, of standards that allow the Judiciary to play a signifi-cant role in maintaining the design contemplated by the
Framers. Although the resolution of specific cases hasproved difficult, we have derived from the Constitution
workable standards to assist in preserving separation ofpowers and checks and balances. See,

e. g., Prize Cases, 2Black 635 (1863); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,

343 U. S. 579 (1952); United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683(1974);

Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976); INS v. Chadha,462 U. S. 919 (1983); Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714 (1986);

Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., ante, p. 211. These stand-ards are by now well accepted. Judicial review is also established beyond question, Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch137 (1803), and though we may differ when applying its principles, see, e. g., Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v.
Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992), its legitimacy is undoubted. Ourrole in preserving the federal balance seems more tenuous.

There is irony in this, because of the four structural ele-ments in the Constitution just mentioned, federalism was the
unique contribution of the Framers to political science andpolitical theory. See Friendly, Federalism: A Foreword, 86

surface the idea may seem counterintuitive, it was the in-sight of the Framers that freedom was enhanced by the creation of two governments, not one. "In the compound republic of America, the power surrendered by the people isfirst divided between two distinct governments, and then the

portion allotted to each subdivided among distinct and sepa-rate departments. Hence a double security arises to the
rights of the people. The different governments will controleach other, at the same time that each will be controlled by
itself." The Federalist No. 51, p. 323 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961)
(J. Madison). See also Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452,
458-459 (1991) ("Just as the separation and independence of
the coordinate branches of the Federal Government serve to
prevent the accumulation of excessive power in any one
branch, a healthy balance of power between the States and
the Federal Government will reduce the risk of tyranny and
abuse from either front. . . . In the tension between federal
and state power lies the promise of liberty"); New York v.
United States, supra, at 181 ("[T]he Constitution divides authority between federal and state governments for the protection of individuals. State sovereignty is not just an end
in itself: `Rather, federalism secures to citizens the liberties
that derive from the diffusion of sovereign power' ") (quoting
Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 759 (1991) (Blackmun,
J., dissenting)).

The theory that two governments accord more liberty
than one requires for its realization two distinct and discernable lines of political accountability: one between the citizens
and the Federal Government; the second between the citizens and the States. If, as Madison expected, the Federal
and State Governments are to control each other, see The
Federalist No. 51, and hold each other in check by competing
for the affections of the people, see The Federalist No. 46,
those citizens must have some means of knowing which of

the two governments to hold accountable for the failure toperform a given function. "Federalism serves to assign political responsibility, not to obscure it." FTC v. Ticor Title
Ins. Co., 504 U. S. 621, 636 (1992). Were the Federal Government to take over the regulation of entire areas of traditional state concern, areas having nothing to do with theregulation of commercial activities, the boundaries between

the spheres of federal and state authority would blur andpolitical responsibility would become illusory. Cf.

New York
v. United States, supra, at 155-169; FERC v. Mississippi,456 U. S. 742, 787 (1982) (

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). The resultant inability
to hold either branch of the government answerable to the
citizens is more dangerous even than devolving too much authority to the remote central power.

To be sure, one conclusion that could be drawn from The
Federalist Papers is that the balance between national and
state power is entrusted in its entirety to the political process. Madison's observation that "the people ought not
surely to be precluded from giving most of their confidence
where they may discover it to be most due," The Federalist
No. 46, p. 295 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961), can be interpreted to
say that the essence of responsibility for a shift in power
from the State to the Federal Government rests upon a political judgment, though he added assurance that "the State
governments could have little to apprehend, because it is
only within a certain sphere that the federal power can, in
the nature of things, be advantageously administered," ibid.
Whatever the judicial role, it is axiomatic that Congress does
have substantial discretion and control over the federal
balance.

For these reasons, it would be mistaken and mischievous
for the political branches to forget that the sworn obligation
to preserve and protect the Constitution in maintaining the
federal balance is their own in the first and primary instance.

S. 1732 before the Senate Committee on Commerce, 88thCong., 1st Sess., pts. 1-3 (1963), some Congresses have accepted responsibility to confront the great questions of the
proper federal balance in terms of lasting consequences forthe constitutional design. The political branches of the Government must fulfill this grave constitutional obligation ifdemocratic liberty and the federalism that secures it are to
endure.At the same time, the absence of structural mechanisms to
require those officials to undertake this principled task, and
the momentary political convenience often attendant upon
their failure to do so, argue against a complete renunciation
of the judicial role. Although it is the obligation of all officers of the Government to respect the constitutional design,
see Public Citizen v. Department of Justice, 491 U. S. 440,
466 (1989); Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U. S. 57, 64 (1981), the
federal balance is too essential a part of our constitutional
structure and plays too vital a role in securing freedom for
us to admit inability to intervene when one or the other level
of Government has tipped the scales too far.

In the past this Court has participated in maintaining the
federal balance through judicial exposition of doctrines such
as abstention, see, e. g., Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37
(1971); Railroad Comm'n of Tex. v. Pullman Co., 312 U. S.

at 568-574. "This clause has throughout the Court's historybeen the chief source of its adjudications regarding federalism," and "no other body of opinions affords a fairer or morerevealing test of judicial qualities." Frankfurter 66-67.
But as the branch whose distinctive duty it is to declare"what the law is,"

Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch, at 177, we
are often called upon to resolve questions of constitutional
law not susceptible to the mechanical application of bright
and clear lines. The substantial element of political judgment in Commerce Clause matters leaves our institutional
capacity to intervene more in doubt than when we decide
cases, for instance, under the Bill of Rights even though clear
and bright lines are often absent in the latter class of disputes. See County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 630
(1989) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment) ("We cannot avoid the obligation to draw lines,
often close and difficult lines" in adjudicating constitutional
rights). But our cases do not teach that we have no role at
all in determining the meaning of the Commerce Clause.

Our position in enforcing the dormant Commerce Clause
is instructive. The Court's doctrinal approach in that area
has likewise "taken some turns." Oklahoma Tax Comm'n
v. Jefferson Lines, Inc., ante, at 180. Yet in contrast to the
prevailing skepticism that surrounds our ability to give
meaning to the explicit text of the Commerce Clause, there
is widespread acceptance of our authority to enforce the dormant Commerce Clause, which we have but inferred from
the constitutional structure as a limitation on the power of
the States. One element of our dormant Commerce Clause
jurisprudence has been the principle that the States may not

impose regulations that place an undue burden on interstatecommerce, even where those regulations do not discriminate

between in-state and out-of-state businesses. See BrownForman Distillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Authority, 476 U. S. 573, 579 (1986) (citing Pike v. Bruce Church,
Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 142 (1970)). Distinguishing between reg-ulations that do place an undue burden on interstate commerce and regulations that do not depends upon delicatejudgments. True, if we invalidate a state law, Congress can
in effect overturn our judgment, whereas in a case announc-ing that Congress has transgressed its authority, the decision
is more consequential, for it stands unless Congress can revise its law to demonstrate its commercial character. This
difference no doubt informs the circumspection with which
we invalidate an Act of Congress, but it does not mitigate
our duty to recognize meaningful limits on the commerce
power of Congress.

The statute before us upsets the federal balance to a degree that renders it an unconstitutional assertion of the commerce power, and our intervention is required. As The
Chief Justice explains, unlike the earlier cases to come before the Court here neither the actors nor their conduct has
a commercial character, and neither the purposes nor the
design of the statute has an evident commercial nexus. See
ante, at 559-561. The statute makes the simple possession
of a gun within 1,000 feet of the grounds of the school a
criminal offense. In a sense any conduct in this interdependent world of ours has an ultimate commercial origin or
consequence, but we have not yet said the commerce power
may reach so far. If Congress attempts that extension, then
at the least we must inquire whether the exercise of national
power seeks to intrude upon an area of traditional state
concern.

An interference of these dimensions occurs here, for it is
well established that education is a traditional concern of the
States. Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U. S. 717, 741-742 (1974);

Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U. S. 97, 104 (1968). The prox-imity to schools, including of course schools owned and operated by the States or their subdivisions, is the very premisefor making the conduct criminal. In these circumstances,
we have a particular duty to ensure that the federal-state
balance is not destroyed. Cf. Rice, supra, at 230 ("[W]estart with the assumption that the historic police powers of

the States" are not displaced by a federal statute "unlessthat was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress");

Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U. S. 132,146 (1963).

While it is doubtful that any State, or indeed any reasonable person, would argue that it is wise policy to allow students to carry guns on school premises, considerable disagreement exists about how best to accomplish that goal.
In this circumstance, the theory and utility of our federalism
are revealed, for the States may perform their role as laboratories for experimentation to devise various solutions where
the best solution is far from clear. See San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 1, 49-50 (1973);
New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 311 (1932)
(Brandeis, J., dissenting).

If a State or municipality determines that harsh criminal
sanctions are necessary and wise to deter students from carrying guns on school premises, the reserved powers of the
States are sufficient to enact those measures. Indeed, over
40 States already have criminal laws outlawing the possession of firearms on or near school grounds. See, e. g., Alaska
Stat. Ann. $$ 11.61.195(a)(2)(A), 11.61.220(a)(4)(A) (Supp.
1994); Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 626.9 (West Supp. 1994); Mass.

The statute now before us forecloses the States from experimenting and exercising their own judgment in an area
to which States lay claim by right of history and expertise,
and it does so by regulating an activity beyond the realm of
commerce in the ordinary and usual sense of that term. The
tendency of this statute to displace state regulation in areas
of traditional state concern is evident from its territorial operation. There are over 100,000 elementary and secondary
schools in the United States. See U. S. Dept. of Education,
National Center for Education Statistics, Digest of Education Statistics 73, 104 (NCES 94-115, 1994) (Tables 63, 94).
Each of these now has an invisible federal zone extending
1,000 feet beyond the (often irregular) boundaries of the
school property. In some communities no doubt it would be
difficult to navigate without infringing on those zones. Yet
throughout these areas, school officials would find their own
programs for the prohibition of guns in danger of displacement by the federal authority unless the State chooses to
enact a parallel rule.

This is not a case where the etiquette of federalism has
been violated by a formal command from the National Government directing the State to enact a certain policy, cf. New
York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144 (1992), or to organize its
governmental functions in a certain way, cf. FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S., at 781 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
in part and dissenting in part). While the intrusion on state
sovereignty may not be as severe in this instance as in some
of our recent Tenth Amendment cases, the intrusion is nonetheless significant. Absent a stronger connection or identification with commercial concerns that are central to the
Commerce Clause, that interference contradicts the federal
balance the Framers designed and that this Court is obliged
to enforce.

For these reasons, I join in the opinion and judgment of
the Court.

Justice Thomas, concurring.
The Court today properly concludes that the CommerceClause does not grant Congress the authority to prohibit gun

possession within 1,000 feet of a school, as it attempted to doin the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101-647,
104 Stat. 4844. Although I join the majority, I write sepa-rately to observe that our case law has drifted far from the
original understanding of the Commerce Clause. In a fu-ture case, we ought to temper our Commerce Clause jurisprudence in a manner that both makes sense of our morerecent case law and is more faithful to the original understanding of that Clause.We have said that Congress may regulate not only "Commerce . . . among the several States," U. S. Const., Art. I,$ 8, cl. 3, but also anything that has a "substantial effect" on
such commerce. This test, if taken to its logical extreme,would give Congress a "police power" over all aspects of
American life. Unfortunately, we have never come to gripswith this implication of our substantial effects formula. Although we have supposedly applied the substantial effectstest for the past 60 years, we

always have rejected readings
of the Commerce Clause and the scope of federal power thatwould permit Congress to exercise a police power; our cases

are quite clear that there are real limits to federal power.See

New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 155 (1992)

Government has nothing approaching a police power. Com-pare ante, at 556-558, with post, at 624.

While the principal dissent concedes that there are limitsto federal power, the sweeping nature of our current test
enables the dissent to argue that Congress can regulate gunpossession. But it seems to me that the power to regulate
"commerce" can by no means encompass authority over meregun possession, any more than it empowers the Federal Government to regulate marriage, littering, or cruelty to ani-mals, throughout the 50 States. Our Constitution quite
properly leaves such matters to the individual States, not-withstanding these activities' effects on interstate commerce. Any interpretation of the Commerce Clause thateven suggests that Congress could regulate such matters is
in need of reexamination.In an appropriate case, I believe that we must further reconsider our "substantial effects" test with an eye towardconstructing a standard that reflects the text and history of
the Commerce Clause without totally rejecting our morerecent Commerce Clause jurisprudence.

Today, however, I merely support the Court's conclusionwith a discussion of the text, structure, and history of the
Commerce Clause and an analysis of our early case law. Mygoal is simply to show how far we have departed from the
original understanding and to demonstrate that the resultwe reach today is by no means "radical," see

post, at 602(
Stevens, J., dissenting). I also want to point out the ne-cessity of refashioning a coherent test that does not tend to

"obliterate the distinction between what is national and whatis local and create a completely centralized government."

At the time the original Constitution was ratified, "com-merce" consisted of selling, buying, and bartering, as well as

transporting for these purposes. See 1 S. Johnson, A Dic514us3$52N 05-27-98 16:48:05 PAGES OPINPGT

1789) ("trade or traffic"); T. Sheridan, A Complete Dictionary
of the English Language (6th ed. 1796) ("Exchange of onething for another; trade, traffick"). This understanding

finds support in the etymology of the word, which literallymeans "with merchandise." See 3 Oxford English Dictionary 552 (2d ed. 1989) (com--"with"; merci--"merchandise").In fact, when Federalists and Anti-Federalists discussed the
Commerce Clause during the ratification period, they oftenused trade (in its selling/ bartering sense) and commerce interchangeably. See The Federalist No. 4, p. 22 (J. Jay) (asserting that countries will cultivate our friendship when our"trade" is prudently regulated by Federal Government);

1 id.,

No. 7, at 39-40 (A. Hamilton) (discussing "competitions of
commerce" between States resulting from state "regulations
of trade"); id., No. 40, at 262 (J. Madison) (asserting that it
was an "acknowledged object of the Convention . . . that the
regulation of trade should be submitted to the general government"); Lee, Letters of a Federal Farmer No. 5, in Pamphlets on the Constitution of the United States 319 (P. Ford
ed. 1888); Smith, An Address to the People of the State of
New-York, in id., at 107.

As one would expect, the term "commerce" was used in
contradistinction to productive activities such as manufacturing and agriculture. Alexander Hamilton, for example,
repeatedly treated commerce, agriculture, and manufacturing as three separate endeavors. See, e. g., The Federalist
No. 36, at 224 (referring to "agriculture, commerce, manufactures"); id., No. 21, at 133 (distinguishing commerce, arts,
and industry); id., No. 12, at 74 (asserting that commerce and
agriculture have shared interests). The same distinctions

were made in the state ratification conventions. See, e. g., 2Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption

of the Federal Constitution 57 (J. Elliot ed. 1836) (hereinafterDebates) (T. Dawes at Massachusetts convention); id., at 336
(M. Smith at New York convention).Moreover, interjecting a modern sense of commerce into
the Constitution generates significant textual and structuralproblems. For example, one cannot replace "commerce"
with a different type of enterprise, such as manufacturing.When a manufacturer produces a car, assembly cannot take
place "with a foreign nation" or "with the Indian Tribes."Parts may come from different States or other nations and
hence may have been in the flow of commerce at one time,but manufacturing takes place at a discrete site. Agriculture and manufacturing involve the production of goods;commerce encompasses traffic in such articles.

The Port Preference Clause also suggests that the term"commerce" denoted sale and/or transport rather than business generally. According to that Clause, "[n]o Preferenceshall be given by any Regulation of Commerce or Revenue
to the Ports of one State over those of another." U. S.Const., Art. I, $ 9, cl. 6. Although it is possible to conceive
of regulations of manufacturing or farming that prefer oneport over another, the more natural reading is that the
Clause prohibits Congress from using its commerce power tochannel commerce through certain favored ports.

The Constitution not only uses the word "commerce" in anarrower sense than our case law might suggest, it also does
not support the proposition that Congress has authority overall activities that "substantially affect" interstate commerce.
The Commerce Clause 2 does not state that Congress may

2 Even to speak of "the Commerce Clause" perhaps obscures the actual
scope of that Clause. As an original matter, Congress did not have authority to regulate all commerce; Congress could only "regulate Commerce
with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian
Tribes." U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3. Although the precise line between

Thomas, J., concurring
"regulate matters that substantially affect commerce with
foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the
Indian Tribes." In contrast, the Constitution itself temporarily prohibited amendments that would "affect" Congress'
lack of authority to prohibit or restrict the slave trade or to
enact unproportioned direct taxation. Art. V. Clearly, the
Framers could have drafted a Constitution that contained a
"substantially affects interstate commerce" Clause had that
been their objective.

In addition to its powers under the Commerce Clause,
Congress has the authority to enact such laws as are "necessary and proper" to carry into execution its power to regulate commerce among the several States. U. S. Const.,
Art. I, $ 8, cl. 18. But on this Court's understanding of congressional power under these two Clauses, many of Congress' other enumerated powers under Art. I, $ 8, are wholly
superfluous. After all, if Congress may regulate all matters
that substantially affect commerce, there is no need for the
Constitution to specify that Congress may enact bankruptcy
laws, cl. 4, or coin money and fix the standard of weights and
measures, cl. 5, or punish counterfeiters of United States coin
and securities, cl. 6. Likewise, Congress would not need the
separate authority to establish post offices and post roads,
cl. 7, or to grant patents and copyrights, cl. 8, or to "punish
Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas," cl. 10.
It might not even need the power to raise and support an
Army and Navy, cls. 12 and 13, for fewer people would engage in commercial shipping if they thought that a foreign
power could expropriate their property with ease. Indeed,
if Congress could regulate matters that substantially affect
interstate commerce, there would have been no need to specinterstate/foreign commerce and purely intrastate commerce was hard to
draw, the Court attempted to adhere to such a line for the first 150 years
of our Nation. See infra, at 593-599.

Thomas, J., concurring
ify that Congress can regulate international trade and commerce with the Indians. As the Framers surely understood,
these other branches of trade substantially affect interstate
commerce.

Put simply, much if not all of Art. I, $ 8 (including portions
of the Commerce Clause itself), would be surplusage if Congress had been given authority over matters that substantially affect interstate commerce. An interpretation of cl. 3
that makes the rest of $ 8 superfluous simply cannot be correct. Yet this Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence has
endorsed just such an interpretation: The power we have
accorded Congress has swallowed Art. I, $ 8.3

Indeed, if a "substantial effects" test can be appended to
the Commerce Clause, why not to every other power of the
Federal Government? There is no reason for singling out
the Commerce Clause for special treatment. Accordingly,
Congress could regulate all matters that "substantially affect" the Army and Navy, bankruptcies, tax collection, expenditures, and so on. In that case, the Clauses of $ 8 all
mutually overlap, something we can assume the Founding
Fathers never intended.

Our construction of the scope of congressional authority
has the additional problem of coming close to turning the
Tenth Amendment on its head. Our case law could be read
to reserve to the United States all powers not expressly prohibited by the Constitution. Taken together, these fundamental textual problems should, at the very least, convince
us that the "substantial effects" test should be reexamined.

3 There are other powers granted to Congress outside of Art. I, $ 8, that
may become wholly superfluous as well due to our distortion of the Commerce Clause. For instance, Congress has plenary power over the District of Columbia and the territories. See U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 17,
and Art. IV, $ 3, cl. 2. The grant of comprehensive legislative power over
certain areas of the Nation, when read in conjunction with the rest of
the Constitution, further confirms that Congress was not ceded plenary
authority over the whole Nation.

II
The exchanges during the ratification campaign reveal therelatively limited reach of the Commerce Clause and of federal power generally. The Founding Fathers confirmed thatmost areas of life (even many matters that would have substantial effects on commerce) would remain outside the reachof the Federal Government. Such affairs would continue to
be under the exclusive control of the States.Early Americans understood that commerce, manufacturing, and agriculture, while distinct activities, were intimatelyrelated and dependent on each other--that each "substantially affected" the others. After all, items produced byfarmers and manufacturers were the primary articles of commerce at the time. If commerce was more robust as a resultof federal superintendence, farmers and manufacturers could
benefit. Thus, Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut attemptedto convince farmers of the benefits of regulating commerce.
"Your property and riches depend on a ready demand andgenerous price for the produce you can annually spare," he
wrote, and these conditions exist "where trade flourishes andwhen the merchant can freely export the produce of the
country" to nations that will pay the highest price. A Land-holder No. 1, Connecticut Courant, Nov. 5, 1787, in 3 Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution 399(M. Jensen ed. 1978) (hereinafter Documentary History).
See also The Federalist No. 35, at 219 (A. Hamilton) ("[D]is-cerning citizens are well aware that the mechanic and manufacturing arts furnish the materials of mercantile enterpriseand industry. Many of them indeed are immediately connected with the operations of commerce. They know thatthe merchant is their natural patron and friend");

a "source of commerce"); Marcus, The New Jersey Journal,Nov. 14, 1787, id., at 152 (both the mechanic and the farmer

benefit from the prosperity of commerce). William Davie, adelegate to the North Carolina Convention, illustrated the
close link best: "Commerce, sir, is the nurse of [agricultureand manufacturing]. The merchant furnishes the planter
with such articles as he cannot manufacture himself, andfinds him a market for his produce. Agriculture cannot
flourish if commerce languishes; they are mutually depend-ent on each other." 4 Debates 20.

Yet, despite being well aware that agriculture, manufac-turing, and other matters substantially affected commerce,
the founding generation did not cede authority over all theseactivities to Congress. Hamilton, for instance, acknowledged that the Federal Government could not regulate agri-culture and like concerns:

"The administration of private justice between the citi-zens of the same State, the supervision of agriculture
and of other concerns of a similar nature, all those thingsin short which are proper to be provided for by local
legislation, can never be desirable cares of a general ju-risdiction." The Federalist No. 17, at 106.

In the unlikely event that the Federal Government wouldattempt to exercise authority over such matters, its effort
"would be as troublesome as it would be nugatory." Ibid.4

The comments of Hamilton and others about federal powerreflected the well-known truth that the new Government

would have only the limited and enumerated powers foundin the Constitution. See,

e. g., 2 Debates 267-268 (A. Hamilton at New York Convention) (noting that there would be
just cause for rejecting the Constitution if it would enablethe Federal Government to "alter, or abrogate . . . [a State's]

civil and criminal institutions [or] penetrate the recesses ofdomestic life, and control, in all respects, the private conduct
of individuals"); The Federalist No. 45, at 313 (J. Madison); 3Debates 259 (J. Madison) (Virginia Convention); R. Sherman & O. Ellsworth, Letter to Governor Huntington, Sept.
26, 1787, in 3 Documentary History 352; J. Wilson, Speech
in the State House Yard, Oct. 6, 1787, in 2 id., at 167-168.
Agriculture and manufacture, since they were not surrendered to the Federal Government, were state concerns. See
The Federalist No. 34, at 212-213 (A. Hamilton) (observing
that the "internal encouragement of agriculture and manufactures" was an object of state expenditure). Even before
the passage of the Tenth Amendment, it was apparent that
Congress would possess only those powers "herein granted"
by the rest of the Constitution. Art. I, $ 1.

Where the Constitution was meant to grant federal authority over an activity substantially affecting interstate
commerce, the Constitution contains an enumerated power
over that particular activity. Indeed, the Framers knew
that many of the other enumerated powers in $ 8 dealt with
matters that substantially affected interstate commerce.
Madison, for instance, spoke of the bankruptcy power as
being "intimately connected with the regulation of commerce." The Federalist No. 42, at 287. Likewise, Hamilton
urged that "[i]f we mean to be a commercial people or even
to be secure on our Atlantic side, we must endeavour as soon
as possible to have a navy." Id., No. 24, at 157.

In short, the Founding Fathers were well aware of what

post, at 625 (Breyer, J.) (quoting North American Co. v.
SEC, 327 U. S. 686, 705 (1946)). Even though the boundary
between commerce and other matters may ignore "economic
reality" and thus seem arbitrary or artificial to some, we
must nevertheless respect a constitutional line that does not
grant Congress power over all that substantially affects interstate commerce.

III

If the principal dissent's understanding of our early case
law were correct, there might be some reason to doubt this
view of the original understanding of the Constitution. According to that dissent, Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in
Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1 (1824), established that Congress may control all local activities that "significantly affect
interstate commerce," post, at 615. And, "with the exception of one wrong turn subsequently corrected," this has
been the "traditiona[l]" method of interpreting the Commerce Clause. Post, at 631 (citing Gibbons and United
States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 116-117 (1941)).

In my view, the dissent is wrong about the holding and
reasoning of Gibbons. Because this error leads the dissent
to characterize the first 150 years of this Court's case law as
a "wrong turn," I feel compelled to put the last 50 years in
proper perspective.

A

In Gibbons, the Court examined whether a federal law
that licensed ships to engage in the "coasting trade" preempted a New York law granting a 30-year monopoly to Robert Livingston and Robert Fulton to navigate the State's
waterways by steamship. In concluding that it did, the
Court noted that Congress could regulate "navigation" because "[a]ll America . . . has uniformly understood, the word
`commerce,' to comprehend navigation. It was so understood, and must have been so understood, when the constitution was framed." 9 Wheat., at 190. The Court also ob514us3$52N 05-27-98 16:48:05 PAGES OPINPGT

Thomas, J., concurring
served that federal power over commerce "among theseveral States" meant that Congress could regulate commerce conducted partly within a State. Because a portionof interstate commerce and foreign commerce would almost
always take place within one or more States, federal power
over interstate and foreign commerce necessarily wouldextend into the States.

Id., at 194-196.
At the same time, the Court took great pains to make clearthat Congress could

not regulate commerce "which is completely internal, which is carried on between man and manin a State, or between different parts of the same State, and

which does not extend to or affect other States." Id., at 194.
Moreover, while suggesting that the Constitution might not
permit States to regulate interstate or foreign commerce,
the Court observed that "[i]nspection laws, quarantine laws,
health laws of every description, as well as laws for regulating the internal commerce of a State" were but a small part
"of that immense mass of legislation . . . not surrendered to
a general government." Id., at 203. From an early moment, the Court rejected the notion that Congress can regulate everything that affects interstate commerce. That the
internal commerce of the States and the numerous state inspection, quarantine, and health laws had substantial effects
on interstate commerce cannot be doubted. Nevertheless,
they were not "surrendered to the general government."

Of course, the principal dissent is not the first to misconstrue Gibbons. For instance, the Court has stated that Gibbons "described the federal commerce power with a breadth
never yet exceeded." Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 120
(1942). See also Perez v. United States, 402 U. S. 146, 151
(1971) (claiming that with Darby and Wickard, "the broader
view of the Commerce Clause announced by Chief Justice
Marshall had been restored"). I believe that this misreading stems from two statements in Gibbons.

First, the Court made the uncontroversial claim that
federal power does not encompass "commerce" that "does

514us3$52N 05-27-98 16:48:05 PAGES OPINPGT

595Cite as: 514 U. S. 549 (1995)
Thomas, J., concurring
not extend to or affect other States." 9 Wheat., at 194
(emphasis added). From this statement, the principal
dissent infers that whenever an activity affects interstate
commerce, it necessarily follows that Congress can regulate
such activities. Of course, Chief Justice Marshall said no
such thing and the inference the dissent makes cannot be
drawn.

There is a much better interpretation of the "affect[s]" language: Because the Court had earlier noted that the commerce power did not extend to wholly intrastate commerce,
the Court was acknowledging that although the line between
intrastate and interstate/foreign commerce would be difficult
to draw, federal authority could not be construed to cover
purely intrastate commerce. Commerce that did not affect
another State could never be said to be commerce "among
the several States."

But even if one were to adopt the dissent's reading, the
"affect[s]" language, at most, permits Congress to regulate
only intrastate commerce that substantially affects interstate and foreign commerce. There is no reason to believe
that Chief Justice Marshall was asserting that Congress
could regulate all activities that affect interstate commerce.
See ibid.

The second source of confusion stems from the Court's
praise for the Constitution's division of power between the
States and the Federal Government:

"The genius and character of the whole government
seem to be, that its action is to be applied to all the
external concerns of the nation, and to those internal
concerns which affect the States generally; but not to
those which are completely within a particular State,
which do not affect other States, and with which it is
not necessary to interfere, for the purpose of executing
some of the general powers of the government." Id.,
at 195.

In this passage, the Court merely was making the well un-derstood point that the Constitution commits matters of "national" concern to Congress and leaves "local" matters to theStates. The Court was not saying that whatever Congress
believes is a national matter becomes an object of federalcontrol. The matters of national concern are enumerated in
the Constitution: war, taxes, patents, and copyrights, uni-form rules of naturalization and bankruptcy, types of commerce, and so on. See generally Art. I, $ 8. Gibbons' em-phatic statements that Congress could not regulate many
matters that affect commerce confirm that the Court did notread the Commerce Clause as granting Congress control
over matters that "affect the States generally." 5 Gibbonssimply cannot be construed as the principal dissent would
have it. B

I am aware of no cases prior to the New Deal that charac-terized the power flowing from the Commerce Clause as
sweepingly as does our substantial effects test. My reviewof the case law indicates that the substantial effects test is
but an innovation of the 20th century.Even before Gibbons, Chief Justice Marshall, writing for
the Court in Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264 (1821), notedthat Congress had "no general right to punish murder committed within any of the States," id., at 426, and that it was"clear that congress cannot punish felonies generally," id., at
428. The Court's only qualification was that Congress couldenact such laws for places where it enjoyed plenary powers--for instance, over the District of Columbia. Id., at 426.Thus, whatever effect ordinary murders, or robbery, or gun
possession might have on interstate commerce (or on any

5 None of the other Commerce Clause opinions during Chief Justice Marshall's tenure, which concerned the "dormant" Commerce Clause, even
suggested that Congress had authority over all matters substantially affecting commerce. See Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419 (1827); Willson v. Black Bird Creek Marsh Co., 2 Pet. 245 (1829).

other subject of federal concern) was irrelevant to the question of congressional power.6

United States v. Dewitt, 9 Wall. 41 (1870), marked the first
time the Court struck down a federal law as exceeding the
power conveyed by the Commerce Clause. In a two-page
opinion, the Court invalidated a nationwide law prohibiting
all sales of naphtha and illuminating oils. In so doing, the
Court remarked that the Commerce Clause "has always been
understood as limited by its terms; and as a virtual denial of
any power to interfere with the internal trade and business
of the separate States." Id., at 44. The law in question
was "plainly a regulation of police," which could have constitutional application only where Congress had exclusive
authority, such as the territories. Id., at 44-45. See also
License Tax Cases, 5 Wall. 462, 470-471 (1867) (Congress
cannot interfere with the internal commerce and business of
a State); Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U. S. 82 (1879) (Congress

6 It is worth noting that Congress, in the first federal criminal Act, did
not establish nationwide prohibitions against murder and the like. See
Act of Apr. 30, 1790, ch. 9, 1 Stat. 112. To be sure, Congress outlawed
murder, manslaughter, maiming, and larceny, but only when those acts
were either committed on United States territory not part of a State or
on the high seas. Ibid. See U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 10 (authorizing
Congress to outlaw piracy and felonies on high seas); Art. IV, $ 3, cl. 2
(plenary authority over United States territory and property). When
Congress did enact nationwide criminal laws, it acted pursuant to direct
grants of authority found in the Constitution. Compare Act of Apr. 30,
1790, supra, $$ 1 and 14 (prohibitions against treason and the counterfeiting of U. S. securities), with U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 6 (counterfeiting);
Art. III, $ 3, cl. 2 (treason). Notwithstanding any substantial effects that
murder, kidnaping, or gun possession might have had on interstate commerce, Congress understood that it could not establish nationwide
prohibitions.

Likewise, there were no laws in the early Congresses that regulated
manufacturing and agriculture. Nor was there any statute that purported to regulate activities with "substantial effects" on interstate
commerce.

cannot regulate internal commerce and thus may not estab-lish national trademark registration).

In United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U. S. 1 (1895),this Court held that mere attempts to monopolize the manufacture of sugar could not be regulated pursuant to the Commerce Clause. Raising echoes of the discussions of theFramers regarding the intimate relationship between commerce and manufacturing, the Court declared that "[c]om-merce succeeds to manufacture, and is not a part of it."

Id.,
at 12. The Court also approvingly quoted from Kidd v.
Pearson, 128 U. S. 1, 20 (1888):

" `No distinction is more popular to the common mind,or more clearly expressed in economic and political literature, than that between manufacture and commerce. . . . If it be held that the term [commerce] includes
the regulation of all such manufactures as are intendedto be the subject of commercial transactions in the future, it is impossible to deny that it would also include
all productive industries that contemplate the samething. The result would be that Congress would be invested . . . with the power to regulate, not only manufac-tures, but also agriculture, horticulture, stock raising,
domestic fisheries, mining--in short, every branch ofhuman industry.' "

E. C. Knight, supra, at 14.

If federal power extended to these types of production "com-paratively little of business operations and affairs would be

left for state control." Id., at 16. See also Newberry v.
United States, 256 U. S. 232, 257 (1921) ("It is settled . . . that
the power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce does
not reach whatever is essential thereto. Without agriculture, manufacturing, mining, etc., commerce could not exist,
but this fact does not suffice to subject them to the control
of Congress"). Whether or not manufacturing, agriculture,
or other matters substantially affected interstate commerce
was irrelevant.

As recently as 1936, the Court continued to insist that theCommerce Clause did not reach the wholly internal business

of the States. See Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238,308 (1936) (Congress may not regulate mine labor because
"[t]he relation of employer and employee is a local relation");see also

A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States,295 U. S. 495, 543-550 (1935) (holding that Congress may not

regulate intrastate sales of sick chickens or the labor of em-ployees involved in intrastate poultry sales). The Federal
Government simply could not reach such subjects regardlessof their effects on interstate commerce.

These cases all establish a simple point: From the time ofthe ratification of the Constitution to the mid-1930's, it was
widely understood that the Constitution granted Congressonly limited powers, notwithstanding the Commerce Clause.

7

Moreover, there was no question that activities wholly sepa-rated from business, such as gun possession, were beyond

the reach of the commerce power. If anything, the "wrongturn" was the Court's dramatic departure in the 1930's from
a century and a half of precedent.

IV
Apart from its recent vintage and its corresponding lackof any grounding in the original understanding of the Constitution, the substantial effects test suffers from the further

7 To be sure, congressional power pursuant to the Commerce Clause was
alternatively described less narrowly or more narrowly during this 150-
year period. Compare United States v. Coombs, 12 Pet. 72, 78 (1838)
(commerce power "extends to such acts, done on land, which interfere
with, obstruct, or prevent the due exercise of the power to regulate [interstate and international] commerce" such as stealing goods from a beached
ship), with United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U. S. 1, 13 (1895) ("Contracts to buy, sell, or exchange goods to be transported among the several
States, the transportation and its instrumentalities . . . may be regulated,
but this is because they form part of interstate trade or commerce"). During this period, however, this Court never held that Congress could regulate everything that substantially affects commerce.

flaw that it appears to grant Congress a police power overthe Nation. When asked at oral argument if there were

any
limits to the Commerce Clause, the Government was at aloss for words. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5. Likewise, the principal

dissent insists that there are limits, but it cannot muster
even one example. Post, at 624. Indeed, the dissent implic-itly concedes that its reading has no limits when it criticizes

the Court for "threaten[ing] legal uncertainty in an area oflaw that . . . seemed reasonably well settled."

Post, at 630.
The one advantage of the dissent's standard is certainty: Itis certain that under its analysis everything may be regulated under the guise of the Commerce Clause.The substantial effects test suffers from this flaw, in part,
because of its "aggregation principle." Under so-called
"class of activities" statutes, Congress can regulate wholecategories of activities that are not themselves either "interstate" or "commerce." In applying the effects test, we askwhether the class of activities

as a whole substantially affects interstate commerce, not whether any specific activitywithin the class has such effects when considered in isolation.

See Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S., at 192-193 (if class of activ-ities is " `within the reach of federal power,' " courts may not
excise individual applications as trivial) (quoting Darby, 312
U. S., at 120-121).

The aggregation principle is clever, but has no stopping
point. Suppose all would agree that gun possession within
1,000 feet of a school does not substantially affect commerce,
but that possession of weapons generally (knives, brass
knuckles, nunchakus, etc.) does. Under our substantial effects doctrine, even though Congress cannot single out gun
possession, it can prohibit weapon possession generally.
But one always can draw the circle broadly enough to cover
an activity that, when taken in isolation, would not have substantial effects on commerce. Under our jurisprudence, if
Congress passed an omnibus "substantially affects interstate
commerce" statute, purporting to regulate every aspect of
human existence, the Act apparently would be constitutional.

Even though particular sections may govern only trivialactivities, the statute in the aggregate regulates matters

V
This extended discussion of the original understanding andour first century and a half of case law does not necessarily

require a wholesale abandonment of our more recent opin-ions.

8 It simply reveals that our substantial effects test is

far removed from both the Constitution and from our earlycase law and that the Court's opinion should not be viewed

as "radical" or another "wrong turn" that must be correctedin the future.

9 The analysis also suggests that we ought to

temper our Commerce Clause jurisprudence.

8 Although I might be willing to return to the original understanding, I
recognize that many believe that it is too late in the day to undertake a
fundamental reexamination of the past 60 years. Consideration of stare
decisis and reliance interests may convince us that we cannot wipe the
slate clean.

9 Nor can the majority's opinion fairly be compared to Lochner v. New

York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905). See post, at 604-609 (Souter, J., dissenting).
Unlike Lochner and our more recent "substantive due process" cases, today's decision enforces only the Constitution and not "judicial policy judgments." See post, at 607. Notwithstanding Justice Souter's discussion, " `commercial' character" is not only a natural but an inevitable
"ground of Commerce Clause distinction." See post, at 608 (emphasis
added). Our invalidation of the Gun-Free School Zones Act therefore falls
comfortably within our proper role in reviewing federal legislation to determine if it exceeds congressional authority as defined by the Constitution itself. As John Marshall put it: "If [Congress] were to make a law
not warranted by any of the powers enumerated, it would be considered
by the judges as an infringement of the Constitution which they are to
guard . . . . They would declare it void." 3 Debates 553 (before the
Virginia ratifying convention); see also The Federalist No. 44, at 305 (J.
Madison) (asserting that if Congress exercises powers "not warranted by
[the Constitution's] true meaning" the judiciary will defend the Constitution); id., No. 78, at 526 (A. Hamilton) (asserting that the "courts of justice
are to be considered as the bulwarks of a limited constitution against legislative encroachments"). Where, as here, there is a case or controversy,
there can be no "misstep," post, at 614, in enforcing the Constitution.

Stevens, J., dissenting
Unless the dissenting Justices are willing to repudiate ourlong-held understanding of the limited nature of federal

power, I would think that they, too, must be willing to recon-sider the substantial effects test in a future case. If we wish
to be true to a Constitution that does not cede a police power
to the Federal Government, our Commerce Clause's bound-aries simply cannot be "defined" as being " `commensurate

with the national needs' " or self-consciously intended to letthe Federal Government " `defend itself against economic
forces that Congress decrees inimical or destructive of thenational economy.' " See

post, at 625 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (quoting North American Co. v. SEC, 327 U. S., at 705).Such a formulation of federal power is no test at all: It is a

blank check.

At an appropriate juncture, I think we must modify our
Commerce Clause jurisprudence. Today, it is easy enough
to say that the Clause certainly does not empower Congress
to ban gun possession within 1,000 feet of a school.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
The welfare of our future "Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States," U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8,
cl. 3, is vitally dependent on the character of the education
of our children. I therefore agree entirely with Justice
Breyer's explanation of why Congress has ample power to
prohibit the possession of firearms in or near schools--just
as it may protect the school environment from harms posed
by controlled substances such as asbestos or alcohol. I also
agree with Justice Souter's exposition of the radical character of the Court's holding and its kinship with the discredited, pre-Depression version of substantive due process. Cf.
Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U. S. 374, 405-411 (1994) (Stevens, J., dissenting). I believe, however, that the Court's
extraordinary decision merits this additional comment.

Guns are both articles of commerce and articles that can
be used to restrain commerce. Their possession is the con514us3$52I 05-27-98 16:48:05 PAGES OPINPGT

sequence, either directly or indirectly, of commercial activity.
In my judgment, Congress' power to regulate commerce in
firearms includes the power to prohibit possession of guns
at any location because of their potentially harmful use; it
necessarily follows that Congress may also prohibit their
possession in particular markets. The market for the possession of handguns by school-age children is, distressingly,
substantial.* Whether or not the national interest in eliminating that market would have justified federal legislation in
1789, it surely does today.

Justice Souter, dissenting.
In reviewing congressional legislation under the Commerce Clause, we defer to what is often a merely implicit
congressional judgment that its regulation addresses a subject substantially affecting interstate commerce "if there is
any rational basis for such a finding." Hodel v. Virginia
Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264,
276 (1981); Preseault v. ICC, 494 U. S. 1, 17 (1990); see Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183, 190 (1968), quoting Katzenbach
v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294, 303-304 (1964). If that congressional determination is within the realm of reason, "the only
remaining question for judicial inquiry is whether `the means
chosen by Congress [are] reasonably adapted to the end permitted by the Constitution.' " Hodel v. Virginia Surface
Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., supra, at 276, quoting
Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241,
262 (1964); see also Preseault v. ICC, supra, at 17.1

The practice of deferring to rationally based legislativejudgments "is a paradigm of judicial restraint." FCC v.

Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U. S. 307, 314 (1993). Injudicial review under the Commerce Clause, it reflects our
respect for the institutional competence of the Congress ona subject expressly assigned to it by the Constitution and our
appreciation of the legitimacy that comes from Congress'spolitical accountability in dealing with matters open to a
wide range of possible choices. See id., at 313-316; Hodel v.
Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., supra,at 276; United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144,

Inc., 348 U. S. 483, 488 (1955).It was not ever thus, however, as even a brief overview of

Commerce Clause history during the past century remindsus. The modern respect for the competence and primacy of
Congress in matters affecting commerce developed onlyafter one of this Court's most chastening experiences, when
it perforce repudiated an earlier and untenably expansiveconception of judicial review in derogation of congressional
commerce power. A look at history's sequence will serve toshow how today's decision tugs the Court off course, leading
it to suggest opportunities for further developments thatwould be at odds with the rule of restraint to which the
Court still wisely states adherence.

729-730. Although the Court upheld a fair amount of theensuing legislation as being within the commerce power, see,

e. g., Stafford v. Wallace, 258 U. S. 495 (1922) (upholding anAct regulating trade practices in the meat packing industry);
Shreveport Rate Cases, 234 U. S. 342 (1914) (upholding Interstate Commerce Commission order to equalize interstate andintrastate rail rates); see generally Warren,

supra, at 729-
739, the period from the turn of the century to 1937 is betternoted for a series of cases applying highly formalistic notions

of "commerce" to invalidate federal social and economic legis-lation, see,

e. g., Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238, 303-
304 (1936) (striking Act prohibiting unfair labor practices in
coal industry as regulation of "mining" and "production," not
"commerce"); A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United
States, 295 U. S. 495, 545-548 (1935) (striking congressional
regulation of activities affecting interstate commerce only
"indirectly"); Hammer v. Dagenhart, 247 U. S. 251 (1918)
(striking Act prohibiting shipment in interstate commerce of
goods manufactured at factories using child labor because
the Act regulated "manufacturing," not "commerce"); Adair
v. United States, 208 U. S. 161 (1908) (striking protection of
labor union membership as outside "commerce").

These restrictive views of commerce subject to congressional power complemented the Court's activism in limiting
the enforceable scope of state economic regulation. It is
most familiar history that during this same period the Court
routinely invalidated state social and economic legislation
under an expansive conception of Fourteenth Amendment
substantive due process. See, e. g., Louis K. Liggett Co. v.
Baldridge, 278 U. S. 105 (1928) (striking state law requiring
pharmacy owners to be licensed as pharmacists); Coppage
v. Kansas, 236 U. S. 1 (1915) (striking state law prohibiting

tutional Law 568-574 (2d ed. 1988). The fulcrums of judicial
review in these cases were the notions of liberty and property characteristic of laissez-faire economics, whereas the
Commerce Clause cases turned on what was ostensibly a
structural limit of federal power, but under each conception
of judicial review the Court's character for the first third of
the century showed itself in exacting judicial scrutiny of a
legislature's choice of economic ends and of the legislative
means selected to reach them.

It was not merely coincidental, then, that sea changes in
the Court's conceptions of its authority under the Due Process and Commerce Clauses occurred virtually together, in
1937, with West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379, and
NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1. See
Stern, The Commerce Clause and the National Economy,
1933-1946, 59 Harv. L. Rev. 645, 674-682 (1946). In West
Coast Hotel, the Court's rejection of a due process challenge
to a state law fixing minimum wages for women and children
marked the abandonment of its expansive protection of
contractual freedom. Two weeks later, Jones & Laughlin
affirmed congressional commerce power to authorize NLRB
injunctions against unfair labor practices. The Court's finding that the regulated activity had a direct enough effect on
commerce has since been seen as beginning the abandonment, for practical purposes, of the formalistic distinction
between direct and indirect effects.

In the years following these decisions, deference to legislative policy judgments on commercial regulation became the

basis test came quickly. See United States v. Carolene
Products Co., supra, at 152; see also Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., supra, at 489-490. The parallel formulation of the
Commerce Clause test came later, only because complete
elimination of the direct/indirect effects dichotomy and acceptance of the cumulative effects doctrine, Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 125, 127-129 (1942); United States v.
Wrightwood Dairy Co., supra, at 124-126, so far settled the
pressing issues of congressional power over commerce as to
leave the Court for years without any need to phrase a test
explicitly deferring to rational legislative judgments. The
moment came, however, with the challenge to congressional
Commerce Clause authority to prohibit racial discrimination
in places of public accommodation, when the Court simply
made explicit what the earlier cases had implied: "where we
find that the legislators, in light of the facts and testimony
before them, have a rational basis for finding a chosen regulatory scheme necessary to the protection of commerce, our
investigation is at an end." Katzenbach v. McClung, 379
U. S., at 303-304, discussing United States v. Darby, supra;
see Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S.,
at 258-259. Thus, under commerce, as under due process,
adoption of rational basis review expressed the recognition
that the Court had no sustainable basis for subjecting economic regulation as such to judicial policy judgments, and
for the past half century the Court has no more turned back
in the direction of formalistic Commerce Clause review (as
in deciding whether regulation of commerce was sufficiently
direct) than it has inclined toward reasserting the substantive authority of Lochner due process (as in the inflated protection of contractual autonomy). See, e. g., Maryland v.
Wirtz, 392 U. S., at 190, 198; Perez v. United States, 402 U. S.

There is today, however, a backward glance at both the oldpitfalls, as the Court treats deference under the rationality

rule as subject to gradation according to the commercial ornoncommercial nature of the immediate subject of the challenged regulation. See ante, at 558-561. The distinctionbetween what is patently commercial and what is not looks
much like the old distinction between what directly affectscommerce and what touches it only indirectly. And the act
of calibrating the level of deference by drawing a line be-tween what is patently commercial and what is less purely
so will probably resemble the process of deciding how muchinterference with contractual freedom was fatal. Thus, it
seems fair to ask whether the step taken by the Court todaydoes anything but portend a return to the untenable jurisprudence from which the Court extricated itself almost 60years ago. The answer is not reassuring. To be sure, the
occasion for today's decision reflects the century's end, notits beginning. But if it seems anomalous that the Congress
of the United States has taken to regulating school yards,the Act in question is still probably no more remarkable than
state regulation of bake shops 90 years ago. In any event,there is no reason to hope that the Court's qualification of
rational basis review will be any more successful than theefforts at substantive economic review made by our predecessors as the century began. Taking the Court's opinionon its own terms,

Justice Breyer has explained both the
hopeless porosity of "commercial" character as a ground ofCommerce Clause distinction in America's highly connected

economy, and the inconsistency of this categorization with
our rational basis precedents from the last 50 years.Further glosses on rationality review, moreover, may be

in the offing. Although this case turns on commercial char-acter, the Court gestures toward two other considerations
that it might sometime entertain in applying rational basis

scrutiny (apart from a statutory obligation to supply inde-pendent proof of a jurisdictional element): does the congressional statute deal with subjects of traditional state regula-tion, and does the statute contain explicit factual findings
supporting the otherwise implicit determination that theregulated activity substantially affects interstate commerce?
Once again, any appeal these considerations may have de-pends on ignoring the painful lesson learned in 1937, for neither of the Court's suggestions would square with rationalbasis scrutiny.

A
The Court observes that the Gun-Free School Zones Actoperates in two areas traditionally subject to legislation by

the States, education and enforcement of criminal law. Thesuggestion is either that a connection between commerce and
these subjects is remote, or that the commerce power is sim-ply weaker when it touches subjects on which the States
have historically been the primary legislators. Neither sug-gestion is tenable. As for remoteness, it may or may not be
wise for the National Government to deal with education,but

Justice Breyer has surely demonstrated that the com-mercial prospects of an illiterate State or Nation are not

rosy, and no argument should be needed to show that hijack-ing interstate shipments of cigarettes can affect commerce
substantially, even though the States have traditionally pros-ecuted robbery. And as for the notion that the commerce
power diminishes the closer it gets to customary state concerns, that idea has been flatly rejected, and not long ago.The commerce power, we have often observed, is plenary.

Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 460 (1991); United States v. CaroleneProducts Co., 304 U. S., at 147.

Nor is there any contrary authority in the reasoning of ourcases imposing clear statement rules in some instances of
legislation that would significantly alter the state-nationalbalance. In the absence of a clear statement of congressional design, for example, we have refused to interpret am-biguous federal statutes to limit fundamental state legislative prerogatives, Gregory v. Ashcroft, supra, at 460-464,our understanding being that such prerogatives, through
which "a State defines itself as a sovereign," are "powerswith which Congress does not readily interfere," 501 U. S.,
at 460, 461. Likewise, when faced with two plausible inter-pretations of a federal criminal statute, we generally will
take the alternative that does not force us to impute an in-tention to Congress to use its full commerce power to regulate conduct traditionally and ably regulated by the States.See

United States v. Enmons, 410 U. S. 396, 411-412 (1973);United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 349-350 (1971); Rewis

v. United States, 401 U. S. 808, 812 (1971).These clear statement rules, however, are merely rules of
statutory interpretation, to be relied upon only when the

371, 379-380 (1978); see Gregory v. Ashcroft, supra, at 470;
United States v. Bass, supra, at 346-347, and in cases implicating Congress's historical reluctance to trench on state
legislative prerogatives or to enter into spheres already
occupied by the States, Gregory v. Ashcroft, supra, at 461;
United States v. Bass, supra, at 349; see Rewis v. United
States, supra, at 811-812. They are rules for determining
intent when legislation leaves intent subject to question.
But our hesitance to presume that Congress has acted to
alter the state-federal status quo (when presented with a
plausible alternative) has no relevance whatever to the enquiry whether it has the commerce power to do so or to the
standard of judicial review when Congress has definitely
meant to exercise that power. Indeed, to allow our hesitance to affect the standard of review would inevitably degenerate into the sort of substantive policy review that the
Court found indefensible 60 years ago. The Court does not
assert (and could not plausibly maintain) that the commerce
power is wholly devoid of congressional authority to speak
on any subject of traditional state concern; but if congressional action is not forbidden absolutely when it touches such
a subject, it will stand or fall depending on the Court's view
of the strength of the legislation's commercial justification.
And here once again history raises its objections that the
Court's previous essays in overriding congressional policy
choices under the Commerce Clause were ultimately seen
to suffer two fatal weaknesses: when dealing with Acts of
Congress (as distinct from state legislation subject to review
under the theory of dormant commerce power) nothing in
the Clause compelled the judicial activism, and nothing about
the judiciary as an institution made it a superior source of
policy on the subject Congress dealt with. There is no
reason to expect the lesson would be different another

time.

There remain questions about legislative findings. The
Court of Appeals expressed the view, 2 F. 3d 1342, 1363-1368(CA5 1993), that the result in this case might well have been

different if Congress had made explicit findings that guns inschools have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, and
the Court today does not repudiate that position, see ante,at 562-563. Might a court aided by such findings have subjected this legislation to less exacting scrutiny (or, put an-other way, should a court have deferred to such findings if
Congress had made them)? 2 The answer to either question
must be no, although as a general matter findings are important and to be hoped for in the difficult cases.

It is only natural to look for help with a hard job, and
reviewing a claim that Congress has exceeded the commerce
power is much harder in some cases than in others. A challenge to congressional regulation of interstate garbage hauling would be easy to resolve; review of congressional regulation of gun possession in school yards is more difficult, both
because the link to interstate commerce is less obvious and
because of our initial ignorance of the relevant facts. In a

2 Unlike the Court, (perhaps), I would see no reason not to consider
Congress's findings, insofar as they might be helpful in reviewing the challenge to this statute, even though adopted in later legislation. See the
Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-322,

$ 320904, 108 Stat. 2125 ("[T]he occurrence of violent crime in school zones
has resulted in a decline in the quality of education in our country; . . .
this decline . . . has an adverse impact on interstate commerce and the
foreign commerce of the United States; . . . Congress has power, under
the interstate commerce clause and other provisions of the Constitution,
to enact measures to ensure the integrity and safety of the Nation's
schools by enactment of this subsection"). The findings, however, go no
further than expressing what is obviously implicit in the substantive legislation, at such a conclusory level of generality as to add virtually nothing
to the record. The Solicitor General certainly exercised sound judgment
in placing no significant reliance on these particular afterthoughts. Tr. of

case comparable to this one, we may have to dig hard tomake a responsible judgment about what Congress could

reasonably find, because the case may be close, and becausejudges tend not to be familiar with the facts that may or may
not make it close. But while the ease of review may vary
from case to case, it does not follow that the standard ofreview should vary, much less that explicit findings of fact

would even directly address the standard.The question for the courts, as all agree, is not whether as
a predicate to legislation Congress in fact found that a partic-ular activity substantially affects interstate commerce. The
legislation implies such a finding, and there is no reason to
entertain claims that Congress acted ultra vires intentionally. Nor is the question whether Congress was correct in
so finding. The only question is whether the legislative
judgment is within the realm of reason. See Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S.,
at 276-277; Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S., at 303-304;
Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Alton R. Co., 295 U. S. 330, 391-
392 (1935) (Hughes, C. J., dissenting); cf. FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U. S., at 315 (in the equal protection
context, "those attacking the rationality of the legislative
classification have the burden to negate every conceivable
basis which might support it[;] . . . it is entirely irrelevant
for constitutional purposes whether the conceived reason for
the challenged distinction actually motivated the legislature") (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U. S. 726, 731-733 (1963); Williamson
v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U. S., at 487. Congressional findings
do not, however, directly address the question of reasonableness; they tell us what Congress actually has found, not what
it could rationally find. If, indeed, the Court were to make
the existence of explicit congressional findings dispositive in
some close or difficult cases something other than rationality
review would be afoot. The resulting congressional obligation to justify its policy choices on the merits would imply

Souter, J., dissenting
either a judicial authority to review the justification (and,hence, the wisdom) of those choices, or authority to require

Congress to act with some high degree of deliberateness, ofwhich express findings would be evidence. But review for
congressional wisdom would just be the old judicial preten-sion discredited and abandoned in 1937, and review for deliberateness would be as patently unconstitutional as an Act ofCongress mandating long opinions from this Court. Such a
legislative process requirement would function merely as anexcuse for covert review of the merits of legislation under
standards never expressed and more or less arbitrarilyapplied. Under such a regime, in any case, the rationality
standard of review would be a thing of the past.On the other hand, to say that courts applying the rationality standard may not defer to findings is not, of course, tosay that findings are pointless. They may, in fact, have
great value in telling courts what to look for, in establishingat least one frame of reference for review, and in citing

to factual authority. The research underlying Justice
Breyer's dissent was necessarily a major undertaking; helpis welcome, and it not incidentally shrinks the risk that judicial research will miss material scattered across the publicdomain or buried under pounds of legislative record. Congressional findings on a more particular plane than thisrecord illustrates would accordingly have earned judicial
thanks. But thanks do not carry the day as long as rationalpossibility is the touchstone, and I would not allow for the
possibility, as the Court's opinion may, ante, at 563, that theaddition of congressional findings could in principle have
affected the fate of the statute here.

III
Because Justice Breyer's opinion demonstrates beyondany doubt that the Act in question passes the rationality review that the Court continues to espouse, today's decisionmay be seen as only a misstep, its reasoning and its sugges514us3$52M 05-27-98 16:48:05 PAGES OPINPGT

tions not quite in gear with the prevailing standard, buthardly an epochal case. I would not argue otherwise, but I

would raise a caveat. Not every epochal case has come inepochal trappings. Jones & Laughlin did not reject the
direct-indirect standard in so many words; it just said therelation of the regulated subject matter to commerce was
direct enough. 301 U. S., at 41-43. But we know whathappened.

I respectfully dissent.
Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice
Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

The issue in this case is whether the Commerce Clauseauthorizes Congress to enact a statute that makes it a

crime to possess a gun in, or near, a school. 18 U. S. C.$ 922(q)(1)(A) (1988 ed., Supp. V). In my view, the statute
falls well within the scope of the commerce power as thisCourt has understood that power over the last half century.

I
In reaching this conclusion, I apply three basic principlesof Commerce Clause interpretation. First, the power to

"regulate Commerce . . . among the several States," U. S.Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3, encompasses the power to regulate
local activities insofar as they significantly affect interstatecommerce. See,

e. g., Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 194-195(1824) (Marshall, C. J.); Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 125

(1942). As the majority points out, ante, at 559, the Court,in describing how much of an effect the Clause requires,
sometimes has used the word "substantial" and sometimeshas not. Compare,

e. g., Wickard, supra, at 125 ("substantialeconomic effect"), with Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &

Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 276 (1981) ("affectsinterstate commerce"); see also Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S.
183, 196, n. 27 (1968) (cumulative effect must not be "trivial");NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1, 37 (1937)

Breyer, J., dissenting
(speaking of "close and substantial relation" between activ-ity and commerce, not of "substantial effect") (emphasis

added); Gibbons, supra, at 194 (words of Commerce Clausedo not "comprehend . . . commerce, which is completely internal . . . and which does not . . . affect other States"). And,as the majority also recognizes in quoting Justice Cardozo,
the question of degree (how much effect) requires an esti-mate of the "size" of the effect that no verbal formulation can
capture with precision. See ante, at 567. I use the word"significant" because the word "substantial" implies a somewhat narrower power than recent precedent suggests. See,
e. g., Perez v. United States, 402 U. S. 146, 154 (1971); Danielv.

Paul, 395 U. S. 298, 308 (1969). But to speak of "substan-tial effect" rather than "significant effect" would make no

difference in this case.Second, in determining whether a local activity will likely
have a significant effect upon interstate commerce, a courtmust consider, not the effect of an individual act (a single
instance of gun possession), but rather the cumulative effectof all similar instances (

i. e., the effect of all guns possessedin or near schools). See, e. g., Wickard, supra, at 127-128.

As this Court put the matter almost 50 years ago:

"[I]t is enough that the individual activity when multi-plied into a general practice . . . contains a threat to the

interstate economy that requires preventative regula-tion."

Mandeville Island Farms, Inc. v. AmericanCrystal Sugar Co., 334 U. S. 219, 236 (1948) (citations

omitted).
Third, the Constitution requires us to judge the connectionbetween a regulated activity and interstate commerce, not

directly, but at one remove. Courts must give Congress adegree of leeway in determining the existence of a significant
factual connection between the regulated activity and inter-state commerce--both because the Constitution delegates
the commerce power directly to Congress and because the

617Cite as: 514 U. S. 549 (1995)
Breyer, J., dissenting
determination requires an empirical judgment of a kind that
a legislature is more likely than a court to make with accuracy. The traditional words "rational basis" capture this
leeway. See Hodel, supra, at 276-277. Thus, the specific
question before us, as the Court recognizes, is not whether
the "regulated activity sufficiently affected interstate commerce," but, rather, whether Congress could have had "a
rational basis" for so concluding. Ante, at 557 (emphasis
added).

I recognize that we must judge this matter independently.
"[S]imply because Congress may conclude that a particular
activity substantially affects interstate commerce does not
necessarily make it so." Hodel, supra, at 311 (Rehnquist,
J., concurring in judgment). And, I also recognize that Congress did not write specific "interstate commerce" findings
into the law under which Lopez was convicted. Nonetheless, as I have already noted, the matter that we review independently (i. e., whether there is a "rational basis") already
has considerable leeway built into it. And, the absence of
findings, at most, deprives a statute of the benefit of some
extra leeway. This extra deference, in principle, might
change the result in a close case, though, in practice, it has
not made a critical legal difference. See, e. g., Katzenbach
v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294, 299 (1964) (noting that "no formal
findings were made, which of course are not necessary");
Perez, supra, at 156-157; cf. Turner Broadcasting System,
Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 666 (1994) (opinion of Kennedy,
J.) ("Congress is not obligated, when enacting its statutes, to
make a record of the type that an administrative agency or
court does to accommodate judicial review"); Fullilove v.
Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448, 503 (1980) (Powell, J., concurring)
("After Congress has legislated repeatedly in an area of national concern, its Members gain experience that may reduce
the need for fresh hearings or prolonged debate . . ."). It
would seem particularly unfortunate to make the validity of

the statute at hand turn on the presence or absence of find-ings. Because Congress did make findings (though not until

after Lopez was prosecuted), doing so would appear to ele-vate form over substance. See Pub. L. 103-322, $$ 320904
(2)(F), (G), 108 Stat. 2125, 18 U. S. C. $$ 922(q)(1)(F), (G).In addition, despite the Court of Appeals' suggestion to
the contrary, see 2 F. 3d 1342, 1365 (CA5 1993), there is nospecial need here for a clear indication of Congress' rationale.
The statute does not interfere with the exercise of state orlocal authority. Cf.,

e. g., Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U. S. 223,227-228 (1989) (requiring clear statement for abrogation of

Eleventh Amendment immunity). Moreover, any clearstatement rule would apply only to determine Congress' intended result, not to clarify the source of its authority ormeasure the level of consideration that went into its decision,
and here there is no doubt as to which activities Congressintended to regulate. See

ibid.; id., at 233 (Scalia, J., con-curring) (to subject States to suits for money damages, Congress need only make that intent clear, and need not referexplicitly to the Eleventh Amendment);

EEOC v. Wyoming,460 U. S. 226, 243, n. 18 (1983) (Congress need not recite the

constitutional provision that authorizes its action).

II
Applying these principles to the case at hand, we must askwhether Congress could have had a

rational basis for findinga significant (or substantial) connection between gun-related

school violence and interstate commerce. Or, to put thequestion in the language of the explicit finding that Congress
made when it amended this law in 1994: Could Congressrationally have found that "violent crime in school zones,"
through its effect on the "quality of education," significantly(or substantially) affects "interstate" or "foreign commerce"?
18 U. S. C. $$ 922(q)(1)(F), (G). As long as one views thecommerce connection, not as a "technical legal conception,"
but as "a practical one," Swift & Co. v. United States, 196

U. S. 375, 398 (1905) (Holmes, J.), the answer to this questionmust be yes. Numerous reports and studies--generated

both inside and outside government--make clear that Con-gress could reasonably have found the empirical connection
that its law, implicitly or explicitly, asserts. (See Appendix,
infra, at 631, for a sample of the documentation, as well asfor complete citations to the sources referenced below.)

For one thing, reports, hearings, and other readily avail-able literature make clear that the problem of guns in and
around schools is widespread and extremely serious. Thesematerials report, for example, that four percent of American
high school students (and six percent of inner-city high
school students) carry a gun to school at least occasionally,
Centers for Disease Control 2342; Sheley, McGee, & Wright
679; that 12 percent of urban high school students have had
guns fired at them, ibid.; that 20 percent of those students
have been threatened with guns, ibid.; and that, in any 6-
month period, several hundred thousand schoolchildren are
victims of violent crimes in or near their schools, U. S. Dept.
of Justice 1 (1989); House Select Committee Hearing 15
(1989). And, they report that this widespread violence in
schools throughout the Nation significantly interferes with
the quality of education in those schools. See, e. g., House
Judiciary Committee Hearing 44 (1990) (linking school violence to dropout rate); U. S. Dept. of Health 118-119 (1978)
(school-violence victims suffer academically); compare U. S.
Dept. of Justice 1 (1991) (gun violence worst in inner-city
schools), with National Center 47 (dropout rates highest in
inner cities). Based on reports such as these, Congress obviously could have thought that guns and learning are mutually exclusive. Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee Hearing 39 (1993); U. S. Dept. of Health 118, 123-124
(1978). Congress could therefore have found a substantial
educational problem--teachers unable to teach, students unable to learn--and concluded that guns near schools contribute substantially to the size and scope of that problem.

Breyer, J., dissenting
Having found that guns in schools significantly underminethe quality of education in our Nation's classrooms, Congress

could also have found, given the effect of education upon in-terstate and foreign commerce, that gun-related violence in
and around schools is a commercial, as well as a human, problem. Education, although far more than a matter of econom-ics, has long been inextricably intertwined with the Nation's

economy. When this Nation began, most workers receivedtheir education in the workplace, typically (like Benjamin
Franklin) as apprentices. See generally Seybolt; Rora-baugh; U. S. Dept. of Labor (1950). As late as the 1920's,
many workers still received general education directly from
their employers--from large corporations, such as General
Electric, Ford, and Goodyear, which created schools within
their firms to help both the worker and the firm. See Bolino
15-25. (Throughout most of the 19th century fewer than
one percent of all Americans received secondary education
through attending a high school. See id., at 11.) As public
school enrollment grew in the early 20th century, see Becker
218 (1993), the need for industry to teach basic educational
skills diminished. But, the direct economic link between
basic education and industrial productivity remained. Scholars estimate that nearly a quarter of America's economic
growth in the early years of this century is traceable directly
to increased schooling, see Denison 243; that investment in
"human capital" (through spending on education) exceeded
investment in "physical capital" by a ratio of almost two to
one, see Schultz 26 (1961); and that the economic returns to
this investment in education exceeded the returns to conventional capital investment, see, e. g., Davis & Morrall 48-49.

In recent years the link between secondary education and
business has strengthened, becoming both more direct and
more important. Scholars on the subject report that technological changes and innovations in management techniques
have altered the nature of the workplace so that more jobs
now demand greater educational skills. See, e. g., MIT 32

(only about one-third of handtool company's 1,000 workerswere qualified to work with a new process that requires

high-school-level reading and mathematical skills); Cyert &Mowery 68 (gap between wages of high school dropouts and
better trained workers increasing); U. S. Dept. of Labor 41
(1981) ( job openings for dropouts declining over time).There is evidence that "service, manufacturing or construction jobs are being displaced by technology that requires abetter-educated worker or, more likely, are being exported
overseas," Gordon, Ponticell, & Morgan 26; that "workerswith truly few skills by the year 2000 will find that only one
job out of ten will remain," ibid.; and that

"[o]ver the long haul the best way to encourage the
growth of high-wage jobs is to upgrade the skills of thework force. . . . [B]etter-trained workers become more

productive workers, enabling a company to become morecompetitive and expand." Henkoff 60.

Increasing global competition also has made primary andsecondary education economically more important. The
portion of the American economy attributable to interna-tional trade nearly tripled between 1950 and 1980, and more
than 70 percent of American-made goods now compete withimports. Marshall 205; Marshall & Tucker 33. Yet, lagging
worker productivity has contributed to negative trade balances and to real hourly compensation that has fallen belowwages in 10 other industrialized nations. See National Center 57; Handbook of Labor Statistics 561, 576 (1989); Neef &Kask 28, 31. At least some significant part of this serious
productivity problem is attributable to students who emerge
from classrooms without the reading or mathematical skills
necessary to compete with their European or Asian counterparts, see, e. g., MIT 28, and, presumably, to high school dropout rates of 20 to 25 percent (up to 50 percent in inner cities),
see, e. g., National Center 47; Chubb & Hanushek 215. Indeed, Congress has said, when writing other statutes, that

"functionally or technologically illiterate" Americans in thework force "erod[e]" our economic "standing in the international marketplace," Pub. L. 100-418, $ 6002(a)(3), 102 Stat.1469, and that "[o]ur Nation is . . . paying the price of scientific and technological illiteracy, with our productivity declining, our industrial base ailing, and our global competitivenessdwindling," H. R. Rep. No. 98-6, pt. 1, p. 19 (1983).

Finally, there is evidence that, today more than ever, manyfirms base their location decisions upon the presence, or
absence, of a work force with a basic education. See Mac-Cormack, Newman, & Rosenfield 73; Coffee 296. Scholars
on the subject report, for example, that today, "[h]igh speed
communication and transportation make it possible to
produce most products and services anywhere in the world,"
National Center 38; that "[m]odern machinery and production methods can therefore be combined with low wage
workers to drive costs down," ibid.; that managers can perform " `back office functions anywhere in the world now,' "
and say that if they " `can't get enough skilled workers here' "
they will " `move the skilled jobs out of the country,' " id., at
41; with the consequence that "rich countries need better
education and retraining, to reduce the supply of unskilled
workers and to equip them with the skills they require for
tomorrow's jobs," Survey of Global Economy 37. In light of
this increased importance of education to individual firms, it
is no surprise that half of the Nation's manufacturers have
become involved with setting standards and shaping curricula for local schools, Maturi 65-68, that 88 percent think this
kind of involvement is important, id., at 68, that more than
20 States have recently passed educational reforms to attract
new business, Overman 61-62, and that business magazines
have begun to rank cities according to the quality of their
schools, see Boyle 24.

The economic links I have just sketched seem fairly obvious. Why then is it not equally obvious, in light of those
links, that a widespread, serious, and substantial physical

Breyer, J., dissenting
threat to teaching and learning also substantially threatensthe commerce to which that teaching and learning is inextricably tied? That is to say, guns in the hands of six percentof inner-city high school students and gun-related violence
throughout a city's schools must threaten the trade and commerce that those schools support. The only question, then,is whether the latter threat is (to use the majority's terminology) "substantial." The evidence of (1) the extent of thegun-related violence problem, see

supra, at 619, (2) the extent of the resulting negative effect on classroom learning,see

ibid., and (3) the extent of the consequent negative commercial effects, see supra, at 620-622, when taken together,
indicate a threat to trade and commerce that is "substantial."
At the very least, Congress could rationally have concluded
that the links are "substantial."

Specifically, Congress could have found that gun-related
violence near the classroom poses a serious economic threat
(1) to consequently inadequately educated workers who must
endure low paying jobs, see, e. g., National Center 29, and (2)
to communities and businesses that might (in today's "information society") otherwise gain, from a well-educated work
force, an important commercial advantage, see, e. g., Becker
10 (1992), of a kind that location near a railhead or harbor
provided in the past. Congress might also have found these
threats to be no different in kind from other threats that this
Court has found within the commerce power, such as the
threat that loan sharking poses to the "funds" of "numerous
localities," Perez v. United States, 402 U. S., at 157, and that
unfair labor practices pose to instrumentalities of commerce,
see Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U. S. 197, 221-222
(1938). As I have pointed out, supra, at 618, Congress has
written that "the occurrence of violent crime in school zones"
has brought about a "decline in the quality of education" that
"has an adverse impact on interstate commerce and the
foreign commerce of the United States." 18 U. S. C.

Breyer, J., dissenting
tional facts, and the economic facts, taken together, makethis conclusion rational. And, because under our case law,

see supra, at 615-617; infra, at 627-628, the sufficiency ofthe constitutionally necessary Commerce Clause link between a crime of violence and interstate commerce turns
simply upon size or degree, those same facts make the stat-ute constitutional.

To hold this statute constitutional is not to "obliterate" the"distinction between what is national and what is local,"
ante, at 567 (citation omitted; internal quotation marks omit-ted); nor is it to hold that the Commerce Clause permits the
Federal Government to "regulate any activity that it found
was related to the economic productivity of individual citizens," to regulate "marriage, divorce, and child custody," or
to regulate any and all aspects of education. Ante, at 564.
First, this statute is aimed at curbing a particularly acute
threat to the educational process--the possession (and use)
of life-threatening firearms in, or near, the classroom. The
empirical evidence that I have discussed above unmistakably
documents the special way in which guns and education are
incompatible. See supra, at 619. This Court has previously recognized the singularly disruptive potential on
interstate commerce that acts of violence may have. See
Perez, supra, at 156-157. Second, the immediacy of the connection between education and the national economic wellbeing is documented by scholars and accepted by society at
large in a way and to a degree that may not hold true for
other social institutions. It must surely be the rare case,
then, that a statute strikes at conduct that (when considered
in the abstract) seems so removed from commerce, but which
(practically speaking) has so significant an impact upon
commerce.

In sum, a holding that the particular statute before us falls
within the commerce power would not expand the scope of
that Clause. Rather, it simply would apply pre-existing law
to changing economic circumstances. See Heart of Atlanta

Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241, 251 (1964). Itwould recognize that, in today's economic world, gun-related

violence near the classroom makes a significant difference toour economic, as well as our social, well-being. In accordance with well-accepted precedent, such a holding would per-mit Congress "to act in terms of economic . . . realities,"
would interpret the commerce power as "an affirmativepower commensurate with the national needs," and would
acknowledge that the "commerce clause does not operate soas to render the nation powerless to defend itself against
economic forces that Congress decrees inimical or destruc-tive of the national economy."

Swift & Co. v. United States,196 U. S., at 398 (Holmes, J.)).

III
The majority's holding--that $ 922 falls outside the scopeof the Commerce Clause--creates three serious legal problems. First, the majority's holding runs contrary to modernSupreme Court cases that have upheld congressional actions
despite connections to interstate or foreign commerce thatare less significant than the effect of school violence. In
Perez v. United States, supra, the Court held that the Com-merce Clause authorized a federal statute that makes it a
crime to engage in loan sharking ("[e]xtortionate credittransactions") at a local level. The Court said that Congress may judge that such transactions, "though purely
intrastate, . . . affect interstate commerce." 402 U. S., at154 (emphasis added). Presumably, Congress reasoned that

threatening or using force, say with a gun on a street corner,to collect a debt occurs sufficiently often so that the activity
(by helping organized crime) affects commerce among theStates. But, why then cannot Congress also reason that the
threat or use of force--the frequent consequence of possess-ing a gun--in or near a school occurs sufficiently often so
that such activity (by inhibiting basic education) affects

514us3$52Q 05-27-98 16:48:06 PAGES OPINPGT
626 UNITED STATES v. LOPEZ

Breyer, J., dissenting
commerce among the States? The negative impact upon thenational economy of an inability to teach basic skills seems

no smaller (nor less significant) than that of organized crime.In

Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294 (1964), this Court
upheld, as within the commerce power, a statute prohibiting
racial discrimination at local restaurants, in part becausethat discrimination discouraged travel by African Americans

and in part because that discrimination affected purchases offood and restaurant supplies from other States. See

id., at
300; Heart of Atlanta Motel, supra, at 274 (Black, J., concur-ring in

McClung and in Heart of Atlanta). In Daniel v.
Paul, 395 U. S. 298 (1969), this Court found an effect on commerce caused by an amusement park located several miles
down a country road in the middle of Alabama--because
some customers (the Court assumed), some food, 15 paddleboats, and a juke box had come from out of state. See id.,
at 304-305, 308. In both of these cases, the Court understood that the specific instance of discrimination (at a local
place of accommodation) was part of a general practice that,
considered as a whole, caused not only the most serious
human and social harm, but had nationally significant economic dimensions as well. See McClung, supra, at 301;
Daniel, supra, at 307, n. 10. It is difficult to distinguish the
case before us, for the same critical elements are present.
Businesses are less likely to locate in communities where violence plagues the classroom. Families will hesitate to move
to neighborhoods where students carry guns instead of
books. (Congress expressly found in 1994 that "parents may
decline to send their children to school" in certain areas "due
to concern about violent crime and gun violence." 18
U. S. C. $ 922(q)(1)(E).) And (to look at the matter in the
most narrowly commercial manner), interstate publishers
therefore will sell fewer books and other firms will sell fewer
school supplies where the threat of violence disrupts learning. Most importantly, like the local racial discrimination at
issue in McClung and Daniel, the local instances here, taken

627Cite as: 514 U. S. 549 (1995)
Breyer, J., dissenting
together and considered as a whole, create a problem thatcauses serious human and social harm, but also has nationally significant economic dimensions.In

Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942), this Court
sustained the application of the Agricultural Adjustment Act
of 1938 to wheat that Filburn grew and consumed on his ownlocal farm because, considered in its totality, (1) homegrown

wheat may be "induced by rising prices" to "flow into themarket and check price increases," and (2) even if it never
actually enters the market, homegrown wheat nonetheless"supplies a need of the man who grew it which would otherwise be reflected by purchases in the open market" and, in
that sense, "competes with wheat in commerce." Id., at 128.
To find both of these effects on commerce significant in
amount, the Court had to give Congress the benefit of the
doubt. Why would the Court, to find a significant (or "substantial") effect here, have to give Congress any greater leeway? See also United States v. Women's Sportswear Mfrs.
Assn., 336 U. S. 460, 464 (1949) ("If it is interstate commerce
that feels the pinch, it does not matter how local the operation which applies the squeeze"); Mandeville Island Farms,
Inc. v. American Crystal Sugar Co., 334 U. S., at 236 ("[I]t
is enough that the individual activity when multiplied into
a general practice . . . contains a threat to the interstate
economy that requires preventive regulation").

The second legal problem the Court creates comes from
its apparent belief that it can reconcile its holding with
earlier cases by making a critical distinction between "commercial" and noncommercial "transaction[s]." Ante, at 561.
That is to say, the Court believes the Constitution would
distinguish between two local activities, each of which has
an identical effect upon interstate commerce, if one, but not
the other, is "commercial" in nature. As a general matter,
this approach fails to heed this Court's earlier warning not
to turn "questions of the power of Congress" upon "formula[s]" that would give

514us3$52Q 05-27-98 16:48:06 PAGES OPINPGT
628 UNITED STATES v. LOPEZ

Breyer, J., dissenting
"controlling force to nomenclature such as `production'and `indirect' and foreclose consideration of the actual

effects of the activity in question upon interstate com-merce." Wickard, supra, at 120.

See also United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 116-117 (1941)(overturning the Court's distinction between "production"
and "commerce" in the child labor case, Hammer v. Dagen-hart, 247 U. S. 251, 271-272 (1918)); Swift & Co. v. United
States, 196 U. S., at 398 (Holmes, J.) ("[C]ommerce among theStates is not a technical legal conception, but a practical one,
drawn from the course of business"). Moreover, the majori-ty's test is not consistent with what the Court saw as the
point of the cases that the majority now characterizes. Al-though the majority today attempts to categorize

Perez, Mc-Clung, and Wickard as involving intrastate "economic activity," ante, at 559, the Courts that decided each of those casesdid

not focus upon the economic nature of the activity reg-ulated. Rather, they focused upon whether that activity

affected interstate or foreign commerce. In fact, the Wick-ard Court expressly held that Filburn's consumption of
homegrown wheat, "though it may not be regarded as com-merce," could nevertheless be regulated--"whatever its nature"--so long as "it exerts a substantial economic effect oninterstate commerce."

Wickard, supra, at 125 (emphasisadded).

More importantly, if a distinction between commercial andnoncommercial activities is to be made, this is not the case in
which to make it. The majority clearly cannot intend such adistinction to focus narrowly on an act of gun possession
standing by itself, for such a reading could not be reconciledwith either the civil rights cases (

McClung and Daniel) orPerez--in each of those cases the specific transaction (the

race-based exclusion, the use of force) was not itself "com-mercial." And, if the majority instead means to distinguish
generally among broad categories of activities, differentiat-ing what is educational from what is commercial, then, as a

629Cite as: 514 U. S. 549 (1995)
Breyer, J., dissenting
practical matter, the line becomes almost impossible to draw.Schools that teach reading, writing, mathematics, and related

basic skills serve both social and commercial purposes, andone cannot easily separate the one from the other. American industry itself has been, and is again, involved in teaching. See supra, at 620, 622. When, and to what extent,does its involvement make education commercial? Does the

number of vocational classes that train students directly forjobs make a difference? Does it matter if the school is public or private, nonprofit or profit seeking? Does it matter ifa city or State adopts a voucher plan that pays private firms
to run a school? Even if one were to ignore these practical
questions, why should there be a theoretical distinction between education, when it significantly benefits commerce,
and environmental pollution, when it causes economic harm?
See Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn.,
Inc., 452 U. S. 264 (1981).

Regardless, if there is a principled distinction that could
work both here and in future cases, Congress (even in the
absence of vocational classes, industry involvement, and private management) could rationally conclude that schools fall
on the commercial side of the line. In 1990, the year Congress enacted the statute before us, primary and secondary
schools spent $230 billion--that is, nearly a quarter of a trillion dollars--which accounts for a significant portion of our
$5.5 trillion gross domestic product for that year. See Statistical Abstract 147, 442 (1993). The business of schooling
requires expenditure of these funds on student transportation, food and custodial services, books, and teachers'
salaries. See U. S. Dept. of Education 4, 7 (1993). These
expenditures enable schools to provide a valuable service--
namely, to equip students with the skills they need to survive
in life and, more specifically, in the workplace. Certainly,
Congress has often analyzed school expenditure as if it were
a commercial investment, closely analyzing whether schools
are efficient, whether they justify the significant resources

514us3$52Q 05-27-98 16:48:06 PAGES OPINPGT
630 UNITED STATES v. LOPEZ

Breyer, J., dissenting
they spend, and whether they can be restructured to achievegreater returns. See,

e. g., S. Rep. No. 100-222, p. 2 (1987)
(federal school assistance is "a prudent investment"); SenateAppropriations Committee Hearing (1994) (private sector

management of public schools); cf. Chubb & Moe 185-229
(school choice); Hanushek 85-122 (performance based incen-tives for educators); Gibbs (decision in Hartford, Conn., to

contract out public school system). Why could Congress, forCommerce Clause purposes, not consider schools as roughly
analogous to commercial investments from which the Nationderives the benefit of an educated work force?

The third legal problem created by the Court's holding is
that it threatens legal uncertainty in an area of law that,
until this case, seemed reasonably well settled. Congress
has enacted many statutes (more than 100 sections of the
United States Code), including criminal statutes (at least 25
sections), that use the words "affecting commerce" to define
their scope, see, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 844(i) (destruction of buildings used in activity affecting interstate commerce), and
other statutes that contain no jurisdictional language at all,
see, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 922(o)(1) (possession of machineguns).
Do these, or similar, statutes regulate noncommercial activities? If so, would that alter the meaning of "affecting commerce" in a jurisdictional element? Cf. United States v.
Staszcuk, 517 F. 2d 53, 57-58 (CA7 1975) (en banc) (Stevens,
J.) (evaluation of Congress' intent "requires more than a consideration of the consequences of the particular transaction"). More importantly, in the absence of a jurisdictional
element, are the courts nevertheless to take Wickard, 317
U. S., at 127-128, (and later similar cases) as inapplicable, and
to judge the effect of a single noncommercial activity on interstate commerce without considering similar instances of
the forbidden conduct? However these questions are eventually resolved, the legal uncertainty now created will restrict Congress' ability to enact criminal laws aimed at criminal behavior that, considered problem by problem rather

than instance by instance, seriously threatens the economic,as well as social, well-being of Americans.

IV
In sum, to find this legislation within the scope of the Com-merce Clause would permit "Congress . . . to act in terms of

economic . . . realities." North American Co. v. SEC, 327
U. S., at 705 (citing Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U. S.,
at 398 (Holmes, J.)). It would interpret the Clause as this
Court has traditionally interpreted it, with the exception of
one wrong turn subsequently corrected. See Gibbons v.
Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 195 (holding that the commerce power
extends "to all the external concerns of the nation, and to
those internal concerns which affect the States generally");
United States v. Darby, 312 U. S., at 116-117 ("The conclusion is inescapable that Hammer v. Dagenhart [the child
labor case] was a departure from the principles which have
prevailed in the interpretation of the Commerce Clause both
before and since the decision . . . . It should be and now is
overruled"). Upholding this legislation would do no more
than simply recognize that Congress had a "rational basis"
for finding a significant connection between guns in or near
schools and (through their effect on education) the interstate
and foreign commerce they threaten. For these reasons,
I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
Respectfully, I dissent.

NEW YORK STATE CONFERENCE OF BLUE

CROSS & BLUE SHIELD PLANS et al. v.TRAVELERS INSURANCE CO.

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 93-1408. Argued January 18, 1995--Decided April 26, 1995*
A New York statute requires hospitals to collect surcharges from patients

covered by a commercial insurer but not from patients insured by a Blue
Cross/Blue Shield plan, and also subjects certain health maintenance
organizations (HMO's) to surcharges. Several commercial insurers and
their trade associations filed actions against state officials, claiming that

$ 514(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(ERISA)--under which state laws that "relate to" any covered employee benefit plan are superseded--pre-empts the imposition of surcharges on bills of patients whose commercial insurance coverage is purchased by an ERISA plan, and on HMO's insofar as their membership
fees are paid by an ERISA plan. Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans (collectively the Blues) and a hospital association intervened as defendants,
and several HMO's and an HMO conference intervened as plaintiffs.
The District Court consolidated the actions and granted the plaintiffs
summary judgment. The Court of Appeals affirmed, relying on this
Court's decisions in Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S. 85, and
District of Columbia v. Greater Washington Bd. of Trade, 506 U. S. 125,
holding that ERISA's pre-emption clause must be read broadly to reach
any state law having a connection with, or reference to, covered benefit
plans. The court decided that the surcharges were meant to increase
the costs of certain insurance and HMO health care and held that this
purposeful interference with the choices that ERISA plans make for
health care coverage constitutes a "connection with" ERISA plans triggering pre-emption.

Held: New York's surcharge provisions do not "relate to" employee benefit

plans within the meaning of $ 514(a) and, thus, are not pre-empted.
Pp. 654-668.

*Together with No. 93-1414, Pataki, Governor of New York, et al. v.
Travelers Insurance Co. et al., and No. 93-1415, Hospital Association of
New York State v. Travelers Insurance Co. et al., also on certiorari to the
same court.

646 NEW YORK STATE CONFERENCE OF BLUE CROSS &

BLUE SHIELD PLANS v. TRAVELERS INS. CO.

Syllabus

(a) Under Shaw, supra, the provisions "relate to" ERISA plans if
they have a "connection with," or make "reference to," the plans. They
clearly make no reference to ERISA plans, and ERISA's text is unhelpful in determining whether they have a "connection with" them. Thus,
the Court must look to ERISA's objectives as a guide to the scope of
the state law that Congress understood would survive. Pp. 654-656.

(b) The basic thrust of the pre-emption clause was to avoid a multiplicity of regulation in order to permit the nationally uniform administration of employee benefit plans. Thus, ERISA pre-empts state laws
that mandate employee benefit structures or their administration as
well as those that provide alternative enforcement mechanisms. The
purpose and effects of New York's statute are quite different, however.
The principal reason for charge differentials is that the Blues provide
coverage to many subscribers whom the commercial insurers would reject. Since the differentials make the Blues more attractive, they have
an indirect economic effect on choices made by insurance buyers, including ERISA plans. However, an indirect economic influence does not
bind plan administrators to any particular choice or preclude uniform
administrative practice or the provision of a uniform interstate benefit
package. It simply bears on the costs of benefits and the relative costs
of competing insurance to provide them. Cost uniformity almost certainly is not an object of pre-emption. Rate differentials are common
even in the absence of state action, and therefore it is unlikely that
ERISA meant to bar such indirect influences under state law. The
existence of other common state actions with indirect economic effects
on a plan's cost--such as quality control standards and workplace regulation--leaves the intent to pre-empt even less likely, since such laws
would have to be superseded as well. New York's surcharges leave
plan administrators where they would be in any case, with the responsibility to choose the best overall coverage for the money, and thus they
do not bear the requisite "connection with" ERISA plans to trigger
pre-emption. Pp. 656-662.

(c) This conclusion is confirmed by the decision in Mackey v. Lanier
Collection Agency & Service, Inc., 486 U. S. 825, that ERISA preemption falls short of barring application of general state garnishment
statutes to participants' benefits in the hands of an ERISA plan. And
New York's surcharges do not impose the kind of substantive coverage
requirement binding plan administrators that was at issue in Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724, since they do not require plans to deal with only one insurer or to insure against an entire
category of illnesses the plans might otherwise choose not to cover.
Pp. 662-664.

Syllabus
(d) Any conclusion other than the one drawn here would have the
unsettling result of barring any state regulation of hospital costs on the
theory that all laws with indirect economic effects on ERISA plans are
pre-empted. However, there is no hint in ERISA's legislative history
or elsewhere that Congress intended to squelch the efforts of several
States that were regulating hospital charges to some degree at the time
ERISA was passed. Moreover, such a broad interpretation of $ 514
would have rendered nugatory an entire federal statute--enacted after
ERISA by the same Congress--that gave comprehensive aid to state
health care rate regulation. Pp. 664-667.

(e) In reaching this decision, the Court does not hold that ERISA
pre-empts only direct regulation of ERISA plans. It is possible that a
state law might produce such acute, albeit indirect, economic effects
as to force an ERISA plan to adopt a certain scheme of coverage or
effectively restrict its choice of insurers, but such is not the case here.
P. 668.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
A New York statute requires hospitals to collect sur-charges from patients covered by a commercial insurer but

not from patients insured by a Blue Cross/Blue Shield plan,and it subjects certain health maintenance organizations
(HMO's) to surcharges that vary with the number of Medic-aid recipients each enrolls. N. Y. Pub. Health Law $ 2807-c
(McKinney 1993). These cases call for us to decide whetherthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(ERISA), 88 Stat. 829, as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 1001 et seq.(1988 ed. and Supp. V), pre-empts the state provisions for
surcharges on bills of patients whose commercial insurancecoverage is purchased by employee health-care plans governed by ERISA, and for surcharges on HMO's insofar astheir membership fees are paid by an ERISA plan. We hold
that the provisions for surcharges do not "relate to" em-ployee benefit plans within the meaning of ERISA's preemption provision, $ 514(a), 29 U. S. C. $ 1144(a), and accord-ingly suffer no pre-emption.

scheme calls for patients to be charged not for the cost oftheir individual treatment, but for the average cost of treating the patient's medical problem, as classified under one oranother of 794 Diagnostic Related Groups (DRG's). The

Opinion of the Court

charges allowable in accordance with DRG classifications areadjusted for a specific hospital to reflect its particular operating costs, capital investments, bad debts, costs of charitycare, and the like.

Patients with Blue Cross/Blue Shield coverage, Medicaidpatients, and HMO participants are billed at a hospital's
DRG rate. N. Y. Pub. Health Law $ 2807-c(1)(a); see alsoBrief for Petitioners Pataki et al. 4.

3 Others, however, are

not. Patients served by commercial insurers providing in-patient hospital coverage on an expense-incurred basis, by

self-insured funds directly reimbursing hospitals, and by cer-tain workers' compensation, volunteer firefighters' benefit,
ambulance workers' benefit, and no-fault motor vehicle insur-ance funds, must be billed at the DRG rate plus a 13% surcharge to be retained by the hospital. N. Y. Pub. HealthLaw $ 2807-c(1)(b). For the year ending March 31, 1993,
moreover, hospitals were required to bill commercially in-sured patients for a further 11% surcharge to be turned over
to the State, with the result that these patients were charged24% more than the DRG rate. $ 2807-c(11)(i).

New York law also imposes a surcharge on HMO's, whichvaries depending on the number of eligible Medicaid recipients an HMO has enrolled, but which may run as high as9% of the aggregate monthly charges paid by an HMO for
its members' in-patient hospital care. $$ 2807-c(2-a)(a) to(2-a)(e). This assessment is not an increase in the rates to

ticipants or their beneficiaries "through the purchase ofinsurance or otherwise." $ 3(1), 29 U. S. C. $ 1002(1). The

federal statute does not go about protecting plan participantsand their beneficiaries by requiring employers to provide any
given set of minimum benefits, but instead controls the ad-ministration of benefit plans, see $ 2, 29 U. S. C. $ 1001(b), as

Section 514(a) provides that ERISA "shall supersede anyand all State laws insofar as they . . . relate to any employee

itself limited, however, by the provision that an employeewelfare benefit plan may not "be deemed to be an insurance company or other insurer . . . or to be engaged in thebusiness of insurance . . . ." $ 514(b)(2)(B), 29 U. S. C.

Opinion of the Court

9% surcharge statutes. The New York State Conference ofBlue Cross and Blue Shield plans, Empire Blue Cross and

Blue Shield (collectively the Blues), and the Hospital Associa-tion of New York State intervened as defendants, and the
New York State Health Maintenance Organization Confer-ence and several HMO's intervened as plaintiffs. The District Court consolidated the actions and granted summaryjudgment to the plaintiffs.

Travelers Ins. Co. v. Cuomo, 813F. Supp. 996 (SDNY 1993). The court found that although

the surcharges "do not directly increase a plan's costs or [a]f-fect the level of benefits to be offered" there could be "little
doubt that the [s]urcharges at issue will have a significanteffect on the commercial insurers and HMOs which do or
could provide coverage for ERISA plans and thus lead, atleast indirectly, to an increase in plan costs."

Id., at 1003(footnote omitted). It found that the "entire justification for

the [s]urcharges is premised on that exact result--that the[s]urcharges will increase the cost of obtaining medical insurance through any source other than the Blues to a sufficientextent that customers will switch their coverage to and ensure the economic viability of the Blues." Ibid. (footnoteomitted). The District Court concluded that this effect on
choices by ERISA plans was enough to trigger pre-emptionunder $ 514(a) and that the surcharges were not saved by

$ 514(b) as regulating insurance. Id., at 1003-1008. TheDistrict Court accordingly enjoined enforcement of "those
surcharges against any commercial insurers or HMOs in con-nection with their coverage of . . . ERISA plans." Id., at
1012.4

4 The District Court and the Court of Appeals both held that the injunctive remedy was not prohibited by the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U. S. C.

$ 1341, which provides that federal district courts "shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment . . . of any tax under State law where a
plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State."
Although these courts considered the surcharges to be taxes, they found
no "plain, speedy and efficient remedy" to exist in state court, since
ERISA $ 502(e), 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(e)(1) (1988 ed., Supp. V), divests state
courts of jurisdiction over such claims. See 813 F. Supp., at 1000-1001;

Opinion of the Court
The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, rely-ing on our decisions in Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463

U. S. 85 (1983), and District of Columbia v. Greater Wash-ington Bd. of Trade, 506 U. S. 125 (1992), holding that
ERISA's pre-emption clause must be read broadly to reachany state law having a connection with, or reference to, covered employee benefit plans. Travelers Ins. Co. v. Cuomo,14 F. 3d 708, 718 (1994). In the light of our decision in
Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U. S. 133, 141 (1990),the Court of Appeals abandoned its own prior decision in
Rebaldo v. Cuomo, 749 F. 2d 133, 137 (1984), cert. denied,472 U. S. 1008 (1985), which had drawn upon the definition of
the term "State" in ERISA $ 514(c)(2), 29 U. S. C. $ 1144(c)(2),to conclude that "a state law must `purpor[t] to regulate . . .
the terms and conditions of employee benefit plans' to fallwithin the preemption provision" of ERISA. 14 F. 3d, at
719 (internal quotation marks omitted). Rejecting thatnarrower approach to ERISA pre-emption, it relied on
our statement in Ingersoll-Rand that under the applicable" `broad common-sense meaning,' a state law may `relate to'
a benefit plan, and thereby be pre-empted, even if the law isnot specifically designed to affect such plans, or the effect is
only indirect." 498 U. S., at 139; see 14 F. 3d, at 718.
Travelers Ins. Co. v. Cuomo, 14 F. 3d 708, 713-714 (CA2 1994). Neither
party challenges this conclusion and we have no occasion to examine it.

Nor do we address the surcharge statute insofar as it applies to selfinsured funds. The trial court's ERISA analysis originally led it to enjoin
defendants "from enforcing those surcharges against any commercial insurers or HMOs in connection with their coverage of . . . ERISA plans,"
without any further mention of self-insured funds. 813 F. Supp., at 1012.
After staying its decision as to the 13% surcharge pending appeal, see id.,
at 1012-1015, it ordered all named parties, including the Travelers Insurance Company (which served as fiduciary to a self-insured plan), to pay
that surcharge whenever required by state law, see Travelers Ins. Co. v.
New York State Health Maintenance Conference, No. 92 Civ. 3999 (SDNY
Apr. 27, 1993), reprinted in Brief for National Carriers' Conference Committee as Amicus Curiae 29a-31a. The Court of Appeals, in turn, did
not expressly address this application of the surcharge and, accordingly,
we leave it for consideration on remand.

654 NEW YORK STATE CONFERENCE OF BLUE CROSS &

BLUE SHIELD PLANS v. TRAVELERS INS. CO.

Opinion of the Court

The Court of Appeals agreed with the trial court that thesurcharges were meant to increase the costs of certain insurance and health care by HMO's, and held that this "purpose-[ful] interfer[ence] with the choices that ERISA plans make
for health care coverage . . . is sufficient to constitute [a]`connection with' ERISA plans" triggering pre-emption.
Id., at 719. The court's conclusion, in sum, was that "thethree surcharges `relate to' ERISA because they impose a
significant economic burden on commercial insurers andHMOs" and therefore "have an impermissible impact on
ERISA plan structure and administration." Id., at 721. Inthe light of its conclusion that the surcharge statutes were
not otherwise saved by any applicable exception, the courtheld them pre-empted. Id., at 723. It recognized the apparent conflict between its conclusion and the decision of theThird Circuit in United Wire, Metal and Machine Health
and Welfare Fund v. Morristown Memorial Hosp., 995 F. 2d1179, 1191, cert. denied, 510 U. S. 944 (1993), which held that
New Jersey's similar ratesetting statute "does not relate tothe plans in a way that triggers ERISA's preemption clause."
See 14 F. 3d, at 721, n. 3. We granted certiorari to resolvethis conflict, 513 U. S. 920 (1994), and now reverse and
remand. II

Our past cases have recognized that the SupremacyClause, U. S. Const., Art. VI, may entail pre-emption of state
law either by express provision, by implication, or by a con-flict between federal and state law. See

Pacific Gas & Elec.Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Comm'n, 461 U. S. 190, 203-204 (1983); Rice v. Santa
Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947). And yet, de-spite the variety of these opportunities for federal preeminence, we have never assumed lightly that Congress has der-ogated state regulation, but instead have addressed claims
of pre-emption with the starting presumption that Congressdoes not intend to supplant state law. See Maryland v.

Opinion of the Court
Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 746 (1981). Indeed, in cases likethis one, where federal law is said to bar state action in fields

of traditional state regulation, see Hillsborough County v.
Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U. S. 707, 719
(1985), we have worked on the "assumption that the historic
police powers of the States were not to be superseded by theFederal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose

of Congress." Rice, supra, at 230. See, e. g., Cipollone v.
Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, 516 (1992); id., at 532-533
(Blackmun, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment inpart, and dissenting in part);

Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v.
Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724, 740 (1985); Jones v. Rath Packing Co., 430 U. S. 519 (1977); Napier v. Atlantic Coast Line
R. Co., 272 U. S. 605, 611 (1926).

Since pre-emption claims turn on Congress's intent, Cipollone, supra, at 516; Shaw, supra, at 95, we begin as we do in
any exercise of statutory construction with the text of the
provision in question, and move on, as need be, to the structure and purpose of the Act in which it occurs. See, e. g.,
Ingersoll-Rand, supra, at 138. The governing text of
ERISA is clearly expansive. Section 514(a) marks for preemption "all state laws insofar as they . . . relate to any
employee benefit plan" covered by ERISA, and one might be
excused for wondering, at first blush, whether the words of
limitation ("insofar as they . . . relate") do much limiting. If
"relate to" were taken to extend to the furthest stretch of
its indeterminacy, then for all practical purposes pre-emption
would never run its course, for "[r]eally, universally, relations
stop nowhere," H. James, Roderick Hudson xli (New York
ed., World's Classics 1980). But that, of course, would be to
read Congress's words of limitation as mere sham, and to
read the presumption against pre-emption out of the law
whenever Congress speaks to the matter with generality.
That said, we have to recognize that our prior attempt to
construe the phrase "relate to" does not give us much help
drawing the line here.

656 NEW YORK STATE CONFERENCE OF BLUE CROSS &

BLUE SHIELD PLANS v. TRAVELERS INS. CO.

Opinion of the Court

In Shaw, we explained that "[a] law `relates to' an employee benefit plan, in the normal sense of the phrase, if it
has a connection with or reference to such a plan." 463
U. S., at 96-97. The latter alternative, at least, can be ruled
out. The surcharges are imposed upon patients and HMO's,
regardless of whether the commercial coverage or membership, respectively, is ultimately secured by an ERISA plan,
private purchase, or otherwise, with the consequence that
the surcharge statutes cannot be said to make "reference to"
ERISA plans in any manner. Cf. Greater Washington Bd.
of Trade, 506 U. S., at 130 (striking down District of Columbia law that "specifically refers to welfare benefit plans regulated by ERISA and on that basis alone is pre-empted").
But this still leaves us to question whether the surcharge
laws have a "connection with" the ERISA plans, and here an
uncritical literalism is no more help than in trying to construe "relate to." For the same reasons that infinite relations cannot be the measure of pre-emption, neither can infinite connections. We simply must go beyond the unhelpful
text and the frustrating difficulty of defining its key term,
and look instead to the objectives of the ERISA statute as a
guide to the scope of the state law that Congress understood
would survive.

A

As we have said before, $ 514 indicates Congress's intent
to establish the regulation of employee welfare benefit plans
"as exclusively a federal concern." Alessi v. RaybestosManhattan, Inc., 451 U. S. 504, 523 (1981). We have found
that in passing $ 514(a), Congress intended

"to ensure that plans and plan sponsors would be subject
to a uniform body of benefits law; the goal was to minimize the administrative and financial burden of complying with conflicting directives among States or between
States and the Federal Government . . . , [and to prevent]
the potential for conflict in substantive law . . . requiring

Opinion of the Court
the tailoring of plans and employer conduct to the pecu-liarities of the law of each jurisdiction." IngersollRand, 498 U. S., at 142.
This objective was described in the House of Representa-tives by a sponsor of the Act, Representative Dent, as being

to "eliminat[e] the threat of conflicting and inconsistent Stateand local regulation." 120 Cong. Rec. 29197 (1974). Senator Williams made the same point, that "with the narrowexceptions specified in the bill, the substantive and enforcement provisions . . . are intended to preempt the field forFederal regulations, thus eliminating the threat of conflicting
or inconsistent State and local regulation of employee benefitplans." Id., at 29933. The basic thrust of the pre-emption
clause, then, was to avoid a multiplicity of regulation in orderto permit the nationally uniform administration of employee
benefit plans.Accordingly in

Shaw, for example, we had no trouble find-ing that New York's "Human Rights Law, which prohibit[ed]

employers from structuring their employee benefit plans ina manner that discriminate[d] on the basis of pregnancy, and
[New York's] Disability Benefits Law, which require[d] em-ployers to pay employees specific benefits, clearly `relate[d]
to' benefit plans." 463 U. S., at 97. These mandates affect-ing coverage could have been honored only by varying the
subjects of a plan's benefits whenever New York law mighthave applied, or by requiring every plan to provide all beneficiaries with a benefit demanded by New York law if NewYork law could have been said to require it for any one beneficiary. Similarly, Pennsylvania's law that prohibited "plansfrom . . . requiring reimbursement [from the beneficiary] in
the event of recovery from a third party" related to em-ployee benefit plans within the meaning of $ 514(a). FMC
Corp. v. Holliday, 498 U. S. 52, 60 (1990). The law "prohib-it[ed] plans from being structured in a manner requiring reimbursement in the event of recovery from a third party"and "require[d] plan providers to calculate benefit levels in

Opinion of the Court

Pennsylvania based on expected liability conditions that dif-fer from those in States that have not enacted similar antisubrogation legislation," thereby "frustrat[ing] plan adminis-trators' continuing obligation to calculate uniform benefit
levels nationwide." Ibid. Pennsylvania employees who re-covered in negligence actions against tortfeasors would, by
virtue of the state law, in effect have been entitled to benefitsin excess of what plan administrators intended to provide,
and in excess of what the plan provided to employees inother States. Along the same lines, New Jersey could not
prohibit plans from setting workers' compensation paymentsoff against employees' retirement benefits or pensions, because doing so would prevent plans from using a method ofcalculating benefits permitted by federal law. Alessi, supra,
at 524. In each of these cases, ERISA pre-empted statelaws that mandated employee benefit structures or their
administration. Elsewhere, we have held that state lawsproviding alternative enforcement mechanisms also relate
to ERISA plans, triggering pre-emption. See IngersollRand, supra. B

Both the purpose and the effects of the New York sur-charge statute distinguish it from the examples just given.
The charge differentials have been justified on the groundthat the Blues pay the hospitals promptly and efficiently and,
more importantly, provide coverage for many subscriberswhom the commercial insurers would reject as unacceptable
risks. The Blues' practice, called open enrollment, has con-sistently been cited as the principal reason for charge differentials, whether the differentials resulted from voluntary ne-gotiation between hospitals and payers as was the case prior
to the NYPHRM system, or were created by the surchargesas is the case now. See,

e. g., Charge Differential AnalysisCommittee, New York State Hospital Review and Planning

Setting Work? The Case of the New York Prospective Hos-pital Reimbursement Methodology, 12 J. Health Politics, Policy, & Law 391, 402 (1987).5 Since the surcharges are pre-sumably passed on at least in part to those who purchase
commercial insurance or HMO membership, their effects fol-low from their purpose. Although there is no evidence that
the surcharges will drive every health insurance consumerto the Blues, they do make the Blues more attractive (or
less unattractive) as insurance alternatives and thus have anindirect economic effect on choices made by insurance buyers, including ERISA plans.An indirect economic influence, however, does not bind
plan administrators to any particular choice and thus func-tion as a regulation of an ERISA plan itself; commercial insurers and HMO's may still offer more attractive packages

5 Although respondents argue that the surcharges have become superfluous now that all insurers have become subject to certain open enrollment requirements, see Brief for Respondents Travelers Insurance Co. et
al. 6-7, n. 5; 1992 N. Y. Laws, ch. 501, $ 4 (effective Apr. 1, 1993), N. Y. Ins.
Law $ 3231 (McKinney Supp. 1995), it is not our responsibility to review
the continuing substantive rationale for the surcharges. Even so, the surcharges may well find support in an effort to compensate the Blues for the
current makeup of their insurance pool, which presumably continues to
reflect their longer history of open enrollment policies. See J. Corcoran,
Superintendent of Insurance, Position Paper of New York State Insurance
Department on Inpatient Reimbursement Rate Differential Provided
Non-Profit Insurers 8 (1984) (J. A. CA2, at 679) ("If there is any possibility
of an abrupt abandonment of the current hospital discount, consideration
should be given to the past history of health insurance enrollment in New
York which has left the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans with a core of uninsurables obtained over the years and the ongoing liability resulting from
that enrollment").

Opinion of the Court

than the Blues. Nor does the indirect influence of the sur-charges preclude uniform administrative practice or the provision of a uniform interstate benefit package if a plan wishesto provide one. It simply bears on the costs of benefits and
the relative costs of competing insurance to provide them.
It is an influence that can affect a plan's shopping decisions,but it does not affect the fact that any plan will shop for the

best deal it can get, surcharges or no surcharges.There is, indeed, nothing remarkable about surcharges on
hospital bills, or their effects on overall cost to the plans andthe relative attractiveness of certain insurers. Rate variations among hospital providers are accepted examples of cost
variation, since hospitals have traditionally "attempted to
compensate for their financial shortfalls by adjusting their
price . . . schedules for patients with commercial health insurance." Thorpe, 12 J. Health Politics, Policy, & Law, at
394. Charge differentials for commercial insurers, even
prior to state regulation, "varied dramatically across regions, ranging from 13 to 36 percent," presumably reflecting
the geographically disparate burdens of providing for the uninsured. Id., at 400; see id., at 398-399; see also, e. g., Trussell 170 (J. A. CA2, at 664); Bobinski, Unhealthy Federalism:
Barriers to Increasing Health Care Access for the Uninsured, 24 U. C. D. L. Rev. 255, 267, and n. 44 (1990).

If the common character of rate differentials even in the
absence of state action renders it unlikely that ERISA preemption was meant to bar such indirect economic influences
under state law, the existence of other common state action
with indirect economic effects on a plan's costs leaves the
intent to pre-empt even less likely. Quality standards, for
example, set by the State in one subject area of hospital
services but not another would affect the relative cost of
providing those services over others and, so, of providing
different packages of health insurance benefits. Even basic
regulation of employment conditions will invariably affect
the cost and price of services.

661Cite as: 514 U. S. 645 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
Quality control and workplace regulation, to be sure, arepresumably less likely to affect premium differentials among

competing insurers, but that does not change the fact thatsuch state regulation will indirectly affect what an ERISA
or other plan can afford or get for its money. Thus, in the
absence of a more exact guide to intended pre-emption than$ 514, it is fair to conclude that mandates for rate differentials

would not be pre-empted unless other regulation with indi-rect effects on plan costs would be superseded as well. The
bigger the package of regulation with indirect effects thatwould fall on the respondents' reading of $ 514, the less likely
it is that federal regulation of benefit plans was intended to
eliminate state regulation of health care costs.

Indeed, to read the pre-emption provision as displacing all
state laws affecting costs and charges on the theory that they
indirectly relate to ERISA plans that purchase insurance
policies or HMO memberships that would cover such services would effectively read the limiting language in $ 514(a)
out of the statute, a conclusion that would violate basic principles of statutory interpretation and could not be squared
with our prior pronouncement that "[p]re-emption does not
occur . . . if the state law has only a tenuous, remote, or
peripheral connection with covered plans, as is the case with
many laws of general applicability." District of Columbia
v. Greater Washington Bd. of Trade, 506 U. S., at 130, n. 1
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). While
Congress's extension of pre-emption to all "state laws relating to benefit plans" was meant to sweep more broadly than
"state laws dealing with the subject matters covered by
ERISA[,] reporting, disclosure, fiduciary responsibility, and
the like," Shaw, 463 U. S., at 98, and n. 19, nothing in the
language of the Act or the context of its passage indicates
that Congress chose to displace general health care regulation, which historically has been a matter of local concern, see Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U. S., at 719; 1 B. Furrow, T. Greaney,

BLUE SHIELD PLANS v. TRAVELERS INS. CO.

Opinion of the Court

S. Johnson, T. Jost, & R. Schwartz, Health Law $$ 1-6, 1-23(1995).

In sum, cost uniformity was almost certainly not an objectof pre-emption, just as laws with only an indirect economic
effect on the relative costs of various health insurance pack-ages in a given State are a far cry from those "conflicting
directives" from which Congress meant to insulate ERISAplans. See 498 U. S., at 142. Such state laws leave plan
administrators right where they would be in any case, withthe responsibility to choose the best overall coverage for the
money. We therefore conclude that such state laws do notbear the requisite "connection with" ERISA plans to trigger pre-emption. C

This conclusion is confirmed by our decision in Mackey v.
Lanier Collection Agency & Service, Inc., 486 U. S. 825(1988), which held that ERISA pre-emption falls short of

barring application of a general state garnishment statuteto participants' benefits in the hands of an ERISA welfare
benefit plan. We took no issue with the argument of the
Mackey plan's trustees that garnishment would impose ad-ministrative costs and burdens upon benefit plans, id., at 831,

but concluded from the text and structure of ERISA's pre-emption and enforcement provisions that "Congress did not
intend to forbid the use of state-law mechanisms of executingjudgments against ERISA welfare benefit plans, even when
those mechanisms prevent plan participants from receivingtheir benefits."

Id., at 831-832. If a law authorizing anindirect source of administrative cost is not pre-empted, it

should follow that a law operating as an indirect source ofmerely economic influence on administrative decisions, as
here, should not suffice to trigger pre-emption either.The commercial challengers counter by invoking the earlier case of Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471U. S. 724 (1985), which considered whether a State could
mandate coverage of specified minimum mental-health-care

Opinion of the Court
benefits by policies insuring against hospital and surgicalexpenses. Because the regulated policies included those

bought by employee welfare benefit plans, we recognizedthat the law "directly affected" such plans.

Id., at 732.
Although we went on to hold that the law was ultimately
saved from pre-emption by the insurance saving clause,$ 514(b)(2)(A), 29 U. S. C. $ 1144(b)(2)(A), respondents proffer

the first steps in our decision as support for their argumentthat all laws affecting ERISA plans through their impact on
insurance policies "relate to" such plans and are pre-emptedunless expressly saved by the statute. The challengers take
Metropolitan Life too far, however.

The Massachusetts statute applied not only to " `[a]ny blanket or general policy of insurance . . . or any policy of accident
and sickness insurance' " but also to " `any employees' health
and welfare fund which provide[d] hospital expense and surgical expense benefits.' " 471 U. S., at 730, n. 11. In fact,
the State did not even try to defend its law as unrelated to
employee benefit plans for the purpose of $ 514(a). Id., at
739. As a result, there was no reason to distinguish with
any precision between the effects on insurers that are sufficiently connected with employee benefit plans to "relate to"
the plans and those effects that are not. It was enough to
address the distinction bluntly, saying on the one hand that
laws like the one in Metropolitan Life relate to plans since
they "bea[r] indirectly but substantially on all insured benefit
plans, . . . requir[ing] them to purchase the mental-health
benefits specified in the statute when they purchase a certain
kind of common insurance policy," ibid., but saying on the
other that "laws that regulate only the insurer, or the way
in which it may sell insurance, do not `relate to' benefit
plans," id., at 741. Even this basic distinction recognizes
that not all regulations that would influence the cost of insurance would relate to employee benefit plans within the meaning of $ 514(a). If, for example, a State were to regulate
sales of insurance by commercial insurers more stringently

Opinion of the Court

than sales by insurers not for profit, the relative cost of com-mercial insurance would rise; we would nonetheless say, following Metropolitan Life, that such laws "do not `relate to'benefit plans in the first instance." Ibid. And on the same
authority we would say the same about the basic tax exemp-tion enjoyed by nonprofit insurers like the Blues since the
days long before ERISA, see Marmor, New York's BlueCross and Blue Shield, 1934-1990: The Complicated Politics
of Nonprofit Regulation, 16 J. Health Politics, Policy, & Law761, 769 (1991) (tracing New York Blue Cross's special tax
treatment as a prepayment organization back to 1934); 1934N. Y. Laws, ch. 595; and yet on respondents' theory the exemption would necessarily be pre-empted as affecting insur-ance prices and plan costs.

In any event, Metropolitan Life cannot carry the weightthe commercial insurers would place on it. The New York
surcharges do not impose the kind of substantive coveragerequirement binding plan administrators that was at issue in
Metropolitan Life. Although even in the absence of man-dated coverage there might be a point at which an exorbitant
tax leaving consumers with a Hobson's choice would betreated as imposing a substantive mandate, no showing has
been made here that the surcharges are so prohibitive as toforce all health insurance consumers to contract with the
Blues. As they currently stand, the surcharges do not re-quire plans to deal with only one insurer, or to insure against
an entire category of illnesses they might otherwise chooseto leave without coverage.

D
It remains only to speak further on a point already raised,
that any conclusion other than the one we draw would barany state regulation of hospital costs. The basic DRG system (even without any surcharge), like any other interfer-ence with the hospital services market, would fall on a theory that all laws with indirect economic effects on ERISA

Opinion of the Court
plans are pre-empted under $ 514(a). This would be an unsettling result and all the more startling because several
States, including New York, regulated hospital charges to
one degree or another at the time ERISA was passed, see,
e. g., Cal. Ins. Code Ann. $ 11505 (West 1972) (nonprofit hospitals); Colo. Rev. Stat. $$ 10-16-130, 10-17-108(2) to 108(3),
10-17-119(b) (1973); Conn. Gen. Stat. $$ 33-166, 33-172 (medical service corporations), $ 33-179k (health care centers)
(1975); Md. Ann. Code, Art. 43, $$ 568H, 568U, 568W (Michie
Supp. 1976); Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 176A, $$ 5, 6 (West
1958), as amended by 1968 Mass. Acts, ch. 432, $ 2, and 1969
Mass. Acts, ch. 874, $ 1 (hospital service corporations), Mass.
Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 176B, $ 4 (West 1958 and Supp. 1987)
(medical service corporations); Health Maintenance Organization Act, 1973 N. J. Laws, ch. 337, $ 8, N. J. Stat. Ann.

$ 26:2J-8(b) (West Supp. 1986); N. Y. Pub. Health Law $ 2807
(McKinney 1971); 1973 Wash. Laws, ch. 5, $ 15, Rev. Code
Wash. Ann. $ 70.39.140 (West 1975). And yet there is not so
much as a hint in ERISA's legislative history or anywhere
else that Congress intended to squelch these state efforts.

Even more revealing is the National Health Planning and
Resources Development Act of 1974 (NHPRDA), Pub. L. 93-
641, 88 Stat. 2225, $$ 1-3, repealed by Pub. L. 99-660, title
VII, $ 701(a), 100 Stat. 3799, which was adopted by the same
Congress that passed ERISA, and only months later. The
NHPRDA sought to encourage and help fund state responses
to growing health care costs and the widely diverging availability of health services. $ 2, 88 Stat. 2226-2227; see generally National Gerimedical Hospital and Gerontology Center

It provided for the organization and partial funding of regional "health systems agencies" responsible for gathering
data as well as for planning and developing health resources
in designated health service areas. 88 Stat. 2229-2242.

development agencies in qualifying States to coordinatedevelopment of health services policy. Id., at 2242-2244.

These state agencies, too, would be eligible for federal fund-ing, id., at 2249, including grants "[f]or the purpose of demonstrating the effectiveness of State Agencies regulatingrates for the provision of health care . . . within the State."
Ibid. Exemption from ERISA pre-emption is nowherementioned as a prerequisite to the receipt of such funding;
indeed, the only legal prerequisite to be eligible for rate reg-ulation grants was "satisfactory evidence that the State
Agency has under State law the authority to carry out rateregulation functions in accordance with this section . . . ."
Ibid.The Secretary was required to provide technical assistance
to the designated agencies by promulgating "[a] uniform sys-tem for calculating rates to be charged to health insurers
and other health institutions payors by health service in-stitutions." Id., at 2254. Although the NHPRDA placed
substantive restrictions on the system the Secretary couldestablish, the subject matter (and therefore the scope of
envisioned state regulation) covers the same ground thatNew York's surcharges tread. The Secretary's system was
supposed to:

"(A) [b]e based on an all-inclusive rate for variouscategories of patients . . . [,]

"(B) [p]rovide that such rates reflect the true cost ofproviding services to each such category of patients
. . . [,]"(C) [p]rovide for an appropriate application of such
system in the different types of institutions . . . [, and]

"(D) [p]rovide that differences in rates to variousclasses of purchasers (including health insurers, direct

service payors, and other health institution payors) bebased on justified and documented differences in the
costs of operation of health service institutions made

possible by the actions of such purchasers." Id., at2254-2255.

The last-quoted subsection seems to envision a systemvery much like the one New York put in place, but the
significant point in any event is that the statute's provisionfor comprehensive aid to state health care rate regulation
is simply incompatible with pre-emption of the same byERISA. To interpret ERISA's pre-emption provision as
broadly as respondents suggest would have rendered theentire NHPRDA utterly nugatory, since it would have left
States without the authority to do just what Congress wasexpressly trying to induce them to do by enacting the
NHPRDA. Given that the NHPRDA was enacted afterERISA and by the same Congress, it just makes good sense
to reject such an interpretation.6

6 The history of Medicare regulation makes the same point, confirming
that Congress never envisioned ERISA pre-emption as blocking state
health care cost control, but rather meant to encourage and rely on state
experimentation like New York's. See generally K. Davis, G. Anderson,
D. Rowland, & E. Steinberg, Health Care Cost Containment 23-25, 81, 99
(1990). Since the time DRG systems were tried out in the 1960's and
1970's, Congress has consistently shown its awareness and encouragement
of controlled payment alternatives to the federal regulatory scheme. The
Social Security Amendments of 1967, Pub. L. 90-248, $ 402(a), 81 Stat.
930-931, as amended 42 U. S. C. $ 1395b-1, for example, granted the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (now Health and Human Services)
the authority to waive Medicare rules to allow for physician and hospital
reimbursement according to approved state payment schedules. In the
Social Security Amendments of 1972, Pub. L. 92-603, $ 222(a)(5), 86 Stat.
1391, Congress specifically called upon the Secretary to report on prospective reimbursement schemes that had been thus favored already or could
be in the future. Later on, after the development of all-payor ratesetting
schemes like the NYPHRM and New Jersey's Health Care Cost Reduction
Act of 1978, 1978 N. J. Laws, ch. 83, Congress's Medicare waiver provisions
evolved to the point of explicit reference to a State's commitment to apply
its hospital reimbursement control system to a substantial portion of hospitals and inpatient services statewide. See 42 U. S. C. $$ 1395ww(c)(1),
(c)(5)(A). Indeed, in its Report on the Social Security Amendments of

Opinion of the Court

That said, we do not hold today that ERISA pre-emptsonly direct regulation of ERISA plans, nor could we do that

with fidelity to the views expressed in our prior opinions onthe matter. See,

e. g., Ingersoll-Rand, 498 U. S., at 139;Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41, 47-48 (1987);

Shaw, 463 U. S., at 98. We acknowledge that a state lawmight produce such acute, albeit indirect, economic effects,
by intent or otherwise, as to force an ERISA plan to adopta certain scheme of substantive coverage or effectively restrict its choice of insurers, and that such a state law mightindeed be pre-empted under $ 514. But as we have shown,
New York's surcharges do not fall into either category; theyaffect only indirectly the relative prices of insurance policies,
a result no different from myriad state laws in areas tradi-tionally subject to local regulation, which Congress could not
possibly have intended to eliminate.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

1983, the House Committee on Ways and Means recommended that States
should not be held to traditional DRG-based reimbursement systems.
"State systems provide a laboratory for innovative methods of controlling
health care costs, and should, therefore, not be limited to one methodology." H. R. Rep. No. 98-25, pt. 1, pp. 146-147 (1983). The Committee
concluded that "State systems covering all payors have proven effective
in reducing health costs and should be encouraged. Such State programs
may be useful models for our national system." Id., at 147-148. While
the history of Medicare waivers and implementing legislation enacted
after ERISA itself is, of course, not conclusive proof of the congressional
intent behind ERISA, the fact that Congress envisioned state experiments with comprehensive hospital reimbursement regulation supports
our conclusion that ERISA was not meant to pre-empt basic rate
regulation.

UNITED STATES v. ROBERTSON
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 94-251. Argued February 27, 1995--Decided May 1, 1995
Respondent Robertson's investment in his Alaska gold mine of the proceeds from his unlawful narcotics activities prompted a federal indictment for violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act (RICO), which makes it a crime for any person to use or invest any
income derived from a pattern of racketeering activity in the "acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate
. . . commerce," 18 U. S. C. $ 1962(a). Robertson was convicted on this
charge, but the Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the Government had failed to introduce sufficient evidence that the gold mine
(the RICO "enterprise") was "engaged in or affect[ed] interstate
commerce."
Held: Robertson's gold mine comes within $ 1962(a)'s jurisdictional reach.

At trial, the Government proved, inter alia, that Robertson purchased
equipment and supplies in California and transported them to Alaska
for use in the mine, brought workers from outside Alaska to work in the
mine, and transported 15% of the mine's output out of Alaska. These
activities assuredly brought the mine within $ 1962(a)'s criterion of "an
enterprise . . . engaged in . . . interstate . . . commerce." See, e. g.,
United States v. American Building Maintenance Industries, 422 U. S.
271, 283. Because the proof thus focused on interstate activities rather
than intrastate activities having interstate effects, this Court need not
decide whether the activities substantially affected interstate commerce
under, e. g., Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 127-128.

Respondent, Juan Paul Robertson, was charged withvarious narcotics offenses, and with violating $ 1962(a) of

the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act(RICO), 18 U. S. C. $ 1961

et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. V), byinvesting the proceeds of those unlawful activities in the "acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment or operationof, any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of
which affect, interstate or foreign commerce." $ 1962(a).He was convicted on some of the narcotics counts, and on the
RICO count by reason of his investment in a certain gold
mine. The United States Court of Appeals for the NinthCircuit reversed the RICO conviction on the ground that the

Government had failed to introduce sufficient evidence proving that the gold mine was "engaged in or affect[ed] inter-state commerce." 15 F. 3d 862, 868 (1994). We granted the

United States' petition for certiorari. 513 U. S. 945 (1994).The facts relevant to the "engaged in or affecting interstate commerce" issue were as follows: Some time in 1985,Robertson entered into a partnership agreement with another man, whereby he agreed to finance a gold mining oper-ation in Alaska. In fulfillment of this obligation, Robertson,
who resided in Arizona, made a cash payment of $125,000 for
placer gold mining claims near Fairbanks. He paid approxi-mately $100,000 (in cash) for mining equipment and supplies,

some of which were purchased in Los Angeles and trans-ported to Alaska for use in the mine. Robertson also hired
and paid the expenses for seven out-of-state employees totravel to Alaska to work in the mine. The partnership dissolved during the first mining season, but Robertson contin-ued to operate the mine through 1987 as a sole proprietorship. He again hired a number of employees from outside
Alaska to work in the mine. During its operating life, themine produced between $200,000 and $290,000 worth of gold,

most of which was sold to refiners within Alaska, although

671Cite as: 514 U. S. 669 (1995)
Per Curiam
Robertson personally transported approximately $30,000
worth of gold out of the State.

Most of the parties' arguments, here and in the Ninth Circuit, were addressed to the question whether the activities
of the gold mine "affected" interstate commerce. We have
concluded we do not have to consider that point. The "affecting commerce" test was developed in our jurisprudence
to define the extent of Congress' power over purely intrastate commercial activities that nonetheless have substantial
interstate effects. See, e. g., Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S.
111 (1942). The proof at Robertson's trial, however, focused
largely on the interstate activities of Robertson's mine. For
example, the Government proved that Robertson purchased
at least $100,000 worth of equipment and supplies for use in
the mine. Contrary to the Court of Appeals' suggestion, all
of those items were not purchased locally ("drawn generally
from the stream of interstate commerce," 15 F. 3d, at 869
(internal quotation marks omitted)); the Government proved
that some of them were purchased in California and transported to Alaska for use in the mine's operations. Cf.
United States v. American Building Maintenance Industries, 422 U. S. 271, 285 (1975) (allegation that company had
made local purchases of equipment and supplies that were
merely manufactured out of state was insufficient to show
that company was "engaged in commerce" within the meaning of $ 7 of the Clayton Act). The Government also proved
that, on more than one occasion, Robertson sought workers
from out of state and brought them to Alaska to work in the
mine. Cf. id., at 274. Furthermore, Robertson, the mine's
sole proprietor, took $30,000 worth of gold, or 15% of the
mine's total output, with him out of the State.

Whether or not these activities met (and whether or not,
to bring the gold mine within the "affecting commerce" provision of RICO, they would have to meet) the requirement of
substantially affecting interstate commerce, they assuredly

brought the gold mine within $ 1962(a)'s alternative criterionof "any enterprise . . . engaged in . . . interstate or foreign

when it is itself "directly engaged in the production, distri-bution, or acquisition of goods or services in interstate
commerce." Id., at 283. See also Gulf Oil Corp. v. Copp

KANSAS v. COLORADO
on exceptions to report of special master
No. 105, Orig. Argued March 21, 1995--Decided May 15, 1995
Kansas and Colorado negotiated the Arkansas River Compact to settle

disputes and remove causes of future controversies over the river's waters and to equitably divide and apportion those waters and the benefits
arising from the United States' construction, operation, and maintenance of John Martin Reservoir. Under Article IV-D, the Compact
is not intended to impede or prevent future beneficial development--
including construction of dams and reservoirs and the prolonged or improved functioning of existing works--provided that such development
does not "materially deplet[e]" stateline flows "in usable quantity or
availability for use." In this action, the Special Master recommended
that the Court, among other things, find that post-Compact well pumping in Colorado has resulted in a violation of Article IV-D of the Compact; find that Kansas has failed to prove that the operation of Colorado's Winter Water Storage Program (WWSP) violates the Compact; and
dismiss Kansas' claim that Colorado's failure to abide by the Trinidad
Reservoir Operating Principles (Operating Principles) violates the Compact. Both Kansas and Colorado have filed exceptions.

Held: The exceptions are overruled. Pp. 681-694.

(a) Article IV-D permits development of projects so long as their
operation does not result in a material depletion of usable flow to Kansas
users. Kansas' exception to the dismissal of its Trinidad Reservoir
claim fails because Kansas has not established that Colorado's failure to
obey the Operating Principles resulted in such a violation. Pp. 681-683.

(b) Because Kansas failed to meet its burden of proving its WWSP
claim despite being given every reasonable opportunity to do so by
the Special Master, there is no support for its exception to the Special
Master's conclusion on that claim. P. 684.

(c) In selecting what method should be used to determine depletions
of "usable" flow, the Special Master properly rejected the Spronk
method--which Kansas' exception proposes is correct--as less compatible with Kansas' hydrological model than the method ultimately adopted
by the Special Master. Pp. 684-687.

(d) In ruling on Colorado's exception to the Special Master's conclusion that laches does not bar Kansas' well-pumping claim, it is not necessary to decide whether the laches doctrine applies to a case involving

514us3$55Z 05-27-98 17:32:32 PAGES OPINPGT
674 KANSAS v. COLORADO

Syllabus
the enforcement of an interstate compact because Colorado has failed to
prove that Kansas lacked due diligence in bringing its claim. Colorado
errs in arguing that Kansas officials had sufficient evidence about increased well pumping in Colorado to determine that a Compact violation
existed in 1956. The evidence available through 1985 was vague and
conflicting. Pp. 687-689.

(e) This Court disagrees with both the legal and factual claims Colorado raises in its exception to the Special Master's finding that the Compact limits annual pumping by pre-Compact wells to 15,000 acre-feet,
the highest amount actually pumped in those years. Kansas' failure to
object to the replacement of pumps or increased pumping by preCompact wells does not support Colorado's legal argument that the limit
should be the maximum amount of pumping possible using wells existing
prior to the Compact. Regardless of the parties' subsequent practice,
such improvements to and increased pumping by existing wells clearly
fall within Article IV-D's prohibition. In making the factual determination that 15,000 acre-feet per year is the appropriate limit, the Special
Master properly relied on reports by the United States Geological Survey and the Colorado Legislature, reports that have since been used by
the Colorado State Engineer. Pp. 689-691.

(f) The Court agrees with the Special Master's conclusion that the
1980 Operating Plan for the John Martin Reservoir (Plan) was separately bargained for and thus there is no evidence to support the claim
raised in Colorado's exception that the benefits to Kansas from the Plan
were in settlement of its well claims. The Plan does not state that
post-Compact well pumping in Colorado or Kansas was a cause of
changes in the river's regime, and it expressly reserves the parties'
rights under the Compact. Pp. 691-693.

(g) The Special Master concluded that, regardless whether the burden of proof applied to Kansas' well-pumping claim is clear and convincing evidence or preponderance of the evidence, the post-Compact well
pumping in Colorado had caused material depletions of usable river
flows in violation of the Compact. Thus, this Court need not resolve
the issue raised by Colorado's exception: that clear and convincing evidence is the correct standard. Pp. 693-694.

Exceptions overruled, and case remanded.

The Continental Divide in the United States begins at theCanadian border in the mountains of northwestern Montana.
From there, it angles southeast through Montana and Wyo-ming until it enters Colorado. It then runs roughly due
south through Colorado, following first the crest of the FrontRange of the Rocky Mountains, and then shifting slightly
west to follow the crest of the Sawatch Range. The Arkan-sas River rises on the east side of the Continental Divide,

between Climax and Leadville, Colorado. Thence it flowssouth and east through Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas, emptying into the Mississippi River, which in turnflows into the Gulf of Mexico. As if to prove that the ridge
that separates them is indeed the Continental Divide, a short
distance away from the source of the Arkansas, the ColoradoRiver rises and thence flows southwest through Colorado,

Utah, and Arizona, and finally empties into the Gulf ofBaja, California.

The Arkansas River flows at a steep gradient from itssource south to Canon City, Colorado, whence it turns east
and enters the Royal Gorge. As it flows through the Royal
Gorge, the Arkansas River is at some points half a mile
below the summit of the bordering cliffs. The Arkansas
River thence descends gradually through the high plains of
eastern Colorado and western Kansas; its elevation at the
Colorado-Kansas border is 3,350 feet. It then makes its
great bend northward through Kansas, and from there flows
southeasterly through northeastern Oklahoma and across
Arkansas. The Arkansas River covers about 1,450 miles
from its source in the Colorado Rockies to the point in southeastern Arkansas where it flows into the Mississippi River.
It is the fourth longest river in the United States, and it
drains in an area of 185,000 square miles.

The first Europeans to see the Arkansas River were members of the expedition of Francisco Coronado, in the course
of their search for the fabled Seven Golden Cities of Cibola.
In 1541, they crossed the Arkansas River near what is now
the Colorado-Kansas border. One year later, those in the
expedition of Hernando DeSoto would see the Arkansas
River 1,000 miles downstream at its mouth. The western
borders of the Louisiana Purchase, acquired from France in
1803, included within them most, if not all, of the Arkansas
River drainage basin. Zebulon Pike, in his expedition of
1805-1806, in the course of which he sighted the mountain
peak named after him, traveled up the Arkansas River.

John C. Fremont traversed the river in the other directionin his expedition of 1843-1844.

Today, as a result of the Kerr McClellan Project, the Ar-kansas River is navigable for oceangoing vessels all the way
from its mouth to Tulsa, Oklahoma. The Arkansas River isunique in that the pronunciation of its name changes from
State to State. In Colorado, Oklahoma, and Arkansas, it ispronounced as is the name of the State of Arkansas, but in
Kansas, it is pronounced Ar-KAN-sas.The reach of the Arkansas River system at issue here is
a fertile agricultural region that extends from Pueblo, Colo-rado, to Garden City, Kansas. This region has been developed in Colorado by 23 major canal companies and in Kansasby 6 canal companies, which divert the surface flows of the
Arkansas River and distribute them to individual farmers.Report 35-38. Also relevant to this dispute, the United
States has constructed three large water storage projects inthe Arkansas River basin. Id., at 43-48. The John Martin
Reservoir, located on the Arkansas River about 60 mileswest of the Kansas border, was authorized by Congress in
1936, 49 Stat. 1570, and was completed in 1948. It is thelargest of the federal reservoirs, and initially it had a storage capacity of about 700,000 acre-feet.1 Report 45. ThePueblo Reservoir, located on the Arkansas River about 150
miles west of the Kansas border, was authorized by Congressin 1962, and was substantially completed in 1975. Id., at 44.
In 1977, the storage capacity of the Pueblo Reservoir wasestimated to be about 357,000 acre-feet.

Ibid. Finally, theTrinidad Reservoir, located on the Purgatoire River (a major

tributary of the Arkansas River) was approved by Congressin 1958, and was completed in 1977. Id., at 43. The total
capacity of the Trinidad Reservoir is about 114,000 acre-feet. Ibid.

volume of water necessary to cover one acre of land with one foot of water.

678 KANSAS v. COLORADO

Opinion of the Court
Twice before in this century, the States of Kansas and Col-orado have litigated in this Court regarding their respective

rights to the waters of the Arkansas River. See Kansas v.
Colorado, 206 U. S. 46 (1907); Colorado v. Kansas, 320 U. S.
383 (1943). In the first suit, the Court denied Kansas' request to enjoin diversions of the Arkansas River by Coloradobecause the depletions alleged by Kansas were insufficient

to warrant injunctive relief. Kansas v. Colorado, supra, at114-117. In the second suit, Colorado sought to enjoin
lower court litigation brought against Colorado water users,while Kansas sought an equitable apportionment of the Arkansas River. Colorado v. Kansas, supra, at 388-389. The
Court granted Colorado an injunction, but concluded that
Kansas was not entitled to an equitable apportionment. 320
U. S., at 400. The Court suggested that the States resolve
their differences by negotiation and agreement, pursuant to
the Compact Clause of the Constitution. Id., at 392. See
U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 10, cl. 3.

In 1949, after three years of negotiations, Kansas and Colorado approved, and Congress ratified, the Arkansas River
Compact (Compact). See 63 Stat. 145; see also Report 5-6;
App. to Report 1-17 (reprinting text of Compact). Article
VIII of the Compact creates the Arkansas River Compact
Administration (Administration) and vests it with the power
and responsibility for administering the Compact. Id., at
11-15. The Administration is composed of a nonvoting presiding officer designated by the President of the United
States, and three voting representatives from each State.
Each State has one vote, and every decision, authorization,
or other action by the Administration requires a unanimous
vote. Id., at 12-13 (Article VIII-D).

The Compact's primary purposes are to "[s]ettle existing
disputes and remove causes of future controversy . . . concerning the waters of the Arkansas River" and to "[e]quitably divide and apportion" the waters of the Arkansas River,
"as well as the benefits arising from the construction, opera514us3$55H 05-27-98 17:32:33 PAGES OPINPGT

tion and maintenance by the United States of John MartinReservoir."

Id., at 1-2 (Articles I-A, I-B). Article IV-D,
the provision of the Compact most relevant to this dispute,states:

"This Compact is not intended to impede or preventfuture beneficial development of the Arkansas River
basin in Colorado and Kansas by Federal or State agen-cies, by private enterprise, or by combinations thereof,
which may involve construction of dams, reservoir, andother works for the purposes of water utilization and
control, as well as the improved or prolonged functioning of existing works: Provided, that the waters of theArkansas River . . . shall not be materially depleted in

usable quantity or availability for use to the water usersin Colorado and Kansas under this Compact by such future development or construction." Id., at 5 (emphasisadded).

In 1983, Kansas conducted an independent investigation ofpossible violations of the Compact arising from the impact
of increases in post-Compact well pumping in Colorado andthe operation of two of the federal reservoirs. Report 9-10.
In December 1985, Kansas brought this original actionagainst the State of Colorado to resolve disputes arising
under the Compact. Id., at 10. The Court granted Kansas
leave to file its complaint, Kansas v. Colorado, 475 U. S. 1079(1986), and appointed Judge Wade H. McCree, Jr., to serve

as Special Master, Kansas v. Colorado, 478 U. S. 1018 (1986).Upon Judge McCree's death, the Court appointed Arthur L.
Littleworth as Special Master. Kansas v. Colorado, 484
U. S. 910 (1987).

Kansas advanced three principal claims, each involving an
alleged Compact violation. See Report 58. First, Kansas
alleged that increases in groundwater well pumping in Colorado in the years following adoption of the Compact have
caused a significant decline in the Arkansas River's surface

flow in violation of Article IV-D of the Compact. Second,Kansas claimed that Colorado's Winter Water Storage Program (WWSP)--a program whereby the Bureau of Recla-mation of the Department of the Interior (Bureau of Reclamation) and Colorado use excess capacity at the PuebloReservoir to store a portion of the winter flow of the Arkansas River--violates the Compact. Third, Kansas claimedthat Colorado's failure to abide by the Trinidad Reservoir
Operating Principles (Operating Principles) constituted aviolation of the Compact.

Ibid.The Special Master bifurcated the trial into a liability

phase and a remedy phase. At the conclusion of the liabilityphase, the Special Master filed his Report, outlining his findings and recommendations. In his Report, the Special Mas-ter recommended, among other things, that the Court: (1)
find that post-Compact well pumping in Colorado has "mate-rially depleted" the "usable" flow at the Colorado-Kansas
border (stateline) in violation of Article IV-D of the Com-pact, Report 336; (2) find that "Kansas has failed to prove
that operation of the [WWSP] program has violated the[C]ompact," ibid.; and (3) "dismiss the Kansas claim arising
from the operation of Trinidad Reservoir," ibid.2Both Kansas and Colorado have filed exceptions to the
Special Master's Report. Kansas excepts to the SpecialMaster's rejection of its (1) Trinidad Reservoir claim, see
id., at 373-433; (2) WWSP claim, see id., at 306-335; and (3)preferred method for determining the usability of depletions
of stateline flows, see id., at 291-305. Colorado excepts tothe Special Master's determination that: (1) Kansas was not
guilty of inexcusable delay in making its post-Compact well-pumping claim and that Colorado was not prejudiced by this

2 Colorado presented two counterclaims against Kansas. The Special
Master recommended that the Court grant Kansas' motions to dismiss
those counterclaims. Report 337. Colorado has not filed exceptions to
those recommendations. We adopt the Special Master's recommendations
on Colorado's counterclaims.

delay, see id., at 147-170; (2) pre-Compact wells in Colorado
are limited to pumping the highest amount pumped in the
years during which the Compact was negotiated and that the
highest amount of such pumping was 15,000 acre-feet per
year, see id., at 182-200; (3) increases in usable state line
flows resulting from the operating plan for the John Martin
Reservoir adopted by the Administration in 1980 (1980 Operating Plan) were "separately bargained for" and, therefore,
should not offset depletions caused by post-Compact well
pumping in Colorado, see id., at 171-181; and (4) Kansas need
only meet the "preponderance of the evidence" standard to
prove a breach of Article IV-D of the Compact, see id., at
65-70.

We turn to the parties' exceptions.

II

A

In 1958, Congress authorized construction of the Trinidad
Project, a dam and a reservoir system on the Purgatoire
River slightly upstream from the city of Trinidad, Colorado.
See id., at 382-388. Recognizing that Article IV-D of the
Compact prohibited any development of the Arkansas River
basin that resulted in a material depletion of usable river
flow, the Bureau of Reclamation conducted studies regarding
the future operation of the Trinidad Project. Id., at 388-
390. The Bureau of Reclamation established Operating
Principles whereby the Trinidad Project could be administered "without adverse effect on downstream water users
and the inflow to John Martin Reservoir." Id., at 390 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Governor of Kansas reviewed the Bureau of Reclamation's proposed Operating
Principles and indicated that if five additional conditions
were accepted, then "Kansas would be in a position to approve the amended Operating Principles and to support completion of the project." Id., at 392-393. In June 1967, the

514us3$55H 05-27-98 17:32:33 PAGES OPINPGT
682 KANSAS v. COLORADO

Opinion of the Court
Administration approved the Operating Principles as well asKansas' five additional conditions.

Id., at 395.
In 1979, Colorado began storage of water at the TrinidadReservoir.

Id., at 396. Kansas immediately complained
that the Operating Principles were being violated. Id., at
397. In 1988, at the request of the Administration, theBureau of Reclamation conducted a study of the Trinidad

Reservoir. It concluded that two storage practices at theTrinidad Reservoir constituted a " `departure from the
intent of the operating principles.' " Ibid.At trial, Kansas argued that the Operating Principles were
binding on the State of Colorado and that any departure
from them constituted a violation of the Compact "regardless
of injury." Id., at 408 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Kansas, however, "offered no evidence, apart from the
Bureau studies, to show that the actual operation of the
Trinidad project caused it to receive less water than under
historical, without-project conditions." Id., at 412. Instead, Kansas sought to quantify depletions by "comparing
the flows into John Martin Reservoir `as they would have
occurred under the Operating Principles with the flows that
occurred under actual operations.' " Id., at 409. The Special Master concluded that in order to prove a violation of
the Compact, Kansas was required to demonstrate that "the
Trinidad operations caused a material depletion within the
meaning of Article IV-D." Id., at 431. The Special Master
recommends that we dismiss Kansas' Trinidad claim because
"Kansas has not established, and did not attempt to establish, such injury." Ibid.

Kansas argues that "[d]eparture from the Operating Principles is ipso facto a violation of the Compact, and it [is] entirely sufficient, for purposes of quantifying the effects of
the violation, to compare the actual operation with simulated
operation as it should have been under the Operating Principles." Kansas' Exceptions to Special Master's Report 12.
But, it must be recalled, this is an original action to enforce

683Cite as: 514 U. S. 673 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
the terms of the Compact.3 Article IV-D provides that theCompact is not intended to prevent future beneficial development of the Arkansas River basin--including dams and res-ervoirs--provided that the river flow shall not be materially
depleted. The Compact thus permits the development ofprojects such as Pueblo Reservoir so long as their operation
does not result in a material depletion of usable flow to Kan-sas users. For Kansas to prevail in its contention, it would
have to show that the Operating Principles had the effect ofamending the Compact by granting either party the right to
sue the other for violation of the Operating Principles even
though the violation resulted in no material depletion of usable flow at stateline. Although the Administration is em-powered to "[p]rescribe procedures for the administration of

th[e] Compact," App. to Report 11 (Article VIII-B(2)), itmust do so "

consistent with the provisions of th[e] Compact," ibid. (Article VIII-B(1)) (emphasis added); see alsoReport 416 ("[T]he Compact Administration was not delegated power to change the Compact"). The theory advo-cated by Kansas is inconsistent with Article IV-D, which
allows for the development and operation of dams and reservoirs so long as there is no resultant material depletion ofusable flows at stateline.

Thus Kansas, in order to establish a Compact violationbased upon failure to obey the Operating Principles, was required to demonstrate that this failure resulted in a materialdepletion under Article IV-D. Kansas "has not established,
and did not attempt to establish, such injury." Id., at 431.We overrule Kansas' exception to the Special Master's dismissal of its Trinidad Reservoir claim.

3 The Special Master did "not address the possible question of whether
Kansas has a claim for violation of the Operating Principles that is independent of the Compact, that is, a cause of action based upon a separate
agreement with Colorado, or as a third party beneficiary under the repayment contract, or otherwise." Report 408, n. 6. We express no view as
to that question.

684 KANSAS v. COLORADO

Opinion of the Court

B
In 1964, the Bureau of Reclamation and Colorado beganplanning a program to use excess capacity at Pueblo Reservoir in order to store a portion of the winter-time flow of theArkansas River for beneficial use at other times. Under the
WWSP, winter-time flow--much of which was used pre-viously to flood uncultivated cropland--is instead stored at
the Pueblo Reservoir. Kansas contends that the SpecialMaster erred in finding that it had failed to prove that the
WWSP had "materially depleted" usable stateline flows.We disagree.

In his Report, the Special Master concluded:

"Kansas has not proved that the WWSP has caused ma-terial Stateline depletions. Kansas' case has not been

helped by its own contradictions in quantifying impactsto usable flow--ranging during this trial from 255,000
acre-feet initially, to 44,000 to 40,000; nor by the fact thatdepletions are essentially eliminated if accretions are
taken into account." Report 335.
The Special Master examined the computer models submit-ted by Kansas and Colorado and determined that "the depletions shown by the Kansas model are well within the model'srange of error."

Id., at 334-335. As a result, "[o]ne [couldnot] be sure whether impact or error [was] being shown."

Id., at 335.We believe that the Special Master gave Kansas every reasonable opportunity to meet its burden of proving its WWSPclaim. Kansas, however, failed to prove that operation of
the WWSP program resulted in material depletions of usableflows in violation of Article IV-D. See

ibid. Therefore, weoverrule Kansas' exception to the Special Master's conclusion that Kansas had failed to prove its WWSP claim.

C
Article IV-D of the Compact permits future developmentand construction along the Arkansas River Basin provided

685Cite as: 514 U. S. 673 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
that it does not materially deplete stateline flows "in usable
quantity or availability." App. to Report 5 (Article IV-D)
(emphasis added). In order to establish a violation of Article IV-D, Kansas was required to establish that development
in Colorado resulted in material depletions of "usable" river
flow. The Compact does not define the term "usable." Cf.
Colorado v. Kansas, 320 U. S., at 396-397 ("The critical matter is the amount of divertible flow at times when water is
most needed for irrigation. Calculations of average annual
flow, which include flood flows, are, therefore, not helpful in
ascertaining the dependable supply of water usable for
irrigation"). At trial, Kansas presented three methods for
determining depletions of "usable" flow.

Kansas' first expert, Timothy J. Durbin, analyzed flow data
for the period between 1951 and 1985 by plotting actual river
diversions in Kansas against actual stateline flows. Report
293-294. Using these data, Durbin developed criteria to
determine what river flows were usable. Durbin concluded
that during the summer months, April through October, (1)
78% of the stateline flows were diverted; (2) flows greater
than 40,000 acre-feet per month were not usable; and (3)
flows greater than 140,000 acre-feet for the whole period
were not usable. Id., at 293. With respect to the winter
months, November through March, Durbin concluded that (1)
24% of the winter flow was diverted; (2) flows greater than
7,500 acre-feet per month were not usable; and (3) flows
greater than 40,000 acre-feet for the whole period were not
usable. Id., at 293-294.

After Colorado isolated errors in Durbin's analysis, Kansas
presented a replacement case. Kansas' second group of experts, led by Stephen P. Larson, adopted the same methodology but revised certain exhibits and made minor corrections
in data. As a result, Larson modified Durbin's coefficients,
using 72% for the summer months and 25% for the winter
months. Id., at 295.

514us3$55H 05-27-98 17:32:33 PAGES OPINPGT
686 KANSAS v. COLORADO

Opinion of the Court
Later, well after trial had begun, Kansas enlisted the aidof Brent Spronk, who proposed yet another method to quantify depletions of "usable" stateline flow. Id., at 300-305.Spronk attempted to determine the "percentage of days in
each month when flows were being fully used in Kansas."
Id., at 301. Instead of seasonal averages, the Spronk ap-proach yielded coefficients that varied from month to month.

Spronk then multiplied these monthly coefficients by the es-timated depletions in flow predicted by Kansas' hydrological
model. Id., at 301-302.The Special Master concluded that "the Durbin approach,
using Larson's coefficients, is the best of the several methods
presented for determining usable flow" and that it provided
"a reasonable way in which to determine depletions of usable
flow." Id., at 305. We agree. Each of the three methods
that Kansas proposed for calculating usable depletions required two steps: (1) a calculation of total depletions using
the Kansas hydrological model, and (2) an application of "usability" criteria. See Brief for United States in Response to
Exeptions of Kansas and Colorado 30. Each of the three
methods proposed by Kansas was dependent on the Kansas hydrological model to estimate total depletions. The
Spronk method required the Kansas hydrological model
to predict accurately depletions for each and every month.
Report 303. But as Durbin, Kansas' first expert, testified,
Kansas' hydrological model was only a " `good predictor'
when `looking at long periods of time.' " Id., at 303, n. 130
(quoting Durbin's testimony). Thus, the Spronk method required the Kansas hydrological model to do something it was
not designed to do, i. e., predict accurately depletions on a
monthly basis. Id., at 303 ("The Spronk analysis assumes
that the H-I model can accurately predict changes of Stateline flow on a monthly basis"). Because the Spronk method
for determining "usable" river flows was less compatible
with Kansas' hydrological model than the other methods proposed, we conclude that the Special Master properly rejected

the Spronk method in favor of the Durbin approach, as modi-fied by the Larson coefficients.

The Special Master concluded that Kansas was not guiltyof inexcusable delay in making its well-pumping claim, and

that Colorado had not been prejudiced by Kansas' failure topress its claim earlier.

Id., at 170. Colorado has exceptedto this determination. Colorado argues that the equitable

doctrine of laches should bar Kansas' claim for relief. SeeColorado's Exceptions to Special Master's Report (Colorado's
Exceptions) 24-64. We overrule Colorado's exception.The defense of laches "requires proof of (1) lack of diligence by the party against whom the defense is asserted, and(2) prejudice to the party asserting the defense."

Costello v.
United States, 365 U. S. 265, 282 (1961); see also Black's LawDictionary 875 (6th ed. 1990) (" `Doctrine of laches,' is based

upon maxim that equity aids the vigilant and not those whoslumber on their rights. It is defined as neglect to assert a
right or claim which, taken together with lapse of time andother circumstances causing prejudice to the adverse party,
operates as bar in court of equity"). This Court has yet todecide whether the doctrine of laches applies in a case involving the enforcement of an interstate compact. Cf. Illinoisv.

Kentucky, 500 U. S. 380, 388 (1991) (in the context of aninterstate boundary dispute, "the laches defense is generally

inapplicable against a State"); Block v. North Dakota ex rel.Board of Univ. and School Lands, 461 U. S. 273, 294 (1983)
(O'Connor, J., dissenting) ("The common law has long ac-cepted the principle `

nullum tempus occurrit regi'--neitherlaches nor statutes of limitations will bar the sovereign");

Colorado v. Kansas, supra, at 394 (In the context of a suitseeking an equitable apportionment of river flows, facts demonstrating a delay in filing a complaint "might well precludethe award of the relief [requested]. But, in any event, they

Opinion of the Court
gravely add to the burden [the plaintiff] would otherwisebear"). We need not, however, foreclose the applicability of

laches in such cases, because we conclude that Colorado hasfailed to prove an element necessary to the recognition of
that defense. See Costello, supra, at 282.Colorado argues that Kansas knew or should have known
by 1956, or at the latest, before 1968, that both the numberof post-Compact wells and the amount of post-Compact
pumping in Colorado had increased substantially. Colora-do's Exceptions 37, 39. Colorado argues that by 1956 Kansas had sufficient information about increased well pumpingin Colorado and its potential impact on usable stateline flows
to call for an investigation to determine if a Compact viola-tion existed. Id., at 46.

The Special Master concluded that prior to 1984, Kansashad made no formal complaint to the Administration regarding post-Compact well pumping in Colorado. Report 155-156. Nevertheless, the Special Master concluded that Colorado's evidence did not "deal with the issue of impact onusable flow at the Stateline,"

id., at 161, and did "not demon-strate that [the Kansas officials] were aware of the number

of wells, the extent of Colorado's pumping, or the impact oreven potential impact of pumping on usable Stateline flows,"
id., at 164. The Special Master explained the difficulty ofassessing the impact of increases in post-Compact well
pumping on usable stateline flows because of changing condi-tions during the 1970's and early 1980's:

"The 1970s were generally dry years and some reductionin flow was to have been expected. Pueblo Dam came
on line in 1976 and began to reregulate native flows.Transmountain imports increased, which to some extent
provided an offset to pumping. The 1980 OperatingPlan was placed into effect, which Colorado alleges offset the impacts of increased pumping downstream fromJohn Martin Reservoir. The Winter Water Storage
Program was instituted. Moreover, there was no quan514us3$55H 05-27-98 17:32:33 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
titative or specific entitlement against which depletionsto usable flow could be judged. Nor were there any

agreed upon criteria for establishing what flows wereusable." Id., at 162-163.

As late as 1985, Colorado officials refused to permit an inves-tigation by the Administration of well development in Colorado because they claimed that the evidence produced byKansas did not " `suggest that well development in Colorado
has had an impact on usable stateline flows.' " Id., at 163(quoting memorandum of J. William McDonald, chief of the
Colorado delegation to the Administration). In light of thevague and conflicting evidence available to Kansas, we conclude that Colorado has failed to demonstrate lack of dili-gence,

i. e., inexcusable delay, on the part of Kansas.Accordingly, we overrule Colorado's exception to the Special Master's conclusion that the defense of laches should notbar Kansas' well-pumping claim.

B
The Compact prohibits "future beneficial development ofthe Arkansas River basin" that "materially deplete[s]" the

usable flows of the Arkansas River. App. to Report 5 (Arti-cle IV-D) (emphasis added). Because some wells in Colorado were in existence prior to the Compact, both partiesagree that a certain amount of post-Compact well pumping
is allowable under the Compact. Report 182. Kansas andColorado, however, dispute the extent of this allowance.
The Special Master determined that the "highest annualamount shown to have been pumped during the negotiations,
namely 15,000 acre-feet, should be allowed under the [C]om-pact." Id., at 200. Colorado makes both a legal and a factual challenge to this determination. Colorado's Exceptions66-73, 73-84.

Colorado argues as a legal matter that the Compact doesnot limit the pumping by pre-Compact wells to the highest
amount actually pumped in pre-Compact years; rather, Colo514us3$55H 05-27-98 17:32:33 PAGES OPINPGT

rado claims that the limit on its pre-Compact pumping is the
maximum amount that Colorado law permitted or the maximum amount of pumping possible using wells existing prior
to the Compact. Id., at 69-70. In support of its position,
Colorado argues that the Special Master failed to consider
the subsequent practice of the parties, i. e., Kansas' failure
to object to replacement of centrifugal pumps with turbine
pumps or increased pumping by pre-Compact wells, and that
Article VI-A(2) of the Compact supports its position.4

We conclude that the clear language of Article IV-D refutes Colorado's legal challenge. Article IV-D permits "future beneficial development of the Arkansas River basin . . .
which may involve construction of dams, reservoir, and other
works for the purposes of water utilization and control, as
well as the improved or prolonged functioning of existing
works: Provided, that the waters of the Arkansas River . . .
shall not be materially depleted in usable quantity or availability . . . ." App. to Report 5 (emphasis added). Regardless of subsequent practice by the parties, improved and increased pumping by existing wells clearly falls within Article
IV-D's prohibition against "improved or prolonged functioning of existing works," if such action results in "materia[l]
deplet[ions] in usable" river flows. Ibid.; see Texas v. New
Mexico, 462 U. S. 554, 564 (1983) ("[U]nless the compact to
which Congress has consented is somehow unconstitutional,
no court may order relief inconsistent with its express
terms"). Article VI-A(2) of the Compact, which begins
with the phrase, "Except as otherwise provided," App. to

4 Article VI-A(2) provides: "Except as otherwise provided, nothing in
this Compact shall be construed as supplanting the administration by Colorado of the rights of appropriators of waters of the Arkansas River in
said State as decreed to said appropriators by the courts of Colorado, nor
as interfering with the distribution among said appropriators by Colorado,
nor as curtailing the diversion and use for irrigation and other beneficial
purposes in Colorado of the waters of the Arkansas River." App. to Report 10 (emphasis added).

Opinion of the Court
Report 10, must be read in conjunction with and as limitedby Article IV-D. We agree with the Special Master that

"new wells, the replacement of centrifugal with turbinepumps, and increased pumping from [pre-Compact] wells all
come within [Article IV-D]." Report 194.Second, Colorado argues as a factual matter that the Special Master unreasonably relied upon faulty reports by theUnited States Geological Survey (USGS) and the Colorado
Legislature to conclude that the greatest amount of annualpre-Compact pumping in Colorado was 15,000 acre-feet.
Colorado's Exceptions 73-74. The Special Master concluded:

"There is no precise answer to the amount of [pre-Compact] pumping. . . . That amount must simply remain

as an estimate of water use that affected the generalallocation of water between the states when the [C]ompact was being negotiated. Two responsible reports,one published by the USGS and one prepared for
the Colorado legislature, reached similar conclusionsas to the amounts of Colorado pumping during the
1940s. . . . They have since been used by the ColoradoState Engineer. I have relied on these reports and
recommend that the highest annual amount shown tohave been pumped during the negotiations, namely
15,000 acre-feet, should be allowed under the [C]ompact."Report 199-200.

Although the ultimate responsibility for deciding what arecorrect findings of fact remains with the Court,

Colorado v.
New Mexico, 467 U. S. 310, 317 (1984), in this instance, weare in full agreement with the Special Master. Accordingly,

we overrule Colorado's exception.

In April 1980, the Administration adopted a resolution con-cerning the method for operating John Martin Reservoir

Opinion of the Court
Plan divides the water conserved in John Martin Reservoirinto separate accounts. Kansas is allocated 40% of the conservation storage, with the remaining 60% being divided inspecified percentages among the nine canal companies in Colorado Water District 67. Id., at 173. The Special Master
concluded that the 1980 Operating Plan for the John MartinReservoir was "separately bargained for" and therefore

should not offset depletions caused by post-Compact wellpumping in Colorado.

Id., at 180-181. Colorado takes exception to this ruling.Colorado argues that increases in usable stateline flows

resulting from the 1980 Operating Plan should offset depletions to usable stateline flows. Colorado's Exceptions 85.
Colorado maintains that the Administration adopted the 1980
Operating Plan "for more efficient utilization of water under
its control because of changes in the regime of the Arkansas
River," id., at 91, "including [post-Compact] well pumping in
Colorado and Kansas," ibid.; see also App. to Report 107
(Resolution Concerning an Operating Plan for John Martin
Reservoir) ("WHEREAS, the Arkansas River Compact Administration . . . recognizes that, because of changes in the
regime of the Arkansas River, the present operation of the
conservation features of John Martin Reservoir does not result in the most efficient utilization possible of the water
under its control"). We disagree.

As Colorado acknowledges, the resolution adopting the
1980 Operating Plan "does not state that [post-Compact] well
pumping in Colorado or Kansas was a cause of changes in
the regime of the Arkansas River." Colorado's Exceptions
88. In fact, Colorado argues in a separate part of its brief
that "Kansas had made no complaint about well pumping in
Colorado to the Compact Administration . . . before 1984."
Id., at 32. The 1980 Operating Plan expressly reserves the
parties' rights under the Compact, stating that "[a]doption
of this resolution does not prejudice the ability of Kansas or
of any Colorado ditch to object or to otherwise represent its

interest in present or future cases or controversies beforethe Administration or in a court of competent jurisdiction."

App. to Report 116. The Special Master concluded:

"The 1980 Operating Plan provided benefits to bothKansas and Colorado which were separately bargained

for. There is no evidence to support the claim that ben-efits to Kansas were in settlement of its well claims.
Colorado received ample consideration under the agree-ment for the 1980 plan without a waiver of Kansas' well
claims. The benefits received by Kansas under the planshould not be offset against compact violations, and
should not be a bar to any of the Kansas claims in thiscase." Report 180-181.

We agree with the Special Master's resolution of Colorado'sclaim. Accordingly, we overrule Colorado's exception.

D
Finally, Colorado argues that Kansas is required to proveits well-pumping claim by clear and convincing evidence.

Colorado's Exceptions 91. The Special Master, relying upon
Nebraska v. Wyoming, 507 U. S. 584 (1993), concluded thatthe proper burden of proof for enforcing an interstate compact is the preponderance of the evidence standard. Report70. The Special Master noted that the

Nebraska Court haddrawn a distinction between actions seeking to "modify" a

judicial decree and actions seeking to "enforce" a judicial de-cree. See Nebraska, supra, at 592 ("[W]e find merit in [the]
contention that, to the extent that Nebraska seeks modifica-tion of the decree rather than enforcement, a higher standard of proof applies"). The Special Master concluded thatan action seeking to enforce an interstate compact stood on
the same footing as an action enforcing a judicial decree, andtherefore was subject to the "preponderance of the evidence"
standard. Report 70.We need not, however, resolve this issue. The Special
Master concluded that "regardless of which burden of proof

agree with this determination, and thus overrule Colorado'sexception.

IV
For these reasons, we overrule the exceptions filed by theStates of Kansas and Colorado. We remand the case to the

Syllabus

HUBBARD v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 94-172. Argued February 21, 1995--Decided May 15, 1995
Petitioner's falsehoods in unsworn papers filed in Bankruptcy Court

prompted his indictment under 18 U. S. C. $ 1001, which criminalizes
false statements and similar misconduct occurring "in any matter within
the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States." He
was convicted after the District Court, relying on United States v.
Bramblett, 348 U. S. 503, instructed the jury that a bankruptcy court is
a "department of the United States" within $ 1001's meaning. In affirming, the Court of Appeals concluded that the so-called "judicial function" exception developed in other Circuits, under which $ 1001 reaches
false statements made while a court is performing its "administrative"
or "housekeeping" functions, but not its adjudicative functions, does
not exist.

Held: The judgment is reversed in part.
16 F. 3d 694, reversed in part.

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I, II, III, and VI, concluding that, because a federal court is neither a "department" nor an "agency" within $ 1001's meaning, the statute does not apply to false statements made in judicial proceedings.
Pp. 699-708, 715.

(a) A straightforward interpretation of $ 1001's text, with special emphasis on the words "department or agency," leads inexorably to the
conclusion that there is no need for any judicial function exception because the statute's reach simply does not extend to courts. Under both
a commonsense reading and the terms of 18 U. S. C. $ 6--which applies
to all of Title 18 and defines "agency" to include, inter alia, any federal
"department, independent establishment, commission, administration,
authority, board or bureau"--it seems incontrovertible that "agency"
does not refer to a court. Moreover, although $ 6 defines "department"
to mean an "executive departmen[t] . . . unless the context shows that
such term was intended to describe the . . . legislative . . . or judicial
branches," there is nothing in $ 1001's text, or in any related legislation,
that even suggests--let alone "shows"--that something other than a
component of the Executive Branch was intended in this instance.
Pp. 699-702.

Syllabus
(b) The Bramblett Court erred by giving insufficient weight to the
plain language of $$ 6 and 1001 and, instead, broadly interpreting "department" in $ 1001 to refer to the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial
Branches. Rather than attempting to reconcile its interpretation with
the usual meaning of "department," that Court relied on a review of the
evolution of $ 1001 and a related statute as providing a "context" for the
conclusion that "Congress could not have intended to leave frauds such
as [Bramblett's] without penalty." 348 U. S., at 509. Although a statute's historical evolution should not be discounted, such an analysis normally provides less guidance to meaning than the final text. Here, a
straightforward reading suggests a meaning of "department" that is
fully consistent with $ 6's presumptive definition. Moreover, the statutory history chronicled in Bramblett is at best inconclusive and does
not supply a "context" sufficiently clear to warrant departure from that
definition. Pp. 702-708.

(c) Bramblett is hereby overruled. P. 715.
Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Ginsburg and Justice
Breyer, concluded in Parts IV and V:

1. A review of pertinent lower court decisions demonstrates that the
judicial function exception is an obvious attempt to impose limits on
Bramblett's expansive reading of $ 1001 and that the exception has a
substantial and longstanding following. Pp. 708-711.

2. The doctrine of stare decisis does not require this Court to accept
Bramblett's erroneous interpretation of $ 1001. Reconsideration of that
case is permitted here (1) because of a highly unusual intervening development of the law--the judicial function exception--which is fairly characterized as a competing legal doctrine that can lay a legitimate claim
to respect as a settled body of law, and (2) because of the absence of
significant reliance interests in adhering to Bramblett on the part of
prosecutors and Congress. Pp. 711-715.

Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Kennedy, agreed that United
States v. Bramblett, 348 U. S. 503, should be overruled, but concluded
that the doctrine of stare decisis may be ignored in this case not because
the judicial function exception represents an intervening development
of the law, but because of the demonstration, over time, that Bramblett's
mistaken reading of $ 1001 poses a risk that the threat of criminal
prosecution under $ 1001's capacious provisions will deter vigorous
representation of opposing interests in adversarial litigation, particularly representation of criminal defendants, whose adversaries control
the machinery of $ 1001 prosecution. That problem can be judicially
avoided (absent overruling) only by limiting Bramblett in a manner that
is irrational or by importing exceptions, such as the judicial function
exception, that have no basis in law. Pp. 716-717.

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court,except as to Parts IV and V.*
In unsworn papers filed in a bankruptcy proceeding, peti-tioner made three false statements of fact. Each of those
misrepresentations provided the basis for a criminal convic-tion and prison sentence under the federal false statement
statute, 18 U. S. C. $ 1001. The question we address iswhether $ 1001 applies to false statements made in judicial
proceedings. I

In 1985, petitioner filed a voluntary petition for bank-ruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In the
course of the proceedings, the trustee filed an amended com-plaint and a motion to compel petitioner to surrender certain
business records. Petitioner opposed the relief sought bythe trustee in a pair of unsworn, written responses filed with
the Bankruptcy Court. Both of his responses containedfalsehoods. Petitioner's answer to the trustee's complaint
falsely denied the trustee's allegations that a well-drillingmachine and parts for the machine were stored at petition*Justice Thomas joins Parts I, II, III, and VI of this opinion.

Opinion of the Court
er's home and in a nearby warehouse. Petitioner's response
to the trustee's discovery motion incorrectly stated that petitioner had already turned over all of the requested records.

When the misrepresentations came to light, petitioner was
charged with three counts of making false statements under
18 U. S. C. $ 1001.1 That statute provides:

"Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any
department or agency of the United States knowingly
and willfully falsifies, conceals or covers up by any trick,
scheme, or device a material fact, or makes any false,
fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, or
makes or uses any false writing or document knowing
the same to contain any false, fictitious or fraudulent
statement or entry, shall be fined not more than $10,000
or imprisoned not more than five years, or both."

Relying on our decision in United States v. Bramblett, 348
U. S. 503 (1955), the District Court instructed the jury that
a bankruptcy court is a "department . . . of the United
States" within the meaning of $ 1001. The jury convicted petitioner on all three $ 1001 counts, and the District
Court sentenced him to concurrent terms of 24 months'
imprisonment.

On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit,
petitioner argued that his convictions under $ 1001 were
barred by the so-called "judicial function" exception. First
suggested over 30 years ago in Morgan v. United States, 309
F. 2d 234 (CADC 1962), cert. denied, 373 U. S. 917 (1963), this
doctrine limits the extent to which $ 1001 reaches conduct
occurring in the federal courts. Under the exception, only
those misrepresentations falling within a court's "administrative" or "housekeeping" functions can give rise to liability

1 Petitioner was also charged with, and convicted of, bankruptcy fraud
and mail fraud under 18 U. S. C. $$ 152 and 1341 (1988 ed. and Supp. V).
The validity of those convictions is not before us.

Opinion of the Court
under $ 1001; false statements made while a court is performing its adjudicative functions are not covered.

The Court of Appeals affirmed petitioner's convictions
under $ 1001. Although the judicial function exception has
become entrenched over the years in a number of Circuits,
the Sixth Circuit concluded, over a dissent, that the exception does not exist. 16 F. 3d 694 (1994). That conclusion
created a split in the Circuits, prompting us to grant certiorari.2 513 U. S. 959 (1994). We now reverse.

II
Section 1001 criminalizes false statements and similar misconduct occurring "in any matter within the jurisdiction of
any department or agency of the United States." In ordinary parlance, federal courts are not described as "departments" or "agencies" of the Government. As noted by the
Sixth Circuit, it would be strange indeed to refer to a court
as an "agency." See 16 F. 3d, at 698, n. 4 ("[T]he U. S. Court
of Appeals [is not] the Appellate Adjudication Agency").
And while we have occasionally spoken of the three branches
of our Government, including the Judiciary, as "department[s]," e. g., Mississippi v. Johnson, 4 Wall. 475, 500 (1867),
that locution is not an ordinary one. Far more common is
the use of "department" to refer to a component of the Executive Branch.

2 The judicial function exception has been recognized in the following
cases: United States v. Masterpol, 940 F. 2d 760, 764-766 (CA2 1991);
United States v. Holmes, 840 F. 2d 246, 248 (CA4), cert. denied, 488 U. S.
831 (1988); United States v. Abrahams, 604 F. 2d 386, 393 (CA5 1979);
United States v. Mayer, 775 F. 2d 1387, 1390 (CA9 1985) (per curiam);
United States v. Wood, 6 F. 3d 692, 694-695 (CA10 1993). Although the
Seventh and District of Columbia Circuits have questioned the basis of
the exception, see United States v. Barber, 881 F. 2d 345, 350 (CA7 1989),
cert. denied, 495 U. S. 922 (1990); United States v. Poindexter, 951 F. 2d
369, 387 (CADC 1991), cert. denied, 506 U. S. 1021 (1992), the Sixth Circuit
stands alone in unambiguously rejecting it.

700 HUBBARD v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
As an initial matter, therefore, one might be tempted toconclude that $ 1001 does not apply to falsehoods made during federal-court proceedings. This commonsense readingis bolstered by the statutory definitions of "department" and
"agency" set forth at 18 U. S. C. $ 6. First adopted in 1948,
and applicable to all of Title 18, the definitions create a pre-sumption in favor of the ordinary meaning of the terms at

issue:

"The term `department' means one of the executivedepartments enumerated in section 1 [now $ 101] of

Title 5, unless the context shows that such term was
intended to describe the executive, legislative, or judi-cial branches of the government.

"The term `agency' includes any department, independent establishment, commission, administration, authority, board or bureau of the United States or any corporation in which the United States has a proprietary
interest, unless the context shows that such term was
intended to be used in a more limited sense."

Under $ 6, it seems incontrovertible that "agency" does not
refer to a court.3 "Department," on the other hand, might
be interpreted under $ 6 to describe the Judicial Branch,
but only if the "context" of $ 1001 "shows" that Congress
intended the word to be used in the unusual sense employed in Mississippi v. Johnson. We believe that $ 6 permits such an interpretation only if the context in $ 1001 is
fairly powerful. "Shows" is a strong word; among its definitions is "[t]o make apparent or clear by evidence, testimony
or reasoning; to prove; demonstrate." Webster's New International Dictionary 2324 (2d ed. 1949). Cf. Rowland v.
California Men's Colony, Unit II Men's Advisory Council,
506 U.YS. 194, 200-201 (1993) (discussing similar provision

3 We express no opinion as to whether any other entity within the Judicial Branch might be an "agency" within the meaning of $ 6.

requiring adherence to presumptive definition unless context"indicate[d]" a different meaning).

In Rowland, we explained the proper method of analyzinga statutory term's "context" to determine when a presumptive definition must yield. Such an analysis, we explained,requires a court to examine "the text of the Act of Congress
surrounding the word at issue, or the texts of other relatedcongressional Acts . . . ."

Id., at 199; see also id., at 212-213(
Thomas, J., dissenting); Monell v. New York City Dept. of
Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 689-690, n. 53 (1978). Reviewof other materials is not warranted. "If Congress had

meant to point further afield, as to legislative history, forexample, it would have been natural to use a more spacious
phrase, like `evidence of congressional intent,' in place of`context.' "

Rowland, 506 U. S., at 200.In the case of $ 1001, there is nothing in the text of the

statute, or in any related legislation, that even suggests--letalone "shows"--that the normal definition of "department"
was not intended. Accordingly, a straightforward interpre-tation of the text of $ 1001, with special emphasis on the
words "department or agency," would seem to lead inexora-bly to the conclusion that there is no need for any judicial
function exception because the reach of the statute simplydoes not extend to courts. Our task, however, is complicated by the fact that the Court interpreted "department"broadly 40 years ago in

Bramblett. We must, therefore,

4 Congress' use of the word "shows" is unsurprising in view of the fact
that 18 U. S. C. $ 6 provides statutory definitions exclusively for criminal
statutes. We have often emphasized the need for clarity in the definition
of criminal statutes, to provide "fair warning . . . in language that the
common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain
line is passed." McBoyle v. United States, 283 U. S. 25, 27 (1931). See
also United States v. Batchelder, 442 U. S. 114, 123 (1979); Lanzetta v. New
Jersey, 306 U. S. 451, 453 (1939). Adhering to the statutory definition of
a particular term is fully consistent with this objective. Cf. Rowland, 506
U. S., at 199 (construing 1 U. S. C. $ 1, which is generally applicable to any
Act of Congress).

702 HUBBARD v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
turn our attention to that case before deciding the fate of thejudicial function exception.

III
Defendant Bramblett was a former Member of Congresswho had falsely represented to the Disbursing Office of the

House of Representatives that a particular person was enti-tled to compensation as his official clerk. He argued that he
could not be convicted under $ 1001 because his falsehoodwas directed to an office within the Legislative Branch. 348
U. S., at 504. The Court rejected this argument, concludingthat the word "department," as used in $ 1001, "was meant
to describe the executive, legislative and judicial branches ofthe Government."

Id., at 509. Although Bramblett in-volved Congress, not the courts, the text and reasoning in

the Court's opinion amalgamated all three branches of theGovernment. Thus,

Bramblett is highly relevant here eventhough its narrow holding only extended $ 1001 to false statements made within the Legislative Branch.We think Bramblett must be acknowledged as a seriously
flawed decision. Significantly, the Bramblett Court made noattempt to reconcile its interpretation with the usual meaning of "department." It relied instead on a review of theevolution of $ 1001 and its statutory cousin, the false claims
statute presently codified at 18 U. S. C. $ 287, as providing a"context" for the conclusion that "Congress could not have
intended to leave frauds such as [Bramblett's] without pen-alty." 348 U. S., at 509. We are convinced that the Court
erred by giving insufficient weight to the plain language of$$ 6 and 1001.

5 Although the historical evolution of a stat5 In addition, it is debatable at best whether the Court was correct in
asserting that, but for its expansive interpretation of $ 1001, Bramblett's
fraud would necessarily have gone unpunished. In discussing the evolution of $ 1001, the Court noted that the false claims statute, originally
enacted in 1863 and by 1955 codified at 18 U. S. C. $ 287, "clearly covers
the presentation of false claims against any component of the Government

Opinion of the Court
ute--based on decisions by the entire Congress--should notbe discounted for the reasons that may undermine confidence

in the significance of excerpts from congressional debatesand committee reports,

6 a historical analysis normally provides less guidance to a statute's meaning than its final text.In the ordinary case, absent any "indication that doing so

would frustrate Congress's clear intention or yield patent ab-surdity, our obligation is to apply the statute as Congress
wrote it." BFP v. Resolution Trust Corporation, 511 U. S.531, 570 (1994) (

Souter, J., dissenting).As noted above, a straightforward reading of the statute

suggests a meaning of "department" that is fully consistentwith the definition set forth in $ 6. See

supra, at 699-702.Similarly unremarkable is the language of the original Act

of Congress adopting what is now $ 1001. That piece of leg-islation--the Act of June 18, 1934, 48 Stat. 996 (1934 Act)--

to any officer of the Government." United States v. Bramblett, 348 U. S.
503, 505 (1955). In an earlier decision, it had interpreted "claim" in the
false claims statute broadly, explaining that the word referred to "a claim
for money or property to which a right is asserted against the Government, based upon the Government's own liability to the claimant."
United States v. Cohn, 270 U. S. 339, 345-346 (1926). Bramblett could
thus seemingly have been charged with violating $ 287, or at least aiding
and abetting in a violation of that statute, since his misrepresentation
was intended to procure Government compensation. See Supplemental
Memorandum for the United States in United States v. Bramblett, O. T.
1954, No. 159 (arguing that Bramblett's conviction could be affirmed because his conduct violated all the elements of $ 287). In today's decision,
we do not disturb the scope of $ 287 as construed in either Cohn or
Bramblett.

Bramblett's fraud also was arguably directed at an "agency" within the
meaning of $ 1001. The Court recognized this contention, noting "it might
be argued, as the Government does, that the [Disbursing Office] is an
`authority' within the $ 6 definition of `agency.' " 348 U. S., at 509. The
Court refused, however, to rest its decision on that more narrow interpretation. Ibid.

Opinion of the Court
amended what was then $ 35 of the Criminal Code to provide,in pertinent part:

"[W]hoever shall knowingly and willfully falsify or con-ceal or cover up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or make or cause to be made any false or fraud-ulent statements or representations, or make or use or
cause to be made or used any false bill, receipt, voucher,roll, account, claim, certificate, affidavit, or deposition,
knowing the same to contain any fraudulent or fictitiousstatement or entry,

in any matter within the jurisdic-tion of any department or agency of the United States

or of any corporation in which the United States ofAmerica is a stockholder . . . [shall be punished]." (Emphasis added.)
This language conveys no different message regarding "de-partment" than the current version of $ 1001.

What, then, of the earlier statutory history chronicled in
Bramblett? We believe it is at best inconclusive, and thatit does not supply a "context" sufficiently clear to warrant

departure from the presumptive definition in 18 U. S. C. $ 6.The earliest statutory progenitor of $ 1001 was the original
false claims statute, adopted as the Act of Mar. 2, 1863, ch. 67,12 Stat. 696 (1863 Act). That enactment made it a criminal
offense for any person, whether a civilian or a member of themilitary services, to

"present or cause to be presented for payment or ap-proval to or by any person or officer in the civil or military service of the United States, any claim upon oragainst the Government of the United States, or any
department or officer thereof, knowing such claim to befalse, fictitious, or fraudulent."

7 In Bramblett, the Court incorrectly stated that the 1863 Act only penalized misconduct by members of the military. In fact, $ 3 of the Act
established criminal and civil penalties for false claims and other misdeeds

705Cite as: 514 U. S. 695 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
The 1863 Act also proscribed false statements, but the scope
of that provision was far narrower than that of modern-day

$ 1001; the Act prohibited only those false statements made
"for the purpose of obtaining, or aiding in obtaining, the approval or payment of [a false] claim." 12 Stat. 696. The
Court explained in Bramblett that the false claims provision
in the 1863 Act "clearly cover[ed] the presentation of false
claims against any component of the Government to any officer of the Government," 348 U. S., at 505, and it asserted
similar breadth for the false statement portion of the Act,
ibid.

The false statements provision in the 1863 Act remained
essentially unchanged for 55 years.8 In 1918, Congress
amended the statute to provide as follows:

"[W]hoever, for the purpose of obtaining or aiding to
obtain the payment or approval of [a false] claim, or for
the purpose and with the intent of cheating and swindling or defrauding the Government of the United
States, or any department thereof, or any corporation
in which the United States of America is a stockholder,
shall knowingly and willfully falsify or conceal or
cover up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact,
or make or cause to be made any false or fraudulent
statements or representations, or make or use or cause
to be made or used any false bill, receipt, voucher, roll,
account, claim, certificate, affidavit, or deposition, knowing the same to contain any fraudulent or fictitious
statement or entry [shall be punished]." Act of Oct. 23,

committed by "any person not in the military or naval forces of the United
States." 12 Stat. 698.

8 In 1873, the statute was codified and minor changes were made. See

Rev. Stat. $ 5438. The penalties were changed in the Act of May 30, 1908,
35 Stat. 555, and the statute was recodified as $ 35 of the Criminal Code
in the Act of Mar. 4, 1909, 35 Stat. 1095.

706 HUBBARD v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
1918, ch. 194, 40 Stat. 1015-1016 (1918 Act) (emphasisadded).

The scope of this new provision is unclear. Although itcould be read to create criminal liability for governmentwide false statements, its principal purpose seems to havebeen to prohibit false statements made to defraud Government corporations, which flourished during World War I.Cf. Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513
U. S. 374, 386-391 (1995) (tracing history of Government cor-porations). In one important respect, moreover, the statute
remained relatively narrow: It was limited to false state-ments intended to bilk the Government out of money or
property. See United States v. Cohn, 270 U. S. 339 (1926).Given the continuing focus on financial frauds against the
Government, the 1918 Act did not alter the fundamentalcharacter of the original false claims statute.

The 1934 Act, which created the statute we now know as$ 1001, did work such a change. Congress excised from the
statute the references to financial frauds, thereby severingthe historical link with the false claims portion of the statute,
and inserted the requirement that the false statement bemade "in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States." This addition, criti-cal for present purposes, is subject to two competing inferences. On one hand, it can be read to impose new words oflimitation--whose ordinary meaning connotes the Executive
Branch--in an altogether reformulated statute. On theother hand, it can be viewed as stripping away the financial
fraud requirement while not disturbing the pre-existingbreadth the statute had enjoyed from its association with the
false claims statute.The Bramblett Court embraced the latter inference, finding no indication in any legislative history that the amend-ment was intended to narrow the scope of the statute. We
think this interpretation, though not completely implausible,is nevertheless unsound. The differences between the 1934

Opinion of the Court
Act and its predecessors are too dramatic to evidence a con-gressional intent to carry forward any features of the old

provision. Moreover, our comments, over the years, regard-ing the 1934 legislation--including those contained in

Bramblett itself--contradict the notion that such a "carry forward" occurred.We have repeatedly recognized that the 1934 Act was

passed at the behest of "the Secretary of the Interior to aidthe enforcement of laws relating to the functions of the Department of the Interior and, in particular, to the enforce-ment of regulations . . . with respect to the transportation of
`hot oil.' " United States v. Gilliland, 312 U. S. 86, 93-94(1941); see also

United States v. Yermian, 468 U. S. 63, 72
(1984) (the 1934 Act was "needed to increase the protection
of federal agencies from the variety of deceptive practicesplaguing the New Deal administration");

id., at 80 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (the statute was prompted by problemsarising from "the advent of the New Deal programs in the

1930's"). Indeed, the Bramblett Court itself acknowledgedthe connection between the 1934 Act and the proliferation of
fraud in the newly formed Executive agencies:

"The 1934 revision was largely the product of the urging of the Secretary of the Interior. The Senate Re-port, S. Rep. No. 1202, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., indicates that

its purpose was to broaden the statute so as to reach notonly false papers presented in connection with a claim
against the Government, but also nonmonetary frauds
such as those involved in the `hot-oil' shipments." 348U. S., at 507.

None of our opinions refers to any indication that Congress
even considered whether the 1934 Act might apply outside
the Executive Branch, much less that it affirmatively understood the new enactment to create broad liability for falsehoods in the federal courts. In light of this vacuum, it would
be curious indeed if Congress truly intended the 1934 Act to

Opinion of Stevens, J.
work a dramatic alteration in the law governing misconductin the court system or the Legislature. The unlikelihood

of such a scenario only strengthens our conclusion that theBramblett Court erred in its interpretation of $ 1001's statutory history.Putting

Bramblett's historical misapprehensions to oneside, however, we believe the Bramblett Court committed a

far more basic error in its underlying approach to statutoryconstruction. Courts should not rely on inconclusive statutory history as a basis for refusing to give effect to the plainlanguage of an Act of Congress, particularly when the Legislature has specifically defined the controverted term. In
Bramblett, the Court's method of analysis resulted in a deci-sion that is at war with the text of not one, but two different

Acts of Congress.Whether the doctrine of stare decisis nevertheless requires that we accept Bramblett's erroneous interpretationof $ 1001 is a question best answered after reviewing the
body of law directly at issue: the decisions adopting the judi-cial function exception.

IV
Although other federal courts have refrained from directlycriticizing

Bramblett's approach to statutory construction, itis fair to say that they have greeted the decision with something less than a warm embrace. The judicial function ex-ception, an obvious attempt to impose limits on

Bramblett'sexpansive reading of $ 1001, is a prime example. As the following discussion indicates, the judicial function exception isalmost as deeply rooted as Bramblett itself.

The seeds of the exception were planted by the Court ofAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit only seven years
after Bramblett was decided. In Morgan v. United States,309 F. 2d 234 (1962), cert. denied, 373 U. S. 917 (1963), the
defendant, who had falsely held himself out to be a bona fidemember of the bar, was prosecuted on three counts of violating $ 1001 for concealing from the court his name, identity,

709Cite as: 514 U. S. 695 (1995)
Opinion of Stevens, J.
and nonadmission to the bar. After first acknowledging
that, but for Bramblett, it might well have accepted the argument that Congress did not intend $ 1001 to apply to the
courts, the Court of Appeals upheld the conviction. But the
court was clearly troubled by the potential sweep of $ 1001.
Noting that the statute prohibits "concealment" and "covering up" of material facts, as well as intentional falsehoods,
the court wondered whether the statute might be interpreted to criminalize conduct that falls well within the
bounds of responsible advocacy.9 The court concluded its
opinion with this significant comment:

"We are certain that neither Congress nor the Supreme
Court intended the statute to include traditional trial
tactics within the statutory terms `conceals or covers
up.' We hold only, on the authority of the Supreme
Court construction, that the statute does apply to the
type of action with which appellant was charged, action
which essentially involved the `administrative' or `housekeeping' functions, not the `judicial' machinery of the
court." 309 F. 2d, at 237.

Relying on Morgan, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit reversed a conviction several years later "because

$ 1001 does not apply to the introduction of false documents
as evidence in a criminal proceeding." United States v. Erhardt, 381 F. 2d 173, 175 (1967) (per curiam). The court
explained that the judicial function exception suggested in
Morgan was necessary to prevent the perjury statute, with
its two-witness rule (since repealed), from being undermined. 381 F. 2d, at 175.

9 " `Does a defendant "cover up . . . a material fact" when he pleads not
guilty?' `Does an attorney "cover up" when he moves to exclude hearsay
testimony he knows to be true, or when he makes a summation on behalf
of a client he knows to be guilty?' " Morgan v. United States, 309 F. 2d
234, 237 (CADC 1962), cert. denied, 373 U. S. 917 (1963).

710 HUBBARD v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Once planted, the judicial function exception began to
flower in a number of other Circuits. The Ninth Circuit
summarized the state of the law in 1985:

"[T]he adjudicative functions exception to section 1001
has been suggested or recognized by appellate decisions
since 1962, not long after the Supreme Court decided
that section 1001 applies to matters within the jurisdiction of the judicial branch. In these twenty-three
years, there has been no response on the part of
Congress either repudiating the limitation or refining it.
It therefore seems too late in the day to hold that no
exception exists." United States v. Mayer, 775 F. 2d
1387, 1390 (per curiam) (footnote omitted).

The Second Circuit sounded a similar theme in 1991, relying
in part on the congressional acquiescence to which the Ninth
Circuit had adverted in Mayer. The Second Circuit wrote:

"No court, to our knowledge, whether due to its acceptance of the exception or to prosecutorial reticence,
has ever sustained a section 1001 conviction for false
statements made by a defendant to a court acting in its
judicial capacity. The exception was first articulated
nearly thirty years ago and `. . . [i]t therefore seems too
late in the day to hold that no exception exists.' Mayer,
775 F. 2d at 1390." United States v. Masterpol, 940
F. 2d 760, 766.10

10 Some 17 years before Masterpol, the Second Circuit restricted the
application of $ 1001 in a slightly different manner. In United States v.
D'Amato, 507 F. 2d 26 (1974), the court overturned a $ 1001 conviction
arising out of a false affidavit submitted in the course of a private civil
lawsuit. Based upon a review of relevant case law and legislative history,
the court concluded that $ 1001 did not apply "where the Government is
involved only by way of a court deciding a matter in which the Government or its agencies are not involved." Id., at 28. Accord, United States
v. London, 714 F. 2d 1558, 1561-1562 (CA11 1983).

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Although not all of the courts of appeals have endorsedthe judicial function exception, it is nevertheless clear that

the doctrine has a substantial following. See n. 2, supra.Moreover, as both the Ninth and the Second Circuits observed, Congress has not seen fit to repudiate, limit, or refinethe exception despite its somewhat murky borders and its
obvious tension with the text of the statute as construed in
Bramblett. On the other hand, it is also true that Congresshas not seen fit to overturn the holding in Bramblett, despite

the fact that the opinions endorsing the judicial function ex-ception evidence a good deal of respectful skepticism about
the correctness of that decision.

V
With the foregoing considerations in mind, we now turn tothe difficult

stare decisis question that this case presents.It is, of course, wise judicial policy to adhere to rules announced in earlier cases. As Justice Cardozo reminded us:"The labor of judges would be increased almost to the breaking point if every past decision could be reopened in everycase, and one could not lay one's own course of bricks on the
secure foundation of the courses laid by others who had gonebefore him." B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process
149 (1921). Adherence to precedent also serves an indis-pensable institutional role within the Federal Judiciary.
Stare decisis is "a basic self-governing principle within theJudicial Branch, which is entrusted with the sensitive and
difficult task of fashioning and preserving a jurisprudentialsystem that is not based upon `an arbitrary discretion.' "
Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172 (1989)(quoting The Federalist No. 78, p. 490 (H. Lodge ed. 1888)
(A. Hamilton)). See also Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 854-855 (1992) ( joint opinionof

O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.). Respect forprecedent is strongest "in the area of statutory construction,

where Congress is free to change this Court's interpretation

of its legislation." Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U. S.720, 736 (1977).

11

In this case, these considerations point in two conflictingdirections. On one hand, they counsel adherence to the construction of $ 1001 adopted in Bramblett; on the other, theyargue in favor of retaining the body of law that has cut back
on the breadth of Bramblett in Circuits from coast to coast.It would be difficult to achieve both goals simultaneously.
For if the word "department" encompasses the Judiciary, as
Bramblett stated, 348 U. S., at 509, the judicial functionexception cannot be squared with the text of the statute.

A court is a court--and is part of the Judicial Branch--whether it is functioning in a housekeeping or judicial capacity. Conversely, Bramblett could not stand if we preservedthe thrust of the judicial function exception--

i. e., if we in-terpreted 18 U. S. C. $ 1001 so that it did not reach conduct

occurring in federal-court proceedings. Again, althoughBramblett involved a false representation to an office within
the Legislative Branch, the decision lumped all threebranches together in one and the same breath. See 384
U. S., at 509 ("department" in $ 1001 "was meant to describethe executive, legislative and judicial branches of the
Government").

11 See also, e. g., Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S., at 172-173
(stare decisis has "special force in the area of statutory interpretation, for
here, unlike in the context of constitutional interpretation, the legislative
power is implicated, and Congress remains free to alter what we have
done"); Square D Co. v. Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau, Inc., 476 U. S.

decided"); Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406 (1932)

settled than that it be settled right. This is commonly true, even where

Opinion of Stevens, J.
We think the text of $ 1001 forecloses any argument thatwe should simply ratify the body of cases adopting the judicial function exception. We are, however, persuaded thatthe clarity of that text justifies a reconsideration of Bramblett.12 Although such a reconsideration is appropriate onlyin the rarest circumstances, we believe this case permits
it because of a highly unusual "intervening development ofthe law," see

Patterson, 491 U. S., at 173, and because ofthe absence of significant reliance interests in adhering to

Bramblett.The "intervening development" is, of course, the judicial
function exception. In a virtually unbroken line of cases,respected federal judges have interpreted $ 1001 so narrowly
that it has had only a limited application within the JudicialBranch. See nn. 2 and 10,

supra. This interpretation hasroots both deep and broad in the lower courts. Although

the judicial function exception has not been adopted by thisCourt, our review of

Bramblett supports the conclusion that
the cases endorsing the exception almost certainly reflect theintent of Congress. It is thus fair to characterize the judicial function exception as a "competing legal doctrin[e]," Patterson, 491 U. S., at 173, that can lay a legitimate claim torespect as a settled body of law. Overruling

Bramblett
would preserve the essence of this doctrine and would, tothat extent, promote stability in the law.

13

12 Because the fate of the judicial function exception is tied so closely
to Bramblett, we find no merit in the Government's suggestion that a
reconsideration of the validity of that decision is not fairly included in the
question on which we granted certiorari. See generally Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U. S. 374, 379-383 (1995).

13 The dissent criticizes us for according respect to a body of law developed in the lower courts, arguing that our decision will "induce" federal
judges on the courts of appeals to "ignore" precedents from this Court
and thereby invite chaos in the judicial system. Post, at 721. We would
have thought it self-evident that the lower courts must adhere to our precedents. Indeed, the dissent's dire prediction is at odds with its own observation that "no lower court would deliberately refuse to follow the decision

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Stare decisis has special force when legislators or citizens"have acted in reliance on a previous decision, for in this

instance overruling the decision would dislodge settledrights and expectations or require an extensive legislative
response." Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways
Comm'n, 502 U. S. 197, 202 (1991); see also Casey, 505 U. S.,at 854-856 ( joint opinion of

O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.). Here, however, the reliance interests at stake inadhering to Bramblett are notably modest. In view of the

extensive array of statutes that already exist to penalizefalse statements within the Judicial Branch, see, e. g., 18
U. S. C. $ 1621 (perjury); $ 1623 (false declarations beforegrand jury or court); $ 1503 (obstruction of justice); $ 287
(false claims against the United States), we doubt that prose-cutors have relied on $ 1001 as an important means of deterring and punishing litigation-related misconduct.14 But weneed not speculate, for we have direct evidence on this point.
The United States Attorneys' Manual states quite plainlythat "[p]rosecutions should not be brought under 18 U. S. C.

$ 1001 for false statements submitted in federal court pro-ceedings"; it instead directs prosecutors to proceed under the
perjury or obstruction of justice statutes. U. S. Dept. of
of a higher court," see post, at 720. In concluding that the cases adopting
the judicial function exception are faithful to the intent of the Legislature
that adopted $ 1001, we have obviously exercised our own independent
judgment. Thus, far from "subvert[ing] the very principle on which a
hierarchical court system is built," post, at 719, our decision merely reflects our assessment of the statutory construction issue this case presents, while serving what the dissent acknowledges to be one of the central purposes of stare decisis: promoting "stability and certainty in the
law," post, at 720.

14 The perjury and false claims statutes also cover the Legislative

Branch, as does 18 U. S. C. $ 1505 (obstruction of justice). The existence
of overlaps with other statutes does not itself militate in favor of overruling Bramblett; Congress may, and often does, enact separate criminal statutes that may, in practice, cover some of the same conduct. See United
States v. Batchelder, 442 U. S., at 123-124; United States v. Gilliland, 312
U. S. 86, 95 (1941). The overlaps here simply demonstrate that prosecutors cannot be said to have any significant reliance interest in Bramblett.

15

Similarly unimpressive is the notion of congressional reli-ance on

Bramblett. The longstanding judicial function exception has, to a large extent, negated the actual applicationof $ 1001 within the Judiciary. It is unlikely that Congress

has relied on what has, for many years, been an unfulfilled
promise.In sum, although the

stare decisis issue in this case is difficult, we conclude that there are sound reasons to correct
Bramblett's erroneous construction of $ 1001. Although we
could respect prior decisions by endorsing the judicial func-tion exception or by adhering to

Bramblett while repudiating that exception, we believe coherence and stability in the
law will best be served in this case by taking a differentcourse. Limiting the coverage of $ 1001 to the area plainly

marked by its text will, as a practical matter, preserve theinterpretation of $ 1001 that has prevailed for over 30 years
and will best serve the administration of justice in the future.

VI
Bramblett is hereby overruled. We hold that a federal
court is neither a "department" nor an "agency" within themeaning of $ 1001. The Court of Appeals' decision is therefore reversed to the extent that it upheld petitioner's convic-tions under $ 1001.

It is so ordered.
15 The absence of significant reliance interests is confirmed by an examination of statistical data regarding actual cases brought under $ 1001.
The Government has secured convictions under $ 1001 in 2,247 cases over
the last five fiscal years, see post, at 722, but the dissent can identify only
five reported $ 1001 cases in that time period brought in connection with
false statements made to the Judiciary and Legislature. Post, at 723,
n. (At least two of the five were unsuccessful, from the Government's
point of view.) This tiny handful of prosecutions does not, in our view,
evidence a weighty reliance interest on the part of prosecutors in adhering
to the interpretation of $ 1001 set forth in Bramblett.

716 HUBBARD v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of Scalia, J.
Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Kennedy joins,
concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

I concur in the judgment of the Court, and join Parts I-III
and VI of Justice Stevens' opinion. United States v.
Bramblett, 348 U. S. 503 (1955), should be overruled.

The doctrine of stare decisis protects the legitimate expectations of those who live under the law, and, as Alexander
Hamilton observed, is one of the means by which exercise
of "an arbitrary discretion in the courts" is restrained, The
Federalist No. 78, p. 471 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). Who ignores
it must give reasons, and reasons that go beyond mere demonstration that the overruled opinion was wrong (otherwise
the doctrine would be no doctrine at all).

The reason here, as far as I am concerned, is the demonstration, over time, that Bramblett has unacceptable consequences, which can be judicially avoided (absent overruling)
only by limiting Bramblett in a manner that is irrational or
by importing exceptions with no basis in law. Unlike Justice Stevens, I do not regard the Courts of Appeals' attempts to limit Bramblett as an " `intervening development
of the law,' " ante, at 713 (quoting Patterson v. McLean
Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 173 (1989)), that puts us to a
choice between two conflicting lines of authority. Such "intervening developments" by lower courts that we do not
agree with are ordinarily disposed of by reversal. See, e. g.,
McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350 (1987). Instead, the
significance I find in the fact that so many Courts of Appeals
have strained so mightily to discern an exception that the
statute does not contain, see ante, at 699, n. 2 (collecting
cases), is that it demonstrates how great a potential for mischief federal judges have discovered in the mistaken reading
of 18 U. S. C. $ 1001, a potential we did not fully appreciate
when Bramblett was decided. To be sure, since 18 U. S. C.

$ 1001's prohibition of concealment is violated only when

Kingston, 971 F. 2d 481, 489 (CA10 1992); United States v.
Richeson, 825 F. 2d 17, 20 (CA4 1987); United States v. Irwin,
654 F. 2d 671, 678-679 (CA10 1981), cert. denied, 455 U. S.
1016 (1982), it does not actually prohibit any legitimate trial
tactic. There remains, however, a serious concern that the
threat of criminal prosecution under the capacious provisions
of $ 1001 will deter vigorous representation of opposing interests in adversarial litigation, particularly representation
of criminal defendants, whose adversaries control the machinery of $ 1001 prosecution.

One could avoid the problem by accepting the Courts of
Appeals' invention of a "judicial function" exception, but
there is simply no basis in the text of the statute for that.
Similarly unprincipled would be rejecting Bramblett's dictum that $ 1001 applies to the courts, while adhering to
Bramblett's holding that $ 1001 applies to Congress. This
would construct a bizarre regime in which "department"
means the Executive and Legislative Branches, but not the
Judicial, thereby contradicting not only the statute's intent
(as Bramblett does), but, in addition, all conceivable interpretations of the English language. Neither of these solutions
furthers the goal of avoiding "an arbitrary discretion in the
courts"; they seem to me much more arbitrary than simply
overruling a wrongly decided case.

The other goal of stare decisis, preserving justifiable expectations, is not much at risk here. Those whose reliance
on Bramblett induced them to tell the truth to Congress or
the courts, instead of lying, have no claim on our solicitude.
Some convictions obtained under Bramblett may have to be
overturned, and in a few instances wrongdoers may go free
who could have been prosecuted and convicted under a different statute if Bramblett had not been assumed to be the
law. I count that a small price to pay for the uprooting of
this weed.

718 HUBBARD v. UNITED STATES

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice O'Connor and Justice Souter join, dissenting.

The bankruptcy trustee objected to the discharge of peti-tioner, a voluntary bankrupt, believing that he had filed false

information. The trustee filed a complaint under 11 U. S. C.$ 727, alleging petitioner stored a well-drilling machine at his
residence; petitioner answered by denying the allegation "forthe reason that it is untrue." App. 12, || 10. The trustee
also alleged in a separate motion that petitioner had, despiterequests, failed to turn over all the books and records relating to the bankruptcy estate. Petitioner filed a response denying the allegation, and asserting that he had produced therequested documents at the behest of a previous trustee.

Petitioner was then indicted under 18 U. S. C. $ 1001, and a
jury found that each of these responses was a lie.Today, the majority jettisons a 40-year-old unanimous decision of this Court, United States v. Bramblett, 348 U. S. 503(1955), under which petitioner's conviction plainly would
have been upheld. It does so despite an admission that theCourt's reading of $ 1001 in

Bramblett was "not completely
implausible," ante, at 706. In replacing Bramblett's plausi-ble, albeit arguably flawed, interpretation of the statute with

its own "sound" reading, the Court disrespects the traditionally stringent adherence to stare decisis in statutory deci-sions.

Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164,
172 (1989); Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U. S. 720, 736(1977). The two reasons offered by the plurality in Part V

of the opinion and the justification offered by the concurringopinion fall far short of the institutional hurdle erected by
our past practice against overruling a decision of this Courtinterpreting an Act of Congress.

The first reason is styled as an "intervening development
in the law"; under it, decisions of Courts of Appeals that can-not be reconciled with our earlier precedent are treated as a

basis for disavowing, not the aberrant Court of Appeals deci514us3$56H 06-11-98 18:04:53 PAGES OPINPGT

sions, but, mirabile dictu our own decision! This novel cor-ollary to the principle of

stare decisis subverts the very principle on which a hierarchical court system is built. The sec-ond reason given is that there has been little or no reliance

on our Bramblett decision; I believe that this ground is quite
debatable, if not actually erroneous.Today's decision harkens to the important reason behind

the doctrine of stare decisis, but does not heed it. That doc-trine is "a basic self-governing principle within the Judicial
Branch, which is entrusted with the sensitive and difficulttask of fashioning and preserving a jurisprudential system
that is not based upon `an arbitrary discretion.' " Patterson,
supra, at 172, citing The Federalist No. 78, p. 490 (H. Lodge
ed. 1888) (A. Hamilton). Respect for precedent is strongest
"in the area of statutory construction, where Congress isfree to change this Court's interpretation of its legislation."

Illinois Brick Co., supra, at 736. Justice Brandeis' dissent-ing opinion in

Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S.
393 (1932), made the point this way:

"Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most
matters it is more important that the applicable rule of
law be settled than that it be settled right. This is commonly true even where the error is a matter of serious
concern, provided correction can be had by legislation."
Id., at 406 (citations omitted).

We have recognized a very limited exception to this principle for what had been called "intervening developments in
the law." But the cases exemplifying this principle, e. g.,
Andrews v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 406 U. S. 320
(1972); Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express,
Inc., 490 U. S. 477 (1989), have invariably made clear that the
"intervening developments" were in the case law of this
Court, not of the lower federal courts. Indeed, in Illinois
Brick Co., we refused to follow a line of lower court decisions

514us3$56H 06-11-98 18:04:53 PAGES OPINPGT
720 HUBBARD v. UNITED STATES

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
which had carved out an exception from one of our prece-dents. 431 U. S., at 743-744.

But today's decision departs radically from the previouslylimited reliance on this exception. The principle of

stare decisis is designed to promote stability and certainty in the
law. While most often invoked to justify a court's refusal toreconsider its own decisions, it applies

a fortiori to enjoin
lower courts to follow the decision of a higher court. Thisprinciple is so firmly established in our jurisprudence that

no lower court would deliberately refuse to follow the deci-sion of a higher court. But cases come in all shapes and
varieties, and it is not always clear whether a precedent applies to a situation in which some of the facts are different
from those in the decided case. Here lower courts must necessarily make judgments as to how far beyond its particular
facts the higher court precedent extends.

If there is appeal as a matter of right from the lower court
to the higher court, any decision by the lower court that is
viewed as mistaken by the higher court will in the normal
course of events be corrected in short order by reversal on
appeal. But in the present day federal court system, where
review by this Court is almost entirely discretionary, a different regime prevails. We receive nearly 7,000 petitions
for certiorari every Term, and can grant only a tiny fraction
of them. A high degree of selectivity is thereby enjoined
upon us in exercising our certiorari jurisdiction, and our
Rule 10 embodies the standards by which we decide to grant
review. One of the reasons contained in Rule 10.1(a) is the
existence of a conflict between one court of appeals and another. The negative implication of this ground, borne out
time and again in our decisions to grant and deny certiorari,
is that ordinarily a court of appeals decision interpreting one
of our precedents--even one deemed to be arguably inconsistent with it--will not be reviewed unless it conflicts with a
decision of another court of appeals. This fact is a necessary
concomitant of the limited capacity in this Court.

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
One of the consequences of this highly selective standardfor granting review is that this Court is deprived of a very

important means of assuring that the courts of appeals ad-here to its precedents. It is all the more important, therefore, that no actual inducements to ignore these precedents
be offered to the courts of appeals. But today's decision isjust such an inducement; it tells courts of appeals that if they

build up a body of case law contrary to ours, their case lawwill serve as a basis for overruling our precedent. It is difficult to imagine a more topsy-turvy doctrine than this, orone more likely to unsettle established legal rules that the
doctrine of stare decisis is designed to protect.

The plurality attempts to bolster this aspect of its opinion
by blandly assuring us that "the cases endorsing the exception almost certainly reflect the intent of Congress." Ante,
at 713. Members of Congress will surely be surprised by
this statement. Congress has not amended or considered
amending $ 1001 in the 40 years since Bramblett was decided.
We have often noted the danger in relying on congressional
inaction in construing a statute, Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507
U. S. 619, 632 (1993), citing Schneidewind v. ANR Pipeline
Co., 485 U. S. 293, 306 (1988), but even there the "inaction"
referred to is a failure of Congress to enact a particular
proposal. Here there was not even any proposal before
Congress.

If we delve more deeply into the hypothetical thought
processes of a very diligent Member of Congress who made
a specialty of following cases construing $ 1001, the Member
would undoubtedly know of our decision in Bramblett 40
years ago. If he also followed decisions of the courts of
appeals, he would know that in various forms--whether a
"judicial function" exception or an "exculpatory no" rule--
several Courts of Appeals have held $ 1001 inapplicable to
some statements made in the course of judicial proceedings.
If, after due deliberation, he concluded that this exception
was inconsistent with our opinion in Bramblett, he would

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
surely also realize that in due course, on the assumption thatthe Judiciary was functioning as it should, the Supreme

Court would itself decide that the exception was inconsistentwith

Bramblett, and disavow the exception. But of one
thing he would have been in no doubt: that under Bramblett
one who lied to an officer of Congress was punishable under$ 1001, since that was the precise holding of

Bramblett. But
it is that very justifiable expectation of Congress that isset at naught by today's decision, under which the legislative process is no longer protected by $ 1001.The plurality offers a second reason in defense of its decision to overrule Bramblett. It points to a lack of significant
reliance interests in Bramblett. It dispels any reliance
prosecutors might have in enforcement of $ 1001 by arguing
that the Government has expressed a preference for proceeding under alternative statutes that punish comparable
behavior. U. S. Dept. of Justice, United States Attorneys'
Manual || 9-69.267 (1992). The Government offered a convincing explanation for this preference: it instructs prosecutors to proceed under alternative statutes due to the uncertain mine field posed by the judicial function exception
adopted in some, but not all, Circuits. Brief for Petitioner
20, and n. 9. I do not think the Government disclaims reliance by adopting a defensive litigating strategy in response
to the choice of lower courts to disregard precedent favorable
to the Government. And in this particular case, the perjury
alternative in 18 U. S. C. $ 1621 was altogether unavailable
to punish petitioner's falsehoods because his statements
were not verified, and the obstruction of justice alternative
in 18 U. S. C. $ 1503 was of dubious utility.

Statistics compiled by the Administrative Office of the
United States Courts indicate that the Government has secured convictions under $ 1001 in 2,247 cases over the last
five fiscal years. Because the Administrative Office does not
break down its statistics by type of agency to which the defendant made a false statement, further exploration of the

subject must be limited to published decisions. It is unclearwhat proportion of these cases involved false statements

made to the Legislative or Judicial Branch, but it appearsthat the Government has attempted to proceed under $ 1001
for false statements made to the Judiciary and Legislaturewith mixed success.* To the extent it has secured valid convictions in some courts in reliance on Bramblett, the Govern-ment should not now be forced to endure requests for habeas
relief that will inevitably be filed in the wake of the Court'sopinion.

The additional comments set forth in the concurring opin-ion equally disregard the respect due a unanimous decision
rendered by six Justices who took the same oath of officesworn by the six Justices who overrule Bramblett today.
The doctrine of stare decisis presumes to reinforce the notionthat justice is dispensed according to law and not to serve

The opinion of one Justice that another's view of a statute was wrong, even really wrong, doesnot overcome the institutional advantages conferred by adherence to stare decisis in cases where the wrong is fullyredressable by a coordinate branch of government.

This, then, is clearly a case where it is better that thematter be decided than that it be decided right.

Bramblettgoverns this case, and if the rule of that case is to be overturned it should be at the hands of Congress, and not ofthis Court.

CITY OF EDMONDS v. OXFORD HOUSE, INC., et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 94-23. Argued March 1, 1995--Decided May 15, 1995
Respondent Oxford House operates a group home in Edmonds, Washington, for 10 to 12 adults recovering from alcoholism and drug addiction
in a neighborhood zoned for single-family residences. Petitioner City
of Edmonds (City) issued citations to the owner and a resident of the
house, charging violation of the City's zoning code. The code provides
that the occupants of single-family dwelling units must compose a "family," and defines family as "persons [without regard to number] related
by genetics, adoption, or marriage, or a group of five or fewer [unrelated] persons." Edmonds Community Development Code (ECDC)

$ 21.30.010. Oxford House asserted reliance on the Fair Housing Act
(FHA), which prohibits discrimination in housing against, inter alios,
persons with handicaps. Discrimination covered by the FHA includes
"a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford
[handicapped] person[s] equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling."
42 U. S. C. $ 3604(f)(3)(B). Edmonds subsequently sued Oxford House
in federal court, seeking a declaration that the FHA does not constrain
the City's zoning code family definition rule. Oxford House counterclaimed under the FHA, charging the City with failure to make a "reasonable accommodation" permitting the maintenance of the group home
in a single-family zone. Respondent United States filed a separate action on the same FHA "reasonable accommodation" ground, and the
cases were consolidated. The District Court held that the City's zoning
code rule defining "family," ECDC $ 21.30.010, is exempt from the FHA
under 42 U. S. C. $ 3607(b)(1) as a "reasonable . . . restrictio[n] regarding
the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling."
The Court of Appeals reversed, holding $ 3607(b)(1)'s absolute exemption inapplicable.

Held: Edmonds' zoning code definition of the term "family" is not a maximum occupancy restriction exempt from the FHA under $ 3607(b)(1).
Pp. 731-738.

(a) Congress enacted $ 3607(b)(1) against the backdrop of an evident
distinction between municipal land-use restrictions and maximum occupancy restrictions. Land-use restrictions designate districts--e. g.,

514us3$57Z 06-02-98 20:45:08 PAGES OPINPGT
726 CITY OF EDMONDS v. OXFORD HOUSE, INC.

Syllabus
commercial or single-family residential--in which only compatible uses
are allowed and incompatible uses are excluded. Reserving land for
single-family residences preserves the character of neighborhoods as
family residential communities. To limit land use to single-family residences, a municipality must define the term "family"; thus family composition rules are an essential component of single-family use restrictions.
Maximum occupancy restrictions, in contradistinction, cap the number
of occupants per dwelling, typically on the basis of available floor space
or rooms. Their purpose is to protect health and safety by preventing
dwelling overcrowding. Section 3607(b)(1)'s language--"restrictions
regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a
dwelling"--surely encompasses maximum occupancy restrictions, and
does not fit family composition rules typically tied to land-use restrictions. Pp. 732-735.

(b) The zoning provisions Edmonds invoked against Oxford House,
ECDC $$ 16.20.010 and 21.30.010, are classic examples of a use restriction and complementing family composition rule. These provisions do
not cap the number of people who may live in a dwelling: So long as
they are related by "genetics, adoption, or marriage," any number of
people can live in a house. A separate ECDC provision--$ 19.10.000--
caps the number of occupants a dwelling may house, based on floor area,
and is thus a prototypical maximum occupancy restriction. In short,
the City's family definition rule, ECDC $ 21.30.010, describes family living, not living space per occupant. Defining family primarily by biological and legal relationships, the rule also accommodates another group
association: Five or fewer unrelated people are allowed to live together
as though they were family. But this accommodation cannot convert
Edmonds' family values preserver into a maximum occupancy restriction. Edmonds' contention that subjecting single-family zoning to FHA
scrutiny will overturn Euclidian zoning and destroy the effectiveness
and purpose of single-family zoning both ignores the limited scope of
the issue before this Court and exaggerates the force of the FHA's antidiscrimination provisions, which require only "reasonable" accommodations. Since only a threshold question is presented in this case, it remains for the lower courts to decide whether Edmonds' actions violate
the FHA's prohibitions against discrimination. Pp. 735-738.

728 CITY OF EDMONDS v. OXFORD HOUSE, INC.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Fair Housing Act (FHA or Act) prohibits discrimina-tion in housing against,

inter alios, persons with handicaps.1Section 807(b)(1) of the Act entirely exempts from the FHA's

compass "any reasonable local, State, or Federal restrictionsregarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to
occupy a dwelling." 42 U. S. C. $ 3607(b)(1). This case pre-sents the question whether a provision in petitioner City
of Edmonds' zoning code qualifies for $ 3607(b)(1)'s com-plete exemption from FHA scrutiny. The provision, governing areas zoned for single-family dwelling units, defines"family" as "persons [without regard to number] related by
genetics, adoption, or marriage, or a group of five or fewer[unrelated] persons." Edmonds Community Development
Code (ECDC) $ 21.30.010 (1991).The defining provision at issue describes who may compose a family unit; it does not prescribe "the maximum num-ber of occupants" a dwelling unit may house. We hold that

$ 3607(b)(1) does not exempt prescriptions of the family-defining kind, i. e., provisions designed to foster the family
character of a neighborhood. Instead, $ 3607(b)(1)'s absoluteexemption removes from the FHA's scope only total occupancy limits, i. e., numerical ceilings that serve to preventovercrowding in living quarters.

Community Development Act of 1974, $ 808(b), 88 Stat. 729. In 1988, Congress extended coverage to persons with handicaps and also prohibited
"familial status" discrimination, i. e., discrimination against parents or
other custodial persons domiciled with children under the age of 18. 42

Opinion of the Court
10 to 12 adults recovering from alcoholism and drug addiction. The group home, called Oxford House-Edmonds, is
located in a neighborhood zoned for single-family residences.
Upon learning that Oxford House had leased and was operating a home in Edmonds, the City issued criminal citations
to the owner and a resident of the house. The citations
charged violation of the zoning code rule that defines who
may live in single-family dwelling units. The occupants of
such units must compose a "family," and family, under the
City's defining rule, "means an individual or two or more
persons related by genetics, adoption, or marriage, or a
group of five or fewer persons who are not related by genetics, adoption, or marriage." ECDC $ 21.30.010. Oxford
House-Edmonds houses more than five unrelated persons,
and therefore does not conform to the code.

Oxford House asserted reliance on the Fair Housing Act,
102 Stat. 1619, 42 U. S. C. $ 3601 et seq., which declares it
unlawful "[t]o discriminate in the sale or rental, or to otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any buyer or
renter because of a handicap of . . . that buyer or renter."

$ 3604(f)(1)(A). The parties have stipulated, for purposes of
this litigation, that the residents of Oxford House-Edmonds
"are recovering alcoholics and drug addicts and are handicapped persons within the meaning" of the Act. App. 106.

Discrimination covered by the FHA includes "a refusal to
make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices,
or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to
afford [handicapped] person[s] equal opportunity to use and
enjoy a dwelling." $ 3604(f )(3)(B). Oxford House asked
Edmonds to make a "reasonable accommodation" by allowing
it to remain in the single-family dwelling it had leased.
Group homes for recovering substance abusers, Oxford
urged, need 8 to 12 residents to be financially and therapeutically viable. Edmonds declined to permit Oxford House to
stay in a single-family residential zone, but passed an ordi514us3$57P 06-02-98 20:45:08 PAGES OPINPGT

nance listing group homes as permitted uses in multifamily
and general commercial zones.

Edmonds sued Oxford House in the United States District
Court for the Western District of Washington, seeking a declaration that the FHA does not constrain the City's zoning

under the FHA, charging the City with failure to make a
"reasonable accommodation" permitting maintenance of the
group home in a single-family zone. The United States filed
a separate action on the same FHA "reasonable accommodation" ground, and the two cases were consolidated. Edmonds suspended its criminal enforcement actions pending
resolution of the federal litigation.

The sole question before the Court is whether Edmonds'family composition rule qualifies as a "restrictio[n] regarding

the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy adwelling" within the meaning of the FHA's absolute exemption. 42 U. S. C. $ 3607(b)(1).4 In answering this question,we are mindful of the Act's stated policy "to provide, within
constitutional limitations, for fair housing throughout theUnited States." $ 3601. We also note precedent recognizing the FHA's "broad and inclusive" compass, and thereforeaccording a "generous construction" to the Act's complaintfiling provision. Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.,409 U. S. 205, 209, 212 (1972). Accordingly, we regard this
case as an instance in which an exception to "a general state3 On May 17, 1993, the State of Washington enacted a law providing:
"No city may enact or maintain an ordinance, development regulation,
zoning regulation or official control, policy, or administrative practice
which treats a residential structure occupied by persons with handicaps
differently than a similar residential structure occupied by a family or
other unrelated individuals. As used in this section, `handicaps' are as
defined in the federal fair housing amendments act of 1988 (42 U. S. C.
Sec. 3602)." Wash. Rev. Code $ 35.63.220 (1994).

The United States asserts that Washington's new law invalidates ECDC

$ 21.30.010, Edmonds' family composition rule, as applied to Oxford
House-Edmonds. Edmonds responds that the effect of the new law is "far
from clear." Reply to Brief in Opposition 4. Even if the new law prevents Edmonds from enforcing its rule against Oxford House, a live controversy remains because the United States seeks damages and civil penalties from Edmonds, under 42 U. S. C. $$ 3614(d)(1)(B) and (C), for conduct
occurring prior to enactment of the state law. App. 85.

4 Like the District Court and the Ninth Circuit, we do not decide

whether Edmonds' zoning code provision defining "family," as the City
would apply it against Oxford House, violates the FHA's prohibitions
against discrimination set out in 42 U. S. C. $$ 3604(f)(1)(A) and (f)(3)(B).

Congress enacted $ 3607(b)(1) against the backdrop of anevident distinction between municipal land-use restrictions

and maximum occupancy restrictions.Land-use restrictions designate "districts in which only
compatible uses are allowed and incompatible uses areexcluded." D. Mandelker, Land Use Law $ 4.16, pp. 113-
114 (3d ed. 1993) (hereinafter Mandelker). These restric-tions typically categorize uses as single-family residential,
multiple-family residential, commercial, or industrial. See,
e. g., 1 E. Ziegler, Jr., Rathkopf 's The Law of Zoning andPlanning $ 8.01, pp. 8-2 to 8-3 (4th ed. 1995); Mandelker

$ 1.03, p. 4; 1 E. Yokley, Zoning Law and Practice $ 7-2, p. 252(4th ed. 1978).

Land-use restrictions aim to prevent problems caused bythe "pig in the parlor instead of the barnyard." Village of

in a statute proscribing discrimination. See post, at 743-744. Gregory
involved an exemption in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of

local elective officials and "appointee[s] on the policymaking level."

$ 630(f). The question there was whether state judges fit within the exemption. We held that they did. A state constitutional provision, not a
local ordinance, was at stake in Gregory--a provision going "beyond an
area traditionally regulated by the States" to implicate "a decision of the
most fundamental sort for a sovereign entity." 501 U. S., at 460. In that
light, the Court refused to attribute to Congress, absent plain statement,
any intent to govern the tenure of state judges. Nothing in today's opinion casts a cloud on the soundness of that decision.

also Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494, 521 (1977)(Burger, C. J., dissenting) (purpose of East Cleveland's
single-family zoning ordinance "is the traditional one of pre-serving certain areas as family residential communities").
To limit land use to single-family residences, a municipalitymust define the term "family"; thus family composition rules
are an essential component of single-family residential userestrictions.

Maximum occupancy restrictions, in contradistinction, capthe number of occupants per dwelling, typically in relation
to available floor space or the number and type of rooms.See, e. g., International Conference of Building Officials, Uniform Housing Code $ 503(b) (1988); Building Officials andCode Administrators International, Inc., BOCA National
Property Maintenance Code $$ PM-405.3, PM-405.5 (1993)(hereinafter BOCA Code); Southern Building Code Congress, International, Inc., Standard Housing Code $$ 306.1,306.2 (1991); E. Mood, APHA-CDC Recommended Minimum
Housing Standards $ 9.02, p. 37 (1986) (hereinafter APHA-CDC Standards).

6 These restrictions ordinarily apply uniformly to all residents of all dwelling units. Their purposeis to protect health and safety by preventing dwelling overcrowding. See, e. g., BOCA Code $$ PM-101.3, PM-405.3,PM-405.5 and commentary; Abbott, Housing Policy, Housing
Codes and Tenant Remedies: An Integration, 56 B. U. L. Rev.1, 41-45 (1976).

Moore v. EastCleveland, 431 U. S. 494 (1977). In Moore, the Court held

unconstitutional the constricted definition of "family" con6 Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, see post, at 745, n. 5, terminology
in the APHA-CDC Standards bears a marked resemblance to the formulation Congress used in $ 3607(b)(1). See APHA-CDC Standards $ 2.51,
p. 12 (defining "Permissible Occupancy" as "the maximum number of individuals permitted to reside in a dwelling unit, or rooming unit").

tained in East Cleveland's housing ordinance. East Cleve-land's ordinance "select[ed] certain categories of relatives

who may live together and declare[d] that others may not";in particular, East Cleveland's definition of "family" made "a
crime of a grandmother's choice to live with her grandson."
Id., at 498-499 (plurality opinion). In response to EastCleveland's argument that its aim was to prevent overcrowded dwellings, streets, and schools, we observed thatthe municipality's restrictive definition of family served the
asserted, and undeniably legitimate, goals "marginally, atbest."

Id., at 500 (footnote omitted). Another East Cleveland ordinance, we noted, "specifically addressed . . . theproblem of overcrowding"; that ordinance tied "the maximum permissible occupancy of a dwelling to the habitable
floor area." Id., at 500, n. 7; accord, id., at 520, n. 16 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). Justice Stewart, in dissent, also distinguished restrictions designed to "preserv[e]
the character of a residential area," from prescription of "a
minimum habitable floor area per person," id., at 539, n. 9, in
the interest of community health and safety.7

Section 3607(b)(1)'s language--"restrictions regarding the
maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling"--surely encompasses maximum occupancy restrictions.8

7 Other courts and commentators have similarly differentiated between
land-use restrictions and maximum occupancy restrictions. See, e. g.,
State v. Baker, 81 N. J. 99, 110, 405 A. 2d 368, 373 (1979); 7A E. McQuillin,
The Law of Municipal Corporations $ 24.504 (3d ed. 1989); Abbott, Housing
Policy, Housing Codes and Tenant Remedies: An Integration, 56 B. U.
L. Rev. 1, 41 (1976).

8 The plain import of the statutory language is reinforced by the House

Committee Report, which observes:
"A number of jurisdictions limit the number of occupants per unit based
on a minimum number of square feet in the unit or the sleeping areas of
the unit. Reasonable limitations by governments would be allowed to
continue, as long as they were applied to all occupants, and did not operate
to discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin,
handicap or familial status." H. R. Rep. No. 100-711, p. 31 (1988).

But the formulation does not fit family composition rules typically tied to land-use restrictions. In sum, rules that cap
the total number of occupants in order to prevent overcrowding of a dwelling "plainly and unmistakably," see A. H. Phillips, Inc. v. Walling, 324 U. S. 490, 493 (1945), fall within

$ 3607(b)(1)'s absolute exemption from the FHA's governance; rules designed to preserve the family character
of a neighborhood, fastening on the composition of households rather than on the total number of occupants living
quarters can contain, do not.9

B
Turning specifically to the City's Community Development
Code, we note that the provisions Edmonds invoked against
Oxford House, ECDC $$ 16.20.010 and 21.30.010, are classic
examples of a use restriction and complementing family composition rule. These provisions do not cap the number of
people who may live in a dwelling. In plain terms, they di9 Tellingly, Congress added the $ 3607(b)(1) exemption for maximum occupancy restrictions at the same time it enlarged the FHA to include a
ban on discrimination based on "familial status." See supra, at 728, n. 1.
The provision making it illegal to discriminate in housing against families
with children under the age of 18 prompted fears that landlords would be
forced to allow large families to crowd into small housing units. See, e. g.,
Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1987: Hearings on H. R. 1158 before the
Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the House Committee
on the Judiciary, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., 656 (1987) (remarks of Rep. Edwards) (questioning whether a landlord must allow a family with 10 children to live in a two-bedroom apartment). Section 3607(b)(1) makes it
plain that, pursuant to local prescriptions on maximum occupancy, landlords legitimately may refuse to stuff large families into small quarters.
Congress further assured in $ 3607(b)(1) that retirement communities
would be exempt from the proscription of discrimination against families
with minor children. In the sentence immediately following the maximum occupancy provision, $ 3607(b)(1) states: "Nor does any provision in
this subchapter regarding familial status apply with respect to housing for
older persons."

Opinion of the Court
rect that dwellings be used only to house families. Cap-tioned "USES," ECDC $ 16.20.010 provides that the sole

"Permitted Primary Us[e]" in a single-family residentialzone is "[s]ingle-family dwelling units." Edmonds itself recognizes that this provision simply "defines those uses per-mitted in a single family residential zone." Pet. for Cert. 3.

A separate provision caps the number of occupants adwelling may house, based on floor area:

"Floor Area. Every dwelling unit shall have at leastone room which shall have not less than 120 square feet
of floor area. Other habitable rooms, except kitchens,shall have an area of not less than 70 square feet.
Where more than two persons occupy a room used forsleeping purposes, the required floor area shall be increased at the rate of 50 square feet for each occupantin excess of two." ECDC $ 19.10.000 (adopting Uniform
Housing Code $ 503(b) (1988)).10
This space and occupancy standard is a prototypical maxi-mum occupancy restriction.

Edmonds nevertheless argues that its family compositionrule, ECDC $ 21.30.010, falls within $ 3607(b)(1), the FHA
exemption for maximum occupancy restrictions, because therule caps at five the number of unrelated persons allowed to
occupy a single-family dwelling. But Edmonds' family com-position rule surely does not answer the question: "What is
the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy ahouse?" So long as they are related "by genetics, adoption,
or marriage," any number of people can live in a house. Tensiblings, their parents and grandparents, for example, could
dwell in a house in Edmonds' single-family residential zonewithout offending Edmonds' family composition rule.

10 An exception to this provision sets out requirements for efficiency
units in apartment buildings. See ECDC $ 19.10.000 (1991) (adopting Uniform Housing Code $ 503(b) (1988)).

Opinion of the Court
Family living, not living space per occupant, is what
ECDC $ 21.30.010 describes. Defining family primarily by
biological and legal relationships, the provision also accommodates another group association: Five or fewer unrelated
people are allowed to live together as though they were family. This accommodation is the peg on which Edmonds rests
its plea for $ 3607(b)(1) exemption. Had the City defined a
family solely by biological and legal links, $ 3607(b)(1) would
not have been the ground on which Edmonds staked its case.
See Tr. of Oral Arg. 11-12, 16. It is curious reasoning indeed that converts a family values preserver into a maximum
occupancy restriction once a town adds to a related persons
prescription "and also two unrelated persons." 11

Edmonds additionally contends that subjecting singlefamily zoning to FHA scrutiny will "overturn Euclidian zoning" and "destroy the effectiveness and purpose of singlefamily zoning." Brief for Petitioner 11, 25. This contention
both ignores the limited scope of the issue before us and
exaggerates the force of the FHA's antidiscrimination provisions. We address only whether Edmonds' family composition rule qualifies for $ 3607(b)(1) exemption. Moreover, the
FHA antidiscrimination provisions, when applicable, require
only "reasonable" accommodations to afford persons with
handicaps "equal opportunity to use and enjoy" housing.

$$ 3604(f )(1)(A) and (f )(3)(B).

11 This curious reasoning drives the dissent. If Edmonds allowed only
related persons (whatever their number) to dwell in a house in a singlefamily zone, then the dissent, it appears, would agree that the $ 3607(b)(1)
exemption is unavailable. But so long as the City introduces a specific
number--any number (two will do)--the City can insulate its single-family
zone entirely from FHA coverage. The exception-takes-the-rule reading
the dissent advances is hardly the "generous construction" warranted for
antidiscrimination prescriptions. See Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life
Ins. Co., 409 U. S. 205, 212 (1972).

Thomas, J., dissenting

* * *
The parties have presented, and we have decided, only athreshold question: Edmonds' zoning code provision describing who may compose a "family" is not a maximum occupancyrestriction exempt from the FHA under $ 3607(b)(1). It
remains for the lower courts to decide whether Edmonds'actions against Oxford House violate the FHA's prohibitions against discrimination set out in $$ 3604(f)(1)(A) and(f)(3)(B). For the reasons stated, the judgment of the
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is

Affirmed.
Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy join, dissenting.

Congress has exempted from the requirements of the FairHousing Act (FHA) "

any reasonable local, State, or Federalrestrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants

permitted to occupy a dwelling." 42 U. S. C. $ 3607(b)(1)(emphasis added). In today's decision, the Court concludes
that the challenged provisions of petitioner's zoning code donot qualify for this exemption, even though they establish a
specific number--five--as the maximum number of unrelatedpersons permitted to occupy a dwelling in the single-family
neighborhoods of Edmonds, Washington. Because theCourt's conclusion fails to give effect to the plain language
of the statute, I respectfully dissent.

I
Petitioner's zoning code reserves certain neighborhoodsprimarily for "[s]ingle-family dwelling units." Edmonds

Community Development Code (ECDC) $ 16.20.010(A)(1)(1991), App. 225. To live together in such a dwelling, a
group must constitute a "family," which may be either a tra-ditional kind of family, comprising "two or more persons re514us3$57N 06-02-98 20:45:09 PAGES OPINPGT

lated by genetics, adoption, or marriage," or a nontraditionalone, comprising "a group of five or fewer persons who are not

[so] related." $ 21.30.010, App. 250. As respondent UnitedStates conceded at oral argument, the effect of these provisions is to establish a rule that "no house in [a single-family]area of the city shall have more than five occupants unless it
is a [traditional kind of] family." Tr. of Oral Arg. 46. Inother words, petitioner's zoning code establishes for certain
dwellings "a five-occupant limit, [with] an exception for [tra-ditional] families."

Ibid.To my mind, the rule that "no house . . . shall have more

than five occupants" (a "five-occupant limit") readily qualifiesas a "restrictio[n] regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling." In plain fashion, it"restrict[s]"--to five--"the maximum number of occupants
permitted to occupy a dwelling." To be sure, as the major-ity observes, the restriction imposed by petitioner's zoning
code is not an absolute one, because it does not apply to re-lated persons. See

ante, at 736. But $ 3607(b)(1) does notset forth a narrow exemption only for "absolute" or "unqualified" restrictions regarding the maximum number of occu-pants. Instead, it sweeps broadly to exempt

any restric-tions regarding such maximum number. It is difficult to

imagine what broader terms Congress could have used tosignify the categories or kinds of relevant governmental
restrictions that are exempt from the FHA.1

1 A broad construction of the word "any" is hardly novel. See, e. g.,
John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Harris Trust and Sav. Bank, 510
U. S. 86, 96 (1993) (citing, as examples where "Congress spoke without
qualification" in ERISA, an exemption for " `any security' issued to a plan
by a registered investment company" and an exemption for " `any assets
of . . . an insurance company or any assets of a plan which are held by
. . . an insurance company' " (quoting 29 U. S. C. $$ 1101(b)(1), 1103(b)(2))
(emphasis in John Hancock)); Citizens' Bank v. Parker, 192 U. S. 73, 81

exemption without limitation").

Thomas, J., dissenting
Consider a real estate agent who is assigned responsibility
for the city of Edmonds. Desiring to learn all he can about
his new territory, the agent inquires: "Does the city have
any restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling?" The accurate answer must surely be in the affirmative--yes, the maximum
number of unrelated persons permitted to occupy a dwelling
in a single-family neighborhood is five. Or consider a different example. Assume that the Federal Republic of Germany imposes no restrictions on the speed of "cars" that
drive on the Autobahn but does cap the speed of "trucks"
(which are defined as all other vehicles). If a conscientious
visitor to Germany asks whether there are "any restrictions
regarding the maximum speed of motor vehicles permitted
to drive on the Autobahn," the accurate answer again is
surely the affirmative one--yes, there is a restriction regarding the maximum speed of trucks on the Autobahn.

The majority does not ask whether petitioner's zoning
code imposes any restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling. Instead,
observing that pursuant to ECDC $ 21.30.010, "any number
of people can live in a house," so long as they are "related
`by genetics, adoption, or marriage,' " the majority concludes
that $ 21.30.010 does not qualify for $ 3607(b)(1)'s exemption
because it "surely does not answer the question: `What is
the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a
house?' " Ante, at 736. The majority's question, however,
does not accord with the text of the statute. To take advantage of the exemption, a local, state, or federal law need not
impose a restriction establishing an absolute maximum number of occupants; under $ 3607(b)(1), it is necessary only that
such law impose a restriction "regarding" the maximum
number of occupants. Surely, a restriction can "regar[d]"--
or "concern," "relate to," or "bear on"--the maximum num514us3$57N 06-02-98 20:45:09 PAGES OPINPGT

ber of occupants without establishing an absolute maximumnumber in all cases.

2

I would apply $ 3607(b)(1) as it is written. Because peti-tioner's zoning code imposes a qualified "restrictio[n] regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupya dwelling," and because the statute exempts from the FHA
"any" such restrictions, I would reverse the Ninth Circuit'sholding that the exemption does not apply in this case.

3

II
The majority's failure to ask the right question about peti-tioner's zoning code results from a more fundamental error

in focusing on "maximum occupancy restrictions" and "familycomposition rules." See generally

ante, at 731-734. Thesetwo terms--and the two categories of zoning rules they describe--are simply irrelevant to this case.

2 It is ironic that the majority cites Uniform Housing Code $ 503(b)
(1988), which has been incorporated into petitioner's zoning code, see
ECDC $ 19.10.000, App. 248, as a "prototypical maximum occupancy restriction" that would qualify for $ 3607(b)(1)'s exemption. Ante, at 736.
Because $ 503(b), as the majority describes it, "caps the number of occupants a dwelling may house, based on floor area," ibid. (emphasis added),
it actually caps the density of occupants, not their number. By itself,
therefore, $ 503(b) "surely does not answer the question: `What is the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a house?' " Ibid. That
is, even under $ 503(b), there is no single absolute maximum number of
occupants that applies to every house in Edmonds. Thus, the answer to
the majority's question is the same with respect to both $ 503(b) and
ECDC $ 21.30.010: "It depends." With respect to the former, it depends
on the size of the house's bedrooms, see ante, at 736 (quoting $ 503(b));
with respect to the latter, it depends on whether the house's occupants
are related.

3 I would also remand the case to the Court of Appeals to allow it to pass

on respondents' argument that petitioner's zoning code does not satisfy

$ 3607(b)(1)'s requirement that qualifying restrictions be "reasonable."
The District Court rejected this argument, concluding that petitioner's
"five-unrelated-person limit is reasonable as a matter of law," App. to Pet.
for Cert. B-10, but the Court of Appeals did not address the issue.

As an initial matter, I do not agree with the majority'sinterpretive premise that "this case [is] an instance in which

an exception to `a general statement of policy' is sensiblyread `narrowly in order to preserve the primary operation of
the [policy].' " Ante, at 731-732 (quoting Commissioner v.
Clark, 489 U. S. 726, 739 (1989)). Why this case? Surely, itis not because the FHA has a "policy"; every statute has

that. Nor could the reason be that a narrow reading of 42U. S. C. $ 3607(b)(1) is necessary to preserve the primary operation of the FHA's stated policy "to provide . . . for fairhousing throughout the United States." $ 3601. Congress,
the body responsible for deciding how specifically to achievethe objective of fair housing, obviously believed that

$ 3607(b)(1)'s exemption for "any . . . restrictions regardingthe maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a
dwelling" is consistent with the FHA's general statement ofpolicy. We do Congress no service--indeed, we negate the
"primary operation" of $ 3607(b)(1)--by giving that congres-sional enactment an artificially narrow reading. See Rodriguez v. United States, 480 U. S. 522, 526 (1987) (per curiam)("[I]t frustrates rather than effectuates legislative intent

ADEA generally protects the employees of States and their
political subdivisions, see $ 630(b)(2), it exempts from protection state and local elected officials and "appointee[s] on
the policymaking level," $ 630(f). In concluding that state
judges fell within this exemption, we did not construe it
"narrowly" in order to preserve the "primary operation" of
the ADEA. Instead, we specifically said that we were "not
looking for a plain statement that judges are excluded" from
the Act's coverage. Gregory, supra, at 467. Moreover, we
said this despite precedent recognizing that the ADEA
" `broadly prohibits' " age discrimination in the workplace.

any reference to the language of the Act, we stated that we could "give
vitality to $ 810(a) only by a generous construction which gives standing
to sue to all in the same housing unit who are injured by racial discrimination in the management of those facilities within the coverage of the statute." 409 U. S., at 212. If we were to apply such logic to this case, we
would presumably "give vitality" to $ 3607(b)(1) by giving it a generous
rather than a narrow construction.

Id., at 461 (quoting Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police,491 U. S. 58, 65 (1989)). It is obvious that land use--the

subject of petitioner's zoning code--is an area traditionallyregulated by the States rather than by Congress, and that
land-use regulation is one of the historic powers of theStates. As we have stated, "zoning laws and their provisions . . . are peculiarly within the province of state and locallegislative authorities."

I turn now to the substance of the majority's analysis, thefocus of which is "maximum occupancy restrictions" and
"family composition rules." The first of these two terms hasthe sole function of serving as a label for a category of zoning
rules simply invented by the majority: rules that "cap thenumber of occupants per dwelling, typically in relation to
available floor space or the number and type of rooms," that"ordinarily apply uniformly to all residents of all dwelling
units," and that have the "purpose . . . to protect health andsafety by preventing dwelling overcrowding." Ante, at

733.5 The majority's term does bear a familial resemblanceto the statutory term "restrictions regarding the maximum

number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling," but itshould be readily apparent that the category of zoning rules
the majority labels "maximum occupancy restrictions" doesnot exhaust the category of restrictions exempted from the
FHA by $ 3607(b)(1). The plain words of the statute do notrefer to "available floor space or the number and type of
rooms"; they embrace no requirement that the exempted re-strictions "apply uniformly to

all residents of all dwellingunits"; and they give no indication that such restrictions

5 To my knowledge, no federal or state judicial opinion--other than three

$ 3607(b)(1) decisions dating from 1992 and 1993--employs the term "maximum occupancy restrictions." Likewise, not one of the model codes from
which the majority constructs its category of zoning rules uses that term
either. See ante, at 733 (citing authorities). Accordingly, it is difficult to
conceive how Congress, in 1988, could have "enacted $ 3607(b)(1) against
the backdrop of an evident distinction between municipal land-use restrictions and maximum occupancy restrictions." Ante, at 732.

In this context, the majority seizes on a phrase that appears in a booklet
published jointly by the American Public Health Association and the Centers for Disease Control--" `the maximum number of individuals permitted to reside in a dwelling unit, or rooming unit.' " Ante, at 733, n. 6
(quoting APHA-CDC Recommended Minimum Housing Standards $ 2.51,
p. 12 (1986)). Even if, as the majority boldly asserts, this phrase "bears
a marked resemblance to the formulation Congress used in $ 3607(b)(1),"
ante, at 733, n. 6, I fail to comprehend how that would add to our understanding of the statute. The majority surely cannot hope to invoke the
rule that where " `Congress borrows terms of art in which are accumulated
the legal tradition and meaning of centuries of practice, it presumably
knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed
word in the body of learning from which it was taken and the meaning its
use will convey to the judicial mind unless otherwise instructed.' " Molzof v. United States, 502 U. S. 301, 307 (1992) (quoting Morissette v. United
States, 342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952)). The quoted phrase from the APHA-
CDC publication can hardly be called a "ter[m] of art"--let alone a term
in which is "accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of centuries of
practice." See also NLRB v. Amax Coal Co., 453 U. S. 322, 329 (1981)
(applying the rule to "terms that have accumulated settled meaning under
either equity or the common law").

must have the "purpose . . . to protect health and safety bypreventing dwelling overcrowding." Ibid.

Of course, the majority does not contend that the languageof $ 3607(b)(1) precisely describes the category of zoning
rules it has labeled "maximum occupancy restrictions."
Rather, the majority makes the far more narrow claim thatthe statutory language "surely encompasses" that category.

Ante, at 734. I readily concede this point.6 But the obvi-ous conclusion that $ 3607(b)(1) encompasses "maximum occupancy restrictions" tells us nothing about whether thestatute

also encompasses ECDC $ 21.30.010, the zoning rule
at issue here. In other words, although the majority'sdiscussion will no doubt provide guidance in future cases,

it is completely irrelevant to the question presented in thiscase.

The majority fares no better in its treatment of "family
composition rules," a term employed by the majority to de-scribe yet another invented category of zoning restrictions.

Although today's decision seems to hinge on the majority'sjudgment that ECDC $ 21.30.010 is a "classic exampl[e] of a
. . . family composition rule," ante, at 735, the majority saysvirtually nothing about this crucial category. Thus, it
briefly alludes to the derivation of "family composition rules"and provides a single example of them.

7 Apart from these

two references, however, the majority's analysis consists

6 According to the majority, its conclusion that $ 3607(b)(1) encompasses
all "maximum occupancy restrictions" is "reinforced by" H. R. Rep. No.
100-711, p. 31 (1988). See ante, at 734, n. 8. Since I agree with this
narrow conclusion, I need not consider whether the cited Committee Report is either authoritative or persuasive.

7 See ante, at 733 ("To limit land use to single-family residences, a municipality must define the term `family'; thus family composition rules are an
essential component of single-family residential use restrictions"); ante, at
734 ("East Cleveland's ordinance `select[ed] certain categories of relatives
who may live together and declare[d] that others may not'; in particular,
East Cleveland's definition of `family' made `a crime of a grandmother's

solely of announcing its conclusion that "the formulation [of$ 3607(b)(1)] does not fit family composition rules." Ibid.

This is not reasoning; it is ipse dixit. Indeed, it is not untilafter this conclusion has been announced that the majority
(in the course of summing up) even defines "family composi-tion rules" at all. See

ibid. (referring to "rules designed topreserve the family character of a neighborhood, fastening

on the composition of households rather than on the totalnumber of occupants living quarters can contain").

Although the majority does not say so explicitly, one mightinfer from its belated definition of "family composition rules"
that $ 3607(b)(1) does not encompass zoning rules that haveone particular purpose ("to preserve the family character of
a neighborhood") or those that refer to the qualitative as wellas the quantitative character of a dwelling (by "fastening on
the composition of households rather than on the total num-ber of occupants living quarters can contain").

Ibid. Yetterms like "family character," "composition of households,"

"total [that is, absolute] number of occupants," and "livingquarters" are noticeably absent from the text of the statute.
Section 3607(b)(1) limits neither the permissible purposes ofa qualifying zoning restriction nor the ways in which such a
restriction may accomplish its purposes. Rather, the ex-emption encompasses "any" zoning restriction--whatever its
purpose and by whatever means it accomplishes that pur-pose--so long as the restriction "regard[s]" the maximum
number of occupants. See generally supra, at 739-742.As I have explained, petitioner's zoning code does precisely
that.8

8 All that remains of the majority's case is the epithet that my reasoning
is "curious" because it yields an "exception-takes-the-rule reading" of

$ 3607(b)(1). Ante, at 737, n. 11. It is not clear why the majority thinks
my reading will eviscerate the FHA's antidiscrimination prescriptions.
The FHA protects handicapped persons from traditionally defined (intentional) discrimination, 42 U. S. C. $$ 3604(f)(1), (2), and three kinds of specially defined discrimination: "refusal to permit . . . reasonable modifications of existing premises"; "refusal to make reasonable accommodations
in rules, policies, practices, or services"; and "failure to design and con514us3$57N 06-02-98 20:45:09 PAGES OPINPGT

In sum, it does not matter that ECDC $ 21.30.010 de-scribes "[f]amily living, not living space per occupant," ante,

at 737, because it is immaterial under $ 3607(b)(1) whether$ 21.30.010 constitutes a "family composition rule" but not a
"maximum occupancy restriction." The sole relevant ques-tion is whether petitioner's zoning code imposes "any . . .

$$ 3604(f)(3)(A), (B), (C). Yet only one of these four kinds of discrimination--the "reasonable accommodations" prescription of $ 3604(f)(3)(B)--is
even arguably implicated by zoning rules like ECDC $ 21.30.010. In addition, because the exemption refers to "local, State, or Federal restrictions," even the broadest reading of $ 3607(b)(1) could not possibly insulate
private refusals to make reasonable accommodations for handicapped persons. Finally, as I have already noted, see supra, at 741, n. 3, restrictions
must be "reasonable" in order to be exempted by $ 3607(b)(1).

Syllabus

REYNOLDSVILLE CASKET CO. et al. v. HYDE

certiorari to the supreme court of ohio
No. 94-3. Argued February 27, 1995--Decided May 15, 1995
More than three years after respondent Hyde was in an accident in Ohio

with a truck owned by a Pennsylvania company, she filed suit in an Ohio
county court against the company and the truck's driver, petitioners
herein. The suit was timely under an Ohio provision that tolls the running of the State's 2-year statute of limitations in lawsuits against outof-state defendants. However, while her case was pending, this Court,
in Bendix Autolite Corp. v. Midwesco Enterprises, Inc., 486 U. S. 888,
held that the tolling provision places an unconstitutional burden upon
interstate commerce. The county court dismissed her suit as untimely,
but it was ultimately reinstated by the State Supreme Court, which
held that Bendix could not be applied retroactively to bar claims that
had accrued prior to the announcement of that decision.

Held: The Supremacy Clause bars Ohio from applying its tolling statute

to pre-Bendix torts. Pp. 752-759.

(a) Hyde acknowledges that this Court, in Harper v. Virginia Dept.
of Taxation, 509 U. S. 86, 97, held that, when it decides a case and applies the new legal rule of that case to the parties before it, then it and
other courts must treat the same rule as "retroactive," applying it, for
example, to pending cases, whether or not they involve predecision
events. She thereby concedes that Bendix applies to her case and retroactively invalidated the tolling provision that makes her suit timely.
She argues instead that the issue here is not one of retroactivity, and
that the Ohio Supreme Court's action is permissible because all that
court has done is to fashion a remedy that takes into consideration her
reliance on pre-Bendix law. Pp. 752-753.

(b) There are serious problems with Hyde's argument. The Ohio Supreme Court's syllabus (the legally authoritative statement of its holding) speaks, not about remedy, but about retroactivity. That court's
refusal to dismiss her suit on the ground that she may have reasonably
relied upon pre-Bendix law is the very sort of justification that this
Court, in Harper, found insufficient to deny retroactive application of a
new legal rule. She correctly notes that, as courts apply "retroactively" a new rule of law to pending cases, they may find instances
where the new rule, for well-established legal reasons, does not determine the outcome of the case. However, this case involves no instance
or special circumstance that might somehow justify the result she seeks.

Opinion of the Court
It does not concern (1) an alternative way of curing the constitutional
violation; or (2) a previously existing, independent legal basis for denying relief, see, e. g., McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages
and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 40-41; or
(3) a well-established general legal rule, such as qualified immunity, that
trumps the new rule of law, which general rule reflects both reliance
interests and other significant policy justifications, see, e. g., Harlow v.
Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818; or (4) a principle of law that limits the
principle of retroactivity itself, see Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288. Hyde
has offered no more than simple reliance as a basis for creating an exception to Harper's retroactivity rule and has conceded that Harper
governs this case. Her concession means that she cannot prevail.

In Bendix Autolite Corp. v. Midwesco Enterprises, Inc.,486 U.

Opinion of the Court
Ohio held that, despite Bendix, Ohio's tolling law continuesto apply to tort claims that accrued before that decision.

This holding, in our view, violates the Constitution's Suprem-acy Clause. We therefore reverse the Ohio Supreme
Court's judgment.

The accident that led to this case, a collision between a carand a truck, occurred in Ashtabula County, Ohio, on March

5, 1984. More than three years later, on August 11, 1987,Carol Hyde (respondent here) sued the truck's driver, John
Blosh, and its owner, Reynoldsville Casket Company (peti-tioners). All parties concede that, had Blosh and Reynoldsville made their home in Ohio, Ohio law would have given
Hyde only two years to bring her lawsuit. See Ohio Rev.
Code Ann. $ 2305.10 (1991). But, because petitioners were
from Pennsylvania, a special provision of Ohio law tolled the
running of the statute of limitations, making the lawsuit
timely. See $ 2305.15(A) (tolling the statute of limitations
while a person against whom "a cause of action accrues" is
"out of " or "departs from" the State).

Ten months after Hyde brought her suit, this Court, in
Bendix, supra, held that the tolling provision on which
she relied, $ 2305.15(A), places an unconstitutional burden
upon interstate commerce. Soon thereafter, the Ashtabula
County Court of Common Pleas, finding this case indistinguishable from Bendix, held that the tolling provision could
not constitutionally be applied to the case, and dismissed the
lawsuit as untimely. The intermediate appellate state court
affirmed the dismissal. However, the Ohio Supreme Court
reinstated the suit. Its syllabus, which under Ohio law sets
forth the authoritative basis for its decision, see Ohio Supreme Court Rules for the Reporting of Opinions Rule 1(B)
(1994-1995); Akers v. Serv-A-Portion, Inc., 31 Ohio St. 3d 78,

sion. (Section 16, Article I, Ohio Constitution, applied.)"68 Ohio St. 3d 240, 240-241, 626 N. E. 2d 75 (1994). We

granted certiorari to decide whether the Federal Constitu-tion permits Ohio to continue to apply its tolling statute to
pre-Bendix torts. And, as we have said, we conclude that
it does not.Hyde acknowledges that this Court, in

Harper v. Virginia
Dept. of Taxation, 509 U. S. 86, 97 (1993), held that, when (1)the Court decides a case and applies the (new) legal rule of

that case to the parties before it, then (2) it and other courtsmust treat that same (new) legal rule as "retroactive," applying it, for example, to all pending cases, whether or not those
cases involve predecision events. She thereby concedes
that, the Ohio Supreme Court's syllabus to the contrary notwithstanding, Bendix applies to her case. And, she says, as
"a result of Harper, there is no question that Bendix retroactively invalidated" the tolling provision that makes her suit
timely. Brief for Respondent 8.

Although one might think that is the end of the matter,
Hyde ingeniously argues that it is not. She asks us to look
at what the Ohio Supreme Court has done, not through the
lens of "retroactivity," but through that of "remedy."
States, she says, have a degree of legal leeway in fashioning
remedies for constitutional ills. She points to Chevron Oil
Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97 (1971), in which this Court applied
prospectively only its ruling that a 1-year statute of limitations governed certain tort cases--primarily because that
ruling had "effectively overruled a long line of decisions"
applying a more generous limitations principle (that of
laches), upon which plaintiffs had reasonably relied. Id., at
107. She concedes that Harper overruled Chevron Oil insofar as the case (selectively) permitted the prospective-only
application of a new rule of law. But, she notes the possibility of recharacterizing Chevron Oil as a case in which the
Court simply took reliance interests into account in tailoring
an appropriate remedy for a violation of federal law. See

Opinion of the Court
Harper, supra, at 133-134 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167, 218-225
(1990) (Stevens, J., dissenting). And she quotes JusticeHarlan, who, before

Chevron Oil, pointed out that "equitable
considerations" such as " `reliance' " might prove relevant to
"relief." United States v. Estate of Donnelly, 397 U. S. 286,296-297 (1970) (concurring opinion).

Thus, Hyde asks, why not look at what the Ohio SupremeCourt has done in this case as if it were simply an effort to
fashion a remedy that takes into consideration her relianceon preBendix law? Here, the remedy would actually consist of providing no remedy for the constitutional violation
or, to put the matter more precisely, of continuing to toll the
2-year statute of limitations in pre-Bendix cases, such as
hers, as a state law "equitable" device for reasons of reliance
and fairness. She claims that use of this device violates no
federal constitutional provision (such as the Due Process
Clause) and is therefore permissible.

One serious problem with Hyde's argument lies in the
Ohio Supreme Court's legal description of why, in fact, it
refused to dismiss Hyde's case. As we have pointed out,
the Ohio Supreme Court's syllabus (the legally authoritative
statement of its holding) speaks, not about remedy, but about
retroactivity. Regardless, we do not see how, in the circumstances before us, the Ohio Supreme Court could change a
legal outcome that federal law, applicable under the Supremacy Clause, would otherwise dictate simply by calling its refusal to apply that federal law an effort to create a remedy.
The Ohio Supreme Court's justification for refusing to dismiss Hyde's suit is that she, and others like her, may have
reasonably relied upon pre-Bendix law--a reliance of the
same kind and degree as that involved in Chevron Oil.
But, this type of justification--often present when prior law
is overruled--is the very sort that this Court, in Harper,
found insufficient to deny retroactive application of a new
legal rule (that had been applied in the case that first an514us3$58Q 05-27-98 18:11:53 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
nounced it). If Harper has anything more than symbolicsignificance, how could virtually identical reliance, without

more, prove sufficient to permit a virtually identical denialsimply because it is characterized as a denial based on "remedy" rather than "nonretroactivity"?

Hyde tries to answer this question by pointing to othercases in which, she claims, this Court has allowed state

courts effectively to avoid retroactive application of federallaw by denying a particular remedy for violation of that law
or by refusing to provide any remedy at all. She arguesthat these cases are similar enough to her own to permit a
"remedial" exception to the retroactive application of Bendix. We have examined the cases to which Hyde looks for
support, and conclude that they all involve very different
circumstances.

First, Hyde points to a statement in the opinion announcing the Court's judgment in James B. Beam Distilling Co. v.
Georgia, 501 U. S. 529 (1991), that once "a rule is found to
apply `backward,' there may then be a further issue of remedies, i. e., whether the party prevailing under a new rule
should obtain the same relief that would have been awarded
if the rule had been an old one." Id., at 535 (opinion of Souter, J.); ibid. ("Subject to possible constitutional thresholds,
. . . the remedial inquiry is one governed by state law, at
least where the case originates in state court"); American
Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S., at 178 (opinion of
O'Connor, J.) (speaking of the need to "distinguish the question of retroactivity . . . from the distinct remedial question");
id., at 210 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (distinguishing "between
retroactivity as a choice-of-law rule and retroactivity as a
remedial principle"). This language, however, read both literally and in context, makes clear that the ordinary application of a new rule of law "backwards," say, to pending cases,
may or may not, involve a further matter of remedies.
Whether it does so, and, if so, what kind of remedy the state
court may fashion, depend--like almost all legal issues--

755Cite as: 514 U. S. 749 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
upon the kind of case, matter, and circumstances involved.Not all cases concerning retroactivity and remedies are of

the same sort.Second, Hyde points to tax cases in which the Court applied retroactively new rules holding certain state tax laws
unconstitutional, but nonetheless permitted the state courtsa degree of leeway in designing a remedy, including a remedy

that would deny state taxpayers, with pending refund cases,the refund that they sought. See

Harper v. Virginia Dept.
of Taxation, 509 U. S. 86 (1993); Beam, supra. If statecourts may at the same time apply new law (invalidating tax

statutes) and withhold relief (tax refunds) from tax plaintiffs,
asks Hyde, why can they not at the same time apply new
law (invalidating tolling statutes) and withhold relief (dismissal) from tort defendants?

The answer to this question lies in the special circumstances of the tax cases. The Court has suggested that
some of them involve a particular kind of constitutional violation--a kind that the State could cure without repaying back
taxes. See McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496
U. S. 18, 40-41 (1990). Where the violation depends, in critical part, upon differential treatment of two similar classes of
individuals, then one might cure the problem either by similarly burdening, or by similarly unburdening, both groups.
Where the violation stemmed from, say, taxing the retirement funds of one group (retired Federal Government employees) but not those of another (retired state government
employees), see Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489
U. S. 803 (1989), then the State might cure the problem either
(1) by taxing both (imposing, say, back taxes on the previously advantaged group, to the extent constitutionally permissible), or (2) by taxing neither (and refunding back taxes).
Cf. McKesson Corp., supra, at 40-41, and n. 23. And, if the
State chooses the first, then the taxpayers need receive no
refund. But, that result flows not from some general "reme514us3$58Q 05-27-98 18:11:53 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
dial" exception to "retroactivity" law, but simply from the
fact that the state law that the taxpayer had attacked now
satisfies the Constitution.

One can imagine a roughly comparable situation in the
statute of limitations context. Suppose that Ohio violated
the Constitution by treating two similar classes of tort defendants differently, say, by applying a 2-year statute of limitations to the first (in-state defendants) but a 4-year statute
to the second (out-of-state defendants). Ohio might have
cured this (imaginary) constitutional problem either (1) by
applying a 4-year statute to both groups, or (2) by applying
a 2-year statute to both groups. Had it chosen the first of
these remedies, then Hyde's case could continue because the
4-year statute would no longer violate the Federal Constitution. This imaginary case, however, is not the case at hand,
for the Ohio Supreme Court's "remedy" here (allowing Hyde
to proceed) does not cure the tolling statute's problem of
unconstitutionality. And, her tort claim critically depends
upon Ohio tolling law that continues to violate the Commerce Clause.

Other tax examples present different, remedial problems.
Suppose a State collects taxes under a taxing statute that
this Court later holds unconstitutional. Taxpayers then sue
for a refund of the unconstitutionally collected taxes. Retroactive application of the Court's holding would seem to entitle the taxpayers to a refund of taxes. But what if a preexisting, separate, independent rule of state law, having
nothing to do with retroactivity--a rule containing certain
procedural requirements for any refund suit--nonetheless
barred the taxpayers' refund suit? See McKesson Corp.,
supra, at 45; Reich v. Collins, 513 U. S. 106, 111 (1994). Depending upon whether or not this independent rule satisfied
other provisions of the Constitution, it could independently
bar the taxpayers' refund claim. See McKesson Corp.,
supra, at 45.

Opinion of the Court
This tax scenario simply reflects the legal commonplace
that, when two different rules of law each independently bar
recovery, then a decision, the retroactive application of which
invalidates one rule, will make no difference to the result.
The other, constitutionally adequate rule remains in place.
Hyde cannot bring her case within the protection of this
principle, for the Ohio Supreme Court did not rest its holding
upon a pre-existing, separate rule of state law (having nothing to do with retroactivity) that independently permitted
her to proceed. Rather, the maintenance of her action critically depends upon the continued application of the Ohio
statute's "tolling" principle--a principle that this Court has
held unconstitutional.

Third, Hyde points to the law of qualified immunity, which,
she says, imposes a "remedial" limitation upon the "retroactive" application of a new rule to pending cases. To understand her argument, consider the following scenario: (1)
Smith sues a police officer claiming injury because of an unconstitutional arrest; (2) the police officer asserts that the
arrest was constitutional; (3) this Court then holds, in a different case, that an identical arrest is not constitutional; (4)
the holding of this different case applies retroactively to
Smith's case; but (5) the police officer still wins on grounds
of qualified immunity because the new rule of law was not
"clearly established" at the time of the arrest. See generally Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982). In one
sense, Smith lost for a reason similar to the tax plaintiffs
mentioned above, namely, that a previously existing, separate, constitutional legal ground (that of the law not being
"clearly established") bars her claim. We acknowledge,
however, that this separate legal ground does reflect certain
remedial considerations. In particular, it permits government officials to rely upon old law. But, it does so lest threat
of liability " `dampen the ardor of all but the most resolute,
or the most irresponsible [public officials], in the unflinching

Opinion of the Court
discharge of their duties.' " Id., at 814 (quoting Gregoire v.
Biddle, 177 F. 2d 579, 581 (CA2 1949)). And, it reflects the
concern that "society as a whole," without that immunity,would have to bear "the expenses of litigation, the diversion of official energy from pressing public issues, and the
deterrence of able citizens from acceptance of public office."457 U. S., at 814. These very facts--that a set of special

federal policy considerations have led to the creation of awell-established, independent rule of law--distinguish the
qualified immunity cases from the case before us, where aconcern about reliance alone has led the Ohio court to create
what amounts to an ad hoc exemption from retroactivity.

Finally, Hyde points to the line of cases starting with
Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), in which, she says, this
Court has held that a habeas corpus petitioner cannot obtain
a habeas corpus remedy where doing so would require the
habeas court to apply retroactively a new rule of criminal
law. The Teague doctrine, however, does not involve a special "remedial" limitation on the principle of "retroactivity"
as much as it reflects a limitation inherent in the principle
itself. New legal principles, even when applied retroactively, do not apply to cases already closed. Cf. United
States v. Estate of Donnelly, 397 U. S., at 296 (Harlan, J.,
concurring) (at some point, "the rights of the parties should
be considered frozen" and a "conviction . . . final"). And,
much as the qualified immunity doctrine embodies special
federal policy concerns related to the imposition of damages
liability upon persons holding public office, the Teague doctrine embodies certain special concerns--related to collateral
review of state criminal convictions--that affect which cases
are closed, for which retroactivity-related purposes, and
under what circumstances. No such special finality-related
concerns are present here.

The upshot is that Hyde shows, through her examples, the
unsurprising fact that, as courts apply "retroactively" a new
rule of law to pending cases, they will find instances where

that new rule, for well-established legal reasons, does notdetermine the outcome of the case. Thus, a court may find

(1) an alternative way of curing the constitutional violation,or (2) a previously existing, independent legal basis (having
nothing to do with retroactivity) for denying relief, or (3) asin the law of qualified immunity, a well-established general
legal rule that trumps the new rule of law, which generalrule reflects

both reliance interests and other significant pol-icy justifications, or (4) a principle of law, such as that of

"finality" present in the Teague context, that limits the prin-ciple of retroactivity itself. But, this case involves no such
instance; nor does it involve any other special circumstancethat might somehow justify the result Hyde seeks. Rather,
Hyde offers no more than simple reliance (of the sort at issuein

Chevron Oil) as a basis for creating an exception toHarper's rule of retroactivity--in other words, she claims

that, for no special reason, Harper does not apply. We areback where we started. Hyde's necessary concession, that
Harper governs this case, means that she cannot prevail.The judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio is

Reversed.
Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,concurring.

I join the opinion of the Court, which assumes that theOhio Supreme Court denied petitioner a "remedy" for the
unconstitutionality of the tolling statute, and refutes the no-tion that "remedial discretion" would allow that unconstitutionality to be given no effect. That was the theory onwhich this case was presented and argued, and it is properly
decided on the same basis.I write separately, however, to record my doubt that the
case in fact presents any issue of remedies or of remedialdiscretion at all. A court does not--in the nature of things
it can not--give a "remedy" for an unconstitutional statute,since an unconstitutional statute is not in itself a cognizable

Scalia, J., concurring
"wrong." (If it were, every citizen would have standing tochallenge every law.) In fact, what a court does with regard

to an unconstitutional law is simply to ignore it. It decidesthe case "

disregarding the [unconstitutional] law," Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 178 (1803) (emphasis added),
because a law repugnant to the Constitution "is void, and isas no law,"

Ex parte Siebold, 100 U. S. 371, 376 (1880).
Thus, if a plaintiff seeks the return of money taken by thegovernment in reliance on an unconstitutional tax law, the

court ignores the tax law, finds the taking of the propertytherefore wrongful, and provides a remedy. Or if a plaintiff
seeks to enjoin acts, harmful to him, about to be taken by
a government officer under an unconstitutional regulatory
statute, "the court enjoins, in effect, not the execution of the
statute, but the acts of the official, the statute notwithstanding." Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 488-489
(1923) (emphasis added). In such cases, it makes sense to
speak of "remedial discretion."

In the present case, however, ignoring the unconstitutional
statute (which the Ohio courts were bound to do) did not
result in the conclusion that some remedy must be provided
(over which the courts might have some discretion).
Rather, it resulted in the conclusion that the remedy which
the plaintiff sought could not be provided. Respondent's
suit was concededly untimely under the applicable state statute of limitations, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. $ 2305.10 (1991). See
ante, at 751. When petitioners moved to dismiss the suit,
respondent replied that the suit was timely by virtue of the
tolling provision, $ 2305.15(A). The tolling provision, however, was unconstitutional, see Bendix Autolite Corp. v.
Midwesco Enterprises, Inc., 486 U. S. 888 (1988), and since
it was unconstitutional it "was . . . as inoperative as if it had
never been passed," Chicago, I. & L. R. Co. v. Hackett, 228
U. S. 559, 566 (1913).

In contemplation of the law, then, all that the trial court
had before it was a concededly untimely suit, and (absent

some valid Ohio law other than the tolling statute) it had noalternative but to dismiss. The Court's opinion gives reasons why the Ohio law applied by the Ohio Supreme Courtin this case is in its substance invalid. I add that even the
rubric under which that law was announced is invalid: It has
nothing to do with remedial discretion.

Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice O'Connor joins,concurring in the judgment.

We do not read today's opinion to surrender in advanceour authority to decide that in some exceptional cases, courts
may shape relief in light of disruption of important relianceinterests or the unfairness caused by unexpected judicial decisions. We cannot foresee the myriad circumstances inwhich the question might arise. In two classes of cases,
courts already take account of these considerations: cases involving qualified immunity, which protects public officials'
reliance on clearly established law, see Harlow v. Fitzgerald,
457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982); and cases applying the Teague bar
which, among other objectives, protects States that rely on
the law existing at the time a conviction becomes final, see
Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 310 (1989). Cf. ante, at 758.
As the Court seems to acknowledge, however, there may be
other areas where the importance of the reliance interests
that are disturbed precludes a remedy despite the retroactive application of the new rule. Ante, at 758-759. In my
view, reliance on statutes of limitations falls into that category in certain circumstances, see Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind,
Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350, 371-374
(1991) (O'Connor, J., dissenting); id., at 379 (Kennedy, J.,
dissenting); American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496
U. S. 167, 221-222 (1990) (Stevens, J., dissenting); Saint
Francis College v. Al-Khazraji, 481 U. S. 604 (1987); Chevron
Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97 (1971), consistent with a long
tradition of judicial authority to formulate rules ensuring fair
and predictable enforcement of statutes of limitations, for

instance, through rules pertaining to tolling or waiver. See
American Trucking Assns., Inc., supra, at 221 (Stevens, J.,
dissenting) (citing Braun v. Sauerwein, 10 Wall. 218, 223(1870)). When a hard case presents the question of our authority to deny relief in a retroactivity case, that will be soon
enough to resolve it; for the law in this area is, and ought tobe, shaped by the urgent necessities we confront when there

is a strong case to be made for limiting relief despite theretroactive application of the law.

This is not a case where we need to address the issuewhether a party is entitled to a full remedy in a retroactivity
case, because that question arises only when the right is
predicated upon a new rule of law, see United States v. Johnson, 457 U. S. 537, 549 (1982), and Bendix Autolite Corp. v.
Midwesco Enterprises, Inc., 486 U. S. 888 (1988), did not announce a new rule. In the civil context, a case announces a
new rule of law "either by overruling clear past precedent
on which litigants may have relied, . . . or by deciding an
issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly
foreshadowed." Chevron Oil, supra, at 106; cf. Teague v.
Lane, supra, at 301 (new rule in criminal context is one not
"dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant's
conviction became final"). Respondent could not and does
not attempt to argue that the Bendix decision overruled
clear past precedent. Rather, she asserts its holding was
not clearly foreshadowed. As the Court was explicit to acknowledge in Bendix, however, it was "[a]pplying wellsettled constitutional principles," Bendix, supra, at 889, not

a new legal theory or one that had not been foreshadowed
by other precedents.

In Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Authority, 476 U. S. 573, 578-579 (1986), the Court identified two modes of analysis to evaluate state statutes under
the Commerce Clause. The Court will consider the statute
invalid without further inquiry when it "directly regulates
or discriminates against interstate commerce, or when its

effect is to favor in-state economic interests over out-of-stateinterests,"

id., at 579; and it will balance the State's interest
against the burden on interstate commerce when the statute"has only indirect effects on interstate commerce and regulates evenhandedly," ibid. (citing Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.,
397 U. S. 137, 142 (1970)). Respondent concedes that the
Pike balancing test is well established but claims its application to the Ohio tolling provision in Bendix was notpredictable.

Her argument fails on two fronts. First, in Bendix theCourt observed the Ohio tolling provision was so blatant an
affront to interstate commerce that it might be considered
invalid without engaging in the balancing test. See 486
U. S., at 891; see also id., at 898 (Scalia, J., concurring). Second, the balancing test provides a clear and certain standard
in cases such as Bendix, see id., at 894-895; and even if it
did not, the "application of precedent which directly controls
is not the stuff of which new law is made," Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 509 U. S. 86, 112 (1993) (Kennedy,
J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see
Wright v. West, 505 U. S. 277, 309 (1992) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) ("Where the beginning point is a rule
of . . . general application, a rule designed for the specific
purpose of evaluating a myriad of factual contexts, it will be
the infrequent case that yields a result so novel that it forges
a new rule, one not dictated by precedent"); see also Keene
Corp. v. United States, 508 U. S. 200, 215 (1993) (case does
not announce new rule where claims are resolved "under
well-settled law"); Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U. S. 481, 496 (1968) (case does not announce new rule unless it indicates "that the issue involved
was novel, that innovative principles were necessary to resolve it, or that the issue had been settled in prior cases in
a manner contrary to the view held by [the Court]").

PURKETT, SUPERINTENDENT, FARMINGTON

CORRECTIONAL CENTER v. ELEM

on petition for writ of certiorari to the unitedstates court of appeals for the eighth circuit

No. 94-802. Decided May 15, 1995
Relying on Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, respondent objected to a

prosecutor's use of a peremptory challenge to strike, inter alios, a black
male juror from the jury at his robbery trial. The Missouri trial court
overruled the objection after the prosecutor explained that he struck
the juror because of the juror's long, unkempt hair, his moustache, and
his beard. The jury was empaneled, and respondent was convicted.
On direct appeal, the State Court of Appeals affirmed the Batson ruling,
concluding that the prosecution had not engaged in purposeful discrimination. In denying respondent's subsequent petition for habeas corpus,
the Federal District Court concluded that the state courts' purposeful
discrimination determination was a factual finding entitled to a presumption of correctness and that the finding had support in the record.
The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the prosecution's explanation for striking the juror was pretextual and that the trial court had
clearly erred in finding no intentional discrimination.

Held: The Court of Appeals erred in its evaluation of respondent's Batson

claim. Under Batson, once the opponent of a peremptory challenge has
made out a prima facie racial discrimination case (step one), the proponent of the strike must come forward with a race-neutral explanation
(step two). If such an explanation is given, the trial court must decide
(step three) whether the opponent has proved purposeful racial discrimination. Step two requires only that the prosecution provide a raceneutral justification for the exclusion, not that the prosecution show that
the justification is plausible. The prosecutor's explanation in this case
satisfied step two, and the state court found that the prosecutor was not
motivated by discriminatory intent. In federal habeas proceedings, a
state court's factual findings are presumed to be correct if they are fairly
supported by the record. The Court of Appeals erred by combining
the second and third steps. In doing so, the court did not conclude or
even attempt to conclude that the state court's finding of no racial motive was not supported by the record, for its whole focus was upon the
motive's reasonableness rather than its genuineness.

Certiorari granted; 25 F. 3d 679, reversed and remanded.

Per Curiam
Per Curiam.
Respondent was convicted of second-degree robbery in aMissouri court. During jury selection, he objected to the

prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges to strike twoblack men from the jury panel, an objection arguably based
on Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986). The prosecutorexplained his strikes:

"I struck [ juror] number twenty-two because of his longhair. He had long curly hair. He had the longest hair
of anybody on the panel by far. He appeared to me tonot be a good juror for that fact, the fact that he had
long hair hanging down shoulder length, curly, unkempthair. Also, he had a mustache and a goatee type beard.
And juror number twenty-four also has a mustache andgoatee type beard. Those are the only two people on
the jury . . . with the facial hair . . . . And I don't likethe way they looked, with the way the hair is cut, both
of them. And the mustaches and the beards look suspi-cious to me." App. to Pet. for Cert. A-41.

The prosecutor further explained that he feared that jurornumber 24, who had had a sawed-off shotgun pointed at him
during a supermarket robbery, would believe that "to havea robbery you have to have a gun, and there is no gun in this
case." Ibid.The state trial court, without explanation, overruled respondent's objection and empaneled the jury. On direct ap-peal, respondent renewed his

Batson claim. The MissouriCourt of Appeals affirmed, finding that the "state's explanation constituted a legitimate `hunch' " and that "[t]hecircumstances fail[ed] to raise the necessary inference of
racial discrimination." State v. Elem, 747 S. W. 2d 772, 775(Mo. App. 1988).

Respondent then filed a petition for habeas corpus under28 U. S. C. $ 2254, asserting this and other claims. Adopting
the Magistrate Judge's report and recommendation, the Dis514us3$59K 05-27-98 19:06:29 PAGES OPINPGT

trict Court concluded that the Missouri courts' determina-tion that there had been no purposeful discrimination was a

factual finding entitled to a presumption of correctness under$ 2254(d). Since the finding had support in the record, the
District Court denied respondent's claim.

The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed andremanded with instructions to grant the writ of habeas corpus. It said:

"[W]here the prosecution strikes a prospective jurorwho is a member of the defendant's racial group, solely

on the basis of factors which are facially irrelevant to
the question of whether that person is qualified to serveas a juror in the particular case, the prosecution must at

least articulate some plausible race-neutral reason forbelieving those factors will somehow affect the person's
ability to perform his or her duties as a juror. In thepresent case, the prosecutor's comments, `I don't like the
way [he] look[s], with the way the hair is cut. . . . And
the mustach[e] and the bear[d] look suspicious to me,' donot constitute such legitimate race-neutral reasons for

striking juror 22." 25 F. 3d 679, 683 (1994).
It concluded that the "prosecution's explanation for strikingjuror 22 . . . was pretextual," and that the state trial court

had "clearly erred" in finding that striking juror number 22
had not been intentional discrimination. Id., at 684.Under our

Batson jurisprudence, once the opponent of a
peremptory challenge has made out a prima facie case of ra-cial discrimination (step one), the burden of production shifts

to the proponent of the strike to come forward with a raceneutral explanation (step two). If a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial court must then decide (step three)
whether the opponent of the strike has proved purposeful
racial discrimination. Hernandez v. New York, 500 U. S.
352, 358-359 (1991) (plurality opinion); id., at 375 (O'Connor,

second step of this process does not demand an explanationthat is persuasive, or even plausible. "At this [second] step

of the inquiry, the issue is the facial validity of the prosecu-tor's explanation. Unless a discriminatory intent is inherent
in the prosecutor's explanation, the reason offered will be
deemed race neutral." Hernandez, 500 U. S., at 360 (plu-rality opinion);

id., at 374 (O'Connor, J., concurring in
judgment).The Court of Appeals erred by combining

Batson's second
and third steps into one, requiring that the justification ten-dered at the second step be not just neutral but also at least

minimally persuasive, i. e., a "plausible" basis for believing
that "the person's ability to perform his or her duties as a
juror" will be affected. 25 F. 3d, at 683. It is not until the
third step that the persuasiveness of the justification becomes relevant--the step in which the trial court determines
whether the opponent of the strike has carried his burden
of proving purposeful discrimination. Batson, supra, at 98;
Hernandez, supra, at 359 (plurality opinion). At that stage,
implausible or fantastic justifications may (and probably will)
be found to be pretexts for purposeful discrimination. But
to say that a trial judge may choose to disbelieve a silly or
superstitious reason at step three is quite different from saying that a trial judge must terminate the inquiry at step two
when the race-neutral reason is silly or superstitious. The
latter violates the principle that the ultimate burden of persuasion regarding racial motivation rests with, and never
shifts from, the opponent of the strike. Cf. St. Mary's
Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U. S. 502, 511 (1993).

The Court of Appeals appears to have seized on our admonition in Batson that to rebut a prima facie case, the proponent of a strike "must give a `clear and reasonably specific'
explanation of his `legitimate reasons' for exercising the challenges," Batson, supra, at 98, n. 20 (quoting Texas Dept. of
Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248, 258 (1981)),
and that the reason must be "related to the particular case

to be tried," 476 U. S., at 98. See 25 F. 3d, at 682, 683. Thiswarning was meant to refute the notion that a prosecutor

could satisfy his burden of production by merely denyingthat he had a discriminatory motive or by merely affirming
his good faith. What it means by a "legitimate reason" is
not a reason that makes sense, but a reason that does notdeny equal protection. See

Hernandez, supra, at 359; cf.
Burdine, supra, at 255 ("The explanation provided must belegally sufficient to justify a judgment for the defendant").

The prosecutor's proffered explanation in this case--thathe struck juror number 22 because he had long, unkempt
hair, a mustache, and a beard--is race neutral and satisfies
the prosecution's step two burden of articulating a nondiscriminatory reason for the strike. "The wearing of beards
is not a characteristic that is peculiar to any race." EEOC
v. Greyhound Lines, Inc., 635 F. 2d 188, 190, n. 3 (CA3 1980).
And neither is the growing of long, unkempt hair. Thus, the
inquiry properly proceeded to step three, where the state
court found that the prosecutor was not motivated by discriminatory intent.

In habeas proceedings in federal courts, the factual findings of state courts are presumed to be correct, and may be
set aside, absent procedural error, only if they are "not fairly
supported by the record." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(8). See
Marshall v. Lonberger, 459 U. S. 422, 432 (1983). Here the
Court of Appeals did not conclude or even attempt to conclude that the state court's finding of no racial motive was
not fairly supported by the record. For its whole focus was
upon the reasonableness of the asserted nonracial motive
(which it thought required by step two) rather than the genuineness of the motive. It gave no proper basis for overturning the state court's finding of no racial motive, a finding
which turned primarily on an assessment of credibility, see
Batson, 476 U. S., at 98, n. 21. Cf. Marshall, supra, at 434.

granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent

with this opinion. It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Breyer joins,dissenting.
In my opinion it is unwise for the Court to announce alaw-changing decision without first ordering full briefing and
argument on the merits of the case. The Court does thistoday when it overrules a portion of our opinion in Batson
v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986).1In Batson, the Court held that the Equal Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids a prosecutorto use peremptory challenges to exclude African-Americans
from jury service because of their race. The Court articu-lated a three-step process for proving such violations.
First, a pattern of peremptory challenges of black jurors mayestablish a prima facie case of discriminatory purpose. Second, the prosecutor may rebut that prima face case by ten-dering a race-neutral explanation for the strikes. Third, the
court must decide whether that explanation is pretextual.
Id., at 96-98. At the second step of this inquiry, neither amere denial of improper motive nor an incredible explanation

will suffice to rebut the prima facie showing of discrimina-tory purpose. At a minimum, as the Court held in

Batson,the prosecutor "must articulate a neutral explanation related

to the particular case to be tried." Id., at 98.2

1 This is the second time this Term that the Court has misused its summary reversal authority in this way. See Duncan v. Henry, 513 U. S. 364,
367 (1995) (Stevens, J., dissenting).

2 We explained: "Nor may the prosecutor rebut the defendant's case

merely by denying that he had a discriminatory motive or `affirm[ing] [his]
good faith in making individual selections.' Alexander v. Louisiana, 405
U. S., at 632. If these general assertions were accepted as rebutting a
defendant's prima facie case, the Equal Protection Clause `would be but a
vain and illusory requirement.' Norris v. Alabama, [294 U. S. 587, 598

Today the Court holds that it did not mean what it said inBatson. Moreover, the Court resolves a novel procedural

question without even recognizing its importance to the un-usual facts of this case.

I
In the Missouri trial court, the judge rejected the defend-ant's

Batson objection to the prosecutor's peremptory chal-lenges of two jurors, juror number 22 and juror number 24,

on the ground that the defendant had not made out a primafacie case of discrimination. Accordingly, because the defendant had failed at the first step of the Batson inquiry, thejudge saw no need even to confirm the defendant's assertion
that jurors 22 and 24 were black; 3 nor did the judge requirethe prosecutor to explain his challenges. The prosecutor
nevertheless did volunteer an explanation,4 but the judgeevaluated neither its credibility nor its sufficiency.

(1935)]. The prosecutor therefore must articulate a neutral explanation
related to the particular case to be tried. The trial court then will have
the duty to determine if the defendant has established purposeful discrimination." Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S., at 97-98 (footnotes omitted).

3 The following exchange took place between the defense attorney and

the trial judge:

"MR. GOULET: Mr. Larner stated that the reason he struck was because of facial hair and long hair as prejudicial. Number twenty-four, Mr.
William Hunt, was a victim in a robbery and he stated that he could give
a fair and impartial hearing. To make this a proper record if the Court
would like to call up these two individuals to ask them if they are black
or will the Court take judicial notice that they are black individuals?

"THE COURT: I am not going to do that, no, sir." App. to Pet. for
Cert. A-42.

4 The prosecutor stated:

"I struck number twenty-two because of his long hair. He had long curly
hair. He had the longest hair of anybody on the panel by far. He appeared to me to not be a good juror for that fact, the fact that he had long
hair hanging down shoulder length, curly, unkempt hair. Also, he had a
mustache and a goatee type beard. And juror number twenty-four also
has a mustache and a goatee type beard. Those are the only two people
on the jury, numbers twenty-two and twenty-four with facial hair of any

772 PURKETT v. ELEM

Stevens, J., dissenting
The Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed, relying partly
on the ground that the use of one-third of the prosecutor's
peremptories to strike black veniremen did not require an
explanation, State v. Elem, 747 S. W. 2d 772, 774 (1988),
and partly on the ground that if any rebuttal was necessary
then the volunteered "explanation constituted a legitimate
`hunch,' " id., at 775. The court thus relied, alternatively, on
steps one and two of the Batson analysis without reaching
the question whether the prosecutor's explanation might
have been pretextual under step three.

The Federal District Court accepted a Magistrate's recommendation to deny petitioner's petition for habeas corpus
without conducting a hearing. The Magistrate had reasoned that state-court findings on the issue of purposeful discrimination are entitled to deference. App. to Pet. for Cert.
A-27. Even though the trial court had made no such findings, the Magistrate treated the statement by the Missouri
Court of Appeals that the prosecutor's reasons "constituted
a legitimate `hunch' " as a finding of fact that was supported
by the record.5 When the case reached the United States

Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, the parties apparently assumed that petitioner had satisfied the first step of
the Batson analysis.6 The disputed issue in the Court of

kind of all the men and, of course, the women, those are the only two with
the facial hair. And I don't like the way they looked, with the way the
hair is cut, both of them. And the mustaches and the beards look suspicious to me. And number twenty-four had been in a robbery in a supermarket with a sawed-off shotgun pointed at his face, and I didn't want
him on the jury as this case does not involve a shotgun, and maybe he
would feel to have a robbery you have to have a gun, and there is no gun
in this case." Id., at A-41.

5 The Magistrate stated: "The Court of Appeals determined that the

prosecutor's reasons for striking the men constituted a legitimate `hunch'
. . . . The record supports the Missouri Court of Appeals' finding of no
purposeful discrimination." Id., at A-27.

6 In this Court, at least, the State does not deny that the prosecutor's

pattern of challenges established a prima facie case of discrimination.

Appeals was whether the trial judge's contrary finding wasacademic because the prosecutor's volunteered statement

satisfied step two and had not been refuted in step three.The Court of Appeals agreed with the State that excluding
juror 24 was not error because the prosecutor's concern
about that juror's status as a former victim of a robbery wasrelated to the case at hand. 25 F. 3d 679, 681, 682 (1994).

The court did, however, find a Batson violation with respectto juror 22. In rejecting the prosecutor's "race-neutral" explanation for the strike, the Court of Appeals faithfully ap-plied the standard that we articulated in

Batson: The explanation was not " `related to the particular case to be tried.' "25 F. 3d, at 683, quoting 476 U. S., at 98 (emphasis in Court

of Appeals opinion).

Before applying the Batson test, the Court of Appealsnoted that its analysis was consistent with both the Missouri

Supreme Court's interpretation of Batson in State v. Antwine, 743 S. W. 2d 51 (1987) (en banc), and this Court's intervening opinion in Hernandez v. New York, 500 U. S. 352(1991). 25 F. 3d, at 683. Referring to the second stage of

the three-step analysis, the Antwine court had observed:

"We do not believe, however, that Batson is satisfied
by `neutral explanations' which are no more than faciallylegitimate, reasonably specific and clear. Were facially

neutral explanations sufficient without more, Batsonwould be meaningless. It would take little effort for
prosecutors who are of such a mind to adopt rote `neutral explanations' which bear facial legitimacy but con-ceal a discriminatory motive. We do not believe the

Supreme Court intended a charade when it announced
Batson." 743 S. W. 2d, at 65.

In Hernandez, this Court rejected a Batson claim stemming from a prosecutor's strikes of two Spanish-speaking
Latino jurors. The prosecutor explained that he struck the
jurors because he feared that they might not accept an inter514us3$59K 05-27-98 19:06:29 PAGES OPINPGT

Stevens, J., dissenting
preter's English translation of trial testimony given in Span-ish. Because the prosecutor's explanation was directly related to the particular case to be tried, it satisfied the secondprong of the

Batson standard. Moreover, as the Court of
Appeals noted, 25 F. 3d, at 683, the plurality opinion in Hernandez expressly observed that striking all venirepersons
who speak a given language, "without regard to the particular circumstances of the trial," might constitute a pretext
for racial discrimination. 500 U. S., at 371-372 (opinion of
Kennedy, J.).7 Based on our precedent, the Court of Appeals was entirely correct to conclude that the peremptory
strike of juror 22 violated Batson because the reason given
was unrelated to the circumstances of the trial.8

7 True, the plurality opinion in Hernandez stated that explanations unrelated to the particular circumstances of the trial "may be found by the
trial judge to be a pretext for racial discrimination," 500 U. S., at 372, and
thus it specifically referred to the third step in the Batson v. Kentucky,
476 U. S. 79 (1986), analysis. Nevertheless, if this comment was intended
to modify the Batson standard for determining the sufficiency of the
prosecutor's response to a prima facie case, it was certainly an obtuse
method of changing the law.

8 In my opinion, it is disrespectful to the conscientious judges on the

Court of Appeals who faithfully applied an unambiguous standard articulated in one of our opinions to say that they appear "to have seized on our
admonition in Batson . . . that the reason must be `related to the particular
case to be tried,' 476 U. S., at 98." Ante, at 768-769. Of course, they
"seized on" that point because we told them to. The Court of Appeals
was following Batson's clear mandate. To criticize those judges for doing
their jobs is singularly inappropriate.

The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is not the only court to
have taken our admonition in Batson seriously. Numerous courts have
acted on the assumption that we meant what we said when we required
the prosecutor's neutral explanation to be "related to the particular case
to be tried." See, e. g., Jones v. Ryan, 987 F. 2d 960, 974 (CA3 1993); Ex
parte Bird, 594 So. 2d 676, 682-683 (Ala. 1991); State v. Henderson, 112

Stevens, J., dissenting
Today, without argument, the Court replaces the Batsonstandard with the surprising announcement that any neutral

explanation, no matter how "implausible or fantastic," ante,at 768, even if it is "silly or superstitious," ibid., is sufficient
to rebut a prima facie case of discrimination. A trial courtmust accept that neutral explanation unless a separate "step
three" inquiry leads to the conclusion that the peremptorychallenge was racially motivated. The Court does not attempt to explain why a statement that "the juror had abeard," or "the juror's last name began with the letter `S' "
should satisfy step two, though a statement that "I had ahunch" should not. See

ante, at 769; Batson, 476 U. S., at98. It is not too much to ask that a prosecutor's explanation

for his strikes be race neutral, reasonably specific, and trialrelated. Nothing less will serve to rebut the inference of
race-based discrimination that arises when the defendant hasmade out a prima facie case. Cf.

Texas Dept. of CommunityAffairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248, 253 (1981). That, in any

event, is what we decided in Batson.

II
The Court's peremptory disposition of this case overlooksa tricky procedural problem. Ordinarily, a federal appeals

court reviewing a claim of Batson error in a habeas corpusproceeding must evaluate, with appropriate deference, the
factual findings and legal conclusions of the state trial court.But in this case, the only finding the trial judge made was
that the defendant had failed to establish a prima facie case.Everyone now agrees that finding was incorrect. The state
trial judge, holding that the defendant had failed at step one,

265, 271 (Mo. App. 1987); Slappy v. State, 503 So. 2d 350, 355 (Fla. App.
1987); Walker v. State, 611 So. 2d 1133, 1142 (Ala. Crim. App. 1992); Huntley v. State, 627 So. 2d 1011, 1012 (Ala. Crim. App. 1991). This Court
today calls into question the reasoning of all of these decisions without
even the courtesy of briefing and argument.

Stevens, J., dissenting
made no finding with respect to the sufficiency or credibilityof the prosecutor's explanation at step two. The question,

then, is whether the reviewing court should (1) go on to de-cide the second step of the

Batson inquiry, (2) reverse and
remand to the District Court for further proceedings, or (3)
grant the writ conditioned on a proper step-two and (if nec-essary) step-three hearing in the state trial court. This

Court's opinion today implicitly ratifies the Court of Appeals'decision to evaluate on its own whether the prosecutor had
satisfied step two. I think that is the correct resolution ofthis procedural question, but it deserves more consideration
than the Court has provided.

In many cases, a state trial court or a federal district court
will be in a better position to evaluate the facts surrounding
peremptory strikes than a federal appeals court. But I
would favor a rule giving the appeals court discretion, based
on the sufficiency of the record, to evaluate a prosecutor's
explanation of his strikes. In this case, I think review is
justified because the prosecutor volunteered reasons for the
challenges. The Court of Appeals reasonably assumed that
these were the same reasons the prosecutor would have
given had the trial court required him to respond to the
prima facie case. The Court of Appeals, in its discretion,
could thus evaluate the explanations for their sufficiency.
This presents a pure legal question, and nothing is gained by
remand if the appeals court can resolve that question on the
facts before it.

Assuming the Court of Appeals did not err in reaching
step two, a new problem arises when that court (or, as in
today's case, this Court) conducts the step-two inquiry and
decides that the prosecutor's explanation was sufficient.
Who may evaluate whether the prosecutor's explanation was
pretextual under step three of Batson? Again, I think the
question whether the Court of Appeals decides, or whether
it refers the question to a trial court, should depend on the
state of the record before the Court of Appeals. Whatever

Stevens, J., dissenting
procedure is contemplated, however, I think even this Courtwould acknowledge that some implausible, fantastic, and silly

explanations could be found to be pretextual without anyfurther evidence. Indeed, in

Hernandez the Court explained that a trial judge could find pretext based on nothing
more than a consistent policy of excluding all Spanish-speaking jurors if that characteristic was entirely unrelated

to the case to be tried. 500 U. S., at 371-372 (plurality opin-ion of

Kennedy, J.). Parallel reasoning would justify a
finding of pretext based on a policy of excusing jurors withbeards if beards have nothing to do with the pending case.

In some cases, conceivably the length and unkempt character of a juror's hair and goatee type beard might give rise to
a concern that he is a nonconformist who might not be a good
juror. In this case, however, the prosecutor did not identify
any such concern. He merely said he did not " `like the way
[the juror] looked,' " that the facial hair " `look[ed] suspicious.' " Ante, at 766. I think this explanation may well be
pretextual as a matter of law; it has nothing to do with the
case at hand, and it is just as evasive as "I had a hunch."
Unless a reviewing court may evaluate such explanations
when a trial judge fails to find that a prima facie case has
been established, appellate or collateral review of Batson
claims will amount to nothing more than the meaningless
charade that the Missouri Supreme Court correctly understood Batson to disfavor. Antwine, 743 S. W. 2d, at 65.

In my opinion, preoccupation with the niceties of a threestep analysis should not foreclose meaningful judicial review
of prosecutorial explanations that are entirely unrelated to
the case to be tried. I would adhere to the Batson rule that
such an explanation does not satisfy step two. Alternatively, I would hold that, in the absence of an explicit trial
court finding on the issue, a reviewing court may hold that
such an explanation is pretextual as a matter of law. The
Court's unnecessary tolerance of silly, fantastic, and implausible explanations, together with its assumption that there is

a difference of constitutional magnitude between a statementthat "I had a hunch about this juror based on his appearance," and "I challenged this juror because he had a mus-tache," demeans the importance of the values vindicated by
our decision in Batson.I respectfully dissent.

U. S. TERM LIMITS, INC., et al. v. THORNTON

et al.

certiorari to the supreme court of arkansas
No. 93-1456. Argued November 29, 1994--Decided May 22, 1995*
Respondent Hill filed this suit in Arkansas state court challenging the

constitutionality of $ 3 of Amendment 73 to the Arkansas Constitution,
which prohibits the name of an otherwise-eligible candidate for Congress from appearing on the general election ballot if that candidate has
already served three terms in the House of Representatives or two
terms in the Senate. The trial court held that $ 3 violated Article I of
the Federal Constitution, and the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed.
A plurality of the latter court concluded that the States have no authority "to change, add to, or diminish" the age, citizenship, and residency
requirements for congressional service enumerated in the Qualifications
Clauses, U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 2, cl. 2, and Art. I, $ 3, cl. 3, and rejected
the argument that Amendment 73 is constitutional because it is formulated as a ballot access restriction rather than an outright disqualification of congressional incumbents.

Held: Section 3 of Amendment 73 to the Arkansas Constitution violates

the Federal Constitution. Pp. 787-838.

(a) The power granted to each House of Congress to judge the "Qualifications of its own Members," Art. I, $ 5, cl. 1, does not include the
power to alter or add to the qualifications set forth in the Constitution's
text. Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S. 486, 540. After examining
Powell's analysis of the Qualifications Clauses' history and text, id., at
518-548, and its articulation of the "basic principles of our democratic
system," id., at 548, this Court reaffirms that the constitutional
qualifications for congressional service are "fixed," at least in the sense
that they may not be supplemented by Congress. Pp. 787-798.

(b) So too, the Constitution prohibits States from imposing congressional qualifications additional to those specifically enumerated in its
text. Petitioners' argument that States possess control over qualifications as part of the original powers reserved to them by the Tenth
Amendment is rejected for two reasons. First, the power to add qualifications is not within the States' pre-Tenth Amendment "original powers," but is a new right arising from the Constitution itself, and thus is

*Together with No. 93-1828, Bryant, Attorney General of Arkansas v.
Hill et al., also on certiorari to the same court.

Syllabus
not reserved. Second, even if the States possessed some original power
in this area, it must be concluded that the Framers intended the Constitution to be the exclusive source of qualifications for Members of Congress, and that the Framers thereby "divested" States of any power to
add qualifications. That this is so is demonstrated by the unanimity
among the courts and learned commentators who have considered the
issue; by the Constitution's structure and the text of pertinent constitutional provisions, including Art. I, $ 2, cl. 1, Art. I, $ 4, cl. 1, Art. I, $ 6,
and Art. I, $ 5, cl. 1; by the relevant historical materials, including the
records of the Constitutional Convention and the ratification debates, as
well as Congress' subsequent experience with state attempts to impose
qualifications; and, most importantly, by the "fundamental principle of
our representative democracy . . . `that the people should choose whom
they please to govern them,' " Powell, 395 U. S., at 547. Permitting
individual States to formulate diverse qualifications for their congressional representatives would result in a patchwork that would be inconsistent with the Framers' vision of a uniform National Legislature representing the people of the United States. The fact that, immediately
after the adoption of the Constitution, many States imposed term limits
and other qualifications on state officers, while only one State imposed
such a qualification on Members of Congress, provides further persuasive evidence of a general understanding that the qualifications in the
Constitution were unalterable by the States. Pp. 798-827.

(c) A state congressional term limits measure is unconstitutional
when it has the likely effect of handicapping a class of candidates and
has the sole purpose of creating additional qualifications indirectly.
The Court rejects petitioners' argument that Amendment 73 is valid
because it merely precludes certain congressional candidates from being
certified and having their names appear on the ballot, and allows them
to run as write-in candidates and serve if elected. Even if petitioners'
narrow understanding of qualifications is correct, Amendment 73 must
fall because it is an indirect attempt to evade the Qualifications Clauses'
requirements and trivializes the basic democratic principles underlying
those Clauses. Nor can the Court agree with petitioners' related argument that Amendment 73 is a permissible exercise of state power under
the Elections Clause, Art. I, $ 4, cl. 1, to regulate the "Times, Places
and Manner of holding Elections." A necessary consequence of that
argument is that Congress itself would have the power under the Elections Clause to "make or alter" a measure such as Amendment 73, a
result that is unfathomable under Powell. Moreover, petitioners' broad
construction is fundamentally inconsistent with the Framers' view of
the Elections Clause, which was intended to grant States authority to
protect the integrity and regularity of the election process by regulating

not to provide them with license to impose substantive qualifications
that would exclude classes of candidates from federal office. Pp. 828-836.

(d) State imposition of term limits for congressional service would
effect such a fundamental change in the constitutional framework that
it must come through a constitutional amendment properly passed under
the procedures set forth in Article V. Absent such an amendment,
allowing individual States to craft their own congressional qualifications
would erode the structure designed by the Framers to form a "more
perfect Union." Pp. 837-838.

Opinion of the Court
"No Person shall be a Representative who shall nothave attained to the Age of twenty five Years, and been

seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and whoshall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State
in which he shall be chosen."
Article I, $ 3, cl. 3, which applies to the Senate, similarlyprovides:

"No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have at-tained to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years
a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, whenelected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall
be chosen."
Today's cases present a challenge to an amendment to theArkansas State Constitution that prohibits the name of an

otherwise-eligible candidate for Congress from appearing onthe general election ballot if that candidate has already
served three terms in the House of Representatives or twoterms in the Senate. The Arkansas Supreme Court held
that the amendment violates the Federal Constitution. Weagree with that holding. Such a state-imposed restriction is
contrary to the "fundamental principle of our representativedemocracy," embodied in the Constitution, that "the people
should choose whom they please to govern them." Powellv. McCormack, 395 U. S. 486, 547 (1969) (internal quotation
marks omitted). Allowing individual States to adopt theirown qualifications for congressional service would be inconsistent with the Framers' vision of a uniform National Legis-lature representing the people of the United States. If the
qualifications set forth in the text of the Constitution are tobe changed, that text must be amended.

I
At the general election on November 3, 1992, the votersof Arkansas adopted Amendment 73 to their State Constitution. Proposed as a "Term Limitation Amendment," itspreamble stated:

784 U. S. TERM LIMITS, INC. v. THORNTON

Opinion of the Court
"The people of Arkansas find and declare that electedofficials who remain in office too long become preoccupied with reelection and ignore their duties as repre-sentatives of the people. Entrenched incumbency has
reduced voter participation and has led to an electoralsystem that is less free, less competitive, and less representative than the system established by the Found-ing Fathers. Therefore, the people of Arkansas, exercising their reserved powers, herein limit the terms ofelected officials."

The limitations in Amendment 73 apply to three categoriesof elected officials. Section 1 provides that no elected official in the executive branch of the state government mayserve more than two 4-year terms. Section 2 applies to the
legislative branch of the state government; it provides thatno member of the Arkansas House of Representatives may
serve more than three 2-year terms and no member of theArkansas Senate may serve more than two 4-year terms.
Section 3, the provision at issue in these cases, applies to theArkansas Congressional Delegation. It provides:

"(a) Any person having been elected to three or moreterms as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Arkansas shall not be certified as a can-didate and shall not be eligible to have his/her name
placed on the ballot for election to the United StatesHouse of Representatives from Arkansas.

"(b) Any person having been elected to two or moreterms as a member of the United States Senate from
Arkansas shall not be certified as a candidate and shallnot be eligible to have his/her name placed on the ballot
for election to the United States Senate from Arkansas."
Amendment 73 states that it is self-executing and shall applyto all persons seeking election after January 1, 1993.

On November 13, 1992, respondent Bobbie Hill, on behalfof herself, similarly situated Arkansas "citizens, residents,

taxpayers and registered voters," and the League of WomenVoters of Arkansas, filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for

Pulaski County, Arkansas, seeking a declaratory judgmentthat $ 3 of Amendment 73 is "unconstitutional and void."
Her complaint named as defendants then-Governor Clinton,other state officers, the Republican Party of Arkansas, and
the Democratic Party of Arkansas. The State of Arkansas,
through its Attorney General, petitioner Winston Bryant, in-tervened as a party defendant in support of the amendment.

Several proponents of the amendment also intervened, in-cluding petitioner U. S. Term Limits, Inc.

On cross-motions for summary judgment, the CircuitCourt held that $ 3 of Amendment 73 violated Article I of
the Federal Constitution.1With respect to that holding, in a 5-to-2 decision, the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed. U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v.
Hill, 316 Ark. 251, 872 S. W. 2d 349, 351 (1994). Writing for
a plurality of three justices, Justice Robert L. Brown concluded that the congressional restrictions in Amendment 73are unconstitutional because the States have no authority

"to change, add to, or diminish" the requirements for con-gressional service enumerated in the Qualifications Clauses.
Id., at 265, 872 S. W. 2d, at 356. He noted:

"If there is one watchword for representation of the various states in Congress, it is uniformity. Federal legis-lators speak to national issues that affect the citizens of

every state. . . . The uniformity in qualifications man1 The Circuit Court also held that $ 3 was severable from the other provisions of the amendment, but that the entire amendment was void
under state law for lack of an enacting clause. App. to Pet. for Cert. in

Court's decision regarding severability, U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Hill, 316
Ark. 251, 270, 872 S. W. 2d 349, 359 (1994), and reversed its decision regarding the enacting clause, id., at 263, 872 S. W. 2d, at 355. The decision
of the Arkansas Supreme Court with respect to those issues of state law
is not before us.

dated in Article 1 provides the tenor and the fabric forrepresentation in the Congress. Piecemeal restrictions

by State would fly in the face of that order." Ibid.
Justice Brown's plurality opinion also rejected the argu-ment that Amendment 73 is "merely a ballot access amendment," concluding that "[t]he intent and the effect of Amend-ment 73 are to disqualify congressional incumbents from
further service." Id., at 265-266, 872 S. W. 2d, at 356-357.Justice Brown considered the possibilities that an excluded
candidate might run for Congress as a write-in candidate orbe appointed to fill a vacancy to be "glimmers of opportunity
. . . [that] are faint indeed--so faint in our judgment thatthey cannot salvage Amendment 73 from constitutional attack." Id., at 266, 872 S. W. 2d, at 357. In separate opin-ions, Justice Dudley and Justice Gerald P. Brown agreed that
Amendment 73 violates the Federal Constitution.Two justices dissented from the federal constitutional
holding. Justice Hays started from "the premise that all po-litical authority resides in the people, limited only by those
provisions of the federal or state constitutions specifically tothe contrary."

Id., at 281, 872 S. W. 2d, at 367. Becausehis examination of the text and history of the Qualifications

Clauses convinced him that the Constitution contains no ex-press or implicit restriction on the States' ability to impose
additional qualifications on candidates for Congress, JusticeHays concluded that $ 3 is constitutional. Special Chief Justice Cracraft, drawing a distinction between a measure that"impose[s] an absolute bar on incumbent succession" and a
measure that "merely makes it more difficult for an incum-bent to be elected,"

id., at 284, 872 S. W. 2d, at 368, concludedthat Amendment 73 does not even implicate the Qualifications Clauses, and instead is merely a permissible ballotaccess restriction.

The State of Arkansas, by its Attorney General, and theintervenors petitioned for writs of certiorari. Because of
the importance of the issues, we granted both petitions and

Opinion of the Court
consolidated the cases for argument. See 512 U. S. 1218(1994). We now affirm.

II
As the opinions of the Arkansas Supreme Court suggest,the constitutionality of Amendment 73 depends critically on

the resolution of two distinct issues. The first is whetherthe Constitution forbids States to add to or alter the qualifications specifically enumerated in the Constitution. Thesecond is, if the Constitution does so forbid, whether the fact
that Amendment 73 is formulated as a ballot access restric-tion rather than as an outright disqualification is of constitutional significance. Our resolution of these issues drawsupon our prior resolution of a related but distinct issue:
whether Congress has the power to add to or alter the quali-fications of its Members.

Twenty-six years ago, in Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S.486 (1969), we reviewed the history and text of the Qualifications Clauses 2 in a case involving an attempted exclusion

2 As we explained, that term may describe more than the provisions
quoted, supra, at 783:

"In addition to the three qualifications set forth in Art. I, $ 2, Art. I, $ 3,
cl. 7, authorizes the disqualification of any person convicted in an impeachment proceeding from `any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the
United States'; Art. I, $ 6, cl. 2, provides that `no Person holding any Office
under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his
Continuance in Office'; and $ 3 of the 14th Amendment disqualifies any
person `who, having previously taken an oath . . . to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion
against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.' It has
been argued that each of these provisions, as well as the Guarantee Clause
of Article IV and the oath requirement of Art. VI, cl. 3, is no less a `qualification' within the meaning of Art. I, $ 5, than those set forth in Art. I,

$ 2." Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S. 486, 520, n. 41 (1969).

In Powell, we saw no need to resolve the question whether those additional provisions constitute "qualifications," because "both sides agree that
Powell was not ineligible under any of these provisions." Ibid. We similarly have no need to resolve that question today: Because those additional
provisions are part of the text of the Constitution, they have little bearing

Opinion of the Court
of a duly elected Member of Congress. The principal issuewas whether the power granted to each House in Art. I, $ 5,

cl. 1, to judge the "Qualifications of its own Members" 3 in-cludes the power to impose qualifications other than those
set forth in the text of the Constitution. In an opinion byChief Justice Warren for eight Members of the Court,

4 we

held that it does not. Because of the obvious importance ofthe issue, the Court's review of the history and meaning of

the relevant constitutional text was especially thorough.We therefore begin our analysis today with a full statement
of what we decided in that case.
The Issue in Powell

In November 1966, Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., was electedfrom a District in New York to serve in the United States

House of Representatives for the 90th Congress. Allega-tions that he had engaged in serious misconduct while serving as a committee chairman during the 89th Congress ledto the appointment of a Select Committee to determine his
eligibility to take his seat. That committee found that Pow-ell met the age, citizenship, and residency requirements set
forth in Art. I, $ 2, cl. 2. The committee also found, however,that Powell had wrongfully diverted House funds for the use
of others and himself and had made false reports on expendi-tures of foreign currency. Based on those findings, the
House after debate adopted House Resolution 278, excluding
on whether Congress and the States may add qualifications to those that
appear in the Constitution.

3 Art. I, $ 5, cl. 1, provides in part: "Each House shall be the Judge of

the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members, and a
Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do business . . . ."

4 Justice Stewart dissented on procedural grounds, arguing that the case

should have been dismissed as moot. See 395 U. S., at 559-561. Other
than expressing agreement with the characterization of the case as raising
constitutional issues which " `touch the bedrock of our political system
[and] strike at the very heart of representative government,' " id., at 573,
Justice Stewart did not comment on the merits.

Opinion of the Court
Powell from membership in the House, and declared his seatvacant. See 395 U. S., at 489-493.

Powell and several voters of the district from which hehad been elected filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment
that the House Resolution was invalid because Art. I, $ 2,cl. 2, sets forth the exclusive qualifications for House membership. We ultimately accepted that contention, conclud-ing that the House of Representatives has no "authority to
exclude 5 any person, duly elected by his constituents, whomeets all the requirements for membership expressly prescribed in the Constitution." 395 U. S., at 522 (emphasis inoriginal); see also

id., at 547.6 In reaching that conclusion,we undertook a detailed historical review to determine the

intent of the Framers. Though recognizing that the Consti-tutional Convention debates themselves were inconclusive,
see id., at 532, we determined that the "relevant historicalmaterials" reveal that Congress has no power to alter the
qualifications in the text of the Constitution, id., at 522.
Powell's Reliance on History

We started our analysis in Powell by examining the Brit-ish experience with qualifications for membership in Parliament, focusing in particular on the experience of JohnWilkes. While serving as a member of Parliament, Wilkes
had published an attack on a peace treaty with France. This

5 The Powell Court emphasized the word "exclude" because it had been
argued that the House Resolution depriving Powell of his seat should be
viewed as an expulsion rather than an exclusion. Having rejected that
submission, the Court expressed no opinion on issues related to the
House's power to expel a Member who has been sworn in and seated.

6 Though Powell addressed only the power of the House, the Court

pointed out that its rationale was equally applicable to the Senate: "Since
Art. I, $ 5, cl. 1, applies to both Houses of Congress, the scope of the Senate's power to judge the qualification of its members necessarily is identical to the scope of the House's power, with the exception, of course, that
Art. I, $ 3, cl. 3, establishes different age and citizenship requirements for
membership in the Senate." Id., at 522, n. 44.

Opinion of the Court
literary endeavor earned Wilkes a conviction for seditiouslibel and a 22-month prison sentence. In addition, Parliament declared Wilkes ineligible for membership and orderedhim expelled. Despite (or perhaps because of) these difficulties, Wilkes was reelected several times. Parliament,however, persisted in its refusal to seat him. After several
years of Wilkes' efforts, the House of Commons voted toexpunge the resolutions that had expelled Wilkes and had
declared him ineligible, labeling those prior actions " `sub-versive of the rights of the whole body of electors of this
kingdom.' " Id., at 528, quoting 22 Parliamentary Historyof England 1411 (1782) (Parl. Hist. Eng.). After reviewing
Wilkes' "long and bitter struggle for the right of the Britishelectorate to be represented by men of their own choice,"
395 U. S., at 528, we concluded in Powell that "on the eve ofthe Constitutional Convention, English precedent stood for
the proposition that `the law of the land had regulated thequalifications of members to serve in parliament' and those
qualifications were `not occasional but fixed.' " Ibid., quot-ing 16 Parl. Hist. Eng. 589, 590 (1769).

Against this historical background, we viewed the Conven-tion debates as manifesting the Framers' intent that the
qualifications in the Constitution be fixed and exclusive. Wefound particularly revealing the debate concerning a proposal made by the Committee of Detail that would havegiven Congress the power to add property qualifications.
James Madison argued that such a power would vest " `animproper & dangerous power in the Legislature,' " by which
the Legislature " `can by degrees subvert the Constitution.' "395 U. S., at 533-534, quoting 2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 249-250 (M. Farrand ed. 1911) (herein-after Farrand).

7 Madison continued: " `A Republic may be

7 Though we recognized that Madison was responding to a proposal that
would have allowed Congress to impose property restrictions, we noted
that "Madison's argument was not aimed at the imposition of a property

Opinion of the Court
converted into an aristocracy or oligarchy as well by limitingthe number capable of being elected, as the number authorised to elect.' " 395 U. S., at 534, quoting 2 Farrand 250.We expressly noted that the "parallel between Madison's
arguments and those made in Wilkes' behalf is striking."395 U. S., at 534.

The Framers further revealed their concerns about con-gressional abuse of power when Gouverneur Morris suggested modifying the proposal of the Committee of Detail togrant Congress unfettered power to add qualifications. We
noted that Hugh Williamson "expressed concern that if a ma-jority of the legislature should happen to be `composed of
any particular description of men, of lawyers for example,. . . the future elections might be secured to their own body.' "
Id., at 535, quoting 2 Farrand 250. We noted, too, that Madi-son emphasized the British Parliament's attempts to regulate qualifications, and that he observed: " `[T]he abuse theyhad made of it was a lesson worthy of our attention.' " 395
U. S., at 535, quoting 2 Farrand 250. We found significantthat the Convention rejected both Morris' modification and
the Committee's proposal.

We also recognized in Powell that the post-Convention rat-ification debates confirmed that the Framers understood the

qualifications in the Constitution to be fixed and unalterableby Congress. For example, we noted that in response to the
antifederalist charge that the new Constitution favored thewealthy and well born, Alexander Hamilton wrote:

" `The truth is that there is no method of securing tothe rich the preference apprehended but by prescribing
qualifications of property either for those who may elector be elected. But this forms no part of the power to
be conferred upon the national government. . . . The
qualification as such, but rather at the delegation to the Congress of the
discretionary power to establish any qualifications." Id., at 534.

514us3$60I 06-15-98 09:38:29 PAGES OPINPGT
792 U. S. TERM LIMITS, INC. v. THORNTON

Opinion of the Court
qualifications of the persons who may choose or be chosen, as has been remarked upon other occasions, are
defined and fixed in the Constitution, and are unalterable by the legislature.' " 395 U. S., at 539, quoting The
Federalist No. 60, p. 371 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (emphasis
added) (hereinafter The Federalist).

We thus attached special significance to "Hamilton's expressreliance on the immutability of the qualifications set forth in

the Constitution." 395 U. S., at 540. Moreover, we re-viewed the debates at the state conventions and found that
they "also demonstrate the Framers' understanding that the
qualifications for members of Congress had been fixed in theConstitution."

Ibid.; see, e. g., id., at 541, citing 3 Debates
on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 8 (J. Elliot ed.1863) (hereinafter Elliot's Debates) (Wilson Carey Nicholas,

Virginia).8The exercise by Congress of its power to judge the qualifications of its Members further confirmed this understand-ing. We concluded that, during the first 100 years of its
existence, "Congress strictly limited its power to judge the
qualifications of its members to those enumerated in the
Constitution." 395 U. S., at 542.

As this elaborate summary reveals, our historical analysis
in Powell was both detailed and persuasive. We thus conclude now, as we did in Powell, that history shows that, with

8 Our examination of the history also caused us to reject the argument
that the negative phrasing of the Clauses indicated that the Framers did
not limit the power of the House to impose additional qualifications for
membership. Id., at 537 (noting that the Committee of Style, which
edited the Qualifications Clauses to incorporate "their present negative
form," had " `no authority from the Convention to make alterations of substance in the Constitution as voted by the Convention, nor did it purport
to do so' "); id., at 539, quoting C. Warren, The Making of the Constitution
422, n. 1 (1947) (hereinafter Warren); see also 2 Farrand 553 (the Committee of Style was appointed "to revise the stile and arrange the articles
which had been agreed to").

Opinion of the Court
respect to Congress, the Framers intended the Constitutionto establish fixed qualifications.

Powell's Reliance on Democratic Principles

In Powell, of course, we did not rely solely on an analysisof the historical evidence, but instead complemented that

analysis with "an examination of the basic principles of ourdemocratic system."

Id., at 548. We noted that allowingCongress to impose additional qualifications would violate

that "fundamental principle of our representative democracy. . . `that the people should choose whom they please to
govern them.' " Id., at 547, quoting 2 Elliot's Debates 257(A. Hamilton, New York).

Our opinion made clear that this broad principle incorpo-rated at least two fundamental ideas.

10 First, we empha9 The text of the Qualifications Clauses also supports the result we
reached in Powell. John Dickinson of Delaware observed that the enumeration of a few qualifications "would by implication tie up the hands
of the Legislature from supplying omissions." 2 Farrand 123. Justice
Story made the same point:

"It would seem but fair reasoning upon the plainest principles of interpretation, that when the constitution established certain qualifications, as
necessary for office, it meant to exclude all others, as prerequisites. From
the very nature of such a provision, the affirmation of these qualifications
would seem to imply a negative of all others." 1 J. Story, Commentaries
on the Constitution of the United States $ 625 (3d ed. 1858) (hereinafter
Story). See also Warren 421 ("As the Constitution . . . expressly set forth
the qualifications of age, citizenship, and residence, and as the Convention
refused to grant to Congress power to establish qualifications in general,
the maxim expressio unius exclusio alterius would seem to apply").

As Dickinson's comment demonstrates, the Framers were well aware of
the expressio unius argument that would result from their wording of
the Qualifications Clauses; they adopted that wording nonetheless. There
thus is no merit either to the dissent's suggestion that Story was the first
to articulate the expressio unius argument, see post, at 868-869, or to the
dissent's assertion that that argument is completely without merit.

10 The principle also incorporated the more practical concern that reposing the power to adopt qualifications in Congress would lead to a selfperpetuating body to the detriment of the new Republic. See, e. g.,

514us3$60I 06-15-98 09:38:29 PAGES OPINPGT
794 U. S. TERM LIMITS, INC. v. THORNTON

Opinion of the Court
sized the egalitarian concept that the opportunity to beelected was open to all.

11 We noted in particular Madison's

statement in The Federalist that " `[u]nder these reasonablelimitations [enumerated in the Constitution], the door of this

part of the federal government is open to merit of everydescription, whether native or adoptive, whether young or
old, and without regard to poverty or wealth, or to any par-ticular profession of religious faith.' "

Powell, 395 U. S., at540, n. 74, quoting The Federalist No. 52, at 326. Similarly,

we noted that Wilson Carey Nicholas defended the Constitu-tion against the charge that it "violated democratic principles" by arguing: " `It has ever been considered a great secu-rity to liberty, that very few should be excluded from the
right of being chosen to the legislature. This Constitutionhas amply attended to this idea. We find no qualifications
required except those of age and residence.' " 395 U. S., at
541, quoting 3 Elliot's Debates 8.Second, we recognized the critical postulate that sovereignty is vested in the people, and that sovereignty conferson the people the right to choose freely their representatives
to the National Government. For example, we noted that
"Robert Livingston . . . endorsed this same fundamentalprinciple: `The people are the best judges who ought to represent them. To dictate and control them, to tell themwhom they shall not elect, is to abridge their natural

Powell, 395 U. S., at 533-534, quoting 2 Farrand 250 (Madison) (" `If the
Legislature could regulate [the qualification of electors or elected], it can
by degrees subvert the Constitution. A Republic may be converted into
an aristocracy or oligarchy as well by limiting the number capable of being
elected, as the number authorised to elect' "); 395 U. S., at 535-536 (citing
statements of Williamson and Madison emphasizing the potential for legislative abuse).

11 Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, post, at 879, we do not understand Powell as reading the Qualifications Clauses "to create a personal
right to be a candidate for Congress." The Clauses did, however, further
the interest of the people of the entire Nation in keeping the door to the
National Legislature open to merit of every description.

Opinion of the Court
rights.' " 395 U. S., at 541, n. 76, quoting 2 Elliot's Debates292-293. Similarly, we observed that "[b]efore the New

York convention . . . , Hamilton emphasized: `The true princi-ple of a republic is, that the people should choose whom they
please to govern them. Representation is imperfect in pro-portion as the current of popular favor is checked. This
great source of free government, popular election, should beperfectly pure, and the most unbounded liberty allowed.' "
395 U. S., at 540-541, quoting 2 Elliot's Debates 257. Quot-ing from the statement made in 1807 by the Chairman of the
House Committee on Elections, we noted that "restrictionsupon the people to choose their own representatives must be
limited to those `absolutely necessary for the safety of thesociety.' " 395 U. S., at 543, quoting 17 Annals of Cong. 874
(1807). Thus, in Powell, we agreed with the sentiment ex-pressed on behalf of Wilkes' admission to Parliament: " `That
the right of the electors to be represented by men of theirown choice, was so essential for the preservation of all their
other rights, that it ought to be considered as one of the mostsacred parts of our constitution.' " 395 U. S., at 534, n. 65,
quoting 16 Parl. Hist. Eng. 589-590 (1769).

Powell thus establishes two important propositions: first,that the "relevant historical materials" compel the conclusion

that, at least with respect to qualifications imposed by Con-gress, the Framers intended the qualifications listed in the
Constitution to be exclusive; and second, that that conclusionis equally compelled by an understanding of the "fundamental principle of our representative democracy . . . `that thepeople should choose whom they please to govern them.' "
395 U. S., at 547.
Powell's Holding

Petitioners argue somewhat half-heartedly that the nar-row holding in Powell, which involved the power of the

House to exclude a Member pursuant to Art. I, $ 5, does notcontrol the more general question whether Congress has the

Opinion of the Court
power to add qualifications. Powell, however, is not suscep-tible to such a narrow reading. Our conclusion that Congress may not alter or add to the qualifications in the Consti-tution was integral to our analysis and outcome. See, e. g.,
id., at 540 (noting "Framers' understanding that the qualifi-cations for members of Congress had been fixed in the Constitution"). Only two Terms ago we confirmed this under-standing of

Powell in Nixon v. United States, 506 U. S. 224(1993). After noting that the three qualifications for membership specified in Art. I, $ 2, are of "a precise, limited na-ture" and "unalterable by the legislature," we explained:

"Our conclusion in Powell was based on the fixedmeaning of `[q]ualifications' set forth in Art. I, $ 2. The
claim by the House that its power to `be the Judge ofthe Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own
Members' was a textual commitment of unreviewableauthority was defeated by the existence of this separate
provision specifying the only qualifications which mightbe imposed for House membership."

Id., at 237.12

12 Justice Thomas' dissent purports to agree with the outcome of Powell, but rejects the reasoning in the opinion. The dissent treats Powell
as simply an application of the "default rule" that if "the Constitution is
silent about the exercise of a particular power--that is, where the Constitution does not speak either expressly or by necessary implication--the
Federal Government lacks that power and the States enjoy it." Post, at
848, 876, 885-886. However, there is not a word in the Court's opinion
in Powell suggesting that the decision rested on the "default rule" that
undergirds the dissent's entire analysis. On the contrary, as the excerpt
from Nixon quoted in the text plainly states, our conclusion in Powell was
based on our understanding of the "fixed meaning of `[q]ualifications' set
forth in Art. I, $ 2." We concluded that the Framers affirmatively intended the qualifications set forth in the text of the Constitution to be
exclusive in order to effectuate the principle that in a representative democracy the people should choose whom they please to govern them.

Moreover, the Court has never treated the dissent's "default rule" as
absolute. In McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), for example,
Chief Justice Marshall rejected the argument that the Constitution's silence on state power to tax federal instrumentalities requires that States

Opinion of the Court
Unsurprisingly, the state courts and lower federal courts
have similarly concluded that Powell conclusively resolved
the issue whether Congress has the power to impose additional qualifications. See, e. g., Joyner v. Mofford, 706 F. 2d
1523, 1528 (CA9 1983) ("In Powell . . . , the Supreme Court
accepted this restrictive view of the Qualifications Clause--
at least as applied to Congress"); Michel v. Anderson, 14
F. 3d 623 (CADC 1994) (citing Nixon's description of Powell's
holding); Stumpf v. Lau, 108 Nev. 826, 830, 839 P. 2d 120,
122 (1992) (citing Powell for the proposition that "[n]ot even
Congress has the power to alter qualifications for these
constitutional federal officers").13

have the power to do so. Under the dissent's unyielding approach, it
would seem that McCulloch was wrongly decided. Similarly, the dissent's approach would invalidate our dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence, because the Constitution is clearly silent on the subject of state
legislation that discriminates against interstate commerce. However,
though Justice Thomas has endorsed just that argument, see, e. g., Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Jefferson Lines, Inc., ante, p. 175 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment, joined by Thomas, J.), the Court has consistently rejected that argument and has continued to apply the dormant Commerce
Clause, see, e. g., ante, at 179-180; Bendix Autolite Corp. v. Midwesco
Enterprises, Inc., 486 U. S. 888 (1988).

13 Our decision in Powell and its historical analysis were consistent with

prior decisions from state courts. For example, in State ex rel. Johnson
v. Crane, 65 Wyo. 189, 197 P. 2d 864 (1948), the Wyoming Supreme Court
undertook a detailed historical analysis and concluded that the Qualifications Clauses were exclusive. Several other courts reached the same result, though without performing the same detailed historical analysis.
See, e. g., Hellmann v. Collier, 217 Md. 93, 141 A. 2d 908 (1958); State
ex rel. Chandler v. Howell, 104 Wash. 99, 175 P. 569 (1918); State ex rel.
Eaton v. Schmahl, 140 Minn. 219, 167 N. W. 481 (1918); see generally State
ex rel. Johnson v. Crane, 65 Wyo., at 204-213, 197 P. 2d, at 869-874 (citing
cases).

The conclusion and analysis were also consistent with the positions
taken by commentators and scholars. See, e. g., n. 9, supra; see also Warren 412-422 (discussing history and concluding that "[t]he elimination of
all power in Congress to fix qualifications clearly left the provisions of the
Constitution itself as the sole source of qualifications").

Opinion of the Court
In sum, after examining Powell's historical analysis andits articulation of the "basic principles of our democratic system," we reaffirm that the qualifications for service in Con-gress set forth in the text of the Constitution are "fixed," at
least in the sense that they may not be supplemented byCongress.

III
Our reaffirmation of Powell does not necessarily resolvethe specific questions presented in these cases. For petitioners argue that whatever the constitutionality of addi-tional qualifications for membership imposed by Congress,
the historical and textual materials discussed in Powell donot support the conclusion that the Constitution prohibits
additional qualifications imposed by States. In the absenceof such a constitutional prohibition, petitioners argue, the
Tenth Amendment and the principle of reserved powersrequire that States be allowed to add such qualifications.

Before addressing these arguments, we find it appropriateto take note of the striking unanimity among the courts that
have considered the issue. None of the overwhelming arrayof briefs submitted by the parties and

amici has called toour attention even a single case in which a state court or

federal court has approved of a State's addition of qualifica-tions for a Member of Congress. To the contrary, an impressive number of courts have determined that States lackthe authority to add qualifications. See,

e. g., Chandler v.Howell, 104 Wash. 99, 175 P. 569 (1918); Eckwall v. Stadelman, 146 Ore. 439, 446, 30 P. 2d 1037, 1040 (1934); Stocktonv. McFarland, 56 Ariz. 138, 144, 106 P. 2d 328, 330 (1940);

may possibly be found to be nugatory"); 1 Story $ 627 (each

14 This impressive and uniform body of judicial decisions and learned commentary indi-cates that the obstacles confronting petitioners are formidable indeed.Petitioners argue that the Constitution contains no express prohibition against state-added qualifications, and thatAmendment 73 is therefore an appropriate exercise of a
State's reserved power to place additional restrictions on the
choices that its own voters may make. We disagree for two
independent reasons. First, we conclude that the power to
add qualifications is not within the "original powers" of the
States, and thus is not reserved to the States by the Tenth
Amendment. Second, even if States possessed some original power in this area, we conclude that the Framers in14 More recently, the commentators have split, with some arguing that
state-imposed term limits are constitutional, see, e. g., Gorsuch & Guzman,

Opinion of the Court
tended the Constitution to be the exclusive source of qualifi-cations for Members of Congress, and that the Framers

thereby "divested" States of any power to add qualifications.The "plan of the convention" as illuminated by the historical materials, our opinions, and the text of the Tenth Amendment draws a basic distinction between the powers of thenewly created Federal Government and the powers retained

by the pre-existing sovereign States. As Chief Justice Mar-shall explained, "it was neither necessary nor proper to define the powers retained by the States. These powers pro-ceed, not from the people of America, but from the people
of the several States; and remain, after the adoption of theconstitution, what they were before, except so far as they
may be abridged by that instrument." Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122, 193 (1819).This classic statement by the Chief Justice endorsed Hamilton's reasoning in The Federalist No. 32 that the plan of theConstitutional Convention did not contemplate "[a]n entire
consolidation of the States into one complete national sover-eignty," but only a partial consolidation in which "the State
governments would clearly retain all the rights of sover-eignty which they before had, and which were not, by that
act, exclusively delegated to the United States." The Federalist No. 32, at 198. The text of the Tenth Amendmentunambiguously confirms this principle:

"The powers not delegated to the United States by
the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are
reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."

As we have frequently noted, "[t]he States unquestionably
do retain a significant measure of sovereign authority. They
do so, however, only to the extent that the Constitution has
not divested them of their original powers and transferred
those powers to the Federal Government." Garcia v. San

Source of the Power

Contrary to petitioners' assertions, the power to add quali-fications is not part of the original powers of sovereignty

that the Tenth Amendment reserved to the States. Peti-tioners' Tenth Amendment argument misconceives the nature of the right at issue because that Amendment could only"reserve" that which existed before. As Justice Story recognized, "the states can exercise no powers whatsoever,which exclusively spring out of the existence of the national
government, which the constitution does not delegate tothem. . . . No state can say, that it has reserved, what it
never possessed." 1 Story $ 627.Justice Story's position thus echoes that of Chief Justice
Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819).In McCulloch, the Court rejected the argument that the
Constitution's silence on the subject of state power to taxcorporations chartered by Congress implies that the States
have "reserved" power to tax such federal instrumentalities.As Chief Justice Marshall pointed out, an "original right to
tax" such federal entities "never existed, and the questionwhether it has been surrendered, cannot arise."

Id., at 430.See also Crandall v. Nevada, 6 Wall. 35, 46 (1868). In language that presaged Justice Story's argument, Chief JusticeMarshall concluded: "This opinion does not deprive the
States of any resources which they originally possessed." 4Wheat., at 436.

15

15 Thus, contrary to the dissent's suggestion, post, at 856-857, Justice
Story was not the first, only, or even most influential proponent of the
principle that certain powers are not reserved to the States despite constitutional silence. Instead, as Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in McCulloch reveals, that principle has been a part of our jurisprudence for over
175 years.

Opinion of the Court
With respect to setting qualifications for service in Congress, no such right existed before the Constitution was ratified. The contrary argument overlooks the revolutionary
character of the Government that the Framers conceived.
Prior to the adoption of the Constitution, the States had
joined together under the Articles of Confederation. In that
system, "the States retained most of their sovereignty, like
independent nations bound together only by treaties." Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U. S. 1, 9 (1964). After the Constitutional Convention convened, the Framers were presented
with, and eventually adopted a variation of, "a plan not
merely to amend the Articles of Confederation but to create
an entirely new National Government with a National Executive, National Judiciary, and a National Legislature." Id.,
at 10. In adopting that plan, the Framers envisioned a uniform national system, rejecting the notion that the Nation
was a collection of States, and instead creating a direct link
between the National Government and the people of the
United States. See, e. g., FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S.
742, 791 (1982) (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part
and dissenting in part) ("The Constitution . . . permitt[ed]
direct contact between the National Government and the
individual citizen"). In that National Government, representatives owe primary allegiance not to the people of
a State, but to the people of the Nation. As Justice Story
observed, each Member of Congress is "an officer of the
union, deriving his powers and qualifications from the constitution, and neither created by, dependent upon, nor controllable by, the states. . . . Those officers owe their existence and
functions to the united voice of the whole, not of a portion,
of the people." 1 Story $ 627. Representatives and Senators are as much officers of the entire Union as is the President. States thus "have just as much right, and no more, to
prescribe new qualifications for a representative, as they
have for a president. . . . It is no original prerogative of state

Opinion of the Court
power to appoint a representative, a senator, or president
for the union." Ibid.16

We believe that the Constitution reflects the Framers' general agreement with the approach later articulated by Justice Story. For example, Art. I, $ 5, cl. 1, provides: "Each
House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members." The text of the Constitution
thus gives the representatives of all the people the final say
in judging the qualifications of the representatives of any
one State. For this reason, the dissent falters when it states
that "the people of Georgia have no say over whom the people of Massachusetts select to represent them in Congress."
Post, at 859.

Two other sections of the Constitution further support our
view of the Framers' vision. First, consistent with Story's
view, the Constitution provides that the salaries of representatives should "be ascertained by Law, and paid out of
the Treasury of the United States," Art. I, $ 6, rather than
by individual States. The salary provisions reflect the view
that representatives owe their allegiance to the people, and
not to the States. Second, the provisions governing elections reveal the Framers' understanding that powers over
the election of federal officers had to be delegated to, rather
than reserved by, the States. It is surely no coincidence
that the context of federal elections provides one of the few
areas in which the Constitution expressly requires action by
the States, namely that "[t]he Times, Places and Manner of
holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be

16 The Constitution's provision for election of Senators by the state legislatures, see Art. I, $ 3, cl. 1, is entirely consistent with this view. The
power of state legislatures to elect Senators comes from an express delegation of power from the Constitution, and thus was not at all based on
some aspect of original state power. Of course, with the adoption of the
Seventeenth Amendment, state power over the election of Senators was
eliminated, and Senators, like Representatives, were elected directly by
the people.

prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof." Art.I, $ 4, cl. 1. This duty parallels the duty under Article II

that "Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legis-lature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors." Art. II,

$ 1, cl. 2. These Clauses are express delegations of powerto the States to act with respect to federal elections.

17

This conclusion is consistent with our previous recognitionthat, in certain limited contexts, the power to regulate the

incidents of the federal system is not a reserved power ofthe States, but rather is delegated by the Constitution.
Thus, we have noted that "[w]hile, in a loose sense, the rightto vote for representatives in Congress is sometimes spoken
of as a right derived from the states, . . . this statement istrue only in the sense that the states are authorized by the
Constitution, to legislate on the subject as provided by $ 2 ofArt. I." United States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299, 315 (1941).
Cf. Hawke v. Smith, No. 1, 253 U. S. 221, 230 (1920) ("[T]hepower to ratify a proposed amendment to the Federal Constitution has its source in the Federal Constitution. The actof ratification by the State derives its authority from the
Federal Constitution to which the State and its people havealike assented").

In short, as the Framers recognized, electing representa-tives to the National Legislature was a new right, arising
from the Constitution itself. The Tenth Amendment thusprovides no basis for concluding that the States possess reserved power to add qualifications to those that are fixed inthe Constitution. Instead, any state power to set the qualifications for membership in Congress must derive not fromthe reserved powers of state sovereignty, but rather from
the delegated powers of national sovereignty. In the ab-sence of any constitutional delegation to the States of power
to add qualifications to those enumerated in the Constitution,such a power does not exist.

17 The Clauses also reflect the idea that the Constitution treats both the
President and Members of Congress as federal officers.

806 U. S. TERM LIMITS, INC. v. THORNTON

Opinion of the Court
The Preclusion of State Power

Even if we believed that States possessed as part of theiroriginal powers some control over congressional qualifications, the text and structure of the Constitution, the relevanthistorical materials, and, most importantly, the "basic principles of our democratic system" all demonstrate that theQualifications Clauses were intended to preclude the States
from exercising any such power and to fix as exclusive thequalifications in the Constitution.

Much of the historical analysis was undertaken by theCourt in Powell. See supra, at 789-793. There is, however, additional historical evidence that pertains directly tothe power of the States. That evidence, though perhaps not
as extensive as that reviewed in Powell, leads unavoidablyto the conclusion that the States lack the power to add
qualifications.
The Convention and Ratification Debates

The available affirmative evidence indicates the Framers'intent that States have no role in the setting of qualifications.

In Federalist Paper No. 52, dealing with the House of Repre-sentatives, Madison addressed the "qualifications of the electors and the elected." The Federalist No. 52, at 325. Madi-son first noted the difficulty in achieving uniformity in the
qualifications for electors, which resulted in the Framers'decision to require only that the qualifications for federal
electors be the same as those for state electors. Madisonargued that such a decision "must be satisfactory to every
State, because it is comfortable to the standard already es-tablished, or which may be established, by the State itself."
Id., at 326. Madison then explicitly contrasted the statecontrol over the qualifications of electors with the lack of
state control over the qualifications of the elected:

"The qualifications of the elected, being less carefullyand properly defined by the State constitutions, and

being at the same time more susceptible of uniformity,

807Cite as: 514 U. S. 779 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
have been very properly considered and regulated bythe convention. A representative of the United States

must be of the age of twenty-five years; must have beenseven years a citizen of the United States; must, at the
time of his election be an inhabitant of the State he isto represent; and, during the time of his service must
be in no office under the United States. Under thesereasonable limitations, the door of this part of the federal government is open to merit of every description,whether native or adoptive, whether young or old, and
without regard to poverty or wealth, or to any particu-lar profession of religious faith."

Ibid.18

18 The dissent places a novel and implausible interpretation on this paragraph. Consistent with its entire analysis, the dissent reads Madison as
saying that the sole purpose of the Qualifications Clauses was to set minimum qualifications that would prevent the States from sending incompetent representatives to Congress; in other words, Madison viewed the
Clauses as preventing the States from opening the door to this part of the
federal service too widely. See post, at 900-902.

The text of The Federalist No. 52 belies the dissent's reading. First,
Madison emphasized that "[t]he qualifications of the elected . . . [were]
more susceptible of uniformity." His emphasis on uniformity would be
quite anomalous if he envisioned that States would create for their representatives a patchwork of qualifications. Second, the idea that Madison
was in fact concerned that States would open the doors to national service
too widely is entirely inconsistent with Madison's emphasizing that the
Constitution kept "the door . . . open to merit of every description,
whether native or adoptive, whether young or old, and without regard to
poverty or wealth, or to any particular profession of religious faith." The
Federalist No. 52, at 326.

Finally the dissent argues that "Madison could not possibly have been
rebuking the States for setting unduly high qualifications for their representatives in Congress," post, at 901, and suggests that Madison's comments do not reflect "an implicit criticism of the States for setting unduly
high entrance barriers," post, at 902. We disagree. Though the dissent
attempts to minimize the extensiveness of state-imposed qualifications by
focusing on the qualifications that States imposed on delegates to Congress and the age restrictions that they imposed on state legislators, the
dissent neglects to give appropriate attention to the abundance of property, religious, and other qualifications that States imposed on state

514us3$60I 06-15-98 09:38:30 PAGES OPINPGT
808 U. S. TERM LIMITS, INC. v. THORNTON

Opinion of the Court
Madison emphasized this same idea in The Federalist No. 57:

"Who are to be the objects of popular choice? Everycitizen whose merit may recommend him to the esteem

and confidence of his country. No qualification of
wealth, of birth, of religious faith, or of civil professionis permitted to fetter the judgment or disappoint the

inclination of the people." The Federalist No. 57, at351 (emphasis added).

The provisions in the Constitution governing federal elec-tions confirm the Framers' intent that States lack power to
add qualifications. The Framers feared that the diverse in-terests of the States would undermine the National Legislature, and thus they adopted provisions intended to minimizethe possibility of state interference with federal elections.
For example, to prevent discrimination against federal elec-tors, the Framers required in Art. I, $ 2, cl. 1, that the qualifications for federal electors be the same as those for stateelectors. As Madison noted, allowing States to differentiate
between the qualifications for state and federal electors"would have rendered too dependent on the State governments that branch of the federal government which ought tobe dependent on the people alone." The Federalist No. 52,
at 326. Similarly, in Art. I, $ 4, cl. 1, though giving theStates the freedom to regulate the "Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections," the Framers created a safeguardagainst state abuse by giving Congress the power to "by
Law make or alter such Regulations." The Convention de-bates make clear that the Framers' overriding concern was
the potential for States' abuse of the power to set the
elected officials. As we describe in some detail, infra, at 823-826, nearly
every State had property qualifications, and many States had religious
qualifications, term limits, or other qualifications. As Madison surely recognized, without a constitutional prohibition, these qualifications could be
applied to federal representatives. We cannot read Madison's comments
on the "open door" of the Federal Government as anything but a rejection
of the "unduly high" barriers imposed by States.

"Times, Places and Manner" of elections. Madison notedthat "[i]t was impossible to foresee all the abuses that might

be made of the discretionary power." 2 Farrand 240. Gou-verneur Morris feared that "the States might make false
returns and then make no provisions for new elections."

was soundly defeated. Id., at 240-241. As Hamilton laternoted: "Nothing can be more evident than that an exclusive

ibid. (one justification for Times,Places and Manner Clause is that "[i]f we are in a humor to

presume abuses of power, it is as fair to presume them onthe part of the State governments as on the part of the
general government").19The Framers' discussion of the salary of representatives
reveals similar concerns. When the issue was first raised,Madison argued that congressional compensation should be
fixed in the Constitution, rather than left to state legisla-tures, because otherwise "it would create an improper dependence." 1 Farrand 216. George Mason agreed, noting

State" how to vote) (emphasis added). The novelty and expansiveness of
the dissent's attack is quite astonishing. We are aware of no case that
would even suggest that the validity of a state law under the Federal
Constitution would depend at all on whether the state law was passed by
the state legislature or by the people directly through amendment of the
state constitution. Indeed, no party has so argued. Quite simply, in our
view, the dissent's distinction between state legislation passed by the state
legislature and legislation passed by state constitutional amendment is
untenable. The qualifications in the Constitution are fixed, and may not
be altered by either States or their legislatures.

to be chosen, but who were most willing to serve." Ibid.When the issue was later reopened, Nathaniel Gorham

In light of the Framers' evident concern that States wouldtry to undermine the National Government, they could not

have intended States to have the power to set qualifications.Indeed, one of the more anomalous consequences of petitioners' argument is that it accepts federal supremacy over theprocedural aspects of determining the times, places, and
manner of elections while allowing the States carte blanchewith respect to the substantive qualifications for membership in Congress.The dissent nevertheless contends that the Framers' distrust of the States with respect to elections does not pre-clude the people of the States from adopting eligibility requirements to help narrow their own choices. See post, at888-889. As the dissent concedes,

would simply not hold elections for federal officers, andtherefore the Framers gave Congress the power to "make

or alter" state election regulations. Yet under the dissent'sapproach, the States could achieve exactly the same result

by simply setting qualifications for federal office sufficientlyhigh that no one could meet those qualifications. In our
view, it is inconceivable that the Framers would provide aspecific constitutional provision to ensure that federal elections would be held while at the same time allowing Statesto render those elections meaningless by simply ensuring
that no candidate could be qualified for office. Given theFramers' wariness over the potential for state abuse, we
must conclude that the specification of fixed qualifications inthe constitutional text was intended to prescribe uniform
rules that would preclude modification by either Congress orthe States.

21

We find further evidence of the Framers' intent in Art. I,$ 5, cl. 1, which provides: "Each House shall be the Judge of

the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Mem-bers." That Art. I, $ 5, vests a federal tribunal with ultimate authority to judge a Member's qualifications is fullyconsistent with the understanding that those qualifications
are fixed in the Federal Constitution, but not with the under-standing that they can be altered by the States. If the
States had the right to prescribe additional qualifications--

21 The dissent's arguments concerning these provisions of the Constitution, see post, at 889-895, simply reinforce our argument that the constitutional provisions surrounding elections all reveal the Framers' basic fear
that the States might act to undermine the National Legislature. For
example, as the dissent concedes, the Framers feared that States would
use the control over salaries to influence the votes of their representative.
See post, at 889-890. Similarly, the dissent concedes that the Times,
Places and Manner Clause reflects the Framers' fear that States would
not conduct federal elections at all. See post, at 894. We believe that
the dissent's reading of the provisions at issue understates considerably
the extent of the Framers' distrust. However, even under the dissent's
reading of the provisions, the text of the Constitution unquestionably reveals the Framers' distrust of the States regarding elections, and thus
provides powerful evidence supporting our view that the qualifications
established in the Constitution are exclusive.

such as property, educational, or professional qualifications--for their own representatives, state law would provide the

standard for judging a Member's eligibility. As we con-cluded in Murdock v. Memphis, 20 Wall. 590 (1875), federal
questions are generally answered finally by federal tribunalsbecause rights which depend on federal law "should be the
same everywhere" and "their construction should be uni-form."

Id., at 632. The judging of questions concerningrights which depend on state law is not, however, normally

assigned to federal tribunals. See id., at 636. The Consti-tution's provision for each House to be the judge of its own
qualifications thus provides further evidence that the Fram-ers believed that the primary source of those qualifications
would be federal law.We also find compelling the complete absence in the ratification debates of any assertion that States had the power toadd qualifications. In those debates, the question whether
to require term limits, or "rotation," was a major source ofcontroversy. The draft of the Constitution that was submitted for ratification contained no provision for rotation.22 Inarguments that echo in the preamble to Arkansas' Amendment 73, opponents of ratification condemned the absence ofa rotation requirement, noting that "there is no doubt that
senators will hold their office perpetually; and in this situa-tion, they must of necessity lose their dependence, and their
attachments to the people." 23 Even proponents of ratifica22 A proposal requiring rotation for Members of the House was proposed
at the Convention, see 1 Farrand 20, but was defeated unanimously, see

of Thomas Jefferson 82 (A. Lipscomb ed. 1904). Though he noted that
his reasoning on the matter "appears to me to be sound," he went on to
note:

"but, on so recent a change of view, caution requires us not to be too
confident, and that we admit this to be one of the doubtful questions on
which honest men may differ with the purest of motives; and the more
readily, as we find we have differed from ourselves on it." Id., at 83.

Opinion of the Court
"The people are the best judges who ought to representthem. To dictate and control them, to tell them whom

they shall not elect, is to abridge their natural rights.This rotation is an absurd species of ostracism." 2
Elliot's Debates 292-293.
Similarly, Hamilton argued that the representatives' need for
reelection rather than mandatory rotation was the more ef-fective way to keep representatives responsive to the people,

because "[w]hen a man knows he must quit his station, let
his merit be what it may, he will turn his attention chiefly to
his own emolument." Id., at 320.26

Regardless of which side has the better of the debate over
rotation, it is most striking that nowhere in the extensive
ratification debates have we found any statement by either
a proponent or an opponent of rotation that the draft constitution would permit States to require rotation for the representatives of their own citizens. If the participants in the
debate had believed that the States retained the authority
to impose term limits, it is inconceivable that the Federalists
would not have made this obvious response to the arguments
of the pro-rotation forces. The absence in an otherwise
freewheeling debate of any suggestion that States had the
power to impose additional qualifications unquestionably
reflects the Framers' common understanding that States
lacked that power.

In short, if it had been assumed that States could add additional qualifications, that assumption would have provided
the basis for a powerful rebuttal to the arguments being
advanced. The failure of intelligent and experienced advocates to utilize this argument must reflect a general agree26 George Washington made a similar argument:
"The power under the Constitution will always be in the People. It is
entrusted for certain defined purposes, and for a certain limited period, to
representatives of their own chusing; and whenever it is executed contrary
to their Interest, or not agreeable to their wishes, their Servants can, and
undoubtedly will be, recalled." 1 Bailyn 305, 306-307.

Opinion of the Court
ment that its premise was unsound, and that the power toadd qualifications was one that the Constitution denied the

States.27

27 Petitioners set forth several other arguments to support their contention that the Convention and ratification debates reveal that the qualifications in the Qualifications Clauses were not intended to be exclusive. We
find none of these persuasive.

Petitioners first observe that the notes of Edmund Randolph, who was
a member of the Committee of Detail, reveal that an early draft of the
Qualifications Clause provided:

"The qualifications of (a) delegates shall be the age of twenty-five years
at least. and citizenship: (and any person possessing these qualifications
may be elected except)." 2 Farrand 139 (footnote omitted).

Petitioners suggest that the deletion of the parenthetical material from
the Clause suggests that the Framers did not intend the Qualifications
Clause to be exclusive. We reject this argument. First, there is no evidence that the draft in Randolph's notes was ever presented to the Convention, and thus the deletion of the Clause tells us little about the views
of the Convention as a whole. Moreover, even assuming that the Convention had seen the draft, the deletion of the language without comment is
at least as consistent with a belief--as suggested by Dickinson, see n. 9,
supra--that the language was superfluous as with a concern that the language was inappropriate. Finally, contrary to the rather ingenious argument advanced in the dissent, see post, at 887-888, it seems to us irrelevant that the draft in question did not include a comparable parenthetical
clause referring to "elected" Senators because the draft contemplated that
Senators, unlike Representatives, would not be chosen by popular election.

Nor is there merit to the argument that the inclusion in the Committee's
final draft of a provision allowing each House to add property qualifications, see 2 Farrand 179, is somehow inconsistent with our holding today.
First, there is no conflict between our holding that the qualifications for
Congress are fixed in the Constitution and a provision in the Constitution
itself providing for property qualifications. Indeed, that is why our analysis is consistent with the other disqualifications contained in the Constitution itself. See n. 2, supra. The Constitution simply prohibits the imposition by either States or Congress of additional qualifications that are not
contained in the text of the Constitution. Second, of course, the property
provision was deleted, thus providing further evidence that the Framers
wanted to minimize the barriers that would exclude the most able citizens
from service in the National Government.

Respondent Republican Party of Arkansas also argues that the negative
phrasing of the Qualifications Clauses suggests that they were not meant

Opinion of the Court
Congressional Experience

Congress' subsequent experience with state-imposed qualifications provides further evidence of the general consensus
on the lack of state power in this area. In Powell, we examined that experience and noted that during the first 100
years of its existence, "Congress strictly limited its power to
judge the qualifications of its members to those enumerated
in the Constitution." 395 U. S., at 542. Congress first confronted the issue in 1807 when it faced a challenge to the
qualifications of William McCreery, a Representative from
Maryland who allegedly did not satisfy a residency requirement imposed by that State. In recommending that McCreery be seated, the Report of the House Committee on
Elections noted:

" `The committee proceeded to examine the Constitution, with relation to the case submitted to them, and
find that qualifications of members are therein determined, without reserving any authority to the State
Legislatures to change, add to, or diminish those qualifications; and that, by that instrument, Congress is constituted the sole judge of the qualifications prescribed
by it, and are obliged to decide agreeably to the Constitutional rules . . . .' " Powell, 395 U. S., at 542, quoting
17 Annals of Cong. 871 (1807) (emphasis added).28

The Chairman of the House Committee on Elections elaborated during debate:

to be exclusive. Brief for Respondents Republican Party of Arkansas
et al. 5-6. This argument was firmly rejected in Powell, see 395 U. S.,
at 537-539, and n. 73; see also Warren 422, n. 1, and we see no need to
revisit it now.

28 We recognize that the "Committee of Elections were not unanimous

in these sentiments," and that a "minority advocated the right of the State
Legislature to prescribe additional qualifications to the members from the
respective States." 17 Annals of Cong. 873 (1807).

Opinion of the Court
" `The Committee of Elections considered the qualifica-tions of members to have been unalterably determined

by the Federal Convention, unless changed by an au-thority equal to that which framed the Constitution at
first; that neither the State nor the Federal Legislaturesare vested with authority to add to those qualifications,
so as to change them.' " Powell, 395 U. S., at 542-543,quoting from 17 Annals of Cong. 872 (1807).

As we noted in Powell, the congressional debate over thecommittee's recommendation tended to focus on the "narrow
issue of the power of the States to add to the standing quali-fications set forth in the Constitution," 395 U. S., at 543.
The whole House, however, did not vote on the committee'sReport, and instead voted only on a simple resolution: "

Re-solved, That William McCreery is entitled to his seat in this

House." 17 Annals of Cong. 1238 (1807). That resolutionpassed by a vote of 89 to 18.

Ibid.Though the House Debate may be inconclusive, commentators at the time apparently viewed the seating of McCreeryas confirmation of the States' lack of power to add qualifications. For example, in a letter to Joseph Cabell, ThomasJefferson noted the argument that "to add new qualifications
to those of the Constitution would be as much an alterationas to detract from them"; he then added: "And so I think the
House of Representatives of Congress decided in some case;I believe that of a member from Baltimore." Letter of Jan.
31, 1814, to Joseph C. Cabell, in 14 Writings of Thomas Jef-ferson 82 (A. Lipscomb ed. 1904).

Similarly, for over 150 years prior to Powell, commenta-tors viewed the seating of McCreery as an expression of the
view of the House that States could not add to the qualifica-tions established in the Constitution. Thus, for example, referring to the McCreery debates, one commentator noted,"By the decision in this case, [and that in another contested
election], it seems to have been settled that the States havenot a right to require qualifications from members, different

from, or in addition to, those prescribed by the constitution."Cases of Contested Elections in Congress 171 (M. Clarke &

D. Hall eds. 1834) (emphasis in original). Other commenta-tors viewed the incident similarly. See,

e. g., G. Paschal, The
Constitution of the United States 66 (1876) (citing McCreery
to support the proposition that "[t]he Constitution havingfixed the qualifications of members, no

additional qualifications can rightfully be required by the States") (emphasis inoriginal); G. McCrary, American Law of Elections $ 323 (4th

ed. 1897) (citing McCreery and stating "A state law requiringthat a Representative in Congress shall reside in a particular
town and country within the district from which he is chosen
is unconstitutional and void"); W. Sutherland, Notes on the
Constitution of the United States 40 (1904) (citing McCreery
to support statement that "[t]his clause fixes the qualifications of members so far as state action is concerned, and no
additional qualifications can be required by the state"); C.
Burdick, Law of the American Constitution 160 (1922) (citing
McCreery to support the proposition that state-imposed
"limitations have been held . . . not to be effective"). Finally, it is clear that in Powell we viewed the seating of
McCreery as the House's acknowledgment that the qualifications in the Constitution were fixed. See 395 U. S.,
at 542-543.

The Senate experience with state-imposed qualifications
further supports our conclusions. In 1887, for example, the
Senate seated Charles Faulkner of West Virginia, despite the
fact that a provision of the West Virginia Constitution purported to render him ineligible to serve. The Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections unanimously concluded
that "no State can prescribe any qualification to the office of
United States Senator in addition to those declared in the
Constitution of the United States." S. Rep. No. 1, 50th
Cong., 1st Sess., 4 (1887). The Senate Committee on Rules
and Administration reached the same conclusion in 1964
when faced with a challenge to Pierre Salinger, who had

been appointed to serve as Senator from California. SeeS. Rep. No. 1381, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 5 ("It is well settled

that the qualifications established by the U. S. Constitutionfor the office of U. S. Senator are exclusive, and a State
cannot, by constitutional or statutory provisions, add to orenlarge upon those qualifications").

We recognize, as we did in Powell, that "congressionalpractice has been erratic"

29 and that the precedential value

of congressional exclusion cases is "quite limited." Powell,395 U. S., at 545-546. Nevertheless, those incidents lend

support to the result we reach today.
Democratic Principles

Our conclusion that States lack the power to impose quali-fications vindicates the same "fundamental principle of our

representative democracy" that we recognized in Powell,namely, that "the people should choose whom they please
to govern them." Id., at 547 (internal quotation marksomitted).

As we noted earlier, the Powell Court recognized that anegalitarian ideal--that election to the National Legislature
should be open to all people of merit--provided a criticalfoundation for the constitutional structure. This egalitarian
theme echoes throughout the constitutional debates. In TheFederalist No. 57, for example, Madison wrote:

"Who are to be the objects of popular choice? Everycitizen whose merit may recommend him to the esteem
and confidence of his country. No qualification ofwealth, of birth, of religious faith, or of civil profession
is permitted to fetter the judgment or disappoint theinclination of the people." The Federalist No. 57, at
351.
Similarly, hoping to persuade voters in New York that theConstitution should be ratified, John Stevens, Jr., wrote:

29 See, e. g., Powell, 395 U. S., at 544-546 (noting examples).

Opinion of the Court
"[N]o Government, that has ever yet existed in the world,affords so ample a field, to individuals of all ranks, for the

display of political talents and abilities. . . . No man who hasreal merit, let his situation be what it will, need despair." 1
Bailyn 487, 492. And Timothy Pickering noted that, "whileseveral of the state constitutions prescribe certain degrees
of property as indispensable qualifications for offices, thiswhich is proposed for the U. S. throws the door wide open
for the entrance of every man who enjoys the confidence ofhis fellow citizens." Letter from T. Pickering to C.

The egalitarian ideal, so val-ued by the Framers, is thus compromised to the same degree
by additional qualifications imposed by States as by thoseimposed by Congress.

Similarly, we believe that state-imposed qualifications, asmuch as congressionally imposed qualifications, would undermine the second critical idea recognized in Powell: that anaspect of sovereignty is the right of the people to vote for
whom they wish. Again, the source of the qualification isof little moment in assessing the qualification's restrictive
impact.Finally, state-imposed restrictions, unlike the congressionally imposed restrictions at issue in Powell, violate a thirdidea central to this basic principle: that the right to choose

Opinion of the Court
representatives belongs not to the States, but to the people.
From the start, the Framers recognized that the "great and
radical vice" of the Articles of Confederation was "the principle of LEGISLATION for STATES or GOVERNMENTS, in
their CORPORATE or COLLECTIVE CAPACITIES, and
as contradistinguished from the INDIVIDUALS of whom
they consist." The Federalist No. 15, at 108 (Hamilton).
Thus the Framers, in perhaps their most important contribution, conceived of a Federal Government directly responsible
to the people, possessed of direct power over the people, and
chosen directly, not by States, but by the people. See, e. g.,
supra, at 802-804. The Framers implemented this ideal
most clearly in the provision, extant from the beginning of
the Republic, that calls for the Members of the House of Representatives to be "chosen every second Year by the People
of the several States." Art. I, $ 2, cl. 1. Following the
adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, this ideal
was extended to elections for the Senate. The Congress of
the United States, therefore, is not a confederation of nations
in which separate sovereigns are represented by appointed
delegates, but is instead a body composed of representatives
of the people. As Chief Justice John Marshall observed:
"The government of the Union, then, . . . is, emphatically,
and truly, a government of the people. In form and in substance it emanates from them. Its powers are granted by
them, and are to be exercised directly on them, and for their
benefit." McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat., at 404-405.31
Ours is a "government of the people, by the people, for the
people." A. Lincoln, Gettysburg Address (1863).

31 Cf. Hawke v. Smith (No. 1), 253 U. S. 221, 226 (1920) ("The Constitution of the United States was ordained by the people, and, when duly
ratified, it became the Constitution of the people of the United States").

Confederation, reprinted in 2 Bailyn 926 ("we the under signed Delegates

822 U. S. TERM LIMITS, INC. v. THORNTON

Opinion of the Court
The Framers deemed this principle critical when they dis-cussed qualifications. For example, during the debates on

residency requirements, Morris noted that in the House, "thepeople at large, not the States, are represented." 2 Farrand
217 (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted). Similarly,George Read noted that the Framers "were forming a
Nati[ona]l Gov[ernmen]t and such a regulation wouldcorrespond little with the idea that we were one people."
Ibid. (emphasis in original). James Wilson "enforced thesame consideration."

Ibid.Consistent with these views, the constitutional structure

provides for a uniform salary to be paid from the nationaltreasury, allows the States but a limited role in federal elections, and maintains strict checks on state interference withthe federal election process. The Constitution also provides
that the qualifications of the representatives of each Statewill be judged by the representatives of the entire Nation.
The Constitution thus creates a uniform national body repre-senting the interests of a single people.

Permitting individual States to formulate diverse qualifi-cations for their representatives would result in a patchwork
of state qualifications, undermining the uniformity and thenational character that the Framers envisioned and sought
to ensure. Cf. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat., at 428-429 ("Those means are not given by the people of a particular
State, not given by the constituents of the legislature, . . .but by the people of all the States. They are given by all,
for the benefit of all--and upon theory, should be subjectedto that government only which belongs to all"). Such a
patchwork would also sever the direct link that the Framersfound so critical between the National Government and the
people of the United States.32

32 There is little significance to the fact that Amendment 73 was adopted
by a popular vote, rather than as an Act of the state legislature. See n. 19,
supra. In fact, none of the petitioners argues that the constitutionality
of a state law would depend on the method of its adoption. This is proper,

State Practice

Petitioners attempt to overcome this formidable array ofevidence against the States' power to impose qualifications

by arguing that the practice of the States immediately afterthe adoption of the Constitution demonstrates their understanding that they possessed such power. One may prop-erly question the extent to which the States' own practice is
a reliable indicator of the contours of restrictions that theConstitution imposed on States, especially when no court has
ever upheld a state-imposed qualification of any sort. Seesupra, at 798-799. But petitioners' argument is unpersuasive even on its own terms. At the time of the Convention,"[a]lmost all the State Constitutions required members of
their Legislatures to possess considerable property." SeeWarren 416-417.

because the voters of Arkansas, in adopting Amendment 73, were acting
as citizens of the State of Arkansas, and not as citizens of the National
Government. The people of the State of Arkansas have no more power
than does the Arkansas Legislature to supplement the qualifications for
service in Congress. As Chief Justice Marshall emphasized in McCulloch, "Those means are not given by the people of a particular State, not
given by the constituents of the legislature, . . . but by the people of all
the States." 4 Wheat., at 428-429.

The dissent concedes that the people of the Nation have an interest in
preventing any State from sending "immature, disloyal, or unknowledgeable representatives to Congress," post, at 869, but does not explain why
the people of the Nation lack a comparable interest in allowing every State
to send mature, loyal, and knowledgeable representatives to Congress.
In our view, the interest possessed by the people of the Nation and identified by the dissent is the same as the people's interest in making sure
that, within "reasonable limitations, the door to this part of the federal
government is open to merit of every description, whether native or adoptive, whether young or old, and without regard to poverty or wealth, or
to any particular profession of religious faith." The Federalist No. 52,
at 326.

State, Virginia, placed similar restrictions on Members ofCongress, requiring that a representative be, inter alia, a

"freeholder." See 1788 Va. Acts, ch. 2, $ 2.34 Just 15 yearsafter imposing a property qualification, Virginia replaced
that requirement with a provision requiring that representa-tives be only "qualified according to the constitution of the
United States." 1813 Va. Acts, ch. 23, $ 2. Moreover, sev-eral States, including New Hampshire, Georgia, Delaware,
and South Carolina, revised their Constitutions at around thetime of the Federal Constitution. In the revised Constitutions, each State retained property qualifications for its own
estate of 200 pounds for state senators; estate of 100 pounds, at least half
of which is freehold, for state representatives); 3 id., at 1691, 1694 (Maryland) (real and personal property of over 500 pounds for House of Delegates; real and personal property of 1,000 pounds for Senate); id., at 1897,
1898 (freehold estate of 300 pounds or personal estate of 600 pounds for
state senators; freehold estate of 100 pounds or ratable estate of 200
pounds for state representatives); 1 id., at 562 (Delaware) (state legislators
must be freeholders); 5 id., at 2595 (New Jersey) (members of Legislative
Council must be freeholders and must have real and personal property of
1,000 pounds; members of Assembly must have real and personal property
of 500 pounds); id., at 2631 (New York) (state senators must be freeholders); id., at 2790 (North Carolina) (100 acres of land for House; 300 acres
of land in Senate); 2 id., at 779 (Georgia) (150 acres of land or property of
250 pounds); 6 id., at 3251 (South Carolina) (freehold estate of 2,000 pounds
for state senate).

34 Judge Tucker expressed doubt about the constitutionality of the provisions of the Virginia statute, noting that "these provisions, as they require
qualifications which the constitution does not, may possibly be found to be
nugatory." 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries Appendix 213 (S. Tucker ed.
1803). Judge Tucker noted the two primary arguments against the power
to add such a qualification:

"First, that in a representative government, the people have an undoubted right to judge for themselves of the qualification of their delegate,
and if their opinion of the integrity of their representative will supply the
want of estate, there can be no reason for the government to interfere, by
saying, that the latter must and shall overbalance the former.

"Secondly; by requiring a qualification in estate it may often happen,
that men the best qualified in other respects might be incapacitated from
serving their country." Ibid.

state elected officials yet placed no property qualification onits congressional representatives.

The contemporaneous state practice with respect to termlimits is similar. At the time of the Convention, States

widely supported term limits in at least some circumstances.The Articles of Confederation contained a provision for term
limits.36 As we have noted, some members of the Conven-tion had sought to impose term limits for Members of Congress.37 In addition, many States imposed term limits on

35 See 4 Thorpe 2477, 2479 (New Hampshire) (100 pounds for House; 200
pounds for Senate); 2 id., at 786 (Georgia) (200 acres of land or 150 pounds
for House; 250 acres of land or 250 pounds for Senate); 6 id., at 3259 (South
Carolina) (500 acres and 10 slaves or 150 pounds sterling for House; 300
pounds sterling for Senate); 1 id., at 570, 571 (Delaware) (freehold for
House; freehold estate of 200 acres or real and personal property of 1,000
pounds for Senate). Pennsylvania amended its Constitution in 1790.
Neither the old constitution nor the amended one contained property qualifications for state representatives. See 5 id., at 3084; id., at 3092-3093.

Several State Constitutions also imposed religious qualifications on
state representatives. For example, New Hampshire's Constitution of
1784 and its Constitution of 1792 provided that members of the State Senate and House of Representatives be "of the protestant religion." 4 id., at
2460, 2461-2462 (1784 Constitution); id., at 2477, 2479 (1792 Constitution).
North Carolina's Constitution provided that "no clergyman, or preacher of
the gospel, of any denomination, shall be capable of being a member of
either the Senate, House of Commons, or Council of State," 5 id., at 2793,
and that "no person, who shall deny the being of God or the truth of the
Protestant religion . . . shall be capable of holding any office or place of
trust or profit in the civil department within this State," ibid. Georgia
and South Carolina also had religious qualifications in their Constitutions
for state legislators, see 2 id., at 779 (Georgia) ("of the Protestant religion"); 6 id., at 3252 (South Carolina) (must be "of the Protestant religion"), but deleted those provisions when they amended their Constitutions, in 1789, see 2 id., at 785, and in 1790, see 6 id., at 3258, respectively.
Article VI of the Federal Constitution, however, prohibited States from
imposing similar qualifications on federal legislators.

36 See 2 Bailyn 926, 927 ("[N]o person shall be capable of being a delegate

for more than three years in any term of six years").

40 New York attached to its ratification a list of proposed amendments

and "enjoin[ed] it upon their representatives in Congress to exert all their
influence, and use all reasonable means, to obtain a ratification." 1 Elliot's Debates 329. One of the proposed amendments was "That no person
be eligible as a senator for more than six years in any term of twelve
years." Id., at 330. In Virginia, the Convention similarly "enjoin[ed] it
upon their representatives," 2 Bailyn 564, to adopt "a Declaration or Bill
of Rights," id., at 558, which would include the statement that members
of the Executive and Legislative Branches "should at fixed periods be
reduced to a private station, return into the mass of the people; and the
vacancies be supplied by certain and regular elections; in which all or any
part of the former members to be eligible or ineligible, as the rules of the
Constitution of Government, and the laws shall direct," id., at 559. The
North Carolina Convention proposed nearly identical language, see id., at
566, though that Convention ultimately did not ratify the Constitution, see
4 Elliot's Debates 250-251. Thus, at least three States proposed some
form of constitutional amendment supporting term limits for Members
of Congress.

41 Petitioners and the dissent also point out that Georgia, Maryland,

Massachusetts, Virginia, and North Carolina added district residency requirements, and petitioners note that New Jersey and Connecticut established nominating processes for congressional candidates. They rely on

827Cite as: 514 U. S. 779 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
In sum, the available historical and textual evidence, readin light of the basic principles of democracy underlying the

Constitution and recognized by this Court in Powell, revealthe Framers' intent that neither Congress nor the States
should possess the power to supplement the exclusive quali-fications set forth in the text of the Constitution.

these facts to show that the States believed they had the power to add
qualifications. We again are unpersuaded. First, establishing a nominating process is no more setting a qualification for office than is creating
a primary. Second, it seems to us that States may simply have viewed
district residency requirements as the necessary analog to state residency
requirements. Thus, state practice with respect to residency requirements does not necessarily indicate that States believed that they had
a broad power to add restrictions. Finally, we consider the number of
state-imposed qualifications to be remarkably small. Despite the array of
property, religious, and other qualifications that were contained in State
Constitutions, petitioners and the dissent can point to only one instance of
a state-imposed property qualification on candidates for Congress, and five
instances of district residency requirements. The state practice seems to
us notable for its restraint, and thus supports the conclusion that States
did not believe that they generally had the power to add qualifications.

Nor are we persuaded by the more recent state practice involving qualifications such as those that bar felons from being elected. As we have
noted, the practice of States is a poor indicator of the effect of restraints
on the States, and no court has ever upheld one of these restrictions.
Moreover, as one moves away from 1789, it seems to us that state practice
is even less indicative of the Framers' understanding of state power.

Finally, it is important to reemphasize that the dissent simply has no
credible explanation as to why almost every State imposed property qualifications on state representatives but not on federal representatives. The
dissent relies first on the obvious but seemingly irrelevant proposition that
the state legislatures were larger than state congressional delegations.
Post, at 913-914, n. 37. If anything, the smaller size of the congressional
delegation would have made States more likely to put qualifications on
federal representatives since the election of any "pauper" would have
had proportionally greater significance. The dissent also suggests that
States failed to add qualifications out of fear that others, e. g., Congress,
believed that States lacked the power to add such qualifications. Of
course, this rationale is perfectly consistent with our view that the general understanding at the time was that States lacked the power to add
qualifications.

Opinion of the Court

IV
Petitioners argue that, even if States may not add qualifi-cations, Amendment 73 is constitutional because it is not

such a qualification, and because Amendment 73 is a per-missible exercise of state power to regulate the "Times,
Places and Manner of holding Elections." We reject thesecontentions.

Unlike $$ 1 and 2 of Amendment 73, which create absolutebars to service for long-term incumbents running for state
office, $ 3 merely provides that certain Senators and Repre-sentatives shall not be certified as candidates and shall not
have their names appear on the ballot. They may run aswrite-in candidates and, if elected, they may serve. Petitioners contend that only a legal bar to service creates an imper-missible qualification, and that Amendment 73 is therefore
consistent with the Constitution.Petitioners support their restrictive definition of qualifications with language from Storer v. Brown, 415 U. S. 724(1974), in which we faced a constitutional challenge to provisions of the California Elections Code that regulated the pro-cedures by which both independent candidates and candidates affiliated with qualified political parties could obtainballot position in general elections. The code required candidates affiliated with a qualified party to win a primaryelection, and required independents to make timely filing of
nomination papers signed by at least 5% of the entire votecast in the last general election. The code also denied ballot
position to independents who had voted in the most recentprimary election or who had registered their affiliation with
a qualified party during the previous year.In

Storer, we rejected the argument that the challengedprocedures created additional qualifications as "wholly without merit." Id., at 746, n. 16. We noted that petitioners"would not have been disqualified had they been nominated
at a party primary or by an adequately supported independ-ent petition and then elected at the general election." Ibid.

Opinion of the Court
We concluded that the California Code "no more establishesan additional requirement for the office of Representative

than the requirement that the candidate win the primary tosecure a place on the general ballot or otherwise demonstrate substantial community support." Ibid. See also
Joyner v. Mofford, 706 F. 2d, at 1531; Hopfmann v. Connolly,746 F. 2d 97, 103 (CA1 1984), vacated in part on other

grounds, 471 U. S. 459 (1985). Petitioners maintain that,under Storer, Amendment 73 is not a qualification.

We need not decide whether petitioners' narrow under-standing of qualifications is correct because, even if it is,
Amendment 73 may not stand. As we have often noted," `[c]onstitutional rights would be of little value if they could
be . . . indirectly denied.' " Harman v. Forssenius, 380 U. S.528, 540 (1965), quoting

Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649,664 (1944). The Constitution "nullifies sophisticated as well

as simple-minded modes" of infringing on constitutional pro-tections. Lane v. Wilson, 307 U. S. 268, 275 (1939); Harman
v. Forssenius, 380 U. S., at 540-541.In our view, Amendment 73 is an indirect attempt to accomplish what the Constitution prohibits Arkansas from ac-complishing directly. As the plurality opinion of the Arkansas Supreme Court recognized, Amendment 73 is an "effortto dress eligibility to stand for Congress in ballot access
clothing," because the "intent and the effect of Amendment73 are to disqualify congressional incumbents from further
service." 316 Ark., at 266, 872 S. W. 2d, at 357.42 We must,of course, accept the state court's view of the purpose of its
own law: We are thus authoritatively informed that the solepurpose of $ 3 of Amendment 73 was to attempt to achieve a
result that is forbidden by the Federal Constitution. In42 Justice Dudley noted in his concurrence: "I am reassured by the style
of this case, U. S. Term Limits, Inc. That name implies just what this
amendment is: A practical limit on the terms of the members of the Congress." 316 Ark., at 276, 872 S. W. 2d, at 364 (opinion concurring in part
and dissenting in part).

Opinion of the Court
deed, it cannot be seriously contended that the intent behind
Amendment 73 is other than to prevent the election of incumbents. The preamble of Amendment 73 states explicitly: "[T]he people of Arkansas . . . herein limit the terms of
elected officials." Sections 1 and 2 create absolute limits on
the number of terms that may be served. There is no hint
that $ 3 was intended to have any other purpose.

Petitioners do, however, contest the Arkansas Supreme
Court's conclusion that the amendment has the same practical effect as an absolute bar. They argue that the possibility
of a write-in campaign creates a real possibility for victory,
especially for an entrenched incumbent. One may reasonably question the merits of that contention.43 Indeed, we
are advised by the state court that there is nothing more
than a faint glimmer of possibility that the excluded candidate will win.44 Our prior cases, too, have suggested that

43 The uncontested data submitted to the Arkansas Supreme Court indicate that, in over 1,300 Senate elections since the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, only 1 has been won by a write-in candidate.
In over 20,000 House elections since the turn of the century, only 5 have
been won by write-in candidates. App. 201-202. Indeed, it is for this
reason that the Arkansas Supreme Court found the possibility of a
write-in victory to be a mere "glimme[r] of opportunity for those disqualified." 316 Ark., at 266, 872 S. W. 2d, at 357; see also id., at 276, 872
S. W. 2d, at 364 (Dudley, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("as
a practical matter, the amendment would place term limits on service in
the Congress").

44 Contrary to the dissent, post, at 919-920, we read a majority of the

Arkansas Supreme Court as holding that Amendment 73 has the same
practical effect as an absolute bar. See 316 Ark., at 266, 872 S. W. 2d, at
357 (plurality opinion) (the "intent and the effect of Amendment 73 are to
disqualify congressional incumbents from further service"); id., at 276, 872
S. W. 2d, at 364 (Dudley, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)
("That name implies just what this amendment is: A practical limit on the
terms of the members of the Congress"). However, as we note in the
text, infra, at 831, we do not rely on the state court's finding on this point.
See also infra, at 836.

write-in candidates have only a slight chance of victory.45But even if petitioners are correct that incumbents may occasionally win reelection as write-in candidates, there is no de-nying that the ballot restrictions will make it significantly
more difficult for the barred candidate to win the election.In our view, an amendment with the avowed purpose and
obvious effect of evading the requirements of the Qualifica-tions Clauses by handicapping a class of candidates cannot
stand. To argue otherwise is to suggest that the Framersspent significant time and energy in debating and crafting
Clauses that could be easily evaded. More importantly,allowing States to evade the Qualifications Clauses by
"dress[ing] eligibility to stand for Congress in ballot accessclothing" trivializes the basic principles of our democracy
that underlie those Clauses. Petitioners' argument treatsthe Qualifications Clauses not as the embodiment of a grand
principle, but rather as empty formalism. " `It is inconceiv-able that guaranties embedded in the Constitution of the
United States may thus be manipulated out of existence.' "

U. S. 583, 594 (1926).

45 We noted in Lubin v. Panish, 415 U. S. 709 (1974), that "[t]he realities
of the electoral process . . . strongly suggest that `access' via write-in votes
falls far short of access in terms of having the name of the candidate on
the ballot." Id., at 719, n. 5; see also Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S.

("Even if . . . voters may lawfully write into their ballots, cast at the

their ballots counted, the practical operation of the primary law . . . is
such as to impose serious restrictions upon the choice of candidates by the
voters"); Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428, 437, n. 7 (1992) ("If the dissent
were correct in suggesting that requiring primary voters to select a specific ballot impermissibly burdened the right to vote, it is clear under our

832 U. S. TERM LIMITS, INC. v. THORNTON

Opinion of the Court
Petitioners make the related argument that Amendment73 merely regulates the "Manner" of elections, and that the

amendment is therefore a permissible exercise of statepower under Article I, $ 4, cl. 1 (the Elections Clause), to
regulate the "Times, Places and Manner" of elections.46 Wecannot agree.

A necessary consequence of petitioners' argument is thatCongress itself would have the power to "make or alter" a
measure such as Amendment 73. Art. I, $ 4, cl. 1. See
Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355, 366-367 (1932) ("[T]he Con-gress may supplement these state regulations or may substitute its own"). That the Framers would have approved ofsuch a result is unfathomable. As our decision in Powell
and our discussion above make clear, the Framers wereparticularly concerned that a grant to Congress of the authority to set its own qualifications would lead inevitably tocongressional self-aggrandizement and the upsetting of the
delicate constitutional balance. See supra, at 790-791, andn. 10,

supra. Petitioners would have us believe, however,that even as the Framers carefully circumscribed congressional power to set qualifications, they intended to allow Con-gress to achieve the same result by simply formulating the
regulation as a ballot access restriction under the ElectionsClause. We refuse to adopt an interpretation of the Elections
Clause that would so cavalierly disregard what the Framersintended to be a fundamental constitutional safeguard.

Moreover, petitioners' broad construction of the ElectionsClause is fundamentally inconsistent with the Framers' view
of that Clause. The Framers intended the Elections Clauseto grant States authority to create procedural regulations,
not to provide States with license to exclude classes of candi46 Article I, $ 4, cl. 1, provides:
"The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and
Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature
thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such
Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators."

dates from federal office. During the Convention debates,for example, Madison illustrated the procedural focus of the

Elections Clause by noting that it covered "[w]hether theelectors should vote by ballot or viva^ voce, should assemble
at this place or that place; should be divided into districts orall meet at one place, sh[oul]d all vote for all the representatives; or all in a district vote for a number allotted to thedistrict." 2 Farrand 240. Similarly, during the ratification
debates, proponents of the Constitution noted: "[T]he powerover the manner only enables them to determine

how theseelectors shall elect--whether by ballot, or by vote, or by any

other way." 4 Elliot's Debates 71 (Steele statement atNorth Carolina ratifying convention) (emphasis in original).

47

Hamilton made a similar point in The Federalist No. 60,in which he defended the Constitution's grant to Congress

of the power to override state regulations. Hamiltonexpressly distinguished the broad power to set qualifications from the limited authority under the Elections Clause,noting that

"there is no method of securing to the rich the prefer-ence apprehended but by prescribing qualifications of
property either for those who may elect or be elected.But this forms no part of the power to be conferred upon
the national government. Its authority would be ex-pressly restricted to the regulation of the

times, the
places, and the manner of elections." The FederalistNo. 60, at 371 (emphasis in original).

As Hamilton's statement suggests, the Framers understoodthe Elections Clause as a grant of authority to issue procedural regulations, and not as a source of power to dictate

47 See also "The Republican," Connecticut Courant (Hartford, Jan. 7,
1788), 1 Bailyn 710, 713 ("The constitution expressly provides that the
choice shall be by the people, which cuts off both from the general and
state Legislatures the power of so regulating the mode of election, as to
deprive the people of a fair choice").

Opinion of the Court
electoral outcomes, to favor or disfavor a class of candidates,
or to evade important constitutional restraints.

Our cases interpreting state power under the Elections
Clause reflect the same understanding. The Elections
Clause gives States authority "to enact the numerous requirements as to procedure and safeguards which experience
shows are necessary in order to enforce the fundamental
right involved." Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S., at 366. However, "[t]he power to regulate the time, place, and manner
of elections does not justify, without more, the abridgment
of fundamental rights." Tashjian v. Republican Party of
Conn., 479 U. S. 208, 217 (1986). States are thus entitled to
adopt "generally applicable and evenhanded restrictions that
protect the integrity and reliability of the electoral process
itself." Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 788, n. 9
(1983). For example, in Storer v. Brown, 415 U. S. 724
(1974), the case on which petitioners place principal reliance,
we upheld the validity of certain provisions of the California
Elections Code. In so doing, we emphasized the States' interest in having orderly, fair, and honest elections "rather
than chaos." Id., at 730. We also recognized the "States'
strong interest in maintaining the integrity of the political
process by preventing interparty raiding," id., at 731, and
explained that the specific requirements applicable to independents were "expressive of a general state policy aimed at
maintaining the integrity of the various routes to the ballot,"
id., at 733. In other cases, we have approved the States'
interests in avoiding "voter confusion, ballot overcrowding,
or the presence of frivolous candidacies," Munro v. Socialist
Workers Party, 479 U. S. 189, 194-195 (1986), in "seeking to
assure that elections are operated equitably and efficiently,"
Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S., at 433, and in "guard[ing]
against irregularity and error in the tabulation of votes,"
Roudebush v. Hartke, 405 U. S. 15, 25 (1972). In short, we
have approved of state regulations designed to ensure that

elections are " `fair and honest and . . . [that] some sort oforder, rather than chaos, . . . accompan[ies] the democratic

processes.' " Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S., at 433, quotingStorer, 415 U. S., at 730.

The provisions at issue in Storer and our other ElectionsClause cases were thus constitutional because they regulated
election procedures and did not even arguably impose anysubstantive qualification rendering a class of potential candidates ineligible for ballot position. They served the stateinterest in protecting the integrity and regularity of the
election process, an interest independent of any attempt toevade the constitutional prohibition against the imposition of
additional qualifications for service in Congress. And theydid not involve measures that exclude candidates from the
ballot without reference to the candidates' support in theelectoral process. Our cases upholding state regulations of
election procedures thus provide little support for the con-tention that a state-imposed ballot access restriction is constitutional when it is undertaken for the twin goals of disad-vantaging a particular class of candidates and evading the
dictates of the Qualifications Clauses.48

48 Nor does Clements v. Fashing, 457 U. S. 957 (1982), support petitioners. In Clements, the Court rejected First and Fourteenth Amendment
challenges to Texas' so-called "resign-to-run" provision. That provision
treated an elected state official's declaration of candidacy for another
elected office as an automatic resignation from the office then held. We
noted that the regulation was a permissible attempt to regulate state officeholders. See id., at 972 ("Appellees are elected state officeholders who
contest restrictions on partisan political activity") (emphasis deleted); id.,
at 974, n. 1 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)
("The fact that appellees hold state office is sufficient to justify a restriction on their ability to run for other office that is not imposed on the public
generally"). As the Ninth Circuit recognized in upholding a similar
resign-to-run statute from Arizona: "The burden on candidacy . . . is indirect and attributable to a desire to regulate state officeholders and not to
impose additional qualifications to serving in Congress." Joyner v. Mofford, 706 F. 2d 1523, 1528 (1983); see also Signorelli v. Evans, 637 F. 2d

Opinion of the Court
We do not understand the dissent to contest our primarythesis, namely, that if the qualifications for Congress are

fixed in the Constitution, then a state-passed measure withthe avowed purpose of imposing indirectly such an additional
qualification violates the Constitution. The dissent, instead,raises two objections, challenging the assertion that the Arkansas amendment has the likely effect of creating a qualifi-cation,

post, at 917-919, and suggesting that the true intentof Amendment 73 was not to evade the Qualifications Clauses

but rather to simply "level the playing field," post, at 922.Neither of these objections has merit.

As to the first, it is simply irrelevant to our holding today.
As we note above in n. 45, our prior cases strongly suggestthat write-in candidates will have only a slim chance of

success, and the Arkansas plurality agreed. However, weexpressly do not rest on this Court's prior observations regarding write-in candidates. Instead, we hold that a stateamendment is unconstitutional when it has the likely effect
of handicapping a class of candidates and has the sole pur-pose of creating additional qualifications indirectly. Thus,
the dissent's discussion of the evidence concerning the possibility that a popular incumbent will win a write-in electionis simply beside the point.

As to the second argument, we find wholly unpersuasivethe dissent's suggestion that Amendment 73 was designed
merely to "level the playing field." As we have noted,
supra, at 829-830, it is obvious that the sole purpose of
Amendment 73 was to limit the terms of elected officials,both state and federal, and that Amendment 73, therefore,

may not stand.
853, 859 (CA2 1980) ("New York's purpose is to regulate the judicial office
that [the candidate] holds, not the Congressional office he seeks"). Moreover, as now-Chief Judge Newman observed while upholding similar restrictions imposed by New York, such provisions "plac[e] no obstacle between [a candidate] and the ballot or his nomination or his election. He
is free to run and the people are free to choose him." Id., at 858.

Opinion of the Court

V
The merits of term limits, or "rotation," have been thesubject of debate since the formation of our Constitution,

when the Framers unanimously rejected a proposal to addsuch limits to the Constitution. The cogent arguments on
both sides of the question that were articulated during theprocess of ratification largely retain their force today. Over
half the States have adopted measures that impose such lim-its on some offices either directly or indirectly, and the Nation as a whole, notably by constitutional amendment, hasimposed a limit on the number of terms that the President
may serve.49 Term limits, like any other qualification foroffice, unquestionably restrict the ability of voters to vote
for whom they wish. On the other hand, such limits mayprovide for the infusion of fresh ideas and new perspectives,
and may decrease the likelihood that representatives willlose touch with their constituents. It is not our province to
resolve this longstanding debate.We are, however, firmly convinced that allowing the several States to adopt term limits for congressional servicewould effect a fundamental change in the constitutional
framework. Any such change must come not by legislationadopted either by Congress or by an individual State, but
rather--as have other important changes in the electoralprocess

50--through the amendment procedures set forth in

Article V. The Framers decided that the qualifications forservice in the Congress of the United States be fixed in the

Constitution and be uniform throughout the Nation. Thatdecision reflects the Framers' understanding that Members
of Congress are chosen by separate constituencies, but that

terms).

limits); Amdt. 24 (1964) (prohibition against poll taxes); Amdt. 26 (1971)

they become, when elected, servants of the people of theUnited States. They are not merely delegates appointed by

separate, sovereign States; they occupy offices that are inte-gral and essential components of a single National Government. In the absence of a properly passed constitutionalamendment, allowing individual States to craft their own
qualifications for Congress would thus erode the structureenvisioned by the Framers, a structure that was designed,
in the words of the Preamble to our Constitution, to form a"more perfect Union."

The judgment is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Kennedy, concurring.
I join the opinion of the Court.The majority and dissenting opinions demonstrate the intricacy of the question whether or not the QualificationsClauses are exclusive. In my view, however, it is well settled that the whole people of the United States asserted theirpolitical identity and unity of purpose when they created the
federal system. The dissent's course of reasoning suggest-ing otherwise might be construed to disparage the republican character of the National Government, and it seems ap-propriate to add these few remarks to explain why that
course of argumentation runs counter to fundamental princi-ples of federalism.

Federalism was our Nation's own discovery. The Fram-ers split the atom of sovereignty. It was the genius of their
idea that our citizens would have two political capacities, onestate and one federal, each protected from incursion by the
other. The resulting Constitution created a legal systemunprecedented in form and design, establishing two orders
of government, each with its own direct relationship, its ownprivity, its own set of mutual rights and obligations to the
people who sustain it and are governed by it. It is appro-priate to recall these origins, which instruct us as to the

nature of the two different governments created and con-firmed by the Constitution.

A distinctive character of the National Government, themark of its legitimacy, is that it owes its existence to the act
of the whole people who created it. It must be remembered
that the National Government, too, is republican in essenceand in theory. John Jay insisted on this point early in The

Federalist Papers, in his comments on the government thatpreceded the one formed by the Constitution.

"To all general purposes we have uniformly been one
people; each individual citizen everywhere enjoying the
same national rights, privileges, and protection. . . ."A strong sense of the value and blessings of union

induced the people, at a very early period, to institutea federal government to preserve and perpetuate it.
They formed it almost as soon as they had a politicalexistence . . . ." The Federalist No. 2, pp. 38-39
(C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (hereinafter The Federalist).
Once the National Government was formed under our Constitution, the same republican principles continued to guide
its operation and practice. As James Madison explained, the
House of Representatives "derive[s] its powers from the people of America," and "the operation of the government on
the people in their individual capacities" makes it "a national
government," not merely a federal one. Id., No. 39, at 244,
245 (emphasis deleted). The Court confirmed this principle
in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 404-405 (1819),
when it said: "The government of the Union, then, . . . is,
emphatically, and truly, a government of the people. In
form and in substance it emanates from them. Its powers
are granted by them, and are to be exercised directly on
them, and for their benefit." The same theory led us to observe as follows in Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U. S. 651, 666
(1884): "In a republican government, like ours, . . . political

power is reposed in representatives of the entire body ofthe people."

In one sense it is true that "the people of each State re-tained their separate political identities," post, at 849, for the
Constitution takes care both to preserve the States and tomake use of their identities and structures at various points
in organizing the federal union. It does not at all followfrom this that the sole political identity of an American is
with the State of his or her residence. It denies the dualcharacter of the Federal Government which is its very foundation to assert that the people of the United States do nothave a political identity as well, one independent of, though
consistent with, their identity as citizens of the State of theirresidence. Cf. post, at 848-850. It must be recognized that
" `[f]or all the great purposes for which the Federal govern-ment was formed, we are one people, with one common country.' " Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618, 630 (1969) (quot-ing Passenger Cases, 7 How. 283, 492 (1849) (Taney, C. J.,
dissenting); see Crandall v. Nevada, 6 Wall. 35, 43 (1868)("The people of these United States constitute one nation"
and "have a government in which all of them are deeplyinterested").

It might be objected that because the States ratified theConstitution, the people can delegate power only through the
States or by acting in their capacities as citizens of particularStates. See

post, at 846. But in McCulloch v. Maryland,the Court set forth its authoritative rejection of this idea:

"The Convention which framed the constitution was in-deed elected by the State legislatures. But the instrument . . . was submitted to the people. . . . It is true,they assembled in their several States--and where else
should they have assembled? No political dreamer wasever wild enough to think of breaking down the lines
which separate the States, and of compounding theAmerican people into one common mass. Of consequence, when they act, they act in their States. But

the measures they adopt do not, on that account, ceaseto be the measures of the people themselves, or become

the measures of the State governments." 4 Wheat., at403.

The political identity of the entire people of the Union isreinforced by the proposition, which I take to be beyond dispute, that, though limited as to its objects, the National Gov-ernment is, and must be, controlled by the people without
collateral interference by the States. McCulloch affirmedthis proposition as well, when the Court rejected the suggestion that States could interfere with federal powers. "Thiswas not intended by the American people. They did not design to make their government dependent on the States."
Id., at 432. The States have no power, reserved or other-wise, over the exercise of federal authority within its proper

sphere. See id., at 430 (where there is an attempt at "usur-pation of a power which the people of a single State cannot
give," there can be no question whether the power "has beensurrendered" by the people of a single State because "[t]he
right never existed"). That the States may not invade thesphere of federal sovereignty is as incontestable, in my view,
as the corollary proposition that the Federal Governmentmust be held within the boundaries of its own power when
it intrudes upon matters reserved to the States. See UnitedStates v. Lopez, ante, p. 549.

Of course, because the Framers recognized that statepower and identity were essential parts of the federal balance, see The Federalist No. 39, the Constitution is solicitousof the prerogatives of the States, even in an otherwise sovereign federal province. The Constitution uses state bound-aries to fix the size of congressional delegations, Art. I, $ 2,
cl. 3, ensures that each State shall have at least one repre-sentative,

ibid., grants States certain powers over the times,places, and manner of federal elections (subject to congressional revision), Art. I, $ 4, cl. 1, requires that when the Pres-ident is elected by the House of Representatives, the delega514us3$60L 06-15-98 09:38:30 PAGES OPINPGT

tions from each State have one vote, Art. II, $ 1, cl. 3, andAmdt. 12, and allows States to appoint electors for the President, Art. II, $ 1, cl. 2. Nothing in the Constitution or TheFederalist Papers, however, supports the idea of state interference with the most basic relation between the National
Government and its citizens, the selection of legislative rep-resentatives. Indeed, even though the Constitution uses the

qualifications for voters of the most numerous branch of theStates' own legislatures to set the qualifications of federal
electors, Art. I, $ 2, cl. 1, when these electors vote, we haverecognized that they act in a federal capacity and exercise a
federal right. Addressing this principle in Ex parte Yarbrough the Court stated as follows: "[T]he right to vote for
a member of Congress" is an "office . . . created by that Constitution, and by that alone. . . . It is not true, therefore, that
electors for members of Congress owe their right to vote to
the State law in any sense which makes the exercise of the
right to depend exclusively on the law of the State." 110
U. S., at 663-664. We made the same point in United States
v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299, 315 (1941), when we said: "[T]he
right of qualified voters within a state to cast their ballots
and have them counted at Congressional elections . . . is a
right secured by the Constitution" and "is secured against
the action of individuals as well as of states."

The federal character of congressional elections flows from
the political reality that our National Government is republican in form and that national citizenship has privileges and
immunities protected from state abridgment by the force of
the Constitution itself. Even before the passage of the
Fourteenth Amendment, the latter proposition was given expression in Crandall v. Nevada where the Court recognized
the right of the Federal Government to call "any or all of its
citizens to aid in its service, as members of the Congress, of
the courts, of the executive departments, and to fill all its
other offices," and further recognized that "this right cannot
be made to depend upon the pleasure of a State over whose

territory they must pass to reach the point where these serv-ices must be rendered." 6 Wall., at 43. And without reference to the Privileges and Immunities Clause, the rights ofnational citizenship were upheld again in

United States v.
Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, 552 (1876), where the Court said:
"The right of the people peaceably to assemble for the pur-pose of petitioning Congress for a redress of grievances, or

for any thing else connected with the powers or the dutiesof the national government, is an attribute of national citizenship, and, as such, under the protection of, and guaran-teed by, the United States. The very idea of a government,
republican in form, implies a right on the part of its citizens
to meet peaceably for consultation in respect to public affairs
and to petition for a redress of grievances." Cf. Hague v.
Committee for Industrial Organization, 307 U. S. 496, 513
(1939) (opinion of Roberts, J., joined by Black, J., and joined
in relevant part by Hughes, C. J.) ("Citizenship of the United
States would be little better than a name if it did not carry
with it the right to discuss national legislation and the
benefits, advantages, and opportunities to accrue to citizens
therefrom").

In the Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 78-80 (1873),
the Court was careful to hold that federal citizenship in and
of itself suffices for the assertion of rights under the Constitution, rights that stem from sources other than the States.
Though the Slaughter-House Cases interpreted the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,
its view of the origins of federal citizenship was not confined
to that source. Referring to these rights of national dimension and origin the Court observed: "But lest it should be
said that no such privileges and immunities are to be found
if those we have been considering are excluded, we venture
to suggest some which owe their existence to the Federal
government, its National character, its Constitution, or its
laws." Id., at 79. Later cases only reinforced the idea that
there are such incidents of national citizenship. See Ex

United States v. Classic, supra; United
States v. Guest, 383 U. S. 745 (1966); Shapiro v. Thompson,394 U. S. 618 (1969). Federal privileges and immunities may

seem limited in their formulation by comparison with the
expansive definition given to the privileges and immunitiesattributed to state citizenship, see

Slaughter-House Cases,
supra, at 78; Hague, supra, at 520 (opinion of Stone, J.), butthat federal rights flow to the people of the United States by

virtue of national citizenship is beyond dispute.Not the least of the incongruities in the position advanced
by Arkansas is the proposition, necessary to its case, that it
can burden the rights of resident voters in federal elections
by reason of the manner in which they earlier had exercised
it. If the majority of the voters had been successful in selecting a candidate, they would be penalized from exercising
that same right in the future. Quite apart from any First
Amendment concerns, see Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U. S. 23,
30 (1968); Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 786-788
(1983), neither the law nor federal theory allows a State to
burden the exercise of federal rights in this manner. See
Terral v. Burke Constr. Co., supra, at 532; Shapiro v. Thompson, supra, at 629-631. Indeed, as one of the "right[s] of the
citizen[s] of this great country, protected by implied guarantees of its Constitution," the Court identified the right " `to
come to the seat of government . . . to share its offices, to
engage in administering its functions.' " Slaughter-House
Cases, supra, at 79 (quoting Crandall v. Nevada, 6 Wall., at
44). This observation serves to illustrate the extent of the
State's attempted interference with the federal right to vote
(and the derivative right to serve if elected by majority vote)
in a congressional election, rights that do not derive from
the state power in the first instance but that belong to the
voter in his or her capacity as a citizen of the United States.

ple surer control over the National Government, a control, itis said, that will be enhanced by the law at issue here. The

arguments for term limitations (or ballot restrictions havingthe same effect) are not lacking in force; but the issue, as all
of us must acknowledge, is not the efficacy of those measures
but whether they have a legitimate source, given their originin the enactments of a single State. There can be no doubt,

if we are to respect the republican origins of the Nation andpreserve its federal character, that there exists a federal
right of citizenship, a relationship between the people of theNation and their National Government, with which the
States may not interfere. Because the Arkansas enactmentintrudes upon this federal domain, it exceeds the boundaries
of the Constitution.

Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice,
Justice O'Connor, and Justice Scalia join, dissenting.

It is ironic that the Court bases today's decision on the
right of the people to "choose whom they please to govern
them." See ante, at 783, 793, 795, 819. Under our Constitution, there is only one State whose people have the right
to "choose whom they please" to represent Arkansas in Congress. The Court holds, however, that neither the elected
legislature of that State nor the people themselves (acting by
ballot initiative) may prescribe any qualifications for those
representatives. The majority therefore defends the right
of the people of Arkansas to "choose whom they please to
govern them" by invalidating a provision that won nearly
60% of the votes cast in a direct election and that carried
every congressional district in the State.

I dissent. Nothing in the Constitution deprives the people of each State of the power to prescribe eligibility requirements for the candidates who seek to represent them in Congress. The Constitution is simply silent on this question.
And where the Constitution is silent, it raises no bar to
action by the States or the people.

Thomas, J., dissenting

I
Because the majority fundamentally misunderstands thenotion of "reserved" powers, I start with some first principles. Contrary to the majority's suggestion, the people ofthe States need not point to any affirmative grant of power
in the Constitution in order to prescribe qualifications fortheir representatives in Congress, or to authorize their
elected state legislators to do so.

A
Our system of government rests on one overriding princi-ple: All power stems from the consent of the people. To

phrase the principle in this way, however, is to be impreciseabout something important to the notion of "reserved" powers. The ultimate source of the Constitution's authority isthe consent of the people of each individual State, not the
consent of the undifferentiated people of the Nation as awhole.

The ratification procedure erected by Article VII makesthis point clear. The Constitution took effect once it had
been ratified by the people gathered in convention in ninedifferent States. But the Constitution went into effect only
"between the States so ratifying the same," Art. VII; it didnot bind the people of North Carolina until they had accepted
it. In Madison's words, the popular consent upon which theConstitution's authority rests was "given by the people, not
as individuals composing one entire nation, but as composingthe distinct and independent States to which they respectively belong." The Federalist No. 39, p. 243 (C. Rossitered. 1961) (hereinafter The Federalist). Accord, 3 Debates in
the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Fed-eral Constitution 94 (J. Elliot 2d ed. 1876) (hereinafter Elliot)

1 The ringing initial words of the Constitution--"We the People of the
United States"--convey something of the same idea. (In the Constitution, after all, "the United States" is consistently a plural noun. See

When they adopted the Federal Constitution, of course,the people of each State surrendered some of their authority

to the United States (and hence to entities accountable tothe people of other States as well as to themselves). They
affirmatively deprived their States of certain powers, see,
e. g., Art. I, $ 10, and they affirmatively conferred certainpowers upon the Federal Government, see, e. g., Art. I, $ 8.

Because the people of the several States are the only truesource of power, however, the Federal Government enjoys no
authority beyond what the Constitution confers: The FederalGovernment's powers are limited and enumerated. In the
words of Justice Black: "The United States is entirely a crea-ture of the Constitution. Its power and authority have no
other source." Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, 5-6 (1957) (plu-rality opinion) (footnote omitted).

In each State, the remainder of the people's powers--"[t]he powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States," Amdt. 10--areeither delegated to the state government or retained by the
people. The Federal Constitution does not specify which ofthese two possibilities obtains; it is up to the various state
constitutions to declare which powers the people of eachState have delegated to their state government. As far as

Art. I, $ 9, cl. 8; Art. II, $ 1, cl. 7; Art. III, $ 2, cl. 1; Art. III, $ 3, cl. 1; cf.
Amar, Of Sovereignty and Federalism, 96 Yale L. J. 1425, 1455 (1987) (noting this fact, though reaching other conclusions).) The Preamble that the
Philadelphia Convention approved before sending the Constitution to the
Committee of Style is even clearer. It began: "We the people of the
States of New-Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode-Island and Providence
Plantations, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,

States would actually ratify the Constitution. M. Farrand, The Framing

at least, I agree with the majority that the Committee's edits did not work
a substantive change in the Constitution. Cf. ante, at 792, n. 8.

the Federal Constitution is concerned, then, the States canexercise all powers that the Constitution does not withhold

from them. The Federal Government and the States thusface different default rules: Where the Constitution is silent
about the exercise of a particular power--that is, where the
Constitution does not speak either expressly or by necessaryimplication--the Federal Government lacks that power and

the States enjoy it.These basic principles are enshrined in the Tenth Amendment, which declares that all powers neither delegated tothe Federal Government nor prohibited to the States "are
reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." With
this careful last phrase, the Amendment avoids taking any
position on the division of power between the state governments and the people of the States: It is up to the people of
each State to determine which "reserved" powers their state
government may exercise. But the Amendment does make
clear that powers reside at the state level except where the
Constitution removes them from that level. All powers that
the Constitution neither delegates to the Federal Government nor prohibits to the States are controlled by the people
of each State.

To be sure, when the Tenth Amendment uses the phrase
"the people," it does not specify whether it is referring to
the people of each State or the people of the Nation as a
whole. But the latter interpretation would make the
Amendment pointless: There would have been no reason to
provide that where the Constitution is silent about whether
a particular power resides at the state level, it might or
might not do so. In addition, it would make no sense to
speak of powers as being reserved to the undifferentiated
people of the Nation as a whole, because the Constitution
does not contemplate that those people will either exercise
power or delegate it. The Constitution simply does not recognize any mechanism for action by the undifferentiated people of the Nation. Thus, the amendment provision of Article

V calls for amendments to be ratified not by a convention ofthe national people, but by conventions of the people in each

State or by the state legislatures elected by those people.Likewise, the Constitution calls for Members of Congress to
be chosen State by State, rather than in nationwide elec-tions. Even the selection of the President--surely the most
national of national figures--is accomplished by an electoralcollege made up of delegates chosen by the various States,
and candidates can lose a Presidential election despite win-ning a majority of the votes cast in the Nation as a whole.
See also Art. II, $ 1, cl. 3 (providing that when no candidatesecures a majority of electoral votes, the election of the President is thrown into the House of Representatives, where"the Votes shall be taken by States, the Representatives
from each State having one Vote"); Amdt. 12 (same).In short, the notion of popular sovereignty that undergirds
the Constitution does not erase state boundaries, but rathertracks them. The people of each State obviously did trust
their fate to the people of the several States when they con-sented to the Constitution; not only did they empower the
governmental institutions of the United States, but they alsoagreed to be bound by constitutional amendments that they
themselves refused to ratify. See Art. V (providing thatproposed amendments shall take effect upon ratification by
three-quarters of the States). At the same time, however,the people of each State retained their separate political
identities. As Chief Justice Marshall put it, "[n]o politicaldreamer was ever wild enough to think of breaking down

references to "the people," Marshall was merely using that phrase in contradistinction to "the State governments." Counsel for Maryland had

Any ambiguity in the Tenth Amendment's use of thephrase "the people" is cleared up by the body of the Constitution itself. Article I begins by providing that the Con-gress of the United States enjoys "[a]ll legislative Powers
herein granted," $ 1, and goes on to give a careful enumera-tion of Congress' powers, $ 8. It then concludes by enumerating certain powers that are prohibited to the States. Theimport of this structure is the same as the import of the
Tenth Amendment: If we are to invalidate Arkansas' Amend-ment 73, we must point to something in the Federal Constitution that deprives the people of Arkansas of the power toenact such measures.

The majority disagrees that it bears this burden. But itsarguments are unpersuasive.

The majority begins by announcing an enormous and un-tenable limitation on the principle expressed by the Tenth

Amendment. According to the majority, the States possessonly those powers that the Constitution affirmatively grants
to them or that they enjoyed before the Constitution wasadopted; the Tenth Amendment "could only `reserve' that

noted that "the constitution was formed and adopted, not by the people of
the United States at large, but by the people of the respective States.
To suppose that the mere proposition of this fundamental law threw the
American people into one aggregate mass, would be to assume what the
instrument itself does not profess to establish." McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at
363 (argument of counsel). Marshall's opinion accepted this premise, even
borrowing some of counsel's language. See id., at 403. What Marshall
rejected was counsel's conclusion that the Constitution therefore was
merely "a compact between the States." See id., at 363 (argument of
counsel). As Marshall explained, the acts of "the people themselves" in
the various ratifying conventions should not be confused with "the measures of the State governments." Id., at 403; see also id., at 404 (noting
that no state government could control whether the people of that State
decided to adopt the Constitution).

which existed before." Ante, at 802. From the fact thatthe States had not previously enjoyed any powers over the

particular institutions of the Federal Government estab-lished by the Constitution,

3 the majority derives a rule precisely opposite to the one that the Amendment actually pre-scribes: " `[T]he states can exercise no powers whatsoever,

which exclusively spring out of the existence of the nationalgovernment, which the constitution does not delegate to
them.' " Ibid. (quoting 1 J. Story, Commentaries on the Con-stitution of the United States $ 627 (3d ed. 1858)).

The majority's essential logic is that the state govern-ments could not "reserve" any powers that they did not control at the time the Constitution was drafted. But it wasnot the state governments that were doing the reserving.
The Constitution derives its authority instead from the con-sent of

the people of the States. Given the fundamental
principle that all governmental powers stem from the peopleof the States, it would simply be incoherent to assert that

the people of the States could not reserve any powers thatthey had not previously controlled.

The Tenth Amendment's use of the word "reserved" does
not help the majority's position. If someone says that thepower to use a particular facility is reserved to some group,

he is not saying anything about whether that group has pre-viously used the facility. He is merely saying that the peo3 At the time of the framing, of course, a Federal Congress had been
operating under the Articles of Confederation for some 10 years. The
States unquestionably had enjoyed the power to establish qualifications
for their delegates to this body, above and beyond the qualifications created by the Articles themselves. See Brief for Respondents Bobbie E.
Hill et al. 39, n. 79 (conceding this point); see also, e. g., Md. Const. of
1776, Art. XXVII (prescribing such qualifications), in 3 Federal and State
Constitutions 1695-1696 (F. Thorpe ed. 1909) (hereinafter Thorpe); N. H.
Const. of 1784, Pt. II (same), in 4 Thorpe 2467. It is surprising, then, that
the concurring opinion seeks to buttress the majority's case by stressing
the continuing applicability of "the same republican principles" that had
prevailed under the Articles. See ante, at 839.

ple who control the facility have designated that group as
the entity with authority to use it. The Tenth Amendment
is similar: The people of the States, from whom all governmental powers stem, have specified that all powers not prohibited to the States by the Federal Constitution are reserved "to the States respectively, or to the people."

The majority is therefore quite wrong to conclude that the
people of the States cannot authorize their state governments to exercise any powers that were unknown to the
States when the Federal Constitution was drafted. Indeed,
the majority's position frustrates the apparent purpose of the
Amendment's final phrase. The Amendment does not preempt any limitations on state power found in the state constitutions, as it might have done if it simply had said that
the powers not delegated to the Federal Government are
reserved to the States. But the Amendment also does not
prevent the people of the States from amending their state
constitutions to remove limitations that were in effect when
the Federal Constitution and the Bill of Rights were ratified.

In an effort to defend its position, the majority points to
language in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit
Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 549 (1985), which it takes to indicate
that the Tenth Amendment covers only "the original powers
of [state] sovereignty." Ante, at 802. But Garcia dealt
with an entirely different issue: the extent to which principles of state sovereignty implicit in our federal system curtail Congress' authority to exercise its enumerated powers.
When we are asked to decide whether a congressional statute that appears to have been authorized by Article I is
nonetheless unconstitutional because it invades a protected
sphere of state sovereignty, it may well be appropriate for us
to inquire into what we have called the "traditional aspects
of state sovereignty." See National League of Cities v.
Usery, 426 U. S. 833, 841, 849 (1976); see also New York v.
United States, 505 U. S. 144, 156-157 (1992). The question

raised by the present case, however, is not whether any prin-ciple of state sovereignty implicit in the Tenth Amendment

bars congressional action that Article I appears to authorize,but rather whether Article I bars state action that it does
not appear to forbid. The principle necessary to answer thisquestion is express on the Tenth Amendment's face: Unless
the Federal Constitution affirmatively prohibits an action bythe States or the people, it raises no bar to such action.

The majority also seeks support for its view of the TenthAmendment in

McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819).See ante, at 802. But this effort is misplaced. McCulloch

did make clear that a power need not be "expressly" dele-gated to the United States or prohibited to the States in
order to fall outside the Tenth Amendment's reservation;delegations and prohibitions can also arise by necessary implication.4 True to the text of the Tenth Amendment, how-ever, McCulloch indicated that all powers as to which the
Constitution does not speak (whether expressly or by neces-sary implication) are "reserved" to the state level. Thus,
in its only discussion of the Tenth Amendment, McCullochobserved that the Amendment "leav[es] the question,
whether the particular power which may become the subjectof contest has been delegated to the one government, or prohibited to the other, to depend on a fair construction of thewhole [Constitution]." 4 Wheat., at 406.

McCulloch didnot qualify this observation by indicating that the question

also turned on whether the States had enjoyed the powerbefore the framing. To the contrary,

McCulloch seemed toassume that the people had "conferred on the general government the power contained in the constitution, and on theStates the whole residuum of power." Id., at 410.

The structure of McCulloch's analysis also refutes themajority's position. The question before the Court was

whether the State of Maryland could tax the Bank of the
United States, which Congress had created in an effort to
accomplish objects entrusted to it by the Constitution.
Chief Justice Marshall's opinion began by upholding the
federal statute incorporating the bank. Id., at 400-425.
It then held that the Constitution affirmatively prohibited
Maryland's tax on the bank created by this statute. Id., at
425-437. The Court relied principally on concepts that it
deemed inherent in the Supremacy Clause of Article VI,
which declares that "[t]his Constitution, and the Laws of the
United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof, . . .
shall be the supreme Law of the Land . . . ." In the Court's
view, when a power has been "delegated to the United States
by the Constitution," Amdt. 10, the Supremacy Clause forbids a State to "retard, impede, burden, or in any manner
control, the operations of the constitutional laws enacted by
Congress to carry [that power] into execution." McCulloch,
4 Wheat., at 436. Thus, the Court concluded that the very
nature of state taxation on the bank's operations was "incompatible with, and repugnant to," the federal statute creating
the bank. See id., at 425.

For the past 175 years, McCulloch has been understood to
rest on the proposition that the Constitution affirmatively
barred Maryland from imposing its tax on the Bank's operations. See, e. g., Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat.
738, 859-868 (1824) (reaffirming McCulloch's conclusion that
by operation of the Supremacy Clause, the federal statute
incorporating the bank impliedly pre-empted state laws attempting to tax the bank's operations); Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 746 (1981) (citing McCulloch for the proposition that the Supremacy Clause deprives the States of the
power to pass laws that conflict with federal statutes); see
also North Dakota v. United States, 495 U. S. 423, 434 (1990)
(plurality opinion) (citing McCulloch for the proposition that
state laws may violate the Supremacy Clause when they

it").5 For the majority, however, McCulloch apparentlyturned on the fact that before the Constitution was adopted,

the States had possessed no power to tax the instrumentali-ties of the governmental institutions that the Constitution
created. This understanding of McCulloch makes most ofChief Justice Marshall's opinion irrelevant; according to the
majority, there was no need to inquire into whether federallaw deprived Maryland of the power in question, because the
power could not fall into the category of "reserved" powersanyway.

6

5 Though cited by the majority, see ante, at 802, Crandall v. Nevada, 6
Wall. 35 (1868), did not deviate from this accepted view of McCulloch.
See Crandall, supra, at 48 (observing that McCulloch and a number
of other cases "distinctly placed the invalidity of the State taxes on
the ground that they interfered with an authority of the Federal
government").

6 To support its decision to attribute such surplusage to McCulloch, the

majority quotes Marshall's observation that his opinion " `does not deprive
the States of any resources which they originally possessed,' " because the
power to tax federal instrumentalities was not encompassed by the States'
" `original right to tax.' " Ante, at 802 (quoting McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at
436, 430). In part, Marshall was simply refuting counsel's argument that
it would constitute an "overwhelming invasion of State sovereignty" for
Congress to establish a bank that operated within a State but that nonetheless was exempt from state taxes. See id., at 337-339 (argument of
counsel) (stressing that "the right to raise revenue" is "the highest attribute of sovereignty" and indeed amounts to "the right to exist"). While
Marshall acknowledged that "this original right of taxation" was an "essential" attribute of state sovereignty that Congress could not constitutionally control or invade, he focused more precisely than counsel on "the
nature and extent of this original right," id., at 428, and concluded that it
did not include the right "to tax the means employed by the government
of the Union, for the execution of its powers." Id., at 430. In this respect, then, the Court was referring to the States' "original" powers in
much the same context as Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit
Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985): The Court was examining whether Congress' exercise of the "privilege of exempting its own measures from State
taxation," McCulloch, supra, at 434, had invaded a protected sphere of
state sovereignty.

Marshall did go on to argue that the power to tax the operations of the
Bank of the United States simply was not susceptible to control by the

Despite the majority's citation of Garcia and McCulloch,the only true support for its view of the Tenth Amendment

comes from Joseph Story's 1833 treatise on constitutionallaw. See 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of
the United States $$ 623-628. Justice Story was a brilliant
and accomplished man, and one cannot casually dismiss hisviews. On the other hand, he was not a member of the

Founding generation, and his Commentaries on the Constitu-tion were written a half century after the framing. Rather
than representing the original understanding of the Consti-tution, they represent only his own understanding. In a
range of cases concerning the federal/state relation, more-over, this Court has deemed positions taken in Story's commentaries to be more nationalist than the Constitution warrants. Compare, e. g., id., $$ 1063-1069 (arguing that theCommerce Clause deprives the States of the power to regulate any commerce within Congress' reach), with Cooley v.
Board of Wardens of Port of Philadelphia ex rel. Soc. for
Relief of Distressed Pilots, 12 How. 299 (1852) (holding thatCongress' Commerce Clause powers are not exclusive). See

also 1 Life and Letters of Joseph Story 296 (W. Story ed.1851) (extract of manuscript written by Story) ("I hold it to
be a maxim, which should never be lost sight of by a great
statesman, that the Government of the United States is

people of a single State. See 4 Wheat., at 430. But that theory is perfectly consistent with my position. Marshall reasoned that the people of
a single State may not tax the instrumentalities employed by the people
of all the States through the National Government, because such taxation
would effectively subject the people of the several States to the taxing
power of a single State. See id., at 428. This sort of argument proves
that the people of a single State may not prescribe qualifications for the
President of the United States; the selection of the President, like the
operation of the Bank of the United States, is not up to the people of any
single State. See infra, at 862. It does not follow, however, that the
people of a single State may not prescribe qualifications for their own
representatives in Congress.

intrinsically too weak, and the powers of the State Govern-ments too strong"). In this case too, Story's position that

the only powers reserved to the States are those that theStates enjoyed before the framing conflicts with both the
plain language of the Tenth Amendment and the underlyingtheory of the Constitution.

2
The majority also sketches out what may be an alternative(and narrower) argument. Again citing Story, the majority

suggests that it would be inconsistent with the notion of "na-tional sovereignty" for the States or the people of the States
to have any reserved powers over the selection of Membersof Congress. See ante, at 803, 805. The majority apparently reaches this conclusion in two steps. First, it as-serts that because Congress as a whole is an institution of
the National Government, the individual Members of Con-gress "owe primary allegiance not to the people of a State,
but to the people of the Nation." See ante, at 803. Second,it concludes that because each Member of Congress has a
nationwide constituency once he takes office, it would beinconsistent with the Framers' scheme to let a single State
prescribe qualifications for him. See ante, at 803-804,837-838.

Political scientists can debate about who commands the"primary allegiance" of Members of Congress once they
reach Washington. From the framing to the present, how-ever, the

selection of the Representatives and Senators from
each State has been left entirely to the people of that Stateor to their state legislature. See Art. I, $ 2, cl. 1 (providing

that Members of the House of Representatives are chosen
"by the People of the several States"); Art. I, $ 3, cl. 1 (origi-nally providing that the Senators from each State are "chosen by the Legislature thereof "); Amdt. 17 (amending $ 3 toprovide that the Senators from each State are "elected by
the people thereof "). The very name "congress" suggests a

coming together of representatives from distinct entities.7In keeping with the complexity of our federal system, once

the representatives chosen by the people of each State as-semble in Congress, they form a national body and are beyond the control of the individual States until the next election. But the selection of representatives in Congress isindisputably an act of the people of each State, not some

abstract people of the Nation as a whole.The concurring opinion suggests that this cannot be so,
because it is the Federal Constitution that guarantees theright of the people of each State (so long as they are qualified
electors under state law) to take part in choosing the Mem-bers of Congress from that State. See

ante, at 842. But
the presence of a federally guaranteed right hardly means
that the selection of those representatives constitutes "theexercise of federal authority." See

ante, at 841. When the
people of Georgia pick their representatives in Congress,they are acting as the people of Georgia, not as the corporate

agents for the undifferentiated people of the Nation as awhole. See

In re Green, 134 U. S. 377, 379 (1890) ("Although
[Presidential] electors are appointed and act under and pur-suant to the Constitution of the United States, they are no

more officers or agents of the United States than are the

tional Government and its citizens, the selection of legislative representatives." See ante, at 842. But when one
strips away its abstractions, the concurring opinion is simply
saying that the people of Arkansas cannot be permitted to
inject themselves into the process by which they themselves
select Arkansas' representatives in Congress.

The concurring opinion attempts to defend this surprising
proposition by pointing out that Americans are "citizens of
the United States" as well as "of the State wherein they
reside," Amdt. 14, $ 1, and that national citizenship (particularly after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment)
"has privileges and immunities protected from state abridgment by the force of the Constitution itself," ante, at 842.
These facts are indeed "beyond dispute," ante, at 844, but
they do not contradict anything that I have said. Although
the United States obviously is a Nation, and although it obviously has citizens, the Constitution does not call for Members
of Congress to be elected by the undifferentiated national
citizenry; indeed, it does not recognize any mechanism at all
(such as a national referendum) for action by the undifferentiated people of the Nation as a whole. See supra, at 848-
849. Even at the level of national politics, then, there always remains a meaningful distinction between someone
who is a citizen of the United States and of Georgia and
someone who is a citizen of the United States and of Massachusetts. The Georgia citizen who is unaware of this distinction will have it pointed out to him as soon as he tries to
vote in a Massachusetts congressional election.

In short, while the majority is correct that the Framers
expected the selection process to create a "direct link" between Members of the House of Representatives and the
people, ante, at 803, the link was between the Representatives from each State and the people of that State; the people
of Georgia have no say over whom the people of Massachusetts select to represent them in Congress. This arrange514us3$60N 06-15-98 09:38:31 PAGES OPINPGT

ment must baffle the majority,8 whose understanding of Con-gress would surely fit more comfortably within a system of

nationwide elections. But the fact remains that when itcomes to the selection of Members of Congress, the people of
each State have retained their independent political identity.As a result, there is absolutely nothing strange about the
notion that the people of the States or their state legislaturespossess "reserved" powers in this area.

The majority seeks support from the Constitution's speci-fication that Members of Congress "shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paidout of the Treasury of the United States." Art. I, $ 6, cl. 1;
see ante, at 804. But the fact that Members of Congressdraw a federal salary once they have assembled hardly
means that the people of the States lack reserved powersover the selection of their representatives. Indeed, the historical evidence about the compensation provision suggeststhat the States' reserved powers may even extend beyond
the selection stage. The majority itself indicates that if theConstitution had made no provision for congressional compensation, this topic would have been "left to state legisla-tures."

work in this way, because each House of Congress has the power to judge
its Members' qualifications. See ante, at 804 (citing Art. I, $ 5, cl. 1). But
the power to act as "Judge" under Art. I, $ 5, is merely the power to
apply pre-existing qualifications to which the people of each State have
consented. See Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S. 486 (1969). Whether or
not $ 5 directs each House to judge state-law disqualifications as well as
those contained in the Constitution, see infra, at 895, it is clear that
neither House may exclude a representative from Massachusetts for failure to meet a qualification that the people of Massachusetts have not
accepted.

enjoyed the reserved power to supplement the federal
salary. 3 id., at 315 (remarks at the Virginia ratifying
convention).

As for the fact that a State has no reserved power to establish qualifications for the office of President, see ante, at
803-804, it surely need not follow that a State has no reserved power to establish qualifications for the Members of
Congress who represent the people of that State. Because
powers are reserved to the States "respectively," it is clear
that no State may legislate for another State: Even though
the Arkansas Legislature enjoys the reserved power to pass
a minimum-wage law for Arkansas, it has no power to pass
a minimum-wage law for Vermont. For the same reason,
Arkansas may not decree that only Arkansas citizens are eligible to be President of the United States; the selection of
the President is not up to Arkansas alone, and Arkansas can
no more prescribe the qualifications for that office than it can
set the qualifications for Members of Congress from Florida.
But none of this suggests that Arkansas cannot set qualifications for Members of Congress from Arkansas.

In fact, the Constitution's treatment of Presidential elections actively contradicts the majority's position. While the
individual States have no "reserved" power to set qualifications for the office of President, we have long understood
that they do have the power (as far as the Federal Constitution is concerned) to set qualifications for their Presidential
electors--the delegates that each State selects to represent
it in the electoral college that actually chooses the Nation's
chief executive. Even respondents do not dispute that the
States may establish qualifications for their delegates to the
electoral college, as long as those qualifications pass muster
under other constitutional provisions (primarily the First
and Fourteenth Amendments). See Williams v. Rhodes,
393 U. S. 23, 29 (1968); McPherson v. Blacker, 146 U. S. 1,
27-36 (1892). As the majority cannot argue that the Consti514us3$60N 06-15-98 09:38:31 PAGES OPINPGT

tution affirmatively grants this power,9 the power must beone that is "reserved" to the States. It necessarily follows

that the majority's understanding of the Tenth Amendmentis incorrect, for the position of Presidential elector surely
" `spring[s] out of the existence of the national government.' "See

ante, at 802. 3

In a final effort to deny that the people of the States enjoy"reserved" powers over the selection of their representatives
in Congress, the majority suggests that the Constitutionexpressly delegates to the States certain powers over congressional elections. See ante, at 805. Such delegationsof power, the majority argues, would be superfluous if the
people of the States enjoyed reserved powers in this area.Only one constitutional provision--the Times, Places and
Manner Clause of Article I, $ 4--even arguably supports themajority's suggestion. It reads:

"The Times, Places and Manner of holding Electionsfor Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in
each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congressmay at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations,
except as to the Places of chusing Senators."
Contrary to the majority's assumption, however, this Clausedoes not delegate any authority to the States. Instead, it

simply imposes a duty upon them. The majority gets it ex-actly right: By specifying that the state legislatures "shall"
prescribe the details necessary to hold congressional elec-tions, the Clause "expressly requires action by the States."

9 The only provision that might conceivably do so is Article II, $ 1, which
recognizes the authority of state legislatures to specify the "Manner" in
which a State appoints its Presidential electors. But if a qualifications
law is a "Manner" regulation for purposes of this Clause, then it is also a
"Manner" regulation for purposes of Article I, $ 4--which would mean that
the Constitution specifically recognizes the power of both the States and
the Congress to set qualifications for Senators and Representatives.

See ante, at 804. This command meshes with one of theprincipal purposes of Congress' "make or alter" power: to

ensure that the States hold congressional elections in thefirst place, so that Congress continues to exist. As one reporter summarized a speech made by John Jay at the NewYork ratifying convention:

"[E]very government was imperfect, unless it had apower of preserving itself. Suppose that, by design or
accident, the states should neglect to appoint representatives; certainly there should be some constitutionalremedy for this evil. The obvious meaning of the paragraph was, that, if this neglect should take place, Con-gress should have power, by law, to support the government, and prevent the dissolution of the Union. [Jay]believed this was the design of the federal Convention."
2 Elliot 326 (emphasis in original).10
Constitutional provisions that impose affirmative duties onthe States are hardly inconsistent with the notion of reserved powers.

10 Accord, e. g., 2 Elliot 24 (remarks of Caleb Strong at the Massachusetts
ratifying convention) ("[I]f the legislature of a state should refuse to make
such regulations, the consequence will be, that the representatives will
not be chosen, and the general government will be dissolved. In such
case, can gentlemen say that a power to remedy the evil is not necessary
to be lodged somewhere? And where can it be lodged but in Congress?");

subject to any checks, the States "could at any moment annihilate [the
Federal Government] by neglecting to provide for the choice of persons to
administer its affairs").

These statements about the Clause's purposes also help refute the

Of course, the second part of the Times, Places and MannerClause does grant a power rather than impose a duty. As

its contrasting uses of the words "shall" and "may" confirm,however, the Clause grants power exclusively to Congress,
not to the States. If the Clause did not exist at all, the
States would still be able to prescribe the times, places, andmanner of holding congressional elections; the deletion of the

provision would simply deprive Congress of the power tooverride these state regulations.

The majority also mentions Article II, $ 1, cl. 2: "EachState shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature
thereof may direct, a Number of [Presidential] Electors,equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives
to which the State may be entitled in the Congress . . . ."
But this Clause has nothing to do with congressional elec-tions, and in any event it, too, imposes an affirmative obligation on the States. In fact, some such barebones provisionwas essential in order to coordinate the creation of the electoral college. As mentioned above, moreover, it is uncon-tested that the States enjoy the reserved power to specify
qualifications for the Presidential electors who are chosenpursuant to this Clause. See

supra, at 861-862.
Respondent Thornton seeks to buttress the majority's
position with Article I, $ 2, cl. 1, which provides:

"The House of Representatives shall be composed ofMembers chosen every second Year by the People of the

several States, and the Electors in each State shall have
the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the mostnumerous Branch of the State Legislature."

According to respondent Thornton, this provision "grants
States authority to prescribe the qualifications of [voters]" in
congressional elections. Brief for Respondent Congressman

the power that the States would otherwise enjoy. Though
it does leave States with the ability to control who may vote

in congressional elections, it has the effect of restrictingtheir authority to establish special requirements that do not

apply in elections for the state legislature.Our case law interpreting the Clause affirmatively supports the view that the States enjoy reserved powers overcongressional elections. We have treated the Clause as a
one-way ratchet: While the requirements for voting in con-gressional elections cannot be more onerous than the requirements for voting in elections for the most numerousbranch of the state legislature, they can be less so. See
Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn., 479 U. S. 208, 225-229 (1986). If this interpretation of the Clause is correct, it
means that even with the Clause in place, States still havepartial freedom to set special voting requirements for congressional elections. As this power is not granted in ArticleI, it must be among the "reserved" powers.

II
I take it to be established, then, that the people of Arkan-sas do enjoy "reserved" powers over the selection of their

representatives in Congress. Purporting to exercise thosereserved powers, they have agreed among themselves that
the candidates covered by $ 3 of Amendment 73--thosewhom they have already elected to three or more terms in
the House of Representatives or to two or more terms in theSenate--should not be eligible to appear on the ballot for
reelection, but should nonetheless be returned to Congressif enough voters are sufficiently enthusiastic about their
candidacy to write in their names. Whatever one mightthink of the wisdom of this arrangement, we may not override the decision of the people of Arkansas unless somethingin the Federal Constitution deprives them of the power to
enact such measures.The majority settles on "the Qualifications Clauses" as the
constitutional provisions that Amendment 73 violates. Seeante, at 806. Because I do not read those provisions to im514us3$60N 06-15-98 09:38:31 PAGES OPINPGT

pose any unstated prohibitions on the States, it is unneces-sary for me to decide whether the majority is correct to identify Arkansas' ballot-access restriction with laws fixing trueterm limits or otherwise prescribing "qualifications" for congressional office. As I discuss in Part A below, the Qualifications Clauses are merely straightforward recitations of theminimum eligibility requirements that the Framers thought

it essential for every Member of Congress to meet. Theyrestrict state power only in that they prevent the States
from abolishing all eligibility requirements for membershipin Congress.

Because the text of the Qualifications Clauses does not
support its position, the majority turns instead to its vision
of the democratic principles that animated the Framers.
But the majority's analysis goes to a question that is not
before us: whether Congress has the power to prescribe
qualifications for its own members. As I discuss in Part B,
the democratic principles that contributed to the Framers'
decision to withhold this power from Congress do not prove
that the Framers also deprived the people of the States of
their reserved authority to set eligibility requirements for
their own representatives.

In Part C, I review the majority's more specific historical
evidence. To the extent that they bear on this case, the records of the Philadelphia Convention affirmatively support
my unwillingness to find hidden meaning in the Qualifications Clauses, while the surviving records from the ratification debates help neither side. As for the postratification
period, five States supplemented the constitutional disqualifications in their very first election laws. The historical evidence thus refutes any notion that the Qualifications Clauses
were generally understood to be exclusive. Yet the majority must establish just such an understanding in order to
justify its position that the Clauses impose unstated prohibitions on the States and the people. In my view, the historical evidence is simply inadequate to warrant the majority's

conclusion that the Qualifications Clauses mean anythingmore than what they say.

A
The provisions that are generally known as the Qualifica-tions Clauses read as follows:

"No Person shall be a Representative who shall nothave attained to the age of twenty five Years, and been
seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and whoshall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State
in which he shall be chosen." Art. I, $ 2, cl. 2."No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Yearsa Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when
elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shallbe chosen." Art. I, $ 3, cl. 3.

Later in Article I, the "Ineligibility Clause" imposes anothernationwide disqualification from congressional office: "[N]o
Person holding any Office under the United States, shall bea Member of either House during his Continuance in Office."

$ 6, cl. 2.The majority is quite correct that the "negative phrasing"
of these Clauses has little relevance. See ante, at 792,n. 8. The Qualifications Clauses would mean the same thing
had they been enacted in the form that the Philadelphia Con-vention referred them to the Committee of Style:

"Every Member of the House of Representatives shallbe of the age of twenty-five years at least; shall have
been a citizen of the United States for at least sevenyears before his election; and shall be, at the time of his
election, an inhabitant of the State in which he shall bechosen." 2 Farrand 565.

See also id., at 567 (same phrasing for Senate QualificationsClause). But these different formulations--whether negative or affirmative--merely establish minimum qualifica514us3$60N 06-15-98 09:38:31 PAGES OPINPGT

Thomas, J., dissenting
tions. They are quite different from an exclusive formula-tion, such as the following:

"Every Person who shall have attained to the age oftwenty five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of
the United States, and who shall, when elected, be anInhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen,
shall be eligible to be a Representative."
At least on their face, then, the Qualifications Clauses
do nothing to prohibit the people of a State from estab-lishing additional eligibility requirements for their own

representatives.Joseph Story thought that such a prohibition was nonetheless implicit in the constitutional list of qualifications, be-cause "[f]rom the very nature of such a provision, the affirmation of these qualifications would seem to imply a negative
of all others." 1 Commentaries on the Constitution of theUnited States $ 624 (1833); see also

ante, at 793, n. 9. This
argument rests on the maxim expressio unius est exclusio
alterius. When the Framers decided which qualifications to
include in the Constitution, they also decided not to includeany other qualifications in the Constitution. In Story's view,

it would conflict with this latter decision for the people ofthe individual States to decide, as a matter of state law, that
they would like their own representatives in Congress to
meet additional eligibility requirements.To spell out the logic underlying this argument is to expose its weakness. Even if one were willing to ignore thedistinction between requirements enshrined in the Constitution and other requirements that the Framers were content
to leave within the reach of ordinary law, Story's application
of the expressio unius maxim takes no account of federalism.
At most, the specification of certain nationwide disqualifications in the Constitution implies the negation of other nationwide disqualifications; it does not imply that individual
States or their people are barred from adopting their own

disqualifications on a state-by-state basis. Thus, the onedelegate to the Philadelphia Convention who voiced anything

approaching Story's argument said only that a recital of quali-fications in the Constitution would imply that Congress lacked
any qualification-setting power. See 2 Farrand 123 (remarksof John Dickinson); cf.

ante, at 793, n. 9, and 815-816, n. 27.The Qualifications Clauses do prevent the individual

States from abolishing all eligibility requirements for Con-gress. This restriction on state power reflects the fact that
when the people of one State send immature, disloyal, orunknowledgeable representatives to Congress, they jeopardize not only their own interests but also the interests of thepeople of other States. Because Congress wields power
over all the States, the people of each State need some guar-antee that the legislators elected by the people of other
States will meet minimum standards of competence. The
Qualifications Clauses provide that guarantee: They list therequirements that the Framers considered essential to protect the competence of the National Legislature.11If the people of a State decide that they would like their
representatives to possess additional qualifications, however,they have done nothing to frustrate the policy behind the
Qualifications Clauses. Anyone who possesses all of theconstitutional qualifications, plus some qualifications required by state law, still has all of the federal qualifications.

11 Thus, the age requirement was intended to ensure that Members of
Congress were people of mature judgment and experience. See, e. g., 1
Farrand 375 (remarks of George Mason at the Philadelphia Convention); 3
id., at 147 (remarks of James McHenry before the Maryland House of Delegates). The citizenship requirement was intended both to ensure that
Members of Congress were familiar with the country and that they were
not unduly susceptible to foreign influence. See, e. g., 2 id., at 216 (remarks of George Mason). The inhabitancy requirement was intended to
produce a National Legislature whose Members, collectively, had a local
knowledge of all the States. See, e. g., The Federalist No. 56 (Madison).
The Ineligibility Clause was intended to guard against corruption. See,
e. g., 1 Farrand 381 (remarks of Alexander Hamilton).

Accordingly, the fact that the Constitution specifies certainqualifications that the Framers deemed necessary to protect

the competence of the National Legislature does not implythat it strips the people of the individual States of the power
to protect their own interests by adding other requirements
for their own representatives.The people of other States could legitimately complain if

the people of Arkansas decide, in a particular election, tosend a 6-year-old to Congress. But the Constitution gives
the people of other States no basis to complain if the peopleof Arkansas elect a freshman representative in preference to
a long-term incumbent. That being the case, it is hard to
see why the rights of the people of other States have been
violated when the people of Arkansas decide to enact a more
general disqualification of long-term incumbents. Such a
disqualification certainly is subject to scrutiny under other
constitutional provisions, such as the First and Fourteenth
Amendments. But as long as the candidate whom they send
to Congress meets the constitutional age, citizenship, and
inhabitancy requirements, the people of Arkansas have not
violated the Qualifications Clauses.

This conclusion is buttressed by our reluctance to read
constitutional provisions to preclude state power by negative
implication. The very structure of the Constitution counsels such hesitation. After all, $ 10 of Article I contains a
brief list of express prohibitions on the States. Cf. Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, 517-519 (1992)
(Stevens, J.) (applying the expressio unius maxim to conclude that Congress' inclusion of an express pre-emption
clause in a federal statute implies that state laws beyond the
reach of that clause are not pre-empted); Nevada v. Hall, 440
U. S. 410, 425 (1979) (Stevens, J.) (suggesting that in light
of the Tenth Amendment and the Constitution's express prohibitions on the States, "caution should be exercised before
concluding that unstated limitations on state power were intended by the Framers"). Many of the prohibitions listed in

Thomas, J., dissenting

$ 10, moreover, might have been thought to be implicit in
other constitutional provisions or in the very nature of our
federal system. Compare, e. g., Art. II, $ 2, cl. 2 ("[The President] shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent
of the Senate, to make Treaties"), and Art. I, $ 8, cl. 5 ("The
Congress shall have Power . . . [t]o coin Money"), with Art.
I, $ 10, cl. 1 ("No State shall enter into any Treaty" and "No
State shall . . . coin Money"); see also Art. VI, cl. 2 (explicitly
declaring that state law cannot override the Constitution).
The fact that the Framers nonetheless made these prohibitions express confirms that one should not lightly read provisions like the Qualifications Clauses as implicit deprivations
of state power. See generally Barron ex rel. Tiernan v.
Mayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243, 249 (1833).12

The majority responds that "a patchwork of state qualifications" would "undermin[e] the uniformity and the national
character that the Framers envisioned and sought to ensure." Ante, at 822. Yet the Framers thought it perfectly
consistent with the "national character" of Congress for the
Senators and Representatives from each State to be chosen
by the legislature or the people of that State. The majority
never explains why Congress' fundamental character permits this state-centered system, but nonetheless prohibits

12 The principle that the Constitution rests on the consent of the people
of the States points in the same direction. Both the process of selecting
delegates to the Philadelphia Convention and the ratification procedure
erected by Article VII were designed to let the States and the people of
the States protect their interests. Lest those protections be evaded, one
should not be quick to read the Qualifications Clauses as imposing unstated prohibitions that pre-empt all state qualifications laws. Cf. L.
Tribe, American Constitutional Law $ 6-25, p. 480 (2d ed. 1988) (arguing
that courts should hesitate to read federal statutes to pre-empt state law,
because "to give the state-displacing weight of federal law to mere congressional ambiguity would evade the very procedure for lawmaking on
which Garcia [v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S.
528 (1985)] relied to protect states' interests"); Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501
U. S. 452, 464 (1991) (applying this argument).

the people of the States and their state legislatures fromsetting any eligibility requirements for the candidates who

seek to represent them.As for the majority's related assertion that the Framers
intended qualification requirements to be uniform, this is aconclusion, not an argument. Indeed, it is a conclusion that
the Qualifications Clauses themselves contradict. At thetime of the framing, and for some years thereafter, the
Clauses' citizenship requirements incorporated laws thatvaried from State to State. Thus, the Qualifications Clauses
themselves made it possible that a person would be qualifiedto represent State

A in Congress even though a similarlysituated person would not be qualified to represent State

B.To understand this point requires some background. Before the Constitution was adopted, citizenship was controlledentirely by state law, and the different States established
different criteria. See J. Kettner, Development of AmericanCitizenship, 1608-1870, pp. 213-218 (1978). Even after the
Constitution gave Congress the power to "establish an uni-form Rule of Naturalization . . . throughout the United
States," Art. I, $ 8, cl. 4, Congress was under no obligationto do so, and the Framers surely expected state law to continue in full force unless and until Congress acted. Cf.
Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122, 196 (1819) (so inter-preting the other part of $ 8, cl. 4, which empowers Congress

to establish "uniform Laws on the subject of Bankrupt-cies").

13 Accordingly, the constitutional requirement that

13 Even when Congress enacted the first federal naturalization law in
1790, it left open the possibility that the individual States could establish
more lenient standards of their own for admitting people to citizenship.
While Hamilton had suggested that Congress' power to "establish an uniform Rule" logically precluded the States from deviating downward from
the rule that Congress established, see The Federalist No. 32, at 199, the
early cases on this question took the opposite view. See Collet v. Collet,
2 Dall. 294, 296 (CC Pa. 1792) (Wilson, Blair, and Peters, JJ.). States
therefore continued to enact naturalization laws of their own until 1795,

Members of Congress be United States citizens meant different things in different States. The very first contestedelection case in the House of Representatives, which involved the citizenship of a would-be Congressman from
South Carolina, illustrates this principle. As Representative James Madison told his colleagues, "I take it to be a
clear point, that we are to be guided, in our decision, by the
laws and constitution of South Carolina, so far as they can
guide us; and where the laws do not expressly guide us, we
must be guided by principles of a general nature . . . ."
Cases of Contested Elections in Congress 32 (M. Clarke
& D. Hall eds. 1834) (reporting proceedings from May 22,
1789).

Even after Congress chose to exercise its power to prescribe a uniform route to naturalization, the durational element of the citizenship requirement in the Qualifications
Clauses ensured that variances in state law would continue
to matter. Thus, in 1794 the Senate refused to seat Albert
Gallatin because, owing to the individual peculiarities of the
laws of the two relevant States, he had not been a citizen
for the required nine years. Id., at 859-862, 867 (reporting
proceedings from February 20 and 28, 1794).

Even if the Qualifications Clauses had not themselves incorporated nonuniform requirements, of course, there would
still be no basis for the assertion of the plurality below that
they mandate "uniformity in qualifications." See 316 Ark.
251, 265, 872 S. W. 2d 349, 356 (1994). The Clauses wholly
omit the exclusivity provision that, according to both the plurality below and today's majority, was their central focus.
In fact, neither the text nor the apparent purpose of the
Qualifications Clauses does anything to refute Thomas Jefferson's elegant legal analysis:

when Congress passed an exclusive naturalization law. See J. Kettner,
Development of American Citizenship, 1608-1870, pp. 242-243 (1978).

"Had the Constitution been silent, nobody can doubt butthat the right to prescribe all the qualifications and disqualifications of those they would send to representthem, would have belonged to the State. So also the
Constitution might have prescribed the whole, and ex-cluded all others. It seems to have preferred the middle way. It has exercised the power in part, by declar-ing some disqualifications . . . . But it does not declare,
itself, that the member shall not be a lunatic, a pauper,a convict of treason, of murder, of felony, or other infamous crime, or a non-resident of his district; nor does itprohibit to the State the power of declaring these, or
any other disqualifications which its particular circum-stances may call for; and these may be different in different States. Of course, then, by the tenth amend-ment, the power is reserved to the State." Letter

while Jefferson cautioned against impugning the motives of people who

broad set of disqualifications for congressional office, and (2)the Framers did not want the Federal Congress to be able

to supplement the few disqualifications that the Constitutiondoes set forth. The logical conclusion is simply that the
Framers did not want the people of the States and their state
legislatures to be constrained by too many qualifications im-posed at the national level. The evidence does not support

the majority's more sweeping conclusion that the Framersintended to bar the people of the States and their state legislatures from adopting additional eligibility requirements tohelp narrow their own choices.

I agree with the majority that Congress has no power to
prescribe qualifications for its own Members. This fact,
however, does not show that the Qualifications Clauses contain a hidden exclusivity provision. The reason for Congress' incapacity is not that the Qualifications Clauses deprive Congress of the authority to set qualifications, but
rather that nothing in the Constitution grants Congress this
power. In the absence of such a grant, Congress may not
act. But deciding whether the Constitution denies the
qualification-setting power to the States and the people of
the States requires a fundamentally different legal analysis.

Despite the majority's claims to the contrary, see ante, at
796-797, n. 12, this explanation for Congress' incapacity to
supplement the Qualifications Clauses is perfectly consistent
with the reasoning of Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S. 486
(1969). Powell concerned the scope of Article I, $ 5, which
provides that "[e]ach House [of Congress] shall be the Judge
of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members." As the majority itself recognizes, "[t]he principal
issue [in Powell] was whether the power granted to each
House in Art. I, $ 5, . . . includes the power to impose qualifications other than those set forth in the text of the Constitution." Ante, at 788. Contrary to the majority's suggestion,
then, the critical question in Powell was whether $ 5 conferred a qualification-setting power--not whether the Quali514us3$60N 06-15-98 09:38:31 PAGES OPINPGT
876 U. S. TERM LIMITS, INC. v. THORNTON

Thomas, J., dissenting
fications Clauses took it away. Compare Powell, supra, at519 (describing the question before the Court as "what power

the Constitution confers upon the House through Art. I, $ 5"),and 536 (describing the Court's task as "determining the
meaning of Art. I, $ 5") with ante, at 789, and 792, n. 8 (sug-gesting that

Powell held that the Qualifications Clauses"limit the power of the House to impose additional qualifications"). See also Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 133 (1976)(taking my view of Powell).

Powell's analysis confirms this point. After summarizinga large quantity of historical material bearing on the original
understanding of what it meant for a legislature to act as"the Judge" of the qualifications of its members, see 395
U. S., at 521-531, Powell went on to stress that the Philadel-phia Convention specifically rejected proposals to grant Congress the power to pass laws prescribing additional qualifi-cations for its Members, and that the Convention rejected
these proposals on the very same day that it approved theprecursor of $ 5. See

id., at 533-536. Given this historicalevidence, the
Powell Court refused to read $ 5 as empower-ing the House to prescribe such additional qualifications in

its capacity as "Judge." And if nothing in the Constitutiongave the House this power, it inevitably followed that the
House could not exercise it. Despite the majority's claims,then, Powell itself rested on the proposition that the institutions of the Federal Government enjoy only the powers thatare granted to them. See also

ante, at 793, n. 9 (describingthe Qualifications Clauses merely as an independent basis for

the result reached in Powell).15

15 The majority also errs in its interpretation of Nixon v. United States,
506 U. S. 224 (1993). See ante, at 796, n. 12. In dictum, Nixon did refer
to "the fixed meaning of `[q]ualifications' set forth in Art. I, $ 2." 506
U. S., at 237. But as both the surrounding context and the internal punctuation of this passage make clear, Nixon was referring to the meaning of
the word "Qualifications" in $ 5; that term, after all, does not even appear
in the House Qualifications Clause of $ 2. Thus, Nixon merely said that

$ 5 directs the House to judge the qualifications "set forth in Art. I, $ 2,"
and not qualifications of its own invention. See also infra, at 895. There

The fact that the Framers did not grant a qualification-setting power to Congress does not imply that they wanted

to bar its exercise at the state level. One reason why theFramers decided not to let Congress prescribe the qualifications of its own Members was that incumbents could haveused this power to perpetuate themselves or their ilk in office. As Madison pointed out at the Philadelphia Conven-tion, Members of Congress would have an obvious conflict of
interest if they could determine who may run against them.2 Farrand 250; see also

ante, at 793-794, n. 10. But neitherthe people of the States nor the state legislatures would

labor under the same conflict of interest when prescribingqualifications for Members of Congress, and so the Framers
would have had to use a different calculus in determiningwhether to deprive them of this power.

As the majority argues, democratic principles also contrib-uted to the Framers' decision to withhold the qualificationsetting power from Congress. But the majority is wrong tosuggest that the same principles must also have led the
Framers to deny this power to the people of the States andthe state legislatures. In particular, it simply is not true
that "the source of the qualification is of little moment inassessing the qualification's restrictive impact." Ante, at
820. There is a world of difference between a self-imposedconstraint and a constraint imposed from above.

Congressional power over qualifications would have en-abled the representatives from some States, acting collectively in the National Legislature, to prevent the people ofanother State from electing their preferred candidates. The
John Wilkes episode in 18th-century England illustrates theproblems that might result. As the majority mentions,
Wilkes' district repeatedly elected him to the House of Com-mons, only to have a majority of the representatives of other

would have been no occasion for Nixon to extend Powell: The only point
of its discussion was to explain why the question at issue in Powell was
justiciable, while the question at issue in Nixon (which concerned impeachment) was not.

districts frustrate their will by voting to exclude him. Seeante, at 790. Americans who remembered these events

might well have wanted to prevent the National Legislaturefrom fettering the choices of the people of any individual
State (for the House of Representatives) or their state legis-lators (for the Senate).

Yet this is simply to say that qualifications should not beset at the national level for offices whose occupants are selected at the state level. The majority never identifies thedemocratic principles that would have been violated if a
state legislature, in the days before the Constitution was
amended to provide for the direct election of Senators, had
imposed some limits of its own on the field of candidates thatit would consider for appointment.

16 Likewise, the majority

does not explain why democratic principles prohibit the people of a State from adopting additional eligibility require-ments to help narrow their choices among candidates seeking

to represent them in the House of Representatives. Indeed,
the invocation of democratic principles to invalidate Amend-ment 73 seems particularly difficult in the present case, because Amendment 73 remains fully within the control of thepeople of Arkansas. If they wanted to repeal it (despite the

Ark. Const., Amdt. 7.

The majority appears to believe that restrictions on eligi-bility for office are inherently undemocratic. But the Qualifications Clauses themselves prove that the Framers did notshare this view; eligibility requirements to which the people
of the States consent are perfectly consistent with the Fram16 Oregon, for instance, pioneered a system in which the state legislature

is in the uncomfortable position of suggesting that this system violated
"democratic principles."

ers' scheme. In fact, we have described "the authority ofthe people of the States to determine the qualifications of

their most important government officials" as "an authoritythat lies at the heart of representative government."

Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 463 (1991) (internal quotation
marks omitted) (refusing to read federal law to precludeStates from imposing a mandatory retirement age on state

judges who are subject to periodic retention elections).When the people of a State themselves decide to restrict the
field of candidates whom they are willing to send to Washing-ton as their representatives, they simply have not violated
the principle that "the people should choose whom they
please to govern them." See 2 Elliot 257 (remarks of Alexander Hamilton at the New York Convention).

At one point, the majority suggests that the principle identified by Hamilton encompasses not only the electorate's
right to choose, but also "the egalitarian concept that the
opportunity to be elected [is] open to all." See ante, at 794;
see also ante, at 819-820. To the extent that the second
idea has any content independent of the first, the majority
apparently would read the Qualifications Clauses to create a
personal right to be a candidate for Congress, and then to
set that right above the authority of the people of the States
to prescribe eligibility requirements for public office. But
we have never suggested that "the opportunity to be
elected" is open even to those whom the voters have decided
not to elect. On that rationale, a candidate might have a
right to appear on the ballot in the general election even
though he lost in the primary. But see Storer v. Brown, 415
U. S. 724, 726, n. 16 (1974); see also Bullock v. Carter, 405
U. S. 134, 142-143 (1972) (rejecting the proposition that there
is any fundamental right to be a candidate, separate and
apart from the electorate's right to vote). Thus, the majority ultimately concedes that its "egalitarian concept" derives
entirely from the electorate's right to choose. See ante, at
794, n. 11; see also ante, at 819 (deriving the "egalitarian

ideal" from the proposition that the Qualifications Clauses donot unduly " `fetter the judgment . . . of the people' " (quoting

The Federalist No. 57, at 351)). If the latter is not violated,then neither is the former.

In seeking ratification of the Constitution, James Madisondid assert that "[u]nder these reasonable limitations [set out
in the House Qualifications Clause], the door of this partof the federal government is open to merit of every
description . . . ." The Federalist No. 52, at 326. The ma-jority stresses this assertion, and others to the same effect,
in support of its "egalitarian concept." See ante, at 794,819-820, and n. 30. But there is no reason to interpret these
statements as anything more than claims that the Constitu-tion itself imposes relatively few disqualifications for congressional office.17 One should not lightly assume that Madi17 For instance, the majority quotes Noah Webster's observation that
under the Constitution, "the places of senators are wisely left open to all
persons of suitable age and merit, and who have been citizens of the
United States for nine years." See ante, at 820, n. 30 (citing "A Citizen
of America" (Oct. 17, 1787), in 1 Debate on the Constitution 129, 142 (B.
Bailyn ed. 1993) (hereinafter Bailyn)). But there is no reason to read
Webster as denying the power of state legislatures to pass resolutions
limiting the field of potential candidates that they would consider for appointment to the Senate. Indeed, it seems implausible that Webster
would have been invoking the majority's vision of "democratic principles"
in support of the constitutional provisions calling for Senators to be appointed by the various state legislatures rather than being elected directly
by the people of the States.

Similarly, the majority quotes a newspaper piece written by John Stevens, Jr., to the people of New York. See ante, at 819-820. But Stevens
gave the following explanation for his assertion that "[n]o man who has
real merit . . . need despair" under the system erected by the Constitution:
"He first distinguishes himself amongst his neighbours at township and
county meeting; he is next sent to the State Legislature. In this theatre
his abilities . . . are . . . displayed to the views of every man in the State:
from hence his ascent to a seat in Congress becomes easy and sure."

son and his colleagues, who were attempting to win supportat the state level for the new Constitution, were proclaiming

the inability of the people of the States or their state legisla-tures to prescribe any eligibility requirements for their own
Representatives or Senators. Instead, they were merely re-sponding to the charge that the Constitution was undemocratic and would lead to aristocracies in office. Cf. ante, at791 (referring to "the antifederalist charge that the new
Constitution favored the wealthy and well born"). Thestatement that the qualifications imposed in the Constitution
are not unduly restrictive hardly implies that the Consti-tution withdrew the power of the people of each State to
prescribe additional eligibility requirements for their ownRepresentatives if they so desired.

In fact, the authority to narrow the field of candidates inthis way may be part and parcel of the right to elect Members of Congress. That is, the right to choose may includethe right to winnow. See Hills, A Defense of State Constitutional Limits on Federal Congressional Terms, 53 U. Pitt.L. Rev. 97, 107-109 (1991).

To appreciate this point, it is useful to consider the Consti-tution as it existed before the Seventeenth Amendment was
adopted in 1913. The Framers' scheme called for the legis-lature of each State to choose the Senators from that State.
Art. I, $ 3, cl. 1. The majority offers no reason to believethat state legislatures could not adopt prospective rules to
guide themselves in carrying out this responsibility; not onlyis there no express language in the Constitution barring legislatures from passing laws to narrow their choices, but therealso is absolutely no basis for inferring such a prohibition.
Imagine the worst-case scenario: a state legislature, wishing
fications, I do not read Stevens to be saying that they were barred from
doing the same thing with respect to Congress. Without addressing
whether the people of the States may supplement the Qualifications
Clauses, Stevens was merely praising the Constitution for imposing few
such requirements of its own.

to punish one of the Senators from its State for his vote on
some bill, enacts a qualifications law that the Senator does
not satisfy. The Senator would still be able to serve out his
term; the Constitution provides for Senators to be chosen for
6-year terms, Art. I, $ 3, cl. 1, and a person who has been
seated in Congress can be removed only if two-thirds of the
Members of his House vote to expel him, $ 5, cl. 2. While
the Senator would be disqualified from seeking reappointment, under the Framers' Constitution the state legislature
already enjoyed unfettered discretion to deny him reappointment anyway. Instead of passing a qualifications law, the
legislature could simply have passed a resolution declaring
its intention to appoint someone else the next time around.
Thus, the legislature's power to adopt laws to narrow its own
choices added nothing to its general appointment power.

While it is easier to coordinate a majority of state legislators than to coordinate a majority of qualified voters, the
basic principle should be the same in both contexts. Just as
the state legislature enjoyed virtually unfettered discretion
over whom to appoint to the Senate under Art. I, $ 3, so
the qualified voters of the State enjoyed virtually unfettered
discretion over whom to elect to the House of Representatives under Art. I, $ 2. If there is no reason to believe that
the Framers' Constitution barred state legislatures from
adopting prospective rules to narrow their choices for Senator, then there is also no reason to believe that it barred the
people of the States from adopting prospective rules to narrow their choices for Representative. In addition, there
surely is no reason to believe that the Senate Qualifications
Clause suddenly acquired an exclusivity provision in 1913,
when the Seventeenth Amendment was adopted. Now that
the people of the States are charged with choosing both
Senators and Representatives, it follows that they may
adopt eligibility requirements for Senators as well as for
Representatives.

I would go further, for I see nothing in the Constitutionthat precludes the people of each State (if they so desire)

from authorizing their elected state legislators to prescribequalifications on their behalf. If the people of a State decide
that they do not trust their state legislature with this power,
they are free to amend their state constitution to withdrawit. This arrangement seems perfectly consistent with the

Framers' scheme. From the time of the framing until afterthe Civil War, for example, the Federal Constitution did not
bar state governments from abridging the freedom of speechor the freedom of the press, even when those freedoms were
being exercised in connection with congressional elections.
It was the state constitutions that determined whether state
governments could silence the supporters of disfavored
congressional candidates, just as it was the state constitutions that determined whether the States could persecute
people who held disfavored religious beliefs or could expropriate property without providing just compensation. It
would not be at all odd if the state constitutions also determined whether the state legislature could pass qualifications
statutes.

But one need not agree with me that the people of each
State may delegate their qualification-setting power in order
to uphold Arkansas' Amendment 73. Amendment 73 is not
the act of a state legislature; it is the act of the people of
Arkansas, adopted at a direct election and inserted into the
State Constitution. The majority never explains why giving effect to the people's decision would violate the "democratic principles" that undergird the Constitution. Instead,
the majority's discussion of democratic principles is directed
entirely to attacking eligibility requirements imposed on the
people of a State by an entity other than themselves.

The majority protests that any distinction between the
people of the States and the state legislatures is "untenable"
and "astonishing." See ante, at 809, n. 19. In the limited
area of congressional elections, however, the Framers them514us3$60N 06-15-98 09:38:32 PAGES OPINPGT

Thomas, J., dissenting
selves drew this distinction: They specifically provided forSenators to be chosen by the state legislatures and for Representatives to be chosen by the people. In the context ofcongressional elections, the Framers obviously saw a meaningful difference between direct action by the people of eachState and action by their state legislatures.

Thus, even if one believed that the Framers intended tobar state legislatures from adopting qualifications laws that
restrict the people's choices, it would not follow that the peo-ple themselves are precluded from agreeing upon eligibility
requirements to help narrow their own choices. To be sure,if the Qualifications Clauses were exclusive, they would bar
all additional qualifications, whether adopted by popular ini-tiative or by statute. But the majority simply assumes that
if state legislatures are barred from prescribing qualifica-tions, it must be because the Qualifications Clauses are exclusive. It would strain the text of the Constitution far lessto locate the bar in Article I, $ 2, and the Seventeenth
Amendment instead: One could plausibly maintain that quali-fication requirements imposed by state legislatures violate
the constitutional provisions entrusting the selection ofMembers of Congress to the people of the States, even while
one acknowledges that qualification requirements imposedby the people themselves are perfectly constitutional. The
majority never justifies its conclusion that "democratic prin-ciples" require it to reject even this intermediate position.

C
In addition to its arguments about democratic principles,the majority asserts that more specific historical evidence

supports its view that the Framers did not intend to permitsupplementation of the Qualifications Clauses. But when
one focuses on the distinction between congressional powerto add qualifications for congressional office and the power
of the people or their state legislatures to add such qualifica-tions, one realizes that this assertion has little basis.

In particular, the detail with which the majority recitesthe historical evidence set forth in Powell v. McCormack,

395 U. S. 486 (1969), should not obscure the fact that this evi-dence has no bearing on the question now before the Court.
As the majority ultimately concedes, see ante, at 792-793,796, 798, it does not establish "the Framers' intent that the
qualifications in the Constitution be fixed and exclusive,"
ante, at 790; it shows only that the Framers did not intendCongress to be able to enact qualifications laws.

18 If any18 For instance, the majority quotes at length from the debate that arose
in the Philadelphia Convention when the Committee of Detail proposed
the following clause: "The Legislature of the United States shall have
authority to establish such uniform qualifications of the members of each
House, with regard to property, as to the said Legislature shall seem expedient." See 2 Farrand 179, 248-251; ante, at 790-791. The defeat of this
proposal--like the defeat of Gouverneur Morris' motion to drop the words
"with regard to property" from the clause, so as to empower Congress to
enact qualifications of any sort--simply reflects the Framers' decision not
to grant Congress the power to supplement the constitutional qualifications. Considered out of context, some of James Madison's comments during the debate might be thought to go farther. See ibid. But the majority itself properly dispels this false impression. See ante, at 793, n. 10;
see also Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S., at 534.

Likewise, Powell drew support from Alexander Hamilton's comments in
The Federalist No. 60, which the majority also quotes. See ante, at 791.
But as the majority concedes, when Hamilton wrote that "[t]he qualifications of the persons who may choose or be chosen [for Congress] . . . are
defined and fixed in the Constitution, and are unalterable by the legislature," he was merely restating his prior observation that the power to set
qualifications "forms no part of the power to be conferred upon the national government." See The Federalist No. 60, at 371 (emphasis added).
Indeed, only if "the legislature" to which Hamilton was referring is Congress can one make sense of his remark that the qualifications of voters
as well as Congressmen are "fixed in the Constitution" and "unalterable
by the legislature." Hamilton surely knew that the States or the people
of the States control eligibility for the franchise. See Art. I, $ 2, cl. 1.

The majority does omit the context necessary to understand one aspect
of the historical evidence presented in Powell. The majority quotes Powell's observation that "on the eve of the Constitutional Convention, English
precedent stood for the proposition that `the law of the land had regulated

thing, the solidity of the evidence supporting Powell's viewthat Congress lacks the power to supplement the constitutional disqualifications merely highlights the weakness of themajority's evidence that the States and the people of the
States also lack this power. 1

To the extent that the records from the Philadelphia Con-vention itself shed light on this case, they tend to hurt the
majority's case. The only evidence that directly bears onthe question now before the Court comes from the Committee of Detail, a five-member body that the Conventioncharged with the crucial task of drafting a Constitution to
reflect the decisions that the Convention had reached duringits first two months of work. A document that Max Farrand
described as "[a]n early, perhaps the first, draft of the com-mittee's work" survived among the papers of George Mason.
1 Farrand xxiii, n. 36. The draft is in the handwriting of
the qualifications of members to serve in parliament' and those qualifications were `not occasional but fixed.' " 395 U. S., at 528 (quoting 16 Parliamentary History of England 589, 590 (1769)); see ante, at 790. The English rule seems of only marginal relevance: The pre-existing rule in
America--that States could add qualifications for their representatives in
Congress, see n. 3, supra, while Congress itself could not--is surely more
important. But in any event, Powell did not claim that the English rule
deemed parliamentary qualifications to be fixed in the country's (unwritten) constitution, beyond the reach of a properly enacted law. Instead,
qualifications were "fixed" rather than "occasional" only in the sense that
neither House of Parliament could "exclude members-elect for general
misconduct not within standing qualifications." Powell, 395 U. S., at 528.
The English rule, in other words, was simply that when sitting as the
judge of its members' qualifications, each House of Parliament could do no
more than administer the pre-existing laws that defined those qualifications, see id., at 529, for "one House of Parliament cannot create a disability unknown to the law." T. Plucknett, Taswell-Langmead's English Constitutional History 585 (11th ed. 1960); cf. INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919
(1983). This history was relevant to Powell (which dealt with the grounds
on which one House of Congress could exclude a Member-elect), but it is
not relevant to this case.

Edmund Randolph, the chairman of the Committee, withemendations in the hand of John Rutledge, another member

of the Committee. As Professor Farrand noted, "[e]ach itemin this document . . . is either checked off or crossed out,
showing that it was used in the preparation of subsequentdrafts." 2

id., at 137, n. 6; see also W. Meigs, The Growthof the Constitution in the Federal Convention of 1787,

pp. I-IX (1900) (providing a facsimile of the document).The document is an extensive outline of the Constitution.
Its treatment of the National Legislature is divided into twoparts, one for the "House of Delegates" and one for the Senate. The Qualifications Clause for the House of Delegatesoriginally read as follows: "The qualifications of a delegate
shall be the age of twenty five years at least. and citizenship:
and any person possessing these qualifications may beelected except [blank space]." Id., at II (emphasis added).

The drafter(s) of this language apparently contemplated thatthe Committee might want to insert some exceptions to the
exclusivity provision. But rather than simply deleting theword "except"--as it might have done if it had decided to
have no exceptions at all to the exclusivity provision--theCommittee deleted the exclusivity provision itself. In the
document that has come down to us, all the words after thecolon are crossed out.

have been deleted as superfluous. See ante, at 815-816,n. 27.

19 The majority also argues that in any event, the views of the members
of the Committee "tel[l] us little about the views of the Convention as a
whole." Ante, at 815, n. 27. But our task is simply to determine whether
at the time of the framing, the language of the Qualifications Clauses
would have been commonly understood to contain an exclusivity provision.
The surviving records suggest that the members of the Committee of Detail did not understand the final Qualifications Clauses to be exclusive, and
the majority offers no reason to think that their understanding of the
language was unusual for their time.

such language in the Senate Qualifications Clause. See 2Farrand 141. Thus, the draft appears to reflect a deliberate

judgment to distinguish between the House qualificationsand the Senate qualifications, and to make only the former
exclusive. If so, then the deletion of the exclusivity provi-sion indicates that the Committee expected neither list of
qualifications to be exclusive.The majority responds that the absence of any exclusivity
provision in the Committee's draft of the Senate Qualifica-tions Clause merely reflected the fact that "senators, unlike
Representatives, would not be chosen by popular election."
Ante, at 815, n. 27. I am perfectly prepared to accept thisexplanation: The drafter(s) may well have thought that state

legislatures should be prohibited from constricting the peo-ple's choices for the House of Representatives, but that no
exclusivity provision was necessary on the Senate side be-cause state legislatures would already have unfettered control over the appointment of Senators. To accept this expla-nation, however, is to acknowledge that the exclusivity
provision in the Committee's draft of the House Qualifica-tions Clause was not thought to be mere surplusage. It is
also to acknowledge that the Senate Qualifications Clause inthe Committee's draft--"the qualification of a senator shall
be the age of 25 years at least: citizenship in the unitedstates: and property to the amount of [blank space]," 2
Farrand 141--did not carry any implicit connotation ofexclusivity. In short, the majority's own explanation for
the difference between the two Qualifications Clauses inthe Committee's draft is fundamentally at odds with the
expressio unius argument on which the majority rests itsholding.

2
Unable to glean from the Philadelphia Convention any di-rect evidence that helps its position, the majority seeks signs

of the Framers' unstated intent in the Framers' commentsabout four other constitutional provisions. See ante, at 808-

811 (citing Art. I, $ 2, cl. 1; $ 4, cl. 1; $ 5, cl. 1; and $ 6, cl. 1).The majority infers from these provisions that the Framers

wanted "to minimize the possibility of state interferencewith federal elections."

Ante, at 808. But even if the majority's reading of its evidence were correct, the most that
one could infer is that the Framers did not want state legisla-tures to be able to prescribe qualifications that would narrow

the people's choices. See supra, at 883-888. Howeverwary the Framers might have been of permitting state legislatures to exercise such power, there is absolutely no reasonto believe that the Framers feared letting the people themselves exercise this power. Cf. The Federalist No. 52, at 326
(Madison) ("It cannot be feared that the people of the States
will alter this [electoral-qualification] part of their constitutions in such a manner as to abridge the rights secured to
them by the federal Constitution").

In any event, none of the provisions cited by the majority
is inconsistent with state power to add qualifications for congressional office. First, the majority cites the constitutional
requirement that congressional salaries be "ascertained by
Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States."
Art. I, $ 6, cl. 1. Like the Qualifications Clauses themselves,
however, the salary provision can be seen as simply another
means of protecting the competence of the National Legislature. As reflected in the majority's own evidence, see ante,
at 809-810; see also 1 Farrand 373 (remarks of James Madison), one of the recurring themes of the debate over this
provision was that if congressional compensation were left
up to the States, parsimonious States might reduce salaries
so low that only incapable people would be willing to serve
in Congress.

As the majority stresses, some delegates to the Philadelphia Convention did argue that leaving congressional compensation up to the various States would give Members of
Congress "an improper dependence" upon the States. Id.,
at 216 (remarks of James Madison); ante, at 809-810. These

Thomas, J., dissenting
delegates presumably did not want state legislatures to beable to tell the Members of Congress from their State, "Vote

against Bill A or we will slash your salary"; such a powerwould approximate a power of recall, which the Framers denied to the States when they specified the terms of Members
of Congress. The Framers may well have thought thatstate power over salary, like state power to recall, would be

inconsistent with the notion that Congress was a nationallegislature once it assembled. But state power over initial
eligibility requirements does not raise the same concerns: Itwas perfectly coherent for the Framers to leave selection
matters to the state level while providing for Members ofCongress to draw a federal salary once they took office.
Thus, the Compensation Clause seems wholly irrelevant; contrary to the majority's suggestion, see ante, at 811, n. 21, itdoes not address elections at all.

Second, the majority gives passing mention to theElector-Qualifications Clause of Article I, $ 2, which specifies
that in each State, the voters in House elections "shall havethe qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous
Branch of the State Legislature." But the records of thePhiladelphia Convention provide no evidence for the majority's assertion that the purpose of this Clause was "to prevent
discrimination against federal electors." See ante, at 808.20

20 The majority inaccurately reports James Madison's explanation of the
Elector-Qualifications Clause in The Federalist No. 52. Madison neither
mentioned nor addressed the consequences of "allowing States to differentiate between the qualifications for state and federal electors." See ante,
at 808. Instead, he addressed the problems that would have arisen if the
Constitution had assigned control over the qualifications of voters in
House elections to the state legislatures rather than to the people of each
State. It was such an arrangement that, in Madison's view, "would have
rendered too dependent on the State governments that branch of the federal government which ought to be dependent on the people alone." The
Federalist No. 52, at 326; cf. ante, at 808. The Elector-Qualifications
Clause avoided this problem because the various state constitutions con514us3$60N 06-15-98 09:38:32 PAGES OPINPGT

891Cite as: 514 U. S. 779 (1995)
Thomas, J., dissenting
In fact, the Clause may simply have been a natural concomi-tant of one of the Framers' most famous decisions. At the

Convention, there was considerable debate about whetherMembers of the House of Representatives should be selected
by the state legislatures or directly by the voters of each
State. Taken as a whole, the first Clause of Article I, $ 2--
including the elector-qualifications provision--implements
the Framers' decision. It specifies that the Representatives
from each State are to be chosen by the State's voters (that
is, the people eligible to participate in elections for the most
numerous branch of the state legislature).

Third, the majority emphasizes that under Article I, $ 5,
"[e]ach House [of Congress] shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members." See
ante, at 804, 811, 822. There was no recorded discussion of
this provision in the Philadelphia Convention, and it appears
simply to adopt the practice of England's Parliament. See
n. 18, supra. According to the majority, however, $ 5 implies

trolled who could vote in elections for the most numerous branch of the
state legislature, and no state government could alter these requirements
unless the people of the State (through the state constitution) decided to
let it do so. See The Federalist No. 52, at 326.

Though one obviously could uphold the action of the people of Arkansas
without reaching this issue, Madison's comments should not be read to
suggest that the Elector-Qualifications Clause bars the people of a State
from delegating their control over voter qualifications to the state legislature. The Clause itself refutes this reading; if a state constitution permits
the state legislature to set voter qualifications, and if eligibility for the
franchise in the State therefore turns on statutory rather than constitutional law, federal electors in the State still must meet the same qualifications as electors for the most numerous branch of the state legislature.
Madison could not possibly have disagreed with this understanding of the
Clause. Instead, he was simply explaining why, when it came to voter
qualifications for House elections, the Framers had not followed the model
of Article I, $ 3, cl. 1, and vested ultimate control with the state legislatures (regardless of what the people of a State might provide in their
state constitutions).

that the Framers could not have intended state law ever to"provide the standard for judging a Member's eligibility."

Ante, at 812.My conclusion that States may prescribe eligibility requirements for their Members of Congress does not necessarily mean that the term "Qualifications," as used in ArticleI, $ 5, includes such state-imposed requirements. One

surely could read the term simply to refer back to the re-quirements that the Framers had just listed in the Qualifications Clauses, and not to encompass whatever requirementsStates might add on their own. See

Nixon v. United States,
506 U. S. 224, 237 (1993) (dictum) (asserting that the context
of $ 5 demonstrates that "the word `[q]ualifications' . . . was
of a precise, limited nature" and referred only to the qualifications previously "set forth in Art. I, $ 2"). The Framers
had deemed the constitutional qualifications essential to protect the competence of Congress, and hence the national interest. It is quite plausible that the Framers would have
wanted each House to make sure that its Members possessed
these qualifications, but would have left it to the States to
enforce whatever qualifications were imposed at the state
level to protect state interests.

But even if this understanding of $ 5 is incorrect, I see
nothing odd in the notion that a House of Congress might
have to consider state law in judging the "Qualifications" of
its Members. In fact, $ 5 itself refutes the majority's argument. Because it generally is state law that determines
what is necessary to win an election and whether any particular ballot is valid, each House of Congress clearly must look
to state law in judging the "Elections" and "Returns" of its
Members. It would hardly be strange if each House had
to do precisely the same thing in judging "Qualifications."
Indeed, even on the majority's understanding of the Constitution, at the time of the framing all "Qualifications" questions that turned on issues of citizenship would have been
governed by state law. See supra, at 872-873.

More generally, there is no basis for the majority's asser-tion that the Framers would not have charged "federal tribunals" with the task of "judging . . . questions concerningrights which depend on state law." See

ante, at 812. Cases
involving questions of federal law hardly exhaust the categories of cases that the Framers authorized the federal courtsto decide. See Art. III, $ 2, cl. 1. The founding generation,

moreover, seemed to assign relatively little importance tothe constitutional grant of jurisdiction over "all Cases . . .
arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the UnitedStates, and Treaties made . . . under their Authority."

Ibid.
The First Congress never even implemented this jurisdictional grant at the trial level; it was not until 1875 that Congress "revolutionized the concept of the federal judiciary"
by giving federal courts broad jurisdiction over suits arising
under federal law. See P. Bator, D. Meltzer, P. Mishkin, &
D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the
Federal System 962 (3d ed. 1988). By contrast, the founding
generation thought it important to implement immediately
the constitutional grant of diversity jurisdiction, in which the
rules of decision generally come entirely from state law.
See Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 73, 78, 92; Erie R. Co. v.
Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, 77-80 (1938).

The fourth and final provision relied upon by the majority
is the Clause giving Congress the power to override state
regulations of "[t]he Times, Places and Manner of holding
[congressional] Elections." Art. I, $ 4, cl. 1. From the fact
that the Framers gave Congress the power to "make or
alter" these state rules of election procedure, the majority
infers that the Framers would also have wanted Congress
to enjoy override authority with respect to any matters of
substance that were left to the States. See ante, at 810-
811. As Congress enjoys no "make or alter" powers in this
area, the majority concludes that the Framers must not have
thought that state legislatures would be able to enact qualifications laws.

But the Framers provided for congressional override onlywhere they trusted Congress more than the States. Even

respondents acknowledge that "the primary reason" for the"make or alter" power was to enable Congress to ensure that
States held elections in the first place. See Tr. of Oral Arg.
51; see also supra, at 863, and n. 10. The Framers did trustCongress more than the States when it came to preserving

the Federal Government's own existence; to advance this in-terest, they had to give Congress the capacity to prescribe
both the date and the mechanics of congressional elections.As discussed above, however, the Framers trusted the States
more than Congress when it came to setting qualifications
for Members of Congress. See supra, at 877. Indeed, the
majority itself accepts this proposition. See ante, at 832
(acknowledging that the Framers were "particularly concerned" about congressional power to set qualifications).

To judge from comments made at the state ratifying conventions, Congress' "make or alter" power was designed to
serve a coordination function in addition to ensuring that the
States had at least rudimentary election laws. For instance,
George Nicholas argued at the Virginia Convention that if
regulation of the time of congressional elections had been
left exclusively to the States, "there might have been as
many times of choosing as there are States," and "such intervals might elapse between the first and last election, as to
prevent there being a sufficient number to form a House."
9 Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution 920 (J. Kaminski and G. Saladino eds. 1990). For this
reason too, if the National Legislature lacked the "make or
alter" power, "it might happen that there should be no Congress[,] . . . and this might happen at a time when the most
urgent business rendered their session necessary." Ibid.;
cf. 2 Elliot 535 (remarks of Thomas McKean at the Pennsylvania ratifying convention) (defending $ 4 on the ground that
congressional elections should be "held on the same
day throughout the United States, to prevent corruption or

undue influence"). Again, however, the desire to coordinatestate election procedures did not require giving Congress

power over qualifications laws.The structure of the Constitution also undermines the majority's suggestion that it would have been bizarre for the
Framers to give Congress supervisory authority over statetime, place, and manner regulations but not over state qualifications laws. Although the Constitution does set forth afew nationwide disqualifications for the office of Presidential
elector, see Art. II, $ 1, cl. 2 ("no Senator or Representative,or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the
United States, shall be appointed an Elector"), no one contends that these disqualifications implicitly prohibit the
States from adding any other eligibility requirements; instead, Article II leaves the States free to establish qualifications for their delegates to the electoral college. See supra,
at 861-862. Nothing in the Constitution, moreover, gives
Congress any say over the additional eligibility requirements
that the people of the States or their state legislatures may
choose to set. Yet under Article II, "[t]he Congress may
determine the Time of chusing the Electors . . . ." Art. II,

$ 1, cl. 4.

The majority thus creates an unwarranted divergence between Article I's provisions for the selection of Members of
Congress and Article II's provisions for the selection of
members of the electoral college. Properly understood, the
treatment of congressional elections in Article I parallels the
treatment of Presidential elections in Article II. Under Article I as under Article II, the States and the people of the
States do enjoy the reserved power to establish substantive
eligibility requirements for candidates, and Congress has no
power to override these requirements. But just as Article
II authorizes Congress to prescribe when the States must
select their Presidential electors, so Article I gives Congress
the ultimate authority over the times, places, and manner of
holding congressional elections.

The majority's only response is that my reading of theConstitution would permit States to use their qualificationsetting power to achieve the very result that Congress'"make or alter" power was designed to avoid. According to
the majority, States could set qualifications so high that no
candidate could meet them, and Congress would be power-less to do anything about it.

Ante, at 811.
Even if the majority were correct that Congress could notnullify impossible qualifications, however, the Constitution

itself proscribes such state laws. The majority surely wouldconcede that under the Framers' Constitution, each state legislature had an affirmative duty to appoint two people to the
Senate. See Art. I, $ 3, cl. 1 ("The Senate of the United
States shall be composed of two Senators from each State,
chosen by the Legislature thereof . . ." (emphasis added));
cf. Art. I, $ 3, cl. 2 ("if Vacancies happen by Resignation, or
otherwise, during the Recess of the Legislature of any State,
the Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments
until the next Meeting of the Legislature, which shall then
fill such Vacancies"). In exactly the same way that $ 3 requires the States to send people to the Senate, $ 2 also requires the States to send people to the House. See Art. I,

$ 2, cl. 1 ("The House of Representatives shall be composed
of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the
several States . . ."); cf. Art. I, $ 2, cl. 4 ("When vacancies
happen in the Representation from any State, the Executive
Authority thereof shall issue Writs of Election to fill such
Vacancies").

The majority apparently is concerned that (on its reading
of the "make or alter" power) Congress would not be able to
enforce the constitutional proscription on impossible qualifications; enforcement would instead be relegated to the
courts, the Executive Branch, or the political process. But
this concern is equally applicable whether one adopts my
view of the Qualifications Clauses or the majority's view.
Both the majority and I agree that it is unconstitutional for

States to establish impossible qualifications for congressionaloffice. Both the majority and I also agree that it is theoretically conceivable that a State might defy this proscriptionby erecting an impossible qualification. Whether Congress
may use its "make or alter" power to override such lawsturns entirely on how one reads the "make or alter" power;
it has nothing to do with whether one believes that the Quali-fications Clauses are exclusive.

It would not necessarily be unusual if the Framers haddecided against using Congress' "make or alter" power to
guard against state laws that disqualify everyone from serv-ice in the House. After all, although this power extended
to the times and manner of selecting Senators as well asRepresentatives, it did not authorize Congress to pick the
Senators from a State whose legislature defied its constitu-tional obligations and refused to appoint anyone. This does
not mean that the States had no duty to appoint Senators,or that the States retained the power to destroy the Federal
Government by the simple expedient of refusing to meet thisduty. It merely means that the Framers did not place the
remedy with Congress.21But the flaws in the majority's argument go deeper. Contrary to the majority's basic premise, Congress can nullifystate laws that establish impossible qualifications. If a
State actually holds an election and only afterwards pur-ports to disqualify the winner for failure to meet an impossible condition, Congress certainly would not be bound by thepurported disqualification. It is up to each House of Congress to judge the "[q]ualifications" of its Members for itself.See Art. I, $ 5, cl. 1. Even if this task includes the responsibility of judging qualifications imposed by state law, see
supra, at 892-893, Congress obviously would have not only

21 Likewise, the Constitution requires the States to appoint Presidential
electors, Art. II, $ 1, cl. 2, but it does not provide for any congressional
override if the States refuse to do so (or if the States set impossibly high
qualifications and then announce that no one meets them).

the power but the duty to treat the unconstitutional statelaw as a nullity. Thus, Congress could provide the appropriate remedy for the State's defiance, simply by seating thewinner of the election.

It follows that the situation feared by the majority wouldarise only if the State refused to hold an election in the first
place, on the ground that no candidate could meet the impos-sible qualification. But Congress unquestionably has the
power to override such a refusal. Under the plain terms of$ 4, Congress can make a regulation providing for the State
to hold a congressional election at a particular time andplace, and in a particular manner.

In discussing the ratification period, the majority stressestwo principal data. One of these pieces of evidence is no

evidence at all--literally. The majority devotes consider-able space to the fact that the recorded ratification debates
do not contain any affirmative statement that the States cansupplement the constitutional qualifications. See ante, at
812-815. For the majority, this void is "compelling" evi-dence that "unquestionably reflects the Framers' common
understanding that States lacked that power." Ante, at 812,814. The majority reasons that delegates at several of the
ratifying conventions attacked the Constitution for failing torequire Members of Congress to rotate out of office.

23 If

22 Even if there is anything left of the majority's argument on this point,
it would still have no bearing on whether the Framers intended to preclude the people of each State from supplementing the constitutional qualifications. Just as the Framers had no fear that the people of a State
would destroy congressional elections by entirely disenfranchising themselves, see The Federalist No. 52, at 326, so the Framers surely had no
fear that the people of the States would destroy congressional elections
by entirely disqualifying all candidates.

23 As the majority notes, see ante, at 837, and 812, n. 22, the Philadelphia

Convention had dropped without discussion a portion of the original Randolph Resolutions calling for Members of the House of Representatives

supporters of ratification had believed that the individual
States could supplement the constitutional qualifications, the
majority argues, they would have blunted these attacks by
pointing out that rotation requirements could still be added
State by State. See ante, at 814.

But the majority's argument cuts both ways. The recorded ratification debates also contain no affirmative statement that the States cannot supplement the constitutional
qualifications. While ratification was being debated, the existing rule in America was that the States could prescribe
eligibility requirements for their delegates to Congress, see
n. 3, supra, even though the Articles of Confederation gave
Congress itself no power to impose such qualifications. If

"to be incapable of re-election for the space of [blank space] after the
expiration of their term of service." 1 Farrand 20. This provision, which
at a minimum would have barred all Members of the House from serving
consecutive terms, was abandoned without objection when the Convention
voted to require House Members to stand for election every three years.
See id., at 214-217; see also id., at 362 (opting for 2-year terms instead).
Subsequently, indeed, some members of the Convention appeared to be
unaware that a rotation requirement had ever been proposed. See 2 id.,
at 120 (remarks of Gouverneur Morris).

The majority properly does not cite the omission of this nationwide rotation requirement as evidence that the Framers meant to preclude individual States from adopting rotation requirements of their own. Just as individual States could extend the vote to women before the adoption of the
Nineteenth Amendment, could prohibit poll taxes before the adoption of
the Twenty-fourth Amendment, and could lower the voting age before the
adoption of the Twenty-sixth Amendment, so the Framers' decision not to
impose a nationwide limit on congressional terms did not itself bar States
from adopting limits of their own. See, e. g., Ga. Const. of 1877, $ 2-602
(adopted Aug. 3, 1943) (reducing voting age to 18 nearly three decades
before the Twenty-sixth Amendment was proposed); Harman v. Forssenius, 380 U. S. 528, 539 (1965) (noting that by the time the Twenty-fourth
Amendment was proposed, "only five States retained the poll tax as a
voting requirement"); Congressional Research Service, The Constitution
of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation 1571 (1973)
(reporting that 11 States had adopted women's suffrage by the time the
Nineteenth Amendment was proposed). Cf. ante, at 837, and n. 50.

the Federal Constitution had been understood to deprive theStates of this significant power, one might well have expected its opponents to seize on this point in arguingagainst ratification.

The fact is that arguments based on the absence of recorded debate at the ratification conventions are suspect, be-cause the surviving records of those debates are fragmentary. We have no records at all of the debates in several ofthe conventions, 3 Documentary History of the Ratification
of the Constitution 7 (M. Jensen ed. 1978), and only spottyrecords from most of the others, see

ibid.; 1 id., at 34-35;
4 Elliot 342; Hutson, The Creation of the Constitution: The
Integrity of the Documentary Record, 65 Texas L. Rev. 1,
21-23 (1986).

If one concedes that the absence of relevant records from
the ratification debates is not strong evidence for either side,
then the majority's only significant piece of evidence from
the ratification period is The Federalist No. 52. Contrary to
the majority's assertion, however, this essay simply does not
talk about "the lack of state control over the qualifications
of the elected," whether "explicitly" or otherwise. See ante,
at 806.

It is true that The Federalist No. 52 contrasts the Constitution's treatment of the qualifications of voters in elections
for the House of Representatives with its treatment of the
qualifications of the Representatives themselves. As Madison noted, the Framers did not specify any uniform qualifications for the franchise in the Constitution; instead, they
simply incorporated each State's rules about eligibility to
vote in elections for the most numerous branch of the state
legislature. By contrast, Madison continued, the Framers
chose to impose some particular qualifications that all Members of the House had to satisfy. But while Madison did say
that the qualifications of the elected were "more susceptible
of uniformity" than the qualifications of electors, The Federalist No. 52, at 326, he did not say that the Constitution

prescribes anything but uniform minimum qualifications
for congressmen. That, after all, is more than it does for
congressional electors.

Nor do I see any reason to infer from The Federalist No.
52 that the Framers intended to deprive the States of the
power to add to these minimum qualifications. Madison did
note that the existing state constitutions defined the qualifications of "the elected"--a phrase that the essay used to
refer to Members of Congress--"less carefully and properly"
than they defined the qualifications of voters. But Madison
could not possibly have been rebuking the States for setting
unduly high qualifications for their representatives in Congress, because they actually had established only the sketchiest of qualifications. At the time that Madison wrote, the
various state constitutions generally provided for the state
legislature to appoint the State's delegates to the Federal
Congress.24 Four State Constitutions had added a termlimits provision that tracked the one in the Articles of Confederation,25 and some of the Constitutions also specified that
people who held certain salaried offices under the United
States were ineligible to represent the State in Congress.26

qualifications for delegates to Congress.27 In this context,when Madison wrote that the state constitutions defined the

qualifications of Members of Congress "less carefully andproperly" than they defined the qualifications of voters, he
could only have meant that the existing state qualificationsdid not do enough to safeguard Congress' competence: The
state constitutions had not adopted the age, citizenship, andinhabitancy requirements that the Framers considered essential. Madison's comments readily explain why the Fram-ers did not merely incorporate the state qualifications for
Congress. But they do not imply that the Framers intendedto withdraw from the States the power to supplement the
list of qualifications contained in the Federal Constitution.28Though The Federalist No. 52 did not address this question, one might wonder why the Qualifications Clauses didnot simply incorporate the existing qualifications for members of the state legislatures (as opposed to delegates to Con-gress). Again, however, the Framers' failure to do so cannot
be taken as an implicit criticism of the States for settingunduly high entrance barriers. To the contrary, the age and
citizenship qualifications set out in the Federal Constitutionare considerably higher than the corresponding qualifications
contained in the state constitutions that were then in force.At the time, no state constitution required members of the
lower house of the state legislature to be more than 21 yearsold, and only two required members of the upper house to
be 30. See N. H. Const. of 1784, Pt. II, in 4 Thorpe 2460;S. C. Const. of 1778, Art. XII, in 6 Thorpe 3250. Many

28 The majority suggests that I have overlooked Madison's observation

that subject to the "reasonable limitations" spelled out in the House Qualifications Clause, the Constitution left the House's door "open to merit of
every description." See ante, at 807-808, n. 18; see also ante, at 808 (quoting a similar passage from The Federalist No. 57). As discussed above,
however, such statements do not advance the majority's case. See supra,

States, moreover, permitted naturalized aliens to take seatsin the state legislature within one or two years of becoming

citizens. See Kettner, Development of American Citizen-ship, at 214-219.

The majority responds that at the time of the framing,most States imposed property qualifications on members of
the state legislature. See ante, at 807-808, n. 18. But thefact that the Framers did not believe that a uniform minimum property requirement was necessary to protect thecompetence of Congress surely need not mean that the
Framers intended to preclude States from setting their ownproperty qualifications.

In fact, the constitutional text supports the contrary infer-ence. As the majority observes, see ibid., and ante, at 825,
n. 35, at the time of the framing some States also imposedreligious qualifications on state legislators. The Framers
evidently did not want States to impose such qualificationson federal legislators, for the Constitution specifically provides that "no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qual-ification to any Office or public Trust under the United
States." Art. VI, cl. 3. Both the context 29 and the plainlanguage of the Clause show that it bars the States as well
as the Federal Government from imposing religious disquali-fications on federal offices. But the only reason for extending the Clause to the States would be to protect Senatorsand Representatives from state-imposed religious qualifications; I know of no one else who holds a "public Trust underthe United States" yet who might be subject to state disqualifications. If the expressio unius maxim cuts in any direc-tion in this case, then, it undermines the majority's position:
The Framers' prohibition on state-imposed religious disqual29 The immediately preceding portion of the Clause requires not only
"[t]he Senators and Representatives before mentioned" but also "the

More than a century ago, this Court was asked to invalidate a Michigan election law because it called for Presidential electors to be elected on a district-by-district basis
rather than being chosen by "the State" as a whole. See
Art. II, $ 1, cl. 2. Conceding that the Constitution might be
ambiguous on this score, the Court asserted that "where
there is ambiguity or doubt, or where two views may well
be entertained, contemporaneous and subsequent practical
construction[s] are entitled to the greatest weight." McPherson v. Blacker, 146 U. S., at 27. The Court then described the district-based selection processes used in 2 of the
10 States that participated in the first Presidential election
in 1788, 3 of the 15 States that participated in 1792, and 5 of
the 16 States that participated in 1796. Id., at 29-31.
Though acknowledging that in subsequent years "most of the
States adopted the general ticket system," id., at 32, the
Court nonetheless found this history "decisive" proof of the
constitutionality of the district method, id., at 36. Thus, the
Court resolved its doubts in favor of the state law, "the contemporaneous practical exposition of the Constitution being
too strong and obstinate to be shaken . . . ." Id., at 27.

Here, too, state practice immediately after the ratification
of the Constitution refutes the majority's suggestion that the
Qualifications Clauses were commonly understood as being
exclusive. Five States supplemented the constitutional disqualifications in their very first election laws, and the surviving records suggest that the legislatures of these States considered and rejected the interpretation of the Constitution
that the majority adopts today.

the Federal House of Representatives. See Virginia Elec-tion Law (Nov. 20, 1788), in 2 Documentary History of the

possible candidates to "freeholder[s]"). What is more, whilethe Constitution merely requires representatives to be inhabitants of their State, the legislatures of five of the sevenStates that divided themselves into districts for House elections 30 added that representatives also had to be inhabitantsof the district that elected them. Three of these States
adopted durational residency requirements too, insistingthat representatives have resided within their districts for
at least a year (or, in one case, three years) before beingelected.

30 Despite the majority's emphasis on the Framers' supposed desire for
uniformity in congressional elections, even the majority does not dispute
that the Framers wanted to let States decide for themselves whether to
use district elections in selecting Members of the House of Representatives. The Framers fully expected that in some States each Member of
the House would be chosen by the people of the whole State, while in other
States each Member would be directly accountable only to the people of
a single district. See, e. g., 14 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 3 (J. Boyd ed.

In Massachusetts, for instance, the legislature charged acommittee with drafting a report on election methods. The
fourth article of the resulting report called for the State tobe divided into eight districts that would each elect one representative, but did not require that the representatives beresidents of the districts that elected them. Joint Committee Report (Nov. 4, 1788), in 1 First Federal Elections 481.When the members of the State House of Representatives
discussed this report, those who proposed adding a districtresidency requirement were met with the claim that the Federal Constitution barred the legislature from specifying addi-tional qualifications. See Massachusetts Centinel (Nov. 8,
1788) (reporting proceedings), in 1 First Federal Elections489. After "considerable debate," the House approved the
committee's version of the fourth article by a vote of 89 to72.

Ibid. But the State Senate approved a district resi-dency amendment, 1 First Federal Elections 502, and the

House then voted to retain it, id., at 504.Although we have no record of the legislative debates over
Virginia's election law, a letter written by one of the mem-bers of the House of Delegates during the relevant period
indicates that in that State, too, the legislature consideredthe possible constitutional objection to additional disqualifications. In that letter, Edward Carrington (an opponent ofthe district residency requirement) expressed his view that
the requirement "may exceed the powers of the Assembly,"
been Tennessee residents for three years and district residents for one
year before their election. Act of Apr. 20, 1796, ch. 10, in Laws of the
State of Tennessee 81 (1803).

at least professed to "think it right." 2 id., at 367 (letterfrom Carrington to Madison, Nov. 9-10, 1788). Carrington
was correct about the views of his colleagues: By a vote of80 to 32, the House of Delegates rejected a motion to delete
the added qualifications, while a similar motion in the StateSenate lost by a vote of 12 to 3.

32 After the Virginia Legislature had enacted this bill, some of James
Madison's friends suggested that he might find it harder to win election in
his own district than in certain other areas of the State. They believed
that if Madison won the popular vote in one of those other districts, the
House of Representatives could seat him on the theory that States cannot
add to the constitutional qualifications. See 11 Papers of James Madison
378-379 (R. Rutland & C. Hobson eds. 1977) (letter from Carrington to
Madison, Dec. 2, 1788). Other advisers, however, warned that the people
of Virginia might not share this understanding of the Constitution. As
Alexander White wrote in a letter to Madison:

"Some Gentlemen suppose you may be elected in other Districts, and that
Congress would disregard the Act which requires Residence in a particular District. I will not undertake to decide that question, but this I know,
such a determination would afford much ground of clamour, and enable
the opposers of the Government to inflame the Minds of the People beyond
anything which has yet happened." Id., at 380 (Dec. 4, 1788).

Madison himself apparently never endorsed the idea that he should test
the district residency requirement. Instead, he ran from his own district
(where he overcame a stiff challenge from another future President,
James Monroe).

33 The records show that Maryland's House of Delegates put the district

residency requirement to a separate vote and approved it by a margin of
41 to 24. 2 First Federal Elections 129-130 (summarizing proceedings
from Dec. 3, 1788). A subsequent effort to jettison the requirement lost
by a vote of 39 to 28. Id., at 132-133 (summarizing proceedings from
Dec. 10, 1788). Language in Maryland's second election law confirms that

States that adopted district residency requirements, in fact,only in North Carolina were the records so poor that it is

impossible to draw any inferences about whether the legis-lature gave careful attention to the implications of the
requirement.34
the state legislature knew that it was supplementing the Qualifications
Clauses. The Act of December 10, 1790, stipulated that each candidate
must "b[e] a resident of his district at the time of the election, and hav[e]
resided therein twelve calendar months immediately before, and [be]
otherways qualified according to the constitution of the United States."
1790 Laws of Maryland, ch. XVI, art. VIII.

In Georgia, too, the State House of Assembly called special attention to
the district residency requirement. Shortly before Georgia held its first
federal elections, the House adopted a resolution to stress that if the top
votegetter in any district had not been "an actual resident of three years
standing" in that district, then "such person shall not be considered as
eligible nor shall he be commissioned." 2 First Federal Elections 459
(resolution of Feb. 4, 1789).

34 Even the experience in New York and South Carolina--the only

States that opted for district elections without requiring district residency--does not support the majority's position. While the records from
South Carolina are sketchy, those from New York affirmatively undermine
the majority's suggestion that the Qualifications Clauses were commonly
understood to be exclusive. When the topic was first broached in the
State Assembly, the assemblymen defeated a district residency proposal
amid comments that "to add any other qualification [to those listed in the
Constitution] would be unconstitutional." 3 First Federal Elections 232
(Dec. 18, 1788). But the State Senate took a different view, adding a
district residency requirement when it considered the election bill. Id.,
at 320. The Assembly then approved the requirement by a vote of 36 to
12, id., at 325-326 (Jan. 19, 1789), but reconsidered the requirement the
following day (apparently with more assemblymen in attendance). After
a sophisticated debate on the constitutional question, with some assemblymen arguing that the district residency requirement was unconstitutional
and others responding that the Constitution merely erected minimum
qualifications, the Assembly divided evenly over the requirement: 28 voted
in favor of it and 28 voted against it. Id., at 328-335 (Jan. 20, 1789). The
chairman broke the tie with a vote against the requirement. Id., at 335.
Still, there clearly was no consensus in the New York Assembly. What
is more, some of the votes against the district residency requirement may
well have been cast by assemblymen who simply opposed the requirement

The majority asserts that "state practice with respect toresidency requirements does not necessarily indicate that

States believed that they had a broad power to add restric-tions," because the States "may simply have viewed district
residency requirements as the necessary analog to state resi-dency requirements."

Ante, at 827, n. 41. This argumentfails even on its own terms. If the States had considered

district residency requirements necessary for the success ofa district election system, but had agreed with the majority
that the Constitution prohibited them from supplementingthe constitutional list of qualifications, then they simply
would have rejected the district system and used statewideelections. After all, the majority deems district residency
requirements just as unconstitutional as other added qualifi-cations. See

ante, at 799.The majority's argument also fails to account for the durational element of the residency requirements adopted inGeorgia, North Carolina, and Virginia (and soon thereafter
in Tennessee). These States obliged Congressmen not onlyto be district residents when elected but also to have been
district residents for at least a year before then. Seen. 31,

supra.Finally, the majority's argument cannot explain the election schemes of Maryland and Georgia. Though theseStates did divide themselves into congressional districts,
they allowed every voter to vote for one candidate from each
on policy grounds, as an undue restriction on the people's ability to elect
nonresidents if they wanted to do so. In any event, the New York Senate
obviously considered the requirement constitutional.

There is evidence that some members of the Pennsylvania Legislature
considered the Qualifications Clauses to be exclusive. See 1 id., at 282-
288. Of course, they also believed that $ 2 of Article I--which calls for
Members of the Federal House of Representatives to be "chosen . . . by
the People of the several States"--forbade Pennsylvania to elect its representatives by districts. See id., at 283. The legislatures of the five
States that adopted district residency requirements, who had the Pennsylvania example before them, disagreed with the Pennsylvania legislators.

district. See Georgia Election Law (Jan. 23, 1789), in 2First Federal Elections 456, 457; Maryland Election Law

(Dec. 22, 1788), in 2 First Federal Elections 136, 138. Inother words, Maryland and Georgia imposed district residency requirements despite permitting every voter in the
State to vote for every representative from the State. Nei-ther of these States could possibly have seen district residency requirements as the "necessary analog" to anything;they imposed these requirements solely for their own sake.

The majority nonetheless suggests that the initial electionlaws adopted by the States actually support its position because the States did not enact very many disqualifications.
See ante, at 826-827, n. 41. In this context, the majority
alludes to the fact that no State imposed a religious qualification on federal legislators, even though New Hampshire
continued to require state legislators to be Protestants and
North Carolina imposed a similar requirement on people
holding places of trust in the State's "civil department."
See ante, at 826-827, n. 41, and 825, n. 35. But the majority
concedes that "Article VI of the Federal Constitution . . .
prohibited States from imposing similar qualifications on federal legislators." Ante, at 825, n. 35. As discussed above,
the constitutional treatment of religious qualifications tends
to undermine rather than support the majority's case. See
supra, at 903-904.

The majority also points out that no State required its own
federal representatives to rotate out of office after serving
one or more terms. Ante, at 826. At the time of the framing, however, such requirements were increasingly disfavored on policy grounds. The advantages of incumbency
were substantially fewer then than now, and turnover in office was naturally quite high. The perceived advantages of
term limits were therefore smaller than they are today. But
the perceived disadvantages were just as great: Term limits
prevented the States or the people of the States from keeping good legislators in office, even if they wanted to do so.

See G. Wood, Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787,p. 439 (1969).

It is true that under the Articles of Confederation, fourStates had imposed term limits on their delegates to Congress. See ante, at 826. But three of these provisions
added nothing to the limits in the Articles themselves, seeMd. Const. of 1776, Form of Government, Art. XXVII (echoing Article of Confederation V), in 3 Thorpe 1695; N. H.Const. of 1784, Pt. II (same), in 4 Thorpe 2467; N. C. Const.
of 1776, Art. XXXVII (similar), in 5 Thorpe 2793, and theother one contained only a minor variation on the provision
in the Articles, see Pa. Const. of 1776, Frame of Government,

$ 11, in 5 Thorpe 3085. Indeed, though the majority says
that "many States imposed term limits on state officers,"
ante, at 825-826, it appears that at the time of the framing
only Pennsylvania imposed any restriction on the reelection
of members of the state legislature, and Pennsylvania deleted this restriction when it adopted a new Constitution in
1790. Compare Pa. Const. of 1776, Frame of Government,

$ 8, in 5 Thorpe 3084, with Pa. Const. of 1790, in 5 Thorpe
3092-3103; cf. Va. Const. of 1776, Form of Government (perhaps imposing term limits on members of the upper house of
the state legislature), in 7 Thorpe 3816. It seems likely,
then, that the failure of any State to impose term limits on its
senators and representatives simply reflected policy-based
decisions against such restrictions.

The majority counters that the delegates at three state
ratifying conventions--in Virginia, New York, and North
Carolina--"proposed amendments that would have required
rotation." Ante, at 813; cf. ante, at 826, and n. 40. But the
amendments proposed by both the North Carolina Convention and the Virginia Convention would have imposed term
limits only on the President, not on Members of Congress.
See 4 Elliot 245 (North Carolina) ("[N]o person shall be capable of being President of the United States for more than
eight years in any term of fifteen years"); 3 id., at 660

(Virginia) (similar). If the majority is correct that theseconventions also "voiced support for term limits for Members

of Congress," see ante, at 826,35 then the evidence from theseconventions supports my position rather than the majority's:
the conventions deemed it necessary for the Constitution itself to impose term limits on the President (because no State
could do that on its own), but they did not think it necessary
for the Constitution to impose term limits on Members of
Congress. This understanding at the Virginia and North
Carolina conventions meshes with the election laws adopted
by both States, which reflected the view that States could
supplement the Qualifications Clauses. See supra, at 905,
and n. 31, 909.36

35 The majority correctly notes that each convention, in addition to proposing a list of specific "Amendments to the Constitution," proposed a
"Declaration of Rights" to be appended to the Constitution. In both
States, this "Declaration" contained the general exhortation that members
of both the Legislative and Executive Branches "should, at fixed periods,
be reduced to a private station, return into the mass of the people, and
the vacancies be supplied by certain and regular elections." 4 Elliot 243;
3 id., at 657-658. But both Declarations went on to state that at these
elections, the previous occupants of the office in question should "be eligible or ineligible [for reelection], as the rules of the constitution of government and the laws shall direct." 4 id., at 243; 3 id., at 658. Accordingly,
it is hard to describe either Declaration as a "proposed . . . constitutional
amendment supporting term limits for Members of Congress." See ante,
at 826, n. 40.

36 As for New York, the State's ratifying convention did propose amending the Federal Constitution to provide "[t]hat no person be eligible as a
senator for more than six years in any term of twelve years." 1 Elliot
329-330. The majority finds it significant that when this suggestion fell
on deaf ears, New Yorkers did not amend their State Constitution to impose this restriction on their state legislature's appointment authority.
Before the Seventeenth Amendment was adopted, however, the Federal
Constitution vested the choice of Senators in the state legislatures rather
than the people. See Art. I, $ 3, cl. 1. At least without a delegation of
this authority from the legislature, cf. supra, at 878-882, and n. 16, the
people of New York may well have thought that they could no more amend

If the majority can draw no support from state treatmentof religious qualifications and rotation requirements, we are

left only with state treatment of property qualifications. Itis true that nine of the State Constitutions in effect at the
time of the framing required members of the lower house ofthe state legislature to possess some property, see

ante, at823-824, n. 33, and that four of these Constitutions were revised shortly after the framing but continued to impose suchrequirements, see ante, at 824-825, and n. 35. Only one
State, by contrast, established a property qualification forthe Federal House of Representatives. But the fact that
more States did not adopt congressional property qualifica-tions does not mean that the Qualifications Clauses were
commonly understood to be exclusive; there are a host ofother explanations for the relative liberality of state election
laws.37 And whatever the explanation, the fact remains that
the State Constitution to narrow the legislature's choices for Senator than
they could amend the State Constitution to take the appointment of Senators entirely away from the legislature. It obviously would not follow
that they doubted their ability to amend the State Constitution to impose
constraints on their own choice of Representatives. The ratifying convention's proposal thus sheds absolutely no light on whether New Yorkers
considered the Qualifications Clauses to be exclusive.

37 Property qualifications may simply have seemed unnecessary. For

instance, it surely was far more likely that a pauper would secure one of
the 202 seats in the South Carolina House of Representatives than that he
would secure one of South Carolina's five seats in the United States House
of Representatives. Compare S. C. Const. of 1778, Art. XIII, in 6 Thorpe
3251, with U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 2, cl. 3; cf. S. C. Const. of 1790, Art. I, $ 3
(providing for a 122-seat State House of Representatives), in 6 Thorpe
3258. It may be significant, then, that the one State that saw fit to enact
a congressional property qualification was also the State that had the
largest congressional delegation. See U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 2, cl. 3
(allocating 10 seats to Virginia). In addition, people of the day expected
that "[t]he representatives of each State [in the federal House] . . . will
probably in all cases have been members . . . of the State legislature."

five of the election laws enacted immediately after ratifica-tion of the Constitution imposed additional qualifications

that would clearly be unconstitutional under today's holding.This history of state practice--which is every bit as strong
as the history we deemed "decisive" in McPherson v.
Blacker, 146 U. S., at 36--refutes the majority's position thatthe Qualifications Clauses were generally understood to include an unstated exclusivity provision.

The same is true of the final category of historical evidencediscussed by the majority: controversies in the House and

the Senate over seating candidates who were duly electedbut who arguably failed to satisfy qualifications imposed by
state law.
quirements for their state legislators, there may have been little perceived need for a separate property qualification for their Members of
Congress.

Even States that wanted to create such a qualification, and that considered it within their constitutional authority to do so, might have been
deterred by the possibility that the Federal House of Representatives
would take a different view. As I have shown, there certainly was no
general understanding that the Qualifications Clauses included an unstated exclusivity provision. But people of the day did consider this to
be "one of the doubtful questions on which honest men may differ with
the purest motives." 14 Writings of Thomas Jefferson, at 83 (letter to
Joseph C. Cabell, Jan. 31, 1814); see n. 14, supra. If some States feared
that the "honest men" in the House might throw out the results of an
election because of a qualifications law, they might well have thought that
any policy benefits of such laws were outweighed by the risk that they
would temporarily be deprived of representation in Congress. Alternatively, they may simply have wanted to stay away from difficult constitutional questions. Cf. Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). Thus, despite concluding that the States do enjoy
the power to prescribe qualifications, Thomas Jefferson questioned
whether the advantages of added qualifications were sufficient to justify
enacting a law whose constitutionality could be disputed. See 14 Writings of Thomas Jefferson, at 84.

As the majority concedes, " `congressional practice has
been erratic' " and is of limited relevance anyway. Ante, at
819 (quoting Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S., at 545). Actions taken by a single House of Congress in 1887 or in 1964
shed little light on the original understanding of the Constitution. Presumably for that reason, the majority puts its
chief emphasis on the 1807 debate in the House of Representatives about whether to seat Maryland's William McCreery. See ante, at 816-818. I agree with the majority
that this debate might lend some support to the majority's
position if it had transpired as reported in Powell v. McCormack. See ante, at 816-817. But the Court's discussion--
both in Powell and today--is misleading.

A Maryland statute dating from 1802 had created a district
entitled to send two representatives to the House, one of
whom had to be a resident of Baltimore County and the other
of whom had to be a resident of Baltimore City. McCreery
was elected to the Ninth Congress as a resident of Baltimore
City. After his reelection to the Tenth Congress, however,
his qualifications were challenged on the ground that because
he divided his time between his summer estate in Baltimore
County and his residence in Washington, D. C., he was no
longer a resident of Baltimore City at all.

As the majority notes, a report of the House Committee
of Elections recommended that McCreery be seated on the
ground that state legislatures have no authority to add to the
qualifications set forth in the Constitution. See 17 Annals
of Cong. 871 (1807); ante, at 816-817. But the committee's
submission of this initial report sparked a heated debate that
spanned four days, with many speeches on both sides of the
issue. See 17 Annals of Cong. 871-919, 927-947 (reporting
proceedings from Nov. 12, 13, 16, and 18, 1807). Finally, a
large majority of the House voted to recommit the report to
the Committee of Elections. Id., at 950 (Nov. 19, 1807).
The committee thereupon deleted all references to the

constitutional issue and issued a revised report that focusedentirely on the factual question whether McCreery satisfied

the state residency requirement. Id., at 1059-1061 (Dec. 7,1807). After receiving the new report, the House seated
McCreery with a resolution simply saying: "Resolved, That
William McCreery is entitled to his seat in this House." Id.,at 1237 (Dec. 24, 1807). By overwhelming majorities, the

House rejected both a proposal to specify that McCreerypossessed "the qualifications required by the law of Maryland," ibid., and a proposal to declare only that he was "dulyqualified, agreeably to the constitution of the United States,"
id., at 1231. Far from supporting the majority's position,the McCreery episode merely demonstrates that the 10th
House of Representatives was deeply divided over whether
state legislatures may add to the qualifications set forth inthe Constitution.

38

The majority needs more than that. The prohibition that
today's majority enforces is found nowhere in the text of the
Qualifications Clauses. In the absence of evidence that theClauses nonetheless were generally understood at the time

of the framing to imply such a prohibition, we may not usethe Clauses to invalidate the decisions of a State or its
people.

III

It is radical enough for the majority to hold that the Constitution implicitly precludes the people of the States from
prescribing any eligibility requirements for the congres38 Though obliquely acknowledging this fact, the majority thinks it relevant that some subsequent commentators have mistakenly accepted the
gloss put on the McCreery case by two editors in 1834. See ante, at
817-818 (citing treatises, each of which relies upon Cases of Contested
Elections in Congress (M. Clarke & D. Hall eds. 1834)). But surely we
need not accept an inaccurate view of history merely because it has appeared in print. The majority also cites Thomas Jefferson's hazy recollection of the McCreery case, see ante, at 817, without acknowledging Jefferson's conclusion that the States were free to supplement the Qualifications
Clauses. See supra, at 873-874.

sional candidates who seek their votes. This holding, afterall, does not stop with negating the term limits that many

States have seen fit to impose on their Senators and Repre-sentatives.

39 Today's decision also means that no State may

disqualify congressional candidates whom a court has foundto be mentally incompetent, see,

e. g., Fla. Stat. $$ 97.041(2),99.021(1)(a) (1991), who are currently in prison, see, e. g., Ill.

Comp. Stat. Ann., ch. 10, $$ 5/3-5, 5/7-10, 5/10-5 (1993 andWest Supp. 1995), or who have past vote-fraud convictions,
see, e. g., Ga. Code Ann. $$ 21-2-2(25), 21-2-8 (1993 andSupp. 1994). Likewise, after today's decision, the people of
each State must leave open the possibility that they willtrust someone with their vote in Congress even though they
do not trust him with a vote in the election for Congress.See,

e. g., R. I. Gen. Laws $ 17-14-1.2 (1988) (restrictingcandidacy to people "qualified to vote").

In order to invalidate $ 3 of Amendment 73, however, themajority must go further. The bulk of the majority's analysis--like Part II of my dissent--addresses the issues thatwould be raised if Arkansas had prescribed "genuine, unadulterated, undiluted term limits." See Rotunda, 73 Ore.L. Rev., at 570. But as the parties have agreed, Amendment
73 does not actually create this kind of disqualification. See

39 Going into the November 1994 elections, eight States had adopted
"pure" term limits of one sort or another. See Colo. Const., Art. XVIII,

$ 9a; Mich. Const., Art. II, $ 10; Mo. Const., Art. III, $ 45(a); Mont. Const.,
Art. IV, $ 8; Ohio Const., Art. V, $ 8; Ore. Const., Art. II, $ 20; S. D. Const.,
Art. III, $ 32; Utah Code Ann. $ 20A-10-301. Eight other States had
enacted "ballot access" provisions triggered by long-term incumbency or
multiple prior terms in Congress. See Ariz. Const., Art. VII, $ 18; Ark.
Const., Amdt. 73, $ 3; Calif. Elec. Code Ann. $ 25003 (West Supp. 1994);
Fla. Const., Art. VI, $$ 4(b)(5), (6); N. D. Cent. Code $ 16.1-01-13.1 (Supp.

(1994); Wyo. Stat. $ 22-5-104 (Supp. 1994). In the 1994 elections, six more
States--Alaska, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, Nebraska, and Nevada--
enacted term-limit or ballot-access measures, bringing to 22 the total number of States with such provisions. See Pear, The 1994 Elections, N. Y.
Times, Nov. 10, 1994, p. B7, col. 4. In 21 of these States, the measures
have been enacted by direct vote of the people.

Tr. of Oral Arg. 53-54; cf. ante, at 828. It does not say that
covered candidates may not serve any more terms in Congress if reelected, and it does not indirectly achieve the same
result by barring those candidates from seeking reelection.
It says only that if they are to win reelection, they must do
so by write-in votes.

One might think that this is a distinction without a difference. As the majority notes, "[t]he uncontested data submitted to the Arkansas Supreme Court" show that write-in
candidates have won only six congressional elections in this
century. Ante, at 830, n. 43. But while the data's accuracy
is indeed "uncontested," petitioners filed an equally uncontested affidavit challenging the data's relevance. As political science professor James S. Fay swore to the Arkansas
Supreme Court, "[m]ost write-in candidacies in the past have
been waged by fringe candidates, with little public support
and extremely low name identification." App. 201. To the
best of Professor Fay's knowledge, in modern times only two
incumbent Congressmen have ever sought reelection as
write-in candidates. One of them was Dale Alford of Arkansas, who had first entered the House of Representatives by
winning 51% of the vote as a write-in candidate in 1958; Alford then waged a write-in campaign for reelection in 1960,
winning a landslide 83% of the vote against an opponent who
enjoyed a place on the ballot. Id., at 201-202. The other
incumbent write-in candidate was Philip J. Philbin of Massachusetts, who--despite losing his party primary and thus his
spot on the ballot--won 27% of the vote in his unsuccessful
write-in candidacy. See id., at 203. According to Professor
Fay, these results--coupled with other examples of successful write-in campaigns, such as Ross Perot's victory in North
Dakota's 1992 Democratic Presidential primary--"demonstrate that when a write-in candidate is well-known and
well-funded, it is quite possible for him or her to win an
election." Ibid.

The majority responds that whether "the Arkansas
amendment has the likely effect of creating a qualification"
is "simply irrelevant to our holding today." Ante, at 836.
But the majority--which, after all, bases its holding on the
asserted exclusivity of the Qualifications Clauses--never adequately explains how it can take this position and still reach
its conclusion.

One possible explanation for why the actual effect of the
Arkansas amendment might be irrelevant is that the Arkansas Supreme Court has already issued a binding determination of fact on this point. Thus, the majority notes that "the
state court" has advised us that "there is nothing more than
a faint glimmer of possibility that the excluded candidate will
win." Ante, at 830. But the majority is referring to a mere
plurality opinion, signed by only three of the seven justices
who decided the case below. One of the two justices who
concurred in the plurality's holding that Amendment 73 violates the Qualifications Clauses did write that "as a practical
matter, the amendment would place term limits on service
in the Congress," but he immediately followed this comment
with the concession that write-in candidacies are not entirely
hopeless; his point was simply that "as a practical matter,
write-in candidates are at a distinct disadvantage." 316
Ark., at 276; 872 S. W. 2d, at 364 (Dudley, J., concurring in
part and dissenting in part). As a result, the majority may
rely upon the state court only for the proposition that
Amendment 73 makes the specified candidates "distinct[ly]"
worse off than they would be in its absence-- an unassailable
proposition that petitioners have conceded.

In the current posture of these cases, indeed, it would have
been extremely irregular for the Arkansas Supreme Court
to have gone any further. Disputed questions of fact, in Arkansas as elsewhere, generally are resolved at trial rather
than on appeal from the entry of summary judgment. See

920 U. S. TERM LIMITS, INC. v. THORNTON

Thomas, J., dissenting
Ark. Rule Civ. Proc. 56.40 Accordingly, the majority explic-itly disclaims any reliance on the state court's purported

finding about the effect of Amendment 73. See ante, at830, n. 44.

Instead, the majority emphasizes another purported con-clusion of the Arkansas Supreme Court. As the majority
notes, the plurality below asserted that "[t]he intent" ofAmendment 73 was "to disqualify congressional incumbents
from further service." 316 Ark., at 266, 872 S. W. 2d, at 357.According to the majority, "[w]e must, of course, accept the
state court's view of the purpose of its own law: We are thusauthoritatively informed that the sole purpose of $ 3 of
Amendment 73 was to attempt to achieve a result that isforbidden by the Federal Constitution." Ante, at 829.

I am not sure why the intent behind a law should affectour analysis under the Qualifications Clauses. If a law does
not in fact add to the constitutional qualifications, the mis-taken expectations of the people who enacted it would not
seem to affect whether it violates the alleged exclusivity ofthose Clauses. But in any event, the majority is wrong
about what "the state court" has told us. Even the plurality

40 Even if one were inclined to believe that the Arkansas Supreme Court
had departed from the usual practice and had purported to make a binding
determination on a disputed issue of fact, we would not be foreclosed from
examining the basis for that determination. To be sure, on direct review
of a state court's judgment, we will not "conduct a more searching review
of findings made in state trial court than we conduct with respect to federal district court findings." Hernandez v. New York, 500 U. S. 352, 369
(1991) (plurality opinion). But that is only to say that we will review
state-court findings under the "clear error" standard. Ibid.; accord, id.,
at 372 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); cf. id., at 379 (Stevens, J.,
dissenting) (identifying no standard of review, but arguing that the state
court's decision should be reversed because its underlying factual findings
were erroneous). In certain areas, indeed, this Court apparently gives
quite little deference to the initial factfinder, but rather "exercise[s] its
own independent judgment" about the factual conclusions that should be
drawn from the record. See Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United
States, Inc., 466 U. S. 485, 501, and n. 17 (1984) (Stevens, J.).

below did not flatly assert that the desire to "disqualify" con-gressional incumbents was the

sole purpose behind $ 3 of
Amendment 73. More important, neither of the justiceswho concurred in the plurality's holding said anything at all

about the intent behind Amendment 73. As a result, we
cannot attribute any findings on this issue to the ArkansasSupreme Court.

The majority suggests that this does not matter, becauseAmendment 73 itself says that it has the purpose of "evading
the requirements of the Qualifications Clauses." See ante,at 831 (referring to the "avowed purpose" of Amendment
73). The majority bases this assertion on the amendment's
preamble, which speaks of "limit[ing] the terms of elected
officials." See ante, at 830. But this statement may be referring only to $$ 1 and 2 of Amendment 73, which impose
true term limits on state officeholders. Even if the statement refers to $ 3 as well, it may simply reflect the limiting
effects that the drafters of the preamble expected to flow
from what they perceived as the restoration of electoral competition to congressional races. See infra, at 924. In any
event, inquiries into legislative intent are even more difficult
than usual when the legislative body whose unified intent
must be determined consists of 825,162 Arkansas voters.

The majority nonetheless thinks it clear that the goal of

$ 3 is "to prevent the election of incumbents." See ante,
at 830, 836. In reaching this conclusion at the summaryjudgment stage, however, the majority has given short shrift
to petitioners' contrary claim. Petitioners do not deny that

$ 3 of Amendment 73 intentionally handicaps a class of candidates, in the sense that it decreases their pre-existing electoral chances. But petitioners do deny that $ 3 is intended
to (or will in fact) "prevent" the covered candidates from
winning reelection, or "disqualify" them from further service. One of petitioners' central arguments is that congressionally conferred advantages have artificially inflated the
pre-existing electoral chances of the covered candidates, and

Thomas, J., dissenting
that Amendment 73 is merely designed to level the playingfield on which challengers compete with them.

To understand this argument requires some background.Current federal law (enacted, of course, by congressional incumbents) confers numerous advantages on incumbents, andthese advantages are widely thought to make it "significantly
more difficult" for challengers to defeat them. Cf. ante, at831. For instance, federal law gives incumbents enormous
advantages in building name recognition and good will intheir home districts. See,

e. g., 39 U. S. C. $ 3210 (permittingMembers of Congress to send "franked" mail free of charge);

2 U. S. C. $$ 61-1, 72a, 332 (permitting Members to have siz-able taxpayer-funded staffs); 2 U. S. C. $ 123b (establishing
the House Recording Studio and the Senate Recording andPhotographic Studios).

41 At the same time that incumbent

Members of Congress enjoy these in-kind benefits, Congressimposes spending and contribution limits in congressional

campaigns that "can prevent challengers from spending more. . . to overcome their disadvantage in name recognition."
App. to Brief for State of Washington as Amicus CuriaeA-4 (statement of former 10-term Representative William
E. Frenzel, referring to 2 U. S. C. $ 441a). Many observersbelieve that the campaign-finance laws also give incumbents
an "enormous fund-raising edge" over their challengers bygiving a large financing role to entities with incentives to
curry favor with incumbents. Wertheimer & Manes, Cam-paign Finance Reform: A Key to Restoring the Health of
Our Democracy, 94 Colum. L. Rev. 1126, 1133 (1994). In

41 Former Representative William E. Frenzel describes the House Recording Studio as a sophisticated operation used "to prepare tapes of
speeches and messages to voters." Frenzel explains: "Taxpayers pay for
the facilities, the personnel that run them, the production costs, and the
costs of distributing, by mail or otherwise, the tapes that members supply
(from their taxpayer-funded expense accounts). These messages are
widely disseminated by broadcasters, who can use them to fill air time at
no cost to themselves." App. to Brief for State of Washington as Amicus
Curiae A-5 to A-6.

addition, the internal rules of Congress put a substantialpremium on seniority, with the result that each Member's

already plentiful opportunities to distribute benefits to hisconstituents increase with the length of his tenure. In this
manner, Congress effectively "fines" the electorate for voting
against incumbents. Hills, 53 U. Pitt. L. Rev., at 144-145.Cynics see no accident in any of this. As former Representative Frenzel puts it: "The practice . . . is for incumbentsto devise institutional structures and systems that favor incumbents." App. to Brief for State of Washington as Amicus
Curiae A-3. In fact, despite his service from 1971 to 1989 on
the House Administration Committee (which has jurisdiction
over election laws), Representative Frenzel can identify no instance in which Congress "changed election laws in such a way
as to lessen the chances of re-election for incumbents, or to
improve the election opportunities for challengers." Ibid.

At the same time that incumbents enjoy the electoral advantages that they have conferred upon themselves, they
also enjoy astonishingly high reelection rates. As Lloyd
Cutler reported in 1989, "over the past thirty years a
weighted average of ninety percent of all House and Senate
incumbents of both parties who ran for reelection were reelected, even at times when their own party lost control of
the Presidency itself." Cutler, Now is the Time for All Good
Men . . . , 30 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 387, 395; see also Kristol,
Term Limitations: Breaking Up the Iron Triangle, 16 Harv.
J. L. & Pub. Policy 95, 97, and n. 11 (1993) (reporting that in
the 100th Congress, as many Representatives died as were
defeated at the polls). Even in the November 1994 elections, which are widely considered to have effected the most
sweeping change in Congress in recent memory, 90% of the
incumbents who sought reelection to the House were successful, and nearly half of the losers were completing only
their first terms. Reply Brief for Petitioners U. S. Term
Limits, Inc., et al. 4, n. 5. Only 2 of the 26 Senate incumbents seeking reelection were defeated, see ibid., and one of

them had been elected for the first time in a special election
only a few years earlier.

The voters of Arkansas evidently believe that incumbents
would not enjoy such overwhelming success if electoral contests were truly fair--that is, if the government did not put
its thumb on either side of the scale. The majority offers no
reason to question the accuracy of this belief. Given this
context, petitioners portray $ 3 of Amendment 73 as an effort
at the state level to offset the electoral advantages that congressional incumbents have conferred upon themselves at
the federal level.

To be sure, the offset is only rough and approximate; no
one knows exactly how large an electoral benefit comes with
having been a long-term Member of Congress, and no one
knows exactly how large an electoral disadvantage comes
from forcing a well-funded candidate with high name recognition to run a write-in campaign. But the majority does
not base its holding on the premise that Arkansas has struck
the wrong balance. Instead, the majority holds that the
Qualifications Clauses preclude Arkansas from trying to
strike any balance at all; the majority simply says that "an
amendment with the avowed purpose and obvious effect of
evading the requirements of the Qualifications Clauses by
handicapping a class of candidates cannot stand." Ante, at
831. Thus, the majority apparently would reach the same result even if one could demonstrate at trial that the electoral
advantage conferred by Amendment 73 upon challengers
precisely counterbalances the electoral advantages conferred
by federal law upon long-term Members of Congress.

For me, this suggests only two possibilities. Either the
majority's holding is wrong and Amendment 73 does not violate the Qualifications Clauses, or (assuming the accuracy of
petitioners' factual claims) the electoral system that exists
without Amendment 73 is no less unconstitutional than the
electoral system that exists with Amendment 73.

I do not mean to suggest that States have unbridled power
to handicap particular classes of candidates, even when those
candidates enjoy federally conferred advantages that may
threaten to skew the electoral process. But laws that allegedly have the purpose and effect of handicapping a particular
class of candidates traditionally are reviewed under the First
and Fourteenth Amendments rather than the Qualifications
Clauses. Compare Storer v. Brown, 415 U. S., at 728-736
(undertaking a lengthy First and Fourteenth Amendment
analysis of a California rule that denied ballot access to any
independent candidate for Congress who had not severed his
ties to a political party at least one year prior to the immediately preceding primary election, or 17 months before the
general election), with id., at 746, n. 16 (dismissing as "wholly
without merit" the notion that this rule might violate the
Qualifications Clauses). Term-limit measures have tended
to survive such review without difficulty. See, e. g., Moore
v. McCartney, 425 U. S. 946 (1976) (dismissing an appeal from
State ex rel. Maloney v. McCartney, 159 W. Va. 513, 223
S. E. 2d 607, on the ground that limits on the terms of state
officeholders do not even raise a substantial federal question
under the First and Fourteenth Amendments).

To analyze such laws under the Qualifications Clauses may
open up whole new vistas for courts. If it is true that "the
current congressional campaign finance system . . . has
created an electoral system so stacked against challengers
that in many elections voters have no real choices,"
Wertheimer & Manes, 94 Colum. L. Rev., at 1133, are the
Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974 unconstitutional under (of all things) the Qualifications Clauses?
Cf. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976) (upholding the current system against First Amendment challenge). If it can
be shown that nonminorities are at a significant disadvantage
when they seek election in districts dominated by minority
voters, would the intentional creation of "majority-minority

districts" violate the Qualifications Clauses even if it wereto survive scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment? Cf.

Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 649 (1993) ("[W]e express noview as to whether [the intentional creation of such districts]
always gives rise to an equal protection claim"); id., at 677(

Stevens, J., dissenting) (arguing that States may draw dis-trict lines for the "sole purpose" of helping blacks or members of certain other groups win election to Congress).More generally, if "[d]istrict lines are rarely neutral phenomena" and if "districting inevitably has and is intended to havesubstantial political consequences," Gaffney v. Cummings,
412 U. S. 735, 753 (1973), will plausible Qualifications Clausechallenges greet virtually every redistricting decision? Cf.
id., at 754 (noting our general refusal to use the Equal Pro-tection Clause to "attemp[t] the impossible task of extirpating politics from what are the essentially political processesof the sovereign States"); see also

Burns v. Richardson, 384U. S. 73, 89, n. 16 (1966) (finding nothing invidious in the

practice of drawing district lines in a way that helps currentincumbents by avoiding contests between them).

The majority's opinion may not go so far, although it doesnot itself suggest any principled stopping point. No matter
how narrowly construed, however, today's decision reads theQualifications Clauses to impose substantial implicit prohibitions on the States and the people of the States. I wouldnot draw such an expansive negative inference from the fact
that the Constitution requires Members of Congress to be acertain age, to be inhabitants of the States that they represent, and to have been United States citizens for a specifiedperiod. Rather, I would read the Qualifications Clauses to
do no more than what they say. I respectfully dissent.

WILSON v. ARKANSAS
certiorari to the supreme court of arkansas

No. 94-5707. Argued March 28, 1995--Decided May 22, 1995
Petitioner was convicted on state-law drug charges after the Arkansas

trial court denied her evidence-suppression motion, in which she asserted that the search of her home was invalid because, inter alia,
the police had violated the common-law principle requiring them to
announce their presence and authority before entering. The State
Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting petitioner's argument that the
common-law "knock and announce" principle is required by the Fourth
Amendment.

Held: The common-law knock and announce principle forms a part of the

Fourth Amendment reasonableness inquiry. Pp. 931-937.

(a) An officer's unannounced entry into a home might, in some circumstances, be unreasonable under the Amendment. In evaluating the
scope of the constitutional right to be secure in one's house, this Court
has looked to the traditional protections against unreasonable searches
and seizures afforded by the common law at the time of the framing.
Given the longstanding common-law endorsement of the practice of
announcement, and the wealth of founding-era commentaries, constitutional provisions, statutes, and cases espousing or supporting the knock
and announce principle, this Court has little doubt that the Amendment's Framers thought that whether officers announced their presence
and authority before entering a dwelling was among the factors to be
considered in assessing a search's reasonableness. Nevertheless, the
common-law principle was never stated as an inflexible rule requiring
announcement under all circumstances. Countervailing law enforcement interests--including, e. g., the threat of physical harm to police,
the fact that an officer is pursuing a recently escaped arrestee, and the
existence of reason to believe that evidence would likely be destroyed
if advance notice were given--may establish the reasonableness of an
unannounced entry. For now, this Court leaves to the lower courts the
task of determining such relevant countervailing factors. Pp. 934-936.

(b) Respondent's asserted reasons for affirming the judgment
below--that the police reasonably believed that a prior announcement
would have placed them in peril and would have produced an unreasonable risk that petitioner would destroy easily disposable narcotics
evidence--may well provide the necessary justification for the unannounced entry in this case. The case is remanded to allow the state

Opinion of the Court
Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
At the time of the framing, the common law of search andseizure recognized a law enforcement officer's authority to

break open the doors of a dwelling, but generally indicatedthat he first ought to announce his presence and authority.
In this case, we hold that this common-law "knock and an-nounce" principle forms a part of the reasonableness inquiry
under the Fourth Amendment.

I
During November and December 1992, petitioner SharleneWilson made a series of narcotics sales to an informant acting at the direction of the Arkansas State Police. In lateNovember, the informant purchased marijuana and methamphetamine at the home that petitioner shared with BrysonJacobs. On December 30, the informant telephoned petitioner at her home and arranged to meet her at a local storeto buy some marijuana. According to testimony presented
below, petitioner produced a semiautomatic pistol at thismeeting and waved it in the informant's face, threatening
to kill her if she turned out to be working for the police.Petitioner then sold the informant a bag of marijuana.

The next day, police officers applied for and obtained war-rants to search petitioner's home and to arrest both petitioner and Jacobs. Affidavits filed in support of the war-rants set forth the details of the narcotics transactions and
stated that Jacobs had previously been convicted of arsonand firebombing. The search was conducted later that afternoon. Police officers found the main door to petitioner'shome open. While opening an unlocked screen door and entering the residence, they identified themselves as police of-ficers and stated that they had a warrant. Once inside the
home, the officers seized marijuana, methamphetamine, val-ium, narcotics paraphernalia, a gun, and ammunition. They
also found petitioner in the bathroom, flushing marijuanadown the toilet. Petitioner and Jacobs were arrested and

930 WILSON v. ARKANSAS

Opinion of the Court
charged with delivery of marijuana, delivery of methamphetamine, possession of drug paraphernalia, and possession of
marijuana.

Before trial, petitioner filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized during the search. Petitioner asserted that the
search was invalid on various grounds, including that the officers had failed to "knock and announce" before entering her
home. The trial court summarily denied the suppression
motion. After a jury trial, petitioner was convicted of all
charges and sentenced to 32 years in prison.

The Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed petitioner's conviction on appeal. 317 Ark. 548, 878 S. W. 2d 755 (1994). The
court noted that "the officers entered the home while they
were identifying themselves," but it rejected petitioner's argument that "the Fourth Amendment requires officers to
knock and announce prior to entering the residence." Id.,
at 553, 878 S. W. 2d, at 758 (emphasis added). Finding "no
authority for [petitioner's] theory that the knock and announce principle is required by the Fourth Amendment," the
court concluded that neither Arkansas law nor the Fourth
Amendment required suppression of the evidence. Ibid.

We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict among the
lower courts as to whether the common-law knock and announce principle forms a part of the Fourth Amendment reasonableness inquiry.1 513 U. S. 1014 (1995). We hold that
it does, and accordingly reverse and remand.

1 See, e. g., People v. Gonzalez, 211 Cal. App. 3d 1043, 1048, 259 Cal.

Opinion of the Court

II
The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution protects "[t]he
right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,
papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and
seizures." In evaluating the scope of this right, we have
looked to the traditional protections against unreasonable
searches and seizures afforded by the common law at the
time of the framing. See California v. Hodari D., 499 U. S.
621, 624 (1991); United States v. Watson, 423 U. S. 411, 418-
420 (1976); Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 149 (1925).
"Although the underlying command of the Fourth Amendment is always that searches and seizures be reasonable,"
New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325, 337 (1985), our effort to
give content to this term may be guided by the meaning
ascribed to it by the Framers of the Amendment. An examination of the common law of search and seizure leaves no
doubt that the reasonableness of a search of a dwelling may
depend in part on whether law enforcement officers announced their presence and authority prior to entering.

Although the common law generally protected a man's
house as "his castle of defence and asylum," 3 W. Blackstone,
Commentaries *288 (hereinafter Blackstone), common-law
courts long have held that "when the King is party, the sheriff (if the doors be not open) may break the party's house,
either to arrest him, or to do other execution of the K[ing]'s
process, if otherwise he cannot enter." Semayne's Case, 5
Co. Rep. 91a, 91b, 77 Eng. Rep. 194, 195 (K. B. 1603). To
this rule, however, common-law courts appended an important qualification:

"But before he breaks it, he ought to signify the cause
of his coming, and to make request to open doors . . . ,
for the law without a default in the owner abhors the
destruction or breaking of any house (which is for the
habitation and safety of man) by which great damage
and inconvenience might ensue to the party, when no

default is in him; for perhaps he did not know of theprocess, of which, if he had notice, it is to be presumed

that he would obey it . . . ." Ibid., 77 Eng. Rep., at195-196.

See also Case of Richard Curtis, Fost. 135, 137, 168 Eng.Rep. 67, 68 (Crown 1757) ("[N]o precise form of words is
required in a case of this kind. It is sufficient that the partyhath notice, that the officer cometh not as a mere trespasser,
but claiming to act under a proper authority . . ."); Lee v.

that it is privileged; but the door may be broken "when thedue notification and demand has been made and refused").

Several prominent founding-era commentators agreed onthis basic principle. According to Sir Matthew Hale, the

"constant practice" at common law was that "the officer maybreak open the door, if he be sure the offender is there, if
after acquainting them of the business, and demanding theprisoner, he refuses to open the door." See 1 M. Hale, Pleas
of the Crown *582. William Hawkins propounded a similarprinciple: "the law doth never allow" an officer to break open
the door of a dwelling "but in cases of necessity," that is,unless he "first signify to those in the house the cause of his
coming, and request them to give him admittance." 2 W.Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, ch. 14, $ 1, p. 138 (6th ed. 1787).

2 This "knock and announce" principle appears to predate even Semayne's Case, which is usually cited as the judicial source of the commonlaw standard. Semayne's Case itself indicates that the doctrine may be
traced to a statute enacted in 1275, and that at that time the statute was
"but an affirmance of the common law." 5 Co. Rep., at 91b, 77 Eng. Rep.,
at 196 (referring to 3 Edw. I, ch. 17, in 1 Statutes at Large from Magna
Carta to Hen. 6 (O. Ruffhead ed. 1769) (providing that if any person takes
the beasts of another and causes them "to be driven into a Castle or Fortress," if the sheriff makes "solem[n] deman[d]" for deliverance of the
beasts, and if the person "did not cause the Beasts to be delivered incontinent," the King "shall cause the said Castle or Fortress to be beaten down
without Recovery")).

Opinion of the Court
Sir William Blackstone stated simply that the sheriff may"justify breaking open doors, if the possession be not quietly

delivered." 3 Blackstone *412.The common-law knock and announce principle was woven
quickly into the fabric of early American law. Most of the
States that ratified the Fourth Amendment had enacted con-stitutional provisions or statutes generally incorporating

English common law, see, e. g., N. J. Const. of 1776, $ 22, in 5Federal and State Constitutions 2598 (F. Thorpe ed. 1909)
("[T]he common law of England . . . shall still remain in force,until [it] shall be altered by a future law of the Legislature");
N. Y. Const. of 1777, Art. 35, in id., at 2635 ("[S]uch parts of
the common law of England . . . as . . . did form the law of
[New York on April 19, 1775] shall be and continue the law
of this State, subject to such alterations and provisions as
the legislature of this State shall, from time to time, make
concerning the same"); Ordinances of May 1776, ch. 5, $ 6, in
9 Statutes at Large of Virginia 127 (W. Hening ed. 1821)
("[T]he common law of England . . . shall be the rule of decision, and shall be considered as in full force, until the same
shall be altered by the legislative power of this colony"), and
a few States had enacted statutes specifically embracing the
common-law view that the breaking of the door of a dwelling
was permitted once admittance was refused, see, e. g., Act of
Nov. 8, 1782, ch. 15, || 6, in Acts and Laws of Massachusetts
193 (1782); Act of Apr. 13, 1782, ch. 39, $ 3, in 1 Laws of the
State of New York 480 (1886); Act of June 24, 1782, ch. 317,

$ 18, in Acts of the General Assembly of New-Jersey (1784)
(reprinted in The First Laws of the State of New Jersey

ch. 925, $ 5, in 10 Statutes at Large of Pennsylvania 255 (J.
Mitchell & H. Flanders comp. 1904). Early American courts
similarly embraced the common-law knock and announce
principle. See, e. g., Walker v. Fox, 32 Ky. 404, 405 (1834);
Burton v. Wilkinson, 18 Vt. 186, 189 (1846); Howe v. Butterfield, 58 Mass. 302, 305 (1849). See generally Blakey, The

934 WILSON v. ARKANSAS

Opinion of the Court
Rule of Announcement and Unlawful Entry, 112 U. Pa. L.Rev. 499, 504-508 (1964) (collecting cases).

Our own cases have acknowledged that the common-lawprinciple of announcement is "embedded in Anglo-American
law," Miller v. United States, 357 U. S. 301, 313 (1958), butwe have never squarely held that this principle is an element
of the reasonableness inquiry under the Fourth Amendment.3We now so hold. Given the longstanding common-law endorsement of the practice of announcement, we have littledoubt that the Framers of the Fourth Amendment thought
that the method of an officer's entry into a dwelling wasamong the factors to be considered in assessing the reasonableness of a search or seizure. Contrary to the decisionbelow, we hold that in some circumstances an officer's unannounced entry into a home might be unreasonable under theFourth Amendment.

This is not to say, of course, that every entry must be pre-ceded by an announcement. The Fourth Amendment's flexible requirement of reasonableness should not be read tomandate a rigid rule of announcement that ignores countervailing law enforcement interests. As even petitioner con-cedes, the common-law principle of announcement was never
stated as an inflexible rule requiring announcement under allcircumstances. See

Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 38(1963) (plurality opinion) ("[I]t has been recognized from the

early common law that . . . breaking is permissible in execut-ing an arrest under certain circumstances"); see also, e. g.,

3 In Miller, our discussion focused on the statutory requirement of announcement found in 18 U. S. C. $ 3109 (1958 ed.), not on the constitutional
requirement of reasonableness. See 357 U. S., at 306, 308, 313. See also
Sabbath v. United States, 391 U. S. 585, 591, n. 8 (1968) (suggesting that
both the "common law" rule of announcement and entry and its "exceptions" were codified in $ 3109); Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 40-41 (1963)
(plurality opinion) (reasoning that an unannounced entry was reasonable
under the "exigent circumstances" of that case, without addressing the
antecedent question whether the lack of announcement might render a
search unreasonable under other circumstances).

White & Wiltsheire, 2 Rolle 137, 138, 81 Eng. Rep. 709, 710(K. B. 1619) (upholding the sheriff 's breaking of the door of

the plaintiff 's dwelling after the sheriff 's bailiffs had beenimprisoned in plaintiff 's dwelling while they attempted an
earlier execution of the seizure); Pugh v. Griffith, 7 Ad. & E.
827, 840-841, 112 Eng. Rep. 681, 686 (K. B. 1838) (holdingthat "the necessity of a demand . . . is obviated, because there

was nobody on whom a demand could be made" and notingthat

White & Wiltsheire leaves open the possibility that
there may be "other occasions where the outer door may bebroken" without prior demand).

Indeed, at the time of the framing, the common-law admonition that an officer "ought to signify the cause of his coming," Semayne's Case, 5 Co. Rep., at 91b, 77 Eng. Rep., at
195, had not been extended conclusively to the context of
felony arrests. See Blakey, supra, at 503 ("The full scope of
the application of the rule in criminal cases . . . was never
judicially settled"); Launock v. Brown, 2 B. & Ald. 592, 593,
106 Eng. Rep. 482, 483 (K. B. 1819) ("It is not at present
necessary for us to decide how far, in the case of a person
charged with felony, it would be necessary to make a previous demand of admittance before you could justify breaking
open the outer door of his house"); W. Murfree, Law of Sheriffs and Other Ministerial Officers $ 1163, p. 631 (1st ed. 1884)
("[A]lthough there has been some doubt on the question, the
better opinion seems to be that, in cases of felony, no demand
of admittance is necessary, especially as, in many cases, the
delay incident to it would enable the prisoner to escape").
The common-law principle gradually was applied to cases involving felonies, but at the same time the courts continued
to recognize that under certain circumstances the presumption in favor of announcement necessarily would give way to
contrary considerations.

Thus, because the common-law rule was justified in part
by the belief that announcement generally would avoid "the
destruction or breaking of any house . . . by which great

Opinion of the Court
damage and inconvenience might ensue," Semayne's Case,
supra, at 91b, 77 Eng. Rep., at 196, courts acknowledged that
the presumption in favor of announcement would yield undercircumstances presenting a threat of physical violence. See,

e. g., Read v. Case, 4 Conn. 166, 170 (1822) (plaintiff who "had
resolved . . . to resist even to the shedding of blood . . . wasnot within the reason and spirit of the rule requiring notice"); Mahomed v. The Queen, 4 Moore 239, 247, 13 Eng.Rep. 293, 296 (P. C. 1843) ("While he was firing pistols at
them, were they to knock at the door, and to ask him to bepleased to open it for them? The law in its wisdom only
requires this ceremony to be observed when it possibly may
be attended with some advantage, and may render the
breaking open of the outer door unnecessary"). Similarly,
courts held that an officer may dispense with announcement
in cases where a prisoner escapes from him and retreats to
his dwelling. See, e. g., ibid.; Allen v. Martin, 10 Wend. 300,
304 (N. Y. Sup. Ct. 1833). Proof of "demand and refusal"
was deemed unnecessary in such cases because it would be
a "senseless ceremony" to require an officer in pursuit of
a recently escaped arrestee to make an announcement prior
to breaking the door to retake him. Id., at 304. Finally,
courts have indicated that unannounced entry may be justified where police officers have reason to believe that evidence would likely be destroyed if advance notice were
given. See Ker, supra, at 40-41 (plurality opinion); People
v. Maddox, 46 Cal. 2d 301, 305-306, 294 P. 2d 6, 9 (1956).

We need not attempt a comprehensive catalog of the relevant countervailing factors here. For now, we leave to the
lower courts the task of determining the circumstances
under which an unannounced entry is reasonable under the
Fourth Amendment. We simply hold that although a search
or seizure of a dwelling might be constitutionally defective
if police officers enter without prior announcement, law
enforcement interests may also establish the reasonableness
of an unannounced entry.

Opinion of the Court

III
Respondent contends that the judgment below should beaffirmed because the unannounced entry in this case was justified for two reasons. First, respondent argues that policeofficers reasonably believed that a prior announcement
would have placed them in peril, given their knowledge thatpetitioner had threatened a government informant with a
semiautomatic weapon and that Mr. Jacobs had previouslybeen convicted of arson and firebombing. Second, respondent suggests that prior announcement would have producedan unreasonable risk that petitioner would destroy easily disposable narcotics evidence.These considerations may well provide the necessary justification for the unannounced entry in this case. Because theArkansas Supreme Court did not address their sufficiency,
however, we remand to allow the state courts to make anynecessary findings of fact and to make the determination of
reasonableness in the first instance. The judgment of theArkansas Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with thisopinion.

4

It is so ordered.

4 Respondent and its amici also ask us to affirm the denial of petitioner's
suppression motion on an alternative ground: that exclusion is not a constitutionally compelled remedy where the unreasonableness of a search
stems from the failure of announcement. Analogizing to the "independent source" doctrine applied in Segura v. United States, 468 U. S. 796,
805, 813-816 (1984), and the "inevitable discovery" rule adopted in Nix v.
Williams, 467 U. S. 431, 440-448 (1984), respondent and its amici argue
that any evidence seized after an unreasonable, unannounced entry is causally disconnected from the constitutional violation and that exclusion goes
beyond the goal of precluding any benefit to the government flowing from
the constitutional violation. Because this remedial issue was not addressed by the court below and is not within the narrow question on which
we granted certiorari, we decline to address these arguments.

FIRST OPTIONS OF CHICAGO, INC. v. KAPLAN

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 94-560. Argued March 22, 1995--Decided May 22, 1995
This case arose out of disputes centered on a "workout" agreement, embodied in four documents, which governs the "working out" of debts
owed by respondents--Manuel Kaplan, his wife, and his wholly owned
investment company, MK Investments, Inc. (MKI)--to petitioner First
Options of Chicago, Inc., a firm that clears stock trades on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. When First Options' demands for payment went
unsatisfied, it sought arbitration by a stock exchange panel. MKI,
which had signed the only workout document containing an arbitration
agreement, submitted to arbitration, but the Kaplans, who had not
signed that document, filed objections with the panel, denying that their
disagreement with First Options was arbitrable. The arbitrators decided that they had the power to rule on the dispute's merits and ruled
in First Options' favor. The District Court confirmed the award, but
the Court of Appeals reversed. In finding that the dispute was not
arbitrable, the Court of Appeals said that courts should independently
decide whether an arbitration panel has jurisdiction over a dispute, and
that it would apply ordinary standards of review when considering the
District Court's denial of respondents' motion to vacate the arbitration
award.

Held:

1. The arbitrability of the Kaplan/First Options dispute was subject
to independent review by the courts. Pp. 942-947.

(a) The answer to the narrow question whether the arbitrators or
the courts have the primary power to decide whether the parties agreed
to arbitrate a dispute's merits is fairly simple. Just as the arbitrability
of the merits of a dispute depends upon whether the parties agreed to
arbitrate that dispute, see, e. g., Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., ante, at 52, so the question "who has the primary power to
decide arbitrability" turns upon whether the parties agreed to submit
that question to arbitration. If so, then the court should defer to the
arbitrator's arbitrability decision. If not, then the court should decide
the question independently. These two answers flow inexorably from
the fact that arbitration is simply a matter of contract between the
parties. Pp. 942-943.

Syllabus
(b) The Kaplans did not agree to arbitrate arbitrability. Courts
generally should apply ordinary state-law principles governing contract
formation in deciding whether such an agreement exists. However,
courts should not assume that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is "clea[r] and unmistakabl[e]" evidence that they did
so. See, e. g., AT&T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers,
475 U. S. 643, 649. First Options cannot show a clear agreement on
the part of the Kaplans. The Kaplans' objections to the arbitrators'
jurisdiction indicate that they did not want the arbitrators to have binding authority over them. This conclusion is supported by (1) an obvious
explanation for their presence before the arbitrators (i. e., Mr. Kaplan's
wholly owned firm was arbitrating workout agreement matters); and (2)
Third Circuit law, which suggested that they might argue arbitrability
to the arbitrators without losing their right to independent court review.
First Options' counterarguments are unpersuasive. Pp. 943-947.

2. Courts of appeals should apply ordinary standards when reviewing
district court decisions upholding arbitration awards, i. e., accepting
findings of fact that are not "clearly erroneous" but deciding questions
of law de novo; they should not, in those circumstances, apply a special
"abuse of discretion" standard. It is undesirable to make the law more
complicated by proliferating special review standards without good reason. More importantly, a court of appeals' reviewing attitude toward a
district court decision should depend upon the respective institutional
advantages of trial and appellate courts, not upon what standard of review will more likely produce a particular substantive result. Nothing
in the Arbitration Act supports First Options' claim that a court of appeals should use a different standard when conducting review of certain
district court decisions. Pp. 947-949.

3. The factbound question whether the Court of Appeals erred in its
ultimate conclusion that the dispute was not arbitrable is beyond the
scope of the questions this Court agreed to review. P. 949.

Opinion of the Court
Leitch. Gary A. Rosen filed a brief for respondent Carol
Kaplan.*

Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this case we consider two questions about how courts
should review certain matters under the federal Arbitration
Act, 9 U. S. C. $ 1 et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. V): (1) how a
district court should review an arbitrator's decision that the
parties agreed to arbitrate a dispute, and (2) how a court of
appeals should review a district court's decision confirming,
or refusing to vacate, an arbitration award.

I
The case concerns several related disputes between, on
one side, First Options of Chicago, Inc., a firm that clears
stock trades on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, and, on
the other side, three parties: Manuel Kaplan; his wife, Carol
Kaplan; and his wholly owned investment company, MK Investments, Inc. (MKI), whose trading account First Options
cleared. The disputes center on a "workout" agreement,
embodied in four separate documents, which governs the
"working out" of debts to First Options that MKI and the
Kaplans incurred as a result of the October 1987 stock market crash. In 1989, after entering into the agreement, MKI
lost an additional $1.5 million. First Options then took control of, and liquidated, certain MKI assets; demanded immediate payment of the entire MKI debt; and insisted that the
Kaplans personally pay any deficiency. When its demands
went unsatisfied, First Options sought arbitration by a panel
of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange.

*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the National Futures Association et al. by Daniel J. Roth; and for the Philadelphia Stock
Exchange, Inc., et al. by Lydia Gavalis.

Gerald F. Rath, Steven W. Hansen, and Stuart J. Kaswell filed a brief
for the Securities Industry Association as amicus curiae.

Opinion of the Court
MKI, having signed the only workout document (out offour) that contained an arbitration clause, accepted arbitration. The Kaplans, however, who had not personally signedthat document, denied that their disagreement with First
Options was arbitrable and filed written objections to that
effect with the arbitration panel. The arbitrators decidedthat they had the power to rule on the merits of the parties'

dispute, and did so in favor of First Options. The Kaplansthen asked the Federal District Court to vacate the arbitration award, see 9 U. S. C. $ 10 (1988 ed., Supp. V), and FirstOptions requested its confirmation, see $ 9. The court confirmed the award. Nonetheless, on appeal the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit agreed with the Kaplans that
their dispute was not arbitrable; and it reversed the District
Court's confirmation of the award against them. 19 F. 3d
1503 (1994).

We granted certiorari to consider two questions regarding
the standards that the Court of Appeals used to review the
determination that the Kaplans' dispute with First Options
was arbitrable. 513 U. S. 1040 (1994). First, the Court of
Appeals said that courts "should independently decide
whether an arbitration panel has jurisdiction over the merits
of any particular dispute." 19 F. 3d, at 1509 (emphasis
added). First Options asked us to decide whether this is so
(i. e., whether courts, in "reviewing the arbitrators' decision
on arbitrability," should "apply a de novo standard of review
or the more deferential standard applied to arbitrators' decisions on the merits") when the objecting party "submitted
the issue to the arbitrators for decision." Pet. for Cert. i.
Second, the Court of Appeals stated that it would review
a district court's denial of a motion to vacate a commercial
arbitration award (and the correlative grant of a motion to
confirm it) "de novo." 19 F. 3d, at 1509. First Options argues that the Court of Appeals instead should have applied
an "abuse of discretion" standard. See Robbins v. Day, 954
F. 2d 679, 681-682 (CA11 1992).

942 FIRST OPTIONS OF CHICAGO, INC. v. KAPLAN

Opinion of the Court

II
The first question--the standard of review applied to anarbitrator's decision about arbitrability--is a narrow one.

To understand just how narrow, consider three types ofdisagreement present in this case. First, the Kaplans
and First Options disagree about whether the Kaplans arepersonally liable for MKI's debt to First Options. That
disagreement makes up the merits of the dispute. Second,they disagree about whether they agreed to arbitrate the
merits. That disagreement is about the arbitrability of thedispute. Third, they disagree about who should have the
primary power to decide the second matter. Does thatpower belong primarily to the arbitrators (because the court
reviews their arbitrability decision deferentially) or to thecourt (because the court makes up its mind about arbitrability independently)? We consider here only this thirdquestion.

Although the question is a narrow one, it has a certainpractical importance. That is because a party who has not
agreed to arbitrate will normally have a right to a court'sdecision about the merits of its dispute (say, as here, its obligation under a contract). But, where the party has agreedto arbitrate, he or she, in effect, has relinquished much of
that right's practical value. The party still can ask a courtto review the arbitrator's decision, but the court will set that
decision aside only in very unusual circumstances. See, e. g.,9 U. S. C. $ 10 (award procured by corruption, fraud, or undue
means; arbitrator exceeded his powers); Wilko v. Swan, 346U. S. 427, 436-437 (1953) (parties bound by arbitrator's decision not in "manifest disregard" of the law), overruled on
other grounds, Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American
Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477 (1989). Hence, who--court or
arbitrator--has the primary authority to decide whether aparty has agreed to arbitrate can make a critical difference

to a party resisting arbitration.

943Cite as: 514 U. S. 938 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
We believe the answer to the "who" question (i. e., the
standard-of-review question) is fairly simple. Just as the arbitrability of the merits of a dispute depends upon whether
the parties agreed to arbitrate that dispute, see, e. g., Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., ante, at 57; Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473
U. S. 614, 626 (1985), so the question "who has the primary
power to decide arbitrability" turns upon what the parties
agreed about that matter. Did the parties agree to submit
the arbitrability question itself to arbitration? If so, then
the court's standard for reviewing the arbitrator's decision
about that matter should not differ from the standard courts
apply when they review any other matter that parties have
agreed to arbitrate. See AT&T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers, 475 U. S. 643, 649 (1986) (parties may
agree to arbitrate arbitrability); Steelworkers v. Warrior &
Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U. S. 574, 583, n. 7 (1960) (same). That
is to say, the court should give considerable leeway to the
arbitrator, setting aside his or her decision only in certain
narrow circumstances. See, e. g., 9 U. S. C. $ 10. If, on the
other hand, the parties did not agree to submit the arbitrability question itself to arbitration, then the court should decide that question just as it would decide any other question
that the parties did not submit to arbitration, namely, independently. These two answers flow inexorably from the fact
that arbitration is simply a matter of contract between the
parties; it is a way to resolve those disputes--but only those
disputes--that the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration. See, e. g., AT&T Technologies, supra, at 649; Mastrobuono, ante, at 57-58, and n. 9; Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos.
v. Dobson, 513 U. S. 265, 271 (1995); Mitsubishi Motors
Corp., supra, at 625-626.

We agree with First Options, therefore, that a court must
defer to an arbitrator's arbitrability decision when the parties submitted that matter to arbitration. Nevertheless,

514us3$62Z 03-18-97 21:08:07 PAGES OPINPGT
944 FIRST OPTIONS OF CHICAGO, INC. v. KAPLAN

Opinion of the Court
that conclusion does not help First Options win this case.That is because a fair and complete answer to the standardof-review question requires a word about how a court shoulddecide whether the parties have agreed to submit the arbitrability issue to arbitration. And, that word makes clear
that the Kaplans did not agree to arbitrate arbitrability here.When deciding whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a

certain matter (including arbitrability), courts generally(though with a qualification we discuss below) should apply
ordinary state-law principles that govern the formation ofcontracts. See,

e. g., Mastrobuono, ante, at 62-63, and n. 9;
Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 475-476 (1989);
Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S. 483, 492-493, n. 9 (1987); G.
Wilner, 1 Domke on Commercial Arbitration $ 4:04, p. 15 (rev.
ed. Supp. 1993) (hereinafter Domke). The relevant state
law here, for example, would require the court to see
whether the parties objectively revealed an intent to submit
the arbitrability issue to arbitration. See, e. g., Estate of
Jesmer v. Rohlev, 241 Ill. App. 3d 798, 803, 609 N. E. 2d 816,
820 (1993) (law of the State whose law governs the workout
agreement); Burkett v. Allstate Ins. Co., 368 Pa. 600, 608, 534
A. 2d 819, 823-824 (1987) (law of the State where the
Kaplans objected to arbitrability). See generally Mitsubishi Motors, supra, at 626.

This Court, however, has (as we just said) added an important qualification, applicable when courts decide whether a
party has agreed that arbitrators should decide arbitrability:
Courts should not assume that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is "clea[r] and unmistakabl[e]"
evidence that they did so. AT&T Technologies, supra, at
649; see Warrior & Gulf, supra, at 583, n. 7. In this manner
the law treats silence or ambiguity about the question "who
(primarily) should decide arbitrability" differently from the
way it treats silence or ambiguity about the question
"whether a particular merits-related dispute is arbitrable be514us3$62Z 03-18-97 21:08:07 PAGES OPINPGT

945Cite as: 514 U. S. 938 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
cause it is within the scope of a valid arbitration agree-ment"--for in respect to this latter question the law reverses

the presumption. See Mitsubishi Motors, supra, at 626(" `[A]ny doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues
should be resolved in favor of arbitration' ") (quoting Moses
H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460U. S. 1, 24-25 (1983));

Warrior & Gulf, supra, at 582-583.
But, this difference in treatment is understandable. Thelatter question arises when the parties have a contract that

provides for arbitration of some issues. In such circum-stances, the parties likely gave at least some thought to the
scope of arbitration. And, given the law's permissive policies in respect to arbitration, see, e. g., Mitsubishi Motors,
supra, at 626, one can understand why the law would insist
upon clarity before concluding that the parties did not want
to arbitrate a related matter. See Domke $ 12.02, p. 156 (issues will be deemed arbitrable unless "it is clear that the
arbitration clause has not included" them). On the other
hand, the former question--the "who (primarily) should
decide arbitrability" question--is rather arcane. A party
often might not focus upon that question or upon the significance of having arbitrators decide the scope of their own
powers. Cf. Cox, Reflections Upon Labor Arbitration, 72
Harv. L. Rev. 1482, 1508-1509 (1959), cited in Warrior &
Gulf, 363 U. S., at 583, n. 7. And, given the principle that a
party can be forced to arbitrate only those issues it specifically has agreed to submit to arbitration, one can understand
why courts might hesitate to interpret silence or ambiguity
on the "who should decide arbitrability" point as giving the
arbitrators that power, for doing so might too often force
unwilling parties to arbitrate a matter they reasonably
would have thought a judge, not an arbitrator, would decide.
Ibid. See generally Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470
U. S. 213, 219-220 (1985) (Arbitration Act's basic purpose is
to "ensure judicial enforcement of privately made agreements to arbitrate").

946 FIRST OPTIONS OF CHICAGO, INC. v. KAPLAN

Opinion of the Court
On the record before us, First Options cannot show thatthe Kaplans clearly agreed to have the arbitrators decide

(i. e., to arbitrate) the question of arbitrability. First Op-tions relies on the Kaplans' filing with the arbitrators a written memorandum objecting to the arbitrators' jurisdiction.
But merely arguing the arbitrability issue to an arbitratordoes not indicate a clear willingness to arbitrate that issue,

i. e., a willingness to be effectively bound by the arbitrator'sdecision on that point. To the contrary, insofar as the
Kaplans were forcefully objecting to the arbitrators decidingtheir dispute with First Options, one naturally would think
that they did not want the arbitrators to have binding authority over them. This conclusion draws added support
from (1) an obvious explanation for the Kaplans' presence
before the arbitrators (i. e., that MKI, Mr. Kaplan's wholly
owned firm, was arbitrating workout agreement matters);
and (2) Third Circuit law that suggested that the Kaplans
might argue arbitrability to the arbitrators without losing
their right to independent court review, Teamsters v. Western Pennsylvania Motor Carriers Assn., 574 F. 2d 783, 786-
788 (1978); see 19 F. 3d, at 1512, n. 13.

First Options makes several counterarguments: (1) that
the Kaplans had other ways to get an independent court decision on the question of arbitrability without arguing the
issue to the arbitrators (e. g., by trying to enjoin the arbitration, or by refusing to participate in the arbitration and then
defending against a court petition First Options would have
brought to compel arbitration, see 9 U. S. C. $ 4); (2) that permitting parties to argue arbitrability to an arbitrator without being bound by the result would cause delay and waste
in the resolution of disputes; and (3) that the Arbitration Act
therefore requires a presumption that the Kaplans agreed to
be bound by the arbitrators' decision, not the contrary. The
first of these points, however, while true, simply does not say
anything about whether the Kaplans intended to be bound by
the arbitrators' decision. The second point, too, is inconclu514us3$62Z 03-18-97 21:08:07 PAGES OPINPGT

947Cite as: 514 U. S. 938 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
sive, for factual circumstances vary too greatly to permit aconfident conclusion about whether allowing the arbitrator to

make an initial (but independently reviewable) arbitrabilitydetermination would, in general, slow down the dispute resolution process. And, the third point is legally erroneous, forthere is no strong arbitration-related policy favoring First
Options in respect to its particular argument here. Afterall, the basic objective in this area is not to resolve disputes
in the quickest manner possible, no matter what the parties'wishes,

Dean Witter Reynolds, supra, at 219-220, but toensure that commercial arbitration agreements, like other

contracts, " `are enforced according to their terms,' " Mastrobuono, ante, at 54 (quoting Volt Information Sciences, 489U. S., at 479), and according to the intentions of the parties,

Mitsubishi Motors, 473 U. S., at 626. See Allied-Bruce, 513U. S., at 271. That policy favors the Kaplans, not First
Options.We conclude that, because the Kaplans did not clearly
agree to submit the question of arbitrability to arbitration,the Court of Appeals was correct in finding that the arbitrability of the Kaplan/First Options dispute was subject to in-dependent review by the courts.

III
We turn next to the standard a court of appeals shouldapply when reviewing a district court decision that refuses

to vacate, see 9 U. S. C. $ 10 (1988 ed., Supp. V), or confirms,see $ 9, an arbitration award. Although the Third Circuit
sometimes used the words "de novo" to describe this stand-ard, its opinion makes clear that it simply believes (as do all
Circuits but one) that there is no special standard governingits review of a district court's decision in these circumstances. Rather, review of, for example, a district court de-cision confirming an arbitration award on the ground that the
parties agreed to submit their dispute to arbitration shouldproceed like review of any other district court decision find514us3$62Z 03-18-97 21:08:07 PAGES OPINPGT
948 FIRST OPTIONS OF CHICAGO, INC. v. KAPLAN

Opinion of the Court
ing an agreement between parties, e. g., accepting findings offact that are not "clearly erroneous" but deciding questions

of law de novo. See 19 F. 3d, at 1509.One Court of Appeals, the Eleventh Circuit, has said something different. Because of federal policy favoring arbitration, that court says that it applies a specially lenient "abuseof discretion" standard (even as to questions of law) when

reviewing district court decisions that confirm (but not thosethat set aside) arbitration awards. See,

e. g., Robbins v.
Day, 954 F. 2d, at 681-682. First Options asks us to holdthat the Eleventh Circuit's view is correct.

We believe, however, that the majority of Circuits is right
in saying that courts of appeals should apply ordinary, not
special, standards when reviewing district court decisions
upholding arbitration awards. For one thing, it is undesirable to make the law more complicated by proliferating review standards without good reasons. More importantly,
the reviewing attitude that a court of appeals takes toward
a district court decision should depend upon "the respective
institutional advantages of trial and appellate courts," not
upon what standard of review will more likely produce a particular substantive result. Salve Regina College v. Russell,
499 U. S. 225, 231-233 (1991). The law, for example, tells all
courts (trial and appellate) to give administrative agencies a
degree of legal leeway when they review certain interpretations of the law that those agencies have made. See, e. g.,
Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,
Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843-844 (1984). But no one, to our
knowledge, has suggested that this policy of giving leeway
to agencies means that a court of appeals should give extra
leeway to a district court decision that upholds an agency.
Similarly, courts grant arbitrators considerable leeway when
reviewing most arbitration decisions; but that fact does not
mean that appellate courts should give extra leeway to district courts that uphold arbitrators. First Options argues
that the Arbitration Act is special because the Act, in one

514us3$62Z 03-18-97 21:08:07 PAGES OPINPGT

949Cite as: 514 U. S. 938 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
section, allows courts of appeals to conduct interlocutoryreview of certain antiarbitration district court rulings (e. g.,

orders enjoining arbitrations), but not those upholding ar-bitration (e. g., orders refusing to enjoin arbitrations). 9
U. S. C. $ 16 (1988 ed., Supp. V). But that portion of the Actgoverns the timing of review; it is therefore too weak a support for the distinct claim that the court of appeals shoulduse a different

standard when reviewing certain districtcourt decisions. The Act says nothing about standards of

review.We conclude that the Court of Appeals used the proper
standards for reviewing the District Court's arbitrabilitydeterminations.

IV
Finally, First Options argues that, even if we rule againstit on the standard-of-review questions, we nonetheless

should hold that the Court of Appeals erred in its ultimateconclusion that the merits of the Kaplan/First Options dispute were not arbitrable. This factbound issue is beyondthe scope of the questions we agreed to review.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Memorandum of Justice Stevens, respecting the denial ofcertiorari.
Petitioner raises the question whether executing a prisoner whohas already spent some 17 years on death row violates the Eighth
Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.Though the importance and novelty of the question presented by
this certiorari petition are sufficient to warrant review by thisCourt, those factors also provide a principled basis for postponing
consideration of the issue until after it has been addressed byother courts. See, e. g., McCray v. New York, 461 U. S. 961 (1983)
(Stevens, J., respecting denial of certiorari).Though novel, petitioner's claim is not without foundation. In
Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153 (1976), this Court held that theEighth Amendment does not prohibit capital punishment. Our
decision rested in large part on the grounds that (1) the deathpenalty was considered permissible by the Framers, see id., at
177 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.), and (2) thedeath penalty might serve "two principal social purposes: retribution and deterrence," id., at 183.It is arguable that neither ground retains any force for prisoners who have spent some 17 years under a sentence of death.Such a delay, if it ever occurred, certainly would have been rare
in 1789, and thus the practice of the Framers would not justify adenial of petitioner's claim. Moreover, after such an extended
time, the acceptable state interest in retribution has arguablybeen satisfied by the severe punishment already inflicted. Over
a century ago, this Court recognized that "when a prisoner sen-tenced by a court to death is confined in the penitentiary awaiting
the execution of the sentence, one of the most horrible feelingsto which he can be subjected during that time is the uncertainty
during the whole of it." In re Medley, 134 U. S. 160, 172 (1890).

1046 OCTOBER TERM, 1994

Memorandum of Stevens, J. 514 U. S.
If the Court accurately described the effect of uncertainty inMedley, which involved a period of four weeks, see ibid., that
description should apply with even greater force in the case ofdelays that last for many years.* Finally, the additional deterrent effect from an actual execution now, on the one hand, ascompared to 17 years on death row followed by the prisoner's
continued incarceration for life, on the other, seems minimal.See, e. g., Coleman v. Balkcom, 451 U. S. 949, 952 (1981) (

Stevens, J., respecting denial of certiorari) ("[T]he deterrent valueof incarceration during that period of uncertainty may well be

comparable to the consequences of the ultimate step itself "). AsJustice White noted, when the death penalty "ceases realistically
to further these purposes, . . . its imposition would then be thepointless and needless extinction of life with only marginal contributions to any discernible social or public purposes. A penaltywith such negligible returns to the State would be patently excessive and cruel and unusual punishment violative of the EighthAmendment." Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, 312 (1972)
(opinion concurring in judgment); see also Gregg v. Georgia, 428U. S., at 183 ("[T]he sanction imposed cannot be so totally without
penological justification that it results in the gratuitous inflictionof suffering").

Petitioner's argument draws further strength from conclusionsby English jurists that "execution after inordinate delay would

*See also People v. Anderson, 6 Cal. 3d 628, 649, 493 P. 2d 880, 894 (1972)("The cruelty of capital punishment lies not only in the execution itself and
the pain incident thereto, but also in the dehumanizing effects of the lengthyimprisonment prior to execution during which the judicial and administrative
procedures essential to due process of law are carried out. Penologists andmedical experts agree that the process of carrying out a verdict of death is
often so degrading and brutalizing to the human spirit as to constitute psy-chological torture") (footnote omitted); Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238,
288-289 (1972) (Brennan, J., concurring) ("[T]he prospect of pending execu-tion exacts a frightful toll during the inevitable long wait between the imposition of sentence and the actual infliction of death"); Solesbee v. Balkcom,339 U. S. 9, 14 (1950) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting) ("In the history of murder,
the onset of insanity while awaiting execution of a death sentence is not arare phenomenon"); Suffolk County District Attorney v. Watson, 381 Mass.
648, 673, 411 N. E. 2d 1274, 1287 (1980) (Braucher, J., concurring) (deathpenalty is unconstitutional under State Constitution in part because "[i]t will
be carried out only after agonizing months and years of uncertainty"); id.,at 675-686, 411 N. E. 2d, at 1289-1295 (Liacos, J., concurring).

have infringed the prohibition against cruel and unusual punish-ments to be found in section 10 of the Bill of Rights 1689." Riley
v. Attorney General of Jamaica, [1983] 1 A. C. 719, 734, 3 AllE. R. 469, 478 (P. C. 1983) (Lord Scarman, dissenting, joined by
Lord Brightman). As we have previously recognized, that sec-tion is undoubtedly the precursor of our own Eighth Amendment.
See, e. g., Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S., at 169-170; Harmelin v.Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 966 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in
judgment).Finally, as petitioner notes, the highest courts in other countries have found arguments such as petitioner's to be persuasive.See Pratt v. Attorney General of Jamaica, [1994] 2 A. C. 1, 4 All
E. R. 769 (P. C. 1993) (en banc); id., at 32-33, 4 All E. R., at785-786 (collecting cases).

Closely related to the basic question presented by the petitionis a question concerning the portion of the 17-year delay that
should be considered in the analysis. There may well be constitu-tional significance to the reasons for the various delays that have
occurred in petitioner's case. It may be appropriate to distin-guish, for example, among delays resulting from (a) a petitioner's
abuse of the judicial system by escape or repetitive, frivolousfilings; (b) a petitioner's legitimate exercise of his right to review;
and (c) negligence or deliberate action by the State. Thus,though English cases indicate that the prisoner should not be held
responsible for delays occurring in the latter two categories, seeid., at 33, 4 All E. R., at 786, it is at least arguable that some
portion of the time that has elapsed since this petitioner was firstsentenced to death in 1978 should be excluded from the calculus.

As I have pointed out on past occasions, the Court's denial ofcertiorari does not constitute a ruling on the merits. See, e. g.,
Barber v. Tennessee, 513 U. S. 1184 (1995); Singleton v. Commis-sioner, 439 U. S. 940, 942 (1978) (Stevens, J., respecting denial
of certiorari). Often, a denial of certiorari on a novel issue willpermit the state and federal courts to "serve as laboratories in
which the issue receives further study before it is addressed bythis Court." McCray v. New York, 461 U. S., at 963. Petitioner's
claim, with its legal complexity and its potential for far-reachingconsequences, seems an ideal example of one which would benefit
from such further study.

Justice Breyer agrees with Justice Stevens that the issueis an important undecided one.

barred under, this Court's decision in Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &

Inc., p. 211.
