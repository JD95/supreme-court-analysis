Syllabus 
burden  when  petitioner  testified  to  that  effect.  Petitioner  contends 
that  she  cannot  have  formed  the  necessary  mens  rea  because  she  did 
not  freely  choose  to  commit  the  crimes.  However,  while  the  duress 
defense  may  excuse  conduct  that  would  otherwise  be  punishable,  see 
United States v.  Bailey, 444 U. S. 394, 409-410, the existence of duress 
normally  does  not  controvert  any  of  the  elements  of  the  offense  itself. 
The fact that petitioner's crimes are statutory offenses with no counter-
part in the common law supports this conclusion.  The jury instructions 
were  consistent  with  the  requirement  that  the  Government  prove  the 
mental  states  specified  in  $$ 922(a)(6)  and  924(a)(1)(D)  and  did  not  run 
afoul  of  due  process  by  placing  the  burden  on  petitioner  to  establish 
duress by a preponderance of the evidence.  Pp. 5-8. 

2.  Modern common law does not require the Government to bear the 
burden  of  disproving  petitioner's  duress  defense  beyond  a  reasonable 
doubt.  The long-established common-law rule, which places the burden 
of  proving  that  defense  on  the  defendant,  was  not  upset  by  Davis  v. 
United  States,  160  U. S.  469.  There,  the  Court  interpreted  a  defend-
ant's  insanity  to  controvert  the  necessary  mens  rea  for  a  murder  com-
mitted "feloniously, wilfully, and of his malice aforethought," id., at 474, 
and required the Government to prove the defendant's sanity beyond a 
reasonable  doubt  because  the  evidence  tending  to  prove  insanity  also 
tended to disprove an essential element of the offense.  The duress evi-
dence  that  petitioner  adduced  at  trial  does  not  contradict  or  tend  to 
disprove any element of her statutory offenses.  She is also not helped 
by the resulting "Davis rule," which was not constitutionally mandated, 
and  which  Congress  overruled  by  statute,  requiring  a  defendant  to 
prove insanity by clear and convincing evidence. 

Petitioner's reliance on Davis also ignores the fact that federal crimes 
are  "solely  creatures  of  statute,"  Liparota  v.  United  States,  471  U. S. 
419,  424,  and  thus  the  Court  must  effectuate  the  duress  defense  as 
Congress  "may  have  contemplated"  it  in  the  context  of  these  specific 
offenses,  United  States  v.  Oakland  Cannabis  Buyers'  Cooperative, 
532 U. S. 483, 490, n. 3.  The Court can assume that, when passing the 
relevant  1968  Act,  Congress  was  familiar  with  the  long-established 
common-law  rule  and  the  rule  of  McKelvey  v.  United  States,  260  U. S. 
353, 357--that  the one relying on  an affirmative  defense must  set it up 
and  establish  it--and  would  have  expected  federal  courts  to  apply  a 
similar  approach to  any  affirmative  defense  or  excuse  for  violating  the 
new  law.  To  accept  petitioner's  contrary  hypothesis  that  Davis  dra-
matically upset well-settled law would require an overwhelming consen-
sus  among  federal  courts  placing  the  burden  on  the  Government,  but 
conflict among the Circuits demonstrates that such consensus has never 
existed.  For  a  similar  reason,  no  weight  is  due  the  1962  Model  Penal

Opinion of the Court 
Code.  There  is  no  evidence  that  Congress  endorsed  the  Code's  views 
or  incorporated  them  into  the  1968  Act.  In  fact,  when  Congress 
amended  the  Act  to  add  a  mens  rea  requirement,  it  punished  "willful" 
violations, a mental state not embraced by the Code.  Effectuating the 
affirmative  defense  as  Congress  may  have  contemplated  it,  the  Court 
presumes that, in the context of the firearms offenses here and the long-
established common-law rule, Congress intended petitioner to bear the 
burden  of  proving  the  duress  defense  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evi-
dence.  Pp. 8-17.

4  DIXON  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
she knew she was under indictment when she made the pur-chases and  that she knew doing so was a crime; her defense 

was  that  she  acted  under  duress  because  her  boyfriend threatened  to  kill  her  or  hurt  her  daughters  if  she  did  not 
buy the guns for him. Petitioner  contends  that  the  trial  judge's  instructions  to 
the  jury  erroneously required  her  to prove  duress by  a pre-ponderance of the evidence instead of requiring the Govern-
ment to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she did not act under  duress.  The  Court  of  Appeals  rejected  petitioner's 
contention,  413  F.  3d  520  (CA5  2005);  given  contrary  treat-ment of the issue by other federal courts,

1  we granted certio-

rari, 546 U. S. 1135 (2006).  I 

At trial, in her request for jury instructions on her defense of  duress,  petitioner  contended  that  she  "should  have  the 
burden  of production,  and then  that  the  Government  should be  required  to  disprove  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  the  du-
ress."  App. 300.  Petitioner admitted that this request was contrary to Fifth Circuit precedent, and the trial court,  cor-
rectly finding itself bound by Circuit precedent, denied peti-tioner's request. 

Ibid.  Instead, the judge's instructions to the  jury  defined  the  elements  of  the  duress  defense 

2  and 

1 Cf.,  e. g., United  States v.  Talbott, 78 F. 3d 1183,  1186  (CA7 1996)  (per 
curiam); United States v.  Riffe, 28 F. 3d 565, 568, n. 2 (CA6 1994); United 
States v.  Simpson, 979 F. 2d 1282, 1287 (CA8 1992). 

2 There is no federal statute defining the elements of the duress defense. 

We have not specified the elements of the defense, see, e. g., United States 
v. Bailey, 444 U. S. 394, 409-410 (1980), and need not do so today.  Instead, 
we presume the accuracy  of the  District  Court's description of these  ele-
ments:  (1)  The  defendant  was  under  an  unlawful  and  imminent  threat  of 
such a nature as to induce a well-grounded apprehension of death or seri-
ous  bodily  injury;  (2)  the  defendant  had  not  recklessly  or  negligently 
placed  herself  in  a  situation  in  which  it  was  probable  that  she  would  be 
forced  to  perform  the  criminal  conduct;  (3)  the  defendant  had  no  reason-
able, legal alternative to violating the law, that is, a chance both to refuse 
to  perform  the  criminal  act  and  also  to  avoid  the  threatened  harm;  and,

Opinion of the Court 
stated  that  petitioner  has  "the  burden  of  proof  to  establish the  defense  of  duress  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence." 

Id., at 312. Petitioner  argues  here,  as  she  did  in  the  District  Court 
and the Court of Appeals, that federal law requires the Gov-ernment  to  bear  the  burden  of  disproving  her  defense  be-
yond a reasonable doubt and that the trial court's erroneous instruction  on  this  point  entitles  her  to  a  new  trial.  There 
are  two  aspects  to  petitioner's  argument  in  support  of  her proposed  instruction  that  merit  separate  discussion.  First, 
petitioner contends that her defense "controverted the mens 
rea required for conviction" and therefore that the Due Proc-ess Clause requires the  Government  to retain  the burden of 

persuasion  on  that  element.  Brief  for  Petitioner  41.  Sec-ond,  petitioner  argues  that  the  Fifth  Circuit's  rule  is  "con-
trary to modern common law."  Id., at 14. 

II 
The crimes for which petitioner was convicted require that she have acted " knowingly, " $ 922(a)(6), or "willfully, " 

$ 924(a)(1)(D).3  As  we  have  explained,  "unless  the  text  of the  statute  dictates  a  different  result,  the  term  `knowingly' 
merely  requires  proof  of  knowledge  of  the  facts  that  con-stitute  the  offense."  Bryan  v.  United  States,  524  U. S.  184, 
193  (1998)  (footnote  omitted).  And  the  term  "willfully"  in $ 924(a)(1)(D)  requires  a  defendant  to  have  "acted  with 
knowledge  that  his  conduct  was  unlawful."  Ibid.  In  this case,  then,  the  Government  bore  the  burden  of  proving  be-
yond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  petitioner  knew she  was  mak-
(4) that a direct causal relationship may be reasonably anticipated between 
the  criminal  act  and  the  avoidance  of  the  threatened  harm.  See  App. 
312-313;  see  generally  United  States  v.  Harper,  802  F.  2d  115,  118  (CA5 
1986). 

3 Although  $ 922(n)  does  not  contain  a  mens  rea  requirement,  the  rele-

vant sentencing provision, $ 924(a)(1)(D), requires that a violation be com-
mitted willfully.

Opinion of the Court 
ing  false  statements  in  connection  with  the  acquisition  of 
firearms  and  that  she  knew  she  was  breaking  the  law  when 
she  acquired  a  firearm  while  under  indictment.  See  In  re 
Winship,  397  U. S.  358,  364  (1970).  Although  the  Govern-
ment  may  have  proved  these  elements  in  other  ways,  it 
clearly  met  its  burden  when  petitioner  testified  that  she 
knowingly  committed  certain  acts--she  put  a  false  address 
on the forms she completed to purchase the firearms, falsely 
claimed  that  she  was  the  actual  buyer  of  the  firearms,  and 
falsely stated that she was not under indictment at the time 
of  the  purchase--and  when  she  testified  that  she  knew  she 
was  breaking  the  law  when,  as  an  individual  under  indict-
ment  at  the  time,  she  purchased  a  firearm.  App.  221-222. 

Petitioner contends, however, that she cannot have formed 
the necessary mens rea for these crimes because she did not 
freely  choose  to  commit  the  acts  in  question.  But  even  if 
we  assume  that  petitioner's  will  was  overborne  by  the 
threats  made  against  her  and  her  daughters,  she  still  knew 
that she was making false statements and knew that she was 
breaking the  law by buying a  firearm.  The duress defense, 
like  the  defense  of  necessity  that  we  considered  in  United 
States  v.  Bailey,  444  U. S.  394,  409-410  (1980),  may  excuse 
conduct  that  would  otherwise  be  punishable,  but  the  exist-
ence  of  duress  normally  does  not  controvert  any  of  the  ele-
ments  of  the  offense  itself.4  As  we  explained  in  Bailey, 
"[c]riminal  liability  is  normally  based  upon  the  concurrence 
of  two  factors,  `an  evil-meaning  mind  [and]  and  evil-doing 
hand . .  . .' "   Id., at 402 (quoting Morissette v.  United States, 

4 As the Government recognized at oral argument, there may be crimes 
where  the  nature  of  the  mens  rea  would  require  the  Government  to  dis-
prove the existence of duress beyond a reasonable doubt.  See Tr. of Oral 
Arg.  26-27;  see  also,  e. g.,  1  W.  LaFave,  Substantive  Criminal  Law  $ 5.1, 
p.  333  (2d  ed.  2003)  (hereinafter  LaFave)  (explaining  that  some  common-
law  crimes  require  that  the  crime  be  done  " `maliciously' ");  Black's  Law 
Dictionary 968 (7th ed. 1999) (defining malice as "[t]he intent, without jus-
tification or excuse, to commit a wrongful act").

Opinion of the Court 
342 U. S. 246, 251 (1952)).  Like the defense of necessity, the 
defense  of  duress  does  not  negate  a  defendant's  criminal 
state of mind when the applicable offense requires a defend-
ant  to  have  acted  knowingly  or  willfully;  instead,  it  allows 
the  defendant  to  "avoid  liability  .  .  .  because  coercive  condi-
tions  or  necessity  negates  a  conclusion  of  guilt  even  though 
the  necessary mens  rea was  present."  Bailey, 444  U. S.,  at 
402.5 

The  fact  that  petitioner's  crimes  are  statutory  offenses 
that  have  no  counterpart  in  the  common  law  also  supports 
our  conclusion  that  her  duress  defense  in  no  way  disproves 
an  element  of  those  crimes.  We  have  observed  that  "[t]he 
definition  of  the  elements  of  a  criminal  offense  is  entrusted 
to  the  legislature,  particularly  in  the  case  of  federal  crimes, 
which  are  solely  creatures  of  statute."  Liparota  v.  United 
States,  471  U. S.  419,  424  (1985).  Here,  consistent  with  the 
movement  away  from  the  traditional  dichotomy  of  general 
versus specific intent and toward a  more specifically defined 
hierarchy  of  culpable  mental  states,  see  Bailey,  444  U. S., 
at  403-404,  Congress  defined  the  crimes  at  issue  to  punish 
defendants  who  act  "knowingly,"  $ 922(a)(6),  or  "willfully," 

$ 924(a)(1)(D).  It is these specific mental states, rather than 
some  vague  "evil  mind,"  Brief  for  Petitioner  42,  or  " `crimi-
nal'  intent,"  Martin  v.  Ohio,  480  U. S.  228,  235  (1987),  that 
the  Government  is  required  to  prove  beyond  a  reasonable 
doubt,  see  Patterson  v.  New  York,  432  U. S.  197,  211,  n.  12 
(1977)  ("The  applicability  of  the  reasonable-doubt  standard, 

5 Professor LaFave has explained the duress defense as follows: 
"The  rationale  of  the  defense  is  not  that  the  defendant,  faced  with  the 
unnerving threat of harm unless he does an act which violates the literal 
language of the criminal law, somehow loses his mental capacity to commit 
the  crime  in  question.  Nor  is  it  that  the  defendant  has  not  engaged  in 
a  voluntary  act.  Rather  it  is  that,  even  though  he  has  done  the  act 
the  crime  requires  and  has  the  mental  state  which  the  crime  requires, 
his  conduct  which  violates  the  literal  language  of  the  criminal  law  is 
excused . . . ."   2  LaFave  $  9.7(a), at 73 (footnotes omitted).

8  DIXON  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
however, has always been dependent on how a State defines the  offense  that  is  charged  in  any  given  case").  The  jury 

instructions  in  this  case  were  consistent  with  this  require-ment  and,  as  such,  did  not  run  afoul  of  the  Due  Process 
Clause  when  they  placed  the  burden  on  petitioner  to  estab-lish  the  existence  of  duress  by  a  preponderance  of  the 
evidence.  III 

Having  found  no  constitutional  basis  for  placing  upon  the Government the burden of disproving petitioner's duress de-
fense  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt,  we  next  address  petition-er's  argument  that  the  modern  common  law  requires  the 
Government to bear that burden.  In making this argument, petitioner  recognizes  that, until the  end of the 19th  century, 
common-law  courts  generally  adhered  to  the  rule  that  "the proponent of an issue bears  the burden of persuasion  on the 
factual  premises  for  applying  the  rule."  Fletcher,  Two Kinds  of  Legal  Rules:  A  Comparative  Study  of  Burden-ofPersuasion Practices in Criminal Cases, 77 Yale L. J. 880, 898 (1967-1968).  In  petitioner's  view,  however,  two  important 
developments  have  established  a  contrary  common-law  rule that  now  prevails  in  federal  courts:  this  Court's  decision  in 
Davis v.  United States, 160 U. S. 469 (1895), which placed the burden on the Government to prove a defendant's sanity, and 
the publication of the Model Penal Code in 1962. Although  undisputed  in  this  case,  it  bears  repeating  that, 
at  common  law,  the  burden  of  proving  "affirmative  de-fenses--indeed, `all . . .  circumstances of justification, excuse 
or  alleviation'--rested  on  the  defendant."  Patterson,  432 U. S.,  at  202  (quoting  4  W.  Blackstone,  Commentaries  *201); 
see  also  Martin v.  Ohio,  480  U. S.,  at  235;  Mullaney  v.  Wil-bur,  421  U. S.  684,  693  (1975).  This  common-law  rule  ac-
cords with the general evidentiary rule that "the burdens of producing  evidence  and  of  persuasion  with  regard  to  any 
given  issue  are  both  generally  allocated  to  the  same  party." 2  J.  Strong,  McCormick  on  Evidence  $ 337,  p.  415  (5th  ed.

Opinion of the Court 
1999).  And,  in  the  context  of  the  defense  of  duress,  it  ac-cords with the doctrine that "where the facts with regard to 

an issue lie peculiarly in the knowledge of a party, that party has the burden of proving the issue." 

Id., at 413.  Although 
she  claims  that  the  common-law  rule  placing  the  burden  on a defendant  to  prove  the  existence  of  duress "was  the  prod-

uct of flawed reasoning," petitioner accepts that this was the 
general  rule,  at  least  until  this  Court's  decision  in  Davis. Brief  for  Petitioner  18.  According  to  petitioner,  however, 

Davis initiated a revolution that overthrew the old common-law rule and established her proposed rule in its place. 

Davis  itself,  however,  does  not  support  petitioner's  posi-
tion.  In that case, we reviewed a defendant's conviction for 
having  committed  murder  "feloniously,  wilfully,  and  of  his 
malice aforethought."  160 U. S., at 474.  It was undisputed 
that the prosecution's evidence, "if alone considered, made it 
the duty of the jury to return a verdict of guilty of the crime 
charged";  the  defendant,  however, adduced  evidence  at  trial 
tending to show that he did not  have the  mental capacity to 
form  the  requisite  intent.  Id.,  at  475.  At  issue  before  the 
Court  was  the  correctness  of  the  trial  judge's  instruction  to 
the jury that the law " `presumes every man is sane, and the 
burden  of  showing  it  is  not  true  is  upon  the  party  who  as-
serts  it.' "  Id.,  at  476.  Under  this  instruction,  "if  the  evi-
dence was in equilibrio as to the accused being sane, that is, 
capable  of  comprehending  the  nature  and  effect  of  his  acts, 
he  was  to  be  treated  just  as  he  would  be  if  there  were  no 
defence of insanity or if there were an entire absence of proof 
that he was insane."  Id., at 479. 

In  reversing  the  defendant's  conviction,  we  found  our-
selves "unable to assent to the doctrine that in a prosecution 
for murder . . . it is the duty of the jury to convict where the 
evidence  is  equally  balanced  on  the  issue  as  to  the  sanity  of 
the accused at the time of the killing."  Id., at 484 (emphasis 
added).  Instead,  we  concluded  that  this  defendant  was 
"entitled to an acquittal of the specific crime charged if upon

Opinion of the Court 
all  the  evidence  there  is  reasonable  doubt  whether  he  was capable  in  law  of  committing  [the]  crime." 

Ibid.  (emphasis 
added).  Our  opinion  focused  on  the  "definition  of  murder," explaining  that  "it  is  of  the  very  essence  of  that  heinous 

crime  that  it  be  committed  by  a  person  of  `sound  memory and  discretion,'  and  with  `malice  aforethought.' " 

Ibid. 
Reviewing  "the  adjudged  cases"  and  "elementary  treatises 
upon criminal law," we found that "[a]ll admit that the crime of murder necessarily involves the possession by the accused 

of such mental capacity as will render him criminally respon-sible  for  his  acts." 

Id.,  at  485.  Thus,  when  we  ultimately 
found that the burden of proving the accused's sanity rested on the Government, our holding rested on the conclusion that 

"[Davis']  guilt  cannot  be  said  to  have  been  proved  be-yond  a  reasonable  doubt--his  will  and  his  acts  cannot 
be  held  to  have  joined  in  perpetrating  the  murder charged--if  the  jury,  upon  all  the  evidence,  have  a  rea-
sonable doubt whether he was legally capable of commit-ting crime, or (which is the same thing) whether he wil-
fully, deliberately, unlawfully, and of malice aforethought 
took  the  life  of  the  deceased.  As  the  crime  of  murder 
involves sufficient capacity to distinguish between right 
and  wrong,  the  legal  interpretation  of  every  verdict  of 
guilty  as  charged  is  that  the  jury  believed  from  all  the 
evidence  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  the  accused 
was guilty, and was therefore responsible, criminally, for 
his  acts.  How  then  upon principle  or  consistently  with 
humanity  can  a  verdict  of  guilty  be  properly  returned, 
if  the  jury  entertain a  reasonable  doubt  as  to the  exist-
ence  of  a  fact  which  is  essential  to  guilt,  namely,  the 
capacity  in  law  of  the  accused  to  commit  that  crime?" 
Id., at 488. 

Our opinion in Davis, then, interpreted a  defendant's san-
ity  to  controvert  the  necessary  mens  rea  for  the  crime  of

Opinion of the Court 
murder  committed  "feloniously,  wilfully,  and  of  his  malice 
aforethought," id., at 474, as "[o]ne who takes human life can-
not be said to be actuated by malice aforethought, or to have 
deliberately  intended  to  take  life,  or  to  have  `a  wicked,  de-
praved,  and  malignant  heart,' . . .  unless  at  the  time  he  had 
sufficient  mind  to  comprehend  the  criminality  or  the  right 
and wrong of such an act," id., at 485.  We required the Gov-
ernment to prove the defendant's sanity beyond a reasonable 
doubt  because  the  evidence  that  tended  to  prove  insanity 
also  tended  to  disprove  an  essential  element  of  the  offense 
charged.  See  Davis  v.  United  States,  165  U. S.  373,  378 
(1897)  ("[T]he  fact  of  sanity,  as  any  other  essential  fact  in 
the  case,  must  be  established  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  jury 
beyond a reasonable doubt" (emphasis added)).  Whether or 
not this reasoning correctly treated insanity as negating the 
mens  rea  for  murder  as  defined  in  the  statute  at  issue, 
cf.  n.  4,  supra,  it  does  not  help  petitioner:  The  evidence  of 
duress  she  adduced  at  trial  does  not  contradict  or  tend  to 
disprove  any  element  of  the  statutory  offenses  that  she 
committed. 

Nor  does  the  proposition  for  which  Davis  has  come  to 
stand  help  petitioner's  cause.  Although  written  more  nar-
rowly in the context of a prosecution for the crime of murder, 
Davis  was  later  interpreted  to  establish  a  general  "rule  for 
federal  prosecutions  .  .  .  that  an  accused  is  `entitled  to  an 
acquittal  of  the  specific  crime  charged  if  upon  all  the  evi-
dence  there  is  reasonable  doubt  whether  he  was  capable  in 
law of committing crime.' "  Leland v.  Oregon, 343 U. S. 790, 
797  (1952)  (quoting  Davis,  160  U. S.,  at  484);  see  also  Lynch 
v.  Overholser,  369  U. S.  705,  713  (1962)  (explaining  that  the 
Davis  rule  applied  in  all  federal  courts).  After  Davis,  if  a 
federal  defendant  introduced  sufficient  evidence  to  raise  a 
reasonable  doubt  as  to  his  sanity,  it  was  sufficient  to  create 
a  question  for  the  jury  on  which  the  Government  bore  the 
ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.

12  DIXON  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
See, e. g., Hall v.  United  States, 295  F. 2d 26,  28 (CA4 1961); 
Holloway v.  United  States,  148 F. 2d 665,  666  (CADC 1945); 
Post v.  United States, 135 F. 1, 10 (CA5 1905). In  apparent  recognition  of  the  fact  that 

Davis  relied  on 
the heightened mens rea applicable to the particular statute at  issue,  we  held  in 

Leland  that  this  rule  was  not  constitu-
tionally mandated, 343 U. S., at 797, and Congress overruled 
it  by  statute  in  1984,  requiring  a  defendant  to  prove  his  in-sanity  by  clear  and  convincing  evidence,  98  Stat.  2057,  codi-

fied  at  18  U. S. C.  $ 17(b).  Moreover,  Congress  has  treated the  defense  of  insanity  differently  from  that  of  duress  not 
only by codifying it but by requiring  defendants who intend 
to  rely  on  an  insanity  defense  to  provide  advance  notice  to 
the Government.  See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 12.2(a).  Thus, 
even if the rule arising from Davis may have once been rele-
vant to an evaluation of other affirmative defenses, Congress' 
differential  treatment  of  the  insanity  defense  and  its  rejec-
tion of the Davis rule are inconsistent with petitioner's invi-
tation to follow Davis' lead in this case. 

Indeed, petitioner's reliance on Davis ignores the fact that 
federal  crimes  "are  solely  creatures  of  statute,"  Liparota, 
471 U. S., at 424, and therefore that we are required to effec-
tuate  the  duress  defense  as  Congress  "may  have  contem-
plated"  it  in  the  context  of  these  specific  offenses,  United 
States  v.  Oakland  Cannabis  Buyers'  Cooperative,  532  U. S. 
483,  491,  n.  3  (2001)  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted);  see 
also  id.,  at  499  (Stevens,

Stat.  197.  There  is  no  evidence  in  the  Act's  structure  or 
history  that  Congress  actually  considered  the  question  of 
how  the  duress  defense  should  work  in  this  context,  and 
there  is  no  suggestion  that  the  offenses  at  issue  are  incom-
patible  with  a  defense  of  duress.6  Cf.  Oakland  Cannabis 
Buyers' Cooperative, 532 U. S., at 491.  Assuming that a de-
fense of duress is available to the statutory crimes at issue,7 
then,  we  must  determine  what  that  defense  would  look  like 
as Congress "may have contemplated" it. 

As  discussed  above,  the  common  law  long  required  the 
defendant  to  bear  the  burden  of  proving  the  existence  of 
duress.  Similarly,  even  where  Congress  has  enacted  an 
affirmative  defense  in  the  proviso  of  a  statute,  the  "settled 
rule  in  this  jurisdiction  [is]  that  an  indictment  or  other 
pleading  .  .  .  need  not  negative  the  matter  of  an  exception 
made  by  a  proviso  or  other  distinct  clause . . . and  that  it  is 
incumbent  on  one  who  relies  on  such  an  exception  to  set  it 
up  and  establish  it."  McKelvey  v.  United  States,  260  U. S. 
353,  357  (1922);  see  also  United  States  v.  Dickson,  15  Pet. 
141,  165  (1841)  (calling  this  "the  general  rule  of  law  which 
has  always  prevailed,  and  become  consecrated  almost  as  a 
maxim in the interpretation of statutes").  Even though the 
Safe Streets Act does not mention the defense of duress, we 
can  safely  assume  that  the  1968  Congress  was  familiar  with 

6 While Congress' findings in support of the Safe Streets Act show that 
Congress  was  concerned  because  "the  ease  with  which  any  person  can 
acquire firearms . . . is a significant factor in the prevalence of lawlessness 
and violent crime in the United States," $ 901(a)(2), 82 Stat. 225, it would 
be unrealistic to read this concern with the proliferation of firearm-based 
violent  crime  as  implicitly  doing  away  with  a  defense  as  strongly  rooted 
in history as the duress defense, see, e. g., 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 
on the Laws of England 30 (1769). 

7 We  have  previously  made  this  assumption  when  addressing  common-

law affirmative defenses, see United States v.  Oakland Cannabis Buyers' 
Cooperative,  532  U. S.  483,  491  (2001);  Bailey,  444  U. S.,  at  410,  and  the 
parties give us no reason to question it here.

Opinion of the Court 
both the long-established common-law rule 8  and the rule ap-plied  in  McKelvey  and  that  it  would  have  expected  federal 

courts to apply a similar approach to any affirmative defense that might be asserted as a justification or excuse for violat-
ing the new law.9 This conclusion is surely more reasonable than petitioner's 
hypothesis that Davis dramatically upset a well-settled rule of law.  Petitioner cites only one federal case decided before 
1968  for  the  proposition  that  it  has  been  well  established  in federal  law  that  the  Government  bears  the  burden  of  dis-
proving  duress  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.  But  that  case involved  a  defendant's  claim  that  he  "lacked  the  specific 
intent  to  defraud  required  by  the  statute  for  the  reason that  he  committed  the  offense  under  duress  and  coercion." 
Johnson  v.  United  States,  291  F.  2d  150,  152  (CA8  1961). Thus, when the Court of Appeals explained that "there is no 
burden upon the defendant to prove his defense of coercion," 
id., at 155, that statement is best understood in context as a corollary  to  the  by-then-unremarkable  proposition  that  "the 

burden of proof rests upon the Government to prove the de-fendant's  guilt  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt," 

ibid.  Properly understood, Johnson provides petitioner little help in her up-

hill  struggle  to  prove  that  a  dramatic  shift  in  the  federal common-law rule occurred between Davis and the enactment 
of the Safe Streets Act in 1968. Indeed, for us to be able to accept petitioner's proposition, 
we  would  need  to  find  an  overwhelming  consensus  among 

8 Indeed, when a congressional committee did consider codifying the du-
ress defense, it would have had the courts determine the defense "accord-
ing to the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted in the 
light  of  reason  and  experience."  S.  1437,  95th  Cong.,  2d  Sess.,  $ 501 
(1978). 

9 Duress, like the defense at issue in McKelvey, is an excuse that allows 

an exception from liability.  See, e. g., 2 LaFave $ 9.7, at 72 ("The rationale 
of  the  defense  of  duress  is  that  the  defendant  ought  to  be  excused  when 
he  `is  the  victim  of  a  threat  that  a  person  of  reasonable  moral  strength 
could not fairly be expected to resist' ").

federal courts that it is the Government's burden to disprove

gues  that  the  Code  reflects  "well  established"  federal  law 
as  it  existed  at  the  time.  Brief  for  Petitioner  25.  But,  as 
discussed  above,  no  such  consensus  existed  when  Congress 
passed the Safe Streets Act in 1968.  And even if we assume 
Congress'  familiarity  with  the  Code  and  the  rule  it  would 
establish,  there  is  no  evidence  that  Congress  endorsed  the 
Code's views or incorporated them into the Safe Streets Act. 

In  fact,  the  Act  itself  provides  evidence  to  the  contrary. 
Despite  the  Code's  careful  delineation  of  mental  states,  see 
Model  Penal  Code  $ 2.02,  at  94-95,  the  Safe  Streets  Act 
attached  no  explicit  mens  rea  requirement  to  the  crime  of 
receiving a firearm while under indictment, $ 924(a), 82 Stat. 
233 ("Whoever violates any provision of this chapter . . . shall  
be  fined  not  more  than  $5,000  or  imprisoned  not  more  than 
five years, or both").  And when Congress amended the Act 
to  impose  a  mens  rea  requirement,  it  punished  people  who 
"willfully"  violate  the  statute,  see  $104(a),  100  Stat.  456,  a 
mental  state  that  has  not  been  embraced  by  the  Code,  see 
Model  Penal  Code  $ 2.02(2),  at  94-95  (defining  "purposely," 
"knowingly,"  "recklessly,"  and  "negligently");  id.,  Explana-
tory  Note,  at  97  ("Though  the  term  `wilfully'  is  not  used  in 
the  definitions  of  crimes  contained in  the  Code, its  currency 
and  its  existence  in  offenses  outside  the  criminal  code  sug-
gest  the  desirability  of  clarification").  Had  Congress  in-
tended  to  adopt  the  Code's  structure  when  it  enacted  or 
amended  the  Safe  Streets  Act,  one  would  expect  the  Act's 
form and language to adhere much more closely to that used 
by  the  Code.  It  does  not,  and,  for  that  reason,  we  cannot 
rely on the Model Penal Code to provide evidence as to how 
Congress would have wanted us to effectuate the duress de-
fense in this context.

ported  for  immigration  violations,  and  to  reenter,  several times,  his  last  illegal  return  having  been  in  1982.  Then  his 
luck changed, and for over 20 years he remained undetected in  Utah,  where  he  started  a  trucking  business  and,  in  1989, 
fathered  a  son,  who  is  a  United  States  citizen.  In  2001, Fernandez-Vargas  married  the  boy's  mother,  who  is  also  a

The  second  flaw  is  the  argument's  failure  to  account  for 
the  new  statute's  other  provisions  on  temporal  reach,  from 
which  one  might  draw  a  negative  inference  that  subsection 
(a)(5)  was  (or  at  least  may  well  have  been)  meant  to  apply 
to  reentries  before  its  effective  date.  In  contrast  to  their 
silence  about  the  temporal  sweep  of  $ 241(a)(5),  the  1996 
amendments speak directly to the scope of changes in provi-
sions  making  reentry  criminal  and  setting  civil  penalties. 
IIRIRA $ 324(c), 110 Stat. 3009-629, note following 8 U. S. C.

bitions,  see  $ 1326(a),  apply  only  to  reentries  or  attempts

ting  IIRIRA's  effective  date,  $ 309(a),  110  Stat.  3009-625, which  shows  that  Fernandez-Vargas  had  an  ample  warning

Opinion of the Court 
That  in  itself  is  enough  to  explain  that  Fernandez-Vargas has  no  retroactivity  claim  based  on  a  new  disability  conse-

quent  to  a  completed  act,  but  in  fact  his  position  is  weaker still.  For  Fernandez-Vargas  could  not  only  have  chosen  to 
end  his  continuing  violation  and  his  exposure  to  the  less  fa-vorable law, he even had an ample warning that the new law 
could be applied to him and ample opportunity to avoid that very possibility by leaving the country and ending his viola-
tion  in  the  period  between  enactment  of  $ 241(a)(5)  and  its effective date.  IIRIRA became law on September 30, 1996, 
but  it  became  effective  and  enforceable  only  on  "the  first 
day  of  the  first  month  beginning  more  than  180  days  after" IIRIRA's  enactment,  that  is,  April  1,  1997.  $ 309(a),  110 

Stat.  3009-625.  Unlawful  alien  reentrants  like  Fernandez-Vargas  thus  had  the  advantage  of  a  grace  period  between 
the  unequivocal  warning  that  a tougher  removal  regime  lay ahead  and  actual  imposition  of  the  less  opportune  terms  of 

the  new  law.  In  that  stretch  of  six  months,  Fernandez-Vargas  could  have  ended  his  illegal  presence  and  potential 
exposure  to  the  coming  law  by  crossing  back  into  Mexico.11 

11 In a series of letters submitted to the Court after oral argument, the 
parties dispute the consequences if Fernandez-Vargas had left voluntarily 
after  IIRIRA's  enactment  and,  specifically,  the  period  of  inadmissibility 
to  which  Fernandez-Vargas  would  thereupon  have  been  subject.  Be-
cause  we  conclude  that  $ 241(a)(5)  does  not  operate  on  a  completed  pre-
enactment act, we need not consider the retroactive implications either of 
the  fact  of  his  inadmissibility  or  of  any  variance  between  the  period  of 
inadmissibility upon a postenactment voluntary return and that prescribed 
under the old regime.  The period of inadmissibility stems from an alien's 
illegal reentry within a specified time after a prior removal and is applica-
ble  to  Fernandez-Vargas  because  he  reentered  shortly  after  his  1981  de-
portation, but Fernandez-Vargas does not challenge as impermissibly ret-
roactive IIRIRA's lengthening of that period from 5 to 10 or 20 years, see 
8 U. S. C. $ 1182(a)(6)(B) (1994 ed.); $ 1182(a)(9)(A)(ii) (2000 ed.). 

In  any  event,  any  period  of  inadmissibility  is  subject  to  waiver  by  the 
Attorney  General,  see  $ 1182(a)(6)(B)  (1994  ed.);  $ 1182(a)(9)(A)(iii)  (2000 
ed.),  and  presumably  Fernandez-Vargas  could  plead  his  serious  case  for 
such  a  waiver  (his  marriage,  his  child)  in  seeking  legal  reentry  to  the 
United States.

significance of any given act of retaliation may depend upon the particu-
lar circumstances.  Pp. 67-70. 

3.  Applying  the  standard  to  the  facts  of  this  case,  there  was  a  suffi-
cient  evidentiary basis to support  the jury's verdict  on White's  retalia-
tion  claim.  Contrary  to  Burlington's  claim,  a  reassignment  of  duties 
can  constitute  retaliatory  discrimination  where  both  the  former  and 
present  duties  fall  within  the same  job  description.  Almost  every  job 
category involves some duties that are less desirable than others.  That 
is  presumably  why  the  EEOC  has  consistently  recognized  retaliatory 
work assignments as forbidden retaliation.  Here, the jury had consid-
erable  evidence  that  the  track  laborer  duties  were  more  arduous  and 
dirtier  than  the  forklift  operator  position,  and  that  the  latter  position 
was considered a better job by male employees who resented White for 
occupying  it.  Based  on  this  record,  a  jury  could  reasonably  conclude 
that the reassignment would have been materially adverse to a reason-
able  employee.  Burlington  also  argues  that  the  37-day  suspension 
without pay lacked statutory significance because White was reinstated 
with backpay.  The significance of the congressional judgment that vic-
tims  of  intentional  discrimination  can  recover  compensatory  and  puni-
tive  damages  to  make  them  whole  would  be  undermined  if  employers 
could  avoid  liability  in  these  circumstances.  Any  insufficient  evidence 
claim  is  unconvincing.  White  received  backpay,  but  many  reasonable 
employees  would find  a month without  pay a serious hardship.  White 
described  her  physical  and  emotional  hardship  to  the  jury,  noting  that 
she  obtained  medical  treatment  for  emotional  distress.  An  indefinite 
suspension  without  pay  could  well  act  as  a  deterrent  to  the  filing  of 
a  discrimination  complaint,  even  if  the  suspended  employee  eventually 
receives  backpay.  Thus,  the jury's  conclusion  that  the suspension  was 
materially adverse was reasonable.  Pp. 70-73. 

364 F. 3d 789, affirmed.

Opinion of the Court 
The Courts of Appeals have  come  to different conclusions 
about the scope of the Act's antiretaliation provision, particu-
larly  the  reach  of  its  phrase  "discriminate  against."  Does 
that  provision  confine  actionable  retaliation  to  activity 
that  affects  the  terms  and  conditions  of  employment?  And 
how  harmful  must  the  adverse  actions  be  to  fall  within  its 
scope? 

We  conclude  that  the  antiretaliation  provision  does  not 
confine  the  actions  and  harms  it  forbids  to  those  that  are 
related  to  employment  or  occur  at  the  workplace.  We  also 
conclude  that  the  provision  covers  those  (and  only  those) 
employer  actions  that  would  have  been  materially  adverse 
to  a  reasonable  employee  or  job  applicant.  In  the  present 
context  that  means  that  the  employer's  actions  must  be 
harmful  to  the  point  that  they  could  well  dissuade  a  rea-
sonable  worker  from  making  or  supporting  a  charge  of 
discrimination.

A 

This  case  arises  out  of  actions  that  supervisors  at  peti-
tioner  Burlington  Northern  &  Santa  Fe  Railway  Company 
took against respondent Sheila White, the only woman work-
ing  in  the  Maintenance  of  Way  department  at  Burlington's 
Tennessee  Yard.  In  June  1997,  Burlington's  roadmaster, 
Marvin  Brown,  interviewed  White  and  expressed  interest 
in  her  previous  experience  operating  forklifts.  Burlington 
hired White as a "track laborer," a job that involves remov-
ing  and  replacing  track  components,  transporting  track  ma-
terial,  cutting  brush,  and  clearing  litter  and  cargo  spillage 
from the right-of-way.  Soon after White arrived on the job, 
a  co-worker  who  had  previously  operated  the  forklift  chose 
to  assume  other  responsibilities.  Brown  immediately  as-
signed  White  to  operate  the  forklift.  While  she  also  per-
formed  some  of  the  other  track  laborer  tasks,  operating  the 
forklift was White's primary responsibility.

suspended.  White filed an additional retaliation  charge with the EEOC based on the suspension. 

B 
After exhausting administrative remedies, White filed this Title VII action against Burlington in federal court.  As rel-

evant here, she claimed that Burlington's actions--(1) chang-ing  her  job  responsibilities,  and  (2)  suspending  her  for  37 
days without pay--amounted to unlawful retaliation in viola-tion  of  Title  VII.  $ 2000e-3(a).  A  jury  found  in  White's 
favor  on  both  of  these  claims.  It  awarded  her  $43,500 in  compensatory  damages,  including  $3,250  in  medical  ex-
penses.  The  District  Court  denied  Burlington's  post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law.  See Fed. Rule Civ. 
Proc. 50(b). Initially,  a  divided  Sixth  Circuit  panel  reversed  the  judg-
ment  and  found  in  Burlington's  favor  on  the  retaliation claims.  310 F. 3d 443 (2002).  The full Court of Appeals va-
cated the panel's decision, however, and heard the matter en banc.  The  court  then  affirmed  the  District  Court's  judg-
ment  in  White's  favor  on  both  retaliation  claims.  While  all members  of  the  en  banc  court  voted  to  uphold  the  District 
Court's judgment, they differed as to the proper standard to apply.  Compare 364 F. 3d, at 795-800, with id.,

an  employee  such  as  White  from  bringing  discrimination charges  would  be  to  insist  that  she  spend  more  time  per-

forming  the  more  arduous  duties  and  less  time  performing those that are easier or more agreeable.  That is presumably 
why  the  EEOC  has  consistently  found  "[r]etaliatory  work assignments"  to  be  a  classic  and  "widely  recognized"  exam-
ple of "forbidden retaliation."  2 EEOC 1991 Manual $ 614.7, 
pp. 614-31 to 614-32; see also 1972 Reference Manual $ 495.2 (noting  Commission  decision  involving  an  employer's  order-

ing  an  employee  "to  do  an  unpleasant  work  assignment  in retaliation"  for  filing  racial  discrimination  complaint);  Dec. 
No. 74-77, CCH EEOC Decisions (1983) || 6417 (1974) ("Em-
ployers have been enjoined" under Title VII "from imposing 
unpleasant  work  assignments  upon  an  employee  for  filing 
charges"). 

To be sure, reassignment of job duties is not automatically 
actionable.  Whether  a  particular  reassignment  is  materi-
ally adverse depends upon the  circumstances of the particu-
lar  case,  and  "should  be  judged  from  the  perspective  of  a 
reasonable  person  in  the  plaintiff 's  position,  considering  `all 
the  circumstances.' "  Oncale,

record  helpful  to  the  court.  In  contrast,  respondent's  interpretation 
would make the PLRA's exhaustion scheme totally ineffective, since ex-
haustion's benefits can be realized only if the prison grievance system is 
given a fair opportunity to consider the grievance.  That cannot happen 
unless the grievant complies with the system's critical procedural rules. 
Respondent's  arguments  that  his  interpretation  would  filter  out  frivo-
lous claims are unpersuasive.  Pp. 93-96. 

(3)  As  interpreted  by  respondent,  the  PLRA  exhaustion  require-
ment would be unprecedented.  No statute or case purports to require 
exhaustion  while  at  the  same  time  allowing  a  party  to  bypass  deliber-
ately  the  administrative  process  by  flouting  the  agency's  procedural 
rules.  None  of  his  models  is  apt.  He  first  suggests  that  the  PLRA 
requirement  was  patterned  on  habeas  law  as  it  existed  between  1963 
and 1977  when, under Fay  v.  Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 438, a  federal habeas 
claim  could  be  procedurally  defaulted  only  if  the  prisoner  deliberately 
bypassed  state  remedies.  That  would  be  fanciful,  however.  The 
PLRA was enacted contemporaneously with the Antiterrorism and Ef-
fective  Death Penalty Act  of  1996, which gave  federal habeas  review a 
structure markedly different from what existed before 1977.  Further-
more,  respondent's  interpretation  would  not  duplicate  that scheme,  for 
it would permit a prisoner to bypass deliberately administrative review 
with  no  risk  of  sanction.  Respondent  next  suggests  that  the  PLRA 
exhaustion  requirement  is  patterned  on  $ 14(b)  of  the  Age  Discrimina-
tion  in  Employment  Act  of  1967  and  $ 706(e)  of  Title  VII  of  the  Civil 
Rights Act of 1964, but neither provision is in any sense an exhaustion 
provision.  Pp. 96-99. 

(c)  Respondent's  remaining  arguments  regarding  $ 1997e(a)'s  inter-
pretation are also unconvincing.  Pp. 99-103.

A 

Congress  enacted  the  Prison  Litigation  Reform  Act  of 
1995  (PLRA),  110  Stat.  1321-71,  as  amended,  42  U. S. C. 

$ 1997e et seq., in 1996 in the wake of a sharp rise in prisoner 
litigation in the federal courts, see, e. g., Alexander v.  Hawk, 
159  F.  3d  1321,  1324-1325  (CA11  1998)  (citing  statistics). 
The PLRA contains a variety of provisions designed to bring 
this  litigation  under control.  See, e. g., $ 1997e(c)  (requiring 
district  courts  to  weed  out  prisoner  claims  that  clearly  lack 
merit);  $ 1997e(e)  (prohibiting  claims  for  emotional  injury 
without  prior  showing  of  physical  injury);  $ 1997e(d)  (re-
stricting attorney's fees). 

A  centerpiece  of  the  PLRA's  effort  "to  reduce  the  quan-
tity . . . of  prisoner  suits"  is  an  "invigorated"  exhaustion 
provision,  $ 1997e(a).  Porter  v.  Nussle,  534  U. S.  516,  524 
(2002).  Before 1980, prisoners asserting  constitutional 
claims had no obligation to exhaust administrative remedies. 
See  Wilwording  v.  Swenson,  404  U. S.  249,  251  (1971)  (per 
curiam).  In  the  Civil  Rights  of  Institutionalized  Persons 
Act,  $ 7,  94  Stat.  352-353,  Congress enacted  a  weak  exhaus-
tion  provision,  which  authorized  district  courts  to  stay  ac-
tions under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, for a limited 
time  while  a  prisoner  exhausted  "such  plain,  speedy,  and

scription was in large part discretionary; it could be ordered 
only if the State's prison grievance system met specified fed-

relief  was  not  available  under  the  relevant  administrative scheme.  See  McCarthy v.  Madigan,  503  U. S.  140,  150-151 

(1992). The PLRA strengthened this exhaustion provision in sev-
eral  ways.  Exhaustion is  no longer  left to  the  discretion  of the district court, but is mandatory.  See Booth v.  Churner, 
532  U. S.  731,  739  (2001).  Prisoners  must  now  exhaust  all "available" remedies, not just those that meet federal stand-
ards.  Indeed,  as  we  held  in  Booth,  a  prisoner  must  now exhaust  administrative  remedies  even  where  the  relief 
sought--monetary  damages--cannot  be  granted  by  the  ad-ministrative  process. 

Id.,  at  734.  Finally,  exhaustion  of available  administrative  remedies  is  required  for  any  suit 

challenging prison conditions, not just for suits under $ 1983. Nussle, supra, at 524. 

B 
California  has  a  grievance  system  for  prisoners  who  seek to challenge their conditions of confinement.  To initiate the 

process, an inmate must fill out a simple form, Dept. of Cor-rections,  Inmate/Parolee  Appeal  Form,  CDC  602  (12/87) 
(hereinafter Form 602), that is made "readily available to all inmates."  Cal.  Code  Regs.,  tit.  15,  $ 3084.1(c)  (2004).  The 
inmate  must  fill  out  two  parts  of  the  form:  part  A,  which  is labeled "Describe Problem," and part B, which is labeled "Ac-
tion Requested."  Then, as explained on Form 602 itself, the prisoner "must first informally seek relief through discussion 
with  the  appropriate  staff  member."  App.  40-41.  The staff  member  fills  in  part  C  of  Form  602  under  the  heading 
"Staff  Response"  and  then  returns  the  form  to  the  inmate. If  the  prisoner  is  dissatisfied  with  the  result  of  the  infor-
mal  review,  or  if  informal  review  is  waived  by  the  State, the  inmate  may  pursue  a  three-step  review  process.  See 

$$ 3084.5(b)-(d).  Although  California  labels  this  "formal" review (apparently to distinguish this process from the prior 
step),  the  three-step  process  is  relatively  simple.  At  the first level, the prisoner must fill in part D of Form 602, which

Opinion of the Court 
states:  "If  you  are  dissatisfied,  explain  below."  Id.,  at  40. The  inmate  then  must  submit  the  form,  together  with  a 

few  other  documents,  to  the  appeals  coordinator  within 15  working  days--three  weeks--of  the  action  taken. 

$ 3084.6(c).  This level may be bypassed by the appeals coor-dinator  in  certain  circumstances.  $ 3084.5(b).  Within  15 
working  days  after  an  inmate  submits  an  appeal,  the  re-viewer must inform the inmate of the outcome by completing 
part  E  of  Form  602  and  returning  the  form  to  the  inmate. If  the  prisoner  receives  an  adverse  determination  at  this 
first  level,  or  if  this  level  is  bypassed,  the  inmate  may  pro-ceed to the second level of review conducted by the warden. 

$$ 3084.5(c), (e)(1).  The inmate does this by filling in part F of Form 602 and submitting the form within 15 working days 
of  the  prior  decision.  Within  10  working  days  thereafter, the  reviewer provides a  decision  on a  letter that  is attached 
to  the  form.  If  the  prisoner's  claim  is  again  denied  or  the prisoner  otherwise  is  dissatisfied  with  the  result,  the  pris-
oner  must  explain  the  basis  for  his  or  her  dissatisfaction  on part  H  of the  form  and  mail the  form  to  the  Director  of  the 
California  Department  of  Corrections  and  Rehabilitation within 15 working days.  $ 3084.5(e)(2).  An inmate's appeal 
may  be  rejected  where  "[t]ime  limits  for  submitting  the  ap-peal  are  exceeded  and  the  appellant  had  the  opportunity  to 
file  within  the  prescribed  time  constraints."  $ 3084.3(c)(6).

Respondent  is  a  prisoner  who  was  convicted  for  murder and is serving a life sentence in the California prison system. 

In  October  2000,  respondent  was  placed  in  administrative segregation  for  allegedly  engaging  in  "inappropriate  activ-
ity"  in  the  prison  chapel.  Two  months  later,  respondent 
was  returned  to  the  general  population,  but  respondent claims  that  he  was  prohibited  from  participating  in  "spe-

cial programs," including a variety of religious activities.

Opinion of the Court 
Approximately  six  months  after  that  restriction  was  im-posed, respondent filed a grievance with prison officials chal-

lenging  that  action.  That  grievance  was  rejected  as  un-timely because it was not filed within 15 working days of the 
action being challenged.  See $$ 3084.3(c)(6), 3084.6(c). Respondent appealed that decision internally without suc-
cess,  and  subsequently  sued  petitioners--California  correc-
tional  officials--under  42  U. S. C.  $ 1983  in  Federal  District Court.  The  District  Court  granted  petitioners'  motion  to 

dismiss  because  respondent  had  not  fully  exhausted  his  ad-ministrative  remedies  as  required  by  $ 1997e(a).  See  App. 
to Pet. for Cert. 24-25. The  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Ninth  Circuit  reversed  and 
held that respondent had exhausted administrative remedies simply because no such remedies  remained available to him. 
403 F. 3d 620, 629-630 (2005).  The Ninth Circuit's decision, while  consistent  with  the  decision  of  a  divided  panel  of  the 
Sixth  Circuit  in  Thomas  v.  Woolum,  337  F.  3d  720  (2003), conflicts with decisions of four other Courts of Appeals.  See 
Pozo v.  McCaughtry, 286 F. 3d 1022, 1025 (CA7) ("To exhaust 
remedies,  a prisoner  must file  complaints and  appeals in the place,  and  at  the  time,  the  prison's  administrative  rules  re-

quire"),  cert.  denied,  537  U. S.  949  (2002);  Ross  v.  County  of

The PLRA provides as follows: 

"No  action  shall  be  brought  with  respect  to  prison 
conditions  under  section  1983  of  this  title,  or  any  other

Opinion of the Court 
Federal  law,  by  a  prisoner  confined  in  any  jail,  prison, 
or  other  correctional  facility  until  such  administrative 
remedies  as  are  available  are  exhausted."  $ 1997e(a) 
(2000 ed.) (emphasis added). 

There is no dispute that this language requires a prisoner 
to  "exhaust"  administrative  remedies,  but  the  parties  differ 
sharply  in  their  understanding  of  the  meaning  of  this  re-
quirement.  Petitioners  argue  that  this  provision  requires 
proper  exhaustion.  This  means,  according  to  petitioners, 
that  a  prisoner  must  complete  the  administrative  review 
process  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  procedural  rules, 
including deadlines, as a precondition to bringing suit in fed-
eral court.  Respondent, on the other hand, argues that this 
provision  demands  what  he  terms  "exhaustion  simpliciter." 
Brief  for  Respondent  7.  In  his  view,  $ 1997e(a)  simply 
means  that  a  prisoner  may  not  bring  suit  in  federal  court 
until administrative remedies are  no  longer  available. 
Under  this  interpretation,  the  reason  why  administrative 
remedies are no longer available is irrelevant.  Bare unavail-
ability  suffices even  if  this  results from  a prisoner's  deliber-
ate  strategy  of  refraining  from  filing  a  timely  grievance  so 
that  the  litigation  of  the  prisoner's  claim  can  begin  in  fed-
eral court. 

The  key  for  determining  which  of  these  interpretations 
of  $ 1997e(a)  is  correct  lies  in  the  term  of  art  "exhausted." 
Exhaustion  is  an  important  doctrine  in  both  administrative 
and habeas law, and we therefore look to those bodies of law 
for guidance.

"The  doctrine  of  exhaustion  of  administrative  remedies  is 
well established in the jurisprudence of administrative law." 
McKart  v.  United  States,  395  U. S.  185,  193  (1969).  "The 
doctrine  provides  `that  no  one  is  entitled  to  judicial  relief

Opinion of the Court 
for a  supposed or  threatened  injury until the  prescribed ad-
ministrative  remedy  has  been  exhausted.' "  Ibid.  (quoting 
Myers v.  Bethlehem Shipbuilding  Corp., 303  U. S. 41, 50-51 
(1938)).  Exhaustion  of  administrative  remedies  serves  two 
main purposes.  See McCarthy, 503 U. S., at 145. 

First,  exhaustion  protects  "administrative  agency  author-
ity."  Ibid.  Exhaustion gives an agency "an opportunity to 
correct its own mistakes with respect to the programs it ad-
ministers before it is haled into federal court," and it discour-
ages "disregard of [the agency's] procedures."  Ibid. 

Second, exhaustion promotes efficiency.  Ibid.  Claims 
generally  can  be  resolved  much  more  quickly  and  economi-
cally  in  proceedings  before  an  agency  than  in  litigation  in 
federal  court.  In  some  cases,  claims  are  settled  at  the  ad-
ministrative  level,  and  in  others,  the  proceedings  before  the 
agency  convince  the  losing  party  not  to  pursue  the  matter 

in  federal  court.  See  ibid.;  Parisi  v.  Davidson,  405  U. S. 
34,  37  (1972);  McKart,  supra,  at  195.  "And  even  where  a 
controversy  survives  administrative  review,  exhaustion  of 
the  administrative  procedure  may  produce  a  useful  record 
for  subsequent  judicial  consideration."  McCarthy,  supra, 
at 145. 

Because of the  advantages of administrative review, some 
aggrieved parties will voluntarily exhaust all avenues of ad-
ministrative review before resorting to federal court, and for 
these  parties  an  exhaustion  requirement  is  obviously  un-
necessary.  Statutes  requiring  exhaustion  serve  a  purpose 
when a significant number  of aggrieved parties,  if given  the 
choice,  would  not  voluntarily  exhaust.  Aggrieved  parties 
may  prefer  not  to  exhaust  administrative  remedies  for  a 
variety  of  reasons.  Although  exhaustion  promotes  overall 
efficiency,  a  party  may  conclude--correctly  or  incorrectly-- 
that exhaustion is not efficient in that party's particular case. 
In  addition,  some  aggrieved  parties  may  prefer  to  proceed

Opinion of the Court 
directly  to  federal  court  for  other  reasons,  including  bad 
faith.1  See Thomas, 337 F. 3d, at 752-753 (Rosen, J., dissent-
ing in part and concurring in judgment). 

Because  exhaustion  requirements  are  designed  to  deal 
with parties who do not want to exhaust, administrative law 
creates an incentive for these parties to do what they would 
otherwise prefer not to do, namely, to give the agency a fair 
and full opportunity to adjudicate their claims.  Administra-
tive law does this by requiring proper exhaustion of adminis-
trative  remedies,  which  "means  using  all  steps  that  the 
agency  holds  out,  and  doing  so  properly (so  that  the  agency 
addresses  the  issues  on  the  merits)."  Pozo,  286  F.  3d,  at 
1024  (emphasis  in  original).  This  Court  has  described  the 
doctrine as follows: "[A]s a general rule . . .  courts should not 
topple  over  administrative  decisions  unless  the  administra-
tive body not only has erred, but has erred against objection 
made  at  the  time  appropriate  under  its  practice."  United 
States  v.  L.  A.  Tucker  Truck  Lines,  Inc.,  344  U. S.  33,  37 
(1952)  (emphasis  added).  See  also  Sims  v.  Apfel,  530  U. S.

haustion in administrative law.  Neither is sound. 

First,  the  dissent  contends  that,  "in  the  absence  of  explicit  statutory

the  nature  of  "appellate  review  proceedings."  Post,  at  112  (opinion  of

Opinion of the Court 

C 
The law of habeas  corpus has  rules that are  substantively similar to those described above.  The habeas statute gener-

ally  requires  a  state  prisoner  to  exhaust  state  remedies  be-fore filing a habeas petition in federal court.  See 28 U. S. C. 

$$ 2254(b)(1),  (c).  "This  rule  of  comity  reduces  friction  be-tween  the  state  and  federal  court  systems  by  avoiding  the 
`unseem[liness]'  of  a  federal  district  court's  overturning  a state-court  conviction  without  the  state  courts  having  had 
an  opportunity  to  correct  the  constitutional  violation  in  the first  instance." 

O'Sullivan  v.  Boerckel,  526  U. S.  838,  845 (1999) (alteration in original).  A state prisoner is generally 

barred  from  obtaining  federal  habeas  relief  unless  the  pris-oner  has  properly  presented  his  or  her  claims  through  one 
"complete  round  of  the  State's  established  appellate  review process." 

Ibid.  In  practical  terms,  the  law  of  habeas,  like administrative law, requires proper exhaustion, and we have 

described this feature of habeas law as follows: "To . . . `pro-tect  the  integrity'  of  the  federal  exhaustion  rule,  we  ask 
not  only  whether  a  prisoner  has  exhausted  his  state  reme-dies,  but  also  whether  he  has  properly  exhausted  those 
remedies  .  .  .  ."  Id.,  at  848  (citation  omitted;  emphasis  in original). 

The law of habeas, however, uses terminology that differs from that of administrative law.  In habeas, the sanction for 
failing  to  exhaust  properly  (preclusion  of  review  in  federal 
court)  is  given  the  separate  name  of  procedural  default,  al-though  the  habeas  doctrines  of  exhaustion  and  procedural 

default "are similar in purpose and design and implicate sim-ilar concerns," 

Keeney v.  Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U. S. 1, 7 (1992). 
See also Coleman v.  Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 731-732 (1991). In habeas, state-court remedies are described as having been 

"exhausted" when they are no longer available, regardless of 
at 84, when the overwhelming majority of prisoner civil rights and prison 
condition suits are based on the Constitution.

Opinion of the Court 
the reason for their unavailability.  See Gray v.  Netherland, 518  U. S.  152,  161  (1996).  Thus,  if  state-court  remedies  are 

no  longer  available  because  the  prisoner  failed  to  comply with  the  deadline  for  seeking  state-court  review  or  for  tak-
ing  an  appeal,  those  remedies  are  technically  exhausted, ibid., but exhaustion in this sense does not automatically en-
title the habeas petitioner to litigate his or her claims in fed-eral court.  Instead, if the petitioner procedurally defaulted 
those claims, the prisoner generally is barred from asserting those  claims  in  a  federal  habeas  proceeding. 

Id.,  at  162; Coleman, supra, at 744-751. 

III 
With  this  background  in  mind,  we  are  persuaded  that  the PLRA  exhaustion  requirement  requires  proper  exhaustion. 

A 
The  text  of  42  U. S. C.  $ 1997e(a)  strongly  suggests  that the PLRA uses the term "exhausted" to mean what the term 

means in administrative law, where exhaustion means proper exhaustion.  Section 1997e(a) refers to "such administrative 
remedies  as  are  available,"  and  thus  points  to  the  doctrine of exhaustion in administrative law. 

B 
Construing  $ 1997e(a)  to  require  proper  exhaustion  also fits with the general scheme of the PLRA, whereas respond-

ent's  interpretation  would  turn  that  provision  into  a  largely useless  appendage.  The  PLRA  attempts  to  eliminate  un-
warranted federal-court interference with the administration of  prisons,

3  and  thus  seeks  to  "affor[d]  corrections  officials 

time and opportunity to address complaints internally before allowing the initiation of a federal case."  Nussle, 534 U. S., 

at  525.  See  also  Booth,  532  U. S.,  at  739.  The  PLRA  also 

3 See, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 3626(b)(2) (termination of prison conditions con-
sent decrees).

94  WOODFORD  v.  NGO 

Opinion of the Court 
was intended to  "reduce the quantity  and improve the  qual-ity of prisoner suits."  Nussle, supra, at 524. 

Requiring proper exhaustion serves all of these goals.  It gives prisoners an effective incentive to make full use of the 
prison  grievance  process  and  accordingly  provides  prisons with a  fair opportunity to correct  their  own errors.  This  is 
particularly  important  in  relation  to  state  corrections  sys-tems  because  it  is  "difficult  to  imagine  an  activity  in  which 
a  State  has  a  stronger  interest,  or  one  that  is  more  intri-cately bound up with state laws, regulations, and procedures, 
than  the  administration  of  its  prisons."  Preiser  v.  Rodri-
guez, 411 U. S. 475, 491-492 (1973). Proper  exhaustion  reduces  the  quantity  of  prisoner  suits 

because  some  prisoners  are  successful  in  the  administrative process, and others are persuaded by the proceedings not to 
file  an  action  in  federal  court.4  Finally,  proper  exhaustion 

4 The dissent's objection, post, at 115-116, that exhaustion simpliciter is 
enough  to  reduce  frivolous  prisoner  suits  is  not  well  taken.  First,  what 
matters  is  not  whether  proper  exhaustion  was  necessary  to  reach  that 
goal, but whether proper exhaustion was mandated by Congress.  Second, 
the  empirical  support  for  the  dissent's  conclusion  is  weak.  The  dissent 
points  to  a  drop  in  volume  of  prisoner  litigation  between  1995  and  2000 
and  concludes  that  exhaustion  simpliciter  "was  sufficient  to  reduce  the 
quantity  of  prisoner  suits  without  any  procedural  default  requirement." 
Post,  at 116.  But  this mistakes  correlation for causation: A requirement 
of  exhaustion  simpliciter  will  not,  absent  a  mollified  prisoner,  prevent  a 
case  from  being  docketed--and  thus appearing  in  the  filing  statistics  the 
dissent  cites.  The  credit  for  reduced  filings  more  likely  belongs  to  the 
PLRA's  enactment  of  28  U. S. C.  $ 1915A  (requiring  district  courts  to 
screen  "before  docketing,  if  feasible,"  prisoner  civil  complaints),  and  its 
amendments to $ 1915 (forbidding frequent-filer prisoners from proceeding 
in  forma  pauperis).  Finally,  prisoner  civil  rights  and  prison  conditions 
cases still account for an outsized share of filings: From 2000 through 2005, 
such  cases  represented  between  8.3%  and  9.8%  of  the  new  filings  in 
the  federal  district  courts,  or  on  average  about  one  new  prisoner  case 
every  other  week  for  each  of  the  nearly  1,000  active  and  senior  district 
judges across the country.  See Administrative Office of the United States 
Courts, Judicial Facts and Figures, tbls. 1.1, 4.4, 4.6, http://www.uscourts.

able in Clerk of Court's case file).

Opinion of the Court 
improves the quality of those prisoner suits that are eventu-ally filed because proper exhaustion often results in the cre-

ation of an administrative record that is helpful to the court. When a grievance is filed shortly after the event giving rise 
to the  grievance, witnesses  can  be  identified and questioned while memories are still fresh, and evidence can be gathered 
and preserved. 

While requiring proper exhaustion serves the purposes of the  PLRA,  respondent's  interpretation  of  $ 1997e(a)  would 

make the PLRA exhaustion scheme wholly ineffective.  The benefits  of  exhaustion  can  be  realized  only  if  the  prison 
grievance  system  is  given  a  fair  opportunity  to  consider the grievance.  The  prison  grievance  system will  not  have  such 
an  opportunity  unless  the  grievant  complies  with  the  sys-tem's  critical  procedural  rules.  A  prisoner  who  does  not 
want to participate in the prison grievance system will have little incentive to comply with the system's procedural rules 
unless noncompliance carries a sanction, and under respond-ent's  interpretation  of  the  PLRA  noncompliance  carries  no 
significant sanction.  For example, a prisoner wishing to by-
pass  available  administrative  remedies  could  simply  file  a late grievance without providing any reason for failing to file 

on  time.  If  the  prison  then  rejects  the  grievance  as  un-
timely,  the  prisoner  could  proceed  directly  to  federal  court. 
And  acceptance  of  the  late  grievance  would  not  thwart  the 
prisoner's  wish  to  bypass  the  administrative  process;  the 
prisoner  could  easily  achieve  this  by  violating  other  proce-
dural rules until the prison administration has no alternative 
but to dismiss the grievance on procedural grounds.  We are 
confident  that  the  PLRA  did  not  create  such  a  toothless 
scheme. 

Respondent  argues  that  his  interpretation  of  the  PLRA's 
exhaustion  provision  would  filter  out  frivolous  claims  be-
cause,  by  the  time  the  deadline  for  filing  a  grievance  has 
passed, the inmate may no longer wish to file suit.  Brief for 
Respondent 43.  But since the deadline for filing an adminis-
trative  grievance  is  generally  not  very  long--14  to  30  days

Opinion of the Court 
according  to  the  United  States,  see  Brief  for  United  States as Amicus Curiae 29, and even less according to respondent, 

see  Brief  for  Respondent  30,  n.  17--it  is  doubtful  that  Con-gress  thought  requiring  a  prisoner  to  wait  this  long  would 
provide much of a deterrent.  Indeed, many prisoners would probably  find  it  difficult  to  prepare,  file,  and  serve  a  civil 
complaint  before  the  expiration  of  the  deadline  for  filing  a grievance in many correctional systems. 

Respondent  also  contends  that  his  interpretation  of  the PLRA  exhaustion  requirement  would  filter  out  frivolous 
claims  because  prisoners  could  not  simply  wait  until  the deadline  for  filing  an  administrative  grievance  had  passed. 
According  to  respondent,  "most  grievance  systems  give  ad-ministrators the discretion to hear untimely grievances," and 
therefore  a  prisoner  "will  be  required  to  file  an  untimely grievance,  and  thereby  give  the  grievance  system"  the  op-
portunity to address the complaint.  Id., at 43.  But assum-ing  for  the  sake  of  argument  that  the  premise  of  this  argu-
ment  is  correct,  i. e.,  that  a  court  could  never  conclude  that administrative remedies were unavailable unless an adminis-
trative  decision  had  so  held,  but  see  Coleman,  501  U. S.,  at 735,  n.,  a  prisoner  who  does  not  want  to  participate  in  the 
prison  grievance  process  would  have  little  difficulty  in  forc-ing  the  prison  to  dismiss  his  administrative  case  on  proce-
dural  grounds.  Under  the  California  system,  for  example, a  prisoner  has  numerous  opportunities  to  miss  deadlines. 
Therefore,  the  task  of  engineering  such  a  dismissal  of  a grievance  on  procedural  grounds  is  unlikely  to  be  sufficient 
to  alter  the  conduct  of  a  prisoner  whose  objective  is  to  by-pass the administrative process.

Finally,  as  interpreted  by  respondent,  the  PLRA  exhaus-tion requirement would be unprecedented.  Respondent has 

not  pointed  to  any  statute  or  case  that  purports  to  require

Opinion of the Court 
exhaustion  while  at  the  same  time  allowing  a  party  to  by-
pass  deliberately  the  administrative  process  by  flouting 

the  agency's  procedural  rules.  It  is  most  unlikely  that  the 
PLRA, which was intended to deal with what was perceived 
as  a  disruptive  tide  of  frivolous  prisoner  litigation,  adopted 
an exhaustion requirement that goes further than any other 
model that has been called to our attention in permitting the 
wholesale  bypassing  of  administrative  remedies.  Respond-
ent  identifies  three  models  for  the  scheme  of  "exhaustion 
simpliciter"  that  he  believes  is  set  out  in  the  PLRA,  but 
none of these examples is apt. 

Respondent first looks to habeas law as it existed prior to 
Wainwright  v.  Sykes,  433  U. S.  72  (1977).  Before  then,  a 
federal  habeas  claim  could  be  procedurally  defaulted  only  if 
the prisoner deliberately bypassed state remedies.  See Fay 
v.  Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 438 (1963).  It would be fanciful, how-
ever, to suggest that the PLRA exhaustion requirement was 
patterned  on  habeas  law  as  it  existed  in  the  years  between 
Fay  and  Wainwright.  As  respondent  stresses,  the  PLRA 
was enacted  contemporaneously with  the Antiterrorism and 
Effective  Death  Penalty  Act  of  1996  (AEDPA),  110  Stat. 
1214, which gave federal habeas review a structure markedly 
different from that which existed in the period between Fay 
and Wainwright. 

Furthermore,  respondent's  interpretation  of  $ 1997e(a) 
would not duplicate the scheme that existed in habeas during 
that  interval.  As  interpreted  by  respondent,  $ 1997e(a) 
would permit a prisoner to bypass deliberately and flagrantly 
administrative  review  without  any  risk  of  sanction.  Be-
cause  it  is  unlikely  that  the  PLRA  was  intended  to  permit 
this, the two Courts of Appeals that have held that $ 1997e(a) 
does  not  require  proper  exhaustion  both  pointedly  stated 
that their decisions did not allow a prisoner to bypass delib-
erately  administrative  remedies.  See  403  F.  3d,  at  629; 
Thomas, 337 F. 3d, at 732, and n. 4.  Neither of these courts,

Opinion of the Court 
however, explained how $ 1997e(a) can be interpreted in this way--that  is,  so  that  it  does  not  require  proper  exhaustion 

but somehow proscribes deliberate bypass. Apparently  recognizing  that  such  an  interpretation  nei-
ther has a  statutory basis nor refers  to a concept of exhaus-tion  from  an  existing  body  of  law,  respondent  does  not  con-
tend  that  $ 1997e(a) prohibits  deliberate bypass;  in  his  view, 
all  that  $ 1997e(a)  demands  is  that  a  prisoner  wait  until  any opportunity  for  administrative review has  evaporated.  But 

in making this argument, respondent asks us to hold that the PLRA was meant to adopt an exhaustion scheme that stands 
in sharp contrast to both current and past habeas law and is 
unlike  any  other  exhaustion  scheme  that  has  been  called  to 
our attention. 

Respondent  next  suggests  that  the  PLRA  exhaustion  re-
quirement  was  patterned  on  $ 14(b)  of  the  Age  Discrimina-
tion in Employment Act of 1967  (ADEA), 81 Stat.  607, codi-
fied  at  29  U. S. C.  $ 633(b),  and  $ 706(e)  of  Title  VII  of  the 
Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  78  Stat.  260,  as  redesignated  and 
amended,  42  U. S. C.  $ 2000e-5(e),  but  these  are  implausible 
models.  Neither of these provisions makes reference to the 
concept of exhaustion, and neither is in any sense an exhaus-
tion provision. 

In  Oscar  Mayer  &  Co.  v.  Evans,  441  U. S.  750  (1979),  we 
considered  $ 14(b)  of  the  ADEA,  which  provides  that,  if 
a  State  has  an  agency  to  redress  state-law  age-related 
employment-discrimination  claims,  an  ADEA  claim  may  not 
be  brought  in  federal  court  "before  the  expiration  of  sixty 
days  after  proceedings  have  been  commenced  under  the 
State law."  29 U. S. C. $ 633(b) (emphasis added).  This pro-
vision  makes  no  reference  to  the  exhaustion  of  state  reme-
dies, only to the "commence[ment]" of state proceedings, and 
this provision leaves no doubt that proper commencement of 
those  proceedings  is  not  required.  As  we  noted,  see  Oscar 
Mayer, 441 U. S., at 759, $ 14(b) of the ADEA states that the 
requirement of commencement is satisfied merely by sending

Opinion of the Court 
the  state  agency  a  signed  statement  of  the  pertinent  facts, and  $ 14(b)  explicitly  provides  that  the  commencement  re-

quirement  does  not  entail  compliance  with  any  other  state procedural  rule,  including  a  deadline  for  initiating  the  state 
proceeding,  id.,  at  760.  We  see  little  similarity  between $ 14(b),  which  merely  requires  the  commencement  of  state 
proceedings  and  explicitly  does  not  require  timely  com-mencement,  and  42  U. S. C.  $ 1997e(a),  which  expressly  re-
quires  exhaustion  of  available  administrative  remedies  with no reference to a federally based limiting principle. 

Section  706(e)  of  Title  VII  is  also  fundamentally  different from  the  PLRA  exhaustion  provision.  As  interpreted  by 
this  Court,  $ 706(e)  means  that  a  complainant  who  "initially institutes  proceedings  with  a  state  or  local  agency  with  au-
thority  to  grant  or  seek  relief  from  the  practice  charged" must  "file  a  charge"  with  that  agency,  or  "have  the  EEOC 
refer  the  charge  to  that  agency,  within  240  days  of  the  al-leged  discriminatory  event  .  .  .  ." 

EEOC  v.  Commercial 
Office  Products  Co.,  486  U. S.  107,  110-111  (1988).  Follow-ing  the  reasoning  of  Oscar  Mayer,  we  held  that  this  filing 

requirement  did  not  demand  that  the  charge  submitted  to the  state  or  local  authority  be  filed  in  compliance  with  the 
authority's  time  limit.  486  U. S.,  at  123-125.  Because $ 706(e) of Title VII refers only to the filing of a charge with 
a state or local agency and not to the exhaustion of remedies, $ 706(e)  cannot  be  viewed  as  a  model  for  the  PLRA  exhaus-
tion provision.  IV 

Respondent's  remaining  arguments  regarding  the  inter-pretation of 42 U. S. C. $ 1997e(a) are unconvincing.  Relying 
on  the  use  of  the  term  "until"  in  the  phrase  "until  such  ad-ministrative  remedies  as  are  available  are  exhausted,"  re-
spondent contends that "[t]he use of the temporal word `until' . . . conveys a timing requirement: it assumes that the ques-
tion  to  be  answered  is  simply  whether  the  prisoner  can  file suit now or must wait until later."  Brief for Respondent 11.

100  WOODFORD  v.  NGO 

Opinion of the Court 
Likewise,  according  to  respondent,  the  use  of  the  present tense  ("such  administrative  remedies  as 

are  available," 

$ 1997e(a)  (emphasis  added))  requires  "a  focus  on  whether any  administrative  remedies  are 

presently  available."  Id., 
at 12.  But saying that a party may not sue in federal court 
until the party first pursues all available avenues of adminis-
trative  review  necessarily  means  that,  if  the  party  never 
pursues  all  available  avenues  of  administrative  review,  the person  will  never  be  able  to  sue  in  federal  court.  Thus, 

$ 1997e(a)'s use of the term "until" and the present tense does not support respondent's position. 

Respondent  attaches  significance  to  the  fact  that  the 
PLRA  exhaustion  provision  does  not  expressly  state  that  a 
prisoner  must  have  "properly exhausted"  available  adminis-
trative remedies, whereas a tolling provision of the AEDPA 
provides  that  the  time  for  filing  a  federal  habeas  petition  is 
tolled  during  the  period  when  "a  properly  filed  application 
for  State  post-conviction  or  other  collateral  review . . . is  
pending."  28 U. S. C. $ 2244(d)(2) (emphasis added).  In our 
view,  respondent  draws  an  unreasonable  inference  from  the 
difference in the wording of these two provisions.  Although 
the  AEDPA  and  the  PLRA  were  enacted  at  roughly  the 
same  time,  they  are  separate  and  detailed  pieces  of  legisla-
tion.  Moreover,  the  AEDPA  and  PLRA  provisions  deal 
with  separate  issues:  tolling  in  the  case  of  the  AEDPA  and 
exhaustion in the case of the PLRA. 

Respondent maintains that his interpretation of the PLRA 
exhaustion  provision  is  bolstered  by  another  PLRA  provi-
sion, 42 U. S. C. $ 1997e(c)(2), that permits a district court to 
dismiss  certain  prisoner  claims  "without  first  requiring  the 
exhaustion  of  administrative  remedies."  According  to  re-
spondent,  this  provision  shows  that  Congress  thought  that, 
at  the  point  when  a  district  court might  make  such  a  ruling 
(which  would  typically  be  well  after  the  filing  of  the  com-
plaint), a prisoner might still have the opportunity to exhaust 
administrative  remedies.  Because  short  administrative  fil-

Opinion of the Court 
ing  deadlines  would  make  this  impossible,  respondent  con-tends, Congress cannot have thought that a prisoner's failure 

to  comply  with  those  deadlines  would  preclude  litigation  in federal court. 

Respondent's  argument  is  unconvincing  for  at  least  two reasons.  First,  respondent  has  not  shown  that  Congress 
had  reason  to  believe  that  every  prison  system  would  have 
relatively short and categorical filing deadlines.  Indeed, re-spondent asserts that most grievance systems give adminis-

trators the discretion to hear untimely grievances.  Second, even  if  dismissals  under  $ 1997e(c)(2)  typically  occur  when 
the  opportunity  to  pursue  administrative  remedies  has passed, $ 1997e(c)(2)  still serves  a  useful  function by  making 
it  clear  that  the  PLRA  exhaustion  requirement  is  not  juris-dictional, and thus allowing a district court to dismiss plainly 
meritless  claims  without  first  addressing  what  may  be  a much  more  complex  question,  namely,  whether  the  pris-
oner  did  in  fact  properly  exhaust  available  administrative 
remedies.5 

Respondent  next  argues  that  the  similarity  between  the 
wording of the PLRA exhaustion provision and the AEDPA 
exhaustion  provision,  28  U. S. C.  $ 2254(c),  shows  that  the 
PLRA provision was  meant to  incorporate  the narrow tech-
nical definition of exhaustion that applies in habeas.  We re-
ject this argument for two reasons. 

First,  there  is  nothing  particularly  distinctive  about  the 
wording  of  the  habeas  and  PLRA  exhaustion  provisions. 
They  say  what  any  exhaustion  provision  must  say--that  a 
judicial remedy may not be  sought or obtained unless, until, 

5 Questions regarding the timeliness of prisoner filings occur frequently. 
See,  e. g.,  Wallace  v.  Burbury,  305  F.  Supp.  2d  801,  806  (ND  Ohio  2003); 
Pusey v.  Belanger, No. Civ.02-351-SLR, 2004 WL 2075472 (D. Del., Sept. 
14, 2004); Eakle v.  Tennis, No. Civ. 4:CV-04-2040, 2005 WL 2266270 (MD 
Pa., Sept. 16,  2005); Williams v.  Briley, No. 04 C 5701, 2005  WL 1498865 
(ND Ill., June 21, 2005); Isaac v.  Nix, No. Civ.A.2:04CV172RWS, 2006 WL 
861642 (ND Ga., Mar. 30, 2006).

Opinion of the Court 
or before certain other remedies are exhausted.  It is, there-fore, unrealistic to infer from the wording of the PLRA pro-

vision that Congress framed and adopted that provision with habeas law and not administrative law in mind.  Indeed, the 
wording  of  the  PLRA  provision  (a  prisoner  may  not  bring an  action  with  respect  to  prison  conditions  "

until  such  ad-
ministrative  remedies  as  are  available  are  exhausted")  is 
strikingly similar to our description of the doctrine of admin-istrative exhaustion (" `no one is entitled to judicial relief for 

a supposed or threatened injury until the prescribed admin-
istrative remedy has been exhausted,' "  McKart, 395 U. S., at 
193 (emphasis added)). 

Second,  respondent's  suggesti on  that the PLRA was 
meant  to incorporate  the  same  technical distinction  that  ex-
ists  in  habeas  law  without  providing  any  sanction  to  pre-
vent  willful  noncompliance--not  even  the  deliberate  bypass 
standard  of  Fay--would  produce  a  scheme  that  in  practical 
terms is radically different from the habeas scheme.  Copy-
ing  habeas'  narrow definition of  exhaustion  without  furnish-
ing  any  sanction  to  promote  compliance  would  be  like  copy-
ing the design for an airplane but omitting one of the wings. 

Respondent  contends  that  requiring  proper  exhaustion 
will lead prison administrators to devise procedural require-
ments  that  are  designed  to  trap  unwary  prisoners  and  thus 
to  defeat  their  claims.  Respondent  does  not  contend,  how-
ever,  that  anything  like  this  occurred  in  his  case,  and  it  is 
speculative  that  this  will  occur  in  the  future.  Corrections 
officials  concerned  about  maintaining  order  in  their  institu-
tions have a reason for creating and retaining grievance sys-
tems  that  provide--and  that  are  perceived  by  prisoners  as 
providing--a  meaningful  opportunity  for  prisoners  to  raise 
meritorious grievances.  And with respect to the possibility 
that  prisons  might  create  procedural  requirements  for  the 
purpose  of  tripping  up  all  but  the  most  skillful  prisoners, 
while  Congress  repealed  the  "plain,  speedy,  and  effective" 
standard,  see  42  U. S. C.  $ 1997e(a)(1)  (1994  ed.)  (repealed

stances outweigh aggravating circumstances.  A fortiori, Kansas' death 
penalty statute, consistent with the Constitution, may direct imposition 
of  the  death  penalty  when  the  State  has  proved  beyond  a  reasonable 
doubt that mitigators do not outweigh aggravators, including where the 
two are in equipoise.  Pp. 169-173. 

(b)  Even  if,  as  Marsh  contends,  Walton  does  not  directly  control 
here, general principles in this Court's death penalty jurisprudence lead 
to the same conclusion.  So long as a state system satisfies the require-
ments  of  Furman  v.  Georgia,  408  U. S.  238,  and  Gregg v.  Georgia,  428 
U. S.  153--that  a  system  must  rationally  narrow  the  class  of  death-
eligible defendants and must permit a jury to render a reasonable, indi-
vidualized sentencing determination--a  State  has a range of discretion 
in imposing the death penalty, including the manner in which aggravat-
ing  and  mitigating  circumstances  are  weighed.  The  use  of  mitigation 
evidence  is  a  product  of  the  individual-sentencing  requirement.  De-
fendants have the right to present sentencers with information relevant 
to  the  sentencing  decision,  and  sentencers  are  obliged  to  consider  that 
information  in  determining  the  appropriate  sentence.  The  thrust  of 
this Court's mitigation jurisprudence ends here, for the Court has never 
held  that  the  Constitution  requires  a  specific  method  for  balancing  ag-
gravating and mitigating factors.  Pp. 173-175. 

(c)  Kansas'  death  penalty  statute  satisfies  the  constitutional  man-
dates of Furman and its progeny because it rationally narrows the class 
of death-eligible defendants and permits a jury to consider any mitigat-
ing  evidence  relevant  to  its  sentencing  determination.  The  State's 
weighing equation merely channels a jury's discretion by providing cri-
teria  by  which the jury may  determine  whether life or  death is  appro-
priate.  Its system provides the kind of guided discretion sanctioned in, 
e. g.,  Walton,  supra.  Contrary  to Marsh's  argument,  $ 21-4624(e)  does 
not create  a general presumption in favor  of the death  penalty.  A life 
sentence must be imposed if the State fails to demonstrate the existence 
of an aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt, if the State 
cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that aggravating circumstances 
are not outweighed by mitigating circumstances, or if the jury is unable 
to reach a unanimous decision in any respect.  Marsh's contentions that 
an equipoise determination reflects juror confusion or inability to decide 
between life and death or that the jury may use equipoise as a loophole 
to  shirk  its  constitutional  duty  to  render  a  reasoned,  moral  sentencing 
decision rest on an implausible characterization of the Kansas statute-- 
that a jury's determination that aggravators and mitigators are in equi-
poise is not a decision, much less a decision for death.  Weighing is not 
an end, but a means to reaching a decision.  Kansas' instructions clearly

Opinion of the Court 
when  the  sentencing  jury  determines  that  aggravating  evi-dence  and  mitigating  evidence  are  in  equipoise,  violates  the 

Constitution.  We hold that it does not. 

I 
Respondent  Michael Lee  Marsh II broke  into  the home of Marry  Ane  Pusch  and  lay  in  wait  for  her  to  return.  When 

Marry  Ane  entered  her  home  with  her  19-month-old  daugh-ter,  M.  P.,  Marsh  repeatedly  shot  Marry  Ane,  stabbed  her, 
and  slashed  her  throat.  The  home  was  set  on  fire  with  the toddler inside, and M. P. burned to death. 

The  jury  convicted  Marsh  of  the  capital  murder  of  M.  P., the  first-degree  premeditated  murder  of  Marry  Ane,  aggra-
vated  arson,  and  aggravated  burglary.  The  jury  found  be-yond  a  reasonable  doubt  the  existence  of  three  aggravating 
circumstances,  and  that  those  circumstances  were  not  out-weighed  by  any  mitigating  circumstances.  On  the  basis  of 
those  findings,  the  jury  sentenced  Marsh  to  death  for  the capital  murder  of  M.  P.  The  jury  also  sentenced  Marsh  to 
life  imprisonment  without  possibility  of  parole  for  40  years for  the  first-degree  murder  of  Marry  Ane,  and  consecutive 
sentences  of  51  months'  imprisonment  for  aggravated  arson and 34 months' imprisonment for aggravated burglary. 

On  direct  appeal,  Marsh  challenged  $ 21-4624(e),  which reads: 

"If,  by  unanimous  vote,  the  jury  finds  beyond  a  reason-able  doubt  that  one  or  more  of  the  aggravating  circum-
stances  enumerated  in  K.  S.  A.  21-4625  .  .  .  exist  and, further,  that  the  existence  of  such  aggravating  circum-
stances  is  not  outweighed  by  any  mitigating  circum-stances which are found to exist, the defendant shall be 
sentenced  to  death;  otherwise,  the  defendant  shall  be sentenced as provided by law." 

Focusing on the phrase "shall be sentenced to death," Marsh argued that $ 21-4624(e) establishes an unconstitutional pre-

Opinion of the Court 
sumption  in  favor  of  death  because  it  directs  imposition  of the  death  penalty  when  aggravating  and  mitigating  circum-

stances are in equipoise. The Kansas Supreme Court agreed, and held that the Kan-
sas death penalty statute, $ 21-4624(e), is facially unconstitu-tional.  278  Kan.  520,  534-535,  102  P.  3d  445,  458  (2004). 
The  court  concluded  that  the  statute's  weighing  equation violated  the  Eighth  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  of  the 
United  States  Constitution  because,  "[i]n  the  event  of  equi-poise, 

i. e.,  the  jury's  determination  that  the  balance  of  any aggravating circumstances and any mitigating circumstances 

weighed  equal,  the  death  penalty  would  be  required."  Id., at  534,  102  P.  3d,  at  457.  The  Kansas  Supreme  Court 

affirmed  Marsh's  conviction  and  sentence  for  aggravated burglary  and  premeditated  murder  of  Marry  Ane,  and  re-
versed  and  remanded  for  new  trial  Marsh's  convictions  for capital murder of M. P. and aggravated arson.

1  We granted 

certiorari,  544  U. S.  1060  (2005),  and  now  reverse  the Kansas Supreme  Court's judgment that Kansas' capital sen-

tencing  statute,  Kan.  Stat.  Ann.  $ 21-4624(e),  is  facially unconstitutional. 

II 
In  addition  to  granting  certiorari  to  review  the  constitu-tionality  of  Kansas'  capital  sentencing  statute,  we  also  di-

rected  the  parties  to  brief  and  argue:  (1)  whether  we  have jurisdiction  to  review  the  judgment  of  the  Kansas  Supreme 
Court  under  28  U. S. C.  $ 1257,  as  construed  by  Cox  Broad-casting  Corp.  v.  Cohn,  420  U. S.  469  (1975);  and  (2)  whether 
the  Kansas  Supreme Court's judgment is  supported  by ade-quate  state  grounds  independent  of  federal  law.  544  U. S.

versible  error  by  excluding  circumstantial  evidence  of  third-party  guilt 
connecting  Eric  Pusch,  Marry  Ane's  husband,  to  the  crimes,  and  accord-
ingly ordered a new trial on this ground.  278 Kan., at 528-533, 102 P. 3d, 
at 454-457.

Opinion of the Court 
clude that we have jurisdiction in this case and that the con-stitutional issue is properly before the Court. 

A 
Title 28 U. S. C. $ 1257 authorizes this Court to review, by writ  of certiorari,  the  final  judgment of  the highest  court of 

a State when the validity of a state statute is questioned on federal  constitutional  grounds.  This  Court  has  determined 
that the foregoing authorization permits review of the judg-ment of  the  highest  court of  a  State,  even though  the  state-
court  proceedings  are  not  yet  complete,  "where  the  federal claim  has  been  finally  decided,  with  further  proceedings 
on  the  merits  in  the  state  courts  to  come,  but  in  which later review of the federal issue cannot be had, whatever the 
ultimate  outcome  of  the  case."  Cox  Broadcasting,  supra, at 481. 

Here, although Marsh will be retried on the capital murder and  aggravated  arson  charges,  the  Kansas  Supreme  Court's 
determination  that  Kansas'  death  penalty  statute  is  facially unconstitutional  is  final  and  binding  on  the  lower  state 
courts.  Thus, the State will be unable to obtain further re-view of its death penalty law later in this case.  If Marsh is 
acquitted  of  capital  murder,  double  jeopardy  and  state  law will preclude the State from appealing.  If he is reconvicted, 
the  State  will  be  prohibited  under  the  Kansas  Supreme Court's  decision  from  seeking  the  death  penalty,  and  there 
would be no opportunity for the State to seek further review of that prohibition.  Although Marsh argues that a provision 
of the Kansas criminal appeals statute, Kan. Stat. Ann. $ 22- 3602(b) (2003 Cum. Supp.), would permit the State to appeal 
the  invalidation  of  Kansas'  death  penalty  statute,  that  con-tention  is  meritless.  That  statute  provides  for  limited  ap-
peal  in  only  four  enumerated  circumstances,  none  of  which apply here.  We have deemed lower court decisions final for 
28 U. S. C. $ 1257 purposes in like circumstances, see Florida v. 

Meyers,  466  U. S.  380  (1984)  (per  curiam);  South  Dakota

B 
Nor is the Kansas Supreme Court's decision supported by adequate  and  independent  state grounds.  Marsh  maintains 

that  the  Kansas  Supreme  Court's  decision  was  based on  the severability of $ 21-4624(e) under state law, and not the con-
stitutionality  of  that  provision  under  federal  law,  the  latter issue having been resolved by the Kansas Supreme Court in 
State  v.  Kleypas,  272  Kan.  894,  40  P.  3d  139  (2001)  (per  cu-
riam).  Marsh's argument fails. Kleypas, itself, rested on federal law.  See id., at 899-903, 

40  P.  3d,  at  166-167.  In  rendering  its  determination  here, the  Kansas  Supreme  Court  observed  that  Kleypas,  "held 
that  the  weighing  equation  in  K.  S.  A.  21-4624(e)  as  writ-ten  was  unconstitutional  under  the  Eighth  and  Fourteenth 
Amendments"  as  applied  to  cases  in  which  aggravating  evi-dence  and  mitigating  evidence  are  equally  balanced.  278 
Kan.,  at  534,  102  P.  3d,  at  457.  In  this  case,  the  Kansas Supreme Court chastised the 

Kleypas court for avoiding the constitutional  issue  of  the  statute's  facial  validity,  squarely 

held  that  $ 21-4624(e)  is  unconstitutional  on  its  face,  and overruled  the  portion  of  Kleypas  upholding  the  statute 
through the constitutional avoidance doctrine and judicial re-vision.  278 Kan., at 534-535, 539-542, 102 P. 3d, at 458, 462. 
As in Kleypas, the Kansas Supreme Court clearly rested its decision here on the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to 
the  United  States  Constitution.  We,  therefore,  have  juris-diction  to  review  its  decision.  See  Michigan  v.  Long,  463 
U. S. 1032, 1040-1041 (1983).

This case is controlled by Walton v.  Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990),  overruled  on  other  grounds, 

Ring  v.  Arizona,  536 U. S.  584  (2002).  In  that  case,  a  jury  had  convicted  Walton

Opinion of the Court 
of a capital offense.  At sentencing, the trial judge found the existence of two aggravating circumstances and that the mit-

igating circumstances did not call for leniency, and sentenced Walton  to  death.  497  U. S.,  at  645.  The  Arizona  Supreme 
Court affirmed,  and this  Court  granted  certiorari to resolve the  conflict  between  the  Arizona  Supreme  Court's  decision 
in  State  v.  Walton,  159  Ariz.  571,  769  P.  2d  1017  (1989)  (en banc)  (holding  the  Arizona  death  penalty  statute  constitu-
tional), and the Ninth Circuit's decision in Adamson v.  Rick-
etts,  865  F.  2d  1011,  1043-1044  (1988)  (en  banc)  (finding  the Arizona  death  penalty  statute  unconstitutional  because,  "in 

situations  where  the  mitigating  and  aggravating  circum-stances  are  in  balance,  or,  where  the  mitigating  circum-
stances  give  the  court  reservation  but  still  fall  below  the weight  of  the  aggravating  circumstances,  the  statute  bars 
the  court  from  imposing  a  sentence  less  than  death").  See Walton, supra, at 647. 

Consistent  with  the  Ninth  Circuit's  conclusion  in  Adam-
son,  Walton  argued  to  this  Court  that  the  Arizona  capital sentencing  system  created  an  unconstitutional  presumption 

in  favor  of  death  because  it  "tells  an  Arizona  sentencing judge who finds even a single aggravating factor, that death 
must be imposed, unless--as the Arizona Supreme Court put it in Petitioner's case--there are `outweighing mitigating fac-
tors.' "  Brief  for  Petitioner  in  Walton  v.  Arizona,  O.  T. 1989, No. 88-7351, p. 33; see  also id., at 34  (arguing that the 
statute is unconstitutional because the defendant " `must . . . bear  the  risk  of  nonpersuasion  that  any  mitigating  circum-
stance will not outweigh the aggravating circumstance' " (al-teration  omitted)).  Rejecting  Walton's  argument,  see  497 
U. S., at 650, 651, this Court stated: 

"So long as a State's method of allocating the burdens of proof  does not  lessen  the  State's  burden  to prove  every 

element  of  the  offense  charged,  or  in  this  case  to  prove the  existence  of  aggravating  circumstances,  a  defend-
ant's constitutional rights are not violated by placing on

Opinion of the Court 
him the burden of proving mitigating circumstances suf-ficiently substantial to call for leniency."  Id., at 650. 

This  Court  noted  that,  as  a  requirement  of  individualized sentencing, a jury must have  the opportunity to consider all 
evidence relevant to mitigation, and that a state statute that permits a jury to consider any mitigating evidence comports 
with that requirement.  Id., at 652 (citing Blystone v.  Penn-sylvania,  494  U. S.  299,  307  (1990)).  The  Court  also  point-
edly  observed  that  while  the  Constitution  requires  that  a sentencing jury have discretion, it does not mandate that dis-
cretion  be  unfettered;  the  States  are  free  to  determine  the manner  in  which  a  jury  may  consider  mitigating  evidence. 
497  U. S.,  at  652  (citing  Boyde  v.  California,  494  U. S.  370, 374  (1990)).  So  long  as the  sentencer is  not  precluded from 
considering  relevant  mitigating  evidence,  a  capital  sentenc-ing  statute  cannot  be  said  to  impermissibly,  much  less  auto-
matically,  impose  death.  497  U. S.,  at  652  (citing  Woodson v. 

North  Carolina,  428  U. S.  280  (1976)  (plurality  opinion), and  Roberts  v.  Louisiana,  428  U. S.  325  (1976)  (plurality 

opinion)).  Indeed,  Walton  suggested  that  the  only  capital sentencing  systems  that  would be  impermissibly  mandatory 
were  those  that  would  "automatically  impose  death  upon conviction  for  certain  types  of  murder."  497  U. S.,  at  652. 

Contrary  to Marsh's contentions  and the Kansas  Supreme Court's  conclusions,  see  278  Kan.,  at  536-538,  102  P.  3d,  at 
459, the question presented in the instant case was squarely before  this  Court  in 

Walton.  Though,  as  Marsh  notes,  the Walton  Court  did  not  employ  the  term  "equipoise,"  that 

issue undeniably gave rise to the question this Court sought to resolve, and  it was  necessarily included  in  Walton's  argu-
ment  that  the  Arizona  system  was  unconstitutional  because it  required  the  death  penalty  unless  the  mitigating  circum-
stances  outweighed  the  aggravating  circumstances.  See supra,  at  170.  Moreover,  the  dissent  in  Walton  reinforces 
what  is  evident  from  the  opinion  and  the  judgment  of  the Court--that  the  equipoise  issue  was  before  the  Court,  and

Opinion of the Court 
that the  Court  resolved the  issue in  favor of  the  State.  In-
deed,  the  "equipoise"  issue  was,  in  large  measure,  the  basis 
of the Walton dissent.  See 497 U. S., at 687-688 (opinion of 
Blackmun,  J.)  ("If  the  mitigating  and  aggravating  circum-
stances  are  in  equipoise,  the  [Arizona]  statute  requires  that 
the  trial  judge  impose  capital  punishment.  The  assertion 
that a sentence of death may be imposed in such a case runs 
directly counter to the Eighth Amendment requirement that 
a capital sentence must rest upon a `determination that death 
is  the  appropriate  punishment  in  a  specific  case' ").  Thus, 
although  Walton  did  not  discuss  the  equipoise  issue  explic-
itly, that issue was resolved by its holding.  Cf. post, at 199-

Opinion of the Court 
The  statutes  are  distinct  in  one  respect.  The  Arizona 
statute, once the State has met its burden, tasks the defend-
ant  with  the  burden  of  proving  sufficient  mitigating  circum-
stances to overcome the aggravating circumstances and that 
a  sentence  less  than  death  is  therefore  warranted.  In  con-
trast, the Kansas statute requires the State to bear the bur-
den  of  proving  to  the  jury,  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt,  that 
aggravators are not outweighed by mitigators and that a sen-
tence  of  death  is  therefore  appropriate;  it  places  no  addi-
tional  evidentiary  burden  on  the  capital  defendant.  This 
distinction  operates  in  favor  of  Kansas  capital  defendants. 
Otherwise  the  statutes  function  in  substantially  the  same 
manner  and  are  sufficiently  analogous  for  our  purposes. 
Thus,  Walton  is  not  distinguishable  from  the  instant  case. 

Accordingly, the reasoning of Walton requires approval of 
the  Kansas  death  penalty  statute.  At  bottom,  in  Walton, 
the  Court held  that a  state  death penalty  statute may  place 
the burden on the defendant to prove that mitigating circum-
stances  outweigh  aggravating  circumstances.  A  fortiori, 
Kansas' death penalty statute, consistent with  the Constitu-
tion,  may  direct  imposition  of  the  death  penalty  when  the 
State  has  proved beyond  a reasonable  doubt that  mitigators 
do  not  outweigh  aggravators,  including  where  the  aggra-
vating  circumstances  and  mitigating  circumstances  are  in 
equipoise. 

IV 

A 

Even if, as Marsh contends,  Walton does not directly con-
trol,  the  general  principles  set  forth  in  our  death  penalty 
jurisprudence would lead us to conclude that the Kansas cap-
ital  sentencing  system  is  constitutionally  permissible.  To-
gether,  our  decisions  in  Furman  v.  Georgia,  408  U. S.  238 
(1972)  (per  curiam),  and  Gregg  v.  Georgia,  428  U. S.  153 
(1976)  ( joint  opinion  of  Stewart,  Powell,  and  Stevens,

Opinion of the Court 
(1)  rationally  narrow  the  class  of  death-eligible  defendants; and  (2)  permit  a  jury  to  render  a  reasoned,  individualized 

sentencing  determination  based  on  a  death-eligible  defend-ant's  record,  personal  characteristics,  and  the  circumstances 
of  his  crime.  See  id.,  at  189.  So  long  as  a  state  system satisfies these  requirements, our precedents establish  that a 
State enjoys a range of discretion in imposing the death pen-
alty, including the manner in which aggravating and mitigat-ing  circumstances  are  to  be  weighed.  See 

Franklin  v.  Ly-
naugh,  487  U. S.  164,  179  (1988)  (plurality  opinion)  (citing 
Zant  v.  Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 875-876, n. 13 (1983)). 

The use of mitigation evidence is a product of the require-
ment  of  individualized  sentencing.  See  Graham  v.  Collins, 
506  U. S.  461,  484-489  (1993)  (Thomas,

Opinion of the Court 
In  aggregate,  our  precedents  confer  upon  defendants  the right to present sentencers with information relevant to the 

sentencing  decision  and  oblige  sentencers  to  consider  that information  in  determining  the  appropriate  sentence.  The 
thrust  of  our  mitigation  jurisprudence  ends  here.  "[W]e have never held that a specific method for balancing mitigat-
ing  and  aggravating factors in  a  capital  sentencing  proceed-ing  is  constitutionally  required." 

Franklin,  supra,  at  179 (citing  Zant,  supra,  at  875-876,  n.  13).  Rather,  this  Court 

has  held that  the  States  enjoy  " `a  constitutionally  permissi-ble  range  of  discretion  in  imposing  the  death  penalty.' "

176  KANSAS  v.  MARSH 

Opinion of the Court 
Kan.  Stat.  Ann.  $ 21-3439.  Once  convicted  of  capital  mur-der, a defendant becomes eligible for the death penalty only 

if  the  State  seeks  a  separate  sentencing  hearing,  $$ 21- 4706(c)  (2003  Cum.  Supp.),  21-4624(a);  App.  23  (Instruction 
No.  2),  and  proves  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  the  existence of  one  or  more  statutorily  enumerated  aggravating  circum-
stances.  Kan.  Stat.  Ann.  $$ 21-4624(c),  (e),  and  21-4625; App. 24 (Instruction No. 3). 

Consonant  with  the  individualized  sentencing  require-ment,  a  Kansas  jury  is  permitted  to  consider 

any  evidence relating  to  any  mitigating  circumstance  in  determining  the 

appropriate sentence for a capital defendant, so long  as that evidence  is  relevant.  $ 21-4624(c).  Specifically,  jurors  are 
instructed: 

"A  mitigating  circumstance  is  that  which  in  fairness or mercy may be considered as extenuating or reducing 

the degree of moral culpability or blame or which justify a sentence of less than death, although it does not justify 
or  excuse  the  offense.  The  determination  of  what  are mitigating  circumstances  is  for  you  as  jurors  to  resolve 
under the facts and circumstances of this case. "The  appropriateness  of  the  exercise of  mercy can  it-
self be a mitigating factor you may consider in determin-ing  whether  the  State  has  proved  beyond  a  reasonable 
doubt  that  the  death  penalty  is  warranted."  Id.,  at  24 (Instruction No. 4).

3 

Jurors  are  then  apprised  of,  but  not  limited  to,  the  factors that  the  defendant  contends  are  mitigating. 

Id.,  at  25-26. They  are  then  instructed  that  "[e]ach  juror  must  consider 

every  mitigating  factor  that  he  or  she  individually  finds  to exist." 

Id., at 26. 

3 The  "mercy"  jury  instruction  alone  forecloses  the  possibility  of 
Furman-type error as it "eliminate[s] the risk that a death  sentence will 
be  imposed  in  spite  of  facts  calling  for  a  lesser  penalty."  Post,  at  206

Opinion of the Court 
Kansas' weighing equation, ibid. (Instruction No.  5), merely channels a jury's discretion by providing it with crite-

ria by  which it  may  determine whether a  sentence of life  or death  is  appropriate.  The  system  in  Kansas  provides  the 
type of " `guided discretion,' " Walton, 497 U. S., at 659 (citing Gregg,  428  U. S.,  at  189),  we  have  sanctioned  in  Walton, 
Boyde, and Blystone. Indeed,  in 

Boyde,  this  Court  sanctioned  a  weighing  jury instruction  that  is  analytically  indistinguishable  from  the 

Kansas  jury  instruction  under  review  today.  The  Boyde jury instruction read: 

" `If  you  conclude  that  the  aggravating  circumstances outweigh  the  mitigating  circumstances,  you  shall  im-
pose  a  sentence  of  death.  However,  if  you  determine that  the  mitigating  circumstances  outweigh  the  aggra-
vating  circumstances,  you  shall  impose  a  sentence of  confinement  in  the  state  prison  for  life  without  the 
possibility  of  parole.' "  494  U. S.,  at  374  (emphasis  in original). 

Boyde  argued  that  the  mandatory  language  of  the  instruc-tion  prevented  the  jury  from  rendering  an  individualized 
sentencing  determination.  This  Court  rejected  that  argu-ment,  concluding  that  it  was  foreclosed  by  Blystone,  where 
the  Court  rejected  a  nearly identical  challenge  to  the  Penn-sylvania  death  penalty  statute.  494  U. S.,  at  307.

4  In  so 

holding, this Court noted that the mandatory language of the statute  did  not  prevent  the  jury  from  considering  all  rele-

vant  mitigating  evidence.  Boyde,  supra,  at  374.  Similarly here,  $ 21-4624(e)  does  not  prevent  a  Kansas  jury  from  con-
sidering  mitigating  evidence.  Marsh's  argument  that  the 

4 In Blystone, the Pennsylvania statute authorized imposition of a death 
sentence  if  the  jury  concluded  "that  the  aggravating  circumstances  out-
weigh[ed]  the  mitigating  circumstances  present  in  the  particular  crime 
committed by the particular defendant, or that there [were] no such miti-
gating circumstances."  494 U. S., at 305.

Opinion of the Court 
Kansas  provision  is  impermissibly  mandatory  is  likewise foreclosed.

5 

Contrary  to  Marsh's  argument,  $ 21-4624(e)  does  not  cre-ate  a  general  presumption  in  favor  of  the  death  penalty  in 

the State of Kansas.  Rather, the Kansas capital sentencing system  is  dominated  by  the  presumption  that  life  imprison-
ment is the appropriate sentence for a capital conviction.  If the  State  fails  to  meet  its  burden  to  demonstrate  the  exist-
ence  of  an  aggravating  circumstance(s)  beyond  a  reasonable doubt,  a  sentence  of  life  imprisonment  must  be  imposed. 
Ibid.;  App.  27  (Instruction  No.  10).  If  the  State  overcomes this  hurdle,  then  it  bears  the  additional  burden  of  proving 
beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  aggravating  circumstances are  not  outweighed  by  mitigating  circumstances. 

Ibid.  (In-struction  No.  10);  id.,  at  26  (Instruction  No.  5).  Signif-

icantly,  although  the  defendant  appropriately  bears  the burden  of  proffering  mitigating  circumstances--a  burden  of 
production--he  never  bears  the  burden  of  demonstrating that  mitigating  circumstances  outweigh  aggravating  cir-
cumstances.  Instead,  the  State  always  has  the  burden  of demonstrating  that  mitigating  evidence  does  not  outweigh 

5 Contrary  to  Justice

Opinion of the Court 
aggravating  evidence.  Absent  the  State's  ability  to  meet 
that  burden,  the  default  is  life  imprisonment.  Moreover,  if 
the  jury  is  unable  to  reach  a  unanimous  decision--in  any 
respect--a  sentence  of  life  must  be  imposed.  $ 21-4624(c); 
App. 28 (Instruction No. 12).  This system does not create a 
presumption that death is the appropriate sentence for capi-
tal murder.6 

Nor  is  there  any  force  behind  Marsh's  contention  that  an 
equipoise  determination  reflects  juror  confusion  or  inability 
to  decide  between  life  and  death,  or  that  a  jury  may  use 
equipoise as a loophole to shirk its constitutional duty to ren-
der a reasoned, moral decision, see California v.  Brown, 479 
U. S.  538,  545  (1987)  (O'Connor,  J.,  concurring),  regarding 
whether  death  is  an  appropriate  sentence  for  a  particular 
defendant.  Such an argument rests on an implausible char-
acterization  of  the  Kansas statute--that  a  jury's  determina-
tion  that  aggravators  and  mitigators  are  in  equipoise  is  not 
a  decision,  much  less  a  decision  for  death--and  thus  misses 
the  mark.  Cf.  post,  at  206-207  (Souter,

that  mitigators  do  not  outweigh  aggravators--including  a finding  that  aggravators  and  mitigators  are  in  balance--is  a 
decision that death is the appropriate sentence; and an inabil-ity to reach a unanimous decision will result in a sentence of 
life  imprisonment.  So  informed,  far  from  the  abdication  of duty  or  the  inability  to  select  an  appropriate  sentence  de-

Opinion of the Court 
The  dissent's  general  criticisms  against  the  death  penalty are ultimately a call for resolving all legal disputes in capital 

cases by adopting the outcome that makes the death penalty more difficult to impose.  While such a bright-line rule may 
be easily applied, it  has  no basis in law.  Indeed, the  logical consequence of the dissent's argument is that the death pen-
alty can only be just in a system that does not permit error. Because  the  criminal  justice  system  does  not  operate  per-
fectly,  abolition  of  the  death  penalty  is  the  only  answer  to the moral dilemma the dissent poses.  This Court, however, 
does  not  sit  as  a  moral  authority.  Our  precedents  do  not prohibit the States from authorizing the death penalty, even 
in  our  imperfect  system.  And  those precedents  do  not  em-power this Court to chip away at the States' prerogatives to 
do so on the grounds the dissent invokes today. 

* * * 
We hold that the Kansas capital sentencing system, which directs imposition of the death penalty when a jury finds that 

aggravating  and  mitigating  circumstances  are  in  equipoise, is  constitutional.  Accordingly,  we  reverse  the  judgment  of 
the  Kansas Supreme Court and remand  the  case for  further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. 

It is so ordered.

The Court explained that the difference between the two kinds of limita-
tions  is  that  expenditure  limits  "impose  significantly  more  severe  re-
strictions  on  protected freedoms  of  political  expression and  association 
than" do contribution limits.  Id., at 23.  Contribution limits, though a 
"marginal restriction," nevertheless leave the contributor "fre[e] to dis-
cuss candidates and issues."  Id., at 20-21.  Expenditure limits, by con-
trast, impose "[a] restriction on the amount of money a person or group 
can spend on political communication," id., at 19, and thereby necessar-
ily  "reduc[e]  the  quantity  of  expression  by  restricting  the  number  of 
issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audi-
ence reached," ibid.  For over 30 years, in considering the constitution-
ality  of  a  host  of  campaign  finance  statutes,  this  Court  has  adhered  to 
Buckley's constraints, including those on expenditure limits.  See, e. g., 
McConnell v.  Federal Election Comm'n, 540 U. S. 93, 134.  Pp. 241-242. 

(b)  The  respondents  argue  unpersuasively  that  Buckley  should  be 
distinguished from the present cases on a ground they say Buckley did 
not  consider:  that  expenditure  limits  help  to  protect  candidates  from 
spending  too  much  time  raising  money  rather  than  devoting  that  time 
to  campaigning  among  ordinary  voters.  There  is  no  significant  basis 
for  that  distinction.  Act  64's  expenditure  limits  are  not  substantially 
different  from  those  at  issue  in  Buckley.  Nor  is  Vermont's  primary 
justification  for  imposing  its  expenditure  limits  significantly  different 
from  Congress'  rationale  for the  Buckley  limits:  preventing  corruption 
and its appearance.  The respondents say unpersuasively that, had the 
Buckley Court considered the time protection rationale for expenditure 
limits,  the  Court  would  have  upheld  those  limits  in  the  FECA.  The 
Buckley Court, however, was aware of the connection between expendi-
ture limits and a reduction in fundraising time.  And, in any event, the 
connection  seems  perfectly  obvious.  Under  these  circumstances,  the 
respondents' argument amounts to no more than an invitation so to limit 
Buckley's  holding  as  effectively  to  overrule  it.  That  invitation  is  de-
clined.  Pp. 244-246. 

2.  Act  64's  contribution  limits  violate  the  First  Amendment  because 
those  limits,  in  their  specific  details,  burden  protected  interests  in  a 
manner  disproportionate  to  the  public  purposes  they  were  enacted  to 
advance.  Pp. 246-263. 

(a)  In upholding the $1,000 contribution limit before it, the Buckley 
Court recognized, inter alia, that such limits, unlike expenditure limits, 
"involv[e]  little  direct  restraint  on"  the  contributor's  speech,  424  U. S., 
at 21, and are permissible as long as the government demonstrates that 
they  are  "closely  drawn"  to  match  a  "sufficiently  important  interest," 
id., at 25.  It found that the interest there advanced, "prevent[ing] cor-
ruption"  and  its  "appearance,"  was  "sufficiently  important"  to  justify 
the contribution limits, id., at 25-26, and that those limits were "closely

Syllabus 
drawn."  Although recognizing that, in determining whether a particu-
lar contribution limit was "closely drawn," the amount, or level, of that 
limit could make  a difference, see id.,  at 21, the Court added that such 
"distinctions in degree become significant only when they . . .  amount to 
differences  in  kind," id.,  at  30.  Pointing  out  that it  had "no  scalpel to 
probe, whether, say, a $2,000 ceiling might not serve as well as $1,000," 
ibid., the Court  found "no  indication" that FECA's  contribution limita-
tions  would  have  "any  dramatic  adverse  effect  on  the  funding  of  cam-
paigns,"  id.,  at  21.  Since  Buckley,  the  Court  has  consistently  upheld 
contribution limits in other statutes, but has recognized that such limits 
might  sometimes  work  more  harm  to  protected  First  Amendment 
interests  than  their  anticorruption  objectives  could  justify,  see,  e. g., 
Nixon  v.  Shrink  Missouri  Government  PAC,  528  U. S.  377,  395-397. 
Pp. 246-248. 

(b)  Although  the  Court  has  "no  scalpel  to  probe,"  424  U. S.,  at  30, 
with  exactitude  whether  particular  contribution  limits  are  too  low  and 
normally  defers  to  the  legislature  in  that  regard,  it  must  nevertheless 
recognize the existence of some lower bound, as Buckley acknowledges. 
While the interests served by contribution limits, preventing corruption 
and  its  appearance,  "directly  implicate  the  integrity  of  our  electoral 
process," McConnell, supra, at 136, that does not simply mean the lower 
the limit, the better.  Contribution limits that are too low also can harm 
the electoral process by preventing challengers from mounting effective 
campaigns against incumbent officeholders, thereby reducing democratic 
accountability.  Where  there  is  strong  indication  in  a  particular  case, 
i. e., danger signs, that such risks exist (both present in kind and likely 
serious  in  degree),  courts,  including  appellate  courts,  must  review  the 
record  independently  and  carefully  with  an  eye  toward  assessing  the 
statute's "tailoring," i. e., toward assessing the restrictions' proportion-
ality.  See  Bose  Corp.  v.  Consumers  Union  of  United  States,  Inc.,  466 
U. S.  485,  499.  Danger signs  that Act  64's  contribution  limits  may fall 
outside  tolerable  First  Amendment  limits  are  present  here.  They  are 
substantially lower than both the limits the Court has previously upheld 
and  the  comparable  limits  in  force  in  other  States.  Consequently,  the 
record  must  be  examined  to  determine  whether  Act  64's  contribution 
limits are "closely drawn" to match the State's interests.  Pp. 248-253. 

(c)  The record demonstrates that, from a constitutional perspective, 
Act  64's  contribution  limits  are  too  restrictive.  Five  sets  of  factors, 
taken together, lead to the conclusion that those limits are not narrowly 
tailored.  First,  the  record  suggests,  though  it  does  not  conclusively 
prove,  that  Act  64's  contribution  limits  will  significantly  restrict  the 
amount  of  funding  available  for  challengers  to  run  competitive  cam-
paigns.  Second,  Act  64's  insistence  that  a political  party  and all  of  its

Syllabus 
affiliates together abide by exactly the same low $200 to $400 contribu-
tion  limits  that  apply  to  individual  contributors  threatens  harm  to  a 
particularly important political right, the right to associate in a political 
party.  See,  e. g., California Democratic Party  v.  Jones,  530 U. S.  567, 
574.  Although the Court upheld federal limits on political parties' con-
tributions  to  candidates  in  Federal  Election  Comm'n  v.  Colorado  Re-
publican  Federal  Campaign  Comm.,  533  U. S.  431,  the  limits  there  at 
issue were far less problematic, for they were significantly higher than 
Act  64's  limits,  see,  e. g.,  id.,  at  438-439,  and n.  3,  and  they were  much 
higher than the federal limits on contributions from individuals to candi-
dates,  see  id.,  at  453.  Third,  Act  64's  treatment  of  volunteer  services 
aggravates  the  problem.  Although  the  Act  excludes  uncompensated 
volunteer services from its "contribution" definition, it does not exclude 
the  expenses  volunteers  incur,  e. g.,  travel  expenses,  in  the  course  of 
campaign  activities.  The  combination  of  very  low  contribution  lim-
its  and  the  absence  of  an  exception  excluding  volunteer  expenses  may 
well  impede  a  campaign's  ability  effectively  to  use  volunteers,  thereby 
making  it  more  difficult  for  individuals  to  associate  in  this  way. 
Cf. Buckley, supra, at 22.  Fourth, unlike the contribution limits upheld 
in  Shrink,  Act  64's  limits  are  not  adjusted  for  inflation,  but  decline  in 
real value each year.  A failure to index limits means that limits already 
suspiciously  low  will  almost  inevitably  become  too  low  over  time. 
Fifth,  nowhere  in  the  record  is  there  any  special  justification  for  Act 
64's low and restrictive contribution limits.  Rather, the basic justifica-
tions the State has advanced in support of such limits are those present 
in  Buckley.  Indeed,  other  things  being  equal,  one  might  reasonably 
believe  that  a  contribution  of,  say,  $250  (or  $450)  to  a  candidate's  cam-
paign  was  less  likely  to  prove  a  corruptive  force  than  the  far  larger 
contributions at issue in the other campaign finance cases the Court has 
considered.  Pp. 253-262. 

(d)  It  is  not  possible  to  sever  some  of  the  Act's  contribution  limit 
provisions  from  others  that  might  remain  fully  operative.  Doing  so 
would require the Court to write words into the statute (inflation index-
ing),  to  leave  gaping  loopholes  (no  limits  on  party  contributions),  or  to 
foresee which of many different possible ways the Vermont Legislature 
might respond to the constitutional objections to Act  64.  In these cir-
cumstances, the legislature likely would not have intended the Court to 
set  aside  the  statute's  contribution  limits.  The  legislature  is  free  to 
rewrite  those  provisions  to  address  the  constitutional  difficulties  here 
identified.  Pp. 262-263.

bution limits alone cannot effectively deter corruption or its appearance. 
Stare  decisis,  the  basic  legal  principle  commanding  judicial  respect  for 
a court's earlier decisions and their rules of law, prevents the overruling 
of  Buckley.  Adherence  to  precedent  is the  norm; departure  from  it  is 
exceptional,  requiring  "special  justification,"  Arizona  v.  Rumsey,  467 
U. S.  203,  212,  especially  where,  as  here,  the  principle  at  issue  has  be-
come  settled  through  iteration  and  reiteration  over  a  long  period. 
There  is  no  special  justification  here.  Subsequent  case  law  has  not 
made  Buckley a legal anomaly or otherwise  undermined its basic  legal 
principles.  Cf. Dickerson  v.  United  States, 530  U. S.  428,  443.  Nor  is 
there  any  demonstration  that  circumstances  have  changed  so  radically 
as  to  undermine  Buckley's  critical  factual  assumptions.  The  respond-
ents  have  not  shown,  for example,  any  dramatic  increase in  corruption 
or  its  appearance  in  Vermont;  nor  have  they  shown  that  expenditure 
limits  are  the  only  way  to  attack  that  problem.  Cf.  McConnell,  540 
U. S.  93.  Finally,  overruling  Buckley  now  would  dramatically  under-
mine the considerable reliance that Congress and state legislatures have 
placed  upon  it  in  drafting  campaign  finance  laws.  And  this  Court  has 
followed  Buckley,  upholding  and  applying  its  reasoning  in  later  cases.

include expert fees.  The use of "costs" rather than "expenses" strongly 
suggests that  $ 1415(i)(3)(B)  was  not meant  to  be  an  open-ended provi-
sion  making  States  liable  for  all  expenses.  Moreover,  $ 1415(i)(3)(B)

by  $ 1821.  Thus,  $ 1415(i)(3)(B)'s  text  does  not  authorize  an  award  of 
additional  expert  fees,  and  it  certainly  fails  to  present  the  clear  no-
tice  required  by  the  Spending  Clause.  Other  IDEA  provisions  point 
strongly in the same direction.  Of little significance here is a provision 
in the Handicapped Children's Protection Act of 1986 requiring the Gen-
eral Accounting Office to collect data on awards to prevailing parties in 
IDEA  cases, but  making no  mention of consultants  or experts or  their 
fees.  And the fact that the provision directed the GAO to compile data 
on  the  hours  spent  by  consultants  in  IDEA  cases  does  not  mean  that 
Congress  intended  that  States  compensate  prevailing  parties  for  fees 
billed by these consultants.  Pp. 296-300. 

(c)  Crawford Fitting Co. and Casey strongly reinforce the conclusion 
that  the  IDEA  does  not  unambiguously  authorize  prevailing  parents 
to recover expert fees.  Crawford Fitting Co.'s reasoning supports the 
conclusion that the term "costs" in $ 1415(i)(3)(B), like "costs" in Federal 
Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  54(d),  the  provision  at  issue  there,  is  defined 
by  the  categories  of  expenses  enumerated  in  28  U. S. C.  $ 1920.  This 
conclusion is buttressed by the principle, recognized in Crawford Fitting 
Co.,  that  no  statute  will  be  construed  to  authorize  taxing  witness  fees 
as  costs  unless  the  statute  "refer[s]  explicitly  to  witness  fees."  482 
U. S., at 445.  The conclusion that the IDEA does not authorize expert 
fee  awards  is  confirmed  even  more  dramatically  by  Casey,  where  the 
Court held that 42 U. S. C. $ 1988, a fee-shifting provision with wording 
virtually identical to that of 20 U. S. C. $ 1415(i)(3)(B), did not empower 
a  district  court  to  award  expert  fees  to  a  prevailing  party.  499  U. S., 
at  102.  The  Second  Circuit  misunderstood  the  meaning  of  the  Casey 
footnote  on  which  it  relied.  That  footnote  did  not  state  that  the  Con-
ference  Committee  Report  set  out  the  correct  interpretation  of 

$ 1415(i)(3)(B) or provided the clear notice required under the Spending 
Clause.  Its thrust was simply that "attorneys' fees," standing alone, is 
generally  not  understood  as  encompassing  expert  fees.  Pp.  300-303. 

(d)  Respondents' additional arguments are unpersuasive.  The 
IDEA's goals of "ensur[ing] that all children with disabilities have avail-
able to them a free appropriate public education," $ 1400(d)(1)(A), and of 
safeguarding parents' right to challenge adverse school decisions are too 
general  to  provide  much  support for  their  reading  of  the  IDEA.  And

Opinion of the Court 

recover  fees  for  services  rendered  by  experts  in  IDEA  ac-tions.  We hold that it does not. 

I 
Respondents  Pearl  and  Theodore  Murphy  filed  an  action under the IDEA on behalf of their son, Joseph Murphy, seek-

ing  to  require  petitioner  Arlington  Central  School  District Board  of  Education  to  pay  for  their  son's  private  school  tu-
ition  for  specified  school  years.  Respondents  prevailed  in the District Court, 86 F. Supp. 2d 354 (SDNY 2000), and the 
Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Second  Circuit  affirmed,  297  F.  3d 195 (2002). 

As prevailing parents, respondents then sought $29,350 in fees  for  the  services  of  an  educational  consultant,  Marilyn 
Arons, who assisted  respondents  throughout the IDEA pro-ceedings.  The District Court  granted  respondents'  request 
in  part.  It  held  that  only  the  value  of  Arons'  time  spent between  the  hearing  request  and  the  ruling  in  respondents' 
favor  could  properly  be  considered  charges  incurred  in  an "action or proceeding brought" under the Act, see 20 U. S. C. 

$ 1415(i)(3)(B).  2003  WL  21694398,  *9  (SDNY,  July  22, 2003).  This reduced the maximum recovery to $8,650.  The 
District  Court  also  held  that  Arons,  a  nonlawyer,  could  be compensated  only  for  time  spent  on  expert  consulting  serv-
ices, not for time spent on legal representation, id., at *4, but it concluded that all the relevant time could be characterized 
as falling within the compensable category, and thus allowed compensation for the full $8,650, id., at *10. 

The  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Second  Circuit  affirmed. 402 F. 3d 332 (2005).  Acknowledging that other Circuits had 
taken the opposite view, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit  held  that  "Congress  intended  to  and  did  authorize 
the reimbursement of expert fees in IDEA actions."  Id., at 336.  The  court  began  by  discussing  two  decisions  of  this 
Court  holding  that  expert  fees  could  not  be  recovered  as taxed  costs  under  particular cost- or fee-shifting provisions.

Opinion of the Court 
See Crawford Fitting Co. v.  J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U. S. 437 
(1987) (interpreting Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 54(d) and 28 U. S. C. 

$ 1920);  West  Virginia  Univ.  Hospitals,  Inc.  v.  Casey,  499 
U. S.  83  (1991)  (interpreting  42  U. S. C.  $ 1988  (1988  ed.)). 
According to these decisions, the  court noted, a  cost- or fee-
shifting  provision  will  not  be  read  to  permit  a  prevailing 
party to recover expert fees without " `explicit statutory au-
thority'  indicating  that  Congress  intended  for  that  sort  of 
fee-shifting."  402 F. 3d, at 336. 

Ultimately,  though,  the  court  was  persuaded  by  a  state-
ment  in  the  Conference  Committee  Report  relating  to  20 
U. S. C.  $ 1415(i)(3)(B)  and  by  a  footnote  in  Casey  that  made 
reference to that Report.  402 F. 3d, at 336-337 (citing H. R. 
Conf. Rep. No. 99-687, p. 5 (1986)).  Based on these authori-
ties, the court concluded that it was required to interpret the 
IDEA  to  authorize  the  award  of  the  costs  that  prevailing 
parents incur in hiring experts.  402 F. 3d, at 336. 

We granted certiorari, 546 U. S. 1085 (2006), to resolve the 
conflict  among  the  Circuits  with  respect  to  whether  Con-
gress authorized the compensation of expert fees to prevail-
ing parents in IDEA actions.  Compare Goldring v.  District 
of Columbia, 416 F. 3d 70, 73-77 (CADC 2005); Neosho R-V 
School Dist. v.  Clark ex rel. Clark, 315 F. 3d 1022, 1031-1033 
(CA8 2003); T.  D.  v.  LaGrange School Dist. No. 102, 349 F. 3d 
469, 480-482 (CA7 2003), with 402 F. 3d 332 (CA2 2005).  We 
now reverse.

Our  resolution  of  the  question  presented  in  this  case  is 
guided by the fact that Congress enacted the IDEA pursuant 
to  the  Spending  Clause.  U. S.  Const.,  Art.  I,  $ 8,  cl.  1;  see 
Schaffer  v.  Weast,  546  U. S.  49  (2005).  Like  its  statutory 
predecessor, the IDEA provides federal funds to assist state 
and local agencies in educating children with disabilities "and 
conditions  such  funding  upon  a  State's  compliance  with  ex-
tensive  goals  and  procedures."  Board  of  Ed.  of  Hendrick

MURPHY 

Opinion of the Court 

Hudson  Central  School  Dist.,  Westchester  Cty.  v.  Rowley, 458 U. S. 176, 179 (1982). 

Congress  has  broad  power  to  set  the  terms  on  which  it disburses  federal  money  to  the  States,  see,  e. g.,  South  Da-
kota  v.  Dole,  483  U. S.  203,  206-207  (1987),  but  when  Con-gress  attaches  conditions  to  a  State's  acceptance  of  federal 
funds,  the  conditions  must  be  set  out  "unambiguously,"  see 
Pennhurst  State  School  and  Hospital  v.  Halderman,  451 U. S.  1,  17  (1981);  Rowley,  supra,  at  204,  n.  26.  "[L]egisla-

tion  enacted  pursuant  to  the  spending  power  is  much in  the nature  of  a  contract,"  and  therefore,  to  be  bound  by  "feder-
ally imposed conditions," recipients of federal funds must ac-cept  them  "voluntarily  and  knowingly."  Pennhurst,  451 
U. S.,  at  17.  States  cannot  knowingly  accept  conditions  of which  they  are  "unaware"  or  which  they  are  "unable  to  as-
certain."  Ibid.  Thus,  in  the  present  case,  we  must  view the  IDEA from  the  perspective  of a  state  official  who  is  en-
gaged  in  the  process  of  deciding  whether  the  State  should accept  IDEA  funds  and  the  obligations  that  go  with  those 
funds.  We  must  ask  whether  such  a  state  official  would clearly  understand  that  one  of  the  obligations  of  the  Act  is 
the  obligation  to  compensate  prevailing  parents  for  expert fees.  In  other  words,  we  must  ask  whether  the  IDEA  fur-
nishes clear notice regarding the liability at issue in this case.

A 

In  considering  whether  the  IDEA  provides  clear  notice, we  begin  with  the  text.  We  have  "stated  time  and  again 

that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what  it  means  and  means  in  a  statute  what  it  says  there." 
Connecticut  Nat.  Bank  v.  Germain,  503  U. S.  249,  253-254 (1992).  When  the  statutory  "language  is  plain,  the  sole 
function  of  the  courts--at  least  where  the  disposition  re-quired  by  the  text  is  not  absurd--is  to  enforce  it  according 
to  its  terms."  Hartford  Underwriters  Ins.  Co.  v.  Union

Opinion of the Court 
Planters  Bank,  N.  A.,  530  U. S.  1,  6  (2000)  (quoting  United 
States  v.  Ron  Pair  Enterprises,  Inc.,  489  U. S.  235,  241 
(1989),  in  turn quoting Caminetti v.  United States, 242  U. S. 470, 485 (1917); internal quotation marks omitted). 

The  gover ni ng  prov isi on  of  the  ID EA,  20  U. S. C. $ 1415(i)(3)(B),  provides  that  "[i]n  any  action  or  proceeding 
brought  under  this  section,  the  court,  in  its  discretion,  may 
award reasonable attorneys' fees as part of the costs" to the parents  of  "a  child  with  a  disability"  who  is  the  "prevailing 

party."  While this provision provides for an award of "rea-sonable  attorneys'  fees,"  this  provision  does  not  even  hint 
that acceptance of IDEA funds makes a State responsible for 
reimbursing  prevailing  parents  for  services  rendered  by 
experts. 

Respondents  contend  that  we  should  interpret  the  term 
"costs" in accordance with its meaning in ordinary usage and 
that $ 1415(i)(3)(B) should therefore be read to "authorize re-
imbursement of all costs parents incur in IDEA proceedings, 
including expert costs."  Brief for Respondents 17. 

This  argument  has  multiple  flaws.  For  one  thing,  as  the 
Court  of  Appeals  in  this  case  acknowledged,  " `costs'  is  a 
term  of  art  that  generally  does  not  include  expert  fees." 
402  F.  3d,  at  336.  The  use  of  this  term  of  art,  rather  than 
a  ter m  such  as  "expenses, "  strong l y  suggests  that 

$ 1415(i)(3)(B)  was  not  meant  to  be  an  open-ended  provision 
that  makes  participating  States  liable  for  all  expenses  in-
curred  by  prevailing  parents  in  connection  with  an  IDEA 
case--for example, travel and lodging expenses or lost wages 
due to time taken off from work.  Moreover, contrary to re-
spondents'  suggestion,  $ 1415(i)(3)(B)  does  not  say  that  a 
court may award "costs" to prevailing parents; rather, it says 
that  a  court  may  award  reasonable  attorney's  fees  "as  part 
of  the  costs"  to  prevailing  parents.  This  language  simply 
adds  reasonable  attorney's  fees  incurred  by  prevailing  par-
ents to the list of costs that prevailing parents are otherwise 
entitled to recover.  This list of otherwise recoverable costs

MURPHY 

Opinion of the Court 

is obviously the  list set  out  in  28 U. S. C.  $ 1920, the  general 
statute governing the  taxation of costs  in federal  court,  and 
the  recovery  of  witness  fees  under  $ 1920  is  strictly  limited 
by  $ 1821,  which  authorizes  travel  reimbursement  and  a  $40 
per  diem.  Thus,  the  text  of  20  U. S. C.  $ 1415(i)(3)(B)  does 
not  authorize  an  award  of  any  additional  expert  fees,  and  it 
certainly  fails  to  provide  the  clear  notice  that  is  required 
under the Spending Clause. 

Other  provisions  of  the  IDEA  point  strongly  in  the  same 
direction.  While authorizing the award of reasonable attor-
ney's  fees,  the  Act  contains  detailed  provisions  that  are  de-
signed  to  ensure  that  such  awards  are  indeed  reasonable. 
See  $$ 1415(i)(3)(C)-(G).  The  absence  of  any  comparable 
provisions  relating  to expert fees strongly suggests that re-
covery of expert  fees is  not authorized.  Moreover,  the lack 
of any reference to expert fees in $ 1415(d)(2) gives rise to a 
similar  inference.  This  provision,  which  generally  requires 
that  parents  receive  "a  full  explanation  of  the  procedural 
safeguards"  available  under  $ 1415  and  refers  expressly  to 
"attorneys' fees," makes no mention of expert fees. 

B 
Respondents  contend  that  their  interpretation  of  $ 1415(i) 
(3)(B)  is  supported  by  a  provision  of  the  Handicapped 
Children's  Protection  Act  of  1986  that  required  the  General 
Accounting Office (GAO) to collect certain data, $ 4(b)(3), 100 
Stat.  797  (hereinafter  GAO  study  provision),  but  this  provi-
sion is  of little  significance  for present  purposes.  The  GAO 
study  provision  directed  the  Comptroller  General,  acting 
through  the  GAO,  to  compile  data  on,  among  other  things: 
"(A)  the  specific  amount  of  attorneys'  fees,  costs,  and  ex-
penses  awarded  to  the  prevailing  party"  in  IDEA  cases  for 
a  particular  period  of  time,  and  (B)  "the  number  of  hours 
spent  by  personnel,  including  attorneys  and  consultants,  in-
volved  in  the  action  or  proceeding,  and  expenses  incurred

Opinion of the Court 
by  the  parents  and  the  State  educational  agency  and  local educational agency."  Id., at 797-798. 

Subparagraph  (A)  would  provide  some  support  for  re-spondents' position if it directed the GAO to compile data on 
awards to prevailing parties of the expense of hiring consult-ants, but that is not what subparagraph (A) says.  Subpara-
graph  (A)  makes  no  mention  of  consultants  or  experts  or their fees.

1 

Subparagraph  (B)  similarly  does  not  help  respondents. Subparagraph (B), which directs the GAO to study "the num-

ber  of  hours  spent  [in  IDEA  cases]  by  personnel,  in-cluding  .  .  .  consultants,"  says  nothing  about  the  award  of 
fees  to  such  consultants.  Just  because  Congress  directed the GAO to compile statistics on the hours spent by consult-
ants  in  IDEA  cases,  it  does  not  follow  that  Congress  meant for States to compensate prevailing parties for the fees billed 
by these consultants. Respondents  maintain  that  "Congress'  direction  to  the 
GAO  would  be  inexplicable  if  Congress  did  not  anticipate that  the  expenses  for  `consultants'  would  be  recoverable," 

1 Because  subparagraph  (A)  refers  to  both  "costs"  and  "expenses" 
awarded  to  prevailing  parties  and  because  it  is  generally  presumed  that 
statutory  language  is  not  superfluous, it  could  be  argued  that  this  provi-
sion  manifests  the  expectation  that  prevailing  parties  would  be  awarded 
certain "expenses" not included in the list of "costs" set out in 28 U. S. C. 

$ 1920  and  that  expert  fees  were  intended  to  be  among  these  unenumer-
ated "expenses."  This argument fails because, whatever expectation this 
language might seem to evidence, the fact remains that neither 20 U. S. C. 

$ 1415  nor  any  other  provision  of  the  IDEA  authorizes  the  award  of  any 
"expenses"  other  than  "costs."  Recognizing  this,  respondents  argue  not 
that they are entitled to recover "expenses" that are not "costs," but that 
expert fees are recoverable "costs."  As a result, the reference to awards 
of  both  "expenses"  and  "costs"  does  not  support  respondents'  position. 
The reference to "expenses" may relate to IDEA actions brought in state 
court, $ 1415(i)(2)(A), where "expenses" other than "costs" might be receiv-
able.  Or  the  reference  may  be  surplusage.  While  it  is  generally  pre-
sumed that statutes do not contain surplusage, instances of surplusage are 
not unknown.

MURPHY 

Opinion of the Court 

Brief  for  Respondents  19,  but  this  is  incorrect.  There  are many reasons why Congress might have wanted the GAO to 

gather  data on  expenses  that  were not  to  be  taxed  as  costs. Knowing the costs incurred by IDEA litigants might be use-
ful  in  considering  future  procedural  amendments  (which might  affect  these  costs)  or  a  future  amendment  regarding 
fee shifting.  And, in fact, it is apparent that the GAO study provision covered expenses that could not be taxed as costs. 
For  example,  the  GAO  was  instructed  to  compile  statistics on  the  hours  spent  by  all  attorneys  involved  in  an  IDEA 
action  or  proceeding,  even  though  the  Act  did  not  provide for  the  recovery  of  attorney's  fees  by  a  prevailing  state  or 
local  educational  agency.2  Similarly,  the  GAO  was  directed to  compile  data  on  "expenses  incurred  by  the  parents,"  not 
just  those  parents  who  prevail  and  are  thus  eligible  to  re-cover taxed costs. 

In  sum,  the  terms  of  the  IDEA  overwhelmingly  support the  conclusion  that  prevailing  parents  may  not  recover  the 
costs  of  experts  or  consultants.  Certainly  the  terms  of  the IDEA  fail  to  provide  the  clear  notice  that  would  be  needed 
to attach such a condition to a State's receipt of IDEA funds. 

IV 
Thus  far,  we  have  considered  only  the  text  of  the  IDEA, but  perhaps  the  strongest  support  for  our  interpretation  of 

the  IDEA  is  supplied  by  our  decisions  and  reasoning  in C

rawford Fitting, 482 U. S. 437, and Casey, 499 U. S. 83.  In light  of  those  decisions,  we  do  not  see  how  it  can  be  said 

2 In  2000,  the  attorney's  fees  provision  provided  only  an  award  to  pre-
vailing parents.  See 20 U. S. C. $ 1415(i)(3)(B).  In 2004, Congress 
amended  $ 1415(i)(3)(B)  to  include  two  additional  awards.  See  $ 101,  118 
Stat. 2724.  The amendments provided awards "to a prevailing party who 
is a State educational agency or local educational agency" where the com-
plaint  filed  is  frivolous  or  presented  for  an  improper  purpose,  such  as 
to  harass,  delay,  or  increase  the  cost  of  litigation.  See  20  U. S. C. 

$$ 1415(i)(3)(B)(i)(II)-(III) (2000 ed., Supp. V).

Opinion of the Court 
that  the  IDEA  gives  a  State  unambiguous  notice  regarding liability for expert fees. 

In Crawford Fitting, the Court rejected an argument very similar  to  respondents'  argument  that  the  term  "costs"  in 

$ 1415(i)(3)(B)  should  be  construed  as  an  open-ended  refer-ence  to  prevailing  parents'  expenses.  It  was  argued  in 
Crawford Fitting that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d), 
which provides for the award of "costs" to a prevailing party, authorizes the award  of costs not listed  in 28 U. S. C. $ 1821. 

482  U. S., at 439.  The  Court held, however, that Rule  54(d) does  not  give  a  district  judge  "discretion  to  tax  whatever 
costs  may  seem  appropriate";  rather,  the  term  "costs"  in 
Rule 54(d) is defined by the list set out in $ 1920.  Id., at 441. 
Because the recovery of witness fees, see $ 1920(3), is strictly 
limited  by $ 1821, the  Court  observed, a  broader  interpreta-
tion  of  Rule  54(d)  would  mean  that  the  Rule  implicitly  ef-
fected a partial repeal of those provisions.  Id., at 442.  But, 
the  Court warned,  "[w]e will not  lightly  infer that  Congress 
has  repealed  $$ 1920  and  1821,  either  through  Rule  54(d)  or 
any other provision not referring explicitly to witness fees." 
Id., at 445. 

The  reasoning  of  Crawford  Fitting  strongly  supports  the 
conclusion that the term "costs" in 20 U. S. C. $ 1415(i)(3)(B), 
like the same term in Rule 54(d), is defined by the categories 
of  expenses  enumerated  in  28  U. S. C.  $ 1920.  This  conclu-
sion  is  buttressed  by  the  principle,  recognized  in  Crawford 
Fitting, that  no statute will be construed as authorizing the 
taxation  of  witness  fees  as  costs  unless  the  statute  "refer[s] 
explicitly  to  witness  fees."  482  U. S.,  at  445;  see  also  ibid. 
("[A]bsent explicit statutory or contractual authorization for 
the  taxation  of  the  expenses  of  a  litigant's  witness  as  costs, 
federal  courts  are  bound  by  the  limitations  set  out  in  28 
U. S. C. $ 1821 and $ 1920"). 

Our  decision  in  Casey  confirms  even  more  dramatically 
that  the  IDEA  does  not  authorize  an  award  of  expert  fees. 
In  Casey, as  noted above,  we interpreted  a  fee-shifting  pro-

vision,  42  U. S. C.  $ 1988,  the  relevant  wording  of  which was  virtually  identical  to  the  wording  of  20  U. S. C. 

$ 1415(i)(3)(B).  Compare  ibid.  (authorizing  the  award  of "reasonable attorneys' fees as part of the costs" to prevailing 
parents)  with  42  U. S. C.  $ 1988  (1988  ed.)  (permitting  pre-vailing  parties  in  certain  civil  rights  actions  to  be  awarded 
"a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs").  We held 
that $ 1988 did not empower a district court to award expert fees to a prevailing party. 

Casey, supra, at 102.  To decide 
in favor of respondents here, we would have to interpret the virtually  identical  language  in  20  U. S. C.  $ 1415  as  having 

exactly the opposite meaning.  Indeed, we would have to go 
further  and  hold  that  the  relevant  language  in  the  IDEA 
unambiguously  means  exactly  the  opposite  of  what  the 
nearly  identical  language  in  42  U. S. C.  $ 1988  was  held  to 
mean in Casey. 

The  Court  of  Appeals,  as  noted  above,  was  heavily  influ-
enced by a Casey footnote, see 402 F. 3d, at 336-337 (quoting 
499  U. S.,  at  91-92,  n.  5),  but  the  court  misunderstood  the 
footnote's meaning.  The text accompanying the footnote ar-
gued,  based  on  an  analysis  of  several  fee-shifting  statutes, 
that the term "attorney's fees" does not include expert fees. 
Id., at 88-91.  In the footnote, we commented on petitioners' 
invocation  of  the  Conference  Committee  Report  relating  to 
20  U. S. C.  $ 1415(i)(3)(B),  which  stated:  " `The  conferees  in-
tend[ed]  that  the  term  "attorneys'  fees  as  part  of  the  costs" 
include reasonable expenses and fees of expert witnesses and 
the reasonable costs of any test or evaluation which is found 
to  be  necessary  for  the  preparation  of  the  .  .  .  case.' "  499 
U. S., at 91-92, n. 5 (quoting H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 99-687, at 
5;  ellipsis  in  original).  This  statement,  the  footnote  com-
mented,  was  "an  apparent  effort  to  depart  from  ordinary 
meaning  and to define a term of art."  499 U. S., at 92,  n. 5. 
The  footnote  did  not  state  that  the  Conference  Committee 
Report  set  out  the  correct  interpretation  of  $ 1415(i)(3)(B), 
much  less  that  the  Report  was  sufficient,  despite  the  lan-

Opinion of the Court 
guage  of  the  statute,  to  provide  the  clear  notice  required under the Spending Clause.  The thrust of the footnote was 

simply  that  the  term  "attorneys'  fees,"  standing  alone,  is generally  not  understood  as  encompassing  expert  fees. 
Thus,  Crawford  Fitting  and  Casey  strongly  reinforce  the conclusion that the IDEA does not unambiguously authorize 
prevailing parents to recover expert fees. 

V 
Respondents  make  several  arguments  that  are  not  based on  the  text  of  the  IDEA,  but  these  arguments  do  not  show 

that the  IDEA provides clear notice  regarding the award  of expert fees. 

Respondents  argue  that  their  interpretation  of  the  IDEA furthers  the  Act's  overarching  goal  of  "ensur[ing]  that  all 
children with disabilities have available to them a free appro-priate  public  education,"  20  U. S. C.  $ 1400(d)(1)(A),  as  well 
as  the  goal  of  "safeguard[ing]  the  rights  of  parents  to  chal-lenge  school  decisions  that  adversely  affect  their  child." 
Brief  for  Respondents  20.  These  goals,  however,  are  too general to provide much support for respondents' reading of 
the terms of the IDEA.  The IDEA obviously does not seek to promote these goals at the expense of all other considera-
tions,  including  fiscal  considerations.  Because  the  IDEA  is not intended in all instances to further the broad goals iden-
tified by respondents at the  expense of fiscal considerations, the goals cited by respondents do little to bolster their argu-
ment on the narrow question presented here.3 

3 Respondents  note  that  a  GAO  report  stated  that  expert  witness  fees 
are  reimbursable  expenses.  See  Brief  for  Respondents  19  (citing  GAO, 
Briefing Report to Congressional Requesters, Special Education: The At-
torney Fees Provision of Public Law 99-372 (GAO/HRD-90-22BR), p. 13 
(Nov. 1989)).  But this passing reference in a report issued by an agency 
not  responsible  for  implementing  the  IDEA  is  plainly  insufficient  to  pro-
vide  clear  notice  regarding  the  scope  of  the  conditions  attached  to  the 
receipt of IDEA funds.

Syllabus 
court  arguing, for the first  time, that authorities had violated his right 
to  consular  notification  under  Article  36.  The  court  dismissed  that 
claim as procedurally barred because he had failed to raise it at trial or 
on appeal.  The Virginia Supreme Court found no reversible error. 

Held:  Even  assuming  without  deciding  that  the  Convention  creates  judi-

cially  enforceable  rights,  suppression  is  not  an  appropriate  remedy  for 
a  violation,  and  a  State  may  apply  its  regular  procedural  default  rules 
to Convention claims.  Pp. 342-360. 

(a)  Because  petitioners  are  not  in  any  event  entitled  to  relief,  the 
Court  need  not  resolve  whether  the  Convention  grants  individuals  en-
forceable  rights,  but  assumes,  without  deciding,  that  Article  36  does 
so.  Pp. 342-343. 

(b)  Neither the Convention itself nor this Court's precedents applying 
the  exclusionary  rule  support  suppression  of  a  defendant's  statements 
to police as a remedy for an Article 36 violation. 

The  Convention  does  not  mandate  suppression  or  any  other  specific 
remedy,  but  expressly  leaves  Article  36's  implementation  to  domestic 
law: Article 36 rights must "be exercised in conformity with the laws . . . 
of  the  receiving  State."  Art.  36(2).  Sanchez-Llamas'  argument  that 
suppression  is  appropriate  under  United  States  law  and  should  be  re-
quired under the Court's authority to develop remedies for the enforce-
ment of federal law in state-court criminal proceedings is rejected.  "It 
is  beyond  dispute  that  [this  Court  does]  not  hold  a  supervisory  power 
over the [state] courts."  Dickerson v.  United States, 530 U. S. 428, 438. 
The exclusionary rule cases on which Sanchez-Llamas principally relies 
are inapplicable because they rest on the Court's supervisory authority 
over federal courts. 

The  Court's  authority  to  create  a  judicial  remedy  applicable  in  state 
court  must  therefore  lie,  if  anywhere,  in  the  treaty  itself.  Where  a 
treaty provides for a particular judicial remedy, courts must apply it as 
a requirement of federal law.  Cf., e. g., United States v.  Giordano, 416 
U. S.  505,  524-525.  But  where  a  treaty  does  not  provide  a  particular 
remedy, either expressly or implicitly, it is not for the federal courts to 
impose one on the States through lawmaking of their own.  Even if the 
"full effect" language of Article 36(2) implicitly requires a judicial rem-
edy, as Sanchez-Llamas claims, that Article equally requires that Article 
36(1)  rights  be  exercised  in  conformity  with  domestic  law.  Under  do-
mestic  law,  the  exclusionary  rule  is  not  a  remedy  this  Court  applies 
lightly.  It  has  been  used  primarily  to  deter  certain  Fourth  and  Fifth 
Amendment violations, including, e. g., unconstitutional searches and sei-
zures, Mapp v.  Ohio, 367 U. S. 643, 655-657, and confessions exacted in

Syllabus 
violation  of  the  right  against  compelled  self-incrimination  or  due  proc-
ess, Dickerson, supra, at 435.  In contrast, Article 36 has nothing to do 
with searches or interrogations and, indeed, does not guarantee defend-
ants  any  assistance  at  all.  It  secures  for  foreign  nationals  only  the 
right to have their consulate informed of their arrest or detention--not 
to have their consulate intervene, or to have police cease their investiga-
tion pending any such notice or intervention.  Moreover, the failure to 
inform  a  defendant  of  his  Article  36  rights  is  unlikely,  with  any  fre-
quency,  to  produce  unreliable  confessions,  see  Watkins v.  Sowders,  449 
U. S. 341, 347, or to give the police any practical advantage in obtaining 
incriminating evidence, see Elkins v.  United States, 364 U. S. 206,  217. 
Suppression would also be a vastly disproportionate remedy for an Arti-
cle  36  violation.  The  interests  Sanchez-Llamas  claims  Article  36  ad-
vances  are  effectively  protected  by  other  constitutional  and  statutory 
requirements,  including  the  right  to  an  attorney  and  to  protection 
against  compelled  self-incrimination.  Finally,  suppression  is  not  the 
only  means  of  vindicating  Article  36  rights.  For  example,  diplomatic 
avenues--the  primary  means  of  enforcing  the  Vienna  Convention--re-
main open.  Pp. 343-350. 

(c)  States  may  subject  Article  36  claims  to  the  same  procedural  de-
fault rules that apply generally to other federal-law claims. 

This question is controlled by the Court's holding in Breard v.  Greene, 
523 U. S. 371, 375 (per curiam), that the petitioner's failure to raise an 
Article  36  claim  in  state  court  prevented  him  from  having  the  claim 
heard  in  a  subsequent  federal  habeas  proceeding.  Bustillo's  two  rea-
sons why Breard does not control are rejected. 

First, he argues that Breard's  procedural default holding was unnec-
essary to the result because the petitioner there could not demonstrate 
prejudice from the default and because, in any event, the later enacted 
Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 superseded any 
right the petitioner had under the Vienna Convention to have his claim 
heard  on collateral  review.  Resolution  of  the procedural  default  ques-
tion, however, was the principal reason for denying the Breard petition-
er's  claim,  and  the  discussion  of  the  issue  occupied  the  bulk  of  the 
Court's reasoning.  See 523 U. S., at 375-377.  It is no answer to argue 
that the procedural default holding was unnecessary simply because the 
petitioner had several other ways to lose. 

Second,  Bustillo  asserts  that  since  Breard,  the  ICJ's  LaGrand  and 
Avena decisions have interpreted the Convention to preclude the appli-
cation  of  procedural  default  rules  to  Article  36  claims.  Although  the 
ICJ's interpretation deserves "respectful consideration," Breard, supra, 
at 375, it does not compel the Court to reconsider Breard's understand-

ing  of  the  Convention.  "The  judicial  Power  of  the  United  States"  is 
"vested  in  one  supreme  Court . . . and  .  . . inferior  Courts."  U. S. 
Const.,  Art.  III,  $ 1.  That  "Power . . .  extend[s]  to . . .  Treaties,"  id., 

$ 2, and includes the duty "to say what the law is," Marbury v. Madison, 
1  Cranch  137,  177.  If  treaties  are  to  be  given  effect  as  federal  law, 
determining  their  meaning  as  a  matter  of  federal  law  "is  emphatically 
the province  and  duty  of the  judicial  department,"  headed  by  the "one 
supreme  Court."  Ibid.  Nothing  in  the  ICJ's  structure  or  purpose 
suggests  that  its  interpretations  were  intended  to  be  binding  on  U.  S. 
courts.  Even  according "respectful  consideration,"  the ICJ's interpre-
tation  cannot  overcome  the  plain  import  of  Article  36(2),  which  states 
that the rights it implements "shall be exercised in conformity with the 
laws . . . of the  receiving State."  In the United States, this means that 
the rule of procedural default--which applies even to claimed violations 
of our own Constitution, see Engle v.  Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 129--applies 
also  to  Vienna  Convention  claims.  Bustillo  points  to  nothing  in  the 
drafting  history  of  Article  36  or  in  the  contemporary  practice  of  other 
Convention  signatories  that  undermines  this  conclusion.  LaGrand's 
conclusion that applying the procedural default rule denies "full effect" 
to the purposes of Article 36, by preventing courts from attaching legal 
significance  to  an  Article  36  violation,  is  inconsistent  with  the  basic 
framework of an adversary system.  Such a system relies chiefly on the 
parties to raise significant issues and present them to the courts in the 
appropriate manner at the appropriate time for adjudication.  See Cas-
tro v.  United States, 540 U. S. 375, 386.  Procedural default rules gener-
ally take on greater importance in an adversary system than in the sort 
of magistrate-directed, inquisitorial legal system characteristic of many 
of  the  other  Convention  signatories.  Under  the  ICJ's  reading  of  "full 
effect," Article 36 claims could trump not only procedural default rules, 
but  any  number  of  other  rules  requiring  parties  to  present  their  legal 
claims at the appropriate time for adjudication, such as statutes of limi-
tations and prohibitions against filing successive habeas petitions.  This 
sweeps  too  broadly,  for  it  reads  the  "full  effect"  proviso  in  a  way  that 
leaves  little  room  for  the  clear  instruction  in  Article  36(2)  that  Article 
36 rights "be exercised in conformity with the laws . . . of the  receiving 
State."  A  comparison  with  a  suspect's  rights  under  Miranda  v.  Ari-
zona, 384 U. S. 436, disposes of Bustillo's "full  effect" claim.  Although 
the  failure  to  inform  defendants  of  their  right  to  consular  notification 
may  prevent  them  from  becoming  aware  of  their  Article  36  rights  and 
asserting  them  at  trial,  precisely  the  same  thing  is  true  of  Miranda 
rights.  Nevertheless, if a defendant fails to raise his Miranda claim at 
trial,  procedural  default  rules  may bar  him  from  raising  the  claim in  a

subsequent postconviction proceeding.  Wainwright v.  Sykes, 433 U. S. 
72,  87.  Bustillo's  attempt  to  analogize  an  Article  36  claim  to  a  claim 
under  Brady  v.  Maryland,  373  U. S.  83,  that  the  prosecution  failed  to 
disclose exculpatory evidence is inapt.  Finally, his argument that Arti-
cle  36  claims  are  most  appropriately  raised  post-trial  or  on  collateral

Opinion of the Court 
countries  are  party  to  the  Convention.  The  United  States, upon the  advice and  consent of the  Senate, ratified the  Con-

vention in 1969.  Id., at 77. Article 36 of the Convention concerns consular officers' ac-
cess  to  their  nationals  detained  by  authorities  in  a  foreign country.  The  article  provides  that  "if  he  so  requests,  the 
competent  authorities  of  the  receiving  State  shall,  without delay, inform the consular post of the sending State if, within 
its  consular  district,  a  national  of  that  State  is  arrested  or committed  to  prison  or  to  custody  pending  trial  or  is  de-
tained in any other manner."  Art. 36(1)(b), id., at 101.1  In other  words,  when  a  national  of  one  country  is  detained  by

"1.  With a view to facilitating the exercise of consular functions relating 
to nationals of the sending State: 

"(a)  consular officers shall be free to communicate with nationals of the 
sending State and to have access to them.  Nationals of the sending State 
shall have the same freedom with respect  to communication with and ac-
cess to consular officers of the sending State; 

"(b)  if  he so requests,  the competent authorities of  the receiving  State 
shall,  without  delay,  inform  the  consular  post  of  the  sending  State  if, 
within  its  consular  district,  a  national  of  that  State  is  arrested  or  com-
mitted  to  prison  or  to  custody  pending  trial  or  is  detained  in  any  other 
manner.  Any communication  addressed to  the  consular post by the  per-
son  arrested,  in  prison,  custody  or  detention  shall  also  be  forwarded  by 
the  said authorities without  delay.  The said  authorities shall inform  the 
person concerned without delay of his rights under this sub-paragraph; 

"(c)  consular officers shall have the right to visit a national of the send-
ing  State  who  is  in  prison,  custody  or  detention,  to  converse  and  corre-
spond  with  him  and  to  arrange  for  his  legal  representation.  They  shall 
also  have  the  right  to  visit  any  national  of  the  sending  State  who  is  in 
prison,  custody or  detention in  their district  in  pursuance  of a  judgment. 
Nevertheless,  consular  officers  shall  refrain  from  taking  action  on  behalf 
of a national who is in prison, custody or detention if he expressly opposes 
such action. 

"2.  The  rights referred  to  in  paragraph  1  of  this Article  shall be  exer-
cised  in  conformity  with  the  laws  and  regulations  of  the  receiving  State, 
subject  to  the  proviso,  however,  that  the  said  laws  and  regulations  must 
enable full effect to be given to the purposes for which the rights accorded 
under this Article are intended."  21 U. S. T., at 100-101.

so  requests.  Article  36(1)(b)  further  states  that  "[t]he  said authorities shall inform the person concerned [i. e., the 
detainee]  without  delay  of  his  rights  under  this  sub-paragraph."  Ibid.  The Convention  also provides guidance 
regarding  how  these  requirements,  and  the  other  require-ments of Article 36, are to be implemented: 

"The  rights  referred  to  in  paragraph  1  of  this  Article shall be exercised in conformity with the laws and regu-

Petitioner  Moises  Sanchez-Llamas  is  a  Mexican  national. In December 1999, he was involved in an exchange of gunfire 

with  police  in  which  one  officer  suffered  a  gunshot  wound in  the  leg.  Police  arrested  Sanchez-Llamas  and  gave  him 
warnings under Miranda v.  Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), in

both  English  and  Spanish.  At  no  time,  however,  did  they inform him that he could ask to have the Mexican Consulate 

notified of his detention. Shortly after the arrest and Miranda warnings,  police in-
terrogated  Sanchez-Llamas  with  the  assistance  of  an  inter-preter.  In  the  course  of  the  interrogation,  Sanchez-Llamas 
made several incriminating  statements regarding  the  shoot-out  with  police.  He  was  charged  with  attempted  aggra-
vated murder, attempted murder, and several other offenses. Before  trial,  Sanchez-Llamas  moved  to  suppress  the  state-
ments  he  made  to  police.  He  argued  that  suppression  was warranted  because  the  statements  were  made  involuntarily 
and because the authorities had failed to comply with Article 36 of the Vienna Convention.  The trial court denied the mo-
tion.  The  case  proceeded  to trial,  and  Sanchez-Llamas  was convicted and sentenced to 20

1/2  years in prison. 

He  appealed,  again  arguing  that  the  Vienna  Convention violation  required  suppression  of  his  statements.  The  Ore-

gon  Court  of  Appeals  affirmed.  Judgt.  order  reported  at 191  Ore.  App.  399,  84  P.  3d  1133  (2004).  The  Oregon  Su-
preme  Court  also  affirmed,  concluding  that  Article  36  "does not  create  rights  to  consular  access  or  notification  that  are 
enforceable by detained individuals in a judicial proceeding." 338  Ore.  267,  276,  108  P.  3d  573,  578  (2005)  (en  banc).  We

Petitioner  Mario  Bustillo,  a  Honduran  national,  was  with several  other  men  at  a  restaurant  in  Springfield,  Virginia, 

on  the  night  of  December  10,  1997.  That  evening,  outside the  restaurant,  James  Merry  was  struck  in  the  head  with  a 
baseball  bat  as  he  stood  smoking  a  cigarette.  He  died  sev-
eral  days  later.  Several  witnesses  at  the  scene  identified Bustillo as the assailant.  Police arrested Bustillo the morn-

ing  after  the  attack  and  eventually  charged  him  with  mur-

Opinion of the Court 
der.  Authorities  never  informed  him  that  he  could  request to have the Honduran Consulate notified of his detention. 

At  trial,  the  defense  pursued  a  theory  that  another  man, known as "Sirena," was responsible for the attack.  Two de-
fense  witnesses  testified  that  Bustillo  was  not  the  killer. One  of  the  witnesses  specifically  identified  the  attacker  as 
Sirena.  In addition, a third defense witness stated that she had  seen  Sirena  on  a  flight  to  Honduras  the  day  after  the 
victim  died.  In  its  closing  argument  before  the  jury,  the prosecution dismissed the defense theory about Sirena.  See 
App.  in  No.  05-51,  p.  21  ("This  whole  Sirena  thing,  I  don't want  to  dwell  on  it  too  much.  It's  very  convenient  that 
Mr.  Sirena  apparently  isn't  available").  A  jury  convicted Bustillo  of  first-degree  murder,  and  he  was  sentenced  to  30 
years in prison.  His conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal. 

After  his  conviction  became  final,  Bustillo  filed  a  petition for  a  writ  of  habeas  corpus  in  state  court.  There,  for  the 
first  time,  he  argued  that  authorities  had  violated  his  right to  consular  notification  under  Article  36  of  the  Vienna  Con-
vention.  He claimed that if he had been advised of his right to confer with the Honduran Consulate, he "would have done 
so without delay."  App. in No. 05-51, at 60.  Moreover, the Honduran  Consulate  executed  an  affidavit  stating  that  "it 
would have endeavoured to help Mr. Bustillo in his defense" had  it  learned  of  his  detention  prior  to  trial.  Id.,  at  74. 
Bustillo  insisted  that  the  consulate  could  have  helped  him locate Sirena prior to trial.  His habeas petition also argued, 
as part of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, that his attorney  should  have  advised  him  of  his  right  to  notify  the 
Honduran Consulate of his arrest and detention.2 

2 Bustillo's habeas petition also presented newly acquired evidence that 
tended  to  cast  doubt  on  his  conviction.  Most  notably,  he  produced  a  se-
cretly  recorded  videotape  in  which  Sirena  admitted  killing  Merry  and 
stated  that  Bustillo  had  been  wrongly  convicted.  App.  in  No.  05-51,  at

342  SANCHEZ-LLAMAS  v.  OREGON 

Opinion of the Court 
The  state  habeas  court  dismissed  Bustillo's  Vienna  Con-vention claim as "procedurally barred" because he had failed 

to raise the issue at trial or on appeal.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in  No.  05-51,  p.  43a.  The  court  also  denied  Bustillo's  claim 
of  ineffective  assistance  of  counsel,  ruling  that  his  belated claim  that  counsel  should  have  informed  him  of  his  Vienna 
Convention  rights  was  barred  by  the  applicable  statute  of limitations  and also  meritless  under 

Strickland  v.  Washing-ton, 466  U. S. 668  (1984).  App.  in  No.  05-51, at  132.  In  an 

order  refusing  Bustillo's  petition  for  appeal,  the  Supreme Court  of  Virginia  found  "no  reversible  error"  in  the  habeas 
court's  dismissal  of  the  Vienna  Convention  claim.  App.  to Pet. for Cert.  in No. 05-51, at 1a.  We  granted  certiorari to 
consider the Vienna Convention issue.  546 U. S. 1001 (2005). 

II 
We  granted  certiorari  as  to  three  questions  presented  in these cases: (1) whether Article 36 of the Vienna Convention 

grants rights that may be invoked by individuals in a judicial proceeding;  (2)  whether  suppression  of  evidence  is  a  proper 
remedy for a violation of Article 36; and (3) whether an Arti-cle 36 claim may be deemed forfeited under state procedural 
rules  because  a  defendant  failed  to  raise  the  claim  at  trial. As  a  predicate  to  their  claims  for  relief,  Sanchez-Llamas 
and Bustillo each argue that Article 36 grants them an indi-vidually enforceable right to request that their consular offi-
cers  be  notified  of  their  detention,  and  an  accompanying 
38,  54.  In  addition,  Bustillo  argued  that  the  prosecution  violated  Brady 
v.  Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), by failing to disclose that on the night of 
the  crime,  police  had  questioned  a  man  named  "Julio  C.  Osorto,"  who  is 
now known to be the same man as "Sirena."  The police report concerning 
the  encounter  stated  that  Sirena  appeared  to  have  ketchup  on  his  pants. 
Bustillo  contends  that  these  stains  might  in  fact  have  been  the  victim's 
blood.  The Commonwealth disputes this.  The state habeas court found 
"no  evidence  of  any  transfer  of  the  victim's  blood  to  the  assailant,"  and 
concluded  that  the  undisclosed  encounter  between  police  and  Sirena  was 
not material under Brady.  App. in No. 05-51, at 167.

right  to  be  informed  by  authorities  of  the  availability  of consular  notification.  Respondents  and  the  United  States, 

as  amicus  curiae,  strongly  dispute  this  contention.  They argue  that  "there  is  a  presumption  that a  treaty  will be  en-
forced through political and diplomatic channels, rather than through the courts."  Brief for United States 11; ibid. (quot-
ing  Head  Money  Cases,  112  U. S.  580,  598  (1884)  (a  treaty " `is primarily a compact between independent nations,' " and 
" `depends for the enforcement of its provisions on the inter-est  and  the  honor  of  the  governments  which  are  parties 
to  it' ")).  Because  we  conclude  that  Sanchez-Llamas  and Bustillo are not in any event entitled to relief on their claims, 
we  find  it  unnecessary  to  resolve  the  question  whether  the Vienna  Convention  grants  individuals  enforceable  rights. 
Therefore, for purposes of addressing petitioners' claims, we assume, without deciding, that Article 36 does grant Bustillo 
and Sanchez-Llamas such rights. 

A 
Sanchez-Llamas  argues  that  the  trial  court  was  required to  suppress  his  statements  to  police  because  authorities 

never  told  him  of  his  rights  under  Article  36.  He  refrains, however,  from  arguing  that  the  Vienna  Convention  itself 
mandates  suppression.  We  think  this  a  wise  concession. The Convention does not prescribe specific remedies for vio-
lations of Article 36.  Rather, it  expressly leaves the imple-mentation of Article 36 to domestic law: Rights under Article 
36 are to "be exercised in conformity with the laws and regu-lations of the receiving State."  Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101. 
As far  as the  text of  the  Convention is  concerned,  the  ques-tion of the availability of the exclusionary rule for Article 36 
violations is a matter of domestic law. It  would  be  startling  if  the  Convention  were  read  to  re-
quire  suppression.  The  exclusionary  rule  as  we  know  it is  an  entirely  American  legal  creation.  See

344  SANCHEZ-LLAMAS  v.  OREGON 

Opinion of the Court 
(Burger,  C.  J.,  dissenting)  (the  exclusionary  rule  "is  unique to American jurisprudence").  More than 40 years after the 

drafting  of  the  Convention,  the  automatic  exclusionary  rule applied  in  our  courts  is  still  "universally  rejected"  by  other 
countries.  Bradley, Mapp Goes Abroad, 52 Case W. Res. L. Rev.  375, 399-400  (2001); see  also 

Zicherman v.  Korean  Air 
Lines  Co.,  516  U. S.  217,  226  (1996)  (postratification  under-
standing "traditionally considered" as an aid to treaty inter-pretation).  It  is  implausible  that  other  signatories  to  the 

Convention  thought  it  to  require  a  remedy  that  nearly  all refuse to recognize as a matter of domestic law.  There is no 
reason  to  suppose  that  Sanchez-Llamas  would  be  afforded the  relief  he  seeks  here  in  any  of  the  other  169  countries 
party to the Vienna Convention.3

can Nationals (Mex. v.  U. S.), 2004 I. C. J. No. 128, p. A386, || 41 (Oct. 25, 
2003) (Harty  Declaration)  ("With the  possible exception  of  Brazil, we are 
not aware of a single country that has a law, regulation or judicial decision 
requiring  that  a  statement  taken  before  consular  notification  and  access 
automatically must be excluded from use at trial" (footnote omitted)).  Ac-
cording  to  the  Harty  Declaration,  the  American  Embassy  in  Brazil  has 
been advised that Brazil considers consular notification to be a right under 
the Brazilian Constitution.  Neither the declaration nor the parties point 
to a case in which a Brazilian court has suppressed evidence because of a 
violation of that right. 

In  a  few  cases,  as  several  amici  point  out,  the  United  Kingdom  and 
Australia appear to have applied a discretionary rule of exclusion for viola-
tions  of  domestic  statutes  implementing  the  Vienna  Convention.  See

Opinion of the Court 
For  good  reason  then,  Sanchez-Llamas  argues  only  that suppression is required because it is the appropriate remedy 

for  an  Article  36  violation  under  United  States  law,  and urges us to require suppression for Article 36 violations as a 
matter of our "authority to develop remedies for the enforce-ment  of  federal  law  in  state-court  criminal  proceedings." 
Reply Brief for Petitioner in No. 04-10566, p. 11. For their part, the State of Oregon and the United States, 
as  amicus  curiae,  contend  that  we  lack  any  such  authority over  state-court  proceedings.  They  argue  that  our  cases 
suppressing evidence obtained in violation of federal statutes are  grounded  in  our  supervisory  authority  over  the  federal 
courts--an authority that does not extend to state-court pro-ceedings.  Brief for  Respondent  in  No. 04-10566,  pp. 42-43; 
Brief for United States 32-34; see McNabb v.  United States, 318  U. S.  332,  341  (1943)  (suppressing  evidence  for  violation

Sanchez-Llamas' statements from his criminal trial. To  the  extent  Sanchez-Llamas  argues  that  we  should  in-
voke our supervisory authority, the law is clear: "It is beyond dispute  that  we  do  not  hold  a  supervisory  power  over  the 
courts  of  the  several  States."  Dickerson  v.  United  States, 530 U. S. 428, 438 (2000); see also Smith v.  Phillips, 455 U. S.

346  SANCHEZ-LLAMAS  v.  OREGON 

Opinion of the Court 
which  Sanchez-Llamas  principally  relies  are  inapplicable  in light  of  the  limited  reach  of  our  supervisory  powers. 

Mal-
lory  and  McNabb  plainly  rest  on  our  supervisory  authority. 
Mallory, supra, at  453;  McNabb,  supra,  at  340.  And  while 
Miller is not clear about its authority for requiring suppres-sion, we have understood it to have a similar basis.  See 

Ker 
v.  California, 374 U. S. 23, 31 (1963). 

We  also  agree  with  the  State  of  Oregon  and  the  United States that our authority to create a judicial remedy applica-

ble  in  state  court  must  lie,  if  anywhere,  in  the  treaty  itself. Under  the  Constitution,  the  President  has  the  power,  "by 
and  with  the  Advice  and  Consent  of  the  Senate,  to  make 
Treaties."  Art. II, $ 2, cl. 2.  The United States ratified the 
Convention with the expectation that it would be interpreted 
according  to  its  terms.  See  1  Restatement  (Third)  of  For-
eign Relations Law of the United States $ 325(1) (1986) ("An 
international agreement is to be interpreted in good faith in 
accordance  with  the  ordinary  meaning  to  be  given  to  its 
terms  in their  context  and in  the  light of its object and pur-
pose").  If we were to require suppression for Article 36 vio-
lations without  some authority in the Convention,  we would 
in effect be supplementing those terms by enlarging the obli-
gations  of  the  United  States  under  the  Convention.  This 
is  entirely  inconsistent  with  the  judicial  function.  Cf.  The 
Amiable  Isabella,  6  Wheat.  1,  71  (1821)  (Story,  J.)  ("[T]o 
alter,  amend,  or  add  to  any  treaty,  by  inserting  any  clause, 
whether small or great, important or trivial, would be on our 
part  an  usurpation  of  power,  and  not  an  exercise  of  judicial 
functions.  It  would  be  to  make,  and  not  to  construe  a 
treaty"). 

Of course, it is well established that a self-executing treaty 
binds the States pursuant to the Supremacy Clause, and that 
the  States  therefore  must  recognize  the  force  of  the  treaty 
in  the  course  of  adjudicating  the  rights  of  litigants.  See, 
e. g.,  Hauenstein  v.  Lynham,  100  U. S.  483  (1880).  And 
where  a  treaty  provides  for  a  particular  judicial  remedy, 

548US2 Unit: $U83 [08-19-09 17:29:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court 
there  is  no  issue  of  intruding  on  the  constitutional  preroga-tives  of  the  States  or  the  other  federal  branches.  Courts 

must  apply  the  remedy  as  a  requirement  of  federal  law. Cf.  18  U. S. C.  $ 2515; 

United  States  v.  Giordano,  416  U. S. 
505, 524-525 (1974).  But where a treaty does not provide a particular remedy, either expressly or implicitly, it is not for 

the  federal courts  to impose  one on  the  States  through law-
making of their own. Sanchez-Llamas  argues  that  the  language  of  the  Conven-

tion  implicitly  requires  a  judicial  remedy  because  it  states that the laws and regulations governing the exercise of Arti-
cle 36 rights "must enable full effect to be given to the  pur-
poses  for  which  the  rights  .  .  .  are  intended,"  Art.  36(2),  21 
U. S. T., at 101 (emphasis added).  In his view, although "full 
effect"  may  not  automatically  require  an  exclusionary  rule, 
it does require an appropriate judicial remedy of some kind. 
There  is  reason  to  doubt  this  interpretation.  In  particular, 
there is little indication that other parties to the Convention 
have  interpreted  Article  36  to  require  a  judicial  remedy  in 
the  context  of  criminal  prosecutions.  See  Department  of 
State  Answers  to  Questions  Posed  by  the  First  Circuit  in 
United  States  v.  Nai  Fook  Li,  No.  97-2034  etc.,  p.  A-9  (Oct. 
15,  1999)  ("We  are  unaware  of  any  country  party  to  the 
[Vienna Convention] that provides remedies for violations of 
consular  notification  through  its  domestic  criminal  justice 
system"). 

Nevertheless, even if Sanchez-Llamas is correct that Arti-
cle  36  implicitly  requires  a  judicial  remedy,  the  Convention 
equally  states  that  Article  36  rights  "shall  be  exercised  in 
conformity  with  the  laws  and  regulations  of  the  receiving 
State."  Art.  36(2),  21 U. S. T.,  at 101.  Under  our  domestic 
law,  the  exclusionary  rule  is  not  a  remedy  we  apply  lightly. 
"[O]ur  cases  have  repeatedly  emphasized  that  the  rule's

tives presents a high obstacle for those urging application of

348  SANCHEZ-LLAMAS  v.  OREGON 

Opinion of the Court 
Scott,  524  U. S.  357,  364-365  (1998).  Because  the  rule's  so-
cial  costs  are  considerable,  suppression  is  warranted  only 
where  the  rule's  " `remedial  objectives  are  thought  most  ef-
ficaciously  served.' "  United  States  v.  Leon,  468  U. S.  897, 
908 (1984) (quoting United States v.  Calandra, 414 U. S. 338, 
348 (1974)). 

We  have  applied  the  exclusionary  rule  primarily  to  deter 
constitutional  violations.  In  particular,  we  have  ruled  that 
the Constitution requires the exclusion of evidence obtained 
by  certain  violations  of  the  Fourth  Amendment,  see  Taylor 
v.  Alabama, 457  U. S. 687,  694 (1982)  (arrests  in  violation of 
the  Fourth  Amendment);  Mapp  v.  Ohio,  367  U. S.  643,  655- 
657  (1961)  (unconstitutional  searches  and  seizures),  and  con-
fessions  exacted  by  police  in  violation  of  the  right  against 
compelled  self-incrimination  or  due  process,  see  Dickerson, 
530 U. S., at 435 (failure to give Miranda warnings); Payne v. 
Arkansas, 356 U. S. 560, 568 (1958) (involuntary confessions). 

The  few  cases  in  which  we  have  suppressed  evidence  for 
statutory  violations  do  not  help  Sanchez-Llamas.  In  those 
cases,  the  excluded  evidence  arose  directly  out  of  statu-
tory  violations  that  implicated  important  Fourth  and  Fifth 
Amendment  interests.  McNabb,  for  example,  involved  the 
suppression  of  incriminating  statements  obtained  during  a 
prolonged detention of the defendants, in violation of a stat-
ute  requiring  persons  arrested  without  a  warrant  to  be 
promptly  presented  to  a  judicial  officer.  We  noted  that  the 
statutory  right  was  intended  to  "avoid  all  the  evil  implica-
tions  of  secret  interrogation  of  persons  accused  of  crime," 
318 U. S., at 344, and later stated that McNabb was "respon-
sive  to  the  same  considerations  of  Fifth  Amendment  policy 
that  .  .  .  face[d]  us  .  .  .  as  to  the  States"  in  Miranda,  384 
U. S.,  at  463.  Similarly,  in  Miller,  we  required  suppression 
of  evidence  that  was  the  product  of  a  search  incident  to  an 
unlawful arrest.  357 U. S., at 305; see California v.  Hodari 
D.,  499  U. S.  621,  624  (1991)  ("We  have  long  understood  that

Opinion of the Court 
the  Fourth  Amendment's  protection  against  `unreasonable 
. . . seizures' includes seizure of the person"). 

The  violation  of  the  right  to  consular  notification,  in  con-
trast,  is  at  best  remotely  connected  to  the  gathering  of  evi-
dence.  Article  36  has  nothing  whatsoever  to  do  with 
searches  or  interrogations.  Indeed,  Article  36  does  not 
guarantee  defendants  any  assistance  at  all.  The  provision 
secures only a right of foreign nationals to have their consul-
ate informed  of their  arrest or detention--not  to have  their 
consulate  intervene,  or  to  have  law  enforcement  authorities 
cease  their  investigation  pending  any  such  notice  or  inter-
vention.  In  most  circumstances,  there  is  likely  to  be  little 
connection  between  an  Article  36  violation  and  evidence  or 
statements obtained by police. 

Moreover,  the  reasons  we  often  require  suppression  for 
Fourth  and Fifth  Amendment  violations  are  entirely  absent 
from  the  consular  notification  context.  We  require  exclu-
sion  of  coerced  confessions  both  because  we  disapprove  of 
such coercion and because such confessions tend to be unreli-
able.  Watkins  v.  Sowders,  449  U. S.  341,  347  (1981).  We 
exclude  the  fruits  of  unreasonable  searches  on  the  theory 
that  without  a  strong  deterrent,  the  constraints  of  the 
Fourth  Amendment  might  be  too  easily  disregarded  by  law 
enforcement.  Elkins  v.  United  States,  364  U. S.  206,  217 
(1960).  The situation here is quite different.  The failure to 
inform  a  defendant  of  his  Article  36  rights  is  unlikely,  with 
any  frequency,  to  produce  unreliable  confessions.  And  un-
like  the  search-and-seizure  context--where  the  need  to  ob-
tain  valuable  evidence  may  tempt  authorities  to  transgress 
Fourth  Amendment  limitations--police  win  little,  if  any, 
practical  advantage  from  violating  Article  36.  Suppression 
would  be  a  vastly  disproportionate  remedy  for  an  Article 
36 violation. 

Sanchez-Llamas  counters  that  the  failure  to  inform  de-
fendants  of  their  right  to  consular  notification  gives  them

350  SANCHEZ-LLAMAS  v.  OREGON 

Opinion of the Court 
"a  misleadingly  incomplete  picture  of  [their]  legal  options," Brief for Petitioner in No. 04-10566, p. 42, and that suppres-

sion will give authorities an incentive to abide by Article 36. Leaving  aside  the  suggestion  that  it  is  the  role  of  police 
generally  to  advise  defendants  of  their  legal  options,  we think  other  constitutional  and  statutory  requirements  effec-
tively protect the interests served, in Sanchez-Llamas' view, by  Article  36.  A  foreign  national  detained  on  suspicion  of 
crime, like anyone else in our country, enjoys under our sys-tem  the  protections  of  the  Due  Process  Clause.  Among 
other  things,  he  is  entitled  to  an  attorney,  and  is  protected against  compelled  self-incrimination.  See 

Wong  Wing  v. United States, 163 U. S. 228, 238 (1896) ("[A]ll persons within 

the territory of the United States are entitled to the protec-tion guaranteed by" the Fifth and Sixth Amendments).  Ar-
ticle  36  adds  little  to  these  "legal  options,"  and  we  think  it unnecessary to apply the exclusionary rule where other con-
stitutional and statutory protections--many of them already enforced  by  the  exclusionary  rule--safeguard  the  same  in-
terests  Sanchez-Llamas  claims  are  advanced  by  Article  36. Finally,  suppression  is  not  the  only  means  of  vindicating 
Vienna Convention rights.  A defendant can raise an Article 36  claim  as  part  of  a  broader  challenge  to  the  voluntariness 
of his statements to police.  If he raises an Article 36 viola-tion  at  trial,  a  court  can  make  appropriate  accommodations 
to ensure that the defendant  secures, to the  extent possible, the benefits of consular assistance.  Of course, diplomatic av-
enues--the  primary  means  of  enforcing  the  Convention-- also remain open. 

In sum, neither the Vienna Convention itself nor our prece-dents applying  the exclusionary rule  support suppression  of 
Sanchez-Llamas' statements to police. 

B 
The  Virginia  courts  denied  petitioner  Bustillo's  Article  36 claim  on  the  ground  that  he  failed  to  raise  it  at  trial  or  on 

direct  appeal.  The  general  rule  in  federal  habeas  cases  is

Opinion of the Court 
that  a  defendant  who  fails  to  raise  a  claim  on  direct  appeal is  barred  from  raising  the  claim  on  collateral  review.  See 

Massaro v.  United  States, 538  U. S. 500,  504  (2003); Bousley v. 

United  States,  523  U. S.  614,  621  (1998).  There  is  an  ex-
ception  if  a  defendant  can  demonstrate  both  "cause"  for  not raising  the  claim  at  trial,  and  "prejudice"  from  not  having 

done  so.  Massaro,  supra,  at  504.  Like  many  States,  Vir-
ginia  applies  a  similar  rule  in  state  postconviction  proceed-ings,  and  did  so  here  to  bar  Bustillo's  Vienna  Convention 

claim.  Normally,  in  our  review  of  state-court  judgments, such rules constitute an adequate and independent state-law 
ground  preventing  us  from  reviewing  the  federal  claim. 
Coleman  v.  Thompson,  501  U. S.  722,  729  (1991).  Bustillo 
contends, however, that state procedural default rules cannot apply  to  Article  36  claims.  He  argues  that  the  Convention 

requires  that  Article  36  rights  be  given  " `full  effect' "  and that Virginia's procedural default rules "prevented any effect 
(much  less  `full  effect')  from  being  given  to"  those  rights. Brief  for  Petitioner  in  No.  05-51,  p.  35  (emphasis  deleted). 

This  is  not  the  first  time  we  have  been  asked  to  set  aside 
procedural default rules for a Vienna Convention claim.  Re-spondent  Johnson and  the  United  States  persuasively  argue 

that  this  question  is  controlled  by  our  decision  in  Breard  v. 
Greene,  523  U. S.  371  (1998)  (per  curiam).  In  Breard,  the 
petitioner failed to raise an Article 36 claim in state court-- 
at trial or on collateral review--and then sought to have the 
claim heard in a subsequent federal habeas proceeding.  Id., 
at 375.  He argued that "the Convention is the `supreme law 
of  the  land'  and  thus  trumps  the  procedural  default  doc-
trine."  Ibid.  We rejected this argument as "plainly incor-
rect,"  for  two  reasons.  Ibid.  First,  we  observed,  "it  has 
been recognized in international law that, absent a clear and 
express  statement  to  the  contrary,  the  procedural  rules  of 
the  forum  State  govern  the  implementation  of  the  treaty  in 
that  State."  Ibid.  Furthermore,  we  reasoned  that  while 
treaty protections such as Article 36 may constitute supreme 
federal law, this is "no less true of provisions of the Constitu-

352  SANCHEZ-LLAMAS  v.  OREGON 

Opinion of the Court 
tion  itself,  to  which  rules  of  procedural  default  apply."  Id., at 376.  In light of 

Breard's holding, Bustillo faces an uphill 
task  in  arguing  that  the  Convention  requires  States  to  set aside their procedural default rules for Article 36 claims. 

Bustillo  offers  two  reasons  why  Breard  does  not  control his  case.  He  first  argues  that 

Breard's  holding  concerning 
procedural default was "unnecessary to the result," Brief for 
Petitioner  in  No.  05-51,  at  45,  because  the  petitioner  there could  not  demonstrate  prejudice  from  the  default  and  be-

cause, in any event, a  subsequent federal statute--the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 
1214--superseded any right the petitioner had under the Vi-
enna Convention to have his claim heard on collateral review. 
We  find  Bustillo's  contention  unpersuasive.  Our  resolution 
of the procedural default question  in  Breard was the  princi-
pal  reason  for  the  denial  of  the  petitioner's  claim,  and  the 
discussion  of  the  issue  occupied  the  bulk  of  our  reasoning. 
See 523 U. S., at 375-377.  It is no answer to argue, as Bus-
tillo does, that the holding in Breard was "unnecessary" sim-
ply  because  the  petitioner  in  that  case  had  several  ways  to 
lose.  See Richmond Screw Anchor Co. v.  United States, 275 
U. S. 331, 340 (1928). 

Bustillo's  second  reason  is  less  easily  dismissed.  He  ar-
gues  that  since  Breard,  the  ICJ  has  interpreted  the  Vienna 
Convention to preclude the application of procedural default 
rules  to  Article  36  claims.  The  LaGrand  Case  (F.  R.  G.  v. 
U. S.),  2001  I.  C.  J.  466  (Judgment  of  June  27)  (LaGrand), 
and the Case Concerning Avena and other Mexican Nation-
als  (Mex.  v.  U. S.),  2004  I.  C.  J.  12  (Judgment  of  Mar.  31) 
(Avena),  were  brought  before  the  ICJ  by  the  governments 
of Germany and Mexico, respectively, on behalf of several of 
their  nationals  facing  death  sentences  in  the  United  States. 
The  foreign  governments  claimed  that  their  nationals  had 
not  been  informed  of  their  right  to  consular  notification. 
They  further  argued  that  application  of  the  procedural  de-
fault rule to their nationals' Vienna Convention claims failed

Opinion of the Court 
to  give  "full  effect"  to  the  purposes  of  the  Convention,  as 
required by Article 36.  The ICJ agreed, explaining that the 
defendants had procedurally defaulted their claims "because 
of the failure of the American authorities to comply with their 
obligation under Article  36."  LaGrand,  supra, at 497,  || 91; 
see also Avena, supra, at 57, || 113.  Application of the proce-
dural  default  rule  in  such  circumstances,  the  ICJ  reasoned, 
"prevented [courts] from attaching any legal significance" to 
the fact that the violation of Article 36 kept the foreign gov-
ernments  from  assisting  in  their  nationals'  defense.  LaGrand, supra, at 497, || 91; see also Avena, supra, at 57, || 113. 

Bustillo  argues  that  LaGrand  and  Avena  warrant  revis-
iting the procedural default holding of Breard.  In a similar 
vein,  several  amici  contend  that  "the  United  States  is  ob-
ligated  to  comply  with  the  Convention,  as  interpreted  by 

the  ICJ."  Brief  for  ICJ  Experts  11  (emphasis  added).  We 
disagree.  Although  the  ICJ's  interpretation  deserves  "re-
spectful  consideration,"  Breard,  supra,  at  375,  we  conclude 
that  it  does  not  compel  us  to  reconsider  our  understanding 
of the Convention in Breard.4 

Under our Constitution, "[t]he judicial Power of the United 
States" is "vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior 
Courts  as  the  Congress  may  from  time  to  time  ordain  and 
establish."  Art. III, $ 1.  That "judicial Power . . . extend[s] 
to  .  .  .  Treaties."  Id.,  $ 2.  And,  as  Chief  Justice  Marshall 
famously explained, that judicial power includes the duty "to 
say  what  the  law  is."  Marbury  v.  Madison,  1  Cranch  137, 
177  (1803).  If  treaties  are  to  be  given  effect  as  federal  law 

4 The  dissent,  in  light  of  LaGrand  and  Avena,  "would  read  Breard  . . .  
as  not  saying  that  the  Convention  never  trumps  any  procedural  default 
rule."  Post,  at  389  (opinion  of  Breyer,

lar disputes is thus not binding precedent even as to the ICJ 
itself;  there  is  accordingly  little  reason  to  think  that  such 
interpretations  were  intended  to  be  controlling  on  our courts.  The  ICJ's  principal  purpose is  to  arbitrate  particu-

lar  disputes  between  national  governments.  Art.  1,  id.,  at 1055  (ICJ  is  "the  principal  judicial  organ  of  the  United  Na-
tions"); see also Art. 34, id., at 1059 ("Only states [i. e., coun-
tries]  may  be  parties  in  cases  before  the  Court").  While each  member  of  the  United  Nations  has  agreed  to  comply 

with decisions of the ICJ "in any case to which it is a party," United  Nations  Charter,  Art.  94(1),  59  Stat.  1051,  T.  S. 
No. 993 (1945), the Charter's procedure for noncompliance-- 
referral  to  the  Security  Council  by  the  aggrieved  state-- 

contemplates  quintessentially  international  remedies,  Art. 
94(2), ibid. 

In  addition,  "[w]hile  courts  interpret  treaties  for  them-
selves,  the  meaning  given  them  by  the  departments  of  gov-
ernment  particularly  charged  with  their  negotiation  and 
enforcement  is  given  great  weight."  Kolovrat  v.  Oregon, 
366  U. S.  187,  194  (1961).  Although  the  United  States  has 
agreed  to "discharge  its  international  obligations" in  having 
state  courts  give  effect  to  the  decision  in  Avena,  it  has  not 
taken  the  view  that the  ICJ's  interpretation  of  Article  36  is 
binding  on  our  courts.  President  Bush,  Memorandum  for 
the  Attorney  General  (Feb.  28,  2005),  App.  to  Brief  for 
United States as Amicus Curiae in Medelli'n v.  Dretke, O. T. 
2004, No. 04-5928, p. 9a.  Moreover, shortly after Avena, the 
United States withdrew from the Optional Protocol concern-
ing  Vienna  Convention  disputes.  Whatever  the  effect  of 
Avena  and  LaGrand  before  this  withdrawal,  it  is  doubtful 
that our courts should give decisive weight to the interpreta-
tion of a tribunal whose jurisdiction in this area is no longer 
recognized by the United States. 

LaGrand and Avena are therefore entitled only to the "re-
spectful  consideration"  due  an  interpretation  of  an  interna-
tional  agreement  by  an  international  court.  Breard,  523

356  SANCHEZ-LLAMAS  v.  OREGON 

Opinion of the Court 
U. S.,  at  375.  Even  according  such  consideration,  the  ICJ's interpretation  cannot  overcome  the  plain  import  of  Article 

36.  As  we  explained  in  Breard,  the  procedural  rules  of  do-mestic law generally govern the implementation of an inter-
national  treaty.  Ibid.  In  addition,  Article  36  makes  clear that  the  rights  it  provides  "shall  be  exercised  in  conformity 
with  the  laws  and  regulations  of  the  receiving  State"  pro-
vided that "full effect . . . be given to the purposes for which the  rights  accorded  under  this  Article  are  intended."  Art. 

36(2),  21  U. S. T.,  at  101.  In  the  United  States,  this  means that  the  rule  of  procedural  default--which  applies  even  to 
claimed  violations  of  our  Constitution,  see  Engle  v.  Isaac, 
456  U. S. 107, 129  (1982)--applies  also  to Vienna  Convention 
claims.  Bustillo points to nothing in the drafting history of 
Article 36 or in the contemporary practice of other signator-
ies that undermines this conclusion. 

The ICJ concluded that where a defendant was not notified 
of  his  rights  under  Article  36,  application  of  the  procedural 
default  rule  failed  to  give  "full  effect"  to  the  purposes  of 
Article 36 because it prevented courts from attaching "legal 
significance"  to  the  Article  36  violation.  LaGrand,  2001 
I.  C.  J.,  at  497-498,  |||| 90-91.  This  reasoning  overlooks  the 
importance  of  procedural  default  rules  in  an  adversary  sys-
tem,  which  relies  chiefly  on  the  parties  to  raise  significant 
issues  and  present  them  to  the  courts  in  the  appropriate 
manner  at  the  appropriate  time  for  adjudication.  See  Cas-
tro  v.  United  States,  540  U. S.  375,  386  (2003)  (Scalia,

Opinion of the Court 
claim.  As  a  result,  rules  such  as  procedural  default  rou-tinely deny "legal significance"--in the Avena and LaGrand 

sense--to otherwise viable legal claims. Procedural default rules generally  take on greater impor-
tance  in  an  adversary  system  such  as  ours  than  in  the  sort of  magistrate-directed,  inquisitorial  legal  system  character-
istic  of  many  of  the  other  countries  that  are  signatories  to the Vienna Convention.  "What makes a system adversarial 
rather  than  inquisitorial  is  .  .  .  the  presence  of  a  judge  who does not (as an inquisitor does) conduct the factual and legal 
investigation  himself,  but  instead  decides  on  the  basis  of facts  and  arguments  pro  and  con  adduced  by  the  parties." 
McNeil  v.  Wisconsin,  501  U. S.  171,  181,  n.  2  (1991).  In  an inquisitorial  system,  the  failure  to  raise  a  legal  error  can  in 
part  be  attributed  to  the  magistrate,  and  thus  to  the  state itself.  In our system, however, the responsibility for failing 
to raise an issue generally rests with the parties themselves. The ICJ's  interpretation  of Article  36  is  inconsistent with 
the  basic  framework  of  an  adversary  system.  Under  the ICJ's  reading  of  "full  effect,"  Article  36  claims  could  trump 
not  only  procedural  default  rules,  but  any  number  of  other rules  requiring  parties  to  present  their  legal  claims  at  the 
appropriate  time  for  adjudication.  If  the  state's  failure  to inform  the  defendant  of  his  Article  36  rights  generally  ex-
cuses  the  defendant's  failure  to  comply  with  relevant  pro-cedural  rules,  then  presumably  rules  such  as  statutes  of 
limitations  and  prohibitions  against  filing  successive  habeas petitions  must  also  yield  in  the  face  of  Article  36  claims. 
This sweeps too broadly, for it reads the "full effect" proviso in a way that leaves little room for Article 36's clear instruc-
tion  that  Article  36  rights  "shall  be  exercised  in  conformity with the laws and regulations of the receiving State."  Art. 
36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101.6

default rules give way only where "the State is unwilling to provide some 
other  effective  remedy,  for  example  (if  the  lawyer  acts  incompetently

Much  as  Sanchez-Llamas  cannot  show  that  suppression is  an  appropriate  remedy  for  Article  36  violations  under 

domestic  law  principles,  so  too  Bustillo  cannot  show  that normally  applicable  procedural  default  rules  should  be 
suspended  in  light  of  the  type  of  right  he  claims.  In  this regard,  a  comparison  of  Article  36  and  a  suspect's  rights 
under  Miranda  disposes  of  Bustillo's  claim.  Bustillo  con-tends  that  applying  procedural  default  rules  to  Article  36 
rights  denies  such  rights  "full  effect"  because  the  violation itself--

i. e., the failure to inform defendants of their right to 

in  respect  to  Convention  rights  of  which  the  lawyer  was  aware)  an 
ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim."  Post, at 388 (opinion of Breyer,

Opinion of the Court 
consular  notification--prevents  them  from  becoming  aware of  their  Article  36  rights  and  asserting  them  at  trial.  Of 

course,  precisely  the  same  thing  is  true  of  rights  under  Mi-
randa.  Police  are  required  to  advise  suspects  that  they 
have a right to remain silent and a right to an attorney.  See 
Miranda,  384  U. S.,  at  479;  see  also  Dickerson,  530  U. S.,  at 
435.  If  police  do  not  give  such  warnings,  and  counsel  fails 
to object, it is equally true that a suspect may not be "aware he  even 

had  such  rights  until  well  after  his  trial  had  con-
cluded."  Brief  for  Petitioner  in  No.  05-51,  at  35.  Never-theless, it is well established that where a defendant fails to 

raise a Miranda claim at  trial, procedural default rules may 
bar  him  from  raising  the  claim  in  a  subsequent  postcon-
viction  proceeding.  Wainwright  v.  Sykes,  433  U. S.  72,  87 
(1977). 

Bustillo responds that an Article 36 claim more closely re-
sembles  a  claim,  under  Brady  v.  Maryland,  373  U. S.  83 
(1963), that the prosecution failed to disclose exculpatory evi-
dence--a  type  of  claim  that  often  can  be  asserted  for  the 
first  time  only  in  postconviction  proceedings.  See  United 
States  v.  Dominguez  Benitez,  542  U. S.  74,  83,  n.  9  (2004). 
The  analogy  is  inapt.  In  the  case  of  a  Brady  claim,  it  is 
impossible  for  the  defendant  to  know  as  a  factual  matter 
that a violation has occurred before the exculpatory evidence 
is  disclosed.  By  contrast,  a  defendant  is  well  aware  of  the 
fact  that  he  was  not  informed  of  his  Article  36  rights,  even 
if the legal significance of that fact eludes him. 

Finally, relying on Massaro v.  United States, 538 U. S. 500 
(2003),  Bustillo  argues  that  Article  36  claims  "are  most  ap-
propriately  raised  post-trial  or  on  collateral  review."  Brief 
for Petitioner in No. 05-51, at 39.  Massaro held that claims 
of ineffective assistance of counsel may be raised for the first 
time in a proceeding under 28 U. S. C. $ 2255.  That decision, 
however,  involved  the  question  of  the  proper  forum  for  fed-
eral habeas claims.  Bustillo, by contrast, asks us to require 
the  States  to  hear  Vienna  Convention  claims  raised  for  the

now presents itself. We conclude the answer in these cases is to look at propor-

aries for proportionality because that is the only area of the 
State where reasonably compact Latino opportunity districts can  be  drawn.  This  argument,  however,  misunderstands

with  a  marked  and  continuous  rise  in  Spanish-surnamed voter  registration.  See  Lichtman  Report,  App.  142-143. 

In  successive  elections  Latinos  were  voting  against  Bonilla in  greater  numbers,  and  in  2002  they  almost  ousted  him. 
Webb  County  in  particular,  with  a  94%  Latino  population, spurred  the  incumbent's  near  defeat  with  dramatically  in-
creased  turnout  in  2002.  See  2004  Almanac  1579.  In  re-sponse to the growing participation that threatened Bonilla's

fore, the  Armed Forces'  efficient  operation,  are best served  if the mili-
tary  justice  system  acts  without  regular  interference  from  civilian 
courts, see id., at 752, is inapt because Hamdan is not a service member. 
Second,  the  view  that  federal  courts  should  respect  the  balance  Con-
gress  struck  when  it  created  "an  integrated  system  of  military  courts 
and review procedures" is inapposite, since the tribunal convened to try 
Hamdan  is  not  part  of  that  integrated  system.  Rather  than  Council-
man, the most relevant precedent is Ex parte Quirin, where the Court, 
far from abstaining pending the conclusion of ongoing military proceed-
ings,  expedited  its  review  because  of  (1)  the  public  importance  of  the 
questions raised, (2) the Court's duty, in both peace and war, to preserve 
the constitutional safeguards of civil liberty, and (3) the public  interest 
in  a  decision  on  those  questions  without  delay,  317  U. S.,  at  19.  The 
Government has identified no countervailing interest that would permit 
federal courts to depart from their general duty to exercise the jurisdic-
tion Congress has conferred on them.  Pp. 584-590. 

3.  The  military  commission  at  issue  is  not  expressly  authorized  by 
any congressional Act.  Quirin held that Congress had, through Article 
of  War  15,  sanctioned  the  use  of  military  commissions  to  try  offenders 
or  offenses  against  the  law  of  war.  317  U. S.,  at  28.  UCMJ  Art.  21, 
which is substantially  identical  to the old Art. 15,  reads: "The jurisdic-
tion  [of]  courts-martial  shall  not  be  construed  as  depriving  military 
commissions . . . of  concurrent  jurisdiction  in  respect  of  offenders  or 
offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be tried by such . . . 
commissions."  10 U. S. C. $ 821.  Contrary to the Government's asser-
tion, even Quirin did not view that authorization as a sweeping mandate 
for  the  President  to  invoke  military  commissions  whenever  he  deems 
them  necessary.  Rather, Quirin recognized that Congress had simply 
preserved  what  power,  under  the  Constitution  and  the  common  law  of 
war,  the  President  already  had to  convene  military commissions--with 
the express condition that he and those under his command comply with 
the  law  of  war.  See  317  U. S.,  at  28-29.  Neither  the  AUMF  nor  the 
DTA  can  be  read  to  provide  specific,  overriding  authorization  for  the 
commission convened  to try Hamdan.  Assuming the  AUMF  activated 
the President's war powers, see Hamdi v.  Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, and 
that those powers include authority to convene military commissions in 
appropriate circumstances, see,  e. g.,  id.,  at 518,  there  is  nothing in  the 
AUMF's text or legislative history even hinting that Congress intended 
to  expand  or  alter  the  authorization  set  forth  in  UCMJ  Art.  21. 
Cf. Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wall. 85, 105.  Likewise, the DTA cannot be read 
to  authorize  this  commission.  Although  the  DTA,  unlike  either  Art. 
21  or  the  AUMF,  was  enacted  after  the  President  convened  Hamdan's

Syllabus 
commission,  it  contains  no  language  authorizing  that  tribunal  or  any 
other  at  Guantanamo  Bay.  Together,  the  UCMJ,  the  AUMF,  and  the 
DTA  at  most  acknowledge  a  general  Presidential  authority  to  convene 
military  commissions  in  circumstances  where  justified  under  the  Con-
stitution  and  laws,  including  the  law  of  war.  Absent  a  more  specific 
congressional  authorization,  this  Court's  task  is,  as  it  was  in  Quirin, 
to  decide  whether  Hamdan's  military  commission  is  so  justified. 
Pp. 590-595. 

4.  The  military  commission  at  issue  lacks  the  power  to  proceed  be-
cause its structure and procedures violate both the UCMJ and the four 
Geneva Conventions signed in 1949.  Pp. 613-635. 

(a)  The  commission's  procedures,  set  forth  in  Commission  Order 
No. 1, provide, among other things, that an accused and his civilian coun-
sel  may  be  excluded  from,  and  precluded  from  ever  learning  what  evi-
dence was presented during, any part of the proceeding the official who 
appointed  the  commission  or  the  presiding  officer  decides  to  "close." 
Grounds for closure include the protection of classified information, the 
physical  safety  of  participants  and  witnesses,  the  protection  of  intelli-
gence  and  law  enforcement  sources,  methods,  or  activities,  and  "other 
national security  interests."  Appointed military defense  counsel must 
be  privy  to  these  closed  sessions,  but  may,  at  the  presiding  officer's 
discretion, be  forbidden to reveal to  the client what  took place therein. 
Another striking feature is that the rules governing Hamdan's commis-
sion permit the admission of any evidence that, in the presiding officer's 
opinion, would have probative value to a reasonable person.  Moreover, 
the  accused  and  his  civilian  counsel  may  be  denied  access  to  classified 
and other "protected  information," so long as the presiding officer con-
cludes  that  the  evidence  is  "probative"  and  that  its  admission  without 
the accused's knowledge would not result in the denial of a full and fair 
trial.  Pp. 613-615. 

(b)  The Government objects to this Court's consideration of a pro-
cedural challenge at this stage on the grounds, inter alia, that Hamdan 
will be able to raise such a challenge following a final decision under the 
DTA,  and  that  there  is  no  basis  to  presume,  before  the  trial  has  even 
commenced, that it will not be conducted in good faith and according to 
law.  These  contentions  are  unsound.  First,  because  Hamdan  appar-
ently is not subject to the death penalty (at least as matters now stand) 
and  may  receive  a  prison  sentence  shorter  than  10  years,  he  has  no 
automatic  right  to  federal-court  review  of  the  commission's  "final  deci-
sion" under DTA $ 1005(e)(3).  Second, there is a basis to presume that 
the procedures employed during Hamdan's trial will violate the law: He 
will  be,  and  indeed  already  has  been,  excluded  from  his  own  trial.

Syllabus 
Thus, review of the procedures in advance of a "final decision" is appro-
priate.  Pp. 615-616. 

(c)  Because UCMJ Article 36 has not been complied with here, the 
rules  specified  for  Hamdan's  commission  trial  are  illegal.  The  proce-
dures  governing  such  trials  historically  have  been  the  same  as  those 
governing courts-martial.  Although this uniformity principle is not in-
flexible  and does  not  preclude all  departures  from  court-martial  proce-
dures, any such departure must be tailored to the exigency that necessi-
tates  it.  That understanding is reflected in Art. 36(b), which  provides 
that the procedural  rules  the President  promulgates  for courts-martial 
and military commissions alike must be "uniform insofar as practicable," 
10  U. S. C.  $ 836(b).  The  "practicability"  determination  the  President 
has made is insufficient to justify variances from the procedures govern-
ing  courts-martial.  The  President  here  has  determined,  pursuant  to 
the requirement of Art. 36(a), that it is impracticable to apply the rules 
and  principles  of  law  that  govern  "the  trial  of  criminal  cases  in  the 
United States district courts" to Hamdan's commission.  The President 
has not, however, made a similar official determination that it is imprac-
ticable  to  apply  the  rules  for  courts-martial.  And  even  if  subsection 
(b)'s requirements could be satisfied without an official practicability de-
termination,  that  subsection's  requirements  are  not  satisfied  here. 
Nothing  in  the  record  demonstrates  that  it  would  be  impracticable  to 
apply court-martial rules here.  There is no suggestion, e. g., of any lo-
gistical difficulty in securing properly sworn and authenticated evidence 
or in applying the usual principles of relevance and admissibility.  It is 
not evident why the danger posed by international terrorism, consider-
able though it is, should require, in the case of Hamdan's trial, any vari-
ance  from  the  court-martial  rules.  The  absence  of  any  showing  of 
impracticability  is  particularly  disturbing  when  considered  in  light  of 
the  clear  and  admitted  failure  to  apply  one  of  the  most  fundamental 
protections  afforded  not  just  by  the  Manual  for  Courts-Martial  but 
also  by  the  UCMJ  itself:  The  right  to  be  present.  See  10  U. S. C. 

$ 839(c).  Because  the  jettisoning  of  so  basic  a  right  cannot  lightly 
be excused as "practicable," the court-martial rules must apply.  Since 
it  is  undisputed  that  Commission  Order  No.  1  deviates  in  many  sig-
nificant  respects  from  those  rules,  it  necessarily  violates  Art.  36(b). 
Pp. 617-625. 

(d)  The procedures adopted to try Hamdan also violate the Geneva 
Conventions.  The  D.  C.  Circuit  dismissed  Hamdan's  challenge  in  this 
regard on the grounds, inter alia, that the Conventions are not judicially 
enforceable and that, in any event, Hamdan is not entitled to their pro-
tections.  Neither of these grounds is persuasive.  Pp. 625-631.

562  HAMDAN  v.  RUMSFELD 

Syllabus 
(i)  The appeals court relied on a statement in Johnson v.  Eisen-
trager, 339 U. S. 763, 789, n. 14, suggesting that this Court lacked power 
even to consider the merits of a Convention argument because the politi-
cal  and  military  authorities  had  sole  responsibility  for  observing  and 
enforcing  prisoners'  rights  under  the  Convention.  However,  Eisen-
trager  does  not  control  here  because,  regardless  of  the  nature  of  the 
rights  conferred  on  Hamdan,  cf.  United  States  v.  Rauscher,  119  U. S. 
407, they are indisputably part of the law of war, see Hamdi, 542 U. S., 
at  520-521,  compliance  with  which  is  the  condition  upon  which  UCMJ 
Art. 21 authority is granted.  Pp. 626-628. 

(ii)  Alternatively, the appeals court agreed with the Government 
that the Conventions do not apply because Hamdan was captured during 
the  war  with  al  Qaeda,  which  is  not  a  Convention  signatory,  and  that 
conflict is distinct from the war with signatory Afghanistan.  The Court 
need  not  decide  the  merits  of  this  argument  because  there  is  at  least 
one  provision  of  the  Geneva  Conventions  that  applies  here  even  if  the 
relevant conflict is not between signatories.  Common Article 3, which 
appears  in  all  four  Conventions,  provides  that,  in  a  "conflict  not  of  an 
international  character  occurring  in  the  territory  of  one  of  the  High 
Contracting  Parties  [i. e.,  signatories],  each  Party  to  the  conflict  shall 
be  bound  to  apply,  as  a  minimum,"  certain  provisions  protecting 
"[p]ersons  .  .  .  placed  hors  de  combat  by  .  .  .  detention,"  including 
a  prohibition  on  "the  passing  of  sentences  . . . without  previous  judg-
ment . . .  by a regularly  constituted court affording all the judicial guar-
antees . . . recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples."  The D. C. 
Circuit  ruled  Common  Article  3  inapplicable  to  Hamdan  because  the 
conflict  with  al  Qaeda  is  international  in  scope  and  thus  not  a  "conflict 
not of an international character."  That reasoning is erroneous.  That 
the quoted phrase bears its literal meaning and is used here in contradis-
tinction to a conflict between nations is demonstrated by Common Arti-
cle  2,  which  limits  its  own  application  to  any  armed  conflict  between 
signatories and provides that signatories must abide by all terms of the 
Conventions  even  if  another  party  to  the  conflict  is  a  nonsignatory,  so 
long  as  the  nonsignatory  "accepts  and  applies"  those  terms.  Common 
Article  3,  by  contrast,  affords  some  minimal  protection,  falling  short 
of full protection under the Conventions, to individuals associated with 
neither  a  signatory  nor  even  a  nonsignatory  who  are  involved  in  a 
conflict  "in  the  territory  of"  a  signatory.  The  latter  kind  of  conflict 
does  not  involve  a  clash  between  nations  (whether  signatories  or  not). 
Pp. 628-631. 

(iii)  While Common  Article 3 does  not define its "regularly con-
stituted court" phrase, other sources define the words to mean an "ordi-
nary  military  cour[t]"  that  is  "established  and  organized  in  accordance

with the laws and procedures already in force in a country."  The regu-
lar  military  courts  in  our  system  are  the  courts-martial  established  by 
congressional  statute.  At  a  minimum,  a  military  commission  can  be 
"regularly  constituted"  only  if  some  practical  need  explains  deviations 
from  court-martial  practice.  No  such  need  has  been  demonstrated 
here.  Pp. 631-633. 

(iv)  Common Article 3's requirements are general, crafted to ac-
commodate a wide variety of legal systems, but they are requirements 
nonetheless.  The  commission  convened  to  try  Hamdan  does  not  meet 
those requirements.  P. 635. 

(e)  Even  assuming  that  Hamden  is  a  dangerous  individual  who 
would cause great harm or death to innocent civilians given the opportu-
nity,  the  Executive  nevertheless  must  comply  with  the  prevailing  rule 
of  law  in  undertaking  to  try  him  and  subject  him  to  criminal  punish-
ment.  P. 635.

does not support the commission's jurisdiction, the commission lacks au-
thority to try Hamdan.  Pp. 595-613. 

2.  The phrase "all the judicial guarantees . . . recognized as indispen-
sable by civilized peoples" in Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conven-
tions  is  not  defined,  but  it  must  be  understood  to  incorporate  at  least 
the barest of the trial protections recognized by customary international 
law.  The  procedures  adopted  to  try  Hamdan  deviate  from  those  gov-
erning  courts-martial  in  ways  not  justified  by  practical  need,  and  thus 
fail to afford the requisite guarantees.  Moreover, various provisions of 
Commission  Order  No.  1  dispense with  the  principles,  which  are  indis-
putably  part  of  customary  international  law,  that  an  accused  must,  ab-
sent disruptive conduct or consent, be present for his trial and must be 
privy to the evidence against him.  Pp. 633-635.

Opinion of the Court 
Hamdan filed petitions for writs of habeas corpus and man-damus  to  challenge  the  Executive  Branch's  intended  means 

of  prosecuting  this  charge.  He  concedes  that  a  court-martial  constituted  in  accordance  with  the  Uniform Code  of 
Military  Justice  (UCMJ),  10  U. S. C.  $ 801  et  seq.  (2000  ed. and Supp. III), would have authority to try him.  His objec-
tion  is  that  the  military  commission  the  President  has  con-vened  lacks  such  authority,  for  two  principal  reasons:  First, 
neither  congressional  Act  nor  the  common  law  of  war  sup-ports  trial  by  this  commission  for  the  crime  of  conspiracy-- 
an  offense  that,  Hamdan  says,  is  not  a  violation  of  the  law of  war.  Second,  Hamdan  contends,  the  procedures  that  the 
President has adopted to try him violate the most basic ten-ets  of  military  and  international  law,  including  the  principle 
that a defendant must be permitted to see and hear the evi-dence against him. 

The District Court granted Hamdan's request for a writ of habeas  corpus.  344  F.  Supp.  2d  152  (DC 2004).  The  Court 
of  Appeals  for  the  District  of  Columbia  Circuit  reversed. 415 F. 3d 33 (2005).  Recognizing, as we did over a half cen-
tury  ago,  that  trial  by  military  commission  is  an  extraordi-nary measure raising important questions about the balance 
of  powers  in  our  constitutional  structure,  Ex  parte  Quirin, 317 U. S. 1, 19 (1942),  we granted certiorari.  546  U. S. 1002 
(2005). For  the  reasons  that follow,  we  conclude  that  the  military 
commission convened to try Hamdan lacks power to proceed because its structure and procedures violate both the UCMJ 
and  the  Geneva  Conventions.  Four  of  us  also  conclude,  see Part V, infra, that the offense with which Hamdan has been 
charged  is  not  an  "offens[e]  that  by  .  .  .  the  law  of  war  may be tried by military commissions."  10 U. S. C. $ 821.

quarters  of  the  Department  of  Defense  in  Arlington,  Vir-
ginia.  Americans will never forget the devastation wrought 
by these acts.  Nearly 3,000 civilians were killed. 

Congress  responded  by  adopting  a  Joint  Resolution  au-
thorizing  the  President  to  "use  all  necessary  and  appropri-
ate  force  against  those  nations,  organizations,  or  persons  he 
determines  planned,  authorized,  committed,  or  aided  the 
terrorist  attacks  .  .  .  in  order  to  prevent  any  future  acts  of 
international  terrorism  against  the  United  States  by  such 
nations,  organizations  or  persons."  Authorization  for  Use 
of  Military  Force  (AUMF),  115  Stat.  224,  note  following 
50  U. S. C.  $ 1541  (2000  ed.,  Supp.  III).  Acting  pursuant 
to  the  AUMF,  and  having  determined  that  the  Taliban  re-
gime  had  supported  al  Qaeda,  the  President  ordered  the 
Armed  Forces  of  the  United  States  to  invade  Afghanistan. 
In  the  ensuing  hostilities,  hundreds  of  individuals,  Hamdan 
among  them,  were  captured  and  eventually  detained  at 
Guantanamo Bay. 

On  November  13,  2001,  while  the  United  States  was  still 
engaged  in  active  combat  with  the  Taliban,  the  President 
issued  a  comprehensive  military  order  intended  to  govern 
the  "Detention,  Treatment,  and  Trial  of  Certain  NonCitizens  in  the  War  Against  Terrorism,"  66 Fed.  Reg. 57833 
(hereinafter  November  13  Order  or  Order).  Those  subject 
to  the  November  13  Order  include  any  noncitizen  for  whom 
the  President  determines  "there  is  reason  to  believe"  that 
he  or  she  (1)  "is  or  was"  a  member  of  al  Qaeda  or  (2)  has 
engaged  or  participated  in  terrorist  activities  aimed  at  or 
harmful to the United States.  Id., at 57834.  Any such indi-
vidual "shall, when tried, be tried by military commission for

subject  to  the  Order,  but  that  power  has  since  been  dele-
gated  to  John  D.  Altenburg,  Jr.,  a  retired  Army  major  gen-
eral  and  longtime  military  lawyer  who  has  been  designated 
"Appointing Authority for Military Commissions." 

On  July  3,  2003,  the  President  announced  his  determina-
tion  that  Hamdan  and  five  other  detainees  at  Guantanamo 
Bay were subject to the November 13 Order and thus triable 
by  military  commission.  In  December  2003,  military  coun-
sel was appointed to represent Hamdan.  Two months later, 
counsel filed demands for charges and for a speedy trial pur-
suant to Article 10 of the UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. $ 810.  On Feb-
ruary 23, 2004, the legal adviser to the Appointing Authority 
denied the applications, ruling that Hamdan was not entitled 
to  any  of  the  protections  of  the  UCMJ.  Not  until  July  13, 
2004, after Hamdan had commenced this action in the United 
States  District  Court  for  the  Western  District  of  Washing-
ton, did the Government finally charge him with the offense 
for  which,  a  year  earlier,  he  had  been  deemed  eligible  for 
trial by military commission. 

The  charging  document,  which  is  unsigned,  contains  13 
numbered  paragraphs.  The  first  two  paragraphs  recite  the 
asserted  bases  for  the  military  commission's  jurisdiction-- 
namely,  the  November  13  Order  and  the  President's  July  3, 
2003, declaration that Hamdan is eligible for trial by military 
commission.  The next nine paragraphs, collectively entitled 
"General Allegations," describe al Qaeda's activities from its 
inception in 1989 through 2001 and identify Usama bin Laden 
as  the  group's  leader.  Hamdan  is  not  mentioned  in  these 
paragraphs. 

Only  the  final  two  paragraphs,  entitled  "Charge:  Conspir-
acy,"  contain  allegations  against  Hamdan.  Paragraph  12 
charges that "from on or about February 1996 to on or about 
November  24,  2001,"  Hamdan  "willfully  and  knowingly

Opinion of the Court 
joined an enterprise of persons who shared a common crimi-nal purpose and conspired and agreed with [named members 

of al Qaeda] to commit the  following offenses  triable  by mil-itary  commission:  attacking  civilians;  attacking  civilian  ob-
jects; murder by an unprivileged belligerent; and terrorism." App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a.  There is no allegation that Ham-
dan  had  any  command  responsibilities,  played  a  leadership role, or participated in the planning of any activity. 

Paragraph  13  lists  four  "overt  acts"  that  Hamdan  is  al-leged  to  have  committed  sometime  between  1996  and  No-
vember  2001  in  furtherance  of  the  "enterprise  and  conspir-acy":  (1)  he  acted  as  Usama  bin  Laden's  "bodyguard  and 
personal  driver,"  "believ[ing]"  all  the  while  that  bin  Laden "and  his  associates  were  involved  in"  terrorist  acts  prior  to 
and  including  the  attacks  of  September  11,  2001;  (2)  he  ar-ranged for transportation of, and actually transported, weap-
ons  used  by  al  Qaeda  members  and  by  bin  Laden's  body-guards (Hamdan among them); (3) he "drove or accompanied 
[U]sama  bin  Laden  to  various  al  Qaida-sponsored  training camps,  press  conferences,  or  lectures,"  at  which  bin  Laden 
encouraged  attacks  against  Americans;  and  (4)  he  received weapons  training  at  al  Qaeda-sponsored  camps.  Id.,  at 
65a-67a. After this formal charge was  filed, the United States Dis-
trict  Court  for  the  Western  District  of  Washington  trans-erred  Hamdan's  habeas  and  mandamus  petitions  to  the 
United  States  District  Court  for  the  District  of  Columbia. Meanwhile,  a  Combatant  Status  Review  Tribunal  (CSRT) 
convened pursuant to a military order issued on July 7, 2004, decided  that  Hamdan's  continued  detention  at  Guantanamo 
Bay was warranted because he was an "enemy combatant." 1

ual who was part of or supporting Taliban or al Qaeda forces, or associated 
forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coali-
tion  partners."  Memorandum  from  Deputy  Secretary  of  Defense  Paul

Opinion of the Court 
Separately, proceedings before the military commission commenced. 

On November 8, 2004, however, the District Court granted Hamdan's petition for habeas corpus and stayed the commis-
sion's  proceedings.  It  concluded  that  the  President's  au-thority to establish military commissions extends only to "of-
fenders  or  offenses  triable  by  military  [commission]  under the  law of war,"  344 F. Supp. 2d, at 158;  that the  law of war 
includes  the  Geneva  Convention  (III)  Relative  to  the  Treat-ment  of  Prisoners  of  War,  Aug.  12,  1949,  [1955]  6  U.  S.  T. 
3316,  T.  I.  A.  S.  No.  3364  (Third  Geneva  Convention);  that Hamdan  is  entitled  to  the  full  protections  of  the  Third  Ge-
neva  Convention  until  adjudged,  in  compliance  with  that treaty, not  to be a prisoner  of war; and  that, whether  or not 
Hamdan is  properly classified as  a  prisoner of war, the  mili-tary commission convened to try him was established in vio-
lation of both the UCMJ and Common Article 3 of the Third Geneva  Convention  because  it  had  the  power  to  convict 
based on evidence the accused would never see or hear.  344 F. Supp. 2d, at 158-172. 

The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed.  Like the District Court, the Court of Appeals de-
clined the Government's invitation to abstain from consider-ing  Hamdan's  challenge.  Cf.  Schlesinger  v.  Councilman, 
420  U. S.  738  (1975).  On  the  merits,  the  panel  rejected  the District Court's further conclusion that Hamdan was entitled 
to  relief  under  the  Third  Geneva  Convention.  All  three judges  agreed  that  the  Geneva  Conventions  were  not  "judi-
cially enforceable," 415 F. 3d, at 38, and two thought that the Conventions  did  not  in  any  event  apply  to  Hamdan,  id.,  at 
40-42; but see id., at 44 (Williams, J., concurring).  In other portions of its opinion, the court concluded that our decision 
in  Quirin  foreclosed  any  separation-of-powers  objection  to

the  military  commission's  jurisdiction,  and  held  that  Ham-dan's trial before the contemplated commission would violate 

neither  the  UCMJ  nor  U.  S.  Armed  Forces  regulations  in-tended to implement the Geneva Conventions.  415 F. 3d, at 
38, 42-43. On  November  7,  2005,  we  granted  certiorari  to  decide 
whether  the  military  commission  convened  to  try  Hamdan has authority to do so, and whether Hamdan may rely on the 
Geneva Conventions in these proceedings. 

II 
On  February  13,  2006,  the  Government  filed  a  motion  to dismiss  the  writ  of  certiorari.  The  ground  cited  for  dis-

missal  was  the  recently  enacted  Detainee  Treatment  Act  of 2005 (DTA), Pub. L. 109-148, 119 Stat. 2739.  We postponed 
our  ruling  on  that  motion  pending  argument  on  the  merits, 546 U. S. 1166 (2006), and now deny it. 

The  DTA,  which  was  signed  into  law  on  December  30, 2005,  addresses  a  broad  swath of  subjects  related  to  detain-
ees.  It  places  restrictions  on  the  treatment  and  interroga-tion of detainees in U. S. custody, and it furnishes procedural 
protections  for  U.  S.  personnel  accused  of  engaging  in  im-proper  interrogation.  DTA  $$ 1002-1004,  119  Stat.  2739- 
2740.  It  also  sets  forth  certain  "procedures

lack  jurisdiction  to  review  the  Court  of  Appeals'  decision 
below. 

Hamdan  objects  to  this  theory  on  both  constitutional  and 
statutory grounds.  Principal among his constitutional argu-
ments  is  that  the  Government's  preferred  reading  raises 
grave  questions  about  Congress'  authority  to  impinge  upon 
this  Court's  appellate  jurisdiction,  particularly  in  habeas 
cases.  Support  for  this  argument  is  drawn  from  Ex  parte 
Yerger,  8  Wall.  85  (1869),  in  which,  having  explained  that 
"the denial to this court of appellate jurisdiction" to consider 
an original writ of habeas corpus would "greatly weaken the 
efficacy  of  the  writ,"  id.,  at  102-103,  we  held  that  Congress 
would  not  be  presumed  to  have  effected  such  denial  absent 
an  unmistakably  clear  statement  to  the  contrary.  See  id., 
at  104-105;  see  also  Felker  v.  Turpin,  518  U. S.  651  (1996); 
Durousseau v.  United States, 6 Cranch 307, 314 (1810) (opin-
ion  for  the  Court  by  Marshall,  C.  J.)  (The  "appellate  powers 
of  this  court"  are  not  created  by  statute  but  are  "given  by 
the constitution"); United States v.  Klein, 13 Wall. 128 (1872). 
Cf. Ex  parte McCardle, 7 Wall. 506, 514 (1869)  (holding that 
Congress  had  validly  foreclosed  one  avenue  of  appellate  re-
view  where  its  repeal  of  habeas  jurisdiction,  reproduced  in 
the margin,4  could not have been "a plainer instance of posi-
tive exception").  Hamdan also suggests that, if the Govern-
ment's  reading  is  correct,  Congress  has  unconstitutionally 
suspended the writ of habeas corpus. 

We find it unnecessary to reach either of these arguments. 
Ordinary principles of statutory construction suffice to rebut 

4 " `And be it further enacted, That so much of the act approved Febru-
ary 5, 1867, entitled "An act to amend an act to establish the judicial courts 
of the United States, approved September 24, 1789," as authorized an ap-
peal from the judgment of the Circuit Court to the Supreme Court of the 
United  States,  or  the  exercise  of  any  such  jurisdiction  by  said  Supreme 
Court,  on  appeals  which  have  been,  or  may  hereafter  be  taken,  be,  and 
the same is hereby repealed.' "  7 Wall., at 508.

576  HAMDAN v.  RUMSFELD 

Opinion of the Court 
the Government's theory--at least insofar as this case, which 
was pending at the time the DTA was enacted, is concerned. 

The  Government  acknowledges  that  only  paragraphs  (2) 
and  (3)  of  subsection  (e)  are  expressly  made  applicable  to 
pending  cases,  see  $ 1005(h)(2),  119  Stat.  2743-2744,  but  ar-
gues  that  the  omission  of  paragraph  (1)  from  the  scope  of 
that express statement is of no moment.  This is so, we are 
told,  because  Congress'  failure  to  expressly  reserve  federal 
courts' jurisdiction over pending cases erects a presumption 
against jurisdiction, and that presumption is rebutted by nei-
ther the text nor the legislative history of the DTA. 

The first part of this argument is not entirely without sup-
port in our precedents.  We have in the past "applied inter-
vening  statutes  conferring  or  ousting  jurisdiction,  whether 
or  not  jurisdiction  lay  when  the  underlying  conduct  oc-
curred  or  when  the  suit  was  filed."  Landgraf  v.  USI  Film 
Products,  511  U. S.  244,  274  (1994)  (citing  Bruner  v.  United 
States, 343 U. S. 112 (1952); Hallowell v.  Commons, 239 U. S. 
506  (1916));  see  Republic  of  Austria  v.  Altmann,  541  U. S. 
677,  693  (2004).  But  the  "presumption"  that  these  cases 
have applied is more accurately viewed as the nonapplication 
of  another  presumption--viz.,  the  presumption  against  ret-
roactivity--in certain limited circumstances.5  If a statutory 
provision  "would  operate  retroactively"  as  applied  to  cases 
pending  at  the  time  the  provision  was  enacted,  then  "our 
traditional  presumption  teaches  that  it  does  not  govern 
absent  clear  congressional  intent  favoring  such  a  result." 
Landgraf,  511  U. S.,  at  280.  We  have  explained,  how-
ever,  that,  unlike  other  intervening  changes  in  the  law,  a 

5 See  Hughes  Aircraft  Co.  v.  United  States  ex  rel.  Schumer,  520  U. S. 
939,  951  (1997)  ("The  fact  that  courts  often  apply  newly  enacted 
jurisdiction-allocating statutes to pending cases merely evidences certain 
limited circumstances  failing to  meet the conditions  for our generally ap-
plicable presumption against retroactivity . . . ").

Opinion of the Court 
jurisdiction-conferring  or  jurisdiction-stripping  statute  usu-ally "takes away no substantive right but simply changes the 

tribunal  that  is  to  hear  the  case."  Hallowell,  239  U. S.,  at 508.  If  that  is  truly  all  the  statute  does,  no  retroactivity 
problem  arises  because  the  change  in  the  law  does  not  "im-
pair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a par-
ty's  liability  for  past  conduct,  or  impose  new  duties  with 
respect  to  transactions  already  completed."  Landgraf,  511 
U. S.,  at  280.6  And  if  a  new  rule  has  no  retroactive  effect, 
the presumption against retroactivity will not prevent its ap-
plication  to  a  case  that  was  already  pending  when  the  new 
rule was enacted. 

That  does  not  mean,  however,  that  all  jurisdiction-
stripping  provisions--or  even  all  such  provisions  that  truly 
lack  retroactive  effect--must  apply  to  cases  pending  at  the 
time of their enactment.7  "[N]ormal rules of construction," 
including  a  contextual  reading  of  the  statutory  language, 
may dictate otherwise.  Lindh v.  Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 326 

6 Cf. ibid. ("Statutes merely addressing which court shall have jurisdic-
tion  to entertain  a  particular  cause  of action  can fairly  be  said merely  to 
regulate  the  secondary  conduct  of  litigation  and  not  the  underlying  pri-
mary conduct of the parties" (emphasis in original)).

578  HAMDAN v.  RUMSFELD 

Opinion of the Court 
(1997).8  A familiar principle of statutory construction, rele-vant both in 

Lindh and here, is that a negative inference may 
be drawn from the exclusion of language from one statutory provision  that  is  included  in  other  provisions  of  the  same 

statute.  See  id.,  at  330;  see  also,  e. g.,  Russello  v.  United 
States,  464  U. S.  16,  23  (1983)  (" `[W]here  Congress  includes 
particular  language  in  one  section  of  a  statute  but  omits  it 
in  another section  of the  same Act,  it  is  generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the dispar-

ate  inclusion  or  exclusion' ").  The  Court  in  Lindh  relied  on this  reasoning  to  conclude  that  certain  limitations  on  the 
availability of habeas relief imposed by AEDPA applied only to  cases  filed  after  that  statute's  effective  date.  Congress' 
failure  to  identify  the  temporal  reach  of  those  limitations, which governed noncapital cases, stood in contrast to its ex-
press  command  in  the  same  legislation  that  new  rules  gov-erning habeas petitions in capital cases "apply to cases pend-
ing  on  or  after  the  date  of  enactment."  $ 107(c),  110  Stat. 
1226;  see  Lindh,  521  U. S.,  at  329-330.  That  contrast,  com-
bined with the fact that the amendments at issue "affect[ed] 
substantive  entitlement  to  relief,"  id.,  at  327,  warranted 
drawing a negative inference. 

A like inference follows a fortiori from Lindh in this case. 
"If  .  .  .  Congress  was  reasonably  concerned  to  ensure  that 
[$$ 1005(e)(2)  and  (3)]  be  applied  to  pending  cases,  it  should 
have been just as concerned about [$ 1005(e)(1)], unless it had 
the different intent that the latter [section] not be applied to 
the general run of pending cases."  Id., at 329.  If anything, 
the  evidence  of  deliberate  omission  is  stronger  here  than  it 

8 The question in Lindh was whether new limitations on the availability 
of habeas relief imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty 
Act  of  1996  (AEDPA),  110  Stat.  1214,  applied  to  habeas  actions  pending 
on the  date of  AEDPA's  enactment.  We  held that they  did not.  At  the 
outset,  we  rejected  the  State's  argument  that,  in  the  absence  of  a  clear 
congressional  statement  to  the  contrary,  a  "procedural"  rule  must  apply 
to pending cases.  521 U. S., at 326.

Opinion of the Court 
was in Lindh.  In Lindh, the provisions to be contrasted had been drafted separately but were later "joined together and 

. . . considered simultaneously when the language raising the implication  was  inserted."  Id.,  at  330.  We  observed  that 
Congress'  tandem  review  and  approval  of  the  two  sets  of provisions  strengthened  the  presumption  that  the  relevant 
omission was deliberate.  Id., at 331; see also Field v.  Mans, 516  U. S. 59,  75 (1995) ("The  more  apparently  deliberate  the 
contrast, the stronger the inference, as applied, for example, to contrasting statutory  sections originally enacted simulta-
neously  in  relevant  respects").  Here,  Congress  not  only considered  the  respective  temporal  reaches  of  paragraphs 
(1), (2), and (3) of subsection (e) together at every stage, but omitted  paragraph  (1)  from  its  directive  that  paragraphs 
(2) and  (3)  apply to  pending cases only  after  having  rejected earlier  proposed  versions  of  the  statute  that  would  have  in-
cluded  what  is  now  paragraph  (1)  within  the  scope  of  that directive.  Compare  DTA  $ 1005(h)(2),  119  Stat.  2743-2744, 
with  151  Cong.  Rec.  S12655  (Nov.  10,  2005)  (S.  Amdt.  2515); see  id.,  at  S14257-S14258  (Dec.  21,  2005)  (discussing  similar

Chao, 540 U. S. 614, 621-623 (2004).10 

10 We  note  that statements  made  by Senators  preceding passage  of  the 
DTA  lend  further  support  to  what  the  text  of  the  DTA  and  its  drafting 
history  already  make  plain.  Senator  Levin,  one  of  the  sponsors  of  the 
final bill, objected to  earlier versions of the DTA's "effective date" provi-
sion  that  would  have  made  subsection  (e)(1)  applicable  to  pending  cases. 
See,  e. g.,  151  Cong.  Rec.  S12667  (Nov.  10,  2005)  (amendment  proposed 
by  Sen.  Graham  that  would  have  rendered  what  is  now  subsection  (e)(1) 
applicable  to  "any  application  or  other  action  that  is  pending  on  or  after 
the date of the enactment of this Act").  Senator Levin urged adoption of 
an  alternative  amendment  that  "would  apply  only  to  new  habeas  cases 
filed  after  the  date  of  enactment."  Id.,  at  S12802 (Nov.  15,  2005).  That 
alternative amendment became the text of subsection (h)(2).  (In light of 
the  extensive  discussion  of  the  DTA's  effect  on  pending  cases  prior  to 
passage of the DTA, see, e. g., id., at S12664 (Nov. 10, 2005); id., at S12755 
(Nov.  14,  2005);  id.,  at  S12799-S12802  (Nov.  15,  2005);  id.,  at  S14245, 
S14252-S14253,  S14257-S14258,  S14274-S14275  (Dec.  21,  2005),  it  cannot 
be  said  that  the  changes  to  subsection  (h)(2)  were  inconsequential.

Opinion of the Court 
The  Government  nonetheless  offers  two  reasons  why,  in its view, no  negative inference may be  drawn  in  favor of ju-

risdiction.  First, it asserts that Lindh is inapposite because "Section 1005(e)(1) and (h)(1) remove jurisdiction, while Sec-
tion  1005(e)(2),  (3)  and  (h)(2)  create  an  exclusive  review mechanism  and  define  the  nature  of  that  review."  Reply 
Brief  in  Support  of  Respondents'  Motion to  Dismiss  4.  Be-cause  the  provisions  being  contrasted  "address  wholly  dis-
tinct  subject  matters,"  Martin  v.  Hadix,  527  U. S.  343,  356 (1999),  the  Government  argues,  Congress'  different  treat-
ment of them is of no significance. This argument must fail because it rests on a false distinc-
tion  between  the  "jurisdictional"  nature  of  subsection  (e)(1) and  the  "procedural"  character  of  subsections  (e)(2)  and 
(e)(3).  In truth, all three provisions govern jurisdiction over detainees'  claims;  subsection  (e)(1)  addresses  jurisdiction  in 
habeas cases and other actions "relating to any aspect of the detention,"  while  subsections  (e)(2)  and  (e)(3)  vest  exclu-
sive,11  but  limited,  jurisdiction  in  the  Court  of  Appeals  for the  District  of Columbia  Circuit to  review  "final decision[s]" 
of CSRTs and military commissions. That subsection (e)(1) strips jurisdiction while subsections 
(e)(2) and (e)(3) restore it in limited form is hardly a distinc-tion  upon  which  a  negative  inference  must  founder.

Opinion of the Court 
gress had "ample reason" to provide explicitly for application of  subsections  (e)(2)  and  (e)(3)  to  pending  cases  because 

"jurisdiction-ousting"  provisions  like  subsection  (e)(1)  have been  treated  differently  under  our  retroactivity  jurispru-
dence  than  "jurisdiction-creating"  ones  like  subsections (e)(2)  and  (e)(3).  Post,  at  662  (dissenting  opinion);  see  also 
Reply  Brief  in  Support  of  Respondents'  Motion  to  Dismiss 5-6.  That  theory  is  insupportable.  Assuming, 

arguendo, that subsections  (e)(2) and (e)(3)  "confer  new  jurisdiction (in 

the D. C. Circuit) where there was none before," post, at 662 (emphasis  in  original);  but  see  Rasul  v.  Bush,  542  U. S.  466 
(2004), and that our precedents can be read to "strongly indi-cat[e]" that jurisdiction-creating statutes raise special retro-
activity  concerns  not  also  raised  by  jurisdiction-stripping statutes,  post,  at  662,

12  subsections  (e)(2)  and  (e)(3)  "confer" 

jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity  questions  under  our  precedents.  The  provi-

sions  impose  no  additional  liability  or  obligation  on  any  pri-vate  party  or  even  on  the  United  States,  unless  one  counts 
the  burden  of  litigating  an  appeal--a  burden  not  a  single one  of  our  cases  suggests  triggers  retroactivity  concerns.

12 This  assertion  is  itself  highly  questionable.  The  cases  that  Justice

Opinion of the Court 
Moreover,  it  strains  credulity  to  suggest  that  the  desire  to reinforce  the  application  of  subsections  (e)(2)  and  (e)(3)  to 

pending  cases  drove  Congress  to  exclude  subsection  (e)(1) from $ 1005(h)(2). 

The Government's second objection is  that  applying subsections  (e)(2)  and  (e)(3)  but  not  (e)(1)  to  pending  cases 
"produces  an  absurd  result"  because  it  grants  (albeit  only temporarily)  dual  jurisdiction  over  detainees'  cases  in  cir-
cumstances where the statute plainly envisions that the D. C. Circuit will have 

"exclusive" and immediate jurisdiction over such cases.  Reply Brief in Support of Respondents' Motion 

to  Dismiss  7.  But  the  premise  here  is  faulty;  subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) grant jurisdiction only over actions to "deter-
mine the validity of any final decision" of a CSRT or commis-sion.  Because Hamdan, at least, is not contesting any "final 
decision"  of  a  CSRT  or  military  commission,  his  action  does not fall within the scope of subsection (e)(2) or (e)(3).  There 
is, then, no absurdity.14 The Government's more general suggestion that Congress 
can have had no good reason for preserving habeas jurisdic-tion  over  cases  that  had  been  brought  by  detainees  prior  to 
enactment  of  the  DTA  not  only  is  belied  by  the  legislative history,  see  n.  10, 

supra,  but  is  otherwise  without  merit. There  is  nothing  absurd  about  a  scheme  under  which  pend-

ing  habeas  actions--particularly  those,  like  this  one,  that challenge  the  very  legitimacy  of  the  tribunals  whose  judg-
ments  Congress  would  like  to  have  reviewed--are  pre-served,  and  more  routine  challenges  to  final  decisions  ren-

concerns  do not arise when  a new monetary obligation is imposed  on the 
United States it is because "Congress, by virtue of authoring the legisla-
tion,  is  itself  fully  capable  of  protecting  the  Federal  Government  from 
having its rights degraded by retroactive laws"). 

14 There may be  habeas cases  that were  pending in the  lower courts  at 

the time the DTA was enacted that do qualify as challenges to "final deci-
sion[s]"  within the  meaning  of subsection  (e)(2) or  (e)(3).  We  express no 
view about whether the  DTA would require  transfer of such an action  to 
the D. C. Circuit.

tion,  we  should  apply  the  "judge-made  rule  that  civilian courts  should  await  the  final  outcome  of  on-going  military 

proceedings before entertaining an  attack on those proceed-ings."  Brief  for  Respondents  12.  Like  the  District  Court 
and the Court of Appeals before us, we reject this argument. In  Councilman,  an  army  officer  on  active  duty  was  re-
ferred to a court-martial for trial on charges that he violated the  UCMJ  by  selling,  transferring,  and  possessing  mari-
juana.  420 U. S., at 739-740.  Objecting that the alleged of-fenses were not " `service connected,' " 

id., at 740, the officer filed suit in Federal District Court to enjoin the proceedings. 

He  neither  questioned  the  lawfulness  of  courts-martial  or their  procedures  nor  disputed  that,  as  a  serviceman,  he  was 
subject  to  court-martial  jurisdiction.  His  sole  argument was  that  the  subject  matter  of  his  case  did  not  fall  within 
the  scope  of  court-martial  authority.  See  id.,  at  741,  759. The  District  Court  granted  his  request for  injunctive  relief, 
and the Court of Appeals affirmed. We granted certiorari and reversed. 

Id., at 761.  We did not reach the merits of whether the marijuana charges were 

sufficiently  "service  connected"  to  place  them  within  the subject-matter  jurisdiction  of  a  court-martial.  Instead,  we 
concluded  that,  as  a  matter  of  comity,  federal  courts  should normally  abstain  from  intervening  in  pending  court-martial 
proceedings  against  members  of  the  Armed  Forces,16  and 

16 Councilman  distinguished  service  personnel  from  civilians,  whose 
challenges to ongoing military proceedings are cognizable in federal court. 
See,  e. g.,  United  States  ex  rel.  Toth  v.  Quarles,  350  U. S.  11  (1955).  As 
we  explained  in  Councilman,  abstention  is  not  appropriate  in  cases  in 
which  individuals  raise  " `substantial  arguments  denying  the  right  of  the 
military to try them at all,' " and in which the legal challenge "turn[s] on 
the  status  of  the  persons  as  to  whom  the  military  asserted  its  power." 
420  U. S.,  at  759  (quoting  Noyd  v.  Bond,  395  U. S.  683,  696,  n.  8  (1969)). 
In other  words,  we do not apply  Councilman abstention when  there  is a 
substantial question whether a military tribunal has personal jurisdiction 
over the defendant.  Because we conclude that abstention is inappropriate

Opinion of the Court 
further  that  there  was  nothing  in  the  particular  circum-stances  of  the  officer's  case  to  displace  that  general  rule. 

See id., at 740, 758. Councilman  identifies  two  considerations  of  comity  that 
together  favor  abstention  pending  completion  of  ongoing court-martial  proceedings  against  service  personnel.  See 
New  v.  Cohen,  129  F.  3d  639,  643  (CADC  1997);  see  also  415 F.  3d,  at  36-37  (discussing 

Councilman  and  New).  First, military  discipline  and,  therefore,  the  efficient  operation  of 

the Armed Forces are best served if the military justice sys-tem  acts  without  regular  interference  from  civilian  courts. 
See  Councilman,  420  U. S.,  at  752.  Second,  federal  courts should  respect  the  balance  that  Congress  struck  between 
military  preparedness  and  fairness  to  individual  service members  when  it  created  "an  integrated  system  of  military 
courts  and  review  procedures,  a  critical  element  of  which  is the  Court  of  Military  Appeals  consisting  of  civilian  judges 
`completely  removed  from  all  military  influence  or  per-suasion . . . .' "  

Id.,  at  758  (quoting  H.  R.  Rep.  No.  491, 81st  Cong.,  1st  Sess.,  7  (1949)).  Just  as  abstention  in  the 

face of ongoing state criminal proceedings is justified by our expectation  that  state  courts  will  enforce  federal  rights,  so 
abstention  in  the  face  of  ongoing  court-martial  proceedings is justified by our expectation that the military court system 
established  by  Congress--with  its  substantial  procedural protections  and  provision  for  appellate  review  by  independ-
ent  civilian  judges--"will  vindicate  servicemen's  constitu-tional rights," 420 U. S., at 758.  See id., at 755-758.

for  a  more  basic  reason,  we  need  not  consider  whether  the  jurisdictional 
exception recognized in Councilman applies here. 

17 See also Noyd, 395 U. S., at 694-696 (noting that the Court of Military 

Appeals  consisted  of  "disinterested  civilian  judges,"  and  concluding  that 
there was no reason for the Court to address an Air Force Captain's argu-
ment that he was entitled to remain free from confinement pending appeal 
of his conviction by court-martial "when the highest military court stands 
ready  to  consider  petitioner's  arguments").  Cf.  Parisi  v.  Davidson,  405

Opinion of the Court 
The same cannot be said here; indeed, neither of the com-ity  considerations  identified  in 

Councilman  weighs  in  favor 
of  abstention  in  this  case.  First,  Hamdan  is  not  a  member of  our  Nation's  Armed  Forces,  so  concerns  about  military 

discipline do not apply.  Second, the tribunal convened to try 
Hamdan  is  not  part  of  the  integrated  system  of  military 
courts,  complete  with  independent  review  panels,  that  Con-
gress  has  established.  Unlike  the  officer  in  Councilman, 
Hamdan has no right to appeal any conviction to the civilian 
judges  of  the  Court  of  Military  Appeals  (now  called  the 
United  States  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Armed  Forces,  see 

$ 924, 108 Stat. 2831).  Instead, under Dept. of Defense Mili-
tary  Commission  Order  No.  1  (Commission  Order  No.  1), 
App.  C  to  Brief  for  Petitioner  46a,  which  was  issued  by  the 
Secretary  of  Defense  on  March  21,  2002,  and  amended  most 
recently  on  August  31,  2005,  and  which  governs  the  proce-
dures for Hamdan's commission, any conviction would be re-
viewed by a panel consisting of three military officers desig-
nated  by  the  Secretary.  Id.,  $ 6(H)(4).  Commission  Order 
No.  1  provides  that  appeal  of  a  review  panel's  decision  may 
be  had  only  to  the  Secretary  himself,  $ 6(H)(5),  and  then, 
finally, to the President, $ 6(H)(6).18 

We  have  no  doubt  that  the  various  individuals  assigned 
review  power  under  Commission  Order  No.  1  would  strive 
to act impartially and ensure that Hamdan receive all protec-
tions  to  which  he  is  entitled.  Nonetheless,  these  review 
bodies  clearly  lack  the  structural  insulation  from  military 
influence  that  characterizes  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  the 

U. S.  34,  41-43  (1972)  ("Under  accepted  principles  of  comity,  the  court 
should stay its hand only if  the relief the petitioner  seeks  . . . would also 
be available to him with reasonable promptness and certainty through the 
machinery  of  the  military  judicial  system  in  its  processing  of  the  court-
martial charge"). 

18 If  he  chooses,  the  President  may  delegate  this  ultimate  decision-

making authority to the Secretary of Defense.  See $ 6(H)(6).

Armed  Forces,  and  thus  bear  insufficient  conceptual  simi-
larity  to  state  courts  to  warrant  invocation  of  abstention 
principles.19 

In sum,  neither of the  two  comity  considerations  underly-
ing our decision to abstain in Councilman applies to the cir-
cumstances  of  this  case.  Instead,  this  Court's  decision  in 
Quirin  is  the  most  relevant  precedent.  In  Quirin,  eight 
German saboteurs were captured upon arrival by submarine 
in  New  York  and  Florida.  317  U. S.,  at  21.  The  President 
convened  a  military  commission  to  try  seven  of  the  sabo-
teurs,  who  then  filed  habeas  corpus  petitions  in  the  United 
States  District  Court  for  the  District  of  Columbia  challeng-
ing  their  trial  by  commission.  We  granted  the  saboteurs' 
petition  for  certiorari  to  the  Court  of  Appeals  before  judg-
ment.  See id., at 19.  Far from abstaining pending the con-
clusion of military proceedings, which were ongoing, we con-
vened  a  special  Term  to  hear  the  case  and  expedited  our 
review.  That course of action was warranted, we explained, 
"[i]n  view  of  the  public  importance  of  the  questions  raised 
by  [the  cases]  and  of  the  duty  which  rests  on  the  courts,  in 
time  of  war  as  well  as  in  time  of  peace,  to  preserve  un-
impaired  the  constitutional  safeguards  of  civil  liberty,  and 
because  in  our  opinion  the  public  interest  required  that  we 
consider  and  decide  those  questions  without  any  avoidable 
delay."  Ibid. 

As  the  Court  of  Appeals  here  recognized,  Quirin  "pro-
vides a compelling historical precedent for the power of civil-
ian courts to entertain  challenges that  seek to interrupt the

ates  free  from  many  of  the  procedural  rules  prescribed  by Congress  for  courts-martial--rules  intended  to  safeguard 

the  accused  and  ensure  the  reliability  of  any  conviction. While  we  certainly  do  not  foreclose  the  possibility  that  ab-
stention may be appropriate in some cases seeking review of ongoing  military  commission  proceedings  (such  as  military 
commissions  convened  on  the  battlefield),  the  foregoing  dis-cussion makes  clear that, under  our precedent,  abstention is 
not  justified  here.  We  therefore  proceed  to  consider  the merits of Hamdan's challenge. 

IV 
The  military  commission,  a  tribunal  neither  mentioned  in the Constitution nor created by statute, was born of military 

necessity.  See  W.  Winthrop,  Military  Law  and  Precedents 831 (rev. 2d ed. 1920) (hereinafter Winthrop).  Though fore-
shadowed  in  some  respects  by  earlier  tribunals  like  the Board of General Officers that General Washington convened 
to try British Major John Andre'  for spying during the Revo-lutionary War, the commission "as such" was inaugurated in 
1847.  Id.,  at 832;  G. Davis,  A  Treatise on the  Military  Law of  the  United  States  308  (rev.  3d  ed.  1915)  (hereinafter 
Davis).  As  commander  of  occupied  Mexican  territory,  and having  available  to  him  no  other  tribunal,  General  Winfield 
Scott that year ordered the establishment of both " `military commissions' " to try ordinary crimes committed in the occu-
pied territory and a "council of war" to try offenses against the law of war.  Winthrop 832 (emphasis in original). 

When  the  exigencies  of  war  next  gave  rise  to  a  need  for use  of  military  commissions,  during  the  Civil  War,  the  dual 
system favored by General Scott was not adopted.  Instead, a  single  tribunal  often  took  jurisdiction  over  ordinary 
crimes,  war  crimes,  and  breaches  of  military  orders  alike. As  further  discussed  below,  each  aspect  of  that  seemingly 
broad  jurisdiction  was  in  fact  supported  by  a  separate  mili-tary exigency.  Generally, though, the need for military com-

Opinion of the Court 
missions  during  this  period--as  during  the  Mexican  War-- was  driven  largely  by  the  then  very  limited  jurisdiction  of 

courts-martial:  "The  occasion  for  the  military  commission arises  principally  from  the  fact  that  the  jurisdiction  of  the 
court-martial  proper,  in  our  law,  is  restricted  by  statute  al-most exclusively to members of the military force and to cer-
tain  specific offences  defined in  a written  code."  Id.,  at 831 (emphasis in original). 

Exigency  alone,  of  course,  will  not  justify  the  establish-ment and use of penal tribunals not contemplated by Article 
I,  $ 8,  and  Article  III,  $ 1,  of  the  Constitution  unless  some other part of that document authorizes a response to the felt 
need.  See  Ex  parte  Milligan,  4  Wall.  2,  121  (1866)  ("Cer-tainly  no  part  of  the  judicial  power  of  the  country  was  con-
ferred  on  [military  commissions]");  Ex  parte  Vallandigham, 1 Wall. 243, 251 (1864); see also 

Quirin, 317 U. S., at 25 ("Con-gress  and  the  President,  like  the  courts,  possess  no  power 

not  derived  from  the  Constitution").  And  that  authority,  if it exists, can  derive only  from the powers  granted  jointly to 
the  President  and  Congress  in  time  of  war.  See  id.,  at 26-29; 

In re Yamashita, 327 U. S. 1, 11 (1946). The Constitution makes the President the "Commander in 

Chief "  of  the  Armed  Forces,  Art.  II,  $ 2,  cl.  1,  but  vests  in Congress  the  powers  to  "declare  War . . .  and  make  Rules 
concerning  Captures  on  Land  and  Water,"  Art.  I,  $ 8,  cl.  11, to "raise and support Armies," id., cl. 12, to "define and pun-
ish . . . Offences against the Law of Nations," id., cl. 10, and "To  make  Rules  for  the  Government  and  Regulation  of  the 
land  and  naval  Forces,"  id.,  cl.  14.  The  interplay  between these  powers  was  described  by  Chief  Justice  Chase  in  the 
seminal case of Ex parte Milligan: 

"The  power  to  make  the  necessary  laws  is  in  Congress; the  power  to  execute  in  the  President.  Both  powers 

imply  many  subordinate  and  auxiliary  powers.  Each includes  all  authorities  essential  to  its  due  exercise. 
But  neither  can  the  President,  in  war  more  than  in

peace,  intrude  upon  the  proper  authority  of  Congress, nor  Congress  upon  the  proper  author i ty  of  the 

President.  .  .  .  Congress  cannot  direct  the  conduct  of campaigns,  nor  can  the  President,  or  any  commander 
under  him,  without  the  sanction  of  Congress,  institute tribunals for the trial and punishment of offences, either 
of  soldiers  or  civilians,  unless  in  cases  of  a  controlling 
necessity, which justifies what it compels, or at least in-sures  acts  of  indemnity  from  the  justice  of  the  legisla-

ture."  4 Wall., at 139-140.21 
Whether  Chief  Justice  Chase  was  correct  in  suggesting that  the  President  may  constitutionally  convene  military 

commissions  "without  the  sanction  of  Congress"  in  cases  of "controlling  necessity"  is  a  question  this  Court  has  not  an-
swered definitively, and need not answer today.  For we held 
in  Quirin  that  Congress  had,  through  Article  of  War  15, sanctioned  the  use  of  military  commissions  in  such  circum-

stances.  317 U. S., at 28 ("By the Articles of War, and espe-cially  Article  15,  Congress  has  explicitly  provided,  so  far  as 
it  may  constitutionally  do  so,  that  military  tribunals  shall 
have jurisdiction to try offenders or offenses against the law 
of  war  in  appropriate  cases").  Article  21  of  the  UCMJ,  the 
language of which is substantially identical to the old Article 
15  and  was  preserved  by  Congress  after  World  War  II,22 
reads as follows: 

21 See also Winthrop 831 ("[I]n general, it is those provisions of the Con-
stitution which empower Congress to `declare war' and `raise armies,' and 
which,  in  authorizing  the  initiation  of  war,  authorize  the  employment  of 
all necessary and proper agencies for its due prosecution, from which this 
tribunal derives its original sanction" (emphasis in original)). 

22 Article  15  was  first  adopted  as  part  of  the  Articles  of  War  in  1916. 

See  Act  of  Aug.  29,  1916,  ch.  418,  $ 3,  Art.  15,  39  Stat.  652.  When  the 
Articles  of  War  were  codified  and  reenacted  as  the  UCMJ  in  1950,  Con-
gress  determined  to  retain  Article  15  because  it  had  been  "construed  by 
the  Supreme  Court  (Ex  Parte  Quirin,  317  U. S.  1  (1942))."  S.  Rep.

"Jurisdiction of courts-martial not exclusive. 
"The provisions of this code conferring jurisdiction upon courts-martial  shall  not  be  construed  as  depriving  mili-

tary  commissions,  provost  courts,  or  other  military  tri-bunals  of concurrent  jurisdiction in respect  of  offenders

We have no occasion to revisit Quirin's controversial char-acterization  of Article  of War  15  as congressional authoriza-

tion  for  military  commissions.  Cf.  Brief  for  Legal  Scholars and  Historians  as  Amici  Curiae  12-15.  Contrary  to  the 
Government's  assertion,  however,  even  Quirin did  not  view the  authorization  as  a  sweeping  mandate  for  the  President 
to  "invoke  military  commissions  when  he  deems  them  nec-essary."  Brief  for  Respondents  17.  Rather,  the 

Quirin Court  recognized  that  Congress  had  simply  preserved  what 

power,  under  the  Constitution  and  the  common  law  of  war, the  President  had  had  before  1916  to  convene  military  com-
missions--with the express condition that the President and those  under  his  command  comply with  the  law  of  war.  See 
317 U. S., at 28-29.23  That much is evidenced by the Court's inquiry,  following  its  conclusion  that  Congress  had  author-
ized  military  commissions,  into  whether  the  law  of  war  had indeed been complied with in that case.  See 

ibid. The Government would have us dispense with the inquiry 

that  the  Quirin  Court  undertook  and  find  in  either  the AUMF or the DTA specific, overriding authorization for the 
very  commission  that  has  been  convened  to  try  Hamdan. Neither  of  these  congressional  Acts,  however,  expands  the 

23 Whether or not the President has independent power, absent congres-
sional  authorization,  to  convene  military  commissions,  he  may  not  disre-
gard limitations that Congress has, in proper exercise of its own war pow-
ers, placed on his powers.  See Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v.  Sawyer, 
343 U. S. 579, 637 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring).  The Government does 
not argue otherwise.

Opinion of the Court 
President's authority to convene military commissions. 
First, while we assume that the  AUMF activated the  Presi-
dent's  war  powers,  see  Hamdi  v.  Rumsfeld,  542  U. S.  507 
(2004)  (plurality  opinion),  and  that  those  powers  include  the 
authority to convene military commissions in appropriate cir-
cumstances,  see  id.,  at  518;  Quirin,  317  U. S.,  at  28-29;  see 
also Yamashita, 327 U. S., at 11, there is nothing in the text 
or  legislative  history  of  the  AUMF  even  hinting  that  Con-
gress intended to expand or alter the authorization set forth 
in Article 21 of the UCMJ.  Cf. Yerger, 8 Wall., at 105 ("Re-
peals by implication are not favored").24 

Likewise,  the  DTA  cannot  be  read  to  authorize  this  com-
mission.  Although the  DTA, unlike either Article 21 or the 
AUMF, was enacted after the President had convened Ham-
dan's  commission,  it  contains  no  language  authorizing  that 
tribunal  or  any  other  at  Guantanamo  Bay.  The  DTA  obvi-
ously  "recognize[s]"  the  existence  of  the  Guantanamo  Bay 
commissions in the weakest sense, Brief for Respondents 15, 
because  it  references  some  of  the  military  orders  governing 
them  and  creates  limited  judicial  review  of  their  "final  deci-
sion[s],"  DTA  $ 1005(e)(3),  119  Stat.  2743.  But  the  statute 
also pointedly reserves judgment on whether "the Constitu-
tion and laws of the United States are applicable" in review-
ing  such  decisions  and  whether,  if  they  are,  the  "standards 
and  procedures"  used  to  try  Hamdan  and  other  detainees 
actually violate the "Constitution and laws."  Ibid. 

Together,  the  UCMJ,  the  AUMF,  and  the  DTA  at  most 
acknowledge a general Presidential authority to convene mil-

24 On this point, it is noteworthy that the Court in Ex parte Quirin, 317 
U. S. 1 (1942), looked beyond Congress' declaration of war and accompany-
ing authorization for use of force during World War II, and relied instead 
on Article of War 15 to find that Congress had authorized the use of mili-
tary  commissions  in  some  circumstances.  See  id.,  at  26-29.  Justice

thority of Article 21 of the UCMJ may lawfully try a person and subject him to punishment. 

VI 
Whether or not the Government has charged Hamdan with an offense against the law of war cognizable by military com-

mission,  the  commission  lacks  power  to  proceed.  The UCMJ conditions the President's use of military commissions 
on  compliance  not  only  with  the  American  common  law  of war,  but  also  with  the  rest  of  the  UCMJ  itself,  insofar  as 
applicable,  and  with  the  "rules  and  precepts  of  the  law  of nations," 

Quirin,  317  U. S.,  at  28--including,  inter  alia,  the four  Geneva  Conventions  signed  in  1949.  See  Yamashita, 

327 U. S., at 20-21, 23-24.  The procedures that the Govern-ment has decreed will govern Hamdan's trial by commission 
violate these laws.  A 

The  commission's  procedures  are  set  forth  in  Commission Order  No.  1,  which  was  amended  most  recently  on  August 
31,  2005--after  Hamdan's  trial  had  already  begun.  Every commission established pursuant to Commission Order No. 1 
must  have  a  presiding  officer  and  at  least  three  other  mem-bers,  all  of  whom  must  be  commissioned  officers.  $ 4(A)(1). 
The presiding officer's job  is  to rule  on questions  of law and other  evidentiary  and  interlocutory  issues;  the  other  mem-
bers  make  findings  and,  if  applicable,  sentencing  decisions. $ 4(A)(5).  The  accused  is  entitled  to  appointed  military 
counsel  and  may  hire  civilian  counsel  at  his  own  expense  so long as such counsel is a U. S. citizen with security clearance 
"at the level SECRET or higher."  $$ 4(C)(2)-(3). The  accused  also  is  entitled  to  a  copy  of  the  charge(s) 
against him, both in English and his own language (if differ-ent),  to  a  presumption  of  innocence,  and  to  certain  other 
rights  typically  afforded  criminal  defendants  in  civilian courts  and  courts-martial.  See  $$ 5(A)-(P).  These  rights

Opinion of the Court 
are  subject,  however,  to  one  glaring  condition:  The  accused and his civilian counsel may be excluded from, and precluded 

from ever learning what evidence was presented during, any part of the proceeding  that either  the Appointing Authority 
or the presiding officer decides to "close."  Grounds for such closure  "include  the  protection  of  information  classified  or 
classifiable . . . ; information  protected  by  law  or  rule  from unauthorized  disclosure;  the  physical  safety  of  participants 
in Commission proceedings, including prospective witnesses; intelligence and law enforcement sources, methods, or activi-
ties;  and  other  national  security  interests."  $ 6(B)(3).42 Appointed  military  defense  counsel  must  be  privy  to  these 
closed sessions, but may, at the presiding officer's discretion, be  forbidden  to  reveal  to  his  or  her  client  what  took  place 
therein.  Ibid. Another striking feature of the rules governing Hamdan's 
commission  is  that  they  permit  the  admission  of  any  evi-dence  that,  in  the  opinion  of  the  presiding  officer,  "would 
have  probative  value  to  a  reasonable  person."  $ 6(D)(1). Under this test, not only is testimonial hearsay and evidence 
obtained  through  coercion  fully  admissible,  but  neither  live testimony nor witnesses' written statements need be sworn. 
See $$ 6(D)(2)(b), (3).  Moreover, the accused and his civilian counsel may be denied access to evidence in the form of "pro-
tected  information"  (which includes classified information as well as "information protected by law or rule from unauthor-
ized  disclosure"  and  "information  concerning  other  national security  interests,"  $$ 6(B)(3),  6(D)(5)(a)(v)),  so  long  as  the 
presiding  officer  concludes  that  the  evidence  is  "probative" under  $ 6(D)(1)  and  that  its  admission  without  the  accused's 
knowledge  would  not  "result  in  the  denial  of  a  full  and  fair trial."  $ 6(D)(5)(b).

43  Finally,  a  presiding  officer's  determi-

42 The accused also may be excluded from the proceedings if he "engages 
in disruptive conduct."  $ 5(K). 

43 As the District Court observed, this section apparently permits recep-

tion  of  testimony  from  a  confidential  informant  in  circumstances  where

Opinion of the Court 
nation  that  evidence  "would  [not]  have  probative  value  to  a 
reasonable  person"  may  be  overridden  by  a  majority  of  the 
other commission members.  $ 6(D)(1). 

Once  all  the  evidence  is  in,  the  commission  members  (not 
including  the  presiding  officer)  must  vote  on  the  accused's 
guilt.  A  two-thirds  vote  will  suffice  for  both  a  verdict  of 
guilty and for imposition of any sentence not including death 
(the imposition of which requires a unanimous vote).  $ 6(F). 
Any  appeal  is  taken  to  a  three-member  review  panel  com-
posed of military officers and designated by the Secretary of 
Defense, only one member of which need have experience as 
a  judge.  $ 6(H)(4).  The  review  panel  is  directed  to  "dis-
regard any variance from procedures  specified in this  Order 
or elsewhere that would not materially have affected the out-
come  of  the  trial  before  the  Commission."  Ibid.  Once  the 
panel makes its recommendation to the Secretary of Defense, 
the  Secretary  can  either  remand  for  further  proceedings  or 
forward  the  record  to  the  President  with  his  recommen-
dation  as  to  final  disposition.  $ 6(H)(5).  The  President 
then,  unless  he  has  delegated  the  task  to  the  Secretary, 
makes  the  "final  decision."  $ 6(H)(6).  He  may  change  the 
commission's findings or sentence only in a manner favorable 
to the accused.  Ibid.

Hamdan  raises  both  general  and  particular  objections  to 
the  procedures  set  forth  in  Commission  Order  No.  1.  His 
general  objection  is  that  the  procedures'  admitted  deviation 
from  those  governing  courts-martial  itself  renders  the  com-
mission  illegal.  Chief  among  his  particular  objections  are 
that  he  may,  under  the  Commission  Order,  be  convicted 

"Hamdan  will  not  be  permitted  to  hear  the  testimony,  see  the  witness's 
face, or learn his name.  If the government has information developed by 
interrogation  of  witnesses  in  Afghanistan  or  elsewhere,  it  can  offer  such 
evidence  in  transcript  form,  or  even  as  summaries  of  transcripts."  344

616  HAMDAN v.  RUMSFELD 

Opinion of the Court 
based  on  evidence  he  has  not  seen  or  heard,  and  that  any evidence admitted against him need not comply with the ad-

missibility or relevance rules typically applicable in criminal trials and court-martial proceedings. 

The Government objects to our consideration of any proce-dural challenge at this stage on the grounds that (1) the  ab-
stention  doctrine  espoused  in  Councilman,  420  U. S.  738, precludes preenforcement review of procedural  ru les, 
(2) Hamdan will be able to raise any such challenge following a  "final  decision"  under  the  DTA,  and  (3)  "there  is  .  .  .  no 
basis to presume, before the trial has even commenced, that the trial will not be conducted in good faith and according to 
law."  Brief for Respondents 45-46, nn. 20-21.  The first of these  contentions  was  disposed  of  in  Part  III, 

supra,  and neither of the latter two is sound. 

First,  because  Hamdan  apparently  is  not  subject  to  the death  penalty  (at  least  as  matters  now  stand)  and  may 
receive  a  sentence  shorter  than  10  years'  imprisonment,  he has  no  automatic  right  to  review  of  the  commission's  "final 
decision" 44  before  a  federal  court  under  the  DTA.  See $ 1005(e)(3), 119 Stat. 2743.  Second, contrary to the Govern-
ment's assertion, there is a  "basis to presume" that the pro-cedures employed during Hamdan's trial will violate the law: 
The procedures are described with particularity in Commis-sion  Order  No.  1,  and  implementation  of  some  of  them  has 
already  occurred.  One  of  Hamdan's  complaints  is  that  he will be, and 

indeed already has been, excluded from his own trial.  See  Reply  Brief  for  Petitioner  12;  App.  to  Pet.  for 

Cert. 45a.  Under these circumstances, review of the proce-dures in advance of a "final decision"--the timing of which is 
left  entirely  to  the  discretion  of  the  President  under  the DTA--is appropriate.  We turn, then, to consider the merits 
of Hamdan's procedural challenge. 

44 Any decision of the commission is not  "final" until the President ren-
ders it so.  See Commission Order No. 1, $ 6(H)(6).

Opinion of the Court 

C 
In  part  because  the  difference  between  military  commis-
sions and courts-martial originally was a difference of juris-diction alone, and in part to protect against abuse and ensure 

evenhandedness  under  the  pressures  of war,  the  procedures governing  trials  by  military  commission  historically  have 
been the same as those governing courts-martial.  See, e. g., 1  The  War  of  the  Rebellion  248  (2d  series  1894)  (General 
Order  1  issued  during  the  Civil  War  required  military  com-missions  to  "be  constituted  in  a  similar  manner  and  their 
proceedings  be  conducted  according  to  the  same  general rules  as  courts-martial  in  order  to  prevent  abuses  which 
might  otherwise  arise").  Accounts  of  commentators  from 
Winthrop through General Crowder--who drafted Article of War  15  and  whose  views  have  been  deemed  "authoritative" 

by this Court, Madsen, 343 U. S., at 353--confirm as much.45 As  recently  as  the  Korean  and  Vietnam  wars,  during  which 
use  of  military  commissions  was  contemplated  but  never made,  the  principle  of  procedural  parity  was  espoused  as  a 
background assumption.  See Paust, Antiterrorism Military Commissions:  Courting  Illegality,  23  Mich.  J.  Int'l  L.  1,  3-5 
(2001-2002). 

There is a glaring historical exception to this general rule. 
The  procedures  and  evidentiary  rules  used  to  try  General 
Yamashita  near  the  end  of  World  War  II  deviated  in  signi-
ficant  respects  from  those  then  governing  courts-martial. 

45 See  Winthrop  835,  and  n.  81  ("military  commissions  are  constituted 
and  composed,  and  their  proceedings  are  conducted,  similarly  to  general 
courts-martial"); id., at 841-842; S. Rep. No. 130, 64th Cong., 1st Sess., 40 
(1916) (testimony of Gen. Crowder) ("Both classes of courts have the same 
procedure"); see also, e. g., H. Coppe'e, Field Manual of Courts-Martial 105 
(1863)  ("[Military]  commissions  are  appointed  by  the  same  authorities  as 
those which may order courts-martial.  They are constituted in a manner 
similar to such courts, and their proceedings are conducted in exactly the 
same way, as to form, examination of witnesses, etc.").

618  HAMDAN v.  RUMSFELD 

Opinion of the Court 
See  327  U. S.  1.  The  force  of  that  precedent,  however, has  been  seriously  undermined  by  post-World  War  II 

developments. Yamashita, from late 1944 until September 1945, was Com-
manding  General  of  the  Fourteenth  Army  Group  of  the  Im-perial Japanese  Army,  which had exercised  control over  the 
Philippine  Islands.  On  September  3,  1945,  after  American forces regained control of the Philippines, Yamashita surren-
dered.  Three  weeks  later,  he  was  charged  with  violations of the law of war.  A few weeks after that, he was arraigned 
before  a  military  commission  convened  in  the  Philippines. He  pleaded  not  guilty,  and  his  trial  lasted  for  two  months. 
On  December  7,  1945,  Yamashita  was  convicted  and  sen-tenced  to  hang.  See 

id.,  at  5;  id.,  at  31-34  (Murphy,  J.,  dis-senting).  This  Court  upheld  the  denial  of  his  petition  for  a 

writ of habeas corpus. The procedures and rules of evidence employed during Ya-
mashita's  trial  departed  so  far  from  those  used  in  courts-martial that they generated an unusually long and vociferous 
critique from two Members of this Court.  See id., at 41-81 (Rutledge,  J.,  joined  by  Murphy,  J.,  dissenting).

46  Among 

the  dissenters'  primary  concerns  was  that  the  commission had free rein to  consider all evidence  "which  in  the  commis-

sion's  opinion  `would  be  of  assistance  in  proving  or  disprov-ing  the charge,' without  any of the  usual modes  of authenti-
cation."  Id., at 49 (opinion of Rutledge, J.). 

46 The dissenters' views are summarized in the following passage: 
"It is outside our basic scheme to condemn men without giving reason-
able opportunity for preparing defense; in capital or other serious crimes 
to convict on `official documents . . . ;  affidavits; . . .  documents or transla-
tions  thereof;  diaries  .  .  .  ,  photographs,  motion  picture  films,  and  .  .  . 
newspapers'  or  on  hearsay,  once,  twice  or  thrice  removed,  more  particu-
larly  when  the  documentary  evidence  or  some  of  it  is  prepared  ex  parte 
by the prosecuting authority and includes not only opinion but conclusions 
of  guilt.  Nor  in  such  cases  do  we  deny  the  rights  of  confrontation  of 
witnesses  and  cross-examination."  Yamashita,  327  U. S.,  at  44  (foot-
notes omitted).

Opinion of the Court 
The  majority,  however,  did  not  pass  on  the  merits  of  Ya-mashita's procedural challenges because it concluded that his 

status  disentitled  him  to  any  protection  under  the  Articles of War (specifically, those set forth in Article 38, which would 
become  Article  36  of  the  UCMJ)  or  the  Geneva  Convention of 1929, 47 Stat. 2021 (1929 Geneva Convention).  The Court 
explained  that  Yamashita  was  neither  a  "person  made  sub-ject  to  the  Articles  of  War  by  Article  2"  thereof,  327  U. S., 
at 20, nor a protected prisoner of war being tried for crimes committed during his detention, 

id., at 21. At  least  partially  in  response  to  subsequent  criticism  of 

General Yamashita's trial, the UCMJ's codification of the Ar-ticles  of  War  after  World  War  II  expanded  the  category  of 
persons subject thereto to include defendants in Yamashita's (and Hamdan's) position,

47  and the Third Geneva Convention 

of  1949  extended  prisoner-of-war  protections  to  individuals tried for crimes committed before their capture.  See 3 Int'l 

Comm.  of  Red  Cross,48  Commentary:  Geneva  Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War 413 (J. Pictet 
gen.  ed.  1960)  (hereinafter  GCIII  Commentary)  (explaining 

47 Article 2 of the UCMJ now reads: 
"(a)  The following persons are subject to [the UCMJ]: .  .  .  .  . 

"(9)  Prisoners of war in custody of the armed forces. .  .  .  .  .

taining  Power  for  acts  committed  prior  to  capture,"  was adopted  in  response  to  judicial  interpretations  of  the  1929 
Geneva  Convention,  including  this  Court's  decision  in  Ya-
mashita).  The most notorious  exception to the principle of 
uniformity, then, has been stripped of its precedential value. 

The  uniformity  principle  is  not  an  inflexible  one;  it  does not preclude all departures from the procedures dictated for 

use  by  courts-martial.  But  any  departure  must  be  tailored to  the  exigency  that  necessitates  it.  See  Winthrop  835, 
n.  81.  That  understanding  is  reflected  in  Article  36  of  the UCMJ, which provides: 

"(a)  The procedure, including modes of proof, in cases before  courts-martial,  courts  of  inquiry,  military  com-
missions, and other military tribunals may be prescribed by the President by regulations which shall, so far as he 
considers practicable, apply the principles of law and the rules  of  evidence  generally  recognized  in  the  trial  of 
criminal  cases  in  the  United  States  district  courts,  but 
which  may  not  be  contrary  to  or  inconsistent  with  this 
chapter. 

"(b)  All rules and regulations made under this article 
shall  be  uniform  insofar  as  practicable  and  shall  be  re-
ported to Congress."  70A Stat. 50. 

Article 36 places two restrictions on the President's power 
to promulgate rules of procedure for courts-martial and mili-
tary commissions alike.  First, no procedural rule he adopts 
may be "contrary to or inconsistent with" the  UCMJ--how-
ever practical it may seem.  Second, the rules adopted must 
be  "uniform  insofar  as  practicable."  That  is,  the  rules  ap-
plied  to  military  commissions  must  be  the  same  as  those 
applied  to  courts-martial  unless  such  uniformity  proves 
impracticable.

Opinion of the Court 
Hamdan argues that Commission Order No. 1 violates both of  these  restrictions;  he  maintains  that  the  procedures  de-

scribed  in  the  Commission  Order  are  inconsistent  with  the UCMJ  and  that  the  Government  has  offered  no  explanation 
for  their  deviation  from  the  procedures  governing  courts-martial,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  Manual  for  CourtsMartial,  United  States  (2005  ed.)  (Manual  for  Courts-Martial).  Among  the  inconsistencies  Hamdan  identifies  is 
that  between  $ 6  of  the  Commission  Order,  which  permits exclusion  of  the  accused  from  proceedings  and  denial  of  his 
access to evidence in certain circumstances, and the UCMJ's requirement that "[a]ll . . . proceedings" other than votes and 
deliberations  by  courts-martial  "shall  be  made  a  part  of  the record  and  shall  be  in  the  presence  of  the  accused."  10 
U. S. C.  $ 839(c)  (2000  ed.,  Supp.  V).  Hamdan  also  observes that  the  Commission  Order  dispenses  with  virtually  all  evi-
dentiary rules applicable in courts-martial. The  Government  has  three  responses.  First,  it  argues, 
only  9  of  the  UCMJ's  158  Articles--the  ones  that  expressly mention  "military  commissions" 

49--actually  apply  to  com-

missions,  and  Commission  Order  No.  1  sets  forth  no  pro-

49 Aside  from  Articles  21  and  36,  discussed  at  length  in  the  text,  the 
other  seven  Articles  that  expressly  reference  military  commissions  are: 
(1) 28 (requiring appointment of reporters and interpreters); (2) 47 (mak-
ing  it a  crime to  refuse to  appear or  testify "before a  court-martial, mili-
tary  commission, court  of inquiry, or any other  military court or  board"); 
(3)  48  (allowing  a  "court-martial,  provost  court,  or  military  commission" 
to punish a person for contempt); (4) 49(d) (permitting admission into evi-
dence of a "duly authenticated deposition taken upon reasonable notice to 
the  other  parties"  only  if  "admissible  under  the  rules  of  evidence"  and 
only if the witness is otherwise unavailable); (5) 50 (permitting admission 
into evidence of records of courts of inquiry "if otherwise admissible under 
the rules of evidence," and if certain other requirements are met); (6) 104 
(providing that a person accused of aiding the enemy may be sentenced to 
death or  other punishment  by military  commission or court-martial); and 
(7)  106  (mandating  the  death  penalty  for  spies  convicted  before  military 
commission or court-martial).

Opinion of the Court 
cedure  that  is  "contrary  to  or  inconsistent  with"  those  9 provisions.  Second,  the  Government  contends,  military 

commissions  would  be  of  no  use  if  the  President  were  ham-strung by those provisions of the UCMJ that govern courts-
martial.  Finally,  the  President's  determination  that  "the danger  to  the  safety  of  the  United  States  and  the  nature  of 
international  terrorism"  renders  it  impracticable  "to  apply in  military  commissions  .  .  .  the  principles  of  law  and  the 
rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases  in  the  United  States  district  courts,"  November  13 
Order  $ 1(f),  is,  in  the  Government's  view,  explanation enough  for  any  deviation  from  court-martial  procedures. 
See Brief for Respondents 43-47, and n. 22. Hamdan has the better of this argument.  Without reach-
ing the question whether any provision of Commission Order No. 1 is strictly "contrary to or inconsistent with" other pro-
visions  of  the  UCMJ,  we  conclude  that  the  "practicability" determination  the  President  has  made  is  insufficient  to  jus-
tify variances from the procedures governing courts-martial. Subsection  (b)  of  Article  36  was  added  after  World  War  II, 
and requires a different showing of impracticability from the one required by subsection (a).  Subsection (a) requires that 
the  rules the  President promulgates for  courts-martial,  pro-vost courts, and military commissions alike conform to those 
that  govern  procedures  in  Article  III  courts,  "so  far  as he  considers  practicable."  10  U. S. C.  $ 836(a)  (emphasis 
added).  Subsection (b), by contrast, demands that the rules applied  in  courts-martial,  provost  courts,  and  military  com-
missions--whether  or  not  they  conform  with  the  Federal Rules  of  Evidence--be  "uniform  insofar  as  practicable." 

$ 836(b) (emphasis added).  Under the latter provision, then, the  rules  set  forth  in  the  Manual  for  Courts-Martial  must 
apply to military commissions unless impracticable.50

Opinion of the Court 
The  President  here  has  determined,  pursuant  to  subsec-tion (a), that it is impracticable to apply the rules and princi-

ples  of  law  that  govern  "the  trial  of  criminal  cases  in  the United States district courts," $ 836(a), to Hamdan's commis-
sion.  We  assume  that  complete  deference  is  owed  that  de-termination.  The President has not,  however, made a simi-
lar official determination that it is impracticable to apply the rules  for  courts-martial.

51  And  even  if  subsection  (b)'s  re-

quirements may be satisfied without such an official determi-nation,  the  requirements  of  that  subsection  are  not  satisfied 

here. Nothing in the record before us demonstrates that it would 
be  impracticable  to  apply  court-martial  rules  in  this  case. There  is  no  suggestion,  for  example,  of  any  logistical  diffi-
culty in securing properly sworn and authenticated evidence or in applying the usual principles of relevance and admissi-
bility.  Assuming,  arguendo,  that  the  reasons  articulated  in the  President's  Article  36(a)  determination  ought  to  be  con-
sidered  in  evaluating  the  impracticability  of  applying  court-martial  rules,  the  only  reason  offered  in  support  of  that  de-
termination is the danger posed by international terrorism.52 
concerned with ensuring uniformity across service branches, that does not 
mean  it  did  not  also  intend  to  codify  the  longstanding  practice  of  proce-
dural parity between courts-martial and other military tribunals.  Indeed, 
the  suggestion  that  Congress  did  not  intend  uniformity  across  tribunal 
types is  belied by the textual  proximity of  subsection (a)  (which requires 
that  the  rules  governing  criminal  trials  in  federal  district  courts  apply, 
absent the President's determination of impracticability, to courts-martial, 
provost courts, and military commissions alike) and subsection (b) (which 
imposes the uniformity requirement). 

51 We  may  assume  that  such  a  determination  would  be  entitled  to  a 

measure of deference.  For the reasons given by Justice

624  HAMDAN v.  RUMSFELD 

Opinion of the Court 
Without  for  one  moment  underestimating  that  danger,  it  is 
not  evident  to  us  why  it  should  require,  in  the  case  of 
Hamdan's  trial,  any  variance  from  the  rules  that  govern 
courts-martial. 

The absence of any showing of impracticability is particu-
larly  disturbing  when  considered  in  light  of  the  clear  and 
admitted  failure  to  apply  one  of  the  most  fundamental  pro-
tections  afforded  not  just  by  the  Manual  for  Courts-Martial 
but  also  by  the  UCMJ  itself:  the  right  to  be  present.  See 
10 U. S. C. $ 839(c) (2000 ed., Supp. V).  Whether or not that 
departure  technically  is  "contrary  to  or  inconsistent  with" 
the  terms  of  the  UCMJ,  10  U. S. C.  $ 836(a),  the  jettisoning 
of so basic a right cannot lightly be excused as "practicable." 

Under  the  circumstances,  then,  the  rules  applicable  in 
courts-martial must apply.  Since it is undisputed that Com-
mission  Order  No.  1  deviates  in  many  significant  respects 
from those rules, it necessarily violates Article 36(b). 

The  Government's  objection  that  requiring  compliance 
with  the  court-martial  rules  imposes  an  undue  burden  both 
ignores  the  plain  meaning  of  Article  36(b)  and  misunder-
stands  the purpose  and  the  history  of  military  commissions. 
The military commission was not born of a desire to dispense 
a  more  summary  form  of  justice  than  is  afforded  by  courts-
martial; it developed, rather, as a tribunal of necessity to be 
employed when courts-martial lacked jurisdiction over either 
the accused or the subject matter.  See Winthrop 831.  Exi-
gency lent the commission its legitimacy, but did not further 
justify  the  wholesale  jettisoning  of  procedural  protections. 

legality  of  executive  action,  deferred  to  comments  made  by  such  officials 
to  the  media.  Moreover,  the  only  additional  reason  the  comments  pro-
vide--aside  from  the  general  danger  posed  by  international  terrorism-- 
for departures from court-martial procedures is the need to protect classi-
fied  information.  As  we  explain  in  the  text,  and  as  Justice

Opinion of the Court 
That  history  explains  why  the  military  commission's  proce-dures  typically  have  been  the  ones  used  by  courts-martial. 

That  the  jurisdiction  of  the  two  tribunals  today  may  some-times overlap, see 

Madsen, 343 U. S., at 354, does not detract 
from the force of this history; 53  Article 21 did not transform the military commission from a tribunal of true exigency into 

a more convenient adjudicatory tool.  Article 36, confirming 
as  much,  strikes  a  careful  balance  between  uniform  proce-dure  and  the  need  to  accommodate  exigencies  that  may 

sometimes  arise  in  a  theater  of  war.  That  Article  not  hav-ing been complied with here, the rules specified for Hamdan's 
trial are illegal.54 

D 

The  procedures  adopted  to  try  Hamdan  also  violate  the 
Geneva  Conventions.  The  Court  of  Appeals  dismissed 
Hamdan's  Geneva  Convention  challenge  on  three  independ-
ent  grounds:  (1)  the  Geneva  Conventions  are  not  judicially 
enforceable; (2) Hamdan in any event is not entitled  to their 
protections; and (3) even if he is entitled to their protections, 
Councilman  abstention  is  appropriate.  Judge  Williams, 
concurring,  rejected  the  second  ground but  agreed  with  the

majority respecting the first and the  last.  As we explained 
in  Part  III,  supra,  the  abstention  rule  applied  in  Council-
man,  420  U. S.  738,  is  not  applicable  here.55  And  for  the 
reasons that follow, we hold that neither of the other grounds 
the Court of Appeals gave for its decision is persuasive. 

i 
The  Court  of  Appeals  relied  on  Johnson  v.  Eisentrager, 
339  U. S.  763  (1950),  to  hold  that  Hamdan  could  not  invoke 
the Geneva Conventions to challenge the Government's plan 
to  prosecute  him  in  accordance  with  Commission  Order 
No.  1.  Eisentrager  involved  a  challenge  by  21  German  na-
tionals to their 1945 convictions for war crimes by a military 
tribunal  convened  in  Nanking,  China,  and  to  their  subse-
quent  imprisonment  in  occupied  Germany.  The  petitioners 
argued,  inter  alia,  that  the  1929  Geneva  Convention  ren-
dered  illegal  some  of  the  procedures  employed  during  their 
trials, which they said deviated impermissibly from the pro-
cedures  used  by  courts-martial  to  try  American  soldiers. 
See  id.,  at  789.  We  rejected  that  claim  on  the  merits  be-
cause  the  petitioners  (unlike  Hamdan  here)  had  failed  to 
identify  any  prejudicial  disparity  "between  the  Commission 
that  tried  [them]  and  those  that  would  try  an  offending  sol-
dier  of  the  American  forces  of  like  rank,"  and  in  any  event 
could  claim  no  protection,  under  the  1929  Geneva  Con-
vention,  during  trials  for  crimes  that  occurred  before  their 
confinement as prisoners of war.  Id., at 790.56

Opinion of the Court 
Buried in a footnote of the opinion, however, is this curious statement  suggesting  that  the  Court  lacked  power  even  to 

consider the merits of the Geneva Convention argument: 

"We  are  not  holding  that  these  prisoners  have  no  right which  the  military  authorities  are  bound  to  respect. 

The  United  States,  by  the  Geneva  Convention  of  July 27,  1929,  47  Stat.  2021,  concluded  with  forty-six  other 
countries,  including  the  German  Reich,  an  agreement upon  the  treatment  to  be  accorded  captives.  These 
prisoners  claim  to  be  and  are  entitled  to  its  protection. It  is,  however,  the  obvious  scheme  of  the  Agreement 
that  responsibility  for  observance  and  enforcement  of these  rights  is  upon  political  and  military  authorities. 
Rights  of  alien  enemies  are  vindicated  under  it  only through  protests  and  intervention  of  protecting  powers 
as the rights of our citizens against foreign governments are  vindicated  only  by  Presidential  intervention."  Id., 
at 789, n. 14. 
The  Court of  Appeals, on  the  strength  of this  footnote, held that  "the  1949  Geneva  Convention  does  not  confer  upon 

Hamdan  a  right  to  enforce  its  provisions  in  court."  415 F. 3d, at 40. 

Whatever  else  might  be  said  about  the  Eisentrager  foot-note, it does not control this case.  We may assume that "the 
obvious  scheme"  of  the  1949  Conventions  is  identical  in  all relevant  respects  to  that  of  the  1929  Geneva  Convention,

57 

and  even  that  that  scheme  would,  absent  some  other  provi-sion of law, preclude Hamdan's invocation of the Convention's 

provisions as an independent source of law binding the Gov-

not to serve State interests"); GCIII Commentary 91 ("It was not . . . until 
the  Conventions  of  1949  .  .  .  that  the  existence  of  `rights'  conferred  on 
prisoners of war was affirmed").

ernment's  actions  and  furnishing  petitioner  with  any  en-forceable right.

58  For, regardless of the nature of the rights 

conferred  on  Hamdan,  cf.  United  States  v.  Rauscher,  119 U. S.  407  (1886),  they  are,  as  the  Government  does  not  dis-

pute, part of the law of war.  See Hamdi, 542  U. S., at 520- 521 (plurality opinion).  And compliance with the law of war 
is the condition upon which the authority set forth in Article 21 is granted. 

ii 
For  the  Court  of  Appeals,  acknowledgment  of  that  condi-tion  was  no  bar  to  Hamdan's  trial  by  commission.  As  an 

alternative  to  its  holding  that  Hamdan  could  not  invoke  the Geneva  Conventions  at  all,  the  Court  of  Appeals  concluded 
that the Conventions did not in any event apply to the armed conflict during  which  Hamdan was captured.  The court ac-
cepted the Executive's assertions that Hamdan was captured in connection with the United States' war with al Qaeda and 
that  that  war  is  distinct  from  the  war  with  the  Taliban  in Afghanistan.  It  further  reasoned  that  the  war  with  al 
Qaeda evades the reach of the Geneva Conventions.  See 415 F. 3d,  at 41-42.  We, like  Judge Williams, disagree with the 
latter conclusion. The  conflict  with  al  Qaeda  is  not,  according  to  the  Gov-
ernment, a conflict to which the full protections afforded de-tainees  under  the  1949  Geneva  Conventions  apply  because 
Article  2  of  those  Conventions  (which  appears  in  all  four Conventions)  renders  the  full  protections  applicable  only  to 
"all  cases  of  declared  war  or  of  any  other  armed  conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contract-

ing  Parties."  6  U. S. T., at 3318.59  Since Hamdan was cap-tured and detained incident to the conflict with al Qaeda and 

not  the  conflict  with  the  Taliban,  and  since  al  Qaeda,  unlike Afghanistan,  is  not  a  "High  Contracting  Party"--i. e.,  a  sig-
natory  of  the  Conventions,  the  protections  of  those  Conven-tions are not, it is argued, applicable to Hamdan.

60 

We  need  not  decide  the  merits  of  this  argument  because there  is  at  least  one  provision  of  the  Geneva  Conventions 

that  applies  here  even  if  the  relevant  conflict  is  not  one  be-tween signatories.

61  Article 3, often referred to as Common 

Article 3 because, like Article 2, it appears in all four Geneva Conventions,  provides  that  in  a  "conflict  not  of  an  interna-

tional character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting  Parties,  each  Party[

62]  to  the  conflict  shall  be 

bound to apply, as a minimum," certain provisions protecting "[p]ersons  taking  no  active  part  in  the  hostilities,  including

to which the Geneva Conventions apply.  See White House Memorandum,

61 Hamdan  observes  that  Article  5  of  the  Third  Geneva  Convention  re-

quires  that  if  there be  "any  doubt"  whether  he  is entitled  to  prisoner-of-
war  protections,  he  must  be  afforded  those  protections  until  his  status 
is  determined  by  a  "competent  tribunal."  6  U.  S.  T.,  at  3324.  See  also 
Headquarters Depts. of Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, Army 
Regulation 190-8, Enemy Prisoners of War, Retained Personnel, Civilian 
Internees  and  Other  Detainees  (1997),  App.  116.  Because  we  hold  that 
Hamdan  may  not,  in  any  event,  be  tried  by  the  military  commission  the 
President has convened pursuant to the November 13 Order and Commis-
sion  Order  No. 1,  the question  whether his potential  status  as a  prisoner 
of war independently renders illegal his trial by military commission may 
be reserved. 

62 The  term  "Party"  here  has  the  broadest  possible  meaning;  a  Party 

need  neither  be  a  signatory  of  the  Convention  nor  "even  represent  a 

legal  entity  capable  of  undertaking  international  obligations."  GCIII 
Commentary 37.

Opinion of the Court 
members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed 

hors de combat by . . . detention."  Ibid.  One 
such  provision  prohibits  "the  passing  of  sentences  and  the carrying  out  of  executions  without  previous  judgment  pro-

nounced  by  a  regularly  constituted  court  affording  all  the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by 
civilized peoples."  Id., at 3320. 

The  Court  of  Appeals  thought,  and  the  Government  as-serts, that Common  Article  3 does not  apply to  Hamdan be-

cause  the  conflict  with  al  Qaeda,  being  " `international  in scope,' "  does  not  qualify  as  a  " `conflict  not  of  an  interna-
tional character.' "  415 F. 3d, at 41.  That reasoning is erro-
neous.  The term "conflict not of an international character" 
is  used  here  in  contradistinction  to  a  conflict  between  na-
tions.  So  much  is  demonstrated  by  the  "fundamental  logic 
[of]  the  Convention's  provisions  on  its  application."  Id.,  at 
44  (Williams,  J.,  concurring).  Common  Article  2  provides 
that  "the  present  Convention  shall  apply  to  all  cases  of  de-
clared  war  or  of  any  other  armed  conflict  which  may  arise 
between  two  or  more  of  the  High  Contracting  Parties."  6 
U. S. T., at 3318 (Art. 2, || 1).  High Contracting Parties (sig-
natories)  also  must  abide  by  all  terms  of  the  Conventions 
vis-a` -vis  one  another  even  if  one  party  to  the  conflict  is  a 
nonsignatory  "Power,"  and  must  so  abide  vis-a` -vis  the  non-
signatory  if  "the  latter  accepts  and  applies"  those  terms. 
Ibid.  (Art.  2,  || 3).  Common  Article  3,  by  contrast,  affords 
some  minimal  protection,  falling  short  of  full  protection 
under the Conventions, to individuals associated with neither 
a  signatory  nor  even  a  nonsignatory  "Power"  who  are  in-
volved  in  a  conflict  "in  the  territory  of "  a  signatory.  The 
latter kind  of conflict is  distinguishable from  the  conflict de-
scribed  in  Common  Article  2  chiefly  because  it  does  not  in-
volve  a  clash  between  nations  (whether  signatories  or  not). 
In context,  then, the  phrase "not  of an  international charac-

in  one  kind  of  "conflict  not  of  an  international  character," 
i. e., a civil war, see GCIII Commentary 36-37, the commen-taries  also  make  clear  "that  the  scope  of  application  of  the

constituted court  affording all  the  judicial guarantees which are  recognized  as  indispensable  by  civilized  peoples."  6 

U. S. T.,  at  3320  (Art.  3,  || 1(d)).  While  the  term  "regularly constituted  court"  is  not  specifically  defined  in  either  Com-
mon  Article  3  or  its  accompanying  commentary,  other sources  disclose  its  core meaning.  The  commentary  accom-
panying  a  provision  of  the  Fourth  Geneva  Convention,  for example,  defines  " `regularly  constituted' "  tribunals  to  in-
clude  "ordinary  military  courts"  and  "definitely  exclud[e]  all special  tribunals."  GCIV  Commentary  340  (defining  the 
term  "properly  constituted"  in  Article  66,  which  the  com-mentary treats as identical to "regularly constituted"); 

64  see 

also Yamashita, 327 U. S., at 44 (Rutledge, J., dissenting) (de-scribing military commission as a court "specially constituted 

for  the  particular  trial").  And  one  of  the  Red  Cross'  own treatises  defines  "regularly  constituted  court"  as  used  in 
Common Article 3 to mean "established and organised in ac-cordance  with  the  laws  and  procedures  already  in  force  in 
a  country."  Int'l  Comm.  of  Red  Cross,  1  Customary  Int'l Humanitarian  Law  355  (2005);  see  also  GCIV  Commentary 
340  (observing  that  "ordinary  military  courts"  will  "be  set up  in  accordance  with  the  recognized  principles  governing 
the administration of justice"). The Government offers only a cursory defense of Hamdan's 
military  commission  in  light  of  Common  Article  3.  See Brief  for  Respondents  49-50.  As

Inextricably intertwined with the question of regular con-stitution  is  the  evaluation  of  the  procedures  governing  the 

tribunal and whether they afford "all the judicial guarantees which  are  recognized  as  indispensable  by  civilized  peoples." 
6  U. S. T.,  at  3320  (Art.  3,  || 1(d)).  Like  the  phrase  "regu-larly constituted court," this phrase is not defined in the text 
of  the  Geneva  Conventions.  But  it  must  be  understood to  incorporate  at  least  the  barest  of  those  trial  protections 
that  have  been  recognized  by  customary  international  law. Many of these are described in Article 75 of Protocol I to the 
Geneva  Conventions  of  1949,  adopted  in  1977  (Protocol  I). Although the  United States  declined to ratify Protocol I,  its 
objections were not to Article 75 thereof.  Indeed, it appears that  the  Government  "regard[s]  the  provisions  of  Article  75 
as  an  articulation  of  safeguards  to  which  all  persons  in  the hands  of  an  enemy  are  entitled."  Taft,  The  Law  of  Armed 
Conflict After 9/11: Some Salient Features, 28 Yale J. Int'l L. 319, 322  (2003).  Among  the  rights set  forth in  Article 75  is 
the  "right  to  be  tried  in  [one's]  presence."  Protocol  I,  Art. 75(4)(e).

66 

65 Further  evidence  of  this  tribunal's  irregular  constitution  is  the  fact 
that its rules and procedures are subject to change midtrial, at the whim 
of  the  Executive.  See  Commission  Order  No.  1,  $ 11  (providing  that  the 
Secretary  of  Defense  may  change  the  governing  rules  "from  time  to 
time"). 

66 Other international instruments to which the United States is a signa-

tory include the same basic protections set forth in Article 75.  See, e. g., 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Art. 14, || 3(d), Mar. 
23, 1976, 999 U. N. T. S. 171 (setting forth the right of an accused "[t]o be 
tried  in  his  presence,  and  to  defend  himself  in  person  or  through  legal 
assistance  of  his  own  choosing").  Following  World  War  II,  several 
defendants were tried and convicted by military commission for violations

CLARK  v.  ARIZONA 
certiorari

736  CLARK  v.  ARIZONA 

Syllabus 
that  in  light  of  the  facts  of  the  crime,  the  expert  evaluations,  Clark's 
actions and behavior both before and after the shooting, and the obser-
vations  of  those  who  knew  him,  Clark  had  not  established  that  his 
schizophrenia distorted his perception of reality so severely that he did 
not know his actions were wrong. 

Clark  moved  to  vacate  the  judgment  and  life  sentence,  arguing, 
among other things, that Arizona's insanity test and its Mott rule each 
violate  due process.  He claimed that  the Arizona  Legislature had im-
permissibly  narrowed  its  insanity  standard  in  1993  when  it  eliminated 
the  first  of  the  two  parts  of  the  traditional  M'Naghten  insanity  test. 
The trial court denied the motion.  Affirming, the Arizona Court of Ap-
peals  held,  among  other  things,  that  the  State's  insanity  scheme  was 
consistent  with due process.  The court  read  Mott as barring the trial 
court's  consideration  of  evidence  of  Clark's  mental  illness  and  capacity 
directly on the element of mens rea. 

Held: 

1.  Due  process  does  not  prohibit  Arizona's  use  of  an  insanity  test 
stated solely in terms of the capacity to tell whether an act charged as 
a crime was right or wrong.  Pp. 747-756. 

(a)  The first part of the landmark English rule in M'Naghten's Case 
asks about cognitive capacity: whether a mental defect leaves a defend-
ant unable to understand what he was doing.  The second part presents 
an ostensibly alternative basis for recognizing a defense of insanity un-
derstood as a lack of moral capacity: whether a mental disease or defect 
leaves a defendant unable to understand that his action was wrong.  Al-
though  the  Arizona  Legislature  at  first  adopted  the  full  M'Naghten 
statement,  it  later  dropped  the  cognitive  incapacity  part.  Under  cur-
rent  Arizona  law,  a  defendant  will  not  be  adjudged  insane  unless  he 
demonstrates that at the time of the crime, he was afflicted with a men-
tal disease or defect of such severity that he did not know the criminal 
act was wrong.  Pp. 747-748. 

(b)  Clark  insists  that  the  side-by-side  M'Naghten  test  represents 
the minimum that a government must provide, and he argues that elimi-
nating  the  first  part  " `offends  [a]  principle  of  justice  so  rooted  in  the 
traditions  and  conscience  of  our  people  as  to  be  ranked  as  fundamen-
tal,' " Patterson  v.  New  York,  432  U. S.  197,  202.  The  claim  entails  no 
light burden, and Clark does not carry it.  History shows no deference 
to M'Naghten that could elevate its formula to the level of fundamental 
principle,  so  as  to  limit  the traditional  recognition  of  a State's  capacity 
to  define  crimes  and  defenses.  See,  e. g.,  Patterson,  supra,  at  210. 
Even  a  cursory  examination  of  the  traditional  Anglo-American  ap-
proaches  to  insanity  reveals  significant  differences  among  them,  with 

548US2 Unit: $U87 [08-19-09 17:32:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus 
four traditional strains variously combined to yield a diversity of Ameri-
can standards.  Although 17  States  and the Federal  Government  have 
adopted recognizable versions of the M'Naghten test with both its com-
ponents, other  States have  adopted a  variety of  standards based  on all 
or part of one or more of four variants.  The alternatives are multiplied 
further  by  variations  in  the  prescribed  insanity  verdict.  This  varied 
background makes clear that no particular formulation has evolved into 
a  baseline  for  due  process,  and  that  the  insanity  rule,  like  the  concep-
tualization  of  criminal  offenses,  is  substantially  open  to  state  choice. 
Pp. 748-753. 

(c)  Nor  does  Arizona's  abbreviation  of  the  M'Naghten  statement 
raise a  proper claim that some constitutional minimum has been short-
changed.  Although  Arizona's  former  statement  of  the  full  M'Naghten 
rule  was  constitutionally  adequate,  the  abbreviated  rule  is  no  less  so, 
for cognitive incapacity is relevant under that statement, just as it was 
under  the  more  extended  formulation,  and  evidence  going  to  cognitive 
incapacity  has  the  same  significance  under  the  short  form  as  it  had 
under the long.  Though Clark is correct that applying the moral inca-
pacity test (telling right from wrong) does not necessarily require evalu-
ation  of  a  defendant's  cognitive  capacity  to  appreciate  the  nature  and 
quality of the acts charged against him, his argument fails to recognize 
that cognitive incapacity is itself enough to demonstrate moral incapac-
ity, so that evidence bearing on whether the defendant knew the nature 
and quality of his actions is both relevant and admissible.  In practical 
terms,  if  a  defendant  did  not  know  what  he  was  doing  when  he  acted, 
he  could  not  have  known  that  he  was  performing  the  wrongful  act 
charged as a crime.  The Arizona appeals court acknowledged as much 
in this case.  Clark adopted this very analysis in the trial court, which 
apparently  agreed  when  it  admitted  his  cognitive  incapacity  evidence 
for consideration under the State's moral incapacity formulation.  Clark 
can  point  to  no  evidence  bearing  on  insanity  that  was  excluded. 
Pp. 753-756. 

2.  The Arizona Supreme Court's Mott rule does not violate due proc-
ess.  Pp. 756-779. 

(a)  Mott held that testimony of a professional psychologist  or psy-
chiatrist about a defendant's mental incapacity owing to mental disease 
or  defect  was  admissible,  and  could  be  considered,  only  for  its  bearing 
on  an  insanity  defense,  but  could  not  be  considered  on  the  element  of 
mens rea.  Of the three categories of evidence that potentially bear on 
mens rea--(1) everyday "observation evidence" either by lay or expert 
witnesses of what Clark did or said, which may support the professional 
diagnoses  of  disease  and  in  any  event  is  the  kind  of  evidence  that  can 
be  relevant  to  show  what  was  on  Clark's  mind  when  he  fired  his  gun;

Syllabus 
(2) "mental-disease evidence," typically from professional psychologists 
or psychiatrists based on factual reports, professional observations, and 
tests  about Clark's mental disease,  with features described by the wit-
ness; and  (3) "capacity  evidence,"  typically  by the  same experts,  about 
Clark's  capacity for  cognition  and moral  judgment  (and ultimately  also 
his capacity to form mens rea)--Mott imposed no restriction on consid-
ering evidence of the first sort, but applies to the latter two.  Although 
the  trial  court  seems  to  have  applied  the  Mott  restriction  to  all  three 
categories of evidence Clark offered for the purpose of showing what he 
called his inability to form the required mens rea, his objection to Mott's 
application does not turn on the distinction between lay and expert wit-
nesses  or  the  kinds  of  testimony  they  were  competent  to  present. 
Rather,  the  issue  here  is  Clark's  claim  that  the  Mott rule  violates  due 
process.  Pp. 756-765. 

(b)  Clark's Mott challenge turns on the application of the presump-
tion  of  innocence  in  criminal  cases,  the  presumption  of  sanity,  and  the 
principle  that  a  criminal  defendant  is  entitled  to  present  relevant  and 
favorable  evidence  on  an  element  of  the  offense  charged  against  him. 
Pp. 765-771. 

(i)  The presumption of innocence is that a defendant  is innocent 
unless and until the government proves beyond a reasonable doubt each 
element  of  the  offense  charged,  including  the  mental  element  or  mens 
rea.  The  modern  tendency  is  to  describe  the  mens  rea  required  to 
prove particular offenses in specific terms, as shown in the Arizona stat-
ute requiring the State to prove that in acting to kill the victim, Clark 
intended  to  kill  a  law  enforcement  officer  on  duty  or  knew  that  the 
victim was such an officer on duty.  As applied to mens rea (and every 
other  element),  the  force  of  the  presumption  of  innocence  is  measured 
by the force of the showing needed to overcome it, which is proof beyond 
a reasonable doubt that a defendant's state of mind was in fact what the 
charge states.  See In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 361-363.  P. 766. 

(ii) The presumption of sanity dispenses with a requirement that 
the government include as an element of every criminal charge an alle-
gation that the defendant had the capacity to form the mens rea neces-
sary for conviction and criminal responsibility.  Unlike the presumption 
of  innocence,  the  presumption  of  sanity's  force  varies  across  the  many 
state  and  federal  jurisdictions,  and  prior  law  has  recognized  consider-
able  leeway  on  the  part  of  the  legislative  branch  in  defining  the  pre-
sumption's strength through the kind of evidence and degree of persua-
siveness necessary to overcome it, see Fisher v.  United States, 328 U. S. 
463,  466-476.  There  are  two  points  where  the  sanity  or  capacity  pre-
sumption may be placed in issue.  First, a State may allow a defendant 
to introduce (and a factfinder to consider) evidence of mental disease or 

548US2 Unit: $U87 [08-19-09 17:32:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus 
incapacity  for  the  bearing  it  can  have  on  the  government's  burden  to 
show mens rea.  Second, the sanity presumption's force may be tested 
in  the  consideration  of  an  insanity  defense  raised  by  a  defendant.  In-
sanity rules like M'Naghten and the variants noted above are attempts 
to  define or indicate the kinds of mental  differences that overcome  the 
presumption of sanity or capacity and therefore excuse a defendant from 
customary  criminal  responsibility, see, e. g., Jones v.  United States, 463 
U. S. 354, 373, n. 4, even if the prosecution has otherwise overcome the 
presumption  of  innocence  by  convincing  the  factfinder  of  all  the  ele-
ments  charged  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.  The  burden  a  defendant 
raising the insanity issue  must carry defines the strength of the sanity 
presumption.  A State may, for example, place the burden of persuasion 
on a defendant to prove insanity as the applicable law defines it, whether 
by a preponderance of the evidence or to some more convincing degree. 
See, e. g., Leland v.  Oregon, 343 U. S. 790, 798.  Pp. 766-769. 

(iii)  A defendant has a  due process right to present evidence  fa-
vorable  to  himself  on  an  element  that  must  be  proven  to  convict  him. 
Evidence tending to show that a defendant suffers from mental disease 
and  lacks  capacity  to  form  mens  rea  is  relevant to  rebut  evidence  that 
he did in fact form the required mens rea at the time in question.  Thus, 
Clark  claims  a  right  to  require  the  factfinder  in  this  case  to  consider 
testimony  about  his  mental  illness  and  his  incapacity  directly,  when 
weighing  the  persuasiveness  of  other  evidence  tending  to  show  mens 
rea, which the prosecution has the burden to prove.  However, the right 
to introduce relevant evidence can be curtailed if there is a good reason 
for  doing  so.  For  example,  trial  judges  may  "exclude  evidence  if  its 
probative  value  is  outweighed  by  certain  other  factors  such  as  unfair 
prejudice,  confusion  of  the  issues,  or  potential  to  mislead  the  jury." 
Holmes v.  South Carolina, 547 U. S. 319, 326.  And if evidence may be 
kept  out  entirely,  its  consideration  may  be  subject  to  limitation,  which 
Arizona  claims  the  power  to  impose  here.  Under  state  law,  mental-
disease and capacity evidence may be considered only for its bearing on 
the insanity defense, and it will avail a defendant only if it is persuasive 
enough to satisfy the defendant's burden as defined by the terms of that 
defense.  Such  evidence  is  thus  being  channeled  or  restricted  to  one 
issue; it is not being excluded entirely, and the question is whether rea-
sons for requiring it to be channeled and restricted satisfy due process's 
fundamental fairness standard.  Pp. 769-771. 

(c)  The  reasons  supporting  the  Arizona  rule  satisfy  due  process. 
Pp. 771-778. 

(i)  The  first  such  reason  is  Arizona's  authority  to  define  its  pre-
sumption of sanity (or capacity or responsibility) by choosing an insanity 
definition  and  placing  the  burden  of  persuasion  on  criminal  defendants 

548US2 Unit: $U87 [08-19-09 17:32:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN
740  CLARK  v.  ARIZONA 

Syllabus 
claiming incapacity as an excuse.  Consistent with due process, a State 
can require defendants to bear that burden, see Leland, supra, at 797- 
799,  and  Clark  does  not  object  to  Arizona's  decision  to  require  persua-
sion to  a clear  and  convincing  degree  before  the presumption  of  sanity 
and normal responsibility is overcome.  If a State is to have this author-
ity in practice as well as in theory, it must be able to deny a defendant 
the  opportunity  to  displace  the  sanity  presumption  more  easily  when 
addressing a different issue during the criminal trial.  Yet just such an 
opportunity  would  be  available  if  expert  testimony  of  mental  disease 
and incapacity could be considered for whatever a factfinder might think 
it  was  worth  on  the  mens  rea  issue.  The  sanity  presumption  would 
then  be  only  as  strong  as  the  evidence  a  factfinder  would  accept  as 
enough  to  raise  a  reasonable  doubt  about  mens  rea;  once  reasonable 
doubt was found, acquittal would be required, and the standards estab-
lished  for  the  insanity  defense  would  go  by  the  boards.  What  counts 
for due process is simply that a State wishing to avoid a second avenue 
for exploring capacity, less stringent for a defendant, has a good reason 
for confining the consideration of mental-disease and incapacity evidence 
to the insanity defense.  Pp. 771-773. 

(ii)  Arizona's  rule  also  serves  to  avoid  confusion  and  misunder-
standing  on  the  part  of  jurors.  The  controversial  character  of  some 
categories of mental disease, the potential of mental-disease evidence to 
mislead,  and  the danger  of according  greater  certainty to  capacity  evi-
dence  than  experts  claim  for  it  give  rise  to  risks  that  may  reasonably 
be hedged by channeling the consideration of such evidence to the insan-
ity  issue  on  which,  in  States  like  Arizona,  a  defendant  has  the  burden 
of  persuasion.  First,  the  diagnosis  may  mask  vigorous  debate  within 
the psychiatric profession about the very contours of the mental disease 
itself.  See,  e. g.,  Jones,  supra,  at  364-365,  n.  13.  Though  mental-
disease evidence is certainly not condemned wholesale, the consequence 
of this professional ferment is a general caution in treating psychological 
classifications  as  predicates  for  excusing  otherwise  criminal  conduct. 
Next, there is the potential of mental-disease evidence to mislead jurors 
(when  they  are  the  factfinders)  through  the  power  of  this  kind  of  evi-
dence  to  suggest  that  a  defendant  suffering  from  a  recognized  mental 
disease  lacks  cognitive,  moral,  volitional,  or  other  capacity,  when  that 
may not be a sound conclusion at all.  Even when a category of mental 
disease is broadly accepted and the assignment of a defendant's behavior 
to that category is uncontroversial, the classification may suggest some-
thing very significant about a defendant's capacity, when in fact the clas-
sification  tells  little  or  nothing  about  the  defendant's  ability  to  form 
mens rea or to exercise the cognitive, moral, or volitional capacities that 
define  legal  sanity.  The  limits  of  the  utility  of  a  professional  disease

Syllabus 
diagnosis are evident in the dispute between the two testifying experts 
in  this  case;  they  agree  that  Clark  was  schizophrenic,  but  they  reach 
opposite  conclusions  on  whether  his  mental  disease  left  him  bereft  of 
cognitive or moral capacity.  Finally, there are particular risks inherent 
in the opinions of the experts who supplement the mental-disease classi-
fications with opinions on incapacity: on whether the mental disease ren-
dered  a  particular  defendant  incapable  of  the  cognition  necessary  for 
moral  judgment  or  mens  rea  or  otherwise  incapable  of  understanding 
the  wrongfulness  of  the  conduct  charged.  Unlike  observational  evi-
dence bearing on mens rea, capacity evidence consists of judgment, and 
judgment is fraught with multiple perils.  Although such capacity judg-
ments may be given in the utmost good faith, their potentially tenuous 
character  is  indicated by  the  candor  of  the  defense  expert  in this  very 
case.  He testified that Clark lacked the capacity to appreciate the cir-
cumstances realistically and to understand the wrongfulness of what he 
was  doing,  but  he  admitted  that  no  one  knew  exactly  what  was  on 
Clark's mind at the time of the shooting.  Even when an expert is con-
fident that his understanding of the mind is reliable, judgment address-
ing the basic categories of capacity requires a leap from the concepts of 
psychology, which are devised for thinking about treatment, to the con-
cepts  of legal  sanity,  which  are devised  for  thinking  about  criminal  re-
sponsibility.  Pp. 773-778. 

(d)  For these reasons, there is also no cause to claim that channeling 
evidence on  mental  disease and  capacity offends any " `principle  of  jus-
tice  so  rooted  in  the  traditions  and  conscience  of  our  people  as  to  be 
ranked as fundamental,' " Patterson, 432 U. S., at 202.  P. 779.

Opinion of the Court 

I 
In  the  early  hours  of  June 21,  2000, Officer  Jeffrey Moritz 
of  the  Flagstaff  Police  responded  in  uniform  to  complaints 
that  a  pickup  truck  with  loud  music  blaring  was  circling  a 
residential  block.  When  he  located  the  truck,  the  officer 
turned  on  the  emergency  lights  and  siren  of  his  marked  pa-
trol  car,  which  prompted  petitioner  Eric  Clark,  the  truck's 
driver  (then  17),  to  pull  over.  Officer  Moritz  got  out  of  the 
patrol  car  and  told  Clark  to  stay  where  he  was.  Less  than 
a  minute  later,  Clark  shot  the  officer,  who  died  soon  after 
but  not  before  calling the  police  dispatcher  for  help.  Clark 
ran  away  on  foot  but  was  arrested  later  that  day  with  gun-
powder  residue  on  his  hands;  the  gun  that  killed  the  officer 
was found nearby, stuffed into a knit cap. 

Clark  was  charged  with  first-degree  murder  under  Ariz. 
Rev.  Stat.  Ann.  $ 13-1105(A)(3)  (West  Supp.  2005)  for  inten-
tionally or knowingly killing a law enforcement officer in the 
line  of  duty.1  In  March  2001,  Clark  was  found  incompetent 
to stand trial and was committed to a state hospital for treat-
ment, but two years later the same trial court found his com-
petence restored and ordered him to be tried.  Clark waived 
his right to a jury, and the case was heard by the court. 

At trial, Clark did not contest the shooting and death, but 
relied  on  his  undisputed  paranoid  schizophrenia  at  the  time 
of  the  incident  in  denying  that  he  had  the  specific  intent  to 
shoot  a  law  enforcement  officer  or  knowledge  that  he  was 
doing so, as required by the statute.  Accordingly, the prose-
cutor offered circumstantial evidence that Clark knew Officer 
Moritz was a law enforcement officer.  The evidence showed 
that  the  officer  was  in  uniform  at  the  time,  that  he  caught 

1 Section  13-1105(A)(3)  provides  that  "[a]  person  commits  first  degree 
murder if . . . [i]ntending or knowing that the person's conduct will cause 
death  to  a  law  enforcement  officer,  the  person  causes  the  death  of  a  law 
enforcement officer who is in the line of duty."

Opinion of the Court 
up with  Clark in  a  marked police  car  with  emergency  lights 
and siren going, and that Clark acknowledged the symbols of 
police authority  and stopped.  The  testimony  for  the  prose-
cution indicated that Clark had intentionally lured an officer 
to the scene to kill him, having told some people a few weeks 
before  the  incident  that  he  wanted  to  shoot  police  officers. 
At  the  close  of  the  State's  evidence,  the  trial  court  denied 
Clark's motion for judgment of acquittal for failure to prove 
intent  to  kill  a  law  enforcement  officer  or  knowledge  that 
Officer Moritz was a law enforcement officer. 

In  presenting  the  defense  case,  Clark  claimed  mental  ill-
ness, which he sought to introduce for two purposes.  First, 
he raised the affirmative defense of insanity, putting the bur-
den  on  himself  to  prove  by  clear  and  convincing  evidence, 

$ 13-502(C) (West 2001), that "at the time of the commission

or defect of such severity that [he] did not know the criminal 
act  was  wrong,"  $ 13-502(A).2  Second,  he  aimed  to  rebut 
the prosecution's evidence of the requisite mens rea, that he 
had  acted  intentionally  or  knowingly  to  kill  a  law  enforce-
ment  officer.  See,  e. g.,  Record  in  No.  CR  2000-538  (Ariz. 
Super. Ct.), Doc. 374 (hereinafter Record). 

2 Section 13-502(A) provides in full that 
"A person may be found guilty except insane if at the time of the commis-
sion of the criminal act the person was afflicted with a mental disease or 
defect of such severity that the person did not know the criminal act was 
wrong.  A  mental  disease  or  defect  constituting  legal  insanity  is  an  af-
firmative  defense.  Mental  disease  or  defect  does  not  include  disorders 
that  result  from  acute  voluntary  intoxication  or  withdrawal  from  alcohol 
or drugs, character defects, psychosexual disorders or impulse control dis-
orders.  Conditions  that  do  not  constitute  legal  insanity  include  but  are 
not limited to momentary, temporary conditions arising from the pressure 
of  the  circumstances, moral  decadence,  depravity  or passion  growing  out 
of anger, jealousy, revenge, hatred or other motives in a person who does 
not suffer from a mental disease or defect or an abnormality that is mani-
fested only by criminal conduct." 

A  defendant  found  "guilty  except  insane"  is  committed  to  a  state 
mental-health facility for treatment.  See $ 13-502(D).

Opinion of the Court 
The trial court ruled that Clark could not rely on evidence bearing  on  insanity  to  dispute  the  mens  rea.  The  court 

cited State v.  Mott, 187 Ariz. 536, 931 P. 2d 1046, cert. denied, 520 U. S. 1234 (1997), which "refused to allow psychiatric tes-
timony to negate specific intent," 187 Ariz., at 541, 931 P. 2d, at 1051,  and held  that "Arizona  does  not  allow evidence  of  a 
defendant's  mental  disorder  short  of  insanity  .  .  .  to  negate the 

mens rea element of a crime," ibid.3 As  to  his  insanity,  then,  Clark  presented  testimony  from 

classmates,  school  officials,  and  his  family  describing  his  in-creasingly  bizarre  behavior  over  the  year  before  the  shoot-
ing.  Witnesses  testified,  for  example,  that  paranoid  delu-sions  led  Clark  to  rig  a  fishing  line  with  beads  and  wind 
chimes at home to alert him to intrusion by invaders, and to keep  a  bird  in  his  automobile  to  warn  of  airborne  poison. 
There  was  lay  and  expert  testimony  that  Clark  thought Flagstaff  was  populated  with  "aliens"  (some  impersonating 
government agents), the "aliens" were trying to kill him, and bullets were the only way to stop them.  A psychiatrist tes-
tified  that  Clark  was  suffering  from  paranoid  schizophrenia with  delusions  about  "aliens"  when  he  killed  Officer  Moritz, 
and he concluded that Clark was incapable of luring the offi-cer or understanding right from wrong and that he was thus 
insane at the time of the killing.  In rebuttal, a psychiatrist for  the  State  gave  his  opinion  that  Clark's  paranoid  schizo-
phrenia did not keep him from appreciating the wrongfulness of  his  conduct,  as  shown  by  his  actions  before  and  after  the 
shooting  (such  as  circling  the  residential  block  with  music blaring as if to lure the police to intervene, evading the police 
after the shooting, and hiding the gun). At the close of the defense case consisting of this evidence 
bearing  on  mental  illness,  the  trial  court  denied  Clark's  re-

3 The  trial  court  permitted  Clark  to  introduce  this  evidence,  whether 
primarily going to insanity or lack of intent, "because it goes to the insan-
ity  issue  and  because  we're  not  in  front  of  a  jury."  App.  9.  It  also  al-
lowed him to make an offer of proof as to intent to preserve the issue on 
appeal.  Ibid.

Opinion of the Court 
newed  motion  for  a  directed  verdict  grounded  on  failure  of the  prosecution  to  show  that  Clark  knew  the  victim  was  a 

police  officer.4  The  judge  then  issued  a  special  verdict  of first-degree  murder,  expressly  finding  that  Clark  shot  and 
caused the death of Officer Moritz beyond a reasonable doubt and that Clark had not shown that he was insane at the time. 
The judge noted that though Clark was indisputably afflicted with paranoid  schizophrenia at  the  time  of the  shooting, the 
mental  illness  "did  not . . .  distort  his  perception  of  reality so  severely  that  he  did  not  know  his  actions  were  wrong." 
App. 334.  For this conclusion, the judge expressly relied on "the  facts  of  the  crime,  the  evaluations  of  the  experts, 
[Clark's]  actions  and  behavior  both  before  and  after  the shooting,  and  the  observations  of  those  that  knew  [Clark]." 
Id., at 333.  The sentence was life imprisonment without the possibility of release for 25 years. 

Clark  moved  to  vacate  the  judgment  and  sentence,  ar-guing,  among  other  things,  that  Arizona's  insanity  test  and 
its  Mott  rule  each  violate  due  process.  As  to  the  insanity standard,  Clark  claimed  (as  he  had  argued  earlier)  that  the 
Arizona  Legislature  had  impermissibly  narrowed  its  stand-ard  in 1993 when it eliminated the  first part  of the  two-part 
insanity  test  announced  in  M'Naghten's  Case,  10  Cl.  &  Fin. 200,  8  Eng.  Rep.  718  (1843).  The  court  denied  the  motion. 

The  Court  of  Appeals  of  Arizona  affirmed  Clark's  convic-tion,  treating  the  conclusion  on  sanity  as  supported  by 
enough evidence to withstand review for abuse of discretion, and  holding  the  State's  insanity  scheme  consistent  with  due 
process.  App.  336.  As  to  the  latter,  the  Court  of  Appeals reasoned  that  there  is  no  constitutional  requirement  to  rec-
ognize an insanity defense at all, the bounds of which are left to  the  State's  discretion.  Beyond  that,  the  appellate  court 
followed  Mott, reading  it  as  barring  the  trial  court's  consid-

4 Clark did not at this time make an additional offer of proof, as contem-
plated  by  the  trial  court  when  it  ruled  that  it  would  consider  evidence 
bearing on insanity as to insanity but not as to mens rea.  See n. 3, supra.

eration of evidence of Clark's mental illness and capacity di-rectly  on  the  element  of  mens  rea.  The  Supreme  Court  of 

Arizona denied further review. We  granted  certiorari  to  decide  whether due  process  pro-
hibits Arizona from thus narrowing its insanity test or from excluding  evidence  of  mental  illness  and  incapacity  due  to 
mental illness to rebut evidence of the requisite criminal in-tent.  546 U. S. 1060 (2005).  We now affirm. 

II 
Clark first  says that Arizona's definition of insanity, being only  a  fragment of  the  Victorian  standard  from  which  it  de-

rives,  violates  due  process.  The  landmark  English  rule  in 
M'Naghten's Case, supra, states that 

"the  jurors  ought  to  be  told  .  .  .  that  to  establish  a  de-fence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved 

that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was laboring under such a defect of reason, from 
disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and qual-ity of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he 
did  not  know  he  was  doing  what  was  wrong."  Id.,  at 210, 8 Eng. Rep., at 722. 

The first part asks about cognitive capacity: whether a men-tal  defect  leaves  a  defendant  unable  to  understand  what  he 
is doing.  The second part presents an ostensibly alternative basis  for  recognizing  a  defense  of  insanity  understood  as  a 
lack  of  moral  capacity:  whether  a  mental  disease  or  defect leaves  a  defendant  unable  to  understand  that  his  action  is 
wrong. When  the  Arizona  Legislature  first  codified  an  insanity 
rule,  it  adopted  the  full  M'Naghten  statement  (subject  to modifications in details that do not matter here): 

"A  person  is  not  responsible  for  criminal  conduct  if  at the  time  of  such  conduct  the  person  was  suffering  from 
such  a  mental  disease  or  defect  as  not  to  know  the  na-

ture  and  quality  of  the  act  or,  if  such  person  did  know, that  such  person  did  not  know  that  what  he  was  doing 

was  wrong."  Ariz.  Rev.  Stat.  Ann.  $ 13-502  (West 1978).

5 

In  1993,  the  legislature  dropped  the  cognitive  incapacity part,  leaving  only  moral  incapacity  as  the  nub  of  the  stated 
definition.  See  1993  Ariz.  Sess.  Laws  ch.  256,  $$ 2-3.6 Under current Arizona law, a defendant will not be adjudged 
insane  unless he  demonstrates that  "at the  time  of  the  com-mission  of  the  criminal  act  [he]  was  afflicted  with  a  mental 
disease or defect of such severity that [he] did not know the criminal  act  was  wrong,"  Ariz.  Rev.  Stat.  Ann.  $ 13-502(A) 
(West 2001).  A 

Clark challenges the 1993 amendment excising the express reference  to  the  cognitive  incapacity  element.  He  insists 
that  the  side-by-side  M'Naghten  test  represents  the  mini-mum  that  a  government  must  provide  in  recognizing  an 
alternative  to  criminal  responsibility  on  grounds  of  mental illness  or  defect,  and  he  argues  that  elimination  of  the 
M'Naghten reference to nature and quality " `offends [a] prin-ciple  of  justice  so  rooted  in  the  traditions  and  conscience  of 
our  people  as  to  be  ranked  as  fundamental,' "  Patterson  v. 

5 This statutory standard followed the Arizona Supreme Court's declara-
tion  that  Arizona  has  "uniformly  adhered"  to  the  two-part  M'Naghten 
standard.  State  v.  Schantz,  98  Ariz.  200,  206,  403  P.  2d  521,  525  (1965) 
(citing cases), cert. denied, 382 U. S. 1015 (1966). 

6 This change was accompanied by others, principally an enumeration of 

mental  states  excluded  from  the  category  of  "mental  disease  or  defect," 
such  as  voluntary  intoxication  and  other  conditions,  and  a  change  of  the 
insanity verdict  from  "not  responsible for  criminal  conduct"  by  reason of 
insanity  to  "guilty  except  insane."  See  1993  Ariz.  Sess.  Laws  ch.  256, 

$$ 2-3.  The  1993  amendments  were  prompted,  at  least  in  part,  by  an 
acquittal  by  reason  of  insanity  in  a  murder  case.  See  Note,  Arizona's 
Insane Response to Insanity, 40 Ariz. L. Rev. 287, 290 (1998).

nations of four building blocks should not be read to signify that no other 
components  contribute  to  these  insanity  standards  or  that  there  are  no 
material distinctions between jurisdictions testing insanity with the same 
building blocks.  For example, the jurisdictions limit, in varying degrees, 
which sorts of mental illness or defect can give rise to a successful insanity 
defense.  Compare,  e. g.,  Ariz.  Rev.  Stat.  Ann.  $ 13-502(A)  (West  2001) 
(excluding  from  definition  of  "mental  disease  or  defect"  acute  voluntary 
intoxication, withdrawal from alcohol or drugs, character defects, psycho-
sexual disorders, and impulse control disorders) with, e. g., Ind. Code $ 35- 
41-3-6(b)  (West  2004)  (excluding  from  definition  of  "mental  disease  or 
defect"  "abnormality  manifested  only  by  repeated  unlawful  or  antisocial 
conduct").  We need not compare the standards under a finer lens because 
our coarser analysis shows that the standards vary significantly.

Fourteen  jurisdictions,  inspired  by  the  Model  Penal  Code,15 have  in  place  an  amalgam  of  the  volitional  incapacity  test 

and some variant of the moral incapacity test, satisfaction of 
either  (generally  by  showing  a  defendant's  substantial  lack

a full  M'Naghten  test  with  a  volitional  incapacity  for-
mula.17  And  New  Hampshire  alone  stands  by  the  product-
of-mental-illness  test.18  The  alternatives  are  multiplied 
further  by  variations  in  the  prescribed  insanity  verdict:  a

alternative  of  "guilty  but  mentally  ill." 19  Finally,  four States  have  no  affirmative  insanity  defense,

20  though  one 

provides  for  a  "guilty  and  mentally  ill"  verdict.21  These four,  like  a  number  of  others  that  recognize  an  affirmative 

insanity  defense,  allow  consideration  of  evidence  of  mental illness  directly  on  the  element  of  mens  rea  defining  the 
offense.22 With  this  varied  background,  it  is  clear that  no particular 
formulation  has  evolved  into  a baseline  for  due process,  and that  the  insanity  rule,  like  the  conceptualization  of  criminal 
offenses,  is  substantially  open  to  state  choice.  Indeed,  the legitimacy of such choice is the  more obvious when one con-
siders the interplay of legal concepts of mental illness or de-ficiency  required  for  an  insanity  defense,  with  the  medical 
concepts  of  mental  abnormality  that  influence  the  expert opinion  testimony  by  psychologists  and  psychiatrists  com-
monly introduced to support or contest insanity claims.  For medical  definitions  devised  to  justify  treatment,  like  legal 
ones  devised  to  excuse  from  conventional  criminal  responsi-bility,  are  subject  to  flux  and  disagreement.  See  infra,  at

rebounded,  at  which  point  he  must  serve  the  remainder  of  his  imposed 
sentence.  See, e. g., Alaska Stat. $ 12.47.050 (2004).

774-775;  cf.  Leland,  343  U. S.,  at  800-801  (no  due  process violation  for  adopting  the  M'Naghten  standard  rather  than 

the  irresistible-impulse  test  because  scientific  knowledge does  not  require  otherwise  and  choice  of  test  is  a  matter 
of  policy).  There  being  such  fodder  for  reasonable  debate about  what  the  cognate  legal  and  medical  tests  should  be, 
due process imposes no single  canonical  formulation of legal insanity.

Nor  does  Arizona's  abbreviation  of  the  M'Naghten  state-ment raise a proper claim that some constitutional minimum 

has  been  shortchanged.  Clark's  argument  of  course  as-sumes  that  Arizona's  former  statement  of  the  M'Naghten 
rule, with its express alternative of cognitive incapacity, was constitutionally  adequate  (as  we agree).  That  being  so,  the 
abbreviated rule is no less so, for cognitive incapacity is rele-vant  under  that  statement,  just  as  it  was  under  the  more 
extended  formulation,  and  evidence  going  to  cognitive  inca-pacity  has  the  same  significance  under  the  short  form  as  it 
had under the long. Though  Clark  is  correct  that  the  application  of  the  moral 
incapacity test (telling right from wrong) does not necessar-ily  require  evaluation  of  a  defendant's  cognitive  capacity  to 
appreciate the nature and quality of the acts charged against him,  see  Brief  for  Petitioner  46-47,  his  argument  fails  to 
recognize  that  cognitive  incapacity  is  itself  enough  to  dem-
onstrate  moral  incapacity.  Cognitive  incapacity,  in  other words,  is  a  sufficient  condition  for  establishing  a  defense  of 

insanity,  albeit  not  a  necessary  one.  As  a  defendant  can therefore make out moral incapacity by demonstrating cogni-
tive  incapacity,  evidence  bearing  on  whether  the  defendant knew  the  nature  and  quality  of  his  actions  is  both  relevant 
and  admissible.  In  practical  terms,  if  a  defendant  did  not know  what  he  was  doing  when  he  acted,  he  could  not  have 
known  that  he  was  performing  the  wrongful  act  charged  as

a crime.23  Indeed, when the two-part rule was still in effect, 
the  Supreme  Court  of  Arizona  held  that  a  jury  instruction 
on  insanity  containing  the  moral  incapacity  part  but  not  a 
full  recitation  of  the  cognitive  incapacity  part  was  fine,  as 
the  cognitive  incapacity  part  might  be  " `treated  as  adding 
nothing  to  the  requirement  that  the  accused  know  his  act 
was wrong.' "  State  v.  Chavez, 143  Ariz.  238, 239, 693  P. 2d 
893,  894  (1984)  (quoting  A.  Goldstein,  The  Insanity  Defense 
50 (1967)). 

The  Court  of  Appeals  of  Arizona  acknowledged  as  much 
in this case, too, see App. 350 ("It is difficult to imagine that 
a  defendant  who  did  not  appreciate  the  `nature  and  quality' 
of the act he committed would reasonably be able to perceive 
that  the  act  was  `wrong' "),  and  thus  aligned  itself  with  the 
long-accepted  understanding  that  the  cognitively  incapaci-
tated  are  a  subset  of  the  morally  incapacitated  within  the 
meaning of the standard M'Naghten rule, see, e. g., Goldstein, 
supra, at 51 ("In those situations where the accused does not 
know the nature and quality of his act, in the broad sense, he 
will not know that it was wrong, no matter what construction 
`wrong'  is  given");  1  W.  LaFave,  Substantive  Criminal  Law 

$ 7.2(b)(3), p. 536 (2d ed. 2003) ("Many courts feel that knowl-
edge of `the nature and quality of the act' is the mere equiva-
lent  of  the  ability  to  know  that  the  act  was  wrong"  (citing 
cases));  id.,  $ 7.2(b)(4),  at  537  ("If  the  defendant  does  not 
know the nature and quality of his act, then  quite obviously 
he  does  not  know  that  his  act  is  `wrong,'  and  this  is  true 
without  regard  to  the  interpretation  given  to  the  word 

23 He might, of course, have thought delusively he was doing something 
just  as  wrongful  as  the  act  charged  against  him,  but  this  is  not  the  test: 
he must have understood that he was committing the act charged and that 
it  was  wrongful,  see  Ariz.  Rev.  Stat.  Ann.  $ 13-502(A)  (West  2001) 
("A person may be found guilty except insane if at the time of the commis-
sion  of  the  criminal  act  the  person  was  afflicted  with  a  mental  disease

Clark,  indeed,  adopted  this  very  analysis  himself  in  the trial  court:  "[I]f  [Clark]  did  not  know  he  was  shooting  at  a 

police  officer,  or  believed  he  had  to  shoot  or  be  shot,  even though  his  belief was  not  based  in  reality, this  would  estab-
lish  that  he  did  not  know  what  he  was  doing  was  wrong." Record,  Doc.  374,  at  1.  The  trial  court  apparently  agreed, 
for the judge admitted Clark's evidence of cognitive incapac-ity  for  consideration  under  the  State's  moral  incapacity  for-
mulation.  And  Clark  can  point  to  no  evidence  bearing  on 

24 We think this logic holds true in the face of the usual rule of statutory 
construction of " ` "giv[ing] effect, if possible, to every clause and word of 
a statute," ' " Duncan v.  Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001) (quoting United 
States v.  Menasche, 348 U. S. 528, 538-539 (1955)); see also 2 J. Sutherland, 
Statutes and Statutory Construction $ 4705 (3d ed. 1943).  Insanity stand-
ards are formulated to guide the factfinder to determine the blameworthi-
ness  of  a  mentally  ill  defendant.  See,  e. g.,  Jones  v.  United  States,  463 
U. S.  354,  373,  n.  4  (1983)  (Brennan,  J.,  dissenting).  The  M'Naghten  test 
is a sequential test, first asking the factfinder to conduct the easier enquiry 
whether  a defendant  knew  the nature  and quality  of  his  actions.  If  not, 
the  defendant  is  to  be  considered  insane  and  there  is  no  need  to  pass  to 
the  harder  and  broader  enquiry  whether  the  defendant  knew  his  actions 
were  wrong.  And,  because,  owing  to  this  sequence,  the  factfinder  is  to 
ask whether a defendant lacks moral capacity only when he possesses cog-
nitive capacity, the only defendants who will be found to lack moral capac-
ity  are  those  possessing  cognitive  capacity.  Cf.  2  C.  Torcia,  Wharton's 
Criminal Law $ 101 (15th ed. 1994).  Though, before 1993, Arizona had in 
place  the  full  M'Naghten  test  with  this  sequential  enquiry,  see,  e. g., 
Schantz, 98 Ariz., at 207, 403 P. 2d, at 525, it would appear that the legisla-
ture eliminated  the  cognitive  capacity  part  not  to change  the  meaning of 
the  insanity  standard  but  to  implement  its  judgment  that  a  streamlined 
standard with only the moral capacity part would be easier for the jury to 
apply, see Arizona House  of Representatives, Judiciary Committee Notes 
3 (Mar. 18, 1993); 1 R. Gerber, Criminal Law of Arizona 502-6, 502-11 (2d 
ed.  1993  and  Supp.  2000).  This  is  corroborated  by  the  State's  choice  for 
many  years  against  revising  the  applicable  recommended  jury  instruc-
tion  (enumerating  the  complete  M'Naghten  test)  in  order  to  match  the 
amended statutory standard.  See 1 Gerber, supra, at 502-6 (2d ed. 1993 
and Supp. 2000).

insanity  that  was  excluded.  His  psychiatric  expert  and  a number  of  lay  witnesses  testified  to  his  delusions,  and  this 

evidence tended to support a description of Clark as lacking the  capacity  to  understand  that  the  police  officer  was  a 
human being.  There is no doubt that the trial judge consid-ered  the  evidence  as  going  to  an  issue  of  cognitive  capacity, 
for  in  finding  insanity  not  proven  he  said  that  Clark's  men-tal  illness  "did  not . . .  distort  his  perception  of  reality  so 
severely  that  he  did  not  know  his  actions  were  wrong," App. 334. 

We  are  satisfied  that  neither  in  theory  nor  in  practice  did Arizona's  1993  abridgment  of  the  insanity  formulation  de-
prive Clark of due process. 

III 
Clark's  second  claim  of  a  due  process  violation  challenges the  rule  adopted  by  the  Supreme  Court  of  Arizona  in  State 

v.  Mott, 187  Ariz. 536,  931  P. 2d 1046, cert.  denied, 520  U. S. 1234  (1997).  This  case  ruled  on  the  admissibility  of  testi-
mony from a psychologist offered to show that the defendant suffered  from  battered  women's  syndrome  and  therefore 
lacked  the  capacity  to  form  the  mens  rea  of  the  crime charged  against  her.  The  opinion  variously  referred  to  the 
testimony  in  issue  as  "psychological  testimony,"  187  Ariz., at 541,  931  P. 2d,  at  1051, and "expert  testimony," 

ibid.,  and implicitly  equated  it  with  "expert  psychiatric  evidence," 

id., at 540, 931 P. 2d, at 1050 (internal quotation marks omit-ted),  and  "psychiatric  testimony,"  id.,  at  541,  931  P.  2d,  at 
1051.25  The state court held that testimony of a professional psychologist or psychiatrist about a defendant's mental inca-
pacity owing to mental disease or defect was admissible, and could  be  considered,  only  for  its  bearing  on  an  insanity  de-
fense; such  evidence  could not  be  considered on  the  element

of  mens  rea,  that  is,  what  the  State  must  show  about  a  de-fendant's  mental  state  (such  as  intent  or  understanding)

A 
Understanding Clark's claim requires attention to the cat-egories  of  evidence  with  a  potential  bearing  on 

mens  rea. First, there is "observation evidence" in the everyday sense, 

testimony  from  those  who  observed  what  Clark  did  and heard  what  he  said;  this  category  would  also  include  testi-
mony that an expert witness might give about Clark's tend-ency to think in a certain way and his behavioral characteris-
tics.  This evidence  may support a professional diagnosis of mental disease and in any event is the kind of evidence that 
can  be  relevant  to  show  what  in  fact  was  on  Clark's  mind when  he  fired  the  gun.  Observation  evidence  in  the  record 
covers Clark's behavior at home and with friends, his expres-sions  of  belief  around  the  time  of  the  killing  that  "aliens" 
were inhabiting the bodies of local people (including govern-ment  agents),

27  his  driving  around  the  neighborhood  before 

the police arrived, and so on.  Contrary to the dissent's char-acterization, see 

post, at 782 (opinion of Kennedy,

Opinion of the Court 
vation  evidence  can  be  presented  by  either  lay  or  expert 
witnesses. 

Second,  there  is  "mental-disease  evidence"  in  the  form  of 
opinion testimony that Clark suffered from a mental disease 
with  features  described  by  the  witness.  As  was  true  here, 
this evidence characteristically but not always 28  comes from 
professional psychologists or psychiatrists who testify as ex-
pert  witnesses  and  base  their  opinions  in  part  on  examina-
tion  of  a  defendant,  usually  conducted  after  the  events  in 
question.  The  thrust  of  this  evidence  was  that,  based  on 
factual  reports,  professional  observations,  and  tests,  Clark 
was  psychotic  at  the  time  in  question,  with  a  condition  that 
fell within the category of schizophrenia. 

Third,  there  is  evidence  we  will  refer  to  as  "capacity  evi-
dence"  about  a  defendant's  capacity  for  cognition  and  moral 
judgment  (and  ultimately  also  his  capacity  to  form  mens 
rea).  This,  too,  is  opinion  evidence.  Here,  as  it  usually 
does,29  this  testimony  came  from  the  same  experts  and  con-
centrated  on  those  specific  details  of  the  mental  condition 
that  make  the  difference  between  sanity  and  insanity  under 
the  Arizona  definition.30  In  their  respective  testimony  on

Opinion of the Court 
these details the experts disagreed: the defense expert gave 
his  opinion  that  the  symptoms  or  effects  of  the  disease  in 
Clark's  case  included  inability  to  appreciate  the  nature  of 
his action  and to tell that  it was  wrong, whereas the  State's 
psychiatrist  was  of  the  view  that  Clark  was  a  schizophrenic 
who  was  still  sufficiently  able  to  appreciate  the  reality  of 
shooting  the  officer  and  to  know  that  it  was  wrong  to  do 
that.31 

A caveat about these categories is in order.  They attempt 
to  identify  different  kinds  of  testimony  offered  in  this  case 
in  terms  of  explicit  and  implicit  distinctions  made  in  Mott. 
What  we can  say about  these categories goes  to their cores, 
however,  not  their  margins.  Exact  limits  have  thus  not 
been  worked  out  in  any  Arizona  law  that  has  come  to  our 
attention, and in this case, neither the courts in their rulings 
nor  counsel  in  objections  invoked  or  required  precision  in 
applying  the  Mott  rule's  evidentiary  treatment,  as  we  ex-
plain below.  Necessarily, then, our own decision can address 
only  core  issues,  leaving  for  other  cases  any  due  process 
claims  that  may  be  raised  about  the  treatment  of  evidence 
whose categorization is subject to dispute. 

face  of  mental-disease  evidence,  Rule  704(b)  prohibits  an  expert  "from 
testifying that [the mental-disease evidence] does or does not prevent the 
defendant from appreciating the wrongfulness of his actions"). 

31 Arizona  permits  evidence  bearing  on  insanity  to  be  presented  by 

either lay  or expert witnesses.  See State  v.  Bay, 150 Ariz.  112, 116,  722 
P.  2d  280,  284  (1986).  According  to  Bay,  "[f]oundationally,  a  lay  witness 
must have had an opportunity to observe the past conduct and history of 
a defendant; the fact that he is a lay witness goes not to the admissibility 
of  the  testimony  but  rather  to  its  weight."  Ibid.  (citation  omitted);  see 
also State v.  Hughes, 193 Ariz. 72, 83, 969 P. 2d 1184, 1195 (1998).  In fact, 
a  defendant  can  theoretically  establish  insanity  solely  via  lay  testimony. 
See Bay, supra, at 116, 722 P. 2d, at 284.  But cf. State v.  McMurtrey, 136 
Ariz. 93,  100,  664 P. 2d  637, 644  (1983)  ("[I]t is  difficult to  imagine  how a 
defendant  could  place  his or  her sanity  in  issue  .  . . without  expert  testi-
mony as to the defendant's state of mind at the time of the crime").

760  CLARK  v.  ARIZONA 

Opinion of the Court 

B 
It is clear that Mott itself imposed no restriction on consid-ering  evidence  of  the  first  sort,  the  observation  evidence. 

We  read  the  Mott  restriction  to  apply,  rather,  to  evidence addressing  the  two  issues  in  testimony  that  characteristi-
cally comes only from psychologists or psychiatrists qualified to  give  opinions  as  expert  witnesses:  mental-disease  evi-
dence (whether at the time of the crime a defendant suffered from  a  mental  disease  or  defect,  such  as  schizophrenia)  and 
capacity evidence (whether the disease or defect left him in-capable  of  performing  or  experiencing  a  mental  process  de-
fined as necessary for sanity such as appreciating the nature and quality of his act and knowing that it was wrong). 

Mott  was  careful  to  distinguish  this  kind  of  opinion  evi-dence  from  observation  evidence  generally  and  even  from 
observation  evidence  that  an  expert  witness  might  offer, such  as  descriptions  of  a  defendant's  tendency  to  think  in  a 
certain  way  or  his  behavioral  characteristics;  the  Arizona court made it clear that this sort of testimony was perfectly 
admissible  to  rebut  the  prosecution's  evidence  of  mens  rea, 187 Ariz., at 544, 931 P. 2d, at 1054.  Thus, only opinion testi-
mony going to mental defect or disease, and its effect on the cognitive or moral capacities on which sanity depends under 
the Arizona rule, is restricted. In this case, the trial court seems to have applied the 

Mott restriction  to  all  evidence  offered  by  Clark  for  the  purpose 

of  showing  what  he called  his  inability to  form the  required mens  rea,  see,  e. g.,  Record,  Doc.  406,  at  7-10  (that  is,  an 
intent  to  kill  a  police  officer  on  duty,  or  an  understanding that  he  was  engaging  in  the  act  of  killing  such  an  officer, 
see Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 13-1105(A)(3) (West Supp. 2005)). Thus, the trial court's restriction may have covered not only 
mental-disease and capacity evidence as just defined, but also observation  evidence  offered  by  lay  (and  expert)  witnesses 
who  described  Clark's  unusual  behavior.  Clark's  objection to  the  application  of  the 

Mott  rule  does  not,  however,  turn

on  the  distinction  between  lay  and  expert  witnesses  or  the kinds of testimony they were competent to present.

32 

C 
There  is  some,  albeit  limited,  disagreement  between  the dissent  and  ourselves  about  the  scope  of  the  claim  of  error 

properly before us.  To start with matters of agreement, all Members  of  the  Court  agree  that  Clark's  general  attack  on 
the Mott rule covers its application in confining consideration of capacity evidence to the insanity defense. 

In practical terms, our agreement on issues presented ex-tends  to  a  second  point.

Opinion of the Court 
timony  based  on  observation  of  Clark  showing  that  he  had auditory hallucinations when he was driving around, or failed 

in  fact  to  appreciate objective reality when he  shot;  this  ob-jection  went  to  use  of  testimony  about  schizophrenics,  not 
about  Clark  in  particular.  While  we  might  dispute  how clearly  Clark  raised  this  objection,  we  have  no  doubt  that 
the  objection  falls  within  a  general  challenge  to  the  Mott rule;  we  understand  that 

Mott  is  meant  to  confine  to  the insanity defense any consideration of characteristic behavior 

associated  with  mental  disease,  see  187  Ariz.,  at  544,  931 P. 2d, at 1054 (contrasting State v.  Christensen, 129 Ariz. 32, 
628 P. 2d 580 (1981), and State v.  Gonzales, 140 Ariz. 349, 681 P.  2d  1368  (1984)).  We  will  therefore  assume  for  argument 
that  Clark  raised  this  claim,  as  we  consider  the  due  process challenge to the Mott rule. 

The point on which we disagree with the dissent, however, is this: did Clark apprise the Arizona courts that he believed 
the  trial  judge  had  erroneously  limited  the  consideration of  observation  evidence,  whether  from  lay  witnesses  like 
Clark's  mother  or  (possibly)  the  expert  witnesses  who  ob-served  him?  This  sort  of  evidence  was  not  covered  by  the 
Mott restriction, and confining it to the insanity issue would have  been  an  erroneous  application  of 

Mott  as  a  matter  of Arizona  law.  For  the  following  reasons  we  think  no  such 

objection  was  made  in  a  way  the  Arizona  courts  could  have understood  it,  and  that  no  such  issue  is  before  us  now.  We 
think  the  only  issue  properly  before  us  is  the  challenge  to Mott on due process grounds, comprising objections to limits 
on the use of mental-disease and capacity evidence. It is clear that the trial judge intended to apply Mott: 

"[R]ecognizing  that  much  of  the  evidence  that  [the  de-fense  is]  going  to  be  submitting,  in  fact  all  of  it,  as  far 
as I know . . . that has to do with the insanity could also arguably  be  made  along  the  lines  of  the  Mott  issues  as 
to  form  and  intent  and  his  capacity  for  the  intent.  I'm going to let you go ahead and get all that stuff in because

Opinion of the Court 
it  goes  to  the  insanity  issue  and  because  we're  not  in front of a jury.  At the end, I'll let you make an offer of 

proof  as  to  the  intent,  the  Mott  issues,  but  I  still  think the supreme court decision is the law of the land in this 
state."  App. 9. 
At  no  point  did  the  trial  judge  specify  any  particular  evi-dence  that  he  refused  to  consider  on  the 

mens  rea  issue. Nor did defense counsel specify any observation or other par-

ticular evidence that he claimed was admissible but wrongly excluded on the issue of mens rea, so as to produce a clearer 
ruling on what evidence was being restricted on the author-ity of Mott and what was not.  He  made no  "offer of proof " 
in  the  trial  court; 33  and  although  his  brief  in  the  Arizona Court  of  Appeals  stated  at  one  point  that  it  was  not  incon-
sistent  with  Mott to  consider  nonexpert  evidence  indicating mental illness on the issue of 

mens rea, and argued that the trial  judge  had  failed  to  do  so,  Appellant's  Opening  Brief  in 

No.  1CA-CR-03-0851  etc.,  pp.  48-49  (hereinafter  Appel-lant's Opening Brief), he was no more specific than that, see, 
e. g.,  id.,  at  52  ("The  Court's  ruling  in  Mott  and  the  trial court's  refusal  to  consider  whether  as  a  result  of  suffering 
from paranoid  schizophrenia [Clark]  could not  formulate  the mens rea necessary for first degree murder violated his right 
to  due  process").  Similarly,  we  read  the  Arizona  Court  of Appeals  to  have  done  nothing  more  than  rely  on 

Mott  to reject the claim that due process forbids restricting evidence 

bearing on "[a]bility to [f]orm [m]ens [r]ea," App. 351 (em-

the admissibility of mental-illness or capacity evidence as to mens rea, see

Opinion of the Court 
phasis  in  original),  (i. e.,  mental-disease  and  capacity  evi-dence)  to  the  insanity  determination.  See  id.,  at  351-353. 

This  failure  in  the  state  courts  to  raise  any  clear  claim about  observation  evidence,  see  Appellant's  Opening  Brief 
46-52, is reflected in the material addressed to us, see Brief for  Petitioner  13-32.  In  this  Court  both  the  question  pre-
sented  and  the  following  statement  of  his  position  were 
couched in similarly worded general terms: 

"I.  ERIC  WAS  DENIED  DUE  PROCESS  WHEN THE TRIAL COURT REFUSED TO CONSIDER EVIDENCE  OF  HIS  SEVERE  MENTAL  ILLNESS  IN DETERMINING FACTUALLY  WHETHER THE 
PROSECUTION  PROVED  THE  MENTAL  ELEMENTS OF THE CRIME CHARGED."  Id., at 13. 

But  as  his  counsel  made  certain  beyond  doubt  in  his  reply brief, 

"Eric's  Point  I  is  and  always  has  been  an  attack  on  the rule of 

State v.  Mott, which both courts below held appli-
cable and binding.  Mott announced a categorical `rejec-tion  of  the  use  of  psychological  testimony  to  challenge 

the  mens  rea  element  of  a  crime,'  and  upheld  this  rule against federal due process challenge."  Reply Brief for 
Petitioner 2 (citations omitted). 
This explanation is supported by other statements in Clark's 
briefs  in  both  the  State  Court  of  Appeals  and  this  Court, replete  with  the  consistently  maintained  claim  that  it  was 

error to limit evidence of mental illness and incapacity to its bearing  on  the  insanity  defense,  excluding  it  from  consider-
ation  on  the  element  of  mens  rea.  See,  e. g.,  Appellant's Opening Brief 46, 47, 51; Brief for Petitioner 11, 13, 16, 20-23. 

In  sum,  the  trial  court's  ruling,  with  its  uncertain  edges, may  have  restricted  observation  evidence  admissible  on 
mens  rea  to  the  insanity  defense  alone,  but  we  cannot  be

Opinion of the Court 
sure.34  But  because  a  due  process  challenge  to  such  a  re-
striction  of  observation  evidence  was,  by  our  measure,  nei-
ther  pressed  nor  passed  upon  in  the  Arizona  Court  of  Ap-
peals, we do not consider it.  See, e. g., Kentucky v.  Stincer, 
482  U. S.  730,  747,  n.  22  (1987);  Illinois  v.  Gates,  462  U. S. 
213, 217-224 (1983).  What we do know, and now consider, is 
Clark's  claim  that  Mott  denied  due  process  because  it  "pre-
clude[d]  Eric  from  contending  that  .  .  .  factual  inferences" 
of  the  "mental  states  which  were  necessary  elements  of  the 
crime  charged"  "should  not  be  drawn  because  the  behavior 
was  explainable,  instead,  as  a  manifestation  of  his  chronic 
paranoid  schizophrenia."  Brief  for  Petitioner  13  (emphasis 
in original).  We consider the claim, as Clark otherwise puts 
it,  that  "Arizona's  prohibition  of  `diminished  capacity'  evi-
dence by criminal defendants violates" due process, ibid. 

D 
Clark's  argument  that  the  Mott  rule  violates  the  Four-
teenth  Amendment  guarantee  of  due  process  turns  on  the 
application of the presumption of innocence in criminal cases, 
the  presumption  of  sanity,  and  the  principle  that  a  criminal 
defendant  is  entitled  to  present  relevant  and  favorable  evi-
dence on an element of the offense charged against him. 

34 We  therefore  have  no  reason  to  believe  that  the  courts  of  Arizona 
would have  failed to restrict  their application of Mott to  the professional 
testimony  the  Mott  opinion  was  stated  to  cover,  if  Clark's  counsel  had 
specified  any  observation  evidence  he  claimed  to  be  generally  admissible 
and  relevant  to  mens  rea.  Nothing  that  we  hold  here  is  authority  for 
restricting  a  factfinder's  consideration  of  observation  evidence  indicating 
state  of  mind  at  the  time  of  a  criminal  offense  (conventional  mens  rea 
evidence) as distinct from professional mental-disease or capacity evidence 
going  to  ability  to  form  a  certain  state  of  mind  during  a  period  that  in-
cludes the time of the offense charged.  And, of course, nothing held here 
prevents  Clark  from  raising  this  discrete  claim  when  the  case  returns  to 
the courts of Arizona, if consistent with the State's procedural rules.

Opinion of the Court 

1 
The  first  presumption  is  that  a  defendant  is  innocent  un-less  and  until  the  government  proves  beyond  a  reasonable 

doubt  each  element  of  the  offense  charged,  see  Patterson, 432  U. S.,  at  210-211; 

In  re  Winship,  397  U. S.  358,  361-364 (1970),  including  the  mental  element  or  mens  rea.  Before 

the last century, the mens rea required to be proven for par-ticular  offenses  was  often  described  in  general  terms  like 
"malice,"  see,  e. g.,  In  re  Eckart,  166  U. S.  481  (1897);  4  W. Blackstone,  Commentaries  *21  ("[A]n  unwarrantable  act 
without  a  vicious  will  is  no  crime  at  all"),  but  the  modern tendency  has  been  toward  more  specific  descriptions,  as 
shown  in  the  Arizona  statute  defining  the  murder  charged against  Clark:  the  State  had  to  prove  that  in  acting  to  kill 
the  victim,  Clark  intended  to  kill  a  law  enforcement  officer on duty or knew that the victim was such an officer on duty. 
See generally Gardner, The Mens Rea Enigma: Observations on the Role of Motive in the Criminal Law Past and Present, 
1993  Utah  L.  Rev.  635.  As  applied  to  mens  rea  (and  every other  element),  the  force  of  the  presumption  of  innocence  is 
measured by the force of the showing needed to overcome it, which is  proof beyond  a  reasonable  doubt that  a defendant's 
state  of  mind  was  in  fact  what  the  charge  states.  See Winship, supra, at 361-363. 

2 
The presumption of sanity is equally universal in some va-riety  or  other,  being  (at  least)  a  presumption  that  a  defend-

ant  has  the  capacity  to  form  the  mens  rea  necessary  for  a verdict  of  guilt  and  the  consequent  criminal  responsibility. 
See  Leland,  343  U. S.,  at  799;  Davis  v.  United  States,  160 U. S. 469, 486-487 (1895); M'Naghten's Case, 10 Cl. & Fin., at 
210, 8 Eng. Rep., at 722; see generally 1 LaFave, Substantive Criminal  Law  $ 8.3(a),  at  598-599,  and  n.  1.  This  presump-
tion dispenses  with a requirement on the government's part

Opinion of the Court 
to  include as  an  element  of every  criminal  charge an  allega-tion  that  the  defendant  had  such  a  capacity.

35  The  force  of 

this presumption, like the presumption of innocence, is meas-ured  by  the  quantum  of  evidence  necessary  to  overcome  it; 

unlike  the  presumption  of  innocence,  however,  the  force  of the  presumption  of  sanity  varies  across  the  many  state  and 
federal  jurisdictions,  and  prior law  has  recognized  consider-
able  leeway  on  the  part  of  the  legislative  branch  in  defin-ing the presumption's strength through the kind of evidence 

and  degree  of  persuasiveness  necessary  to  overcome  it,  see 
Fisher v.  United States, 328 U. S. 463, 466-476 (1946).36 

There  are  two  points  where  the  sanity  or  capacity  pre-sumption  may  be  placed  in  issue.  First,  a  State  may  allow 

a  defendant  to  introduce  (and  a  factfinder  to  consider)  evi-dence  of  mental  disease  or  incapacity  for  the  bearing  it  can 
have  on  the  government's  burden  to  show  mens  rea.  See, 
e. g., State v.  Perez, 882 A. 2d 574, 584 (R. I. 2005).37  In such 
States  the  evidence  showing  incapacity  to  form  the  guilty state  of  mind,  for  example,  qualifies  the  probative  force  of 

other evidence, which considered alone indicates that the de-
fendant  actually  formed  the  guilty  state  of  mind.  If  it  is shown that a defendant with mental disease thinks all blond 

people are robots, he could not have intended to kill a person when he shot a man with blond hair, even though he seemed 

35 A legislature is nonetheless free to require affirmative proof of sanity 
by  the  way  it  describes  a  criminal  offense,  see  Dixon  v.  United  States, 
ante, at 9-12. 

36 Although a desired evidentiary use is restricted, that is not equivalent 

to a Sandstrom presumption.  See Sandstrom v.  Montana, 442 U. S. 510, 
514-524  (1979)  (due  process  forbids  use  of  presumption  that  relieves  the 
prosecution of burden of proving mental state by inference of intent from 
an act). 

37 In  fact,  Oregon  had  this  scheme  in  place  when  we  decided  Leland  v. 

Oregon, 343 U. S. 790, 794-796 (1952).  We do not, however, read any part 
of Leland to require as a matter of due process that evidence of incapacity 
be considered to rebut the mens rea element of a crime.

768  CLARK  v.  ARIZONA 

Opinion of the Court 
to  act  like  a  man  shooting  another  man.38  In  jurisdictions that allow mental-disease and capacity evidence to be consid-

ered on par with any other relevant evidence when deciding whether the prosecution has proven mens rea beyond a rea-
sonable  doubt,  the  evidence  of  mental  disease  or  incapacity need  only  support  what  the  factfinder  regards  as  a  reason-
able  doubt  about  the  capacity  to  form  (or  the  actual  forma-tion  of)  the 

mens  rea,  in  order  to  require  acquittal  of  the charge.  Thus, in these States the strength of the presump-

tion of sanity is no greater than the strength of the evidence of abnormal mental state that the factfinder thinks is enough 
to raise a reasonable doubt. The  second  point  where  the  force  of  the  presumption  of 
sanity  may  be  tested  is  in  the  consideration  of  a  defense  of insanity raised by a defendant.  Insanity rules like M'Nagh-
ten and the variants discussed in Part II, supra, are attempts to  define,  or  at  least  to  indicate,  the  kinds  of  mental  differ-
ences  that  overcome  the  presumption  of  sanity  or  capacity and  therefore  excuse  a  defendant  from  customary  criminal 
responsibility,  see Jones  v.  United  States, 463  U. S. 354, 373, n. 4 (1983) (Brennan, J., dissenting); D. Hermann, The Insan-
ity Defense: Philosophical, Historical and Legal Perspectives 4  (1983)  ("A  central  significance  of  the  insanity  defense  .  .  . 

38 We  reject  the  State's  argument  that  mens  rea  and  insanity,  as  cur-
rently understood, are entirely distinguishable, so that mental-disease and 
capacity  evidence  relevant  to  insanity  is  simply  irrelevant  to  mens  rea. 
Not only does evidence accepted as showing insanity trump mens rea, but 
evidence of behavior close to the time of the act charged may indicate both 
the  actual  state  of  mind  at  that  time  and  also  an  enduring  incapacity  to 
form  the  criminal  state  of  mind  necessary  to  the  offense  charged.  See 
Brief for American Psychiatric Association et al. as Amici Curiae 12-13; 
Arenella,  The  Diminished  Capacity  and  Diminished  Responsibility  De-
fenses: Two Children of a Doomed Marriage, 77 Colum. L. Rev. 827, 834- 
835 (1977); cf. Powell v. Texas, 392 U. S. 514, 535-536 (1968) (plurality opin-
ion) (the "doctrines of actus reus, mens rea, insanity, mistake, justification, 
and  duress"  are  a  "collection  of  interlocking  and  overlapping  concepts 
which  the  common  law  has  utilized  to  assess  the  moral  accountability  of 
an individual for his antisocial deeds").

Opinion of the Court 
is  the  separation  of  nonblameworthy  from  blameworthy offenders"),  even  if  the  prosecution  has  otherwise  overcome 

the  presumption  of  innocence  by  convincing  the  factfinder of all the elements charged beyond a reasonable doubt.  The 
burden  that  must  be  carried  by  a  defendant  who  raises the  insanity  issue,  again,  defines  the  strength  of  the  san-
ity  presumption.  A  State  may  provide,  for  example,  that whenever  the  defendant  raises  a  claim  of  insanity  by  some 
quantum  of  credible  evidence,  the  presumption  disappears and the government must prove sanity to a specified degree 
of certainty (whether beyond reasonable doubt or something less).  See, 

e. g.,  Commonwealth  v.  Keita,  429  Mass.  843, 846, 712  N. E.  2d 65,  68  (1999).  Or  a jurisdiction  may  place 

the burden of persuasion on a defendant to prove insanity as the applicable law defines it, whether by a preponderance of 
the  evidence  or  to  some  more  convincing  degree,  see  Ariz. Rev.  Stat.  Ann.  $ 13-502(C)  (West  2001);  Leland,  343  U. S., 
at 798.  In any case, the defendant's burden defines the pre-sumption of sanity, whether that burden be to burst a bubble 
or to show something more. 

3 
The  third  principle  implicated  by  Clark's  argument  is  a defendant's  right  as  a  matter  of  simple  due  process  to  pre-

sent  evidence  favorable  to  himself  on  an  element  that  must be  proven  to  convict  him.

39  As  already  noted,  evidence 

tending to show that a defendant suffers from mental disease and lacks capacity to form mens rea is relevant to rebut evi-

dence  that  he  did  in  fact  form  the  required  mens  rea  at  the time in question; this is the reason that Clark claims a right 
to  require  the  factfinder  in  this  case  to  consider  testimony 

39 Clark's  argument  assumes  that  Arizona's  rule  is  a  rule  of  evidence, 
rather than a redefinition of mens rea, see Montana v.  Egelhoff, 518 U. S. 
37, 58-59 (1996) (Ginsburg,

about  his  mental  illness  and  his  incapacity  directly,  when weighing  the  persuasiveness  of  other  evidence  tending  to 

show  mens  rea,  which  the  prosecution  has  the  burden  to prove. 

As Clark recognizes, however, the right to introduce rele-vant  evidence  can  be  curtailed  if  there  is  a  good  reason  for 
doing that.  "While the Constitution . . . prohibits the exclu-
sion of defense evidence under rules that serve no legitimate purpose  or  that  are  disproportionate  to  the  ends  that  they 

are  asserted  to  promote,  well-established  rules  of  evidence permit trial judges to exclude evidence if its probative value 
is  outweighed  by  certain  other  factors  such  as  unfair  preju-
dice, confusion of the issues, or potential to mislead the jury." 
Holmes  v.  South  Carolina,  547  U. S.  319,  326  (2006);  see 
Crane v.  Kentucky, 476 U. S. 683, 689-690 (1986) (permitting 
exclusion  of  evidence  that  "poses  an  undue  risk  of  `harass-
ment, prejudice, [or] confusion of the issues' " (quoting Dela-
ware v.  Van Arsdall, 475 U. S. 673, 679 (1986))); see also Egel-
hoff,  518  U. S.  37;  Chambers  v.  Mississippi,  410  U. S.  284, 
302  (1973).  And  if  evidence  may  be  kept  out  entirely,  its 
consideration  may  be  subject  to  limitation,  which  Arizona 
claims  the  power  to  impose  here.  State  law  says  that  evi-
dence  of  mental  disease  and  incapacity  may  be  introduced 
and  considered,  and  if  sufficiently  forceful  to  satisfy  the  de-
fendant's  burden of  proof under  the  insanity  rule it  will dis-
place  the  presumption  of  sanity  and  excuse  from  criminal 
responsibility.  But  mental-disease  and  capacity  evidence 
may  be  considered  only  for  its  bearing  on  the  insanity  de-
fense,  and  it  will  avail  a  defendant  only  if  it  is  persuasive 
enough  to  satisfy  the  defendant's  burden  as  defined  by  the 
terms of that defense.  The mental-disease and capacity evi-
dence is  thus  being channeled  or restricted  to one  issue and 
given  effect only if  the defendant  carries  the burden to con-
vince the factfinder of insanity; the evidence is not being ex-
cluded  entirely,  and  the  question  is  whether  reasons  for  re-
quiring it to be channeled and restricted are good enough to

Opinion of the Court 
satisfy the standard of fundamental fairness that due process requires.  We think they are. 

E 

1 
The first  reason supporting  the  Mott rule is  Arizona's au-thority  to  define  its  presumption  of  sanity  (or  capacity  or 

responsibility)  by  choosing  an  insanity  definition,  as  dis-cussed  in  Part  II, 

supra,  and  by  placing  the  burden  of  per-suasion  on  defendants  who  claim  incapacity  as  an  excuse 

from  customary  criminal  responsibility.  No  one,  certainly not  Clark  here,  denies  that  a  State  may  place  a  burden  of 
persuasion  on  a  defendant  claiming  insanity,  see  Leland, 
supra,  at  797-799  (permitting  a  State,  consistent  with  due process, to require the defendant to bear this burden).  And 

Clark  presses  no  objection  to  Arizona's  decision  to  require persuasion  to  a  clear  and  convincing  degree  before  the  pre-
sumption  of  sanity  and  normal  responsibility  is  overcome. See Brief for Petitioner 18, n. 25. 

But  if  a  State  is  to  have  this  authority  in  practice  as  well as in theory, it must be able to deny a defendant the opportu-
nity  to displace  the  presumption of  sanity  more easily  when addressing  a  different  issue  in  the  course  of  the  criminal 
trial.  Yet,  as  we  have  explained,  just  such  an  opportunity would be available if expert testimony of mental disease and 
incapacity  could  be  considered  for  whatever  a  factfinder might think it was worth on the issue of 

mens rea.40  As we mentioned,  the  presumption of sanity  would then  be only  as 

strong  as  the  evidence  a  factfinder  would  accept  as  enough to  raise  a  reasonable  doubt  about  mens  rea  for  the  crime 
charged;  once  reasonable  doubt  was  found,  acquittal  would

Opinion of the Court 
be required, and the standards established for the defense of 
insanity would go by the boards. 

Now,  a  State  is  of  course  free  to  accept  such  a  possibility 
in its law.  After all, it is free to define the insanity defense 
by  treating  the  presumption  of  sanity  as  a  bursting  bubble, 
whose  disappearance  shifts  the  burden  to  the  prosecution 
to prove  sanity  whenever  a  defendant presents  any credible 
evidence of mental disease or incapacity.  In States with this 
kind  of  insanity  rule,  the  legislature  may  well  be  willing  to 
allow  such  evidence  to  be  considered  on  the  mens  rea  ele-
ment  for  whatever  the  factfinder  thinks  it  is  worth.  What 
counts  for  due  process,  however,  is  simply  that  a  State  that 
wishes  to  avoid  a  second  avenue  for  exploring  capacity,  less 
stringent for a defendant, has a good reason for confining the 
consideration of evidence of mental disease and incapacity to 
the insanity defense. 

It  is  obvious  that  Arizona's  Mott  rule  reflects  such  a 
choice.  The State Supreme Court pointed out that the State 
had  declined  to  adopt  a  defense  of  diminished  capacity 
(allowing  a  jury  to  decide  when  to  excuse  a  defendant  be-
cause  of  greater  than  normal  difficulty  in  conforming  to  the 
law).41  The court reasoned that the State's choice would be 
undercut  if  evidence  of  incapacity  could  be  considered  for 

41 Though the term "diminished capacity" has been given different mean-
ings, see, e. g., Morse, Undiminished Confusion in Diminished Capacity, 75 
J. Crim. L. & C. 1 (1984) ("The diminished capacity doctrine allows a crimi-
nal  defendant to introduce evidence of  mental  abnormality at trial  either 
to negate a mental element of the crime charged, thereby exonerating the 
defendant  of  that  charge,  or  to  reduce  the  degree  of  crime  for  which  the 
defendant  may  be  convicted,  even  if  the  defendant's  conduct  satisfied  all 
the  formal  elements  of  a  higher  offense"),  California,  a  jurisdiction  with 
which  the  concept  has  traditionally  been  associated,  understood  it  to  be 
simply  a  " `showing  that  the  defendant's  mental  capacity  was  reduced  by 
mental illness, mental defect or intoxication,' " People v.  Berry, 18 Cal. 3d

Ariz.,  at  541,  931  P.  2d,  at  1051.  In  other  words,  if  a  jury were free to decide how much evidence of mental disease and 
incapacity was enough to counter evidence of mens rea to the point of creating a reasonable doubt, that would in functional 
terms  be  analogous  to  allowing  jurors  to  decide  upon  some degree  of  diminished  capacity  to  obey  the  law,  a  degree  set 
by them, that would prevail as a stand-alone defense.42

A  State's  insistence  on  preserving  its  chosen  standard  of legal  insanity cannot be the  sole reason for a rule like  Mott,

impedes  him  from  using  mental-disease  and  capacity  evi-dence directly to rebut the prosecution's evidence that he did 

form mens rea. Are  there,  then,  characteristics  of  mental-disease  and  ca-
pacity  evidence  giving  rise  to  risks  that  may  reasonably  be hedged  by  channeling  the  consideration  of  such  evidence  to 
the insanity issue on which, in States like Arizona, a defend-
ant  has  the  burden  of  persuasion?  We  think  there  are:  in the controversial character of some categories of mental dis-

ease,  in  the  potential  of  mental-disease  evidence  to  mislead, and in  the  danger of according greater  certainty to capacity 
evidence than experts claim for it. 

To  begin  with,  the  diagnosis  may  mask  vigorous  debate 
within  the  profession  about the  very  contours of the  mental 
disease  itself.  See,  e. g.,  American  Psychiatric  Association, 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders xxxiii

American Psychiatric Association et al. as Amici Curiae 15, the consequence of this professional ferment is a general cau-
tion in treating psychological classifications as predicates for 
excusing otherwise criminal conduct. Next,  there  is  the  potential  of  mental-disease  evidence  to 

mislead  jurors  (when  they  are  the  factfinders)  through  the power  of  this  kind  of  evidence  to  suggest  that  a  defendant 
suffering  from  a  recognized  mental  disease  lacks  cognitive, moral,  volitional,  or  other  capacity,  when  that  may  not  be  a 
sound  conclusion  at  all.  Even  when  a  category  of  mental disease  is  broadly  accepted  and  the  assignment  of  a  defend-
ant's behavior to that category is uncontroversial, the classi-fication  may  suggest  something  very  significant  about  a  de-
fendant's capacity, when in fact the classification tells us little 
or  nothing  about  the  ability  of  the  defendant  to  form  mens 
rea  or  to  exercise  the  cognitive,  moral,  or  volitional  capac-
ities  that  define  legal  sanity.43  See  DSM-IV-TR  xxxii- 
xxxiii  ("When  the  DSM-IV  categories,  criteria,  and  textual 
descriptions  are  employed  for  forensic  purposes,  there  are 
significant  risks  that  diagnostic  information  will  be  misused 
or  misunderstood.  These  dangers  arise  because  of  the  im-
perfect  fit  between  the  questions  of  ultimate  concern  to  the 
law and the information contained in a clinical diagnosis.  In 
most  situations,  the  clinical  diagnosis  of  a  DSM-IV  mental

derstandings of capacity in no way undermines the assertion by the Amer-

Opinion of the Court 
purposes of . . . `mental diseas[e]' or `mental defect.'  In de-termining  whether  an  individual  meets  a  specified  legal 

standard (e. g., for . . . criminal responsibility . . . ), additional information is usually required beyond that contained in the 
DSM-IV  diagnosis").  The  limits  of  the  utility  of  a  profes-sional  disease  diagnosis  are  evident  in  the  dispute  between 
the two testifying experts in this case; they agree that Clark 
was schizophrenic,  but they come to  opposite  conclusions  on whether  the  mental  disease  in  his  particular  case  left  him 

bereft  of  cognitive  or  moral  capacity.  Evidence  of  mental disease, then, can easily mislead; it is very easy to slide from 
evidence  that  an individual  with  a  professionally recognized 
mental  disease  is  very  different,  into  doubting  that  he  has 
the  capacity  to  form  mens  rea,  whereas  that  doubt  may  not 
be  justified.  And  of  course,  in  the  cases  mentioned  before, 
in  which  the  categorization  is  doubtful  or  the  category  of 
mental  disease  is  itself  subject  to  controversy,  the  risks  are 
even greater that opinions about mental disease may confuse 
a  jury  into  thinking  the  opinions  show  more  than  they  do. 
Because  allowing  mental-disease  evidence  on  mens  rea  can 
thus  easily  mislead,  it  is  not  unreasonable  to  address  that 
tendency  by  confining  consideration  of  this  kind  of  evidence 
to insanity, on which a defendant may be assigned the burden 
of persuasion. 

There are, finally, particular risks inherent in the opinions 
of the experts who supplement the mental-disease classifica-
tions with opinions on incapacity: on whether the mental dis-
ease rendered  a particular defendant incapable  of the cogni-
tion necessary for moral judgment or mens rea or otherwise 
incapable  of  understanding  the  wrongfulness  of  the  conduct 
charged.  Unlike  observational  evidence  bearing  on  mens 
rea,  capacity  evidence  consists  of  judgment,  and  judgment 
fraught  with  multiple  perils:  a  defendant's  state  of  mind  at 
the  crucial  moment  can  be  elusive  no  matter  how  conscien-
tious the enquiry, and the law's categories that set the terms 
of the capacity judgment are not the categories of psychology

Opinion of the Court 
that  govern  the  expert's  professional  thinking.  Although such  capacity  judgments  may  be  given  in  the  utmost  good 

faith,  their  potentially  tenuous  character  is  indicated  by  the candor of the defense expert in this very case.  Contrary to 
the State's expert, he testified that Clark lacked the capacity to  appreciate  the  circumstances  realistically  and  to  under-
stand  the  wrongfulness  of  what  he  was  doing,  App.  48-49, 
but  he  said  that  "no  one  knows  exactly  what  was  on  [his] mind" at the time of the shooting, 

id., at 48.  And even when 
an  expert  is  confident  that  his  understanding  of  the  mind  is reliable,  judgment  addressing  the  basic  categories  of  capac-

ity  requires  a  leap  from  the  concepts  of  psychology,  which 
are devised for  thinking about  treatment, to the  concepts of 
legal  sanity,  which  are  devised  for  thinking  about  criminal 
responsibility.  See Insanity Defense Work Group, American 
Psychiatric  Association  Statement  on  the  Insanity  Defense, 
140 Am. J. Psychiatry 681, 686 (1983), reprinted in 2 The Role 
of Mental Illness in Criminal Trials 117, 122 (J. Moriarty ed. 
2001) ("The American Psychiatric Association is not opposed 
to legislatures restricting psychiatric testimony about the . . .  
ultimate  legal  issues  concerning  the  insanity  defense.  .  .  . 
When  .  .  .  `ultimate  issue'  questions  are  formulated  by  the 
law  and  put  to  the  expert  witness  who  must  then  say  `yea' 
or  `nay,'  then  the  expert  witness  is  required  to  make  a  leap 
in logic.  He no longer addresses himself to medical concepts 
but  instead  must  infer  or  intuit  what  is  in  fact  unspeakable, 
namely, the probable relationship between medical concepts 
and  legal  or  moral  constructs  such  as  free  will.  These  im-
permissible  leaps in logic  made by expert witnesses  confuse 
the  jury. . . . This  state  of  affairs  does  considerable  injustice 
to  psychiatry  and,  we  believe,  possibly  to  criminal  defend-
ants.  These  psychiatric  disagreements  .  .  .  cause  less  than 
fully understanding juries or the public to conclude that psy-
chiatrists  cannot  agree.  In  fact,  in  many  criminal  insanity 
trials  both  prosecution  and  defense  psychiatrists  do  agree 
about the nature and even the extent of mental disorder ex-

hibited  by  the  defendant  at  the  time  of  the  act"  (emphasis in  original;  footnote  omitted));  DSM-IV-TR  xxxii-xxxiii;  P. 

Giannelli  &  E.  Imwinkelried,  Scientific  Evidence  $ 9-3(B), p.  286  (1986)  ("[N]o  matter  how  the  test  for  insanity  is 
phrased,  a  psychiatrist  or  psychologist  is  no  more  qualified than  any  other  person  to  give  an  opinion  about  whether  a 
particular  defendant's  mental  condition  satisfies  the  legal test  for  insanity");  cf.  R.  Slovenko,  Psychiatry  and  Criminal 
Culpability 55 (1995) ("The scope of the DSM is wide-ranging and includes `conduct disorders' but `evil' is not mentioned"). 
In  sum,  these  empirical  and  conceptual  problems  add  up  to a real risk  that an expert's judgment in  giving  capacity evi-
dence  will  come  with  an  apparent  authority  that  psycholo-gists and psychiatrists do not claim to have.  We think that 
this  risk,  like  the  difficulty  in  assessing  the  significance  of mental-disease  evidence,  supports  the  State's  decision  to 
channel such expert testimony to consideration on the insan-ity  defense,  on  which  the  party  seeking  the  benefit  of  this 
evidence has the burden of persuasion. It bears repeating that not  every  State will  find  it worth-
while  to  make  the  judgment  Arizona  has  made,  and  the choices  the  States  do  make  about  dealing  with  the  risks 
posed  by  mental-disease  and  capacity  evidence  will  reflect their  varying  assessments  about  the  presumption  of  sanity 
as  expressed  in  choices  of  insanity  rules.44  The  point  here simply  is  that  Arizona  has  sensible  reasons  to  assign  the 
risks as it has done by channeling the evidence.45 

44 A State  in which  the burden  of persuasion  as to  a defendant's  sanity 
lies  with  the  prosecution  might  also  be  justified  in  restricting  mental-
disease and capacity evidence to insanity determinations owing to the po-
tential of mental-disease evidence to mislead and the risk of misjudgment 
inherent  in  capacity  evidence.  We  need  not,  in  the  context  of  this  case, 
address that issue. 

45 Arizona's  rule  is  supported  by  a  further  practical  reason,  though  not 

as weighty as those just considered.  As mentioned before, if substantial 
mental-disease and capacity evidence is accepted as rebutting mens rea in 
a  given  case,  the  affirmative  defense  of  insanity  will  probably  not  be
