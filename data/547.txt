2  TEXACO  INC.  v.  DAGHER 

Syllabus 
Congress  intended  to  outlaw  only  unreasonable  restraints,  e. g.,  State 
Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U. S. 3, 10.  Under rule of reason analysis, antitrust 
plaintiffs must demonstrate that a particular contract or combination is 
in fact unreasonable and anticompetitive.  See, e. g., id., at 10-19.  Per 
se  liability  is  reserved  for  "plainly  anticompetitive"  agreements.  Na-
tional  Soc.  of  Professional  Engineers  v.  United  States,  435  U. S.  679, 
692.  While "horizontal" price-fixing agreements between two or more 
competitors are per se unlawful, see, e. g., Catalano, supra, at 647, this 
litigation does not present such an agreement, because Texaco and Shell 
Oil did not compete with one another in the relevant market--i. e., gaso-
line  sales  to  western  service  stations--but  instead  participated  in  that 
market jointly through Equilon.  When those  who would  otherwise be 
competitors pool their capital and share the risks of loss and opportuni-
ties for profit, they are regarded as a single firm competing with other 
sellers in the market.  Arizona v.  Maricopa County Medical Soc., 457 
U. S. 332, 356.  As such, Equilon's pricing policy may be price fixing in 
a  literal  sense,  but  it  is  not  price  fixing  in  the  antitrust  sense.  The 
court  below  erred  in  reaching  the  opposite  conclusion  under  the  ancil-
lary  restraints  doctrine,  which  governs  the  validity  of  restrictions  im-
posed by a legitimate joint venture on nonventure activities.  That doc-
trine  has  no  application  here,  where  the  challenged  business  practice 
involves the  core activity of the joint venture itself--the pricing of the 
very goods produced and sold by Equilon.  Pp. 5-8. 

369 F. 3d 1108, reversed.

4  TEXACO  INC.  v.  DAGHER 

Opinion of the Court 
markets.  Their business activities include refining crude oil into  gasoline,  as  well  as  marketing  gasoline  to  downstream 

purchasers,  such  as  the  service  stations  represented  in  re-spondents' class action. 

In  1998,  Texaco  and  Shell  Oil  formed  a  joint  venture, Equilon,  to  consolidate  their  operations  in  the  western 
United States,  thereby  ending  competition  between the  two 
companies  in  the  domestic  refining  and  marketing  of  gaso-line.  Under  the  joint  venture  agreement,  Texaco  and  Shell 

Oil agreed to pool their resources and share the risks of and profits  from  Equilon's  activities.  Equilon's  board  of  direc-
tors would comprise representatives of Texaco and Shell Oil, 
and Equilon  gasoline  would be  sold to downstream  purchas-
ers  under  the  original  Texaco  and  Shell  Oil  brand  names. 
The  formation  of  Equilon  was  approved  by  consent  decree,

the  Federal  Trade  Commission,  see  In  re  Shell  Oil  Co.,  125 
F.  T.  C.  769  (1998),  as  well  as  by  the  state  attorneys  gen-
eral  of  California,  Hawaii,  Oregon,  and  Washington.  Nota-
bly,  the  decrees  imposed  no  restrictions  on  the  pricing  of 
Equilon gasoline. 

After  the  joint  venture  began  to  operate,  respondents 
brought suit in District Court, alleging that, by unifying gas-
oline  prices  under  the  two  brands,  petitioners  had  violated 
the  per  se  rule  against  price  fixing  that  this  Court  has  long 
recognized  under  $ 1  of  the  Sherman  Act,  ch.  647,  26  Stat. 
209, as amended, 15 U. S. C. $ 1.  See, e. g., Catalano, Inc. v. 
Target  Sales,  Inc.,  446  U. S.  643,  647  (1980)  (per  curiam). 
The  District  Court  awarded  summary  judgment  to  Texaco 
and Shell Oil.  It determined that the rule of reason, rather 
than  a  per  se  rule  or  the  quick  look  doctrine,  governs  re-
spondents' claim, and that, by eschewing rule of reason anal-
ysis,  respondents  had  failed  to  raise  a  triable  issue  of  fact. 
The Ninth Circuit reversed, characterizing petitioners' posi-
tion  as  a  request  for  an  "exception  to  the  per  se  prohibition 
on  price-fixing,"  and  rejecting  that  request.  Dagher  v.

certiorari  to  determine  the  extent  to  which  the  per  se  rule against price fixing applies to an important and increasingly

Section  1  of  the  Sherman  Act  prohibits  "[e]very  contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, 

in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States." 15  U. S. C.  $ 1.  This  Court  has  not  taken  a  literal  approach 
to this language, however.  See, e. g., State Oil Co. v.  Khan, 522 U. S. 3, 10 (1997) ("[T]his Court has long recognized that 
Congress  intended  to  outlaw  only  unreasonable  restraints" (emphasis  added)).  Instead,  this  Court  presumptively  ap-
plies rule of reason analysis, under which antitrust plaintiffs must  demonstrate  that  a  particular  contract  or  combination 
is  in  fact  unreasonable  and  anticompetitive  before  it  will  be found  unlawful.  See,  e. g.,  id.,  at  10-19.  Per  se  liability  is 
reserved for only those agreements that are "so plainly anti-competitive that no elaborate study of the industry is needed 
to establish their illegality."  National Soc. of Professional Engineers  v.  United  States,  435  U. S.  679,  692  (1978).  Ac-
cordingly,  "we  have  expressed  reluctance  to  adopt  per  se rules  .  .  .  `where  the  economic  impact  of  certain  practices  is 
not immediately obvious.' "  State Oil, supra, at 10 (quoting 
FTC  v.  Indiana  Federation  of  Dentists,  476  U. S.  447,  458- 459 (1986)). 

Price-fixing agreements between two or more competitors, otherwise  known  as  horizontal  price-fixing  agreements,  fall 
into  the  category  of  arrangements  that  are  per  se  unlawful. See,  e. g.,  Catalano,  supra,  at  647.  These  cases  do  not  pre-
sent such  an agreement, however, because  Texaco and Shell Oil  did  not  compete  with  one  another  in  the  relevant  mar-
ket--namely,  the  sale  of  gasoline  to  service  stations  in  the western  United  States--but  instead  participated  in  that

Opinion of the Court 
market  jointly  through  their  investments  in  Equilon.1  In other  words,  the  pricing  policy  challenged  here  amounts  to 

little  more  than  price  setting  by  a  single  entity--albeit within  the  context  of  a  joint  venture--and  not  a  pricing 
agreement  between  competing  entities  with  respect  to their  competing  products.  Throughout  Equilon's  existence, 
Texaco and Shell Oil shared in the profits of Equilon's activi-ties in  their role as investors,  not competitors.  When "per-
sons  who  would  otherwise  be  competitors  pool  their  capital and  share  the  risks  of  loss  as  well  as  the  opportunities  for 
profit . . . such joint ventures [are] regarded as a single firm competing  with  other  sellers  in  the  market." 

Arizona  v. Maricopa  County  Medical  Soc.,  457  U. S.  332,  356  (1982). 

As such, though  Equilon's pricing policy  may  be price  fixing in a literal sense, it is not price fixing in the antitrust sense. 
See  Broadcast  Music,  Inc.  v.  Columbia  Broadcasting  Sys-
tem,  Inc.,  441  U. S.  1,  9  (1979)  ("When  two  partners  set  the 
price  of  their  goods  or  services  they  are  literally  `price  fix-ing,'  but  they  are  not 

per  se  in  violation  of  the  Sherman 
Act"). 

This conclusion is confirmed by respondents' apparent con-cession  that  there  would  be  no 

per  se  liability  had  Equilon 
simply chosen to sell its gasoline under a single brand.  See Tr.  of  Oral  Arg.  34.  We  see  no  reason  to  treat  Equilon  dif-

ferently  just because  it chose to sell  gasoline under two dis-

1 We  presume for purposes of  these cases that Equilon is  a lawful  joint 
venture.  Its  formation  has  been  approved  by  federal  and  state  regula-
tors, and there is no contention here that it is a sham.  As the court below 
noted: "There is a voluminous record documenting the economic justifica-
tions  for  creating  the  joint  ventures.  [T]he  defendants  concluded  that 
numerous synergies and cost efficiencies would result" by creating Equilon 
as  well  as  a  parallel  venture,  Motiva  Enterprises,  in  the  eastern  United 
States,  and  "that  nationwide  there  would  be  up  to  $800  million  in  cost 
savings  annually."  369  F.  3d  1108,  1111  (CA9  2004).  Had  respondents 
challenged Equilon itself, they would have been required to show that its 
creation  was  anticompetitive  under  the  rule  of  reason.  See  Copperweld 
Corp.  v.  Independence Tube Corp., 467 U. S. 752, 768 (1984).

Opinion of the Court 
tinct  brands  at  a  single  price.  As  a  single  entity,  a  joint venture, like any other firm, must have the discretion to de-

termine the prices of the products that it sells, including the discretion  to  sell  a  product  under  two  different  brands  at  a 
single,  unified  price.  If  Equilon's  price  unification  policy  is anticompetitive,  then  respondents  should  have  challenged  it 
pursuant to the rule of reason.2  But it would be inconsistent with this Court's antitrust precedents to condemn the inter-
nal  pricing  decisions  of  a  legitimate  joint  venture  as  per  se unlawful.

3 

The court below reached the opposite conclusion by invok-ing  the  ancillary  restraints  doctrine.  369  F.  3d,  at  1118- 

1124.  That  doctrine  governs  the  validity  of  restrictions imposed  by  a  legitimate  business  collaboration,  such  as  a 
business  association  or  joint  venture,  on  nonventure  activi-ties.  See, 

e. g., National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v.  Board of  Regents  of  Univ.  of  Okla.,  468  U. S.  85,  113-115  (1984); 

Citizen  Publishing  Co.  v.  United  States,  394  U. S.  131,  135- 136  (1969).  Under  the  doctrine,  courts  must  determine 
whether  the  nonventure  restriction  is  a  naked  restraint  on trade,  and  thus  invalid,  or  one  that  is  ancillary  to  the  legiti-
mate  and  competitive  purposes  of  the  business  association, and thus valid.  We agree with petitioners that the ancillary 
restraints  doctrine  has  no  application  here,  where  the  busi-ness  practice  being  challenged  involves  the  core  activity  of 
the  joint  venture  itself--namely,  the  pricing  of  the  very 

2 Respondents  have  not  put forth  a  rule  of  reason  claim.  369  F. 3d,  at 
1113.  Accordingly, we need not address petitioners' alternative argument 
that $ 1 of the Sherman Act is inapplicable to joint ventures. 

3 Respondents alternatively contend that petitioners should be held lia-

ble under the quick look doctrine.  To be sure, we have applied the quick 
look doctrine to business activities that are so plainly anticompetitive that 
courts  need  undertake  only  a  cursory  examination  before  imposing  anti-
trust  liability.  See  California  Dental  Assn.  v.  FTC,  526  U. S.  756,  770 
(1999).  But for the same reasons that per se liability is unwarranted here, 
we  conclude  that  petitioners  cannot  be  held  liable  under  the  quick  look 
doctrine.

Opinion of the Court 
goods  produced  and  sold  by  Equilon.  And  even  if  we  were to invoke the doctrine in these cases, Equilon's pricing policy 

is  clearly  ancillary  to  the  sale  of  its  own  products.  Judge Fernandez, dissenting from the ruling of the court below, put 
it well: 

"In  this  case,  nothing  more  radical  is  afoot  than  the fact that an entity, which now owns all of the production, 

transportation,  research,  storage, sales  and  distribution facilities  for  engaging  in  the  gasoline  business,  also 
prices  its  own  products.  It  decided  to  price  them  the same,  as  any  other  entity  could.  What  could  be  more 
integral to the running of a business than setting a price for its goods and services?"  369 F. 3d, at 1127. 

See also Broadcast Music, supra, at 23 ("Joint ventures and other cooperative arrangements are . . . not usually unlawful, 
at least not as price-fixing schemes, where the agreement on price is necessary to market the product at all"). 

* * * 
Because the pricing decisions of a legitimate joint venture do not fall within the narrow category of activity that is per 

se unlawful under $ 1 of the Sherman Act, respondents' anti-trust claim cannot prevail.  Accordingly, the judgment of the 
Court of Appeals is reversed.  It is so ordered.

be reversed, the judgment that petitioners violated RICO must also be 
reversed,  id.,  at  411.  On  remand,  the  Court  of  Appeals  decided  that, 
because  this  Court  had  not  considered  respondents'  alternative  theory 
that  the  jury's  RICO  verdict  rested  not  only  on  extortion-related  con-
duct,  but  also  on  four  instances  (or  threats)  of  physical  violence  unre-
lated to extortion, the cases must be remanded to the District Court to 
determine  whether  these  four  acts  alone  might  constitute  Hobbs  Act 
violations  (sufficient,  as  predicate  acts  under  RICO,  to  support  the 
injunction). 

Held:  Physical violence unrelated to robbery or extortion falls outside the 

Hobbs  Act's  scope.  Congress  did  not  intend  to  create  a  freestanding 
physical  violence  offense.  It  did  intend  to  forbid  acts  or  threats  of 
physical violence in furtherance of a plan or purpose to engage in what 
the Act refers to as robbery or extortion (and related attempts or con-
spiracies).  Pp. 16-23. 

(a)  The more restrictive reading of the statutory text--the one tying 
the  prohibited  violence  to  robbery  or  extortion--is  correct.  For  one 
thing, it  is the  more  natural  reading.  The text preceding the physical 
violence clause does not forbid obstructing, delaying, or affecting com-
merce;  rather,  it  forbids  obstructing,  delaying,  or  affecting  commerce 
"by  robbery  or  extortion."  $ 1951(a)  (emphasis  added).  This  means 
that behavior that obstructs, delays, or affects commerce is a "violation" 
of  the  statute  only  if  it  also  involves  robbery  or  extortion  (or  related 
attempts or conspiracies).  Consequently, the reference  in  the physical 
violence clause to actions or threats of violence "in furtherance of a plan 
or  purpose  to  do anything in  violation  of  this  section"  seems to  mean 
acts or threats of violence in furtherance of a plan or purpose to engage 
in  robbery  or  extortion,  for  that  is  the  only  kind  of  behavior  that  the 
section otherwise makes a violation.  This restrictive reading is further 
supported by the fact that Congress often intends such statutory terms 
as "affect commerce" or "in  commerce" to be  read as terms  of art  con-
necting  the  congressional  exercise  of  legislative  authority  with  the 
constitutional provision (here, the Commerce Clause) granting that au-
thority.  See, e. g., Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v.  Dobson, 513 U. S. 265, 
273.  Such  jurisdictional  language  may  limit,  but  it  will  not  primarily 
define,  the  behavior  that  the  statute  calls  a  "violation"  of  federal  law. 
Cf.  Jones  v.  United  States,  529  U. S.  848,  854.  Moreover,  the  statute's 
history supports  the  more restrictive reading:  Both  of  the Hobbs  Act's 
predecessor statutes made clear that the physical violence they prohib-
ited  was  not  violence  in  furtherance  of  a  plan  to  injure  commerce,  but 
violence  in  furtherance  of  a  plan  to  injure  commerce  through  coercion 
or extortion (1934 Act) or through extortion or robbery (1946 Act).  The

Hobbs  Act's  legislative  history  contains nothing  to  the  contrary.  That 
the present statutory  language  is less clear than the 1946 version does 
not reflect a congressional effort to redefine the crime.  To the contrary, 
Congress revised the Act's language in 1948 as part of its general revi-
sion of the Criminal Code, which "was not intended to create new crimes 
but  to  recodify  those  then  in  existence."  Morissette  v.  United  States, 
342  U. S.  246,  269,  n.  28.  The  Court  will  not  presume  the  revision 
worked  a  change  in  the  underlying  substantive  law  absent  a  clearly 
expressed intent to do so.  Keene Corp. v.  United States, 508 U. S. 200, 
209.  Here  there  is  no  evidence  of  any  such  intent.  Finally,  respond-
ents'  interpretation  broadens  the  Hobbs  Act's  scope  well  beyond  what 
case  law  has  assumed.  It  would  federalize  much  ordinary  criminal 
behavior,  ranging  from  simple  assault  to  murder,  that  typically  is  the 
subject of state, not federal, prosecution.  Congress did not intend the 
Hobbs Act to have so broad a reach.  See, e. g., NOW II, supra, at 405. 
Other Courts of Appeals have rejected respondents' construction of the 
Act.  And  in  1994,  Congress  enacted  the  Freedom  of  Access  to  Clinic 
Entrances  Act,  18  U. S. C.  $ 248(a)(3),  which  was  aimed  specifically  at 
the  type  of  activity  at  issue  in  this  litigation,  thereby  suggesting  that 
Congress  did  not  believe  that  the  Hobbs  Act  already  addressed  that 
activity.  Pp. 16-21. 

(b)  Respondents'  reliance  on  the  canon  of  statutory  construction  fa-
voring  interpretations  that  give  a  function  to  each  word  in  a  statute, 
thereby  avoiding  linguistic  superfluity,  is  misplaced.  They  claim  that, 
because  the  definitions  of  robbery  or  extortion  (or  related  attempts  or 
conspiracies)  already  encompass  robbery  or  extortion  that  take  place 
through  acts  of  violence  (or  related  threats),  see  $$ 1951(b)(1)  and  (2), 
there  would  be  no  reason  for  $ 1951(a)  to  contain  its  physical  violence 
clause unless Congress intended to create a freestanding offense.  Peti-
tioners, however, have found a small amount of additional work for the 
clause to do.  The Scheidler petitioners point to a hypothetical mobster 
who threatens violence and demands payment from a business.  Those 
threats constitute  attempted  extortion; but  the subsequent acts of  vio-
lence  against  a  noncomplying  business  by  the  mobster's  subordinates 
might not constitute attempted extortion or be punishable as a conspir-
acy to commit extortion if the subordinates were not privy to the mob-
ster's plan, absent the specific prohibition of physical violence in further-
ance  of  a  plan  to  commit  extortion.  The  Government  adds  that  the 
clause  permits prosecutors to  bring multiple  charges for the same  con-
duct;  e. g.,  a  robber  who  injured  bystanders  could  be  charged  with  the 
separate Hobbs Act crimes of robbery and of using violence in further-
ance  of  the  robbery.  While  this  additional  work  is  concededly  small, 
Congress'  intent  is  clear.  Interpretive  canons  are  designed  to  help

former,  more  restrictive  reading  of  the  Act  is  the  correct interpretation. 

I 
Petitioners are individuals (and organizations) who engage in pro-life, anti-abortion protest activities.  Respondents are 

health  care  clinics  that  perform  abortions  and  a  pro-choice national nonprofit organization that supports the legal avail-
ability  of  abortions.  In  1986,  (pro-choice)  respondents,  be-lieving  that  (pro-life)  petitioners  had  tried  to  disrupt  activi-
ties  at  health  care  clinics  that  perform  abortions  through violence  and  various  other  unlawful  activities,  brought  this 
legal action, which sought damages and an injunction forbid-ding  (pro-life)  petitioners  from  engaging  in  such  activities 
anywhere in the Nation. Respondents based their legal claims upon the Hobbs Act, 
certain  other  laws  that  forbid  extortion,  and  a  federal  anti-racketeering  statute,  the  Racketeer  Influenced  and  Corrupt 
Organizations  Act  (RICO),  18  U. S. C.  $ 1962.  Respondents argued  that  petitioners'  clinic-related  protest  activities 
amounted  in  context  to  extortion.  They  added  that  these extortionate  acts  created  a  "pattern  of  racketeering  activ-
ity"--a pattern that RICO defines in terms of certain predi-cate  acts  that  include  acts of  extortion.  See  $ 1961(1)  (2000 
ed.,  Supp.  III).  And  they  sought  a  permanent  injunction, which  they  believed  RICO  authorized.  See  $ 1964  (2000 
ed.). Initially, the District Court dismissed their complaint.  It 
concluded that RICO requires proof that the alleged criminal acts  were  motivated  by  an  economic  purpose--a  purpose 
that  is  lacking  here.  National  Organization  for  Women, 
Inc. v.  Scheidler, 765 F. Supp. 937 (ND Ill. 1991).  The Court of  Appeals  for  the  Seventh  Circuit  affirmed.  National  Or-

ganization for Women, Inc. v.  Scheidler, 968 F. 2d 612 (1992). But  this  Court  held  that  the  statute  "requires  no  such  eco-
nomic motive," and therefore reversed the Court of Appeals and  remanded  the  case  for  further  proceedings.

After  trial,  the  jury  found  that  petitioners  had  engaged 
in  a  host  of  extortionate,  or  extortion-related,  acts.  It 
awarded treble damages to two of the respondents (a matter 
not  at  issue  here),  and  the  District  Court  entered  a  nation-
wide  injunction.  See $$ 1964(a), (c).  The Court of Appeals 
affirmed.  267 F. 3d 687 (2001). 

This  Court  again  reversed.  Scheidler  v.  National  Orga-
nization  for  Women,  Inc.,  537  U. S.  393  (2003)  (NOW  II). 
We noted that the Hobbs Act defines "extortion" as necessar-
ily  including  the  improper  " `obtaining  of  property  from  an-
other.' "  Id.,  at  400  (quoting  $ 1951(b)(2)).  We  pointed  out 
that the claimed "property" consisted of "a woman's right to 
seek  medical  services  from  a  clinic, the  right  of  the  doctors, 
nurses  or  other  clinic  staff  to  perform  their  jobs,  and  the 
right  of  the  clinics  to  provide  medical  services  free  from 
wrongful  threats,  violence,  coercion  and  fear."  Id.,  at  400- 
401  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  We  decided  that 
"[w]hatever the outer boundaries may be, the effort to char-
acterize petitioners' actions here as an `obtaining of property 
from'  respondents  is  well  beyond  them."  Id.,  at  402.  Ac-
cordingly,  we  held  that  "because  they  did  not  `obtain'  prop-
erty  from  respondents,"  petitioners  "did  not  commit  extor-
tion"  as  defined  by  the  Hobbs  Act.  Id.,  at  397.  We  found 
that  the  state  extortion  law  violations,  and  other  extortion-
related violations, were flawed for the same reason and must 
also be set aside.  Id., at 410. 

Our opinion concluded: 

"Because  all  of  the  predicate  acts  supporting  the  jury's 
finding of a RICO violation must be  reversed, the judg-
ment  that  petitioners  violated  RICO  must  also  be  re-
versed.  Without an underlying RICO violation, the in-
junction  issued  by  the  District  Court  must  necessarily 
be vacated."  Id., at 411.

Opinion of the Court 

On remand, the Court of Appeals did not order the District Court to terminate the cases or to vacate its injunction.  In-

stead,  the  Court  of  Appeals  considered  respondents'  argu-ment that the jury's RICO verdict rested not only upon many 
instances of extortion-related conduct, but also upon four in-stances  (or  threats)  of  physical  violence  unrelated  to  extor-
tion.  91 Fed. Appx. 510, 512 (2004).  The Court of Appeals decided that the parties had not presented this theory to this 
Court  and,  as  a  result,  we  had  no  occasion  to  consider whether  these  four  acts  alone  might  constitute  Hobbs  Act 
violations  (sufficient,  as  predicate  acts  under  RICO,  to  sup-port the nationwide injunction).  See 

id., at 513.  The Court of Appeals remanded the cases to the District Court to make 

that determination.  Ibid. Petitioners  sought  certiorari  to  review  this  ruling.  We 
granted  the  writ  to  consider  the  following  three  questions: 

(1)  Whether  the  Court  of  Appeals  improperly  disre-garded this Court's mandate in 

NOW II by holding that the  injunction  issued  by  the  District  Court  might  not 

need to be vacated; (2)  Whether  the  Hobbs  Act  forbids  violent  conduct 
unrelated to extortion or robbery; and (3)  Whether  RICO  authorizes  a  private  party  to  ob-
tain an injunction. 
We now answer the second question.  We hold that physical violence  unrelated  to  robbery  or  extortion  falls  outside  the 

scope of the Hobbs Act.  And since our answer to the second question requires an entry of judgment in petitioners' favor, 
we shall not answer the first or third questions.

modity  in  commerce,  by  robbery  or  extortion  or  at-tempts  or  conspires  so  to  do,  or  commits  or  threatens 

physical  violence  to  any  person  or  property  in  further-ance  of  a  plan  or  purpose  to  do  anything  in  violation 
of  this  section  .  .  .  ."  18  U. S. C.  $ 1951(a)  (emphasis added). 

The  question,  as  we  have  said,  concerns  the  meaning  of the  phrase  that  modifies  the  term  "physical  violence," 
namely, the words "in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section."  Do those words refer 
to  violence  (1)  that  furthers  a  plan  or  purpose  to  "affec[t] commerce . . . by  robbery  or  extortion,"  or  to  violence 
(2)  that  furthers  a  plan  or  purpose  simply  to  "affec[t]  com-merce"?  We  believe  the  former,  more  restrictive,  reading 
of the text--the reading that ties the violence to robbery or extortion--is correct. 

For one thing, the language of the statute makes the more restrictive reading the more natural one.  The text that pre-
cedes  the  physical  violence  clause  does  not  forbid  obstruct-
ing,  delaying,  or  affecting  commerce  (or  the  movement  of any article or commodity in commerce); rather, it forbids ob-

structing,  delaying,  or  affecting  commerce  "by  robbery  or extortion."  Ibid.  (emphasis  added).  This  language  means 
that  behavior  that  obstructs,  delays,  or  affects  commerce  is a "violation" of the statute only if that behavior also involves 
robbery  or  extortion  (or  related  attempts  or  conspiracies). Consequently,  the  reference  in  the  physical  violence  clause 
to actions  or  threats of violence "in  furtherance  of a  plan or purpose 

to do anything in violation of this section" (empha-sis  added)  would  seem  to  mean  acts  or  threats  of  violence 

in  furtherance  of  a  plan  or  purpose  to  engage  in  robbery or  extortion,  for  that  is  the  only  kind  of  behavior  that  the 
section otherwise makes a violation. This  restrictive  reading  is  further  supported  by  the  fact 
that  Congress  often  intends  such  statutory  terms  as  "affect commerce" or "in commerce" to be read as terms of art con-

Opinion of the Court 

necting  the  congressional  exercise  of  legislative  authority with the  constituti onal  provision (here, the  Commerce 

Clause)  that  grants  Congress  that  authority.  See  AlliedBruce  Terminix  Cos.  v.  Dobson,  513  U. S.  265,  273  (1995); 
Russell v.  United States, 471 U. S. 858, 859 (1985).  Such ju-risdictional language may limit, but it will not primarily de-

fine,  the  behavior  that  the  statute  calls  a  "violation"  of  fed-
eral law.  Cf. Jones v.  United States, 529 U. S. 848, 854 (2000) (holding  that  by  using  the  term  "affecting . . .  commerce," 

" `Congress did not define the crime described in [18 U. S. C.] $ 844(i)  as  the  explosion  of  a  building  whose  damage  or  de-
struction  might  affect  interstate  commerce,' "  and  noting 
that  the  Court  must  look  to  other  "qualifying  language"  in 
the provision to define the offense). 

For another thing, the statute's history supports the more 
restrictive reading.  Congress enacted the  Hobbs Act's 
predecessor in 1934.  See Anti-Racketeering Act, ch. 569, 48 
Stat.  979  (reproduced  in  Appendix  A,  infra).  That  prede-
cessor  Act  prohibited  coercion  and  extortion  appropriately 
connected with interstate commerce, and placed these prohi-
bitions  in  $$ 2(a)  and  2(b),  respectively.  48  Stat.  980.  The 
Act  went  on  in  $ 2(c)  to  impose  criminal  liability  on  anyone 
who,  in  connection  with  interstate  commerce,  "[c]ommits  or 
threatens  to  commit  an  act  of  physical  violence  or  physical 
injury  to  a  person  or  property  in  furtherance  of  a  plan  or 
purpose to violate sections (a) or (b)."  Ibid.; see also NOW 
II,  537  U. S.,  at  407.  The  1934  Act  explicitly  linked  $ 2(c), 
the  physical  violence  subsection,  with  $$ 2(a)  and  2(b).  It 
thereby made crystal clear that the physical violence that it 
prohibited was not violence in furtherance of a plan to injure 
commerce,  but  violence  in  furtherance  of  a  plan  to  injure 
commerce through coercion or extortion. 

In  1946,  Congress  enacted  a  superseding  law,  namely,  the 
Hobbs  Act.  Ch.  537,  60  Stat.  420  (reproduced  in  Appendix 
B,  infra).  The  new  law  changed  the  old  law  in  two  signifi-
cant  respects:  It  added  robbery  while  omitting  coercion.

between  physical  violence  and  other  crimes  (now  extortion 
and robbery). The 1946 Hobbs Act reads as follows: 

"Sec.

movement  of  any article  or  commodity  in  commerce  by  rob-bery  or  extortion 

as  defined  in  the  bill.' "   Culbert,  supra, 
at  377  (quoting  H.  R.  Rep.  No.  238,  79th  Cong.,  1st  Sess.,  9 (1945);  emphasis  added  in 

Culbert);  see  Culbert,  supra,  at 
376-378 (discussing legislative history).  They nowhere sug-gested  that  Congress  intended  to  make  physical  violence  a 

freestanding crime. 

The present Hobbs Act language is less clear than the 1946 version.  But the linguistic changes do not reflect a congres-

sional  effort  to  redefine  the  crime.  To  the  contrary,  Con-gress revised the Hobbs Act's language in 1948 as part of its 
general revision of the Criminal Code.  That "1948 Revision 
was not intended to create new crimes but to recodify those 
then  in  existence."  Morissette  v.  United  States,  342  U. S. 
246,  269,  n.  28  (1952).  This  Court  has  written  that  it  will 
"not  presume  that  the  revision  worked  a  change  in  the  un-
derlying  substantive  law  `unless  an  intent  to  make  such  [a] 
chang[e]  is  clearly  expressed.' "  Keene  Corp.  v.  United 
States, 508 U. S. 200, 209 (1993) (quoting Fourco Glass Co. v. 
Transmirra Products Corp., 353  U. S.  222,  227  (1957);  alter-
ation made in Keene).  And here there is no evidence of any 
such  intent.  Rather,  the  Reviser's  Notes  indicate  that  the 
linguistic  changes  to  the  Hobbs  Act  simply  amount  to 
"changes in phraseology and arrangement necessary to effect 
consolidation."  H.  R.  Rep.  No.  304,  80th  Cong.,  1st  Sess., 
A131 (1947). 

Finally,  respondents'  Hobbs  Act  interpretation  broadens 
the Act's scope well beyond what case law has assumed.  It 
would  federalize  much  ordinary  criminal  behavior,  ranging 
from simple assault to murder, behavior that typically is the 
subject  of  state,  not  federal,  prosecution.  Decisions  of  this 
Court have assumed that Congress did not intend the Hobbs 
Act  to  have  so  broad  a  reach.  See  NOW  II,  537  U. S.,  at 
405  (noting  that  the  Hobbs  Act  embodied  extortion,  which 
required  the  obtaining  of  property,  not  coercion);  id.,  at  411

by  the  Hobbs  Act,  "more  accurately  describes  the  nature  of petitioners'  [non-property-related]  actions"  (internal  quota-

tion marks omitted)); United States v.  Enmons, 410 U. S. 396, 410  (1973)  (Hobbs  Act  does  not  reach  violent  activity  by 
union members seeking higher wages  because such  violence is  not  extortion  and  Congress  did  not  intend  to  "cover  all 
overtly  coercive  conduct  in  the  course  of "  a  labor  dispute). Not  surprisingly,  other  Courts  of  Appeals  that  have  con-
sidered the question have rejected respondents' construction of the Act.  See 

United States v.  Yankowski, 184 F. 3d 1071 (CA9 1999); United States v.  Franks, 511 F. 2d 25 (CA6 1975). 

And  in  1994,  Congress  enacted  a  specific  statute  aimed  di-rectly at the type of abortion clinic violence and other activ-
ity  at  issue  in  this  litigation,  thereby  suggesting  it  did  not believe  that  the  Hobbs  Act  already  addressed  that  activity. 
See  Freedom  of  Access  to  Clinic  Entrances  Act,  18  U. S. C. $ 248(a)(3) (imposing criminal liability on anyone who "inten-
tionally  damages  or  destroys  the  property  of  a  facility,  or attempts  to  do  so,  because  such  facility  provides  reproduc-
tive health services").  III 

Respondents' contrary claim rests  primarily upon a canon of  statutory  construction  that  favors  interpretations  that 
give  a  function  to  each  word  in  a  statute,  thereby  avoiding linguistic  superfluity.  See 

United  States  v.  Menasche,  348 U. S.  528,  538-539  (1955)  ("It  is  our  duty  `to  give  effect,  if 

possible,  to  every  clause  and  word  of  a  statute' "  (quoting Montclair  v.  Ramsdell,  107  U. S.  147,  152  (1883))).  They 
claim that, because the definitions of robbery or extortion (or related attempts or conspiracies) already encompass robbery 
or extortion that takes place through acts of violence (or re-lated threats), "[t]here would be no reason for the statute to 
include  the  clause  prohibiting  violence  and  threats  of  vio-lence" unless  Congress intended to create  a freestanding of-
fense.  Brief for Respondents 25;  see 18 U. S. C. $ 1951(b)(1) (defining  "robbery"  as  the  "unlawful  taking  or  obtaining  of

personal  property  .  .  .  by  means  of  actual  or  threatened 
force,  or  violence"  (emphasis  added));  $ 1951(b)(2)  (defining 
"extortion"  as  "the  obtaining  of  property  from  another . . .  
by  wrongful  use  of  actual  or  threatened  force,  violence,  or 
fear" (emphasis added)). 

Petitioners,  however,  have  found  a  small  amount  of  addi-
tional  work  for  the  words  to  do.  Brief  for  Petitioners  in 
No.  04-1244,  pp.  33-36;  see  also  Brief  for  United  States  as 
Amicus Curiae 11-12.  The Scheidler petitioners point to a 
hypothetical  mobster  who  threatens  violence  and  demands 
payment  from  a  business.  Those  threats  constitute  at-
tempted  extortion;  but  the  subsequent  acts  of  violence 
against a noncomplying business by the subordinates of that 
mobster may not constitute attempted extortion and may not 
be punishable as a conspiracy to commit extortion if the sub-
ordinates  were  not  privy  to  the  mobster's  plan.  A  specific 
prohibition  of  physical  violence  in  furtherance  of  a  plan  to 
commit  extortion  would  bring  the  subordinates'  behavior 
within the statute's coverage.  The United States adds that 
the  physical  violence  clause  permits  prosecutors  to  bring 
multiple  charges  for  the  same  conduct.  For  instance,  the 
clause  would  apply  to  a  defendant  who  injured  bystanders 
during a robbery, permitting the Government to charge that 
defendant with the Hobbs Act crime of robbery and the sepa-
rate Hobbs Act crime of using violence in furtherance of the 
robbery.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 22. 

We  concede  that  this  additional  work  is  small.  But  the 
need for language to cover such instances, or perhaps simply 
a  desire  to  emphasize  the  problem  of  violence,  led  Congress 
in  the  original  1946  version  of  the  Hobbs  Act  to  make  clear 
that the statute prohibited, not all physical violence, but only 
physical  violence  in  furtherance  of  a  plan  or  purpose  to  en-
gage  in  robbery  or  extortion.  See  supra,  at  19.  And  it 
is  similarly  clear  that  Congress  intended  to  carry  this  view 
forward  into  the  1948  recodification.  See  supra,  at  20-21.

Appendix A to opinion of the Court 
The  canons  of  interpretation  cannot  lead  us  to  a  contrary 
conclusion.  Those  canons  are  tools  designed  to  help  courts 
better determine what Congress intended, not to lead courts 
to interpret the law contrary to that intent.  Chickasaw Na-
tion v.  United States, 534 U. S. 84, 94 (2001) (noting that "can-
ons  are  not  mandatory  rules"  but  guides  "designed  to  help 
judges  determine  the  Legislature's  intent,"  and  that  "other 
circumstances evidencing congressional intent can overcome 
their force"). 

IV 

We conclude that Congress did not intend to create a free-
standing physical violence  offense in  the  Hobbs Act.  It did 
intend  to  forbid  acts  or  threats  of  physical  violence  in  fur-
therance  of  a plan  or  purpose  to  engage  in  what  the  statute 
refers  to  as  robbery  or  extortion  (and  related  attempts  or 
conspiracies).  The  judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeals  is  re-
versed,  and  the  cases  are  remanded  for  entry  of  judgment 
for petitioners. 

It is so ordered.

Syllabus 

1.  The Solomon Amendment should be read the way both the Govern-
ment and FAIR interpret it: In order for a law school and its university 
to receive federal funding, the law school must offer military recruiters 
the same access to its campus and students that it provides to the non-
military recruiter receiving the most favorable access.  Contrary to the 
argument of amici law professors, a school excluding military recruiters 
could  not  comply  with  the  Solomon  Amendment  by  also  excluding  any 
other  recruiter  that  violates  its  nondiscrimination  policy.  The  Secre-
tary  of  Defense  must  compare  the  military's  "access  to  campuses"  and 
"to  students"  to  "the  access  to  campuses  and  to  students  that  is  pro-
vided to any other employer."  10 U. S. C. $ 983.  The statute does not 
focus  on  the  content  of  a  school's  recruiting  policy,  but  on  the  result 
achieved by the policy.  Applying the same policy to all recruiters does 
not comply  with the statute if  it results in a greater level of access for 
other recruiters than for the military.  This interpretation is supported 
by the text of the statute and is necessary to give effect to the Solomon 
Amendment's recent revision.  Pp. 55-58. 

2.  Under the Solomon Amendment, a university must allow equal ac-
cess  for  military  recruiters  in  order  to  receive  certain  federal  funds. 
Although  there  are  limits  on  Congress'  ability  to  condition  the  receipt 
of  funds,  see,  e. g.,  United  States  v.  American  Library  Assn.,  Inc.,  539 
U. S. 194, 210, a funding condition cannot be unconstitutional if it could 
be  constitutionally  imposed  directly.  Because  the  First  Amendment 
would  not  prevent  Congress  from  directly  imposing  the  Solomon 
Amendment's  access requirement, the statute  does  not place  an uncon-
stitutional condition on the receipt of federal funds.  Pp. 58-70. 

(a)  As  a  general  matter,  the  Solomon  Amendment  regulates  con-
duct,  not  speech.  Nevertheless,  the  Court  of  Appeals  concluded  that 
the statute violates law schools' freedom of speech in a number of ways. 
First, the law schools must provide military recruiters with some assist-
ance  clearly  involving  speech,  such  as  sending e-mails  and  distributing 
flyers, if they provide such services to other recruiters.  This speech is 
subject to First Amendment scrutiny, but the compelled speech here is 
plainly  incidental  to the  statute's  regulation  of conduct.  Compelling  a 
law school that sends e-mails for other recruiters to send one for a mili-
tary  recruiter  is  simply  not  the  same  as  forcing  a  student  to  pledge 
allegiance  to  the  flag,  West  Virginia  Bd.  of  Ed.  v.  Barnette,  319  U. S. 
624, or forcing a Jehovah's Witness to display a particular motto on his 
license  plate,  Wooley  v.  Maynard,  430  U. S.  705,  and  it  trivializes  the 
freedom protected in Barnette and Wooley  to suggest that it is. 

Second,  that  military  recruiters  are,  to  some  extent,  speaking  while 
on campus does not mean that the Solomon Amendment unconstitution-
ally requires law schools  to accommodate the military's message by in-

cluding  those  recruiters  in interviews  and  recruiting  receptions.  This 
Court  has  found  compelled-speech  violations  where  the  complaining 
speaker's own message was affected  by the speech  it was forced to ac-
commodate.  See, e. g., Hurley v.  Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bi-
sexual  Group  of  Boston,  Inc.,  515  U. S.  557,  566.  Here,  however,  the 
schools  are  not  speaking  when  they  host  interviews  and  recruiting  re-
ceptions.  They facilitate recruiting to assist their students in obtaining 
jobs.  Thus, a law school's recruiting services lack the expressive qual-
ity  of,  for  example,  the  parade  in  Hurley.  Nothing  about  recruiting 
suggests that law schools agree with any speech by recruiters, and noth-
ing in  the Solomon Amendment  restricts what  they may say about the 
military's policies. 

Third, the expressive nature of the conduct regulated by the Solomon 
Amendment does not bring that conduct within the First Amendment's 
protection.  Unlike  flag  burning,  see  Texas  v.  Johnson,  491  U. S.  397, 
the conduct here is not so inherently expressive that it warrants protec-
tion  under  O'Brien.  Before  adoption  of  the  Solomon  Amendment's 
equal  access  requirement,  law  schools  expressed  their  disagreement 
with the military by treating military recruiters differently from other 
recruiters.  These  actions  were  expressive  not  because  of  the  conduct 
but  because  of  the  speech  that  accompanied  that  conduct.  Moreover, 
even  if  the  Solomon  Amendment  were  regarded  as  regulating  expres-
sive conduct, it would be constitutional under O'Brien.  Pp. 58-68. 

(b)  The Solomon Amendment also does not violate the law schools' 
freedom  of  expressive  association.  Unlike  Boy  Scouts  of  America  v. 
Dale, 530 U. S. 640, where the Boy Scouts' freedom of expressive associ-
ation was violated when a state law required the organization to accept 
a homosexual scoutmaster, the statute here does not force a law school 
" `to accept members it does not desire,' " id., at 648.  Law schools "as-
sociate"  with  military  recruiters  in  the  sense  that  they  interact  with 
them, but recruiters are not part of the school.  They are outsiders who 
come  onto  campus  for  the  limited  purpose  of  trying  to  hire  students-- 
not  to  become  members  of  the  school's  expressive  association.  The 
freedom of expressive association protects more than a group's member-
ship decisions, reaching activities that affect a group's ability to express 
its  message  by  making  group  membership  less  attractive.  But  the 
Solomon Amendment has no similar effect on a law school's associational 
rights.  Students  and  faculty  are  free  to  associate  to  voice  their  dis-
approval  of  the  military's  message;  nothing  about  the  statute  affects 
the  composition  of  the  group  by  making  membership  less  desirable.

52  RUMSFELD  v.  FORUM  FOR  ACADEMIC  AND  INSTITUTIONAL  RIGHTS,  INC. 

Opinion of the Court 

I 
Respondent Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc. (FAIR), is an association of law schools and law faculties. 

App.  5.  Its  declared  mission  is  "to  promote  academic  free-dom,  support  educational  institutions  in  opposing  discrimi-
nation and vindicate the rights of institutions of higher edu-cation." 

Id.,  at  6.  FAIR  members  have  adopted  policies expressing  their  opposition  to  discrimination  based  on, 

among  other  factors,  sexual  orientation.  Id.,  at  18.  They would  like  to  restrict  military  recruiting  on  their  campuses 
because they object to the policy Congress has adopted with respect  to  homosexuals  in  the  military.  See  10  U. S. C. 

$ 654.1  The  Solomon  Amendment,  however,  forces  institu-tions  to  choose  between  enforcing  their  nondiscrimination 
policy against military recruiters in this way and continuing to receive specified federal funding. 

In 2003, FAIR sought a preliminary injunction against en-forcement of the Solomon Amendment, which at that time-- 
it  has  since  been  amended--prevented  the  Department  of Defense (DOD) from providing specified federal funds to any 
institution  of  higher  education  "that  either  prohibits,  or  in effect  prevents"  military  recruiters  "from  gaining  entry  to 
campuses."  $ 983(b).2  FAIR  considered  the  DOD's  inter-

1 Under  this  policy,  a  person  generally  may  not  serve  in  the  Armed 
Forces if he has engaged in homosexual acts, stated that he is a homosex-
ual, or married a person of the same sex.  Respondents do not challenge 
that policy in this litigation. 

2 The complaint named numerous other plaintiffs as well.  The District 

Court  concluded  that  each  plaintiff  had  standing  to  bring  this  suit.  291 
F. Supp. 2d 269, 284-296 (NJ 2003).  The Court of  Appeals for the Third 
Circuit agreed with the District Court that FAIR had associational stand-
ing  to  bring  this  suit  on  behalf  of  its  members.  390  F.  3d  219,  228,  n.  7 
(2004).  The Court of Appeals did not determine whether the other plain-
tiffs  have  standing  because  the  presence  of  one  party  with  standing  is 
sufficient  to  satisfy  Article  III's  case-or-controversy  requirement.  Ibid. 
(citing  Bowsher  v.  Synar,  478  U. S.  714,  721  (1986)).  Because  we  also 
agree that FAIR has standing, we similarly limit our discussion to FAIR.

Opinion of the Court 
pretation  of  this  provision  particularly  objectionable.  Al-
though  the  statute  required  only  "entry  to  campuses,"  the 
Government--after  the  terrorist  attacks  on  September  11, 
2001--adopted  an  informal  policy  of  " `requir[ing]  universi-
ties  to  provide  military  recruiters  access  to  students  equal 
in  quality  and  scope  to  that  provided  to  other  recruiters.' " 
291 F. Supp. 2d 269, 283 (NJ 2003).  Prior to the adoption of 
this policy, some law schools sought to promote their nondis-
crimination  policies  while  still  complying  with  the  Solomon 
Amendment  by  having  military  recruiters  interview  on  the 
undergraduate  campus.  Id.,  at  282.  But  under  the  equal 
access  policy,  military  recruiters  had  to  be  permitted  to  in-
terview at the law schools, if other recruiters did so. 

FAIR  argued  that  this  forced  inclusion  and  equal  treat-
ment  of  military  recruiters  violated  the  law  schools'  First 
Amendment freedoms of speech and association.  According 
to  FAIR,  the  Solomon Amendment  was  unconstitutional  be-
cause it forced law schools to choose between exercising their 
First Amendment right to decide whether to disseminate or 
accommodate  a  military  recruiter's  message,  and  ensuring 
the availability of federal funding for their universities. 

The  District  Court  denied  the  preliminary  injunction  on 
the  ground  that  FAIR  had  failed  to  establish  a  likelihood  of 
success  on  the  merits  of  its  First  Amendment  claims.  The 
District  Court  held  that  inclusion  "of  an  unwanted  periodic 
visitor"  did  not  "significantly  affect  the  law  schools'  ability 
to  express  their  particular  message  or  viewpoint."  Id.,  at 
304.  The  District  Court  based  its  decision  in  large  part  on 
the determination that recruiting is conduct and not speech, 
concluding  that  any  expressive  aspect  of  recruiting  "is  en-
tirely  ancillary  to  its  dominant  economic  purpose."  Id.,  at 
308.  The  District  Court  held  that  Congress  could  regulate 
this expressive aspect of the conduct under the test set forth 
in  United  States  v.  O'Brien,  391  U. S.  367  (1968).  291 
F. Supp. 2d, at 311-314.

54  RUMSFELD  v.  FORUM  FOR  ACADEMIC  AND  INSTITUTIONAL  RIGHTS,  INC. 

Opinion of the Court 

In rejecting FAIR's constitutional claims, the District 
Court  disagreed  with  "the  DOD's  proposed  interpretation 
that the statute requires law schools to `provide military re-
cruiters  access  to  students  that  is  at  least  equal  in  quality 
and  scope  to  the  access  provided  other  potential  employ-
ers.' "  Id., at 321.  In response to the  District Court's con-
cerns,  Congress  codified  the  DOD's  informal  policy.  See 
H. R. Rep. No. 108-443, pt. 1, p. 6 (2004) (discussing the Dis-
trict  Court's  decision  in  this  case  and  stating  that  the 
amended statute "would address the court's opinion and cod-
ify  the  equal  access  standard").  The  Solomon  Amendment 
now  prevents  an  institution  from  receiving  certain  federal 
funding  if  it  prohibits  military  recruiters  "from  gaining  ac-
cess to campuses, or access to students . . . on campuses, for 
purposes  of  military  recruiting  in  a  manner  that  is  at  least 
equal  in  quality  and  scope  to  the  access  to  campuses  and 
to  students  that  is  provided  to  any  other  employer."  10 
U. S. C. $ 983(b) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).3 

FAIR  appealed  the  District  Court's  judgment,  arguing 
that the  recently amended Solomon Amendment  was uncon-
stitutional  for  the  same  reasons  as  the  earlier  version.  A 
divided  panel  of  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Third  Circuit 
agreed.  390  F.  3d  219  (2004).  According  to  the  Third  Cir-
cuit,  the  Solomon  Amendment  violated  the  unconstitutional 
conditions  doctrine  because  it  forced  a  law  school  to  choose 
between  surrendering  First  Amendment  rights  and  losing 
federal  funding  for  its  university.  Id.,  at  229-243.  Unlike 

3 The federal funds covered by the Solomon Amendment are specified at 
10  U. S. C.  $ 983(d)(1)  (2000  ed.,  Supp.  IV)  and  include  funding  from  the 
Departments  of  Defense,  Homeland  Security,  Transportation,  Labor, 
Health and Human  Services, and Education, and the Central  Intelligence 
Agency and the National Nuclear Security Administration of the Depart-
ment of Energy.  Funds provided for student financial assistance are not 
covered.  $ 983(d)(2).  The loss of funding applies not only to the particu-
lar school denying access but universitywide.  $ 983(b).

Opinion of the Court 
the  District  Court,  the  Court  of  Appeals  did  not  think  that the  O'Brien  analysis  applied  because  the  Solomon  Amend-

ment, in its view, regulated speech and not simply expressive conduct.  390  F.  3d,  at  243-244.  The  Third  Circuit  none-
theless  determined  that  if  the  regulated  activities  were properly  treated  as  expressive  conduct  rather  than  speech, 
the  Solomon  Amendment  was  also  unconstitutional  under 
O'Brien.  390  F.  3d,  at  244-246.  As  a  result,  the  Court  of Appeals  reversed  and  remanded  for  the  District  Court  to 

enter  a  preliminary  injunction  against  enforcement  of  the Solomon Amendment.  Id.,  at  246.  A dissenting judge 
would have applied O'Brien and affirmed.  390 F. 3d, at 260- 262 (opinion of Aldisert, J.). 

We granted certiorari.  544 U. S. 1017 (2005). 

II 
The Solomon  Amendment denies federal  funding to an  in-stitution of higher education that "has a policy or practice . . . 

that  either  prohibits,  or  in  effect  prevents"  the  military "from  gaining  access  to  campuses,  or  access  to  students  .  .  . 
on  campuses,  for  purposes  of  military  recruiting  in  a  man-ner  that  is  at  least  equal  in  quality  and  scope  to  the  access 
to  campuses  and  to  students  that  is  provided  to  any  other employer."  10  U. S. C.  $ 983(b)  (2000  ed.,  Supp.  IV).  The 
statute  provides  an  exception  for  an  institution  with  "a longstanding  policy  of  pacifism  based  on  historical  religious 
affiliation."  $ 983(c)(2) (2000 ed.).  The Government and FAIR  agree  on  what  this  statute  requires:  In  order  for  a 

law  school  and  its  university  to  receive  federal  funding,  the law  school  must  offer  military  recruiters  the  same  access  to 
its  campus  and  students  that  it  provides  to  the  nonmilitary recruiter receiving the most favorable access. 

Certain  law  professors  participating  as  amici,  however, argue that the Government and FAIR misinterpret the stat-
ute.  See  Brief  for  William  Alford  et  al.  as  Amici  Curiae

Opinion of the Court 

10-18;  Brief  for  56  Columbia  Law  School  Faculty  Members 
as  Amici  Curiae  6-15.  According  to  these  amici,  the 
Solomon  Amendment's  equal  access  requirement  is  satisfied 
when  an  institution  applies  to  military  recruiters  the  same 
policy  it  applies  to  all  other  recruiters.  On  this  reading,  a 
school  excluding  military  recruiters  would  comply  with  the 
Solomon  Amendment  so  long  as  it  also  excluded  any  other 
employer that violates its nondiscrimination policy. 

In  its  reply  brief,  the  Government  claims  that  this  ques-
tion  is  not  before  the  Court  because  it  was  neither  included 
in the questions presented nor raised by FAIR.  Reply Brief 
for  Petitioners  20,  n.  4.  But  our  review  may,  in  our  dis-
cretion,  encompass  questions  " `fairly  included' "  within  the 
question  presented,  Yee  v.  Escondido,  503  U. S.  519,  535 
(1992),  and there can  be  little doubt  that granting  certiorari 
to  determine  whether  a  statute  is  constitutional  fairly  in-
cludes the question of what that statute says.  Nor must we 
accept  an  interpretation  of  a  statute  simply  because  it  is 
agreed to by the parties.  After all, "[o]ur task is to construe 
what  Congress  has  enacted."  Duncan  v.  Walker,  533  U. S. 
167, 172 (2001).  We think it appropriate in the present case 
to  consider  whether  institutions  can  comply  with  the  Solo-
mon  Amendment  by  applying  a  general  nondiscrimination 
policy to exclude military recruiters. 

We  conclude  that  they  cannot  and  that  the  Government 
and  FAIR  correctly  interpret  the  Solomon  Amendment. 
The  statute  requires  the  Secretary  of  Defense  to  compare 
the  military's "access to campuses"  and "access to students" 
to  "the  access  to  campuses  and  to  students  that  is  provided 
to  any  other  employer."  (Emphasis  added.)  The  statute 
does  not  call  for  an  inquiry  into  why  or  how  the  "other  em-
ployer"  secured  its  access.  Under  amici's  reading,  a  mili-
tary  recruiter  has  the  same  "access"  to  campuses  and  stu-
dents  as,  say,  a  law  firm  when  the  law  firm  is  permitted  on 
campus  to  interview  students  and  the  military  is  not.  We

Opinion of the Court 
do  not  think  that  the  military  recruiter  has  received  equal 
"access"  in  this  situation--regardless  of  whether  the  dis-
parate  treatment  is  attributable  to  the  military's  failure  to 
comply with the school's nondiscrimination policy. 

The  Solomon  Amendment  does  not  focus  on  the  content 
of  a  school's  recruiting  policy,  as  the  amici  would  have  it. 
Instead, it looks to the result achieved by the policy and com-
pares  the  "access  .  .  .  provided"  military  recruiters  to  that 
provided  other  recruiters.  Applying  the  same  policy  to  all 
recruiters is therefore insufficient to comply with the statute 
if  it  results  in  a  greater  level  of  access  for  other  recruiters 
than  for  the  military.  Law  schools  must  ensure  that  their 
recruiting  policy  operates  in  such  a  way  that  military  re-
cruiters  are  given  access  to  students  at  least  equal  to  that 
"provided to any other employer."  (Emphasis added.) 

Not only does the text support this view, but this interpre-
tation  is  necessary  to  give  effect  to  the  Solomon  Amend-
ment's recent revision.  Under the prior version, the statute 
required  "entry"  without  specifying  how  military  recruiters 
should be treated once on campus.  10 U. S. C. $ 983(b) (2000 
ed.).  The  District  Court  thought  that  the  DOD  policy, 
which required equal access to students once recruiters were 
on campus, was unwarranted based on the text of the statute. 
291 F. Supp. 2d, at 321.  Congress responded directly to this 
decision by codifying the DOD policy.  Under amici's inter-
pretation,  this  legislative  change  had  no  effect--law  schools 
could still restrict military access, so long as they do so under 
a  generally  applicable  nondiscrimination  policy.  Worse  yet, 
the  legislative  change  made  it  easier  for  schools  to  keep 
military  recruiters  out  altogether:  Under  the  prior  version, 
simple  access  could  not  be  denied,  but  under  the  amended 
version, access  could be  denied altogether,  so  long as  a  non-
military  recruiter  would  also  be  denied  access.  That  is 
rather  clearly  not  what  Congress  had  in  mind  in  codify-
ing  the  DOD  policy.  We  refuse  to  interpret  the  Solomon

Opinion of the Court 

Amendment  in  a  way  that  negates  its  recent  revision,  and indeed would render it a largely meaningless exercise. 

We therefore read the Solomon Amendment the way both the Government and FAIR interpret it.  It is insufficient for 
a  law  school  to  treat  the  military  as  it  treats  all  other  em-ployers who violate its nondiscrimination policy.  Under the 
statute,  military  recruiters  must  be  given  the  same  access as recruiters who comply with the policy. 

III 
The  Constitution  grants  Congress  the  power  to  "provide for  the  common  Defence,"  "[t]o  raise  and  support  Armies," 

and  "[t]o  provide  and  maintain  a  Navy."  Art.  I,  $ 8,  cls.  1, 12-13.  Congress'  power  in  this  area  "is  broad  and  sweep-
ing,"  O'Brien,  391  U. S.,  at  377,  and  there  is  no  dispute  in this  case  that  it  includes  the  authority  to  require  campus 
access  for  military  recruiters.  That  is,  of  course,  unless Congress  exceeds  constitutional  limitations  on  its  power  in 
enacting such legislation.  See Rostker v.  Goldberg, 453 U. S. 57, 67 (1981).  But the fact that legislation that raises armies 
is  subject  to  First  Amendment  constraints  does  not  mean that we ignore the purpose of this legislation when determin-
ing  its  constitutionality;  as  we  recognized  in  Rostker,  "judi-cial deference . . . is  at its  apogee" when Congress legislates 
under  its  authority  to  raise  and  support  armies.  Id.,  at  70. Although  Congress  has  broad  authority  to  legislate  on 
matters of military recruiting, it nonetheless chose to secure campus  access  for  military  recruiters  indirectly,  through  its 
Spending  Clause  power.  The  Solomon  Amendment  gives universities  a  choice:  Either  allow  military  recruiters  the 
same access to students afforded any other recruiter or forgo certain  federal  funds.  Congress'  decision  to  proceed  indi-
rectly  does  not  reduce  the  deference  given  to  Congress  in the area of military affairs.  Congress' choice to promote its 
goal by creating a funding condition deserves at least as def-

Opinion of the Court 
erential  treatment  as  if  Congress  had  imposed  a  mandate 
on universities. 

Congress' power to regulate military recruiting under the 
Solomon  Amendment  is  arguably  greater  because  universi-
ties  are  free  to  decline  the  federal  funds.  In  Grove  City 
College  v.  Bell,  465  U. S.  555,  575-576  (1984),  we  rejected 
a  private  college's  claim  that  conditioning  federal  funds  on 
its  compliance  with  Title  IX  of  the  Education  Amendments 
of  1972  violated  the  First  Amendment.  We  thought  this 
argument  "warrant[ed]  only  brief  consideration"  because 
"Congress  is  free  to  attach  reasonable  and  unambiguous 
conditions  to  federal  financial  assistance  that  educational 
institutions  are  not  obligated  to  accept."  Id.,  at  575.  We 
concluded that no First Amendment violation had occurred-- 
without  reviewing  the  substance  of  the  First  Amendment 
claims--because  Grove  City  could  decline  the  Government's 
funds.  Id., at 575-576. 

Other  decisions,  however,  recognize  a  limit  on  Congress' 
ability  to  place  conditions  on  the  receipt  of  funds.  We  re-
cently  held  that  " `the  government  may  not  deny  a  benefit 
to  a  person  on  a  basis  that  infringes  his  constitutionally 
protected . . . freedom of speech even if he has no entitlement 
to that benefit.' "  United States v.  American Library Assn., 
Inc.,  539  U. S.  194,  210  (2003)  (quoting  Board  of  Comm'rs, 
Wabaunsee  Cty.  v.  Umbehr,  518  U. S.  668,  674  (1996)  (some 
internal  quotation  marks  omitted)).  Under  this  principle, 
known  as  the  unconstitutional  conditions  doctrine,  the  Sol-
omon  Amendment  would  be  unconstitutional  if  Congress 
could  not  directly  require  universities  to  provide  military 
recruiters equal access to their students. 

This  case  does  not  require  us  to  determine  when  a  condi-
tion  placed  on  university  funding  goes  beyond  the  "reason-
able"  choice  offered  in  Grove  City  and  becomes  an  uncon-
stitutional  condition.  It  is  clear  that  a  funding  condition 
cannot  be  unconstitutional  if  it  could  be  constitutionally  im-

posed  directly.  See  Speiser  v.  Randall,  357  U. S.  513,  526 
(1958).  Because  the  First  Amendment  would  not  prevent 
Congress  from  directly  imposing  the  Solomon  Amendment's 
access requirement, the statute does not place an unconstitu-
tional condition on the receipt of federal funds. 

A 
The  Solomon  Amendment  neither  limits  what  law  schools 
may  say  nor  requires  them  to  say  anything.  Law  schools 
remain  free  under  the  statute  to  express  whatever  views 
they  may  have  on  the  military's  congressionally  mandated 
employment policy, all the while retaining eligibility for fed-
eral  funds.  See  Tr.  of  Oral  Arg.  25  (Solicitor  General  ac-
knowledging that law schools "could put signs on the bulletin 
board  next  to  the  door,  they  could  engage  in  speech,  they 
could help organize student protests").  As a general matter, 
the  Solomon Amendment  regulates  conduct, not  speech.  It 
affects what law schools must do--afford equal access to mil-
itary recruiters--not what they may or may not say. 

Nevertheless,  the  Third  Circuit  concluded  that  the  Solo-
mon  Amendment  violates  law  schools'  freedom  of  speech  in 
a  number  of  ways.  First,  in  assisting  military  recruiters, 
law  schools  provide  some  services,  such  as  sending  e-mails 
and  distributing  flyers,  that  clearly  involve  speech.  The 
Court  of  Appeals  held  that  in  supplying  these  services  law 
schools  are  unconstitutionally  compelled  to  speak  the  Gov-
ernment's  message.  Second,  military  recruiters  are,  to 
some  extent,  speaking  while  they  are  on  campus.  The 
Court of Appeals held that, by forcing law schools to permit 
the  military  on  campus  to express  its message,  the  Solomon 
Amendment  unconstitutionally  requires  law  schools  to  host 
or  accommodate  the  military's  speech.  Third,  although  the 
Court of Appeals thought that the Solomon Amendment reg-
ulated  speech,  it  held  in  the  alternative  that,  if  the  statute 
regulates conduct,  this conduct is expressive  and regulating

Opinion of the Court 
it unconstitutionally infringes law schools' right to engage in expressive conduct.  We consider each issue in turn.

1 
Some of this Court's leading First Amendment precedents have established the principle that freedom of speech prohib-

its  the  government  from  telling  people  what  they  must  say. In 

West  Virginia  Bd.  of  Ed.  v.  Barnette,  319  U. S.  624,  642 (1943), we held unconstitutional a state law requiring school-

children  to recite  the  Pledge of Allegiance and  to salute  the flag.  And  in  Wooley  v.  Maynard,  430  U. S.  705,  717  (1977), 
we  held  unconstitutional  another  that  required  New  Hamp-shire  motorists  to  display  the  state  motto--"Live  Free  or 
Die"--on their license plates. The Solomon Amendment does not require any similar ex-
pression  by law schools.  Nonetheless,  recruiting  assistance provided  by  the  schools  often  includes  elements  of  speech. 
For  example,  schools  may  send  e-mails  or  post  notices  on bulletin  boards  on  an  employer's  behalf.  See, 

e. g.,  App. 169-170;  Brief  for  NALP  (National  Association  for  Law 

Placement) et al. as Amici Curiae 11.  Law schools offering such services to other recruiters must also  send e-mails  and 
post notices on behalf of the military to comply with the Sol-

4 The Court of Appeals also held that the Solomon Amendment violated 
the  First  Amendment  because  it  compelled  law  schools  to  subsidize  the 
Government's speech "by putting demands on the law schools' employees 
and  resources."  390  F.  3d,  at  240.  We  do  not  consider  the  law  schools' 
assistance  to  raise  the  issue  of  subsidizing  Government  speech  as  that 
concept has been used in our cases.  See Johanns v.  Livestock Marketing 
Assn.,  544  U. S.  550,  559  (2005).  The  accommodations  the  law  schools 
must  provide  to  military  recruiters  are  minimal,  are  not  of  a  monetary 
nature,  and  are extended to  all  employers  recruiting on campus,  not just 
the  Government.  And  in  Johanns,  which  was  decided  after  the  Third 
Circuit's  decision  in  this  case,  we  noted  that  our  previous  compelled-
subsidy cases involved subsidizing private speech, and we held that "[c]iti-
zens may challenge compelled support of private speech, but have no First 
Amendment right not to fund government speech."  Id., at 562.  The mil-
itary recruiters' speech is clearly Government speech.

omon  Amendment.  As  FAIR  points  out,  these  compelled statements  of  fact  ("The  U. S.  Army  recruiter  will  meet  in-

terested  students  in  Room  123  at  11  a.m."),  like  compelled statements of opinion, are subject to First Amendment scru-
tiny.  See Brief for Respondents 25 (citing Riley v.  National 
Federation  of  Blind  of  N.  C.,  Inc.,  487  U. S.  781,  797-798 
(1988)). 

This  sort  of  recruiting  assistance,  however,  is  a  far  cry from  the  compelled  speech  in 

Barnette  and  Wooley.  The 
Solomon Amendment, unlike the laws at issue in those cases, does  not  dictate  the  content  of  the  speech  at  all,  which  is 

only  "compelled"  if,  and  to  the  extent,  the  school  provides 
such  speech  for  other  recruiters.  There  is  nothing  in  this 
case  approaching  a  Government-mandated  pledge  or  motto 
that the school must endorse. 

The  compelled  speech  to  which  the  law  schools  point  is 
plainly incidental to the Solomon Amendment's regulation of 
conduct,  and  "it  has  never  been  deemed  an  abridgment  of 
freedom of speech or press to make a  course of conduct ille-
gal  merely  because  the  conduct  was  in  part  initiated,  evi-
denced,  or  carried  out  by  means  of  language,  either  spoken, 
written, or printed."  Giboney v.  Empire Storage & Ice Co., 
336  U. S.  490,  502  (1949).  Congress,  for  example,  can  pro-
hibit employers from discriminating in hiring on the basis of 
race.  The  fact  that  this  will  require  an  employer  to  take 
down  a sign  reading  "White  Applicants  Only"  hardly  means 
that  the  law  should  be  analyzed  as  one  regulating  the  em-
ployer's  speech  rather  than  conduct.  See  R.  A.  V.  v.  St. 
Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 389 (1992) ("[W]ords can in some circum-
stances  violate  laws  directed  not  against  speech  but  against 
conduct").  Compelling  a  law  school  that  sends  scheduling 
e-mails  for  other  recruiters  to  send  one  for  a  military  re-
cruiter is simply not the same as forcing a student to pledge 
allegiance,  or  forcing  a  Jehovah's  Witness  to  display  the 
motto "Live Free or Die," and it trivializes the freedom pro-
tected in Barnette and Wooley  to suggest that it is.

Opinion of the Court 

2 
Our compelled-speech cases are not limited to the situation in  which  an  individual  must  personally  speak  the  govern-

ment's message.  We have also in a number of instances lim-ited  the  government's  ability  to  force  one  speaker  to  host 
or  accommodate  another  speaker's  message.  See  Hurley  v. 
Irish-American  Gay,  Lesbian  and  Bisexual  Group  of  Bos-ton,  Inc.,  515  U. S.  557,  566  (1995)  (state  law  cannot  require 

a  parade  to  include  a  group  whose  message  the  parade's  or-ganizer  does  not  wish  to  send);  Pacific  Gas  &  Elec.  Co.  v. 
Public  Util.  Comm'n  of  Cal.,  475  U. S.  1,  20-21  (1986)  (plu-rality  opinion);  accord, 

id.,  at  25  (Marshall,  J.,  concurring  in judgment) (state agency cannot require a utility company to 

include  a  third-party  newsletter  in  its  billing  envelope); Miami Herald Publishing Co. v.  Tornillo, 418 U. S. 241, 258 
(1974) (right-of-reply statute violates editors' right to deter-mine  the  content  of  their  newspapers).  Relying  on  these 
precedents,  the  Third  Circuit  concluded  that  the  Solomon Amendment  unconstitutionally  compels  law  schools  to  ac-
commodate the military's message "[b]y requiring schools to include  military  recruiters  in  the  interviews  and  recruiting 
receptions the schools arrange."  390 F. 3d, at 240. The  compelled-speech violation  in  each  of our  prior cases, 
however, resulted from  the  fact that  the  complaining speak-er's  own  message  was  affected  by  the  speech  it  was  forced 
to  accommodate.  The  expressive  nature  of  a  parade  was central to our holding in 

Hurley.  515 U. S., at 568 ("Parades are . . . a form of expression, not just motion, and the inher-

ent expressiveness of marching to make a point explains our cases  involving  protest  marches").  We  concluded  that  be-
cause "every participating unit affects the message conveyed by  the  [parade's]  private  organizers,"  a  law  dictating  that  a 
particular group must be included in the parade "alter[s] the expressive  content  of  th[e]  parade."  Id.,  at  572-573.  As  a 
result, we held that the State's public accommodation law, as applied  to  a  private  parade,  "violates  the  fundamental  rule

Opinion of the Court 

of protection under the First Amendment, that a speaker has the  autonomy  to  choose  the  content  of  his  own  message." 

Id., at 573. The  compelled-speech  violations  in 

Tornillo  and  Pacific 
Gas also resulted from interference with a speaker's desired message.  In 

Tornillo,  we  recognized  that  "the  compelled 
printing of a reply . . . tak[es] up  space that could be devoted 
to  other  material  the  newspaper  may  have  preferred  to print,"  418  U. S.,  at  256,  and  therefore  concluded  that  this 

right-of-reply  statute  infringed  the  newspaper  editors'  free-dom  of  speech  by  altering  the  message  the  paper  wished 
to  express,  id.,  at  258.  The  same  is  true  in  Pacific  Gas. 
There, the utility company regularly included its newsletter, 
which we concluded was protected speech, in its billing enve-
lope.  475  U. S.,  at  8-9.  Thus,  when  the  state  agency  or-
dered the utility to send a third-party newsletter four times 
a year, it interfered with the utility's ability to communicate 
its own message in its newsletter.  A plurality of the Court 
likened  this  to  the  situation  in  Tornillo  and  held  that  the 
forced  inclusion  of  the  other  newsletter  interfered  with  the 
utility's own message.  475 U. S., at 16-18. 

In  this  case,  accommodating  the  military's  message  does 
not  affect  the  law  schools'  speech,  because  the  schools  are 
not  speaking  when  they  host  interviews  and  recruiting  re-
ceptions.  Unlike  a parade  organizer's  choice of parade  con-
tingents,  a  law  school's  decision  to  allow  recruiters  on 
campus is  not inherently expressive.  Law  schools facilitate 
recruiting  to  assist  their  students  in  obtaining  jobs.  A  law 
school's  recruiting  services  lack  the  expressive  quality  of  a 
parade,  a  newsletter,  or  the  editorial  page  of  a  newspaper; 
its  accommodation  of  a  military  recruiter's  message  is  not 
compelled speech because the accommodation does not suffi-
ciently interfere with any message of the school. 

The  schools  respond  that  if  they  treat  military  and  non-
military  recruiters  alike  in  order  to  comply  with  the  Sol-
omon  Amendment,  they  could  be  viewed  as  sending  the

Opinion of the Court 
message  that  they  see  nothing  wrong  with  the  military's policies,  when  they  do.  We  rejected  a  similar  argument  in 

PruneYard  Shopping  Center  v.  Robins,  447  U. S.  74  (1980). In  that  case,  we  upheld  a  state  law  requiring  a  shopping 
center owner to allow certain expressive activities by others on  its  property.  We  explained  that  there  was  little  likeli-
hood  that  the  views  of  those  engaging  in  the  expressive  ac-tivities  would  be  identified  with  the  owner,  who  remained 
free  to  disassociate  himself  from  those  views  and  who  was "not  .  .  .  being  compelled  to  affirm  [a]  belief  in  any  govern-
mentally prescribed position or view."  Id., at 88. The same is true here.  Nothing about recruiting suggests 
that  law  schools  agree  with  any  speech  by  recruiters,  and nothing  in  the  Solomon  Amendment  restricts  what  the  law 
schools may say about the military's policies.  We have held that  high  school  students  can  appreciate  the  difference  be-
tween  speech  a  school  sponsors  and  speech  the  school  per-mits  because  legally  required  to  do  so,  pursuant  to  an  equal 
access  policy.  Board  o f  Ed.  of  Westside  Communi ty Schools (Dist. 66)  v.  Mergens, 496  U. S. 226, 250  (1990)  (plu-
rality opinion); accord, id., at 268 (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment);  see  also  Rosenberger  v.  Rector  and  Visitors  of 
Univ. of Va.,  515  U. S.  819,  841  (1995)  (attribution  concern "not  a  plausible  fear").  Surely  students  have  not  lost  that 
ability by the time they get to law school.

Having  rejected  the  view  that  the  Solomon  Amendment impermissibly regulates 

speech, we must still consider whether  the  expressive  nature  of  the  conduct  regulated  by 

the  statute  brings  that  conduct  within  the  First  Amend-ment's  protection.  In  O'Brien,  we  recognized  that  some 
forms  of  " `symbolic  speech' "  were  deserving  of  First Amendment protection.  391 U. S., at 376.  But we rejected 
the view that "conduct can be labeled `speech' whenever the person  engaging  in  the  conduct  intends  thereby  to  express

Opinion of the Court 

an  idea."  Ibid.  Instead,  we  have  extended  First  Amend-ment  protection  only  to  conduct  that  is  inherently  expres-

sive.  In  Texas  v.  Johnson,  491  U. S.  397,  406  (1989),  for example,  we  applied 

O'Brien  and  held  that  burning  the 
American  flag  was  sufficiently  expressive  to  warrant  First Amendment protection. 

Unlike flag burning, the conduct regulated by the Solomon 
Amendment is not inherently expressive.  Prior to the adop-tion of the Solomon Amendment's equal access requirement, 

law schools "expressed" their disagreement with the military by treating military recruiters differently from other recruit-
ers.  But  these  actions  were  expressive  only  because  the 
law  schools  accompanied  their  conduct  with  speech  explain-
ing  it.  For  example,  the  point  of  requiring  military  inter-
views  to  be  conducted  on  the  undergraduate  campus  is  not 
"overwhelmingly  apparent."  Johnson,  supra,  at  406.  An 
observer  who  sees  military  recruiters  interviewing  away 
from the law school has no way of knowing whether the law 
school  is  expressing  its  disapproval  of  the  military,  all  the 
law school's interview rooms are full, or the military recruit-
ers  decided  for  reasons  of  their  own  that  they  would  rather 
interview someplace else. 

The  expressive  component  of  a  law  school's  actions  is  not 
created by the conduct itself but by the speech that accompa-
nies  it.  The  fact  that  such  explanatory  speech  is  necessary 
is  strong  evidence  that  the  conduct  at  issue  here  is  not  so 
inherently  expressive  that  it  warrants  protection  under 
O'Brien.  If  combining  speech  and  conduct  were  enough  to 
create  expressive  conduct,  a  regulated  party  could  always 
transform  conduct  into  "speech"  simply  by  talking  about  it. 
For  instance,  if  an  individual  announces  that  he  intends  to 
express  his  disapproval  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  by 
refusing  to  pay  his  income  taxes,  we  would  have  to  apply 
O'Brien  to  determine  whether  the  Tax  Code  violates  the 
First  Amendment.  Neither  O'Brien  nor  its  progeny  sup-
ports such a result.

Opinion of the Court 
Although  the  Third  Circuit  also  concluded  that  O'Brien 
does  not  apply,  it  held  in  the  alternative  that  the  Solomon 
Amendment  does  not  pass  muster  under  O'Brien  because 
the  Government failed to produce evidence establishing that 
the  Solomon  Amendment  was  necessary  and  effective.  390 
F. 3d, at 245.  The Court of Appeals surmised that "the mili-
tary  has  ample  resources  to  recruit  through  alternative 
means,"  suggesting  "loan  repayment  programs"  and  "tele-
vision  and  radio  advertisements."  Id.,  at  234-235.  As  a 
result,  the  Government--according  to  the  Third  Circuit-- 
failed  to  establish  that  the  statute's  burden  on  speech  is  no 
greater  than  essential  to  furthering  its  interest  in  military 
recruiting.  Id., at 245. 

We  disagree  with  the  Court  of  Appeals'  reasoning  and 
result.  We  have  held  that  "an  incidental  burden  on  speech 
is  no  greater  than  is  essential,  and  therefore  is  permissible 
under  O'Brien,  so  long  as  the  neutral  regulation  promotes 
a  substantial  government  interest  that  would  be  achieved 
less  effectively  absent  the  regulation."  United  States  v. 
Albertini,  472  U. S.  675,  689  (1985).  The  Solomon  Amend-
ment  clearly satisfies  this  requirement.  Military  recruiting 
promotes the substantial Government interest in raising and 
supporting  the  Armed  Forces--an  objective  that  would  be 
achieved less effectively if the military were forced to recruit 
on less favorable terms than other employers.  The Court of 
Appeals'  proposed  alternative  methods of  recruiting  are  be-
side the point.  The issue is not whether other means of rais-
ing  an  army  and  providing  for  a  navy  might  be  adequate. 
See  id.,  at  689  (regulations  are  not  "invalid  simply  because 
there is some imaginable alternative that might be less bur-
densome on speech").  That is a judgment for Congress, not 
the courts.  See U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cls. 12-13; Rostker, 
453  U. S.,  at  64-65.  It  suffices  that  the  means  chosen  by 
Congress  add  to  the  effectiveness  of  military  recruitment. 
Accordingly, even if the Solomon Amendment were regarded

Opinion of the Court 

as  regulating  expressive  conduct,  it  would  not  violate  the First Amendment under O'Brien. 

B 
The  Solomon  Amendment  does  not  violate  law  schools' freedom of speech, but the First Amendment's protection ex-

tends  beyond  the  right  to  speak.  We  have  recognized  a First Amendment right to associate for the purpose of speak-
ing,  which  we  have  termed  a  "right  of  expressive  associa-tion."  See,  e. g.,  Boy  Scouts  of  America  v.  Dale,  530  U. S. 
640, 644 (2000).  The reason we have extended First Amend-ment  protection  in  this  way  is  clear:  The  right  to  speak  is 
often  exercised  most  effectively  by  combining  one's  voice with the voices of others.  See 

Roberts v.  United States Jay-cees, 468 U. S. 609, 622 (1984).  If the government were free 

to  restrict  individuals'  ability  to  join  together  and  speak,  it could essentially silence views  that  the  First Amendment  is 
intended to protect.  Ibid. FAIR  argues  that  the  Solomon  Amendment  violates  law 
schools'  freedom  of  expressive  association.  According  to FAIR, law schools' ability to express their message that dis-
crimination  on  the  basis  of  sexual  orientation  is  wrong  is significantly  affected  by  the  presence  of  military  recruiters 
on campus and the schools' obligation to assist them.  Rely-ing  heavily  on  our  decision  in 

Dale,  the  Court  of  Appeals agreed.  390 F. 3d, at 230-235. 

In  Dale, we  held  that  the  Boy  Scouts'  freedom  of  expres-sive  association  was  violated  by New  Jersey's  public  accom-
modations  law,  which  required  the  organization  to  accept  a homosexual  as  a  scoutmaster.  After  determining  that  the 
Boy  Scouts  was  an  expressive  association,  that  "the  forced inclusion  of  Dale  would  significantly  affect  its  expression," 
and  that  the  State's  interests  did  not  justify  this  intrusion, we  concluded  that  the  Boy  Scouts'  First  Amendment  rights 
were violated.  530 U. S., at 655-659.

Opinion of the Court 
The Solomon  Amendment, however, does  not  similarly af-
fect  a law  school's  associational  rights.  To comply  with  the 
statute, law schools must allow military recruiters on campus 
and assist them in whatever way the school chooses to assist 
other  employers.  Law  schools  therefore  "associate"  with 
military recruiters in the sense that they interact with them. 
But  recruiters  are  not  part  of  the  law  school.  Recruiters 
are,  by  definition,  outsiders  who  come  onto  campus  for  the 
limited  purpose  of  trying  to  hire  students--not  to  become 
members  of  the  school's  expressive  association.  This  dis-
tinction  is  critical.  Unlike  the  public  accommodations  law 
in Dale, the Solomon Amendment does not force a law school 
" `to accept  members it  does not  desire.' "  Id., at 648  (quot-
ing Roberts, supra, at 623).  The law schools say that allow-
ing  military  recruiters  equal  access  impairs  their  own  ex-
pression  by  requiring  them  to  associate  with  the  recruiters, 
but just as saying conduct is undertaken for expressive pur-
poses  cannot  make  it  symbolic  speech,  see  supra,  at  66,  so 
too  a  speaker  cannot  "erect a  shield"  against laws  requiring 
access  "simply  by  asserting"  that  mere  association  "would 
impair its message."  530 U. S., at 653. 

FAIR correctly notes that the freedom of expressive asso-
ciation  protects  more  than  just  a  group's  membership  deci-
sions.  For example, we have held laws unconstitutional that 
require  disclosure  of  membership  lists  for  groups  seeking 
anonymity,  Brown  v.  Socialist  Workers  '74  Campaign 
Comm. (Ohio), 459 U. S. 87, 101-102 (1982), or impose penal-
ties  or  withhold  benefits  based  on  membership  in  a  disfa-
vored  group,  Healy  v.  James,  408  U. S.  169,  180-184  (1972). 
Although these laws did not directly interfere with an orga-
nization's composition, they made group membership less at-
tractive,  raising  the  same  First  Amendment  concerns  about 
affecting the group's ability to express its message. 

The  Solomon  Amendment  has  no  similar  effect  on  a  law 
school's  associational  rights.  Students  and  faculty  are  free

Opinion of the Court 

to  associate  to  voice  their  disapproval  of  the  military's  mes-sage;  nothing  about  the  statute  affects  the  composition  of 

the group by making group membership less desirable.  The Solomon  Amendment  therefore  does  not  violate  a  law 
school's  First  Amendment  rights.  A  military  recruiter's mere  presence  on  campus  does  not  violate  a  law  school's 
right  to  associate,  regardless  of  how  repugnant  the  law school considers the recruiter's message. 

* * * 
In  this  case,  FAIR  has  attempted  to  stretch  a  number  of First Amendment doctrines well beyond the sort of activities 

these  doctrines  protect.  The  law  schools  object  to  having to  treat  military  recruiters  like  other  recruiters,  but  that 
regulation of conduct does not violate the First Amendment. To  the  extent  that  the  Solomon  Amendment  incidentally  af-
fects  expression,  the  law  schools'  effort  to  cast  themselves as  just  like  the  schoolchildren  in 

Barnette,  the  parade  orga-nizers  in 
Hurley,  and  the  Boy  Scouts  in  Dale  plainly  over-states the expressive nature of their activity and the impact 

of  the  Solomon  Amendment  on  it,  while  exaggerating  the reach of our First Amendment precedents. 

Because  Congress  could  require  law  schools  to  provide equal  access  to  military  recruiters  without  violating  the 
schools'  freedoms  of  speech  or  association,  the  Court  of  Ap-peals  erred  in  holding  that  the  Solomon  Amendment  likely 
violates  the  First  Amendment.  We  therefore  reverse  the judgment  of  the  Third  Circuit  and  remand  the  case  for  fur-
ther proceedings consistent with this opinion. 

It is so ordered.

Opinion of the Court 
Lynch's  practices.  The  investigation  sparked  a  number  of 
private securities fraud actions, this one among them.1 

Respondent,  Shadi  Dabit,  is  a  former  Merrill  Lynch  bro-
ker.  He filed  this  class  action in  the  United  States District 
Court for the Western District of Oklahoma on behalf of him-
self  and  all  other  former  or  current  brokers  who,  while  em-
ployed  by  Merrill  Lynch,  purchased  (for  themselves  and  for 
their  clients)  certain  stocks  between  December  1,  1999,  and 
December  31,  2000.  See  App.  27a-46a.  Rather  than  rely 
on  the  federal  securities  laws,  Dabit  invoked  the  District 
Court's  diversity jurisdiction and advanced  his claims  under 
Oklahoma state law. 

The  gist  of  Dabit's  complaint  was  that  Merrill  Lynch 
breached  the  fiduciary  duty  and  covenant  of  good  faith  and 
fair dealing it owed its  brokers by  disseminating misleading 
research  and  thereby  manipulating  stock  prices.2  Dabit's 
theory was that Merrill Lynch used its misinformed brokers 
to  enhance  the  prices  of  its  investment  banking  clients' 
stocks: The research analysts, under management's direction, 
allegedly  issued  overly  optimistic  appraisals  of  the  stocks' 
value;  the  brokers  allegedly  relied  on  the  analysts'  reports 
in advising  their investor clients  and in deciding whether or 
not  to  sell  their  own  holdings;  and  the  clients  and  brokers 
both  continued  to  hold  their  stocks  long  beyond  the  point 
when, had the truth been known, they would have sold.  The 
complaint  further  alleged  that  when  the  truth  was  actually 
revealed  (around  the  time  the  New  York  attorney  general 
instituted  his  investigation),  the  stocks'  prices  plummeted. 

1 Merrill Lynch eventually settled its dispute with the New York attor-
ney general. 

2 The  complaint  alleged,  for  example,  that  the  prices  of  the  subject 

stocks were "artificially inflated as a result of the manipulative efforts" of 
Merrill  Lynch,  and  that  Merrill Lynch,  "acting  as  a  central  nerve  center 
in the manipulation of various stocks . . . , perpetrated this stock manipula-
tion  through a  variety of deceptive devices, artifices, and  tactics that are 
the hallmarks of stock manipulation."  App. 28a-29a.

Opinion of the Court 
The  Magistrate  Judge  issued  the  warrant  as  requested. 
Two days later, an undercover postal inspector delivered the 
package.  Grubbs'  wife signed  for  it  and took  the  unopened 
package  inside.  The  inspectors  detained  Grubbs  as  he  left 
his  home  a  few  minutes  later,  then  entered  the  house  and 
commenced the search.  Roughly 30 minutes into the search, 
Grubbs  was  provided  with  a  copy  of  the  warrant,  which  in-
cluded both attachments but not the supporting affidavit that 
explained  when  the  warrant  would  be  executed.  Grubbs 
consented  to  interrogation  by  the  postal  inspectors  and  ad-
mitted ordering the videotape.  He was placed under arrest, 
and various items were seized, including the videotape. 

A  grand  jury  for  the  Eastern  District  of  California 
indicted  Grubbs on one count of receiving  a visual depiction 
of  a  minor  engaged  in  sexually  explicit  conduct.  See  18 
U. S. C.  $ 2252(a)(2).  He  moved  to  suppress  the  evidence 
seized during the search of his residence, arguing as relevant 
here  that  the  warrant  was  invalid  because  it  failed  to  list 
the  triggering  condition.  After  an evidentiary  hearing,  the 
District  Court  denied  the  motion.  Grubbs  pleaded  guilty, 
but  reserved  his  right  to  appeal  the  denial  of  his  motion  to 
suppress. 

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.  377 
F. 3d 1072, amended, 389 F. 3d 1306 (2004).  Relying on Cir-
cuit precedent, it held that "the particularity requirement of

tions  precedent  to  an  anticipatory  search  warrant."  377

104  GEORGIA  v.  RANDOLPH 

Syllabus 
(c)  This  Court took  a  step  toward addressing  the issue  here  when  it 
held  in  Minnesota  v.  Olson,  495  U. S.  91,  that  overnight  houseguests 
have  a  legitimate  expectation  of  privacy  in  their  temporary  quarters. 
If  that  customary  expectation  is a  foundation  of  a  houseguest's  Fourth 
Amendment  rights, it  should  follow that an  inhabitant of shared prem-
ises may claim at least as much.  In  fact, a co-inhabitant naturally has 
an even stronger claim.  No sensible person would enter shared prem-
ises based on one occupant's invitation when a fellow tenant said to stay 
out.  Such  reticence  would  show  not  timidity  but  a  realization  that 
when people living together disagree over the use of their common quar-
ters, a resolution  must  come through  voluntary  accommodation, not by 
appeals  to  authority.  Absent  some  recognized  hierarchy,  e. g.,  parent 
and  child,  there  is  no  societal  or  legal  understanding  of  superior  and 
inferior as between co-tenants.  Pp. 113-114. 

(d)  Thus,  a  disputed  invitation,  without  more,  gives  an  officer  no 
better  claim  to  reasonableness  in  entering  than  the  officer  would  have 
absent  any  consent.  Disputed  permission  is  no  match  for  the  Fourth 
Amendment  central  value  of  "respect  for  the  privacy  of  the  home," 
Wilson v.  Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 610, and the State's other countervailing 
claims do not add up to outweigh it. 

A co-tenant who has an interest in bringing criminal activity to light 
or in deflecting suspicion from himself can, e. g., tell  the police what he 
knows,  for  use  before  a  magistrate  in  getting  a  warrant.  This  case, 
which recognizes  limits  on evidentiary  searches, has no  bearing  on the 
capacity of the police, at the invitation of one tenant, to enter a dwelling 
over  another  tenant's  objection  in  order  to  protect  a  resident  from  do-
mestic  violence.  Though  alternatives  to  disputed  consent  will  not  al-
ways  open  the  door  to  search  for  evidence  that  the  police  suspect  is 
inside,  nothing  in  social  custom  or  its  reflection  in  private  law  argues 
for placing a higher value on delving into private premises to search for 
evidence in the face of disputed consent, than on requiring clear justifi-
cation  before  the  government  searches  private  living  quarters  over  a 
resident's objection.  Pp. 114-120. 

(e)  There are two loose ends.  First, while Matlock's explanation for 
the constitutional sufficiency of a co-tenant's consent to enter and search 
recognized  a  co-inhabitant's  "right  to  permit  the  inspection  in  his  own 
right,"  415  U. S.,  at  171,  n.  7,  the  right  to  admit  the  police  is  not  a 
right  as  understood  under  property  law.  It  is,  instead,  the  authority 
recognized  by  customary  social  usage  as  having  a  substantial  bearing 
on  Fourth  Amendment  reasonableness  in  specific  circumstances.  The 
question  here  is  whether  customary  social  understanding  accords  the 
consenting  tenant  authority to  prevail  over  the co-tenant's  objection,  a 
question Matlock did not answer.  Second, a fine line must be drawn to

Syllabus 
avoid undercutting Matlock--where the defendant, though not present, 
was in a squad car not far away--and Rodriguez--where the defendant 
was asleep in the apartment and could have been roused by a knock on 
the door; if a potential defendant with self-interest in objecting is in fact 
at the door and objects, the co-tenant's permission does not suffice for a 
reasonable  search,  whereas  the  potential  objector,  nearby  but  not  part 
of  the  threshold  colloquy,  loses  out.  Such  formalism  is  justified.  So 
long as there is no evidence that the police have removed the potentially 
objecting tenant from the entrance specifically to avoid a possible objec-
tion,  there  is  practical  value  in  the  simple  clarity  of  complementary 
rules,  one  recognizing  the  co-tenant's  permission  when  no  fellow  occu-
pant  is  on  hand,  the  other  according  dispositive  weight  to  the  fellow 
occupant's expressed contrary indication.  Pp. 120-122. 

(f)  Here,  respondent's  refusal  is  clear,  and  nothing  in  the  record 
justifies  the  search  on  grounds  independent  of  his  wife's  consent. 
Pp. 122-123.

Opinion of the Court 
On the morning of July 6, she complained to the police that after  a  domestic  dispute  her  husband  took  their  son  away, 

and  when  officers  reached  the  house  she  told  them  that  her husband was a cocaine user whose habit had caused financial 
troubles.  She mentioned the marital problems and said that she  and  their  son  had  only  recently  returned  after  a  stay 
of several weeks with her parents.  Shortly after the police 
arrived, Scott  Randolph returned and explained that he had removed  the  child  to  a  neighbor's  house  out  of  concern  that 

his wife  might take the  boy out  of the country  again; he  de-nied  cocaine  use,  and  countered  that  it  was  in  fact  his  wife 
who abused drugs and alcohol. 

One  of  the  officers,  Sergeant  Murray,  went  with  Janet 
Randolph  to  reclaim  the  child,  and  when  they  returned  she 
not  only  renewed  her  complaints  about  her  husband's  drug 
use,  but  also  volunteered  that  there  were  " `items  of  drug 
evidence' "  in  the  house.  Brief  for  Petitioner  3.  Sergeant 
Murray  asked  Scott  Randolph  for  permission  to  search  the 
house, which he unequivocally refused. 

The  sergeant  turned  to  Janet  Randolph  for  consent  to 
search, which she readily gave.  She led the officer upstairs 
to  a  bedroom  that  she  identified  as  Scott's,  where  the  ser-
geant  noticed  a  section  of  a  drinking  straw  with  a  powdery 
residue he suspected was cocaine.  He then left the house to 
get an evidence bag from his car and to call the district attor-
ney's  office,  which  instructed  him  to  stop  the  search  and 
apply  for  a  warrant.  When  Sergeant  Murray  returned  to 
the  house,  Janet  Randolph  withdrew  her  consent.  The 
police  took  the  straw  to  the  police  station,  along  with  the 
Randolphs.  After  getting  a  search  warrant,  they  returned 
to the house and seized further evidence of drug use, on the 
basis  of  which  Scott  Randolph  was  indicted  for  possession 
of cocaine. 

He moved to suppress the evidence, as products of a war-
rantless  search  of  his  house  unauthorized  by  his  wife's  con-
sent  over  his  express  refusal.  The  trial  court  denied  the

motion, ruling that Janet Randolph had common authority to consent to the search. 

The  Court  of  Appeals  of  Georgia  reversed,  264  Ga.  App. 396,  590  S.  E.  2d  834  (2003),  and  was  itself  sustained  by  the 
State  Supreme  Court,  principally  on  the  ground  that  "the consent to conduct a warrantless search of a residence given 
by  one  occupant  is  not  valid  in  the  face  of  the  refusal  of  an-other occupant who is physically present at the scene to per-
mit a warrantless search," 278 Ga. 614, 604 S. E. 2d 835, 836 (2004).  The  Supreme  Court  of  Georgia  acknowledged  this 
Court's  holding  in  Matlock,  415  U. S.  164,  that  "the  consent of  one  who  possesses  common  authority  over  premises  or 
effects  is  valid  as  against  the  absent,  nonconsenting  person with  whom  that  authority  is  shared," 

id.,  at  170,  and  found Matlock  distinguishable  just  because  Scott  Randolph  was 

not  "absent"  from  the  colloquy  on  which  the  police  relied for  consent  to  make  the  search.  The  State  Supreme  Court 
stressed  that  the  officers  in  Matlock  had  not  been  "faced with  the  physical  presence  of  joint  occupants,  with  one  con-
senting  to  the  search  and  the  other  objecting."  278  Ga.,  at 615,  604  S.  E.  2d,  at  837.  It  held  that  an  individual  who 
chooses  to  live with  another  assumes  a  risk  no  greater  than " `an  inability  to  control  access  to  the  premises  during  [his] 
absence,' "  ibid.  (quoting  3  W.  LaFave,  Search  and  Seizure $ 8.3(d),  p.  731  (3d  ed.  1996)  (hereinafter  LaFave)),  and  does 
not  contemplate  that  his  objection  to  a  request  to  search commonly shared premises, if made, will be overlooked. 

We  granted  certiorari  to  resolve  a  split  of  authority  on whether  one  occupant  may  give  law  enforcement  effective 
consent  to  search  shared  premises,  as  against  a  co-tenant who  is  present  and  states  a  refusal  to  permit  the  search.

U. S. 493, 499 (1958), recognizes the validity of searches with the  voluntary  consent  of  an  individual  possessing  authority, 
Rodriguez,  497  U. S.,  at  181.  That  person  might  be  the householder  against  whom  evidence  is  sought,  Schneckloth 
v.  Bustamonte, 412 U. S. 218, 222 (1973), or a fellow occupant who  shares  common  authority  over  property,  when  the  sus-
pect is absent, Matlock, supra, at 170, and the exception for consent  extends  even  to  entries  and  searches  with  the  per-
mission of a co-occupant whom the police reasonably, but er-roneously,  believe  to  possess  shared  authority  as  an  occu-
pant,  Rodriguez,  supra,  at  186.  None  of  our  co-occupant consent-to-search  cases,  however,  has  presented  the  further 
fact of a second occupant physically present and refusing per-mission  to  search,  and  later  moving  to  suppress  evidence  so 
obtained.2  The  significance  of  such  a  refusal  turns  on  the underpinnings of the co-occupant consent rule, as recognized 
since Matlock.  A 

The  defendant  in  that  case  was  arrested  in  the  yard  of  a house  where  he  lived  with  a  Mrs.  Graff  and  several  of  her

dressed  the  question,  the  majority  have  reached  that  conclusion  as  well. 
See,  e. g.,  Love  v.  State,  355  Ark.  334,  342,  138  S.  W.  3d  676,  680  (2003);

ing consent of all present co-occupants). 

2 Mindful of  the multiplicity of  living  arrangements, we vary the terms 

used to describe residential co-occupancies.  In so doing we do not mean, 
however, to suggest that the rule to be applied to them is similarly varied.

relatives,  and  was  detained  in  a  squad  car  parked  nearby. When the police went to the door, Mrs. Graff admitted them 

and  consented  to  a  search  of  the  house.  415  U. S.,  at  166. In resolving the defendant's objection to use of the evidence 
taken in the warrantless search, we said that "the consent of one  who  possesses  common  authority  over  premises  or  ef-
fects  is  valid  as  against  the  absent,  nonconsenting  person 
with whom that authority is shared."  Id., at 170.  Consist-ent  with  our  prior  understanding  that  Fourth  Amendment 

rights  are  not  limited  by  the  law  of  property,  cf.  Katz  v. 
United  States,  389  U. S.  347,  352-353  (1967),  we  explained 
that the third party's "common authority" is not synonymous with a technical property interest: 

"The  authority  which  justifies  the  third-party  consent does  not  rest  upon  the  law  of  property,  with  its  attend-
ant  historical and legal refinements,  but rests  rather on mutual use of the property by persons generally having 
joint  access  or  control  for  most  purposes,  so  that  it  is reasonable  to  recognize  that  any  of  the  co-inhabitants 
has  the  right  to  permit  the  inspection  in  his  own  right and  that  the  others  have  assumed  the  risk  that  one  of 
their  number  might  permit  the  common  area  to  be searched."  415 U. S., at 171, n. 7 (citations omitted). 

See  also  Frazier  v.  Cupp,  394  U. S.  731,  740  (1969)  ("[I]n allowing [his cousin to share use of a duffel bag] and in leav-
ing  it  in  his  house,  [the  suspect]  must  be  taken  to  have  as-sumed the risk that [the cousin] would allow someone else to 
look inside").  The common authority  that counts  under  the Fourth Amendment may thus be broader than the rights ac-
corded  by  property  law,  see  Rodriguez,  supra,  at  181-182 
(consent is sufficient when given by a person who reasonably 
appears  to  have  common  authority  but  who,  in  fact,  has  no 
property  interest  in  the  premises  searched),  although  its 
limits,  too,  reflect  specialized  tenancy  arrangements  appar-
ent  to  the  police,  see  Chapman  v.  United  States,  365  U. S.

Opinion of the Court 
610  (1961)  (landlord  could  not  consent  to  search  of  tenant's home). 

The  constant  element  in  assessing  Fourth  Amendment reasonableness  in  the  consent  cases,  then,  is  the  great  sig-
nificance  given  to  widely  shared  social  expectations,  which are  naturally  enough  influenced  by  the  law  of  property,  but 
not  controlled  by  its  rules.  Cf.  Rakas  v.  Illinois,  439  U. S. 128, 144, n. 12 (1978) (an expectation of privacy is reasonable 
if  it  has  "a  source  outside  of  the  Fourth  Amendment,  either by  reference  to  concepts  of  real  or  personal  property  law 
or  to  understandings  that  are  recognized  and  permitted  by society"). 

Matlock accordingly not only holds that a solitary co-inhabitant  may  sometimes  consent  to  a  search  of  shared 

premises,  but  stands  for  the  proposition  that  the  reasona-bleness  of  such  a  search  is  in  significant  part  a  function  of 
commonly  held  understanding  about  the  authority  that  co-inhabitants  may  exercise  in  ways  that  affect  each  other's 
interests.  B 

Matlock's example of common understanding is readily ap-parent.  When  someone  comes  to  the  door  of  a  domestic 
dwelling with a baby at her hip, as Mrs. Graff did, she shows that she belongs there, and that fact standing alone is enough 
to  tell  a  law  enforcement  officer  or  any  other  visitor  that  if she  occupies  the  place  along  with  others,  she  probably  lives 
there subject  to the  assumption tenants  usually make  about their  common  authority  when  they  share  quarters.  They 
understand  that  any  one  of  them  may  admit  visitors,  with the consequence that a guest obnoxious to one may neverthe-
less be admitted in his absence by another.  As Matlock put it, shared tenancy is understood to include an "assumption of 
risk,"  on  which  police  officers  are  entitled  to  rely,  and  al-though  some  group  living  together  might  make  an  excep-
tional arrangement that  no one could admit  a guest  without the agreement of all, the chance of such an eccentric scheme 
is  too  remote  to  expect  visitors  to  investigate  a  particular

Opinion of the Court 
household's  rules  before  accepting  an  invitation  to  come  in. 
So,  Matlock  relied  on  what  was  usual  and  placed  no  burden 
on the police to eliminate the possibility of atypical arrange-
ments,  in  the  absence  of  reason  to  doubt  that  the  regular 
scheme was in place. 

It  is  also  easy  to  imagine  different  facts  on  which,  if 
known,  no  common  authority  could  sensibly  be  suspected. 
A  person on the  scene who identifies  himself, say, as  a land-
lord or a hotel manager calls up no customary understanding 
of  authority to  admit guests  without  the  consent  of the  cur-
rent occupant.  See Chapman v.  United States, supra (land-
lord);  Stoner  v.  California,  376  U. S.  483  (1964)  (hotel  man-
ager).  A tenant in the ordinary course does not take rented 
premises  subject  to  any  formal  or  informal  agreement  that 
the  landlord  may  let  visitors  into  the  dwelling,  Chapman, 
supra, at 617, and a hotel guest customarily has no reason to 
expect  the  manager  to  allow  anyone  but  his  own  employees 
into  his  room,  see  Stoner,  supra,  at  489;  see  also  United 
States v.  Jeffers, 342 U. S. 48, 51 (1951) (hotel staff had access 
to  room  for  purposes  of  cleaning  and  maintenance,  but  no 
authority  to  admit  police).  In  these  circumstances,  neither 
state-law  property  rights,  nor  common  contractual  arrange-
ments, nor any other source points to a common understand-
ing of authority to admit third parties generally without the 
consent  of  a  person  occupying  the  premises.  And  when  it 
comes  to  searching  through  bureau  drawers,  there  will  be 
instances in which even a person clearly belonging on prem-
ises as an occupant may lack any perceived authority to con-
sent;  "a  child  of  eight  might  well  be  considered  to  have  the 
power  to  consent  to  the  police  crossing  the  threshold  into 
that part of the house where any caller, such as a pollster or 
salesman, might  well  be  admitted," 4  LaFave $ 8.4(c),  at 207 
(4th  ed.  2004),  but  no  one  would  reasonably  expect  such  a 
child  to  be  in  a  position  to  authorize  anyone  to  rummage 
through his parents' bedroom.

Opinion of the Court 

C 
Although  we  have  not  dealt  directly  with  the  reasonable-ness  of  police  entry  in  reliance  on  consent  by  one  occupant 

subject  to  immediate  challenge  by  another,  we  took  a  step toward  the  issue  in  an  earlier  case  dealing  with  the  Fourth 
Amendment rights of a social guest arrested at premises the police entered without a warrant or the benefit of any excep-
tion  to  the  warrant  requirement.  Minnesota  v.  Olson,  495 U. S. 91 (1990), held that overnight houseguests have a legiti-
mate expectation of privacy in their temporary quarters be-cause  "it  is  unlikely  that  [the  host]  will  admit  someone  who 
wants  to  see  or  meet  with  the  guest  over  the  objection  of the guest," id., at 99.  If that customary expectation of cour-
tesy  or  deference  is  a  foundation  of  Fourth  Amendment rights  of  a  houseguest,  it  presumably  should  follow  that  an 
inhabitant  of  shared  premises  may  claim  at  least  as  much, and it turns out that the co-inhabitant naturally has an even 
stronger claim. To begin with, it is fair to say that a caller standing at the 
door  of  shared  premises  would  have  no  confidence  that  one occupant's  invitation  was  a  sufficiently  good  reason  to  enter 
when a fellow tenant stood there  saying, "stay out."  With-out  some  very  good  reason,  no  sensible  person  would  go  in-
side under those conditions.  Fear for the safety of the occu-pant  issuing  the  invitation,  or  of  someone  else  inside,  would 
be  thought  to  justify  entry,  but  the  justification  then  would be  the  personal  risk,  the  threats  to  life  or  limb,  not  the  dis-
puted invitation.3 The  visitor's  reticence  without  some  such  good  reason 
would  show  not  timidity  but  a  realization  that  when  people living together  disagree over the  use of their  common quar-

limb"  and  indicating  that  police  may  conduct  a  warrantless  search  pro-
vided  that  the  search  is  " `strictly  circumscribed  by  the  exigencies  which 
justify its initiation' ").

ters, a  resolution must come through voluntary  accommoda-tion,  not  by  appeals  to  authority.  Unless  the  people  living 

together fall within some recognized hierarchy, like a house-hold of parent and child or barracks housing military person-
nel of different grades, there is  no  societal understanding of superior and inferior, a fact reflected in a standard formula-
tion  of  domestic  property  law,  that  "[e]ach  cotenant  .  .  .  has the right to use and enjoy the entire property as if he or she 
were  the  sole  owner,  limited  only  by  the  same  right  in  the other  cotenants."  7  R.  Powell,  Powell  on  Real  Property 

$ 50.03[1], p. 50-14 (M. Wolf gen. ed. 2005).  The want of any recognized  superior  authority  among  disagreeing  tenants  is 
also  reflected  in  the  law's  response  when  the  disagreements cannot be resolved.  The  law does not  ask  who  has  the  bet-
ter  side  of  the  conflict;  it  simply  provides  a  right  to  any co-tenant,  even  the  most  unreasonable,  to  obtain  a  decree 
partitioning  the  property  (when  the  relationship  is  one  of co-ownership) and terminating the relationship.  See, 

e. g., 2 H.  Tiffany,  Real  Property  $$ 468,  473,  474,  pp.  297,  307-309 

(3d  ed.  1939  and  2006  Cum.  Supp.).  And  while  a  decree  of partition  is  not  the  answer  to  disagreement  among  rental 
tenants, this situation resembles co-ownership in lacking the benefit  of  any  understanding  that  one  or  the  other  rental 
co-tenant has a superior claim to control the use of the quar-ters  they  occupy  together.  In  sum,  there  is  no  common 
understanding  that  one  co-tenant  generally  has  a  right  or authority  to  prevail  over  the  express  wishes  of  another, 
whether  the  issue  is  the  color  of  the  curtains  or  invitations to outsiders. 

D 
Since  the  co-tenant  wishing  to  open  the  door  to  a  third party has no recognized authority in law or social practice to 

prevail  over  a  present  and  objecting  co-tenant,  his  disputed invitation, without more, gives a police officer no better claim 
to reasonableness in  entering than  the officer  would  have in the  absence  of  any  consent  at  all.  Accordingly,  in  the  bal-

ancing  of  competing  individual  and  governmental  interests entailed by the bar to unreasonable searches, Camara v.  Mu-

nicipal  Court  of  City  and  County  of  San  Francisco,  387 U. S.  523,  536-537  (1967),  the  cooperative  occupant's  invita-
tion  adds  nothing  to  the  government's  side  to  counter  the force  of  an  objecting  individual's  claim  to  security  against 
the  government's  intrusion  into  his  dwelling  place.  Since we hold to the "centuries-old principle of respect for the pri-
vacy of the home," Wilson v.  Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 610 (1999), "it is beyond dispute that the home is entitled to special pro-
tection as the center of the private lives of our people," Min-

inal  activity  to  light,  see  Coolidge, 403  U. S.,  at  488  ("[I]t  is no part of the policy underlying the Fourth . . . Amendmen[t] 

to discourage citizens from aiding to the utmost of their abil-ity  in  the  apprehension  of  criminals").  And  we  understand 
a co-tenant's legitimate self-interest in siding with the police to deflect suspicion raised by  sharing quarters with a  crimi-
nal,  see  4  LaFave  $ 8.3(d),  at  162,  n.  72  ("The  risk  of  being convicted  of  possession  of  drugs  one  knows  are  present  and 
has tried to get the other occupant to remove is by no means insignificant"); cf. 

Schneckloth, 412 U. S., at 243 (evidence ob-tained  pursuant  to  a  consent  search  "may  insure  that  a 

wholly innocent person is not wrongly charged with a crimi-nal offense"). 

But  society  can  often  have  the  benefit  of  these  interests without relying on a theory of consent that ignores an inhab-
itant's refusal to allow a warrantless search.  The co-tenant acting  on  his  own  initiative  may  be  able  to  deliver  evidence 
to the  police,  Coolidge, supra,  at 487-489  (suspect's wife  re-trieved  his  guns  from  the  couple's  house  and  turned  them 
over to the police), and can tell the police what he knows, for use before a magistrate in getting a warrant.

6 Sometimes,  of  course,  the  very  exchange  of  information  like  this  in 
front of the objecting inhabitant may render consent irrelevant by creating 
an exigency that justifies immediate action on the police's part; if the ob-
jecting  tenant  cannot  be  incapacitated  from  destroying  easily  disposable 
evidence  during  the  time  required  to  get  a  warrant,  see  Illinois  v. 
McArthur,  531  U. S.  326,  331-332  (2001)  (denying  suspect  access  to  his 
trailer home while police applied for a search warrant), a fairly perceived 
need to act on the spot to preserve evidence may justify entry and search 
under  the  exigent  circumstances  exception  to  the  warrant  requirement, 
cf.  Schmerber  v.  California,  384  U. S.  757,  770-771  (1966)  (warrant-
less  search  permitted  when  "the  delay  necessary  to  obtain  a  warrant 
.  .  .  threatened  the  destruction  of  evidence"  (internal  quotation  marks 
omitted)). 

Additional  exigent  circumstances  might  justify  warrantless  searches. 
See,  e. g.,  Warden,  Md.  Penitentiary v.  Hayden,  387  U. S.  294,  298  (1967)

on  a  co-tenant's  information  instead  of  disputed  consent  ac-cords with the  law's general  partiality toward "police  action

(1965); "the  informed and deliberate determinations of mag-istrates  empowered  to  issue  warrants  as  to  what  searches

Nor  should  this  established  policy  of  Fourth  Amendment law  be  undermined  by  the  principal  dissent's  claim  that  it

victims  ask  the  police  for  help,  post,  at  138  (opinion  of  Rob-

Wrongs and the Bill of "Rights": A Bicentennial Perspective, 
59  U.  Chi.  L.  Rev.  453,  507-508  (1992)  (noting  that  women 
may  feel  physical  insecurity  in  their  homes  as  a  result  of 
abuse from domestic partners). 

But  this  case  has  no  bearing  on  the  capacity  of  the  police 
to  protect  domestic  victims.  The  dissent's  argument  rests 
on  the  failure  to  distinguish  two  different  issues:  when  the 
police  may  enter  without  committing  a  trespass,  and  when 
the  police  may  enter  to  search  for  evidence.  No  question 
has  been raised, or  reasonably could  be, about  the  authority 
of  the  police  to  enter  a  dwelling  to  protect  a  resident  from 
domestic  violence;  so  long  as  they  have  good  reason  to  be-
lieve  such  a  threat  exists,  it  would  be  silly  to  suggest  that 
the  police  would  commit  a  tort  by  entering,  say,  to  give  a 
complaining tenant the opportunity to collect belongings and 
get out safely, or to determine whether violence (or threat of 
violence) has just occurred or is about to (or soon will) occur, 
however  much  a  spouse  or  other  co-tenant  objected.  (And 
since the police would then be lawfully in the premises, there 
is  no  question  that  they  could  seize  any  evidence  in  plain 
view  or  take  further  action  supported  by  any  consequent 
probable  cause,  see  Texas  v.  Brown,  460  U. S.  730,  737-739 
(1983)  (plurality  opinion).)  Thus,  the  question  whether  the 
police might lawfully enter over objection in order to provide 
any  protection  that  might  be  reasonable  is  easily  answered 
yes.  See  4  LaFave  $ 8.3(d),  at  161  ("[E]ven  when . . . two  
persons quite clearly have equal rights in the place, as where

lice to enter in order to protect a victim, however, has noth-ing  to  do  with  the  question  in  this  case,  whether  a  search 

with  the  consent  of  one  co-tenant  is  good  against  another, standing at the door and expressly refusing consent.

None of the cases cited by the dissent support its improb-able  view  that  recognizing  limits  on  merely  evidentiary 

searches would compromise the capacity to protect a fearful 
occupant.  In  the  circumstances  of  those  cases,  there  is  no danger  that  the  fearful  occupant  will  be  kept  behind  the 

closed  door  of  the  house  simply  because  the  abusive  tenant refuses to consent to a search.  See 

United States v.  Donlin,

7 We understand the possibility that a battered individual will be afraid 
to  express  fear  candidly,  but  this  does  not  seem  to  be  a  reason  to  think 
such  a  person  would  invite the police  into the  dwelling to  search  for evi-
dence  against  another.  Hence,  if  a  rule  crediting  consent  over  denial  of 
consent were built on hoping to protect household victims, it would distort 
the Fourth Amendment with little, if any, constructive effect on domestic 
abuse investigations.

120  GEORGIA  v.  RANDOLPH 

Opinion of the Court 
The  dissent's  red  herring  aside,  we  know,  of  course,  that alternatives  to  disputed  consent  will  not  always  open  the 

door  to  search  for  evidence  that  the  police  suspect  is  inside. The consenting tenant may simply not disclose enough infor-
mation,  or  information  factual  enough,  to  add  up  to  a  show-ing  of  probable  cause,  and  there  may  be  no  exigency  to 
justify  fast  action.  But  nothing  in  social  custom  or  its  re-flection  in  private  law  argues  for  placing  a  higher  value  on 
delving  into  private  premises  to  search  for  evidence  in  the face of disputed consent, than on requiring clear justification 
before the government searches private living quarters over a resident's objection.  We therefore hold that a warrantless 
search  of  a  shared  dwelling  for  evidence  over  the  express refusal of consent by a physically present resident cannot be 
justified as reasonable as to him on the basis of consent given to the police by another resident.

There  are  two  loose  ends,  the  first  being  the  explanation given  in 

Matlock  for  the  constitutional  sufficiency  of  a  co-tenant's consent  to enter and search: it "rests  . . . on mutual 

use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes, so that it is reasonable to recog-
nize  that  any  of  the  co-inhabitants  has  the  right  to  permit the inspection in his own right . . . ."   415  U.  S.,  at  171, n. 7. 
If  Matlock's  co-tenant  is  giving  permission  "in  his  own right,"  how  can  his  "own  right"  be  eliminated  by  another 
tenant's  objection?  The  answer  appears  in  the  very  foot-note  from  which  the  quoted  statement  is  taken:  the  "right" 
to admit the police to which Matlock refers is not an endur-ing  and  enforceable  ownership  right  as  understood  by  the 

8 The dissent is critical that our holding does not pass upon the constitu-
tionality  of  such  a  search  as  to  a  third  tenant  against  whom  the  govern-
ment  wishes  to  use  evidence  seized  after  a  search  with  consent  of  one 
co-tenant  subject  to  the  contemporaneous  objection  of  another,  post,  at 
137.  We decide the case before us, not a different one.

Opinion of the Court 
private  law  of  property,  but  is  instead  the  authority  recog-nized by customary social usage as having a substantial bear-

ing on Fourth Amendment reasonableness in specific circum-stances.  Thus, to ask whether the consenting tenant has the 
right  to  admit  the  police  when  a  physically  present  fellow tenant  objects  is  not  to  question  whether  some  property 
right may be divested by the mere objection of another.  It 
is,  rather,  the  question  whether  customary  social  under-standing  accords  the  consenting  tenant  authority  powerful 

enough  to  prevail  over  the  co-tenant's  objection.  The  Mat-
lock  Court  did  not  purport  to  answer  this  question,  a  point 
made clear by another statement (which the dissent does not 
quote):  the  Court  described  the  co-tenant's  consent  as  good 
against  "the  absent,  nonconsenting"  resident.  Id.,  at  170. 

The  second  loose  end  is  the  significance  of  Matlock  and 
Rodriguez after today's decision.  Although the Matlock de-
fendant  was  not  present  with  the  opportunity  to  object,  he 
was  in  a  squad  car  not  far  away;  the  Rodriguez  defendant 
was  actually  asleep  in  the  apartment,  and  the  police  might 
have  roused  him  with  a  knock  on  the  door  before  they  en-
tered  with  only  the  consent  of  an  apparent  co-tenant.  If 
those  cases  are  not  to  be  undercut  by  today's  holding,  we 
have  to  admit  that  we  are  drawing  a  fine  line;  if  a  potential 
defendant with self-interest in objecting is in fact at the door 
and objects, the co-tenant's permission does not suffice  for a 
reasonable  search,  whereas  the  potential  objector,  nearby 
but not invited to take part i n the  threshold colloquy, 
loses out. 

This  is  the  line  we  draw,  and  we  think  the  formalism  is 
justified.  So  long  as  there  is  no  evidence  that  the  police 
have  removed  the  potentially  objecting  tenant  from  the  en-
trance  for  the  sake  of avoiding  a  possible  objection,  there  is 
practical value in the simple clarity of complementary rules, 
one  recognizing  the  co-tenant's  permission  when  there  is  no 
fellow  occupant  on  hand,  the  other  according  dispositive 
weight  to  the  fellow  occupant's  contrary  indication  when  he

Opinion of the Court 
expresses  it.  For  the  very  reason  that  Rodriguez  held  it would  be  unjustifiably  impractical  to  require  the  police  to 

take  affirmative  steps  to  confirm  the  actual  authority  of  a consenting  individual  whose  authority  was  apparent,  we 
think  it  would  needlessly  limit  the  capacity  of  the  police  to respond  to  ostensibly  legitimate  opportunities  in  the  field  if 
we  were  to  hold  that  reasonableness  required  the  police  to take  affirmative  steps  to  find  a  potentially  objecting  co-
tenant before  acting on  the permission  they  had  already  re-ceived.  There  is  no  ready  reason  to  believe  that  efforts  to 
invite  a  refusal  would  make  a  difference  in  many  cases, whereas every co-tenant consent case would turn into a test 
about  the  adequacy  of  the  police's  efforts  to  consult  with  a potential objector.  Better to accept the formalism of distin-
guishing  Matlock  from  this  case  than  to  impose  a  require-ment, time consuming in the field and in the courtroom, with 
no  apparent  systemic  justification.  The  pragmatic  decision to  accept  the  simplicity  of  this  line  is,  moreover,  supported 
by  the  substantial  number  of  instances  in  which  suspects who  are  asked  for  permission  to  search  actually  consent,

9 

albeit  imprudently, a  fact that undercuts  any argument  that the police should try to locate a suspected inhabitant because 

his denial of consent would be a foregone conclusion. 

III 
This  case invites a  straightforward  application  of the rule that a physically present inhabitant's express refusal of con-

sent to a police search  is dispositive  as to him, regardless of

mainstream  water  in  each  State,  and  their  priority  dates, 
any  party  may  apply  to  the  Court  for  the  determination  of 
such rights by the Court.  A list of present perfected rights, 
with  priority  dates,  in  waters  of  the  mainstream  in  the

(1)  The  following listed  present perfected  rights relate  to 
the  quantity  of  water  which  may  be  used  by  each  claimant and  the  list  is  not  intended  to  limit  or  redefine  the  type  of 

use otherwise set forth in this decree. (2)  This  determination  shall  in  no  way  affect  future  ad-

stream water to satisfy present perfected rights pursuant to 
Article  II(B)(3)  of  this  decree,  the  Secretary  of  the  Interior shall, before providing for the satisfaction of any of the other 

present  perfected  rights  except  for  those  listed  herein  as "MISCELLANEOUS  PRESENT  PERFECTED  RIGHTS"

Opinion of the Court 

I 
Petitioner Patrick  A. Day  was convicted  of second-degree murder and sentenced to 55 years in prison by a Florida trial 

court.  Day  unsuccessfully  appealed  the  sentence,  which was  affirmed  on  December  21,  1999.  Day  did  not  seek  this 
Court's  review  of  the  final  state-court  decision;  his  time  to do so expired on March 20, 2000. 

Three hundred and fifty-three (353) days later, Day unsuc-cessfully  sought  state  postconviction  relief.  The  Florida 
trial court's judgment denying relief was affirmed on appeal, and  the  appellate  court  issued  its  mandate  on  December  3, 
2002.  See  Nyland

$ 503.3.2.1 (Mar. 16, 2006), and the use of certified mail might make actual  notice  less likely  in  some cases--the  letter  can-
not be left like regular mail to be examined at the end of the day,  and  it  can  only  be  retrieved  from  the  post  office  for  a 
specified  period  of  time.  Following  up  with  regular  mail 
might also increase the chances of actual notice to Jones if-- as  it  turned  out--he  had  moved.  Even  occupants  who  ig-

nored  certified  mail  notice  slips  addressed  to  the  owner  (if any had been left) might scrawl the owner's new address on 
the notice packet and leave it for the postman to retrieve, or 
notify Jones directly. 

Other reasonable followup measures, directed at the possi-
bility  that  Jones  had  moved  as  well  as  that  he  had  simply 
not  retrieved  the  certified  letter,  would  have  been  to  post 
notice on the front door, or to address otherwise undelivera-
ble  mail  to  "occupant."  Most  States  that  explicitly  outline 
additional  procedures  in  their  tax  sale  statutes  require  just 
such  steps.  See  n.  2,  supra.

Opinion of the Court 
than  taking  relatively  easy  additional  steps  to  effect  notice, 
the State undertook the burden and expense of purchasing a 
newspaper  advertisement,  conducting  an  auction,  and  then 
negotiating a private sale of the property to Flowers. 

The Solicitor  General argues  that  requiring  further effort 
when  the  government  learns  that  notice  was  not  delivered 
will cause the government to favor modes of providing notice 
that do not generate additional information--for  example, 
starting (and stopping) with regular mail instead of certified 
mail.  We  find  this  unlikely,  as  we  have  no  doubt  that  the 
government repeatedly finds itself being asked to prove that 
notice was sent and received.  Using certified mail provides 
the  State  with  documentation  of  personal  delivery  and  pro-
tection  against  false  claims  that  notice  was  never  received. 
That  added  security,  however,  comes  at  a  price--the  State 
also learns when notice has not

Opinion of the Court 
Congress and Government research officers had reservations about  the  Postal  Service's  Zip  +  4  policy  and  its  intended 

reliance on single-line readers.  Critics maligned single-line scanning  technology,  objected  to  the  foreign  sources  of 
single-line scanners, decried the burden of remembering the four  extra  numbers,

1  and  echoed  the  conclusion  reached  by 

the United States Office of Technology Assessment, that use of the single-line scanners in preference to multiliners would 

cost the Postal Service $1 million a day in operational losses. Moore  built  on  this  opposition  to  Zip  +  4,  by  lobbying 
Members  of  Congress,  testifying  before  congressional  com-mittees,  and  supporting  a  "Buy  American"  rider  to  the 
Postal  Service's  1985  appropriations  bill.  Notwithstanding alleged requests by the Postmaster General to be quiet, REI 
followed  its  agenda  by  hiring  a  public-relations  firm,  Gnau and Associates, Inc. (GAI), which one of the Postal Service's 
governors, Peter Voss, had recommended. The campaign succeeded, and in July 1985 the Postal Serv-
ice  made  what  it  called  a  "mid-course  correction"  and  em-braced  multiline  technology.  Brief  for  Respondent  4.  But 
the  change  of  heart  did  not  extend  to  Moore  and  REI,  for the  Service's  ensuing  order  of  multiline  equipment,  valued 
somewhere between $250 million and $400 million, went to a competing firm. 

Not only did  REI lose  out on the contract, but Moore  and REI  were  soon  entangled  in  two  investigations  by  Postal 
Service inspectors.  The first looked into the purported pay-ment  of  kickbacks  by  GAI  to  Governor  Voss  for  Voss's  rec-
ommendations  of  GAI's  services,  as  in  the  case  of  REI;  the second  sought  to  document  REI's  possibly  improper  role  in 
the search for a new Postmaster General.  Notwithstanding very limited evidence linking Moore and REI to any wrong-

causation,  namely  evidence  showing  whether  there  was  or was not probable cause to bring the criminal charge.  Dem-
onstrating that there was no probable cause for the underly-ing criminal charge will tend to reinforce the retaliation evi-
dence  and  show  that  retaliation  was  the  but-for  basis  for instigating  the  prosecution,  while establishing  the  existence 
of  probable  cause  will  suggest  that  prosecution  would  have occurred even without a retaliatory motive.  This alone does

Opinion of the Court 
Accordingly, the  significance of probable  cause or  the  lack of it looms large, being a potential feature of every case, with 

obvious  evidentiary  value.  True,  it  is  not  necessarily  dis-positive:  showing  an  absence  of  probable  cause  may  not  be 
conclusive  that  the  inducement  succeeded,  and  showing  its presence  does  not  guarantee  that  inducement  was  not  the 
but-for fact in a prosecutor's decision.  But a retaliatory mo-
tive  on  the  part  of  an  official  urging  prosecution  combined with  an  absence  of  probable  cause  supporting  the  prosecu-

tor's  decision  to  go  forward  are  reasonable  grounds  to  sus-pend the presumption of regularity behind the charging deci-
sion,  see  Bordenkircher

aspersions  cast  upon  Ahlborn  are  entirely  unsupported;  all  the  record 
reveals is that ADHS neither asked to be nor was involved in the settle-
ment  negotiations.  Whatever  the  bounds  of  the  duty  to  cooperate, 
there  is  no  evidence  that  it  was  breached  here.  Although  more  color-
able,  the  alternative  argument  that  a  rule  of  full  reimbursement  is 
needed generally to avoid the risk of settlement manipulation also fails. 
The risk that parties to a tort suit will allocate away the State's interest 
can  be  avoided  either  by  obtaining  the  State's  advance  agreement  to 
an  allocation  or,  if  necessary,  by  submitting  the  matter  to  a  court  for 
decision.  Pp. 287-288.

corded insufficient weight to two decisions by the Departmental Appeals 
Board (Board) of the federal Department of Health and Human Services 
(HHS)  rejecting  appeals  by  two  States  from  denial  of  reimbursement 
for costs they paid on behalf of Medicaid recipients who had settled tort 
claims.  Although HHS generally has broad regulatory authority in the 
Medicaid area, the Court declines to treat the Board's reasoning in those 
cases as controlling because they address a different question from the 
one posed here, make no mention of the anti-lien provision, and rest on 
a  questionable  construction  of  the  federal  third-party  liability  provi-
sions.  Pp. 289-292.

vere  and  permanent  injuries  as  a  result  of  a  car  accident. 
She  was  left  brain  damaged,  unable  to  complete  her  college 
education, and incapable of pursuing her chosen career.  Al-
though  she  possessed  a  claim  of  uncertain  value  against  the 
alleged tortfeasors who caused her injuries, Ahlborn's liquid 
assets  were  insufficient  to  pay  for  her  medical  care.  Peti-
tioner Arkansas  Department  of  Health  and Human  Services 
(ADHS) 1  accordingly  determined  that  she  was  eligible  for 
medical assistance and paid providers $215,645.30 on her be-
half under the State's Medicaid plan. 

ADHS  required  Ahlborn  to  complete  a  questionnaire 
about  her  accident,  and  sent  her  attorney  periodic  letters 
advising  him  about  Medicaid  outlays.  These  letters  noted 
that,  under  Arkansas  law,  ADHS  had  a  claim  to  reimburse-
ment  from  "any  settlement,  judgment,  or  award"  obtained 
by  Ahlborn  from  "a  third  party  who  may  be  liable  for"  her 
injuries,  and  that  no  settlement  "shall  be  satisfied  without 
first  giving  [ADHS]  notice  and  a  reasonable  opportunity  to 
establish  its  interest." 2  ADHS  has  never  asserted,  how-
ever,  that  Ahlborn  has  a  duty  to  reimburse  it  out  of  any 
other subsequently acquired assets or earnings. 

On  April  11,  1997,  Ahlborn  filed  suit  against  two  alleged 
tortfeasors in Arkansas state court seeking compensation for 
the  injuries  she  sustained  in  the  January  1996  car  accident. 
She claimed damages not only for past medical costs, but also 
for permanent physical injury; future medical expenses; past 
and  future  pain,  suffering,  and  mental  anguish;  past  loss  of 
earnings  and  working  time;  and  permanent  impairment  of 
the ability to earn in the future. 

ADHS was neither named as a party nor formally notified 
of  the  suit.  Ahlborn's  counsel  did,  however,  keep  ADHS 
informed  of  details  concerning  insurance  coverage  as  they 
became known during the litigation.

The  crux  of  the  parties'  dispute  lies  in  their  competing 
constructions  of  the  federal  Medicaid  laws.  The  Medicaid 
program,  which  provides  joint  federal  and  state  funding  of 
medical  care  for  individuals  who  cannot  afford  to  pay  their 
own medical costs, was launched in 1965 with the enactment

Arkansas statute, ADHS could recover the full $20,000 in the face  of  a  jury  allocation  of,  say,  only  $10,000  for  medical

the  relevant  " liability"  extends  no  further  than  that amount.

10 

Second,  ADHS  argues  that  the  language  of  $ 1396a(a) (25)(H)  favors  its  view  that  it  can  demand  full  reimburse-

ment  of  its  costs  from  Ahlborn's  settlement.  That  provi-sion,  which  echoes  the  requirement  of  a  mandatory  assign-
ment  of  rights  in  $ 1396k(a),  says  that  the  State  must  have in  effect  laws  that,  "to  the  extent  that  payment  has  been 
made  under  the  State  plan  for  medical  assistance  for  health care  items  or  services  furnished  to  an  individual,"  give  the 
State  the  right  to  recover  from  liable  third  parties.  This must mean, says ADHS, that the agency's recovery is limited 
only  by  the  amount  it  paid  out  on  the  recipient's  behalf-- and not by the third-party tortfeasor's particular liability for 
medical  expenses.  But  that  reading  ignores the  rest  of  the provision, which makes clear that the State must be assigned 
"the  rights of  [the  recipient]  to  payment  by  any other  party

IV 
If  there  were  no  other  relevant  provisions  in  the  federal statute, the State might plausibly argue that federal law sup-

plied a recovery "floor" upon which States were free to build. In  fact,  though,  the  federal  statute  places  express  limits  on 
the  State's  powers  to  pursue  recovery  of  funds  it  paid  on the recipient's behalf.  These limitations are contained in 42 
U. S. C.  $$ 1396a(a)(18)  and  1396p.  Section  1396a(a)(18)  re-quires that a state Medicaid plan comply with $ 1396p, which 
in turn prohibits States (except in circumstances not relevant here) from placing liens against, or seeking recovery of bene-
fits paid from, a Medicaid recipient: 

"(a)  Imposition of lien against  property of an individ-ual  on  account  of  medical  assistance  rendered  to  him 

under a State plan "(1)  No  lien  may  be  imposed  against  the  property  of 
any  individual  prior  to  his  death  on  account  of  medical assistance  paid  or  to  be  paid  on  his  behalf  under  the 
State plan, except-- "(A)  pursuant  to  the  judgment  of  a  court  on  account 
of  benefits  incorrectly  paid  on  behalf  of  such  individual, or 

"(B)  [in certain circumstances not relevant here] . . . . . 
"(b)  Adjustment  or  recovery  of  medical  assistance correctly paid under a State plan

$$ 1396a(a)(25) and 1396k(a) is limited to payments for medi-cal care.  Beyond that, the anti-lien provision applies. 

ADHS tries to avoid the anti-lien provision by characteriz-ing  the  settlement  proceeds  as  not  Ahlborn's  "property." 

14 

Its  argument  appears  to  be  that  the  automatic  assignment effected  by  the  Arkansas  statute  rendered  the  proceeds 

the  property  of  the  State.15  See  Brief  for  Petitioners  31 ("[U]nder Arkansas law, the lien does not attach to the recip-
ient's  `property'  because  it  attaches  only  to  those  proceeds already  assigned  to  the  Department  as  a  condition  of  Med-
icaid  eligibility").  That  argument  fails  for  two  reasons. First, ADHS insists that Ahlborn at all times until judgment 
retained her entire chose in action--a right that included her claim for medical damages.  The statutory lien, then, cannot 
have  attached  until  the  proceeds  materialized.  That  much is  clear  from  the  text  of  the  Arkansas  statute,  which  says 
that the  "assignment  shall  be  considered  a  statutory  lien  on any  settlement  .  .  .

presented here.  The Board was concerned with the Federal Government's obligation to reimburse States that had, in its 

view, failed to seek full recovery of Medicaid's costs and had instead  relied  on  recipients  to  act  as  private  attorneys  gen-
eral.  The Board neither discussed nor even so much as cited the federal anti-lien provision. 

Second,  the  Board's  acknowledgment  that  the  assignment 
of  rights  required  by  $ 1396k(a)  is  limited  to  payments  for medical care  only reinforces the  clarity  of the  statutory  lan-

guage.  Moreover,  its  resort  to  "the  statutory  scheme  as  a whole"  as  justification  for  muddying  that  clarity  is  nowhere 
explained.  Given  that  the  only  statutory  provisions  CMS 
relied  on  are  $$ 1396a(a)(25),  1396k(a),  and  1396k(b),  see  id.,

serting  that  Vickie's  tortious  interference  claim  could  be  tried  only  in 
the Texas probate proceedings.  The Bankruptcy Court denied the mo-
tion.  Relying  on  Markham,  the  Bankruptcy  Court  observed  that  a 
federal  court  has  jurisdiction  to  adjudicate  rights  in  probate  property, 
so  long  as  its  final  judgment  does  not  interfere  with  the  state  court's 
possession  of  the  property.  Subsequently,  the  Texas  Probate  Court 
declared that J. Howard's estate plan was valid. 

Back in the federal forum, Pierce sought district-court review of the 
Bankruptcy Court's judgment.  Among other things, the District Court 
held  that  the  probate  exception  did  not  reach  Vickie's  counterclaim. 
Citing  Markham,  326  U. S.,  at  494,  the  court  said  that  the  exception 
would bar federal jurisdiction only if such jurisdiction would "interfere" 
with the probate proceedings.  It would not do so, the court concluded, 
because: (1) success on Vickie's counterclaim did not necessitate any dec-
laration that J. Howard's will was invalid, and (2) under Texas law, pro-
bate courts do not have exclusive jurisdiction to entertain claims of the 
kind  Vickie's  counterclaim  asserted.  The  court  also  held  that  Vickie's 
claim did not qualify as a "core proceedin[g]" over which a bankruptcy 
court may exercise plenary power, see 28 U. S. C. $ 157(b)-(c).  Accord-
ingly,  the  District  Court  treated  the  Bankruptcy  Court's  judgment  as 
proposed,  rather  than  final,  and  undertook  de  novo  review.  Adopting 
and supplementing the Bankruptcy Court's findings, the District Court 
determined  that  Pierce  had  tortiously  interfered  with  Vickie's  expec-
tancy  by,  inter  alia,  conspiring  to  suppress  or  destroy  the  inter  vivos 
trust  instrument  J.  Howard  had  directed  his  lawyers  to  prepare  for 
Vickie, and to strip J. Howard of his assets by backdating, altering, and 
otherwise falsifying documents and presenting them to J. Howard under 
false pretenses.  The District Court awarded Vickie some $44.3 million 
in  compensatory  damages  and,  based  on  "overwhelming"  evidence  of 
Pierce's  willfulness, maliciousness,  and fraud, an equal amount in puni-
tive damages. 

The  Ninth  Circuit  reversed.  Although  the  Court  of  Appeals  recog-
nized that Vickie's claim does not involve the administration of an estate, 
the probate of a will, or any other purely probate matter, it nonetheless 
held  that  the  probate  exception  bars  federal  jurisdiction  in  this  case. 
It read the exception broadly to exclude from the federal courts' adjudi-
catory  authority  not  only  direct  challenges  to  a  will  or  trust,  but  also 
questions  which  would  ordinarily  be  decided  by  a  probate  court  in  de-
termining  the  validity  of  the  decedent's  estate  planning  instrument, 
whether  those  questions  involve  fraud,  undue  influence,  or  tortious  in-

matter,  including  claims  respecting  tax  liability,  debt,  gift,  and  tort. 
Noting  that  the  Probate  Court  had  ruled  it  had  exclusive  jurisdiction 
over all of Vickie's claims, the Ninth Circuit held that ruling binding on 
the Federal District Court. 
Held:  The  Ninth  Circuit  had  no  warrant  from  Congress,  or  from  this 

Court's  decisions,  for  its  sweeping  extension  of  the  probate  exception 
recognized  in  those  decisions.  Because  this  case  does  not  fall  within 
the exception's scope, the District  Court properly asserted jurisdiction 
over Vickie's counterclaim against Pierce.  Pp. 305-315. 

(a)  Ankenbrandt addressed the domestic relations exception's deriva-
tion and limits.  Among other things, the Court, 504 U. S.,  at 693-695, 
traced the current exception to Barber v.  Barber, 21 How. 582, 584-589, 
in which the Court had announced in dicta--without citation or discus-
sion--that  federal  courts  lack  jurisdiction  over  suits  for  divorce  or  ali-
mony.  Finding no  Article III impediment to federal-court jurisdiction 
in  domestic  relations  cases,  504  U. S.,  at  695-697,  the  Ankenbrandt 
Court,  id.,  at  698-701,  anchored  the  exception  in  the  Judiciary  Act  of 
1789, which, until 1948, provided circuit-court diversity jurisdiction over 
"all  suits  of  a  civil  nature  at  common  law  or  in  equity."  The  Barber 
majority,  the  Ankenbrandt  Court  acknowledged,  504  U. S.,  at  698,  did 
not expressly tie its announcement of a domestic relations exception to 
the  text  of  the  diversity  statute,  but  the  Barber  dissenters  made  the 
connection.  Because English chancery courts lacked authority to issue 
divorce and alimony decrees, the dissenters stated, United States courts 
similarly lacked authority to decree divorces or award alimony, 21 How., 
at 605.  The Ankenbrandt Court was "content" "to rest [its] conclusion 
that a domestic relations exception exists as a matter of statutory con-
struction not on the accuracy of [Barber's] historical justifications," but, 
"rather," on "Congress' apparent acceptance of this construction of the 
diversity  jurisdiction  provisions  in  the  years  prior  to  1948,"  504  U. S., 
at 700.  Ankenbrandt further determined that Congress did not intend 
to  terminate  the  exception  in  1948  when  it  "replace[d]  the  law/equity 
distinction  with  the  phrase  `all  civil  actions.' "  Ibid.  The  Anken-
brandt  Court  nevertheless  emphasized  that  the  exception  covers  only 
"a narrow range of domestic relations issues."  Id., at 701.  Noting that 
some  lower  federal  courts  had  applied  the  exception  "well  beyond  the 
circumscribed  situations  posed  by  Barber  and  its  progeny,"  ibid.,  the 
Court  clarified  that  only  "divorce,  alimony,  and  child  custody  decrees" 
remain outside federal jurisdictional bounds, id., at 703, 704.  While rec-
ognizing state tribunals' "special proficiency" in handling issues arising 
in  the  granting  of  such  decrees,  id.,  at  704,  the  Court  viewed  federal 
courts as equally equipped  to deal  with complaints  alleging torts,  ibid.

296  MARSHALL  v.  MARSHALL 

Syllabus 
(b)  This Court has recognized a probate exception, kin to the domes-
tic  relations  exception,  to  otherwise  proper  federal  jurisdiction.  See, 
e. g.,  Markham,  the  Court's  most  recent  and  pathmarking  pronounce-
ment  on  the  subject.  Among  other  things,  the  Markham  Court  first 
stated  that,  although  "a  federal  court  has  no  jurisdiction  to  probate  a 
will or administer an estate, . . . it has [long] been established . . . that 
federal  courts of equity  have  jurisdiction to  entertain  suits  `in favor  of 
creditors,  legatees  and  heirs'  and  other  claimants  against  a  decedent's 
estate  `to  establish  their  claims'  so  long  as  the  federal  court  does  not 
interfere  with  the  probate  proceedings  or  assume  general  jurisdiction 
of  the  probate  or  control  of  the  property  in  the  custody  of  the  state 
court."  326 U. S., at 494.  The Court next described a probate excep-
tion of distinctly limited scope: "[W]hile a federal court may not exercise 
its  jurisdiction  to  disturb  or  affect  the  possession  of  property  in  the 
custody of a state court, . . . it may exercise its jurisdiction to adjudicate 
rights in such property where the final judgment does not undertake to 
interfere  with  the  state  court's  possession  save  to  the  extent  that  the 
state court is bound by the judgment to recognize the right adjudicated 
by the federal court."  Ibid.  The first of these quoted passages is not 
a model of clear statement, and some lower federal courts have read the 
words "interfere with the probate proceedings" to block federal jurisdic-
tion over a range of matters well beyond probate of a will or administra-
tion  of  a  decedent's  estate,  including  an  executor's  breach  of  fiduciary 
duty.  This Court  reads Markham's enigmatic  words,  in  sync with the 
second  above-quoted  passage,  to  proscribe  "disturb[ing]  or  affect[ing] 
the  possession  of  property  in  the  custody  of  a  state  court."  Ibid. 
Though that reading renders the first-quoted passage in part redundant, 
redundancy  in  this  context  is  preferable  to  incoherence.  This  Court 
therefore  comprehends  Markham's  "interference"  language  as  essen-
tially a reiteration of the general principle that, when one court is exer-
cising in rem  jurisdiction over a res,  a second court will not assume in 
rem  jurisdiction  over the  same res.  See, e. g., Penn General  Casualty 
Co.  v.  Pennsylvania  ex  rel.  Schnader,  294  U. S.  189,  195-196.  Thus, 
the  probate  exception  reserves  to  state  probate  courts  the  probate  or 
annulment of a will and the administration of a decedent's estate; it also 
precludes  federal  courts  from  disposing  of  property  that  is  in  the  cus-
tody of  a state probate court.  But it  does not  bar federal  courts  from 
adjudicating matters outside those confines and otherwise within federal 
jurisdiction.  Pp. 308-312. 

(c)  Vickie's claim does not involve the administration of an estate, the 
probate  of  a  will,  or  any  other  purely  probate  matter.  Provoked  by 
Pierce's claim in the bankruptcy proceedings, Vickie's claim alleges the 
widely  recognized  tort of  interference  with  a gift  or  inheritance.  She

seeks  an in  personam judgment  against Pierce, not  the probate or an-
nulment of a will.  Cf. Sutton v.  English, 246 U. S. 199, 208.  Nor does 
she  seek  to  reach  a  res  in  a  state  court's  custody.  See  Markham,  326 
U. S.,  at  494.  Furthermore,  no  "sound  policy  considerations"  militate 
in favor of extending the probate exception to cover this case.  Cf. An-
kenbrandt, 504 U. S., at 703.  Trial courts, both federal and state, often 
address  conduct  of  the  kind  Vickie  alleges.  State  probate  courts  pos-
sess  no  "special  proficiency"  in  handling  such  issues.  Cf.  id.,  at  704. 
P. 312. 

(d)  This Court rejects the Ninth Circuit's alternate rationale that the 
Texas  Probate  Court's  jurisdictional  ruling  bound  the  Federal  District 
Court.  Texas courts have recognized a state-law tort action for inter-
ference  with  an  expected  gift  or  inheritance.  It  is  clear,  under  Erie 
R. Co. v.  Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, that Texas law governs the substantive 
elements  of  Vickie's  tortious  interference  claim.  But  it  is  also  clear 
that Texas may not reserve to its probate courts the exclusive right to 
adjudicate  a  transitory  tort.  See  Tennessee  Coal,  Iron  &  R.  Co.  v. 
George,  233  U. S.  354,  360.  Jurisdiction  is  determined  "by  the  law  of 
the court's creation and cannot be defeated by the extraterritorial oper-
ation of a [state] statute . . . , even though it created the right of action." 
Ibid.  Directly on point, the Court has held that federal-court jurisdic-
tion,  "having  existed  from  the  beginning  of  the  Federal  government, 
[can]not  be  impaired  by  subsequent  state  legislation  creating  courts  of 
probate."  McClellan  v.  Carland,  217  U. S.  268,  281.  Durfee  v.  Duke, 
375 U. S.  106,  on which  the Ninth  Circuit relied,  is not  to  the contrary. 
Durfee stands only for the proposition that a state court's final judgment 
determining  its  own  jurisdiction  ordinarily  qualifies  for  full  faith  and 
credit, so long as the jurisdictional issue was fully and fairly litigated in 
the  court  that  rendered  the  judgment.  See  id.,  at  111,  115.  At  issue 
here,  however,  is  not  the  Texas  Probate  Court's  jurisdiction,  but  the 
federal  courts'  jurisdiction  to  entertain  Vickie's  tortious  interfer-
ence  claim.  Under  our  federal  system,  Texas  cannot  render  its  pro-
bate  courts  exclusively  competent  to  entertain  a  claim  of  that  genre. 
Pp. 312-314. 

(e)  The Ninth Circuit may address on remand the questions whether 
Vickie's  claim  was "core" and  Pierce's  arguments concerning  claim  and 
issue preclusion.  Pp. 314-315.

usurp  that  which  is  not  given."  6  Wheat.  264,  404  (1821). 
Among  longstanding  limitations  on  federal  jurisdiction  oth-
erwise  properly  exercised  are  the  so-called  "domestic  rela-
tions"  and  "probate"  exceptions.  Neither  is  compelled  by 
the text of the Constitution or federal statute.  Both are ju-
dicially  created  doctrines  stemming  in  large  measure  from 
misty understandings of English legal history.  See, e. g., At-
wood,  Domestic  Relations  Cases  in  Federal  Court:  Toward 
a  Principled  Exercise  of  Jurisdiction,  35  Hastings  L.  J.  571, 
584-588  (1984);  Spindel  v.  Spindel,  283  F.  Supp.  797,  802 
(EDNY  1968)  (collecting  cases  and  commentary  revealing 
vulnerability  of  historical  explanation  for  domestic  relations 
exception); Winkler, The Probate Jurisdiction of the Federal 
Courts,  14  Probate  L.  J.  77,  125-126,  and  n.  256  (1997)  (de-
scribing  historical  explanation  for  probate  exception  as  "an 
exercise  in  mythography").  In  the  years  following  Mar-
shall's 1821 pronouncement, courts have sometimes lost sight 
of  his  admonition  and  have  rendered  decisions  expansively 
interpreting  the  two  exceptions.  In  Ankenbrandt  v.  Rich-
ards, 504 U. S. 689 (1992), this Court reined in the "domestic 
relations  exception."  Earlier,  in  Markham  v.  Allen,  326 
U. S.  490  (1946),  the  Court  endeavored  similarly  to  curtail 
the "probate exception." 

Nevertheless,  the  Ninth  Circuit  in  the  instant  case  read 
the  probate  exception  broadly  to  exclude  from  the  federal 
courts'  adjudicatory  authority  "not  only  direct  challenges  to 
a will or trust, but also questions which would ordinarily be 
decided by a probate court in determining the validity of the 
decedent's  estate  planning  instrument."  392  F.  3d  1118, 
1133  (2004).  The  Court  of  Appeals  further  held  that  a 
State's vesting of exclusive jurisdiction over probate matters 
in  a  special  court  strips  federal  courts  of  jurisdiction  to  en-
tertain  any  "probate  related  matter,"  including  claims  re-
specting  "tax  liability,  debt,  gift,  [or]  tort."  Id.,  at  1136.

gress, or from decisions of this Court, for its sweeping exten-sion of the probate exception. 

I 
Petitioner,  Vickie  Lynn  Marshall  (Vickie),  also  known  as Anna  Nicole  Smith,  is  the  surviving  widow  of  J.  Howard 

Marshall II (J. Howard).  Vickie and J. Howard met in Octo-ber  1991.  After  a  courtship  lasting  more  than  two  years, 
they were married on June 27, 1994.  J. Howard died on Au-gust  4,  1995.  Although  he  lavished  gifts  and  significant 
sums  of  money  on  Vickie  during  their  courtship  and  mar-riage,  J.  Howard  did  not  include  anything  for  Vickie  in  his 
will.  According to Vickie, J. Howard intended to provide for her  financial security  through a gift in the  form of a "catch-
all" trust. Respondent,  E.  Pierce  Marshall  (Pierce),  one  of  J.  How-
ard's sons, was the ultimate beneficiary of J. Howard's estate plan, which consisted of a living trust and a "pourover" will. 
Under  the  terms  of  the  will,  all  of  J.  Howard's  assets  not already  included  in  the  trust  were  to  be  transferred  to  the 
trust upon his death. Competing  claims  regarding  J.  Howard's  fortune  ignited 
proceedings  in  both  state  and  federal  courts.  In  January 1996,  while  J.  Howard's  estate  was  subject  to  ongoing  pro-
ceedings  in  Probate  Court  in  Harris  County,  Texas,  Vickie filed  for  bankruptcy  under  Chapter  11  of  the  Bankruptcy 
Code,  11  U. S. C.  $ 1101  et  seq.,  in  the  United  States  Bank-ruptcy Court for the Central District of California.  See 275 
B. R. 5, 8 (CD Cal. 2002).  In June 1996, Pierce filed a proof of  claim  in  the  federal  bankruptcy  proceeding,  id.,  at  9;  see 
11 U. S. C. $ 501, alleging that Vickie had defamed him when, shortly after J. Howard's death, lawyers representing Vickie 
told  members  of  the  press  that  Pierce  had  engaged  in  forg-ery,  fraud,  and  overreaching  to  gain  control  of  his  father's 
assets,  275  B.  R.,  at  9.  Pierce  sought  a  declaration  that

Opinion of the Court 
the  debt  he  asserted  in  that  claim  was  not  dischargeable  in bankruptcy.  Ibid.

1  Vickie  answered,  asserting  truth  as  a 

defense.  She  also  filed  counterclaims,  among  them  a  claim that  Pierce  had  tortiously  interfered  with  a  gift  she  ex-

pected.  Ibid.;  see  App.  23-25.  Vickie  alleged  that  Pierce prevented  the  transfer  of  his  father's  intended  gift  to  her 
by,  among  other  things:  effectively  imprisoning  J.  Howard against  his  wishes;  surrounding  him  with  hired  guards  for 
the purpose of preventing personal contact between him and Vickie;  making  misrepresentations  to  J.  Howard;  and  trans-
ferring property against  J.  Howard's  expressed wishes. 
Id., at 24. Vickie's  tortious  interference  counterclaim  turned  her  ob-

jection  to  Pierce's  claim  into  an  adversary  proceeding.  Id., at 39; see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3007.  In that proceeding, 
the  Bankruptcy  Court  granted  summary  judgment  in  favor of  Vickie  on  Pierce's  claim  and,  after  a  trial  on  the  merits, 
entered  judgment  for  Vickie  on  her  tortious  interference counterclaim.  See  253  B.  R.  550,  558-559  (2000).  The 
Bankruptcy  Court  also  held  that  both  Vickie's  objection  to Pierce's  claim  and  Vickie's  counterclaim  qualified  as  "core 
proceedings"  under  28  U. S. C.  $ 157,  which  meant  that  the court  had  authority  to  enter  a  final  judgment  disposing  of 
those  claims.  See  257  B.  R.  35,  39-40  (2000).  The  court awarded  Vickie  compensatory  damages  of  more  than  $449 
million--less whatever she recovered in the ongoing probate action in Texas--as well as $25  million in punitive  damages. 
Id., at 40. Pierce  filed  a  post-trial  motion  to  dismiss  for  lack  of 
subject-matter  jurisdiction,  asserting  that  Vickie's  tortious interference  claim  could  be  tried  only  in  the  Texas  probate 
proceedings.  Id.,  at  36.  The  Bankruptcy  Court  held  that 

1 Among debts not dischargeable in bankruptcy, see 11 U. S. C. $ 523(a), 
are  those  arising  from  "willful  and  malicious  injury  by  the  debtor," 

$ 523(a)(6).

Opinion of the Court 
"the  `probate  exception'  argument  was  waived"  because  it was  not  timely  raised. 

Id.,  at  39.  Relying  on  this  Court's 
decision in Markham, the court observed that a federal court has jurisdiction to "adjudicate rights in probate property, so 

long  as  its  final  judgment  does  not  undertake  to  interfere with the state court's possession of the property."  257 B. R., 
at 38 (citing Markham, 326 U. S., at 494). 

Meanwhile,  in  the  Texas  Probate  Court,  Pierce  sought  a declaration  that  the  living  trust  and  his  father's  will  were 

valid.  392  F.  3d,  at  1124-1125.  Vickie,  in  turn,  challenged the validity of the will and filed a tortious interference claim 
against  Pierce,  ibid.,  but  voluntarily  dismissed  both  claims once  the  Bankruptcy  Court  entered  its  judgment, 

id.,  at 
1128.  Following a jury trial, the Probate Court declared the living trust and J. Howard's will valid. 

Id., at 1129. 
Back in the federal forum, Pierce sought district-court re-view of the Bankruptcy Court's judgment.  While rejecting 

the  Bankruptcy  Court's  determination  that  Pierce  had  for-feited any argument based on the probate exception, the Dis-
trict  Court  held  that  the  exception  did  not  reach  Vickie's 
claim.  264  B.  R.  609,  619-625  (CD  Cal.  2001).  The  Bank-ruptcy  Court  "did  not  assert  jurisdiction  generally  over  the 

probate  proceedings  .  .  .  or  take  control  over  [the]  estate's 
assets,"  the  District  Court  observed,  id.,  at  621,  "[t]hus,  the 
probate  exception  would  bar  federal  jurisdiction  over  Vick-
ie's  counterclaim  only  if  such  jurisdiction  would  `interfere' 
with the probate proceedings," ibid. (quoting Markham, 326 
U. S.,  at  494).  Federal  jurisdiction  would  not  "interfere" 
with  the  probate  proceedings,  the  District  Court  concluded, 
because: (1) success on Vickie's counterclaim did not necessi-
tate  any  declaration  that  J.  Howard's  will  was  invalid,  264 
B. R., at 621; and (2) under Texas law, probate courts do not 
have  exclusive  jurisdiction  to  entertain  claims  of  the  kind 
asserted in Vickie's counterclaim, id., at 622-625. 

The  District  Court  also  held  that  Vickie's  claim  did  not 
qualify as a "core proceedin[g] arising under title 11, or aris-
ing  in  a case  under title  11."  28  U. S. C. $ 157(b)(1);  see 264

B. R., at 625-632.  A bankruptcy court may exercise plenary 
power  only  over  "core  proceedings."  See  $ 157(b)-(c).2  In 
noncore  matters,  a  bankruptcy  court  may  not  enter  final 
judgment; it has authority to issue only proposed findings of 
fact  and  conclusions  of  law,  which  are  reviewed  de  novo  by 
the  district  court.  See  $ 157(c)(1).  Accordingly,  the  Dis-
trict  Court  treated  the  Bankruptcy  Court's  judgment  as 
"proposed[,] rather than final," and undertook a "comprehen-
sive,  complete,  and  independent  review  of "  the  Bankruptcy 
Court's determinations.  Id., at 633.

304  MARSHALL  v.  MARSHALL 

Opinion of the Court 
Adopting and supplementing the Bankruptcy Court's find-
ings,  the  District  Court  determined  that  Pierce  had  tor-
tiously interfered with Vickie's expectancy.  Specifically, the 
District  Court  found  that  J.  Howard  directed  his  lawyers  to 
prepare an inter vivos trust for Vickie consisting of half the 
appreciation  of  his  assets  from  the  date  of  their  marriage. 
See 275 B. R., at 25-30, 51-53.  It further found that Pierce 
conspired to suppress or destroy the trust instrument and to 
strip  J.  Howard  of  his  assets  by  backdating,  altering,  and 
otherwise falsifying documents, arranging for surveillance of 
J.  Howard  and  Vickie,  and  presenting  documents  to  J.  How-
ard under false pretenses.  See id., at 36-50, 57-58; see also 
253 B. R., at 554-556, 559-560.  Based on these findings, the 
District Court awarded Vickie some $44.3 million in compen-
satory  damages.  275  B.  R.,  at  53-57.  In  addition,  finding 
"overwhelming" evidence  of Pierce's "willfulness, malicious-
ness,  and  fraud,"  the  District  Court  awarded  an  equal 
amount in punitive damages.  Id., at 57-58. 

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.  The 
appeals  court  recognized  that  Vickie's  claim  "does  not  in-
volve  the  administration  of  an  estate,  the  probate  of  a  will, 
or  any  other  purely  probate  matter."  392  F.  3d,  at  1133. 
Nevertheless, the court held that the probate exception bars 
federal jurisdiction in this case.  In the Ninth Circuit's view, 
a  claim  falls  within  the  probate  exception  if  it  raises  "ques-
tions  which  would  ordinarily  be  decided  by  a  probate  court 
in determining the validity of the decedent's estate planning 
instrument,"  whether  those  questions  involve  "fraud,  undue 
influence[,  or]  tortious  interference  with  the  testator's  in-
tent."  Ibid. 

The  Ninth  Circuit  was  also  of  the  view  that  state-court 
delineation  of  a  probate  court's  exclusive  adjudicatory  au-
thority could control federal subject-matter jurisdiction.  In 
this regard, the Court of Appeals stated: "Where a state has 
relegated jurisdiction over probate matters to a special court

Opinion of the Court 
and  [the]  state's  trial  courts  of  general  jurisdiction  do  not have  jurisdiction  to  hear  probate  matters,  then  the  federal 

courts  also  lack  jurisdiction  over  probate  matters."  Id.,  at 1136.  Noting  that  "[t]he  [P]robate  [C]ourt  ruled  it  had  ex-
clusive  jurisdiction  over  all  of  Vickie['s]  claims,"  the  Ninth Circuit  held  that  "ruling . . . binding  on  the  United  States 
[D]istrict  [C]ourt."  Ibid.  (citing  Durfee  v.  Duke,  375  U. S. 106, 115-116 (1963)). 

We granted certiorari, 545 U. S. 1165 (2005), to resolve the apparent  confusion  among  federal  courts  concerning  the 
scope  of  the  probate  exception.  Satisfied  that  the  instant case  does  not  fall  within  the  ambit  of  the  narrow  exception 
recognized  by  our  decisions,  we  reverse  the  Ninth  Circuit's judgment.

In  Ankenbrandt  v.  Richards,  504  U. S.  689  (1992),  we  ad-dressed  both  the  derivation  and  the  limits  of  the  "domestic 

relations  exception"  to  the  exercise  of  federal  jurisdiction. Carol  Ankenbrandt,  a  citizen  of  Missouri,  brought  suit  in 
Federal  District  Court  on  behalf  of  her  daughters,  naming as  defendants  their  father  (Ankenbrandt's  former  husband) 
and  his  female  companion,  both  citizens  of  Louisiana.  Id., at  691.  Ankenbrandt's  complaint  sought  damages  for  the 
defendants' alleged sexual and physical abuse of the children. 
Ibid.  Federal  jurisdiction  was  predicated  on  diversity  of citizenship.  Ibid.  (citing  28  U. S. C.  $ 1332).  The  District 

Court dismissed the  case for  lack of subject-matter jurisdic-tion, holding that Ankenbrandt's suit fell within "the `domes-
tic relations'  exception to  diversity  jurisdiction."  504  U. S., at  692.  The  Court  of  Appeals  agreed  and  affirmed. 

Ibid. 
We reversed the Court of Appea ls' judg ment.  Id.,  at 706-707.

Opinion of the Court 
exception to Barber v.  Barber, 21 How. 582 (1859).  See An-
kenbrandt,  504  U. S.,  at  693-695.  In  Barber,  the  Court  up-
held  federal-court  authority,  in  a  diversity  case,  to  enforce an  alimony  award  decreed  by  a  state  court.  In  dicta,  how-

ever,  the  Barber  Court  announced--without  citation  or  dis-cussion--that  federal  courts  lack  jurisdiction  over  suits  for 
divorce  or  the  allowance  of  alimony.  21  How.,  at  584-589; 
see Ankenbrandt, 504 U. S., at 693-695. Finding  no  Article  III  impediment  to  federal-court  juris-

diction in domestic relations cases, id., at 695-697, the Court in 

Ankenbrandt anchored the exception in Congress' original 
provision  for  diversity  jurisdiction,  id.,  at  698-701.  Begin-ning at the beginning, the Court recalled: 

"The  Judiciary  Act  of  1789  provided  that  `the  circuit courts  shall  have  original  cognizance,  concurrent  with 
the  courts  of  the  several  States,  of  all suits  of a civil  
nature  at  common  law  or  in  equity,  where  the  matter 
in  dispute  exceeds,  exclusive  of  costs,  the  sum  or  value of 

five  hundred  dollars,  and  .  .  .  an  alien  is  a  party,  or 
the  suit  is  between  a  citizen  of  the  State  where  the  suit 
is brought, and a citizen of another State.' "   Id., at 698 
(quoting  Act of Sept. 24,  1789,  $ 11,  1 Stat. 78;  emphasis 
added in Ankenbrandt). 

The  defining  phrase,  "all  suits  of  a  civil  nature  at  common 
law or in equity," the Court stressed, remained in successive 
statutory  provisions  for  diversity  jurisdiction  until  1948, 
when  Congress  adopted  the  more  economical  phrase,  "all 
civil actions."  504 U. S., at 698; 1948 Judicial Code and Judi-
ciary Act, 62 Stat. 930, 28 U. S. C. $ 1332. 

The  Barber  majority,  we  acknowledged  in  Ankenbrandt, 
did  not  expressly  tie  its  announcement  of  a  domestic  rela-
tions  exception  to  the  text  of  the  diversity  statute.  504 
U. S., at 698.  But the dissenters in that case made the con-
nection.  They stated that English courts of chancery lacked

Opinion of the Court 
authority  to  issue  divorce  and  alimony  decrees.  Because 
"the  jurisdiction  of  the  courts  of  the  United  States  in  chan-
cery is bounded by that of the chancery in England," Barber, 
21  How.,  at  605  (opinion  of  Daniel,  J.),  the  dissenters  rea-
soned,  our  federal  courts  similarly  lack  authority  to  decree 
divorces or award alimony, ibid.  Such relief, in other words, 
would not fall within the diversity statute's original grant of 
jurisdiction over "all suits of a civil nature at common law or 
in  equity."  We  concluded  in  Ankenbrandt  that  "it  may  be 
inferred  fairly  that  the  jurisdictional  limitation  recognized 
by  the  [Barber]  Court  rested  on  th[e]  statutory  basis"  indi-
cated by the dissenters in that case.  504 U. S., at 699. 

We were "content" in Ankenbrandt "to rest our conclusion 
that a domestic relations exception exists as a matter of stat-
utory  construction  not  on  the  accuracy  of  the  historical  jus-
tifications  on  which  [the  exception]  was  seemingly  based." 
Id.,  at  700.  "[R]ather,"  we  relied  on  "Congress'  apparent 
acceptance  of  this  construction  of  the  diversity  jurisdiction 
provisions  in  the  years  prior  to  1948,  when  the  statute  lim-
ited  jurisdiction  to  `suits  of  a  civil  nature  at  common  law  or 
in  equity.' "  Ibid.  (quoting  1  Stat.  78).  We  further  deter-
mined  that  Congress  did  not  intend  to  terminate  the  excep-
tion  in  1948  when  it  "replace[d]  the  law/equity  distinction 
with  the  phrase  `all  civil  actions.' "  504  U. S.,  at  700.  Ab-
sent contrary indications, we presumed that Congress meant 
to leave undisturbed  "the Court's nearly century-long inter-
pretation"  of  the  diversity  statute  "to  contain  an  exception 
for certain domestic relations matters."  Ibid. 

We nevertheless  emphasized  in Ankenbrandt  that the  ex-
ception  covers  only  "a  narrow  range  of  domestic  relations 
issues."  Id., at 701.  The Barber Court itself, we reminded, 
"sanctioned  the  exercise  of  federal  jurisdiction  over  the  en-
forcement  of  an  alimony  decree  that  had  been  properly  ob-
tained in a state court of competent jurisdiction."  504 U. S., 
at  702.  Noting  that  some  lower  federal  courts  had  applied

Opinion of the Court 
the  domestic  relations  exception  "well  beyond  the  circum-
scribed  situations  posed  by  Barber  and  its  progeny,"  id.,  at 
701,  we  clarified  that  only  "divorce,  alimony,  and  child  cus-
tody  decrees"  remain  outside  federal  jurisdictional  bounds, 
id.,  at  703,  704.  While  recognizing  the  "special  proficiency 
developed by state tribunals . . . in  handling issues that arise 
in  the  granting  of  [divorce,  alimony,  and  child  custody]  de-
crees,"  id.,  at  704,  we  viewed  federal  courts  as  equally 
equipped to deal with complaints alleging the commission of 
torts, ibid.

Federal jurisdiction in this  case is premised on 28  U. S. C. 

$ 1334, the statute vesting in federal district courts jurisdic-
tion in bankruptcy cases and related proceedings.  Decisions 
of  this  Court  have  recognized  a  "probate  exception,"  kin  to 
the domestic relations exception, to otherwise proper federal 
jurisdiction.  See  Markham,  326  U. S.,  at  494;  see  also  Sut-
ton  v.  English,  246  U. S.  199  (1918);  Waterman  v.  CanalLouisiana  Bank &  Trust Co.,  215  U. S. 33 (1909).  Like  the 
domestic relations exception, the probate exception has been 
linked to language contained in the Judiciary Act of 1789. 

Markham,  the  Court's  most  recent  and  pathmarking  pro-
nouncement  on  the  probate  exception,  stated  that  "the  eq-
uity jurisdiction conferred by the Judiciary Act of 1789 . . . ,  
which  is  that  of  the  English  Court  of  Chancery  in  1789,  did 
not extend to probate matters."  326 U. S., at 494.  See gen-
erally  Nicolas,  Fighting  the  Probate  Mafia:  A  Dissection  of 
the  Probate  Exception  to  Federal  Court  Jurisdiction,  74  S. 
Cal. L. Rev. 1479 (2001).  As in Ankenbrandt, so in this case, 
"[w]e have no occasion . . .  to  join the  historical debate" over 
the scope of English chancery jurisdiction in 1789, 504 U. S., 
at 699, for Vickie Marshall's claim falls far outside the bounds 
of the probate exception described in Markham.  We there-
fore need  not  consider in  this case whether  there exists any

In Markham, the plaintiff Alien Property Custodian 4  com-menced  suit  in  Federal  District  Court  against  an  executor 

and  resident  heirs  to  determine  the  Custodian's  asserted rights  regarding  a  decedent's  estate.  326  U. S.,  at  491-492. 
Jurisdiction  was  predicated  on  $ 24(1)  of  the  Judicial  Code, now 28 U. S. C. $ 1345, which provides for federal jurisdiction 
over suits brought by an officer of the United States.  At the time the federal suit commenced, the estate was undergoing 

3 We  note  that  the  broad  grant  of  jurisdiction  conferred  by  $ 1334(b)  is 
subject to a mandatory abstention provision applicable to certain state-law 
claims.  Section 1334(c)(2) provides: 

"Upon timely motion of a party in a proceeding based upon a State law 
claim or State law cause of action, related to a case under title 11 but not 
arising  under  title  11  or  arising  in  a  case  under  title  11,  with  respect  to 
which an  action could not have been  commenced in a  court of the United 
States  absent  jurisdiction  under  this  section,  the  district  court  shall  ab-
stain from hearing such proceeding if an action is commenced, and can be 
timely adjudicated, in a State forum of appropriate jurisdiction." 

That  provision  is, in  turn, qualified: "Non-core proceedings under section 
157(b)(2)(B)  of  title  28,  United  States  Code,  shall  not  be  subject  to  the 
mandatory  abstention  provisions  of  section  1334(c)(2)."  $ 157(b)(4).  Be-
cause  the  Bankruptcy  Court  rejected  Pierce's  motion  for  mandatory  ab-
stention as untimely, 257 B. R. 35, 39 (CD Cal. 2000), we need not consider 
whether  these  provisions  might  have  required  abstention  upon  a  timely 
motion. 

4 Section 6 of the Trading with the Enemy Act, 40 Stat. 415, 50 U. S. C. 

App.,  authorizes  the  President  to  appoint  an  official  known  as  the  "alien 
property custodian," who is responsible for "receiv[ing,] . . .  hold[ing], ad-
minister[ing], and account[ing] for" "all money and property in the United 
States  due  or  belonging  to  an  enemy,  or  ally  of  enemy  .  .  .  ."  The  Act 
was originally enacted during World War I "to permit, under careful safe-
guards and restrictions, certain kinds of business to be carried on" among 
warring  nations,  and  to  "provid[e]  for  the  care  and  administration  of  the 
property  and  property  rights  of  enemies  and  their  allies  in  this  country 
pending the war."  Markham v. Cabell, 326 U. S. 404, 414, n. 1 (1945) (Bur-
ton,  J.,  concurring)  (quoting  S.  Rep.  No.  113,  65th  Cong.,  1st  Sess.,  1

310  MARSHALL  v.  MARSHALL 

Opinion of the Court 
probate administration in a state court.  The Custodian had issued an order vesting in himself all right, title, and interest 

of  German  legatees.  He  sought  and  gained  in  the  District Court  a  judgment  determining  that  the  resident  heirs  had 
no interest in the estate, and that the Custodian, substituting himself  for  the  German  legatees,  was  entitled  to  the  entire 
net  estate,  including  specified  real  estate  passing  under  the will. 

Reversing  the  Ninth  Circuit,  which  had  ordered  the  case dismissed  for  want  of  federal  subject-matter  jurisdiction, 
this  Court  held  that  federal  jurisdiction  was  properly  in-voked.  The Court first stated: 

"It  is  true  that  a  federal  court  has  no  jurisdiction  to probate  a  will  or  administer  an  estate  . . . .   But  it  has  
been  established  by  a  long  series  of  decisions  of  this Court  that  federal  courts  of  equity  have  jurisdiction  to 
entertain suits  `in favor of creditors,  legatees and heirs' and  other  claimants  against  a  decedent's  estate  `to  es-
tablish  their  claims'  so  long  as  the  federal  court  does not  interfere  with  the  probate  proceedings  or  assume 
general jurisdiction of the probate or control of the prop-erty in the custody of the state court."  326 U. S., at 494 
(quoting Waterman, 215 U. S., at 43). 
Next,  the  Court  described  a  probate  exception  of  distinctly limited scope: 

"[W]hile a federal court may not exercise its jurisdiction to  disturb  or  affect  the  possession  of  property  in  the 
custody of a state court, . . . it may exercise its jurisdic-tion to adjudicate rights in such property where the final 
judgment does not undertake to interfere with the state court's possession save to the extent that the state court 
is bound by the judgment to recognize the right adjudi-cated by the federal court."  326 U. S., at 494. 

The  first  of  the  above-quoted  passages  from  Markham  is not  a  model  of  clear  statement.  The  Court  observed  that 

547US1 Unit: $U51 [03-17-09 13:51:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

311 Cite as: 547 U. S. 293 (2006) 
Opinion of the Court 
federal  courts  have  jurisdiction  to  entertain  suits  to  deter-mine the rights of creditors, legatees, heirs, and other claim-

ants against a decedent's estate, "so long as the federal court does not 

interfere with the probate proceedings."  Ibid. (em-
phasis  added).  Lower federal  courts  have  puzzled  over  the meaning  of  the  words  "interfere  with  the  probate  proceed-

ings," and some have read those words to block federal juris-
diction over a range of matters well beyond probate of a will or administration of a decedent's estate.  See, 

e. g., Mangieri 
v.  Mangieri, 226 F. 3d 1, 2-3 (CA1 2000) (breach of fiduciary duty by executor); 

Golden ex rel. Golden v.  Golden, 382 F. 3d 
348,  360-362  (CA3  2004)  (same);  Lepard  v.  NBD  Bank,  Div. 
of  Bank  One,  384  F.  3d  232,  234-237  (CA6  2004)  (breach  of 
fiduciary  duty  by  trustee);  Storm  v.  Storm,  328  F.  3d  941, 
943-945 (CA7 2003) (probate exception bars claim that plain-
tiff 's  father  tortiously  interfered  with  plaintiff 's  inheritance 
by persuading trust grantor to amend irrevocable inter vivos 
trust);  Rienhardt  v.  Kelly,  164  F.  3d  1296,  1300-1301  (CA10 
1999) (probate exception bars claim that defendants exerted 
undue influence on testator and thereby tortiously interfered 
with plaintiff 's expected inheritance). 

We read Markham's enigmatic words, in sync with the sec-
ond  above-quoted  passage,  to  proscribe  "disturb[ing]  or  af-
fect[ing] the possession of property in the custody of a state 
court."  326  U. S.,  at  494.  True,  that  reading  renders  the 
first-quoted  passage  in  part  redundant,  but  redundancy  in 
this  context,  we  do  not  doubt,  is  preferable  to  incoherence. 
In  short,  we  comprehend  the  "interference"  language  in 
Markham as essentially a reiteration of the general principle 
that, when one court is exercising in rem jurisdiction over a 
res,  a  second  court  will  not  assume  in  rem  jurisdiction  over 
the same res.  See, e. g., Penn General Casualty Co. v.  Penn-
sylvania ex rel. Schnader, 294 U. S. 189, 195-196 (1935); Wa-
terman,  215  U. S.,  at  45-46.  Thus,  the  probate  exception 
reserves to state probate courts the probate or annulment of 
a  will  and  the  administration  of  a  decedent's  estate;  it  also

312  MARSHALL  v.  MARSHALL 

Opinion of the Court 
precludes  federal  courts  from  endeavoring  to  dispose  of property that is in the custody of a state probate court.  But 

it does not bar federal courts from adjudicating matters out-side those confines and otherwise within federal jurisdiction. 

A 
As the Court of Appeals correctly observed, Vickie's claim does not "involve the administration of an estate, the probate 

of a will, or any other purely probate matter."  392 F. 3d, at 1133.  Provoked  by  Pierce's  claim  in  the  bankruptcy  pro-
ceedings,  Vickie's  claim,  like  Carol  Ankenbrandt's,  alleges  a widely recognized tort.  See 

King v.  Acker, 725 S. W. 2d 750, 754 (Tex. App. 1987); 4 Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 774B 

(1977)  ("One  who  by  fraud,  duress  or  other  tortious  means intentionally  prevents  another  from  receiving  from  a  third 
person an inheritance or gift that [s]he would otherwise have received  is  subject  to  liability  to  the  other  for  loss  of  the 
inheritance  or  gift.").  Vickie  seeks  an  in  personam  judg-ment against Pierce, not the  probate or annulment of a will. 
Cf. Sutton, 246 U. S., at 208 (suit to annul a will found "sup-plemental  to  the  proceedings  for  probate  of  the  will"  and 
therefore  not  cognizable  in  federal  court).  Nor  does  she seek  to  reach  a 

res  in  the  custody  of  a  state  court.  See Markham, 326 U. S., at 494. 

Furthermore,  no  "sound  policy  considerations"  militate  in favor  of  extending  the  probate  exception  to  cover  the  case 
at  hand.  Cf.  Ankenbrandt,  504  U. S.,  at  703.  Trial  courts, both  federal  and  state,  often  address  conduct  of  the  kind 
Vickie  alleges.  State  probate  courts  possess  no  "special proficiency . . . in  handling [such] issues."  Cf. id., at 704. 

B 
The  Court  of  Appeals  advanced  an  alternate  basis  for  its conclusion that the federal courts lack jurisdiction over Vick-

ie's  claim.  Noting  that  the  Texas  Probate  Court  "ruled  it had exclusive  jurisdiction  over all  of  Vickie  Lynn  Marshall's

Opinion of the Court 
claims  against  E.  Pierce  Marshall,"  the  Ninth  Circuit  held 
that  "ruling  .  .  .  binding  on  the  United  States  [D]istrict 
[C]ourt."  392 F. 3d, at 1136.  We reject that determination. 

Texas  courts  have  recognized  a  state-law  tort  action  for 
interference  with  an  expected  inheritance  or  gift,  modeled 
on the Restatement formulation.  See King, 725 S. W. 2d, at 
754;  Brandes  v.  Rice  Trust,  Inc.,  966  S.  W.  2d  144,  146-147 
(Tex.  App.  1998).5  It  is  clear,  under  Erie  R.  Co.  v.  Tomp-
kins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938), that Texas law governs the substan-
tive  elements  of  Vickie's  tortious  interference  claim.  It  is 
also  clear,  however,  that  Texas  may  not  reserve  to  its  pro-
bate  courts  the  exclusive  right  to  adjudicate  a  transitory 

5 Texas appellate courts have on occasion held claims of tortious interfer-
ence with an expected inheritance "barred" by a prior probate court judg-
ment,  apparently  applying  ordinary  principles  of  preclusion.  See,  e. g., 
Thompson v.  Deloitte & Touche, 902 S. W. 2d 13, 16 (Tex. App. 1995) (final 
probate  court  judgment  bars  claim  of  tortious  interference  with  inheri-
tance expectancy because probate court "necessarily found that [the dece-
dent] signed the will with testamentary capacity, and that it reflected his 
intent, was not the result of coercion or undue influence, and was valid"); 
Neill v.  Yett, 746  S.  W.  2d  32,  35-36  (Tex.  App.  1988)  (complaint  alleging 
fraud  and  tortious  interference  with  inheritance  expectancy,  filed  more 
than two years after will was admitted to probate, was barred by both the 
statute  of  limitations  and  the  final  probate  judgment,  and  failed  to  state 
the  elements  of  the  claim).  Neither  Thompson  nor  Neill  questions  the 
Texas trial courts' subject-matter jurisdiction over the claims in question. 

Pierce maintains that Thompson, Neill, and other Texas decisions sup-
port  his  contention  that  preclusion  principles  bar  Vickie's  claim.  See

Opinion of the Court 
tort.  We  have  long  recognized  that  "a  State  cannot  create a transitory cause of action and at the same time destroy the 

right  to  sue  on  that  transitory  cause  of  action  in  any  court having  jurisdiction."  Tennessee  Coal,  Iron  &  R.  Co.  v. 
George, 233 U. S. 354, 360 (1914).  Jurisdiction is determined "by the law of the court's creation and cannot be defeated by 
the  extraterritorial  operation  of  a  [state]  statute  .  .  .  ,  even though  it  created  the  right  of  action." 

Ibid.  Directly  on point, we have held that the jurisdiction of the federal courts, 

"having  existed  from  the  beginning  of  the  Federal  govern-ment,  [can]not  be  impaired  by  subsequent  state  legislation 
creating  courts  of  probate."  McClellan  v.  Carland,  217 U. S.  268,  281  (1910)  (upholding  federal  jurisdiction  over  ac-
tion  by  heirs  of  decedent,  who  died  intestate,  to  determine their  rights  in  the  estate  (citing  Waterman,  215  U. S.  33)). 

Our decision in Durfee v.  Duke, 375 U. S. 106 (1963), relied upon  by  the  Ninth  Circuit,  392  F.  3d,  at  1136,  is  not  to  the 
contrary.  Durfee stands only for the proposition that a state court's final judgment determining 

its own jurisdiction ordi-narily  qualifies  for  full  faith  and  credit,  so  long  as  the  juris-

dictional issue was fully and fairly litigated in the court that rendered  the  judgment.  See  375  U. S.,  at  111,  115.  At 
issue  here,  however,  is  not  the  Texas  Probate  Court's  juris-diction, but the federal courts' jurisdiction to entertain Vick-
ie's  tortious  interference  claim.  Under  our  federal  system, Texas  cannot  render  its  probate  courts  exclusively  compe-
tent  to  entertain  a  claim  of  that  genre.  We  therefore  hold that  the  District  Court  properly  asserted  jurisdiction  over 
Vickie's counterclaim against Pierce. 

IV 
After determining that Vickie's claim was not a "core pro-ceeding,"  the  District  Court  reviewed  the  case 

de  novo  and entered  its  final  judgment  on  March  7,  2002.  275  B.  R.,  at 

5-8.  The  Texas  Probate  Court's  judgment  became  final  on February  11,  2002,  nearly  one  month  earlier.  App.  to  Pet.

Opinion of the Court 
Toledo.  In exchange, the city agreed to waive the property tax for the plant, with the consent of the two school districts 

in which the plant is located.  Because DaimlerChrysler un-dertook to purchase and install "new manufacturing machin-
ery  and  equipment,"  it  was  also  entitled  to  a  credit  against the state franchise tax.  See $ 5733.33(B)(1) (Lexis 1999). 

Plaintiffs  filed  suit against  various  state and  local officials and  DaimlerChrysler  in  state  court,  alleging  that  these  tax 
benefits  violated  the  Commerce  Clause.  Most  of  the  plain-tiffs were residents of Toledo, who paid taxes to both the city 
of  Toledo  and  State  of  Ohio.  They  claimed  that  they  were injured  because  the  tax  breaks  for  DaimlerChrysler  dimin-
ished  the  funds  available  to  the  city  and  State,  imposing  a "disproportionate burden" on plaintiffs.  App. 18a, 23a, 28a.

2 

Defendants  removed  the  action  to  the  United  States  Dis-trict  Court  for  the  Northern  District  of  Ohio.  See  28 

U. S. C.  $ 1441.  Plaintiffs  filed  motions  to  remand  the  case to state court.  See $ 1447(c).  One of the grounds on which 
they  sought  remand  concerned  their  standing.  They  pro-fessed "substantial doubts about their ability to satisfy either 
the  constitutional  or  the  prudential  limitations  on  standing in  the  federal  court,"  and  urged  the  District  Court  to  avoid 
the  issue  entirely  by  remanding.  Plaintiffs'  Supplemental Motion  for  Remand  to  State  Court  in  No.  3:00cv7247,  p.  13, 
Record, Doc. 17 (footnote omitted). The District Court declined to remand the case, concluding 
that,  "[a]t the  bare  minimum,  the  Plaintiffs  who  are  taxpay-ers  have  standing  to  object  to  the  property  tax  exemption 

2 Other  plaintiffs  were  residents  of  Toledo  who  claimed  they  were  in-
jured because they were displaced by the DaimlerChrysler expansion and 
Michigan  residents  who  claimed  injury  because  DaimlerChrysler  would 
have expanded its operations in Michigan but for the Ohio investment tax 
credit.  Plaintiffs neither identified these allegations as a basis for stand-
ing  in  their  merits  brief  before  this  Court  nor  referred  to  them  at  oral 
argument.  Any  argument  based  on  these  allegations  is  therefore  aban-
doned.  See,  e.

Opinion of the Court 
tection  (the  state  agency  responsible  for  what  have  come  to be  known  as  "401  state  certifications"),  but  it  filed  its  ap-

plication  under  protest,  claiming  that  its  dams  do  not  result in  any  "discharge  into"  the  river  triggering  application  of 

$ 401. The Maine agency issued certifications that required 
Warren to maintain a minimum stream flow in the bypassed portions of the river and to allow passage for various migra-
tory fish and eels.  When FERC eventually licensed the five dams,  it  did  so  subject  to  the  Maine  conditions,  and  Warren 
continued  to  deny  any  need  of  $ 401  state  certification. After appealing unsuccessfully to Maine's administrative  ap-
peals tribunal, the Board of Environmental Protection, War-ren filed this suit in the State's Cumberland County Superior 
Court.  That  court  rejected  Warren's  argument  that  its dams  do  not  result  in  discharges,  and  the  Supreme  Judicial 
Court  of  Maine  affirmed.  2005  ME  27,  868  A.  2d  210.  We granted  certiorari,  546  U. S.  933  (2005),  and  now  affirm  as 
well.  II 

The dispute turns on the meaning of the word "discharge," the  key  to  the  state  certification  requirement  under  $ 401.

2 

The Act has no definition of the term, but provides that "[t]he term  `discharge'  when  used  without  qualification  includes  a 

discharge of a pollutant, and a discharge of pollutants." 3  33 U. S. C. $ 1362(16).  It does define "discharge of a pollutant" 
and  "discharge  of  pollutants"  as  meaning  "any  addition  of any  pollutant  to  navigable  waters  from  any  point  source." 

2 No  one  disputes  that  the  Presumpscot  River  is  a  navigable  water  of 
the United States. 

3 The term "pollutant" is defined in the Act to mean "dredged spoil, solid 

waste,  incinerator  residue,  sewage,  garbage,  sewage  sludge,  munitions, 
chemical wastes, biological materials, radioactive materials, heat, wrecked 
or  discarded  equipment,  rock,  sand,  cellar  dirt  and  industrial,  municipal, 
and agricultural waste discharged into water."  33 U. S. C. $ 1362(6).

Opinion of the Court 
Warren  claims  that  the  canon  applies  to  $ 502(16)  of  the Clean Water Act, which provides that "[t]he term `discharge' 

when used without qualification includes a discharge of a pol-lutant, and a discharge of pollutants."  33 U. S. C. $ 1362(16). 
Warren  emphasizes  that  the  "include[d]"  terms,  pollutant discharges,  are  themselves  defined  to  require  an  "addition" 
of  pollutants  to  water.  $ 1362(12).  Since  "discharge"  pure 
and  simple  is  keeping  company  with  "discharge"  defined  as adding  one  or  more  pollutants,  Warren  says  "discharge" 

standing  alone  must  require  the  addition  of  something  for-eign  to  the  water  into  which  the  discharge  flows.  And  be-
cause  the  release  of  water  from  the  dams  adds  nothing  to the  river  that  was  not  there  above  the  dams,  Warren  con-
cludes  that  water  flowing  out  of  the  turbines  cannot  be  a discharge into the river.

The  problem  with  Warren's  argument  is  that  it  purports to  extrapolate  a  common  feature  from  what  amounts  to  a 

single  item  (discharge  of  a  pollutant  plus  the  plural  variant 
involving more than one pollutant).  See Beecham,

tory  term  here  is  not  the  word  "discharge"  alone,  but  "dis-charge of a pollutant," a phrase made narrower by its speci-

Opinion of the Court 
Thus,  Warren  argues,  there  is  no  reason  to  assume  that  de-scribing  "discharge"  as  including  certain  acts  was  meant  to 

extend the reach of $ 401 beyond acts of the kind specifically mentioned; 

7  the  terminology of $ 401  simply reflects a  failed 

effort to narrow the scope of $ 402. This  is  what  might  be  called  a  lawyer's  argument.  We 

will  assume  that  Warren  is  entirely  correct  about  the  impe-tus  behind  the  failed  attempt  to  rework  the  scope  of  pollut-
ant discharge under $ 402.  It is simply speculation, though, to say that the word "includes" was left in the description of 
a  "discharge"  by  mere  inattention,  and  for  reasons  given  in Part  IV  of  this  opinion  it  is  implausible  speculation  at  that. 
But if we confine our view for a moment strictly to the draft-ing  history,  the  one  thing  clear  is  that  if  Congress  had  left 
"thermal discharge" as an included subclass of a "discharge" under  $ 502(16),  Warren  would  have  a  stronger

that  MercExchange's  patent  was  valid,  that  eBay  and Half.com  had  infringed  that  patent,  and  that  an  award  of 

damages was appropriate.1 Following the jury verdict,  the District Court denied 
MercExchange's  motion  for  permanent  injunctive  relief. 275  F.  Supp.  2d  695  (2003).  The  Court  of  Appeals  for  the 
Federal  Circuit  reversed,  applying  its  "general  rule  that courts  will  issue  permanent  injunctions  against  patent  in-
fringement  absent  exceptional  circumstances."  401  F.  3d 1323,  1339  (2005).  We  granted  certiorari  to  determine  the 
appropriateness  of  this  general  rule.  546  U. S.  1029  (2005). 

II 
According to  well-established  principles of equity, a  plain-tiff seeking a permanent injunction must satisfy a four-factor 

test  before  a  court  may  grant  such  relief.  A  plaintiff  must demonstrate:  (1)  that  it  has  suffered  an  irreparable  injury; 
(2)  that  remedies  available  at  law,  such  as  monetary  dam-ages,  are  inadequate to  compensate  for  that  injury;  (3)  that, 
considering  the  balance  of  hardships  between  the  plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that 
the  public  interest  would  not  be  disserved  by  a  permanent injunction.  See,

garding  a  loud  party  at  a  residence.  Upon  arriving  at  the house, they heard shouting from inside, and proceeded down 

the  driveway  to  investigate.  There,  they  observed  two  ju-veniles  drinking  beer  in  the  backyard.  They  entered  the 
backyard, and saw--through a screen door and windows--an altercation taking place in the kitchen of the home.  Accord-
ing  to  the  testimony  of  one  of  the  officers,  four  adults  were 
attempting, with some difficulty, to restrain a juvenile.  The juvenile  eventually  "broke free,  swung a  fist and  struck one 

of  the  adults  in  the  face."  2005  UT  13,  || 2,  122  P.  3d  506, 508.  The officer testified that he observed the victim of the 
blow spitting blood into a nearby sink.  App. 40.  The other 
adults continued to try to restrain the juvenile, pressing him 
up  against  a  refrigerator  with  such  force  that the  refrigera-
tor  began  moving  across  the  floor.  At  this  point,  an  officer 
opened the screen door and announced the officers' presence. 
Amid  the  tumult,  nobody  noticed.  The  officer  entered  the 
kitchen and again  cried out, and as the occupants slowly be-
came  aware  that  the  police  were  on  the  scene,  the  alterca-
tion ceased. 

The officers subsequently  arrested  respondents and 
charged  them  with  contributing  to  the  delinquency  of  a 
minor,  disorderly  conduct,  and  intoxication.  In  the  trial 
court,  respondents  filed  a  motion  to  suppress  all  evidence 
obtained  after  the  officers  entered  the  home,  arguing  that 
the  warrantless  entry  violated  the  Fourth  Amendment. 
The  court  granted  the  motion,  and  the  Utah  Court  of  Ap-
peals affirmed. 

Before  the  Supreme  Court  of Utah,  Brigham  City  argued 
that  although  the  officers  lacked  a  warrant,  their  entry  was 
nevertheless  reasonable  on  either  of  two  grounds.  The 
court rejected both contentions and, over two dissenters, af-
firmed.  First,  the  court  held  that  the  injury  caused  by  the 
juvenile's  punch  was  insufficient  to  trigger  the  so-called 
"emergency  aid  doctrine"  because  it  did  not  give  rise  to  an 
"objectively  reasonable  belief  that  an  unconscious,  semi-

ees' words and actions, a government employer would have little chance 
to  provide  public  services  efficiently.  Cf.  Connick,  supra,  at  143. 
Thus,  a  government  entity  has  broader  discretion  to  restrict  speech 
when  it  acts  in  its  employer  role,  but  the  restrictions  it  imposes  must 
be  directed  at  speech  that  has  some  potential  to  affect  its  operations. 
On the other hand, a citizen who works for the government is nonethe-
less  still  a  citizen.  The  First  Amendment  limits  a  public  employer's 
ability to leverage the employment relationship to restrict, incidentally 
or intentionally, the liberties employees enjoy in their capacities as pri-
vate  citizens.  See  Perry  v.  Sindermann,  408  U. S.  593,  597.  So  long 
as  employees  are  speaking  as  citizens  about  matters  of  public  concern, 
they  must  face  only  those  speech  restrictions  that  are  necessary  for 
their  employers  to  operate  efficiently  and  effectively.  See,  e. g.,  Con-
nick, supra, at 147.  Pp. 417-420. 

(b)  Proper  application  of  the  Court's  precedents  leads  to  the  conclu-
sion that the First Amendment does not  prohibit managerial discipline 
based  on  an  employee's  expressions  made  pursuant to  official  responsi-
bilities.  Because Ceballos' memo falls into this category, his allegation 
of unconstitutional retaliation must  fail.  The dispositive factor here is 
not that Ceballos expressed his views inside his office, rather than pub-
licly,  see,  e. g.,  Givhan  v.  Western  Line  Consol.  School  Dist.,  439  U. S. 
410, 414, nor that the memo concerned the subject matter of his employ-
ment, see, e. g., Pickering, supra, at 573.  Rather, the controlling factor 
is  that  Ceballos'  expressions  were  made  pursuant  to  his  official  duties. 
That consideration distinguishes this case from those in which the First 
Amendment provides protection against discipline.  Ceballos wrote his 
disposition  memo  because  that  is  part  of  what  he  was  employed  to  do. 
He did not act as a citizen by writing it.  The fact that his duties some-
times  required  him  to  speak  or  write  does  not  mean  his  supervisors 
were  prohibited  from  evaluating  his  performance.  Restricting  speech 
that  owes  its  existence  to  a  public  employee's  professional  responsibil-
ities  does  not  infringe  any  liberties  the  employee  might  have  enjoyed 
as  a  private  citizen.  It  simply  reflects  the  exercise  of  employer  con-
trol  over  what  the  employer  itself  has  commissioned  or  created. 
Cf.  Rosenberger  v.  Rector  and  Visitors  of  Univ.  of  Va.,  515  U. S.  819, 
833.  This  result  is  consistent  with  the  Court's  prior  emphasis  on  the 
potential societal value of employee speech and on affording government 
employers  sufficient  discretion  to  manage  their  operations.  Ceballos' 
proposed  contrary  rule,  adopted  by  the  Ninth  Circuit,  would  commit 
state  and  federal  courts  to  a  new,  permanent,  and  intrusive  role,  man-
dating judicial oversight of communications between and among govern-
ment  employees  and  their  superiors  in  the  course  of  official  business. 
This displacement of managerial discretion by judicial supervision finds

no support in the Court's precedents.  The doctrinal anomaly the Court 
of Appeals perceived in compelling public employers to tolerate certain 
employee  speech  made  publicly  but  not  speech  made  pursuant  to  an 
employee's  assigned  duties  misconceives  the  theoretical  underpinnings 
of  this  Court's  decisions  and  is  unfounded  as  a  practical  matter. 
Pp. 420-425. 

(c)  Exposing governmental inefficiency and misconduct is a matter of 
considerable  significance,  and  various  measures  have  been  adopted  to 
protect employees  and provide  checks on supervisors who would order 
unlawful or otherwise inappropriate actions.  These include federal and 
state  whistle-blower  protection  laws  and  labor  codes  and,  for  govern-
ment  attorneys,  rules  of  conduct  and  constitutional  obligations  apart 
from  the  First  Amendment.  However,  the  Court's  precedents  do  not 
support  the  existence  of  a  constitutional  cause  of  action  behind  every 
statement  a  public  employee  makes  in  the  course  of  doing  his  or  her 
job.  Pp. 425-426.

Opinion of the Court 
had filed a motion to traverse, or challenge, the warrant, but he  also  wanted  Ceballos  to  review  the  case.  According  to 

Ceballos, it was not unusual for defense attorneys to ask cal-endar deputies to investigate aspects of pending cases. 

After  examining  the  affidavit  and  visiting  the  location  it described,  Ceballos  determined  the  affidavit  contained  seri-
ous  misrepresentations.  The  affidavit  called  a  long  drive-
way  what  Ceballos  thought  should  have  been  referred  to  as a separate roadway.  Ceballos also questioned the affidavit's 

statement that tire tracks led from a stripped-down truck to the  premises  covered  by  the  warrant.  His  doubts  arose 
from  his  conclusion  that  the  roadway's  composition  in  some 
places  made  it  difficult  or  impossible  to  leave  visible  tire 
tracks. 

Ceballos  spoke  on  the  telephone  to  the  warrant  affiant,  a 
deputy  sheriff  from  the  Los  Angeles  County  Sheriff 's  De-
partment,  but  he  did  not  receive  a  satisfactory  explana-
tion for the perceived inaccuracies.  He relayed his findings 
to  his  supervisors,  petitioners  Carol  Najera  and  Frank 
Sundstedt, and followed up by preparing a disposition memo-
randum.  The  memo  explained  Ceballos'  concerns  and  rec-
ommended dismissal of the case.  On March 2, 2000, Ceballos 
submitted  the  memo  to  Sundstedt  for  his  review.  A  few 
days  later,  Ceballos  presented  Sundstedt  with  another 
memo,  this  one  describing  a  second  telephone  conversation 
between Ceballos and the warrant affiant. 

Based on Ceballos' statements, a meeting was held to dis-
cuss  the  affidavit.  Attendees  included  Ceballos,  Sundstedt, 
and Najera, as well as the warrant affiant and other employ-
ees  from  the  sheriff 's  department.  The  meeting  allegedly 
became  heated, with one  lieutenant  sharply criticizing 
Ceballos for his handling of the case. 

Despite  Ceballos'  concerns,  Sundstedt  decided  to  proceed 
with  the  prosecution,  pending  disposition  of  the  defense 
motion  to  traverse.  The  trial  court  held  a  hearing  on  the 
motion.  Ceballos  was  called  by  the  defense  and  recounted

Opinion of the Court 
his  observations  about  the  affidavit,  but  the  trial  court  re-jected the challenge to the warrant. 

Ceballos  claims  that  in  the  aftermath  of  these  events  he was subjected to a series of retaliatory employment actions. 
The actions included reassignment from his calendar deputy position to a trial deputy position, transfer to another court-
house, and  denial of a  promotion.  Ceballos initiated  an em-
ployment  grievance,  but  the  grievance  was  denied  based  on a finding  that he had  not  suffered any  retaliation.  Unsatis-

fied,  Ceballos  sued  in  the  United  States  District  Court  for the Central District of California, asserting, as relevant here, 
a  claim  under  Rev.  Stat.  $ 1979,  42  U. S. C.  $ 1983.  He  al-
leged  petitioners  violated  the  First  and Fourteenth  Amend-
ments  by  retaliating  against  him  based  on  his  memo  of 
March 2. 

Petitioners  responded  that  no  retaliatory  actions  were 
taken  against  Ceballos  and  that  all  the  actions  of  which  he 
complained  were  explained  by  legitimate  reasons  such  as 
staffing  needs.  They  further  contended  that,  in  any  event, 
Ceballos'  memo  was  not  protected  speech  under  the  First 
Amendment.  Petitioners  moved  for  summary  judgment, 
and  the  District  Court  granted  their  motion.  Noting  that 
Ceballos wrote his memo pursuant to his employment duties, 
the court concluded he was not entitled to First Amendment 
protection  for  the  memo's  contents.  It  held  in  the  alterna-
tive  that  even  if  Ceballos'  speech  was  constitutionally  pro-
tected, petitioners had qualified immunity because the rights 
Ceballos asserted were not clearly established. 

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, hold-
ing  that  "Ceballos's  allegations  of  wrongdoing  in  the  memo-
randum constitute protected speech under the First Amend-
ment. "  361  F.  3d  1168,  1173  (2004).  In  reaching  its 
conclusion the court looked to the First Amendment analysis 
set  forth  in  Pickering  v.  Board  of  Ed.  of  Township  High 
School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563 (1968), and Connick, 
supra.  Connick  instructs  courts  to  begin  by  considering

Opinion of the Court 
whether  the  expressions  in  question  were  made  by  the speaker  "as  a  citizen  upon  matters  of  public  concern."  See 

id.,  at  146-147.  The  Court  of  Appeals  determined  that Ceballos' memo, which recited what he thought to be govern-
mental  misconduct,  was  "inherently  a  matter  of  public  con-cern."  361 F. 3d, at 1174.  The court did not, however, con-
sider  whether  the  speech  was  made  in  Ceballos'  capacity  as 
a  citizen.  Rather,  it  relied  on  Circuit  precedent  rejecting the idea that "a public employee's speech is deprived of First 

Amendment protection whenever those views are expressed, to  government  workers  or  others,  pursuant  to  an  employ-
ment  responsibility."  Id.,  at  1174-1175  (citing  cases  includ-
ing  Roth  v.  Veteran's  Admin.  of  Govt.  of  United  States,  856 
F. 2d 1401 (CA9 1988)). 

Having concluded that Ceballos'  memo  satisfied the 
public-concern requirement, the Court of Appeals proceeded 
to balance Ceballos' interest in his speech against his super-
visors'  interest  in  responding  to  it.  See  Pickering,  supra, 
at 568.  The court struck the balance in Ceballos' favor, not-
ing  that petitioners "failed  even  to suggest disruption or in-
efficiency  in  the  workings  of  the  District  Attorney's  Office" 
as a result of the memo.  See 361 F. 3d, at 1180.  The court 
further  concluded  that  Ceballos'  First  Amendment  rights 
were  clearly  established  and  that  petitioners'  actions  were 
not objectively reasonable.  See id., at 1181-1182. 

Judge O'Scannlain specially concurred.  Agreeing that the 
panel's decision was compelled by Circuit precedent, he nev-
ertheless concluded Circuit law should be revisited and over-
ruled.  See id., at 1185.  Judge O'Scannlain emphasized the 
distinction  "between  speech  offered  by  a  public  employee 
acting  as  an  employee  carrying  out  his  or  her  ordinary  job 
duties  and  that  spoken  by  an  employee  acting  as  a  citizen 
expressing  his  or  her  personal  views  on  disputed  matters 
of  public  import."  Id.,  at  1187.  In  his  view,  "when  public 
employees speak  in  the  course of carrying  out their  routine, 
required  employment  obligations,  they  have  no personal  in-

As  the  Court's  decisions  have  noted,  for  many  years  "the unchallenged dogma was that a public employee had no right 

to  object  to  conditions  placed  upon  the  terms  of  employ-ment--including  those  which  restricted  the  exercise  of  con-
stitutional rights."  Connick, 461 U. S., at 143.  That dogma has  been  qualified  in  important  respects.  See 

id.,  at  144- 145.  The Court has made clear that public employees do not 

surrender  all  their  First  Amendment  rights  by  reason  of their  employment.  Rather,  the  First  Amendment  protects 
a public employee's right, in  certain circumstances,  to speak as a citizen addressing matters of public concern.  See, 

e. g., Pickering,  supra,  at  568;  Connick,  supra,  at  147;  Rankin  v. 

McPherson, 483 U. S. 378, 384 (1987); United States v.  Treas-ury Employees, 513 U. S. 454, 466 (1995). 

Pickering  provides  a  useful  starting  point  in  explaining the  Court's  doctrine.  There  the  relevant  speech  was  a 
teacher's  letter  to  a  local  newspaper  addressing  issues  in-cluding  the  funding  policies  of  his  school  board.  391  U. S., 
at 566.  "The  problem in  any case," the  Court  stated, "is to arrive  at  a  balance  between  the  interests  of  the  teacher,  as 
a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the  interest  of  the  State,  as  an  employer,  in  promoting 

the  efficiency  of  the  public  services  it  performs  through  its employees." 

Id.,  at  568.  The  Court  found  the  teacher's speech "neither [was] shown nor can be presumed to have in 

any way either impeded the teacher's proper performance of his  daily  duties  in  the  classroom  or  to  have  interfered  with 
the regular operation of the schools generally."  Id., at 572- 573 (footnote omitted).  Thus, the Court concluded that "the 
interest of the school administration in limiting teachers' op-portunities to contribute to public debate is not significantly

Opinion of the Court 
greater than its interest in limiting a similar contribution by any member of the general public." 

Id., at 573. 
Pickering  and  the  cases  decided  in  its  wake  identify  two inquiries to guide interpretation of the constitutional protec-

tions accorded to public employee speech.  The first requires determining  whether  the  employee  spoke  as  a  citizen  on  a 
matter of  public concern.  See  id., at  568.  If  the  answer is 
no,  the  employee  has  no  First  Amendment  cause  of  action based  on  his  or  her  employer's  reaction  to  the  speech.  See 

Connick, supra, at 147.  If the answer is yes, then the possi-bility of a First Amendment claim arises.  The question be-
comes  whether  the  relevant  government  entity  had  an  ade-
quate justification for treating the employee differently from 
any other member of the general public.  See Pickering, 391 
U. S.,  at  568.  This  consideration  reflects  the  importance  of 
the  relationship  between  the  speaker's  expressions  and  em-
ployment.  A  government  entity  has  broader  discretion  to 
restrict  speech  when  it  acts  in  its  role  as  employer,  but  the 
restrictions  it  imposes  must  be  directed  at  speech  that  has 
some potential to affect the entity's operations. 

To  be  sure,  conducting  these  inquiries  sometimes  has 
proved difficult.  This is the necessary product of "the enor-
mous  variety  of  fact  situations  in  which  critical  statements 
by  teachers  and  other  public  employees  may  be  thought  by 
their  superiors . . . to  furnish  grounds  for  dismissal."  Id., 
at  569.  The  Court's  overarching  objectives,  though,  are 
evident. 

When  a  citizen  enters  government  service,  the  citizen  by 
necessity  must  accept  certain  limitations  on  his  or  her  free-
dom.  See, e. g., Waters v.  Churchill, 511 U. S. 661, 671 (1994) 
(plurality  opinion)  ("[T]he  government  as  employer  indeed 
has  far  broader  powers  than  does  the  government  as  sov-
ereign").  Government  employers,  like  private  employers, 
need  a  significant  degree  of  control  over  their  employees' 
words  and  actions;  without  it,  there  would  be  little  chance 
for  the  efficient  provision  of  public  services.  Cf.  Connick, 

547US2 Unit: $U58 [03-16-09 15:14:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court 
supra,  at  143  ("[G]overnment  offices  could  not  function  if every employment decision became a constitutional matter"). 

Public  employees,  moreover,  often  occupy  trusted  positions in  society.  When  they  speak  out,  they  can  express  views 
that  contravene  governmental  policies  or  impair  the  proper performance of governmental functions. 

At  the same  time, the  Court has  recognized  that  a citizen 
who works for the government is nonetheless a citizen.  The First  Amendment  limits  the  ability  of  a  public  employer  to 

leverage  the  employment  relationship  to  restrict,  inciden-tally  or  intentionally,  the  liberties  employees  enjoy  in  their 
capacities  as  private  citizens.  See  Perry  v.  Sindermann, 
408 U. S. 593, 597 (1972).  So long as employees are speaking 
as  citizens  about  matters  of  public  concern,  they  must  face 
only  those  speech  restrictions  that  are  necessary  for  their 
employers  to  operate  efficiently  and  effectively.  See,  e. g., 
Connick, supra, at 147 ("Our responsibility is to ensure that 
citizens  are  not  deprived  of  fundamental  rights  by  virtue  of 
working for the government"). 

The  Court's  employee-speech  jurisprudence  protects,  of 
course,  the  constitutional  rights  of  public  employees.  Yet 
the  First  Amendment  interests  at  stake  extend  beyond  the 
individual speaker.  The Court has acknowledged the impor-
tance  of  promoting  the  public's  interest  in  receiving  the 
well-informed  views  of  government  employees  engaging  in 
civic  discussion.  Pickering  again  provides  an  instructive 
example.  The  Court  characterized  its  holding  as  rejecting 
the  attempt of school administrators to "limi[t] teachers' op-
portunities  to  contribute  to  public  debate."  391  U. S.,  at 
573.  It also noted that teachers are "the members of a com-
munity  most  likely  to  have  informed  and  definite  opinions" 
about  school  expenditures.  Id.,  at  572.  The  Court's  ap-
proach acknowledged the necessity for informed, vibrant dia-
logue in a democratic society.  It suggested, in addition, that 
widespread  costs  may  arise  when  dialogue  is  repressed. 
The  Court's  more  recent  cases  have  expressed  similar  con-

Opinion of the Court 
cerns.  See,  e. g.,  San  Diego  v.  Roe,  543  U. S.  77,  82  (2004) (per curiam) ("Were [public employees] not able to speak on 

[the  operation  of  their  employers],  the  community  would  be deprived  of  informed  opinions  on  important  public  issues. 
The  interest  at  stake  is  as  much  the  public's  interest  in  re-ceiving informed opinion as it is the employee's own right to 
disseminate  it"  (citation  omitted));  cf.  Treasury  Employees, 513  U. S.,  at  470  ("The  large-scale  disincentive  to  Govern-
ment  employees'  expression  also  imposes  a  significant  bur-den on the  public's right to  read  and hear  what the  employ-
ees would otherwise have written and said"). The  Court's  decisions,  then,  have  sought  both  to  promote 
the  individual  and  societal  interests  that  are  served  when employees speak as citizens on matters of public concern and 
to respect the needs of government employers attempting to perform  their  important  public  functions.  See, 

e. g.,  Ran-kin, 483 U. S., at 384 (recognizing "the dual role of the public 

employer  as  a  provider  of  public  services  and  as  a  govern-ment  entity  operating  under  the  constraints  of  the  First 
Amendment").  Underlying  our  cases  has  been  the  premise that  while  the  First  Amendment  invests  public  employees 
with  certain  rights,  it  does  not  empower  them  to  "consti-tutionalize  the  employee  grievance." 

Connick,  461  U. S., at 154. 

III 
With these principles in mind we turn to the instant case. Respondent  Ceballos  believed  the  affidavit  used  to  obtain  a 

search  warrant  contained  serious  misrepresentations.  He conveyed  his  opinion  and  recommendation  in  a  memo  to  his 
supervisor.  That Ceballos expressed his views inside his of-fice,  rather  than  publicly,  is  not  dispositive.  Employees  in 
some cases may receive First Amendment protection for ex-pressions made  at work.  See, 

e. g., Givhan v.  Western Line Consol.  School  Dist.,  439  U. S.  410,  414  (1979).  Many  citi-

zens  do  much  of  their  talking  inside  their  respective  work-places,  and  it  would  not  serve  the  goal  of  treating  public

Opinion of the Court 
employees  like  "any  member  of the  general  public,"  Picker-
ing, 391 U. S., at 573, to hold that all speech within the office 
is automatically exposed to restriction. The  memo  concerned  the  subject  matter  of  Ceballos'  em-

ployment, but this, too, is nondispositive.  The First Amend-ment protects some expressions related to the speaker's job. 
See,  e. g.,  ibid.;  Givhan,  supra,  at  414.  As  the  Court  noted 
in  Pickering:  "Teachers  are,  as  a  class,  the  members  of  a community  most  likely  to  have  informed  and  definite  opin-

ions  as  to  how  funds  allotted  to  the  operation  of  the  schools should  be  spent.  Accordingly,  it  is  essential  that  they  be 
able  to  speak  out  freely  on  such  questions  without  fear  of 
retaliatory  dismissal."  391  U. S.,  at  572.  The same  is  true 
of many other categories of public employees. 

The controlling factor in Ceballos'  case is  that his expres-
sions were made pursuant to his duties as a calendar deputy. 
See Brief for Respondent  4 ("Ceballos  does not dispute  that 
he  prepared  the  memorandum  `pursuant  to  his  duties  as  a 
prosecutor' ").  That  consideration--the  fact  that  Ceballos 
spoke as a prosecutor fulfilling a responsibility  to advise  his 
supervisor about how best to proceed with a pending case-- 
distinguishes  Ceballos'  case  from  those  in  which  the  First 
Amendment provides protection against discipline.  We hold 
that  when  public  employees  make  statements  pursuant  to 
their  official  duties,  the  employees  are  not  speaking  as 
citizens  for  First  Amendment  purposes,  and  the  Constitu-
tion  does  not  insulate  their  communications  from  employer 
discipline. 

Ceballos  wrote  his  disposition  memo  because  that  is  part 
of what he, as a calendar deputy, was employed to do.  It is 
immaterial whether he  experienced  some personal  gratifica-
tion from writing the memo; his First Amendment rights do 
not  depend  on  his  job  satisfaction.  The  significant  point  is 
that  the  memo  was  written  pursuant  to  Ceballos'  official 
duties.  Restricting speech that owes its existence to a pub-
lic  employee's  professional  responsibilities  does  not  infringe

422  GARCETTI  v.  CEBALLOS 

Opinion of the Court 
any  liberties  the  employee  might  have  enjoyed  as  a  private citizen.  It  simply  reflects  the  exercise  of  employer  control 

over  what  the  employer  itself  has  commissioned  or  created. Cf. 

Rosenberger  v.  Rector  and  Visitors  of  Univ.  of  Va.,  515 
U. S.  819,  833  (1995)  ("[W]hen  the  government  appropriates public  funds  to  promote  a  particular  policy  of  its  own  it  is 

entitled to say what it wishes").  Contrast, for example, the 
expressions made by the speaker in Pickering, whose letter to the newspaper had no official significance and bore similar-

ities to letters submitted by numerous citizens every day. Ceballos  did  not  act  as  a citizen  when  he  went  about  con-
ducting  his  daily  professional  activities,  such  as  supervising 
attorneys,  investigating  charges,  and  preparing  filings.  In 
the same way he did not speak as a citizen by writing a memo 
that  addressed  the  proper  disposition  of  a  pending  criminal 
case.  When  he  went  to  work  and  performed  the  tasks  he 
was  paid  to  perform,  Ceballos  acted  as  a  government  em-
ployee.  The fact that his duties  sometimes required  him to 
speak  or  write  does  not  mean  his  supervisors  were  prohib-
ited from evaluating his performance. 

This  result  is  consistent  with  our  precedents'  attention  to 
the potential societal value of employee speech.  See supra, 
at 419-420.  Refusing to recognize First Amendment claims 
based on government employees' work product does not pre-
vent  them  from  participating  in  public  debate.  The  em-
ployees  retain  the  prospect  of  constitutional  protection  for 
their  contributions  to  the  civic  discourse.  This  prospect  of 
protection,  however,  does  not  invest  them  with  a  right  to 
perform their jobs however they see fit. 

Our  holding  likewise  is  supported  by  the  emphasis  of  our 
precedents  on  affording  government  employers  sufficient 
discretion  to  manage  their  operations.  Employers  have 
heightened  interests  in  controlling  speech  made  by  an  em-
ployee in his or her professional capacity.  Official communi-
cations  have  official  consequences,  creating  a  need  for  sub-
stantive  consistency  and  clarity.  Supervisors  must  ensure

Opinion of the Court 
that  their  employees'  official  communications  are  accurate, demonstrate  sound  judgment,  and  promote  the  employer's 

mission.  Ceballos'  memo  is  illustrative.  It  demanded  the attention of his supervisors and led to a heated meeting with 
employees from the sheriff 's department.  If Ceballos' supe-riors thought his memo was inflammatory or misguided, they 
had the authority to take proper corrective action. 

Ceballos' proposed contrary rule, adopted by the Court of Appeals,  would  commit  state  and  federal  courts  to  a  new, 

permanent,  and  intrusive  role,  mandating  judicial  oversight of communications between and among government employ-
ees  and  their  superiors  in  the  course  of  official  business. 
This displacement of managerial discretion by judicial super-
vision  finds  no  support  in  our  precedents.  When  an  em-
ployee  speaks  as  a  citizen  addressing  a  matter  of  public 
concern, the  First Amendment requires a  delicate balancing 
of  the  competing  interests  surrounding  the  speech  and  its 
consequences.  When, however, the employee is simply per-
forming his or her job duties, there is no warrant for a simi-
lar  degree  of  scrutiny.  To  hold  otherwise  would  be  to  de-
mand  permanent  judicial  intervention  in  the  conduct  of 
governmental operations to a degree inconsistent with sound 
principles of federalism and the separation of powers. 

The Court of Appeals based its holding in part on what it 
perceived  as  a  doctrinal  anomaly.  The  court  suggested  it 
would be inconsistent to compel public employers to tolerate 
certain employee speech made publicly but not speech made 
pursuant  to  an  employee's  assigned  duties.  See  361  F.  3d, 
at 1176.  This  objection  misconceives the  theoretical under-
pinnings  of  our  decisions.  Employees  who  make  public 
statements  outside  the  course  of  performing  their  official 
duties  retain  some  possibility  of  First  Amendment  protec-
tion  because  that  is  the  kind  of  activity  engaged  in  by  citi-
zens  who  do  not  work  for  the  government.  The  same  goes 
for  writing  a  letter  to  a  local  newspaper,  see  Pickering, 
supra,  or  discussing  politics  with  a  co-worker,  see  Rankin, 

547US2 Unit: $U58 [03-16-09 15:14:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN
424  GARCETTI  v.  CEBALLOS 

Opinion of the Court 
483  U. S.  378.  When  a  public  employee  speaks  pursuant  to employment  responsibilities,  however,  there  is  no  relevant 

analogue  to  speech  by  citizens  who  are  not  government employees. 

The Court of Appeals' concern also is unfounded as a prac-tical  matter.  The  perceived  anomaly,  it  should  be  noted,  is 
limited  in  scope:  It  relates  only  to  the  expressions  an  em-
ployee  makes  pursuant  to  his  or  her  official  responsibilities, not  to  statements  or  complaints  (such  as  those  at  issue  in 

cases like Pickering and Connick) that are made outside the duties  of  employment.  If,  moreover,  a  government  em-
ployer is troubled by the perceived anomaly, it has the means 
at  hand  to  avoid  it.  A  public  employer  that  wishes  to  en-
courage its employees to voice concerns privately retains the 
option of instituting internal policies and procedures that are 
receptive to employee criticism.  Giving employees an inter-
nal  forum  for  their  speech  will  discourage  them  from  con-
cluding that the safest avenue of expression is to state their 
views in public. 

Proper application of our precedents thus leads to the con-
clusion that the First Amendment does not prohibit manage-
rial discipline based on an employee's expressions made pur-
suant  to  official  responsibilities.  Because  Ceballos'  memo 
falls  into  this  category,  his  allegation  of  unconstitutional 
retaliation must fail. 

Two  final  points  warrant  mentioning.  First,  as  indicated 
above,  the  parties  in  this  case  do  not  dispute  that  Ceballos 
wrote  his  disposition  memo  pursuant  to  his  employment 
duties.  We thus have no occasion to articulate a comprehen-
sive framework for defining the scope of an employee's duties 
in cases where there is room for serious debate.  We reject, 
however, the suggestion that employers can restrict employ-
ees'  rights  by  creating  excessively  broad  job  descriptions.

Opinion of the Court 
they achieved, was to give National a competitive advantage over Ideal. 

The  second  cause  of  action  is  asserted  against  all  three petitioners.  It  alleges  a  violation  of  $ 1962(a),  which  makes 
it  unlawful  for  any  person  who  has  received  income  derived from  a  pattern  of  racketeering  activity  "to  use  or  invest" 
that  income  "in  acquisition  of  any  interest  in,  or  the  estab-
lishment or operation of," an enterprise engaged in or affect-ing  interstate  or  foreign  commerce.  As  described  in  the 

complaint, petitioners used funds generated by their fraudu-lent  tax  scheme  to  open  National's  Bronx  location.  The 
opening  of  this  new  facility  caused  Ideal  to  lose  "significant 
business and market share."  App. 18. 

Petitioners moved to dismiss Ideal's complaint under Fed-
eral Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 9(b).  The District 
Court  granted  the  Rule  12(b)(6)  motion,  holding  that  the 
complaint  failed  to  state  a  claim  upon  which  relief  could  be 
granted.  The  court  began  from  the  proposition  that  to  as-
sert a RICO  claim predicated on mail fraud or wire fraud, a 
plaintiff  must have  relied  on  the  defendant's  misrepresenta-
tions.  Ideal not having alleged that it relied on petitioners' 
false tax returns, the court concluded Ideal could not go for-
ward with its RICO claims. 

Ideal  appealed,  and  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Second 
Circuit  vacated  the  District  Court's  judgment.  373  F.  3d 
251 (2004).  Addressing Ideal's $ 1962(c) claim, the court held 
that where a complaint alleges a pattern of racketeering ac-
tivity  "that  was  intended  to  and  did  give  the  defendant  a 
competitive  advantage  over  the  plaintiff,  the  complaint  ade-
quately  pleads  proximate  cause,  and  the  plaintiff  has  stand-
ing  to  pursue  a civil  RICO  claim."  Id.,

Proper interpretation of $ 1964(c) required consideration of the  statutory  history,  which  revealed  that  "Congress  mod-

tive . . . is not a  panacea  that  will  enable  any  complaint  to withstand a  motion  to dismiss").  When  a court  evaluates a 

RICO  claim  for  proximate  causation,  the  central  question  it must ask is whether the alleged violation led directly  to the 
plaintiff 's  injuries.  In  the  instant  case,  the  answer  is  no. We  hold  that  Ideal's  $ 1962(c)  claim  does  not  satisfy  the  re-
quirement of proximate causation. Petitioners  alternatively  ask  us  to  hold,  in  line  with  the 
District Court's decision granting  petitioners' motion to dis-miss, that a plaintiff may not assert a RICO claim predicated 
on  mail  fraud  or  wire  fraud  unless  it  demonstrates  it  relied on  the  defendant's  misrepresentations.  They  argue  that 
RICO's  private  right  of  action  must  be  interpreted  in  light of  common-law  principles,  and  that  at  common  law  a  fraud 
action  requires  the  plaintiff  to  prove  reliance.  Because Ideal  has  not  satisfied  the  proximate-cause  requirement  ar-

In  March  1996,  petitioner  attempted  to  open  accounts  at seven  financial  institutions  using  counterfeit  $10  million 

United States bonds.  The quality of the counterfeiting was, to  put  it  mildly,  not  expert.  One  bond  purported  to  be  is-
sued  by  the  "Ministry  of  Finance  of  U. S. A."  401  F.  3d  36, 39  (CA2  2005)  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  Others 
contained  misspelled  words  such  as  "Thunted  States"  and the  "Onited  States"  (United  States),  "Dhtladelphla"  (Phila-

served  by  granting  the  continuance  outweigh  the  public's 
and  defendant's  interests  in  a  speedy  trial.  This  provision 
gives the district court discretion--within limits and subject 
to  specific  procedures--to  accommodate  limited  delays  for 
case-specific needs. 

To promote compliance with its requirements, the Act con-
tains  enforcement  and  sanctions  provisions.  If  a  trial  does 
not begin on time, the defendant may move, before the start 
of  trial  or  the  entry  of  a  guilty  plea,  to  dismiss  the  charges, 
and if a meritorious and timely motion to dismiss is filed, the 
district court must dismiss the charges, though it may choose 
whether  to  dismiss  with  or  without  prejudice.  In  making 
that  choice,  the  court  must  take  into  account,  among  other 
things, "the seriousness of the offense; the facts and circum-
stances of the case which led to the dismissal; and the impact 
of  a  reprosecution  on  the  administration  of  [the  Act]  and  on 
the administration of justice."  $ 3162(a)(2). 

This  scheme  is  designed  to  promote  compliance  with  the 
Act  without  needlessly  subverting  important  criminal  pros-
ecuti ons.  The  more  severe  sanction  (dismissal  with 
prejudice)  is  available  for  use  where  appropriate,  and  the 
knowledge that a violation could potentially result in the im-
position  of  this  sanction  gives  the  prosecution  a  powerful 
incentive  to  be  careful  about  compliance.  The  less  severe 
sanction  (dismissal  without  prejudice)  lets  the  court  avoid 
unduly impairing the enforcement of federal criminal laws-- 
though even this sanction imposes some costs on the prosecu-
tion  and  the  court,  which  further  encourages  compliance. 
When  an  indictment  is  dismissed  without  prejudice,  the 
prosecutor may of course seek--and in the great majority of 
cases  will  be  able  to  obtain--a  new  indictment,  for  even  if 
"the  period  prescribed  by  the  applicable  statute  of  limita-
tions  has  expired,  a  new  indictment  may  be  returned  .  .  . 
within  six  calendar  months  of  the  date  of  the  dismissal."

the  obvious  reason  that  they  have  the  greatest  incentive  to perform  this  task.

5  Second,  by  requiring  that  a  defendant 

move  before  the  trial  starts  or  a  guilty  plea  is  entered, $ 3162(a)(2)  both  limits  the  effects  of  a  dismissal  without 

pre judice  ( by  ensuring  that  an  expensive  and  time-consuming  trial  will  not  be  mooted  by  a  late-filed  motion 
under  the  Act)  and  prevents  undue  defense  gamesmanship.6 For  these  reasons,  we  reject  the  District  Court's  reliance 
on  $ 3162(a)(2)  and  conclude  a  defendant  may  not  prospec-tively waive the application of the Act.  It follows that peti-
tioner's waiver "for all time" was ineffective.  We therefore turn  to  the  Government's  alternative  grounds  in  support  of 
the result below.  IV 

A 
The  Government  contends  that  because  "petitioner's  ex-press  waiver  induced  the  district  court  to  grant  a  continu-

ance without making  an express ends-of-justice finding . . . ,  basic  principles  of  judicial  estoppel  preclude  petitioner  from 
enjoying the benefit of the continuance, but then challenging the  lack  of  a  finding."  Brief  for  United  States  10.  In  this 

5 The  possibility  of  obtaining a  dismissal  with  prejudice  plainly gives  a 
defendant  a  strong  incentive  to  police  compliance,  and  even  if  a  case  is 
dismissed  without  prejudice,  a  defendant  may  derive  some  benefit.  For 
example, the time and energy that the prosecution must expend in connec-
tion  with  obtaining  a  new  indictment  may  be  time  and  energy  that  the 
prosecution cannot devote to the preparation of its case. 

6 As  noted,  in  order  to  promote  compliance  with  the  Act,  Congress  set 

the minimum permissible penalty at a level that would impose some costs 
on the prosecution and the court without unduly interfering with the en-
forcement of  the criminal  laws.  By specifying  that a  defendant may not 
move  for  dismissal  once  the  trial  has  commenced  or  a  plea  has  been  en-
tered,  the  amount  of  inconvenience  resulting  from  a  dismissal  without 
prejudice  is  limited,  and  defendants  are  restricted  in  their  ability  to  use 
such  a  motion  for  strategic  purposes.  For  example,  defendants  cannot 
wait  to  see  how  a  trial  is  going  (or  how  it  comes  out)  before  moving  to 
dismiss.

Opinion of the Court 
additional  time  to  research  the  authenticity  of  the  bonds. None of these gives rise to an estoppel. 

First,  we  are  unwilling  to  recognize  an  estoppel  based  on petitioner's promise not to move for dismissal because doing 
so  would  entirely  swallow  the  Act's  no-waiver  policy.  We see  little  difference  between  granting  a  defendant's  request 
for  a  continuance  in  exchange  for  a  promise  not  to  move 
for  dismissal  and  permitting  a  prospective  waiver,  and  as we  hold  above,  prospective  waivers  are  inconsistent  with 

the Act. Second,  petitioner's  (mistaken)  agreement  that  Speedy 
Trial  Act  waivers  are  valid  also  does  not  provide  a  ground 
for  estoppel.  Petitioner  did  not  "succee[d]  in  persuading" 
the District Court to accept the proposition that prospective 
waivers  of  Speedy  Trial  Act  rights  are  valid.  On  the  con-
trary,  it  was  the  District  Court  that  requested  the  waiver 
and produced the form for petitioner to sign.  And while the 
other relevant  factors (clear inconsistency  and unfair advan-
tage  or  detriment)  might  in  isolation  support  the  Govern-
ment, we think they do not predominate where, as here, the 
Government  itself  accepted  the  District  Court's  interpreta-
tion without objection. 

Finally,  petitioner's  representation  to  the  District  Court 
at  the  January  31  status  conference  that  a  continuance  was 
needed to gather evidence of the bonds' authenticity does not 
support  the  Government's  estoppel  argument  because  the 
position that petitioner took then was not "clearly inconsist-
ent" with the position that he now takes in seeking dismissal 
of  the  indictment.  This  would  be  a  different  case  if  peti-
tioner had succeeded in persuading the District Court at the 
January 31 status conference that the factual predicate for a 
statutorily  authorized  exclusion  of  delay  could  be  estab-
lished--for example, if defense counsel had obtained a contin-
uance  only  by  falsely  representing  that  he  was  in  the  midst 
of working with an expert who might authenticate the bonds. 
In  fact,  however,  the  discussion  at  the  January  31  status

only  be  "granted . . .  on  the  basis  of  [the  court's]  findings"), the  Act  is  ambiguous  on  precisely when  those  findings must 

be "se[t] forth, in the record of the case."  However this am-biguity  is  resolved,  at  the  very  least  the  Act  implies  that 
those  findings  must  be  put  on  the  record  by  the  time  a  dis-trict  court  rules  on  a  defendant's  motion  to  dismiss  under 

$ 3162(a)(2).7  In  ruling  on  a  defendant's  motion  to  dismiss, the court must tally the unexcluded days.  This, in turn, re-
quires identifying the excluded days.  But $ 3161(h)(8)(A) is explicit that "[n]o . . .  period of  delay resulting from a contin-
uance  granted  by  the  court  in  accordance  with  this  para-graph shall be excludable . . . unless the court sets forth . . . 
its reasons for [its] finding[s]."  Thus, without on-the-record findings, there can be no exclusion under $ 3161(h)(8).  Here, 
the  District  Court  set  forth  no  such  findings  at  the  January 31  status  conference,  and  $ 3161(h)(8)(A)  is  not  satisfied  by 
the District Court's passing reference to the case's complex-ity  in  its  ruling  on  petitioner's  motion  to  dismiss.  There-
fore,  the  1997  continuance  is  not  excluded  from  the  speedy trial clock. 

The  Government  suggests  that  this  error,  stemming  as  it does  from  the  District  Court's  technical  failure  to  make  an 
express  finding,  may  be  regarded  as  harmless.  Brief  for United  States  31,  n.  8.  Harmless-error  review  under  Fed-

wife was missing.  Muncey asked Luttrell to watch the chil-dren while  he  searched for  his  wife.  After  he  left,  Luttrell 

talked with Lora.  According to Luttrell: 

"[Lora]  said  she  heard  a  horn  blow,  she  thought  she heard  a  horn  blow,  and  somebody  asked  if  Bubbie  was 

home,  and  her  mama,  you  know,  told  them--no.  And then  she  said  she  didn't  know  if  she  went  back  to  sleep 
or  not,  but  then  she  heard  her  mama  going  down  the steps  crying  and  I  am  not  sure  if  that  is  when  that  she 
told  me  that  she  heard  her  mama  say--oh  God,  no,  not me,  or  if  she  told  me  that  the  next  day,  but  I  do  know 
that she said she heard her mother going down the steps crying."  App. 14-15. 

While  Lora  was  talking,  Luttrell  recalled,  "Matt  kept  butt-ing in, you know, on us talking, and he said--sister they said 
daddy  had  a  wreck,  they  said  daddy  had  a  wreck."  Id.,

Opinion of the Court 
Utah.  House  had  scratches  on  his  arms  and  hands,  and  a knuckle on his right ring finger was bruised.  He attributed 

the  scratches  to  Turner's  cats  and  the  finger  injury  to  re-cent construction work tearing down  a shed.  The next day 
House  gave  a  similar  statement  to  a  different  TBI  agent, Charles Scott. 

In  fact  House  had  not  been  at  Turner's  home.  After  ini-
tially  supporting  House's  alibi,  Turner  informed  authorities that  House  left  her  trailer  around  10:30  or  10:45  p.m.  to  go 

for a walk.  According to Turner's trial testimony, House re-turned later--she was not sure when--hot and panting, miss-
ing his shirt and his shoes.  House, Turner testified, told her 
that while he was walking on the road near her home, a vehi-
cle  pulled  up  beside  him,  and  somebody  inside  "called  him 
some  names  and  then  they  told  him  he  didn't  belong  here 
anymore."  App.  89.  House  said  he  tried  to  ignore  the 
taunts  and  keep  walking,  but  the  vehicle  pulled  in  behind 
him, and "one of them got out and grabbed him by the shoul-
der  . .  . and  [House]  swung around  with  his  right  hand"  and 
"hit  something."  Ibid.

Opinion of the Court 
As  Turner  informed  the  jury,  House's  shoes  were  found several  months  after  the  crime  in  a  field  near  her  home. 

Turner  delivered  them  to  authorities.  Though  the  jury  did not  learn  of  this  fact  (and  House's  counsel  claims  he  did  not 
either), the State  tested the shoes for  blood and found none. House's shirt was not found. 

The  State's  closing  argument  suggested  that  on  the  night of  her  murder,  Mrs.  Muncey  "was  deceived . . .  .   She  had  
been told [her husband] had had an accident."  9 id.,

guilt-phase  verdict.  Before  the  attempt  House  wrote  his mother a letter professing his innocence. 

In closing the State urged the jury to find all three aggra-vating  factors  and  impose  death.  As  to  the  kidnaping  or 
rape factor, the prosecution suggested Mrs. Muncey was "de-coy[ed]  or entic[ed] . . .  away from  her  family, and confin[ed] 
against  her  will  because  you  know  that  as  she  was  being beaten to death."  10 Tr. 1410.  "We also think," the prose-
cutor  added, "the  proof shows  strong  evidence  of attempted sexual  molestation  of  the  victim  to  accompany  the  taking 
away  and  murdering  her."  Id.,

Opinion of the Court 
think  a  jury  would  have  given  this  evidence  great  weight. Quite  apart  from  providing  proof  of  motive,  it  was  the  only 

forensic  evidence  at  the  scene  that  would  link  House  to  the murder. 

Law and society, as they ought to do, demand accountabil-ity  when  a  sexual  offense  has  been  committed,  so  not  only 
did  this  evidence  link  House  to  the  crime;  it  likely  was  a factor in persuading the jury not to let him go free.  At sen-
tencing,  moreover,  the  jury  came  to  the  unanimous  conclu-sion,  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt,  that  the  murder  was  com-
mitted  in  the  course  of  a  rape  or  kidnaping.  The  alleged sexual  motivation  relates  to  both  those  determinations. 
This  is  particularly  so  given  that,  at  the  sentencing  phase, the  jury  was  advised  that  House  had  a  previous  conviction 
for sexual assault. A  jury  informed  that  fluids  on  Mrs.  Muncey's  garments 
could  have  come  from  House  might  have  found  that  House trekked the nearly two miles to the victim's home and lured 
her  away  in  order  to  commit  a  sexual  offense.  By  contrast a  jury  acting  without  the  assumption  that  the  semen  could 
have  come from  House  would  have  found it  necessary  to es-tablish  some  different  motive,  or,  if  the  same  motive,  an  in-
tent far more speculative.  When the only direct evidence of sexual  assault  drops  out  of  the  case,  so,  too,  does  a  central 
theme  in  the  State's  narrative  linking  House  to  the  crime. In that light, furthermore, House's odd evening walk and his 
false statements to authorities, while still potentially incrim-inating, might appear less suspicious.

Opinion of the Court 
half-full vial, which was also located near the stained corner. No  gauze  immediately  surrounding  the  completely  empty 

vial was stained.  The tape, moreover, circled the box in two layers, one underneath the other, and in one spot the under-
lying  layer  stops  cleanly  at  the  lid's  edge,  as  if  cut  with  a razor, and does not continue onto the body of the box below. 
In  House's  view  this  clean  cut  suggests  the  double  layers 
could  not  have  resulted  simply  from  wrapping  the  tape around twice, as the spatter expert claimed; rather, someone 

possessing  Tennessee  Crime  Lab  tape--perhaps  the  officers transporting  the  blood  and  pants--must  have  cut  the  box 
open  and  resealed  it,  possibly  creating  an  opportunity  for 
spillage.  Supporting the same inference, a label on the box's 
lid  lists  both  blood  and  vaginal  secretions  as  the  box's  con-
tents, though Agent Bigbee's records show the vaginal fluids 
arrived  at  the  FBI  in  a  separate  envelope.  Finally,  cross-
examination  revealed  that  Agent  Bigbee's  practice  did  not 
always match the letter of FBI policy.  Although Mrs. Mun-
cey's  bra  and  housecoat  were  packed  together  in  a  single 
bag,  creating,  according  to  Agent  Bigbee,  a  risk  of  "cross 
contamination,"  id.,

Opinion of the Court 
her  testimony,  as  we  understand  it,  does  not  refute  the  hy-pothesis  that  the  packaging  of  the  pants  for  transport  was 

what caused them to be folded or creased.  It seems permis-sible, moreover, to conclude that the small size and wide dis-
tribution  of  stains--inside  the  right  pocket,  outside  that pocket,  near  the  inside  button,  on  the  left  thigh  and  outside 
leg,  on  the  seat  of  the  pants,  and  on  the  right  bottom  cuff, 
including inside the pants--fits as well with spillage in trans-port as with wiping and smearing from bloody objects at the 

crime  scene, as  the State proposes.  (As has  been noted,  no blood was found on House's shoes.) 

The  District  Court  discounted  Dr.  Blake's  opinion,  not  on 
account  of  Blake's  substantive  approach,  but  based  on  tes-
timony  from  Agent  Scott  indicating  he  saw,  as  the  District 
Court  put  it,  "what  appeared  to  be  bloodstains  on  Mr. 
House's  blue  jeans  when  the  jeans  were  removed  from  the 
laundry  hamper  at Ms.  Turner's trailer."  Id.,

Opinion of the Court 

$ 922.10  (1987).  On  January  14,  2000--four  days  after  the conclusion of Hill's first, unsuccessful round of federal habeas 

corpus litigation--Florida amended the controlling statute to provide:  "A  death  sentence  shall  be  executed  by  lethal  in-
jection,  unless  the  person  sentenced  to  death  affirmatively elects to  be executed  by  electrocution."  $ 922.105(1) (2003). 
The  now-controlling  statute,  which  has  not  been  changed  in

Opinion of the Court 

II 
"Federal  law  opens  two  main  avenues  to  relief  on  com-
plaints related to imprisonment: a petition for habeas corpus, 
28  U. S. C.  $ 2254,  and  a  complaint  under  the  Civil  Rights 
Act of 1871, Rev. Stat. $ 1979, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. 
Challenges  to  the  validity  of  any  confinement  or  to  particu-
lars affecting its duration are the province of habeas corpus."

ary rule is inapplicable.  Pp. 590-594. 

(c)  The social costs to be weighed against deterrence are considerable 
here.  In addition to the grave adverse consequence that excluding rele-
vant  incriminating  evidence  always  entails--the  risk  of  releasing  dan-
gerous  criminals--imposing  such  a  massive  remedy  would  generate  a 
constant  flood  of  alleged  failures  to  observe  the  rule,  and  claims  that 
any asserted justification for a no-knock entry had inadequate support. 
Another  consequence  would  be  police  officers'  refraining  from  timely 
entry  after  knocking  and  announcing,  producing  preventable  violence 
against  the  officers  in  some  cases,  and  the  destruction  of  evidence  in 
others.  Next  to  these  social  costs  are  the  deterrence  benefits.  The 
value of deterrence depends on the strength of the incentive to commit 
the  forbidden  act.  That  incentive  is  minimal  here,  where  ignoring 
knock-and-announce can realistically be expected to achieve nothing but 
the prevention of evidence destruction and avoidance of life-threatening 
resistance, dangers which suspend the requirement when there is "rea-
sonable suspicion" that they exist, Richards

Sixth  Amendment  rights  by  denying  him  prompt  access  to counsel?  Many  would  regard these  violated  rights  as  more 
significant  than  the  right  not  to  be  intruded  upon  in  one's nightclothes--and  yet  nothing  but  "ineffective"  civil  suit  is

be persuasive only if we stopped reading right there, and we do  not  stop  there;  we  do  not  read  statutes  in  little  bites. 
And,  as  just  noted,  if  we  did  read  the  removal  power  that broadly there would be no point to the phrase "as set forth in 
subsection (b)," for subsection (b) cases would be removable anyway  as  a  subset  of  covered  class  actions.

Opinion of the Court 

$ 507(a)(5) priority also encompasses claims for unpaid premi-
ums on a policy purchased by an employer to cover its work-
ers' compensation liability.  We hold that premiums owed by 
an  employer  to  a  workers'  compensation  carrier  do  not  fit 
within $ 507(a)(5). 

Workers'  compensation  laws  ensure  that  workers  will  be 
compensated for work-related injuries whether or not negli-
gence  of  the  employer  contributed  to  the  injury.  To  that 
extent,  arrangements  for  the  payment  of  compensation 
awards  might  be  typed  "employee  benefit  plan[s]."  On  the 
other hand, statutorily prescribed workers' compensation re-
gimes  do  not  run  exclusively  to  the  employees'  benefit.  In 
this  regard,  they  differ  from  privately  ordered,  employer-
funded pension and welfare plans that, together with wages, 
remunerate  employees  for  services  rendered.  Employers, 
too,  gain  from  workers'  compensation  prescriptions.  In  ex-
change  for  no-fault  liability,  employers  gain  immunity  from 
tort  actions  that  might  yield  damages  many  times  higher 
than  awards  payable  under  workers'  compensation  sched-
ules.  Although  the  question  is  close,  we  conclude  that  pre-
miums  paid  for  workers'  compensation  insurance  are  more 
appropriately bracketed with premiums paid for other liabil-
ity  insurance,  e.

ries, [and] commissions" priority, $ 507(a)(4), to include fringe benefits.  Instead, Congress created a new priority for such 
benefits,  one  step  lower  than  the  wage  priority.  The  new provision,  currently  contained  in  $ 507(a)(5),  allows  the  pro-
vider  of  an  employee  benefit  plan  to  recover  unpaid  pre-miums--albeit  only  after  the  employees'  claims  for  "wages, 
salaries, or commissions" have been paid.  $ 507(a)(4). Beyond  genuine  debate,  the  main  office  of  $ 507(a)(5)  is  to 
capture portions of employee compensation for services ren-dered  not  covered  by  $ 507(a)(4).  Cf.

FEHBA  contains  a  preemption  clause,  $ 8902(m)(1),  dis-placing state law on issues relating to "coverage or benefits" 

afforded  by  health-care  plans.  The  Act  contains  no  provi-sion  addressing  the  subrogation  or  reimbursement  rights  of 
carriers.  Successive  annual  contracts  between  OPM  and the  Blue  Cross  Blue  Shield  Association  (BCBSA)  have  obli-
gated  the  carrier  to  make  "a  reasonable  effort"  to  recoup amounts  paid  for  medical  care.  App.  95,  125.  The  state-

Opinion of the Court 
disputes over coverage or benefits into federal court by des-ignating  a  United  States  agency  (OPM)  sole  defendant,  no 

law  opens  federal  courts  to  carriers  seeking  reimbursement from  beneficiaries  or  recovery  from  tortfeasors.  Cf.  29 
U. S. C.  $ 1132(e)(1)  (provision  of  the  Employee  Retirement Income  Security  Act  (ERISA)  vesting  in  federal  district 
courts "exclusive jurisdiction  of civil actions under  this sub-
chapter").  And  nothing  in  FEHBA's  text  prescribes  a  fed-eral  rule  of  decision  for  a  carrier's  claim  against  its  insured 

or  an  alleged  tortfeasor  to  share  in  the  proceeds  of  a  state-court tort action. 

II 
Petitioner  Empire  HealthChoice  Assurance,  Inc.,  doing 
business  as  Empire  Blue  Cross  Blue  Shield  (Empire),  is  the entity that administers the BCBSA Plan as it applies to fed-

eral  employees  in  New  York  State.  Respondent  Denise Finn  McVeigh  (McVeigh)  is  the  administrator  of  the  estate 
of  Joseph  E.  McVeigh  (Decedent),  a  former  enrollee  in  the Plan.  The  Decedent  was  injured  in  an  accident  in  1997. 
Plan payments for the medical care he received between 1997 and  his  death  in  2001  amounted  to  $157,309.  McVeigh,  on 
behalf  of  herself,  the  Decedent,  and  a  minor  child,  com-menced  tort  litigation  in  state  court  against  parties  alleged 
to  have  caused  Decedent's  injuries.  On  learning  that  the 
parties  to  the  state-court  litigation  had  agreed  to  settle  the tort  claims,  Empire  sought  to  recover  the  $157,309  it  had 

paid out for the Decedent's medical care.2  Of the $3,175,000 for  which  the  settlement  provided,  McVeigh,  in  response  to 
Empire's  asserted  reimbursement  right,  agreed  to  place $100,000 in escrow. 

Empire then filed suit in the United States District Court for  the  Southern  District  of  New  York,  alleging  that  Mc-

2 At  oral  argument,  counsel  for  respondent  McVeigh  represented  that 
"most of  the [reimbursement claims] are not of th[is]  magnitude";  "[m]ost 
of the cases involve [amounts like] $5,500 and $6,500."  Tr. of Oral Arg. 52.

illness.  See 16 G. Couch, Cyclopedia of Insurance Law $ 61:1 (2d  ed.  1982).  Had  Empire  taken  that  course,  no  access  to 

a  federal  forum  could  have  been  predicated  on  the  OPM- BCBSA  contract  right.  The  tortfeasors'  liability,  whether 
to  the  insured  or  the  insurer,  would  be  governed  not  by  an agreement  to  which  the  tortfeasors  are  strangers,  but  by 
state law, and $ 8902(m)(1) would have no sway. 

In  sum,  the  presentations  before  us  fail  to  establish  that $ 8902(m)(1)  leaves  no  room  for  any  state  law  potentially 

bearing  on  federal  employee-benefit  plans  in  general,  or carrier-reimbursement  claims  in  particular.  Accordingly, 
we  extract  from  $ 8902(m)(1)  no  prescription  for  federal-court jurisdiction. 

C 
We turn finally to the argument that Empire's reimburse-
ment  claim,  even  if  it  does  not  qualify  as  a  "cause  of  action created  by  federal  law,"  nevertheless  arises  under  federal 

law  for  $ 1331  purposes,  because  federal  law  is  "a  necessary element  of the  [carrier's] claim  for relief."  Brief  for United

Opinion of the Court 
Veigh's  counsel  represented  without  contradiction,  is  fact-
bound  and  situation-specific.  McVeigh  contends  that  there 
were  overcharges  or  duplicative  charges  by  care  providers, 
and  seeks  to  determine  whether  particular  services  were 
properly  attributed  to  the  injuries  caused  by  the  1997  acci-
dent and not rendered for a reason unrelated to the accident. 
See Tr. of Oral Arg. 44, 53. 

The  United  States  observes  that  a  claim  for  reimburse-
ment  may  also  involve  as  an  issue  "[the]  extent,  if  any,  to 
which  the  reimbursement  should  take  account  of  attorney's 
fees  expended . . .  to  obtain the  tort  recovery."  Brief  as

Syllabus 
1.  The  phrase  "the  waters  of  the  United  States"  includes  only  those 
relatively  permanent,  standing or  continuously flowing bodies  of water 
"forming  geographic  features"  that  are  described  in  ordinary  parlance 
as "streams," "oceans, rivers, [and] lakes," Webster's New International 
Dictionary  2882  (2d  ed.),  and  does  not  include  channels  through  which 
water flows intermittently or ephemerally, or channels that periodically 
provide  drainage  for  rainfall.  The  Corps'  expansive  interpretation  of 
that phrase is thus not "based on a permissible construction of the stat-
ute."  Chevron  U.  S.  A.  Inc.  v.  Natural  Resources  Defense  Council, 
Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843.  Pp. 730-739. 

(a)  While the meaning of "navigable waters" in the CWA is broader 
than  the  traditional  definition  found  in  The  Daniel  Ball,  10  Wall.  557, 
see Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v.  Army Corps of Engi-
neers,  531  U. S.  159,  167  (SWANCC);  United  States  v.  Riverside  Bay-
view Homes, Inc., 474 U. S. 121, 133, the CWA authorizes federal juris-
diction  only  over  "waters."  The  use  of  the  definite  article  "the"  and 
the plural number "waters" show plainly that $ 1362(7) does not refer to 
water  in  general,  but  more  narrowly  to  water  "[a]s  found  in  streams," 
"oceans,  rivers,  [and]  lakes,"  Webster's  New  International  Dictionary 
2882  (2d  ed.).  Those  terms  all  connote  relatively  permanent  bodies  of 
water, as opposed to ordinarily dry channels through which water occa-
sionally or intermittently flows.  Pp. 730-734. 

(b)  The Act's  use of the traditional phrase  "navigable waters" fur-
ther  confirms  that  the  CWA  confers  jurisdiction  only  over  relatively 
permanent bodies of water.  Traditionally, such "waters" included only 
discrete  bodies  of  water,  and  the  term  still  carries  some  of  its  original 
substance, SWANCC, supra, at 172.  This Court's subsequent interpre-
tation  of  "the  waters  of  the  United  States"  in  the  CWA  likewise  con-
firms  this  limitation.  See,  e. g.,  Riverside  Bayview,  supra,  at  131. 
And the CWA itself categorizes the channels and conduits that typically 
carry  intermittent  flows  of  water  separately  from  "navigable  waters," 
including  them  in  the  definition  of  " `point  sources,' "  33  U. S. C. 

$ 1362(14).  Moreover,  only  the  foregoing  definition  of  "waters"  is  con-
sistent with the CWA's stated policy "to recognize, preserve, and protect 
the  primary  responsibilities  and  rights  of  the  States . . . to  plan  the 
development and use . . . of land and water resources . . . ."  $ 1251(b). 
In  addition,  "the  waters  of  the  United  States"  hardly  qualifies  as  the 
clear and manifest statement from Congress needed to authorize intru-
sion into such  an area of traditional state authority as land-use regula-
tion;  and  to  authorize  federal  action  that  stretches  the  limits  of  Con-
gress's  commerce  power.  See  SWANCC,  supra,  at  173.  Pp.  734-739. 

2.  A wetland may not be considered "adjacent to" remote "waters of 
the  United  States"  based  on  a  mere  hydrologic  connection.  Riverside

Bayview rested on an inherent ambiguity in defining where the "water" 
ends and its abutting ("adjacent") wetlands begin, permitting the Corps 
to  rely  on  ecological  considerations  only  to  resolve  that  ambiguity  in 
favor  of  treating  all  abutting  wetlands  as  waters.  Isolated  ponds  are 
not  "waters  of  the  United  States"  in  their  own  right,  see  SWANCC, 
supra, at 167, 171, and present no boundary-drawing problem justifying 
the  invocation  of  such  ecological  factors.  Thus,  only  those  wetlands 
with  a  continuous  surface  connection  to  bodies  that  are  "waters  of  the 
United States" in their own right, so that there is no clear demarcation 
between  the  two,  are  "adjacent"  to  such  waters  and  covered  by  the 
Act.  Establishing coverage of the Rapanos and Carabell sites requires 
finding  that  the  adjacent  channel  contains  a  relatively  permanent 
"wate[r] of the United  States," and that each  wetland has a  continuous 
surface connection to that water, making it difficult to determine where 
the water ends and the wetland begins.  Pp. 739-742. 

3.  Because  the  Sixth  Circuit  applied  an  incorrect  standard  to  deter-
mine whether the wetlands at  issue are covered "waters," and because 
of the paucity of the record, the cases are remanded for further proceed-
ings.  P. 757.

"navigable waters."  Because the Corps' theory of jurisdiction in these 
cases--adjacency  to  tributaries,  however  remote  and  insubstantial-- 
goes beyond the Riverside Bayview holding, its assertion of jurisdiction 
cannot  rest  on that case.  The breadth of  the Corps' existing standard 
for  tributaries--which  seems  to  leave  room  for  regulating  drains, 
ditches, and streams remote from any navigable-in-fact water and carry-
ing  only  minor  water-volumes  toward  it--precludes  that  standard's 
adoption  as  the  determinative  measure  of  whether  adjacent  wetlands 
are likely to play an important role in the integrity of an aquatic system 
comprising navigable waters as traditionally understood.  Absent more 
specific  regulations,  the  Corps  must  establish  a  significant  nexus  on  a 
case-by-case  basis  when  seeking  to  regulate  wetlands  based  on  adja-
cency to nonnavigable tributaries, in order to avoid unreasonable appli-
cations  of  the  Act.  In  the  instant  cases  the  record  contains  evidence 
pointing to a possible significant nexus, but neither the agency nor the 
reviewing courts considered  the issue in these terms.  Thus, the cases 
should be remanded for further proceedings.  Pp. 759-787.

told the police when  they arrived that things were  fine, and the  officer 
questioning her was seeking to determine not what was happening but 
what had happened.  Objectively viewed, the primary, if not sole, pur-
pose  of  the  interrogation  was  to  investigate  a  possible  crime.  While 
the formal features of Crawford's interrogation strengthened her state-
ments' testimonial aspect, such features were not essential to the point. 
In  both  cases,  the  declarants  were  separated  from  the  defendants,  the 
statements  recounted  how  potentially  criminal  past  events  began  and 
progressed, and the interrogation took place some time after the events 
were  over.  For  the same  reasons the comparison  to Crawford

least the initial interrogation conducted in connection with a 911  call,  is  ordinarily  not  designed  primarily  to  "establis[h]

type  of  crime  is  notoriously  susceptible  to  intimidation  or 
coercion  of  the  victim  to  ensure  that  she  does  not  testify  at 
trial.  When this occurs, the Confrontation Clause gives the 
criminal a windfall.  We may not, however, vitiate constitu-
tional  guarantees  when  they  have  the  effect  of  allowing  the 
guilty  to  go  free.  Cf.  Kyllo

Opinion of the Court 
er's status as a parolee, Officer Rohleder searched petitioner. During the search, Officer Rohleder found a cigarette box in 

petitioner's  left  breast  pocket.  Inside  the  box  he  found  a plastic baggie containing methamphetamine. 

The  State  charged  petitioner  with  possession  of  metham-phetamine  pursuant  to  Cal.  Health  &  Safety  Code  Ann. 

$ 11377(a)  (West  1991).  The  trial  court  denied  petitioner's motion  to  suppress  the  methamphetamine  evidence,  finding 
that  Cal.  Penal  Code  Ann.  $ 3067(a)  (West  2000)  authorized the  search  and  that  the  search  was  not  "arbitrary  or  capri-
cious."  App. 62-63 (Proceedings on Motion to Supress).  A jury  convicted  petitioner  of  the  possession  charge,  and  the 
trial court sentenced him to seven years' imprisonment. The  California  Court  of  Appeal  affirmed.  Relying  on

Opinion of the Court 
California's  system  of  parole  is  consistent  with  these  ob-servations: A  California inmate  may serve his parole  period 

either  in  physical  custody,  or  elect  to  complete  his  sentence out  of  physical  custody  and  subject  to  certain  conditions. 
Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 3060.5 (West 2000).  Under the latter option,  an  inmate-turned-parolee  remains  in  the  legal  cus-
tody  of  the  California  Department  of  Corrections  through the  remainder  of  his  term,  $ 3056,  and  must  comply  with  all 
of  the  terms  and  conditions  of  parole,  including  mandatory drug  tests,  restrictions  on  association  with  felons  or  gang 
members, and mandatory meetings with parole officers, Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, $ 2512 (2005); Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 3067 
(West  2000).  See  also  Morrissey,

The  State's  interests,  by  contrast,  are  substantial.  This Court  has  repeatedly  acknowledged  that  a  State  has  an 

" `overwhelming  interest' "  in  supervising  parolees  because "parolees.  .  .  are  more  likely  to  commit  future  criminal  of-
fenses."  Pennsylvania

tences.  The  issue,  accordingly,  is  of  great  importance  to  such prisoners.  Given  the  numbers  affected  and  the  expense  of  hous-
ing  prisoners,  it  surely  also  has  a  significant  impact  on  the  pub-lic  fisc. 

The  fact  that  10  Courts  of  Appeals  have  either  agreed  with,  or deferred to, the Government's interpretation provides a principled 
basis  for  denying  these  certiorari  petitions.  Nevertheless,  I think it appropriate to  emphasize that the Court's action does not 
constitute a ruling on the merits and certainly does not represent an  expression  of  any  opinion  concerning  the  wisdom  of  the  Gov-
ernment's  position.  As  demonstrated  by  the  thoughtful  opinion prepared  by  Magistrate  Judge  Stephen  Smith,  363  F.  Supp.  2d 
882  (SD  Tex.)  (case  below  in  No.  05-8268),  rev'd,  431  F.  3d  180 (CA5  2005),  both  the  text  and  the  history  of  the  statute  strongly 
suggest that it was not intended to alter the pre-existing approach of  calculating  good-time  credit  based  on  the  sentence  imposed. 

Despite  its  technical  character,  the  question  has  sufficient  im-portance  to  merit  further  study,  not  only  by  judges  but  by  other 
Government  officials  as  well.  Nine  out  of  ten  Circuits  have  rec-
ognized  that  the  Federal  Bureau  of  Prisons  has  the  discretion 
to  adopt  petitioners'  approach,  and  Congress  of  course  has  the power  to  clarify  the  matter.  Indeed,  Congress  has  done  so  once 

before--in  1959  Congress  amended  the  predecessor  statute  to $ 3624(b)  for  the  specific  purpose  of  undoing  a  judicial  determina-
tion  that  credit  should  be  based  on  time  served  rather  than  on the  sentence  imposed.  See  Pub.  L.  86-259,  73  Stat.  546;  see  also 
H.  R.  Rep.  No.  935,  86th  Cong.,  1st  Sess.  (1959).  Congress  re-
jected  this  judicial  determination  because  it  had  the  troubling effect  of  "requir[ing]  well-behaved  prisoners  to  serve  longer  sen-

tences  of  confinement  than  they  would  under  the  method  of  com-putation  which  has  been  used  through  half  a  century."

AMENDMENTS  TO  THE  FEDERAL  RULES 

OF  BANKRUPTCY  PROCEDURE 

Rule 1009.  Amendments of voluntary petitions, lists, sched-

ules and statements. . . . . . 

(c)  Statement  of  social  security  number.--If  a  debtor  be-comes  aware  that  the  statement  of  social  security  number 
submitted  under  Rule  1007(f)  is  incorrect,  the  debtor  shall promptly  submit  an  amended  verified  statement  setting 
forth  the  correct  social  security  number.  The  debtor  shall 
give  notice  of  the  amendment  to  all  of  the  entities  required 
to be included on the list filed under Rule 1007(a)(1) or (a)(2). 

(d)  Transmission  to  United  States  trustee.--The  clerk 
shall  promptly  transmit  to the  United States  trustee a  copy 
of every amendment filed or submitted under subdivision (a), 
(b), or (c) of this rule. 

Rule 5005.  Filing and transmittal of papers. 

(a)  Filing. . . . . . 

(2)  Filing by electronic means.--A court may by local 
rule  permit  or  require  documents  to  be  filed,  signed,  or 
verified  by  electronic  means  that  are  consistent  with 
technical  standards,  if  any,  that  the  Judicial  Conference 
of  the  United  States  establishes.  A  local  rule  may  re-
quire  filing  by  electronic  means  only  if  reasonable  ex-
ceptions  are  allowed.  A  document  filed  by  electronic 
means in compliance with a local rule constitutes a writ-
ten  paper  for  the  purpose  of  applying  these  rules,  the 
Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  made  applicable  by 
these rules, and $ 107 of the Code. .  . . . .

States  trustee,  the  trustee,  the  attorney  for  the  trustee,  a bankruptcy  judge,  a  district  judge,  the  clerk  of  the  bank-
ruptcy appellate panel, or the clerk of the district court shall, after the date of its receipt has been noted thereon, be trans-
mitted  forthwith  to  the  clerk  of  the  bankruptcy  court.  A paper  intended  to  be  transmitted  to  the  United  States 
trustee  but  erroneously  delivered  to  the  clerk,  the  trustee, the  attorney  for  the  trustee,  a  bankruptcy  judge,  a  district

has  been  noted  thereon,  be  transmitted  forthwith  to  the United  States  trustee.  In  the  interest  of  justice,  the  court 
may  order  that  a  paper  erroneously  delivered  shall  be deemed  filed  with  the  clerk  or  transmitted  to  the  United 
States trustee as of the date of its original delivery. 
Rule 7004.  Process; service of summons, complaint. . . . . .

(b)  Procedure.--The request shall set forth, either by indi-vidual  item  or  by  category,  the  items  to  be  inspected,  and 

describe  each  with  reasonable  particularity.  The  request shall specify a reasonable time, place, and manner of making 
the inspection and performing the related acts.  The request may specify the form or forms in which electronically stored 
information  is  to  be  produced.  Without  leave  of  court  or written  stipulation,  a  request  may  not  be  served  before  the 
time specified in Rule 26(d). The  party  upon  whom  the  request  is  served  shall  serve  a 
written  response  within  30  days  after  the  service  of  the  re-quest.  A  shorter  or  longer  time  may  be  directed  by  the 
court or, in the absence of such an order, agreed to in writing by the parties, subject to Rule 29.  The response shall state, 
with  respect  to  each  item  or  category,  that  inspection  and related  activities  will  be  permitted  as  requested,  unless  the 
request  is  objected  to,  including  an  objection  to  the  re-quested form or forms for producing electronically stored in-
formation,  stating  the  reasons  for  the  objection.  If  objec-tion is made to part of an item or category, the part shall be 
specified  and  inspection  permitted  of  the  remaining  parts. If objection is made to the  requested form or forms for pro-
ducing  electronically  stored  information--or  if  no  form  was specified  in  the  request--the  responding  party  must  state 
the  form  or  forms  it  intends  to  use.  The  party  submitting the  request  may  move  for  an  order  under  Rule  37(a)  with 
respect to any objection to or other failure to respond to the request or any  part thereof,  or any failure to permit inspec-
tion as requested. Unless  the  parties  otherwise  agree,  or  the  court  other-
wise orders: 

(i)  a  party  who  produces  documents  for  inspection shall produce  them as they are kept  in the  usual course 

of  business  or  shall  organize  and  label  them  to  corre-spond with the categories in the request; 

(ii)  if a request does not specify the form or forms for producing  electronically  stored  information,  a  respond-
ing  party  must  produce  the  information  in  a  form  or

jurisdiction  sitting  in  the  place  of  the  deposition,  hear-
ing,  trial,  production,  inspection,  copying,  testing,  or

the  United  States  provides  therefor,  the  court  upon 
proper  application  and  cause  shown  may  authorize  the 
service  of  a  subpoena  at  any  other  place.  A  subpoena 
directed  to  a  witness  in  a  foreign  country  who  is  a  na-

1250  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

(B)  Subject  to  paragraph  (d)(2)  of  this  rule,  a  person commanded  to  produce  and  permit  inspection,  copying, 

testing, or sampling may, within 14 days after service of the subpoena or before the time specified for compliance 
if such time is less than 14 days after service, serve upon the  party  or  attorney  designated  in  the  subpoena  writ-
ten  objection  to  producing  any  or  all  of  the  designated materials or inspection of the premises--or to producing 
electronically  stored  information  in  the  form  or  forms requested.  If  objection  is  made,  the  party  serving  the 
subpoena  shall  not  be  entitled  to  inspect,  copy,  test,  or sample the materials or inspect the premises except pur-
suant  to  an  order  of  the  court  by  which  the  subpoena 
was issued.  If objection has been made, the party serv-ing  the  subpoena  may,  upon  notice  to  the  person  com-

manded  to  produce,  move  at  any  time  for  an  order  to compel  the  production,  inspection,  copying,  testing,  or 
sampling.  Such  an  order  to  compel  shall  protect  any person  who  is  not  a  party  or  an  officer  of  a  party  from 
significant  expense  resulting  from  the  inspection,  copy-ing, testing, or sampling commanded. 

(3)(A)  On  timely  motion,  the  court  by  which  a  sub-poena  was  issued  shall  quash  or  modify  the  subpoena 
if it 

(i)  fails  to  allow  reasonable  time  for  compliance; (ii)  requires  a  person  who  is  not  a  party  or  an 

officer of a party to travel to a place more than 100 miles  from  the  place  where  that  person  resides,  is 
employed or regularly transacts business in person, except  that,  subject  to  the  provisions  of  clause 
(c)(3)(B)(iii) of this rule, such a person may in order to  attend  trial  be  commanded  to  travel  from  any 
such  place  within  the  state  in  which  the  trial  is held; 

(iii)  requires  disclosure  of  privileged  or  other protected  matter  and  no  exception  or  waiver  ap-
plies; or 

(iv)  subjects a person to undue burden.

(i)  requires  disclosure  of  a  trade  secret  or  other 
confidential  research,  development,  or  commercial

rial  that  cannot  be  otherwise  met  without  undue 
hardship  and  assures  that  the  person  to  whom  the 
subpoena  is  addressed  will  be  reasonably  compen-
sated,  the  court  may  order  appearance  or  produc-
tion only upon specified conditions.

compel  discovery  or  to  quash,  the  person  from  whom 
discovery  is  sought  must  show  that  the  information 
sought  is  not  reasonably  accessible  because  of  undue 
burden or cost.  If that showing is made, the court may 
nonetheless order discovery from such sources if the re-
questing party shows good cause, considering the limita-
tions of Rule 26(b)(2)(C).  The court may  specify condi-
tions for the discovery. 

(2)(A)  When  information  subject  to  a  subpoena  is 
withheld  on  a  claim  that  it  is  privileged  or  subject  to 
protection as trial-preparation materials, the claim shall 
be made expressly  and shall be supported  by a descrip-
tion of the nature of the documents, communications, or 
things  not  produced  that  is  sufficient  to  enable  the  de-
manding party to contest the claim. 

(B)  If  information  is  produced  in  response  to  a  sub-
poena that is subject to a claim of privilege or of protec-
tion as trial-preparation material, the person making the 
claim  may  notify  any  party  that  received  the  informa-
tion of the claim and the basis for it.  After being noti-
fied, a party must promptly return, sequester, or destroy 
the  specified information and any  copies  it  has  and may 
not use or disclose the information until the claim is re-
solved.  A  receiving  party  may  promptly  present  the 
information  to  the  court  under  seal  for  a  determination 
of the claim.  If the receiving party disclosed the infor-
mation  before  being  notified,  it  must  take  reasonable 
steps  to  retrieve  it.  The  person  who  produced  the  in-
formation must preserve the information until the claim 
is resolved. 

(e)  Contempt.--Failure  of  any  person  without  adequate 
excuse  to  obey  a  subpoena  served  upon  that  person  may  be 
deemed  a  contempt  of  the  court  from  which  the  subpoena 
issued.  An adequate cause for failure to obey exists when a 
subpoena  purports  to  require  a  nonparty  to  attend  or 
produce  at  a  place  not  within  the  limits  provided  by  clause 
(ii) of subparagraph (c)(3)(A).

proved  by  the  court  or  clerk,  or  by  stipulation  of  the 
parties, conditioned to answer the judgment of the court 
or of any appellate court.  The parties may stipulate the

amount  and  nature  of  such  security.  In  the  event  of 
the  inability  or refusal of the  parties so to stipulate  the 
court  shall  fix  the  principal  sum  of  the  bond  or  stipula-
tion  at  an  amount  sufficient  to  cover  the  amount  of  the 
plaintiff 's  claim  fairly  stated  with  accrued  interest  and 
costs;  but  the  principal  sum  shall  in  no  event  exceed 
(i)  twice  the  amount  of  the  plaintiff 's  claim  or  (ii)  the 
value  of  the  property  on  due  appraisement,  whichever 
is smaller.  The bond or stipulation shall be conditioned

does not  address an issue, Supplemental Rules  C and E and 
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure also apply. 

(2)  Complaint.--The complaint must: 

(a)  be verified; 
(b)  state  the  grounds  for  subject-matter  jurisdiction, 
in  rem  jurisdiction  over  the  defendant  property,  and 
venue;

sonable  belief that  the  government will be able to  meet 
its burden of proof at trial. 

(3)  Judicial authorization and process. 

(a)  Real property.--If the defendant is real property, 
the  government  must  proceed  under  18  U. S. C.  $ 985. 

(b)  Other property; arrest warrant.--If the defendant 
is not real property: 

(i)  the  clerk  must  issue  a  warrant  to  arrest  the

tody, or control; 

(ii)  the  court--on  finding  probable  cause--must 
issue a warrant to arrest the property if it is not in 
the government's possession, custody, or control and 
is not subject to a judicial restraining order; and 

(iii)  a warrant  is  not necessary if the  property is 
subject to a judicial restraining order. 

(c)  Execution of process. 

(i)  The  warrant  and  any  supplemental  process 
must  be  delivered  to  a  person  or  organization  au-
thorized  to  execute  it,  who  may  be:  (A)  a  marshal

the warrant and supplemental process are executed,

to  every  person  the  government  can  reasonably 
identify as a potential claimant; or

ceeds  the  property's  value  and  that  other  means  of 
notice would satisfy due process. 

(ii)  Content  of  the  notice.--Unless  the  court  or-
ders otherwise, the notice must:

AMENDMENTS  TO  THE  FEDERAL  RULES 

OF  EVIDENCE 

Rule  404.  Character  evidence  not  admissible  to  prove  con-

duct; exceptions; other crimes. 

(a)  Character evidence generally.--Evidence of a person's 
character  or  a  trait  of  character  is  not  admissible  for  the 
purpose  of proving action  in  conformity  therewith  on  a  par-
ticular occasion, except: 

(1)  Character  of  accused.--In  a  criminal  case,  evi-
dence  of  a pertinent trait  of character  offered by  an  ac-
cused,  or  by  the  prosecution  to  rebut  the  same,  or  if 
evidence  of  a  trait  of  character  of  the  alleged  victim  of 
the  crime  is  offered  by  an  accused  and  admitted  under 
Rule 404(a)(2), evidence of the same trait of character of 
the accused offered by the prosecution; 

(2)  Character  of  alleged  victim.--In  a  criminal  case, 
and subject to the limitations imposed by Rule 412, evi-
dence of a pertinent trait of character of the alleged vic-
tim of the crime offered by an accused, or by the prose-
cution to rebut the same, or evidence of a character trait 
of  peacefulness  of  the  alleged  victim  offered  by  the 
prosecution  in  a  homicide  case  to  rebut  evidence  that 
the alleged victim was the first aggressor;

of a witness, as provided in Rules 607, 608, and 609. . . . . .

1286  RULES  OF  EVIDENCE 
as to validity or amount, or to impeach through a prior incon-
sistent statement or contradiction: 

(1)  furnishing  or offering  or  promising to furnish--or 
accepting or offering or promising to accept--a valuable 
consideration in compromising or attempting to compro-
mise the claim; and 

(2)  conduct or statements made in compromise negoti-
ations  regarding  the  claim,  except  when  offered  in  a 
criminal case  and the  negotiations  related to a  claim by 
a  public  office  or  agency  in  the  exercise  of  regulatory, 
investigative, or enforcement authority. 

(b)  Permitted  uses.--This  rule  does  not  require  exclu-
sion  if  the  evidence  is  offered  for  purposes  not  prohibited 
by  subdivision  (a).  Examples  of  permissible  purposes  in-
clude  proving  a  witness's  bias  or  prejudice;  negating  a  con-
tention  of  undue  delay;  and  proving  an  effort  to  obstruct  a 
criminal investigation or prosecution. 

Rule 606.  Competency of juror as witness. . . . . . 

(b)  Inquiry into validity of verdict or indictment.--Upon 
an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror 
may not testify as to any matter or statement occurring dur-
ing  the  course  of  the  jury's  deliberations  or  to  the  effect  of 
anything upon that or any other juror's mind or emotions as 
influencing the juror to assent to or dissent from the verdict 
or  indictment  or  concerning  the  juror's  mental  processes 
in  connection  therewith.  But  a  juror  may  testify  about 
(1)  whether  extraneous  prejudicial  information  was  improp-
erly brought to the jury's attention, (2) whether any outside 
influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror, or 
(3) whether there was a mistake in entering the verdict onto 
the  verdict  form.  A  juror's  affidavit  or  evidence  of  any 
statement  by  the  juror  may  not  be  received  on  a  matter 
about  which  the  juror  would  be  precluded  from  testifying.

1287 RULES  OF  EVIDENCE 
Rule 609.  Impeachment by evidence of conviction of crime. 

(a)  General rule.--For  the purpose of  attacking the  char-
acter for truthfulness of a witness, 

(1)  evidence that a witness other than an accused has been  convicted  of  a  crime  shall  be  admitted,  subject  to 

Rule  403,  if  the  crime  was  punishable  by  death  or  im-
prisonment  in  excess  of  one  year  under  the  law  under which  the  witness  was  convicted,  and  evidence  that  an 

accused  has  been  convicted  of  such  a  crime  shall  be  ad-mitted  if  the  court  determines  that  the  probative  value 
of  admitting  this  evidence  outweighs  its  prejudicial  ef-fect to the accused; and 

(2)  evidence that any witness has been convicted of a 
crime shall be admitted regardless of the punishment, if 
it  readily  can  be  determined  that  establishing  the  ele-
ments of the crime required proof or admission of an act 
of dishonesty or false statement by the witness. 

(b)  Time  limit.--Evidence  of  a  conviction  under  this  rule 
is  not  admissible  if  a  period  of  more  than  ten  years  has 
elapsed  since  the  date  of  the  conviction  or  of  the  release  of 
the  witness  from  the  confinement  imposed  for  that  convic-
tion, whichever is the later date, unless the court determines, 
in  the  interests  of  justice,  that  the  probative  value  of  the 
conviction supported by specific facts and circumstances sub-
stantially  outweighs  its  prejudicial  effect.  However,  evi-
dence  of  a  conviction  more  than  10  years  old  as  calculated 
herein,  is  not  admissible  unless  the  proponent  gives  to  the 
adverse  party  sufficient  advance  written  notice  of  intent  to 
use  such  evidence  to  provide  the  adverse  party  with  a  fair 
opportunity to contest the use of such evidence. 

(c)  Effect of pardon, annulment, or certificate of rehabili-
tation.--Evidence of a conviction is not admissible under this 
rule  if  (1)  the  conviction  has  been  the  subject  of  a  pardon, 
annulment,  certificate  of  rehabilitation,  or  other  equivalent 
procedure based on a finding of the rehabilitation of the per-
son  convicted,  and  that  person  has  not  been  convicted  of  a

1288  RULES  OF  EVIDENCE 
subsequent crime that was punishable by death or imprison-ment in excess of one year, or (2) the conviction has been the 

subject  of  a  pardon,  annulment,  or  other  equivalent  proce-dure based on a finding of innocence. 

(d)  Juvenile  adjudications.--Evidence  of juvenile  adjudi-cations  is  generally  not  admissible  under  this  rule.  The 
court  may,  however,  in  a  criminal  case  allow  evidence  of  a juvenile  adjudication  of  a  witness  other  than  the  accused  if 
conviction  of  the  offense  would  be  admissible  to  attack  the credibility  of  an  adult  and  the  court  is  satisfied  that  admis-
sion  in  evidence  is  necessary  for  a  fair  determination  of  the issue of guilt or innocence. 

(e)  Pendency of appeal.--The  pendency  of an  appeal therefrom does not render evidence of a conviction inadmissi-
ble.  Evidence  of  the  pendency  of  an  appeal  is  admissible.

to  cross-examine  her,  unless  he  coerced  her  failure  to  testify.  Davis  v. 
Washington, p. 813. 

II.  Due  Process. 

1.  Brady  claim--Suppression  of  favorable  evidence.--Judgment  is  re-
versed and case  is  remanded for  views  of full  Supreme Court of  Appeals 
of West Virginia on petitioner's claim that State's suppression of evidence 
favorable to defense violated his federal constitutional rights under Brady 
v.  Maryland, 373 U. S. 83.  Youngblood v. West Virginia, p. 867. 

2.  Tax  sale--Unclaimed  notice.--When  mailed  notice  of  a  tax  sale  is 
returned  unclaimed,  a  State  must  take  additional  reasonable  steps  to  at-
tempt  to  provide  notice  to  property  owner  before  selling  his  property,  if 
it  is  practicable  to  do  so;  because  additional  steps  were  available  here, 
State's  effort  to  provide  notice  to  petitioner  did  not  satisfy  due  process. 
Jones v. Flowers, p. 220. 

III.  Freedoms  of  Speech  and  Association. 

1.  Federal  funding--Solomon  Amendment--Military  recruiters  on 
college campuses.--Because Congress could require law schools to provide 
equal  access  to  military  recruiters  without  violating  schools'  freedoms  of 
speech  and  association,  Third  Circuit  erred  in  holding  that  Solomon 
Amendment--which  denies  federal  funds  to  educational  institutions  that 
fail to give military recruiters access equal to that provided other recruit-
ers--likely violates First Amendment.  Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic 
and Institutional Rights, Inc., p. 47. 

2.  Public  employees--Statements  pursuant  official  duties.--When 
public  employees  make  statements  pursuant  to  their  official  duties,  they 
are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and Constitu-
tion  does  not  insulate  their  communications  from  employer  discipline. 
Garcetti v. Ceballos, p. 410. 

IV. Right to Fair Trial.  

State  evidence  rule--Proof  of  third-party  guilt.--A  criminal  defend-
ant's federal constitutional rights are violated by an evidence rule prevent-
ing a defendant from introducing  proof of third-party guilt if prosecution 
has  introduced  forensic  evidence  that,  if  believed,  strongly  supports  a 
guilty verdict.  Holmes v. South Carolina, p. 319. 

V.  Searches  and  Seizures. 

1.  Knock-and-announce  violation--Suppression  of  evidence.--Viola-
tion of knock-and-announce rule does not require suppression of evidence 
found in a search.  Hudson v. Michigan, p. 586.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW--Continued. 

2.  Parolees--Suspicionless  searches.--Fourth  Amendment  does  not 
prohibit a police officer from conducting a suspicionless search of a parolee. 
Samson v. California, p. 843. 

3.  Warrantless  entry--Reasonableness.--Police  may  enter  a  home 
without  a  warrant  when  they  have  an  objectively  reasonable  basis  for 
believing  that  an  occupant  is  seriously  injured  or  imminently  threatened 
with injury.  Brigham City v. Stuart, p. 398. 

4.  Warrantless  entry  and  search--Co-occupant's  refusal  to  permit 
entry.--In  circumstances  at  issue,  a  physically  present  co-occupant's 
stated  refusal  to  permit  entry  to  a  home  renders  warrantless  entry  and 
search  unreasonable  under  Fourth  Amendment  and  invalid  as  to  him. 
Georgia v. Randolph, p. 103. 

5.  Warrants--Probable  cause.--"Anticipatory"  search  warrants  based 
on an affidavit showing  probable cause  that at some  future time (but not 
presently)  certain  evidence  of  a  crime  will  be  located  at  a  specified 
place  are  not  categorically  unconstitutional  under  Fourth  Amendment's 
probable-cause  provision;  anticipatory  warrant  at  issue  did  not  violate 
Amendment's particularity requirement, which does not include conditions 
precedent to execution of such a warrant.  United States v. Grubbs, p. 90. 

VI.  States'  Immunity  from  Suit. 

Admiralty--"Arm of the State."--A governmental entity that does not 
qualify as an "arm of the State" for Eleventh Amendment purposes cannot 
assert  sovereign  immunity  as  a  defense  to  an  admiralty  suit.  Northern 
Ins. Co. of N. Y. v. Chatham County, p. 189.

erred  in  treating  petitioner's  prior  conviction  for  simple  possession  of  a 
controlled  substance  as  a  "controlled  substance  offense"  for  purposes  of 
Guidelines.  Salinas v. United States, p. 188. 

2.  Speedy  Trial  Act  of  1974--Waiver--Estoppel--Standard  of  re-
view.--A defendant may not prospectively waive application of Act, which 
generally  requires  criminal  trials  to  start  within  70  days  of  indictment; 
petitioner  is  not  estopped  from  challenging  exclusion  of  a  91-day  delay 
from  70-day  period;  District  Court's  decision  to  exclude  that  delay  is  not 
subject  to  harmless-error  review;  Act  was  violated  because  91-day  delay 
exceeded 70 days permitted by Act.  Zedner v. United States, p. 489.

Physical violence--Relationship to robbery or extortion.--Congress in-
tended  only  to  forbid  acts  or  threats  of  physical  violence  in  furtherance 
of a  plan to engage  in robbery or extortion (and  related attempts or con-
spiracies)  when  it  prohibited  "obstruct[ing],  delay[ing],  or  affect[ing] 
commerce . . . by . . .  robbery or extortion . . . or  commit[ting] or threaten-
[ing] physical violence to any person or property in furtherance of a plan 
or purpose to do anything in violation of this section," 18 U. S. C. $ 1951(a), 
not to create a freestanding physical violence offense unrelated to robbery 
or extortion.  Scheidler v. National Organization for Women, Inc., p. 9.

Asylum  claim--Fear  of  persecution--"Particular  social  group."--In 
this  asylum  claim  based  on  fear  of  persecution,  Ninth  Circuit  erred  in 
finding in first instance, rather than remanding to appropriate administra-
tive agency, question whether family members constitute a "particular so-
cial group" within Act's meaning.  Gonzales v. Thomas, p. 183.

JURISDICTION. 

1.  Bankruptcy  proceeding--Probate  exception.--Ninth  Circuit  had  no 
warrant  from  Congress  or  this  Court  for  its  sweeping  extension  of  "pro-
bate  exception"  to  federal-court  jurisdiction;  because  this  case  does  not 
fall within exception's scope, District Court properly asserted jurisdiction 
over  petitioner's  tort  counterclaim  against  respondent,  despite  ongoing 
proceedings in a Texas Probate Court.  Marshall v. Marshall, p. 293. 

2.  Court of Appeals--Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 
1998--Removal--Remand  to  state  court.--Federal  district-court  orders 
remanding removed securities class actions to state court for want of pre-
clusion under Act are subject to 28 U. S. C. $ 1447(d), which makes remand 
orders  unreviewable  on  appeal.  Kircher  v.  Putnam  Funds  Trust,  p.  633. 

3.  Health-care plan provider's suit--Reimbursement of benefits 
paid.--Title 28 U. S. C. $ 1331--which authorizes federal jurisdiction over 
"civil actions arising under  the . . .  laws . . .  of  the  United  States"--does 
not encompass a federal suit by a health-care plan providing benefits under 
Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 for reimbursement of med-
ical bills plan paid on behalf of a plan beneficiary who, injured in an acci-
dent, recovered damages (unaided by plan administrator) in a state-court 
tort action against a third party alleged to have caused accident.  Empire 
HealthChoice Assurance, Inc. v. McVeigh, p. 677.

Market  power--Tying  arrangements.--Because  a  patent  does  not  nec-
essarily  confer  market  power  upon  patentee,  in  cases  involving  a  tying 
arrangement,  a  plaintiff  must  prove  that  defendant  has  market  power  in 
tying product.  Illinois Tool Works Inc. v. Independent Ink, Inc., p. 28.
