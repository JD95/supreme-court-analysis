absent tolling, Siebert's federal habeas petition would be un-
timely by over four years. 

The  District  Court  dismissed  Siebert's  habeas  petition  as 
untimely,  reasoning  that  an  application  for  state  postconvic-
tion  relief  is  not  "properly  filed"  if  it  was  rejected  by  the 
state  court  on statute-of-limitations  grounds.  The Court  of 
Appeals reversed, however, holding that Siebert's state post-
conviction  petition  was  "properly  filed"  within  the  meaning 
of  $ 2244(d)(2),  because  the  state  time  bar  was  not  jurisdic-
tional  and  the  Alabama  courts  therefore  had  discretion  in 
enforcing  it.  See  Siebert

(b)  The  State  argues  that  any  interpretation  of  the  Act  allowing 
courts to question state valuation methods ignores the background prin-
ciples  of  federalism  against  which  the  statute  was  enacted.  Even  if 
important state policy questions are intertwined with the selection of a 
valuation  methodology,  however,  Congress  clearly  permitted  courts  to 
question such methodologies when it banned discriminatory assessment 
ratios and made true market value a question to be litigated in federal

Opinion of the Court 
States,  the  Act  provides,  may  not  "[a]ssess  rail  transporta-
tion property at a value that has a higher ratio to the [prop-
erty's]  true  market  value . . .  than  the  ratio"  between  the 
assessed  and  true  market  values  of  other  commercial  and 
industrial  property  in  the  same  taxing  jurisdiction.  49 
U. S. C. $ 11501(b)(1).  If the railroad ratio exceeds the ratio 
for other property by at least five percent, the district court 
may enjoin the tax.  $ 11501(c).3 

"(1)  Assess  rail  transportation  property  at  a  value  that  has  a  higher 
ratio to the true market value of the rail transportation property than the 
ratio that the assessed value of other commercial and industrial property 
in  the  same  assessment  jurisdiction  has  to  the  true  market  value  of  the 
other commercial and industrial property. 

"(2)  Levy or collect a tax on an assessment that may not be made under 
paragraph (1) of this subsection. 

"(3)  Levy  or  collect  an  ad  valorem  property  tax  on  rail  transportation 
property at a tax rate that exceeds the tax rate applicable to commercial 
and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction. 

"(4)  Impose another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier provid-
ing  transportation  subject  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Board  under  this 
part." 

3 Section 11501(c) provides: 

"Notwithstanding  section  1341  of  title  28  and  without  regard  to  the 
amount in controversy or citizenship of the parties, a district court of the 
United States has jurisdiction, concurrent with other jurisdiction of courts 
of  the  United  States  and  the  States,  to  prevent  a  violation  of  subsection 
(b)  of  this  section.  Relief  may  be  granted  under  this  subsection  only  if 
the  ratio  of  assessed  value  to  true  market  value  of  rail  transportation 
property exceeds by at least 5 percent the ratio of assessed value to true 
market  value  of  other  commercial  and  industrial  property  in  the  same 
assessment  jurisdiction.  The  burden  of  proof  in  determining  assessed 
value and true market value is governed by State law.  If the ratio of the 
assessed value of other commercial and industrial property in the assess-
ment  jurisdiction  to  the  true  market  value  of  all  other  commercial  and 
industrial property cannot be determined to the satisfaction of the district 
court through the random-sampling method known as a sales  assessment 
ratio study (to be carried out under statistical principles applicable to such 
a study), the court shall find, as a violation of this section-- 

"(1)  an  assessment  of  the  rail  transportation  property  at  a  value  that 
has a higher ratio to the true market value of the rail transportation prop-

Opinion of the Court 
value  of its in-state property while  accurately  valuing other commercial  and  industrial  property  in  the  State.  The  re-

sult, according to CSX, was that its rail property was taxed at  a  ratio  of  assessed-to-market  value  considerably  more 
than  five  percent  greater  than  the  same  ratio  for  the  other property in the State. 

To make its case, CSX submitted the testimony of its own exper

t  appraiser,  who  relied  on  a  combination  of  valuation methods different from those used by the appraiser for Geor-

gia.  The  CSX  appraiser  calculated  the  2002  market  value of the railroad's property to be $6 billion, not the $7.8 billion 
figure  used  by  the  State.  472  F.  3d,  at  1285-1286.  CSX 
maintained  that  the  state  appraiser's  valuation  methodolo-
gies were flawed, and urged the District Court to accept the 
market value estimated by its expert as more accurate. 

The  District  Court  refused  to  do  so.  Following  a  bench 
trial,  the  court  ruled  Georgia  had  not  discriminated  against 
CSX in violation  of the 4-R Act because the State had used 
widely  accepted  valuation  methods  to  arrive  at  its  estimate 
of  true  market  value.  448  F.  Supp.  2d  1330,  1341  (ND  Ga. 
2005).  In the judgment of the District Court, the Act "does 
not generally allow a railroad to challenge the state's chosen 
methodology,"  as  long  as  the  State's  methods  are  rational 
and not motivated by discriminatory intent.  Ibid.

Opinion of the Court 
simply  by  doublechecking  the  State's  assessment  equations. 
Rather,  the  calculation  of  true  market  value  is  an  applied 
science,  even  a  craft.  Most  appraisers  estimate  market 
value by employing not one methodology but a combination. 
These  various  methods  generate  a  range  of  possible  market 
values which the appraiser uses to derive what he considers 
to be an accurate estimate of market value, based on careful 
scrutiny  of  all  the  data  available.  Appraisal  Institute,  The 
Appraisal of Real Estate 49-50 (12th ed. 2001). 

Georgia's  appraiser  in  the  instant  case,  for  example,  used 
three  different  valuation  techniques--the  discounted  cash-
flow  approach,  a  market  multiple  approach,  and  a  stock  and 
debt  approach.  He  derived  five  values  from  these  three 
methods,  ranging  from  $8.126  billion  to  $12.346  billion. 
After  selecting  a  number  at  the  low  end  of  the  range  and 
then subtracting another $400 million to account for intangi-
ble  property  not  subject  to  ad  valorem  taxation,  he  settled 
on $7.8 billion as his final estimate of the true market value. 
472 F. 3d, at 1284-1285. 

Appraisers typically employ a combination of methods be-
cause  no  one  approach  is  entirely  accurate,  at  least  in  the 
absence of an established market for the type of property at 
issue.  The individual methods yield sometimes more, some-
times less reliable results depending on the peculiar features 
of the property evaluated.  As the variation in the state ap-
praiser's  market-value  range  reveals,  different  methods  can 
produce  substantially  different  estimates.  W.  Kinnard,  In-
come  Property  Valuation:  Principles  and  Techniques  of  Ap-
praising Income-Producing Real Estate 52 (1971). 

Given  the  extent  to  which  the  chosen  methods  can  affect 
the determination of value, preventing courts from scrutiniz-
ing  state  valuation  methodologies  would  render  $ 11501  a 
largely  empty  command.  It  would  force  district  courts  to 
accept  as  "true"  the  market  value  estimated  by  the  State, 
one  of  the  parties  to  the  litigation.  States,  in  turn,  would

the power to calculate true market value necessarily includes the power to look behind a State's valuation methods.  That 
the  statute  should vest  this authority  in  the  Nation's courts is  hardly  surprising,  given  Congress's  conclusion  that  the 
States were assessing railroad property unfairly. Our  decision  in

this Court is not equipped to say what statutory alteration, if any, Con-
gress  would  have  made  had  its  attention  trained  on  offenders  who  re-
tained  civil  rights;  nor  can  the  Court  recast  $ 921(a)(20)  in  Congress' 
stead.  Pp. 33-35. 

Section 922(g)(9)--which was adopted ten years after $ 921(a)(20) was 
given  its  current  shape  and  which  outlaws  possession  of  a  firearm  by 
anyone  "convicted . . .  of a  misdemeanor crime of  domestic  violence"-- 
cautions  against  any  assumption  that  Congress  did  not  mean  to  deny 
the  $ 921(a)(20)  exemption  to  offenders  who  retained  their  civil  rights. 
Tailored  to  $ 922(g)(9),  Congress  adopted  a  definitional  provision, 

$ 921(a)(33)(B)(ii), corresponding to $ 921(a)(20), which specifies expunge-
ment,  set-aside,  pardon,  or  restoration  of  rights  as  dispensations  that 
can cancel lingering effects of a conviction.  That provision also demon-
strates  that  the  words  "civil  rights  restored"  do  not  cover  a  person 
whose  civil  rights  were  never taken  away.  It provides for restoration 
of civil rights as a qualifying dispensation only "if the law of the applica-
ble  jurisdiction  provides  for  the  loss  of  civil  rights"  in  the  first  place. 
Section 921(a)(33)(B)(ii) also rebuts Logan's absurdity argument.  Stat-
utory terms may be interpreted against their literal meaning where the 
words could not conceivably have been intended to apply to the case at 
hand.  See,  e.

Opinion of the Court 
We  are  not  equipped  to  say  what  statutory  alteration,  if any,  Congress  would  have  made  had  its  attention  trained 

on  offenders  who  retained  civil  rights;  nor  can  we  recast $ 921(a)(20) in Congress' stead. 

I 
Federal law generally prohibits the possession of a firearm by  a  person  convicted  of  "a  crime  punishable  by  imprison-

ment for a term exceeding one year."  18 U. S. C. $ 922(g)(1). Ordinarily,  the  maximum  felon-in-possession  sentence  is  ten 
years.  See $ 924(a)(2).  If the offender's prior criminal rec-ord includes at least three convictions for "violent felon[ies]" 
or "serious drug offense[s]," however, the maximum sentence increases to life, and ACCA mandates a minimum term of 15 
years.  $ 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V). Congress defined the term "violent felony" to include spec-
ified crimes "punishable by imprisonment for a term exceed-ing  one  year."  $ 924(e)(2)(B)  (2000  ed.).  An  offense  classi-
fied by a State as a misdemeanor, however, may qualify as a "violent  felony"  for  ACCA-enhancement  purposes  (or  as  a 
predicate for  a felon-in-possession  conviction under  $ 922(g)) only  if  the  offense  is  punishable  by  more  than  two  years  in 
prison.  $ 921(a)(20)(B). In Dickerson

ers  who  "ha[ve] been  pardoned  or  ha[ve]  had  civil  rights  re-stored."  $ 921(a)(20).  None  of  Logan's  battery  convictions 

have been expunged, set aside, or pardoned.  See 453 F. 3d, at  809.  Under  Wisconsin  law,  felons  lose  but  can  regain 
their civil rights and can gain the removal of firearms disabil-ities.  See  Wis.  Stat.  $ 6.03(1)(b)  (Supp.  2006);  Wis.  Const., 
Art. XIII, $ 3(2); Wis. Stat. $ 756.02 (2001); $ 973.176(1) (2007). Persons  convicted  of  misdemeanors,  however,  even  if  they 
are  repeat  offenders,  generally  retain  their  civil  rights  and are not subject to firearms disabilities. 

With this background in view, we turn to the proper inter-
pretation of the $ 921(a)(20) exemption from ACCA-enhanced sentencing for offenders who have had their "civil rights re-

stored."  Logan's  misdemeanor  convictions,  we  reiterate, did  not  result  in  any  loss  of  the  rights  to  vote,  hold  public 
office,  or  serve  on  juries.  Should  he  nonetheless  be  ranked with  offenders  whose  rights  were  terminated  but  later  re-
stored?  The  ordinary  meaning  of  the  word  "restored"  af-
fords Logan no aid.  In line with dictionary definitions,3  the Court  of  Appeals  stated:  "The  word  `restore'  means  to  give 

back  something  that  had  been  taken  away."  453  F.  3d, at  805.  Accord

from infirmities of application.  And both approaches reflect a practice 
of  applying  a  heightened  standard  of  review  to  sentences  outside  the 
Guidelines range, which is inconsistent with the rule that the abuse-of-
discretion  standard  applies  to  appellate  review  of  all  sentencing  deci-
sions--whether inside or outside that range.  Pp. 46-49. 

(b)  A district court should begin by correctly calculating the appli-
cable  Guidelines range.  The  Guidelines are the starting  point and  ini-
tial  benchmark  but  are  not  the  only  consideration.  After  permitting 
both parties to argue for a particular sentence, the judge should consider 
all  of  18  U. S. C.  $ 3553(a)'s  factors  to  determine  whether  they  support 
either party's proposal.  He may not presume that the Guidelines range 
is reasonable but must make an individualized assessment based on the 
facts  presented.  If  he  decides  on  an  outside-the-Guidelines  sentence, 
he must consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justifi-
cation is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of variation.  He 
must  adequately  explain  the  chosen  sentence  to  allow  for  meaningful 
appellate  review  and  to  promote the  perception  of  fair  sentencing.  In 
reviewing  the  sentence,  the  appellate  court  must  first  ensure  that  the 
district  court  made  no  significant  procedural  errors  and  then  consider 
the  sentence's  substantive  reasonableness  under  an  abuse-of-discretion 
standard, taking into account the totality of the circumstances, including 
the  extent  of  a  variance  from  the  Guidelines  range,  but  must  give  due 
deference to the district court's decision that the $ 3553(a) factors justify 
the variance.  That the appellate court might have reasonably reached 
a different conclusion does not justify reversal.  Pp. 49-53. 

2.  On abuse-of-discretion review, the Eighth Circuit failed to give due 
deference  to  the  District  Court's  reasoned  and  reasonable  sentencing 
decision.  Since the District Court committed  no procedural  error,  the 
only question for the Circuit was whether the sentence was reasonable, 
i. e.,  whether  the  District  Judge  abused  his  discretion  in  determining 
that the $ 3553(a) factors supported the sentence and justified a substan-
tial deviation from the Guidelines range.  The Circuit gave virtually no 
deference to the District Court's decision that the variance was justified. 
The  Circuit  clearly  disagreed  with  the  District  Court's  decision,  but  it 
was not for the Circuit to decide de novo whether the justification for a 
variance is sufficient or the sentence reasonable.  Pp. 53-60.

tence that constitutes a substantial variance from the Guide-lines be justified by  extraordinary circumstances.  See 

Claiborne  v.  United  States,  549  U. S.  1016  (2006).  We  did not have the opportunity to answer this question because the 
case was mooted  by Claiborne's untimely death.  Claiborne v.  United  States,  551  U. S.  87  (2007)  (per  curiam).  We 
granted  certiorari  in  the  case  before  us  today  in  order  to reach  that  question,  left  unanswered  last  Term.  551  U. S. 
1113  (2007).  We  now  hold  that,  while  the  extent  of  the  dif-ference between a particular sentence and the recommended 
Guidelines  range  is  surely  relevant,  courts  of  appeals  must review  all  sentences--whether  inside,  just  outside,  or  sig-
nificantly  outside  the  Guidelines  range--under  a  deferential abuse-of-discretion  standard.  We  also  hold  that  the  sen-
tence imposed by the experienced District Judge in this case was reasonable. 

I 
In  February  or  March  2000,  petitioner  Brian  Gall,  a second-year  college  student  at  the  University  of  Iowa,  was 

invited by Luke  Rinderknecht to join an  ongoing  enterprise distributing  a  controlled  substance  popularly  known  as  "ec-
stasy." 1  Gall--who was then a user of ecstasy, cocaine, and marijuana--accepted  the  invitation.  During  the  ensuing 
seven months, Gall delivered ecstasy pills, which he received 
from  Rinderknecht,  to  other  conspirators,  who  then  sold them to consumers.  He netted over $30,000. 

A  month  or two after  joining  the  conspiracy, Gall stopped using ecstasy.  A few months after that, in September 2000, 
he  advised  Rinderknecht  and  other  co-conspirators  that  he was withdrawing from the conspiracy.  He has not sold ille-
gal  drugs  of  any  kind  since.  He  has,  in  the  words  of  the District  Court,  "self-rehabilitated."  App.  75.  He  gradua-
ted  from  the  University  of  Iowa  in  2002,  and  moved  first  to

"methylenedioxymethamphetamine."  App. 24, 118.

42  GALL  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
Arizona,  where  he  obtained  a  job  in  the  construction  indus-try,  and  later  to  Colorado,  where  he  earned  $18  per  hour  as 

a master carpenter.  He has not used any illegal drugs since graduating from college. 

After  Gall  moved  to  Arizona,  he  was  approached  by  fed-eral  law  enforcement  agents  who  questioned  him  about  his 
involvement in the ecstasy distribution conspiracy.  Gall ad-
mitted his limited participation in the distribution of ecstasy, and the agents took no further action at that time.  On April 

28, 2004--approximately 11/2  years after this initial interview, and  3

1/2  years  after  Gall  withdrew  from  the  conspiracy--an 

indictment  was  returned  in  the  Southern  District  of  Iowa 
charging him and seven other defendants with participating 
in a conspiracy to distribute ecstasy, cocaine, and marijuana, 
that began in or about May 1996 and continued through Octo-
ber  30,  2002.  The  Government  has  never  questioned  the 
truthfulness of any of Gall's earlier statements or contended 
that  he  played  any  role  in,  or  had  any  knowledge  of,  other 
aspects  of  the  conspiracy  described  in  the  indictment. 
When he received notice of the indictment, Gall moved back 
to  Iowa  and  surrendered  to  the  authorities.  While  free  on 
his  own  recognizance,  Gall  started  his  own  business  in  the 
construction  industry,  primarily  engaged  in  subcontracting 
for the  installation of windows and doors.  In his first  year, 
his profits were over $2,000 per month. 

Gall  entered  into  a  plea  agreement  with  the  Government, 
stipulating that he was "responsible for, but did not necessar-
ily distribute himself, at least 2,500 grams of [ecstasy], or the 
equivalent  of  at  least  87.5  kilograms  of  marijuana."  Id., 
at  25.  In  the  agreement,  the  Government  acknowledged 
that  "on  or  about  September  of  2000,"  Gall  had  communi-
cated his intent to stop distributing ecstasy to Rinderknecht 
and  other  members  of  the  conspiracy.  Ibid.  The  agree-
ment further provided that recent changes in the Guidelines 
that enhanced the recommended punishment for distributing 
ecstasy  were  not  applicable  to  Gall  because  he  had  with-

Opinion of the Court 
drawn  from  the  conspiracy  prior  to  the  effective  date  of those changes. 

In her presentence report, the probation officer concluded that Gall had no significant criminal history; that he was not 
an organizer, leader, or manager; and that his offense did not involve the use of any weapons.  The report stated that Gall 
had  truthfully  provided the  Government  with  all  of  the  evi-dence  he  had  concerning  the  alleged  offenses,  but  that  his 
evidence  was  not  useful  because  he  provided  no  new  infor-mation to the agents.  The report also described Gall's sub-
stantial  use  of  drugs  prior  to  his  offense  and  the  absence  of any  such  use  in  recent  years.  The  report  recommended  a 
sentencing range of 30 to 37 months of imprisonment. The record of the sentencing hearing held on May 27, 2005, 
includes  a  "small  flood"  of  letters  from  Gall's  parents  and other  relatives,  his  fiance,  neighbors,  and  representatives  of 
firms doing business with him, uniformly praising his charac-ter  and  work  ethic.  The  transcript  includes  the  testimony 
of  several  witnesses  and  the  District  Judge's  colloquy  with the  assistant  United States attorney (AUSA) and with  Gall. 
The  AUSA  did  not  contest  any  of  the  evidence  concerning Gall's  law-abiding  life  during  the  preceding  five  years,  but 
urged  that  "the  guidelines  are  appropriate  and  should  be followed,"  and  requested  that  the  court  impose  a  prison 
sentence within the  Guidelines  range.  Id.,  at 93.  He  men-tioned that  two of Gall's  co-conspirators had been  sentenced 
to 30 and 35 months, respectively, but upon further question-ing  by  the  District  Court,  he  acknowledged  that  neither  of 
them had voluntarily withdrawn from the conspiracy. The District Judge sentenced Gall to probation for a term 
of 36 months.  In addition to making a lengthy statement on the  record,  the  judge  filed  a  detailed  sentencing  memoran-
dum  explaining  his  decision,  and  provided  the  following statement of reasons in his written judgment: 

"The  Court  determined  that,  considering  all  the  fac-tors  under  18  U. S. C.  3553(a),  the  Defendant's  explicit

44  GALL  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
withdrawal from the conspiracy almost four years before the filing of the Indictment, the Defendant's post-offense 

conduct,  especially  obtaining  a  college  degree  and  the start of his own successful business, the support of fam-
ily  and  friends,  lack  of  criminal  history,  and  his  age  at the time of the offense conduct, all warrant the sentence 
imposed, which was sufficient, but not greater than nec-essary to serve the purposes of sentencing." 

Id., at 117. 

At  the  end  of  both  the  sentencing  hearing  and  the  sen-tencing memorandum, the District Judge reminded Gall that 

probation,  rather  than  "an  act  of  leniency,"  is  a  "substantial restriction  of  freedom." 

Id.,  at  99,  125.  In  the  memoran-dum, he emphasized: 

"[Gall]  will  have  to  comply  with  strict  reporting  condi-tions along with a three-year regime of alcohol and drug 
testing.  He  will  not  be  able  to  change  or  make  deci-sions  about  significant  circumstances  in  his  life,  such  as 
where to live or work, which are prized liberty interests, without  first  seeking  authorization  from  his  Probation 
Officer or, perhaps, even the Court.  Of course, the De-fendant always faces the harsh consequences that await 
if  he  violates  the  conditions  of  his  probationary  term." 
Id., at 125. 

Finally,  the  District  Judge  explained  why  he  had  con-cluded  that  the  sentence  of  probation  reflected  the  serious-

ness of Gall's  offense and that no  term of imprisonment  was necessary: 

"Any  term  of  imprisonment  in  this  case  would  be counter  effective  by  depriving  society  of  the  contribu-
tions of the Defendant who, the Court has found, under-stands  the  consequences  of  his  criminal  conduct  and  is 
doing everything in his power  to forge a new life.  The Defendant's  post-offense  conduct  indicates  neither  that 
he will return to criminal behavior nor that the Defend-ant  is  a  danger  to  society.  In  fact,  the  Defendant's

45 Cite as: 552 U. S. 38 (2007) 
Opinion of the Court 
post-offense  conduct  was  not  motivated  by  a  desire  to please the Court or any other governmental agency, but 

was  the  pre-Indictment  product  of  the  Defendant's  own desire to lead a better life."  Id., at 125-126. 

II 
The  Court  of  Appeals  reversed  and  remanded  for  resen-tencing.  Relying  on  its  earlier  opinion  in  United  States  v. 

Claiborne,  439  F.  3d  479  (CA8  2006),  it  held  that  a  sentence outside of the Guidelines range must be supported by a justi-
fication that " ` "is proportional to the extent of the difference between  the  advisory  range  and  the  sentence  imposed." ' " 
446  F.  3d 884, 889  (CA8 2006)  (quoting  Claiborne, 439  F. 3d, at  481,  in  turn  quoting 

United  States  v.  Johnson,  427  F.  3d 423,  426-427  (CA7  2005)).  Characterizing  the  difference 

between  a  sentence  of  probation  and  the  bottom  of  Gall's advisory  Guidelines  range  of  30  months  as  "extraordinary" 
because  it  amounted  to  "a  100%  downward  variance,"  446 F. 3d, at 889, the Court of Appeals held that such a variance 
must  be--and  here  was  not--supported  by  extraordinary circumstances. 

Rather  than  making  an  attempt  to  quantify  the  value  of the  justifications  provided  by  the  District  Judge,  the  Court 
of Appeals identified what it regarded as five separate errors in  the  District  Judge's  reasoning:  (1)  He  gave  "too  much 
weight  to  Gall's  withdrawal  from  the  conspiracy";  (2)  given that Gall was 21 at the time of his offense, the District Judge 
erroneously gave "significant weight" to studies showing im-petuous  behavior  by  persons  under  the  age  of  18;  (3)  he  did 
not "properly weigh" the seriousness of Gall's offense; (4) he failed to consider whether a sentence of probation would re-
sult  in  "unwarranted"  disparities;  and  (5)  he  placed  "too much emphasis on Gall's post-offense rehabilitation."  Id., at 
889-890.  As  we  shall  explain,  we  are  not  persuaded  that these  factors,  whether  viewed  separately  or  in  the  aggre-
gate, are sufficient to support the conclusion that the District

Opinion of the Court 
Judge abused his discretion.  As a preface to our discussion of these particulars, however, we shall explain why the Court 

of  Appeals'  rule  requiring  "proportional"  justifications  for departures  from  the  Guidelines  range  is  not  consistent  with 
our  remedial  opinion  in  United  States  v.  Booker,  543  U. S. 220 (2005). 

III 
In Booker we  invalidated  both  the  statutory provision, 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), which made the Sen-

tencing  Guidelines  mandatory,  and  $ 3742(e)  (2000  ed.  and Supp. IV), which directed appellate courts to apply a 

de novo standard of review to departures from the Guidelines.  As a 

result  of  our  decision,  the  Guidelines  are  now  advisory,  and appellate  review  of  sentencing  decisions  is  limited  to  deter-
mining  whether  they  are  "reasonable."  Our  explanation  of "reasonableness" review in the 

Booker opinion made it pellu-cidly  clear  that  the  familiar  abuse-of-discretion  standard  of 

review  now  applies  to  appellate  review  of  sentencing  deci-sions.  See 543 U. S., at 260-262; see also

In reviewing the  reasonableness of a sentence outside  the Guidelines  range,  appellate  courts  may  therefore  take  the 

degree of variance into  account  and consider the  extent of a deviation  from  the  Guidelines.  We  reject,  however,  an  ap-
pellate  rule  that  requires  "extraordinary"  circumstances  to justify a sentence outside the Guidelines range.  We also re-
ject  the  use  of  a  rigid  mathematical  formula  that  uses  the percentage  of  a  departure  as  the  standard  for  determining 
the  strength  of  the  justifications  required  for  a  specific sentence. 

As  an  initial  matter,  the  approaches  we  reject  come  too close to creating an impermissible presumption of unreason-
ableness  for  sentences  outside  the  Guidelines  range.  See 
id.,  at  354-355  ("The  fact  that  we  permit  courts  of  appeals to adopt a presumption of reasonableness does not mean that 

courts  may  adopt  a  presumption  of  unreasonableness").3 Even  the  Government  has  acknowledged  that  such  a  pre-
sumption  would  not  be  consistent  with  Booker.  See  Brief for  United  States  in 

Rita  v.  United  States,  O.  T.  2006, No. 06-5754, pp. 34-35. 

The mathematical approach also suffers from infirmities of application.  On  one  side  of  the  equation,  deviations  from 

Guidelines range  in  a  particular drug  case, is  addressed in  Kimbrough v. 
United States, post, p. 85. 

3 Several  Courts  of  Appeals had rejected such  a  presumption of  unrea-

sonableness  even  prior  to  our  decision  in  Rita.  See,  e. g.,  United  States 
v.  Howard,  454  F.  3d  700,  703  (CA7  2006)  ("Although  a  sentence  outside 
the  range  does  not  enjoy  the  presumption  of  reasonableness  that  one 
within the range does, it does not warrant a presumption of unreasonable-
ness");  United  States  v.  Matheny,  450  F.  3d  633,  642  (CA6  2006)  ("[T]his 
court's holding that sentences within the advisory guideline range are pre-
sumptively reasonable does not mean that sentences outside of that range 
are presumptively  unreasonable"); United States  v.  Myers, 439  F. 3d  415, 
417 (CA8 2006) ("We have determined that a sentence imposed within the 
guidelines  range  is  presumptively  reasonable.  While  it  does  not  follow 
that a sentence outside the guidelines range is unreasonable, we review a 
district  court's  decision  to  depart  from  the  appropriate  guidelines  range 
for abuse of discretion" (citation omitted)).

Opinion of the Court 
the  Guidelines  range  will  always  appear  more  extreme--in percentage  terms--when  the  range  itself  is  low,  and  a  sen-

tence  of  probation  will  always  be  a  100%  departure  regard-less of whether the Guidelines range is 1 month or 100 years. 
Moreover,  quantifying  the  variance  as  a  certain  percentage of  the  maximum,  minimum,  or  median  prison  sentence  rec-
ommended  by  the  Guidelines  gives  no  weight  to  the  "sub-stantial  restriction  of  freedom"  involved  in  a  term  of super-
vised release or probation.  App. 95. We  recognize  that  custodial  sentences  are  qualitatively 
more  severe  than  probationary  sentences  of  equivalent terms.  Offenders  on  probation  are  nonetheless  subject  to 
several  standard  conditions  that  substantially  restrict  their liberty.  See 

United  States  v.  Knights,  534  U. S.  112,  119 (2001) ("Inherent in the very nature of probation is that pro-

bationers  `do  not  enjoy  the  absolute  liberty  to  which  every citizen  is  entitled' "  (quoting 

Griffin  v.  Wisconsin,  483  U. S. 868, 874 (1987); internal quotation marks omitted)).

tioners  may  not  leave  the  judicial  district,  move,  or  change jobs  without  notifying,  and  in  some  cases  receiving  permis-

nounced  visits  to  their  homes,  refrain  from  associating  with any  person  convicted  of  a  felony,  and  refrain  from  excessive

probation officer.  App. 109. On  the  other  side  of  the  equation,  the  mathematical  ap-
proach  assumes  the  existence  of  some  ascertainable  method of  assigning  percentages  to  various  justifications.  Does 
withdrawal  from a  conspiracy justify more or  less than, say, a  30%  reduction?  Does  it  matter  that  the  withdrawal  oc-
curred  several  years  ago?  Is  it  relevant  that  the  with-drawal was motivated by a decision to discontinue the use of 
drugs  and  to  lead  a  better  life?  What  percentage,  if  any, should  be  assigned  to  evidence  that  a  defendant  poses  no 
future  threat  to  society,  or  to  evidence  that  innocent  third parties are  dependent on  him?  The formula  is a  classic ex-
ample  of  attempting  to  measure  an  inventory  of  apples  by counting oranges.

Most  importantly,  both  the  exceptional  circumstances  re-quirement  and  the  rigid  mathematical  formulation  reflect  a 

practice--common among courts that have adopted "propor-tional review"--of applying a heightened standard of review 
to sentences outside the Guidelines range.  This is inconsist-ent  with  the  rule  that  the  abuse-of-discretion  standard  of 
review  applies  to  appellate  review  of  all  sentencing  deci-sions--whether inside or outside the Guidelines range. 

As  we  explained  in  Rita,  a  district  court  should  begin  all sentencing  proceedings  by  correctly  calculating  the  applica-
ble Guidelines range.  See 551 U. S., at 347-348.  As a mat-ter  of  administration  and  to  secure  nationwide  consistency, 
the  Guidelines  should  be  the  starting  point  and  the  initial benchmark.  The  Guidelines  are  not  the  only  consideration, 
however.  Accordingly, after giving both parties an opportu-nity to argue for  whatever  sentence they  deem appropriate, 
the  district  judge  should  then  consider  all  of  the  $ 3553(a) 

5 Notably,  when  the  Court  of  Appeals  explained  its  disagreement  with 
the  District  Judge's  decision  in  this  case,  it  made  no  attempt  to  quantify 
the strength of any of the mitigating circumstances.

factors  to  determine  whether  they  support  the  sentence  re-quested  by  a party.

6  In  so  doing,  he  may  not  presume  that 

the  Guidelines  range  is  reasonable.  See  id.,  at  351.  He must  make  an  individualized  assessment  based  on  the  facts 

presented.  If  he  decides  that  an  outside-Guidelines  sen-
tence is warranted, he must consider the extent of the devia-tion  and  ensure  that  the  justification  is  sufficiently  compel-

ling  to  support  the  degree  of  the  variance.  We  find  it uncontroversial that  a major  departure should be supported 
by  a  more  significant  justification  than  a  minor  one.  After settling on the appropriate sentence, he must adequately ex-
plain  the  chosen  sentence  to  allow  for  meaningful  appellate review  and  to  promote  the  perception  of  fair  sentencing. 
Id., at 356-358. 

6 Section  3553(a)  lists  seven  factors  that  a  sentencing  court  must  con-
sider.  The  first  factor  is  a  broad  command  to  consider  "the  nature  and 
circumstances  of  the  offense  and  the  history  and  characteristics  of  the 
defendant."  18 U. S. C. $ 3553(a)(1).  The second factor requires the con-
sideration of the general purposes of sentencing, including: 

"the need for the sentence imposed-- 
"(A)  to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the 
law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; 

"(B)  to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; 
"(C)  to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and 
"(D)  to  provide  the  defendant  with  needed  educational  or  vocational 
training,  medical  care,  or  other  correctional  treatment  in  the  most  effec-
tive manner."  $ 3553(a)(2). 

The  third  factor  pertains  to  "the  kinds  of  sentences  available, " 

$ 3553(a)(3); the fourth to the Sentencing Guidelines; the fifth to any rele-
vant policy statement issued  by the Sentencing Commission;  the sixth  to 
"the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities," $ 3553(a)(6); and the 
seventh  to  "the  need  to  provide  restitution  to  any  victim,"  $ 3553(a)(7). 
Preceding this list  is a  general directive to "impose a sentence sufficient, 
but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes" of sentencing 
described  in  the  second  factor.  $ 3553(a)  (2000  ed.,  Supp.  V).  The  fact 
that  $ 3553(a)  explicitly  directs  sentencing  courts  to  consider  the  Guide-
lines  supports  the  premise  that  district  courts  must  begin  their  analysis 
with the Guidelines and remain cognizant of them throughout the sentenc-
ing process.

Opinion of the Court 
Regardless  of  whether  the  sentence  imposed  is  inside  or outside  the  Guidelines  range,  the  appellate  court  must  re-

view the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard.  It must  first  ensure  that  the  district  court  committed  no  sig-
nificant  procedural  error,  such  as  failing  to  calculate  (or  im-properly  calculating)  the  Guidelines  range,  treating  the 
Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the $ 3553(a) fac-
tors,  selecting  a  sentence  based  on  clearly  erroneous  facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence--includ-

ing  an  explanation  for  any  deviation  from  the  Guidelines range.  Assuming  that  the  district  court's  sentencing  deci-
sion  is  procedurally  sound,  the  appellate  court  should  then 
consider  the  substantive  reasonableness  of  the  sentence  im-
posed  under  an  abuse-of-discretion  standard.  When  con-
ducting  this  review,  the  court  will,  of  course,  take  into  ac-
count the  totality of the  circumstances,  including  the extent 
of  any  variance  from  the  Guidelines  range.  If  the  sentence 
is  within  the  Guidelines  range,  the  appellate  court  may,  but 
is  not  required  to,  apply  a  presumption  of  reasonableness. 
Id.,  at  347.  But  if  the  sentence  is  outside  the  Guidelines 
range,  the  court  may  not  apply  a  presumption  of  unreason-
ableness.  It  may  consider  the  extent  of  the  deviation,  but 
must  give  due  deference  to the  district  court's  decision  that 
the  $ 3553(a)  factors,  on  a  whole,  justify  the  extent  of  the 
variance.  The  fact  that  the  appellate  court  might  reason-
ably  have  concluded  that  a  different  sentence  was  appro-
priate  is  insufficient  to  justify  reversal  of  the  district  court. 

Practical  considerations  also  underlie  this  legal  principle. 
"The  sentencing  judge  is  in  a  superior  position  to  find  facts 
and judge their import under $ 3553(a) in the individual case. 
The judge sees and hears the evidence, makes credibility de-
terminations,  has  full  knowledge  of  the  facts  and  gains  in-
sights not conveyed by the record."  Brief for Federal Pub-
lic  and  Community  Defenders  et  al.  as  Amici  Curiae  16.

States, 518 U. S. 81, 98 (1996).7 

"It  has  been  uniform  and  constant  in  the  federal  judicial

study  in  the  human  failings  that  sometimes  mitigate,  some-
times magnify, the crime and the punishment to ensue."  Id., 
at  113.8  The  uniqueness  of  the  individual  case,  however, 
does not change the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard 
of  review  that  applies  to  all  sentencing  decisions.  As  we

case  does  not  reflect  the  requisite  deference  and  does  not

v.  Likens, 464 F. 3d 823, 827, n. 1 (CA8 2006) (Bright, J., dissenting).  Only 
a  relatively  small  fraction  of  these  defendants  appeal  their  sentence  on 
reasonableness grounds.  See Koon,  518 U. S.,  at 98  ("In  1994, for exam-
ple,  93.9%  of  Guidelines  cases  were  not  appealed");  Likens,  464  F.  3d,  at 
827,  n.  1  (Bright,  J.,  dissenting)  (noting  that  the  District  Judge  had  sen-

cule  number  of  those  cases");  cf.  United  States  Sentencing  Commission, 
2006 Sourcebook of Federal Sentencing Statistics 135-152. 

8 It  is  particularly  revealing  that  when  we  adopted  an  abuse-of-

discretion standard  in  Koon,  we explicitly  rejected the  Government's  ar-
gument  that "de novo review of departure decisions is  necessary  `to pro-
tect against unwarranted disparities arising from the differing sentencing 
approaches of individual district judges.' "  518 U. S., at 97 (quoting Brief 
for  United  States,  O.  T.  1995,  No.  94-1664,  p.  12).  Even  then  we  were 
satisfied  that  a  more  deferential  abuse-of-discretion  standard  could  suc-
cessfully  balance  the  need  to  "reduce  unjustified  disparities"  across  the 
Nation  and  "consider  every  convicted  person  as  an  individual."  518

support  the  conclusion  that  the  District  Court  abused  its discretion. 

IV 
As an initial matter, we note that the District Judge com-mitted  no  significant  procedural  error.  He  correctly  calcu-

lated the applicable Guidelines range, allowed both parties to 
present arguments as to what they believed the appropriate sentence  should  be,  considered  all  of  the  $ 3553(a)  factors, 

and  thoroughly  documented  his  reasoning.  The  Court  of Appeals found that the District Judge erred in failing to give 
proper  weight  to  the  seriousness  of  the  offense,  as  required 
by $ 3553(a)(2)(A), and failing to consider whether a sentence of  probation  would  create  unwarranted  disparities,  as  re-

quired by $ 3553(a)(6).  We disagree. Section 3553(a)(2)(A) requires judges to consider "the need 
for the sentence imposed . . . to  reflect the seriousness of the offense,  to  promote  respect  for  the  law,  and  to  provide  just 
punishment  for  the  offense."  The  Court  of  Appeals  con-cluded  that  "the  district  court  did  not  properly  weigh  the 
seriousness of Gall's offense" because it "ignored the serious health risks ecstasy poses."  446 F. 3d, at 890.  Contrary to 
the  Court  of  Appeals'  conclusion,  the  District  Judge  plainly 
did  consider  the  seriousness  of  the  offense.  See,  e. g.,  App. 99 ("The Court, however, is bound to impose a sentence that 

reflects  the  seriousness  of  joining  a  conspiracy  to  distribute MDMA or Ecstasy"); 

id., at 122.9  It is true that the District 

9 The  District  Judge  also  gave  specific  consideration  to  the  fact--not 
directly  taken  into  account  by  the  Guidelines--that  Gall  netted  $30,000 
from his participation in the conspiracy.  He noted, however: 

"[T]his fact can be viewed from different perspectives.  On the one hand, 
[Gall] should be punished for profiting from a criminal scheme. . . . On the 
other hand, [Gall], who is from a working-class family and has few financial 
resources, decided to turn his back on what, for him, was a highly profit-
able venture. . . . The Court can not consider, for the purposes of sentenc-
ing, one side of the financial aspect of the offense conduct without consider-
ing the other."  App. 123-124, n. 3.

54  GALL  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
Judge did not make specific reference to the (unquestionably significant) health risks posed by ecstasy, but the prosecutor 

did  not  raise  ecstasy's  effects  at  the  sentencing  hearing. Had the prosecutor raised the issue, specific discussion of the 
point might have been in order, but it was not incumbent on the  District  Judge  to  raise  every  conceivably  relevant  issue 
on his own initiative. The  Government's  legitimate  concern  that  a  lenient  sen-
tence  for  a  serious  offense  threatens  to  promote  disrespect 
for  the  law  is  at  least  to  some  extent  offset  by  the  fact  that seven  of  the  eight  defendants  in  this  case  have  been  sen-

tenced  to  significant  prison  terms.  Moreover,  the  unique 
facts  of  Gall's  situation  provide  support  for  the  District 
Judge's conclusion that, in Gall's  case, "a sentence of impris-
onment  may  work  to  promote  not  respect,  but  derision,  of 
the  law  if  the  law  is  viewed  as  merely  a  means  to  dispense 
harsh  punishment  without  taking  into  account  the  real  con-
duct and circumstances involved in sentencing."  Id., at 126. 

Section  3553(a)(6)  requires  judges  to  consider  "the  need 
to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants 
with  similar  records  who  have  been  found  guilty  of  similar 
conduct."  The  Court  of  Appeals  stated  that  "the  record 
does  not  show  that  the  district  court  considered  whether  a 
sentence  of  probation  would  result  in  unwarranted  dispari-
ties."  446  F.  3d,  at  890.  As  with  the  seriousness  of  the 
offense  conduct,  avoidance  of  unwarranted  disparities  was 
clearly  considered by  the  Sentencing Commission  when  set-
ting  the  Guidelines  ranges.  Since  the  District  Judge  cor-
rectly  calculated  and  carefully  reviewed  the  Guidelines 
range,  he  necessarily  gave  significant  weight  and  consider-
ation to the need to avoid unwarranted disparities. 

Moreover, as we understand the colloquy between the Dis-
trict Judge and the AUSA, it seems that the judge gave spe-
cific  attention  to  the  issue  of  disparity  when  he  inquired 
about the sentences already imposed by a different judge on 
two of Gall's codefendants.  The AUSA advised the District

Opinion of the Court 
Judge that defendant Harbison had received a 30-month sen-tence and that Gooding had received 35 months.  The follow-

ing colloquy then occurred: 

"THE  COURT:  .  .  .  You  probably  know  more  about 
this  than anybody.  How  long did  those two stay in  the conspiracy, and did they voluntarily withdraw? 

"MR. GRIESS: They did not. "THE COURT: They did not? 
"MR.  GRIESS:  They  did  not  voluntarily  withdraw. And  they  were  in  the  conspiracy,  I  think,  for  a  shorter 
period of time, but at the very end. 

"THE COURT: Okay.  Thank you. "MR.  GRIESS:  A  significant  difference  there,  Your 

Honor,  is  that  they  were  in  the  conspiracy  after  the guidelines  changed  and,  therefore,  were  sentenced  at  a 
much higher level because of that."  App. 88. 
A  little  later  Mr.  Griess  stated:  "The  last  thing  I  want  to 
talk about goes to sentencing disparity . . . .   Obviously, the Court  is  cognizant  of  that  and  wants  to  avoid  any  unwar-

ranted  sentencing  disparities."  Id.,  at  89.  He  then  dis-cussed at some length the sentence of 36 months imposed on 
another codefendant, Jarod Yoder, whose participation in the conspiracy was roughly comparable to Gall's.  Griess volun-
tarily  acknowledged  three  differences  between  Yoder  and Gall:  Yoder  was  in  the  conspiracy  at  its  end  and  therefore 
was  sentenced  under  the  more  severe  Guidelines,  he  had  a more serious criminal history, and he did not withdraw from 
the conspiracy. From  these  facts,  it  is  perfectly  clear  that  the  District 
Judge considered the need to avoid unwarranted disparities, 
but also considered the need to avoid unwarranted similari-
ties among other co-conspirators who were not similarly situ-
ated.  The  District  Judge  regarded  Gall's  voluntary  with-
drawal  as  a  reasonable  basis  for  giving  him  a  less  severe 
sentence  than  the  three  codefendants  discussed  with  the

56  GALL  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
AUSA, who neither withdrew from the conspiracy nor reha-bilitated  themselves  as  Gall  had  done.  We  also  note  that 

neither the Court of Appeals nor the Government has called our attention to a comparable defendant who received a more 
severe sentence. Since  the  District  Court  committed  no  procedural  error, 
the  only question for the  Court of Appeals was whether the sentence  was  reasonable--

i. e.,  whether  the  District  Judge abused  his  discretion  in  determining  that  the  $ 3553(a)  fac-

tors  supported  a  sentence  of  probation  and  justified  a  sub-stantial  deviation  from  the  Guidelines  range.  As  we  shall 
now  explain,  the  sentence  was  reasonable.  The  Court  of Appeals' decision to the contrary was incorrect and failed to 
demonstrate  the  requisite  deference  to  the  District  Judge's decision. 

V 
The  Court  of  Appeals  gave  virtually  no  deference  to  the District  Court's  decision  that  the  $ 3553(a)  factors  justified 

a  significant  variance  in  this  case.  Although  the  Court  of Appeals  correctly  stated  that  the  appropriate  standard  of 
review was abuse of discretion, it engaged in an analysis that more closely resembled de novo review of the facts presented 
and determined that, in its view, the degree of variance was not warranted. 

The  Court  of  Appeals  thought  that  the  District  Court "gave too much weight to Gall's withdrawal from the conspir-
acy  because  the  court  failed  to  acknowledge  the  significant benefit  Gall  received  from  being  subject  to  the  1999  Guide-
lines." 10  446  F.  3d,  at  889.  This  criticism  is  flawed  in  that it  ignores  the  critical  relevance  of  Gall's  voluntary  with-

drawal,  a  circumstance  that  distinguished  his  conduct  not only from that of all his codefendants, but from the vast ma-

10 The  Court  of  Appeals  explained  that  under  the  current  Guidelines, 
which  treat  ecstasy  more  harshly,  Gall's  base  offense  level  would  have

Opinion of the Court 
jority of defendants convicted of conspiracy in federal court. The  District  Court  quite  reasonably  attached  great  weight 

to  the  fact  that  Gall  voluntarily  withdrew  from  the  conspir-acy  after  deciding,  on  his  own  initiative,  to  change  his  life. 
This  lends  strong  support  to  the  District  Court's  conclusion that  Gall  is  not  going  to  return  to  criminal  behavior  and  is 
not a danger to society.  See 18 U. S. C. $$ 3553(a)(2)(B), (C). 
Compared  to  a  case  where  the  offender's  rehabilitation  oc-curred after he was charged with a crime, the District Court 

here had greater justification for believing Gall's turnaround was genuine, as distinct from a transparent attempt to build 
a mitigation case. 

The  Court  of  Appeals  thought  the  District  Judge  "gave 
significant weight to an improper factor" when he compared 
Gall's sale of ecstasy when he was a 21-year-old adult to the 
"impetuous  and  ill-considered"  actions  of  persons  under  the 
age of  18.  446  F.  3d, at  890.  The  appellate  court correctly 
observed that the  studies cited by the  District Judge do not 
explain how Gall's "specific behavior in the  instant case was 
impetuous or ill-considered."  Ibid. 

In  that  portion  of  his  sentencing  memorandum,  however, 
the  judge  was  discussing  the  "character  of  the  defendant," 
not  the  nature  of  his  offense.  App.  122.  He  noted  that 
Gall's  criminal  history  included  a  ticket  for  underage  drink-
ing  when  he  was  18  years  old  and  possession  of  marijuana 
that was  contemporaneous  with  his offense  in  this  case.  In 
summary, the District Judge observed that all of Gall's crimi-
nal history, "including the present offense, occurred when he 
was  twenty-one-years  old  or  younger"  and  appeared  "to 
stem from  his addictions  to drugs and alcohol."  Id., at 122, 
123.  The District Judge appended a long footnote to his dis-
cussion  of  Gall's  immaturity.  The  footnote  includes  an  ex-
cerpt  from  our  opinion  in  Roper  v.  Simmons,  543  U. S.  551, 
569 (2005), which quotes a study stating that a lack of matu-
rity and an undeveloped sense of responsibility are qualities 
that " `often result in impetuous and ill-considered actions.' "

58  GALL  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
The District Judge clearly stated the relevance of these stud-ies in the opening and closing sentences of the footnote: 

"Immaturity  at the  time  of  the  offense  conduct  is  not an  inconsequential  consideration.  Recent  studies  on 
the  development  of  the  human  brain  conclude  that human  brain  development  may  not  become  complete 
until  the  age  of  twenty-five. . . .  [T]he  recent  [National Institutes  of  Health]  report  confirms  that  there  is  no 
bold  line demarcating  at what age a person reaches  full maturity.  While  age  does  not  excuse  behavior,  a  sen-
tencing court should account for age when inquiring into the conduct of a defendant."  App. 123, n. 2. 

Given  the  dramatic  contrast  between  Gall's  behavior  be-fore  he  joined  the  conspiracy  and  his  conduct  after  with-
drawing,  it  was  not  unreasonable  for  the  District  Judge  to view  Gall's  immaturity  at  the  time  of  the  offense  as  a  miti-
gating  factor,  and  his  later  behavior  as  a  sign  that  he  had matured  and  would  not  engage  in  such  impetuous  and  ill-
considered conduct  in  the  future.  Indeed,  his  consideration of that factor finds support in our cases.  See, 

e. g., Johnson v.  Texas,  509  U. S.  350,  367  (1993)  (holding  that  a  jury  was 

free to consider a 19-year-old defendant's youth when deter-mining  whether  there  was  a  probability  that  he  would  con-
tinue  to  commit  violent  acts  in  the  future  and  stating  that " `youth  is  more  than  a  chronological  fact.  It  is  a  time  and 
condition  of  life  when  a  person  may  be  most  susceptible  to influence and to psychological damage' "  (quoting 

Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 115 (1982))). 

Finally,  the  Court  of  Appeals  thought  that,  even  if  Gall's rehabilitation  was  dramatic  and  permanent,  a  sentence  of 
probation  for  participation  as  a  middleman  in  a  conspiracy distributing 10,000  pills  of ecstasy  "lies  outside  the  range of 
choice  dictated  by  the  facts  of  the  case."  446  F.  3d,  at  890 (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  If  the  Guidelines  were 
still  mandatory,  and  assuming  the  facts  did  not  justify  a Guidelines-based downward departure, this would provide a 
sufficient  basis  for  setting  aside  Gall's  sentence  because  the

59 Cite as: 552 U. S. 38 (2007) 
Opinion of the Court 
Guidelines  state  that  probation  alone  is  not  an  appropriate sentence  for  comparable  offenses.

11  But  the  Guidelines  are 

not mandatory, and thus the "range of choice dictated by the facts of  the  case"  is  significantly  broadened.  Moreover, the 

Guidelines  are  only  one  of  the  factors  to  consider  when  im-posing sentence, and $ 3553(a)(3) directs the judge to consider 
sentences other than imprisonment. We  also  note  that  the  Government  did  not  argue  below, 
and  has  not  argued  here,  that  a  sentence  of  probation  could never  be  imposed  for  a  crime  identical  to  Gall's.  Indeed,  it 
acknowledged that probation could be permissible if the rec-ord  contained  different--but  in  our  view,  no  more  compel-
ling--mitigating  evidence.  Tr.  of  Oral  Arg.  37-38  (stating that  probation  could  be  an  appropriate  sentence,  given  the 
exact  same  offense,  if  "there  are  compelling  family  circum-stances where individuals  will be very  badly hurt  in  the de-
fendant's family if no one is available to take care of them"). The District Court quite reasonably attached great weight 
to Gall's self-motivated rehabilitation, which was undertaken not  at  the  direction  of,  or  under  supervision  by,  any  court, 
but on his own initiative.  This also lends strong support to the conclusion that imprisonment was not necessary to deter 
Gall  from  engaging  in  future  criminal  conduct  or  to  protect the  public  from  his  future  criminal  acts.  See  18  U. S. C. 

$$ 3553(a)(2)(B), (C). The  Court  of  Appeals  clearly  disagreed  with  the  District 
Judge's  conclusion  that  consideration  of  the  $ 3553(a)  factors justified a sentence of probation; it believed that the circum-
stances  presented  here  were  insufficient  to  sustain  such  a marked  deviation  from  the  Guidelines  range.  But  it  is  not 
for the Court of Appeals to decide de novo whether the justi-fication for a variance is sufficient or the sentence reasonable. 
On  abuse-of-discretion  review,  the  Court  of  Appeals  should have  given  due  deference  to  the  District  Court's  reasoned 

11 Specifically, probation is not recommended under the Guidelines when 
the applicable Guidelines range is outside Zone A of the sentencing table 
as it is here.  USSG $ 5B1.1.

Under  the  statute  criminalizing  the  manufacture  and  dis-tribution of crack  cocaine, 21 U. S. C. $ 841,  and the  relevant 
Guidelines  prescription,  $ 2D1.1,  a  drug  trafficker  dealing  in crack cocaine is subject to the  same sentence as one dealing 
in  100  times  more  powder  cocaine.  The  question  here  pre-sented is whether, as the Court of Appeals held in this case, 
"a sentence . . . outside the guidelines range is per se unrea-sonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentenc-

Policy  iv  (May  2002),  available  at  http://www.ussc.gov/ r_congress/02crack/2002crackrpt.pdf  (hereinafter  2002  Re-

port).6  This  disparity  means  that  a  major  supplier  of  pow-der  cocaine  may  receive  a  shorter  sentence  than  a  low-level 
dealer who buys powder from the supplier but then converts it to crack.  See 1995 Report 193-194. 

A 
The  crack/powder  disparity  originated  in  the  Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (1986 Act), 100 Stat. 3207.  The 1986 Act 

created a two-tiered scheme of five- and ten-year mandatory minimum sentences for drug manufacturing and distribution 
offenses.  Congress  sought "to link  the  ten-year mandatory minimum  trafficking  prison  term  to  major  drug  dealers  and 
to  link  the  five-year  minimum  term  to  serious  traffickers." 1995 Report 119.  The 1986 Act uses the weight of the drugs 
involved in the  offense as the sole proxy to identify "major" and  "serious" dealers.  For  example, any  defendant respon-
sible for 100 grams of heroin is subject to the five-year man-datory minimum, see 21 U. S. C. $ 841(b)(1)(B)(i) (2000 ed. and 
Supp.  V),  and  any  defendant  responsible  for  1,000  grams  of heroin  is  subject  to  the  ten-year  mandatory  minimum,  see 

$ 841(b)(1)(A)(i). Crack  cocaine  was  a  relatively  new  drug  when  the  1986 
Act was signed into law, but it was already a matter of great public  concern:  "Drug  abuse  in  general,  and  crack  cocaine 
in  particular,  had  become  in  public  opinion  and  in  mem-bers'  minds  a  problem  of  overwhelming  dimensions."  1995 
Report  121.  Congress  apparently  believed  that  crack  was significantly  more  dangerous  than  powder  cocaine  in  that: 
(1)  crack  was  highly  addictive;  (2)  crack  users  and  dealers were  more  likely  to  be  violent  than  users  and  dealers  of

fense  levels  for  crack  and  powder  cocaine,  the  Commission, in  line  with  the  1986  Act,  adopted  the  100-to-1  ratio.  The 

statute  itself  specifies  only  two  quantities  of  each  drug,  but the  Guidelines  "go  further  and  set  sentences  for  the  full 
range  of  possible  drug  quantities  using  the  same  100-to-1 quantity ratio. "  1995 Report  1.  The Guidelines' drug 
quantity  table  sets  base  offense  levels  ranging  from  12,  for offenses  involving  less  than  250  milligrams  of  crack  (or  25 
grams of powder), to 38, for offenses involving more than 1.5 kilograms  of  crack  (or  150  kilograms  of  powder).  USSG 

$ 2D1.1(c).8  B 

Although  the  Commission  immediately  used  the  100-to-1 ratio  to  define  base  offense  levels  for  all  crack  and  powder 
offenses,  it  later  determined that  the  crack/powder  sentenc-ing disparity is generally unwarranted.  Based on additional 
research and experience with the 100-to-1 ratio, the Commis-sion  concluded  that  the  disparity  "fails  to  meet  the  sentenc-
ing  objectives  set  forth  by  Congress  in  both  the  Sentencing Reform Act and the 1986 Act."  2002 Report 91.  In a series 
of  reports,  the  Commission  identified  three  problems  with the crack/powder disparity. 

First,  the  Commission  reported,  the  100-to-1  ratio  rested on  assumptions  about  "the  relative  harmfulness  of  the  two 
drugs and the relative prevalence of certain harmful conduct associated  with  their  use  and  distribution  that  more  recent 
research  and  data  no  longer  support."  Ibid.;

with  the  crack/powder  ratio,  unwarranted disparities  of  two kinds  will  ensue.  See  18  U. S. C.  $ 3553(a)(6)  (sentencing 

courts  shall  consider  "the  need  to  avoid  unwarranted  sen-tence disparities").  First, because sentencing courts remain 
bound  by  the  mandatory  minimum  sentences  prescribed  in the  1986  Act,  deviations  from the  100-to-1  ratio  could  result 
in sentencing "cliffs" around quantities that trigger the man-
datory minimums.  Brief for United States 33 (internal quo-tation  marks  omitted).  For  example,  a  district  court  could 

grant a sizable downward  variance to a  defendant convicted of  distributing  49  grams  of  crack  but  would  be  required  by 
the statutory minimum to impose a much higher sentence on 
a defendant responsible for only 1 additional gram.  Second, 
the Government maintains that, if district courts are permit-
ted to vary from the Guidelines based on their disagreement 
with  the  crack/powder  disparity,  "defendants  with  identical 
real  conduct  will  receive  markedly  different  sentences,  de-
pending  on  nothing  more  than  the  particular  judge  drawn 
for sentencing."  Id.,

court  suggested  that  the  100-to-1  ratio  itself  created  an  un-warranted  disparity  within  the  meaning  of  $ 3553(a).  Fi-

nally, the court did not purport to establish a ratio of its own. Rather, it appropriately framed its final determination in line 
with  $ 3553(a)'s  overarching  instruction  to  "impose  a  sen-tence  sufficient,  but  not  greater  than  necessary,"  to  accom-
plish  the  sentencing  goals  advanced  in  $ 3553(a)(2).  See

a  misleading  financial  statement  affecting  the  stock  price. We  conclude  the  implied  right  of  action  does  not  reach  the 

customer/supplier  companies  because  the  investors  did  not rely  upon  their  statements  or  representations.  We  affirm 
the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 

I 
This  class-action  suit  by  investors  was  filed  against  Char-ter  Communications,  Inc.,  in  the  United  States  District 

Court  for  the  Eastern  District  of  Missouri.  Stoneridge  In-vestment  Partners,  LLC,  a  limited  liability  company  orga-
nized under the laws of Delaware, was the lead  plaintiff and is petitioner here. 

Charter  issued  the financial  statements and the  securities in  question.  It  was  a  named  defendant  along  with  some  of 
its  executives  and  Arthur  Andersen  LLP,  Charter's  inde-pendent auditor during the period in question.  We are con-
cerned,  though,  with  two  other  defendants,  respondents here.  Respondents  are  Scientific-Atlanta,  Inc.,  and  Mo-
torola,  Inc.  They  were  suppliers,  and  later  customers,  of Charter. 

For  purposes  of  this  proceeding,  we  take  these  facts,  al-leged  by  petitioner,  to  be  true.  Charter,  a  cable  operator, 
engaged in  a variety  of fraudulent practices so its quarterly reports  would  meet  Wall  Street  expectations  for  cable  sub-
scriber  growth  and  operating  cashflow.  The  fraud  included misclassification  of  its  customer  base;  delayed  reporting  of 
terminated  customers;  improper  capitalization  of  costs  that should  have  been  shown  as  expenses;  and  manipulation  of 
the  company's  billing  cutoff  dates  to  inflate  reported  reve-nues.  In late 2000, Charter executives realized that, despite 
these  efforts,  the  company  would  miss  projected  operating cashflow  numbers  by  $15  to  $20  million.  To  help  meet  the 
shortfall, Charter decided to alter its existing arrangements with  respondents,  Scientific-Atlanta  and  Motorola.  Peti-

ter to purchase  advertising  time for  a price higher than  fair value.  The  new  set-top  box  agreements were  backdated  to 

make it appear that they were negotiated a month before the advertising  agreements.  The  backdating  was  important  to 
convey the  impression that  the  negotiations  were unconnec-ted, a point Arthur Andersen considered necessary for sepa-
rate  treatment  of  the  transactions.  Charter  recorded  the 
advertising payments to inflate revenue and operating cash-flow by approximately $17 million.  The inflated number was 

shown  on  financial  statements  filed  with  the  Securities  and Exchange Commission (SEC) and reported to the public. 

Respondents  had  no  role  in  preparing  or  disseminating 
Charter's  financial  statements.  And  their  own  financial 
statements booked the  transactions as a wash, under gener-
ally  accepted  accounting  principles.  It  is  alleged  respond-
ents  knew  or  were  in  reckless  disregard  of  Charter's  inten-
tion to use the transactions  to inflate its revenues and knew 
the  resulting  financial  statements  issued  by  Charter  would 
be relied upon by research analysts and investors. 

Petitioner  filed  a  securities  fraud  class  action  on  behalf  of 
purchasers  of  Charter  stock  alleging  that,  by  participating 
in the transactions, respondents violated $ 10(b) of the Secu-
rities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5. 

The District Court granted respondents' motion to dismiss 
for  failure  to  state  a  claim  on  which  relief  can  be  granted. 
The  United  States  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Eighth  Circuit 
affirmed.  In

to  the  investors'  harm.  That  conclusion  is  consistent  with our own determination that respondents' acts or statements 

were  not  relied  upon  by  the  investors  and  that,  as  a  result, liability cannot be imposed upon respondents. 

A 
Reliance  by  the  plaintiff  upon  the  defendant's  deceptive acts  is  an  essential  element  of  the  $ 10(b)  private  cause  of 

action.  It  ensures  that,  for  liability  to  arise,  the  "requisite causal  connection  between  a  defendant's  misrepresentation 
and  a  plaintiff 's  injury"  exists  as  a  predicate  for  liability.

Opinion of the Court 
The  Second  Circuit's  Approach  to  the  `In  Connection  With' Requirement  of  Rule  10b-5,  53  Brooklyn  L.  Rev.  539,  541 

(1987)  ("[W]hile  the  `in  connection  with'  and  causation  re-quirements are analytically distinct, they are related to each 
other,  and  discussion  of  the  first  requirement  may  merge with  discussion  of  the  second").  In  all  events  we  conclude 
respondents' deceptive acts, which were not disclosed to the 
investing  public,  are  too  remote  to  satisfy  the  requirement of  reliance.  It  was  Charter,  not  respondents,  that  misled 

its auditor and filed fraudulent financial statements; nothing respondents did  made it  necessary  or inevitable for  Charter 
to record the transactions as it did. 

Petitioner invokes the private cause of action under $ 10(b) 
and  seeks  to  apply  it  beyond  the  securities  markets--the 
realm  of  financing  business--to  purchase  and  supply  con-
tracts--the realm of ordinary business operations.  The lat-
ter realm is governed, for the most part, by state law.  It is 
true that if business operations are used, as alleged here, to 
affect  securities  markets,  the  SEC  enforcement  power  may 
reach the culpable actors.  It is true as well that a dynamic, 
free economy presupposes a high degree of integrity in all of 
its  parts,  an  integrity  that  must  be  underwritten  by  rules 
enforceable  in  fair,  independent,  accessible  courts.  Were 
the  implied  cause  of  action  to  be  extended  to  the  practices 
described here, however, there would be a risk that the fed-
eral power would be used to invite litigation beyond the im-
mediate  sphere  of  securities  litigation  and  in  areas  already 
governed by  functioning  and  effective state-law  guarantees. 
Our precedents counsel against this extension.  See Marine

the  Trust's  assets.  At  the  beginning  of  the  tax  year,  the Trust  held  approximately  $2.9  million  in  marketable  securi-
ties, and it paid Warfield $22,241 in investment advisory fees for  the  year.  On  its  fiduciary  income  tax  return  for  2000, 
the Trust reported total income of $624,816, and it deducted in full the investment advisory fees paid to Warfield.  After 
conducting  an  audit,  respondent  Commissioner  of  Internal Revenue  found  that  these  investment  advisory  fees  were 
miscellaneous  itemized  deductions  subject  to  the  2%  floor. The Commissioner therefore allowed the Trust to deduct the 
investment  advisory  fees,  which  were  the  only  claimed  de-ductions  subject  to  the  floor,  only  to  the  extent  that  they 
exceeded 2% of the Trust's adjusted gross income.  The dis-crepancy resulted in a tax deficiency of $4,448. 

The  Trust  filed  a  petition  in  the  United  States  Tax  Court seeking  review  of  the  assessed  deficiency.  It  argued  that 
the  Trustee's  fiduciary  duty  to  act  as  a  "prudent  investor"

estate  or  trust  shall  be  computed  in  the  same  manner  as in  the  case  of  an  individual."  Under  the  Trustee's  reading, 

$ 67(e)(1)'s  exception  would  swallow  the  general  rule;  most (if  not  all)  expenses  incurred  by  a  trust  would  be  fully 
deductible.  "Given  that  Congress  has  enacted  a  general 
rule . . . , we  should not eviscerate that legislative judgment through an expansive reading  of  a somewhat ambiguous  ex-

ception."  Ibid.

Tax  Court  Rule  142(a)(1)  (stating  that  the  "burden  of  proof shall  be  upon  the  petitioner,"  with  certain  exceptions  not 

relevant  here).  The  Trustee's  argument  is  that  individuals cannot incur trust investment advisory fees, not that individ-
uals do not commonly incur investment advisory fees. Indeed,  the  essential  point  of  the  Trustee's  argument  is 
that  he  engaged  an  investment  adviser  because  of  his  fidu-
ciary  duties  under  Connecticut's  Uniform  Prudent  Investor Act,  Conn.  Gen.  Stat.  $ 45a-541a(a)  (2007).  The  Act  epony-

mously  requires  trustees  to  follow  the  "prudent  investor rule."  See  n.  2,

interests of various  parties, such that a reasonable compari-son with individual investors would be improper.  In such a 

case,  the  incremental  cost  of  expert  advice  beyond  what would normally be required for the ordinary taxpayer would 
not  be  subject  to  the  2%  floor.  Here,  however,  the  Trust has not asserted that its investment objective or its requisite 
balancing  of  competing  interests  was  distinctive.  Accord-ingly, we conclude that the investment advisory fees incurred 
by the Trust are subject to the 2% floor. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

Respondent  Lo' pez  Torres  was  elected  in  1992  to  the  civil court for Kings County--a court with more limited jurisdic-

tion than the Supreme Court--having gained the nomination of  the  Democratic  Party  through  a  primary  election.  She 
claims  that  soon  after  her  election,  party  leaders  began  to demand that she make patronage hires, and that her consist-
ent  refusal  to  do  so  caused  the  local  party  to  oppose  her unsuccessful  candidacy  at  the  Supreme  Court  nominating 
conventions  in  1997,  2002,  and  2003.  The  following  year, Lo' pez  Torres--together  with  other  candidates  who  had 
failed  to secure  the  nominations  of their  parties, voters  who claimed  to  have  supported  those  candidates,  and  the  New 
York branch of a public-interest organization called Common Cause--brought  suit  in  federal  court  against  the  New  York 
Board  of  Elections,  which  is  responsible  for  administering and  enforcing  the  New  York  election  law.  See  $$ 3-102,  3-

dates  favored  by  the  party  leadership,  and  deprived  voters and candidates of their rights to gain access to the ballot and 
to  associate  in  choosing  their  party's  candidates.  As  rele-

in that election, but that the convention process that follows the  delegate  election  does  not  give  them  a  realistic  chance 

to  secure  the  party's  nomination.  The  party  leadership, they  say, inevitably  garners  more votes  for  its slate  of dele-
gates  (delegates  uncommitted  to  any  judicial  nominee)  than the unsupported candidate can amass for himself.  And thus 
the  leadership  effectively  determines  the  nominees.  But 
this  says  nothing  more  than  that  the  party  leadership  has more widespread support than a candidate not supported by 

the  leadership.  No  New  York  law  compels  election  of  the leadership's slate--or, for that matter, compels the delegates 
elected  on  the  leadership's  slate  to  vote  the  way  the  leader-
ship  desires.  And  no  state  law  prohibits  an  unsupported 
candidate from attending the convention and seeking to per-
suade  the  delegates  to  support  her.  Our  cases  invalidating 
ballot-access requirements have focused on the requirements 
themselves,  and  not  on  the  manner  in  which  political  actors 
function  under  those  requirements.  See,  e.

Respondents  put  forward,  as  a  special  factor  which  gives them a First Amendment right to revision of party processes 

in  the  present  case,  the  assertion  that  party  loyalty  in  New York's  judicial  districts  renders  the  general-election  ballot 
"uncompetitive."  They  argue  that  the  existence  of  en-trenched  "one-party  rule"  demands  that  the  First  Amend-
ment  be  used  to  impose  additional  competition  in  the nominee-selection  process  of  the  parties.  (The  asserted 
"one-party  rule,"  we  may  observe,  is  that  of  the  Democrats in  some  judicial  districts,  and  of  the  Republicans  in  others. 
See 411 F. Supp. 2d, at 230.)  This is a novel and implausible reading of the First Amendment. 

To  begin  with,  it  is  hard  to  understand  how  the  competi-tiveness  of  the  general  election  has  anything  to  do  with  re-
spondents'  associational  rights  in  the  party's  selection  proc-ess.  It  makes  no  difference  to  the  person  who  associates 
with  a  party  and  seeks  its  nomination  whether  the  party  is a  contender  in  the  general  election,  an  underdog,  or  the  fa-
vorite.  Competitiveness may be of interest to the voters in the general election, and to the candidates who choose to run

ences to "tax or customs duty" and "officer[s] of customs or excise" indi-
cate an intent to preserve immunity for claims arising from an officer's 
enforcement of tax and customs laws.  The text also indicates, however, 
that  Congress  intended  to  preserve  immunity  for  claims  arising  from 
the  detention  of  property,  and  there  is  no  indication  of  any  intent  that 
immunity for those claims turns on the type of law being enforced.  Re-
cent amendments to $ 2680(c) restoring the  sovereign immunity waiver 
for officers enforcing any federal forfeiture law, see $ 2680(c)(1), support 
the  Court's  conclusion  by  demonstrating  Congress'  view  that,  prior 

to  the  amendments,  $ 2680(c)  covered  all  law  enforcement  officers. 
Against this textual and structural evidence, petitioner's reliance on the 
canons of statutory construction ejusdem  generis and noscitur a sociis 
and on the rule against superfluities is unconvincing.  The Court is un-
persuaded  by  petitioner's  attempt  to  create  ambiguity  where  the  stat-
ute's structure and text suggest none.  Had Congress intended to limit 

$ 2680(c)'s reach as petitioner contends, it easily could have written "any 
other  law enforcement  officer  acting  in  a  customs  or excise  capacity." 
Instead, it used the unmodified, all-encompassing phrase "any other law 
enforcement officer."  This Court must give effect to the text Congress 
enacted.  Pp. 217-228.

Opinion of the Court 
immunity does not apply to claims arising from the detention of property by "any officer of customs or excise or any other 

law  enforcement  officer."  Petitioner  contends  that  this clause applies only to law enforcement officers enforcing cus-
toms  or  excise  laws,  and  thus  does  not  affect  the  waiver  of sovereign immunity for his property claim against officers of 
the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).  We conclude that the broad  phrase  "any  other  law  enforcement  officer"  covers  all 
law  enforcement  officers.  Accordingly,  we  affirm  the  judg-ment of the Court of Appeals upholding the dismissal of peti-
tioner's claim.  I 

Petitioner  Abdus-Shahid  M.  S.  Ali  was  a  federal  prisoner at  the  United  States  Penitentiary  in  Atlanta,  Georgia,  from 
2001  to  2003.  In  December  2003,  petitioner  was  scheduled to  be  transferred  to  the  United  States  Penitentiary  Big 
Sandy  (USP  Big  Sandy)  in  Inez,  Kentucky.  Before  being transferred,  he  left  two  duffle  bags  containing  his  personal 
property  in  the  Atlanta  prison's  Receiving  and  Discharge Unit  to  be  inventoried,  packaged,  and  shipped  to  USP  Big 
Sandy.  Petitioner  was  transferred,  and  his  bags  arrived some  days  later.  Upon  inspecting  his  property,  he  noticed 
that  several  items  were  missing.  The  staff  at  USP  Big Sandy's  Receiving  and  Discharge  Unit  told  him  that  he  had 
been given everything that was sent, and that if things were missing he could file a claim.  Many of the purportedly miss-
ing items were of religious and nostalgic significance, includ-ing two copies of the Qur'an, a prayer rug, and religious mag-
azines.  Petitioner  estimated  that  the  items  were  worth $177. 

Petitioner  filed  an  administrative  tort  claim.  In  denying relief, the agency noted that, by his signature on the receipt 
form,  petitioner  had  certified  the  accuracy  of  the  inventory listed  thereon  and  had  thereby  relinquished  any  future 
claims relating  to missing  or  damaged property.  Petitioner then  filed  a  complaint  alleging, 

inter  alia,  violations  of  the

Opinion of the Court 
Federal  Tort  Claims  Act  (FTCA),  28  U. S. C.  $$ 1346,  2671 et  seq.  The  BOP  maintained  that  petitioner's  claim  was 

barred  by  the  exception  in  $ 2680(c)  for  property  claims against law enforcement officers.  The District Court agreed 
and  dismissed  petitioner's  FTCA  claim  for  lack  of  subject-matter jurisdiction.  Petitioner appealed. 

The  Eleventh Circuit  affirmed,  agreeing with  the  District Court's interpretation of $ 2680(c).  204 Fed. Appx. 778, 779- 
780  (2006)  (per  curiam).  In  rejecting  petitioner's  argu-ments,  the  Court  of  Appeals  relied  on  this  Court's  broad 
interpretation  of  $ 2680(c)'s  "detention"  clause  in  Kosak  v. 
United  States,  465  U. S.  848,  854-859  (1984),  on  decisions by  other  Courts  of  Appeals,  and  on  its  own  decision  in

conclusion,  interpreting  the  clause  as  limited  to  officers  performing  cus-
toms or excise functions.  See ABC v. DEF, 500 F. 3d 103, 107 (CA2 2007);

Opinion of the Court 
by  federal  employees.  See  28  U. S. C.  $ 1346(b)(1).  As relevant  here,  the  FTCA  authorizes  "claims  against  the 

United  States,  for  money  damages  .  .  .  for  injury  or  loss  of property  .  .  .  caused  by  the  negligent  or  wrongful  act  or 
omission  of  any  employee  of  the  Government  while  acting within  the  scope  of  his  office  or  employment." 

Ibid.  The FTCA exempts from this waiver certain categories of claims. 

See $$ 2680(a)-(n).  Relevant here is the exception in subsec-tion (c), which provides that $ 1346(b) shall not apply to "[a]ny 
claim arising in respect of the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty, or the detention of any goods, merchan-
dise, or other property by any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer."  $ 2680(c). 

This case turns on whether the BOP officers who allegedly lost  petitioner's  property  qualify  as  "other  law  enforcement 
officer[s]"  within  the  meaning  of  $ 2680(c).2  Petitioner  ar-gues  that  they  do  not  because  "any  other  law  enforcement 
officer"  includes  only  law  enforcement  officers  acting  in  a customs  or  excise  capacity.  Noting  that  Congress  refer-
enced  customs  and  excise  activities  in  both  the  language  at issue and the preceding clause in $ 2680(c), petitioner argues 
that  the  entire  subsection  is  focused  on  preserving  the United States' sovereign immunity only as to officers enforc-
ing those laws. Petitioner's  argument  is  inconsistent  with  the  statute's 
language.3  The phrase "any other law enforcement officer" 

2 We  assume,  without  deciding,  that  the  BOP  officers  "detained"  Ali's 
property  and  thus  satisfy  $ 2680(c)'s  "arising  in  respect  of  .  .  .  detention" 
requirement.  The Court of Appeals held that the "detention" clause was 
satisfied, and petitioner expressly declined to raise the issue on certiorari.

argues that this Court concluded in Kosak v.  United States, 465 U. S. 848 
(1984), that the phrase "any other law enforcement officer" is ambiguous.

suggests  a  broad  meaning.  Ibid.  (emphasis  added).  We have  previously  noted  that  "[r]ead  naturally,  the  word  `any' 

has  an  expansive  meaning,  that  is,  `one  or  some  indiscrimi-nately  of  whatever  kind.' "  United  States  v.  Gonzales,  520 
U. S. 1, 5 (1997) (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary  97  (1976)).  In  Gonzales,  we  considered  a  provi-
sion that imposed an additional sentence for firearms used in federal drug  trafficking crimes and provided that such addi-
tional sentence shall not be concurrent with " `any other term of  imprisonment.' "  520  U. S.,  at  4  (quoting  18  U. S. C. 

$ 924(c)(1)  (1994  ed.);  emphasis  deleted).  Notwithstanding the  subsection's  initial  reference  to  federal  drug  trafficking 
crimes,  we  held  that  the  expansive  word  "any"  and  the  ab-sence  of  restrictive  language  left  "no  basis  in  the  text  for 
limiting"  the  phrase  "any  other  term  of  imprisonment"  to federal  sentences.  520  U. S.,  at  5.  Similarly,  in  Harrison 
v.  PPG Industries, Inc., 446  U. S. 578  (1980), the  Court  con-sidered the phrase "any other final action" in amendments to 
the  Clean  Air  Act.  The  Court  explained  that  the  amend-ments  expanded  a  list  of  Environmental  Protection  Agency 
Administrator  actions  by  adding  two  categories  of  actions: actions  under  a  specifically  enumerated  statutory  provision, 
and  "any  other  final  action"  under  the  Clean  Air  Act.  Id., at  584  (emphasis  deleted).  Focusing  on  Congress'  choice  of 
the word "any," the Court "discern[ed] no uncertainty in the meaning of the phrase, `any other final action,' " and empha-
sized that the statute's "expansive language offer[ed] no indi-
of  the  same  clause  at  issue  here,  but  the  decision  had  no  bearing  on  the 
meaning  of  "any  other  law  enforcement  officer."  465  U. S.,  at  853-862 
(holding  that  "detention"  encompasses  claims  resulting  from  negligent 
handling  or  storage).  Indeed,  the  Court  expressly  declined  to  reach  the 
issue.  Id., at 852, n. 6 ("We have no occasion in this case to decide what 
kinds of `law-enforcement officer[s],' other than customs officials, are cov-
ered  by  the  exception"  (alteration  in  original)).  Petitioner's  reliance  on 
the  footnote  as  concluding  that  the  phrase  is  ambiguous  reads  too  much 
into the Court's reservation of a question that was not then before it.

Opinion of the Court 
cation whatever that Congress intended" to limit the phrase to final actions similar to those in the specifically enumerated 

sections.  Id., at 588-589. We think the reasoning of Gonzales and Harrison applies 
equally  to  the  expansive  language  Congress  employed  in  28 U. S. C.  $ 2680(c).  Congress'  use  of  "any"  to  modify  "other 
law enforcement officer" is  most naturally read to mean law enforcement  officers  of  whatever  kind.

4  The  word  "any"  is 

repeated  four  times  in  the  relevant  portion  of  $ 2680(c),  and two  of  those  instances  appear  in  the  particular  phrase  at 

issue: "any officer of customs or excise or any other law en-forcement  officer."  (Emphasis  added.)  Congress  inserted 
the  word  "any"  immediately  before  "other  law  enforcement officer,"  leaving  no  doubt  that  it  modifies  that  phrase.  To 
be  sure,  the  text's  references  to  "tax  or  customs  duty"  and "officer[s]  of  customs  or  excise"  indicate  that  Congress  in-
tended to preserve immunity for claims arising from an offi-cer's  enforcement  of  tax  and  customs  laws.  The  text  also 
indicates,  however,  that  Congress  intended  to  preserve  im-munity for claims arising from the detention of property, and 

4 Of course, other circumstances may counteract the effect of expansive 
modifiers.  For  example,  we  have  construed  an  "any"  phrase  narrowly 
when  it  included  a  term  of  art  that  compelled  that  result.  See  Circuit 
City Stores, Inc. v.  Adams, 532 U. S. 105, 115-116 (2001) (construing "any 
other class of workers engaged in . . . commerce," 9 U. S. C. $ 1, narrowly 
based on  the  Court's  previous interpretation  of "in  commerce"  as a  term 
of  art  with  a  narrower  meaning).  We  also  have  construed  such  phrases 
narrowly  when  another  term  in  the  provision  made  sense  only  under  a 
narrow reading, see United States v.  Alvarez-Sanchez, 511 U. S. 350, 357- 
358  (1994)  (limiting  "any  law-enforcement  officer"  to  federal  officers  be-
cause  the  statute's  reference  to  "delay"  made  sense  only  with  respect  to 
federal  officers),  and  when a  broad  reading would  have  implicated sover-
eignty  concerns,  see  Raygor  v.  Regents  of  Univ.  of  Minn.,  534  U. S.  533, 
541-542 (2002) (applying the "clear statement rule"  applicable to  waivers 
of sovereign immunity to construe the phrase "all civil actions" to exclude 
a  category  of  claims,  "even  though  nothing  in  the  statute  expressly  ex-
clude[d]" them).  None of the circumstances that motivated our decisions 
in these cases is present here.

Opinion of the Court 
there  is  no  indication  that  Congress  intended  immunity  for those claims to turn on the type of law being enforced. 

Petitioner  would  require  Congress  to  clarify  its  intent  to cover  all  law  enforcement  officers  by  adding  phrases  such 
as  "performing  any  official  law  enforcement  function,"  or "without  limitation."  But  Congress  could  not  have  chosen 
a more all-encompassing phrase than "any other law enforce-
ment  officer"  to  express  that  intent.  We  have  no  reason to demand  that  Congress  write  less  economically  and  more 

repetitiously. Recent  amendments  to  $ 2680(c)  support  the  conclusion 
that  "any  other  law  enforcement  officer"  is  not  limited  to officers  acting  in  a  customs  or  excise  capacity.  In  the  Civil 
Asset  Forfeiture  Reform  Act  of  2000,  Congress  added  sub-sections  (c)(1)-(c)(4)  to  28  U. S. C.  $ 2680.  $ 3(a),  114  Stat. 
211.  As  amended,  $ 2680(c)  provides  that  the  $ 1346(b) waiver  of  sovereign  immunity,  notwithstanding  the  excep-
tion at issue in this case, applies to: 

"[A]ny  claim  based  on  injury  or  loss  of  goods,  merchan-
dise,  or  other  property,  while  in  the  possession  of  any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement 

officer, if-- "(1)  the  property  was  seized  for  the  purpose  of  for-
feiture under any provision of Federal law providing for 
the  forfeiture  of  property  other  than  as  a  sentence  im-posed upon conviction of a criminal offense; 

"(2)  the interest of the claimant was not forfeited; "(3)  the  interest  of  the  claimant  was  not  remitted  or 
mitigated (if the property was subject to forfeiture); and 

"(4)  the  claimant  was  not  convicted  of  a  crime  for 
which  the  interest  of  the  claimant  in  the  property  was 
subject  to  forfeiture  under  a  Federal  criminal  forfeit-
ure law." 

The amendment does not govern petitioner's claim because 
his  property  was  not  "seized  for  the  purpose  of  forfeiture,"

Opinion of the Court 
as required by paragraph (1).  Nonetheless, the amendment 
is  relevant  because  our  construction  of  "any  other  law  en-
forcement  officer"  must,  to  the  extent  possible,  ensure  that 
the  statutory  scheme  is  coherent  and  consistent.  See  Rob-
inson v.  Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 340 (1997) (citing United 
States  v.  Ron  Pair  Enterprises,  Inc.,  489  U. S.  235,  240 
(1989)).  The  amendment  canceled  the  exception--and  thus 
restored  the  waiver  of sovereign  immunity--for  certain  sei-
zures  of  property  based  on  any  federal  forfeiture  law.  See 
28  U. S. C.  $ 2680(c)(1)  (excepting  property  claims  if  "the 
property was seized  for the purpose  of forfeiture under  any 
provision of Federal law providing for the forfeiture of prop-
erty" (emphasis added)). 

Under petitioner's interpretation, only law enforcement of-
ficers  enforcing  customs  or  excise  laws  were  immune  under 
the prior version of $ 2680(c).  Thus, on petitioner's reading, 
the  amendment's  only  effect  was  to  restore  the  waiver  for 
cases  in  which  customs  or  excise  officers,  or  officers  acting 
in  such  a  capacity,  enforce  forfeiture  laws.  This  strikes  us 
as an implausible interpretation of the statute.  If that were 
Congress'  intent,  it  is  not  apparent  why  Congress  would 
have restored the waiver with respect to the enforcement of 
all  civil  forfeiture  laws  instead  of  simply  those  related  to 
customs  or  excise.  Petitioner's  interpretation  makes  sense 
only  if  we  assume  that  Congress  went  out  of  its  way  to  re-
store the waiver for cases in which customs or excise officers, 
or  officers  acting  in  such  a  capacity,  enforce  forfeiture  laws 
unrelated to customs or excise.  But petitioner fails to dem-
onstrate  that  customs  or  excise  officers,  or  officers  acting  in 
such  a  capacity,  ever  enforce  civil  forfeiture  laws  unrelated 
to  customs  or  excise,  much  less  that  they  do  so  with  such 
frequency  that  Congress  is  likely  to  have  singled  them  out 
in the amendment.5  It seems far more likely that Congress

Opinion of the Court 
restored the waiver for officers enforcing any civil forfeiture law  because,  in  its  view,  all  such  officers  were  covered  by 

the exception to the waiver prior to the amendment. Against  this  textual  and  structural  evidence  that  "any 
other  law  enforcement  officer"  does  in  fact  mean  any  other law enforcement officer, petitioner invokes numerous canons 
of  statutory  construction.  He  relies  primarily  on  ejusdem 
generis, or the principle that "when a general term follows a specific one, the general term should be understood as a ref-

erence  to  subjects  akin  to  the  one  with  specific  enumera-tion." 

Norfolk  &  Western  R.  Co.  v.  Train  Dispatchers,  499 
U. S.  117,  129  (1991).  In  petitioner's  view,  "any  officer  of customs  or  excise  or  any  other  law  enforcement  officer" 

should  be  read  as  a  three-item  list,  and  the  final,  catchall 
forfeiture  laws  unrelated  to  customs  or  excise.  Post,  at  239-240.  But 
the  examples  the  dissent  provides  do  not  support  that  assertion.  The 
dissent  maintains  that  a  customs  officer  who  seizes  material  defined  as 
contraband under 49 U. S. C. $ 80302 et seq. is one such example.  Post, at 
240.  But a customs officer's authority to effect a forfeiture of such contra-
band derives from a specific customs law.  See 19 U. S. C. $ 1595a(c)(1)(C). 
Similarly,  the  dissent  suggests  that  a  Drug  Enforcement  Administration 
(DEA)  agent  "assisting  a  customs  official"  in  a  border  search  who  seizes 
drug-related contraband under  21 U. S. C. $ 881 is acting  in a "traditional 
revenue  capacity."  Post, at 240.  But that argument  is based  on the  as-
sumption that an officer who assists in conducting a border search acts in 
a customs capacity even if he is not a customs officer and is not enforcing 
a customs law.  That  assumption, far  from self-evident, only underscores 
the difficulty that would attend any attempt to define the contours of the 
implied limitation on $ 2680(c)'s reach proposed by petitioner and embraced 
by  the  dissent.  "Acting  in  a  customs  or  excise  capacity"  is  not  a  self-
defining concept, and not having included such a limitation in the statute's 
language,  Congress  of  course  did  not  provide  a  definition.  Finally,  the 
dissent points out that a customs or excise officer might effect a forfeiture 
of currency or monetary instruments under 31 U. S. C. $ 5317(c).  Post, at 
240.  But  $ 5317(c)  is  hardly  a  civil  forfeiture  law  unrelated  to  customs 
or  excise.  See  $ 5317(c)(2)  (2000  ed.,  Supp.  V)  (authorizing  forfeiture  of 
property  involved  in  a  violation  of,  inter  alia,  $ 5316  (2000  ed.),  which 
sets  forth  reporting  requirements  for  exporting  and  importing  monetary 
instruments).

Opinion of the Court 
phrase "any other law enforcement officer" should be limited 
to  officers  of  the  same  nature  as  the  preceding  specific 
phrases. 

Petitioner likens his case  to two recent  cases in  which we 
found  the  canon  useful.  In  Washington  State  Dept.  of  So-
cial  and  Health  Servs.  v.  Guardianship  Estate  of  Keffeler, 
537  U. S.  371,  375  (2003),  we  considered  the  clause  "execu-
tion,  levy,  attachment,  garnishment,  or  other  legal  process" 
in  42  U. S. C.  $ 407(a).  Applying  ejusdem  generis,  we  con-
cluded  that  "other  legal  process"  was  limited  to  legal  proc-
esses  of  the  same  nature  as  the  specific  items  listed.  537 
U. S.,  at  384-385.  The  department's  scheme  for  serving  as 
a representative payee of the  benefits due to children under 
its  care,  while  a  "legal  process,"  did  not  share  the  common 
attribute of the listed items, viz., "utilization of some judicial 
or quasi-judicial mechanism . . .  by  which  control  over prop-
erty passes from one person to another in order to discharge" 
a  debt.  Id.,  at  385.  Similarly,  in  Dolan  v.  Postal  Service, 
546 U. S. 481 (2006), the Court considered whether an excep-
tion to the  FTCA's waiver of sovereign  immunity for  claims 
arising  out  of the " `loss, miscarriage,  or negligent transmis-
sion  of  letters  or  postal  matter' "  barred  a  claim  that  mail 
negligently  left  on  the  petitioner's  porch  caused  her  to  slip 
and  fall.  Id.,  at  485  (quoting  28  U. S. C.  $ 2680(b)).  Noting 
that "loss" and "miscarriage" both addressed "failings in the 
postal  obligation  to  deliver  mail  in  a  timely  manner  to  the 
right  address,"  546  U. S.,  at  487,  the  Court  concluded  that 
"negligent  transmission"  must  be  similarly  limited,  id.,  at 
486-489,  and  rejected  the  Government's  argument  that  the 
exception  applied  to  "all  torts  committed  in  the  course  of 
mail delivery," id., at 490. 

Petitioner asserts that $ 2680(c), like the clauses at issue in 
Keffeler  and  Dolan,  " `presents  a  textbook  ejusdem  generis 
scenario.' "  Brief  for  Petitioner  15  (quoting  Andrews  v. 
United States, 441 F. 3d 220, 224 (CA4 2006)).  We disagree.

Opinion of the Court 
The structure of the phrase "any officer of customs or excise 
or any  other law  enforcement  officer"  does  not  lend  itself to 
application of the canon.  The phrase is disjunctive, with one 
specific  and  one  general  category,  not--like  the  clauses  at 
issue  in  Keffeler  and  Dolan--a  list  of  specific  items  sepa-
rated  by  commas  and  followed  by  a  general  or  collective 
term.  The  absence  of  a  list  of  specific  items  undercuts  the 
inference  embodied  in  ejusdem  generis  that  Congress  re-
mained  focused  on  the  common  attribute  when  it  used  the 
catchall phrase.  Cf. United States v.  Aguilar, 515 U. S. 593, 
615  (1995)  (Scalia,

sessment and collection of taxes  and customs  duties and the 
detention of property. 

Petitioner's  appeals  to  other  interpretive  principles  are 
also  unconvincing.  Petitioner  contends  that  his  reading  is 
supported by the canon noscitur a sociis, according to which 
" `a word is known by the company it keeps.' "  S. D. Warren 
Co. v.  Maine Bd. of Environmental Protection, 547 U. S. 370, 
378  (2006).  But  the  cases  petitioner  cites  in  support  of 
applying  noscitur  a  sociis  involved  statutes  with  stronger 
contextual  cues.  See  Gutierrez  v.  Ada,  528  U. S.  250,  254- 
258 (2000) (applying the canon to narrow the relevant phrase, 
"any  election,"  where  it  was  closely  surrounded  by  six  spe-
cific references to gubernatorial elections); Jarecki, supra, at 
306-309  (applying  the  canon  to  narrow  the  term  "discover-
ies"  to  discoveries  of  mineral  resources  where  it  was  con-
tained in a list of three words, all of which applied to the oil, 
gas,  and  mining  industries  and  could  not  conceivably  all 
apply  to  any  other  industry).  Here,  although  customs  and 
excise are mentioned twice in $ 2680(c), nothing in the overall 
statutory  context  suggests  that  customs  and  excise  officers 
were  the  exclusive  focus  of  the  provision.  The  emphasis  in 
subsection (c) on customs and excise is not inconsistent with 
the  conclusion  that  "any  other  law  enforcement  officer" 
sweeps as broadly as its language suggests. 

Similarly,  the  rule  against  superfluities  lends  petitioner 
sparse  support.  The  construction  we  adopt  today  does  not 
necessarily  render  "any  officer  of  customs  or  excise"  super-
fluous;  Congress  may  have  simply  intended  to  remove  any 
doubt that officers of customs or excise were included in "law 
enforcement officer[s]."  See Fort Stewart Schools v.  FLRA, 
495  U. S.  641,  646  (1990)  (noting  that  "technically  unneces-
sary" examples may have been "inserted out of an abundance 
of  caution").  Moreover,  petitioner's  construction  threatens 
to  render  "any  other  law  enforcement  officer"  superfluous 
because it is not clear when, if ever, "other law enforcement

Opinion of the Court 
officer[s]" act in a customs or excise capacity.6  In any event, 
we  do  not  woodenly  apply  limiting  principles  every  time 
Congress  includes  a  specific  example  along  with  a  general 
phrase.  See  Harrison,  446  U. S.,  at  589,  n.  6  (rejecting  an 
argument  that  ejusdem  generis  must  apply  when  a  broad 

interpretation of the clause could render the specific enumer-
ations unnecessary). 

In  the  end,  we  are  unpersuaded  by  petitioner's  attempt 
to  create  ambiguity  where  the  statute's  text  and  structure 
suggest  none.  Had  Congress  intended  to  limit  $ 2680(c)'s 
reach  as  petitioner  contends,  it  easily  could  have  written 
"any  other  law  enforcement  officer  acting  in  a  customs 
or  excise  capacity."  Instead,  it  used  the  unmodified,  all-
encompassing  phrase  "any  other  law  enforcement  officer." 
Nothing  in  the  statutory  context  requires  a  narrowing  con-
struction--indeed, as we have explained, the statute is most 
consistent  and  coherent  when  "any  other  law  enforcement 

6 As an example of "other law enforcement officer[s]" acting in an excise 
or customs capacity, petitioner cites Formula One Motors, Ltd. v.  United 
States,  777  F.  2d  822,  823-824  (CA2  1985)  (holding  that  the  seizure  of  a 
vehicle  still  in  transit  from  overseas  by DEA  agents  who  searched  it  for 
drugs was "sufficiently akin  to the functions carried out by Customs offi-
cials  to  place  the  agents'  conduct  within  the  scope  of  section  2680(c)"). 
But it is not clear that the agents in that case were acting in an excise or 
customs capacity rather than in their ordinary capacity as law enforcement 
agents.  It  seems  to  us  that  DEA  agents  searching  a  car  for  drugs  are 
acting  in  their  capacity  as  officers  charged  with  enforcing  the  Nation's 
drug laws, not the customs or excise laws. 

Similarly,  the  dissent  notes  that  14  U. S. C.  $ 89(a)  authorizes  Coast 
Guard officers to enforce customs laws.  Post, at 233.  But the very next 
subsection  of  $ 89  provides  that  Coast  Guard  officers  effectively  are  cus-
toms  officers  when  they  enforce  customs  laws.  See  $ 89(b)(1)  (providing 
that  Coast  Guard  officers  "insofar  as  they  are  engaged,  pursuant  to  the 
authority  contained  in  this  section,  in  enforcing  any  law  of  the  United 
States shall . . . be deemed to be acting as agents of the particular execu-
tive  department  .  .  .  charged  with  the  administration  of  the  particular 
law").  As  a  result,  a  Coast  Guard  officer  enforcing  a  customs  law  is  a 
customs officer, not some "other law enforcement officer."

Opinion of the Court 
with  specified  procedures  and  requirements.  Petitioner  al-leged  that  in  2001  and  2002  he  directed  DeWolff  to  make 

certain changes to the investments in his individual account, but  DeWolff  never  carried  out  these  directions.  Petitioner 
claimed that this omission "depleted" his interest in the Plan by  approximately  $150,000,  and  amounted  to  a  breach  of  fi-
duciary duty under ERISA.  The complaint sought " `make-whole'  or  other  equitable  relief  as  allowed  by  [$ 502(a)(3)]," 
as  well  as  "such  other  and  further  relief  as  the  court  deems just  and  proper."  Civil  Action  No.  2:04-1747-18  (D.  S.  C.), 
p. 4, 2 Record, Doc. 1. Respondents filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, 
arguing that the complaint was essentially a claim for mone-tary  relief  that  is  not  recoverable  under  $ 502(a)(3).  Peti-
tioner  countered  that  he  "d[id]  not  wish  for  the  court  to award  him  any  money,  but  .  .  .  simply  want[ed]  the  plan  to 
properly reflect that which would be his interest in the plan, but  for  the  breach  of  fiduciary  duty."  Reply  to  Defendants 
Motion  to  Dismiss,  p.  7,  3  id.,  Doc.  17.  The  District  Court concluded,  however,  that  since  respondents  did  not  possess 
any  disputed  funds  that  rightly  belonged  to  petitioner,  he was  seeking  damages  rather  than  equitable  relief  available 
under  $ 502(a)(3).  Assuming,  arguendo,  that  respondents had breached a fiduciary duty, the District Court nonetheless 
granted their motion. On appeal petitioner argued that he had a cognizable claim 

for  relief  under  $$ 502(a)(2)  and  502(a)(3)  of  ERISA.  The Court  of  Appeals  stated  that  petitioner  had  raised  his 

$ 502(a)(2)  argument  for  the  first  time  on  appeal,  but  never-theless rejected it on the merits. 

Section 502(a)(2) provides for suits to enforce the liability-creating provisions of $ 409, concerning breaches of fiduciary 
duties  that  harm  plans.2  The  Court  of  Appeals  cited  lan-

2 Section 409(a) provides:

of  the  responsibilities,  obligations,  or  duties  imposed  upon  fiduciaries  by

guage from our opinion in Russell suggesting that these pro-
visions "protect the entire plan, rather than the rights of an 
individual  beneficiary."  473  U. S.,  at  142.  It  then  charac-
terized  the  remedy  sought  by  petitioner  as  "personal"  be-
cause  he  "desires  recovery  to  be  paid  into  his  plan  account, 
an  instrument  that  exists  specifically  for  his  benefit,"  and 
concluded: 

"We  are  therefore  skeptical  that  plaintiff 's  individual 
remedial interest can serve as a legitimate proxy for the 
plan in its entirety, as [$ 502(a)(2)] requires.  To be sure, 
the recovery plaintiff seeks could be seen as accruing to 
the  plan  in  the  narrow  sense  that  it  would  be  paid  into 
plaintiff 's  personal  plan  account,  which  is  part  of  the 
plan.  But such  a view  finds no  license in  the  statutory 
text, and threatens to undermine the careful limitations 
Congress has placed on the scope of ERISA relief."  450 
F. 3d, at 574. 

The  Court  of  Appeals  also  rejected  petitioner's  argument 
that the make-whole relief he sought was "equitable" within 
the meaning of $ 502(a)(3).  Although our grant of certiorari, 
551  U. S.  1130  (2007),  encompassed  the  $ 502(a)(3)  issue,  we 
do not address it because we conclude that the Court of Ap-
peals misread $ 502(a)(2). 

II 

As the case comes to us we must assume that respondents 
breached  fiduciary  obligations  defined  in  $ 409(a),  and  that 

this title shall be personally liable to make good to such plan any losses to 
the plan resulting from each such breach, and to restore to such plan any 
profits  of  such  fiduciary  which  have  been  made  through  use  of  assets  of 
the  plan  by  the  fiduciary,  and  shall  be  subject  to  such  other  equitable  or 
remedial  relief  as  the  court  may  deem  appropriate,  including  removal  of 
such fiduciary.  A fiduciary may also be removed for a violation of section 
411 of this Act."  88 Stat. 886, 29 U. S. C. $ 1109(a).

Opinion of the Court 
those  breaches  had  an  adverse  impact  on  the  value  of  the 
Plan  assets  in  petitioner's  individual  account.  Whether 
petitioner can prove those allegations and whether respond-
ents  may  have  valid  defenses  to  the  claim  are  matters  not 
before us.3  Although the record does not reveal the relative 
size  of  petitioner's  account,  the  legal  issue  under  $ 502(a)(2) 
is  the  same  whether  his  account  includes  1%  or  99%  of  the 
total assets in the Plan. 

As we explained in Russell, and in more detail in our later 
opinion  in  Varity  Corp.  v.  Howe,  516  U. S.  489,  508-512 
(1996),  $ 502(a) of ERISA  identifies  six  types of  civil  actions 
that may be brought by various parties.  The second, which 
is at issue in this case, authorizes the Secretary  of Labor as 
well  as  plan  participants,  beneficiaries,  and  fiduciaries,  to 
bring  actions  on  behalf  of  a  plan  to  recover  for  violations  of 
the  obligations  defined  in  $ 409(a).  The  principal  statutory 
duties  imposed  on  fiduciaries  by  that  section  "relate  to  the 
proper management, administration, and investment  of fund 
assets,"  with  an  eye  toward  ensuring  that  "the  benefits  au-
thorized by the plan" are ultimately paid to participants and 
beneficiaries.  Russell, 473 U. S., at 142; see also Varity,  516 
U. S., at 511-512 (noting that $ 409's fiduciary obligations "re-
lat[e] to the  plan's  financial  integrity" and "reflec[t] a  special 
congressional concern about plan asset management").  The 
misconduct  alleged  by  petitioner  in  this  case  falls  squarely 
within that category.4 

3 For  example,  we  do  not  decide  whether  petitioner  made  the  alleged 
investment  directions  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  specified  by 
the  Plan,  whether  he  was  required  to  exhaust  remedies  set  forth  in  the 
Plan  before  seeking  relief  in  federal  court  pursuant  to  $ 502(a)(2),  or 
whether he asserted his rights in a timely fashion. 

4 The record does not reveal whether the alleged $150,000 injury repre-

sents  a  decline  in  the  value  of  assets  that  DeWolff  should  have  sold  or 
an  increase  in  the  value  of  assets  that  DeWolff  should  have  purchased.

Opinion of the Court 
The  misconduct  alleged  in  Russell,  by  contrast,  fell  out-
side  this  category.  The  plaintiff  in  Russell  received  all  of 
the  benefits  to  which  she  was  contractually  entitled,  but 
sought  consequential  damages  arising  from  a  delay  in  the 
processing  of  her  claim.  473  U. S.,  at  136-137.  In  holding 
that  $ 502(a)(2)  does  not  provide  a  remedy  for  this  type 
of  injury,  we  stressed  that  the  text  of  $ 409(a)  characterizes 
the  relevant  fiduciary  relationship  as  one  "with  respect  to  a 
plan,"  and  repeatedly  identifies  the  "plan"  as  the  victim  of 
any fiduciary breach and the recipient of any relief.  See id., 
at  140.  The  legislative  history  likewise  revealed  that  "the 
crucible  of  congressional  concern  was  misuse  and  misman-
agement of plan assets by plan administrators."  Id., at 141, 
n.  8.  Finally,  our  review  of  ERISA  as  a  whole  confirmed 
that  $$ 502(a)(2)  and  409  protect  "the  financial  integrity  of 
the  plan,"  id.,  at  142,  n.  9,  whereas  other  provisions  specifi-
cally address claims for benefits, see id., at 143-144 (discuss-
ing  $$ 502(a)(1)(B)  and  503).  We  therefore  concluded: 

"A fair contextual reading of the statute makes it abun-
dantly  clear  that  its  draftsmen  were  primarily  con-
cerned with the possible misuse of plan assets, and with 
remedies that would protect the entire plan, rather than 
with the rights of an individual beneficiary."  Id., at 142. 

Russell's  emphasis  on  protecting  the  "entire  plan"  from 
fiduciary  misconduct  reflects  the  former  landscape  of  em-
ployee benefit plans.  That landscape has changed. 

propriate  claims  for  "lost  profits."  See  Brief  for  Respondents  12-13. 
Under  the  common  law  of  trusts,  which  informs  our  interpretation  of 
ERISA's  fiduciary  duties,  see  Varity,  516  U. S.,  at  496-497,  trustees  are 
"chargeable  with  .  .  .  any  profit  which  would  have  accrued  to  the  trust 
estate if there had been no breach of trust," including profits forgone be-
cause the  trustee  "fails  to purchase specific  property which it  is his duty 
to  purchase."  1  Restatement  (Second)  of  Trusts  $ 205,  and  Comment  i

Opinion of the Court 
Defined  contribution  plans  dominate  the  retirement  plan scene  today.

5  In  contrast,  when  ERISA  was  enacted,  and 

when  Russell  was  decided,  "the  [defined  benefit]  plan  was the  norm  of  American  pension  practice."  J.  Langbein, 

S. Stabile, & B. Wolk, Pension and Employee Benefit Law 58 
(4th  ed.  2006);  see  also  Zelinsky,  The  Defined  Contribution 
Paradigm, 114 Yale L. J. 451, 471 (2004) (discussing the "sig-
nificant  reversal  of  historic  patterns  under  which  the  tradi-
tional  defined  benefit  plan  was  the  dominant  paradigm  for 
the  provision  of  retirement  income").  Unlike  the  defined 
contribution  plan  in  this  case,  the  disability  plan  at  issue  in 
Russell did not have individual accounts; it paid a fixed bene-
fit based on a percentage of the employee's salary.  See Rus-
sell  v.  Massachusetts  Mut.  Life  Ins.  Co.,  722  F.  2d  482,  486 
(CA9 1983). 

The "entire plan" language in Russell speaks to the impact 
of  $ 409  on  plans  that  pay  defined  benefits.  Misconduct  by 
the administrators of a defined benefit plan will not affect an 
individual's entitlement to a defined benefit unless it creates 
or  enhances  the  risk  of  default  by  the  entire  plan.  It  was 
that  default risk  that prompted  Congress  to  require defined 
benefit  plans  (but  not  defined  contribution  plans)  to  satisfy 
complex  minimum  funding  requirements,  and  to  make  pre-
mium  payments  to  the  Pension  Benefit  Guaranty  Corpora-
tion for plan  termination  insurance.  See Zelinsky, 114  Yale 
L. J., at 475-478. 

For defined contribution plans, however,  fiduciary miscon-
duct  need  not  threaten  the  solvency  of  the  entire  plan  to

Opinion of the Court 
reduce  benefits  below  the  amount  that  participants  would 
otherwise  receive.  Whether  a  fiduciary  breach  diminishes 
plan  assets  payable  to  all  participants  and  beneficiaries,  or 
only to persons tied to particular individual accounts, it  cre-
ates the kind of harms that concerned the draftsmen of $ 409. 
Consequently, our references to the "entire plan" in Russell, 
which accurately reflect the operation of $ 409 in the defined 
benefit context, are beside the point in the defined contribu-
tion context. 

Other  sections  of  ERISA  confirm  that  the  "entire  plan" 
language  from  Russell,  which  appears  nowhere  in  $ 409  or 

$ 502(a)(2),  does  not  apply  to  defined  contribution  plans. 
Most  significant  is  $ 404(c),  which  exempts  fiduciaries  from 
liability for losses caused by participants' exercise of control 
over  assets  in  their  individual  accounts.  See  also  29  CFR 

$ 2550.404c-1  (2007).  This  provision  would  serve  no  real 
purpose  if,  as  respondents  argue,  fiduciaries  never  had  any 
liability for losses in an individual account. 

We  therefore  hold  that  although  $ 502(a)(2)  does  not  pro-
vide a remedy for individual injuries distinct from plan inju-
ries,  that  provision  does  authorize  recovery  for  fiduciary 
breaches  that  impair  the  value  of  plan  assets  in  a  partici-
pant's individual account.  Accordingly, the judgment of the 
Court  of  Appeals  is  vacated,  and  the  case  is  remanded  for 
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.6 

It is so ordered. 
6 After our grant of certiorari respondents filed a motion to dismiss the 
writ,  contending  that  the  case  is  moot  because  petitioner  is  no  longer  a 
participant  in  the  Plan.  While  his  withdrawal  of  funds  from  the  Plan 
may have relevance to the proceedings on remand, we denied their motion 
because the case is not moot.  A plan "participant," as defined by $ 3(7) of 
ERISA, 29 U. S. C. $ 1002(7), may include a former employee with a color-
able claim for benefits.  See, e. g., Harzewski v.  Guidant Corp.,  489 F. 3d 
799 (CA7 2007).

In  1996,  a  Minnesota  jury  found  petitioner  Stephen  Dan-forth  guilty  of  first-degree  criminal  sexual  conduct  with  a 

minor.  See  Minn.  Stat.  $ 609.342,  subd.  1(a)  (1994).  The  6-year-old victim did  not  testify at trial,  but the  jury saw and 
heard  a  videotaped  interview  of  the  child.  On  appeal  from his conviction, Danforth argued that the tape's admission vi-
olated the Sixth Amendment's guarantee that "[i]n all crimi-nal prosecutions,  the  accused  shall  enjoy  the  right  . .  . to be 
confronted  with  the  witnesses  against  him."  Applying  the rule of admissibility set forth in Ohio

Our  decision  today  must  also  be  understood  against  the backdrop  of  our  somewhat  confused  and  confusing  "retroac-

tivity"  cases  decided  in  the  years  between  1965  and  1987. Indeed, we note at the outset that the very word "retroactiv-
ity"  is  misleading  because  it  speaks  in  temporal  terms. "Retroactivity"  suggests  that  when  we  declare  that  a  new 
constitutional rule of criminal procedure is "nonretroactive," we are implying that  the  right at issue was not in  existence 
prior  to  the  date  the  "new  rule"  was  announced.  But  this is incorrect.  As we  have  already explained,  the  source of a 
"new  rule"  is  the  Constitution  itself,  not  any  judicial  power to  create  new  rules  of  law.  Accordingly,  the  underlying 
right  necessarily pre-exists our articulation of the  new rule. What we are actually determining when we assess the "ret-
roactivity" of a new rule is not the temporal scope of a newly announced  right,  but  whether  a  violation  of  the  right  that 
occurred prior to the announcement of the new rule will enti-tle a criminal defendant to the relief sought.

Originally,  criminal  defendants  whose  convictions  were final  were  entitled  to  federal  habeas  relief  only  if  the  court 

that  rendered  the  judgment  under  which  they  were  in  cus-tody  lacked  jurisdiction  to  do  so.

also  illustrate  that  the  rule  was  meant  to  apply  only  to  fed-eral  courts  considering  habeas  corpus  petitions  challenging 
state-court  criminal  convictions.  Justice  O'Connor  made numerous references to the "Great Writ" and the "writ," and 
expressly  stated  that  "[t]he  relevant  frame  of  reference"  for determining  the  appropriate  retroactivity rule  is  defined  by 
"the  purposes  for  which  the  writ  of  habeas  corpus  is  made available."  489  U. S., at 306  (plurality  opinion).  Moreover,

Opinion of the Court 
After  completing  its  review,  the  FDA  may  grant  or  deny premarket  approval.  $ 360e(d).  It  may  also  condition  ap-

proval  on  adherence  to  performance  standards,  21  CFR $ 861.1(b)(3),  restrictions  upon  sale  or  distribution,  or  com-
pliance  with  other  requirements,  $ 814.82.  The  agency  is also  free  to  impose  device-specific  restrictions  by  regula-
tion.  $ 360j(e)(1). If  the  FDA  is  unable  to  approve  a  new  device  in  its  pro-
posed  form,  it  may  send  an  "approvable  letter"  indicating 
that the device could be approved if the applicant submitted specified  information  or  agreed  to  certain  conditions  or  re-

strictions.  21  CFR  $ 814.44(e).  Alternatively,  the  agency 
may  send  a  "not  approvable"  letter,  listing  the  grounds 
that  justify  denial  and,  where  practical,  measures  that  the 
applicant  could  undertake  to  make  the  device  approvable. 

$ 814.44(f). 

Once a device has received premarket approval, the MDA 
forbids the manufacturer to make, without FDA permission, 
changes in design specifications, manufacturing processes, la-
beling,  or  any  other  attribute,  that  would  affect  safety  or 
effectiveness.  $ 360e(d)(6)(A)(i).  If  the  applicant  wishes to 
make  such  a  change,  it  must  submit,  and  the  FDA  must  ap-
prove,  an  application  for  supplemental  premarket  approval, 
to  be  evaluated  under  largely  the  same  criteria  as  an  initial 
application.  $ 360e(d)(6); 21 CFR $ 814.39(c). 

After  premarket  approval,  the  devices  are  subject  to  re-
porting requirements.  $ 360i.  These include the obligation 
to inform the FDA of new clinical investigations or scientific 
studies  concerning  the  device  which  the  applicant  knows  of 
or  reasonably  should  know  of,  21  CFR  $ 814.84(b)(2),  and  to 
report incidents in which the device may have caused or con-
tributed  to  death  or  serious  injury,  or  malfunctioned  in  a 
manner that would likely cause or contribute to death or se-
rious  injury  if  it  recurred,  $ 803.50(a).  The  FDA  has  the 
power  to  withdraw  premarket  approval  based  on  newly  re-
ported  data  or  existing  information  and  must  withdraw  ap-

islation excluding  common-law  duties from  the  scope of pre-
emption  would  make  little  sense.  State  tort  law  that  re-
quires a manufacturer's catheters to be safer, but hence less 
effective, than the model the FDA has approved disrupts the 
federal scheme no less than state regulatory law to the same 
effect.  Indeed,  one  would  think  that  tort  law,  applied  by 
juries  under  a  negligence  or  strict-liability  standard,  is  less 
deserving  of  preservation.  A  state  statute,  or  a  regulation 
adopted by a state agency, could at least be expected to apply 
cost-benefit analysis similar to that applied by the experts at 
the  FDA:  How  many  more  lives  will  be  saved  by  a  device 
which, along with its greater effectiveness, brings a  greater 
risk  of harm?  A  jury, on the other hand, sees  only the  cost 
of  a  more  dangerous  design,  and  is  not  concerned  with  its 
benefits; the patients who reaped those benefits are not rep-
resented  in  court.  As  Justice

as well as federal courts" and "foreclose[s] state legislative attempts to 
undercut  the  enforceability  of  arbitration  agreements."  Id.,  at  16. 
The  FAA's  displacement  of  conflicting  state  law  has  been  repeatedly 
reaffirmed.  See,  e. g.,  Buckeye,  546  U. S.,  at  445-446;  Allied-Bruce 
Terminix  Cos.  v.  Dobson,  513  U. S.  265,  272.  A  recurring  question 
under $ 2 is who should decide whether "grounds . . .  exist at law or in 
equity" to invalidate an arbitration agreement.  In Prima Paint Corp. 
v.  Flood  &  Conklin  Mfg.  Co.,  388  U. S.  395,  403-404,  which  originated 
in  federal  court,  this  Court  held  that  attacks  on  an  entire  contract's 
validity,  as  distinct  from  attacks  on  the  arbitration  clause  alone,  are 
within the arbitrator's ken.  Buckeye held that the same rule applies in 
state court.  See 546 U. S., at 446. 

Buckeye  largely,  if  not  entirely,  resolves  the  present  dispute.  The 
contract at issue clearly "evidenc[ed] a transaction involving commerce" 
under  $ 2,  and  Ferrer  has  never  disputed  that  the  contract's  written 
arbitration provision falls within $ 2's purview.  Ferrer sought invalida-
tion  of  the  contract  as  a  whole.  He  made  no  discrete challenge  to  the 
validity of the arbitration clause, and thus sought to override that clause 
on  a  ground  Buckeye  requires  the  arbitrator  to  decide  in  the  first  in-
stance.  Pp. 352-354. 

(c)  Ferrer  attempts  to  distinguish  Buckeye,  urging  that  the  TAA 
merely  requires  exhaustion  of  administrative  remedies  before  the  par-
ties  proceed to  arbitration.  This argument  is  unconvincing.  Pp.  354- 

359. 

(1)  Procedural prescriptions of the TAA conflict with the FAA's dis-
pute  resolution  regime  in  two  basic  respects:  (1)  One  TAA  provision 
grants the Labor Commissioner exclusive jurisdiction to decide an issue 
that  the  parties  agreed  to  arbitrate,  see  Buckeye,  546  U. S.,  at  446; 
(2)  another  imposes  prerequisites  to  enforcement  of  an  arbitration 
agreement  that  are  not  applicable  to  contracts  generally,  see  Doctor's 
Associates, Inc. v.  Casarotto, 517 U. S. 681, 687.  Pp. 354-356. 

(2)  Ferrer  contends that the TAA  is compatible  with the FAA  be-
cause  the  TAA  provision  vesting  exclusive  jurisdiction  in  the  Labor 
Commissioner merely postpones arbitration.  That position is contrary 
to  the one Ferrer took in  the California courts and does  not withstand 
examination.  Arbitration, if it ever occurred following the Labor Com-
missioner's  decision,  would  likely  be  long  delayed,  in  contravention  of 
Congress'  intent  "to  move  the  parties  to  an  arbitrable  dispute  out  of 
court and into arbitration as quickly and easily as possible."  Moses H. 
Cone  Memorial  Hospital  v.  Mercury  Constr.  Corp.,  460  U. S.  1,  22. 
Pp. 356-358. 

(3)  Ferrer contends that the conflict between the arbitration clause 
and  the  TAA  should  be  overlooked  because  Labor  Commissioner  pro-

ceedings are administrative rather than judicial.  The Court rejected a 
similar argument in Gilmer v.  Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 
20, 28-29.  Pp. 358-359. 

(d)  Ferrer's  reliance  on  Volt  Information  Sciences,  Inc.  v.  Board  of 
Trustees  of  Leland  Stanford  Junior  Univ.,  489  U. S.  468,  is  misplaced 
for two reasons.  First, arbitration was stayed in Volt to accommodate 
litigation involving third parties who were strangers  to the  arbitration 
agreement.  Because  the  contract  at  issue  in  Volt did  not  address  the 
order  of proceedings  and included a choice-of-law clause adopting Cali-
fornia law, the Volt Court recognized as the gap filler a California stat-
ute authorizing the state court to stay either third-party court proceed-
ings  or  arbitration  proceedings  to  avoid  the  possibility  of  conflicting 
rulings  on  a  common  issue.  Here,  in  contrast,  the  arbitration  clause 
speaks to the matter in controversy; both parties are bound by the arbi-
tration  agreement;  the  question  of  Preston's  status  as  a  talent  agent 
relates  to  the  validity  or  legality  of  the  contract;  there  is  no  risk  that 
related  litigation  will  yield  conflicting  rulings  on  common  issues;  and 
there  is  no  other  procedural  void  for  the  choice-of-law  clause  to  fill. 
Second, the Court is guided by its decision in Mastrobuono v.  Shearson 
Lehman  Hutton,  Inc.,  514  U. S.  52.  Although  the  Volt  contract  pro-
vided  for  arbitration  in  accordance  with  AAA  rules,  489  U. S.,  at  470, 
n.  1,  Volt  never  argued  that  incorporation  of  those  rules  by  reference 
trumped  the  contract's  choice-of-law  clause,  so  this  Court  never  ad-
dressed the  import  of  such  incorporation.  In  Mastrobuono,  the  Court 
reached that open question, declaring that the "best way to harmonize" 
a  New  York  choice-of-law  clause  and  a  clause  providing  for  arbitration 
in accordance with privately promulgated arbitration rules was to read 
the choice-of-law clause "to encompass substantive principles that New 
York  courts  would  apply,  but  not  to  include  [New  York's]  special  rules 
limiting  [arbitrators']  authority."  514  U. S.,  at  63-64.  Similarly  here, 
the  "best  way  to  harmonize"  the  Ferrer-Preston  contract's  adoption  of 
the AAA rules and its selection of California law is to read the latter to 
encompass  prescriptions  governing  the  parties'  substantive  rights  and 
obligations,  but  not  the  State's  "special  rules  limiting  [arbitrators']  au-
thority."  Ibid.  Pp. 360-363.

350  PRESTON  v.  FERRER 

Opinion of the Court 
whether judicial or administrative, are superseded  by the FAA. 

I 
This  case  concerns  a  contract  between  respondent  Alex 
E.  Ferrer,  a  former  Florida  trial  court  judge  who  currently appears  as  "Judge  Alex"  on  a  Fox  television  network  pro-

gram,  and  petitioner  Arnold  M.  Preston,  a  California  attor-ney  who  renders  services  to  persons  in  the  entertainment 
industry.  Seeking  fees  allegedly  due  under  the  contract, Preston  invoked  the  parties'  agreement  to  arbitrate  "any 
dispute . . .  relating  to  the  terms  of  [the  contract]  or  the 
breach, validity, or legality thereof . . .  in  accordance with the rules  [of  the  American  Arbitration  Association]."  App.  18. 

Preston's  demand  for  arbitration,  made  in  June  2005,  was countered a month later by Ferrer's petition to the California 
Labor  Commissioner  charging  that  the  contract  was  invalid and unenforceable  under the  California Talent Agencies Act 
(TAA),  Cal.  Lab.  Code  Ann.  $ 1700  et  seq.  (West  2003  and Supp. 2008).  Ferrer asserted that Preston acted as a talent 
agent  without  the  license  required  by  the  TAA,  and  that Preston's  unlicensed  status  rendered  the  entire  contract 
void.1 The  Labor  Commissioner's  hearing  officer,  in  November 
2005,  determined  that  Ferrer  had  stated  a  "colorable  basis 
for  exercise  of  the  Labor  Commissioner's  jurisdiction." App. 33.  The officer denied Ferrer's motion to stay the arbi-

tration,  however,  on  the  ground  that  the  Labor  Commis-sioner  lacked  authority  to  order  such  relief.  Ferrer  then 
filed suit in the Los Angeles Superior Court, seeking a decla-ration  that  the  controversy  between  the  parties  "arising 
from  the  [c]ontract,  including  in  particular  the  issue  of  the validity of the [c]ontract, is not subject to arbitration." 

Id., 

1 The TAA uses the term "talent agency" to describe both corporations 
and individual  talent agents.  We use the terms "talent agent"  and "tal-
ent agency" interchangeably.

Opinion of the Court 
at  29.  As  interim  relief,  Ferrer  sought  an  injunction  re-
straining  Preston  from  proceeding  before  the  arbitrator. 
Preston responded by moving to compel arbitration. 

In  December  2005,  the  Superior  Court  denied  Preston's 
motion to compel arbitration and enjoined Preston from pro-
ceeding  before  the  arbitrator  "unless  and  until  the  Labor 
Commissioner  determines  that  .  .  .  she  is  without  juris-
diction  over  the  disputes  between  Preston  and  Ferrer." 
No.  BC342454  (Dec.  7,  2005),  App.  C  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  18a, 
26a-27a.  During the pendency of Preston's appeal from the 
Superior Court's decision, this Court reaffirmed, in Buckeye, 
that  challenges  to  the  validity  of  a  contract  providing  for 
arbitration  ordinarily  "should . . . be  considered  by  an  arbi-
trator, not a court."  546 U. S., at 446. 

In  a  2-to-1 decision  issued  in  November 2006,  the  Califor-
nia Court of Appeal affirmed the Superior Court's judgment. 
The  appeals  court  held  that  the  relevant  provision  of  the 
TAA,  Cal.  Lab.  Code  Ann.  $ 1700.44(a)  (West  2003),  vests 
"exclusive  original  jurisdiction"  over  the  dispute  in  the 
Labor  Commissioner.  145  Cal.  App.  4th  440,  447,  51  Cal. 
Rptr.  3d  628,  634.  Buckeye  is  "inapposite,"  the  court  said, 
because  that  case  "did  not  involve  an  administrative  agency 
with exclusive  jurisdiction over  a  disputed  issue."  145  Cal. 
App.  4th,  at  447,  51  Cal.  Rptr.  3d,  at  634.  The  dissenting 
judge,  in  contrast,  viewed  Buckeye  as  controlling;  she  rea-
soned  that  the  FAA  called  for  immediate  recognition  and 
enforcement  of  the  parties'  agreement  to  arbitrate  and  af-
forded no basis for distinguishing prior resort to a  state ad-
ministrative  agency  from  prior  resort to  a  state  court.  145 
Cal. App. 4th, at 450-451, 51 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 636-637 (Vogel, 
J., dissenting). 

The  California  Supreme  Court  denied  Preston's  petition 
for  review.  No.  S149190  (Feb.  14,  2007),  2007  Cal.  LEXIS

Opinion of the Court 
initial  adjudicatory  authority  in  an  administrative  agency. 551 U. S. 1190 (2007). 

II 
An  easily  stated  question  underlies  this  controversy. Ferrer claims that Preston was a talent agent who operated 

without  a  license  in  violation  of  the  TAA.  Accordingly,  he urges,  the  contract  between  the  parties,  purportedly  for 
"personal  management,"  is  void,  and  Preston  is  entitled  to no compensation  for  any  services he  rendered.  Preston, on 
the  other  hand,  maintains  that  he  acted  as  a  personal  man-ager, not as a talent agent, hence his contract with Ferrer is 
not  governed  by  the  TAA  and  is both  lawful and fully  bind-ing on the parties. 

Because  the  contract  between  Ferrer  and  Preston  pro-vides  that  "any  dispute . . .  relating  to  the . . . validity,  or 
legality,"  of  the  agreement  "shall  be  submitted  to  arbitra-tion,"  App.  18,  Preston  urges  that  Ferrer  must  litigate  "his 
TAA defense in the arbitral forum," Reply Brief 31.  Ferrer insists,  however,  that  the  "personal  manager"  or  "talent 
agent"  inquiry  falls,  under  California  law,  within  the  exclu-sive  original  jurisdiction  of  the  Labor  Commissioner,  and 
that the FAA does not displace the Commissioner's primary jurisdiction.  Brief for Respondent 14, 30, 40-44. 

The  dispositive  issue,  then,  contrary  to  Ferrer's  sugges-tion,  is  not  whether  the  FAA  preempts  the  TAA  wholesale. 
See id., at 44-48.  The FAA plainly has no such destructive 
aim  or  effect.  Instead,  the  question  is  simply  who  decides whether  Preston  acted  as  personal  manager  or  as  talent 

agent.  III 

Section 2 of the FAA states: 

"A written provision  in any . . . contract evidencing a transaction  involving  commerce  to  settle  by  arbitration 

a  controversy  thereafter  arising  out  of  such  contract  or 
transaction  .  .  .  shall  be  valid,  irrevocable,  and  enforce-

Section  2  "declare[s]  a  national  policy  favoring  arbitration" of  claims  that  parties  contract  to  settle  in  that  manner. 
Southland  Corp.,  465  U. S.,  at  10.  That  national  policy,  we held  in  Southland,  "appli[es]  in  state  as  well  as  federal 
courts" and "foreclose[s] state  legislative attempts  to under-cut the enforceability of arbitration agreements."  Id., at 16. 
The  FAA's  displacement  of  conflicting  state  law  is  "now well-established," 

Allied-Bruce  Terminix  Cos.  v.  Dobson, 513 U. S. 265, 272 (1995), and has been repeatedly reaffirmed, 

see, e. g., Buckeye, 546 U. S., at 445-446; Doctor's Associates, Inc.  v.  Casarotto,  517  U. S.  681,  684-685  (1996);  Perry  v. 
Thomas, 482 U. S. 483, 489 (1987).2 A  recurring  question  under  $ 2  is  who  should  decide 
whether "grounds . . . exist at law or in equity" to invalidate an arbitration agreement.  In Prima Paint Corp. v.  Flood & 
Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U. S. 395, 403-404 (1967), we held that attacks on the validity of an entire contract, as distinct from 
attacks  aimed  at  the  arbitration  clause,  are  within  the  arbi-trator's ken. 

The  litigation  in  Prima  Paint  originated  in  federal  court, but the same rule, we held in Buckeye, applies in state court. 
546 U. S., at 447-448.  The plaintiffs in Buckeye alleged that the  contracts  they  signed,  which  contained  arbitration 
clauses, were illegal under state law and void ab initio.  Id., at  443.  Relying  on 

Southland,  we  held  that  the  plaintiffs' challenge was within the province of the arbitrator to decide. 

See 546 U. S., at 446. 

2 Although Ferrer urges us to overrule Southland, he relies on the same 
arguments  we  considered  and  rejected  in  Allied-Bruce  Terminix  Cos.  v. 
Dobson, 513 U. S. 265 (1995).  Compare Brief for Respondent 55-59 with

hering  to  precedent,  we  do  not  take  up  Ferrer's  invitation  to  overrule 
Southland.

354  PRESTON  v.  FERRER 

Opinion of the Court 
Buckeye largely, if not entirely, resolves the dispute before us.  The  contract  between  Preston  and  Ferrer  clearly  "evi-

denc[ed]  a  transaction  involving  commerce,"  9  U. S. C.  $ 2, and  Ferrer  has  never  disputed  that  the  written  arbitration 
provision  in  the  contract  falls  within  the  purview  of  $ 2. Moreover,  Ferrer  sought  invalidation  of  the  contract  as  a 
whole.  In the proceedings below, he made no discrete chal-lenge to  the  validity  of the  arbitration clause.  See  145  Cal. 
App.  4th,  at  449,  51  Cal.  Rptr.  3d,  at  635  (Vogel,  J.,  dissent-ing).

3  Ferrer thus urged the Labor Commissioner and Cali-

fornia  courts to override the  contract's arbitration  clause on a  ground  that 

Buckeye  requires  the  arbitrator  to  decide  in the first instance. 

IV 
Ferrer  attempts  to  distinguish  Buckeye  by  arguing  that the TAA merely requires exhaustion of administrative reme-

dies  before  the  parties  proceed  to  arbitration.  We  reject that argument. 

A 
The TAA regulates talent agents and talent agency agree-ments.  "Talent agency" is defined, with exceptions not rele-

vant  here,  as  "a  person  or  corporation  who  engages  in  the occupation of procuring, offering, promising, or attempting to 
procure employment or engagements for an artist or artists." Cal.  Lab.  Code Ann. $ 1700.4(a)  (West  2003).  The definition 

3 Ferrer's petition to the Labor Commissioner sought a declaration that 
the contract "is void under the [TAA]."  App. 23.  His complaint in Supe-
rior Court seeking to enjoin arbitration asserted: "[T]he [c]ontract is void 
by  reason  of  [Preston's]  attempt  to  procure  employment  for  [Ferrer]  in 
violation  of  the  [TAA],"  and  "the  [c]ontract's  arbitration  clause  does  not 
vest authority in an arbitrator to determine whether the contract is void." 
Id., at 27.  His brief in the appeals court stated: "Ferrer does not contend 
that the arbitration clause in the [c]ontract was procured by fraud.  Fer-
rer contends  that Preston unlawfully  acted  as an unlicensed  talent agent 
and  hence  cannot  enforce  the  [c]ontract."  Brief  for  Respondent  in 
No. B188997, p. 18.

"does  not  cover  other  services  for  which  artists  often  con-tract, such as personal and career management (i. e., advice, 

direction, coordination, and oversight with respect to an art-ist's  career  or  personal  or  financial  affairs)."  Styne  v.  Ste-
vens,  26  Cal.  4th  42,  51,  26  P.  3d  343,  349  (2001)  (emphasis deleted).  The  TAA  requires  talent  agents  to  procure  a  li-
cense from the Labor Commissioner.  $ 1700.5.  "In further-ance  of  the  [TAA's]  protective  aims,  an  unlicensed  person's 
contract  with  an  artist  to  provide  the  services  of  a  talent agency is illegal and void." 

Ibid.4 Section 1700.44(a) of the TAA states: 

"In  cases  of  controversy  arising  under  this  chapter,  the parties involved shall refer the matters in dispute to the 
Labor Commissioner, who shall hear and determine the same, subject to an appeal within 10 days after determi-
nation,  to  the  superior  court  where  the  same  shall  be heard de novo." 

Absent  a  notice  of  appeal  filed  within  ten  days,  the  Labor Commissioner's  determination  becomes  final  and  binding  on 
the  parties.  REO  Broadcasting  Consultants  v.  Martin,  69 Cal. App. 4th 489, 495, 81 Cal. Rptr. 2d 639, 642-643 (1999).

5 

The  TAA  permits  arbitration  in  lieu  of  proceeding  before the Labor Commissioner if an arbitration provision "in a con-

tract between a talent agency and [an artist]" both "provides for reasonable notice to the Labor Commissioner of the time 
and  place  of  all  arbitration  hearings"  and  gives  the  Com-

4 Courts  "may  void  the  entire  contract"  where  talent  agency  services 
regulated  by  the  TAA  are  "inseparable  from  [unregulated]  managerial 
services."  Marathon  Entertainment,  Inc.  v.  Blasi,  42  Cal.  4th  974,  998, 
174 P. 3d 741, 744 (2008).  If the contractual terms are severable, however, 
"an  isolated  instance"  of  unlicensed  conduct  "does  not  automatically  bar 
recovery  for  services  that  could  lawfully  be  provided  without  a  license." 
Ibid. 

5 To appeal the Labor Commissioner's decision, an aggrieved party must 

post a bond of at least $1,000 and up to twice the amount of any judgment 
approved by the Commissioner.  $ 1700.44(a).

Opinion of the Court 
missioner  "the  right  to  attend  all  arbitration  hearings." $ 1700.45.  This  prescription  demonstrates  that  there  is  no 

inherent  conflict  between  the  TAA  and  arbitration  as  a  dis-pute  resolution  mechanism.  But  $ 1700.45  was  of  no  utility 
to Preston.  He has consistently maintained that he is not a talent  agent  as  that  term  is defined  in  $ 1700.4(a),  but is,  in-
stead,  a  personal  manager  not  subject  to  the  TAA's  regula-tory  regime.  145  Cal.  App.  4th,  at  444,  51  Cal.  Rptr.  3d,  at 
631.  To invoke $ 1700.45, Preston would have been required to  concede  a  point  fatal  to  his  claim  for  compensation--

i. e., that  he  is  a  talent  agent,  albeit  an  unlicensed  one--and  to 

have  drafted  his  contract  in  compliance  with  a  statute  that he maintains is inapplicable. 

Procedural prescriptions of the TAA thus conflict with the FAA's dispute resolution regime in two basic respects: First, 
the TAA, in $ 1700.44(a), grants the Labor Commissioner ex-clusive jurisdiction to decide an issue that the parties agreed 
to arbitrate, see Buckeye, 546 U. S., at 446; second, the TAA, in $ 1700.45, imposes prerequisites to enforcement of an arbi-
tration agreement that are not applicable to contracts gener-ally, see 

Doctor's Associates, Inc., 517 U. S., at 687. 

B 
Ferrer  contends  that  the  TAA  is  nevertheless  compatible with the FAA because $ 1700.44(a) merely postpones arbitra-

tion  until  after  the  Labor  Commissioner  has  exercised  her primary  jurisdiction.  Brief  for  Respondent  14,  40.  The 
party  that  loses  before  the  Labor  Commissioner  may  file for 

de novo review in Superior Court.  See $ 1700.44(a).  At that point, Ferrer asserts, either party could move to compel 

arbitration  under  Cal.  Civ.  Proc.  Code  Ann.  $ 1281.2  (West 
2007), and thereby obtain an arbitrator's determination prior to judicial review.  See Brief for Respondent 13. 

That  is  not  the  position  Ferrer  took  in  the  California 
courts.  In  his  complaint,  he  urged  the  Superior  Court  to 

552US2 Unit: $U18 [01-09-12 20:14:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court 
declare that "the [c]ontract, including in particular the issue of the validity of the [c]ontract, is not subject to arbitration," 

and he sought an injunction stopping arbitration "unless and until,  if  ever,  the  Labor  Commissioner  determines  that  he/ 
she  has  no  jurisdiction  over  the  parties'  dispute."  App.  29 (emphasis  added).  Ferrer  also  told  the  Superior  Court: 
"[I]f . . . the  Commissioner  rules  that  the  [c]ontract  is  void, Preston  may  appeal  that  ruling  and  have  a  hearing  de  novo 
before  this  Court."  Appellant's  App.  in  No.  B188997  (Cal. App.), p. 157, n. 1 (emphasis added). 

Nor  does  Ferrer's  current  argument--that  $ 1700.44(a) merely postpones arbitration--withstand examination. 
Section  1700.44(a)  provides  for  de  novo  review  in  Superior Court,  not  elsewhere.

6  Arbitration,  if  it  ever  occurred  fol-

lowing  the  Labor  Commissioner's  decision,  would  likely  be long  delayed,  in  contravention  of  Congress'  intent  "to  move 

the parties to an arbitrable dispute out of court and into arbi-tration  as  quickly  and  easily  as  possible."  Moses  H.  Cone 
Memorial Hospital v.  Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 22 (1983).  If  Ferrer  prevailed  in  the  California  courts,  more-
over,  he  would  no  doubt  argue  that  judicial  findings  of  fact and  conclusions  of  law,  made  after  a  full  and  fair  de  novo 
hearing in court, are binding on the parties and preclude the arbitrator from making any contrary rulings. 

A  prime  objective  of  an  agreement  to  arbitrate  is  to achieve  "streamlined  proceedings  and  expeditious  results." 
Mitsubishi  Motors  Corp.  v.  Soler  Chrysler-Plymouth,  Inc., 

6 From Superior Court an appeal lies in the Court of Appeal.  Cal. Civ. 
Proc. Code Ann. $ 904.1(a) (West 2007); Cal. Rule of Court 8.100(a) (Appel-
late  Rules)  (West  2007  rev.  ed.).  Thereafter,  the  losing  party  may  seek 
review  in  the  California  Supreme  Court,  Rule  8.500(a)(1)  (Appellate 
Rules), perhaps followed by a petition for a writ of certiorari in this Court, 
28  U. S. C.  $ 1257.  Ferrer  has  not  identified  a  single  case  holding  that 
California  law  permits  interruption  of  this  chain  of  appeals  to  allow  the 
arbitrator to review the Labor  Commissioner's decision.  See Tr. of Oral 
Arg. 35.

358  PRESTON  v.  FERRER 

Opinion of the Court 
473  U. S.  614,  633  (1985).  See  also  Allied-Bruce  Terminix 
Cos., 513 U. S., at 278; Southland Corp., 465 U. S., at 7.  That 
objective  would  be  frustrated  even  if  Preston  could  compel 
arbitration  in  lieu  of  de  novo  Superior  Court  review.  Re-
quiring  initial  reference  of  the  parties'  dispute  to  the  Labor 
Commissioner  would,  at  the  least,  hinder  speedy  resolution 
of the controversy. 

Ferrer  asks  us  to  overlook  the  apparent  conflict  between 
the  arbitration  clause  and  $ 1700.44(a)  because  proceedings 
before  the  Labor  Commissioner  are  administrative  rather 
than  judicial.  Brief  for  Respondent  40-48.  Allowing  par-
ties  to  proceed  directly  to  arbitration,  Ferrer  contends, 
would  undermine  the  Labor  Commissioner's  ability  to  stay 
informed  of  potentially  illegal  activity,  id.,  at  43,  and  would 
deprive artists protected by the TAA of the Labor Commis-
sioner's expertise, id., at 41-43. 

In  Gilmer  v.  Interstate/Johnson  Lane  Corp.,  500  U. S.  20 
(1991),  we  considered  and  rejected  a  similar  argument, 
namely,  that  arbitration  of  age  discrimination  claims  would 
undermine  the  role  of  the  Equal  Employment  Opportunity 
Commission  (EEOC)  in  enforcing  federal  law.  The  "mere 
involvement of an  administrative agency in  the  enforcement 
of  a  statute,"  we  held,  does  not  limit  private  parties'  ob-
ligation  to  comply  with  their  arbitration  agreements.  Id., 
at 28-29. 

Ferrer  points  to  our  holding  in  EEOC  v.  Waffle  House, 
Inc., 534 U. S. 279, 293-294 (2002), that an arbitration agree-

servation in Gilmer that individuals who agreed to arbitrate 
their  discrimination  claims  would  "still  be  free  to  file  a 
charge with the EEOC."  500 U. S., at 28.  Consistent with 
these  decisions,  Ferrer  argues,  the  arbitration  clause  in  his 
contract  with  Preston  leaves  undisturbed  the  Labor  Com-

missioner's independent authority to enforce the TAA.  See Brief  for  Respondent  44-48.  And  so  it  may.

7  But  in  pro-

ceedings  under  $ 1700.44(a),  the  Labor  Commissioner  func-tions not as an advocate advancing a cause before a tribunal 

authorized  to  find  the  facts  and  apply  the  law;  instead,  the Commissioner serves  as impartial arbiter.  That role is just 
what  the  FAA-governed  agreement  between  Ferrer  and 
Preston  reserves  for  the  arbitrator.  In  contrast,  in  Waffle 
House  and in the Gilmer aside Ferrer quotes, the Court ad-
dressed the role of an agency, not as adjudicator but as prose-cutor,  pursuing  an  enforcement  action  in  its  own  name  or 

reviewing  a  discrimination  charge  to  determine  whether  to initiate judicial proceedings. 

Finally, it bears repeating that Preston's petition presents precisely and only a question concerning the forum in which 
the  parties'  dispute  will be  heard.  See supra,  at 352.  "By agreeing  to  arbitrate  a  statutory  claim,  a  party  does  not 
forgo  the  substantive  rights  afforded  by  the  statute;  it  only 
submits to their resolution in an arbitral . . . forum."   Mitsu-
bishi Motors Corp., 473 U. S., at 628.  So here, Ferrer relin-
quishes  no  substantive  rights  the  TAA  or  other  California law  may  accord  him.  But  under  the  contract  he  signed,  he 

cannot escape resolution of those rights in an arbitral forum. In sum, we disapprove the distinction between judicial and 
administrative proceedings drawn by Ferrer and adopted by the appeals court.  When parties agree to arbitrate all ques-
tions  arising  under  a  contract,  the  FAA  supersedes  state 
laws lodging primary jurisdiction in another forum, whether 
judicial or administrative. 

7 Enforcement of the parties' arbitration agreement in this case does not 
displace any independent authority the Labor Commissioner may have to 
investigate and rectify  violations of the TAA.  See Brief for Respondent 
47 ("[T]he Commissioner has independent investigatory authority and may 
receive  information  concerning  alleged  violations  of  the  TAA  from  any 
source." (citation omitted)).  See also Tr. of Oral Arg. 13-14.

360  PRESTON  v.  FERRER 

Opinion of the Court 

V 
Ferrer's final attempt to distinguish Buckeye relies on Volt 
Information  Sciences,  Inc.  v.  Board  of  Trustees  of  Leland Stanford  Junior  Univ.,  489  U. S.  468  (1989).  Volt  involved 

a California statute dealing with cases in which "[a] party to [an] arbitration agreement is also a party to a pending court 
action . . . [involving]  a  third  party  [not  bound  by  the  arbi-tration  agreement],  arising  out  of  the  same  transaction  or 
series  of  related  transactions."  Cal.  Civ.  Proc.  Code  Ann. $ 1281.2(c) (West 2007).  To avoid the "possibility of conflict-
ing  rulings  on  a  common  issue  of  law  or  fact,"  the  statute gives  the  Superior  Court  authority, 

inter  alia,  to  stay  the court proceeding "pending the outcome of the arbitration" or 

to  stay  the  arbitration  "pending  the  outcome  of  the  court action."  Ibid. 

Volt  Information  Sciences  and  Stanford  University  were parties  to  a  construction  contract  containing  an  arbitration 
clause.  When  a  dispute  arose  and  Volt  demanded  arbitra-tion, Stanford sued Volt and two other companies involved in 
the  construction  project.  Those  other  companies  were  not parties to the arbitration agreement; Stanford sought indem-
nification from them in the event that Volt prevailed against Stanford.  At Stanford's request, the Superior Court stayed 
the  arbitration.  The  California  Court  of  Appeal  affirmed the  stay  order.  Volt  and  Stanford  incorporated  $ 1281.2(c) 
into  their  agreement,  the  appeals  court  held.  They  did  so by stipulating that the contract--otherwise silent on the pri-
ority of suits drawing in parties not subject to arbitration-- would be governed by California law. 

Board of Trustees of 
Leland Stanford Junior Univ. v.  Volt Information Sciences, Inc.,  240  Cal.  Rptr.  558,  561  (1987)  (officially  depublished). 

Relying  on  the  Court  of  Appeal's  interpretation  of  the  con-tract, we held that the FAA did not bar a stay of arbitration 
pending  the  resolution  of  Stanford's  Superior  Court  suit against Volt and the two companies not bound by the arbitra-
tion agreement.

Opinion of the Court 
Preston and Ferrer's contract also contains a choice-of-law clause,  which  states  that  the  "agreement  shall  be  governed 

by  the  laws  of  the  state  of  California."  App.  17.  A  sepa-rate saving clause provides: "If there is any conflict between 
this agreement and any present or future  law," the  law pre-vails over the contract "to the extent necessary to bring [the 
contract]  within  the  requirements  of  said  law."  Id.,  at  18. 
Those contractual terms, according to Ferrer, call for the ap-plication of California procedural law, including $ 1700.44(a)'s 

grant  of  exclusive  jurisdiction  to  the  Labor  Commissioner. Ferrer's reliance on 

Volt  is misplaced for two discrete rea-
sons.  First,  arbitration was stayed in  Volt  to accommodate 
litigation  involving  third  parties  who  were  strangers  to  the 
arbitration  agreement.  Nothing  in  the  arbitration  agree-
ment  addressed  the  order  of  proceedings  when  pending  liti-
gation with third parties presented the prospect of inconsist-
ent  rulings.  We  thought  it  proper,  in  those  circumstances, 
to recognize state law as the gap filler. 

Here, in contrast, the arbitration clause speaks to the mat-
ter  in  controversy;  it  states  that  "any  dispute . . .  relating 
to . . . the breach, validity, or legality" of the contract should 
be  arbitrated  in  accordance  with  the  American  Arbitration 
Association (AAA) rules.  App. 18.  Both parties are bound 
by  the  arbitration  agreement;  the  question  of  Preston's  sta-
tus as a talent agent relates to the validity or legality of the 
contract;  there  is  no  risk  that  related  litigation  will  yield 
conflicting  rulings  on  common  issues;  and  there  is  no  other 
procedural void for the choice-of-law clause to fill. 

Second,  we  are  guided  by  our  more  recent  decision  in 
Mastrobuono v.  Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U. S. 52 
(1995).  Although the contract in Volt  provided for "arbitra-
tion  in  accordance  with  the  Construction  Industry  Arbitra-
tion  Rules  of  the  American  Arbitration  Association,"  489 
U. S.,  at  470,  n.  1  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted),  Volt 
never  argued  that  incorporation  of  those  rules  trumped  the 
choice-of-law  clause  contained  in  the  contract,  see  Brief  for

362  PRESTON  v.  FERRER 

Opinion of the Court 
Appellant,  and  Reply  Brief,  in  Volt  Information  Sciences, Inc.  v.  Board  of  Trustees  of  Leland  Stanford  Junior  Univ., 

O.  T.  1988,  No.  87-1318.  Therefore,  neither  our  decision  in Volt  nor  the  decision  of  the  California  appeals  court  in  that 
case addressed the import of the contract's incorporation by reference of privately promulgated arbitration rules. 

In  Mastrobuono,  we  reached  that  open  question  while  in-terpreting  a  contract  with  both  a  New  York  choice-of-law 
clause  and  a  clause  providing  for  arbitration  in  accordance with the rules of the National Association of Securities Deal-
ers (NASD).  514 U. S., at 58-59.8  The "best way to harmo-nize" the two clauses, we held, was to read the choice-of-law 
clause  "to  encompass  substantive  principles  that  New  York courts  would  apply,  but  not  to  include  [New  York's]  special 
rules  limiting  the  authority  of  arbitrators."  Id.,  at  63-64. Preston and Ferrer's contract, as noted, provides for arbi-
tration  in  accordance  with  the  AAA  rules.  App.  18.  One of  those  rules  states  that  "[t]he  arbitrator  shall  have  the 
power  to  determine  the  existence  or  validity  of  a  contract of  which  an  arbitration  clause  forms  a  part."  AAA,  Com-
mercial  Arbitration  Rules  || R-7(b)  (2007),  online  at  http:// www.adr.org/sp.asp?id=22440 (as visited Feb. 15, 2008, and in 
Clerk  of  Court's  case  file).  The  incorporation  of  the  AAA rules,  and  in  particular  Rule  7(b),  weighs  against  inferring 
from  the  choice-of-law  clause  an  understanding  shared  by Ferrer  and  Preston  that  their  disputes  would  be  heard,  in 

8 The question in Mastrobuono was whether the arbitrator could award 
punitive  damages.  See  Mastrobuono  v.  Shearson  Lehman  Hutton,  Inc., 
514 U. S. 52, 53-54 (1995).  New York law prohibited arbitrators, but not 
courts,  from  awarding  such  damages.  Id.,  at  55.  The  NASD  rules,  in 
contrast,  authorized  "damages  and  other  relief,"  which,  according  to  an 
NASD arbitration manual, included punitive damages.  Id., at 61 (internal 
quotation marks omitted).  Relying on Volt, respondents argued that the 
choice-of-law  clause  incorporated  into  the  parties'  arbitration  agreement 
New  York's  ban  on  arbitral  awards  of  punitive  damages.  Opposing  that 
argument,  petitioners successfully  urged  that the  agreement to  arbitrate 
in accordance with the NASD rules controlled.

Amendment  nowhere  mentions  the  particular  state  enforce-ment  method here  at issue;  indeed,  it  does  not  mention  spe-

cific state enforcement methods at all. Maine's  inability  to  find  significant  support  for  some  kind 
of  "public  health"  exception  is  not  surprising.  "Public health" does not define itself.  Many products create "public 
health"  risks  of  differing  kind  and  degree.  To  accept 
Maine's  justification  in  respect  to  a  rule  regulating  services would legitimate rules regulating routes or rates for similar 

public health reasons.  And to allow Maine directly to regu-late  carrier  services  would  permit  other  States  to  do  the 
same.  Given  the  number  of  States  through  which  carriers 
travel,  the  number  of  products,  the  variety  of  potential  ad-
verse public health effects, the many different kinds of regu-
latory rules potentially available, and the difficulty of finding 
a legal criterion for separating permissible from impermissi-
ble  public-health-oriented  regulations,  Congress  is  unlikely 
to  have  intended  an  implicit  general  "public  health"  excep-
tion broad enough to cover even the shipments at issue here. 

This is not to say that this federal law generally pre-empts 
state  public  health  regulation:  for  instance,  state  regulation 
that  broadly  prohibits  certain  forms  of  conduct  and  affects, 
say,  truckdrivers,  only  in  their  capacity  as  members  of  the

should  contain,"  including:  the  employee's  and  employer's  names,  ad-
dresses,  and  phone  numbers;  an  allegation  that  the  employee  was  the 
victim  of  age  discrimination;  the  number  of  employees  of  the  charged 
employer;  and  a  statement  indicating  whether  the  charging  party  has 
initiated state proceedings.  Section 1626.8(b), however, seems to qual-
ify these requirements by stating that a charge is "sufficient" if it meets 
the  requirements  of  $ 1626.6--i. e.,  if  it  is  "in  writing  and  .  .  .  name[s] 
the  prospective  respondent  and  .  .  .  generally  allege[s]  the  discrimina-
tory  act(s)."  That  the  meaning  of  charge  remains  unclear,  even  with 
the  regulations,  is  evidenced  by  the  differing  positions  of  the  parties 
and the Courts of Appeals on the matter.  Pp. 395-396. 

(b)  Just  as  this  Court  defers  to  reasonable  statutory  interpreta-
tions,  an  agency  is  entitled  to  deference  when  it  adopts  a  reasonable 
interpretation  of  its  regulations,  unless  its  position  is  " `plainly  errone-
ous  or  inconsistent  with  the  regulation,' "  Auer  v.  Robbins,  519  U. S. 
452,  461.  The  Court  accords  such  deference  to  the  EEOC's  position 
that its regulations identify certain requirements for a charge but do not 
provide  an  exhaustive  definition.  It  follows  that  a  document  meeting 

$ 1626.6's requirements is not a charge in every instance.  The language 
in  $$ 1626.6  and  1626.8  cannot  be  viewed  in  isolation  from  the  rest  of 
the regulations.  While the regulations' structure is less than clear, the 
relevant provisions are grouped under the title, "Procedures--Age Dis-
crimination  in  Employment  Act."  A  permissible  reading  is  that  the 
regulations  identify the  procedures  for  filing  a  charge  but  do not  state 
the full contents of a charge.  Pp. 396-397. 

(c)  That  does  not  resolve  this  case  because  the  regulations  do  not 
state  what  additional  elements  are  required  in  a  charge.  The  EEOC 
submits,  in  accordance  with  a  position  it  has  adopted  in  internal  di-
rectives  over  the  years,  that  the  proper  test  is  whether  a  filing,  taken 
as  a  whole,  should  be  construed  as  a  request  by  the  employee  for  the 
EEOC  to  take  whatever  action  is  necessary  to  vindicate  her  rights. 
Pp. 398-399. 

(d)  The  EEOC  acted  within  its  authority  in  formulating  its 
request-to-act requirement.  The agency's policy statements, embodied 
in  its  compliance  manual  and  internal  directives,  interpret  not  only  its 
regulations  but  also  the  statute  itself.  Assuming  these  interpretive 
statements are not entitled to full Chevron deference, they nevertheless 
are entitled to a "measure of respect" under the less deferential stand-
ard of Skidmore v.  Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, see Alaska Dept. of Envi-
ronmental Conservation v.  EPA, 540 U. S. 461, 487, whereby the Court 
considers whether the agency has consistently applied its position, e. g., 
United  States  v.  Mead  Corp.,  533  U. S.  218,  228.  Here,  the  relevant 
interpretive statement has been binding on EEOC staff for at least five 
years.  True,  the  agency's  implementation  has  been  uneven;  e. g.,  its

Syllabus 
field office did not treat respondent's filing as a charge, and, as a result, 
she  filed  suit  before  the  EEOC  could  initiate  conciliation  with  FedEx. 
Such  undoubted  deficiencies  are  not  enough,  however,  to  deprive  an 
agency that processes over 175,000 inquiries a year of all judicial defer-
ence.  Moreover,  the  charge  must  be  defined  in  a  way  that  allows  the 
agency to fulfill its distinct statutory functions of enforcing antidiscrimi-
nation laws, see 29 U. S. C. $ 626(d), and disseminating information about 
those  laws  to  the  public,  see,  e. g.,  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  $$ 705(i), 
705(g)(3).  Pp. 399-403. 

(e)  FedEx's  view  that  because  the  EEOC  must  act  "[u]pon  re-
ceiving . . . a charge," 29 U. S. C. $ 626(d), its failure to do so means the 
filing is not a charge, is rejected as too artificial a reading of the ADEA. 
The  statute  requires  the  aggrieved  individual  to  file  a  charge  before 
filing  a  lawsuit;  it  does  not  condition  the  individual's  right  to  sue  upon 
the agency taking any action.  Cf. Edelman v.  Lynchburg College, 535 
U. S. 106, 112-113.  Moreover, because the filing of a charge determines 
when the ADEA's time limits and procedural mechanisms commence, it 
would  be  illogical  and  impractical  to  make  the  definition  of  charge  de-
pendent  upon  a  condition  subsequent  over  which  the  parties  have  no 
control.  Cf.  Logan  v.  Zimmerman  Brush  Co.,  455  U. S.  422,  444. 
Pp. 403-404. 

2.  The agency's determination that respondent's December 2001 filing 
was  a  charge  is  a  reasonable  exercise  of  its  authority  to  apply  its  own 
regulations  and  procedures  in  the  course  of  the  routine  administration 
of the statute it enforces.  Pp. 404-407. 

(a)  Respondent's completed Form 283 contained all the information 
outlined in 29 CFR $ 1626.8, and, although the form did not itself request 
agency  action,  the  accompanying  affidavit  asked  the  EEOC  to  "force 
[FedEx]  to  end  [its]  age discrimination  plan."  FedEx  contends  unper-
suasively  that,  in  context,  the  latter  statement  is  ambiguous  because 
the affidavit also stated: "I have been . . . assur[ed] by [the EEOC] that 
this  Affidavit  will  be  considered  confidential . . . and  will  not  be 
disclosed . . . unless it becomes necessary . . . to produce the affidavit in 
a  formal  proceeding."  This argument reads  too much  into the nondis-
closure  assurances.  Respondent  did  not  request  the  EEOC  to  avoid 
contacting FedEx, but stated only her understanding that the affidavit 
itself would be kept confidential and, even then, consented to disclosure 
of  the  affidavit  in  a  "formal  proceeding."  Furthermore,  respondent 
checked a box on the Form 283 giving consent for the EEOC to disclose 
her identity  to FedEx.  The fact  that respondent filed a formal charge 
with the EEOC after she filed her District Court complaint is irrelevant 
because  postfiling  conduct  does  not  nullify  an  earlier,  proper  charge.

Opinion of the Court 
(b)  Because the EEOC failed to treat respondent's filing as a charge 
in the first instance, both sides lost the benefits of the ADEA's informal 
dispute  resolution  process.  The  court  that  hears  the  merits  can  at-
tempt  to  remedy  this  deficiency  by  staying  the  proceedings  to  allow 
an  opportunity  for  conciliation  and  settlement.  While  that  remedy  is 
imperfect, it is unavoidable in this case.  However, the ultimate respon-
sibility  for establishing a  clearer, more  consistent  process lies with the 
EEOC,  which  should  determine,  in  the  first  instance,  what  revisions 
to  its  forms  and  processes  are  necessary  or  appropriate  to  reduce  the 
risk  of  future  misunderstandings  by  those  who  seek  its  assistance.

Opinion of the Court 
29  U. S. C.  $ 621  et  seq.  When  an  employee  files  "a  charge 
alleging  unlawful  [age]  discrimination"  with  the  Equal  Em-
ployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the charge sets 
the  Act's  enforcement  mechanisms  in  motion,  commencing  a 
waiting  period  during  which  the  employee  cannot  file  suit. 
The  phrase,  "a  charge  alleging  unlawful  discrimination,"  is 
used  in  the  statute,  $ 626(d),  and  "charge"  appears  in  the 
agency's  implementing  regulations;  but  it  has  no  statutory 
definition.  In deciding what constitutes a charge under  the 
Act the Courts of Appeals have adopted different definitions. 
As a result, difficulties have arisen in determining when em-
ployees may seek relief under the ADEA in courts of compe-
tent jurisdiction. 

As  a cautionary  preface,  we  note  that  the  EEOC  enforce-
ment  mechanisms  and  statutory  waiting  periods  for  ADEA 
claims differ in some respects from those pertaining to other 
statutes  the  EEOC  enforces,  such  as  Title  VII  of  the  Civil 
Rights  Act  of  1964,  78  Stat.  253,  as  amended,  42  U. S. C. 

$ 2000e  et  seq.,  and  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  of 
1990,  104  Stat.  327,  as  amended,  42  U. S. C.  $ 12101  et  seq. 
While  there  may  be  areas  of  common  definition,  employees 
and their counsel must be careful not to apply rules applica-
ble  under  one  statute  to  a  different  statute  without  careful 
and critical examination.  Cf. General Dynamics Land Sys-
tems, Inc. v.  Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 586-587 (2004).  This is so 
even  if  the  EEOC  forms  and  the  same  definition  of  charge 
apply in more than one type of discrimination case.

Petitioner,  Federal  Express  Corporation  (FedEx),  pro-
vides  mail pickup and delivery  services to customers world-
wide.  In 1994 and 1995, FedEx initiated  two programs, de-
signed,  it  says,  to  make  its  45,000-strong  courier  network 
more  productive.  The  programs,  "Best  Practice  Pays" 
(BPP)  and  "Minimum  Acceptable  Performance  Standards"

Opinion of the Court 
(MAPS),  tied  the  couriers'  compensation  and  continued  em-
ployment  to  certain  performance  benchmarks,  for  instance 
the number of stops a courier makes per day. 

Respondents  are  14  current  and  former  FedEx  couriers 
over  the  age  of  40.  They  filed  suit  in  the  United  States 
District  Court  for  the  Southern  District  of  New  York  on 
April 30, 2002, claiming, inter alia, that BPP and MAPS vio-
late the ADEA.  Asserting that their claims were typical of 
many  couriers  nationwide,  respondents  sought  to  represent 
a plaintiffs' class of all couriers over the age of 40 who were 
subject to alleged acts of age discrimination by FedEx.  The 
suit maintains that BPP and MAPS were veiled attempts to 
force older workers out of the company before they would be 
entitled to receive retirement benefits.  FedEx, it is alleged, 
used  the  initiatives  as  a  pretext  for  harassing  and  discrimi-
nating against older couriers in favor of younger ones. 

The  immediate  question  before  us  is  the  timeliness  of  the 
suit  filed  by  one  of  the  plaintiffs  below,  Patricia  Kennedy, 
referred  to  here  as  "respondent."  Petitioner  moved  to  dis-
miss respondent's action, contending respondent had not filed 
her charge with the EEOC at least 60 days before filing suit, 
as  required  by  29  U. S. C.  $ 626(d).  Respondent  countered 
that  she  filed  a  valid  charge  on  December  11,  2001,  by  sub-
mitting EEOC Form 283. 

The  agency  labels  Form  283  an  "Intake  Questionnaire." 
Respondent  attached  to  the  questionnaire  a  signed  affidavit 
describing  the  alleged  discriminatory  employment  practices 
in greater detail.  The District Court determined these doc-
uments were not a charge and granted the motion to dismiss.

Cert. 39a.  An appeal followed, and the Court of Appeals for 
the  Second  Circuit  reversed.  See  440  F.  3d  558,  570  (2006). 
We granted certiorari to consider whether respondent's filing 
was a charge, 551 U. S. 1102 (2007), and we now affirm.

Opinion of the Court 

II 
This case presents two distinct questions: What is a charge as the ADEA uses that term?  And were the documents re-

spondent filed in December 2001 a charge? 

A 
The relevant statutory provision states: 

"No  civil  action  may  be  commenced  by  an  individual under  [the  ADEA]  until 60 days  after  a charge alleging 

unlawful  discrimination  has  been  filed  with  the  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. . . .  

. . . . . 
"Upon  receiving  such  a  charge,  the  Commission  shall promptly notify all persons named in such charge as pro-

spective  defendants  in  the  action  and  shall  promptly seek to eliminate any alleged unlawful practice by infor-
mal methods of conciliation, conference, and persuasion." 29 U. S. C. $ 626(d). 

The Act does not define charge.  While EEOC regulations give  some  content  to  the  term,  they  fall  short  of  a  compre-
hensive  definition.  The  agency  has  statutory  authority  to issue  regulations,  see  $ 628;  and  when  an  agency  invokes  its 
authority to issue regulations, which then interpret ambigu-ous statutory terms, the courts defer to its reasonable inter-
pretations.  See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.  Natural Resources 
Defense  Council,  Inc.,  467  U. S.  837,  843-845  (1984).  The regulations  the  agency  has  adopted--so  far  as  they  go--are 

reasonable constructions of the term charge.  There is little dispute  about  this.  The  issue  is  the  guidance  the  regula-
tions give. One  of  the  regulations,  29 CFR  $ 1626.3  (2007),  is  entitled 
"Other definitions."  It says: "charge shall mean a statement filed  with  the  Commission  by  or  on  behalf  of  an  aggrieved 
person  which  alleges  that  the  named  prospective  defendant

Opinion of the Court 
has  engaged  in  or  is  about  to  engage  in  actions  in  violation of the Act."  Section 1626.8(a) identifies  five pieces of infor-

mation  a  "charge  should  contain":  (1)-(2)  the  names,  ad-dresses,  and  telephone  numbers  of  the  person  making  the 
charge  and  the  charged  entity;  (3)  a  statement  of  facts  de-scribing  the  alleged  discriminatory  act;  (4)  the  number  of 
employees of the charged employer; and (5) a statement indi-cating  whether  the  charging  party  has  initiated  state  pro-
ceedings.  The  next  subsection,  $ 1626.8(b),  however,  seems to  qualify  these  requirements  by  stating  that  a  charge  is 
"sufficient"  if  it  meets  the  requirements  of  $ 1626.6--i. e.,  if it  is  "in  writing  and  . .  .  name[s]  the  prospective  respondent 
and . . . generally allege[s] the discriminatory act(s)." Even with the aid of the regulations the meaning of charge 
remains  unclear,  as  is  evident  from  the  differing  positions of  the  parties  now  before  us  and  in  the  Courts  of  Appeals. 
Petitioner  contends  an  Intake  Questionnaire  cannot  be  a charge  unless  the  EEOC  acts  upon  it.  On  the  other  hand 
some  Courts  of  Appeals,  including  the  Court  of  Appeals  for the  Second  Circuit,  take  a  position  similar  to  the  Govern-
ment's  in  this  case,  that  an  Intake  Questionnaire  can  con-stitute  a  charge  if  it  expresses  the  filer's  intent  to  activate 
the  EEOC's  enforcement  processes.  See,  e. g.,  Steffen  v. Meridian  Life  Ins.  Co.,  859  F.  2d  534,  542  (CA7  1988).  A 
third view, which seems to accord with respondent's position, is  that  all  completed  Intake  Questionnaires  are  charges. 
See, e. g., Casavantes v.  California State Univ., Sacramento, 732 F. 2d 1441, 1443 (CA9 1984). 

B 
In  support  of  her  position  that  the  Intake  Questionnaire she filed, taken together with the attached six-page affidavit, 

meets  the  regulatory  definition  of  a  charge,  respondent places  considerable  emphasis  on  what  might  be  described 
as  the  regulations'  catchall  or  saving  provision,  29  CFR $ 1626.8(b).  This  seems  to  require  only  a  written  document 

552US2 Unit: $U21 [01-11-12 12:28:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court 
with  a  general  allegation  of  discriminatory  conduct  by  a named  employer.  Respondent  points  out  that,  when  read 

together,  $$ 1626.8(b)  and  1626.6  say  that  a  "charge  is  suffi-cient when the Commission receives . . .  a written statement" 
that  "name[s]  the  [employer]  and . . .  generally  allege[s]  the discriminatory  act(s)."  Respondent  views  this  language  as 
unequivocal  and  sees  no  basis  for  requiring  that  a  charge 
contain any additional information. The EEOC's view, as expressed in the Government's 

ami-
cus  brief,  however,  is  that  the  regulations  identify  certain requirements  for  a  charge  but  do  not  provide  an  exhaustive 

definition.  As  such,  not  all  documents  that  meet  the  mini-
mal requirements of $ 1626.6 are charges. 

The question, then, becomes how to interpret the scope of 
the regulations.  Just as we defer to an agency's reasonable 
interpretations  of  the  statute  when  it  issues  regulations  in 
the first instance, see Chevron, supra, the agency is entitled 
to further deference when it adopts a reasonable interpreta-
tion of regulations it has put in force.  See Auer v.  Robbins, 
519  U. S.  452  (1997).  Under  Auer,  we  accept  the  agency's 
position unless it is " ` "plainly erroneous or inconsistent with 
the regulation." ' "  Id., at 461 (quoting Robertson v.  Methow 
Valley Citizens Council, 490 U. S. 332, 359 (1989)). 

In  accord  with  this  standard  we  accept  the  agency's  posi-
tion that the regulations do not identify all necessary compo-
nents of a charge; and it follows that a document meeting the 
requirements  of  $ 1626.6  is  not  a  charge  in  every  instance. 
The  language  in  $$ 1626.6  and  1626.8  cannot  be  viewed  in 
isolation  from  the  rest  of  the  regulations.  True,  the  struc-
ture  of  the  regulations  is  less  than  clear.  But  the  relevant 
provisions  are  grouped  under  the  title,  "Procedures--Age 
Discrimination in Employment Act."  A permissible reading 
is  that  the  regulations  identify  the  procedures  for  filing  a 
charge but  do not  state  the  full contents  a  charge document 
must contain.  This is the agency's position, and we defer to 
it under Auer.

Opinion of the Court 

C 
This  does not  resolve the  case.  While  we  agree with  the Government  that  the  regulations  do  not  state  all  the  ele-

ments a charge must contain, the question of what additional elements  are  required  remains.  On  this  point  the  regula-
tions are silent. The  EEOC  submits  that  the  proper  test  for  determining 
whether a  filing is a charge is  whether  the  filing, taken  as a whole, should be construed as a request by the employee for 
the agency to take whatever action is necessary to vindicate her  rights.  Brief  for  United  States  as 

Amicus  Curiae  15. The  EEOC  has  adopted  this  position  in  the  Government's 

amicus brief  and in  various  internal directives  it  has  issued to  its  field  offices  over  the  years.  See 1  EEOC  Compliance 
Manual  $ 2.2(b),  p.  2:0001  (Aug.  2002);  Memorandum  from Elizabeth  M.  Thornton,  Director,  Office  of  Field  Programs, 
EEOC, to All District, Area, and Local Office Directors et al. (Feb.  21,  2002),  online  at  http://www.eeoc.gov/charge/memo-
2-21-02.html  (hereinafter  Thornton  Memo)  (all  Internet  ma-terials  as  visited  Feb.  21,  2008,  and  available  in  Clerk  of 
Court's  case  file);  Memorandum  from  Nicholas  M.  Inzeo,  Di-rector,  Office  of  Field  Programs,  EEOC,  to  All  District, 
Field, Area, and Local Office Directors et al. (Aug. 13, 2007), online at http://www.eeoc.gov/charge/memo-8-13-07.html. 
The  Government  asserts  that  this  request-to-act  require-ment  is  a  reasonable  extrapolation  of  the  agency's  regula-
tions and that, as a result, the agency's position is dispositive under Auer. 

The  Government  acknowledges  the  regulations do  not,  on their  face,  speak  to  the  filer's  intent.  To  the  extent  the 
request-to-act  requirement  can  be  derived  from  the  text  of the  regulations,  it  must  spring  from  the  term  charge.  But, 
in  this  context,  the  term  charge  is  not  a  construct  of  the agency's regulations.  It is a term Congress used in the un-
derlying  statute  that  has  been  incorporated  in  the  regula-tions  by  the  agency.  Thus,  insofar  as  they  speak  to  the  fil-

Opinion of the Court 
er's intent, the regulations do so by repeating language from the  underlying  statute.  It  could  be  argued,  then,  that  this 

case  can  be  distinguished from  Auer.  See Gonzales  v.  Ore-gon,  546  U. S.  243,  257  (2006)  (the  "near  equivalence  of  the 
statute and regulation belies [the case for] Auer deference"); 
Christensen  v.  Harris  County,  529  U. S.  576,  588  (2000)  (an agency  cannot  "under  the  guise  of  interpreting  a  regula-

tion . . . create de facto a new regulation"). It  is  not  necessary  to  hold  that  Auer  deference  applies  to 
the  agency's  construction  of  the  term  charge  as  it  is  used in  the  regulations,  however.  For  even  if  Auer  deference  is 
inapplicable,  we  would  accept  the  agency's  proposed  con-struction of the statutory term, and we turn next to the rea-
sons for this conclusion.  D 

In  our  view  the  agency's  policy  statements,  embodied  in its  compliance  manual  and  internal  directives,  interpret  not 
only  the  regulations  but  also  the  statute  itself.  Assuming these  interpretive  statements  are  not  entitled  to  full  Chev-
ron  deference,  they  do  reflect  " `a  body  of  experience  and informed  judgment  to  which  courts  and  litigants  may  prop-
erly resort for guidance.' "  Bragdon v.  Abbott, 524 U. S. 624, 642  (1998)  (quoting 

Skidmore  v.  Swift & Co.,  323  U. S.  134, 139-140  (1944)).  As  such,  they  are  entitled  to  a  "measure 

of  respect"  under  the  less  deferential  Skidmore  standard. Alaska  Dept.  of  Environmental  Conservation  v.  EPA,  540 
U. S.  461,  487,  488  (2004);  United  States  v.  Mead  Corp.,  533 U. S. 218, 227-239 (2001). 

Under Skidmore, we consider whether the agency has ap-plied  its  position  with  consistency.  Mead  Corp.,  supra,  at 
228; Good Samaritan Hospital v.  Shalala, 508 U. S. 402, 417 (1993).  Here, the relevant interpretive statement, embodied 
in  the  compliance manual and memoranda, has been  binding on EEOC staff for at least five years.  See Thornton Memo, 
supra.  True, as the Government concedes, the agency's im-plementation  of  this  policy  has  been  uneven.  See  Brief  for

Opinion of the Court 
United  States  as  Amicus  Curiae  25.  In  the  very  case  be-fore us the EEOC's Tampa field office did not treat respond-

ent's filing as a charge, as the  Government now maintains it should  have  done.  And,  as  a  result,  respondent  filed  suit 
before  the  agency  could  initiate  a  conciliation  process  with the employer. 

These  undoubted  deficiencies  in  the  agency's  administra-ti
on of the statute and its regulatory scheme are not enough, however,  to  deprive  the  agency  of  all  judicial  deference. 

Some  degree  of  inconsistent  treatment  is  unavoidable  when the  agency  processes  over  175,000  inquiries  a  year. 

Id.,  at 
19,  n.  10.  And  although  one  of  the  policy  memoranda  the 
Government relies upon was circulated after we granted cer-
tiorari,  the  position  the  document  takes  is  consistent  with 
the  EEOC's  previous  directives.  We  see  no  reason  to  as-
sume  the  agency's  position--that  a  charge  is  filed  when  the 
employee requests some action--was framed for  the specific 
purpose  of  aiding  a  party  in  this  litigation.  Cf.  Bowen  v. 
Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 212-213 (1988). 

The EEOC, moreover, has drawn our attention to the need 
to define charge in a way that allows the agency to fulfill its 
distinct  statutory  functions  of  enforcing  antidiscrimination 
laws  and  disseminating  information  about  those  laws  to  the 
public.  Cf.  Barnhart  v.  Walton,  535  U. S.  212,  225  (2002) 
(noting  that  deference  is  appropriate  in  "matters  of  detail 
related  to  [an  agency's]  administration"  of  a  statute).  The 
agency's  duty  to  initiate  informal  dispute  resolution  proc-
esses  upon  receipt  of  a  charge  is  mandatory  in  the  ADEA 
context.  See  29  U. S. C.  $ 626(d)  ("[T]he  Commission  .  .  . 
shall  promptly  seek  to  eliminate  any  alleged  unlawful  prac-
tice by informal methods of conciliation, conference, and per-
suasion"); Cf. Lopez v.  Davis, 531 U. S. 230, 241 (2001) (noting 
that Congress' use of the term " `shall' " indicates an intent to 
"impose discretionless obligations").  Yet, at the same time, 
Congress  intended  the  agency  to  serve  an  "educational" 
function.  See Civil Rights Act of 1964, $ 705(i), 78 Stat. 259;

Opinion of the Court 
id.,  $ 705(g)(3)  (noting  that  the  Commission  shall  have  the power to "furnish to persons subject to this title such techni-

cal assistance as they may request").  Providing answers to the  public's  questions  is  a  critical  part  of  the  EEOC's  mis-
sion;  and  it  accounts  for  a  substantial  part  of  the  agency's work.  Of  about  175,000  inquiries  the  agency  receives  each 
year, it dockets around 76,000 of these as charges.  Brief for 
United  States  as  Amicus  Curiae  19,  n.  10.  Even  allowing for  errors  in  the  classification  of  charges  and  noncharges,  it 

is evident that many filings come from individuals who have questions about their rights and simply want information. 

For efficient operations, and to effect congressional intent, 
the agency requires some mechanism to separate information 
requests  from  enforcement  requests.  Respondent's  pro-
posed standard, that a charge need contain only an allegation 
of discrimination and the name of the employer, falls short in 
this  regard.  Were  that  stripped-down  standard  to  prevail, 
individuals  who  approach  the  agency  with  questions  could 
end  up  divulging  enough  information  to  create  a  charge. 
This  likely  would  be  the  case  for  anyone  who  completes  an 
Intake  Questionnaire--which  provides  space  to  indicate  the 
name  and  address  of  the  offending  employer  and  asks  the 
individual  to  answer  the  question,  "What  action  was  taken 
against you that you believe to be discrimination?"  App. to 
Pet.  for  Cert.  43a.  If  an  individual  knows  that  reporting 
this  minimal  information  to  the  agency  will  mandate  the 
agency to notify her employer, she may be discouraged from 
consulting the agency or wait until her employment situation 
has  become  so  untenable  that  conciliation  efforts  would  be 
futile.  The result would be contrary to Congress' expressed 
desire that the EEOC act as an information provider and try 
to settle employment disputes through informal means. 

For these reasons,  the  definition  of charge respondent ad-
vocates--i. e., that it need conform only to 29 CFR $ 1626.6-- 
is  in  considerable  tension  with  the  structure  and  purposes 
of the ADEA.  The agency's interpretive position--the

Opinion of the Court 
request-to-act  requirement--provides  a  reasonable  alterna-tive  that  is  consistent  with  the  statutory  framework.  No 

clearer alternatives are within our  authority or expertise to adopt;  and  so  deference  to  the  agency  is  appropriate  under 
Skidmore.  We conclude as follows: In addition to the infor-mation  required  by  the  regulations, 

i. e.,  an  allegation  and 
the  name  of  the  charged  party,  if  a  filing  is  to  be  deemed  a 
charge  it must  be  reasonably construed  as  a  request for  the agency  to  take  remedial  action  to  protect  the  employee's 

rights  or  otherwise  settle  a  dispute  between  the  employer and the employee. 

Some  Courts of  Appeals  have  referred to  a " `manifest  in-
tent' " test, under which, in order to be deemed a charge, the 
filing  must  demonstrate  "an  individual's  intent  to  have  the

Corp.,  270  F.  3d  1314,  1319  (CA11  2001);  Steffen,  859  F.  2d, 
at 543; Bihler  v.  Singer Co.,  710  F. 2d 96,  99 (CA3 1983).  If 
this formulation suggests the filer's state of mind is somehow 
determinative, it misses the point.  If, however, it means the 
filing must  be examined from  the  standpoint of  an objective 
observer to determine whether, by a reasonable construction 
of its terms, the filer requests the agency to activate its ma-
chinery and remedial processes, that would be in accord with 
our conclusion. 

It is true that under this permissive standard a wide range 
of documents might be classified as charges.  But this result 
is  consistent  with  the  design  and  purpose  of  the  ADEA. 
Even in the formal litigation context, pro se litigants are held 
to  a  lesser  pleading  standard  than  other  parties.  See  Es-
telle v.  Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 106 (1976) (Pro se pleadings are 
to  be  "liberally  construed").  In  the  administrative  context 
now  before  us  it  appears  pro  se  filings  may  be  the  rule,  not 
the exception.  The ADEA, like Title VII, sets up  a "reme-
dial  scheme  in  which  laypersons,  rather  than  lawyers,  are 
expected to initiate the process."  EEOC v.  Commercial Of-

"common  purpose"  of  Title  VII  and  the  ADEA).  The  sys-tem  must  be  accessible  to  individuals  who  have  no  detailed 
knowledge of the relevant statutory mechanisms and agency processes.  It thus is consistent with the purposes of the Act 
that a charge can be a form, easy to complete, or an informal document, easy to draft.  The agency's proposed test imple-
ments these purposes. Reasonable arguments can be made that the agency should 
adopt  a  standard  giving  more  guidance  to  filers,  making  it clear that the request to act must be stated in quite explicit 
terms.  A  rule  of  that  sort  might  yield  more  consistent  re-sults.  This, however, is a matter for the agency to decide in 
light of its experience and expertise in protecting the rights of  those  who  are  covered  by  the  Act.  For  its  decisions  in 
this regard the agency is subject to the oversight of the polit-ical  branches.  Cf.  National  Cable  &  Telecommunications 
Assn. v.  Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 980 (2005) ("Filling these gaps [in ambiguous statutes] involves difficult 
policy choices that agencies are better equipped to make than courts").  We find no  reason in  this  case to depart from our 
usual  rule:  Where  ambiguities  in  statutory  analysis  and  ap-plication  are  presented,  the  agency  may  choose  among  rea-
sonable alternatives.  E 

Asserting  its  interest  as  an  employer,  petitioner  urges  us to condition the definition of charge, and hence an employee's 
ability to sue, upon the EEOC's fulfilling its mandatory duty to notify the charged party and initiate a conciliation process. 
In  petitioner's  view,  because  the  Commission  must  act "[u]pon receiving such a charge," 29 U. S. C. $ 626(d), its fail-
ure to do so means the filing is not a charge. The agency rejects this view, as do we.  As a textual mat-
ter,  the  proposal  is  too  artificial  a  reading  of  the  statute  to accept.  The statute requires the aggrieved individual to file

a charge before filing a lawsuit; it does not condition the indi-vidual's  right  to  sue  upon  the  agency  taking  any  action. 

Ibid.  ("No  civil  action  may  be  commenced  by  an  individual under  [the  ADEA]  until  60  days  after  a  charge  alleging  un-
lawful discrimination has been filed with the Equal Employ-ment Opportunity Commission"); Cf. 

Edelman v.  Lynchburg College,  535  U. S.  106,  112-113  (2002)  (rejecting  the  argu-

ment  that  a  charge  is  not  a  charge  until  the  filer  satisfies Title VII's oath or affirmation requirement).  The filing of a 
charge, moreover, determines when the Act's time limits and procedural mechanisms commence.  It would be illogical and 
impractical to make the definition of charge dependent upon a  condition  subsequent  over  which  the  parties  have  no  con-
trol.  Cf. Logan v.  Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U. S. 422, 444 (1982) (Powell, J., concurring in judgment). 

III 
Having  determined  that  the  agency  acted  within  its  au-thority  in  formulating  the  rule  that  a  filing  is  deemed  a 

charge  if  the  document  reasonably  can  be  construed  to  re-quest agency action and appropriate relief on the employee's 
behalf,  the  question  is  whether  the  filing  here  meets  this test.  The agency says it does, and we agree.  The agency's 
determination  is  a  reasonable  exercise  of  its  authority  to apply its own regulations and procedures in the course of the 
routine administration of the statute it enforces. Respondent's  completed  intake  form  contained  all  of  the 
information  outlined  in  29  CFR  $ 1626.8,  including:  the  em-ployee's  name,  address,  and  telephone  number,  as  well  as 
those  of  her  employer;  an  allegation  that  she  and  other  em-ployees  had  been  the  victims  of  "age  discrimination";  the 
number  of  employees  who  worked  at  the  Dunedin,  Florida, 
facility where she was stationed;  and a statement indicating 
she had not sought the assistance of any government agency regarding this matter.  See App. 265.

Opinion of the Court 
Petitioner maintains the filing was still deficient because it 
contained no request for the agency to act.  Were the Intake 
Questionnaire  the  only  document  before  us  we  might  agree 
its  handwritten  statements  do  not  request  action.  The  de-
sign of the form in use in 2001, moreover, does not give rise 
to  the  inference  that  the  employee  requests  action  against 
the  employer.  Unlike  EEOC  Form  5,  the  Intake  Question-
naire is not  labeled  a "Charge of Discrimination," see  id., at 
275.  In  fact  the  wording  of  the  questionnaire  suggests  the 
opposite:  that  the  form's  purpose  is  to  facilitate  "pre-charge 
filing  counseling"  and  to  enable  the  agency  to  determine 
whether it has jurisdiction over "potential charges."  Id., at 
265.  There might be instances where the indicated discrimi-
nation  is  so  clear  or  pervasive  that  the  agency  could  infer 
from the allegations themselves that action is requested and 
required, but the agency is not required to treat every com-
pleted Intake Questionnaire as a charge. 

In this case, however, the completed questionnaire filed in 
December  2001  was  supplemented  with  a  detailed  six-page 
affidavit.  At the end of the last page, respondent asked the 
agency  to  "[p]lease  force  Federal  Express  to  end  their  age 
discrimination  plan  so  we  can  finish  out  our  careers  absent 
the  unfairness  and hostile  work  environment  created within 
their  application  of  Best  Practice/High-Velocity  Culture 
Change."  Id.,  at  273.  This  is  properly  construed  as  a  re-
quest for the agency to act. 

Petitioner  says  that,  in  context,  the  statement  is  ambigu-
ous.  It points to respondent's accompanying statement that 
"I have been given assurances by an Agent of the U. S. Equal 
Employment  Opportunity  Commission  that  this  Affidavit 
will be considered confidential by the United States Govern-
ment  and  will  not  be  disclosed  as  long  as  the  case  remains 
open  unless  it  becomes  necessary  for  the  Government  to 
produce  the  affidavit  in  a  formal  proceeding."  Id.,  at  266. 
Petitioner argues that if respondent intended the affidavit to

406  FEDERAL  EXPRESS  CORP.  v.  HOLOWECKI 

Opinion of the Court 
be kept confidential, she could not have expected the agency to  treat  it  as  a  charge.  This  reads  too  much  into  the  as-

surance  of  nondisclosure.  Respondent  did  not  request  the agency  to  avoid  contacting  her  employer.  She  stated  only 
her understanding that the affidavit itself would be kept con-fidential.  Even then, she gave consent for the agency to dis-
close  the  affidavit  in  a  "formal  proceeding."  Furthermore, respondent checked a box on the Intake Questionnaire giving 
consent  for  the  agency  to  disclose  her  identity  to  the  em-ployer. 

Id., at 265.  Here the combination of the waiver and respondent's request  in the  affidavit that  the  agency "force" 

the employer to stop discriminating against her were enough to  bring  the  entire  filing  within  the  definition  of  charge  we 
adopt here. Petitioner notes that respondent did file a Form 5 (a formal 
charge) with the EEOC but only after she filed her complaint in  the  District  Court.  This  shows,  petitioner  argues,  that 
respondent  did  not  intend  the  earlier  December  2001  filing to  be  a  charge;  otherwise,  there  would  have  been  no  reason 
for  the  later  filing.  What matters, however,  is  whether  the documents  filed  in  December  2001  should  be  interpreted  as 
a request for the agency to act.  Postfiling conduct does not nullify an earlier, proper charge. 

Documents filed by an employee with the EEOC should be construed, to the extent consistent with permissible rules of 
interpretation,  to  protect  the  employee's  rights  and  statu-tory  remedies.  Construing  ambiguities  against  the  drafter 
may  be  the  more  efficient  rule  to  encourage  precise  expres-sion  in  other  contexts;  here,  however,  the  rule  would  un-
dermine  the  remedial  scheme  Congress  adopted.  It  would encourage  individuals  to  avoid  filing  errors  by  retaining 
counsel,  increasing  both  the  cost  and  likelihood  of  litigation.

Opinion of the Court 
worksheets.  Congress,  in  most  cases,  delegates  the  format and design of these instruments to the agencies that adminis-

ter the relevant laws and processes.  An assumption under-lying  the  congressional  decision  to  delegate  rulemaking  and 
enforcement  authority  to  the  agency,  and  the  consequent judicial  rule  of  deference  to  the  agency's  determinations, 
is  that  the  agency  will  take  all  efforts  to  ensure  that  af-
fected  parties  will  receive  the  full  benefits  and  protections of  the  law.  Here,  because  the  agency  failed  to  treat  re-

spondent's  filing  as a  charge  in  the  first  instance,  both  sides lost  the  benefits  of  the  ADEA's  informal  dispute  resolution 
process. The  employer's  interests,  in  particular,  were  given  short 
shrift,  for  it was  not  notified  of respondent's  complaint until 
she filed suit.  The court that hears the merits of this litiga-
tion  can  attempt  to  remedy  this  deficiency  by  staying  the 
proceedings to allow an opportunity for conciliation and set-
tlement.  True, that remedy would be imperfect.  Once the 
adversary  process  has  begun  a  dispute  may  be  in  a  more 
rigid  cast  than  if  conciliation  had  been  attempted  at  the 
outset. 

This  result  is  unfortunate,  but,  at  least  in  this  case,  un-
avoidable.  While courts will use their powers to fashion the 
best  relief  possible  in  situations  like  this  one,  the  ultimate 
responsibility  for  establishing  a  clearer,  more  consistent 
process lies with the agency.  The agency already has made 
some  changes  to  the  charge-filing  process.  See  Brief  for 
United States  as Amicus  Curiae  3,  n. 2  (noting that  the  In-
take  Questionnaire  form  respondent  filed  has  been  replaced 
with a reworded form).  To reduce the risk of further misun-
derstandings  by  those  who  seek  its  assistance,  the  agency 
should determine, in the first instance, what additional revi-
sions in its forms and processes are necessary or appropriate. 

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. 

It is so ordered.

bution of property" that is "made by a corporation to a share-holder with respect  to  its stock shall  be  treated in the  man-

ner provided in [$ 301(c)]."  Under $ 301(c), the portion of the distribution that is a "dividend," as defined by $ 316(a), must 
be  included  in  the  recipient's  gross  income;  and  the  portion that is not a dividend is, depending on the shareholder's basis 
for  his  stock,  either  a  nontaxable  return  of  capital  or  a  gain on  the  sale  or  exchange  of  stock,  ordinarily  taxable  to  the 
shareholder as a capital gain.  Finally, $ 316(a) defines "divi-dend" as 

"any  distribution  of  property  made  by  a  corporation  to its shareholders-- 

"(1)  out  of  its  earnings  and  profits  accumulated  after February 28, 1913, or 
"(2)  out of its earnings and profits of the taxable year (computed  as  of  the  close  of  the  taxable  year  without 
diminution  by  reason  of  any  distributions  made  during the  taxable  year),  without  regard  to  the  amount  of  the 
earnings  and  profits  at  the  time  the  distribution  was made." 

Sections  301  and  316(a) together  thus  make the  existence  of "earnings  and  profits"

responding  contemporaneous  intent  sits  uncomfortably  not only with the tax law's economic realism, but with the partic-

ular wording of $$ 301 and 316(a), as well.  As those sections are written, the tax consequences of a "distribution by a cor-
poration  with  respect  to  its  stock"  depend,  not  on  anyone's purpose  to  return  capital  or  to  get  it  back,  but  on  facts 
wholly  independent  of  intent:  whether  the  corporation  had 
earnings and profits, and the  amount of the  taxpayer's basis for his stock.  Cf.

not  exceed  the  taxpayer-shareholder's  basis  for  his  stock. Thus  the  fact  that  a  shareholder  distributee  of  a  successful

follows from the way $$ 301 and 316(a) are written (to distin-guish  dividend  from  capital  return),  and  from  the  require-
ment of tax deficiency for a $ 7201  crime.  Without the  defi-ciency  there  is  nothing  but  some  act  expressing  the  will  to 
evade, and, under $ 7201, acting on "bad intentions, alone, [is] not  punishable,"

does  not  violate  $ 7201  by  paying  no  tax  on  the  moneys  re-ceived,  intent  being  beside  the  point.  And  since  intent  to 

make  a  distribution  a  taxable  one  cannot  control,  it  would be  odd  to  condition  nontaxable  return-of-capital  treatment 
on  contemporaneous  intent,  when  the  statute  says  nothing about intent at all. 

The intent interpretation is strange for another reason, too (a  reason  in  some  tension  with  the  Ninth  Circuit's  assump-
tion  that  an  unreported  distribution  without  contempora-neous  intent  to  return  capital  will  support  a  conviction  for 
evasion).  The  text  of  $ 301(a)  ostensibly  provides  for  all variations of tax treatment of distributions received with re-
spect  to  a  corporation's  stock  unless  a  separate  provision  of the  Code  requires  otherwise.  Yet

tive  alternative  to  California's  system  because  it  would  not  nominate 
candidates--is  not  dispositive  here.  There,  the  Court  had  no  occasion 
to determine whether a primary system that indicates each candidate's 
party preference on the ballot, in effect, chooses the parties' nominees. 
Respondents' arguments that I-872 imposes a severe burden are flawed. 
They  claim  that  the  law  is  unconstitutional  under  Jones  because  it 
allows  primary  voters  unaffiliated  with  a  party  to  choose  the  party's 
nominee,  thus  violating  the  party's  right  to  choose  its  own  standard 
bearer.  Unlike  California's  primary,  however,  the  I-872  primary  does 
not,  by its  terms, choose  the parties'  nominees.  The choice  of  a  party 
representative does not occur under I-872.  The two top primary candi-
dates  proceed  to  the  general  election  regardless  of  their  party  prefer-
ences.  Whether  the  parties  nominate their  own  candidate  outside  the 
state-run primary  is  irrelevant.  Respondents  counter that  voters will 
assume that candidates on the general election ballot are their preferred 
nominees;  and  that  even  if  voters  do  not  make  that  assumption,  they 
will at least assume that the parties associate with, and approve of, the 
nominees.  However, those claims depend not on any facial requirement 
of  I-872,  but  on  the  possibility  that  voters  will  be  confused  as  to  the 
meaning of the party-preference designation.  This is sheer speculation. 
Even if  voters could  possibly misinterpret the designations, I-872 can-
not  be  struck  down  in  a  facial  challenge  based  on  the  mere  possibility 
of  voter  confusion.  The  State  could  implement  I-872  in  a  variety  of 
ways,  e. g.,  through  ballot  design,  that  would  eliminate  any  real  threat 
of  confusion.  And  without  the  specter  of  widespread  voter  confusion, 
respondents'  forced  association  and  compelled  speech  arguments  fall 
flat.  Pp. 451-458. 

(c)  Because  I-872  does  not  severely  burden  respondents,  the  State 
need not assert a compelling interest.  Its interest in providing voters 
with  relevant  information  about  the  candidates  on  the  ballot  is  easily 
sufficient to sustain the provision.  P. 458.

Opinion of the Court 

I 
For  most  of  the  past  century,  Washington  voters  selected nominees for state and local offices using a blanket primary.

1 

From 1935 until 2003, the State used a blanket primary that placed  candidates  from  all  parties on  one  ballot  and  allowed 

voters to select a candidate from any party.  See 1935 Wash. Laws  $$ 1-5,  pp.  60-64.  Under  this  system,  the  candidate 
who won a plurality of votes within each major party became that  party's  nominee  in  the  general  election.  See  2003 
Wash. Laws $ 919, p. 775. California used  a nearly identical primary in its own elec-
tions  until  our  decision  in  California  Democratic  Party  v. Jones,  530  U. S.  567  (2000).  In  Jones,  four  political  parties 
challenged  California's  blanket  primary,  arguing  that  it  un-constitutionally  burdened  their  associational  rights  by  forc-
ing  them  to  associate  with  voters  who  did  not  share  their beliefs.  We agreed and struck down the blanket primary as 
inconsistent  with  the  First  Amendment.  In  so  doing,  we emphasized  the  importance  of  the  nomination  process  as 
" `the crucial juncture at which the appeal to common princi-ples  may  be  translated  into  concerted  action,  and  hence  to 
political  power  in  the  community.' "  Id.,  at  575  (quoting 
Tashjian  v.  Republican  Party  of  Conn.,  479  U. S.  208,  216 (1986)).  We observed that a party's right to exclude is cen-

tral  to its  freedom of association,  and is  never  "more  impor-tant than in the process of selecting its nominee."  530 U. S., 
at 575.  California's blanket primary, we concluded, severely burdened  the  parties'  freedom  of  association  because  it 

1 The term "blanket  primary"  refers to a system in  which "any  person, 
regardless of party affiliation, may vote for a party's nominee."  Califor-
nia Democratic Party v.  Jones, 530 U. S. 567, 576, n. 6 (2000).  A blanket 
primary  is  distinct  from  an  "open  primary,"  in  which  a  person  may  vote 
for  any  party's  nominees,  but  must  choose  among  that  party's  nominees 
for  all  offices,  ibid.,  and  the  more  traditional  "closed  primary,"  in  which 
"only persons  who are  members  of the political  party . .  .  can vote on  its 
nominee," id., at 570.

Opinion of the Court 

forced them to allow nonmembers to participate in selecting the  parties'  nominees.  That  the  parties  retained  the  right 

to endorse their preferred candidates did not render the bur-den  any less  severe,  as "[t]here  is  simply  no  substitute for  a 
party's selecting its own candidates."  Id., at 581. Because  California's  blanket  primary  severely  burdened 
the  parties'  associational  rights,  we  subjected  it  to  strict scrutiny,  carefully  examining  each  of  the  state  interests  of-
fered  by  California  in  support  of  its  primary  system.  We rejected as illegitimate three of the asserted interests: "pro-
ducing elected officials who better represent the electorate," "expanding  candidate  debate  beyond  the  scope  of  partisan 
concerns,"  and  ensuring  "the  right  to  an  effective  vote"  by allowing nonmembers of a party to vote in the majority par-
ty's primary in " `safe' " districts.  Id., at 582-584.  We con-cluded that the  remaining interests--promoting fairness, af-
fording voters greater choice, increasing voter participation, and protecting privacy--were not compelling on the facts of 
the case.  Even if they were, the partisan California primary was not narrowly tailored to further those interests because 
a  nonpartisan  blanket  primary,  in  which  the  top  two  vote-getters  advance  to  the  general  election  regardless  of  party 
affiliation,  would  accomplish  each  of  those  interests  without burdening the parties'  associational  rights. 

Id., at 585-586. The nonpartisan blanket primary had "all the characteristics 

of  the  partisan  blanket  primary,  save  the  constitutionally crucial  one:  Primary  voters  [were]  not  choosing  a  party's 
nominee."  Ibid. After  our  decision  in  Jones,  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  the 
Ninth Circuit struck down Washington's primary as "materi-ally  indistinguishable  from  the  California  scheme."  Demo-
cratic  Party  of  Washington  State  v.  Reed,  343  F.  3d  1198, 1203  (2003).  The  Washington  State  Grange

posed  I-872  as  a  replacement.3  It  passed  with  nearly  60% of the vote and became effective in December 2004. 

Under  I-872,  all  elections  for  "partisan  offices" 4  are  con-ducted  in  two  stages: a primary and  a  general election.  To 
participate  in  the  primary,  a  candidate  must  file  a  "declara-tion  of  candidacy"  form,  on  which  he  declares  his  "major  or 
minor party preference, or independent status."  Wash. Rev. Code  $ 29A.24.030  (Supp.  2005).  Each  candidate  and  his 
party  preference  (or  independent  status)  is  in  turn  desig-nated on the primary election ballot.  A political party can-
not  prevent  a  candidate  who  is  unaffiliated  with,  or  even repugnant  to,  the  party  from  designating  it  as  his  party  of 
preference.  See App. 396-397, 595 (declaration of James K. Pharris,  Exhibit  C:  Ruling  Order,  May  18,  2005,  Wash. 
Admin.  Code  $ 434-215-015).  In  the  primary  election,  vot-ers may select "any candidate listed on the ballot, regardless 
of the party preference of the candidates or the voter."  Id., at 606, $ 434-262-012. 

The  candidates  with  the  highest  and  second-highest  vote totals  advance  to  the  general  election,  regardless  of  their 

cated  a  variety  of  goals,  including women's  suffrage, rural  electrification, 
protection of water resources, and universal telephone service.  The State 
Grange  also  supported  the  Washington  constitutional  amendment  estab-
lishing  initiatives  and  referendums  and  sponsored  the  1934  blanket  pri-
mary initiative. 

3 Respondents  make  much  of  the  fact  that  the  promoters  of  I-872  pre-

sented it  to Washington voters as a way to preserve  the primary system 
in  place  from  1935  to  2003.  But  our  task  is  not  to  judge  I-872  based 
on  its  promoters'  assertions  about  its  similarity,  or  lack  thereof,  to  the 
unconstitutional primary; we must evaluate the constitutionality of I-872 
on its own terms.  Whether the language of I-872 was purposely drafted 
to  survive  a  Jones-type  constitutional  challenge  is  irrelevant  to  whether 
it has successfully done so. 

4 " `Partisan office' means a public office for which a candidate may indi-

cate a political party preference on his or her declaration of candidacy and 
have that preference appear on the primary and general election ballot in 
conjunction with his or her name."  Wash. Rev. Code $ 29A.04.110 (Supp. 
2005).

party  preferences.  Ibid.  Thus,  the  general  election  may pit  two  candidates  with  the  same  party  preference  against 

one  another.5  Each  candidate's  party  preference  is  listed on  the  general  election  ballot,  and  may  not  be  changed  be-
tween  the  primary  and  general  elections.  See  id.,  at  601, $ 434-230-040. 

Immediately after the State enacted regulations to imple-ment  I-872,  the  Washington  State  Republican  Party  filed 
suit against a number of county auditors challenging the law on  its  face.  The  party  contended  that  the  new  system  vio-
lates  its  associational  rights  by  usurping  its  right  to  nomi-nate  its  own  candidates  and  by  forcing  it  to  associate  with 
candidates it does not endorse.  The Washington State Dem-ocratic  Central  Committee  and  Libertarian  Party  of  Wash-
ington  State  joined  the  suit  as  plaintiffs.  The  Washington State  Grange  joined  as  a  defendant,  and  the  State  of  Wash-
ington was substituted for the county auditors as defendant. The United States District Court for the Western District of 
Washington  granted  the  political  parties'  motions  for  sum-mary  judgment  and  enjoined  the  implementation  of  I-872. 
See  Washington  State  Republican  Party  v.  Logan,  377 F. Supp. 2d 907, 932 (2005). 

The Court of Appeals affirmed.  460 F. 3d 1108, 1125 (CA9 2006).  It held that  the I-872  primary severely  burdens the 
political  parties'  associational  rights  because  the  party-preference  designation  on  the  ballot  creates  a  risk  that  pri-
mary winners will be perceived as the parties' nominees and produces  an  "impression  of  associatio[n]"  between  a  candi-
date  and  his  party  of  preference  even  when  the  party  does not  associate,  or  wish  to  be  associated,  with  the  candidate.

that, had the 1996 gubernatorial primary been conducted under the I-872 
system,  two  Democratic  candidates  and  no  Republican  candidate  would 
have  advanced  from  the  primary  to  the  general  election.  See  460  F.  3d 
1108, 1114, n. 8 (CA9 2006).

significant distinction between ballots and other vehicles for political expression," reasoning that the risk of perceived as-

sociation  is  particularly  acute  when  ballots  include  party labels  because  such  labels  are  typically  used  to  designate 
candidates'  views  on  issues  of  public  concern.  Id.,  at  1121. And  it  determined  that  the  State's  interests  underlying 
I-872  were  not  sufficiently  compelling  to  justify  the  severe burden on the parties' association.  Concluding that the pro-
visions  of I-872  providing  for  the  party-preference  designa-tion on the ballot were not severable, the court struck down 
I-872 in its entirety. We  granted  certiorari,  549  U. S.  1251 (2007),  to determine 
whether I-872, on its face, violates the political parties' asso-ciational rights. 

II 
Respondents object to I-872 not in the context of an actual election,  but  in  a  facial  challenge.  Under  United  States  v. 

Salerno,  481  U. S.  739  (1987),  a  plaintiff  can  only  succeed  in a  facial  challenge  by  "establish[ing]  that  no  set  of  circum-
stances exists under which the Act would be valid," i. e., that the  law  is  unconstitutional  in  all  of  its  applications.  Id.,  at 
745.  While  some  Members  of the  Court  have  criticized  the 
Salerno  formulation,  all  agree  that  a  facial  challenge  must fail  where  the  statute  has  a  " `plainly  legitimate  sweep.' "

valid, we must be careful not to go beyond the statute's facial requirements  and  speculate  about  "hypothetical"  or  "imagi-

nary"  cases.  See  United  States  v.  Raines,  362  U. S.  17,  22 (1960)  ("The  delicate  power  of  pronouncing  an  Act  of  Con-
gress  unconstitutional  is  not  to  be  exercised  with  reference to  hypothetical  cases  thus  imagined").  The  State  has  had 
no  opportunity  to  implement  I-872,  and  its  courts  have  had no  occasion  to  construe  the  law  in  the  context  of  actual  dis-
putes arising from the electoral context, or to accord the law a  limiting  construction  to  avoid  constitutional  questions. 
Cf.  Yazoo  &  Mississippi  Valley  R.  Co.  v.  Jackson  Vinegar 
Co., 226 U. S. 217, 220 (1912) ("How the state court may apply [a statute] to other cases, whether its general words may be 

treated  as  more  or  less  restrained,  and  how  far  parts  of  it may  be  sustained  if  others  fail  are  matters  upon  which  we 
need not speculate now").  Exercising judicial restraint in a facial  challenge  "frees  the  Court  not  only  from  unnecessary 
pronouncement  on  constitutional  issues,  but  also  from  pre-mature interpretations  of statutes  in  areas where  their  con-
stitutional  application  might  be  cloudy."  Raines,  supra, at 22. 

Facial  challenges  are  disfavored  for  several  reasons. Claims  of  facial  invalidity  often  rest  on  speculation.  As  a 
consequence,  they  raise  the  risk  of  "premature  interpreta-tion of statutes on the basis of factually barebones records." 
Sabri  v.  United  States,  541  U. S.  600,  609  (2004)  (internal quotation  marks  and  brackets  omitted).  Facial  challenges 
also run contrary to the fundamental principle of judicial re-straint  that  courts  should  neither  " `anticipate  a  question  of 
constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it' " nor  " `formulate  a  rule  of  constitutional  law  broader  than  is 
required  by  the  precise  facts  to  which  it  is  to  be  applied.' " Ashwander  v.  TVA, 297  U. S.  288,  346-347  (1936)  (Brandeis,

the  democratic  process  by  preventing  laws  embodying  the will of  the people from  being implemented  in  a  manner  con-
sistent  with  the  Constitution.  We  must  keep  in  mind  that " `[a] ruling of unconstitutionality frustrates the intent of the

ity  opinion)).  It  is  with  these  principles  in  view  that  we turn  to  the  merits  of  respondents'  facial  challenge  to  I-872.

The  States  possess  a  " `broad  power  to  prescribe  the "Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators 

and  Representatives,"  Art.  I,  $ 4,  cl.  1,  which  power  is matched  by  state  control  over  the  election  process  for  state

Cities  Area  New  Party,  520  U. S.  351,  358  (1997)  (same). This  power  is  not  absolute,  but  is  "subject  to  the  limita-
tion  that  [it]  may  not  be  exercised  in  a  way  that  violates .  .  .  specific  provisions  of  the  Constitution." 

Williams  v. Rhodes, 393 U. S. 23, 29 (1968).  In particular, the State has 

the  " `responsibility  to  observe  the  limits  established  by  the First  Amendment  rights  of  the  State's  citizens,' "  including 
the  freedom  of  political  association.  Eu  v.  San  Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 222 (1989)

ling  state  interest."  Clingman,  supra,  at  586;  see  also

freedoms' "  (quoting  NAACP  v.  Button,  371  U. S.  415,  438 
(1963))).  If  a  statute  imposes  only  modest  burdens,  how-
ever,  then  "the  State's  important  regulatory  interests  are 
generally  sufficient  to  justify  reasonable,  nondiscriminatory 
restrictions"  on  election  procedures.  Anderson  v.  Cele-
brezze,  460  U. S.  780,  788  (1983).  "Accordingly,  we  have  re-
peatedly  upheld  reasonable,  politically  neutral  regulations 
that  have  the  effect  of  channeling  expressive activity  at  the 
polls."  Burdick v.  Takushi, 504 U. S. 428, 438 (1992). 

The parties do not dispute these general principles; rather, 
they  disagree  about  whether  I-872  severely  burdens  re-
spondents'  associational  rights.  That  disagreement  begins 
with Jones.  Petitioners argue that the I-872 primary is in-
distinguishable  from  the  alternative  Jones  suggested  would 
be  constitutional.  In  Jones  we  noted  that  a  nonpartisan 
blanket  primary,  where  the  top  two  votegetters  proceed  to 
the  general election  regardless of  their  party, was  a  less  re-
strictive  alternative  to  California's  system  because  such  a 
primary  does  not  nominate  candidates.  530  U. S.,  at  585- 
586 (The nonpartisan blanket primary "has all the character-
istics of  the  partisan  blanket  primary,  save  the  constitution-
ally  crucial  one:  Primary  voters  are  not  choosing  a  party's 
nominee").  Petitioners  are  correct  that  we  assumed  that 
the nonpartisan primary we described in Jones would be con-
stitutional.  But that is not dispositive here because we had 
no occasion in Jones to determine whether a primary system 
that  indicates  each  candidate's  party  preference  on  the  bal-
lot, in effect, chooses the parties' nominees. 

That  question  is  now  squarely  before  us.  Respondents 
argue  that  I-872  is  unconstitutional  under  Jones  because  it 
has the same "constitutionally crucial" infirmity that doomed 
California's  blanket  primary:  It  allows  primary  voters  who 
are  unaffiliated  with  a  party  to  choose  the  party's  nominee. 
Respondents claim that candidates who progress to the gen-
eral election under  I-872 will become the  de facto  nominees

of the parties they prefer, thereby violating the parties' right to  choose  their  own  standard  bearers,  see  Timmons,  supra, 

at 359, and altering their messages.  They rely on our state-ment  in  Jones  reaffirming  "the  special  place  the  First 
Amendment  reserves  for,  and  the  special  protection  it  ac-cords,  the  process  by  which  a  political  party  `select[s]  a 
standard  bearer  who  best  represents  the  party's  ideologies and  preferences.' " 

Jones,  530  U. S.,  at  575  (quoting  Eu, supra, at 224). 

The  flaw  in  this  argument  is  that,  unlike  the  California primary,  the  I-872  primary  does  not,  by  its  terms,  choose 
parties'  nominees.  The  essence  of  nomination--the  choice of a party representative--does not occur under I-872.  The 
law never refers to the candidates as nominees of any party, nor  does  it  treat  them  as  such.  To  the  contrary,  the  elec-
tion  regulations  specifically  provide  that  the  primary  "does not  serve  to  determine  the  nominees  of  a  political  party 
but  serves  to  winnow  the  number  of  candidates  to  a  final list of two for the general election."  App. 606, Wash. Admin. 
Code  $ 434-262-012.  The  top  two  candidates  from  the primary  election  proceed  to  the  general  election  regard-
less  of  their  party  preferences.  Whether  parties  nominate their  own  candidates  outside  the  state-run  primary  is  sim-
ply  irrelevant.  In  fact,  parties  may  now  nominate  can-didates  by  whatever  mechanism  they  choose  because  I-872 
repealed  Washington's  prior  regulations  governing  party nominations.

7 It  is  true  that  parties  may  no  longer  indicate  their  nominees  on  the 
ballot,  but  that  is  unexceptionable:  The  First  Amendment  does  not  give 
political parties a right to have their nominees designated as such on the 
ballot.  See Timmons v.  Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U. S. 351, 362- 
363 (1997) ("We are unpersuaded, however, by the party's contention that 
it has  a  right  to use  the  ballot  itself  to  send a  particularized message,  to 
its  candidate  and  to  the  voters,  about  the  nature  of  its  support  for  the 
candidate").  Parties  do  not  gain  such  a  right  simply  because  the  State

454  WASHINGTON  STATE  GRANGE  v.  WASHINGTON 

STATE  REPUBLICAN  PARTY 

Opinion of the Court 

Respondents counter  that, even if the  I-872 primary does 
not  actually  choose  parties'  nominees,  it  nevertheless  bur-
dens  their  associational  rights  because  voters  will  assume 
that  candidates  on  the  general  election  ballot  are  the  nomi-
nees of their preferred parties.  This brings us to the heart 
of respondents' case--and to the fatal flaw in their argument. 
At bottom, respondents' objection to I-872 is that voters will 
be  confused  by  candidates'  party-preference  designations. 
Respondents'  arguments  are  largely  variations  on  this 
theme.  Thus, they  argue that even if voters do not assume 
that  candidates  on  the  general  election  ballot  are  the  nomi-
nees of their  parties, they  will at least  assume that  the  par-
ties  associate  with,  and  approve  of,  them.  This,  they  say, 
compels  them  to  associate  with  candidates  they  do  not  en-
dorse,  alters  the  messages  they  wish  to  convey, and  forces 
them  to  engage  in  counterspeech  to  disassociate  themselves 
from the candidates and their positions on the issues. 

We  reject  each  of  these  contentions  for  the  same  reason: 
They all depend, not on any facial requirement of I-872, but 
on the possibility that voters will be confused as to the mean-
ing  of  the  party-preference  designation.  But  respondents' 
assertion  that  voters  will  misinterpret  the  party-preference 
designation  is  sheer  speculation.  It  "depends  upon  the  be-
lief  that  voters  can  be  `misled'  by  party  labels.  But  `[o]ur 
cases reflect a greater faith in the ability of individual voters 
to  inform  themselves  about  campaign  issues.' "  Tashjian, 
479  U. S.,  at  220  (quoting  Anderson,  supra,  at  797). 
There  is  simply  no  basis  to  presume  that  a  well-informed 
electorate  will  interpret  a  candidate's  party-preference  des-
ignation  to  mean  that  the  candidate  is  the  party's  chosen 
nominee  or  representative  or  that  the  party  associates  with 
or  approves  of  the  candidate.  See  New  York  State  Clubn

record  before  us,  which  contains  no  specific  evidence  on  the characteristics  of 

any  club  covered  by  the  [l]aw").  This 
strikes  us as especially true here, given  that it was the  vot-ers of Washington themselves, rather than their elected rep-

resentatives, who enacted I-872. Of  course,  it  is 

possible  that  voters  will  misinterpret  the 
candidates'  party-preference  designations  as  reflecting  en-
dorsement  by  the  parties.  But  these  cases  involve  a  facial challenge, and we cannot strike down I-872 on its face based 

on  the  mere  possibility  of  voter  confusion.  See  Yazoo,  226 
U. S.,  at  219  ("[T]his  court  must  deal  with  the  case  in  hand

as  a  facial  challenge,  we  have  no  evidentiary  record  against 
which to assess their assertions that voters will be confused.

Opinion of the Court 

more  than  speculate  in  this  facial  challenge--we  must,  in fairness  to  the  voters  of  the  State  of  Washington  who 

enacted I-872 and in deference to the executive and judicial officials  who are  charged  with  implementing it,  ask whether 
the  ballot  could  conceivably  be  printed  in  such  a  way  as  to eliminate  the  possibility  of  widespread  voter  confusion  and 
with  it  the  perceived  threat  to  the  First  Amendment.  See 
Ayotte, 546 U. S., at 329 (noting that courts should not nullify more of a state law than necessary so as to avoid frustrating 

the  intent  of  the  people  and  their  duly  elected  representa-tives); Ward v.  Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 795-796 
(1989)  (" `[I]n  evaluating  a  facial  challenge  to  a  state  law,  a federal court must . . . consider any limiting construction that 
a state court or enforcement agency has proffered' " (quoting 
Hoffman  Estates  v.  Flipside,  Hoffman  Estates,  Inc.,  455 U. S. 489, 494, n. 5 (1982))). 

It  is  not  difficult  to  conceive  of  such  a  ballot.  For  exam-ple,  petitioners  propose  that  the  actual  I-872  ballot  could 
include  prominent  disclaimers  explaining  that  party  prefer-ence  reflects  only  the  self-designation  of  the  candidate  and 
not an official endorsement by the party.  They also suggest that the ballots might note preference in the form of a candi-
date statement that emphasizes  the candidate's personal de-termination  rather  than  the  party's  acceptance  of the  candi-
date, such as "my party preference is the Republican Party." Additionally,  the  State  could  decide  to  educate  the  public 
about  the  new  primary  ballots  through  advertising  or  ex-planatory  materials  mailed  to  voters  along  with  their  bal-
lots.8  We  are  satisfied  that  there  are  a  variety  of  ways  in which the State could implement I-872 that would eliminate 
any  real  threat  of  voter  confusion.  And  without  the  spec-

by  mail  ballot  rather  than  at  in-person  polling  places.  See  Wash.  Rev.

by mail.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 11.

Our conclusion that these implementations of I-872 would be consistent with the First Amendment is fatal to respond-

ents'  facial  challenge.  See  Schall  v.  Martin,  467  U. S.  253, 264  (1984)  (a  facial  challenge  fails  where  "at  least  some" 
constitutional  applications  exist).  Each  of  their  arguments rests on factual assumptions about voter confusion, and each 
fails for the same reason: In the absence of evidence, we can-not  assume  that  Washington's  voters  will  be  misled.  See

factual  determination  must  await  an  as-applied  challenge. On its face, I-872 does  not impose  any severe  burden on  re-

spondents' associational rights. 

B 
Because  we  have  concluded  that  I-872  does  not  severely burden  respondents,  the  State  need  not  assert  a  compelling 

interest.  See  Clingman,  544  U. S.,  at  593  ("When  a  state electoral  provision  places  no  heavy  burden  on  associational 
rights,  `a  State's important  regulatory  interests will usually be  enough  to  justify  reasonable,  nondiscriminatory  restric-
tions' "  (quoting  Timmons,  520  U. S.,  at  358)).  The  State's asserted  interest in providing voters  with relevant  informa-
tion  about  the  candidates  on  the  ballot  is  easily  sufficient  to sustain  I-872.  See 

Anderson, 460  U. S.,  at 796  ("There  can be no question about the legitimacy of the State's interest in 

fostering  informed  and  educated  expressions  of  the  popular will in a general election").

Respondents  ask  this  Court  to  invalidate  a  popularly enacted  election  process  that  has  never  been  carried  out. 

Immediately  after  implementing  regulations  were  enacted, respondents obtained a permanent injunction against the en-

the  people.  Because  I-872  does  not  on  its  face  provide  for

ballot access and trademark arguments as they were not addressed below 
and are not encompassed by the question on which we granted certiorari:

P. 479. 

(2)  That  reason--Mr.  Brooks'  student-teaching  obligation--fails 
even  under  the  highly  deferential  standard  of  review  applicable  here. 
Mr.  Brooks was 1  of  more  than 50 venire  members  expressing concern 
that  jury  service  or  sequestration  would  interfere  with  work,  school, 
family, or other obligations.  Although he was initially concerned about 
making  up  lost  teaching  time,  he  expressed  no  further  concern  once  a 
law  clerk  reported  that  the  school's  dean  would  work  with  Mr.  Brooks 
if he missed time for a trial that week, and the prosecutor did not ques-
tion him more deeply about the matter.  The proffered reason must be 
evaluated  in  light  of  the  circumstances  that  the colloquy  and  law  clerk 
report  took  place  on  Tuesday,  the  prosecution  struck  Mr.  Brooks  on 
Wednesday,  the  trial's  guilt  phase  ended  on  Thursday,  and  its  penalty 
phase  ended  on  Friday.  The  prosecutor's  scenario--that  Mr.  Brooks 
would  have  been  inclined  to  find  petitioner  guilty  of  a  lesser  included 
offense to obviate the need for a penalty phase--is both highly specula-
tive and unlikely.  Mr. Brooks would be in a position to shorten the trial 
only if  most  or all of  the  jurors had  favored a lesser  verdict.  Perhaps 
most telling, the trial's brevity, which the prosecutor anticipated on the

Opinion of the Court 
Mr.  Brooks'  university, it  is  apparent that  the  trial occurred relatively  early  in  the  fall  semester.  With  many  weeks  re-

maining in the term, Mr. Brooks would have needed to make up no more than an hour or two per week in order to compen-
sate for the time that he would have lost due to jury service. When  all  of  these  considerations  are  taken  into  account, 
the  prosecutor's  second  proffered  justification  for  striking Mr. Brooks is suspicious. 

The  implausibility  of  this  explanation  is  reinforced  by  the prosecutor's  acceptance  of  white  jurors  who  disclosed  con-
flicting obligations that appear to have been at least as seri-ous as Mr. Brooks'.  We recognize that a retrospective com-
parison  of  jurors  based  on  a  cold  appellate  record  may  be very misleading when alleged similarities were not raised at 
trial.  In  that  situation,  an  appellate  court  must be  mindful that  an  exploration  of  the  alleged  similarities  at  the  time  of 
trial might  have shown  that  the jurors in question were not really comparable.  In this case, however, the shared charac-
teristic,  i.

domestic law because none of the relevant treaty sources--the Optional 
Protocol, the United Nations Charter, or the ICJ Statute--creates bind-
ing federal law in the absence of implementing legislation, and no such 
legislation has been enacted. 

The most natural reading of the Optional Protocol is that it is a bare 
grant of jurisdiction.  The Protocol says nothing about the effect of an 
ICJ  decision,  does  not  commit  signatories  to  comply  therewith,  and  is 
silent as to any enforcement mechanism.  The obligation to comply with 
ICJ  judgments  is  derived  from  Article  94  of  the  U.  N.  Charter,  which 
provides  that  "[e]ach . . .  Member  .  .  .  undertakes  to  comply  with  the 
[ICJ's]  decision  . . . in  any  case  to  which  it  is  a  party."  The  phrase 
"undertakes  to  comply"  is  simply  a  commitment  by  member  states  to 
take future action through their political branches.  That language does 
not indicate that the Senate, in ratifying the Optional Protocol, intended 
to vest ICJ decisions with immediate legal effect in domestic courts. 

This  reading  is  confirmed  by  Article  94(2)--the  enforcement  provi-
sion--which provides the sole remedy for noncompliance: referral to the 
U. N. Security Council by an aggrieved state.  The provision of an ex-
press diplomatic rather than judicial remedy is itself evidence that ICJ 
judgments  were  not  meant  to  be  enforceable  in  domestic  courts.  See 
Sanchez-Llamas,  548  U. S.,  at  347.  Even  this  "quintessentially  inter-
national remed[y]," id., at 355, is not absolute.  It requires a Security 
Council  resolution,  and  the  President  and  Senate  were  undoubtedly 
aware that the United States retained the unqualified right to exercise 
its veto of any such resolution.  Medelli'n's construction would eliminate 
the option of noncompliance contemplated by Article 94(2), undermining 
the  ability  of  the  political  branches  to  determine  whether  and  how  to 
comply with an ICJ judgment. 

The ICJ  Statute, by limiting disputes to those  involving nations, not 
individuals, and by specifying that ICJ decisions have no binding force 
except between those nations, provides further evidence that the Avena 
judgment  does  not  automatically  constitute  federal  law  enforceable  in 
U. S.  courts.  Medelli'n,  an  individual,  cannot  be  considered  a  party  to 
the  Avena  decision.  Finally,  the  United  States'  interpretation  of  a 
treaty  "is  entitled  to  great  weight,"  Sumitomo  Shoji  America,  Inc.  v. 
Avagliano, 457 U. S. 176, 184-185, and the Executive Branch has unfail-
ingly adhered to its view that the relevant treaties do not create domes-
tically enforceable federal law.  Pp. 504-514. 

(b)  The foregoing interpretive approach--parsing a treaty's text to 
determine if it  is self-executing--is hardly novel.  This  Court has long 
looked  to the language of  a treaty  to determine whether the President 
who negotiated it and the Senate that ratified it intended that the treaty

Syllabus 
automatically  create  domestically  enforceable  federal  law.  See,  e. g., 
Foster, supra.  Pp. 514-516. 

(c)  The Court's conclusion  that Avena does not by itself  constitute 
binding federal law is confirmed by the "postratification understanding" 
of  signatory  countries.  See  Zicherman  v.  Korean  Air  Lines  Co.,  516 
U. S.  217,  226.  There  are  currently  47  nations  that  are  parties  to  the 
Optional Protocol and 171 nations that are parties to the Vienna Conven-
tion.  Yet neither Medelli'n nor his amici have identified a single nation 
that  treats  ICJ  judgments  as  binding  in  domestic  courts.  The  lack  of 
any  basis  for  supposing  that  any  other  country  would  treat  ICJ  judg-
ments  as  directly  enforceable  as  a  matter  of  its  domestic  law  strongly 
suggests  that  the  treaty  should  not  be  so  viewed  in  our  courts.  See 
Sanchez-Llamas, 548 U. S., at 343-344, and n. 3. 

The  Court's  conclusion  is  further  supported  by  general  principles  of 
interpretation.  Given that the forum state's procedural rules govern a 
treaty's  implementation  absent  a  clear  and  express  statement  to  the 
contrary, see, e. g., id., at 351, one would expect the ratifying parties to 
the relevant treaties to have clearly stated any intent to give ICJ judg-
ments such effect.  There is no statement in the Optional Protocol, the 
U. N. Charter, or the ICJ Statute that supports this notion.  Moreover, 
the consequences of Medelli'n's argument give pause: neither Texas nor 
this Court may look behind an ICJ decision and quarrel with its reason-
ing  or  result,  despite  this  Court's  holding  in  Sanchez-Llamas  that 
"[n]othing in the [ICJ's] structure or purpose . . . suggests that its inter-
pretations  were  intended  to  be  conclusive  on  our  courts,"  id.,  at  354. 
Pp. 516-519. 

(d)  The Court's holding does not call into question the ordinary en-
forcement of foreign judgments.  An agreement  to abide by the result 
of an international adjudication can be a treaty obligation like any other, 
so long  as the agreement  is consistent with  the Constitution.  In addi-
tion, Congress is up to the task of implementing non-self-executing trea-
ties, even those involving complex commercial disputes.  Medelli'n con-
tends  that  domestic  courts  generally  give  effect  to  foreign  judgments, 
but the judgment Medelli'n asks us to enforce is hardly typical: It would 
enjoin  the  operation  of  state  law  and  force  the  State  to  take  action  to 
"review  and  reconside[r]"  his  case.  Foreign  judgments  awarding  in-
junctive  relief  against  private  parties,  let  alone  sovereign  States,  "are 
not generally entitled to enforcement."  1 Restatement (Third) of For-
eign  Relations  Law  of  the  United  States  $ 481,  Comment  b,  p.  595

States  to  provide  review  and  reconsideration  of  the  claims  of  the  51

Syllabus 
Mexican  nationals  named  in  Avena  without  regard  to  state  procedural 
default rules.  Pp. 523-532. 

(a)  The President seeks to vindicate plainly compelling interests in 
ensuring the reciprocal observance of the Vienna Convention, protecting 
relations with foreign governments, and demonstrating  commitment to 
the role of international law.  But those interests do not allow the Court 
to  set  aside  first  principles.  The  President's  authority  to  act,  as  with 
the exercise of any governmental power, "must stem either from an act 
of Congress or from the Constitution itself."  Youngstown Sheet & Tube 
Co.  v.  Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 585. 

Justice  Jackson's  familiar  tripartite  scheme  provides  the  accepted 
framework for evaluating executive action in this area.  First, "[w]hen 
the  President  acts  pursuant  to  an  express  or  implied  authorization  of 
Congress,  his  authority  is  at  its  maximum,  for  it  includes  all  that  he 
possesses  in  his  own  right  plus  all  that  Congress  can  delegate."  Id., 
at  635 (Jackson, J.,  concurring).  Second,  "[w]hen the President  acts in 
absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority, he can only 
rely upon his own independent powers, but there is a zone of twilight in 
which  he  and  Congress  may have  concurrent  authority,  or  in  which  its 
distribution  is uncertain."  Id., at 637.  In such  a circumstance, Presi-
dential  authority  can  derive  support  from  "congressional  inertia,  indif-
ference  or  quiescence."  Ibid.  Finally,  "[w]hen  the  President  takes 
measures  incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, 
his  power  is  at  its  lowest  ebb,"  and  the  Court  can  sustain  his  actions 
"only by disabling the Congress from acting upon the subject."  Id., at 
637-638.  Pp. 523-525. 

(b)  The  United  States  marshals  two  principal  arguments  in  favor 
of  the  President's  authority  to  establish  binding  rules  of  decision  that 
pre-empt  contrary  state  law.  The  United  States  argues  that  the  rele-
vant treaties give the President the authority to implement the Avena 
judgment and that Congress has acquiesced  in the exercise of such au-
thority.  The United  States  also  relies upon  an  "independent"  interna-
tional  dispute-resolution  power.  We  find  these  arguments,  as  well  as 
Medelli'n's  additional  argument  that  the  President's  Memorandum  is  a 
valid  exercise  of  his  "Take  Care"  power,  unpersuasive.  Pp.  525-532. 

(i)  The  United  States  maintains  that  the  President's  Memoran-
dum  is  implicitly  authorized  by  the  Optional  Protocol  and  the  U.  N. 
Charter.  But the responsibility for transforming an international obli-
gation  arising  from  a  non-self-executing  treaty  into  domestic  law  falls 
to  Congress,  not  the  Executive.  Foster,  2  Pet.,  at  315.  It  is  a  funda-
mental constitutional principle that " `[t]he power to make the necessary 
laws is in Congress; the power to execute in the President.' "  Hamdan

tion,  is  one  that  was  ratified  with  the  understanding  that  it  is  not  to 
have  domestic  effect  of  its  own  force.  That  understanding  precludes 
the  assertion  that  Congress  has  implicitly  authorized  the  President-- 
acting  on  his  own--to  achieve  precisely  the  same  result.  Accordingly, 
the  President's  Memorandum  does  not  fall  within  the  first  category  of 
the  Youngstown  framework.  Indeed,  because  the  non-self-executing 
character  of  the  relevant  treaties  not  only  refutes  the  notion  that  the 
ratifying parties vested the President with the authority to unilaterally 
make  treaty  obligations  binding  on  domestic  courts,  but  also  implicitly 
prohibits  him  from  doing  so,  the  President's  assertion  of  authority  is 
within Youngstown's third category, not the first or even the second. 

The United States maintains that congressional acquiescence requires 
that the President's Memorandum be given effect as domestic law.  But 
such  acquiescence  is  pertinent  when  the  President's  action  falls  within 
the second Youngstown category, not the third.  In any event, congres-
sional acquiescence does not exist here.  Congress' failure to act follow-
ing the President's resolution of prior ICJ controversies  does not dem-
onstrate  acquiescence  because  in  none  of  those  prior  controversies  did 
the President assert the authority to transform an international obliga-
tion  into  domestic  law  and  thereby  displace  state  law.  The  United 
States'  reliance  on  the  President's  "related"  statutory  responsibilities 
and on his "established role" in litigating foreign policy concerns is also 
misplaced.  The  President's  statutory  authorization  to  represent  the 
United States before the United Nations, the ICJ, and the U. N. Security 
Council  speaks  to  his  international  responsibilities,  not  to  any  unilat-
eral authority to create domestic law. 

The combination of a non-self-executing treaty and the lack of imple-
menting legislation does not preclude the President from acting to com-
ply  with  an  international  treaty  obligation  by  other  means,  so  long  as 
those  means  are  consistent  with  the  Constitution.  But  the  President 
may not rely upon a non-self-executing treaty to establish binding rules 
of decision that pre-empt contrary state law.  Pp. 525-530. 

(ii)  The  United  States  also  claims  that--independent  of  the 
United States' treaty obligations--the Memorandum is a valid exercise 
of  the  President's  foreign  affairs  authority  to  resolve  claims  disputes. 
See, e. g., American Ins. Assn. v.  Garamendi, 539 U. S. 396, 415.  This 
Court's  claims-settlement  cases  involve  a  narrow  set  of  circumstances: 
the  making  of  executive  agreements  to  settle  civil  claims  between 
American citizens and foreign governments or foreign nationals.  They 
are based on the view that "a systematic, unbroken, executive practice, 
long pursued to the knowledge of the Congress and never before ques-
tioned,"  can  "raise  a  presumption  that  the  [action]  had  been  [taken]  in 
pursuance  of  its  consent."  Dames  &  Moore  v.  Regan,  453  U. S.  654,

686.  But  "[p]ast  practice  does  not,  by  itself,  create  power."  Ibid. 
The  President's  Memorandum--a  directive  issued  to  state  courts  that 
would  compel  those  courts  to  reopen  final  criminal  judgments  and  set 
aside  neutrally  applicable  state  laws--is  not  supported  by  a  "particu-
larly longstanding practice."  The Executive's limited authority to set-
tle  international  claims  disputes  pursuant  to  an  executive  agreement 
cannot stretch so far.  Pp. 530-532. 

(iii)  Medelli'n's  argument  that  the  President's  Memorandum  is  a 
valid  exercise  of  his  power  to  "Take  Care"  that  the  laws  be  faithfully 
executed,  U. S.  Const.,  Art.  II,  $ 3,  fails  because  the  ICJ's  decision  in 
Avena is not domestic law.  P. 532.

als  were  entitled  to  review  and  reconsideration  of  their 
state-court  convictions  and  sentences  in  the  United  States. 
This was so regardless of any forfeiture of the right to raise 
Vienna Convention claims because of a failure to comply with 
generally  applicable  state  rules  governing  challenges  to 
criminal convictions. 

In Sanchez-Llamas v.  Oregon, 548 U. S. 331 (2006)--issued 
after  Avena  but  involving  individuals  who  were  not  named 
in the Avena judgment--we held that, contrary to the ICJ's 
determination,  the  Vienna  Convention  did  not  preclude  the 
application of state default rules.  After the Avena decision, 
President George W. Bush determined, through a Memoran-
dum  for  the  Attorney  General  (Feb.  28,  2005),  App.  to  Pet. 
for  Cert.  187a  (Memorandum  or  President's  Memorandum), 
that the United States would "discharge its international ob-
ligations"  under  Avena  "by  having  State  courts  give  effect 
to the decision." 

Petitioner Jose'  Ernesto Medelli'n, who had been convicted 
and sentenced in Texas  state court for murder, is one of the 
51 Mexican nationals named in the Avena decision.  Relying 
on  the  ICJ's  decision  and  the  President's  Memorandum, 
Medelli'n  filed  an  application  for  a  writ  of  habeas  corpus  in 
state  court.  The  Texas  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  dis-
missed  Medelli'n's  application  as  an  abuse  of  the  writ  under 
state  law,  given  Medelli'n's  failure  to  raise  his  Vienna  Con-
vention  claim  in  a  timely  manner  under  state  law.  We 
granted  certiorari  to  decide  two  questions.  First,  is  the 
ICJ's  judgment  in  Avena  directly  enforceable  as  domestic 
law in a state court in the United States?  Second, does the 
President's  Memorandum  independently  require  the  States 
to provide review and reconsideration of the claims of the 51 
Mexican  nationals  named  in  Avena  without  regard  to  state 
procedural  default  rules?  We  conclude  that  neither  Avena 
nor  the  President's  Memorandum  constitutes  directly  en-
forceable federal law that pre-empts state limitations on the

A 

In  1969,  the  United  States,  upon  the  advice  and  consent 
of  the  Senate,  ratified  the  Vienna  Convention  on  Consular 
Relations (Vienna Convention or Convention), Apr. 24, 1963, 
[1970]  21  U.  S.  T.  77,  T.  I.  A.  S.  No.  6820,  and  the  Optional 
Protocol Concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes 
to  the  Vienna  Convention  (Optional  Protocol  or  Protocol), 
Apr. 24, 1963, [1970] 21 U. S. T. 325, T. I. A. S. No. 6820.  The 
preamble  to  the  Convention  provides  that  its  purpose  is  to 
"contribute  to  the  development  of  friendly  relations  among 
nations."  21 U. S. T., at 79;  Sanchez-Llamas, supra, at 337. 
Toward  that  end,  Article  36  of  the  Convention  was  drafted 
to  "facilitat[e]  the  exercise  of  consular  functions."  Art. 
36(1),  21  U.  S.  T.,  at  100.  It  provides  that  if  a  person  de-
tained  by  a  foreign  country  "so  requests,  the  competent  au-
thorities  of  the  receiving  State  shall,  without  delay,  inform 
the  consular  post  of  the  sending  State"  of  such  detention, 
and  "inform  the  [detainee]  of  his  righ[t]"  to  request  assist-
ance  from  the  consul  of  his  own  state.  Art.  36(1)(b),  id., 
at 101. 

The Optional  Protocol provides a venue  for the  resolution 
of disputes arising out of the interpretation or application of 
the  Vienna  Convention.  Art.  I,  21  U. S. T.,  at  326.  Under 
the  Protocol,  such  disputes  "shall  lie  within  the  compulsory 
jurisdiction  of  the  International  Court  of  Justice"  and  "may 
accordingly be brought before the [ICJ] . . . by any party to 
the dispute being a Party to the present Protocol."  Ibid. 

The ICJ is "the principal judicial organ of the United Na-
tions."  United Nations Charter, Art. 92, 59 Stat. 1051, T. S. 
No.  993  (1945).  It  was  established  in  1945  pursuant  to  the 
United Nations Charter.  The ICJ Statute--annexed to the

Opinion of the Court 
U.  N.  Charter--provides  the  organizational  framework  and 
governing  procedures  for  cases  brought  before  the  ICJ. 
Statute  of  the  International  Court  of  Justice  (ICJ  Statute), 
59 Stat. 1055, T. S. No. 993 (1945). 

Under  Article  94(1)  of  the  U.  N.  Charter,  "[e]ach  Member 
of  the  United  Nations  undertakes  to  comply  with  the  deci-
sion of the [ICJ] in any case to which it is a party."  59 Stat. 
1051.  The  ICJ's  jurisdiction  in  any  particular  case,  how-
ever, is dependent upon the consent of the parties.  See Art. 
36,  id.,  at  1060.  The  ICJ  Statute  delineates  two  ways  in 
which  a  nation  may  consent  to ICJ  jurisdiction:  It  may con-
sent  generally  to  jurisdiction  on  any  question  arising  under 
a  treaty  or  general  international  law,  Art.  36(2),  ibid.,  or  it 
may consent specifically to jurisdiction over a particular cat-
egory of cases or disputes pursuant to a separate treaty, Art. 
36(1),  ibid.  The  United  States  originally  consented  to  the 
general  jurisdiction  of  the  ICJ  when  it  filed  a  declaration 
recognizing compulsory jurisdiction under Art. 36(2) in 1946. 
The  United  States  withdrew  from  general  ICJ  jurisdiction 
in 1985.  See U. S. Dept. of State Letter and Statement Con-
cerning Termination of Acceptance of ICJ Compulsory Juris-
diction  (Oct.  7,  1985),  reprinted  in  24  I.  L.  M.  1742  (1985). 
By ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention, 
the United States consented to the specific jurisdiction of the 
ICJ with respect to claims arising out of the Vienna Conven-
tion.  On  March  7,  2005,  subsequent  to  the  ICJ's  judgment 
in Avena, the  United States gave notice of withdrawal from 
the  Optional  Protocol  to  the  Vienna  Convention.  Letter

"Black  and  Whites"  gang,  Medelli'n  was  convicted  of  capital 
murder  and  sentenced  to  death  in  Texas  for  the  gang  rape 
and brutal murders of two Houston teenagers. 

On June 24, 1993, 14-year-old Jennifer Ertman and 16-year-
old  Elizabeth  Pena  were  walking  home  when  they  encoun-
tered  Medelli'n  and  several  fellow  gang  members.  Medelli'n 
attempted  to  engage  Elizabeth  in  conversation.  When  she 
tried  to  run,  petitioner  threw  her  to  the  ground.  Jennifer 
was  grabbed  by other  gang  members  when she,  in  response 
to  her  friend's  cries,  ran  back  to  help.  The  gang  members 
raped  both  girls  for  over  an  hour.  Then,  to  prevent  their 
victims  from  identifying  them,  Medelli'n  and  his  fellow  gang 
members  murdered  the  girls  and  discarded  their  bodies  in 
a  wooded  area.  Medelli'n  was  personally  responsible  for 
strangling at least one of the girls with her own shoelace. 

Medelli'n was arrested at approximately 4 a.m. on June 29, 
1993.  A  few  hours  later,  between  5:54  and  7:23  a.m., 
Medelli'n  was  given  Miranda  warnings;  he  then  signed  a 
written  waiver  and  gave  a  detailed  written  confession.

first  application  for  state  postconviction  relief.  The  state 
trial  court  held  that  the  claim  was  procedurally  defaulted 
because  Medelli'n  had  failed  to  raise  it  at  trial  or  on  direct 
review.  The trial court also rejected the Vienna Convention 
claim  on  the  merits,  finding  that  Medelli'n  had  "fail[ed]  to

Court.  The  District  Court  denied  relief,  holding  that Medelli'n's  Vienna  Convention  claim  was  procedurally  de-
faulted  and  that  Medelli'n  had  failed  to  show  prejudice  aris-
ing  from  the  Vienna  Convention  violation.  See  Medelli'n  v. 
Cockrell, Civ. Action No. H-01-4078 (SD Tex., June 26, 2003), 
App. to Brief for Respondent 66, 86-92. While  Medelli'n's  application  for  a  certificate  of  appeala-

bility  was  pending  in  the  Fifth  Circuit,  the  ICJ  issued  its decision  in 

Avena.  The  ICJ  held  that  the  United  States 
had  violated  Article  36(1)(b)  of  the  Vienna  Convention  by failing  to  inform  the  51  named  Mexican  nationals,  including 

Medelli'n, of their Vienna Convention rights.  2004 I. C. J., at 53-55.  In  the  ICJ's  determination,  the  United  States  was

Mexican nationals addressed in that decision."  App. to Pet. for Cert. 187a. 

Medelli'n, relying on the President's Memorandum and the 
ICJ's decision in Avena, filed a second application for habeas relief  in  state  court. 

Ex  parte  Medelli'n,  223  S.  W.  3d  315, 
322-323  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  2006).  Because  the  state-court 
proceedings  might  have  provided  Medelli'n  with  the  review 
and  reconsideration  he  requested,  and  because  his  claim  for 
federal  relief  might  otherwise  have  been  barred,  we  dis-
missed  his  petition  for  certiorari  as  improvidently  granted.

504  MEDELLIN  v.  TEXAS 

Opinion of the Court 
The  Texas  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  subsequently  dis-missed  Medelli'n's  second  state  habeas  application  as  an 

abuse of the writ.  223 S. W. 3d, at 352.  In the court's view, neither the Avena decision nor the President's Memorandum 
was "binding federal law" that could displace the State's lim-itations on  the  filing of  successive  habeas  applications.  223 
S.  W.  3d,  at  352.  We  again  granted  certiorari.  550  U. S. 917 (2007). 

II 
Medelli'n  first  contends  that  the  ICJ's  judgment  in  Avena constitutes  a  "binding"  obligation  on  the  state  and  fed-

eral courts of the United States.  He argues that "by virtue of  the  Supremacy  Clause,  the  treaties  requiring  compli-
ance  with  the  Avena  judgment  are  already  the  `Law  of  the Land'  by  which  all  state  and  federal  courts  in  this  country 
are  `bound.' "  Reply  Brief  for  Petitioner  1.  Accordingly, Medelli'n  argues,  Avena  is  a  binding  federal  rule  of  decision 
that  pre-empts  contrary  state  limitations  on  successive  ha-beas petitions. 

No  one  disputes  that  the  Avena  decision--a  decision  that flows from the treaties through which the United States sub-
mitted to ICJ jurisdiction with respect to Vienna Convention disputes--constitutes an 

international law obligation on the part of the United States.  But not all international law obli-

gations automatically constitute binding federal law enforce-able in United States courts.  The question we confront here 
is whether the Avena judgment has automatic domestic legal effect such that the judgment of its own force applies in state 
and federal courts. This  Court  has  long  recognized  the  distinction  between 
treaties  that  automatically  have  effect  as  domestic  law,  and those  that--while  they  constitute  international  law  commit-
ments--do not by themselves function as binding federal law. The  distinction  was  well  explained  by  Chief  Justice  Mar-
shall's  opinion  in  Foster  v.  Neilson,  2  Pet.  253,  315  (1829),

overruled  on  other  grounds,  United  States  v.  Percheman,  7 Pet.  51  (1833),  which  held  that  a  treaty  is  "equivalent  to  an 

act of the legislature," and hence self-executing, when it "op-erates  of  itself  without  the  aid  of  any  legislative  provision." 
Foster,  supra,  at  314.  When,  in  contrast,  "[treaty]  stipula-tions are not self-executing they can only be enforced pursu-
ant  to  legislation  to  carry  them  into  effect."  Whitney  v. 
Robertson, 124 U. S. 190, 194 (1888).  In sum, while treaties "may  comprise  international  commitments . . .  they  are  not 

domestic law unless Congress has either enacted implement-ing  statutes  or  the  treaty  itself  conveys  an  intention  that 
it  be  `self-executing'  and  is  ratified  on  these  terms." 
Igartu' a-De La Rosa v.  United States, 417 F. 3d 145, 150 (CA1 
2005) (en banc) (Boudin, C. J.).2 A treaty is, of course, "primarily a compact between inde-

pendent  nations."  Head  Money  Cases,  112  U. S.  580,  598 (1884).  It  ordinarily  "depends  for  the  enforcement  of  its 
provisions on the interest and the honor of the governments 
which  are  parties  to  it."  Ibid.;  see  also  The  Federalist No.  33,  p.  207  (J.  Cooke  ed.  1961)  (A.  Hamilton)  (comparing 

laws that individuals are "bound to observe" as "the supreme 
law of the land" with "a mere treaty, dependent on the good 
faith of the parties").  "If these [interests] fail, its infraction becomes  the  subject  of  international  negotiations  and  recla-

mations  .  .  .  .  It  is  obvious  that  with  all  this  the  judicial courts  have  nothing  to  do  and  can  give  no  redress." 

Head 
Money  Cases,  supra,  at  598.  Only  "[i]f  the  treaty  contains 
stipulations which are self-executing, that is, require no leg-
islation  to  make  them  operative,  [will]  they  have  the  force 

2 The label  "self-executing" has on occasion been  used to convey differ-
ent meanings.  What  we mean  by "self-executing" is  that the treaty  has 
automatic domestic  effect as federal law upon  ratification.  Conversely, a 
"non-self-executing"  treaty  does  not  by  itself  give  rise  to  domestically 
enforceable  federal  law.  Whether  such  a  treaty  has  domestic  effect  de-
pends upon implementing legislation passed by Congress.

Medelli'n  and  his  amici  nonetheless  contend  that  the  Op-tional  Protocol,  U.  N.  Charter,  and  ICJ  Statute  supply  the 

"relevant  obligation"  to  give  the  Avena  judgment  binding effect  in  the  domestic  courts  of  the  United  States.  Reply 
Brief  for  Petitioner  5-6.4  Because  none  of  these  treaty sources  creates  binding  federal  law  in  the  absence  of  imple-
menting  legislation,  and  because  it  is  uncontested  that  no such legislation exists, we conclude that the 

Avena judgment is not automatically binding domestic law. 

A 
The  interpretation  of  a  treaty,  like  the  interpretation  of a  statute,  begins  with  its  text. 

Air  France  v.  Saks,  470 

3 Even  when  treaties  are  self-executing  in  the  sense  that  they  create 
federal  law,  the  background  presumption  is  that  "[i]nternational  agree-
ments,  even  those  directly  benefiting  private  persons,  generally  do  not 
create private  rights  or  provide  for  a  private  cause  of action  in  domestic 
courts."  2  Restatement  (Third)  of Foreign  Relations Law  of  the  United 
States  $ 907,  Comment  a,  p.  395  (1986)  (hereinafter  Restatement).  Ac-
cordingly, a number of the Courts of Appeals have presumed that treaties 
do  not  create  privately  enforceable  rights  in  the  absence  of  express  lan-
guage to the contrary.  See, e. g., United States v. Emuegbunam, 268 F. 3d 
377,  389  (CA6  2001);  United  States  v.  Jimenez-Nava,  243  F.  3d  192,  195 
(CA5 2001); United States v.  Li, 206 F. 3d 56, 60-61 (CA1 2000) (en banc); 
Goldstar (Panama) S. A. v.  United States, 967 F. 2d 965, 968 (CA4 1992); 
Canadian Transp. Co. v.  United States, 663 F. 2d 1081, 1092 (CADC 1980); 
Mannington  Mills,  Inc.  v.  Congoleum  Corp.,  595  F.  2d  1287,  1298  (CA3 
1979). 

4 The  question  is  whether  the  Avena  judgment  has  binding  effect  in 

domestic courts under the Optional Protocol, ICJ Statute, and U. N. Char-
ter.  Consequently, it is unnecessary to resolve whether the Vienna Con-
vention is itself "self-executing" or whether it grants Medelli'n individually 
enforceable rights.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 5 (disclaiming reliance 
on the Vienna Convention).  As in Sanchez-Llamas, 548 U. S., at 342-343, 
we thus assume, without deciding, that Article 36 grants foreign nationals 
"an individually enforceable right to request that their consular officers be 
notified  of  their  detention,  and  an  accompanying  right to  be  informed  by 
authorities of the availability of consular notification."

Opinion of the Court 
U. S.  392,  396-397  (1985).  Because  a  treaty  ratified  by  the United  States  is  "an  agreement  among  sovereign  powers," 

we  have  also  considered  as  "aids  to  its  interpretation"  the negotiation  and  drafting  history  of  the  treaty  as  well  as 
"the  postratification  understanding"  of  signatory  nations. 
Zicherman  v.  Korean  Air  Lines  Co.,  516  U. S.  217,  226 
(1996);  see  also  United  States  v.  Stuart,  489  U. S.  353,  365- 
366  (1989);  Choctaw  Nation  v.  United  States,  318  U. S.  423, 431-432 (1943). 

As a signatory to the Optional Protocol, the United States agreed to submit disputes arising out of the Vienna Conven-
tion  to  the  ICJ.  The  Protocol  provides:  "Disputes  arising 
out  of  the  interpretation  or  application  of  the  [Vienna]  Con-
vention  shall  lie  within  the  compulsory  jurisdiction  of  the 
International  Court  of  Justice."  Art.  I,  21  U.  S.  T.,  at  326. 
Of  course,  submitting  to  jurisdiction  and  agreeing  to  be 
bound are two different things.  A party could, for example, 
agree to compulsory nonbinding arbitration.  Such an agree-
ment  would  require  the  party  to  appear  before  the  arbitral 
tribunal  without  obligating  the  party  to  treat  the  tribunal's 
decision  as  binding.  See,  e. g.,  North  American  Free  Trade 
Agreement,  U.  S.-Can.-Mex.,  Art.  2018(1),  Dec.  17,  1992,  32 
I. L. M. 605, 697 (1993) ("On receipt of the final report of [the 
arbitral  panel  requested  by  a  Party  to  the  agreement],  the 
disputing Parties shall agree on the resolution of the dispute, 
which  normally  shall  conform  with  the  determinations  and 
recommendations of the panel"). 

The  most  natural  reading  of  the  Optional  Protocol  is  as  a 
bare grant  of jurisdiction.  It provides only that "[d]isputes 
arising  out  of  the  interpretation  or  application  of  the 
[Vienna] Convention shall lie within the compulsory jurisdic-
tion of the International Court of Justice" and "may accord-
ingly  be  brought  before  the  [ICJ]  .  .  .  by  any  party  to  the 
dispute  being  a  Party  to  the  present  Protocol."  Art.  I,  21 
U. S. T.,  at  326.  The  Protocol  says  nothing  about  the  effect 
of  an  ICJ  decision  and  does  not  itself  commit  signatories  to

508  MEDELLIN  v.  TEXAS 

Opinion of the Court 
comply with an ICJ judgment.  The Protocol is similarly si-
lent as to any enforcement mechanism. 

The  obligation  on  the  part  of  signatory  nations  to  comply 
with ICJ judgments derives not from the Optional Protocol, 
but  rather  from  Article  94  of  the  U.  N.  Charter--the  provi-
sion  that  specifically  addresses  the  effect  of  ICJ  decisions. 
Article 94(1) provides that "[e]ach Member of the United Na-
tions undertakes to comply with the decision of the [ICJ] in 
any  case  to  which  it  is  a  party."  59  Stat.  1051  (emphasis 
added).  The  Executive  Branch  contends  that  the  phrase 
"undertakes to comply" is not  "an acknowledgement that an 
ICJ  decision  will  have  immediate  legal  effect  in  the  courts 
of  U.  N.  members,"  but  rather  "a  commitment  on  the  part 
of U. N. members to take future action through their political 
branches to comply with an ICJ decision."  Brief for United 
States  as  Amicus  Curiae  in  Medelli'n I,  O. T.  2004, 
No. 04-5928, p. 34. 

We  agree  with  this  construction  of Article  94.  The  Arti-
cle is not a directive to domestic courts.  It does not provide 
that the United States "shall" or "must" comply with an ICJ 
decision,  nor  indicate  that  the  Senate that  ratified  the  U.  N. 
Charter intended to vest ICJ decisions with immediate legal 
effect  in  domestic  courts.  Instead,  "[t]he  words  of  Article 
94 . . . call upon governments to take certain action."  Com-
mittee  of  United  States  Citizens  Living  in  Nicaragua  v. 
Reagan,  859  F.  2d  929,  938  (CADC  1988)  (quoting  Diggs 
v.  Richardson,  555  F.  2d  848,  851  (CADC  1976);  internal 
quotation  marks  omitted).  See  also  Foster,  2  Pet.,  at  314, 
315  (holding  a  treaty  non-self-executing  because  its  text-- 
"  `all . . .  grants of land . . . shall  be  ratified and confirmed' "-- 
did not "act directly on the grants" but rather "pledge[d] the 
faith of the United States to pass acts which shall ratify and 
confirm  them").  In  other  words,  the  U.  N.  Charter  reads 
like "a compact between independent nations" that "depends 
for the enforcement of its provisions on the interest and the

Money Cases, 112 U. S., at 598.5 

The remainder of Article 94 confirms that the U. N. Char-
ter does not contemplate the automatic enforceability of ICJ 
decisions  in  domestic  courts.6  Article  94(2)--the  enforce-
ment  provision--provides  the  sole  remedy  for  noncompli-
ance:  referral  to  the  United  Nations  Security  Council  by  an 
aggrieved state.  59 Stat. 1051. 

The  U.  N.  Charter's  provision  of  an  express  diplomatic-- 
that is, nonjudicial--remedy is itself evidence that ICJ judg-
ments  were  not  meant  to  be  enforceable  in  domestic  courts. 
See  Sanchez-Llamas,  548  U. S.,  at  347.  And  even  this 
"quintessentially  international  remed[y],"  id.,  at  355,  is  not 
absolute.  First,  the  Security  Council  must  "dee[m]  neces-
sary" the issuance of a recommendation or measure to effec-
tuate  the  judgment.  Art.  94(2),  59  Stat.  1051.  Second,  as 
the  President  and  Senate  were  undoubtedly  aware  in  sub-
scribing  to  the  U.  N.  Charter  and  Optional  Protocol,  the

Opinion of the Court 
United  States  retained  the  unqualified  right  to  exercise  its 
veto of any Security Council resolution. 

This was the understanding of the Executive Branch when 
the  President  agreed  to  the  U.  N.  Charter  and  the  declara-
tion  accepting  general  compulsory  ICJ  jurisdiction.  See, 
e. g., The Charter of the United Nations for the Maintenance 
of  International  Peace  and  Security:  Hearings  before  the 
Senate  Committee  on  Foreign  Relations,  79th  Cong.,  1st 
Sess., 124-125 (1945) ("[I]f a state fails to perform its obliga-
tions  under  a  judgment  of  the  [ICJ],  the  other  party  may 
have  recourse  to  the  Security  Council");  id.,  at  286  (state-
ment of Leo Pasvolsky, Special Assistant to the Secretary of 
State  for  International  Organizations  and  Security  Affairs) 
("[W]hen the Court has rendered a judgment and one of the 
parties refuses  to accept  it,  then  the dispute  becomes politi-
cal  rather  than  legal.  It  is  as  a  political  dispute  that  the 
matter  is  referred  to  the  Security  Council");  A  Resolution 
Proposing Acceptance of Compulsory Jurisdiction of Interna-
tional  Court  of  Justice:  Hearings  on  S.  Res.  196  before  the 
Subcommittee  of  the  Senate  Committee  on  Foreign  Rela-
tions,  79th  Cong.,  2d  Sess.,  142  (1946)  (statement  of  Charles 
Fahy,  State  Dept.  Legal  Adviser)  (while  parties  that  accept 
ICJ  jurisdiction  have  "a  moral  obligation"  to  comply  with 
ICJ  decisions,  Article  94(2)  provides  the  exclusive  means  of 
enforcement). 

If  ICJ  judgments  were  instead  regarded  as  automatically 
enforceable domestic law, they would be immediately and di-
rectly  binding  on  state  and  federal  courts  pursuant  to  the 
Supremacy  Clause.  Mexico or  the  ICJ  would have  no  need 
to  proceed  to  the  Security  Council  to  enforce  the  judgment 
in this case.  Noncompliance with an ICJ judgment through 
exercise  of  the  Security  Council  veto--always  regarded  as 
an option  by the  Executive  and ratifying Senate during and 
after  consideration  of  the  U.  N.  Charter,  Optional  Protocol, 
and  ICJ  Statute--would  no  longer  be  a  viable  alternative.

Opinion of the Court 
There would be nothing to veto.  In light of the U. N. Char-
ter's remedial scheme, there is no reason to believe that the 
President and Senate signed up for such a result. 

In  sum,  Medelli'n's  view  that  ICJ  decisions  are  automati-
cally  enforceable  as  domestic  law  is  fatally  undermined  by 
the  enforcement  structure  established  by  Article  94.  His 
construction  would  eliminate  the  option  of  noncompliance 
contemplated by Article 94(2), undermining the ability of the 
political  branches  to  determine  whether  and  how  to  comply 
with an ICJ judgment.  Those sensitive foreign policy deci-
sions  would  instead  be  transferred  to  state  and  federal 
courts  charged  with  applying  an  ICJ  judgment  directly  as 
domestic law.  And those courts would not be empowered to 
decide whether to comply with the judgment--again, always 
regarded  as  an  option  by  the  political  branches--any  more 
than courts may consider whether to comply with any other 
species  of  domestic  law.  This  result  would  be  particularly 
anomalous in light  of the  principle that "[t]he conduct of the 
foreign  relations  of  our  Government  is  committed  by  the 
Constitution  to  the  Executive  and  Legislative--`the  politi-
cal'--Departments."  Oetjen  v.  Central  Leather  Co.,  246 
U. S. 297, 302 (1918). 

The ICJ Statute, incorporated into the U. N. Charter, pro-
vides  further  evidence  that  the  ICJ's  judgment  in  Avena 
does  not  automatically  constitute  federal  law  judicially  en-
forceable  in  United  States  courts.  Art.  59,  59  Stat.  1062. 
To  begin  with,  the  ICJ's  "principal  purpose"  is  said  to  be 
to  "arbitrate  particular  disputes  between  national  govern-
ments."  Sanchez-Llamas,  supra,  at  355  (citing  59  Stat. 
1055).  Accordingly, the ICJ can hear disputes only between 
nations,  not  individuals.  Art.  34(1),  id.,  at  1059  ("Only 
states  [i. e.,  countries]  may  be  parties  in  cases  before  the 
[ICJ]").  More important, Article 59 of the statute provides 
that "[t]he  decision of the  [ICJ] has  no binding  force  except 
between  the  parties  and  in  respect  of  that  particular  case."

512  MEDELLIN  v.  TEXAS 

Opinion of the Court 
Id., at 1062 (emphasis added).7  The dissent does not explain how  Medelli'n,  an  individual,  can  be  a  party  to  the  ICJ 

proceeding. Medelli'n argues that because the Avena case involves him, 
it is clear that he--and the 50 other Mexican nationals named in the Avena decision--should be regarded as parties to the 
Avena  judgment.  Brief  for  Petitioner  21-22.  But  cases before  the  ICJ  are  often  precipitated  by  disputes  involving 
particular  persons  or  entities,  disputes  that  a  nation  elects to take up as its own.  See, 

e. g., Case Concerning the Barce-lona  Traction,  Light  &  Power  Co.  (Belg.  v.  Spain),  1970 

I. C. J.  3  (Judgment of  Feb.  5)  (claim  brought by  Belgium  on behalf of Belgian nationals and shareholders); Case Concern-
ing  the  Protection  of  French  Nationals  and  Protected  Per-sons  in  Egypt  (Fr.  v.  Egypt),  1950  I. C. J.  59  (Order  of  Mar. 
29)  (claim  brought  by  France  on  behalf  of  French  nationals and  protected  persons  in  Egypt); 

Anglo-Iranian  Oil  Co. Case  (U.  K.  v.  Iran),  1952  I.  C.  J.  93,  112  (Judgment  of  July 

22)  (claim  brought  by  the  United  Kingdom  on  behalf  of  the Anglo-Iranian  Oil  Company).  That  has  never  been  under-
stood  to  alter  the  express  and  established  rules  that  only nation-states may be parties before the ICJ, Art. 34, 59 Stat. 
1059,  and--contrary  to  the  position  of  the  dissent,  post,  at 559--that  ICJ  judgments  are  binding  only  between  those 
parties, Art. 59, 59 Stat. 1062.8 

7 Medelli'n alters this language in his brief to provide that the ICJ Stat-
ute  makes  the  Avena  judgment  binding  "in  respect  of  [his]  particular 
case."  Brief for Petitioner 22 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Med-
elli'n  does  not  and  cannot  have  a  case  before  the  ICJ  under  the  terms  of 
the ICJ Statute. 

8 The  dissent  concludes  that  the  ICJ  judgment  is  binding  federal  law 

based  in  large  part  on  its  belief  that  the  Vienna  Convention  overrides 
contrary state procedural rules.  See post, at 555-557, 559.  But not even 
Medelli'n relies on the Convention.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 5 (dis-
claiming  reliance).  For  good  reason:  Such  reliance  is  foreclosed  by  the 
decision  of  this  Court  in  Sanchez-Llamas,  548  U. S.,  at  351  (holding  that

Opinion of the Court 
It  is,  moreover,  well  settled  that  the  United  States' 
interpretation  of  a  treaty  "is  entitled  to  great  weight." 
Sumitomo  Shoji  America,  Inc.  v.  Avagliano,  457  U. S.  176, 
184-185  (1982);  see  also  El  Al  Israel  Airlines,  Ltd.  v.  Tsui 
Yuan  Tseng,  525  U. S.  155,  168  (1999).  The  Executive 
Branch has unfailingly adhered to its view that the relevant 
treaties  do  not  create  domestically  enforceable  federal  law. 
See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 4, 27-29.9 

The  pertinent  international  agreements,  therefore,  do  not 
provide for implementation of ICJ judgments through direct

is  not  for  the  federal  courts  to  impose  one  on  the  States through  lawmaking  of  their  own."  Sanchez-Llamas,  548 

U. S., at 347.  B 

The  dissent  faults  our  analysis  because  it  "looks  for  the wrong  thing  (explicit  textual  expressi on  about  self-
execution)  using  the  wrong  standard  (clarity)  in  the  wrong place (the treaty  language)."  Post, at  562.  Given our  obli-
gation  to  interpret  treaty  provisions  to  determine  whether they are self-executing, we have to confess that we do think 
it rather important to look to the treaty language to see what it has to say about the issue.  That is after all what the Sen-
ate looks to in deciding whether to approve the treaty. The interpretive approach employed by the Court today-- 
resorting  to  the  text--is  hardly  novel.  In  two  early  cases involving  an  1819  land-grant  treaty  between  Spain  and  the 
United  States,  Chief  Justice  Marshall  found  the  language  of the  treaty  dispositive.  In 

Foster,  after  distinguishing  be-tween  self-executing  treaties  (those  "equivalent  to  an  act  of 

the  legislature")  and  non-self-executing  treaties  (those  "the legislature  must  execute"),  Chief  Justice  Marshall  held  that 
the  1819  treaty  was  non-self-executing.  2  Pet.,  at  314. Four  years  later,  the  Supreme  Court  considered  another 
claim  under  the  same  treaty,  but  concluded  that  the  treaty was self-executing.  See 

Percheman, 7 Pet., at 87.  The rea-son was not because the treaty was sometimes self-executing 

and sometimes not, but because "the language of " the Span-ish  translation  (brought  to  the  Court's  attention  for  the 
first  time)  indicated  the  parties'  intent  to  ratify  and  con-firm the  land grant  "by  force of the  instrument  itself." 

Id., at 89. 

As against this time-honored textual approach, the dissent proposes  a  multifactor,  judgment-by-judgment  analysis  that 
would  "jettiso[n]  relative  predictability  for  the  open-ended rough-and-tumble  of  factors."

Opinion of the Court 
The dissent's  novel approach to deciding which (or, more ac-curately, when) treaties give rise to directly enforceable fed-

eral  law  is  arrestingly  indeterminate.  Treaty  language  is barely  probative. 

Post,  at  549  ("[T]he  absence  or  presence 
of  language  in  a  treaty  about  a  provision's  self-execution proves nothing  at  all").  Determining whether  treaties 

themselves create federal law is sometimes committed to the 
political  branches  and  sometimes  to  the  judiciary.  Post, at 549-550.  Of those committed to the judiciary, the courts 

pick  and  choose  which  shall  be  binding  United  States  law-- trumping  not  only  state  but  other  federal  law  as  well--and 
which  shall  not.  Post,  at  550-562.  They  do  this  on  the 
basis  of  a  multifactor,  "context-specific"  inquiry.  Post,  at 
549.  Even  then,  the  same  treaty  sometimes  gives  rise  to 
United States law and sometimes does not, again depending 
on an ad hoc judicial assessment.  Post, at 550-562. 

Our  Framers  established  a  careful  set  of  procedures  that 
must be followed before federal law can be created under the 
Constitution--vesting that decision in the political branches, 
subject  to  checks  and  balances.  U. S.  Const.,  Art.  I,  $ 7. 
They  also  recognized  that  treaties  could  create  federal  law, 
but again  through the political  branches, with  the  President 
making the treaty and the Senate approving it.  Art. II, $ 2. 
The  dissent's  understanding  of  the  treaty  route,  depending 
on  an  ad  hoc  judgment  of  the  judiciary  without  looking  to 
the  treaty  language--the  very  language  negotiated  by  the 
President  and  approved  by  the  Senate--cannot  readily  be 
ascribed to those same Framers. 

The  dissent's  approach  risks  the  United  States'  involve-
ment in international agreements.  It is hard to believe that 
the  United  States  would  enter  into  treaties  that  are  some-
times  enforceable  and  sometimes  not.  Such  a  treaty  would 
be  the  equivalent  of  writing  a  blank  check  to  the  judiciary. 
Senators  could  never  be  quite  sure  what  the  treaties  on 
which  they  were  voting  meant.  Only  a  judge  could  say  for 
sure  and  only  at  some  future  date.  This  uncertainty  could

Opinion of the Court 
hobble the United States' efforts to negotiate and sign inter-national agreements. 

In  this  case,  the  dissent--for  a  grab  bag  of  no  less  than seven  reasons--would  tell  us  that  this  particular  ICJ  judg-
ment  is  federal  law.  Post,  at  549-562.  That  is  no  sort  of guidance.  Nor  is  it  any  answer  to  say  that  the  federal 
courts will diligently police international agreements and en-force the decisions of international tribunals only when they 
should be enforced.  Ibid.  The point of a non-self-executing treaty is that it "addresses itself to the political, 

not the judi-cial  department;  and  the  legislature  must  execute  the  con-

tract  before  it  can  become  a  rule  for  the  Court."  Foster, supra,  at  314  (emphasis  added);  Whitney,  124  U. S.,  at  195. 
See also Foster, supra, at 307 ("The judiciary is not that de-partment  of  the  government,  to  which  the  assertion  of  its 
interests against foreign powers is confided").  The dissent's contrary approach would assign to the courts--not the politi-
cal  branches--the  primary  role  in  deciding  when  and  how international agreements will be enforced.  To read a treaty 
so that it sometimes has the effect of domestic law and some-times  does  not  is  tantamount  to  vesting  with  the  judiciary 
the  power  not  only  to  interpret  but  also  to  create  the  law. 

C 
Our  conclusion  that  Avena  does  not  by  itself  constitute binding  federal  law  is  confirmed  by  the  "postratification  un-

derstanding"  of  signatory  nations.  See  Zicherman,  516 U. S., at 226.  There are currently 47 nations that are parties 
to  the  Optional  Protocol  and  171  nations  that  are  parties  to the Vienna Convention.  Yet neither Medelli'n nor his amici 
have  identified  a  single  nation  that  treats  ICJ  judgments as  binding  in  domestic  courts.

Opinion of the Court 
Vienna  Convention  did  not  require  certain  relief  in  United 
States courts in Sanchez-Llamas, we found it pertinent that 
the requested relief would not  be available under the treaty 
in  any  other  signatory  country.  See  548  U. S.,  at  343-344, 
and  n.  3.  So  too  here  the  lack  of  any  basis  for  supposing 
that  any  other  country  would  treat  ICJ  judgments  as  di-
rectly  enforceable  as  a  matter  of  its  domestic  law  strongly 
suggests  that  the  treaty  should  not  be  so  viewed  in  our 
courts. 

Our  conclusion  is  further  supported  by  general  principles 
of interpretation.  To begin with, we reiterated in SanchezLlamas  what  we  held  in  Breard,  that  " `absent  a  clear  and 
express  statement  to  the  contrary,  the  procedural  rules  of 
the  forum  State  govern  the  implementation  of  the  treaty  in 
that State.' "  548 U. S., at 351 (quoting Breard, 523 U. S., at 
375).  Given  that  ICJ  judgments  may  interfere  with  state 
procedural  rules,  one  would  expect  the  ratifying  parties  to 
the  relevant  treaties  to  have  clearly  stated  their  intent  to 
give  those  judgments  domestic  effect,  if  they  had  so  in-
tended.  Here  there  is  no  statement  in  the  Optional  Proto-
col,  the  U.  N.  Charter, or  the  ICJ  Statute  that  supports  the 
notion  that  ICJ  judgments  displace  state  procedural  rules. 

Moreover,  the  consequences  of  Medelli'n's  argument  give 
pause.  An  ICJ  judgment,  the  argument  goes,  is  not  only 
binding  domestic  law  but  is  also  unassailable.  As  a  result, 
neither  Texas  nor  this  Court  may  look  behind  a  judgment 
and quarrel with its reasoning or result.  (We already know, 
from  Sanchez-Llamas,  that  this  Court  disagrees  with  both 

best inconsistent,  for  at least  one local  Moroccan  court has  held that ICJ 
judgments  are  not  binding  as  a  matter  of  municipal  law.  See,  e. g., 
Mackay Radio &  Tel.  Co. v.  Lal-La  Fatma Bent  si Mohamed  el Khadar, 
[1954] 21 Int'l L. Rep. 136 (Tangier, Ct. App. Int'l Trib.) (holding that ICJ 
decisions are not binding on Morocco's domestic courts); see also "Socobel" 
v.  Greek  State,  [1951]  18  Int'l  L.  Rep.  3  (Belg.,  Trib.  Civ.  de  Bruxelles) 
(holding that judgments of the ICJ's predecessor, the Permanent Court of 
International Justice, were not domestically enforceable).

Opinion of the Court 
the  reasoning  and  result  in  Avena.)  Medelli'n's  interpreta-tion would allow ICJ judgments to override otherwise bind-

ing state law; there is nothing in his logic that would exempt contrary  federal  law  from  the  same  fate.  See, 

e. g.,  Cook  v. 
United  States,  288  U. S.  102,  119  (1933)  (later-in-time  self-executing  treaty  supersedes  a  federal  statute  if  there  is  a 

conflict).  And  there is  nothing  to prevent  the  ICJ from  or-
dering  state  courts  to  annul  criminal  convictions  and  sen-tences, for any reason deemed sufficient by the ICJ.  Indeed, 

that  is  precisely  the  relief  Mexico  requested.  Avena,  2004 I. C. J., at 58-59. 

Even  the  dissent  flinches  at  reading  the  relevant  treaties 
to give rise to self-executing ICJ judgments in all cases.  It 
admits  that  "Congress  is  unlikely  to  authorize  automatic 
judicial  enforceability  of  all  ICJ  judgments,  for  that  could 
include  some  politically  sensitive  judgments  and  others  bet-
ter suited for enforcement by other branches."  Post, at 560. 
Our  point  precisely.  But  the  lesson  to  draw  from  that  in-
sight  is  hardly  that  the  judiciary  should  decide  which  judg-
ments are politically sensitive and which are not. 

In  short,  and  as  we observed  in  Sanchez-Llamas,  "[n]oth-
ing  in  the  structure  or  purpose  of  the  ICJ  suggests  that 
its  interpretations  were  intended  to  be  conclusive  on  our 
courts."  548 U. S., at 354.  Given that holding, it is difficult 
to  see  how  that  same  structure  and  purpose  can  establish, 
as  Medelli'n  argues,  that  judgments  of  the  ICJ  nonetheless 
were  intended  to  be  conclusive  on  our  courts.  A  judgment 
is  binding  only  if  there  is  a  rule  of  law  that  makes  it  so. 
And  the  question  whether  ICJ  judgments  can  bind  domes-
tic  courts  depends  upon  the  same  analysis  undertaken  in 
Sanchez-Llamas and set forth above. 

Our  prior  decisions  identified  by  the  dissent  as  holding  a 
number of treaties to be self-executing, see post, at 545-546, 
and  Appendix  A,  stand  only  for  the  unremarkable  proposi-
tion  that  some  international  agreements  are  self-executing 
and others are not.  It is well settled that the "[i]nterpreta-

U. S.,  at  180.  As  a  result,  we  have  held  treaties  to  be  self-executing when the textual provisions indicate that the Pres-
ident and Senate intended for the agreement to have domes-tic effect. 

Medelli'n and the dissent cite Comegys v.  Vasse, 1 Pet. 193 (1828),  for  the  proposition  that  the  judgments  of  inter-
national  tribunals  are  automatically  binding  on  domestic courts.  See 

post, at 546; Reply  Brief for Petitioner 2; Brief for Petitioner 19-20.  That case, of course, involved a differ-

ent treaty than  the ones at issue here; it  stands only for the modest  principle  that  the  terms  of  a  treaty  control  the  out-
come of a case.11  We do not suggest that treaties can never afford binding domestic effect to international tribunal judg-
ments--only  that  the  U.  N.  Charter,  the  Optional  Protocol, and the ICJ Statute do not do so.  And whether the treaties 
underlying  a  judgment  are  self-executing  so  that  the  judg-ment is directly enforceable as domestic law in our courts is, 
of  course,  a  matter  for  this  Court  to  decide.  See  SanchezLlamas, supra, at 353-354. 

D 
Our  holding  does  not  call  into  question  the  ordinary  en-forcement  of  foreign  judgments  or  international  arbitral 

11 The  other  case  Medelli'n  cites  for  the  proposition  that  the  judgments 
of international courts  are binding, La Abra Silver Mining Co. v.  United 
States, 175 U. S. 423 (1899), and the cases he cites for the proposition that 
this  Court  has  routinely  enforced  treaties  under  which  foreign  nationals 
have asserted rights, similarly stand only for the principle that the terms 
of  a  treaty  govern  its  enforcement.  See  Reply  Brief  for  Petitioner  4,  5, 
and  n.  2.  In  each  case,  this  Court  first  interpreted  the  treaty  prior  to 
finding it domestically enforceable.  See, e. g., United States v.  Rauscher, 
119 U. S. 407, 422-423 (1886) (holding that the treaty required extradition 
only for specified offenses); Hopkirk v.  Bell, 3 Cranch 454, 458 (1806) (hold-
ing that the treaty of peace between Great Britain and the United States 
prevented the operation of a state statute of limitations on British debts).

agreements.  Indeed, we agree with Medelli'n that, as a gen-eral  matter,  "an  agreement  to  abide  by  the  result"  of  an  in-

ternational adjudication--or what he really means, an agree-ment  to  give  the  result  of  such  adjudication  domestic  legal 
effect--can  be  a  treaty  obligation  like  any  other,  so  long as  the  agreement  is  consistent  with  the  Constitution.  See 
Brief  for  Petitioner  20.  The  point  is  that  the  particular 
treaty  obligations  on  which  Medelli'n  relies  do  not  of  their own force create domestic law. 

The dissent worries that our decision casts doubt on some 70-odd treaties under which the United States has agreed to 
submit  disputes  to  the  ICJ  according  to  "roughly  similar" 
provisions.  See  post,  at  540-541,  552-553.  Again,  under 
our  established  precedent,  some  treaties  are  self-executing 
and  some  are  not,  depending  on  the  treaty.  That  the  judg-
ment of an international tribunal might not automatically be-
come  domestic  law  hardly  means  the  underlying  treaty  is 
"useless."  See  post,  at  553;  cf.  post,  at  548  (describing  the 
British  system  in  which  treaties  "virtually  always  requir[e] 
parliamentary  legislation").  Such  judgments  would  still 
constitute international obligations, the proper subject of po-
litical and diplomatic negotiations.  See Head Money Cases, 
112  U. S.,  at  598.  And  Congress  could  elect  to  give  them 
wholesale effect (rather than the judgment-by-judgment ap-
proach hypothesized by the dissent, post, at 560) through im-
plementing  legislation,  as  it  regularly  has.  See,  e. g.,  For-

eign  Affairs  Reform  and  Restructuring  Act  of  1998,  $ 2242, 
112 Stat. 2681-822, note following 8 U. S. C. $ 1231 (directing 
the  "appropriate  agencies"  to  "prescribe  regulations  to  im-
plement  the  obligations  of  the  United  States  under  Article 
3"  of  the  Convention  Against  Torture  and  Other  Forms  of 
Cruel,  Inhuman  or  Degrading  Treatment  or  Punishment); 
see also infra, at 521-522 (listing examples of legislation im-
plementing international obligations). 

Further,  that  an  ICJ  judgment  may  not  be  automatically 
enforceable  in  domestic  courts  does  not  mean  the  particular

Opinion of the Court 
underlying treaty is not.  Indeed, we have held that a num-ber of the "Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation" Treaties 

cited  by  the  dissent,  see  Appendix  B,  post,  are  self-executing--based  on  "the  language  of  the[se]  Treat[ies]." 
See  Sumitomo  Shoji  America,  Inc.,  supra,  at  180,  189-190. In 

Kolovrat v.  Oregon, 366  U. S. 187, 191, 196  (1961),  for  ex-
ample,  the  Court  found  that  Yugoslavian  claimants  denied 
inheritance  under  Oregon  law  were  entitled  to  inherit  per-sonal  property  pursuant  to  an  1881  Treaty  of  Friendship, 

Navigation,  and  Commerce  between  the  United  States  and Serbia.  See also 

Clark v.  Allen, 331 U. S. 503, 507-511, 517- 
518  (1947)  (finding  that  the  right  to  inherit  real  property 
granted German aliens under the Treaty of Friendship, Com-
merce  and  Consular  Rights  with  Germany  prevailed  over 
California  law).  Contrary  to  the  dissent's  suggestion,  see 
post, at 547, neither our approach nor our cases require that 
a  treaty  provide  for  self-execution  in  so  many  talismanic 
words; that is a caricature of the Court's opinion.  Our cases 
simply require courts to decide whether a treaty's terms re-
flect a determination by the President who negotiated it and 
the  Senate  that  confirmed  it  that  the  treaty  has  domestic 
effect. 

In  addition,  Congress  is  up  to  the  task  of  implementing 
non-self-executing  treaties,  even  those  involving  complex 
commercial  disputes.  Cf.  post,  at  560  (Breyer,

tion  and  Enforcement  of  Foreign  Arbitral  Awards  of  June 10, 1958, shall be enforced in United States courts in accord-

ance  with  this  chapter,"  $ 201).  Such  language  demon-strates  that  Congress  knows  how  to  accord  domestic  effect 
to  international  obligations  when  it  desires  such  a  result.12 Further,  Medelli'n  frames  his  argument  as  though  giving 
the Avena judgment binding effect in domestic courts simply conforms  to  the  proposition  that  domestic  courts  generally 
give effect to foreign judgments.  But Medelli'n does not ask us to enforce a foreign-court judgment settling a typical com-
mercial or property dispute.  See, e. g., Hilton v.  Guyot, 159 U. S.  113  (1895); 

United  States  v.  Arredondo,  6  Pet.  691 (1832); see also Uniform Foreign Money-Judgments Recogni-

tion  Act  $ 1(2),  13  U.  L.  A.,  pt.  2,  p.  44  (2002)  (" `[F]oreign judgment'  means  any  judgment  of  a  foreign  state  granting 
or denying recovery of a sum of money").  Rather, Medelli'n argues  that  the 

Avena  judgment  has  the  effect  of  enjoining the  operation  of  state  law.  What  is  more,  on  Medelli'n's 

view,  the  judgment  would  force  the  State  to  take  action  to "review  and  reconside[r]"  his  case.  The  general  rule,  how-
ever, is that judgments of foreign courts awarding injunctive relief,  even as to private  parties,  let alone sovereign States, 
"are not generally entitled to enforcement."  See 1 Restate-ment $ 481, Comment b, at 595. 

In sum, while  the  ICJ's judgment in  Avena creates an in-ternational  law  obligation  on  the  part  of  the  United  States, 
it  does  not  of  its  own  force  constitute  binding  federal  law 

12 That  this  Court  has  rarely  had  occasion  to  find  a  treaty  non-self-
executing is not all that surprising.  See post, at 545 (Breyer,

that  pre-empts  state  restrictions  on  the  filing  of  successive habeas  petitions.  As  we  noted  in  Sanchez-Llamas,  a  con-

trary  conclusion  would  be  extraordinary,  given  that  basic rights  guaranteed  by  our  own  Constitution  do  not  have  the 
effect  of  displacing  state  procedural  rules.  See  548  U. S., at  360.  Nothing  in  the  text,  background,  negotiating  and 
drafting  history,  or  practice  among  signatory  nations  sug-gests  that  the  President  or  Senate  intended  the  improbable 
result of giving the judgments of an international tribunal a higher status than that enjoyed by "many of our most funda-
mental constitutional protections."  Ibid. 

III 
Medelli'n  next  argues  that  the  ICJ's  judgment  in  Avena is  binding  on  state  courts  by  virtue  of  the  President's 

February  28,  2005  Memorandum.  The  United  States  con-tends  that  while  the 

Avena  judgment  does  not  of  its  own force  require  domestic  courts  to  set  aside  ordinary  rules  of 

procedural default, that judgment became the law of the land with precisely that effect pursuant to the President's Memo-
randum and his power "to establish binding rules of decision that  preempt  contrary  state  law."  Brief  for  United  States 
as Amicus Curiae 5.  Accordingly, we must decide whether the  President's  declaration  alters  our  conclusion  that  the 
Avena  judgment  is  not  a  rule  of  domestic  law  binding  in state and federal courts.

believe that in the exercise of his Article II powers pursuant to a ratified 
treaty,  the  President  can  never  take  action  that  would  result  in  setting 
aside  state  law."  Post,  at  564.  We  agree.  The  questions  here  are  the 
far  more  limited  ones  of  whether  he  may  unilaterally  create  federal  law 
by giving effect to the judgment of this international tribunal pursuant to 
this  non-self-executing  treaty,  and,  if  not,  whether  he  may  rely  on  other 
authority under the Constitution to support the action taken in this partic-
ular case.  Those are the only questions we decide.

Nacional  de  Cuba,  406  U. S.  759,  767  (1972)  (plurality  opin-ion) (The President has "the lead role . . . in  foreign policy"); 

American Ins. Assn. v.  Garamendi, 539 U. S. 396, 414 (2003) 
(Article II of the Constitution  places with  the President the " `vast  share  of  responsibility  for  the  conduct  of  our  foreign 

relations' " (quoting Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v.  Sawyer, 343  U. S.  579,  610-611  (1952)  (Frankfurter,  J.,  concurring))). 
In  this  case,  the  President  seeks  to  vindicate  United  States 
interests in ensuring the reciprocal observance of the Vienna 
Convention,  protecting  relations  with  foreign  governments, 
and  demonstrating  commitment  to  the  role  of  international 
law.  These interests are plainly compelling. 

Such considerations, however, do not allow us to set aside 
first  principles.  The  President's  authority  to  act,  as  with 
the  exercise  of  any  governmental  power,  "must  stem  either 
from  an  act  of  Congress  or  from  the  Constitution  itself." 
Youngstown,  supra,  at  585;  Dames  &  Moore  v.  Regan,  453 
U. S. 654, 668 (1981). 

Justice  Jackson's  familiar  tripartite  scheme  provides  the 
accepted  framework  for  evaluating  executive  action  in  this 
area.  First,  "[w]hen  the  President  acts  pursuant  to  an  ex-
press  or  implied  authorization  of  Congress,  his  authority  is 
at  its  maximum,  for  it  includes  all  that  he  possesses  in  his 
own  right  plus  all  that  Congress  can  delegate."  Youngs-
town,   343  U. S.,  at  635  (concurring  opinion).  Second, 
"[w]hen  the  President  acts  in  absence  of  either  a  congres-
sional grant or denial of authority, he can only rely upon his 
own  independent  powers,  but  there  is  a  zone  of  twilight  in 
which  he  and  Congress  may  have  concurrent  authority,  or 
in  which its  distribution  is  uncertain."  Id.,  at  637.  In this 
circumstance, Presidential authority can derive support from 
"congressional  inertia,  indifference  or  quiescence."  Ibid.

Opinion of the Court 
Finally,  "[w]hen  the  President  takes  measures  incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is 

at its lowest ebb," and the Court can sustain his actions "only by  disabling  the  Congress  from  acting  upon  the  subject." 
Id., at 637-638.  B 

The  United  States  marshals  two  principal  arguments  in favor of the President's authority "to establish binding rules 
of  decision  that  preempt  contrary  state  law."  Brief  for United  States  as 

Amicus  Curiae  5.  The  Solicitor  General first argues that the relevant treaties give the President the 

authority  to  implement  the  Avena  judgment  and  that  Con-gress has acquiesced  in the  exercise of such authority.  The 
United  States  also  relies  upon  an  "independent"  interna-tional  dispute-resolution  power  wholly  apart  from  the  as-
serted  authority  based  on  the  pertinent  treaties.  Medelli'n adds the additional argument that the President's Memoran-
dum  is  a  valid  exercise  of  his  power  to  take  care  that  the laws be faithfully executed.

The  United  States  maintains  that  the  President's  Memo-randum is authorized by the Optional Protocol and the U. N. 

Charter.  Brief  for  United  States  as  Amicus  Curiae  9. That  is,  because  the  relevant  treaties  "create  an  obligation 
to comply with  Avena," they "implicitly give the President authority  to  implement  that  treaty-based  obligation." 

Id., at 11 (emphasis added).  As a result, the President's Memo-

randum is well grounded in the first category of the Youngs-town framework. 

We  disagree.  The President  has  an  array of  political  and diplomatic  means  available  to  enforce  international  obliga-
tions, but unilaterally converting a non-self-executing treaty into  a self-executing  one  is  not  among them.  The  responsi-
bility  for  transforming  an  international  obligation  arising from  a  non-self-executing  treaty  into  domestic  law  falls  to

Opinion of the Court 
Congress.  Foster, 2 Pet., at 315; Whitney, 124 U. S., at 194; 
Igartu' a-De  La  Rosa,  417  F.  3d,  at  150.  As  this  Court  has 
explained,  when  treaty  stipulations  are  "not  self-executing they  can  only  be  enforced  pursuant  to  legislation  to  carry 

them  into  effect."  Whitney,  supra,  at  194.  Moreover, "[u]ntil  such  act  shall  be  passed,  the  Court  is  not  at  liberty 
to  disregard  the  existing  laws  on  the  subject."  Foster, 
supra, at 315. The requirement that Congress, rather than the President, 

implement a  non-self-executing treaty derives from  the text of  the  Constitution,  which  divides  the  treaty-making  power 
between  the  President  and  the  Senate.  The  Constitution 
vests  the  President  with  the  authority  to  "make"  a  treaty. 
Art.  II,  $ 2.  If  the  Executive  determines  that  a  treaty 
should have domestic effect of its own force, that determina-
tion may be implemented in "mak[ing]" the treaty, by ensur-
ing  that  it  contains  language  plainly  providing  for  domestic 
enforceability.  If  the  treaty  is  to  be  self-executing  in  this 
respect, the Senate must consent to the treaty by the requi-
site two-thirds vote, ibid., consistent with all other constitu-
tional restraints. 

Once a treaty is ratified without provisions clearly accord-
ing it domestic effect, however, whether the treaty will ever 
have  such  effect  is  governed  by  the  fundamental  constitu-
tional  principle  that  " `[t]he  power  to  make  the  necessary 
laws is in Congress; the power to execute in the President.' " 
Hamdan  v.  Rumsfeld,  548  U. S.  557,  591  (2006)  (quot-
ing  Ex  parte  Milligan,  4  Wall.  2,  139  (1866)  (opinion  of 
Chase,  C.  J.));  see  U. S.  Const.,  Art.  I,  $ 1  ("All  legislative 
Powers  herein  granted  shall  be  vested  in  a  Congress  of  the 
United States").  As already  noted, the terms  of a non-self-
executing  treaty  can  become  domestic  law  only  in  the  same 
way as any other law--through passage of legislation by both 
Houses  of  Congress,  combined  with  either  the  President's 
signature  or a  congressional override  of a  Presidential veto. 
See  Art.  I,  $ 7.  Indeed,  "the  President's  power  to  see  that

Opinion of the Court 
the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker." 

Youngstown, 343 U. S., at 587. 
A  non-self-executing  treaty,  by  definition,  is  one  that  was ratified with the understanding that it is not to have domes-

tic effect of its own force.  That understanding precludes the assertion  that  Congress  has  implicitly  authorized  the  Pres-
ident--acting  on  his  own--to  achieve  precisely  the  same 
result.  We  therefore  conclude,  given  the  absence  of  con-gressional  legislation,  that  the  non-self-executing  treaties 

at  issue  here  did  not  "express[ly]  or  implied[ly]"  vest  the President  with  the  unilateral  authority  to  make  them  self-
executing.  See  id.,  at  635  (Jackson,  J.,  concurring).  Ac-
cordingly,  the  President's  Memorandum  does  not  fall  within 
the first category of the Youngstown framework. 

Indeed,  the  preceding  discussion  should  make  clear  that 
the  non-self-executing  character  of  the  relevant  treaties  not 
only  refutes  the  notion  that  the  ratifying  parties  vested  the 
President with the authority to unilaterally make treaty obli-
gations  binding  on  domestic  courts,  but  also  implicitly  pro-
hibits  him  from  doing  so.  When  the  President  asserts  the 
power  to  "enforce"  a  non-self-executing  treaty  by  unilater-
ally  creating  domestic  law,  he  acts  in  conflict  with  the  im-
plicit  understanding  of  the  ratifying  Senate.  His  assertion 
of  authority,  insofar  as  it  is  based  on  the  pertinent  non-self-
executing treaties, is therefore within Justice Jackson's third 
category,  not  the  first  or  even  the  second.  See  id.,  at 
637-638. 

Each  of  the  two  means  described  above  for  giving  do-
mestic  effect  to  an  international treaty  obligation  under  the 
Constitution--for  making  law--requires  joint  action  by  the 
Executive  and  Legislative  Branches:  The  Senate  can  ratify 
a  self-executing  treaty  "ma[de]"  by  the  Executive,  or,  if  the 
ratified  treaty  is  not  self-executing,  Congress  can  enact  im-
plementing legislation approved by the President.  It should 
not be surprising that our Constitution does not contemplate 
vesting such power in the Executive alone.  As Madison ex-

Opinion of the Court 
plained  in  The  Federalist  No.  47,  under  our  constitutional system  of  checks  and  balances,  "[t]he  magistrate  in  whom 

the whole executive power resides cannot of himself make a law."  J.  Cooke  ed.,  p.  326  (1961).  That  would,  however, 
seem  an  apt  description  of  the  asserted  executive  authority unilaterally  to  give  the  effect  of  domestic  law  to  obligations 
under a non-self-executing treaty. The  United  States  nonetheless  maintains  that  the  Presi-
dent's  Memorandum  should  be  given  effect  as  domestic  law because "this case involves a valid Presidential action in the 
context  of  Congressional  `acquiescence.' "  Brief  for  United States  as 

Amicus  Curiae  11,  n.  2.  Under  the  Youngstown tripartite  framework,  congressional  acquiescence  is  perti-

nent when the President's action falls within the second cate-gory--that  is,  when  he  "acts  in  absence  of  either  a  con-
gressional  grant  or  denial  of  authority."  343  U. S.,  at  637 (Jackson,  J.,  concurring).  Here,  however,  as  we  have  ex-
plained,  the  President's  effort  to  accord  domestic  effect  to the 

Avena judgment does not meet that prerequisite. In  any  event,  even  if  we  were  persuaded  that  congres-

sional  acquiescence  could  support  the  President's  asserted authority  to  create  domestic  law  pursuant  to  a  non-self-
executing  treaty,  such  acquiescence  does  not  exist  here. The United States first locates congressional acquiescence in 
Congress's failure to act following the President's resolution of prior ICJ controversies.  A review of the Executive's ac-
tions in those prior cases, however, cannot support the claim that Congress acquiesced in this particular exercise of Presi-
dential  authority,  for  none  of  them  remotely  involved  trans-forming  an  international  obligation  into  domestic  law  and 
thereby displacing state law.14 

14 Rather,  in  the  Case  Concerning  Military  and  Paramilitary  Activi-
ties in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v.  U. S.), 1986 I. C. J. 14 (Judgment 
of  June  27),  the  President  determined  that  the  United  States  would  not 
comply with the ICJ's conclusion that the United States owed reparations 
to  Nicaragua.  In  the  Case  Concerning  Delimitation  of  the  Maritime

Opinion of the Court 
The  United  States  also  directs  us  to  the  President's  "re-lated" statutory responsibilities and to his "established role" 

in litigating foreign policy concerns as support for the Presi-dent's asserted authority to give the ICJ's decision in Avena 
the  force  of  domestic  law.  Brief  for  United  States  as  Ami-
cus  Curiae  16-19.  Congress  has  indeed  authorized  the President  to  represent  the  United  States  before  the  United 

Nations, the ICJ, and the Security Council, 22 U. S. C. $ 287, but  the  authority  of  the  President  to  represent  the  United 

Boundary in the Gulf of Maine Area (Can. v. U.  S.), 1984 I. C. J. 246 (Judg-
ment of Oct. 12), a federal agency--the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration--issued a final rule which complied with the ICJ's bound-
ary  determination.  The  Case  Concerning  Rights  of  Nationals  of  the 
United States of America in Morocco (Fr. v.  U.  S.), 1952 I. C. J. 176 (Judg-
ment of Aug. 27), concerned the legal status of United States citizens liv-
ing in Morocco; it was not enforced in United States courts. 

The  final  two  cases  arose  under  the  Vienna  Convention.  In  the 
LaGrand  Case (F.  R.  G.  v.  U.  S.), 2001 I.  C.  J.  466 (Judgment  of June 27), 
the  ICJ  ordered  the  review  and  reconsideration  of  convictions  and  sen-
tences of German nationals denied consular notification.  In response, the 
State  Department  sent  letters  to  the  States  "encouraging"  them  to  con-
sider  the  Vienna  Convention  in  the  clemency  process.  Brief  for  United 
States  as  Amicus  Curiae  20-21.  Such  encouragement  did  not  give  the 
ICJ judgment direct effect as domestic law; thus, it cannot serve as prece-
dent for doing so in which Congress might be said to have acquiesced.  In 
the  Case  Concerning  the  Vienna  Convention  on  Consular  Relations 
(Para.  v.  U.  S.),  1998  I.  C.  J.  248  (Judgment  of  Apr.  9),  the  ICJ  issued  a 
provisional order, directing the United States to "take all measures at its 
disposal to ensure that [Breard] is not executed pending the final decision 
in [the ICJ's] proceedings."  Breard, 523 U. S., at 374 (internal quotation 
marks omitted; emphasis added).  In response, the Secretary of State sent 
a letter to the Governor of Virginia requesting that he stay Breard's exe-
cution.  Id., at 378.  When Paraguay sought a stay of execution from this 
Court,  the  United  States  argued  that  it  had  taken  every  measure  at  its 
disposal: because "our federal system imposes limits on the federal govern-
ment's ability to interfere with the criminal justice systems of the States," 
those measures included "only persuasion," not "legal compulsion."  Brief 
for United States as Amicus Curiae, O. T. 1997, No. 97-8214 (A-732), p. 51. 
This  of  course  is  precedent  contrary  to  the  proposition  asserted  by  the 
Solicitor General in this case.

530  MEDELLIN  v.  TEXAS 

Opinion of the Court 
States before such bodies speaks to the President's interna-tional responsibilities, not any unilateral authority to create 

domestic  law.  The  authority  expressly  conferred  by  Con-gress  in  the  international  realm  cannot  be  said  to  "invite" 
the  Presidential  action  at  issue  here.  See  Youngstown, 
supra,  at  637  (Jackson,  J.,  concurring).  At  bottom,  none  of the sources of authority identified by the United States sup-

ports  the  President's  claim  that  Congress  has  acquiesced  in his  asserted  power  to establish on his  own  federal law or to 
override state law. None  of  this  is  to  say,  however,  that  the  combination  of  a 
non-self-executing treaty and the lack of implementing legis-lation precludes the President from acting to comply with an 
international  treaty  obligation.  It  is  only  to  say  that  the Executive  cannot  unilaterally  execute  a  non-self-executing 
treaty  by  giving  it  domestic  effect.  That  is,  the  non-self-executing  character  of  a  treaty  constrains  the  President's 
ability  to  comply  with  treaty  commitments  by  unilaterally making  the  treaty  binding  on  domestic  courts.  The  Presi-
dent may comply with the treaty's obligations by some other means,  so long  as they  are  consistent  with  the  Constitution. 
But he may not rely upon a non-self-executing treaty to "es-tablish binding rules of decision that preempt contrary state 
law."  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 5. 

2 
We  thus  turn  to  the  United States'  claim  that--independ-ent  of  the  United  States'  treaty  obligations--the  Memoran-

dum  is  a  valid  exercise  of  the  President's  foreign  affairs  au-thority to resolve claims disputes with foreign nations.  Id., 
at  12-16.  The  United  States  relies  on  a  series  of  cases  in which  this  Court  has  upheld  the  authority  of  the  President 
to settle foreign claims pursuant to an executive agreement.

Opinion of the Court 
United States v.  Belmont, 301 U. S. 324, 330 (1937).  In these cases  this  Court  has  explained  that,  if  pervasive  enough,  a 

history  of  congressional  acquiescence  can  be  treated  as  a "gloss  on  `Executive  Power'  vested  in  the  President  by  $ 1 
of  Art.  II."  Dames  &  Moore,  supra,  at  686  (some  internal quotation marks omitted). 

This  argument  is  of  a  different  nature  than  the  one  re-jected  above.  Rather  than  relying  on  the  United  States' 
treaty  obligations,  the  President  relies  on  an  independent source of authority in ordering Texas  to put aside its proce-
dural  bar  to  successive  habeas  petitions.  Nevertheless,  we find  that  our  claims-settlement  cases  do  not  support  the  au-
thority that the President asserts in this case. The  claims-settlement  cases  involve  a  narrow  set  of  cir-
cumstances:  the  making  of  executive  agreements  to  settle civil  claims  between  American  citizens  and  foreign  govern-
ments  or  foreign  nationals.  See,  e. g.,  Belmont,  supra,  at 327.  They  are  based  on  the  view  that  "a  systematic,  un-
broken,  executive  practice,  long  pursued  to  the  knowledge of  the  Congress  and  never  before  questioned,"  can  "raise 
a  presumption  that  the  [action]  had  been  [taken]  in  pursu-ance of its consent."  Dames & Moore, supra, at 686 (inter-
nal  quotation  marks  omitted).  As  this  Court  explained  in Garamendi: 

"Making executive agreements to settle claims of Amer-ican nationals against foreign governments is  a particu-
larly  longstanding  practice  .  .  .  .  Given  the  fact  that the  practice goes  back over  200  years, and  has  received 
congressional  acquiescence  throughout  its  history,  the conclusion  that  the  President's  control  of  foreign  rela-
tions  includes  the  settlement  of  claims  is  indisputable." 539  U. S.,  at  415  (internal  quotation  marks  and  brack-
ets omitted). 
Even  still,  the  limitations  on  this  source  of  executive  power are  clearly  set  forth  and  the  Court  has  been  careful  to  note

Opinion of the Court 
that  "[p]ast  practice  does  not,  by  itself,  create  power." Dames & Moore, supra, at 686. 

The  President's  Memorandum  is  not  supported  by  a  "par-ticularly  longstanding  practice"  of  congressional  acquies-
cence,  see  Garamendi,  supra, at  415,  but rather  is  what  the United States itself has described as "unprecedented action," 
Brief  for  United  States  as  Amicus  Curiae  in  SanchezLlamas, O. T. 2005, Nos. 05-51 and 04-10566, pp. 29-30.  In-deed, the Government has not  identified a single instance in 

which  the  President  has  attempted  (or  Congress  has  acqui-esced in) a Presidential directive issued to state courts, much 
less one that reaches deep into the heart of the State's police powers  and  compels  state  courts  to  reopen  final  criminal 
judgments  and  set  aside  neutrally  applicable  state  laws. Cf. 

Brecht v.  Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 635 (1993) ("States possess  primary  authority  for  defining  and  enforcing  the 

criminal  law"  (quoting  Engle  v.  Isaac,  456  U. S.  107,  128 (1982); internal quotation marks omitted)).  The Executive's 
narrow  and  strictly  limited  authority  to  settle  international claims  disputes  pursuant  to  an  executive  agreement  can-
not  stretch  so  far  as  to  support  the  current  Presidential Memorandum.

Medelli'n  argues  that  the  President's  Memorandum  is  a valid  exercise  of  his  "[T]ake  Care"  power.  Brief  for  Peti-

tioner  28.  The  United  States,  however,  does  not  rely  upon the  President's  responsibility  to  "take  Care  that  the  Laws 
be faithfully executed."  U. S. Const., Art. II, $ 3.  We think this a wise concession.  This authority allows the President 
to  execute  the  laws,  not  make  them.  For  the  reasons  we have stated, the 

Avena judgment is not domestic law; accord-ingly,  the  President  cannot  rely  on  his  Take  Care  powers 

here. The  judgment  of  the  Texas  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  is 
affirmed. 

It is so ordered.

Opinion of the Court 

I 
This case began as a lease dispute between landlord, peti-tioner  Hall  Street  Associates,  L.  L. C.,  and tenant,  respond-

ent  Mattel,  Inc.  The  property  was  used  for  many  years  as a manufacturing site, and the leases provided that the tenant 
would  indemnify  the  landlord  for  any  costs  resulting  from the  failure  of  the  tenant  or  its  predecessor  lessees  to  follow 
environmental  laws  while  using  the  premises.  App.  88-89. Tests  of  the  property's  well  water  in  1998  showed  high 
levels  of  trichloroethylene  (TCE),  the  apparent  residue  of manufacturing  discharges by  Mattel's predecessors  between 
1951  and  1980.  After  the  Oregon  Department  of  Environ-mental  Quality  (DEQ)  discovered  even  more  pollutants, 
Mattel  stopped  drawing  from  the  well  and,  along  with  one of  its  predecessors,  signed  a  consent  order  with  the  DEQ 
providing for cleanup of the site. After  Mattel  gave  notice  of  intent  to  terminate  the  lease 
in  2001,  Hall  Street  filed  this  suit,  contesting  Mattel's  right to  vacate  on  the  date  it  gave,  and  claiming  that  the  lease 
obliged Mattel to indemnify Hall Street for costs of cleaning up  the  TCE,  among  other  things.  Following  a  bench  trial 
before  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the  District  of Oregon,  Mattel  won  on  the  termination  issue,  and  after  an 
unsuccessful  try  at  mediating  the  indemnification  claim,  the parties  proposed  to  submit  to  arbitration.  The  District 
Court was amenable, and the parties drew up an arbitration agreement,  which  the  court  approved  and  entered  as  an 
order.  One paragraph of the agreement provided that 

"[t]he  United  States  District  Court  for  the  District  of Oregon  may enter  judgment  upon any  award, either  by 

confirming  the  award  or  by  vacating,  modifying  or  cor-recting  the  award.  The  Court  shall  vacate,  modify  or 
correct  any award: (i)  where  the arbitrator's  findings of facts  are  not  supported  by  substantial  evidence,  or  (ii) 
where the arbitrator's conclusions of law are erroneous." App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a.

Opinion of the Court 
The  Courts  of  Appeals  have  split  over  the  exclusiveness of these statutory grounds when parties take the FAA short-

cut to confirm, vacate, or modify an award, with some saying the  recitations  are  exclusive,  and  others  regarding  them  as 
mere threshold provisions open to expansion by agreement.5 

"(1)  where  the  award  was  procured  by  corruption,  fraud,  or  undue 
means; 

"(2)  where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators, 
or either of them; 

"(3)  where  the  arbitrators  were  guilty  of  misconduct  in  refusing  to 
postpone the  hearing,  upon  sufficient cause  shown,  or  in  refusing  to  hear 
evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other misbe-
havior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced; or 

"(4)  where  the  arbitrators  exceeded  their  powers,  or  so  imperfectly 
executed  them  that  a  mutual,  final,  and  definite  award  upon  the  subject 
matter submitted was not made." 

Title 9 U. S. C. $ 11 (2000 ed.) provides: 
"In either of the following cases the United States court in and for the 
district  wherein  the  award  was  made  may  make  an  order  modifying  or 
correcting the award upon the application of any party to the arbitration-- 

"(a)  Where  there  was  an  evident  material  miscalculation  of  figures  or 
an  evident  material  mistake  in  the  description  of  any  person,  thing,  or 
property referred to in the award. 

"(b)  Where the arbitrators have awarded upon a matter not submitted 
to them, unless it is a matter not affecting the merits of the decision upon 
the matter submitted. 

"(c)  Where  the  award  is  imperfect  in  matter  of  form  not  affecting  the 
merits of the controversy. 

"The order may modify and correct the award, so as to effect the intent 
thereof and promote justice between the parties." 

5 The Ninth and Tenth Circuits have held that parties may not contract 

for  expanded  judicial  review.  See  Kyocera

Opinion of the Court 
That  aside,  expanding  the  detailed  categories  would  rub 
too much against the grain of the $ 9 language, where provi-
sion  for  judicial  confirmation  carries  no  hint  of  flexibility. 
On application for an order confirming the arbitration award, 
the  court  "must  grant"  the  order  "unless  the  award  is  va-
cated, modified, or corrected as prescribed in sections 10 and 
11  of  this  title."  There  is  nothing  malleable  about  "must 
grant,"  which  unequivocally  tells  courts  to  grant  confirma-
tion in all cases, except when one of the "prescribed" excep-
tions applies.  This does not sound remotely like a provision 
meant  to tell  a  court  what  to do  just  in case  the  parties say 
nothing else.6 

In  fact,  anyone  who  thinks  Congress  might  have  under-
stood $ 9 as a default provision should turn back to $ 5 for an 
example of what Congress thought a default provision would 
look like: 

6 Hall  Street  claims  that  $ 9  supports  its  position,  because  it  allows  a 
court  to  confirm  an  award  only  "[i]f  the  parties  in  their  agreement  have 
agreed that a judgment of the court shall be entered upon the award made 
pursuant to the arbitration."  Hall  Street argues that this language  "ex-
presses Congress's intent that a court must enforce the agreement of the 
parties as to whether, and under what circumstances, a judgment shall be 
entered."  Reply Brief for Petitioner 5; see also Brief for Petitioner 22-24. 
It is a peculiar argument, converting agreement  as a  necessary condition 
for  judicial  enforcement  into  a  sufficient  condition  for  a  court  to  bar  en-
forcement.  And  the  text  is  otherwise  problematical  for  Hall  Street:  $ 9 
says  that  if  the  parties  have  agreed  to  judicial  enforcement,  the  court 
"must grant" confirmation unless grounds for vacatur or modification exist 
under  $ 10  or  $ 11.  The  sentence  nowhere  predicates  the  court's  judicial 
action  on  the  parties'  having  agreed  to  specific  standards;  if  anything,  it 
suggests  that,  so  long  as  the  parties  contemplated  judicial  enforcement, 
the court  must undertake such  enforcement under  the  statutory criteria. 
In any case, the  arbitration agreement  here did not specifically  predicate 
entry of judgment on adherence to its judicial review standard.  See App. 
to Pet. for Cert. 15a.  To the extent Hall Street argues otherwise, it con-
tests  not  the  meaning  of  the  FAA  but  the  Ninth  Circuit's  severability 
analysis, upon which it did not seek certiorari.

Syllabus 
to  New  Jersey  by  Article  VII  is  not  exclusive  and  that  Delaware  has 
overlapping  jurisdiction,  within  the  twelve-mile  circle,  to  regulate  im-
provements outshore  of the low-water mark on the New Jersey side of 
the River.  New Jersey filed exceptions. 
Held:  Article VII  of  the 1905  Compact  did not  secure  to New  Jersey ex-

clusive  jurisdiction  over  all  riparian  improvements  commencing  on  its 
shores;  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  have  overlapping  authority  to  regu-
late  riparian  structures  and  operations  of  extraordinary  character 
extending  outshore  of  New  Jersey's  domain  into  territory  over  which 
Delaware is sovereign.  Pp. 609-623. 

(a)  The Court rejects New Jersey's argument that Article VII, which 
accords each State "riparian jurisdiction of every kind and nature," bars 
Delaware from any encroachment upon New Jersey's authority over im-
provements extending from New Jersey's shore.  Pp. 609-615. 

(1)  The  novel  term  "riparian  jurisdiction,"  as  used  in  Article  VII, 
is  properly  read  as  a  limiting  modifier  and  does  not  mean  "exclusive 
jurisdiction."  "[R]iparian  jurisdiction"  has  never  been  a  legal  term  of 
art, and appears  to  be a  verbal  formulation  the  1905  Compact  negotia-
tors  devised  specifically  for  Article  VII.  Elsewhere  in  the  1905  Com-
pact--most  notably,  in  Article  VIII--the  more  familiar  term  "jurisdic-
tion"  or  "exclusive  jurisdiction"  appears.  Attributing  to  "riparian 
jurisdiction" the same meaning as "jurisdiction" unmodified, or equating 
the novel term with the formulation "exclusive jurisdiction," would deny 
operative  effect  to  each  word  in  the  Compact.  See  United  States  v. 
Menasche,  348  U. S.  528,  538-539.  Presumably  drafted  in  recognition 
of  the  still-unresolved  boundary  dispute,  Article  VIII  requires  an  ex-
press  statement  in  the  Compact  in  order  to  "affect  the  territorial  .  .  . 
jurisdiction  of  either  State  .  .  .  over  the  Delaware  River."  The  Court 
resists  reading  the  uncommon  term  "riparian  jurisdiction,"  even  when 
aggrandized  by  the  phrase  "of  every  kind  and  nature,"  as  effectuating 
a  transfer  to  New  Jersey  of  Delaware's  entire  "territorial  .  .  . 
jurisdiction . . .  over  [the  portion  of]  the  Delaware  River  [in  ques-
tion]."  Pp. 610-612. 

(2)  A  riparian  landowner  ordinarily  enjoys  the  right  to  build  a 
wharf to access navigable waters far enough to  permit the loading and 
unloading  of  ships.  But  that  right,  New  Jersey  agrees,  is  subject  to 
state regulation for the protection of the public.  New Jersey sees itself, 
however, as the only State empowered to regulate, for the benefit of the 
public, New Jersey landowners' exercise of riparian rights.  Commonly, 
the State that grants riparian rights also has regulatory authority over 
their  exercise.  But  the  1905  Compact's  negotiators  faced  an  unusual 
situation: As long as the boundary issue remained unsettled, they could 
not  know  which  State  was  sovereign  within  the  twelve-mile  circle  be-

Syllabus 
yond New Jersey's shore.  They likely knew, however, that "[t]he rights 
of  a  riparian  owner  [seeking  to  wharf  out  into]  a  navigable  stream . . .  
are  governed  by  the  law  of  the  state  in  which  the  stream  is  situated." 
Weems Steamboat Co. of Baltimore v.  People's Steamboat Co., 214 U. S. 
345, 355.  With the sovereignty issue reserved by the 1905 Compact for 
another day, it is difficult to gainsay the Special Master's conclusion that 
Article VII's reference to "riparian jurisdiction" did not mean "exclusive 
jurisdiction."  Endeavoring  to  harmonize  Article  VII  with  the  bound-
ary determination, the Special Master concluded that Article VII's pres-
ervation to each State of "riparian jurisdiction" gave New Jersey control 
of  the riparian rights  ordinarily  and  usually  enjoyed by  landowners on 
New Jersey's shore.  But once the boundary line at low water is passed, 
the Special Master further concluded, New Jersey's regulatory authority 
is  qualified.  Just  as  New  Jersey  cannot  grant  land  belonging  to  Dela-
ware, New  Jersey  cannot  authorize activities  that go  beyond  the  exer-
cise of ordinary and usual riparian rights in the face of contrary regula-
tion by Delaware.  Pp. 612-615. 

(b)  An 1834 compact between New Jersey and New York establishing 
the two States' common Hudson River boundary casts informative light 
on  the  1905  New  Jersey-Delaware  Compact.  Similar  to  the  boundary 
settled  in  New Jersey  v.  Delaware II,  the 1834  accord located  the New 
Jersey-New  York  boundary  at  "the  low  water-mark  on  the . . . New  
Jersey side [of the Hudson River,]" 4 Stat. 710.  Unlike the 1905 Com-
pact,  however,  the  1834  agreement  expressly  gave  New  Jersey  "the 
exclusive  right  of  property  in  and  to  .  .  .  land  under  water"  and 
"the  exclusive  jurisdiction  of  and  over  the  wharves,  docks,  and 
improvements  .  . .  on  the  shore of  the  said  state  . .  . ,"  ibid.  (emphasis 
added).  Comparable language is noticeably absent in Article VII of the 
1905  Compact,  while  other  provisions  of  the  Compact  appear  to  have 
been  adopted  almost  verbatim  from  the  1834  New  Jersey-New  York 
accord.  New Jersey, therefore, could hardly claim ignorance that Arti-
cle  VII  could  have  been  but  was  not  drafted  to  grant  it  "exclusive 

jurisdiction"  (not  merely  "riparian  jurisdiction")  over  wharves  and 
other  improvements  extending  from  its  shore  into  navigable  waters. 
Pp. 615-617. 

(c)  Virginia  v.  Maryland,  540 U. S. 56, 75--in  which  this Court held 
that a Maryland-Virginia boundary settlement gave Virginia "sovereign 
authority,  free  from  regulation  by  Maryland,  to  build  improvements 
appurtenant  to  [Virginia's]  shore  and  to  withdraw  water  from  the 
[Potomac] River"--provides scant support for New Jersey's claim.  As 
the Special Master explained, the result in Virginia v.  Maryland turned 
on the unique language of the 1785 compact and 1877 arbitration award 
there  involved.  The  1785  compact  addressed  only  "the  right  [of  the

citizens of each State] to build wharves and improvements regardless of 
which State ultimately was determined to be sovereign over the River," 
id.,  at  69.  Concerning  the  States  themselves,  the  1877  arbitration 
award  that  settled  the  boundary  was  definitive.  See  id.,  at  75.  By 
recognizing in that award Virginia's right, "qua sovereign," "to use the 
River  beyond  low-water  mark,"  id.,  at  72,  the  arbitrators  manifested 
their  intention  to  safeguard  Virginia's  authority  to  construct  riparian 
improvements outshore of the  low-water mark  free  from  regulation  by 
Maryland.  By  contrast,  neither  the  1905  Compact  nor  New  Jersey  v. 
Delaware II purported to give New Jersey all regulatory oversight (as 
opposed to only "riparian jurisdiction").  Pp. 617-618. 

(d)  Delaware's  claim to  regulatory  authority  is  further supported  by 
New  Jersey's  acceptance  (until  the  present  controversy)  of  Delaware's 
jurisdiction over water and land within its domain to preserve the qual-
ity  and  prevent  deterioration  of  its  coastal  areas.  When  New  Jersey 
sought  federal  approval  for  its  coastal  management  program,  it  made 
the representation--fundamentally inconsistent with its position here-- 
that any New Jersey project extending beyond mean low water within 
the  twelve-mile  circle  would  require  coastal  permits  from  both  States. 
DNREC,  with  no  objection  from  New  Jersey,  had  previously  rejected 
as a prohibited bulk transfer facility an earlier request to build an LNG 
terminal  extending  from  New  Jersey  into  Delaware.  DNREC  issued 
permits  for  each  of  the  three  structures  extending  from  New  Jersey 
into Delaware built between 1969 and 2006, one of them undertaken by 
New Jersey itself.  Even during  the pendency of this action,  New Jer-
sey applied to Delaware for renewal of the permit covering the portion 
of New Jersey's project that extended into Delaware.  Pp. 618-621. 

(e)  Nowhere does Article VII "expressly set forth," in Article VIII's 
words, Delaware's lack of any governing authority over territory within 
the State's own borders.  The Special Master correctly determined that 
Delaware's  pre-1971  "hands  off "  policy  regarding  coastal  development 
did  not  signal  that  the  State  never  could  or  never  would  assert  any 
regulatory authority over structures using its subaqueous land.  In the 
decades  since  Delaware,  pursuant  to  the  DCZA,  began  to  manage  its 
waters and submerged lands, the State has followed a consistent course: 
Largely with New Jersey's cooperation, Delaware has checked proposed 
structures and activity extending beyond New Jersey's shore into Dela-
ware's domain in order to protect the natural environment of its coastal 
areas.  P. 622. 

(f)  Given the authority over riparian rights preserved for New Jersey 
by  the  1905  Compact,  Delaware  may  not  impede  ordinary  and  usual 
exercises of the right of riparian owners to wharf out from New Jersey's 
shore.  The project British Petroleum sought to construct and operate,

Opinion of the Court 
however,  goes  well  beyond  the  ordinary  or  usual.  Delaware's  classifi-
cation  of  the  proposed  LNG  unloading  terminal  as  a  "heavy  industry 
use"  and  a  "bulk  product  transfer  facilit[y]"  under  the  DCZA  has  not 
been,  and  hardly  could  be,  challenged  as  inaccurate.  Consistent  with 
the scope of Delaware's retained police power to regulate certain ripar-
ian uses, it was within that State's authority to prohibit construction of 
the LNG facility.  Pp. 622-623. 

Delaware's  authority  to  deny  British  Petroleum  permission  to  construct 

the  proposed  LNG  terminal  confirmed;  New  Jersey's  exceptions  over-
ruled; and the Special Master's proposed decree entered with modifica-
tions consistent with the Court's opinion.

602  NEW  JERSEY  v.  DELAWARE 

Opinion of the Court 
Delaware.  In  an  earlier  contest  between  the  two  States, this Court upheld the title of Delaware to "the river and the 

subaqueous  soil"  within  the  circle  "up  to  [the]  low  water mark  on  the  easterly  or  New  Jersey  side."  New  Jersey  v. 
Delaware, 291 U. S. 361, 385 (1934) (New Jersey v.  Delaware 
II).1  Prior  to  that  1934  boundary  determination,  in  1905, the two States had entered into an accord (1905 Compact or 

Compact),  which  Congress  ratified  in  1907.  The  Compact accommodated  both  States'  concerns  on  matters  over  which 
the  States  had  crossed  swords:  service  of  civil  and  criminal process  on  vessels  and  rights  of  fishery  within  the  twelve-
mile zone.  Although the parties were unable to reach agree-ment on the interstate boundary at that time, the 1905 Com-
pact contained two jurisdictional provisions important to the current dispute: 

"Art.  VII.  Each  State  may,  on  its  own  side  of  the river, continue to exercise riparian jurisdiction of every 
kind and nature, and to make grants, leases, and convey-ances  of riparian lands and rights under  the laws of the 
respective States. "Art. VIII.  Nothing herein contained shall affect the 
territorial  limits,  rights,  or  jurisdiction  of  either  State of,  in,  or  over  the  Delaware  River,  or  the  ownership  of 
the  subaqueous  soil  thereof,  except  as  herein  expressly set forth."  Act of Jan. 24, 1907, 34 Stat. 860. 

The  controversy  we  here  resolve  was  sparked  by  Dela-ware's refusal to grant permission for construction of a lique-
fied natural gas (LNG) unloading terminal that would extend some  2,000 feet  from  New  Jersey's  shore  into  territory 

New Jersey v.  Delaware II adjudged to belong to Delaware.  The

Opinion of the Court 
maintained onshore in New Jersey.  Relying on Article VII of the 1905 Compact, New Jersey urged that it had exclusive 

jurisdiction  over  all  projects  appurtenant  to  its  shores,  in-cluding wharves extending past the low-water mark on New 
Jersey's  side  into  Delaware  territory.  Delaware  asserted 
regulatory  authority,  undiminished  by  Article  VII,  over structures  located  within  its  borders;  in  support,  Delaware 

invoked,  inter  alia,  Article  VIII  of  the  1905  Compact  and our  decision  in 

New  Jersey  v.  Delaware  II.  The  Special 
Master  we  appointed  to  superintend  the  proceedings  filed a  report  recommending  a  determination  that  Delaware  has 

authority  to  regulate  the  proposed  construction,  concur-rently  with  New  Jersey,  to  the  extent  that  the  project 
reached beyond New Jersey's border and extended into Dela-ware's domain. 

We accept the Special Master's recommendation in princi-pal part.  Article VII of the 1905 Compact, we hold, did not 
secure to New Jersey exclusive jurisdiction over all riparian improvements commencing on its shores.

2  The parties' own 

conduct, since the time Delaware has endeavored to regulate 
coastal development, supports the  conclusion to which other relevant factors point: New Jersey and Delaware have over-

lapping  authority  to  regulate  riparian  structures  and  op-erations  of  extraordinary  character  extending  outshore  of 
New  Jersey's  domain  into  territory  over  which  Delaware  is sovereign.

604  NEW  JERSEY  v.  DELAWARE 

Opinion of the Court 
rehearsed  at  length  in  New  Jersey  v.  Delaware  II,  need  not 
be  detailed  here.  In  brief,  tracing  title  through  a  series  of 
deeds  originating  with  a  1682  grant  from  the  Duke  of  York 
to  William  Penn,  Delaware  asserted  dominion,  within  the 
twelve-mile  circle,  over  the  River  and  its  subaqueous  lands 
up  to  the  low-water  mark  on  the  New  Jersey  side.  Id., 
at  364,  374.3  New  Jersey  claimed  sovereign  ownership  up 
to the middle of the navigable channel.  Id., at 363-364. 

The  instant  proceeding  is  the  third  original  action  New 
Jersey has commenced against Delaware involving the Dela-
ware River boundary between the two States.  The first ac-
tion,  New  Jersey  v.  Delaware,  No.  1,  Orig.  (filed  1877)  (New 
Jersey v.  Delaware I), was propelled by the States' disagree-
ments  over  fishing  rights.  See  Report  of  Special  Master  3 
(Report).4  That  case  "slumbered  for  many  years."  New 
Jersey v.  Delaware II, 291 U. S., at 377.  Eventually, the par-
ties  negotiated  a  Compact,  which  both  States  approved  in 
1905, and Congress ratified in 1907.  See Act of Jan. 24, 1907, 
ch.  394,  34  Stat.  858.  Modest  in  comparison  to  the  parties' 
initial aim, the Compact left location of the interstate bound-
ary  an  unsettled  question.5  New  Jersey  then  withdrew  its

available at http://www.pierceatwood.com/custompagedisplay.asp?Show=2. 

5 After  the States  approved the Compact, but prior  to Congress' ratifi-

cation,  the  parties  submitted  a  joint  application  for  suspension  of  Court 
proceedings  pending  action  by  the  National  Legislature.  New  Jersey  v. 
Delaware I, O. T. 1905, No. 1, Orig., Statement of reasons submitted orally 
for the joint application of Counsel on both sides for suspension of proceed-
ings until the further order of the Court (reproduced in 1 App. of Delaware 
on  Cross-Motions  for  Summary  Judgment  190  (hereinafter  Del.  App.)). 
In that submission, Delaware's counsel represented that "[t]he compact . . .  
was . . . not a  settlement of the disputed boundary, but a truce or modus 
vivendi."  Ibid.  Counsel  further  stated  that  the  "main  purpose"  of  the 
Compact  was  to  authorize  joint  regulation  of  "the  business  of  fishing  in 
the Delaware River and Bay."  Ibid.

Opinion of the Court 
complaint  and  this  Court  dismissed  the  case  without  preju-dice.  New Jersey v.  Delaware I, 205 U. S. 550 (1907). 

The second original action, New Jersey v.  Delaware II, was fueled  by  a  dispute  over  ownership  of  an  oyster  bed  in  the 
River  below  the  twelve-mile  circle.  See  Report  14.  In  re-sponse  to  New  Jersey's  complaint,  the  Court  conclusively 
settled  the  boundary  between  the  States.  Confirming  the Special  Master's  report,  the  Court  held  that,  within  the 
twelve-mile  circle,  Delaware  owns  the  River  and  the  sub-aqueous  soil  up  to  the  low-water  mark  on  the  New  Jersey 
side.  291  U. S.,  at  385.6  But  New  Jersey  gained  the  dis-puted  oyster  bed:  South  of  the  circle,  the  Court  adjudged 
the  boundary  "to  be  the  middle  of  the  main  ship  channel  in Delaware  River  and  Bay." 

Ibid.  See  also  New  Jersey  v. Delaware  II,  295  U. S.  694,  699  (1935)  (Decree)  (perpetually 

enjoining  the  States  from  further  disputing  the  boundary). In  upholding  Delaware's  title  to  the  area  within  the 
twelve-mile  circle,  the  Court  rejected  an  argument  pressed by  New  Jersey  based  on  the  1905  Compact:  By  agreeing  to 
the  Compact,  New  Jersey  urged,  Delaware  had  abandoned any claim of ownership beyond the middle of the River.  The 
Court found New Jersey's argument "wholly without force." 291  U. S.,  at  377.  "The  compact  of  1905,"  the  Court  de-
clared,  "provides  for  the  enjoyment  of  riparian  rights,  for concurrent  jurisdiction  in  respect  of civil  and  criminal  proc-
ess, and for concurrent rights of fishery.  Beyond that it does not go."  Id., at 377-378.  The Court next recited in full the 
text  of  Article  VIII  of  the  Compact:  "Nothing  herein  con-tained shall affect the territorial limits, rights, or jurisdiction 
of  either  State  of,  in,  or  over  the  Delaware  River,  or  the ownership  of  the  subaqueous  soil  thereof,  except  as  herein 

6 The dissent suggests, post, at 630, that the long dormant first original 
action "appeared to be going badly" for Delaware.  The strength of Dela-
ware's  claim  to  sovereign  ownership  of  the  riverbed  within  the  twelve-
mile circle, however, is comprehensively described in New Jersey v.  Dela-
ware II, 291 U. S., at 364-378.

The current controversy arose out of the planned construc-tion of facilities to import, store, and vaporize foreign-source 

LNG;  the  proposed  project  would  be  operated  by  Crown Landing,  LLC,  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  British  Petro-
leum  (BP).  See  Report  19;  6  App.  of  Delaware  on  Cross-Motions  for  Summary  Judgment  3793,  3804-3807  (herein-
after Del. App.) (Request for Coastal Zone Status Decision). The  "Crown  Landing"  project  would  include  a  gasification 
plant,  storage  tanks,  and  other  structures  onshore  in  New Jersey,  and  a  pier  and  related  structures  extending  some 
2,000  feet  from  New  Jersey's  shore  into  Delaware.  Report 19-20; 6 Del. App. 3804.  Supertankers with capacities of up 
to  200,000  cubic  meters  (more  than  40  percent  larger  than any ship then  carrying natural gas)  would berth at the pier. 
Id., at 3810.7  A multipart transfer system--including, inter alia,  cryogenic  piping,  a  containment  trough,  and  utility 
lines--would be installed  on the  6,000-square-foot  unloading platform  and  along  the  pier  to  transport  the  LNG  (at  suffi-
ciently  cold  temperatures  to  keep  it  in  a  liquid  state)  from ships  to  three  158,000-cubic-meter  storage  tanks  onshore; 
vapor  byproducts  resulting  from  the  onshore  gasification would  be  returned  to  the  tankers.  Report  19-20;  6  Del. 
App. 3804; 7 id., at 4307 (Cherry Affidavit).  Even "[d]uring the holding mode  of terminal operation (when  no  ship is  un-
loading)," LNG would circulate through the piping along the pier to "keep the line cold."  6 id., at 3804.  Construction of

the  unloading  terminal  each  week.  7  Del.  App.  4303,  4307  (Affidavit  of

the Crown Landing project would require dredging 1.24 mil-lion  cubic  yards  of  subaqueous  soil,  affecting  approximately 

29  acres  of  the  riverbed  within  Delaware's  territory.  Re-port 19-20.

In September 2004, BP sought permission from Delaware's Department  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environmental  Con-

trol  (DNREC)  to  construct  the  Crown  Landing  unloading terminal.  See 

id.,  at  20.9  DNREC  refused  permission some  months  later  on  the  ground  that  the  terminal  was 

barred  by  Delaware's  Coastal  Zone  Act  (DCZA),  Del.  Code Ann.,  Tit.  7,  $ 7001  et  seq.  (2001),

10  as  a  prohibited  "offshore 

. . . bulk  product  transfer  facilit[y]"  as  well  as  a  prohibited "[h]eavy industry us[e]," $ 7003; Report 20.

11 

Reactions to DNREC's decision boiled over on both sides. New  Jersey  threatened  to  withdraw  state  pension  funds 

from  Delaware  banks,  and  Delaware  considered  authorizing the National Guard to protect its border from encroachment. 

8 The  dissent  points  to  other  projects  involving  extensive  dredging. 
Post, at 642.  The examples presented, however, involved large-scale pub-
lic works, not privately owned and operated facilities. 

9 Three months after seeking Delaware's permission, BP commenced the 

permitting  process  in  New  Jersey,  by  filing  a  Waterfront  Development 
Application with  New Jersey's  Department  of  Environmental Protection. 
Report 20. 

10 The  DCZA  is  designed  "to  control  the  location,  extent  and  type  of 

industrial development in Delaware's coastal areas . . . and [to] safeguard 
th[e] use [of those areas] primarily for recreation and tourism."  Del. Code 
Ann., Tit. 7, $ 7001 (2001). 

11 On  BP's  appeal,  Delaware's  Coastal  Zone  Industrial  Control  Board 

affirmed DNREC's  determination  that the Crown Landing  project  was a 
bulk product transfer facility prohibited by the DCZA.  BP did not appeal 
the decision, rendering it a final determination.  Report 20-21.  The dis-
sent  suspects  that  Delaware's  permit  denial  may  have  been  designed  to 
lure  BP  away  from  New  Jersey,  siting  the  plant,  instead,  on  Delaware's 
"own  shore."  Post, at  645.  Delaware  law,  however,  proscribes  "[h]eavy 
industry  us[e],"  Del.  Code  Ann.,  Tit.  7,  $ 7003,  in  any  area  within  "[t]he 
coastal zone" over which Delaware is sovereign, $ 7002(a).  Nothing what-
ever  in  the  record  before  us  warrants  the  suggestion  that  Delaware 
acted duplicitously.

New Jersey commenced the instant action in 2005, seeking a  declaration  that  Article  VII  of  the  1905  Compact  estab-

lishes its exclusive jurisdiction "to regulate the construction 
of  improvements  appurtenant  to  the  New  Jersey  shore  of the  Delaware  River  within  the  Twelve-Mile  Circle,  free  of 

regulation by Delaware."  Motion to Reopen and for Supple-mental  Decree  35;  see  Report  22,  29.  We  granted  leave  to 
file a bill of complaint.  546 U. S. 1028 (2005).  Delaware op-posed  New  Jersey's  reading  of  Article  VII,  and  maintained 
that  the  1905  Compact  did  not  give  New  Jersey  exclusive authority  to  "approve  projects  that  encroach  on  Delaware 
submerged  lands  without  any  say  by  Delaware."  Brief  for 
Delaware  in  Opposition  to  New  Jersey's  Motion  to  Reopen and for Supplemental Decree 21; see Report 23, 29. 

The  Special  Master  appointed  by  the  Court,  Ralph  I. Lancaster, Jr., 546 U. S. 1147 (2006), superintended discovery 
and carefully considered nearly 6,500 pages of materials pre-sented  by  the  parties  in  support  of  cross-motions  for  sum-
mary  judgment.  Report  27.  He  ultimately  determined that  the  "riparian  jurisdiction"  preserved  to  New  Jersey  by 
Article  VII  of  the  1905  Compact  "is  not  exclusive"  and  that Delaware  "has  overlapping  jurisdiction  to  regulate . . .  
improvements  outshore  of  the  low  water  mark  on  the  New 
Jersey  side of the  River."  Id.,  at 32.  New  Jersey filed ex-
ceptions to which we now turn.12 

12 New Jersey takes no exception to the Special Master's determinations 
that Delaware was not judicially estopped from challenging New Jersey's 
interpretation  of  Article  VII,  Report  86-92,  and  that  Delaware  has  not 
lost jurisdiction through prescription and acquiescence, id., at 92-99.  See

Opinion of the Court 

III 
At the outset, we summarize our decision and the principal 
reasons  for  it.  In  accord  with  the  Special  Master,  we  hold 
that  Article  VII  of  the  1905  Compact  does  not  grant  New 
Jersey exclusive jurisdiction over all riparian improvements 
extending outshore of the low-water mark.  First, the novel 
term  "riparian  jurisdiction,"  which  the  parties  employed  in 
the Compact, is properly read as a limiting modifier and not 
as  synonymous  with  "exclusive  jurisdiction."  Second,  an 
1834  compact  between  New  Jersey  and  New  York  casts  in-
formative  light  on  the  later  New  Jersey-Delaware  accord. 
Third,  our  decision  in  Virginia  v.  Maryland,  540  U. S.  56 
(2003),  provides  scant  support  for  New  Jersey's  claim.  We 
there  held  that  a  Maryland-Virginia  boundary  settlement 
gave  Virginia  "sovereign  authority,  free  from  regulation  by 
Maryland, to build improvements appurtenant to [Virginia's] 
shore  and  to  withdraw  water  from  the  [Potomac]  River." 
Id., at 75.  Delaware's 1905 agreement to New Jersey's exer-
cise of "riparian jurisdiction," made when the boundary was 
still disputed, cannot plausibly be read as an equivalent rec-
ognition of New Jersey's sovereign authority.  Finally, Dela-
ware's  claim  to  regulating  authority  is  supported  by  New 
Jersey's  acceptance  (until  the  present  controversy)  of  Dela-
ware's jurisdiction over  water and land within  its domain to 
preserve the quality and prevent deterioration of the State's 
coastal areas. 

A 

New Jersey hinges its case on Article VII of the 1905 Com-
pact,  which  it  reads  as  conferring  on  "each  State  complete 
regulatory  authority  over  the  construction  and  operation  of 
riparian  improvements  on  its  shores,  even  if  the  improve-
ments  extend  past  the  low-water  mark."  Exceptions  by 
New  Jersey  to  Report  of  Special  Master  and  Supporting

610  NEW  JERSEY  v.  DELAWARE 

Opinion of the Court 
v.  Delaware II, New Jersey recognizes, confirmed Delaware's sovereign ownership of the River and subaqueous soil within 

the  twelve-mile  circle.  But,  New  Jersey  emphasizes,  the Court  expressly  made  that  determination  "subject  to  the 
Compact of 1905."  291 U. S., at 385.  New Jersey acknowl-edges  that  Delaware  "unquestionably  can  exercise  its  police 
power  outshore  of  the  low-water  mark."  New  Jersey  Ex-ceptions 16.  New Jersey contends, however, that Delaware 
cannot  do  so  in  a  manner  that  would  interfere  with  the  au-thority  over  riparian  rights  that  Article  VII  of  the  1905 
Compact preserves for New Jersey.  Ibid. Because the meaning of the 1905 Compact and, in particu-
lar,  Article  VII,  is  key  to  the  resolution  of  this  controversy, we  focus  our  attention  on  that  issue.  Significantly,  Article 
VII  provides  that  "[e]ach  State  may,  on  its  own  side  of  the river,  continue  to  exercise"  not  "exclusive  jurisdiction"  or 
"jurisdiction" unmodified, but "riparian jurisdiction of every kind  and  nature."  34  Stat.  860.  New  Jersey  argues  that 
"riparian  jurisdiction"  should  be  read  broadly  to  encompass full  police-power  jurisdiction  over  activities  carried  out  on 
riparian structures.  New Jersey Exceptions 36-37.  If New Jersey enjoys full police power over  improvements ex-
tending from its shore, New Jersey reasons, then necessarily Delaware cannot encroach on that authority.  See Report 54.

We agree with the Special Master that " `riparian' is a lim-iting modifier. "  Report 57.  Interpreting an interstate 

compact, "[ j]ust as if [we] were addressing a federal statute," New  Jersey  v.  New  York,  523  U. S.  767,  811  (1998),  it  would 
be appropriate to construe a compact term in accord with its common-law  meaning,  see 

Morissette  v.  United  States,  342 
U. S. 246, 263 (1952).  The term "riparian jurisdiction," how-ever,  was  not  a  legal  term  of  art  in  1905,  nor  is  it  one  now.

Opinion of the Court 
seph  L.  Sax  (Nov.  7,  2006)).  As  the  Special  Master  stated, "riparian  jurisdiction"  appears  to  be  a  verbal  formulation 

"devised by the [1905 Compact] drafters specifically for Arti-cle VII."  Report 54.

13 

Elsewhere  in  the  Compact,  one  finds  the  more  familiar terms  "jurisdiction"  (in  the  introductory  paragraphs  and, 

most  notably,  in  Article  VIII)  or  "exclusive  jurisdiction"  (in Article  IV).

14  To  attribute  to  "riparian  jurisdiction"  the 

same meaning  as "jurisdiction"  unmodified,  or to equate the novel  term  with  the  distinct  formulation  "exclusive  juris-

diction,"  would  deny  operative  effect  to  each  word  in  the Compact,  contrary  to  basic  principles  of  construction.  See 
United States v.  Menasche, 348 U. S. 528, 538-539 (1955). In this regard, Article VIII bears reiteration: 

"Nothing  herein  contained  shall  affect  the  territorial limits,  rights,  or  jurisdiction  of  either  State  of,  in,  or 
over  the  Delaware  River,  or  the  ownership  of  the  sub-aqueous  soil  thereof,  except  as  herein  expressly  set 
forth."  34 Stat. 860. 
Presumably  drafted  in  recognition  of  the  still-unresolved boundary  dispute,  see  supra,  at  603-606,  Article  VIII  re-

quires an express statement in the Compact  in order to "af-fect  the  territorial . . . jurisdiction  of  either  State . . .  over 
the  Delaware  River."  We  resist  reading  the  uncommon term  "riparian  jurisdiction,"  even  when  aggrandized  by  the 

13 The term appears in no other interstate compact.  New Jersey's codi-
fication  of  the  1905  Compact,  N.  J.  Stat.  Ann.  $ 52:28-41  (West  2001),  in-
cludes the term, but our attention has been called to no other state statute 
that does so. 

14 The  last  paragraph  of  Article  IV  reads:  "Each  State  shall  have  and 

exercise exclusive jurisdiction within said river to arrest, try, and punish 
its  own  inhabitants  for  violation  of  the  concurrent  legislation  related  to 
fishery herein provided for."  34 Stat. 860 (emphasis added).  See also id.,

phrase  "of  every  kind  and  nature,"  as  tantamount  to  an  ex-press  cession  by  Delaware  of  its  entire  "territorial  .  .  . 

jurisdiction . . . over the Delaware River."

Endeavoring  to  fathom  the  import  of  the  novel  term  "ri-parian jurisdiction," the Special Master recognized that a ri-

parian landowner ordinarily enjoys the right to build a wharf to access  navigable waters  far  enough  to permit  the  loading 
and  unloading  of  ships.  Report  47-49,  58-59.  Accord  1 H.  Farnham,  Law  of  Waters  and  Water  Rights  $ 62,  p.  279 
(1904)  ("The  riparian  owner  is  also  entitled  to  have  his  con-tact with the water remain intact.  This is what is known as 
the  right  of  access,  and  includes  the  right  to  erect  wharves to  reach  the  navigable  portion  of  the  stream.");  id.,  $ 111, 
p.  520  ("A  wharf  is  a  structure  on  the  margin  of  navigable water, alongside of which vessels are brought for the sake of 
being  conveniently  loaded  or  unloaded.").  But  the  Special Master also recognized that the right of a riparian owner to 
wharf  out  is  subject  to  state  regulation.  Report  58;  see  1 Farnham,  supra,  $ 63,  p.  284  (rights  of  riparian  owner  "are 
always  subordinate  to  the  public  rights,  and  the  state  may regulate their exercise in the interest of the public"); 

Shively v.  Bowlby, 152 U. S. 1, 40 (1894) ("[A] riparian proprietor . . . 

has the right of access to the navigable part of the stream in front of his land, and to construct a wharf or pier projecting 
into the stream . . . , subject to such general rules and regula-tions  as  the  legislature  may  prescribe  for  the  protection  of 
the public . . . ." (internal quotation marks omitted)). New Jersey took no issue with the Special Master's recog-
nition  that  States,  in  the  public  interest,  may  place  restric-tions on a riparian proprietor's activities.  In its response to 
Delaware's  request  for  admissions,  New  Jersey  readily  ac-knowledged  that  a  person  wishing  to  conduct  a  particular 
activity on a wharf, in addition to obtaining a riparian grant, would have to comply with all other "applicable New Jersey

laws, and local laws."  6 Del. App. 4147, 4156 (New Jersey's Responses  to  Delaware's  First  Request  for  Admissions  || 22 

(Sept.  8,  2006)).  See  also  Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts $ 856, Comment 

e, pp. 246-247 (1977) ("[A] state may exercise 
its  police  power  by  controlling  the  initiation  and  conduct  of riparian  and  nonriparian  uses  of  water.").  But  New  Jersey 

sees itself, to the exclusion of Delaware, as the State empow-
ered  to  regulate,  for  the  benefit  of  the  public,  New  Jersey landowners' exercise of riparian rights. 

In the ordinary case, the State that grants riparian rights is also the State that has regulatory authority over the exer-
cise of those rights.  But cf. Cummings v.  Chicago, 188 U. S. 
410, 431 (1903) (federal regulation of wharfing out in the Cal-
umet  River  did  not  divest  local  government  of  regulatory 
authority  based  on  location  of  project  within  that  govern-
ment's territory).  In this regard, the negotiators of the 1905 
Compact faced an unusual situation: As long as the boundary 
issue  remained  unsettled,  they  could  not  know  which  State 
was sovereign within the twelve-mile circle beyond New Jer-
sey's shore.  They  likely knew,  however, that  "[i]n a  case of 
wharfing out . . . `[t]he  rights  of  a  riparian  owner  upon  a 
navigable stream in this country are governed by the law of 
the  State  in  which  the  stream  is  situated.' "  1  S.  Wiel, 
Water Rights in the Western States $ 898, p. 934 (3d ed. 1911) 
(quoting  Weems  Steamboat  Co.  of  Baltimore  v.  People's 
Steamboat Co.,  214 U. S. 345, 355 (1909)).  With the  issue of 
sovereignty  reserved  by  the  1905  Compact  drafters  for  an-
other  day, the  Special  Master's  conclusion that  Article  VII's 
reference  to  "riparian  jurisdiction"  did  not  mean  "exclusive 
jurisdiction" is difficult to gainsay. 

The Special Master pertinently observed that, as New Jer-
sey  read  the  1905  Compact,  Delaware  had  given  up  all  gov-
erning  authority  over  the  disputed  area  while  receiving 
nothing in return.  He found New Jersey's position "implau-
sible."  Report  63.  "Delaware,"  the  Special  Master  stated, 
"would not have willingly ceded all jurisdiction over matters

Id., at 64.15 
New Jersey asserts that Delaware did just that, as shown by  representations  made  during  proceedings  in 

New  Jersey 
v.  Delaware  II.  New  Jersey  Exceptions  44.  Delaware's 
reply brief before the Special Master in that case stated: "Ar-
ticle VII of the Compact is obviously merely a recognition of 
the rights of the riparian owners of New Jersey and a cession 
to the State of New Jersey by the State of Delaware of juris-
diction  to  regulate  those  rights."  1  App.  of  New  Jersey  on 
Motion for Summary Judgment 123a.  Further, at oral argu-
ment  before  the  Special  Master  in  that  earlier  fray,  Dela-
ware's  counsel  said  that,  in  his  view,  the  1905  Compact 
"ceded to the State of New Jersey all the right to control the 
erection of [wharves extending into the Delaware River from 
New  Jersey's  shore]  and  to  say  who  shall  erect  them."  Id., 
at 126a-1. 

The Special Master in the instant case found New Jersey's 
position  dubious,  as  do  we.  The  representations  Delaware 
made in the course of New Jersey v.  Delaware II, the Special 
Master here observed, were "fully consistent with [the Mas-
ter's]  interpretation  of  Article  VII  [of  the  1905  Compact]." 
Report  89.  New  Jersey  did  indeed  preserve  "the  right  to 

15 The dissent insists that Delaware received "plenty in return."  Post, 
at  630.  But,  in  truth,  the  1905  Compact  gave  neither  State  "plenty." 
Each  State  accommodated  to  the  other  to  assure  equal  access  to  fishing 
rights  in  the  River.  See  supra,  at  604,  n.  5.  Delaware  agreed  to  the 
Compact  "not  [as] a  settlement  of the disputed  boundary, but [as] a  truce 
or  modus  vivendi."  1  Del.  App.  190.  In  deciding  whether  to  proceed 
with  the  litigation,  Delaware's  Attorney  General  advised  that  the  suit 
"would  entail  very  considerable  expense."  2  id.,  at  1069,  1075  (Letter 
from  Herbert  Ward  to  Gov.  John  Hunn  (Jan.  31,  1903)).  He  noted,  how-
ever,  that  the  process  of  preparing  Delaware's  Answer  had  "greatly 
strengthened the belief and reliance of counsel . . . upon the justice of her 
claim."  Id.,  at  1076.  The  decision  in  New  Jersey v.  Delaware  II  con-
firmed Delaware's conviction.  See supra, at 605, n. 6.

Opinion of the Court 
exercise its own jurisdiction over riparian improvements ap-purtenant to its shore."  Ibid.  But, critically, Delaware no-

where "suggested that New Jersey would have the exclusive authority  to  regulate  all  aspects  of  riparian  improvements, 
even if on Delaware's land."  Ibid. Delaware,  in  its  argument  before  the  Special  Master,  was 
equally  uncompromising.  As  a  result  of  the  1934  boundary determination, Delaware urged, "the entire River is on Dela-
ware's  `own  side,'  and  New  Jersey  consequently  ha[d]  no `side'  of  the  River  on  which  to  exercise  any  riparian  rights 
or riparian jurisdiction."  Id., at 36.  Article VII of the 1905 Compact,  according  to  Delaware,  was  a  "temporary"  meas-
ure, "entirely . . . contingent on the ultimate resolution of the boundary." 

Id.,  at  39.  That  reading,  the  Special  Master demonstrated, was altogether fallacious. 

Id., at 36-40. Seeking  to  harmonize  Article  VII  with  the  boundary  de-

termination,  the  Special  Master  reached  these  conclusions. First,  the  1905  Compact  gave  New  Jersey  no  authority  to 
grant lands owned by Delaware.  Id., at 45-46.  Second, Ar-ticle  VII's  preservation  to  each  State  of  "riparian  jurisdic-
tion" means that New Jersey may control the riparian rights ordinarily  and  usually  enjoyed  by  landowners  on  New  Jer-
sey's shore.  For example, New  Jersey  may define  "how  far a riparian  owner can wharf out, the quantities of water that 
a  riparian  owner  can  draw  from  the  River,  and  the  like." 
Id.,  at  57-58.  Nevertheless,  New  Jersey's  regulatory  au-thority  is  qualified  once  the  boundary  line  at  low  water 

is  passed.  Id.,  at  58.  Just  as  New  Jersey  cannot  grant land  belonging  to  Delaware,  so  New  Jersey  cannot  author-
ize  activities  that  go  beyond  the  exercise  of  ordinary  and usual  riparian  rights  in  the  face  of  contrary  regulation  by 
Delaware.  B

ing  and  to  choose  apt  words  in  which  to  embody  the  pur-
poses of the high contracting parties."  Rocca v.  Thompson, 
223  U. S.  317,  332  (1912).  Accordingly,  the  Special  Master 
found informative a comparison of language in the 1905 Com-
pact  with  language  contained  in  an  1834  compact  between 
New Jersey and New York.  See Report 65.  That compact 
established the two States' common boundary along the Hud-
son River.  Act of June 28, 1834, ch. 126, 4 Stat. 708.  Simi-
lar  to  the  boundary  between  New  Jersey and  Delaware  set-
tled  in  1934  in  New  Jersey  v.  Delaware  II,  the  1834  accord 
located  the  New  Jersey-New  York  boundary  at  "the  low 
water-mark on the westerly or New Jersey side [of the Hud-
son River]."  Art. Third, 4 Stat. 710; cf. supra, at 602.  The 
1834  agreement,  however,  expressly  gave  to  New  Jersey 
"the  exclusive  right  of  property  in  and  to  the  land  under 
water  lying  west  of the  middle  of the  bay of New  York,  and 
west  of  the  middle  of  that  part  of  the  Hudson  river  which 
lies  between  Manhattan  island  and  New  Jersey"  and  "the 
exclusive  jurisdiction  of  and  over  the  wharves,  docks,  and 
improvements, made and to be made on the shore of the said 
state . . . ."  Art. Third, |||| 1, 2, 4 Stat. 710 (emphasis added). 

"Comparable  language  [conferring  exclusive  authority]," 
the  Special  Master  observed,  "is  noticeably  absent  in  the 
[1905]  Compact."  Report  66.  The  Master  found  this  dis-
parity  "conspicuous,"  id.,  at  68,  for  "[s]everal  provisions  in 
the  two  interstate  compacts  [contain]  strikingly  similar  lan-
guage,"  id.,  at  66;  see  id.,  App.  J  (Table  Comparing  Similar 
Provisions  in  the  New  Jersey-New  York  Compact  of  1834 
and the New Jersey-Delaware Compact of 1905).  Given that 
provisions of the 1905 Compact appear to have been adopted 
almost  verbatim  from  New  Jersey's  1834  accord  with  New 
York, see ibid., New Jersey could hardly claim ignorance that 
Article  VII  could  have  been  drafted  to  grant  New  Jersey 
"exclusive  jurisdiction"  (not  merely  "riparian  jurisdiction")

New  Jersey  urged  before  the  Special  Master,  and  in  its exceptions  to  his  report,  that 

Virginia  v.  Maryland,  540 U. S.  56,  is  dispositive  of  this  case.

17  Both  cases  involved 

an interstate  compact,  which  left  the  boundary between  the contending States unresolved, and a later determination set-

tling the boundary.  And both original actions were referred to  Ralph  I.  Lancaster,  Jr.,  as  Special  Master.  We  find  per-
suasive the  Special Master's  reconciliation of his recommen-dations in the two actions.  See Report 64-65, n. 118. 

Virginia v.  Maryland involved a 1785 compact and an 1877 arbitration  award.  Agreeing  with  the  Special  Master,  we 
held  that  the  arbitration  award  permitted  Virginia  to  con-struct  a  water  intake  structure  extending  into  the  Potomac 
River,  even  though  the  award  placed  Virginia's  boundary  at the low-water mark on its own side of the Potomac.  See 540 
U. S.,  at  75.  "Superficially,"  the  Special  Master  said,  "that holding  would  appear  to  support  New  Jersey's  argument 
here,  i. e.,  that  construction  of  wharves  off  New  Jersey's shore  should  not  be  subject  to  regulation  by  Delaware." 
Report  64,  n.  118.  But,  the  Special  Master  explained,  the result  in 

Virginia  v.  Maryland  turned  on  "the  unique  lan-guage of the compact and arbitration award involved in that 

case."  Report 64, n. 118. 

16 The  1834  accord  was  the  subject  of  significant  litigation  in  the  years 
leading up to and surrounding the adoption of the 1905 Compact.  Report 
67.  Notably,  New  York's  highest  court  concluded  Article  Third  of  the 
1834 interstate agreement meant what it said: New Jersey had "exclusive" 
jurisdiction over wharves extending from and beyond its shore; therefore 
New York lacked authority to declare those wharves to be nuisances.  See 
New York  v.  Central R. Co.  of  N.  J.,  42 N. Y. 283, 293 (1870); Report 67. 

17 The  dissent,  post,  at  638-640,  essentially  repeats  New  Jersey's 

argument.

618  NEW  JERSEY  v.  DELAWARE 

Opinion of the Court 
The key provision of the  1785  compact between  Maryland and Virginia, we observed, addressed only "the right [of the 

citizens  of  each  State]  to  build  wharves  and  improvements regardless  of  which  State  ultimately  was  determined  to  be 
sovereign  over  the  River."  540  U. S.,  at  69.  Concerning the  rights  of the  States,  the  1877  arbitration award,  not  the 
1785  compact,  was  definitive.  See  id.,  at  75.  The  key  pro-vision  of  that  award  recognized  the  right  of  Virginia,  "

qua sovereign,"  "to  use  the  River  beyond  low-water  mark,"  a 

right  "nowhere  made  subject  to  Maryland's  regulatory  au-thority."  Id., at 72. 

Confirming  the  "sovereign  character"  of  Virginia's  right, we noted, Maryland had proposed to the arbitrators that the 
boundary  line  between  the  States  be  drawn  around  "all wharves  and  other  improvements  now  extending  or  which 
may hereafter be extended, by authority of Virginia from the Virginia  shore  into  the  [Potomac]  beyond  low  water  mark." 
Id., at 72, n. 7 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Although the formulation Maryland proposed was not used in the arbi-
tration award, the arbitrators plainly manifested their inten-tion to accomplish the same end: to safeguard "Virginia's au-
thority  to  construct  riparian  improvements  outshore  of  the low  water  mark  without  regulation  by  Maryland."  Report 
65,  n.  118;  see  Virginia  v.  Maryland,  540  U. S.,  at  73,  n.  7. By  contrast,  in  the  instant  case,  neither  the  1905  Compact, 
nor New Jersey v.  Delaware II, the 1934 decision settling the boundary dispute, purported to give New Jersey "all regula-
tory oversight  (as opposed to merely riparian oversight)" or to  endow  New  Jersey  with  authority  "exclusive  of  jurisdic-
tion by Delaware."  Report 65, n. 118; see supra, at 610-615. 

D 
We turn, finally, to the parties' prior course of conduct, on which  the  Special  Master  placed  considerable  weight.  See 

Report 68-84; cf. O'Connor v.  United States, 479 U. S. 27, 33

Opinion of the Court 
(1986) ("The  course  of  conduct  of  parties to  an international agreement,  like  the  course  of  conduct  of  parties  to  any  con-

tract, is evidence of its meaning."). Until  the  1960's,  wharfing  out  from  the  New  Jersey  shore 
into Delaware territory was not a matter of controversy be-tween the two States.  From 1851, when New Jersey began 
issuing  grants  for  such  activity,  through  1969,  only  11  con-structions  straddled  the  interstate  boundary.  Report  74. 
At  the  time  of  the  1905  Compact  and  continuing  into  the 1950's,  Delaware,  unlike  New  Jersey,  issued  no  grants  or 
leases  for  its  subaqueous  lands.  Delaware  regulated  ripar-ian improvements solely under its common law, which limited 
developments only to the extent they constituted public nui-sances. 

Id., at 69. In 1961, Delaware enacted its first statute regulating sub-

merged lands, and in 1966, it enacted broader legislation gov-erning  leases  of  state-owned  subaqueous  lands.  Id.,  at  70. 
The  State  grandfathered  piers  and  wharves  built  prior  to the  effective  date  of  the  regulations  implementing  the  1966 
statute.  Id.,  at  70-71.  Permits  were  required,  however, 
for  modifications  to  the  grandfathered  structures  and  for new structures.

which  required  States  to  submit  their  coastal  manage-
ment  programs  to  the  Secretary  of  Commerce  for  review 
and  approval.  In  return,  States  with  approved  programs 
would receive federal funding for coastal management.  See 

$$ 1454-1455.  Delaware's coastal management program, ap-
proved by the Secretary in 1979, specifically addressed LNG 
facilities and reported that " `no site in Delaware [is] suitable 
for  the  location  of  any  LNG  import-export  facility.' "  Re-

tional  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Admin.  (NOAA),  Delaware 
Coastal Management Program and Final Environmental Im-
pact Statement  57  (Mar. 1980))).  The next  year, 1980, New 
Jersey gained approval for its coastal management program. 
The Special Master found telling, as do we, a representation 
New Jersey made in its submission to the Secretary: 

"The  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  Coastal  Management 
agencies . . . have concluded that any New Jersey project 
extending  beyond  mean  low  water  must  obtain  coastal 
permits  from  both  states.  New  Jersey  and  Delaware, 
therefore, will coordinate reviews of any proposed devel-

(Mar. 2, 1972)).

opment  that  would  span  the  interstate  boundary  to  en-sure that no development is constructed unless it would 

be  consistent  with  both  state  coastal  management  pro-grams."  Report  81  (quoting  4  Del.  App.  2657  (NOAA, 
N.  J.  Coastal  Management  Program  and  Final  Environ-mental  Impact  Statement  20  (Aug.  1980));  emphasis 
added). 
See  also  Report  72-73.  That  representation,  the  Special Master observed, "is fundamentally inconsistent with the po-

sition advanced by New Jersey here, i. e., that only New Jer-sey has the right to regulate such projects." 

Id., at 73. As  the  Special  Master  reported,  just  three  structures  ex-

tending from New Jersey into Delaware were built between 1969 and 2006.  Delaware's DNREC issued permits for each 
of  them.  Id.,  at  74-76.  One  of  those  projects  was  under-taken  by  New  Jersey  itself.  The  State,  in  1996,  sought  to 
refurbish a stone pier at New Jersey's Fort Mott State Park. 
Id., at 75-76.  New Jersey issued a waterfront development permit  for  the  project,  but  that  permit  approved  structures 

only  to  the  low-water  mark.  Delaware's  approval  was sought  and  obtained  for  structures  outshore  of  that  point. 
Even during the pendency of this action, New Jersey applied to  Delaware  for  renewal  of  the  permit  covering  the  portion 
of  the  Fort  Mott  project  extending  into  Delaware.  Ibid.20 

20 New Jersey asserts "the most striking thing about this [course of con-
duct] evidence  is the lack of  any reference  by . . . New  Jersey  officials to 
the  [1905]  Compact  itself,  much  less  to  the  terms  of  Article  VII."  New 
Jersey  Exceptions  48.  "All  citizens,"  however,  "are  presumptively 
charged with knowledge of the law."  Atkins v.  Parker, 472 U. S. 115, 130 
(1985).  The  1905  Compact  is  codified  at  N.  J.  Stat.  Ann.  $$ 52:28-34  to 
52:28-45.  We find unconvincing New Jersey's contention that its officials 
were ignorant of the State's own statutes.  The assertion is all the more 
implausible  given  New  Jersey's  recognition  of  Delaware's  regulatory  au-
thority  in  New  Jersey's  coastal  management  plan,  despite  a  New  Jersey 
county planning board's objection to that acknowledgment.  Report 82; 4

Environmental Impact Statement 499 (Aug. 1980)).

622  NEW  JERSEY  v.  DELAWARE 

Opinion of the Court 

IV 
New  Jersey  v.  Delaware  II  upheld  Delaware's  ownership of the River and subaqueous soil within the twelve-mile cir-

cle.  The 1905 Compact did not ordain that this Court's 1934 settlement  of  the  boundary  would  be  an  academic  exercise 
with  slim  practical  significance.  Tending  against  a  reading that would give New Jersey exclusive authority, Article VIII 
of  the  Compact,  as  earlier  emphasized,  see  supra,  at  611, states:  "Nothing herein  contained  shall  affect  the  territorial 
limits,  rights  or  jurisdiction  of  either  State  of,  in  or  over the Delaware River, or the ownership of the subaqueous soil 
thereof,  except  as  herein  expressly  set  forth."  Nowhere does Article VII "expressly set forth" Delaware's lack of any 
governing  authority  over  territory  within  the  State's  own borders.  Cf. Report 43-46. 

The  Special  Master  correctly  determined  that  Delaware's once  "hands  off "  policy  regarding  coastal  development  did 
not  signal  that  the  State  never  could  or  never  would  assert any  regulatory  authority  over  structures  using  its  subaque-
ous  land.  Id.,  at  69-70.  In  the  decades  since  Delaware began to manage its waters and submerged lands to prevent 
"a  significant  danger  of  pollution  to  the  coastal  zone,"  Del. Code Ann., Tit. 7, $ 7001, the State has followed a consistent 
course:  Largely  with  New  Jersey's  cooperation,  Delaware has  checked  proposed  structures  and  activity  extending  be-
yond New Jersey's shore into Delaware's domain in order to "protect  the  natural environment  of [Delaware's] . . . coastal 
areas."  Ibid.  * * * 

Given  the  authority  over  riparian  rights  that  the  1905 Compact  preserves  for  New  Jersey,  Delaware  may  not  im-
pede  ordinary  and  usual  exercises  of  the  right  of  riparian owners  to  wharf  out  from  New  Jersey's  shore.  The  Crown 
Landing  project, however, goes  well beyond  the ordinary  or usual.  See  supra,  at  606-607.  Delaware's  classification  of 
the proposed LNG unloading terminal as a "[h]eavy industry

Decree 
use" and a "bulk product transfer facilit[y]," Del. Code Ann., Tit. 7, $$ 7001, 7003, has not been, and hardly could be, chal-

lenged  as  inaccurate.21  Consistent  with  the  scope  of  its  re-tained police power  to regulate  certain riparian  uses, it  was 
within  Delaware's  authority  to  prohibit  construction  of  the facility within its domain.

22  As recommended by the Special 

Master, we confirm Delaware's authority to deny permission for  the  Crown  Landing  terminal,  overrule  New  Jersey's  ex-

ceptions,  and  enter,  with  modifications  consistent  with  this opinion, the decree proposed by the Special Master. 

It is so ordered.

As  the  majority opinion  filed by  Judge Traxler  and  the  dissent-ing  opinion  filed  by  Judge  Gregory  demonstrate,  reasonable 
judges  can  and  do  disagree  about  the  merits  of  petitioner's  chal-lenge  to  the  adequacy  of  his  counsel's  representation  at  the  pen-
alty phase of his trial.  See 474 F. 3d 154 (CA4 2007).  Moreover, those  opinions  also  make  it  clear  that  a  thorough  examination  of 
the trial record, as well as the evidence that he claims his lawyers should  have  discovered,  is  essential  for  a  correct  appraisal  of  the 
merits.  Having  conducted  that  review,  I  do  not  dissent  from  the Court's  decision  to  deny  certiorari.  I  do,  however,  remain  firmly 
convinced  that  no  State  should  be  allowed  to  foreshorten  this Court's orderly review of federal constitutional claims of first-time 
habeas  petitioners  by  executing  prisoners  before  that  review  can be  completed. 

Both  the  interest  in  avoiding  irreversible  error  in  capital cases, and  the interest  in  the  efficient management  of  our  docket,  would 
be served by a routine practice of staying all executions scheduled in  advance  of  the  completion  of  our  review  of  the  denial  of  a 
capital  defendant's  first  application  for  a  federal  writ  of  habeas corpus.  Such  a  practice  would  be  faithful  to  the  distinction  be-
tween  first  and  successive  habeas  petitions  recognized  by  Con-gress  in  the  Antiterrorism  and  Effective  Death  Penalty  Act  of 
1996  and  would  accord  death  row  inmates  the  same,  rather  than lesser,  procedural  safeguards  as  ordinary  litigants.  It  is  a  prac-
tice  that  Justice

and unusual punishments forbids his execution more than 30 years after  he  was  initially  convicted. 

In  my  view,  Smith  can  reasonably  claim  that  his  execution  at this late date  would be  "unusual."  I am  unaware of  other execu-
tions  that  have  taken  place  after  so  long  a  delay,  particularly when  much  of  the  delay  at  issue  seems  due  to  constitutionally 
defective  sentencing  proceedings.  And  whether  it  is  "cruel"  to keep  an  individual  for  decades  on  death  row  or  otherwise  under 
threat  of  imminent  execution  raises  a  serious  constitutional  ques-tion.  I  have elsewhere  explained  (in  cases involving  less  lengthy 
delays)  why  I  believe  that  is  so.  See  Foster  v.  Florida,  537  U. S. 990,  991-993  (2002)  (opinion  dissenting  from  denial  of  certiorari); 
Knight  v.  Florida,  528  U.  S.  990,  993-999  (1999)  (same);  Elledge v.  Florida,  525  U.  S.  944  (1998)  (same);  see  also  Lackey  v.  Texas,
