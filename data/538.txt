CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 2002

CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY

et al. v. DOE, individually and on behalf of all

others similarly situated

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 01-1231. Argued November 13, 2002--Decided March 5, 2003
Among other things, Connecticut's "Megan's Law" requires persons convicted of sexual offenses to register with the Department of Public
Safety (DPS) upon their release into the community, and requires DPS
to post a sex offender registry containing registrants' names, addresses,
photographs, and descriptions on an Internet Website and to make the
registry available to the public in certain state offices. Respondent
Doe (hereinafter respondent), a convicted sex offender who is subject
to the law, filed a 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 action on behalf of himself and similarly situated sex offenders, claiming that the law violates, inter alia,
the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The District Court
granted respondent summary judgment, certified a class of individuals
subject to the law, and permanently enjoined the law's public disclosure
provisions. The Second Circuit affirmed, concluding that such disclosure both deprived registered sex offenders of a "liberty interest," and
violated the Due Process Clause because officials did not afford registrants a predeprivation hearing to determine whether they are likely to
be "currently dangerous."

Held: The Second Circuit's judgment must be reversed because due process does not require the opportunity to prove a fact that is not material
to the State's statutory scheme. Mere injury to reputation, even if de1

Syllabus
famatory, does not constitute the deprivation of a liberty interest. Paul
v. Davis, 424 U. S. 693. But even assuming, arguendo, that respondent
has been deprived of a liberty interest, due process does not entitle him
to a hearing to establish a fact--that he is not currently dangerous--
that is not material under the statute. Cf., e. g., Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U. S. 433. As the DPS Website explains, the law's requirements turn on an offender's conviction alone--a fact that a convicted
offender has already had a procedurally safeguarded opportunity to contest. Unless respondent can show that the substantive rule of law is
defective (by conflicting with the Constitution), any hearing on current
dangerousness is a bootless exercise. Respondent expressly disavows
any reliance on the substantive component of the Fourteenth Amendment's protections, and maintains that his challenge is strictly a procedural one. But States are not barred by principles of "procedural due
process" from drawing such classifications. Michael H. v. Gerald D.,
491 U. S. 110, 120 (plurality opinion). Such claims "must ultimately be
analyzed" in terms of substantive due process. Id., at 121. Because
the question is not properly before the Court, it expresses no opinion as
to whether the State's law violates substantive due process principles.

4 CONNECTICUT DEPT. OF PUBLIC SAFETY v. DOE

Opinion of the Court
joined the public disclosure of Connecticut's sex offender registry. The Court of Appeals concluded that such disclosure
both deprived registered sex offenders of a "liberty interest," and violated the Due Process Clause because officials
did not afford registrants a predeprivation hearing to determine whether they are likely to be "currently dangerous."
Doe v. Department of Public Safety ex rel. Lee, 271 F. 3d 38,
44, 46 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). Connecticut, however, has decided that the registry requirement shall
be based on the fact of previous conviction, not the fact of
current dangerousness. Indeed, the public registry explicitly states that officials have not determined that any registrant is currently dangerous. We therefore reverse the
judgment of the Court of Appeals because due process does
not require the opportunity to prove a fact that is not material to the State's statutory scheme.

"Sex offenders are a serious threat in this Nation." McKune v. Lile, 536 U. S. 24, 32 (2002) (plurality opinion).
"[T]he victims of sex assault are most often juveniles," and
"[w]hen convicted sex offenders reenter society, they are
much more likely than any other type of offender to be rearrested for a new rape or sexual assault." Id., at 32-33.
Connecticut, like every other State, has responded to these
facts by enacting a statute designed to protect its communities from sex offenders and to help apprehend repeat sex
offenders. Connecticut's "Megan's Law" applies to all persons convicted of criminal offenses against a minor, violent
and nonviolent sexual offenses, and felonies committed for a
sexual purpose. Covered offenders must register with the
Connecticut Department of Public Safety (DPS) upon their
release into the community. Each must provide personal information (including his name, address, photograph, and
DNA sample); notify DPS of any change in residence; and
periodically submit an updated photograph. The registration requirement runs for 10 years in most cases; those con538US1 Unit: $U27 [10-26-04 13:20:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
victed of sexually violent offenses must register for life.Conn. Gen. Stat. $$ 54-251, 54-252, 54-254 (2001).

The statute requires DPS to compile the information gath-ered from registrants and publicize it. In particular, the law
requires DPS to post a sex offender registry on an InternetWebsite and to make the registry available to the public
in certain state offices. $$ 54-257, 54-258. Whether made
available in an office or via the Internet, the registry mustbe accompanied by the following warning: " `Any person who

uses information in this registry to injure, harass or commita criminal act against any person included in the registry
or any other person is subject to criminal prosecution.' "$ 54-258a.

Before the District Court enjoined its operation, theState's Website enabled citizens to obtain the name, address,
photograph, and description of any registered sex offenderby entering a zip code or town name. The following disclaimer appeared on the first page of the Website:

" `The registry is based on the legislature's decision to
facilitate access to publicly-available information aboutpersons convicted of sexual offenses. [DPS] has not

considered or assessed the specific risk of reoffense withregard to any individual prior to his or her inclusion
within this registry, and has made no determination that
any individual included in the registry is currently dan-gerous. Individuals included within the registry are included solely by virtue of their conviction record andstate law. The main purpose of providing this data on
the Internet is to make the information more easily
available and accessible, not to warn about any specific
individual.' " 271 F. 3d, at 44.

Petitioners include the state agencies and officials charged
with compiling the sex offender registry and posting it on
the Internet. Respondent Doe (hereinafter respondent) is
a convicted sex offender who is subject to Connecticut's Meg538US1 Unit: $U27 [10-26-04 13:20:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
an's Law. He filed this action pursuant to Rev. Stat. $ 1979,42 U. S. C. $ 1983, on behalf of himself and similarly situated

sex offenders, claiming that the law violates, inter alia, theDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Specifically, respondent alleged that he is not a " `dangerous sex-ual offender,' " and that the Connecticut law "deprives him
of a liberty interest--his reputation combined with the alteration of his status under state law--without notice or ameaningful opportunity to be heard." 271 F. 3d, at 45-46.

The District Court granted summary judgment for respond-ent on his due process claim. 132 F. Supp. 2d 57 (Conn.
2001). The court then certified a class of individuals subject
to the Connecticut law, and permanently enjoined the law's
public disclosure provisions.

The Court of Appeals affirmed, 271 F. 3d 38 (CA2 2001),
holding that the Due Process Clause entitles class members
to a hearing "to determine whether or not they are particularly likely to be currently dangerous before being labeled as
such by their inclusion in a publicly disseminated registry."
Id., at 62. Because Connecticut had not provided such a
hearing, the Court of Appeals enjoined petitioners from
" `disclosing or disseminating to the public, either in printed
or electronic form (a) the Registry or (b) Registry information concerning [class members]' " and from " `identifying
[them] as being included in the Registry.' " Ibid. The
Court of Appeals reasoned that the Connecticut law implicated a "liberty interest" because of: (1) the law's stigmatization of respondent by "implying" that he is "currently dangerous," and (2) its imposition of "extensive and onerous"
registration obligations on respondent. Id., at 57. From
this liberty interest arose an obligation, in the Court of Appeals' view, to give respondent an opportunity to demonstrate that he was not "likely to be currently dangerous."
Id., at 62. We granted certiorari, 535 U. S. 1077 (2002).

In Paul v. Davis, 424 U. S. 693 (1976), we held that mere
injury to reputation, even if defamatory, does not constitute

Opinion of the Court
the deprivation of a liberty interest. Petitioners urge us toreverse the Court of Appeals on the ground that, under

Paul
v. Davis, respondent has failed to establish that petitionershave deprived him of a liberty interest. We find it unnecessary to reach this question, however, because even assuming,
arguendo, that respondent has been deprived of a liberty
interest, due process does not entitle him to a hearing to
establish a fact that is not material under the Connecticutstatute.

In cases such as Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U. S. 433(1971), and

Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565 (1975), we held that
due process required the government to accord the plaintiff
a hearing to prove or disprove a particular fact or set of
facts. But in each of these cases, the fact in question was
concededly relevant to the inquiry at hand. Here, however,
the fact that respondent seeks to prove--that he is not currently dangerous--is of no consequence under Connecticut's
Megan's Law. As the DPS Website explains, the law's requirements turn on an offender's conviction alone--a fact
that a convicted offender has already had a procedurally
safeguarded opportunity to contest. 271 F. 3d, at 44 (" `Individuals included within the registry are included solely by
virtue of their conviction record and state law' " (emphasis
added)). No other fact is relevant to the disclosure of registrants' information. Conn. Gen. Stat. $$ 54-257, 54-258
(2001). Indeed, the disclaimer on the Website explicitly
states that respondent's alleged nondangerousness simply
does not matter. 271 F. 3d, at 44 (" `[DPS] has made no determination that any individual included in the registry is
currently dangerous' ").

In short, even if respondent could prove that he is not
likely to be currently dangerous, Connecticut has decided
that the registry information of all sex offenders--currently
dangerous or not--must be publicly disclosed. Unless respondent can show that that substantive rule of law is defective (by conflicting with a provision of the Constitution), any

hearing on current dangerousness is a bootless exercise. Itmay be that respondent's claim is actually a substantive challenge to Connecticut's statute "recast in `procedural dueprocess' terms."

Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 308 (1993).
Nonetheless, respondent expressly disavows any reliance onthe substantive component of the Fourteenth Amendment's

protections, Brief for Respondents 44-45, and maintains, as
he did below, that his challenge is strictly a procedural one.But States are not barred by principles of "

procedural due
process" from drawing such classifications. Michael H. v.
Gerald D., 491 U. S. 110, 120 (1989) (plurality opinion) (emphasis in original). See also id., at 132 (Stevens, J., concur-ring in judgment). Such claims "must ultimately be analyzed" in terms of substantive, not procedural, due process.
Id., at 121. Because the question is not properly before us,
we express no opinion as to whether Connecticut's Megan's
Law violates principles of substantive due process.

Plaintiffs who assert a right to a hearing under the Due
Process Clause must show that the facts they seek to establish in that hearing are relevant under the statutory scheme.
Respondent cannot make that showing here. The judgment
of the Court of Appeals is therefore

Reversed.

Justice Scalia, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion, and add that even if the requirements of Connecticut's sex offender registration law implicate a liberty interest of respondents, the categorical abrogation of that liberty interest by a validly enacted statute
suffices to provide all the process that is "due"--just as a
state law providing that no one under the age of 16 may
operate a motor vehicle suffices to abrogate that liberty interest. Absent a claim (which respondents have not made
here) that the liberty interest in question is so fundamental
as to implicate so-called "substantive" due process, a properly enacted law can eliminate it. That is ultimately why,

Souter, J., concurring
as the Court's opinion demonstrates, a convicted sex offenderhas no more right to additional "process" enabling him to

establish that he is not dangerous than (in the analogous casejust suggested) a 15-year-old has a right to "process" enabling him to establish that he is a safe driver.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,concurring.

I join the Court's opinion and agree with the observationthat today's holding does not foreclose a claim that Connecticut's dissemination of registry information is actionable on asubstantive due process principle. To the extent that libel
might be at least a component of such a claim, our referenceto Connecticut's disclaimer,

ante, at 5, would not stand in theway of a substantive due process plaintiff. I write separately only to note that a substantive due process claim maynot be the only one still open to a test by those in the respondents' situation.Connecticut allows certain sex offenders the possibility of
avoiding the registration and reporting obligations of thestatute. A court may exempt a convict from registration
altogether if his offense was unconsented sexual contact,Conn. Gen. Stat. $ 54-251(c) (2001), or sexual intercourse
with a minor aged between 13 and 16 while the offender wasmore than two years older than the minor, provided the offender was under age 19 at the time of the offense, $ 54-251(b). A court also has discretion to limit dissemination
of an offender's registration information to law enforcementpurposes if necessary to protect the identity of a victim who
is related to the offender or, in the case of a sexual assault,who is the offender's spouse or cohabitor. $$ 54-255(a), (b).*

*To mitigate the retroactive effects of the statute, offenders in these
categories who were convicted between October 1, 1988, and June 30, 1999,
were allowed to petition a court for restricted dissemination of registry

Whether the decision is to exempt an offender from registra-tion or to restrict publication of registry information, it must

rest on a finding that registration or public dissemination isnot required for public safety. $$ 54-251(b), 54-255(a), (b).
The State thus recognizes that some offenders within thesweep of the publication requirement are not dangerous to
others in any way justifying special publicity on the Internet,and the legislative decision to make courts responsible for
granting exemptions belies the State's argument that courtsare unequipped to separate offenders who warrant special
publication from those who do not.The line drawn by the legislature between offenders who
are sensibly considered eligible to seek discretionary relieffrom the courts and those who are not is, like all legislative
choices affecting individual rights, open to challenge underthe Equal Protection Clause. See,

e. g., 3 R. Rotunda & J.Nowak, Treatise on Constitutional Law $ 17.6 (3d ed. 1999);

L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law $ 16-34 (2d ed. 1988).The refusal to allow even the possibility of relief to, say, a
19-year-old who has consensual intercourse with a minoraged 16 is therefore a reviewable legislative determination.
Today's case is no occasion to speak either to the possiblemerits of such a challenge or the standard of scrutiny that
might be in order when considering it. I merely note thatthe Court's rejection of respondents' procedural due process
claim does not immunize publication schemes like Connecti-cut's from an equal protection challenge.

11OCTOBER TERM, 2002
Syllabus

EWING v. CALIFORNIA
certiorari to the court of appeal of california, sec-ond appellate district

No. 01-6978. Argued November 5, 2002--Decided March 5, 2003
Under California's three strikes law, a defendant who is convicted of a

felony and has previously been convicted of two or more serious or violent felonies must receive an indeterminate life imprisonment term.
Such a defendant becomes eligible for parole on a date calculated by
reference to a minimum term, which, in this case, is 25 years. While
on parole, petitioner Ewing was convicted of felony grand theft for stealing three golf clubs, worth $399 apiece. As required by the three
strikes law, the prosecutor formally alleged, and the trial court found,
that Ewing had been convicted previously of four serious or violent
felonies. In sentencing him to 25 years to life, the court refused to
exercise its discretion to reduce the conviction to a misdemeanor--under
a state law that permits certain offenses, known as "wobblers," to be
classified as either misdemeanors or felonies--or to dismiss the allegations of some or all of his prior relevant convictions. The State Court
of Appeal affirmed. Relying on Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263, it
rejected Ewing's claim that his sentence was grossly disproportionate
under the Eighth Amendment and reasoned that enhanced sentences
under the three strikes law served the State's legitimate goal of deterring and incapacitating repeat offenders. The State Supreme Court
denied review.

Held: The judgment is affirmed.
Affirmed.

Justice O'Connor, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy, concluded that Ewing's sentence is not grossly disproportionate
and therefore does not violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on
cruel and unusual punishments. Pp. 20-31.

(a) The Eighth Amendment has a "narrow proportionality principle"
that "applies to noncapital sentences." Harmelin v. Michigan, 501
U. S. 957, 996-997 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment). The Amendment's application in this context is guided by
the principles distilled in Justice Kennedy's concurrence in Harmelin:
"[T]he primacy of the legislature, the variety of legitimate penological
schemes, the nature of our federal system, and the requirement that
proportionality review be guided by objective factors" inform the final
principle that the "Eighth Amendment does not require strict propor538US1 Unit: $U28 [10-26-04 16:31:52] PAGES PGT: OPIN
12 EWING v. CALIFORNIA

Syllabus
tionality between crime and sentence [but] forbids only extreme sentences that are `grossly disproportionate' to the crime." Id., at 1001.
Pp. 20-24.

(b) State legislatures enacting three strikes laws made a deliberate
policy choice that individuals who have repeatedly engaged in serious
or violent criminal behavior, and whose conduct has not been deterred
by more conventional punishment approaches, must be isolated from society to protect the public safety. Though these laws are relatively
new, this Court has a longstanding tradition of deferring to state legislatures in making and implementing such important policy decisions.
The Constitution "does not mandate adoption of any one penological
theory," 501 U. S., at 999, and nothing in the Eighth Amendment prohibits California from choosing to incapacitate criminals who have already
been convicted of at least one serious or violent crime. Recidivism has
long been recognized as a legitimate basis for increased punishment and
is a serious public safety concern in California and the Nation. Any
criticism of the law is appropriately directed at the legislature, which is
primarily responsible for making the policy choices underlying any
criminal sentencing scheme. Pp. 24-28.

(c) In examining Ewing's claim that his sentence is grossly disproportionate, the gravity of the offense must be compared to the harshness
of the penalty. Even standing alone, his grand theft should not be
taken lightly. The California Supreme Court has noted that crime's
seriousness in the context of proportionality review; that it is a "wobbler" is of no moment, for it remains a felony unless the trial court
imposes a misdemeanor sentence. The trial judge justifiably exercised
her discretion not to extend lenient treatment given Ewing's long criminal history. In weighing the offense's gravity, both his current felony
and his long history of felony recidivism must be placed on the scales.
Any other approach would not accord proper deference to the policy
judgments that find expression in the legislature's choice of sanctions.
Ewing's sentence is justified by the State's public-safety interest in incapacitating and deterring recidivist felons, and amply supported by his
own long, serious criminal record. He has been convicted of numerous
offenses, served nine separate prison terms, and committed most of his
crimes while on probation or parole. His prior strikes were serious
felonies including robbery and residential burglary. Though long, his
current sentence reflects a rational legislative judgment that is entitled
to deference. Pp. 28-31.

Justice Scalia agreed that petitioner's sentence does not violate the
Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments, but on the ground that that prohibition was aimed at excluding only certain modes of punishment. This case demonstrates why

a proportionality principle cannot be intelligently applied, and why
Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277, should not be given stare decisis effect.
Pp. 31-32.

Justice Thomas concluded that petitioner's sentence does not violate
the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments because the Amendment contains no proportionality principle.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Justice O'Connor announced the judgment of the Courtand delivered an opinion, in which

The Chief Justice and
Justice Kennedy join.

In this case, we decide whether the Eighth Amendmentprohibits the State of California from sentencing a repeat

felon to a prison term of 25 years to life under the State's"Three Strikes and You're Out" law.

I
A
California's three strikes law reflects a shift in the State'ssentencing policies toward incapacitating and deterring repeat offenders who threaten the public safety. The law wasdesigned "to ensure longer prison sentences and greater
punishment for those who commit a felony and have beenpreviously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses." Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 667(b) (West 1999). OnMarch 3, 1993, California Assemblymen Bill Jones and Jim
Costa introduced Assembly Bill 971, the legislative versionof what would later become the three strikes law. The Assembly Committee on Public Safety defeated the bill onlyweeks later. Public outrage over the defeat sparked a voter
initiative to add Proposition 184, based loosely on the bill, tothe ballot in the November 1994 general election.

On October 1, 1993, while Proposition 184 was circulat-ing, 12-year-old Polly Klaas was kidnaped from her home in
Petaluma, California. Her admitted killer, Richard AllenDavis, had a long criminal history that included two prior
kidnaping convictions. Davis had served only half of his

Cornyn of Texas, Mark L. Shurtleff of Utah, Christine O. Gregoire of
Washington, and Hoke MacMillan of Wyoming; and for the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation et al. by Kent S. Scheidegger and Charles L.
Hobson.

Dennis L. Stout and Grover D. Merritt filed a brief for the California
District Attorneys Association as amicus curiae.

most recent sentence (16 years for kidnaping, assault, andburglary). Had Davis served his entire sentence, he would

still have been in prison on the day that Polly Klaas waskidnaped.

Polly Klaas' murder galvanized support for the threestrikes initiative. Within days, Proposition 184 was on its
way to becoming the fastest qualifying initiative in Califor-nia history. On January 3, 1994, the sponsors of Assembly
Bill 971 resubmitted an amended version of the bill that con-formed to Proposition 184. On January 31, 1994, Assembly
Bill 971 passed the Assembly by a 63 to 9 margin. The Sen-ate passed it by a 29 to 7 margin on March 3, 1994. Governor Pete Wilson signed the bill into law on March 7, 1994.California voters approved Proposition 184 by a margin of
72 to 28 percent on November 8, 1994.California thus became the second State to enact a three
strikes law. In November 1993, the voters of WashingtonState approved their own three strikes law, Initiative 593,
by a margin of 3 to 1. U. S. Dept. of Justice, National In-stitute of Justice, J. Clark, J. Austin, & D. Henry, "Three
Strikes and You're Out": A Review of State Legislation 1(Sept. 1997) (hereinafter Review of State Legislation). Between 1993 and 1995, 24 States and the Federal Governmentenacted three strikes laws. Ibid. Though the three strikes
laws vary from State to State, they share a common goal ofprotecting the public safety by providing lengthy prison
terms for habitual felons. B

California's current three strikes law consists of two virtu-ally identical statutory schemes "designed to increase the
prison terms of repeat felons." People v. Superior Court ofSan Diego Cty. ex rel. Romero, 13 Cal. 4th 497, 504, 917 P. 2d
628, 630 (1996) (Romero). When a defendant is convicted ofa felony, and he has previously been convicted of one or more

is conducted pursuant to the three strikes law. Prior con-victions must be alleged in the charging document, and the

defendant has a right to a jury determination that the prose-cution has proved the prior convictions beyond a reasonable
doubt. $ 1025; $ 1158 (West 1985).If the defendant has one prior "serious" or "violent"
felony conviction, he must be sentenced to "twice the term
otherwise provided as punishment for the current felonyconviction." $ 667(e)(1) (West 1999); $ 1170.12(c)(1) (West

Supp. 2002). If the defendant has two or more prior "seri-ous" or "violent" felony convictions, he must receive "an indeterminate term of life imprisonment." $ 667(e)(2)(A)
(West 1999); $ 1170.12(c)(2)(A) (West Supp. 2002). Defendants sentenced to life under the three strikes law become
eligible for parole on a date calculated by reference to
a "minimum term," which is the greater of (a) three times
the term otherwise provided for the current conviction,
(b) 25 years, or (c) the term determined by the court
pursuant to $ 1170 for the underlying conviction, including any enhancements. $$ 667(e)(2)(A)(i)-(iii) (West 1999);

$$ 1170.12(c)(2)(A)(i)-(iii) (West Supp. 2002).

Under California law, certain offenses may be classified as
either felonies or misdemeanors. These crimes are known
as "wobblers." Some crimes that would otherwise be misdemeanors become "wobblers" because of the defendant's
prior record. For example, petty theft, a misdemeanor, becomes a "wobbler" when the defendant has previously
served a prison term for committing specified theft-related
crimes. $ 490 (West 1999); $ 666 (West Supp. 2002). Other
crimes, such as grand theft, are "wobblers" regardless of the
defendant's prior record. See $ 489(b) (West 1999). Both
types of "wobblers" are triggering offenses under the three
strikes law only when they are treated as felonies. Under
California law, a "wobbler" is presumptively a felony and
"remains a felony except when the discretion is actually exercised" to make the crime a misdemeanor. People v. Wil538US1 Unit: $U28 [10-26-04 16:31:52] PAGES PGT: OPIN

liams, 27 Cal. 2d 220, 229, 163 P. 2d 692, 696 (1945) (emphasisdeleted and internal quotation marks omitted).

In California, prosecutors may exercise their discretion tocharge a "wobbler" as either a felony or a misdemeanor.
Likewise, California trial courts have discretion to reducea "wobbler" charged as a felony to a misdemeanor either
before preliminary examination or at sentencing to avoidimposing a three strikes sentence. Cal. Penal Code Ann.

$$ 17(b)(5), 17(b)(1) (West 1999); People v. Superior Court of
Los Angeles Cty. ex rel. Alvarez, 14 Cal. 4th 968, 978, 928P. 2d 1171, 1177-1178 (1997). In exercising this discretion,

the court may consider "those factors that direct similar sen-tencing decisions," such as "the nature and circumstances of
the offense, the defendant's appreciation of and attitude to-ward the offense, . . . [and] the general objectives of sentencing." Ibid. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).California trial courts can also vacate allegations of prior
"serious" or "violent" felony convictions, either on motion bythe prosecution or

sua sponte. Romero, supra, at 529-530,917 P. 2d, at 647-648. In ruling whether to vacate allegations of prior felony convictions, courts consider whether, "inlight of the nature and circumstances of [the defendant's]
present felonies and prior serious and/or violent felonyconvictions, and the particulars of his background, character,
and prospects, the defendant may be deemed outside the[three strikes'] scheme's spirit, in whole or in part." People
v. Williams, 17 Cal. 4th 148, 161, 948 P. 2d 429, 437(1998). Thus, trial courts may avoid imposing a three
strikes sentence in two ways: first, by reducing "wobblers"to misdemeanors (which do not qualify as triggering offenses), and second, by vacating allegations of prior "serious"or "violent" felony convictions.

On parole from a 9-year prison term, petitioner GaryEwing walked into the pro shop of the El Segundo Golf

Course in Los Angeles County on March 12, 2000. Hewalked out with three golf clubs, priced at $399 apiece, concealed in his pants leg. A shop employee, whose suspicionswere aroused when he observed Ewing limp out of the pro
shop, telephoned the police. The police apprehended Ewingin the parking lot.

Ewing is no stranger to the criminal justice system. In
1984, at the age of 22, he pleaded guilty to theft. The courtsentenced him to six months in jail (suspended), three years'

probation, and a $300 fine. In 1988, he was convicted of fel-ony grand theft auto and sentenced to one year in jail and
three years' probation. After Ewing completed probation,
however, the sentencing court reduced the crime to a misdemeanor, permitted Ewing to withdraw his guilty plea, and
dismissed the case. In 1990, he was convicted of petty theft
with a prior and sentenced to 60 days in the county jail and
three years' probation. In 1992, Ewing was convicted of
battery and sentenced to 30 days in the county jail and two
years' summary probation. One month later, he was convicted of theft and sentenced to 10 days in the county jail
and 12 months' probation. In January 1993, Ewing was convicted of burglary and sentenced to 60 days in the county
jail and one year's summary probation. In February 1993,
he was convicted of possessing drug paraphernalia and sentenced to six months in the county jail and three years' probation. In July 1993, he was convicted of appropriating lost
property and sentenced to 10 days in the county jail and
two years' summary probation. In September 1993, he was
convicted of unlawfully possessing a firearm and trespassing
and sentenced to 30 days in the county jail and one year's
probation.

In October and November 1993, Ewing committed three
burglaries and one robbery at a Long Beach, California,
apartment complex over a 5-week period. He awakened one
of his victims, asleep on her living room sofa, as he tried to
disconnect her video cassette recorder from the television in

that room. When she screamed, Ewing ran out the frontdoor. On another occasion, Ewing accosted a victim in the

mailroom of the apartment complex. Ewing claimed to havea gun and ordered the victim to hand over his wallet. When
the victim resisted, Ewing produced a knife and forced thevictim back to the apartment itself. While Ewing rifled
through the bedroom, the victim fled the apartment screaming for help. Ewing absconded with the victim's money andcredit cards.

On December 9, 1993, Ewing was arrested on the premisesof the apartment complex for trespassing and lying to a
police officer. The knife used in the robbery and a glass
cocaine pipe were later found in the back seat of the patrol
car used to transport Ewing to the police station. A jury
convicted Ewing of first-degree robbery and three counts of
residential burglary. Sentenced to nine years and eight
months in prison, Ewing was paroled in 1999.

Only 10 months later, Ewing stole the golf clubs at issue
in this case. He was charged with, and ultimately convicted
of, one count of felony grand theft of personal property in
excess of $400. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 484 (West Supp.
2002); $ 489 (West 1999). As required by the three strikes
law, the prosecutor formally alleged, and the trial court later
found, that Ewing had been convicted previously of four serious or violent felonies for the three burglaries and the robbery in the Long Beach apartment complex. See $ 667(g)
(West 1999); $ 1170.12(e) (West Supp. 2002).

At the sentencing hearing, Ewing asked the court to reduce the conviction for grand theft, a "wobbler" under California law, to a misdemeanor so as to avoid a three strikes
sentence. See $$ 17(b), 667(d)(1) (West 1999); $ 1170.12(b)(1)
(West Supp. 2002). Ewing also asked the trial court to exercise its discretion to dismiss the allegations of some or all
of his prior serious or violent felony convictions, again for
purposes of avoiding a three strikes sentence. See Romero,
13 Cal. 4th, at 529-531, 917 P. 2d, at 647-648. Before sen538US1 Unit: $U28 [10-26-04 16:31:52] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tencing Ewing, the trial court took note of his entire criminal
history, including the fact that he was on parole when he
committed his latest offense. The court also heard arguments from defense counsel and a plea from Ewing himself.

In the end, the trial judge determined that the grand theft
should remain a felony. The court also ruled that the four
prior strikes for the three burglaries and the robbery in
Long Beach should stand. As a newly convicted felon with
two or more "serious" or "violent" felony convictions in his
past, Ewing was sentenced under the three strikes law to 25
years to life.

The California Court of Appeal affirmed in an unpublished
opinion. No. B143745 (Apr. 25, 2001). Relying on our decision in Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263 (1980), the court
rejected Ewing's claim that his sentence was grossly disproportionate under the Eighth Amendment. Enhanced sentences under recidivist statutes like the three strikes law,
the court reasoned, serve the "legitimate goal" of deterring
and incapacitating repeat offenders. The Supreme Court
of California denied Ewing's petition for review, and we
granted certiorari, 535 U. S. 969 (2002). We now affirm.

II

A

The Eighth Amendment, which forbids cruel and unusual
punishments, contains a "narrow proportionality principle"
that "applies to noncapital sentences." Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 996-997 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring
in part and concurring in judgment); cf. Weems v. United
States, 217 U. S. 349, 371 (1910); Robinson v. California, 370
U. S. 660, 667 (1962) (applying the Eighth Amendment to the
States via the Fourteenth Amendment). We have most recently addressed the proportionality principle as applied to
terms of years in a series of cases beginning with Rummel
v. Estelle, supra.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
In Rummel, we held that it did not violate the EighthAmendment for a State to sentence a three-time offender to

life in prison with the possibility of parole. Id., at 284-285.Like Ewing, Rummel was sentenced to a lengthy prison term
under a recidivism statute. Rummel's two prior offenseswere a 1964 felony for "fraudulent use of a credit card to
obtain $80 worth of goods or services," and a 1969 felony
conviction for "passing a forged check in the amount of$28.36."

Id., at 265. His triggering offense was a conviction for felony theft--"obtaining $120.75 by false pretenses."
Id., at 266.

This Court ruled that "[h]aving twice imprisoned him for
felonies, Texas was entitled to place upon Rummel the onus
of one who is simply unable to bring his conduct within the
social norms prescribed by the criminal law of the State."
Id., at 284. The recidivism statute "is nothing more than a
societal decision that when such a person commits yet another felony, he should be subjected to the admittedly serious penalty of incarceration for life, subject only to the
State's judgment as to whether to grant him parole." Id.,
at 278. We noted that this Court "has on occasion stated
that the Eighth Amendment prohibits imposition of a sentence that is grossly disproportionate to the severity of the
crime." Id., at 271. But "[o]utside the context of capital
punishment, successful challenges to the proportionality of
particular sentences have been exceedingly rare." Id., at
272. Although we stated that the proportionality principle
"would . . . come into play in the extreme example . . . if a
legislature made overtime parking a felony punishable by
life imprisonment," id., at 274, n. 11, we held that "the mandatory life sentence imposed upon this petitioner does not
constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth
and Fourteenth Amendments," id., at 285.

In Hutto v. Davis, 454 U. S. 370 (1982) (per curiam), the
defendant was sentenced to two consecutive terms of 20
years in prison for possession with intent to distribute nine

22 EWING v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
ounces of marijuana and distribution of marijuana. We held
that such a sentence was constitutional: "In short, Rummel
stands for the proposition that federal courts should be reluctant to review legislatively mandated terms of imprisonment, and that successful challenges to the proportionality
of particular sentences should be exceedingly rare." Id., at
374 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).

Three years after Rummel, in Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S.
277, 279 (1983), we held that the Eighth Amendment prohibited "a life sentence without possibility of parole for a seventh nonviolent felony." The triggering offense in Solem
was "uttering a `no account' check for $100." Id., at 281.
We specifically stated that the Eighth Amendment's ban on
cruel and unusual punishments "prohibits . . . sentences that
are disproportionate to the crime committed," and that the
"constitutional principle of proportionality has been recognized explicitly in this Court for almost a century." Id., at
284, 286. The Solem Court then explained that three factors may be relevant to a determination of whether a sentence is so disproportionate that it violates the Eighth
Amendment: "(i) the gravity of the offense and the harshness
of the penalty; (ii) the sentences imposed on other criminals
in the same jurisdiction; and (iii) the sentences imposed for
commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions." Id.,
at 292.

Applying these factors in Solem, we struck down the defendant's sentence of life without parole. We specifically
noted the contrast between that sentence and the sentence
in Rummel, pursuant to which the defendant was eligible for
parole. 463 U. S., at 297; see also id., at 300 ("[T]he South
Dakota commutation system is fundamentally different from
the parole system that was before us in Rummel"). Indeed,
we explicitly declined to overrule Rummel: "[O]ur conclusion
today is not inconsistent with Rummel v. Estelle." 463
U. S., at 303, n. 32; see also id., at 288, n. 13 ("[O]ur decision

Eight years after Solem, we grappled with the proportionality issue again in Harmelin. Harmelin was not a recidivism case, but rather involved a first-time offender convicted
of possessing 672 grams of cocaine. He was sentenced to
life in prison without possibility of parole. A majority of
the Court rejected Harmelin's claim that his sentence was
so grossly disproportionate that it violated the Eighth
Amendment. The Court, however, could not agree on why
his proportionality argument failed. Justice Scalia,
joined by The Chief Justice, wrote that the proportionality principle was "an aspect of our death penalty jurisprudence, rather than a generalizable aspect of Eighth Amendment law." 501 U. S. at 994. He would thus have declined
to apply gross disproportionality principles except in reviewing capital sentences. Ibid.

Justice Kennedy, joined by two other Members of the
Court, concurred in part and concurred in the judgment.
Justice Kennedy specifically recognized that "[t]he Eighth
Amendment proportionality principle also applies to noncapital sentences." Id., at 997. He then identified four principles of proportionality review--"the primacy of the legislature, the variety of legitimate penological schemes, the
nature of our federal system, and the requirement that proportionality review be guided by objective factors"--that
"inform the final one: The Eighth Amendment does not require strict proportionality between crime and sentence.
Rather, it forbids only extreme sentences that are `grossly
disproportionate' to the crime." Id., at 1001 (citing Solem,
supra, at 288). Justice Kennedy's concurrence also stated
that Solem "did not mandate" comparative analysis "within
and between jurisdictions." 501 U. S., at 1004-1005.

The proportionality principles in our cases distilled in Justice Kennedy's concurrence guide our application of the

Eighth Amendment in the new context that we are calledupon to consider.

B
For many years, most States have had laws providing forenhanced sentencing of repeat offenders. See,

e. g., U. S.Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Assistance, National Assessment of Structured Sentencing (1996). Yet between1993 and 1995, three strikes laws effected a sea change in
criminal sentencing throughout the Nation.1 These laws re-sponded to widespread public concerns about crime by targeting the class of offenders who pose the greatest threat topublic safety: career criminals. As one of the chief architects of California's three strikes law has explained: "ThreeStrikes was intended to go beyond simply making sentences
tougher. It was intended to be a focused effort to create asentencing policy that would use the judicial system to reduce serious and violent crime." Ardaiz, California's ThreeStrikes Law: History, Expectations, Consequences, 32 McGeorge L. Rev. 1, 12 (2000) (hereinafter Ardaiz).Throughout the States, legislatures enacting three strikes
laws made a deliberate policy choice that individuals whohave repeatedly engaged in serious or violent criminal behavior, and whose conduct has not been deterred by moreconventional approaches to punishment, must be isolated
from society in order to protect the public safety. Thoughthree strikes laws may be relatively new, our tradition of
deferring to state legislatures in making and implementingsuch important policy decisions is longstanding. Weems,
217 U. S., at 379; Gore v. United States, 357 U. S. 386, 393

1 It is hardly surprising that the statistics relied upon by Justice
Breyer show that prior to the enactment of the three strikes law, "no
one like Ewing could have served more than 10 years in prison." Post,
at 43 (dissenting opinion) (emphasis added). Profound disappointment
with the perceived lenity of criminal sentencing (especially for repeat felons) led to passage of three strikes laws in the first place. See, e. g., Review of State Legislation 1.

(1958); Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 824 (1991); Rummel, 445 U. S., at 274; Solem, 463 U. S., at 290; Harmelin,
501 U. S., at 998 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concur-ring in judgment).

Our traditional deference to legislative policy choices findsa corollary in the principle that the Constitution "does not
mandate adoption of any one penological theory." Id., at 999
(Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg-ment). A sentence can have a variety of justifications, such

as incapacitation, deterrence, retribution, or rehabilitation.See 1 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law $ 1.5,
pp. 30-36 (1986) (explaining theories of punishment). Some
or all of these justifications may play a role in a State's
sentencing scheme. Selecting the sentencing rationales is
generally a policy choice to be made by state legislatures,
not federal courts.

When the California Legislature enacted the three strikes
law, it made a judgment that protecting the public safety
requires incapacitating criminals who have already been convicted of at least one serious or violent crime. Nothing in
the Eighth Amendment prohibits California from making
that choice. To the contrary, our cases establish that
"States have a valid interest in deterring and segregating
habitual criminals." Parke v. Raley, 506 U. S. 20, 27 (1992);
Oyler v. Boles, 368 U. S. 448, 451 (1962) ("[T]he constitutionality of the practice of inflicting severer criminal penalties
upon habitual offenders is no longer open to serious challenge"). Recidivism has long been recognized as a legitimate basis for increased punishment. See AlmendarezTorres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224, 230 (1998) (recidivism
"is as typical a sentencing factor as one might imagine");
Witte v. United States, 515 U. S. 389, 400 (1995) ("In repeatedly upholding such recidivism statutes, we have rejected
double jeopardy challenges because the enhanced punishment imposed for the later offense . . . [is] `a stiffened penalty
for the latest crime, which is considered to be an aggravated

offense because a repetitive one' " (quoting Gryger v. Burke,334 U. S. 728, 732 (1948))).

California's justification is no pretext. Recidivism is a se-rious public safety concern in California and throughout the
Nation. According to a recent report, approximately 67 per-cent of former inmates released from state prisons were
charged with at least one "serious" new crime within three
years of their release. See U. S. Dept. of Justice, Bureauof Justice Statistics, P. Langan & D. Levin, Special Report:

Recidivism of Prisoners Released in 1994, p. 1 (June 2002).In particular, released property offenders like Ewing had
higher recidivism rates than those released after committing
violent, drug, or public-order offenses. Id., at 8. Approximately 73 percent of the property offenders released in 1994
were arrested again within three years, compared to approximately 61 percent of the violent offenders, 62 percent of the
public-order offenders, and 66 percent of the drug offenders. Ibid.

In 1996, when the Sacramento Bee studied 233 three
strikes offenders in California, it found that they had an aggregate of 1,165 prior felony convictions, an average of 5
apiece. See Furillo, Three Strikes--The Verdict: Most Offenders Have Long Criminal Histories, Sacramento Bee,
Mar. 31, 1996, p. A1. The prior convictions included 322 robberies and 262 burglaries. Ibid. About 84 percent of the
233 three strikes offenders had been convicted of at least one
violent crime. Ibid. In all, they were responsible for 17
homicides, 7 attempted slayings, and 91 sexual assaults and
child molestations. Ibid. The Sacramento Bee concluded,
based on its investigation, that "[i]n the vast majority of the
cases, regardless of the third strike, the [three strikes] law
is snaring [the] long-term habitual offenders with multiple
felony convictions . . . ." Ibid.

The State's interest in deterring crime also lends some
support to the three strikes law. We have long viewed both
incapacitation and deterrence as rationales for recidivism

statutes: "[A] recidivist statute['s] . . . primary goals are todeter repeat offenders and, at some point in the life of one

who repeatedly commits criminal offenses serious enough tobe punished as felonies, to segregate that person from the
rest of society for an extended period of time." Rummel,
supra, at 284. Four years after the passage of California's
three strikes law, the recidivism rate of parolees returned to
prison for the commission of a new crime dropped by nearly25 percent. California Dept. of Justice, Office of the Attorney General, "Three Strikes and You're Out"--Its Impact onthe California Criminal Justice System After Four Years,
p. 10 (1998). Even more dramatically:

"An unintended but positive consequence of `Three
Strikes' has been the impact on parolees leaving thestate. More California parolees are now leaving the

state than parolees from other jurisdictions enteringCalifornia. This striking turnaround started in 1994.
It was the first time more parolees left the state thanentered since 1976. This trend has continued and in
1997 more than 1,000 net parolees left California."
Ibid.

To be sure, California's three strikes law has sparked controversy. Critics have doubted the law's wisdom, costefficiency, and effectiveness in reaching its goals. See, e. g.,

28 EWING v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
L. & C. 395, 423 (1997). This criticism is appropriately di-rected at the legislature, which has primary responsibility

for making the difficult policy choices that underlie any crim-inal sentencing scheme. We do not sit as a "superlegislature" to second-guess these policy choices. It is enough thatthe State of California has a reasonable basis for believing
that dramatically enhanced sentences for habitual felons "ad-vance[s] the goals of [its] criminal justice system in any substantial way." See Solem, 463 U. S., at 297, n. 22.

III
Against this backdrop, we consider Ewing's claim that histhree strikes sentence of 25 years to life is unconstitutionally

disproportionate to his offense of "shoplifting three golfclubs." Brief for Petitioner 6. We first address the gravity
of the offense compared to the harshness of the penalty. Atthe threshold, we note that Ewing incorrectly frames the
issue. The gravity of his offense was not merely "shop-lifting three golf clubs." Rather, Ewing was convicted of
felony grand theft for stealing nearly $1,200 worth of mer-chandise after previously having been convicted of at least
two "violent" or "serious" felonies. Even standing alone,Ewing's theft should not be taken lightly. His crime was
certainly not "one of the most passive felonies a person couldcommit."

Solem, supra, at 296 (internal quotation marksomitted). To the contrary, the Supreme Court of California

has noted the "seriousness" of grand theft in the context ofproportionality review. See In re Lynch, 8 Cal. 3d 410, 432,
n. 20, 503 P. 2d 921, 936, n. 20 (1972). Theft of $1,200 inproperty is a felony under federal law, 18 U. S. C. $ 641, and
in the vast majority of States. See App. B to Brief forPetitioner 21a.

That grand theft is a "wobbler" under California law isof no moment. Though California courts have discretion to
reduce a felony grand theft charge to a misdemeanor, it re-mains a felony for all purposes "unless and until the trial

court imposes a misdemeanor sentence." In re Anderson,
69 Cal. 2d 613, 626, 447 P. 2d 117, 126 (1968) (Tobriner, J.,
concurring); see generally 1 B. Witkin & N. Epstein, California Criminal Law $ 73 (3d ed. 2000). "The purpose of the
trial judge's sentencing discretion" to downgrade certain felonies is to "impose a misdemeanor sentence in those cases in
which the rehabilitation of the convicted defendant either
does not require, or would be adversely affected by, incarceration in a state prison as a felon." Anderson, supra, at
664-665, 447 P. 2d, at 152 (Tobriner, J., concurring). Under
California law, the reduction is not based on the notion that
a "wobbler" is "conceptually a misdemeanor." Necochea v.
Superior Court, 23 Cal. App. 3d 1012, 1016, 100 Cal. Rptr.
693, 695 (1972). Rather, it is "intended to extend misdemeanant treatment to a potential felon." Ibid. In Ewing's
case, however, the trial judge justifiably exercised her discretion not to extend such lenient treatment given Ewing's
long criminal history.

In weighing the gravity of Ewing's offense, we must place
on the scales not only his current felony, but also his long
history of felony recidivism. Any other approach would fail
to accord proper deference to the policy judgments that find
expression in the legislature's choice of sanctions. In imposing a three strikes sentence, the State's interest is not
merely punishing the offense of conviction, or the "triggering" offense: "[I]t is in addition the interest . . . in dealing in
a harsher manner with those who by repeated criminal acts
have shown that they are simply incapable of conforming to
the norms of society as established by its criminal law."
Rummel, 445 U. S., at 276; Solem, supra, at 296. To give
full effect to the State's choice of this legitimate penological
goal, our proportionality review of Ewing's sentence must
take that goal into account.

Ewing's sentence is justified by the State's public-safety
interest in incapacitating and deterring recidivist felons, and

amply supported by his own long, serious criminal record.2
Ewing has been convicted of numerous misdemeanor and felony offenses, served nine separate terms of incarceration,
and committed most of his crimes while on probation or parole. His prior "strikes" were serious felonies including
robbery and three residential burglaries. To be sure, Ewing's sentence is a long one. But it reflects a rational legislative judgment, entitled to deference, that offenders who
have committed serious or violent felonies and who continue
to commit felonies must be incapacitated. The State of California "was entitled to place upon [Ewing] the onus of one
who is simply unable to bring his conduct within the social
norms prescribed by the criminal law of the State." Rummel, supra, at 284. Ewing's is not "the rare case in which
a threshold comparison of the crime committed and the sentence imposed leads to an inference of gross disproportionality." Harmelin, 501 U. S., at 1005 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).

We hold that Ewing's sentence of 25 years to life in prison,
imposed for the offense of felony grand theft under the three
strikes law, is not grossly disproportionate and therefore
does not violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on

2 Justice Breyer argues that including Ewing's grand theft as a triggering offense cannot be justified on "property-crime-related incapacitation grounds" because such crimes do not count as prior strikes. Post,
at 51. But the State's interest in dealing with repeat felons like Ewing
is not so limited. As we have explained, the overarching objective of the
three strikes law is to prevent serious or violent offenders like Ewing
from repeating their criminal behavior. See Cal. Penal Code Ann.

$ 667(b) (West 1999) ("It is the intent of the Legislature . . . to ensure longer prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have been previously convicted of serious and/or violent
felony offenses"). The California Legislature therefore made a "deliberate policy decision . . . that the gravity of the new felony should not be a
determinative factor in `triggering' the application of the Three Strikes
Law." Ardaiz 9. Neither the Eighth Amendment nor this Court's precedent forecloses that legislative choice.

cruel and unusual punishments. The judgment of the Cali-fornia Court of Appeal is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment.
In my opinion in Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 985
(1991), I concluded that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition
of "cruel and unusual punishments" was aimed at excludingonly certain

modes of punishment, and was not a "guarantee
against disproportionate sentences." Out of respect for theprinciple of

stare decisis, I might nonetheless accept the contrary holding of Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277 (1983)--thatthe Eighth Amendment contains a narrow proportionality

principle--if I felt I could intelligently apply it. This casedemonstrates why I cannot.

Proportionality--the notion that the punishment should fit
the crime--is inherently a concept tied to the penological
goal of retribution. "[I]t becomes difficult even to speak intelligently of `proportionality,' once deterrence and rehabilitation are given significant weight," Harmelin, supra, at
989--not to mention giving weight to the purpose of California's three strikes law: incapacitation. In the present case,
the game is up once the plurality has acknowledged that "the
Constitution does not mandate adoption of any one penological theory," and that a "sentence can have a variety of justifications, such as incapacitation, deterrence, retribution, or
rehabilitation." Ante, at 25 (internal quotation marks omitted). That acknowledgment having been made, it no longer
suffices merely to assess "the gravity of the offense compared to the harshness of the penalty," ante, at 28; that classic description of the proportionality principle (alone and in
itself quite resistant to policy-free, legal analysis) now becomes merely the "first" step of the inquiry, ibid. Having
completed that step (by a discussion which, in all fairness,
does not convincingly establish that 25-years-to-life is a "proportionate" punishment for stealing three golf clubs), the

plurality must then add an analysis to show that "Ewing'ssentence is justified by the State's public-safety interest in

incapacitating and deterring recidivist felons." Ante, at 29.Which indeed it is--though why that has anything to do
with the principle of proportionality is a mystery. Perhapsthe plurality should revise its terminology, so that what it
reads into the Eighth Amendment is not the unstated propo-sition that all punishment should be reasonably proportionate to the gravity of the offense, but rather the unstatedproposition that all punishment should reasonably pursue the
multiple purposes of the criminal law. That formulationwould make it clearer than ever, of course, that the plurality
is not applying law but evaluating policy.Because I agree that petitioner's sentence does not violate
the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and un-usual punishments, I concur in the judgment.

Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.
I agree with Justice Scalia's view that the proportional-ity test announced in Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277 (1983),

is incapable of judicial application. Even were Solem's testperfectly clear, however, I would not feel compelled by stare
decisis to apply it. In my view, the Cruel and UnusualPunishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment contains no
proportionality principle. See Harmelin v. Michigan, 501U. S. 957, 966-985 (1991) (opinion of

Scalia, J.).Because the plurality concludes that petitioner's sentence

does not violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition oncruel and unusual punishments, I concur in the judgment.

rences prompt this separate writing to emphasize that pro-portionality review is not only capable of judicial application

but also required by the Eighth Amendment."The Eighth Amendment succinctly prohibits `excessive'
sanctions." Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304, 311 (2002); seealso U. S. Const., Amdt. 8 ("Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual
punishments inflicted"). Faithful to the Amendment's text,this Court has held that the Constitution directs judges to

apply their best judgment in determining the proportionalityof fines, see,

e. g., United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U. S. 321,
334-336 (1998), bail, see, e. g., Stack v. Boyle, 342 U. S. 1, 5(1951), and other forms of punishment, including the imposition of a death sentence, see, e. g., Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S.584, 592 (1977). It "would be anomalous indeed" to suggest
that the Eighth Amendment makes proportionality reviewapplicable in the context of bail and fines but not in the context of other forms of punishment, such as imprisonment.
Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277, 289 (1983). Rather, by broadly
prohibiting excessive sanctions, the Eighth Amendment directs judges to exercise their wise judgment in assessing theproportionality of all forms of punishment.

The absence of a black-letter rule does not disable judgesfrom exercising their discretion in construing the outer
limits on sentencing authority that the Eighth Amendmentimposes. After all, judges are "constantly called upon to
draw . . . lines in a variety of contexts," id., at 294, andto exercise their judgment to give meaning to the Constitution's broadly phrased protections. For example, the Due
Process Clause directs judges to employ proportionality reclaim. I agree with Justice Breyer that Ewing's sentence is grossly
disproportionate even under Harmelin's narrow proportionality framework. However, it is not clear that this case is controlled by Harmelin,
which considered the proportionality of a life sentence imposed on a drug
offender who had no prior felony convictions. Rather, the three-factor
analysis established in Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277, 290-291 (1983), which
specifically addressed recidivist sentencing, seems more directly on point.

view in assessing the constitutionality of punitive damagesawards on a case-by-case basis. See,

e. g., BMW of North
America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U. S. 559, 562 (1996). Also,although the Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the right to a speedy trial, the courts often are askedto determine on a case-by-case basis whether a particular
delay is constitutionally permissible or not. See, e. g., Doggett v. United States, 505 U. S. 647 (1992).2Throughout most of the Nation's history--before guideline

sentencing became so prevalent--federal and state trialjudges imposed specific sentences pursuant to grants of authority that gave them uncabined discretion within broadranges. See K. Stith & J. Cabranes, Fear of Judging: Sentencing Guidelines in the Federal Courts 9 (1998) (herein-after Stith & Cabranes) ("From the beginning of the Republic, federal judges were entrusted with wide sentencingdiscretion"); see also

Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S.

See, e. g., State v. Perley, 86 Me. 427, 30 A. 74, 75 (1894) (citing Maine statute that made robbery punishable by imprisonment for life or any term of years); In re Southard, 298

account all of the justifications for punishment--namely,deterrence, incapacitation, retribution, and rehabilitation.
See Stith & Cabranes 14. Likewise, I think it clear thatthe Eighth Amendment's prohibition of "cruel and unusual
punishments" expresses a broad and basic proportionalityprinciple that takes into account all of the justifications for
penal sanctions. It is this broad proportionality principlethat would preclude reliance on any of the justifications for
punishment to support, for example, a life sentence for over-time parking. See

Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263, 274,n. 11 (1980).

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.
Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice
Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

The constitutional question is whether the "three strikes"sentence imposed by California upon repeat-offender Gary

Ewing is "grossly disproportionate" to his crime. Ante,at 14, 30-31 (plurality opinion). The sentence amounts to
a real prison term of at least 25 years. The sentence-triggering criminal conduct consists of the theft of three golf
clubs priced at a total of $1,197. See ante, at 18. The of-fender has a criminal history that includes four felony convictions arising out of three separate burglaries (one armed).
Ante, at 18-19. In Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277 (1983), theCourt found grossly disproportionate a somewhat longer sentence imposed on a recidivist offender for triggering criminalconduct that was somewhat less severe. In my view, the
differences are not determinative, and the Court shouldreach the same ultimate conclusion here.

concurring in part and concurring in judgment); Rummel,
supra, at 272 ("[S]uccessful challenges to the proportionality
of particular sentences have been exceedingly rare"). And
they will only " `rarely' " find it necessary to " `engage in
extended analysis' " before rejecting a claim that a sentence
is "grossly disproportionate." Harmelin, supra, at 1004
(Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (quoting Solem, supra, at 290, n. 16).

The plurality applies Justice Kennedy's analytical
framework in Harmelin, supra, at 1004-1005 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Ante, at 23-
24. And, for present purposes, I will consider Ewing's
Eighth Amendment claim on those terms. But see ante,
at 32-33, n. 1 (Stevens, J., dissenting). To implement this
approach, courts faced with a "gross disproportionality"
claim must first make "a threshold comparison of the crime
committed and the sentence imposed." Harmelin, supra, at
1005 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment). If a claim crosses that threshold--itself a rare
occurrence--then the court should compare the sentence at
issue to other sentences "imposed on other criminals" in the
same, or in other, jurisdictions. Solem, supra, at 290-291;

Harmelin, 501 U. S., at 1005 (Kennedy, J., concurring inpart and concurring in judgment). The comparative analysis will "validate" or invalidate "an initial judgment that asentence is grossly disproportionate to a crime." Ibid.

I recognize the warnings implicit in the Court's frequentrepetition of words such as "rare." Nonetheless I believe
that the case before us is a "rare" case--one in which a courtcan say with reasonable confidence that the punishment is
"grossly disproportionate" to the crime.

II
Ewing 's claim crosses the gross disproportionality"threshold." First, precedent makes clear that Ewing's

sentence raises a seri ous dispropor ti onality questi on.Ewing is a recidivist. Hence the two cases most directly

in point are those in which the Court considered the consti-tutionality of recidivist sentencing: Rummel and Solem.
Ewing's claim falls between these two cases. It is strongerthan the claim presented in Rummel, where the Court upheld a recidivist's sentence as constitutional. It is weakerthan the claim presented in Solem, where the Court struck
down a recidivist sentence as unconstitutional.Three kinds of sentence-related characteristics define the
relevant comparative spectrum: (a) the length of the prisonterm in real time,

i. e., the time that the offender is likelyactually to spend in prison; (b) the sentence-triggering criminal conduct, i. e., the offender's actual behavior or otheroffense-related circumstances; and (c) the offender's criminal
history. See Rummel, supra, at 265-266, 269, 276, 278, 280-281 (using these factors); Solem, supra, at 290-303 (same).
Cf. United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Man-ual ch. 1, pt. A, intro., n. 5 (Nov. 1987) (USSG) (empirical
study of "summary reports of some 40,000 convictions [and]a sample of 10,000 augmented presentence reports" leads to
sentences based primarily upon (a) offense characteristicsand (b) offender's criminal record); see

id., p. s. 3.

38 EWING v. CALIFORNIA

Breyer, J., dissenting
In Rummel, the Court held constitutional (a) a sentence oflife imprisonment

with parole available within 10 to 12
years, (b) for the offense of obtaining $120 by false pretenses,(c) committed by an offender with two prior felony convictions (involving small amounts of money). 445 U. S. 263;
ante, at 21. In Solem, the Court held unconstitutional (a) a
sentence of life imprisonment without parole, (b) for the
crime of writing a $100 check on a nonexistent bank account,(c) committed by an offender with six prior felony convictions

(including three for burglary). 463 U. S. 277; ante, at 22-23.Which of the three pertinent comparative factors made the
constitutional difference?

The third factor, prior record, cannot explain the difference. The offender's prior record was worse in Solem,
where the Court found the sentence too long, than in Rummel, where the Court upheld the sentence. The second factor, offense conduct, cannot explain the difference. The nature of the triggering offense--viewed in terms of the actual
monetary loss--in the two cases was about the same. The
one critical factor that explains the difference in the outcome
is the length of the likely prison term measured in real time.
In Rummel, where the Court upheld the sentence, the state
sentencing statute authorized parole for the offender, Rummel, after 10 or 12 years. 445 U. S., at 280; id., at 293 (Powell, J., dissenting). In Solem, where the Court struck down
the sentence, the sentence required the offender, Helm, to
spend the rest of his life in prison.

Now consider the present case. The third factor, offender
characteristics--i. e., prior record--does not differ significantly here from that in Solem. Ewing's prior record consists of four prior felony convictions (involving three burglaries, one with a knife) contrasted with Helm's six prior
felony convictions (including three burglaries, though none
with weapons). The second factor, offense behavior, is
worse than that in Solem, but only to a degree. It would
be difficult to say that the actual behavior itself here (shop538US1 Unit: $U28 [10-26-04 16:31:52] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
lifting) differs significantly from that at issue in Solem (pass-ing a bad check) or in

Rummel (obtaining money through
false pretenses). Rather the difference lies in the value ofthe goods obtained. That difference, measured in terms of

the most relevant feature (loss to the victim, i. e., wholesalevalue) and adjusted for the irrelevant feature of inflation,
comes down (in 1979 values) to about $379 here compared
with $100 in Solem, or (in 1973 values) to $232 here com-pared with $120.75 in

Rummel. See USSG $ 2B1.1, comment., n. 2(A)(i) (Nov. 2002) (loss to victim properly meas-ures value of goods unlawfully taken); U. S. Dept. of Labor,

Bureau of Labor Statistics, Inflation and Consumer Spending, Inflation Calculator (Jan. 23, 2003), http://www.bls.gov
(hereinafter Inflation Calculator). Alternatively, if one
measures the inflation-adjusted value difference in terms of
the golf clubs' sticker price, it comes down to $505 here compared to $100 in Solem, or $309 here compared to $120.75 in
Rummel. See Inflation Calculator.

The difference in length of the real prison term--the first,
and critical, factor in Solem and Rummel--is considerably
more important. Ewing's sentence here amounts, in real
terms, to at least 25 years without parole or good-time credits. That sentence is considerably shorter than Helm's sentence in Solem, which amounted, in real terms, to life in
prison. Nonetheless Ewing's real prison term is more than
twice as long as the term at issue in Rummel, which
amounted, in real terms, to at least 10 or 12 years. And,
Ewing's sentence, unlike Rummel's (but like Helm's sentence
in Solem), is long enough to consume the productive remainder of almost any offender's life. (It means that Ewing himself, seriously ill when sentenced at age 38, will likely die
in prison.)

The upshot is that the length of the real prison term--the
factor that explains the Solem/Rummel difference in outcome--places Ewing closer to Solem than to Rummel,
though the greater value of the golf clubs that Ewing stole

Breyer, J., dissenting
moves Ewing's case back slightly in Rummel's direction.Overall, the comparison places Ewing's sentence well within

the twilight zone between Solem and Rummel--a zonewhere the argument for unconstitutionality is substantial,
where the cases themselves cannot determine the constitu-tional outcome.

Second, Ewing's sentence on its face imposes one of the
most severe punishments available upon a recidivist whosubsequently engaged in one of the less serious forms of

criminal conduct. See infra, at 44-45. I do not deny theseriousness of shoplifting, which an

amicus curiae tells us
costs retailers in the range of $30 billion annually. Brief for
California District Attorneys Association as Amicus Curiae
27. But consider that conduct in terms of the factors that
this Court mentioned in Solem--the "harm caused or threatened to the victim or society," the "absolute magnitude of
the crime," and the offender's "culpability." 463 U. S., at
292-293. In respect to all three criteria, the sentencetriggering behavior here ranks well toward the bottom of
the criminal conduct scale.

The Solicitor General has urged us to consider three other
criteria: the "frequency" of the crime's commission, the "ease
or difficulty of detection," and "the degree to which the
crime may be deterred by differing amounts of punishment."
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24-25. When
considered in terms of these criteria--or at least the latter
two--the triggering conduct also ranks toward the bottom
of the scale. Unlike, say, drug crimes, shoplifting often
takes place in stores open to other customers whose presence, along with that of store employees or cameras, can help
to detect the crime. Nor is there evidence presented here
that the law enforcement community believes lengthy prison
terms necessary adequately to deter shoplifting. To the
contrary, well-publicized instances of shoplifting suggest that
the offense is often punished without any prison sentence at
all. On the other hand, shoplifting is a frequently com538US1 Unit: $U28 [10-26-04 16:31:52] PAGES PGT: OPIN

41Cite as: 538 U. S. 11 (2003)
Breyer, J., dissenting
mitted crime; but "frequency," standing alone, cannot makea critical difference. Otherwise traffic offenses would warrant even more serious punishment.This case, of course, involves shoplifting engaged in by a
recidivist. One might argue that any crime committed by arecidivist is a serious crime potentially warranting a 25-year
sentence. But this Court rejected that view in Solem, and
in Harmelin, with the recognition that "no penalty is per seconstitutional."

Solem, supra, at 290; Harmelin, 501 U. S.,
at 1001 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring injudgment). Our cases make clear that, in cases involving

recidivist offenders, we must focus upon "the [offense] that
triggers the life sentence," with recidivism playing a "relevant," but not necessarily determinative, role. Solem,
supra, at 296, n. 21; see Witte v. United States, 515 U. S. 389,
402, 403 (1995) (the recidivist defendant is "punished only
for the offense of conviction," which " `is considered to be
an aggravated offense because a repetitive one' " (quoting
Gryger v. Burke, 334 U. S. 728, 732 (1948))). And here,
as I have said, that offense is among the less serious, while
the punishment is among the most serious. Cf. Rummel,
445 U. S., at 288 (Powell, J., dissenting) (overtime parking
violation cannot trigger a life sentence even for a serious
recidivist).

Third, some objective evidence suggests that many experienced judges would consider Ewing's sentence disproportionately harsh. The United States Sentencing Commission
(having based the federal Sentencing Guidelines primarily
upon its review of how judges had actually sentenced offenders) does not include shoplifting (or similar theft-related offenses) among the crimes that might trigger especially long
sentences for recidivists, see USSG $ 4B1.1 (Nov. 2002)
(Guideline for sentencing "career offenders"); id., ch. 1, pt.
A, intro., n. 5 (sentences based in part upon Commission's
review of "summary reports of some 40,000 convictions [and]
a sample of 10,000 augmented presentence reports"); see also

Breyer, J., dissenting
infra, at 45, nor did Congress include such offenses amongtriggering crimes when it sought sentences "at or near

the statutory maximum" for certain recidivists, S. Rep.No. 98-225, p. 175 (1983); 28 U. S. C. $ 994(h) (requiring sentence "at or near the maximum" where triggering crime iscrime of "violence" or drug related); 18 U. S. C. $ 3559(c)
(grand theft not among triggering or "strike" offenses underfederal "three strikes" law); see

infra, at 45-46. But see 28U. S. C. $ 994(i)(1) (requiring "a substantial term of imprisonment" for those who have "a history of two or more prior . . .felony convictions").

Taken together, these three circumstances make clear thatEwing's "gross disproportionality" argument is a strong one.
That being so, his claim must pass the "threshold" test. Ifit did not, what would be the function of the test? A threshold test must permit arguably unconstitutional sentences,not only actually unconstitutional sentences, to pass the
threshold--at least where the arguments for unconstitution-ality are unusually strong ones. A threshold test that
blocked every ultimately invalid constitutional claim--evenstrong ones--would not be a

threshold test but a determina-tive test. And, it would be a determinative test that failed

to take account of highly pertinent sentencing information,namely, comparison with other sentences, Solem, supra, at
291-292, 298-300. Sentencing comparisons are particularlyimportant because they provide proportionality review with
objective content. By way of contrast, a threshold testmakes the assessment of constitutionality highly subjective.
And, of course, so to transform that threshold test wouldviolate this Court's earlier precedent. See 463 U. S., at 290,
291-292; Harmelin, supra, at 1000, 1005 (Kennedy, J., con-curring in part and concurring in judgment).

III
Believing Ewing's argument a strong one, sufficient topass the threshold, I turn to the comparative analysis. A

Breyer, J., dissenting
comparison of Ewing's sentence with other sentences re-quires answers to two questions. First, how would other

jurisdictions (or California at other times, i. e., without thethree strikes penalty) punish the

same offense conduct?
Second, upon what other conduct would other jurisdictions(or California) impose the

same prison term? Moreover,
since hypothetical punishment is beside the point, the relevant prison time, for comparative purposes, is real prisontime,

i. e., the time that an offender must actually serve.
Sentencing statutes often shed little light upon real prisontime. That is because sentencing laws normally set

maximum sentences, giving the sentencing judge discretion to
choose an actual sentence within a broad range, and because
many States provide good-time credits and parole, often permitting release after, say, one-third of the sentence has been
served, see, e. g., Alaska Stat. $ 33.20.010(a) (2000); Conn.
Gen. Stat. $ 18-7a (1998). Thus, the statutory maximum is
rarely the sentence imposed, and the sentence imposed is
rarely the sentence that is served. For the most part, the
parties' briefs discuss sentencing statutes. Nonetheless,
that discussion, along with other readily available information, validates my initial belief that Ewing's sentence, comparatively speaking, is extreme.

As to California itself, we know the following: First, between the end of World War II and 1994 (when California
enacted the three strikes law, ante, at 15), no one like Ewing
could have served more than 10 years in prison. We know
that for certain because the maximum sentence for Ewing's
crime of conviction, grand theft, was for most of that period
10 years. Cal. Penal Code Ann. $$ 484, 489 (West 1970); see

of the three strikes penalty), a Ewing-type offender wouldhave received a maximum sentence of four years. Cal.

Penal Code Ann. $ 489 (West 1999), $ 667.5(b) (West Supp.2002). And we know that California's "habitual offender"
laws did not apply to grand theft. $$ 644(a), (b) (West 1970)(repealed 1977). We also know that the time that any offender actually served was likely far less than 10 years.
This is because statistical data show that the median timeactually served for grand theft (other than auto theft) was

about two years, and 90 percent of all those convicted of thatcrime served less than three or four years. Historical Data
for Time Served by California Felons 11 (Table 10).

Second, statistics suggest that recidivists of all sorts convicted during that same time period in California served a
small fraction of Ewing's real-time sentence. On average,
recidivists served three to four additional (recidivist-related)
years in prison, with 90 percent serving less than an additional real seven to eight years. Id., at 22 (Table 21).

Third, we know that California has reserved, and still reserves, Ewing-type prison time, i. e., at least 25 real years in
prison, for criminals convicted of crimes far worse than was
Ewing's. Statistics for the years 1945 to 1981, for example,
indicate that typical (nonrecidivist) male first-degree murderers served between 10 and 15 real years in prison, with
90 percent of all such murderers serving less than 20 real
years. Id., at 3 (Table 2). Moreover, California, which has
moved toward a real-time sentencing system (where the
statutory punishment approximates the time served), still
punishes far less harshly those who have engaged in far more
serious conduct. It imposes, for example, upon nonrecidivists guilty of arson causing great bodily injury a maximum
sentence of nine years in prison, Cal. Penal Code Ann.

$ 451(a) (West 1999) (prison term of 5, 7, or 9 years for arson
that causes great bodily injury); it imposes upon those guilty
of voluntary manslaughter a maximum sentence of 11 years,

$ 193 (prison term of 3, 6, or 11 years for voluntary man538US1 Unit: $U28 [10-26-04 16:31:52] PAGES PGT: OPIN

slaughter). It reserves the sentence that it here imposesupon (former-burglar-now-golf-club-thief) Ewing for nonrecidivist, first-degree murderers. See $ 190(a) (West Supp.2003) (sentence of 25 years to life for first-degree murder).

As to other jurisdictions, we know the following: TheUnited States, bound by the federal Sentencing Guidelines,
would impose upon a recidivist, such as Ewing, a sentence
that, in any ordinary case, would not exceed 18 months inprison. USSG $ 2B1.1(a) (Nov. 1999) (assuming a base offense level of 6, a criminal history of VI, and no mitigating oraggravating adjustments);

id., ch. 5, pt. A, Sentencing Table.
The Guidelines, based in part upon a study of some 40,000
actual federal sentences, see supra, at 37, 41, reserve a
Ewing-type sentence for Ewing-type recidivists who currently commit such crimes as murder, $ 2A1.2; air piracy,

$ 2A5.1; robbery (involving the discharge of a firearm, serious bodily injury, and about $1 million), $ 2B3.1; drug offenses involving more than, for example, 20 pounds of heroin,

$ 2D1.1; aggravated theft of more than $100 million, $ 2B1.1;
and other similar offenses. The Guidelines reserve 10 years
of real prison time (with good time)--less than 40 percent of
Ewing's sentence--for Ewing-type recidivists who go on to
commit, for instance, voluntary manslaughter, $ 2A1.3; aggravated assault with a firearm (causing serious bodily injury and motivated by money), $ 2A2.2; kidnaping, $ 2A4.1;
residential burglary involving more than $5 million, $ 2B2.1;
drug offenses involving at least one pound of cocaine, $ 2D1.1;
and other similar offenses. Ewing also would not have
been subject to the federal "three strikes" law, 18 U. S. C.

$ 3559(c), for which grand theft is not a triggering offense.

With three exceptions, see infra, at 46-47, we do not
have before us information about actual time served by
Ewing-type offenders in other States. We do know, however, that the law would make it legally impossible for a
Ewing-type offender to serve more than 10 years in prison in
33 jurisdictions, as well as the federal courts, see Appendix,

Part A, infra, more than 15 years in 4 other States, see Ap-pendix, Part B,

infra, and more than 20 years in 4 additional
States, see Appendix, Part C, infra. In nine other States,the law

might make it legally possible to impose a sentence
of 25 years or more, see Appendix, Part D, infra--thoughthat fact by itself, of course, does not mean that judges have

actually done so. But see infra this page. I say "might"
because the law in five of the nine last mentioned Statesrestricts the sentencing judge's ability to impose a term so

long that, with parole, it would amount to at least 25 yearsof actual imprisonment. See Appendix, Part D,

infra.
We also know that California, the United States, and other
States supporting California in this case, despite every incentive to find someone else like Ewing who will have to
serve, or who has actually served, a real prison term anywhere approaching that imposed upon Ewing, have come up
with precisely three examples. Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 28-29, n. 13. The Government points to
Ex parte Howington, 622 So. 2d 896 (Ala. 1993), where an
Alabama court sentenced an offender with three prior burglary convictions and two prior grand theft convictions to
"life" for the theft of a tractor-trailer. The Government also
points to State v. Heftel, 513 N. W. 2d 397 (S. D. 1994), where
a South Dakota court sentenced an offender with seven prior
felony convictions to 50 years' imprisonment for theft. And
the Government cites Sims v. State, 107 Nev. 438, 814 P. 2d
63 (1991), where a Nevada court sentenced a defendant with
three prior felony convictions (including armed robbery) and
nine misdemeanor convictions to life without parole for the
theft of a purse and wallet containing $476.

The first of these cases, Howington, is beside the point,
for the offender was eligible for parole after 10 years (as in
Rummel), not 25 years (as here). Ala. Code $ 15-22-28(e)
(West 1982). The second case, Heftel, is factually on point,
but it is not legally on point, for the South Dakota courts did
not consider the constitutionality of the sentence. 513 N. W.

2d, at 401. The third case, Sims, is on point both factually
and legally, for the Nevada Supreme Court (by a vote of

3 to 2) found the sentence constitutional. I concede that
example--a single instance of a similar sentence imposed
outside the context of California's three strikes law, out of
a prison population now approaching two million individuals. U. S. Dept. of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Prison Statistics (Jan. 8, 2003),
http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/ bjs/prisons.htm (available in Clerk
of Court's case file).

The upshot is that comparison of other sentencing practices, both in other jurisdictions and in California at other
times (or in respect to other crimes), validates what an initial
threshold examination suggested. Given the information
available, given the state and federal parties' ability to provide additional contrary data, and given their failure to do so,
we can assume for constitutional purposes that the following
statement is true: Outside the California three strikes context, Ewing's recidivist sentence is virtually unique in its
harshness for his offense of conviction, and by a considerable degree.

IV

This is not the end of the matter. California sentenced
Ewing pursuant to its "three strikes" law. That law represents a deliberate effort to provide stricter punishments for
recidivists. Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 667(b) (West 1999) ("It
is the intent of the Legislature . . . to ensure longer prison
sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a
felony and have been previously convicted of serious and/or
violent felony offenses"); ante, at 24. And, it is important
to consider whether special criminal justice concerns related
to California's three strikes policy might justify including
Ewing's theft within the class of triggering criminal conduct
(thereby imposing a severe punishment), even if Ewing's
sentence would otherwise seem disproportionately harsh.

48 EWING v. CALIFORNIA

Breyer, J., dissenting
Cf. Harmelin, 501 U. S., at 998-999, 1001 (noting "the pri-macy of the legislature" in making sentencing policy).

I can find no such special criminal justice concerns thatmight justify this sentence. The most obvious potential justification for bringing Ewing's theft within the ambit of thestatute is administrative. California must draw some kind
of workable line between conduct that will trigger, and conduct that will not trigger, a "three strikes" sentence. "Butthe fact that a line has to be drawn somewhere does not

justify its being drawn anywhere." Pearce v. Commissioner, 315 U. S. 543, 558 (1942) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).
The statute's administrative objective would seem to be one
of separating more serious, from less serious, triggering
criminal conduct. Yet the statute does not do that job particularly well.

The administrative line that the statute draws separates
"felonies" from "misdemeanors." See Brief for Respondent
6 ("The California statute relies, fundamentally, on traditional classifications of certain crimes as felonies"). Those
words suggest a graduated difference in degree. But an examination of how California applies these labels in practice
to criminal conduct suggests that the offenses do not necessarily reflect those differences. See United States v. Watson, 423 U. S. 411, 438-441 (1976) (Marshall, J., dissenting)
(felony/misdemeanor distinction often reflects history, not
logic); Rummel, 445 U. S., at 284 ("The most casual review
of the various criminal justice systems now in force in the
50 States of the Union shows that the line dividing felony
theft from petty larceny, a line usually based on the value
of the property taken, varies markedly from one State to
another"). Indeed, California uses those words in a way unrelated to the seriousness of offense conduct in a set of criminal statutes called " `wobblers,' " see ante, at 16, one of which
is at issue in this case.

Most "wobbler" statutes classify the same criminal conduct either as a felony or as a misdemeanor, depending upon

ante, at 16-17, which in turn depends primarily upon whether "the rehabilitation of the con-victed defendant" either does or does not "require" (or would

or would not "be adversely affected by") "incarceration in astate prison as a felon."

In re Anderson, 69 Cal. 2d 613,
664-665, 447 P. 2d 117, 152 (1968) (Tobriner, J., concurring in
part and dissenting in part); ante, at 29. In such cases, thefelony/misdemeanor classification turns primarily upon the

nature of the offender, not the comparative seriousness ofthe offender's conduct.

A subset of "wobbler" statutes, including the "petty theft
with a prior" statute, Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 666 (West Supp.
2002), defining the crime in the companion case, Lockyer v.

misdemeanor conduct, see Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 490 (West
1999), as a felony only when the offender has previously committed a property crime. Again, the distinction turns upon
characteristics of the offender, not the specific offense conduct at issue.

The result of importing this kind of distinction into California's three strikes statute is a series of anomalies. One
anomaly concerns the seriousness of the triggering behavior. "Wobbler" statutes cover a wide variety of criminal behavior, ranging from assault with a deadly weapon, $ 245,
vehicular manslaughter, $ 193(c)(1), and money laundering,

$ 186.10(a), to the defacement of property with graffiti,

$ 594(b)(2)(A) (West Supp. 2002), or stealing more than $100
worth of chickens, nuts, or avocados, $ 487(b)(1)(A) (West
Supp. 2003); $ 489 (West 1999). Some of this behavior is obviously less serious, even if engaged in twice, than other
criminal conduct that California statutes classify as pure
misdemeanors, such as reckless driving, Cal. Veh. Code Ann.

$ 23103 (West Supp. 2003); $ 23104(a) (West 2000) (reckless
driving causing bodily injury), the use of force or threat of
force to interfere with another's civil rights, Cal. Penal Code

Breyer, J., dissenting
Ann. $ 422.6 (West 1999), selling poisoned alcohol, $ 347b,child neglect, $ 270, and manufacturing or selling false government documents with the intent to conceal true citizen-ship, $ 112(a) (West Supp. 2002).

Another anomaly concerns temporal order. An offenderwhose triggering crime is his third crime likely will

not fall
within the ambit of the three strikes statute provided that
(a) his first crime was chicken theft worth more than $100,and (b) he subsequently graduated to more serious crimes,

say, crimes of violence. That is because such chicken theft,when a first offense, will likely be considered a misdemeanor.
A similar offender likely will fall within the scope of the
three strikes statute, however, if such chicken theft was his
third crime. That is because such chicken theft, as a third
offense, will likely be treated as a felony.

A further anomaly concerns the offender's criminal record.
California's "wobbler" "petty theft with a prior" statute, at
issue in Lockyer v. Andrade, post, p. 63, classifies a petty
theft as a "felony" if, but only if, the offender has a prior
record that includes at least one conviction for certain theftrelated offenses. Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 666 (West Supp.
2002). Thus a violent criminal who has committed two violent offenses and then steals $200 will not fall within the
ambit of the three strikes statute, for his prior record reveals
no similar property crimes. A similar offender will fall
within the scope of the three strikes statute, however, if that
offender, instead of having committed two previous violent
crimes, has committed one previous violent crime and one
previous petty theft. (Ewing's conduct would have brought
him within the realm of the petty theft statute prior to 1976
but for inflation.)

At the same time, it is difficult to find any strong need to
define the lower boundary as the State has done. The three
strikes statute itself, when defining prior "strikes," simply
lists the kinds of serious criminal conduct that falls within
the definition of a "strike." $ 667.5(c) (listing "violent" felon538US1 Unit: $U28 [10-26-04 16:31:52] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
ies); $ 1192.7(c) (West Supp. 2003) (listing "serious" felonies).There is no obvious reason why the statute could not enumerate, consistent with its purposes, the relevant triggeringcrimes. Given that possibility and given the anomalies that
result from California's chosen approach, I do not see howCalifornia can justify on

administrative grounds a sentence
as seriously disproportionate as Ewing's. See Parts II and
III, supra.Neither do I see any other way in which inclusion of

Ewing's conduct (as a "triggering crime") would further asignificant criminal justice objective. One might argue that
those who commit several property crimes should receive
long terms of imprisonment in order to "incapacitate" them,
i. e., to prevent them from committing further crimes in the
future. But that is not the object of this particular three
strikes statute. Rather, as the plurality says, California
seeks " `to reduce serious and violent crime.' " Ante, at
24 (quoting Ardaiz, California's Three Strikes Law: History,
Expectations, Consequences, 32 McGeorge L. Rev. 1 (2000)
(emphasis added)). The statute's definitions of both kinds of
crime include crimes against the person, crimes that create
danger of physical harm, and drug crimes. See, e. g., Cal.
Penal Code Ann. $ 667.5(c)(1) (West Supp. 2002), $ 1192.7(c)(1)
(West Supp. 2003) (murder or voluntary manslaughter);

$ 667.5(c)(21) (West Supp. 2002), $ 1192.7(c)(18) (West Supp.
2003) (first-degree burglary); $ 1192.7(c)(24) (selling or giving
or offering to sell or give heroin or cocaine to a minor).
They do not include even serious crimes against property,
such as obtaining large amounts of money, say, through theft,
embezzlement, or fraud. Given the omission of vast categories of property crimes--including grand theft (unarmed)--
from the "strike" definition, one cannot argue, on propertycr ime-rel ated incapaci tation grounds, for inclusi on of
Ewing's crime among the triggers.

Nor do the remaining criminal law objectives seem relevant. No one argues for Ewing's inclusion within the ambit

of the three strikes statute on grounds of "retribution."Cf. Vitiello, Three Strikes: Can We Return to Rationality?

87 J. Crim. L. & C. 395, 427 (1997) (California's three strikeslaw, like other "[h]abitual offender statutes[, is] not retributive" because the term of imprisonment is "imposed withoutregard to the culpability of the offender or [the] degree of
social harm caused by the offender's behavior," and "has lit-tle to do with the gravity of the offens[e]"). For reasons
previously discussed, in terms of "deterrence," Ewing's 25-year term amounts to overkill. See Parts II and III,

supra.And "rehabilitation" is obviously beside the point. The upshot is that, in my view, the State cannot find in its threestrikes law a special criminal justice need sufficient to rescue
a sentence that other relevant considerations indicate isunconstitutional.

V
Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas argue that weshould not review for gross disproportionality a sentence to

a term of years. Ante, at 31 (Scalia, J., concurring in judg-ment);

ante, at 32 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).Otherwise, we make it too difficult for legislators and sentencing judges to determine just when their sentencing lawsand practices pass constitutional muster.

I concede that a bright-line rule would give legislators andsentencing judges more guidance. But application of the
Eighth Amendment to a sentence of a term of years requiresa case-by-case approach. And, in my view, like that of the
plurality, meaningful enforcement of the Eighth Amend-ment demands that application--even if only at sentencing's
outer bounds.A case-by-case approach can nonetheless offer guidance
through example. Ewing's sentence is, at a minimum, 2 to3 times the length of sentences that other jurisdictions would
impose in similar circumstances. That sentence itself is suf-ficiently long to require a typical offender to spend virtually
all the remainder of his active life in prison. These and the

other factors that I have discussed, along with the questionsthat I have asked along the way, should help to identify

"gross disproportionality" in a fairly objective way--at theouter bounds of sentencing.

In sum, even if I accept for present purposes the plurality'sanalytical framework, Ewing's sentence (life imprisonment
with a minimum term of 25 years) is grossly disproportion-ate to the triggering offense conduct--stealing three golf
clubs--Ewing's recidivism notwithstanding.For these reasons, I dissent.

likely not applicable. Idaho has a general rule that " `convictions entered the same day or charged in the same information should count as a single conviction for purposes of establishing habitual offender status.' " State v. Harrington, 133
Idaho 563, 565, 990 P. 2d 144, 146 (App. 1999) (quoting State
v. Brandt, 110 Idaho 341, 344, 715 P. 2d 1011, 1014 (App.
1986)). However, "the nature of the convictions in any
given situation must be examined to make certain that [this]
general rule is appropriate." Ibid. In this case, Ewing's
prior felony convictions stemmed from acts committed at the
same apartment complex, and three of the four felonies were
committed within a day of each other; the fourth offense was
committed five weeks earlier. See App. 6; Tr. 45-46 (Information, Case No. NA018343-01 (Cal. Super. Ct.) (available in
Clerk of Court's case file)). A review of Idaho case law suggests that this case is factually distinguishable from cases in
which the Idaho courts have declined to adhere to the general rule. See, e. g., Brandt, supra, at 343, 344, 715 P. 2d, at
1013, 1014 (three separately charged property offenses involving three separate homes and different victims committed "during a two-month period"); State v. Mace, 133

In nine other States, the law might make it legally possibleto impose a sentence of 25 years or more upon a Ewing-type

offender. But in five of those nine States,2 the offenderwould be parole-eligible before 25 years:

LOCKYER, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA v.

ANDRADE

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 01-1127. Argued November 5, 2002--Decided March 5, 2003
California charged respondent Andrade with two felony counts of petty

theft with a prior conviction after he stole approximately $150 worth of
videotapes from two different stores. Under California's three strikes
law, any felony can constitute the third strike subjecting a defendant to
a prison term of 25 years to life. The jury found Andrade guilty and
then found that he had three prior convictions that qualified as serious
or violent felonies under the three strikes regime. Because each of his
petty theft convictions thus triggered a separate application of the three
strikes law, the judge sentenced him to two consecutive terms of 25
years to life. In affirming, the California Court of Appeal rejected his
claim that his sentence violated the constitutional prohibition against
cruel and unusual punishment. It found the Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S.
277, proportionality analysis questionable in light of Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957. It then compared the facts in Andrade's case to
those in Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263--in which this Court rejected
a claim that a life sentence was grossly disproportionate to the felonies
that formed the predicate for the sentence, id., at 265--and concluded
that Andrade's sentence was not disproportionate. The California Supreme Court denied discretionary review. The Federal District Court
denied Andrade's subsequent habeas petition, but the Ninth Circuit
granted him a certificate of appealability and reversed. Reviewing the
case under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996
(AEDPA), the latter court held that an unreasonable application of
clearly established federal law under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1) occurs when
there is clear error; concluded that both Solem and Rummel remain
good law and are instructive in applying Harmelin; and found that the
California Court of Appeal's disregard for Solem resulted in an unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court law and was
irreconcilable with Solem, thus constituting clear error.

Held: The Ninth Circuit erred in ruling that the California Court of Appeal's decision was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, this
Court's clearly established law within the meaning of $ 2254(d)(1).

64 LOCKYER v. ANDRADE

Syllabus
(a) AEDPA does not require a federal habeas court to adopt any
one methodology in deciding the only question that matters under

$ 2254(d)(1)--whether a state court decision is contrary to, or involved
an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. In this
case, this Court does not reach the question whether the state court
erred, but focuses solely on whether habeas relief is barred by

$ 2254(d)(1). Pp. 70-71.

(b) This Court must first decide what constitutes such "clearly established" law. Andrade claims that Rummel, Solem, and Harmelin
clearly establish a principle that his sentence is so grossly disproportionate that it violated the Eighth Amendment. Under $ 2254(d)(1),
"clearly established Federal law" is the governing legal principle or
principles set forth by this Court at the time a state court renders
its decision. The difficulty with Andrade's position is that the Court
has not established a clear or consistent path for courts to follow in
determining whether a particular sentence for a term of years can violate the Eighth Amendment. Indeed, the only "clearly established" law
emerging from the Court's jurisprudence in this area is that a gross
disproportionality principle applies to such sentences. Because the
Court's cases lack clarity regarding what factors may indicate gross disproportionality, the principle's precise contours are unclear, applicable
only in the "exceedingly rare" and "extreme" case. Harmelin, supra,
at 1001 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
Pp. 71-73.

(c) The California Court of Appeal's decision was not "contrary to, or
involved an unreasonable application of," the clearly established gross
disproportionality principle. First, a decision is contrary to clearly established precedent if the state court applied a rule that contradicts the
governing law set forth in this Court's cases or confronts facts that
are materially indistinguishable from a Court decision and nevertheless
arrives at a different result. Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 405-
406. Andrade's sentence implicates factors relevant in both Rummel
and Solem. Because Harmelin and Solem specifically stated that they
did not overrule Rummel, it was not contrary to this Court's clearly
established law for the state court to turn to Rummel in deciding
whether the sentence was grossly disproportionate. See Harmelin,
supra, at 998 (Kennedy, J.). Also, the facts here fall in between Solem
and Rummel but are not materially indistinguishable from either.
Thus, the state court did not confront materially indistinguishable facts
yet arrive at a different result. Second, under the "unreasonable application" clause, a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state
court identifies the correct governing legal principle but unreasonably
applies it to the facts of the prisoner's case. Williams v. Taylor, 529

U. S., at 413. The state court decision must be objectively unreasonable, not just incorrect or erroneous. Id., at 409, 410, 412. Here, the
Ninth Circuit erred in defining "objectively unreasonable" to mean
"clear error." While habeas relief can be based on an application of a
governing legal principle to a set of facts different from those of the
case in which the principle was announced, the governing legal principle
here gives legislatures broad discretion to fashion a sentence that fits
within the scope of the proportionality principle--the "precise contours"
of which are "unclear." Harmelin, supra, at 998 (Kennedy, J.). And
it was not objectively unreasonable for the state court to conclude that
these "contours" permitted an affirmance of Andrade's sentence. Cf.,
e. g., Riggs v. California, 525 U. S. 1114, 1115 (Stevens, J., dissenting
from denial of certiorari). Pp. 73-77.

66 LOCKYER v. ANDRADE

Opinion of the Court
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case raises the issue whether the United States Courtof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit erred in ruling that the

California Court of Appeal's decision affirming Leandro An-drade's two consecutive terms of 25 years to life in prison for
a "third strike" conviction is contrary to, or an unreasonableapplication of, clearly established federal law as determined
by this Court within the meaning of 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1).

I
A
On November 4, 1995, Leandro Andrade stole five video-tapes worth $84.70 from a Kmart store in Ontario, California.

Security personnel detained Andrade as he was leaving thestore. On November 18, 1995, Andrade entered a different
Kmart store in Montclair, California, and placed four video-tapes worth $68.84 in the rear waistband of his pants.
Again, security guards apprehended Andrade as he was exit-ing the premises. Police subsequently arrested Andrade for
these crimes.These two incidents were not Andrade's first or only encounters with law enforcement. According to the state pro-bation officer's presentence report, Andrade has been in and
out of state and federal prison since 1982. In January 1982,he was convicted of a misdemeanor theft offense and was
sentenced to 6 days in jail with 12 months' probation. An-drade was arrested again in November 1982 for multiple
counts of first-degree residential burglary. He pleadedguilty to at least three of those counts, and in April of the
following year he was sentenced to 120 months in prison.In 1988, Andrade was convicted in federal court of "[t]ransportation of [m]arijuana," App. 24, and was sentenced toeight years in federal prison. In 1990, he was convicted in
state court for a misdemeanor petty theft offense and wasordered to serve 180 days in jail. In September 1990, Andrade was convicted again in federal court for the same fel538US1 Unit: $U29 [10-28-04 13:20:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ony of "[t]ransportation of [m]arijuana," ibid., and wassentenced to 2,191 days in federal prison. And in 1991,

Andrade was arrested for a state parole violation--escapefrom federal prison. He was paroled from the state penitentiary system in 1993.A state probation officer interviewed Andrade after his
arrest in this case. The presentence report notes:

"The defendant admitted committing the offense. The
defendant further stated he went into the K-Mart Storeto steal videos. He took four of them to sell so he could

buy heroin. He has been a heroin addict since 1977.He says when he gets out of jail or prison he always does
something stupid. He admits his addiction controls his
life and he steals for his habit." Id., at 25.

Because of his 1990 misdemeanor conviction, the Statecharged Andrade in this case with two counts of petty theft

with a prior conviction, in violation of Cal. Penal Code Ann.$ 666 (West Supp. 2002). Under California law, petty theft
with a prior conviction is a so-called "wobbler" offense be-cause it is punishable either as a misdemeanor or as a felony.
Ibid.; cf. Ewing v. California, ante, at 16-17 (plurality opinion). The decision to prosecute petty theft with a prior con-viction as a misdemeanor or as a felony is in the discretion

of the prosecutor. See ante, at 17. The trial court also hasdiscretion to reduce the charge to a misdemeanor at the time
of sentencing. See People v. Superior Court of Los Angeles
Cty. ex rel. Alvarez, 14 Cal. 4th 968, 979, 928 P. 2d 1171,
1177-1178 (1997); see also Ewing v. California, ante, at 17.Under California's three strikes law, any felony can constitute the third strike, and thus can subject a defendant to a
term of 25 years to life in prison. See Cal. Penal Code Ann.

$ 667(e)(2)(A) (West 1999); see also Ewing v. California,
ante, at 16. In this case, the prosecutor decided to charge
the two counts of theft as felonies rather than misdemeanors.
The trial court denied Andrade's motion to reduce the of538US1 Unit: $U29 [10-28-04 13:20:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
68 LOCKYER v. ANDRADE

Opinion of the Court
fenses to misdemeanors, both before the jury verdict andagain in state habeas proceedings.

A jury found Andrade guilty of two counts of petty theftwith a prior conviction. According to California law, a jury
must also find that a defendant has been convicted of at leasttwo serious or violent felonies that serve as qualifying offenses under the three strikes regime. In this case, the jurymade a special finding that Andrade was convicted of three
counts of first-degree residential burglary. A conviction forfirst-degree residential burglary qualifies as a serious or violent felony for the purposes of the three strikes law. Cal.Penal Code Ann. $$ 667.5, 1192.7 (West 1999); see also

Ewingv. California, ante, at 19. As a consequence, each of Andrade's convictions for theft under Cal. Penal Code Ann.$ 666 (West Supp. 2002) triggered a separate application of
the three strikes law. Pursuant to California law, the judgesentenced Andrade to two consecutive terms of 25 years
to life in prison. See $$ 667(c)(6), 667(e)(2)(B). The Statestated at oral argument that under the decision announced
by the Supreme Court of California in People v. Garcia, 20Cal. 4th 490, 976 P. 2d 831 (1999)--a decision that postdates
his conviction and sentence--it remains "available" for An-drade to "file another State habeas corpus petition" arguing
that he should serve only one term of 25 years to life inprison because "sentencing courts have a right to dismiss
strikes on a count-by-count basis." Tr. of Oral Arg. 24.

B
On direct appeal in 1997, the California Court of Appealaffirmed Andrade's sentence of two consecutive terms of 25

years to life in prison. It rejected Andrade's claim that hissentence violates the constitutional prohibition against cruel
and unusual punishment. The court stated that "the pro-portionality analysis" of Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277 (1983),
"is questionable in light of " Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S.957 (1991). App. to Pet. for Cert. 76. The court then ap538US1 Unit: $U29 [10-28-04 13:20:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

plied our decision in Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263 (1980),where we rejected the defendant's claim that a life sentence

was " `grossly disproportionate' to the three felonies thatformed the predicate for his sentence."

Id., at 265. The
California Court of Appeal then examined Andrade's claimin light of the facts in

Rummel: "Comparing [Andrade's]
crimes and criminal history with that of defendant Rummel,
we cannot say the sentence of 50 years to life at issue in thiscase is disproportionate and constitutes cruel and unusual

punishment under the United States Constitution." App. toPet. for Cert. 76-77.

After the Supreme Court of California denied discretionary review, Andrade filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court. The District Court denied
his petition. The Ninth Circuit granted Andrade a certificate of appealability as to his claim that his sentence violated
the Eighth Amendment, and subsequently reversed the
judgment of the District Court. 270 F. 3d 743 (2001).

The Ninth Circuit first noted that it was reviewing Andrade's petition under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death
Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214. Applying its
own precedent, the Ninth Circuit held that an unreasonable
application of clearly established federal law occurs "when
our independent review of the legal question `leaves us with
a "firm conviction" that one answer, the one rejected by the
[state] court, was correct and the other, the application of the
federal law that the [state] court adopted, was erroneous--in
other words that clear error occurred.' " 270 F. 3d, at 753
(alteration in original) (quoting Van Tran v. Lindsey, 212
F. 3d 1143, 1153-1154 (CA9 2000)).

The court then reviewed our three most recent major precedents in this area--Rummel v. Estelle, supra, Solem v.
Helm, supra, and Harmelin v. Michigan, supra. The Ninth
Circuit "follow[ed] the test prescribed by Justice Kennedy

in Harmelin," concluding that "both Rummel and Solem
remain good law and are instructive in Harmelin's applica538US1 Unit: $U29 [10-28-04 13:20:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
70 LOCKYER v. ANDRADE

Opinion of the Court
tion." 270 F. 3d, at 766. It then noted that the California
Court of Appeal compared the facts of Andrade's case to the
facts of Rummel, but not Solem. 270 F. 3d, at 766. The
Ninth Circuit concluded that it should grant the writ of habeas corpus because the state court's "disregard for Solem
results in an unreasonable application of clearly established
Supreme Court law," and "is irreconcilable with . . . Solem,"
thus constituting "clear error." Id., at 766-767.

Judge Sneed dissented in relevant part. He wrote that
"[t]he sentence imposed in this case is not one of the `exceedingly rare' terms of imprisonment prohibited by the Eighth
Amendment's proscription against cruel and unusual punishment." Id., at 767 (quoting Harmelin v. Michigan, supra,
at 1001 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment)). Under his view, the state court decision upholding Andrade's sentence was thus "not an unreasonable
application of clearly established federal law." 270 F. 3d, at
772. We granted certiorari, 535 U. S. 969 (2002), and now
reverse.

II

Andrade's argument in this Court is that two consecutive
terms of 25 years to life for stealing approximately $150 in
videotapes is grossly disproportionate in violation of the
Eighth Amendment. Andrade similarly maintains that the
state court decision affirming his sentence is "contrary to, or
involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established
Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the
United States." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1).

AEDPA circumscribes a federal habeas court's review of
a state court decision. Section 2254 provides:

"(d) An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf
of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a
State court shall not be granted with respect to any
claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court
proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim--

71Cite as: 538 U. S. 63 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
"(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or in-volved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Courtof the United States."

The Ninth Circuit requires federal habeas courts to reviewthe state court decision de novo before applying the AEDPA
standard of review. See, e. g., Van Tran v. Lindsey, supra,at 1154-1155; Clark v. Murphy, 317 F. 3d 1038, 1044, n. 3
(CA9 2003). We disagree with this approach. AEDPAdoes not require a federal habeas court to adopt any one
methodology in deciding the only question that mattersunder $ 2254(d)(1)--whether a state court decision is contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearlyestablished federal law. See Weeks v. Angelone, 528 U. S.
225 (2000). In this case, we do not reach the questionwhether the state court erred and instead focus solely on
whether $ 2254(d) forecloses habeas relief on Andrade'sEighth Amendment claim.

III

A

As a threshold matter here, we first decide what consti-tutes "clearly established Federal law, as determined by the

Supreme Court of the United States." $ 2254(d)(1). An-drade relies upon a series of precedents from this Court--
Rummel v. Estelle, supra, Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S.
277 (1983), and Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957(1991)--that he claims clearly establish a principle that his

sentence is so grossly disproportionate that it violates theEighth Amendment. Section 2254(d)(1)'s "clearly established" phrase "refers to the holdings, as opposed to thedicta, of this Court's decisions as of the time of the relevant
state-court decision." Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 412(2000). In other words, "clearly established Federal law"
under $ 2254(d)(1) is the governing legal principle or principles set forth by the Supreme Court at the time the state

538US1 Unit: $U29 [10-28-04 13:20:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
72 LOCKYER v. ANDRADE

Opinion of the Court
court renders its decision. See id., at 405, 413; Bell v. Cone,
535 U. S. 685, 698 (2002). In most situations, the task of determining what we have clearly established will be straightforward. The difficulty with Andrade's position, however, is
that our precedents in this area have not been a model of
clarity. See Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S., at 965 (opinion of Scalia, J.); id., at 996, 998 (Kennedy, J., concurring in
part and concurring in judgment). Indeed, in determining
whether a particular sentence for a term of years can violate
the Eighth Amendment, we have not established a clear or
consistent path for courts to follow. See Ewing v. California, ante, at 20-23.

B

Through this thicket of Eighth Amendment jurisprudence,
one governing legal principle emerges as "clearly established" under $ 2254(d)(1): A gross disproportionality principle is applicable to sentences for terms of years.

Our cases exhibit a lack of clarity regarding what factors
may indicate gross disproportionality. In Solem (the case
upon which Andrade relies most heavily), we stated: "It is
clear that a 25-year sentence generally is more severe than
a 15-year sentence, but in most cases it would be difficult to
decide that the former violates the Eighth Amendment while
the latter does not." 463 U. S., at 294 (footnote omitted).
And in Harmelin, both Justice Kennedy and Justice
Scalia repeatedly emphasized this lack of clarity: that
"Solem was scarcely the expression of clear . . . constitutional
law," 501 U. S., at 965 (opinion of Scalia, J.), that in "adher[ing] to the narrow proportionality principle . . . our proportionality decisions have not been clear or consistent in all
respects," id., at 996 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and

years," id., at 1001 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), and that the "precise contours" of the

proportionality principle "are unclear," id., at 998 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).Thus, in this case, the only relevant clearly established law

amenable to the "contrary to" or "unreasonable applicationof " framework is the gross disproportionality principle, the
precise contours of which are unclear, applicable only in the"exceedingly rare" and "extreme" case.

Id., at 1001 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (in-ternal quotation marks omitted); see also Solem v. Helm,

supra, at 290; Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S., at 272.

The final question is whether the California Court of Ap-peal's decision affirming Andrade's sentence is "contrary to,

or involved an unreasonable application of," this clearly es-tablished gross disproportionality principle.

First, a state court decision is "contrary to our clearly es-tablished precedent if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in our cases" or "if thestate court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of this Court and neverthelessarrives at a result different from our precedent."

Williamsv. Taylor, supra, at 405-406; see also Bell v. Cone, supra, at

694. In terms of length of sentence and availability of pa-role, severity of the underlying offense, and the impact of
recidivism, Andrade's sentence implicates factors relevant inboth

Rummel and Solem. Because Harmelin and Solemspecifically stated that they did not overrule Rummel, it was

not contrary to our clearly established law for the CaliforniaCourt of Appeal to turn to Rummel in deciding whether a
sentence is grossly disproportionate. See Harmelin, supra,at 998 (

Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring injudgment);

Solem, supra, at 288, n. 13, 303-304, n. 32. In-deed, Harmelin allows a state court to reasonably rely on

Rummel in determining whether a sentence is grossly dis-proportionate. The California Court of Appeal's decision

74 LOCKYER v. ANDRADE

Opinion of the Court
was therefore not "contrary to" the governing legal princi-ples set forth in our cases.

Andrade's sentence also was not materially indistinguish-able from the facts in

Solem. The facts here fall in between
the facts in Rummel and the facts in Solem. Solem in-volved a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of

parole. 463 U. S., at 279. The defendant in Rummel was
sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole. 445U. S., at 267. Here, Andrade retains the possibility of parole. Solem acknowledged that Rummel would apply in a"similar factual situation." 463 U. S., at 304, n. 32. And
while this case resembles to some degree both Rummel and
Solem, it is not materially indistinguishable from either.
Cf. Ewing v. California, ante, at 40 (Breyer, J., dissenting)(recognizing a "twilight zone between

Solem and Rummel").
Consequently, the state court did not "confron[t] a set of factsthat are materially indistinguishable from a decision of this

Court and nevertheless arriv[e] at a result different from our
precedent." Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S., at 406.1

1 Justice Souter argues that the possibility of Andrade's receiving parole in 50 years makes this case similar to the facts in Solem v. Helm, 463
U. S. 277 (1983). Post, at 78-79 (dissenting opinion). Andrade's sentence,
however, is also similar to the facts in Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263
(1980), a case that is also "controlling." Post, at 78. Given the lack of
clarity of our precedents in Solem, Rummel, and Harmelin v. Michigan,
501 U. S. 957 (1991), we cannot say that the state court's affirmance of two
sentences of 25 years to life in prison was contrary to our clearly established precedent. And to the extent that Justice Souter is arguing that
the similarity of Solem to this case entitles Andrade to relief under the
unreasonable application prong of $ 2254(d), we reject his analysis for the
reasons given infra, at 76-77. Moreover, it is not true that Andrade's
"sentence can only be understood as punishment for the total amount he
stole." Post, at 78. To the contrary, California law specifically provides
that each violation of Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 666 (West Supp. 2002) triggers a separate application of the three strikes law, if the different felony
counts are "not arising from the same set of operative facts." $ 667(c)(6)
(West 1999); see also $ 667(e)(2)(B). Here, Andrade was sentenced to two
consecutive terms under California law precisely because the two thefts

Opinion of the Court
Second, "[u]nder the `unreasonable application' clause, afederal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court

identifies the correct governing legal principle from thisCourt's decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to
the facts of the prisoner's case." Id., at 413. The "unrea-sonable application" clause requires the state court decision
to be more than incorrect or erroneous. Id., at 410, 412.
The state court's application of clearly established law mustbe objectively unreasonable.

Id., at 409.
The Ninth Circuit made an initial error in its "unreason-able application" analysis. In

Van Tran v. Lindsey, 212
F. 3d, at 1152-1154, the Ninth Circuit defined "objectivelyunreasonable" to mean "clear error." These two standards,

however, are not the same. The gloss of clear error fails togive proper deference to state courts by conflating error
(even clear error) with unreasonableness. See Williams v.
Taylor, supra, at 410; Bell v. Cone, 535 U. S., at 699.

It is not enough that a federal habeas court, in its
"independent review of the legal question," is left with a
" `firm conviction' " that the state court was " `erroneous.' "
270 F. 3d, at 753 (quoting Van Tran v. Lindsey, supra, at
1153-1154). We have held precisely the opposite: "Under

$ 2254(d)(1)'s `unreasonable application' clause, then, a federal
habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that

of two different Kmart stores occurring two weeks apart were two distinct crimes.

Justice Souter, relying on Robinson v. California, 370 U. S. 660
(1962), also argues that in this case, it is "unrealistic" to think that a sentence of 50 years to life for Andrade is not equivalent to life in prison
without parole. Post, at 79. This argument, however, misses the point.
Based on our precedents, the state court decision was not contrary to,
or an unreasonable application of, our clearly established law. Moreover,
Justice Souter's position would treat a sentence of life without parole
for the 77-year-old person convicted of murder as equivalent to a sentence
of life with the possibility of parole in 10 years for the same person convicted of the same crime. Two different sentences do not become materially indistinguishable based solely upon the age of the persons sentenced.

Opinion of the Court
court concludes in its independent judgment that the rele-vant state-court decision applied clearly established federal

law erroneously or incorrectly." Williams v. Taylor, 529U. S., at 411. Rather, that application must be objectively
unreasonable. Id., at 409; Bell v. Cone, supra, at 699; Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 27 (2002) (per curiam).

Section 2254(d)(1) permits a federal court to grant habeas
relief based on the application of a governing legal principleto a set of facts different from those of the case in which

the principle was announced. See, e. g., Williams v. Taylor,
supra, at 407 (noting that it is "an unreasonable application
of this Court's precedent if the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule from this Court's cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular state prisoner's case"). Here, however, the governing legal principle
gives legislatures broad discretion to fashion a sentence that
fits within the scope of the proportionality principle--the
"precise contours" of which "are unclear." Harmelin v.
Michigan, 501 U. S., at 998 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part
and concurring in judgment). And it was not objectively
unreasonable for the California Court of Appeal to conclude
that these "contours" permitted an affirmance of Andrade's
sentence.

Indeed, since Harmelin, several Members of this Court
have expressed "uncertainty" regarding the application of
the proportionality principle to the California three strikes
law. Riggs v. California, 525 U. S. 1114, 1115 (1999) (Stevens, J., joined by Souter and Ginsburg, JJ., respecting
denial of certiorari) ("[T]here is some uncertainty about how
our cases dealing with the punishment of recidivists should
apply"); see also id., at 1116 ("It is thus unclear how, if at all,
a defendant's criminal record beyond the requisite two prior
`strikes' . . . affects the constitutionality of his sentence");
cf. Durden v. California, 531 U. S. 1184 (2001) (Souter, J.,
joined by Breyer, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari)
(arguing that the Court should hear the three strikes gross

disproportionality issue on direct review because of the "po-tential for disagreement over application of " AEDPA).

2

The gross disproportionality principle reserves a constitu-tional violation for only the extraordinary case. In applying

this principle for $ 2254(d)(1) purposes, it was not an unrea-sonable application of our clearly established law for the California Court of Appeal to affirm Andrade's sentence of twoconsecutive terms of 25 years to life in prison.

V
The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals forthe Ninth Circuit, accordingly, is reversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

The application of the Eighth Amendment prohibitionagainst cruel and unusual punishment to terms of years is

articulated in the "clearly established" principle acknowl-edged by the Court: a sentence grossly disproportionate to
the offense for which it is imposed is unconstitutional. See
ante, at 72-73; Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957 (1991);Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277 (1983); Rummel v. Estelle, 445

U. S. 263 (1980). For the reasons set forth in Justice
Breyer's dissent in Ewing v. California, ante, at 35, whichI joined, Andrade's sentence cannot survive Eighth Amendment review. His criminal history is less grave than Ew-ing's, and yet he received a prison term twice as long for a
less serious triggering offense. To be sure, this is a habeascase and a prohibition couched in terms as general as gross

2 Justice Souter would hold that Andrade's sentence also violates the
unreasonable application prong of $ 2254(d)(1). Post, at 79-82. His reasons, however, do not change the "uncertainty" of the scope of the proportionality principle. We cannot say that the state court decision was an
unreasonable application of this principle.

Souter, J., dissenting
disproportion necessarily leaves state courts with much lee-way under the statutory criterion that conditions federal relief upon finding that a state court unreasonably applied clearlaw, see 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d). This case nonetheless presents
two independent reasons for holding that the disproportion-ality review by the state court was not only erroneous but
unreasonable, entitling Andrade to relief. I respectfully dissent accordingly.The first reason is the holding in

Solem, which happens to
be our most recent effort at proportionality review of recidi-vist sentencing, the authority of which was not left in doubt

by Harmelin, see 501 U. S., at 998. Although Solem is important for its instructions about applying objective proportionality analysis, see 463 U. S., at 290-292, the case is controlling here because it established a benchmark in applying
the general principle. We specifically held that a sentence
of life imprisonment without parole for uttering a $100 "no
account" check was disproportionate to the crime, even
though the defendant had committed six prior nonviolent felonies. In explaining our proportionality review, we contrasted the result with Rummel's on the ground that the life
sentence there had included parole eligibility after 12 years,
Solem, 463 U. S., at 297.

The facts here are on all fours with those of Solem and
point to the same result. Id., at 279-281. Andrade, like the
defendant in Solem, was a repeat offender who committed
theft of fairly trifling value, some $150, and their criminal
records are comparable, including burglary (though Andrade's were residential), with no violent crimes or crimes
against the person. The respective sentences, too, are strikingly alike. Although Andrade's petty thefts occurred on
two separate occasions, his sentence can only be understood
as punishment for the total amount he stole. The two thefts
were separated by only two weeks; they involved the same
victim; they apparently constituted parts of a single, continuing effort to finance drug sales; their seriousness is measured

by the dollar value of the things taken; and the governmentcharged both thefts in a single indictment. Cf. United

States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 3D1.2(Nov. 2002) (grouping temporally separated counts as one offense for sentencing purposes). The state court accordinglyspoke of his punishment collectively as well, carrying a 50-
year minimum before parole eligibility, see App. to Pet. for
Cert. 77 ("[W]e cannot say the sentence of 50 years to life atissue in this case is disproportionate"), and because Andrade

was 37 years old when sentenced, the substantial 50-yearperiod amounts to life without parole.

Solem, supra, at 287
(when considering whether a punishment is cruel or unusual
" `the question cannot be considered in the abstract' " (quoting Robinson v. California, 370 U. S. 660, 667 (1962))); cf.
Rummel, supra, at 280-281 (defendant's eligibility for parole
in 12 years informs a proper assessment of his cruel and
unusual punishment claim). The results under the Eighth
Amendment should therefore be the same in each case. The
only ways to reach a different conclusion are to reject the
practical equivalence of a life sentence without parole and
one with parole eligibility at 87, see ante, at 74 ("Andrade
retains the possibility of parole"), or to discount the continuing authority of Solem's example, as the California court did,
see App. to Pet. for Cert. 76 ("[T]he current validity of the
Solem proportionality analysis is questionable"). The former is unrealistic; an 87-year-old man released after 50 years
behind bars will have no real life left, if he survives to be
released at all. And the latter, disparaging Solem as a point
of reference on Eighth Amendment analysis, is wrong as a
matter of law.

The second reason that relief is required even under the

$ 2254(d) unreasonable application standard rests on the alternative way of looking at Andrade's 50-year sentence as
two separate 25-year applications of the three-strikes law,
and construing the challenge here as going to the second,
consecutive 25-year minimum term triggered by a petty

theft.1 To understand why it is revealing to look at the
sentence this way, it helps to recall the basic difficulty inherent in proportionality review. We require the comparison
of offense and penalty to disclose a truly gross disproportionality before the constitutional limit is passed, in large part
because we believe that legislatures are institutionally
equipped with better judgment than courts in deciding what
penalty is merited by particular behavior. Solem, supra, at
290. In this case, however, a court is substantially aided in
its reviewing function by two determinations made by the
State itself.

The first is the State's adoption of a particular penalogical
theory as its principal reason for shutting a three-strikes defendant away for at least 25 years. Although the State alludes in passing to retribution or deterrence (see Brief for
Petitioner 16, 24; Reply Brief for Petitioner 10), its only serious justification for the 25-year minimum treats the sentence
as a way to incapacitate a given defendant from further
crime; the underlying theory is the need to protect the public
from a danger demonstrated by the prior record of violent
and serious crime. See Brief for Petitioner 17 ("significant
danger to society such that [defendant] must be imprisoned
for no less than twenty-five years to life"); id., at 21 ("statute
carefully tailored to address . . . defendants that pose the
greatest danger"); id., at 23 ("isolating such a defendant
for a substantial period of time"); Reply Brief for Petitioner
11 ("If Andrade's reasoning were accepted, however, California would be precluded from incapacitating him"). See
also Rummel, 445 U. S., at 284 ("purpose of a recidivist

v. Garcia, 20 Cal. 4th 490, 976 P. 2d 831 (1999) (holding trial court may

statute . . . [is] to segregate").2 The State, in other wordshas not chosen 25 to life because of the inherent moral or

social reprehensibility of the triggering offense in isolation;the triggering offense is treated so seriously, rather, because
of its confirmation of the defendant's danger to society and
the need to counter his threat with incapacitation. As to
the length of incapacitation, the State has made a second
helpful determination, that the public risk or danger posed
by someone with the specified predicate record is generally
addressed by incapacitation for 25 years before parole eligibility. Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 667(e)(2)(A)(ii) (West 1999).
The three-strikes law, in sum, responds to a condition of the
defendant shown by his prior felony record, his danger to
society, and it reflects a judgment that 25 years of incapacitation prior to parole eligibility is appropriate when a defendant exhibiting such a condition commits another felony.

Whether or not one accepts the State's choice of penalogical policy as constitutionally sound, that policy cannot rea2 Implicit in the distinction between future dangerousness and repunishment for prior crimes is the notion that the triggering offense must, within
some degree, be substantial enough to bear the weight of the sentence it
elicits. As triggering offenses become increasingly minor and recidivist
sentences grow, the sentences advance toward double jeopardy violations.
When defendants are parking violators or slow readers of borrowed library books, there is not much room for belief, even in light of a past
criminal record, that the State is permanently incapacitating the defendant because of future dangerousness rather than resentencing for past
offenses.

That said, I do not question the legitimacy of repeatedly sentencing a
defendant in light of his criminal record: the Federal Sentencing Guidelines provide a prime example of how a sentencing scheme may take into
account a defendant's criminal history without resentencing a defendant
for past convictions, Witte v. United States, 515 U. S. 389, 403 (1995) (the
triggering offense determines the range of possible sentences, and the past
criminal record affects an enhancement of that sentence). The point is
merely that the triggering offense must reasonably support the weight of
even the harshest possible sentences.

Souter, J., dissenting
sonably justify the imposition of a consecutive 25-year mini-mum for a second minor felony committed soon after the first

triggering offense. Andrade did not somehow become twiceas dangerous to society when he stole the second handful
of videotapes; his dangerousness may justify treating oneminor felony as serious and warranting long incapacitation,
but a second such felony does not disclose greater danger
warranting substantially longer incapacitation. Since thedefendant's condition has not changed between the two

closely related thefts, the incapacitation penalty is not opento the simple arithmetic of multiplying the punishment by
two, without resulting in gross disproportion even under the
State's chosen benchmark. Far from attempting a novel
penal theory to justify doubling the sentence, the California
Court of Appeal offered no comment at all as to the particular penal theory supporting such a punishment. App. to Pet.
for Cert. 76-79. Perhaps even more tellingly, no one could
seriously argue that the second theft of videotapes provided
any basis to think that Andrade would be so dangerous after
25 years, the date on which the consecutive sentence would
begin to run, as to require at least 25 years more. I know
of no jurisdiction that would add 25 years of imprisonment
simply to reflect the fact that the two temporally related
thefts took place on two separate occasions, and I am not
surprised that California has found no such case, not even
under its three-strikes law. Tr. of Oral Arg. 52 (State's
counsel acknowledging "I have no reference to any 50-yearto-life sentences based on two convictions"). In sum, the
argument that repeating a trivial crime justifies doubling a
25-year minimum incapacitation sentence based on a threat
to the public does not raise a seriously debatable point on
which judgments might reasonably differ. The argument
is irrational, and the state court's acceptance of it in response to a facially gross disproportion between triggering
offense and penalty was unreasonable within the meaning
of $ 2254(d).

This is the rare sentence of demonstrable gross dispropor-tionality, as the California Legislature may well have recognized when it specifically provided that a prosecutor maymove to dismiss or strike a prior felony conviction "in the
furtherance of justice." Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 667(f)(2)(West 1999). In this case, the statutory safeguard failed,
and the state court was left to ensure that the EighthAmendment prohibition on grossly disproportionate sentences was met. If Andrade's sentence is not grossly dispro-portionate, the principle has no meaning. The California
court's holding was an unreasonable application of clearly es-tablished precedent.

SMITH et al. v. DOE et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 01-729. Argued November 13, 2002--Decided March 5, 2003
Under the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act (Act), any sex offender

or child kidnaper incarcerated in the State must register with the Department of Corrections within 30 days before his release, providing his
name, address, and other specified information. If the individual is at
liberty, he must register with local law enforcement authorities within
a working day of his conviction or of entering the State. If he was
convicted of a single, nonaggravated sex crime, the offender must provide annual verification of the submitted information for 15 years. If
he was convicted of an aggravated sex offense or of two or more sex
offenses, he must register for life and verify the information quarterly.
The offender's information is forwarded to the Department of Public
Safety, which maintains a central registry of sex offenders. Some of
the data, such as fingerprints, driver's license number, anticipated
change of address, and whether the offender has had medical treatment
afterwards, are kept confidential. The offender's name, aliases, address, photograph, physical description, description, license and identification numbers of motor vehicles, place of employment, date of birth,
crime, date and place of conviction, length and conditions of sentence,
and a statement as to whether the offender is in compliance with the
Act's update requirements or cannot be located are, however, published
on the Internet. Both the Act's registration and notification requirements are retroactive.

Respondents were convicted of aggravated sex offenses. Both were
released from prison and completed rehabilitative programs for sex offenders. Although convicted before the Act's passage, respondents are
covered by it. After the initial registration, they are required to submit quarterly verifications and notify the authorities of any changes.
Both respondents, along with the wife of one of them, also a respondent
here, brought this action under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, seeking to declare the
Act void as to them under, inter alia, the Ex Post Facto Clause, U. S.
Const., Art. I, $ 10, cl. 1. The District Court granted petitioners summary judgment. The Ninth Circuit disagreed in relevant part, holding
that, because its effects were punitive, the Act violates the Ex Post
Facto Clause.

Held: Because the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act is nonpunitive,

its retroactive application does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.
Pp. 92-106.

(a) The determinative question is whether the legislature meant to
establish "civil proceedings." Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346, 361.
If the intention was to impose punishment, that ends the inquiry. If,
however, the intention was to enact a regulatory scheme that is civil
and nonpunitive, the Court must further examine whether the statutory
scheme is so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate the State's
intention to deem it civil. E. g., ibid. Because the Court ordinarily
defers to the legislature's stated intent, ibid., only the clearest
proof will suffice to override that intent and transform what has been
denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty. See, e. g., ibid.
P. 92.

(b) The Alaska Legislature's intent was to create a civil, nonpunitive
regime. The Court first considers the statute's text and structure,
Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U. S. 603, 617, asking whether the legislature
indicated either expressly or impliedly a preference for one label or the
other, Hudson v. United States, 522 U. S. 93, 99. Here, the statutory
text states the legislature's finding that sex offenders pose a high risk
of reoffending, identifies protecting the public from sex offenders as the
law's primary interest, and declares that release of certain information
about sex offenders to public agencies and the public will assist in protecting the public safety. This Court has already determined that an
imposition of restrictive measures on sex offenders adjudged to be dangerous is a legitimate nonpunitive governmental objective. Hendricks,
521 U. S., at 363. Here, as in Hendricks, nothing on the statute's face
suggests that the legislature sought to create anything other than a civil
scheme designed to protect the public from harm. Id., at 361. The
contrary conclusion is not required by the Alaska Constitution's inclusion of the need to protect the public as one of the purposes of criminal
administration. Where a legislative restriction is an incident of the
State's power to protect the public health and safety, it will be considered as evidencing an intent to exercise that regulatory power, and not
a purpose to add to the punishment. E. g., Flemming v. Nestor, supra,
at 616. Other formal attributes of a legislative enactment, such as the
manner of its codification or the enforcement procedures it establishes,
are probative of the legislature's intent, see, e. g., Hendricks, 521 U. S.,
at 361, but are open to debate in this case. The Act's notification provisions are codified in the State's Health, Safety, and Housing Code, confirming the conclusion that the statute was intended as a nonpunitive
regulatory measure. Cf. ibid. The fact that the Act's registration provisions are codified in the State's Code of Criminal Procedure is not

dispositive, since a statute's location and labels do not by themselves
transform a civil remedy into a criminal one. See United States v. One
Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U. S. 354, 364-365, and n. 6. The Code
of Criminal Procedure contains many other provisions that do not involve criminal punishment. The Court's conclusion is not altered by
the fact that the Act's implementing procedural mechanisms require
the trial court to inform the defendant of the Act's requirements and,
if possible, the period of registration required. That conclusion is
strengthened by the fact that, aside from the duty to register, the statute itself mandates no procedures. Instead, it vests the authority to
promulgate implementing regulations with the Department of Public
Safety, an agency charged with enforcing both criminal and civil regulatory laws. Also telling is the fact that the Act does not require the
procedures adopted to contain any safeguards associated with the criminal process. By contemplating distinctly civil procedures, the legislature indicated clearly that it intended a civil, not a criminal, sanction.
United States v. Ursery, 518 U. S. 267, 289. Pp. 92-96.

(c) Respondents cannot show, much less by the clearest proof, that
the Act's effects negate Alaska's intention to establish a civil regulatory
scheme. In analyzing the effects, the Court refers to the seven factors
noted in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 168-169, as a
useful framework. First, the regulatory scheme, in its necessary operation, has not been regarded in the Nation's history and traditions as a
punishment. The fact that sex offender registration and notification
statutes are of fairly recent origin suggests that the Act was not meant
as a punitive measure, or, at least, that it did not involve a traditional
means of punishing. Respondents' argument that the Act, particularly
its notification provisions, resembles shaming punishments of the colonial period is unpersuasive. In contrast to those punishments, the Act's
stigma results not from public display for ridicule and shaming but from
the dissemination of accurate information about a criminal record, most
of which is already public. The fact that Alaska posts offender information on the Internet does not alter this conclusion. Second, the Act
does not subject respondents to an affirmative disability or restraint.
It imposes no physical restraint, and so does not resemble imprisonment, the paradigmatic affirmative disability or restraint. Hudson, 522
U. S., at 104. Moreover, its obligations are less harsh than the sanctions
of occupational debarment, which the Court has held to be nonpunitive.
See, e. g., ibid. Contrary to the Ninth Circuit's assertion, the record
contains no evidence that the Act has led to substantial occupational or
housing disadvantages for former sex offenders that would not have
otherwise occurred. Also unavailing is that court's assertion that the
periodic update requirement imposed an affirmative disability. The

Syllabus
Act, on its face, does not require these updates to be made in person.
The holding that the registration system is parallel to probation or supervised release is rejected because, in contrast to probationers and
supervised releasees, offenders subject to the Act are free to move
where they wish and to live and work as other citizens, with no supervision. While registrants must inform the authorities after they change
their facial features, borrow a car, or seek psychiatric treatment, they
are not required to seek permission to do so. Third, the Act does not
promote the traditional aims of punishment. That it might deter future
crimes is not dispositive. See, e. g., id., at 105. Moreover, the Ninth
Circuit erred in concluding that the Act's registration obligations were
retributive. While the Act does differentiate between individuals convicted of aggravated or multiple offenses and those convicted of a single
nonaggravated offense, these broad categories and the reporting requirement's corresponding length are reasonably related to the danger
of recidivism, and this is consistent with the regulatory objective.
Fourth, the Act has a rational connection to a legitimate nonpunitive
purpose, public safety, which is advanced by alerting the public to the
risk of sex offenders in their community. That the Act may not be
narrowly drawn to accomplish the stated purpose is not dispositive,
since such imprecision does not suggest that the Act's nonpunitive purpose is a "sham or mere pretext." Hendricks, supra, at 371 (Kennedy,
J., concurring). Fifth, the regulatory scheme is not excessive with respect to the Act's purpose. The State's determination to legislate with
respect to convicted sex offenders as a class, rather than require individual determination of their dangerousness, does not render the Act punitive. See, e. g., Hawker v. New York, 170 U. S. 189, 197. Hendricks,
supra, at 357-368, 364, distinguished. Moreover, the wide dissemination of offender information does not render the Act excessive, given
the general mobility of the population. The question here is not
whether the legislature has made the best choice possible to address the
problem it seeks to remedy, but whether the regulatory means chosen
are reasonable in light of the nonpunitive objective. The Act meets
this standard. Finally, the two remaining Mendoza-Martinez factors--
whether the regulation comes into play only on a finding of scienter and
whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime--are of little
weight in this case. Pp. 97-106.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act requires con-victed sex offenders to register with law enforcement authorities, and much of the information is made public. Wemust decide whether the registration requirement is a retroactive punishment prohibited by the Ex Post Facto Clause.

I
A

The State of Alaska enacted the Alaska Sex Offender Reg-istration Act (Act) on May 12, 1994. 1994 Alaska Sess. Laws

ch. 41. Like its counterparts in other States, the Act istermed a "Megan's Law." Megan Kanka was a 7-year-old
New Jersey girl who was sexually assaulted and murderedin 1994 by a neighbor who, unknown to the victim's family,
had prior convictions for sex offenses against children. Thecrime gave impetus to laws for mandatory registration of
sex offenders and corresponding community notification. In1994, Congress passed the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against
Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act,title 17, 108 Stat. 2038, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 14071, which
conditions certain federal law enforcement funding on theStates' adoption of sex offender registration laws and sets

West Virginia, and James E. Doyle of Wisconsin; and for the Council of
State Governments et al. by Richard Ruda and James I. Crowley.

minimum standards for state programs. By 1996, everyState, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Government

had enacted some variation of Megan's Law.The Alaska law, which is our concern in this case, contains
two components: a registration requirement and a notifica-tion system. Both are retroactive. 1994 Alaska Sess. Laws
ch. 41, $ 12(a). The Act requires any "sex offender or child
kidnapper who is physically present in the state" to register,either with the Department of Corrections (if the individual

is incarcerated) or with the local law enforcement authorities(if the individual is at liberty). Alaska Stat. $$ 12.63.010(a),
(b) (2000). Prompt registration is mandated. If still in
prison, a covered sex offender must register within 30 days
before release; otherwise he must do so within a working
day of his conviction or of entering the State. $ 12.63.010(a).
The sex offender must provide his name, aliases, identifying
features, address, place of employment, date of birth, conviction information, driver's license number, information about
vehicles to which he has access, and postconviction treatment
history. $ 12.63.010(b)(1). He must permit the authorities
to photograph and fingerprint him. $ 12.63.010(b)(2).

If the offender was convicted of a single, nonaggravated sex crime, he must provide annual verification of

the submitted information for 15 years. $$ 12.63.010(d)(1),
12.63.020(a)(2). If he was convicted of an aggravated sex
offense or of two or more sex offenses, he must register for
life and verify the information quarterly. $$ 12.63.010(d)(2),
12.63.020(a)(1). The offender must notify his local police department if he moves. $ 12.63.010(c). A sex offender who
knowingly fails to comply with the Act is subject to criminal
prosecution. $$ 11.56.835, 11.56.840.

The information is forwarded to the Alaska Department
of Public Safety, which maintains a central registry of sex
offenders. $ 18.65.087(a). Some of the data, such as fingerprints, driver's license number, anticipated change of
address, and whether the offender has had medical treat538US1 Unit: $U30 [10-26-04 17:14:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ment af terwards, are kept confidential. $$ 12.63.010(b),18.65.087(b). The following information is made available to

the public: "the sex offender's or child kidnapper's name,aliases, address, photograph, physical description, description[,] license [and] identification numbers of motor vehicles,place of employment, date of birth, crime for which convicted, date of conviction, place and court of conviction,length and conditions of sentence, and a statement as to
whether the offender or kidnapper is in compliance with[the update] requirements . . . or cannot be located."

$ 18.65.087(b). The Act does not specify the means by whichthe registry information must be made public. Alaska has
chosen to make most of the nonconfidential information avail-able on the Internet.

Respondents John Doe I and John Doe II were convictedof sexual abuse of a minor, an aggravated sex offense. John

Doe I pleaded nolo contendere after a court determinationthat he had sexually abused his daughter for two years, when
she was between the ages of 9 and 11; John Doe II entereda nolo contendere plea to sexual abuse of a 14-year-old child.
Both were released from prison in 1990 and completed reha-bilitative programs for sex offenders. Although convicted
before the passage of the Act, respondents are covered by it.After the initial registration, they are required to submit
quarterly verifications and notify the authorities of anychanges. Both respondents, along with respondent Jane
Doe, wife of John Doe I, brought an action under Rev. Stat.$ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, seeking to declare the Act void as
to them under the Ex Post Facto Clause of Article I, $ 10,cl. 1, of the Constitution and the Due Process Clause of $ 1
of the Fourteenth Amendment. The United States DistrictCourt for the District of Alaska granted summary judgment
for petitioners. In agreement with the District Court, theCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit determined the state
legislature had intended the Act to be a nonpunitive, civil

Opinion of the Court
regulatory scheme; but, in disagreement with the DistrictCourt, it held the effects of the Act were punitive despite

the legislature's intent. In consequence, it held the Act vio-lates the Ex Post Facto Clause. Doe I v. Otte, 259 F. 3d 979
(2001). We granted certiorari. 534 U. S. 1126 (2002).

II
This is the first time we have considered a claim that a sexoffender registration and notification law constitutes retroactive punishment forbidden by the Ex Post Facto Clause.The framework for our inquiry, however, is well established.
We must "ascertain whether the legislature meant the stat-ute to establish `civil' proceedings." Kansas v. Hendricks,
521 U. S. 346, 361 (1997). If the intention of the legislaturewas to impose punishment, that ends the inquiry. If, however, the intention was to enact a regulatory scheme that iscivil and nonpunitive, we must further examine whether the
statutory scheme is " `so punitive either in purpose or effectas to negate [the State's] intention' to deem it `civil.' " Ibid.
(quoting United States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 248-249(1980)). Because we "ordinarily defer to the legislature's
stated intent," Hendricks, supra, at 361, " `only the clearestproof ' will suffice to override legislative intent and transform
what has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminalpenalty,"

Hudson v. United States, 522 U. S. 93, 100 (1997)(quoting Ward, supra, at 249); see also Hendricks, supra, at

361; United States v. Ursery, 518 U. S. 267, 290 (1996); UnitedStates v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U. S. 354, 365
(1984). A

Whether a statutory scheme is civil or criminal "is first ofall a question of statutory construction." Hendricks, supra,
at 361 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Hudson,supra, at 99. We consider the statute's text and its structure to determine the legislative objective. Flemming v.
Nestor, 363 U. S. 603, 617 (1960). A conclusion that the leg538US1 Unit: $U30 [10-26-04 17:14:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

93Cite as: 538 U. S. 84 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
islature intended to punish would satisfy an ex post factochallenge without further inquiry into its effects, so considerable deference must be accorded to the intent as the legis-lature has stated it.

The courts "must first ask whether the legislature, in es-tablishing the penalizing mechanism, indicated either expressly or impliedly a preference for one label or the other."
Hudson, supra, at 99 (internal quotation marks omitted).Here, the Alaska Legislature expressed the objective of the

law in the statutory text itself. The legislature found that"sex offenders pose a high risk of reoffending," and identified
"protecting the public from sex offenders" as the "primary
governmental interest" of the law. 1994 Alaska Sess. Laws
ch. 41, $ 1. The legislature further determined that "release
of certain information about sex offenders to public agencies
and the general public will assist in protecting the public
safety." Ibid. As we observed in Hendricks, where we
examined an ex post facto challenge to a postincarceration
confinement of sex offenders, an imposition of restrictive
measures on sex offenders adjudged to be dangerous is
"a legitimate nonpunitive governmental objective and has
been historically so regarded." 521 U. S., at 363. In this
case, as in Hendricks, "[n]othing on the face of the statute
suggests that the legislature sought to create anything other
than a civil . . . scheme designed to protect the public from
harm." Id., at 361.

Respondents seek to cast doubt upon the nonpunitive nature of the law's declared objective by pointing out that the
Alaska Constitution lists the need for protecting the public
as one of the purposes of criminal administration. Brief for
Respondents 23 (citing Alaska Const., Art. I, $ 12). As the
Court stated in Flemming v. Nestor, rejecting an ex post
facto challenge to a law terminating benefits to deported
aliens, where a legislative restriction "is an incident of the
State's power to protect the health and safety of its citizens,"
it will be considered "as evidencing an intent to exercise that

94 SMITH v. DOE

Opinion of the Court
regulatory power, and not a purpose to add to the punish-ment." 363 U. S., at 616 (citing

Hawker v. New York, 170
U. S. 189 (1898)). The Court repeated this principle in 89
Firearms, upholding a statute requiring forfeiture of unlicensed firearms against a double jeopardy challenge. TheCourt observed that, in enacting the provision, Congress

" `was concerned with the widespread traffic in firearms and
with their general availability to those whose possessionthereof was contrary to the public interest.' " 465 U. S., at

364 (quoting Huddleston v. United States, 415 U. S. 814, 824(1974)). This goal was "plainly more remedial than punitive." 465 U. S., at 364. These precedents instruct us that
even if the objective of the Act is consistent with the purposes of the Alaska criminal justice system, the State's pursuit of it in a regulatory scheme does not make the objective punitive.

Other formal attributes of a legislative enactment, such as
the manner of its codification or the enforcement procedures
it establishes, are probative of the legislature's intent. See
Hendricks, supra, at 361; Hudson, supra, at 103; 89 Firearms, supra, at 363. In this case these factors are open to
debate. The notification provisions of the Act are codified
in the State's "Health, Safety, and Housing Code," $ 18, confirming our conclusion that the statute was intended as a
nonpunitive regulatory measure. Cf. Hendricks, supra, at
361 (the State's "objective to create a civil proceeding is evidenced by its placement of the Act within the [State's] probate code, instead of the criminal code" (citations omitted)).
The Act's registration provisions, however, are codified in
the State's criminal procedure code, and so might seem to
point in the opposite direction. These factors, though, are
not dispositive. The location and labels of a statutory provision do not by themselves transform a civil remedy into a
criminal one. In 89 Firearms, the Court held a forfeiture
provision to be a civil sanction even though the authorizing
statute was in the criminal code. 465 U. S., at 364-365.

95Cite as: 538 U. S. 84 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
The Court rejected the argument that the placement demon-strated Congress' "intention to create an additional criminal

sanction," observing that "both criminal and civil sanctionsmay be labeled `penalties.' "

Id., at 364, n. 6.
The same rationale applies here. Title 12 of Alaska'sCode of Criminal Procedure (where the Act's registration

provisions are located) contains many provisions that do not
involve criminal punishment, such as civil procedures fordisposing of recovered and seized property, Alaska Stat.

$ 12.36.010 et seq. (2000); laws protecting the confidentialityof victims and witnesses, $ 12.61.010

et seq.; laws governing
the security and accuracy of criminal justice information,

$ 12.62.110 et seq.; laws governing civil postconviction actions, $ 12.72.010 et seq.; and laws governing actions for writs
of habeas corpus, $ 12.75.010 et seq., which under Alaska law
are "independent civil proceeding[s]," State v. Hannagan,
559 P. 2d 1059, 1063 (Alaska 1977). Although some of these
provisions relate to criminal administration, they are not in
themselves punitive. The partial codification of the Act in
the State's criminal procedure code is not sufficient to support a conclusion that the legislative intent was punitive.

The procedural mechanisms to implement the Act do not
alter our conclusi on. Af ter the Act's adoption Alaska
amended its Rules of Criminal Procedure concerning the acceptance of pleas and the entering of criminal judgments.
The rule on pleas now requires the court to "infor[m] the
defendant in writing of the requirements of [the Act] and, if
it can be determined by the court, the period of registration
required." Alaska Rule Crim. Proc. 11(c)(4) (2002). Similarly, the written judgments for sex offenses and child kidnapings "must set out the requirements of [the Act] and, if it
can be determined by the court, whether that conviction will
require the offender or kidnapper to register for life or a
lesser period." Alaska Stat. $ 12.55.148(a) (2000).

The policy to alert convicted offenders to the civil consequences of their criminal conduct does not render the conse538US1 Unit: $U30 [10-26-04 17:14:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
96 SMITH v. DOE

Opinion of the Court
quences themselves punitive. When a State sets up a regulatory scheme, it is logical to provide those persons subject
to it with clear and unambiguous notice of the requirements
and the penalties for noncompliance. The Act requires registration either before the offender's release from confinement or within a day of his conviction (if the offender is not
imprisoned). Timely and adequate notice serves to apprise
individuals of their responsibilities and to ensure compliance
with the regulatory scheme. Notice is important, for the
scheme is enforced by criminal penalties. See $$ 11.56.835,
11.56.840. Although other methods of notification may be
available, it is effective to make it part of the plea colloquy
or the judgment of conviction. Invoking the criminal process in aid of a statutory regime does not render the statutory
scheme itself punitive.

Our conclusion is strengthened by the fact that, aside from
the duty to register, the statute itself mandates no procedures. Instead, it vests the authority to promulgate implementing regulations with the Alaska Department of Public
Safety, $$ 12.63.020(b), 18.65.087(d)--an agency charged with
enforcement of both criminal and civil regulatory laws.
See, e. g., $ 17.30.100 (enforcement of drug laws); $ 18.70.010
(fire protection); $ 28.05.011 (motor vehicles and road safety);

$ 44.41.020 (protection of life and property). The Act itself
does not require the procedures adopted to contain any safeguards associated with the criminal process. That leads us
to infer that the legislature envisioned the Act's implementation to be civil and administrative. By contemplating "distinctly civil procedures," the legislature "indicate[d] clearly
that it intended a civil, not a criminal sanction." Ursery,
518 U. S., at 289 (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original).

We conclude, as did the District Court and the Court of
Appeals, that the intent of the Alaska Legislature was to
create a civil, nonpunitive regime.

Opinion of the Court

B
In analyzing the effects of the Act we refer to the sevenfactors noted in

Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S.144, 168-169 (1963), as a useful framework. These factors,

which migrated into our ex post facto case law from doublejeopardy jurisprudence, have their earlier origins in cases
under the Sixth and Eighth Amendments, as well as the Billof Attainder and the Ex Post Facto Clauses. See id., at
168-169, and nn. 22-28. Because the Mendoza-Martinezfactors are designed to apply in various constitutional contexts, we have said they are "neither exhaustive nor disposi-tive,"

United States v. Ward, 448 U. S., at 249; 89 Firearms,465 U. S., at 365, n. 7, but are "useful guideposts," Hudson,

522 U. S., at 99. The factors most relevant to our analysisare whether, in its necessary operation, the regulatory
scheme: has been regarded in our history and traditions as apunishment; imposes an affirmative disability or restraint;
promotes the traditional aims of punishment; has a rationalconnection to a nonpunitive purpose; or is excessive with respect to this purpose.A historical survey can be useful because a State that decides to punish an individual is likely to select a meansdeemed punitive in our tradition, so that the public will recognize it as such. The Court of Appeals observed that thesex offender registration and notification statutes "are of
fairly recent origin," 259 F. 3d, at 989, which suggests thatthe statute was not meant as a punitive measure, or, at least,
that it did not involve a traditional means of punishing. Re-spondents argue, however, that the Act--and, in particular,
its notification provisions--resemble shaming punishments ofthe colonial period. Brief for Respondents 33-34 (citing A.
Earle, Curious Punishments of Bygone Days 1-2 (1896)).Some colonial punishments indeed were meant to inflict
public disgrace. Humiliated offenders were required "tostand in public with signs cataloguing their offenses."

Opinion of the Court
Incarceration in Early Massachusetts, 80 Mich. L. Rev. 1179,1226 (1982); see also L. Friedman, Crime and Punishment in

American History 38 (1993). At times the labeling would bepermanent: A murderer might be branded with an "M," and
a thief with a "T." R. Semmes, Crime and Punishment inEarly Maryland 35 (1938); see also Massaro, Shame, Culture,
and American Criminal Law, 89 Mich. L. Rev. 1880, 1913
(1991). The aim was to make these offenders suffer "perma-nent stigmas, which in effect cast the person out of the community." Ibid.; see also Friedman, supra, at 40; Hirsch,
supra, at 1228. The most serious offenders were banished,
after which they could neither return to their original community nor, reputation tarnished, be admitted easily into a
new one. T. Blomberg & K. Lucken, American Penology: A
History of Control 30-31 (2000). Respondents contend that
Alaska's compulsory registration and notification resemble
these historical punishments, for they publicize the crime,
associate it with his name, and, with the most serious offenders, do so for life.

Any initial resemblance to early punishments is, however,
misleading. Punishments such as whipping, pillory, and
branding inflicted physical pain and staged a direct confrontation between the offender and the public. Even punishments that lacked the corporal component, such as public
shaming, humiliation, and banishment, involved more than
the dissemination of information. They either held the person up before his fellow citizens for face-to-face shaming or
expelled him from the community. See Earle, supra, at 20,
35-36, 51-52; Massaro, supra, at 1912-1924; Semmes, supra,
at 39-40; Blomberg & Lucken, supra, at 30-31. By contrast, the stigma of Alaska's Megan's Law results not from
public display for ridicule and shaming but from the dissemination of accurate information about a criminal record, most
of which is already public. Our system does not treat dissemination of truthful information in furtherance of a legitimate governmental objective as punishment. On the con538US1 Unit: $U30 [10-26-04 17:14:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

trary, our criminal law tradition insists on public indictment,public trial, and public imposition of sentence. Transparency is essential to maintaining public respect for the crimi-nal justice system, ensuring its integrity, and protecting the
rights of the accused. The publicity may cause adverse con-sequences for the convicted defendant, running from mild
personal embarrassment to social ostracism. In contrast to
the colonial shaming punishments, however, the State doesnot make the publicity and the resulting stigma an integral

part of the objective of the regulatory scheme.The fact that Alaska posts the information on the Internet
does not alter our conclusion. It must be acknowledged that
notice of a criminal conviction subjects the offender to public
shame, the humiliation increasing in proportion to the extent
of the publicity. And the geographic reach of the Internet
is greater than anything which could have been designed in
colonial times. These facts do not render Internet notification punitive. The purpose and the principal effect of notification are to inform the public for its own safety, not to
humiliate the offender. Widespread public access is necessary for the efficacy of the scheme, and the attendant humiliation is but a collateral consequence of a valid regulation.

The State's Web site does not provide the public with
means to shame the offender by, say, posting comments underneath his record. An individual seeking the information
must take the initial step of going to the Department of Public Safety's Web site, proceed to the sex offender registry,
and then look up the desired information. The process is
more analogous to a visit to an official archive of criminal
records than it is to a scheme forcing an offender to appear
in public with some visible badge of past criminality. The
Internet makes the document search more efficient, cost effective, and convenient for Alaska's citizenry.

We next consider whether the Act subjects respondents to
an "affirmative disability or restraint." Mendoza-Martinez,
supra, at 168. Here, we inquire how the effects of the

100 SMITH v. DOE

Opinion of the Court
Act are felt by those subject to it. If the disability or re-straint is minor and indirect, its effects are unlikely to be

punitive.The Act imposes no physical restraint, and so does not
resemble the punishment of imprisonment, which is the para-digmatic affirmative disability or restraint.

Hudson, 522
U. S., at 104. The Act's obligations are less harsh than the
sanctions of occupational debarment, which we have held tobe nonpunitive. See

ibid. (forbidding further participation
in the banking industry); De Veau v. Braisted, 363 U. S. 144(1960) (forbidding work as a union official);

Hawker v. New
York, 170 U. S. 189 (1898) (revocation of a medical license).
The Act does not restrain activities sex offenders may pursue but leaves them free to change jobs or residences.

The Court of Appeals sought to distinguish Hawker and
cases which have followed it on the grounds that the disability at issue there was specific and "narrow," confined to particular professions, whereas "the procedures employed under
the Alaska statute are likely to make [respondents] completely unemployable" because "employers will not want to
risk loss of business when the public learns that they have
hired sex offenders." 259 F. 3d, at 988. This is conjecture.
Landlords and employers could conduct background checks
on the criminal records of prospective employees or tenants
even with the Act not in force. The record in this case contains no evidence that the Act has led to substantial occupational or housing disadvantages for former sex offenders that
would not have otherwise occurred through the use of routine background checks by employers and landlords. The
Court of Appeals identified only one incident from the 7-year
history of Alaska's law where a sex offender suffered community hostility and damage to his business after the information he submitted to the registry became public. Id., at 987-
988. This could have occurred in any event, because the
information about the individual's conviction was already in
the public domain.

Opinion of the Court
Although the public availability of the information mayhave a lasting and painful impact on the convicted sex offender, these consequences flow not from the Act's registra-tion and dissemination provisions, but from the fact of conviction, already a matter of public record. The State makesthe facts underlying the offenses and the resulting convictions accessible so members of the public can take the
precautions they deem necessary before dealing with theregistrant.

The Court of Appeals reasoned that the requirement ofperiodic updates imposed an affirmative disability. In
reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals was under a
misapprehension, albeit one created by the State itself during the argument below, that the offender had to update the
registry in person. Id., at 984, n. 4. The State's representation was erroneous. The Alaska statute, on its face, does
not require these updates to be made in person. And, as
respondents conceded at the oral argument before us, the
record contains no indication that an in-person appearance
requirement has been imposed on any sex offender subject
to the Act. Tr. of Oral Arg. 26-28.

The Court of Appeals held that the registration system is
parallel to probation or supervised release in terms of the
restraint imposed. 259 F. 3d, at 987. This argument has
some force, but, after due consideration, we reject it. Probation and supervised release entail a series of mandatory
conditions and allow the supervising officer to seek the revocation of probation or release in case of infraction. See generally Johnson v. United States, 529 U. S. 694 (2000); Griffin
v. Wisconsin, 483 U. S. 868 (1987). By contrast, offenders
subject to the Alaska statute are free to move where they
wish and to live and work as other citizens, with no supervision. Although registrants must inform the authorities
after they change their facial features (such as growing a
beard), borrow a car, or seek psychiatric treatment, they are
not required to seek permission to do so. A sex offender

Opinion of the Court
who fails to comply with the reporting requirement may besubjected to a criminal prosecution for that failure, but any

prosecution is a proceeding separate from the individual'soriginal offense. Whether other constitutional objections
can be raised to a mandatory reporting requirement, andhow those questions might be resolved, are concerns beyond
the scope of this opinion. It suffices to say the registration
requirements make a valid regulatory program effective anddo not impose punitive restraints in violation of the

Ex Post
Facto Clause.The State concedes that the statute might deter future

crimes. Respondents seize on this proposition to argue that
the law is punitive, because deterrence is one purpose of punishment. Brief for Respondents 37. This proves too much.
Any number of governmental programs might deter crime
without imposing punishment. "To hold that the mere presence of a deterrent purpose renders such sanctions
`criminal' . . . would severely undermine the Government's
ability to engage in effective regulation." Hudson, supra,
at 105; see also Ursery, 518 U. S., at 292; 89 Firearms, 465
U. S., at 364.

The Court of Appeals was incorrect to conclude that the
Act's registration obligations were retributive because "the
length of the reporting requirement appears to be measured
by the extent of the wrongdoing, not by the extent of the risk
posed." 259 F. 3d, at 990. The Act, it is true, differentiates
between individuals convicted of aggravated or multiple offenses and those convicted of a single nonaggravated offense.
Alaska Stat. $ 12.63.020(a)(1) (2000). The broad categories,
however, and the corresponding length of the reporting requirement, are reasonably related to the danger of recidivism, and this is consistent with the regulatory objective.

The Act's rational connection to a nonpunitive purpose is
a "[m]ost significant" factor in our determination that the
statute's effects are not punitive. Ursery, supra, at 290.
As the Court of Appeals acknowledged, the Act has a legit538US1 Unit: $U30 [10-26-04 17:14:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

103Cite as: 538 U. S. 84 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
imate nonpunitive purpose of "public safety, which is ad-vanced by alerting the public to the risk of sex offenders in

their communit[y]." 259 F. 3d, at 991. Respondents con-cede, in turn, that "this alternative purpose is valid, and rational." Brief for Respondents 38. They contend, however,that the Act lacks the necessary regulatory connection because it is not "narrowly drawn to accomplish the stated
purpose." Ibid. A statute is not deemed punitive simplybecause it lacks a close or perfect fit with the nonpunitive

aims it seeks to advance. The imprecision respondents relyupon does not suggest that the Act's nonpunitive purpose
is a "sham or mere pretext." Hendricks, 521 U. S., at 371
(Kennedy, J., concurring).

In concluding the Act was excessive in relation to its regulatory purpose, the Court of Appeals relied in large part on
two propositions: first, that the statute applies to all convicted sex offenders without regard to their future dangerousness; and, second, that it places no limits on the number
of persons who have access to the information. 259 F. 3d,
at 991-992. Neither argument is persuasive.

Alaska could conclude that a conviction for a sex offense
provides evidence of substantial risk of recidivism. The legislature's findings are consistent with grave concerns over
the high rate of recidivism among convicted sex offenders
and their dangerousness as a class. The risk of recidivism
posed by sex offenders is "frightening and high." McKune
v. Lile, 536 U. S. 24, 34 (2002); see also id., at 33 ("When
convicted sex offenders reenter society, they are much more
likely than any other type of offender to be rearrested for a
new rape or sexual assault" (citing U. S. Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Sex Offenses and Offenders 27
(1997); U. S. Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics,
Recidivism of Prisoners Released in 1983, p. 6 (1997))).

The Ex Post Facto Clause does not preclude a State from
making reasonable categorical judgments that conviction of
specified crimes should entail particular regulatory conse538US1 Unit: $U30 [10-26-04 17:14:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
quences. We have upheld against ex post facto challengeslaws imposing regulatory burdens on individuals convicted

of crimes without any corresponding risk assessment. See
De Veau, 363 U. S., at 160; Hawker, 170 U. S., at 197. As
stated in Hawker: "Doubtless, one who has violated the crim-inal law may thereafter reform and become in fact possessed

of a good moral character. But the legislature has power
in cases of this kind to make a rule of universal ap-plication . . . ."

Ibid. The State's determination to legislate
with respect to convicted sex offenders as a class, ratherthan require individual determination of their dangerousness, does not make the statute a punishment under the Ex
Post Facto Clause.

Our decision in Hendricks, on which respondents rely,
Brief for Respondents 39, is not to the contrary. The State's
objective in Hendricks was involuntary (and potentially indefinite) confinement of "particularly dangerous individuals."
521 U. S., at 357-358, 364. The magnitude of the restraint
made individual assessment appropriate. The Act, by contrast, imposes the more minor condition of registration. In
the context of the regulatory scheme the State can dispense
with individual predictions of future dangerousness and
allow the public to assess the risk on the basis of accurate,
nonprivate information about the registrants' convictions
without violating the prohibitions of the Ex Post Facto
Clause.

The duration of the reporting requirements is not excessive. Empirical research on child molesters, for instance,
has shown that, "[c]ontrary to conventional wisdom, most reoffenses do not occur within the first several years after release," but may occur "as late as 20 years following release."
National Institute of Justice, R. Prentky, R. Knight, & A.
Lee, U. S. Dept. of Justice, Child Sexual Molestation: Research Issues 14 (1997).

The Court of Appeals' reliance on the wide dissemination
of the information is also unavailing. The Ninth Circuit

Opinion of the Court
highlighted that the information was available "world-wide"and "[b]roadcas[t]" in an indiscriminate manner. 259 F. 3d,

at 992. As we have explained, however, the notification sys-tem is a passive one: An individual must seek access to the
information. The Web site warns that the use of displayedinformation "to commit a criminal act against another person
is subject to criminal prosecution." http://www.dps.state.
ak.us/nSorcr/asp/ (as visited Jan. 17, 2003) (available in theClerk of Court's case file). Given the general mobility of our

population, for Alaska to make its registry system availableand easily accessible throughout the State was not so excessive a regulatory requirement as to become a punishment.
See D. Schram & C. Milloy, Community Notification: A Study
of Offender Characteristics and Recidivism 13 (1995) (38% of
recidivist sex offenses in the State of Washington took place
in jurisdictions other than where the previous offense was
committed).

The excessiveness inquiry of our ex post facto jurisprudence is not an exercise in determining whether the legislature has made the best choice possible to address the
problem it seeks to remedy. The question is whether the
regulatory means chosen are reasonable in light of the nonpunitive objective. The Act meets this standard.

The two remaining Mendoza-Martinez factors--whether
the regulation comes into play only on a finding of scienter
and whether the behavior to which it applies is already a
crime--are of little weight in this case. The regulatory
scheme applies only to past conduct, which was, and is, a
crime. This is a necessary beginning point, for recidivism
is the statutory concern. The obligations the statute imposes are the responsibility of registration, a duty not predicated upon some present or repeated violation.

Our examination of the Act's effects leads to the determination that respondents cannot show, much less by the clearest proof, that the effects of the law negate Alaska's intention
to establish a civil regulatory scheme. The Act is nonpuni538US1 Unit: $U30 [10-26-04 17:14:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tive, and its retroactive application does not violate the Ex
Post Facto Clause. The judgment of the Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remandedfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Thomas, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion upholding the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act (ASORA) against ex post facto chal-lenge. I write separately, however, to reiterate that "there

is no place for [an implementation-based] challenge" in our
ex post facto jurisprudence. Seling v. Young, 531 U. S. 250,
273 (2001) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). Instead,the determination whether a scheme is criminal or civil must

be limited to the analysis of the obligations actually created
by statute. See id., at 273-274 ("[T]o the extent that theconditions result from the fact that the statute is not being

applied according to its terms, the conditions are not the
effect of the statute, but rather the effect of its improper
implementation"). As we have stated, the categorization of
a proceeding as civil or criminal is accomplished by examining "the statute on its face." Hudson v. United States, 522
U. S. 93, 100 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).

In this case, ASORA does not specify a means of making
registry information available to the public. It states only
that

"[i]nformation about a sex offender . . . that is contained
in the central registry . . . is confidential and not subject
to public disclosure except as to the sex offender's . . .
name, aliases, address, photograph, physical description,

statement as to whether the offender . . . is in compliancewith requirements of AS 12.63 or cannot be located."

Alaska Stat. $ 18.65.087(b) (2000).
By considering whether Internet dissemination rendersASORA punitive, the Court has strayed from the statute.

With this qualification, I concur.

Justice Souter, concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the Court that Alaska's Sex Offender Regis-tration Act does not amount to an ex post facto law. But

the majority comes to that conclusion by a different pathfrom mine, and I concur only in the judgment.

As the Court says, our cases have adopted a two-step en-quiry to see whether a law is punitive for purposes of various
constitutional provisions including the Ex Post Facto Clause.At the first step in applying the so-called

Kennedy-Wardtest, we ask whether the legislature intended a civil or criminal consequence; at the second, we look behind the legisla-ture's preferred classification to the law's substance, focusing
on its purpose and effects. See United States v. Ward, 448U. S. 242, 248-249 (1980); Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372
U. S. 144, 168-169 (1963). We have said that " `only theclearest proof ' " that a law is punitive based on substantial
factors will be able to overcome the legislative categoriza-tion.

Ward, supra, at 249 (quoting Flemming v. Nestor, 363U. S. 603, 617 (1960)). I continue to think, however, that this

heightened burden makes sense only when the evidence oflegislative intent clearly points in the civil direction. See
Hudson v. United States, 522 U. S. 93, 113-114 (1997) (Souter, J., concurring in judgment). This means that for methis is a close case, for I not only agree with the Court that

there is evidence pointing to an intended civil characteriza-tion of the Act, but also see considerable evidence pointing
the other way.The Act does not expressly designate the requirements
imposed as "civil," a fact that itself makes this different from

538US1 Unit: $U30 [10-26-04 17:14:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
108 SMITH v. DOE

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
our past cases, which have relied heavily on the legislature's
stated label in finding a civil intent. See Hudson, supra, at
103; Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346, 361 (1997); Allen v.
Illinois, 478 U. S. 364, 368 (1986). The placement of the Act
in the State's code, another important indicator, see Hendricks, supra, at 361, also leaves matters in the air, for although the section establishing the registry is among the
code's health and safety provisions, which are civil, see
Alaska Stat. $ 18.65.087 (2000), the section requiring registration occurs in the title governing criminal procedure, see

$ 12.63.010. What is more, the legislature made written notification of the requirement a necessary condition of any
guilty plea, see Alaska Rule Crim. Proc. 11(c)(4) (2002), and,
perhaps most significant, it mandated a statement of the requirement as an element of the actual judgment of conviction
for covered sex offenses, see Alaska Stat. $ 12.55.148 (2000);
Alaska Rule Crim. Proc. 32(c) (2002). Finally, looking to enforcement, see Hudson, supra, at 103, offenders are obliged,
at least initially, to register with state and local police, see

$$ 12.63.010(b), (c), although the actual information so obtained is kept by the State's Department of Public Safety, a
regulatory agency, see $ 18.65.087(a). These formal facts do
not force a criminal characterization, but they stand in the
way of asserting that the statute's intended character is
clearly civil.

The substantial indicators relevant at step two of the
Kennedy-Ward analysis likewise point in different directions. To start with purpose, the Act's legislative history
shows it was designed to prevent repeat sex offenses and to
aid the investigation of reported offenses. See 1994 Alaska
Sess. Laws ch. 41, $ 1; Brief for Petitioners 26, n. 13. Ensuring public safety is, of course, a fundamental regulatory goal,
see, e. g., United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 747 (1987),
and this objective should be given serious weight in the analyses. But, at the same time, it would be naive to look no

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
further, given pervasive attitudes toward sex offenders, seeinfra this page and 110, n. See Weaver v. Graham, 450

U. S. 24, 29 (1981) (Ex Post Facto Clause was meant to pre-vent "arbitrary and potentially vindictive legislation"). The
fact that the Act uses past crime as the touchstone, probablysweeping in a significant number of people who pose no real
threat to the community, serves to feed suspicion that some-thing more than regulation of safety is going on; when a legislature uses prior convictions to impose burdens that out-pace the law's stated civil aims, there is room for serious
argument that the ulterior purpose is to revisit past crimes,not prevent future ones. See

Kennedy, supra, at 169.That argument can claim support, too, from the severity

of the burdens imposed. Widespread dissemination of of-fenders' names, photographs, addresses, and criminal history
serves not only to inform the public but also to humiliate andostracize the convicts. It thus bears some resemblance to
shaming punishments that were used earlier in our historyto disable offenders from living normally in the community.
See, e. g., Massaro, Shame, Culture, and American Criminal
Law, 89 Mich. L. Rev. 1880, 1913 (1991). While the Courtaccepts the State's explanation that the Act simply makes

public information available in a new way, ante, at 99, thescheme does much more. Its point, after all, is to send a
message that probably would not otherwise be heard, by se-lecting some conviction information out of its corpus of penal
records and broadcasting it with a warning. Selectionmakes a statement, one that affects common reputation and
sometimes carries harsher consequences, such as exclusionfrom jobs or housing, harassment, and physical harm.*

*I seriously doubt that the Act's requirements are "less harsh than the
sanctions of occupational debarment" that we upheld in Hudson v. United
States, 522 U. S. 93 (1997), De Veau v. Braisted, 363 U. S. 144 (1960), and
Hawker v. New York, 170 U. S. 189 (1898). See ante, at 100. It is true

110 SMITH v. DOE

Opinion of Stevens, J.
To me, the indications of punitive character stated aboveand the civil indications weighed heavily by the Court are in

rough equipoise. Certainly the formal evidence of legisla-tive intent does not justify requiring the " `clearest proof ' "
of penal substance in this case, see Hudson, 522 U. S., at113-114 (

Souter, J., concurring in judgment), and the substantial evidence does not affirmatively show with any clarity that the Act is valid. What tips the scale for me is thepresumption of constitutionality normally accorded a State's

law. That presumption gives the State the benefit of thedoubt in close cases like this one, and on that basis alone I
concur in the Court's judgment.

Justice Stevens, dissenting in No. 01-729 and concurringin the judgment in No. 01-1231.*

These two cases raise questions about statutes that imposeaffirmative obligations on convicted sex offenders. The
question in No. 01-729 is whether the Alaska Sex OffenderRegistration Act is an

ment, but there is significant evidence of onerous practical effects of being
listed on a sex offender registry. See, e. g., Doe v. Pataki, 120 F. 3d 1263,
1279 (CA2 1997) (noting "numerous instances in which sex offenders have
suffered harm in the aftermath of notification--ranging from public shunning, picketing, press vigils, ostracism, loss of employment, and eviction,
to threats of violence, physical attacks, and arson"); E. B. v. Verniero, 119
F. 3d 1077, 1102 (CA3 1997) ("The record documents that registrants and
their families have experienced profound humiliation and isolation as a
result of the reaction of those notified. Employment and employment opportunities have been jeopardized or lost. Housing and housing opportunities have suffered a similar fate. Family and other personal relationships have been destroyed or severely strained. Retribution has been

Opinion of Stevens, J.
it is whether Connecticut's similar law violates the Due Proc-ess Clause.

The Court's opinions in both cases fail to decide whetherthe statutes deprive the registrants of a constitutionally protected interest in liberty. If no liberty interest were impli-cated, it seems clear that neither statute would raise a colorable constitutional claim. Cf. Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S.
215 (1976). Proper analysis of both cases should thereforebegin with a consideration of the impact of the statutes on

the registrants' freedom.The statutes impose significant affirmative obligations and
a severe stigma on every person to whom they apply. In
Alaska, an offender who has served his sentence for a single,
nonaggravated crime must provide local law enforcement authorities with extensive personal information--including his
address, his place of employment, the address of his employer, the license plate number and make and model of any
car to which he has access, a current photo, identifying features, and medical treatment--at least once a year for 15
years. If one has been convicted of an aggravated offense
or more than one offense, he must report this same information at least quarterly for life. Moreover, if he moves, he
has one working day to provide updated information. Registrants may not shave their beards, color their hair, change
their employer, or borrow a car without reporting those
events to the authorities. Much of this registration information is placed on the Internet. In Alaska, the registrant's
face appears on a webpage under the label "Registered Sex
Offender." His physical description, street address, employer address, and conviction information are also displayed
on this page.

The registration and reporting duties imposed on convicted sex offenders are comparable to the duties imposed
on other convicted criminals during periods of supervised
release or parole. And there can be no doubt that the
"[w]idespread public access," ante, at 99 (opinion in No. 01-

538US1 Unit: $U30 [10-26-04 17:14:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
112 SMITH v. DOE

Opinion of Stevens, J.
729), to this personal and constantly updated information hasa severe stigmatizing effect. See Brief for the Office of the

Public Defender for the State of New Jersey et al. as Amici
Curiae 7-21 (providing examples of threats, assaults, loss of
housing, and loss of jobs experienced by sex offenders aftertheir registration information was made widely available).

In my judgment, these statutes unquestionably affect a constitutionally protected interest in liberty. Cf. Wisconsin v.
Constantineau, 400 U. S. 433 (1971).

It is also clear beyond peradventure that these unique con-sequences of conviction of a sex offense are punitive. They

share three characteristics, which in the aggregate are not
present in any civil sanction. The sanctions (1) constitute a
severe deprivation of the offender's liberty, (2) are imposed
on everyone who is convicted of a relevant criminal offense,
and (3) are imposed only on those criminals. Unlike any of
the cases that the Court has cited, a criminal conviction
under these statutes provides both a sufficient and a necessary condition for the sanction.

To be sure, there are cases in which we have held that it
was not punishment and thus not a violation of the Ex Post
Facto Clause to deny future privileges to individuals who
were convicted of crimes. See, e. g., De Veau v. Braisted,
363 U. S. 144 (1960) (upholding prohibition of convicted felons
from working for waterfront unions); Hawker v. New York,
170 U. S. 189 (1898) (upholding prohibition of doctors who
had been convicted of a felony from practicing medicine).
Those cases are distinguishable because in each the prior
conviction was a sufficient condition for the imposition of the
burden, but it was not a necessary one. That is, one may be
barred from participation in a union because he has not paid
fines imposed on him. See NLRB v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg.
Co., 388 U. S. 175, 191-192 (1967). And a doctor may not
be permitted to practice medicine because she is no longer
competent to do so. See, e. g., N. J. Stat. Ann. $ 45:1-21

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Likewise, in Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346 (1997), theCourt held that a law that permitted the civil commitment

of persons who had committed or had been charged with asexually violent offense was not an

ex post facto law. But
the fact that someone had been convicted was not sufficientto authorize civil commitment under Kansas law because

Kansas required another proceeding to determine if such a
person suffered from a " `mental abnormality or personalitydisorder which makes the person likely to engage in the

predatory acts of sexual violence.' " Id., at 352. Nor wasthe conviction even a necessary predicate for the commitment. See ibid. (Kansas' civil commitment procedures also
applied to individuals charged with a sexually violent offense
but found incompetent to stand for trial, or found not guilty
by reason of insanity or by reason of mental disease or defect). While one might disagree in other respects with Hendricks, it is clear that a conviction standing alone did not
make anyone eligible for the burden imposed by that statute.

No matter how often the Court may repeat and manipulate
multifactor tests that have been applied in wholly dissimilar
cases involving only one or two of these three aspects of
these statutory sanctions, it will never persuade me that the
registration and reporting obligations that are imposed on
convicted sex offenders and on no one else as a result of
their convictions are not part of their punishment. In my
opinion, a sanction that (1) is imposed on everyone who commits a criminal offense, (2) is not imposed on anyone else,
and (3) severely impairs a person's liberty is punishment.

It is therefore clear to me that the Constitution prohibits
the addition of these sanctions to the punishment of persons
who were tried and convicted before the legislation was
enacted. As the Court recognizes, "recidivism is the statutory concern" that provides the supposed justification for the
imposition of such retroactive punishment. Ante, at 105
(opinion in No. 01-729). That is the principal rationale that
underlies the "three strikes" statute that the Court has up538US1 Unit: $U30 [10-26-04 17:14:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
114 SMITH v. DOE

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
held in Ewing v. California, ante, p. 11. Reliance on thatrationale here highlights the conclusion that the retroactive

application of these statutes constitutes a flagrant violationof the protections afforded by the Double Jeopardy and
Ex Post Facto Clauses of the Constitution.I think it equally clear, however, that the State may
impose registration duties and may publish registration information as a part of its punishment of this category of de-fendants. Looking to the future, these aspects of their punishment are adequately justified by two of the traditionalaims of punishment--retribution and deterrence. Moreover, as a matter of procedural fairness, Alaska requires itsjudges to include notice of the registration requirements in
judgments imposing sentences on convicted sex offenders
and in the colloquy preceding the acceptance of a plea of
guilty to such an offense. See Alaska Rules Crim. Proc.
11(c)(4) and 32(c) (2002). Thus, I agree with the Court
that these statutes are constitutional as applied to postenactment offenses.

Accordingly, I would hold that the Alaska statute violates
the constitutional prohibition on ex post facto laws. Because I believe registration and publication are a permissible
component of the punishment for this category of crimes,
however, for those convicted of offenses committed after the
effective date of such legislation, there would be no separate
procedural due process violation so long as a defendant is
provided a constitutionally adequate trial. I therefore concur in the Court's disposition of the Connecticut case,
No. 01-1231, and I respectfully dissent from its disposition of
the Alaska case, No. 01-729.

Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Breyer joins,
dissenting.

As Justice Souter carefully explains, it is unclear
whether the Alaska Legislature conceived of the State's Sex
Offender Registration Act as a regulatory measure or as a

penal law. See ante, at 107-109 (opinion concurring in judg-ment). Accordingly, in resolving whether the Act ranks as

penal for ex post facto purposes, I would not demand "theclearest proof " that the statute is in effect criminal rather

than civil. Instead, guided by Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144 (1963), I would neutrally evaluate the
Act's purpose and effects. See id., at 168-169 (listing sevenfactors courts should consider "[a]bsent conclusive evidence
of [legislative] intent as to the penal nature of a statute");cf.

Hudson v. Uni ted Sta tes, 522 U. S. 93, 115 (1997)(
Breyer, J., concurring in judgment) ("[I]n fact if not in the-ory, the Court has simply applied factors of the

Kennedyvariety to the matter at hand.").
1

Measured by the Mendoza-Martinez factors, I would holdAlaska's Act punitive in effect. Beyond doubt, the Act involves an "affirmative disability or restraint." 372 U. S., at168. As

Justice Stevens and Justice Souter spell out,Alaska's Act imposes onerous and intrusive obligations on

convicted sex offenders; and it exposes registrants, throughaggressive public notification of their crimes, to profound humiliation and community-wide ostracism. See ante, at 109,and n. (

Souter, J., concurring in judgment); ante, at 111-112(
Stevens, J., dissenting in No. 01-729 and concurring injudgment in No. 01-1231).

Furthermore, the Act's requirements resemble historicallycommon forms of punishment. See Mendoza-Martinez, 372
U. S., at 168. Its registration and reporting provisions arecomparable to conditions of supervised release or parole; its

1 The Mendoza-Martinez factors include "[w]hether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint, whether it has historically
been regarded as a punishment, whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter, whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of
punishment--retribution and deterrence, whether the behavior to which
it applies is already a crime, whether an alternative [nonpunitive] purpose
to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it, and whether
it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned." 372
U. S., at 168-169.

public notification regimen, which permits placement of theregistrant's face on a webpage under the label "Registered

Sex Offender," calls to mind shaming punishments once usedto mark an offender as someone to be shunned. See

ante,
at 111-112 (Stevens, J., dissenting in No. 01-729 and concur-ring in judgment in No. 01-1231);

ante, at 109 (Souter, J.,
concurring in judgment).

Telling too, as Justice Souter observes, past crimealone, not current dangerousness, is the "touchstone" triggering the Act's obligations. Ibid. (opinion concurring injudgment); see

ante, at 112-113 (Stevens, J., dissenting in
No. 01-729 and concurring in judgment in No. 01-1231).
This touchstone adds to the impression that the Act retributively targets past guilt, i. e., that it "revisit[s] past crimes
[more than it] prevent[s] future ones." Ante, at 109 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment); see Mendoza-Martinez, 372
U. S., at 168.

Tending the other way, I acknowledge, the Court has
ranked some laws civil and nonpunitive although they impose
significant disabilities or restraints. See, e. g., Flemming v.
Nestor, 363 U. S. 603 (1960) (termination of accrued disability
benefits payable to deported resident aliens); Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346 (1997) (civil confinement of mentally ill
sex offenders). The Court has also deemed some laws nonpunitive despite "punitive aspects." See United States v.
Ursery, 518 U. S. 267, 290 (1996).

What ultimately tips the balance for me is the Act's excessiveness in relation to its nonpunitive purpose. See
Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S., at 169. As respondents concede, see Brief for Respondents 38, the Act has a legitimate
civil purpose: to promote public safety by alerting the public
to potentially recidivist sex offenders in the community.
See ante, at 102-103 (majority opinion). But its scope notably exceeds this purpose. The Act applies to all convicted
sex offenders, without regard to their future dangerousness.
And the duration of the reporting requirement is keyed not

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
to any determination of a particular offender's risk of re-offending, but to whether the offense of conviction qualified

as aggravated. The reporting requirements themselves areexorbitant: The Act requires aggravated offenders to engage
in perpetual quarterly reporting, even if their personal infor-mation has not changed. See ante, at 90. And meriting
heaviest weight in my judgment, the Act makes no provisionwhatever for the possibility of rehabilitation: Offenders cannot shorten their registration or notification period, even onthe clearest demonstration of rehabilitation or conclusive
proof of physical incapacitation.2 However plain it may bethat a former sex offender currently poses no threat of recidivism, he will remain subject to long-term monitoring andinescapable humiliation.

John Doe I, for example, pleaded nolo contendere to acharge of sexual abuse of a minor nine years before the
Alaska Act was enacted. He successfully completed a treat-ment program, and gained early release on supervised probation in part because of his compliance with the program'srequirements and his apparent low risk of reoffense. Brief
for Respondents 1. He subsequently remarried, establisheda business, and was reunited with his family. Ibid. He was
also granted custody of a minor daughter, based on a court'sdetermination that he had been successfully rehabilitated.
See Doe I v. Otte, 259 F. 3d 979, 983 (CA9 2001). The court'sdetermination rested in part on psychiatric evaluations concluding that Doe had "a very low risk of re-offending" and is"not a pedophile." Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).
Notwithstanding this strong evidence of rehabilitation, theAlaska Act requires Doe to report personal information to
the State four times per year, and permits the State publicly

COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS v. UNITED STATES

ex rel. CHANDLER

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 01-1572. Argued January 14, 2003--Decided March 10, 2003
Under the False Claims Act (FCA), "[a]ny person" who, inter alia, "knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, to an officer or employee of the
United States Government . . . a false or fraudulent claim for payment or
approval," 31 U. S. C. $ 3729(a)(1), is liable to the Government for a civil
penalty, treble damages, and costs, $ 3729(a). Although the Attorney
General may sue under the FCA, a private person, known as a relator,
may also bring a qui tam action "in the name of the Government."

$ 3730(b). The relator must inform the Justice Department of her intentions and keep the pleadings under seal while the Government decides
whether to intervene and do its own litigating. $ 3730(b)(2). If the
claim succeeds, the relator's share may be up to 30 percent of the proceeds of the action, plus reasonable expenses, costs, and attorney's fees.

$ 3730(d). This case involves a National Institute of Drug Abuse research grant to Cook County Hospital for a study that was later administered by a nonprofit research institute affiliated with the hospital. Respondent Chandler, who ran the study for the institute, filed this qui
tam action, claiming that Cook County (hereinafter County) and the
institute had submitted false statements to obtain grant funds in violation of $ 3729(a)(1). After this Court held in Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S. 765, that States
are not "persons" subject to FCA qui tam actions, the District Court
granted the County's motion to dismiss the claims against it. The court
held that the County, like a State, could not be subjected to treble damages, which Stevens described as "essentially punitive," id., at 784. The
Seventh Circuit distinguished Stevens and reversed.

Held: Local governments are "persons" amenable to qui tam actions

under the FCA. Pp. 125-134.

(a) While $ 3729 does not define the term "person," its meaning has
remained unchanged since the original FCA was passed in 1863. Stevens, supra, at 783, n. 12. There is no doubt that the term then extended to corporations. Indeed, this Court as early as 1826 in United
States v. Amedy, 11 Wheat. 392, 412, recognized the presumption that
"person" also includes "persons politic and incorporate." Essentially
conceding that private corporations were taken to be persons when the

120 COOK COUNTY v. UNITED STATES ex rel. CHANDLER

Syllabus
FCA was passed in 1863, the County argues that municipal corporations
were not so understood until six years later, when the Court decided
Cowles v. Mercer County, 7 Wall. 118. Cowles, however, was not an
extension of principle but a natural recognition of the common understanding that municipal corporations and private ones were to be
treated alike in terms of their legal status as persons capable of suing
and being sued. This explains how the Court in Cowles could conclude
"automatically and without discussion" that municipal corporations, like
private ones, "should be treated as natural persons for virtually all purposes of constitutional and statutory analysis." Monell v. New York
City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 687-688. Of course, the
meaning of "person" recognized in Cowles was only a presumptive one,
but neither the history nor the text of the original FCA provides contextual evidence that Congress intended to exclude municipalities from the
class of "persons" covered by the FCA in 1863. Pp. 125-129.

(b) The False Claims Amendments Act of 1986 did not repeal municipal liability. As part of an effort to modernize the FCA, the 1986
amendments raised the ceiling on damages recoverable under $ 3729(a)
from double to treble. Relying on the common law presumption against
punitive damages for municipalities, see Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc.,
453 U. S. 247, 259-260, and n. 21, and on this Court's statement in Stevens, supra, at 784, 785, that the change from double to treble damages
turned what had been a "remedial" provision into an "essentially punitive" one, the County argues that, even if municipalities were covered
by the term "person" from 1863 to 1986, Congress's adoption of a "punitive" remedy entailed the elimination of municipal liability in 1986. It
does not follow from Stevens, however, that the punitive feature of FCA
damages has the force to show congressional intent to repeal implicitly
the existing definition of "person." To begin with, the FCA's damages
multiplier has a compensatory function as well as a punitive one. Most
obviously, the statute's qui tam feature means that as much as 30 percent of the Government's recovery may go to a private relator who
began the action. Even when there is no qui tam relator to be paid,
liability beyond actual damages may be necessary for full recovery, since
the FCA has no separate provision for prejudgment interest or consequential damages. The force of the treble damages remedy's "punitive"
nature in arguing against municipal liability is not as robust as it would
be if that remedy were a pure penalty in all cases. What is more, treble
damages certainly does not equate with classic punitive damages, which
leaves the jury with open-ended discretion over the amount, and so
raises two concerns specific to municipal defendants: that local government's taxing power will make it an easy target for an unduly generous

Syllabus
jury and that blameless or unknowing taxpayers will be unfairly taxed
for the wrongdoing of local officials. Neither of these concerns is serious in FCA cases. The presumption against punitive damages thus
brings only limited vigor to the County's aid. Working against the
County's position, however, is a different presumption, this one at full
strength: the "cardinal rule . . . that repeals by implication are not favored." Posadas v. National City Bank, 296 U. S. 497, 503. Inferring
repeal of municipal liability from the increase in the damages ceiling
from double to triple would be difficult in the abstract, but it is impossible given that the basic purpose of the 1986 amendments was to make
the FCA a more useful tool against fraud in modern times. Whether
or not this was true in 1863, local governments now often administer or
receive federal funds. It is simply not plausible that Congress intended
to repeal municipal liability sub silentio by the very Act it passed to
strengthen the Government's hand in fighting false claims. Pp. 129-134.

122 COOK COUNTY v. UNITED STATES ex rel. CHANDLER

Opinion of the Court
Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
In Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States
ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S. 765 (2000), we held that States are
not "persons" subject to qui tam actions under the False
Claims Act (FCA), 31 U. S. C. $$ 3729-3733. Here, the question is whether local governments are amenable to such
suits, and we hold that they are.

I
Stevens, supra, at 768-770, explains in some detail how
the FCA currently provides for civil penalties against "[a]ny
person" who (so far as it concerns us here) "knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, to an officer or employee of
the United States Government . . . a false or fraudulent claim
for payment or approval." $ 3729(a)(1). Although the Attorney General may sue under the FCA, so may a private
person, known as a relator, in a qui tam action brought "in
the name of the Government," but with the hope of sharing
in any recovery. $ 3730(b). The relator must inform the
Department of Justice of her intentions and keep the pleadings under seal for 60 days while the Government decides
whether to intervene and do its own litigating. $ 3730(b)(2);
see also $ 3730(c). If the claim succeeds, the defendant is
liable to the Government for a civil penalty between $5,000
and $10,000 for each violation, treble damages (reducible
to double damages for cooperative defendants), and costs.

Opinion of the Court

$ 3729(a).1 The relator's share of the "proceeds of the action
or settlement" may be up to 30 percent, depending on
whether the Government intervened and, if so, how much
the relator contributed to the prosecution of the claim.

$ 3730(d).2 The relator may also get reasonable expenses,
costs, and attorney's fees. Ibid.

The fraud in this case allegedly occurred in administering
a $5 million grant from the National Institute of Drug Abuse
to Cook County Hospital, owned and operated as the name
implies, with the object of studying a treatment regimen for
pregnant drug addicts. The grant was subject to a variety
of conditions, including the terms of a compliance plan meant
to assure that the study would jibe with federal regulations
for research on human subjects. Administration of the
study was later transferred to the Hektoen Institute for
Medical Research, a nonprofit research organization affiliated
with the hospital. Respondent, Dr. Janet Chandler, ran the
study from September 1993 until the institute fired her in
January 1995.

1 The statutory penalties are adjusted upward for inflation under the
Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101-410,

$ 5, 104 Stat. 891, note following 28 U. S. C. $ 2461. The penalty is currently $5,500 to $11,000. 28 CFR $ 85.3(a)(9) (2002).

2 If the Government does not intervene, the relator is entitled to 25 to

30 percent of the proceeds. 31 U. S. C. $ 3730(d)(2). If the Government
chooses to intervene, the relator "shall . . . receive at least 15 percent but
not more than 25 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement of
the claim, depending upon the extent to which the person substantially
contributed to the prosecution of the action." $ 3730(d)(1). If, however,
the court determines that the action was "based primarily on disclosures
of specific information (other than information provided by the person
bringing the action) relating to allegations or transactions in a criminal,
civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from
the news media, the court may award such sums as it considers appropriate, but in no case more than 10 percent of the proceeds . . . ." Ibid.

124 COOK COUNTY v. UNITED STATES ex rel. CHANDLER

Opinion of the Court
In 1997, Chandler filed this qui tam action, claiming thatCook County (hereinafter County) and the institute had submitted false statements to obtain grant funds in violation of$ 3729(a)(1).

3 Chandler said that the defendants had violated the grant's express conditions, had failed to complywith the regulations on human-subject research, and had

submitted false reports of what she called "ghost" researchsubjects. Chandler also alleged that she was fired for reporting the fraud to doctors at the hospital and to the grant-ing agency, rendering her dismissal a violation of both state
law and the whistle-blower provision of the FCA, $ 3730(h).4The Government declined to intervene in the action.

The County moved to dismiss the claims against it, ar-guing, among other things, that it was not a "person" subject
to liability under the FCA.5 The District Court denied themotion, reading the term "person" in the FCA to include
state and local governments. United States ex rel. Chandler v. Hektoen Institute for Medical Research, 35 F. Supp.2d 1078 (ND Ill. 1999). The Court of Appeals dismissed

the County's interlocutory appeal, and we denied certiorari.528 U. S. 931 (1999). After

Stevens came down, however,the District Court reconsidered the County's motion and dismissed Chandler's action. Although the court found "noreason to alter its conclusion that the County is a `person'
for purposes of the FCA," it held that the County, like aState, could not be subjected to treble damages, which Stevens, supra, at 784, described not as "remedial" but as "es-sentially punitive." 118 F. Supp. 2d 902, 903 (2000). The

3 The hospital was originally a defendant as well but was dismissed from
the case as having no identity independent of the County. 277 F. 3d 969,
971, n. 2 (CA7 2002).

4 Chandler's retaliation claims against the County were dismissed because the institute, not the County, was her employer. United States ex
rel. Chandler v. Hektoen Institute for Medical Research, 35 F. Supp. 2d
1078, 1087 (ND Ill. 1999).

5 The institute also moved to dismiss, on different grounds; the denial of

that motion is not before us. 277 F. 3d, at 969, n. 1.

being sued . . ."). While it is true that Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in Bank of United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch61, 86-87 (1809), declined to rely on the presumption when

it decided the separate issue whether a corporation was a"citizen" for purposes of federal diversity jurisdiction, by
1844 the Deveaux position had been abandoned and a corporation was understood to have citizenship independent of its
constituent members by virtue of its status as "a person,
although an artificial person." Louisville, C. & C. R. Co. v.
Letson, 2 How. 497, 558 (1844); see 1 A. Burrill, A Law Dictionary and Glossary 383 (2d ed. 1859) ("A corporation has
been declared to be not only a person, . . . but to be capable
of being considered an inhabitant of a state, and even of
being treated as a citizen, for all purposes of suing and
being sued").

Essentially conceding that private corporations were
taken to be persons when the FCA was passed in 1863, the
County argues that municipal corporations were not so understood until six years later, when Cowles v. Mercer
County, 7 Wall. 118 (1869), applied the Letson rule to them.
Cowles, however, was not an extension of principle but a natural recognition of an understanding going back at least to
Coke, supra, that municipal corporations and private ones
were simply two species of "body politic and corporate,"
treated alike in terms of their legal status as persons capable
of suing and being sued. See, e. g., W. Glover, A Practical
Treatise on the Law of Municipal Corporations 41 (1837)
(Municipal corporations have, as an attribute "necessarily
and inseparably incident to every corporation," the ability
"[t]o sue or be sued, . . . and do all other acts as natural

persons may"); see also 1 J. Dillon, The Law of Municipal
Corporations 92 (rev. 2d ed. 1873). Indeed, "[t]he archetypal
American corporation of the eighteenth century [was] the
municipality"; only in the early 19th century did private corporations become widespread. M. Horwitz, The Transformation of American Law, 1780-1860, p. 112 (1977). This history explains how the Court in Cowles could conclude
"automatically and without discussion" that municipal corporations, like private ones, "should be treated as natural persons for virtually all purposes of constitutional and statutory
analysis." Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs.,
436 U. S. 658, 687-688 (1978); see Cowles, supra, at 121
(describing the question as one that "presents but little
difficulty").7

Of course, the meaning of "person" recognized in Cowles
is the usual one, but not immutable, see Monell, supra, at
688, and the County asks us to take a cue from the qualification included in the later definition in the Dictionary Act,
Act of Feb. 25, 1871, $ 2, 16 Stat. 431, that "the word `person'
may extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate
. . . unless the context shows that [it was] intended to be
used in a more limited sense." Cf. J. Angell & S. Ames, A
Treatise on the Law of Private Corporations Aggregate 4
(rev. 3d ed. 1846) ("The construction is, that when `persons'
are mentioned in a statute, corporations are included if they
fall within the general reason and design of the statute").
The County invokes two points of context that it takes as

7 The County and some of its supporting amici urge a further distinction
between full-fledged municipal corporations such as towns and cities,
which were incorporated at the request of their inhabitants, and "quasi
corporations" such as counties, which were unilateral creations of the
State. See Barnes v. District of Columbia, 91 U. S. 540, 552 (1876).
While the liability of quasi corporations at common law may have differed
from that of municipal corporations, see ibid., both were treated equally
as legal "persons." Indeed, Cowles itself applied to an Illinois county like
Cook County.

Opinion of the Court
indicating that in the FCA Congress intended a more lim-ited meaning.

First, it says that the statutory text is "inherently incon-sistent with local governmental liability," Brief for Petitioner
13, owing to the references of the original enactment to "anyperson in the land or naval forces of the United States" and
"any person not in the military or naval forces of the UnitedStates," together with a provision imposing criminal liability,
including imprisonment, on defendants in the latter category,see Act of Mar. 2, 1863, ch. 67, $$ 1, 3, 12 Stat. 696, 697, 698.

8

But the old text merely shows that "any person in the land ornaval forces" was directed at natural persons. The second

phrase, covering all other "persons," could not have beenthat limited, or even private corporations would be outside
the FCA's coverage, a reading that not even the County es-pouses and one that we seriously doubted in

Stevens, 529U. S., at 782. As for the FCA's reference to criminal liability, "[t]he short answer is that it has not been regarded asanomalous to require compliance by municipalities with the
substantive standards of . . . federal laws which impose [bothcivil and criminal] sanctions upon `persons.' "

Lafayette v.Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U. S. 389, 400 (1978).

Municipalities may not be susceptible to every statutory pen-alty, but that is no reason to exempt them from remedies
that sensibly apply. Id., at 400-401; United States v. UnionSupply Co., 215 U. S. 50, 54-55 (1909).

The other contextual evidence cited by the County is thehistory of the FCA. We recounted in Stevens that Congress's primary concern in 1863 was " `stopping the massivefrauds perpetrated by large [private] contractors during the
Civil War.' " 529 U. S., at 781 (quoting United States v.
Bornstein, 423 U. S. 303, 309 (1976), but adding "[private]").Local governments, the County says, were not players in the

8 The FCA's civil and criminal provisions were bifurcated in 1878, see
Rainwater v. United States, 356 U. S. 590, 592, n. 8 (1958), and the latter
provisions have since been recodified at 18 U. S. C. $ 287.

game of war profiteering that the FCA was meant to stop.Of course, this is true, but in no way does it affect the fact

that Congress wrote expansively, meaning "to reach alltypes of fraud, without qualification, that might result in financial loss to the Government." United States v. Neifert-White Co., 390 U. S. 228, 232 (1968). Whatever municipal
corporations may have been doing in 1863, in 2003 local gov-ernments are commonly at the receiving end of all sorts of
federal funding schemes and thus no less able than individu-als or private corporations to impose on the federal fisc
and exploit the exercise of the federal spending power.Cf.

Monell, supra, at 685-686 (noting that municipalities can,"equally with natural persons, create the harms intended to

be remedied [by 42 U. S. C. $ 1983]"). In sum, neither his-tory nor text points to exclusion of municipalities from the
class of "persons" covered by the FCA in 1863.

III
Nor is the application of this reading of the statute af-fected by the County's alternative position, based on the evolution of the FCA's provisions for relief. The County's argu-ment leads off, at least, with a sound premise about the
historical tension between municipal liability and damagesimposed as punishment. Although it was well established
in 1863 "that a municipality, like a private corporation, wasto be treated as a natural person subject to suit for a wide
range of tortious activity, . . . this understanding did notextend to the award of punitive or exemplary damages,"
Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U. S. 247, 259-260 (1981).Since municipalities' common law resistance to punitive damages still obtains, "[t]he general rule today is that no punitivedamages are allowed unless expressly authorized by statute." Id., at 260, n. 21.The County relies on this general statement in asking us
to infer a remarkable consequence unstated in the 1986amendments to the FCA. As part of an effort to modernize

538US1 Unit: $U31 [10-26-04 20:26:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN
130 COOK COUNTY v. UNITED STATES ex rel. CHANDLER

Opinion of the Court
the FCA, Congress then raised the fine from $2,000 to thecurrent range of $5,000 to $10,000, and raised the ceiling on

damages recoverable under $ 3729(a) from double to treble.False Claims Amendments Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-562, $ 2(7),
100 Stat. 3153. In Stevens, we spoke of this change as turn-ing what had been a "remedial" provision into an "essentially
punitive" one. 529 U. S., at 784, 785. The County relies on
this characterization to argue that, even if municipalitieswere covered by the term "person" from 1863 to 1986, Congress's adoption of a "punitive" remedy entailed the elimina-tion of municipal liability in 1986.

Although we did indeed find the punitive character of the
treble damages provision a reason not to read "person" to
include a State, see id., at 785, it does not follow that the
punitive feature has the force to show congressional intent
to repeal implicitly the existing definition of that word, which
included municipalities. To begin with it is important to realize that treble damages have a compensatory side, serving
remedial purposes in addition to punitive objectives. See,
e. g., Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth,
Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 635-636 (1985) (citing Brunswick Corp.
v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U. S. 477, 485-486 (1977));
American Soc. of Mechanical Engineers, Inc. v. Hydrolevel
Corp., 456 U. S. 556, 575 (1982); see also Agency Holding
Corp. v. Malley-Duff & Associates, Inc., 483 U. S. 143, 151
(1987). While the tipping point between payback and punishment defies general formulation, being dependent on the
workings of a particular statute and the course of particular
litigation, the facts about the FCA show that the damages
multiplier has compensatory traits along with the punitive.

There is no question that some liability beyond the amount
of the fraud is usually "necessary to compensate the Government completely for the costs, delays, and inconveniences occasioned by fraudulent claims." Bornstein, supra, at 315;
see United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435, 445 (1989) (noting that the Government's injury includes "not merely the

538US1 Unit: $U31 [10-26-04 20:26:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
amount of the fraud itself, but also ancillary costs, such asthe costs of detection and investigation, that routinely attend

the Government's efforts to root out deceptive practices di-rected at the public purse"). The most obvious indication
that the treble damages ceiling has a remedial place underthis statute is its

qui tam feature with its possibility of diverting as much as 30 percent of the Government's recovery
to a private relator who began the action. In qui tam casesthe rough difference between double and triple damages may

well serve not to punish, but to quicken the self-interestof some private plaintiff who can spot violations and start
litigating to compensate the Government, while benefitinghimself as well. See

United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess,
317 U. S. 537, 547 (1943). The treble feature thus leaves theremaining double damages to provide elements of makewhole recovery beyond mere recoupment of the fraud.Cf.

Bornstein, 423 U. S., at 315, and n. 11. It may also be
necessary for full recovery even when there is no qui tam
relator to be paid. The FCA has no separate provision for
prejudgment interest, which is usually thought essential to
compensation, see, e. g., Kansas v. Colorado, 533 U. S. 1,
10-11 (2001), and might well be substantial given the FCA's
long statute of limitations, $ 3731(b). Nor does the FCA expressly provide for the consequential damages that typically
come with recovery for fraud, see Restatement (Second) of
Torts $ 549(1)(b), and Comment d (1976).9

Thus, although Stevens recognized that the FCA's treble
damages remedy is still "punitive" in that recovery will exceed full compensation in a good many cases, the force of this

9 The treble damages provision was, in a way, adopted by Congress as
a substitute for consequential damages. The Senate version of the bill
proposed consequential damages on top of treble damages, while the
House version proposed consequential damages plus double damages.
See S. Rep. No. 99-345, p. 39 (1986) (hereinafter S. Rep.); H. R. Rep.
No. 99-660, p. 20 (1986). Ultimately, the Senate's treble figure was
adopted and the consequential damages provision dropped.

538US1 Unit: $U31 [10-26-04 20:26:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN
132 COOK COUNTY v. UNITED STATES ex rel. CHANDLER

Opinion of the Court
punitive nature in arguing against municipal liability is notas robust as if it were a pure penalty in all cases. Treble

damages certainly do not equate with classic punitive dam-ages, which leave the jury with open-ended discretion over
the amount and so raises two concerns specific to municipaldefendants. One is that a local government's taxing power
makes it an easy target for an unduly generous jury. See
Newport, 453 U. S., at 270-271. But under the FCA, thejury is open to no such temptation; if it finds liability, its

instruction is to return a verdict for actual damages, forwhich the court alone then determines any multiplier, just
as the court alone sets any separate penalty. $ 3729(a); see
277 F. 3d, at 978. There is mitigation, also, for the second
worry, that "blameless or unknowing taxpayers" will be unfairly taxed for the wrongdoing of local officials. Newport,
453 U. S., at 267. This very case shows how FCA liability
may expose only local taxpayers who have already enjoyed
the indirect benefit of the fraud, to the extent that the federal money has already been passed along in lower taxes
or expanded services. Cf. ibid. The question in such cases
is whether the local taxpayer should make up for an undeserved benefit, or the federal taxpayer be permanently out
of pocket, a question that can be answered in any given case,
not by an opportunistic qui tam relator, but by a combination
of the judge's discretion and the Government's power to intervene and dismiss or settle an action, see $ 3730(c)(2).

The presumption against punitive damages thus brings
only limited vigor to the County's aid. Working against the
County's position, however, is a different presumption, this
one at full strength: the "cardinal rule . . . that repeals by
implication are not favored." Posadas v. National City
Bank, 296 U. S. 497, 503 (1936). Inferring repeal from legislative silence is hazardous at best, and error seems overwhelmingly likely in the notion that the 1986 amendments
wordlessly redefined "person" to exclude municipalities.
The County's argument, it must be remembered, is not

538US1 Unit: $U31 [10-26-04 20:26:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN

133Cite as: 538 U. S. 119 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
merely that the treble damages feature of the 1986 amend-ments was meant to bypass municipal corporations; the argument is that the treble damages amendment must be readto eliminate the FCA's coverage of municipal corporations
entirely, after being the statutory law for over a century.This would be a hard case to make in the abstract, but it is
impossible when we consider what is known about the objectof the amendments in 1986.

The basic purpose of the 1986 amendments was to makethe FCA a "more useful tool against fraud in modern times."
S. Rep., at 2. Because Congress was concerned about per-vasive fraud in "all Government programs,"

ibid., it allowedprivate parties to sue even based on information already in

the Government's possession, see Hughes Aircraft Co. v.United States ex rel. Schumer, 520 U. S. 939, 946 (1997);
increased the Gover nment's measure of recovery; andenhanced the incentives for relators to bring suit

. Yet the
County urges that in so doing Congress made local govern-ments, which today often administer or receive federal funds,

immune not only from treble damages but from any liability
whatsoever under the FCA. Congress could have donethat, of course, but it makes no sense to suggest Congress

did it under its breath.10 It is simply not plausible that Con-gress intended to repeal municipal liability

sub silentio by
the very Act it passed to strengthen the Government's hand

10 Indeed, there is some evidence that Congress affirmatively endorsed
municipal liability when it passed the 1986 amendments. See S. Rep., at
8 (noting that "[t]he term `person' is used in its broad sense to include
partnerships, associations, and corporations . . . as well as States and political subdivisions thereof" (citing, inter alia, Monell v. New York City
Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658 (1978))). Although in Vermont
Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S.
765 (2000), we considered this evidence insufficient to overcome the background presumption that States are not "persons," in the present case the
statement belies the County's argument that Congress meant to change
the contrary presumption applicable to local governments and to remove
municipal liability.

IV
The term "person" in $ 3729 included local governments in1863 and nothing in the 1986 amendments redefined it. The

judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.

11 The presumption against implied repeal also explains why two of the
County's subsidiary arguments cannot succeed here, despite the fact that
we gave them credence in Stevens. First, the County contrasts $ 3729
with the Civil Investigative Demand provision enacted as part of the 1986
amendments, $ 3733, which expressly includes both States and local governments in the definition of "person." In Stevens, supra, at 783-784, we
read that express reference in the later $ 3733 to confirm the reading of
the earlier $ 3729, which was based on a common understanding in 1863
that "person" did not include a State; but "person" did presumptively include a municipality in 1863.

The County also argues it is not sensible to expose local governments
to FCA liability but not to liability under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act of 1986 (PFCRA), Pub. L. 99-509, 100 Stat. 1934 (codified at 31
U. S. C. $ 3801 et seq.), a statute enacted just before the FCA amendments
and "designed to operate in tandem with the FCA." Stevens, supra, at
786, n. 17. The PFCRA prohibits the same conduct as the FCA and specifically defines a "person" subject to liability as "any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or private organization." $ 3801(a)(6).
Even assuming the County is correct that local governments are not covered by the PFCRA despite the term "corporation," this is hardly a
weighty argument for an implied repeal of municipal liability under the
FCA, a separately enacted statute.

NORFOLK & WESTERN RAILWAY CO. v. AYERS

et al.

certiorari to the circuit court of kanawha county,west virginia

No. 01-963. Argued November 6, 2002--Decided March 10, 2003
Alleging that petitioner Norfolk & Western Railway Company (Norfolk)

had negligently exposed them to asbestos and thereby caused them to
contract the occupational disease asbestosis, respondents, six former
Norfolk employees (asbestosis claimants), brought this suit in a West
Virginia state court under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA
or Act). Section 1 of the FELA provides: "Every common carrier by
railroad while engaging in [interstate commerce], shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier
in such commerce . . . for such injury . . . resulting in whole or in part
from the [carrier's] negligence." As an element of their damages, the
asbestosis claimants sought recovery for mental anguish based on their
fear of developing cancer. The trial court instructed the jury that a
plaintiff who demonstrated a reasonable fear of cancer related to proven
physical injury from asbestos was entitled to compensation for that fear
as a part of the damages awardable for pain and suffering. The court
also instructed the jury not to reduce recoveries because of nonrailroad
exposures to asbestos, so long as the jury found that Norfolk was negligent and that dust exposures at Norfolk contributed, however slightly,
to each plaintiff's injuries. The court rejected Norfolk's proposed instructions, which would have (1) ruled out damages for fear of cancer
unless the claimant proved both an actual likelihood of developing cancer
and physical manifestations of the alleged fear, and (2) required the jury
to apportion damages between Norfolk and other employers alleged to
have contributed to an asbestosis claimant's disease. The jury returned
damages awards for each claimant. The Supreme Court of Appeals of
West Virginia denied discretionary review.

Held:

1. Mental anguish damages resulting from the fear of developing cancer may be recovered under the FELA by a railroad worker suffering
from the actionable injury asbestosis caused by work-related exposure
to asbestos. Pp. 145-159.

(a) The trial judge correctly stated the law when he charged the
jury that an asbestosis claimant, upon demonstrating a reasonable fear
of cancer stemming from his present disease, could recover for that fear

Syllabus
as part of asbestosis-related pain and suffering damages. In so ruling,
this Court follows the path marked by its decisions in Consolidated Rail
Corporation v. Gottshall, 512 U. S. 532, and Metro-North Commuter R.
Co. v. Buckley, 521 U. S. 424. Gottshall and Metro-North describe two
categories of claims for emotional distress damages: Stand-alone emotional distress claims not provoked by any physical injury, for which
recovery is sharply circumscribed by the common-law zone-of-danger
test; and emotional distress claims brought on by a physical injury, for
which pain and suffering recovery is permitted. This case is properly
placed in the emotional distress stemming from a physical injury category. The parties agree that the claimants suffer from asbestosis, a
cognizable injury under the FELA. As Metro-North plainly indicates,
when fear of cancer "accompanies a physical injury," pain and suffering
damages may include compensation for that fear. E. g., 521 U. S., at
430. The Court adheres to the clear line its recent decisions delineate. Pp. 145-148.

(b) Unlike stand-alone claims for negligently inflicted emotional distress, claims for pain and suffering associated with a physical injury are
traditionally compensable. By 1908, when the FELA was enacted, the
common law had evolved to encompass apprehension of future harm as
a component of pain and suffering. In recent years, of the many courts
that have ruled on the question presented here, a clear majority sustain
recovery. Arguing against this trend, Norfolk and its amici assert that
the asbestosis claimants' alleged cancer fears are too remote from asbestosis to warrant inclusion in their pain and suffering awards. Amicus
United States refers to the "separate disease rule," under which most
courts have held that the statute of limitations runs separately for each
asbestos-related disease. Because the asbestosis claimants may bring a
second action if cancer develops, the Government argues, cancer-related
damages are unwarranted here. The question, as the Government
frames it, is not whether the asbestosis claimants can recover for fear of
cancer, but when. But those claimants did not seek, and the trial court
did not allow, discrete damages for their increased risk of future cancer.
Instead, they sought damages for their current injury, which, they allege, encompasses a present fear that the toxic exposure causative of
asbestosis may later result in cancer. The Government's "when, not
whether," argument has a large gap; it excludes recovery for any fear
experienced by an asbestosis sufferer who never gets cancer. To be
compensable as pain and suffering, Norfolk further urges, a mental or
emotional harm must have been "directly brought about by a physical
injury." This argument elides over a key connection between Norfolk's
conduct and the damages the asbestosis claimants allege as part of their
pain and suffering: Once found liable for any bodily harm, a negligent

538US1 Unit: $U32 [10-28-04 13:21:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

137Cite as: 538 U. S. 135 (2003)
Syllabus
actor is answerable in damages under the common law for emotional
disturbance resulting from that harm or from the conduct which causes
it. Given the acknowledgment by Norfolk's expert that asbestosis puts
a worker in a heightened risk category for asbestos-related lung cancer,
as well as the undisputed testimony of the asbestosis claimants' expert
that some ten percent of asbestosis sufferers have died of mesothelioma,
the claimants would have good cause for increased apprehension about
their vulnerability to cancer. Although Metro-North stressed that
holding employers liable to workers merely exposed to asbestos would
risk "unlimited and unpredictable liability," 521 U. S., at 435, that decision sharply distinguished exposure-only plaintiffs from those who suffer from a disease, and stated, unambiguously, that the common law
permits emotional distress recovery for the latter category, e. g., id., at
436. The categorical exclusion of exposure-only claimants reduces the
universe of potential claimants to numbers neither "unlimited" nor "unpredictable," for, of those exposed to asbestos, only a small fraction will
develop asbestosis. Pp. 148-157.

(c) The Court affirms the qualification of an asbestosis sufferer to
seek compensation for fear of cancer as an element of his asbestosisrelated pain and suffering damages, but with an important reservation.
It is incumbent upon the complainant to prove that his alleged fear is
genuine and serious. In this case, proof directed to that matter was
notably thin, and might well have succumbed to a straightforward
sufficiency-of-the-evidence objection, had Norfolk so targeted its attack.
But Norfolk, instead, sought categorical exclusion of cancer-fear damages for asbestosis claimants. This Court, moreover, did not grant review to judge the sufficiency of the evidence or the reasonableness of
the damages awards. Pp. 157-159.

2. The FELA's express terms, reinforced by consistent judicial applications of the Act, allow a worker to recover his entire damages from a
railroad whose negligence jointly caused an injury, thus placing on the
railroad the burden of seeking contribution from other potential tortfeasors. Pp. 159-166.

(a) The statutory language supports the trial court's understanding
that the FELA does not provide for apportionment of damages between
railroad and nonrailroad causes. Section 1 of the Act makes common
carrier railroads "liable in damages to any person suffering injury while
he is employed by such carrier in such commerce . . . for such injury . . .
resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of such carrier." 45
U. S. C. $ 51. The claimants here suffer from asbestosis (an "injury"),
which is linked to their employment with Norfolk and "result[ed] in
whole or in part from . . . negligence" by Norfolk. Norfolk is therefore
"liable in damages . . . for such injury." Nothing in the statutory text

538US1 Unit: $U32 [10-28-04 13:21:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN
138 NORFOLK & WESTERN R. CO. v. AYERS

Syllabus
instructs that the amount of damages payable by a liable employer bears
reduction when the negligence of a third party also contributed in part
to the injury-in-suit. Norfolk maintains that the statutory language
conveying that a railroad is liable only for injuries an employee sustains
"while he is employed by such carrier" makes it clear that railroads are
not liable for employee injuries resulting from outside causes. Placed
in context, however, the clause on which Norfolk relies clarifies that the
FELA's reach is limited to injuries sustained by railroad employees
while the employees are themselves engaged in interstate commerce;
the provision does not speak to cases in which an injury has multiple
causes, some related to railroad employment and others unrelated to
that employment. Moreover, interpreting $ 1 to require apportionment
would put that provision in tension with the rest of the statute. Several of the FELA's provisions expand a railroad's liability by abolishing
common-law defenses that limited employees' ability to recover against
their employers. And although the Act expressly directs apportionment of responsibility between employer and employee based on
comparative fault, it expressly prescribes no other apportionment.
Pp. 159-161.

(b) Norfolk's view also runs counter to a century of FELA jurisprudence. No FELA decision made by this Court so much as hints that
the statute mandates apportionment of damages among potentially liable tortfeasors. Also significant, there is scant lower court authority
for the proposition that the FELA contemplates apportionment, and
this Court has repeatedly stated that joint and several liability is the
traditional rule, see, e. g., The "Atlas," 93 U. S. 302, 315. Norfolk contends that the modern trend is to apportion damages between multiple
tortfeasors. The state of affairs when the FELA was enacted, however, is the more important guide. See, e. g., Monessen Southwestern
R. Co. v. Morgan, 486 U. S. 330, 336-339. At any rate, many States
retain full joint and several liability, even more retain it in certain circumstances, and most of the recent changes away from the traditional
rule have come through legislative enactments rather than judicial development of common-law principles. Congress, however, has not
amended the FELA. Finally, reading the FELA to require apportionment would handicap plaintiffs and could vastly complicate adjudications. Once an employer has been adjudged negligent with respect to
a given injury, it accords with the FELA's overarching purpose to require the employer to bear the burden of identifying other responsible
parties and demonstrating that some of the costs of the injury should
be spread to them. Pp. 161-166.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA or Act), 35Stat. 65, as amended, 45 U. S. C. $$ 51-60, makes common

carrier railroads liable in damages to employees who sufferwork-related injuries caused "in whole or in part" by the
railroad's negligence. This case, brought against Norfolk &Western Railway Company (Norfolk) by six former employees now suffering from asbestosis (asbestosis claimants), pre-sents two issues involving the FELA's application. The first
issue concerns the damages recoverable by a railroad workerwho suffers from the disease asbestosis: When the cause of
that disease, in whole or in part, was exposure to asbes-tos while on the job, may the worker's recovery for his
asbestosis-related "pain and suffering" include damages forfear of developing cancer?

The second issue concerns the extent of the railroad's lia-bility when third parties not before the court--for example,
prior or subsequent employers or asbestos manufacturers orsuppliers--may have contributed to the worker's injury. Is
the railroad answerable in full to the employee, so that pur-suit of contribution or indemnity from other potentially liable
enterprises is the railroad's sole damages-award-sharing re-course? Or is the railroad initially entitled to an apportionment among injury-causing tortfeasors, i. e., a division of
American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations
et al. by Jonathan P. Hiatt, Robert Alexander, Leon Dayan, and Laurence Gold.

Opinion of the Court
damages limiting the railroad's liability to the injured em-ployee to a proportionate share?

In resolving the first issue, we follow the line drawn byMetro-North Commuter R. Co. v. Buckley, 521 U. S. 424
(1997), a decision that relied on and complemented Consoli-dated Rail Corporation v. Gottshall, 512 U. S. 532 (1994).
In Metro-North, we held that emotional distress damagesmay not be recovered under the FELA by disease-free
asbestos-exposed workers; in contrast, we observed, workerswho "suffe[r] from a disease" (here, asbestosis) may "recover
for related negligently caused emotional distress." 521U. S., at 432. We decline to blur, blend, or reconfigure our
FELA jurisprudence in the manner urged by the petitioner;instead, we adhere to the clear line our recent decisions delineate. Accordingly, we hold that mental anguish damagesresulting from the fear of developing cancer may be recovered under the FELA by a railroad worker suffering fromthe actionable injury asbestosis caused by work-related exposure to asbestos.As to the second issue, we similarly decline to write
new law by requiring an initial apportionment of damagesamong potential tortfeasors. The FELA's express terms,
reinforced by consistent judicial applications of the Act,allow a worker to recover his entire damages from a railroad
whose negligence jointly caused an injury (here, the chronicdisease asbestosis), thus placing on the railroad the burden
of seeking contribution from other tortfeasors.

I
The asbestosis claimants (plaintiffs below, respondentshere) brought this FELA action against their former employer, Norfolk, in the Circuit Court of Kanawha County,West Virginia.

them to asbestos, which caused them to contract the occupa1 FELA cases may be brought, at plaintiff's option, in federal court or

Opinion of the Court
tional disease asbestosis. App. 17-20.2 As an element oftheir occupational disease damages, the asbestosis claimants

sought recovery for mental anguish based on their fear ofdeveloping cancer. Id., at 21.

Before trial, Norfolk moved to exclude all evidence refer-ring to cancer as irrelevant and prejudicial. Id., at 52-53.
The trial court denied the motion, Tr. 251 (Apr. 14, 1998),and the asbestosis claimants placed before the jury extensive
evidence relating to cancer, including expert testimony thatasbestosis sufferers with smoking histories have a significantly increased risk of developing lung cancer.3 (Of the sixasbestosis claimants, five had smoking histories, and two
persisted in smoking even after their asbestosis diagnosis.App. 265, 336-337.) Asbestosis sufferers--workers whose
exposure to asbestos has manifested itself in a chronic dis-ease--the jury also heard, have a significant (one in ten) risk
of dying of mesothelioma, a fatal cancer of the lining of thelung or abdominal cavity.

Id., at 92-97 (asbestosis claim-ants' expert);
id., at 472 (Norfolk's expert) (nine or tenpercent).

2 Asbestosis is a noncancerous scarring of the lungs by asbestos fibers;
symptoms include shortness of breath, coughing, and fatigue. Ranging in
severity from mild to debilitating, it is a chronic disease that, in rare instances, is fatal. See RAND Institute for Civil Justice, S. Carroll et al.,
Asbestos Litigation Costs and Compensation: An Interim Report 17
(2002), Petitioner's Supplemental Lodging, p. SL82 (hereinafter RAND
Institute); U. S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Agency for Toxic
Substances and Disease Registry, Asbestos Toxicity 20 (2000).

3 The risk of mortality from lung cancer for smokers with asbestosis, the

trial evidence showed, is 39 percent. App. 93-94 (asbestosis claimants'
expert); id., at 473 (Norfolk's expert). For nonsmokers, the risk is much
lower, approximately 2.5 percent. Ibid.

4 While smoking contributes significantly to the risk of lung cancer, it

does not bear on the risk of mesothelioma. Id., at 93. Asbestos is the
only cause of mesothelioma established thus far, although some instances
of the disease are not traceable to asbestos. RAND Institute 17. The
latency period for asbestos-related disease is generally 20-40 years from
exposure. Id., at 16.

Opinion of the Court
Concluding that no asbestosis claimant had shown he wasreasonably certain to develop cancer, the trial court instructed the jury that damages could not be awarded to anyclaimant "for cancer or any increased risk of cancer." Id.,
at 573. The testimony about cancer, the court explained,was relevant "only to judge the genuineness of plaintiffs'
claims of fear of developing cancer." Ibid. On that score,the court charged:

"[A]ny plaintiff who has demonstrated that he has devel-oped a reasonable fear of cancer that is related to proven
physical injury from asbestos is entitled to be compen-sated for that fear as a part of the damages you may
award for pain and suffering." Ibid.
In so instructing the jury, the court rejected Norfolk's pro-posed instruction, which would have ruled out damages for

an asbestosis sufferer's fear of cancer, unless the claimantproved both "an actual likelihood of developing cancer" and
"physical manifestations" of the alleged fear. See id., at 548.The trial court also refused Norfolk's request to instruct
the jury to apportion damages between Norfolk and otheremployers alleged to have contributed to an asbestosis claimant's disease. Id., at 539.5 Two of the claimants had sig-nificant exposure to asbestos while working for other employers: Carl Butler, exposed to asbestos at Norfolk for onlythree months, worked with asbestos elsewhere as a pipefitter
for 33 years, id., at 250, 252, 375; Freeman Ayers was ex-posed to asbestos for several years while working at auto5 The apportionment instruction Norfolk proposed stated: "If you find
that the plaintiff in this case has a condition or disease which was caused
by his employment with employers other than the railroad, plaintiff's recovery must be limited to only such damages as result from his railroad
employment and he cannot recover damages which have been or will be
caused by his nonrailroad employment. This is so because the railroad
can be held responsible only for such of a plaintiff's damages as result
from its alleged negligence while the plaintiff was employed at the railroad." App. 539.

Opinion of the Court
body shops, id., at 274-275. In awarding damages, the trialcourt charged, the jury was "not to make a deduction for the

contribution of non-railroad exposures," so long as it foundthat Norfolk was negligent and that "dust exposures at [Norfolk] contributed, however slightly, to the plaintiff 's inju-ries." Id., at 570.

6

The jury returned total damages awards for each asbesto-sis claimant, ranging from $770,000 to $1.2 million.

Id., at578-589. After reduction for three claimants' comparative

negligence from smoking and for settlements with non-FELA entities, the final judgments amounted to approximately $4.9 million. Id., at 590-613. It is impossible tolook behind those judgments to determine the amount the
jury awarded for any particular element of damages. Nor-folk, although it could have done so, see W. Va. Rule Civ.
Proc. 49 (1998), did not endeavor to clarify the jury's dam-ages determinations; it did not seek a special verdict or interrogatory calling upon the jury to report, separately, itsassessments, if any, for fear-of-cancer damages.

The trial court denied Norfolk's motion for a new trial,App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a, and the Supreme Court of Appeals
of West Virginia denied Norfolk's request for discretionaryreview,

id., at 1a-2a. We granted certiorari, 535 U. S. 969(2002), and now affirm.

II
Section 1 of the FELA renders common carrier railroads"liable in damages to any person suffering injury while . . .

employed by [the] carrier" if the "injury or death result-[ed] in whole or in part from the [carrier's] negligence."

6 As required by the FELA, the trial court directed the jury to determine whether negligence by any of the asbestosis claimants contributed
to their injuries and to compare any such negligence with that of Norfolk
"in terms of percentages." Id., at 570-571; see 45 U. S. C. $ 53 ("contributory negligence shall not bar a recovery, but the damages shall be diminished by the jury in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable
to such employee").

Opinion of the Court
45 U. S. C. $ 51. Enacted in 1908, Congress designed the
FELA to "shif[t] part of the `human overhead' of doing business from employees to their employers." Gottshall, 512
U. S., at 542 (quoting Tiller v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 318
U. S. 54, 58 (1943)). "[T]o further [the Act's] humanitarian
purposes, Congress did away with several common-law tort
defenses that had effectively barred recovery by injured
workers." Gottshall, 512 U. S., at 542. As cataloged in
Gottshall, the FELA "abolished the fellow servant rule";
"rejected the doctrine of contributory negligence in favor
of . . . comparative negligence"; "prohibited employers from
exempting themselves from [the] FELA through contract";
and, in a 1939 amendment, "abolished the assumption of risk
defense." Id., at 542-543; see 45 U. S. C. $$ 51-55. "Only
to the extent of these explicit statutory alterations," however, "is [the] FELA `an avowed departure from the rules
of the common law.' " Gottshall, 512 U. S., at 544 (quoting
Sinkler v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 356 U. S. 326, 329 (1958)).
When the Court confronts a dispute regarding what injuries
are compensable under the statute, Gottshall instructs,
common-law principles "are entitled to great weight in our
analysis." 512 U. S., at 544; see id., at 558 (Souter, J., concurring) (The Court's duty "is to develop a federal common
law of negligence under FELA, informed by reference to the
evolving common law.").

A

We turn first to the question whether the trial judge correctly stated the law when he charged the jury that an asbestosis claimant, upon demonstrating a reasonable fear of cancer stemming from his present disease, could recover for that
fear as part of asbestosis-related pain and suffering damages.
See supra, at 143. In answering this question, we follow
the path marked by the Court's decisions in Consolidated

538US1 Unit: $U32 [10-28-04 13:21:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN
146 NORFOLK & WESTERN R. CO. v. AYERS

Opinion of the Court
Rail Corporation v. Gottshall, 512 U. S. 532 (1994), and
Metro-North Commuter R. Co. v. Buckley, 521 U. S. 424
(1997).The FELA plaintiff in

Gottshall alleged that he witnessed
the death of a co-worker while on the job, and that the epi-sode caused him severe emotional distress. 512 U. S., at

536-537. He sought to recover damages from his employer,
Conrail, for "mental or emotional harm . . . not directlybrought about by a physical injury."

Id., at 544.
Reversing the Court of Appeals' judgment in favor of theplaintiff, this Court stated that uncabined recognition of

claims for negligently inflicted emotional distress would
"hol[d] out the very real possibility of nearly infinite and unpredictable liability for defendants." Id., at 546. Of the
"limiting tests . . . developed in the common law," ibid., the
Court selected the zone-of-danger test to delineate "the
proper scope of an employer's duty under [the] FELA to
avoid subjecting its employees to negligently inflicted emotional injury," id., at 554. That test confines recovery for
stand-alone emotional distress claims to plaintiffs who:
(1) "sustain a physical impact as a result of a defendant's
negligent conduct"; or (2) "are placed in immediate risk of
physical harm by that conduct"--that is, those who escaped
instant physical harm, but were "within the zone of danger of
physical impact." Id., at 547-548 (internal quotation marks
omitted). The Court remanded Gottshall for reconsideration under the zone-of-danger test. Id., at 558.

In Metro-North, the Court applied the zone-of-danger test
to a claim for damages under the FELA, one element of
which was fear of cancer stemming from exposure to asbestos. The plaintiff in Metro-North had been intensively exposed to asbestos while working as a pipefitter for MetroNorth in New York City's Grand Central Terminal. At the
time of his lawsuit, however, he had a clean bill of health.
The Court rejected his entire claim for relief. Exposure
alone, the Court held, is insufficient to show "physical im538US1 Unit: $U32 [10-28-04 13:21:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

147Cite as: 538 U. S. 135 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
pact" under the zone-of-danger test. 521 U. S., at 430. "[A]
simple (though extensive) contact with a carcinogenic substance," the Court observed, "does not . . . offer much help
in separating valid from invalid emotional distress claims."
Id., at 434. The evaluation problem would be formidable,
the Court explained, "because contacts, even extensive contacts, with serious carcinogens are common." Ibid. "The
large number of those exposed and the uncertainties that
may surround recovery," the Court added, "suggest what
Gottshall called the problem of `unlimited and unpredictable
liability.' " Id., at 435 (quoting 512 U. S., at 557).

As in Gottshall, the Court distinguished stand-alone distress claims from prayers for damages for emotional pain and
suffering tied to a physical injury: "Common-law courts," the
Court recognized, "do permit a plaintiff who suffers from a
disease to recover for related negligently caused emotional
distress . . . ." 521 U. S., at 432 (emphasis added). When a
plaintiff suffers from a disease, the Court noted, common-law
courts have made "a special effort" to value related emotional distress, "perhaps from a desire to make a physically
injured victim whole or because the parties are likely to be
in court in any event." Id., at 436-437.

In sum, our decisions in Gottshall and Metro-North describe two categories: Stand-alone emotional distress claims
not provoked by any physical injury, for which recovery is
sharply circumscribed by the zone-of-danger test; and emotional distress claims brought on by a physical injury, for
which pain and suffering recovery is permitted. Norfolk,
whose position the principal dissent embraces, see, e. g., post,
at 172, 177 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and dissenting
in part), would have us ally this case with those in the
stand-alone emotional distress category, Brief for Petitioner
16-31; the asbestosis claimants urge its placement in the

148 NORFOLK & WESTERN R. CO. v. AYERS

Opinion of the Court
emotional distress brought on by a physical injury (or dis-ease) category, Brief for Respondents 26.

7

Relevant to this characterization question, the partiesagree that asbestosis is a cognizable injury under the FELA.

See Urie v. Thompson, 337 U. S. 163, 187 (1949) (occupationaldiseases caused by exposure to hazardous dusts are injuries
under the FELA). Norfolk does not dispute that the claim-ants suffer from asbestosis, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 4, or that
asbestosis can be "a clinically serious, often disabling, andprogressive disease," Reply Brief 6 (internal quotation
marks omitted). As Metro-North plainly indicates, pain andsuffering damages may include compensation for fear of cancer when that fear "accompanies a physical injury." 521U. S., at 430; see

id., at 436 ("The common law permits emo-tional distress recovery for that category of plaintiffs who

suffer from a disease."). Norfolk, therefore, cannot plausi-bly maintain that the claimants here, like the plaintiff in
Metro-North, "are disease and symptom free." Id., at 432.The plaintiffs in

Gottshall and Metro-North grounded theirsuits on claims of negligent infliction of emotional distress.

The claimants before us, in contrast, complain of a negli-gently inflicted physical injury (asbestosis) and attendant
pain and suffering. B

Unlike stand-alone claims for negligently inflicted emo-tional distress, claims for pain and suffering associated with,
or "parasitic" on, a physical injury are traditionally compen-sable. The Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 456 (1963-1964)
(hereinafter Restatement) states the general rule:

"If the actor's negligent conduct has so caused anybodily harm to another as to make him liable for it, the

actor is also subject to liability for
7 Justice Breyer, it appears, would not place this case in either of the
two above-described categories, but somewhere in between. See post, at
187 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).

Opinion of the Court
"(a) fright, shock, or other emotional disturbance resulting from the bodily harm or from the conduct which
causes it . . . ." (Emphases added.)

A plaintiff suffering bodily harm need not allege physical
manifestations of her mental anguish. Id., Comment c.
"The plaintiff must of course present evidence that she has
suffered, but otherwise her emotional distress claims, in
whatever form, are fully recoverable." D. Dobbs, Law of
Torts 822 (2000).

By 1908, when the FELA was enacted, the common law
had evolved to encompass apprehension of future harm as a
component of pain and suffering. The future harm, genuinely feared, need not be more likely than not to materialize.
See Minneman, Future Disease or Condition, or Anxiety Relating Thereto, as Element of Recovery, 50 A. L. R. 4th 13,
25, $ 2[a] (1986) (mental anguish related to physical injury is
recoverable even if "the underlying future prospect is not
itself compensable inasmuch as it is not sufficiently likely to
occur"). Physically injured plaintiffs, it is now recognized,
may recover for "reasonable fears" of a future disease.
Dobbs, supra, at 844. As a classic example, plaintiffs bitten
by dogs succeeded in gaining recovery, not only for the pain
of the wound, but also for their fear that the bite would
someday result in rabies or tetanus. The wound might heal,
but "[t]he ghost of hydrophobia is raised, not to down during
the life-time of the victim." The Lord Derby, 17 F. 265, 267
(ED La. 1883).8

Opinion of the Court
In the course of the 20th century, courts sustained a vari-ety of other "fear-of " claims.

9 Among them have been

claims for fear of cancer. Heightened vulnerability to can-cer, as one court observed, "must necessarily have a most

depressing effect upon the injured person. Like the swordof Damocles," he knows it is there, but not whether or when
it will fall. Alley v. Charlotte Pipe & Foundry Co., 159 N. C.327, 331, 74 S. E. 885, 886 (1912).

Opinion of the Court
Arguing against the trend in the lower courts, Norfolk andits supporting amici assert that the asbestosis claimants' alleged cancer fears are too remote from asbestosis to warrantinclusion in their pain and suffering awards. In support of
this contention, the United States, one of Norfolk's amici,refers to the "separate disease rule," under which most
courts have held that the statute of limitations runs sepa-rately for each asbestos-related disease. Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 12. See, e. g., Wilson v. JohnsManville Sales Corp., 684 F. 2d 111, 120-121 (CADC 1982);Pustejovsky v. Rapid-American Corp., 35 S. W. 3d 643, 649,

to asbestos has resulted in physical injury"); Lavelle v. Owens-Corning

Common Pleas, Cuyahoga Cty. 1987) (asbestosis-afflicted plaintiff could recover for fear of cancer either as pain and suffering damages associated
with asbestosis, or as compensable stand-alone claim of negligent infliction
of emotional distress).

Contrary precedent is slim in comparison to the heavy weight of authority. See Fulmore v. CSX Transp., Inc., 252 Ga. App. 884, 897, 557 S. E.
2d 64, 75 (2001) (denying fear-of-cancer damages to asbestosis claimant
based in part on misplaced reliance on Metro-North Commuter R. Co. v.

12 The rule evolved as a response to the special problem posed by latentdisease cases. Under the single-action rule, a plaintiff who recovered for
asbestosis would then be precluded from bringing suit for later developed
mesothelioma. Allowing separate complaints for each disease, courts de538US1 Unit: $U32 [10-28-04 13:21:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

claimants may bring a second action if cancer develops, Nor-folk and the Government argue, cancer-related damages are

unwarranted in their asbestosis suit. Tr. of Oral Arg. 17-18;Reply Brief 5. The question, as the Government frames it,
is not whether the asbestosis claimants can recover for fearof cancer, but

when. Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 15. The principal dissent sounds a similar theme.
Post, at 174 ("a person with asbestosis will not be without aremedy for pain and suffering caused by cancer").

But the asbestosis claimants did not seek, and the trialcourt did not allow, discrete damages for their

increased risk
of future cancer. App. 573 ("[Y]ou cannot award damagesto plaintiffs for cancer or for any increased risk of cancer.");

see supra, at 143. Instead, the claimants sought damagesfor their

current injury, which, they allege, encompasses a
present fear that the toxic exposure causative of asbestosismay later result in cancer. The Government's

"when, not
whether," argument has a large gap; it excludes recovery for
the fear experienced by an asbestosis sufferer who never
gets cancer. For such a person, the question is whether, not
when, he may recover for his fear.

Even if the question is whether, not simply when, an asbestosis sufferer may recover for cancer fear, Norfolk has another string in its bow. To be compensable as pain and suffering, Norfolk maintains, a mental or emotional harm must
have been "directly brought about by a physical injury."
Brief for Petitioner 15 (emphasis deleted; internal quotation
marks omitted) (quoting Gottshall, 512 U. S., at 544). Because asbestosis itself, as distinguished from asbestos expotermined, properly balanced a defendant's interest in repose and a plaintiff's interest in recovering adequate compensation for negligently inflicted injuries. See, e. g., Wilson, 684 F. 2d, at 119. There is no
inevitable conflict between the "separate disease rule" and recovery of
cancer fear damages by asbestosis claimants. The rule simply allows recovery for successive diseases and would necessarily exclude only double
recovery for the same element of damages.

matter of law, to be an element of [an asbestosis sufferer's]pain and suffering." Tr. of Oral Arg. 11; see post, at 172.

13

This argument elides over a key connection between Nor-folk's conduct and the damages the asbestosis claimants allege as an element of their pain and suffering: Once found
liable for "any bodily harm," a negligent actor is answerablein damages for emotional disturbance "resulting from the

bodily harm or from the conduct which causes it." Restate-ment $ 456(a) (emphasis added).

14

There is an undisputed relationship between exposure toasbestos sufficient to cause asbestosis, and asbestos-related

cancer. Norfolk's own expert acknowledged that asbestosisputs a worker in a heightened risk category for asbestosrelated lung cancer. App. 470 (affirming that "asbestosis hasto be necessary before lung cancer is a problem"). See W.
Morgan & A. Seaton, Occupational Lung Diseases 151 (3d ed.1995) (hereinafter Morgan & Seaton) ("[H]eavy cumulative
exposures to asbestos which lead to asbestosis increase the
risk of developing lung cancer. . . . [T]here is now consider-able evidence which indicates that the risk of lung cancer

without contradiction to a risk notably "different in kind
from the background risks that all individuals face," post, at
187 (Breyer, J.): Some "ten percent of the people who have
the disease, asbestosis, have died of mesothelioma." App.
93; see Morgan & Seaton 350 ("The evidence suggests that,
once the lungs of the susceptible subject have been primed
by a sufficient dose of asbestos, then the development of [mesothelioma] is inevitable.").15 In light of this evidence, an
asbestosis sufferer would have good cause for increased apprehension about his vulnerability to another illness from his
exposure, a disease that inflicts "agonizing, unremitting
pain," relieved only by death, post, at 168 (Kennedy, J.): Asbestosis is "a chronic, painful and concrete reminder that [a

claimants' cancer risk. Brief for Petitioner 22-24, and nn. 18-20. We do
not sit to reweigh evidence based on information not presented at trial.
See Tennant v. Peoria & Pekin Union R. Co., 321 U. S. 29, 35 (1944). We
note, however, that none of the studies to which Norfolk refers addresses
the risk of cancer for persons with asbestosis. Rather, they home in on
the relationship between asbestos exposure and cancer. See Morgan, Attitudes About Asbestos and Lung Cancer, 22 Am. J. Indus. Med. 437 (1992);
Goodman, Morgan, Ray, Malloy, & Zhao, Cancer in Asbestos-Exposed Occupational Cohorts: A Meta-Analysis, 10 Cancer Causes & Control 453
(1999); Erren, Jacobsen, & Piekarski, Synergy Between Asbestos and
Smoking on Lung Cancer Risks, 10 Epidemiology 405 (1999). Norfolk
further suggests that cancer risk from asbestos varies by fiber type.
Brief for Petitioner 24, and n. 19 (citing Morgan & Seaton 346-347). Even
if true, this suggestion is unavailing: Norfolk does not allege that it exposed the asbestosis claimants to the less toxic fiber type. Finally, Norfolk argues that the studies quantifying cancer risk for workers with asbestosis cannot accurately be extrapolated to evaluate the risk for these
particular asbestosis claimants. Reply Brief 8-9, and n. 4. Nothing impeded Norfolk from presenting this argument to the jury.

and quantitatively intensify his fear." Eagle-Picher Indus-tries, Inc. v. Cox, 481 So. 2d, at 529.

Norfolk understandably underscores a point central to theCourt's decision in Metro-North. Reply Brief 10. The
Court's opinion in Metro-North stressed that holding em-ployers liable to workers merely exposed to asbestos would
risk "unlimited and unpredictable liability." 521 U. S., at435 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting

Gottshall,512 U. S., at 557). But as earlier observed, see supra, at 147,

Metro-North sharply distinguished exposure-only plaintiffsfrom "plaintiffs who suffer from a disease," and stated, unambiguously, that "[t]he common law permits emotional dis-tress recovery for [the latter] category." 521 U. S., at 436;
see id., at 432. Commentary similarly distinguishes asymp-tomatic asbestos plaintiffs from plaintiffs who "developed
asbestosis and thus suffered real physical harm." Hender-son & Twerski, Asbestos Litigation Gone Mad: ExposureBased Recovery for Increased Risk, Mental Distress, andMedical Monitoring, 53 S. C. L. Rev. 815, 830 (2002); see

id.,at 830, 833-834 (classifying plaintiffs with pleural thickening

as asymptomatic and observing that, unlike asbestosis suffer-ers, they face no "significantly increased risk of developing
cancer" and do not "suffe[r] current pain that serves as aconstant reminder that a more serious disease may come

16 Unconstrained by "the majority rule or the rule of the Restatement,"
post, at 177 (Kennedy, J.), the principal dissent would erase the line
drawn in Metro-North between exposure-only asbestos claimants, and
those who "suffe[r] from a disease," 521 U. S., at 432. Repeatedly, that
dissent recites as properly controlling here case law governing "standalone tort action[s] for negligent infliction of emotional distress." Post, at

Opinion of the Court
The categorical approach endorsed in Metro-North servesto reduce the universe of potential claimants to numbers neither "unlimited" nor "unpredictable." Relevant here, and asNorfolk recognizes, of those exposed to asbestos, only a fraction will develop asbestosis. Brief for Petitioner 22, n. 16(quoting In re Haw. Fed. Asbestos Cases, 734 F. Supp. 1563,
1570 (Haw. 1990) ("A reasonable person, exercising due dili-gence, should know that of those exposed to asbestos, only a
small percentage suffer from asbestos-related physical im-pairment.")); cf. Morgan & Seaton 319 (study showed that of
persons exposed to asbestos after 1959, only 2 percent hadasbestosis when first examined; for those exposed from 1950-
1959, that figure is 18 percent).

C
Norfolk presented the question "[w]hether a plaintiff whohas asbestosis but not cancer can recover damages for fear

of cancer under the [FELA] without proof of physical mani-festations of the claimed emotional distress." Brief for Petitioner (i). Our answer is yes, with an important reser-vation. We affirm only the qualification of an asbestosis
sufferer to seek compensation for fear of cancer as an ele-ment of his asbestosis-related pain and suffering damages.
It is incumbent upon such a complainant, however, to provethat his alleged fear is genuine and serious. See,

e. g., Smithv. A. C. & S., Inc., 843 F. 2d 854, 859 (CA5 1988) ("general

to recover for fear of cancer only if they "make out a claim for negligent
infliction of emotional distress; and they cannot do so"); 180 (quoting from
Gottshall). But see Metro-North, 521 U. S., at 437 ("emotional distress
damages sought by asbestosis-afflicted plaintiff" found to fit "within a category where the law already permitted recovery for mental distress").

The principal dissent gains no genuine aid from Barron v. MartinMarietta Corp., 868 F. Supp. 1203 (ND Cal. 1994), a decision it cites as
authority for equating exposure-only and asbestosis claimants. See post,
at 175. The Barron plaintiffs "adduced no evidence of exposure to a toxic
substance which threatens cancer." 868 F. Supp., at 1205. When that is
the case, we agree, cancer-fear damages are unavailable.

also Minneman, 50 A. L. R. 4th, $ 5, at 54-56, (discussing
cases affirming the view that "apprehension must be genuine").17 In this case, proof directed to that matter was notably thin,18 and might well have succumbed to a straightforward sufficiency-of-the-evidence objection, had Norfolk so
targeted its attack.

Norfolk, however, sought a larger shield. In the trial
court and in its unsuccessful petition to the Supreme Court

17 The asbestosis claimants here acknowledged that "a jury is entitled
to consider the absence of physical manifestations [of alleged emotional
disturbances] as evidence that a mental injury is less severe and therefore
less deserving of a significant award." Brief for Respondents 17.

Considering the dissents' readiness to "develop a federal common law"
to contain jury verdicts under the FELA, see post, at 170, 177, 181 (Kennedy, J.); post, at 187 (Breyer, J.), it is curious that the principal dissent
nevertheless questions the "basis in our FELA jurisprudence" for the requirement that claimants prove their alleged fear to be "genuine and serious," see post, at 180 (internal quotation marks omitted). In contrast to
the principal dissent, Justice Breyer appears ultimately to advance only
an elaboration of the requirement that the plaintiff prove fear that is "genuine and serious." He would specify, additionally, that the fear "significantly and detrimentally affec[t] the plaintiff's ability to carry on with
everyday life and work." Post, at 187. That elaboration, Justice
Breyer maintains, is "consistent with the sense of the common law."
Ibid. The definition Justice Breyer would give to the terms "genuine
and serious" in this context was not aired in the trial court or in this
Court. See supra, at 143, 148, and this page. We therefore resist ruling
on it today.

18 As Norfolk noted, one of the claimants did not testify to having any

concern about cancer; another testified that he was more afraid of shortness of breath from his asbestosis than of cancer. Others testified to varying degrees of concern over developing the disease; no claimant presented
corroborative objective evidence of his fear. Brief for Petitioner 9 (citing
App. 116-117, 255, 277, 298-299, 332).

Opinion of the Court
of Appeals of West Virginia, Norfolk urged that fear of can-cer could figure in the recovery only if the claimant proved

both a likelihood of developing cancer and physical manifes-tations of the alleged fear. See App. 548 (Norfolk's charge
request); id., at 634 (amended petition for appeal). And al-though Norfolk submitted proposed verdict forms, id., at
549-560, those forms did not call for jury specification of theamount of damages, if any, awarded for fear of cancer. Thus,
as earlier observed, supra, at 144, it is impossible to tell fromthe verdicts returned whether the jury ascribed any part of
the damages awards to the alleged cancer fear, and if so,how much.

19

We did not grant review, in any event, to judge the suffi-ciency of the evidence or the reasonableness of the damages

awards. We rule, specifically and only, on the questionwhether this case should be aligned with those in which fear
of future injury stems from a current injury, or with thosepresenting a stand-alone claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress. We hold that the former categorization isthe proper one under the FELA.

IV
We turn next to Norfolk's contention that the trial courterred in instructing the jury "not to make a deduction [from

damages awards] for the contribution of non-railroad [asbes-tos] exposures" to the asbestosis claimants' injuries. App.
570. The statutory language, however, supports the trialcourt's understanding that the FELA does not authorize ap19 In their prediction that adhering to the line drawn in Gottshall and
Metro-North will, in this setting, bankrupt defendants, see post, at 168-169
(Kennedy, J.); post, at 186 (Breyer, J.), the dissents largely disregard,
inter alia, the verdict control devices available to the trial court. These
include, on a defendant's request, a charge that each plaintiff must prove
any alleged fear to be genuine and serious, review of the evidence on
damages for sufficiency, and particularized verdict forms. Norfolk chose
not to seek control measures of this order; instead, Norfolk sought to place
cancer-fear damages entirely outside the jury's ken. See supra, at
143, 147.

Opinion of the Court
portionment of damages between railroad and nonrailroadcauses. Section 1 of the Act, to which we earlier referred,

see supra, at 144-145, provides:

"Every common carrier by railroad while engaging in
[interstate commerce], shall be liable in damages to anyperson suffering injury while he is employed by such

carrier in such commerce . . . for such injury . . . result-ing in whole or in part from the negligence of . . . such
carrier . . . ." 45 U. S. C. $ 51.
The claimants here suffer from asbestosis (an "injury"),
which is linked to their employment with Norfolk and "re-sult[ed] in whole or in part from . . . negligence" by Norfolk.

Norfolk is therefore "liable in damages . . . for such injury."
Ibid. (emphasis added). Nothing in the statutory text instructs that the amount of damages payable by a liable em-ployer bears reduction when the negligence of a third party

also contributed in part to the injury-in-suit.Resisting this reading, Norfolk trains on the statutory language conveying that a railroad is liable only for injuries anemployee sustains "while he is employed by such carrier."
Ibid. That language, Norfolk maintains, "makes clear that
railroads are not liable for employee injuries that result fromoutside causes." Brief for Petitioner 32. Norfolk's argument uncouples the statutory language from its context, andthereby obscures its meaning.

The FELA applies to railroads only "while [they are]engaging in" interstate commerce. 45 U. S. C. $ 51. The
clause on which Norfolk relies clarifies that the statute'sreach is correspondingly limited to injuries sustained

by railroad employees while the employees are themselves engaged
"in such commerce." Ibid. (emphasis added); cf. The Employers' Liability Cases, 207 U. S. 463, 504 (1908) (predecessor statute declared unconstitutional because it regulated
employee injuries not sufficiently related to interstate commerce). Placed in context, the clause does not speak to

538US1 Unit: $U32 [10-28-04 13:21:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

161Cite as: 538 U. S. 135 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
cases in which an injury has multiple causes, some related torailroad employment and others unrelated to that employment. Such cases, we think, are controlled by the languagejust noted, which states that the railroad is "liable in damages" so long as the injury was caused "in whole or in part"by its "negligence." 45 U. S. C. $ 51.

The statutory context bolsters our reading, for interpreting $ 1 to require apportionment would put that provision intension with the rest of the statute. As recounted earlier,

see supra, at 145, several of the FELA's provisions expanda railroad's liability by abolishing common-law defenses that
limited employees' ability to recover against their employers.
Among the innovations, the Act expressly directs apportionment of responsibility between employer and employee
based on comparative fault. See $ 53 (set out in relevant
part supra, at 144, n. 6). The statute expressly prescribes
no other apportionment.

Essentially, then, Norfolk asks us to narrow employer liability without a textual warrant. Reining in employer liability as Norfolk proposes, however, is both unprovided for
by the language of the FELA and inconsistent with the Act's
overall recovery facilitating thrust. Accordingly, we find
Norfolk's plea an untenable reading of the congressional silence. Cf. Edmonds v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 443 U. S. 256, 268, n. 23 (1979) ("It would be particularly curious for Congress to refer expressly to the
established principle of comparative negligence, yet say not

a word about adopting a new rule limiting the liability of the
[defendant] on the basis of [another party's] negligence.").

Norfolk's view also runs counter to a century of FELA
jurisprudence. No FELA decision made by this Court so
much as hints that the statute mandates apportionment of
damages among potentially liable tortfeasors. Indeed, Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500 (1957), suggests

503; see id., at 508 ("[T]he inquiry in these cases today rarelypresents more than the single question whether negligence
of the employer played any part, however small, in the injuryor death which is the subject of the suit."). But if the
FELA required apportionment among potentially liable tort-feasors, the existence of contributing causes would be
highly relevant.Also significant is the paucity of lower court authority for
the proposition that the FELA contemplates apportionment.The federal and state reporters contain numerous FELA decisions stating that railroad employers may be held jointlyand severally liable for injuries caused in part by the negligence of third parties,20 and even more recognizing thatFELA defendants may bring indemnification and contribution actions against third parties under otherwise applicablestate or federal law.

been unnecessary had the FELA itself authorized apportion-ment. Norfolk identifies only one FELA decision supporting its position: Dale v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 520 Pa. 96,105-107, 552 A. 2d 1037, 1041-1042 (1989). But Dale cited
no previous decisions on point and has not been followed byany other court. It is therefore a reed too slim to overcome
the statutory language and the otherwise consistent histori-cal practice in the lower courts.

The conclusion that the FELA does not mandate appor-tionment is also in harmony with this Court's repeated statements that joint and several liability is the traditional rule.In an 1876 admiralty case, for example, we wrote:

"Nothing is more clear than the right of a plaintiff, hav-ing suffered . . . a loss [of cargo], to sue in a common-law
action all the wrong-doers, or any one of them, at hiselection; and it is equally clear, that, if he did not contribute to the disaster, he is entitled to judgment ineither case for

the full amount of his loss." The"Atlas," 93 U. S. 302, 315 (1876) (emphasis added).

See 42 Cong. Rec. 4536 (1908) (remarks of Sen. Dolliver) (theFELA was intended to "brin[g] our jurisprudence up to the
liberal interpretations that . . . now prevail in the admiraltycourts of the United States"). See also Miller v. Union Pacific R. Co., 290 U. S. 227, 236 (1933) (describing joint andseveral liability as "settled by innumerable authorities" and

Edmonds, 443 U. S., at 260 ( joint
and several liability remains the rule in admiralty).Norfolk nonetheless maintains that "[a]pportionment was

the common-law rule at the time of FELA's enactment" in1908. Brief for Petitioner 32. This Court's repeated statements concerning joint and several liability refute that contention. Many of Norfolk's historical authorities, moreover,address the

procedural question whether two defendants
may be sued in one action, rather than the substantive onewhether each negligent defendant is liable in full for a plaintiff 's injury. These "separate problems," Dean Prosser cautioned, "require separate consideration, and have very little
in common." Joint Torts and Several Liability, 25 Calif.
L. Rev. 413 (1937). While "[t]he common law rules as to
[procedural] joinder were extremely strict," id., at 414, "the
common law [also] developed . . . a distinct and altogether
unrelated principle: a defendant might be liable for the entire
loss sustained by the plaintiff, even though his negligence
concurred or combined with that of another to produce the
result" and even where "no [procedural] joinder would have
been possible," id., at 418.

Looking beyond historical practice, Norfolk contends that
the modern trend is to apportion damages between multiple
tortfeasors. Brief for Petitioner 40-43. The state of affairs
when the FELA was enacted, however, is the more important inquiry. See, e. g., Monessen Southwestern R. Co. v.
Morgan, 486 U. S. 330, 336-339 (1988) (prejudgment interest
is not available under the FELA because it was unavailable
at common law when the statute was enacted). At any rate,
many States retain full joint and several liability, see Restatement (Third) of Torts, Apportionment of Liability $ 17,
Reporters' Note, table, pp. 151-152 (1999), even more retain
it in certain circumstances, id., tables, at 153-159, and most

velopment of common-law principles, see id., $ B18, Report-ers' Note. Congress, however, has not amended the FELA.

Cf. Edmonds, 443 U. S., at 273 ("Once Congress has reliedupon conditions that the courts have created, we are not as
free as we would otherwise be to change them.").22Finally, reading the FELA to require apportionment
would handicap plaintiffs and could vastly complicate adjudi-cations, all the more so if, as Norfolk sometimes suggests,
see Brief for Petitioner 50, Reply Brief 20, manufacturersand suppliers, as well as other employers, should come
within the apportionment pool. See Sinkler, 356 U. S., at329 ("The cost of human injury, an inescapable expense of
railroading, must be borne by someone, and the FELA seeksto adjust that expense equitably between the worker and the
carrier."). Once an employer has been adjudged negligentwith respect to a given injury, it accords with the FELA's
overarching purpose to require the employer to bear theburden of identifying other responsible parties and demonstrating that some of the costs of the injury should be spreadto them.

23

Under the FELA, an employee who suffers an "injury"caused "in whole or in part" by a railroad's negligence may

22 Norfolk also suggests an analogy between the FELA and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980
(CERCLA), 42 U. S. C. $ 9601 et seq., under which many courts have held
that apportionment is available in some circumstances. Brief for Petitioner 44-45. But CERCLA's structure, purpose, and more recent vintage may differentiate that measure from the FELA in ways relevant to
the question presented. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae
6, n. 1. We need not and do not express any view on apportionment in
the CERCLA context.

23 Norfolk submits that requiring employers to sue for contribution will

be "wasteful," Brief for Petitioner 47, but FELA defendants may be able
to implead third parties and thus secure resolution of their contribution
actions in the same forum as the underlying FELA actions. See, e. g.,
Ellison v. Shell Oil Co., 882 F. 2d, at 350 (railroad sued by employee under
the FELA filed a third-party complaint against another party); Engvall
v. Soo Line R. Co., 632 N. W. 2d, at 563 (same).

Courts, however, must resist pleas of the kindNorfolk has made, essentially to reconfigure established liability rules because they do not serve to abate today's as-bestos litigation crisis. Cf.

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
It is otherwise as to Part III. The Court allows compensation for fear of cancer to those who manifest symptoms
of some other disease, not itself causative of cancer, though
stemming from asbestos exposure. The Court's precedents
interpreting FELA neither compel nor justify this result.
The Court's ruling is not based upon a sound application of
the common-law principles that should inform our decisions
implementing FELA. On the contrary, those principles call
for a different rule, one which does not yield such aberrant
results in asbestos exposure cases. These reasons require
my respectful dissent.

I

It is common ground that the purpose of FELA is to provide compensation for employees protected under the Act.
Ante, at 144-145. The Court's decision is a serious threat
to that objective. Although a ruling that allows compensation for fear of a disease might appear on the surface to be
solicitous of employees and thus consistent with the goals of
FELA, the realities of asbestos litigation should instruct the
Court otherwise.

Consider the consequences of allowing compensation for
fear of cancer in the cases now before the Court. The respondents are between 60 and 77 years old. All except one
have a long history of tobacco use, and three have smoked
for more than 50 years. They suffer from shortness of
breath, but only one testified that it affects his daily activities. As for emotional injury, one of the respondents complained that his shortness of breath caused him to become
depressed; the others stated, in response to questions from
their attorneys, that they have some "concern" about their
health and about cancer. For this, the jury awarded each
respondent between $770,640 and $1,230,806 in damages, reduced by the trial court to between $523,605 and $1,204,093
to account for the comparative negligence of the respondents' cigarette use.

168 NORFOLK & WESTERN R. CO. v. AYERS

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
Contrast this recovery with the prospects of an employeewho does not yet have asbestosis but who in fact will develop

asbestos-related cancer. Cancers caused by asbestos havelong periods of latency. Their symptoms do not become
manifest for decades after exposure. See Selikoff et al., La-tency of Asbestos Disease Among Insulation Workers in the
United States and Canada, 46 Cancer 2736, 2740 (1980) (lung
cancer becomes manifest 15-24 years af ter exposure);A. Churg & F. Green, Pathology of Occupational Lung Disease 350 (2d ed. 1998) ("The latency period for asbestos-induced mesothelioma is long, with a mean value of 30 to 40
years"); see generally Mustacchi, Lung Cancer Latency and
Asbestos Liability, 17 J. Legal Med. 277 (June 1996) (discussing the pathogenesis of asbestos-related carcinomata).
These cancers inflict excruciating pain and distress--pain
more severe than that associated with asbestosis, distress
more harrowing than the fear of developing a future illness.

One who has mesothelioma, in particular, faces agonizing,
unremitting pain in the lungs, which spreads throughout the
thoracic cavity as tumors expand and metastasize. See W.
Morgan & A. Seaton, Occupational Lung Diseases 353 (3d
ed. 1995). The symptoms do not subside. Their severity
increases, with death the only prospect for relief. And
death is almost certain within a short time from the onset of
mesothelioma. See ibid. ("Death usually occurs within 18
months to 2 years . . . . A minority of patients, somewhere
around 15%, survive 3 to 4 years"). Yet the majority's decision endangers this employee's chances of recovering any
damages for the simple reason that, by the time the worker
is entitled to sue for the cancer, the funds available for compensation in all likelihood will have disappeared, depleted by
verdicts awarding damages for unrealized fear, verdicts the
majority is so willing to embrace.

This Court has recognized the danger that no compensation will be available for those with severe injuries caused
by asbestos. See Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521

U. S., at 632 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and dissentingin part). In fact the Court already has framed the question
that should guide its resolution of this case:

"In a world of limited resources, would a rule permitting
immediate large-scale recoveries for widespread emo-tional distress caused by fear of future disease diminish

the likelihood of recovery by those who later suffer fromthe disease?"

Metro-North Commuter R. Co. v. Buckley, 521 U. S. 424, 435-436 (1997).

The Court ignores this question and its warning. It is only
a matter of time before inability to pay for real illness comesto pass. The Court's imprudent ruling will have been a contributing cause to this injustice.Asbestos litigation has driven 57 companies, which employed hundreds of thousands of people, into bankruptcy,including 26 companies that have become insolvent since
January 1, 2000. See RAND Institute for Civil Justice,
S. Carroll et al., Asbestos Litigation Costs and Compensa-tion: An Interim Report 71 (2002), Petitioner's Supplemental

Lodging, p. SL82. With each bankruptcy the remaining de-fendants come under greater financial strain, see Edley &

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
tion to allow recovery for fear of future illness is antitheti-cal to FELA's goals of ensuring compensation for injuries.

Cf. Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Gottshall, 512 U. S.532, 555 (1994) (describing FELA's "central focus on physical
perils"); Metro-North, supra, at 430 (noting that Gottshallrelied upon cases involving "a threatened physical contact
that caused, or might have caused, immediate traumaticharm"). As a consequence of the majority's decision, it is
more likely that those with the worst injuries from exposureto asbestos will find they are without remedy because those
with lesser, and even problematic, injuries will have ex-hausted the resources for payment. Today's decision is not
employee protecting; it is employee threatening.

II
When the Court asks whether the rule it adopts has beensettled by the common law, the answer, in my view, must be

no. The issue before us is new and unsettled, as is evidentfrom the diverse approaches of state and federal courts to
this problem. In its comprehensive discussion, the majoritycites some authorities that, it must be acknowledged, could
be interpreted to support the Court's position. The resultit reaches, however, is far from inevitable, and the rule the
majority derives does not comport with our responsibility todevelop a federal common law that administers FELA in an
effective, principled way. A

I disagree with the Court's conclusion that damages forfear of cancer may be recovered as part of the pain and suffering caused by asbestosis. Ante, at 148. The majorityobserves that a person who suffers from "a disease" may
recover for all "related" emotional distress. Ante, at 147(courts

" `do permit a plaintiff who suffers from a disease torecover for related negligently caused emotional distress' "

(quoting Metro-North, supra, at 432)). While that may betrue as a general matter, it begs the question: What relation538US1 Unit: $U32 [10-28-04 13:21:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

171Cite as: 538 U. S. 135 (2003)
Opinion of Kennedy, J.
ship between a disease and associated emotional distressshould entitle a person to compensation for the distress as

pain and suffering?The Court's precedent applying FELA provides the answer. To qualify as compensable pain and suffering, a per-son's emotional distress must be the direct consequence of
an injury or condition. See Gottshall, 512 U. S., at 544
("[T]hese terms traditionally have been used to describesensations stemming directly from a physical injury or condition" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Damages foremotional harms that are less direct may be recovered only
pursuant to a stand-alone tort action for negligent infliction
of emotional distress. Ibid. (defining negligently inflicted
emotional distress as "mental or emotional harm (such as
fright or anxiety) that is caused by the negligence of another
and that is not directly brought about by a physical injury").

The common law accords with this rule. The weight of
authority defines pain and suffering as emotional distress
that is the direct consequence of an injury. See Minneman,
Future Disease or Condition, or Anxiety Relating Thereto,
as Element of Recovery, 50 A. L. R. 4th 13, 25 (1986) ("[T]he
fear that an existing injury will lead to the future onset of
an as yet unrealized disease or condition is an element of
recovery only where such distress . . . is the natural consequence of, or reasonably expected to flow from, the injury");
see also Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 456(a) (1963-1964)
(hereinafter Restatement) (tortfeasor liable for "fright,
shock, or other emotional disturbance resulting from the
bodily harm or from the conduct which causes it").

This category of emotional distress includes certain types
of fears. The fright that accompanies a dog bite or a radiation burn, for example, may be said to result from an injury
because it arises without any intervening cause, such as a
medical examination. See The Lord Derby, 17 F. 265, 267
(ED La. 1883) ("To many people the shock to the system
resulting from the most insignificant bite of a dog drawing

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
blood is such that no money compensation is adequate").The passage in the Restatement deeming compensable "emotional disturbance resulting from the bodily harm or fromthe conduct which causes it," $ 456(a), refers, as the official
commentary makes clear, to this sort of instantaneous emo-tional trauma arising from the tortious act. See

id., Comment e ("Thus one who is struck by a negligently driven
automobile and suffers a broken leg may recover not only forhis pain, grief, or worry resulting from the broken leg, but

also for his fright at seeing the car about to hit him").Other, less immediate fears also might qualify as pain and
suffering, but only if they are the direct result of an injury.
See id., $ 456, Comment d (clarifying that recovery is "not
limited to immediate emotional disturbance accompanying
the bodily harm, or following at once from it, but includes
also subsequent emotional disturbance brought about by the
bodily harm itself ").

Applying these standards to the instant case, I do not
think the brooding, contemplative fear the respondents allege can be called a direct result of their asbestosis. Unlike
shortness of breath or other discomfort asbestosis may cause,
their fear does not arise from the presence of disease in their
lungs. Instead, the respondents' fear is the product of
learning from a doctor about their asbestosis, receiving information (perhaps at a much later time) about the conditions
that correlate with this disease, and then contemplating how
these possible conditions might affect their lives.

The majority nevertheless would permit recovery because
"[t]here is an undisputed relationship between exposure to
asbestos sufficient to cause asbestosis, and asbestos-related
cancer." Ante, at 154. To state that some relationship exists without examining whether the relationship is enough to
support recovery, however, ignores the central issue in this
case. There is a fundamental premise in this case--conceded, as I understand it, by all parties--and it is this: There
is no demonstrated causal link between asbestosis and can538US1 Unit: $U32 [10-28-04 13:21:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

173Cite as: 538 U. S. 135 (2003)
Opinion of Kennedy, J.
cer. See Churg & Green, Pathology of Occupational LungDisease, at 313. The incidence of asbestosis correlates with

the less-frequent incidence of cancer among exposed work-ers,

ibid., but this does not suffice. Correlation is not causation. Absent causation, it is difficult to conceive why asbes-tosis is any more than marginally more suitable a predicate

for recovering for fear of cancer than the fact of mere exposure. This correlation the Court relies upon does not estab-lish a direct link between asbestosis and asbestos-related

cancer, and it does not suffice under common-law precedentsas a predicate condition for recovery of damages based
upon fear.

It must be conceded that courts in some common-law jurisdictions have ruled that fear of cancer is compensable as pain
and suffering before the cancer is diagnosed, but the majority's extensive citations are not that persuasive. The Court
collects cases from 12 jurisdictions that comport with its result, but only 5 of these were decided by the high court of a
State. Ante, at 150-151, and n. 11. Moreover, three would
allow recovery for fear of cancer predicated upon mere exposure to asbestos, see Denton v. Southern R. Co., 854 S. W.

reject, ante, at 153-156, and n. 14. In the end, cases fromonly five of those jurisdictions support the majority's analysis, none of them decided by a state high court.On the other hand, as the majority acknowledges, some
courts have ruled that fear of cancer should not be compensa-ble as pain and suffering. Ante, at 151-152, n. 11. These
decisions are based, in part, upon the "separate disease rule,"which allows a person who has recovered for injuries resulting from asbestosis to bring a new lawsuit--notwithstandingthe traditional common-law proscription against splitting a
cause of action--if cancer develops. See Wilson v. JohnsManville Sales Corp., 684 F. 2d 111, 120-121 (CADC 1982)(Ginsburg, J.). The rule has been adopted by a majority of

jurisdictions, see Henderson & Twerski, Asbestos LitigationGone Mad: Exposure-Based Recovery for Increased Risk,
Mental Distress, and Medical Monitoring, 53 S. C. L. Rev.815, 821, and n. 22 (2002) (collecting cases), and the Court
does not suggest that it would not apply in cases broughtunder FELA.

The separate disease rule is pertinent for at least two rea-sons. First, it illustrates that courts have found it necessary
to construct fair and sensible common-law rules for resolvingthe problems particular to asbestos litigation. Second, it establishes that a person with asbestosis will not be without aremedy for pain and suffering caused by cancer. That person can and will be compensated if the cancer develops.This eliminates the need courts might otherwise perceive to
avert the danger that relief might be foreclosed in the future.The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania reached this conclusion, and its reasoning deserves attention when the Courtsuggests the common law is so well settled:

"[D]amages for fear of cancer are speculative. Theawarding of such damages would lead to inequitable results since those who never contract cancer would obtaindamages even though the disease never came into
fruition.. . . . .

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
"In any case, Appellants are not left without a remedy
for their mental anguish. [Pennsylvania case law] permits an action to be commenced if cancer develops. It
is in this action that Appellants can assert their emotional distress or mental anguish claims. To allow the
asbestos plaintiff in a non-cancer claim to recover for
any part of the damages relating to cancer, including the
fear of contracting cancer, erodes the integrity of and
purpose behind the [separate] disease rule." Simmons
v. Pacor, Inc., 543 Pa. 664, 677-678, 674 A. 2d 232, 238-
239 (1996).

This analysis is persuasive because it accounts, in a way
that the majority's decision does not, for changes already underway in common-law rules for compensating victims of a
disease with a long latency period. This approach surely is
more likely to result in an equitable allotment of compensation than the decision of the Court; and this is the rule the
Court should adopt to govern the availability of damages for
fear of cancer under FELA.

Pennsylvania is not alone in rejecting the majority's view.
In a careful opinion applying California law, the United
States District Court for the Northern District of California
held that parasitic damages for fear of cancer may be recovered only where there is a verifiable causal nexus between
the injury suffered and the cancer feared. Barron v.
Martin-Marietta Corp., 868 F. Supp. 1203, 1211-1212 (1994).
The court recognized that California courts had not yet addressed the type of physical injury that would permit compensation for fear of cancer, see id., at 1210, n. 9, but it determined that the requirement of a causal nexus was a clear
implication of recent California Supreme Court precedent,
see id., at 1212 (citing Potter v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co.,
6 Cal. 4th 965, 863 P. 2d 795 (1993)). The justification for
this prerequisite is significant in this case as well:

176 NORFOLK & WESTERN R. CO. v. AYERS

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
"If no nexus were required between cancer and an al-leged injury, an injury akin to a spinal puncture, serious

but unrelated to cancer, would admit recovery of para-sitic damages for fear of cancer. Indeed, any serious
physical injury, however unrelated to cancer, would per-mit fear-of-cancer damages." 868 F. Supp., at 1211.

The proofs offered by the claimants in Barron were insuffi-cient on summary judgment to meet that burden under California law, and the respondents in today's case also would beincapable of recovering under that standard.

Other common-law authorities the majority cites do notcompel a contrary result. It is of no help to the respondents
that "mental anguish related to a physical injury is recover-able even if `the underlying future prospect is not itself compensable inasmuch as it is not sufficiently likely to occur.' "
Ante, at 149 (quoting Minneman, 50 A. L. R. 4th, at 25).This principle cannot sustain an award when, as here, there

is a tangential, and no causal, relationship between the pres-ent injury suffered and the future disease feared. Ibid.
("Thus, damages for mental anguish concerning the chancethat a future disease or condition will result from an original
injury are generally not recoverable where the connectionbetween the anxiety and the existing injury is too remote
or tenuous").The respondents' characterization, furthermore, finds no
support in the part of the Restatement quoted by the major-ity.

Ante, at 154 ("[A] negligent actor is answerable in dam-ages for emotional disturbance `resulting from the bodily

harm or from the conduct which causes it' " (quoting Re-statement $ 456(a))). As described supra, at 171-172, the
commentary suggests that this statement would allow recov-ery for direct or immediate emotional trauma resulting from
a tortious act, see Restatement $ 456(a), Comment e. Therespondents do not claim to have experienced any shock or
trauma arising from their exposure to asbestos or from theonset of their asbestosis. With almost no variation, they

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
complained only of concern, for which the Restatement provides no guidance as to whether damages should be awarded.

More important, while the disagreement among state
courts about how to address this problem is telling, it is important to keep in mind the nature of the Court's responsibility under FELA. The implementation of the Act is a matter
of federal common law, see Urie v. Thompson, 337 U. S. 163,
173 (1949), and it is for the Court to develop and administer
a fair and workable rule of decision, see Brady v. Southern
R. Co., 320 U. S. 476, 479 (1943) ("[T]he question must be
determined by this Court finally"); see also Gottshall, 512
U. S., at 558 (Souter, J., concurring) ("That duty is to develop a federal common law of negligence under FELA, informed by reference to the evolving common law"). Statecourt precedent is not dispositive. See Dice v. Akron, C. &
Y. R. Co., 342 U. S. 359, 361 (1952) ("State laws are not controlling in determining what the incidents of this federal
right shall be"). Instead, the Court is bound only by the
terms of FELA and its own precedent giving meaning to the
Act. Within those constraints, the Court must endeavor to
arrive at the correct rule--a rule that is just and practical--
rather than the majority rule or the rule of the Restatement.

These considerations establish the proper rule for the case.
Although the anxiety generated by an increased awareness
about a disease may be real and painful, it lacks the direct
link to a physical injury that suffices for recovery. Cf.
Metro-North, 521 U. S., at 432 (denying fear-of-cancer recovery where condition "causes emotional distress only because
the worker learns that he may become ill after a substantial
period of time"). The respondents' entitlement to compensation for their fear of cancer turns upon their ability to
make out a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress; and they cannot do so.

B
If viewed as alleging negligent infliction of emotional dis-tress, the respondents' claims fail for the same reasons the

Court disallowed recovery in Metro-North. There, the em-ployee was exposed to massive amounts of asbestos for one
hour of each working day for three years. See id., at 427.He presented testimony about his fear of developing cancer.
Ibid. Two expert witnesses testified that the employee'sfear was at least reasonable because his exposure to asbestos
increased the likelihood of contracting cancer, after discount-ing for a 15-year tobacco habit, by between one and five percent. Ibid.Despite these indications of genuine emotional distress,
the Court held the exposure did not satisfy the "zone of dan-ger" test and denied any recovery for fear of cancer. Id.,
at 430. The Court explained that the claim implicated thetraditional concerns underlying common-law restrictions
upon recovery for emotional distress. See id., at 433. Thedistress the employee alleged, including his emotional reaction to an incremental, increased risk of dying from cancer,was beyond the ability of a jury to evaluate with precision,
heightening the danger that damages would be based uponspeculation or caprice, see id., at 435.

The respondents' claims implicate these considerations tothe same or greater degree than in

Metro-North. Each re-spondent seeks damages for his emotional response to being

told he has an increased likelihood of dying. Ibid. The ex-tent of the distress the respondents suffered is not calculable
with a precision sufficient to permit juries to award damages,for the distress is simply incremental from the fears already
shared by the general population.The respondents observe, with extensive support in the
medical literature, that a person with asbestosis has a 10percent chance of developing mesothelioma, and that 39 percent of smokers with asbestosis develop fatal lung cancer;that cohort, however, drops to 5 percent, at most, for non538US1 Unit: $U32 [10-28-04 13:21:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
smokers with asbestosis. While these statistics might atfirst appear to provide the beginning of an argument for giving asbestosis sufferers recovery for fear, the average Amer-ican male has a 44 percent chance of developing cancer during the course of his life, and his chance of dying from someform of cancer is more than 21 percent. See L. Ries et al.,
National Cancer Institute, SEER Cancer Statistics Rev.,
1973-1999, Tables I-15, I-16 (2002), available at http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1973_1999/overview.pdf (as visited Feb. 10,

2003) (available in Clerk of Court's case file). This literaturealso suggests that a person who smokes has more than a 50
percent chance of dying from a disease caused by tobacco
use, see National Cancer Institute, Changes in CigaretteRelated Disease Risks & Their Implication for Prevention
and Control, Smoking & Tobacco Control Monograph, No. 8,
1997, p. xi, Table 1, a risk that all but one of the respondents
has incurred that is wholly separate from their exposure to
asbestos.

It is beyond the ability of juries to derive from statistics
like these a fair estimate of the danger caused by negligent
exposure to asbestos. See Metro-North, supra, at 435. For
this reason, the trial judge was correct to instruct the jury
that they could not award the respondents any damages for
cancer or for an increased risk of cancer. In disallowing recovery for risk but allowing recovery for fear based on that
risk, however, the trial judge attempted to avoid speculation
at the outset but succumbed to added speculation in the end.
If instructing a jury to calculate an increased risk of cancer
invites speculation, then asking the jury to infer from its
estimate a rough sense of the fear based on the risk invites
speculation compounded.

The damages the jury awarded in this case indicate the
legitimacy of these concerns. As described above, supra, at
167, the respondents received damages of between $500,000
and $1.2 million despite having complained only that they
suffered shortness of breath and experienced varying de538US1 Unit: $U32 [10-28-04 13:21:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
grees of concern about cancer. This evidence of injury and
the compensation awarded is recited here not "to reweigh
evidence based on information not presented at trial," ante,
at 155, n. 15, or "to judge the sufficiency of the evidence
or the reasonableness of the damages awards," ante, at 159.
Rather, it is instructive as to what results in a single case
when a jury is charged with translating into dollar amounts
confusing and contested evidence about the nature of a complicated harm. It demonstrates the speculative, unreasoned
kind of award generated when a jury is presented vivid testimony about the agony of cancer, provided expert evidence
that a person's chances of developing that cancer have increased, but admonished that only the fear of that cancer--
and not the cancer itself, or a heightened risk of developing
cancer--is compensable.

The majority would allow such awards, but with the "important reservation" that a plaintiff must "prove that his alleged fear is genuine and serious." Ante, at 157. There is
no basis in our FELA jurisprudence for establishing this
burden of proof, and it would be a difficult standard for
judges to enforce. The Court has rejected the notion that
review for "genuineness" could ameliorate the threat of unlimited and unpredictable liability. See Gottshall, 512 U. S.,
at 552. In explaining its skepticism, the Court observed:

"Such a fact-specific test . . . would be bound to lead
to haphazard results. Judges would be forced to make
highly subjective determinations concerning the authenticity of claims for emotional injury, which are far less
susceptible to objective medical proof than are their
physical counterparts. To the extent the genuineness
test could limit potential liability, it could do so only
inconsistently. . . . In the context of claims for intangible
harms brought under a negligence statute, we find such
an arbitrary result unacceptable." Ibid.

181Cite as: 538 U. S. 135 (2003)
Opinion of Kennedy, J.
The Court's response to the possibility of speculative
awards is instead to adopt common-law rules restricting the
classes of plaintiffs eligible to seek recovery and the types
of emotional distress for which recovery is available. See
ibid.; see also Metro-North, 521 U. S., at 436. This is not to
say that allegations of emotional distress need not be genuine and serious in order to warrant compensation, but review
for genuineness alone does little or nothing to prevent capricious outcomes. Instead, the responsibility of today's Court
is not to review whether an individual claim alleging fear of
cancer is genuine and severe, but to adopt a rule that reconciles the need to provide compensation for deserving claimants with the concerns that speculative damages awards will
exhaust the resources available for recovery.

III
The Court, to be sure, does refer to the admonition in
Metro-North that common-law rules must be adopted to
avoid the risk of " `unlimited and unpredictable liability.' "
Id., at 433 (quoting Gottshall, supra, at 557). Yet the rule
it adopts is an unreasoned rule of limitation--a rule that does
not advance the goal of ensuring that fair and sensible principles will govern recovery for injuries caused by asbestos.

The majority ends its opinion with a plea for legislative
intervention, ante, at 166, an entreaty made before, see Ortiz
v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U. S. 815, 821 (1999); id., at 865
(Rehnquist, C. J., concurring); id., at 866-867 (Breyer, J.,
dissenting). This case arises under FELA, however, by
which Congress has directed the courts, and ultimately this
Court, to use their resources to develop equitable rules of
decision. It is regrettable that the Court today does not
accept that responsibility.

These reasons explain my dissent from Part III of the
Court's opinion.

182 NORFOLK & WESTERN R. CO. v. AYERS

Opinion of Breyer, J.
Justice Breyer, concurring in part and dissenting inpart.

I join Parts I, II, and IV of the Court's opinion. I agreewith

Justice Kennedy, however, that the law does not per-mit recovery for "fear of cancer" in this case. And I join his

opinion dissenting from Part III. Because the issue is aclose and difficult one, I mention several considerations that,
in my mind, tip the balance.Unlike the majority, I do not believe that the Restatement
(Second) of Torts (1963-1964) (hereinafter Second Restate-ment) comes close to determining the correct answer to the
legal question before us. Cf. ante, at 148-149, 154 (majorityopinion). The Second Restatement sets forth a general rule
of recovery for "fright, shock, or other emotional disturb-ance" where an "actor's negligent conduct has so caused any
bodily harm to another as to make him liable for" it. $ 456.But the Second Restatement neither gives a definition of the
kind of "emotional disturbance" for which recovery is avail-able nor otherwise states that recovery is available for any
kind of emotional disturbance whatsoever. Ibid.The underlying history underscores the openness of the
legal question and the consequent uncertainty as to the answer. When Congress enacted the Federal Employers' Lia-bility Act (FELA) in 1908, 45 U. S. C. $$ 51-60, the kinds of

injury that it primarily had in mind were those resultingdirectly from physical accidents, such as railway collisions
and entanglement with machinery. See Consolidated Rail
Corporation v. Gottshall, 512 U. S. 532, 542 (1994). And
(where negligent conduct was at issue) the Restatementnearest in time to FELA's enactment (and therefore presumably likely to be more reflective of the background rules thatFELA then assumed, cf.

id., at 554-555) limited recovery for
related emotional distress to concrete harm resulting fromthat distress. Restatement of Torts $ 456 (1934) (hereinafter Restatement). In particular, this earlier Restatement
restricted recovery to "physical harm resulting . . . from

538US1 Unit: $U32 [10-28-04 13:21:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

183Cite as: 538 U. S. 135 (2003)
Opinion of Breyer, J.
fright or shock or other similar and immediate emotional dis-turbance" substantially caused by the underlying injury or

negligent conduct. Ibid.The later Second Restatement reflects subsequent court
decisions that liberalized this rule--(in the earlier Restate-ment's words) by extending recovery beyond "physical
harm" produced by "emotional disturbance," and by removing the words "similar and immediate." $ 456. Linguisti-cally speaking, these changes to the Restatement

might
reflect judicial extensi on of the scope of "emoti onaldisturbance" far beyond "expectable" or "intended" fears

that nor ma l ly accompany, say, a col l isi on or other

machinery-related accident, Second Restatement $ 905, Comment e, p. 458 (1977). They might reflect judicial extension
of liability to the kind of "brooding, contemplative fear" at
issue here, ante, at 172 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and
dissenting in part). But they also might reflect more limited judicial holdings--say, holdings that extend liability to
fears that arise directly from the compensable injury itself
(e. g., the fear of "shortness of breath," App. 298-299) or
which arise directly from the conduct that caused the injury
(say, the fear of inhaling asbestos fibers in a visible cloud of
dust). The Second Restatement does not say.

Nor do the Second Restatement's examples resolve the
problem. The most expansive example of recovery involves
not worry connected with toxic torts or the like, but a considerably more restricted, directly connected worry "about the
securing of shelter for [one's self] and family" after "wanto[n]" eviction--the wantonness of the eviction being a special factor warranting particularly broad recovery. Second
Restatement $ 905, Illustration 8, at 458; see also id., $ 905,
Comment e, at 458.

Most important, different courts have come to different
conclusions about recovery for fear of cancer itself (even
when triggered by physical injury). The Restatements
are not statutes. They simply reflect predominant judicial

184 NORFOLK & WESTERN R. CO. v. AYERS

Opinion of Breyer, J.
views. And the variety of answers courts have given to thequestion at issue here demonstrates that courts have not

reached a consensus. See ante, at 150-151, and n. 11 (major-ity opinion);

ante, at 173-174 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).
Given the legal uncertainty, this Court, acting like anycourt interpreting the common law, see

ante, at 177 (opinion
of Kennedy, J.), should determine the proper rule of law
through reference to the underlying factors that have helpedto shape related "emotional distress" rules. Those factors

argue for the kind of liability limitation that Justice Kennedy has described, ibid.

First, the law in this area has sought to impose limitations
that separate valid, important emotional distress claims from
less important, trivial, or invalid claims. See Metro-North
Commuter R. Co. v. Buckley, 521 U. S. 424, 433 (1997). The
presence of physical harm often provides a central touchstone in this regard. But that does not work here. That is
because, given ordinary background risks, the increment in
a person's fear of cancer due to diagnosis of a condition such
as asbestosis seems virtually impossible to evaluate. See
ante, at 178-179 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). The evidence
(viewed in the plaintiffs' favor) indicates that, for a nonsmoker, a diagnosis of asbestosis may increase the perceived
risk of dying of cancer from something like the ordinary
background risk of about 22% (about two chances in nine) to
about one chance in three. See ante, at 155 (majority opinion); ante, at 178-179 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). See also L.
Ries et al., National Cancer Institute, SEER Cancer Statistics Rev., 1973-1999, Table I-16 (2002), available at http://
seer.cancer.gov/csr/1973_1999/overview.pdf (as visited Mar. 3,
2003) (available in Clerk of Court's case file). Would a reasonable person who is not already afraid of cancer when the
odds of dying are about two in nine suddenly develop a "genuine and serious" and "reasonable" fear when those odds
change to one in three? Would a smoker, a risktaker whose
conduct has already increased the chance of cancer death to,

say, about one in four, compare Cagle, Criteria for Attribut-ing Lung Cancer to Asbestos Exposure, 117 Am. J. Clin.

Path. 9 (2002), with Ries, supra, at Table I-16, and whosechance of dying of a smoking-related disease is already
about 50-50, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,Projected Smoking-Related Deaths Among Youth--United
States, 45 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 971
(1996), suddenly develop a reasonable, genuine, and seriousfear of cancer when the chance of cancer or smoking-related

death rises even further? There is simply no way to know,and it is close to impossible, in the ordinary case, to evaluate
a plaintiff 's affirmative answer.

Second, the law's recovery-limiting rules have sought
to avoid pure jury speculation, speculation that can produce "unlimited and unpredictable liability." Metro-North,
supra, at 433 (internal quotation marks omitted). How is
the jury, without speculation, to measure compensation for
the augmentation of a cancer fear from, say, two in nine to
one in three? Given the fact that most of us lead our lives
without compensation for fear of a 22% risk of cancer death,
Ries, supra, at Table I-16, what monetary value can one attach to an incrementally increased fear due to a risk, say,
of 30%? The problem here is not the unreality or lack of
seriousness of the fear. It may be all too real. The problem is the impossibility of knowing an appropriate compensation for asbestosis insofar as its appearance tears away that
veil of disregard that ordinarily shelters most of us from fear
of cancer, if not fear of death itself. The majority's verdict
control measures, ante, at 159, n. 19, will not help much in
this respect.

Third, it would be perverse to apply tort law's basic compensatory objectives in a way that compensated less serious
injuries at the expense of more serious harms. Yet, as Justice Kennedy points out, the majority's broad interpretation of the scope of compensable fears threatens to do precisely that. The kind of fear at issue here--a "brooding,

186 NORFOLK & WESTERN R. CO. v. AYERS

Opinion of Breyer, J.
contemplative fear," ante, at 172 (opinion of Kennedy, J.),brought about by knowledge of exposure to a substance, or

of a present condition, correlated with an elevated cancerrisk--is associated quite generally with negligent exposure
to toxic substances. In addition to generating fear of can-cer, such exposure may well produce large numbers of plaintiffs, serious injuries, and large monetary awards--all
against limited funds available for compensation. And, asthe history of asbestos litigation shows, such a combination

of circumstances can occur despite a threshold requirementof physical harm.

In such cases, as Justice Kennedy points out, a rule that
allows everyone who suffers some physical harm to recover
damages for fear of correlated cancer threatens, in practice,
to exhaust the funds available for those who develop cancer
in the future, including funds available to compensate for
fear of cancer that has actually developed. Ante, at 168-170.
It is estimated, for example, that asbestos litigation has already consumed over $50 billion and that the eventual cost
may substantially exceed $200 billion. RAND Institute for
Civil Justice, S. Carroll et al., Asbestos Litigation Costs and
Compensation: An Interim Report 81 (2002), Petitioner's
Supplemental Lodging, p. SL82 (hereinafter RAND Institute). The costs have driven dozens of companies into bankruptcy. Ante, at 169 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). They have
also largely exhausted certain funds set aside for asbestos
claimants--reducing the Johns-Manville Trust for asbestos
claimants, for example, from a fund that promised to pay
100% of the value of liquidated claims to a fund that now
pays only 5%. RAND Institute 79-80. The concern that
tomorrow's actual cancer victims will recover nothing--for
medical costs, pain, or fear--is genuine. Cf. ante, at 170
(opinion of Kennedy, J.). And that genuine concern requires this Court to make hard choices. Members of this
Court have indicated that Congress should enact legislation
to help resolve the asbestos problem. See, e. g., Ortiz v. Fi538US1 Unit: $U32 [10-28-04 13:21:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

187Cite as: 538 U. S. 135 (2003)
Opinion of Breyer, J.
breboard Corp., 527 U. S. 815, 865 (1999) (Rehnquist, C. J.,concurring). Congress has not responded. But that lack of

response does not require the courts to ignore the practicalproblems that threaten the achievement of tort law's basic
compensatory objectives. In this case, those concerns favora legal rule that will permit future cancer victims to recover
for their injuries, including emotional suffering, even if thatrecovery comes at the expense of limiting the recovery for
fear of cancer available to those suffering some presentharm.

For these reasons, I would accept the majority's limita-tions on recovery,

ante, at 157, while adding further restric-tions to rule out recovery for fear of disease when the following conditions are met: (1) actual development of the diseasecan neither be expected nor ruled out for many years;
(2) fear of the disease is separately compensable if the dis-ease occurs; and (3) fear of the disease is based upon risks
not significantly different in kind from the background risksthat all individuals face. Where these conditions hold,
I believe the law generally rules out recovery for fear ofcancer. This is not to say that fear of cancer is never reimbursable. The conditions above may not hold. Even whenthey do, I would, consistent with the sense of the common
law, permit recovery where the fear of cancer is unusuallysevere--where it significantly and detrimentally affects the
plaintiff 's ability to carry on with everyday life and work.Cf.

CITY OF CUYAHOGA FALLS, OHIO, et al. v. BUCKEYE COMMUNITY HOPE FOUNDATION et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 01-1269. Argued January 21, 2003--Decided March 25, 2003
After the City Council of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio (hereinafter City), passed

a site-plan ordinance authorizing construction of a low-income housing
complex by respondents--a nonprofit corporation dedicated to developing affordable housing and related parties--a group of citizens filed a
formal petition requesting that the ordinance be repealed or submitted
to a popular vote. Pursuant to the City's charter, the referendum petition stayed the site plan's implementation until its approval by the voters. An Ohio court denied respondents an injunction against the petition, and the city engineer, on advice from the city law director, denied
their request for building permits. The voters eventually passed the
referendum, thus repealing the ordinance. Subsequently, the Ohio Supreme Court declared the referendum invalid under Ohio's Constitution,
the City issued the building permits, and construction commenced.
While the state litigation was still pending, respondents filed a federal
suit against the City and its officials, seeking an injunction ordering the
City to issue the building permits, as well as declaratory and monetary
relief. They claimed that by submitting the site plan to voters, the City
and its officials violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses
of the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as the Fair Housing Act. The
District Court, inter alia, denied the City's summary judgment motion.
After the Ohio Supreme Court invalidated the referendum, thus reducing the federal action to a claim for damages for the construction delay,
the District Court granted the City and its officials summary judgment.
In reversing, the Sixth Circuit found that respondents had produced
sufficient evidence to go to trial on the allegation that the City, by allowing the petition to stay the site plan's implementation, gave effect to
the racial bias reflected in the public's opposition to the project; that
respondents had stated a valid Fair Housing Act claim because the
City's actions had a disparate impact based on race and family status;
and that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the City
had engaged in arbitrary and irrational government conduct in violation
of substantive due process.

Held:

1. Respondents have not presented an equal protection claim that can
survive summary judgment. Proof of racially discriminatory intent is
required to show an Equal Protection Clause violation. Arlington
Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 265.
Because respondents claim injury from the referendum petitioning process, not from the referendum itself--which never went into effect--
cases in which this Court has subjected enacted, discretionary measures
to equal protection scrutiny and treated decisionmakers' statements as
evidence of intent, see, e. g., Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc.,
473 U. S. 432, 448, are inapposite. Neither of the official acts respondents challenge reflects the intent required to support equal protection
liability. In submitting the referendum petition to the public, the City
acted pursuant to the requirement of its charter, which sets out a facially neutral petitioning procedure, and the city engineer, in refusing
to issue the permits, performed a nondiscretionary, ministerial act consistent with the City Charter. Respondents point to no evidence suggesting that these acts were themselves motivated by racial animus.
While they and the Sixth Circuit cite evidence of allegedly discriminatory voter sentiment, statements made by private individuals during a
citizen-driven petition drive do not, in and of themselves, constitute
state action for Fourteenth Amendment purposes. And respondents
did not offer evidence that the private motives behind the referendum
drive are fairly attributable to the State. See Blum v. Yaretsky, 457
U. S. 991, 1004. In fact, by adhering to charter procedures, city officials
enabled public debate on the referendum to take place, thus advancing
significant First Amendment interests. Respondents' alternative theory--that city officials acted in concert with private citizens to prevent
the complex from being built because of the race and family status
of the likely residents--was not addressed below and apparently was
disavowed by respondents at oral argument. Moreover, respondents never articulated a cognizable legal claim on such grounds. Pp.
194-198.

2. Subjecting the ordinance to the City's referendum process did not
constitute arbitrary government conduct in violation of substantive due
process. Both of respondents' due process claims lack merit. First,
the city engineer's refusal to issue the building permits while the petition was pending in no sense constituted egregious or arbitrary government conduct denying respondents the benefit of the site plan. In light
of the charter's provision that no challenged ordinance can go into effect
until approved by the voters, the law director's instruction to the engineer represented an eminently rational directive. Indeed, the site plan,
by law, could not be implemented until the voters passed on the referen538US1 Unit: $U33 [10-26-04 18:52:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN

dum. Respondents' second theory--that the city's submission of an administrative land-use determination to the charter's referendum procedures constituted per se arbitrary conduct--has no basis in this Court's
precedent. The people retain the power to govern through referendum
with respect to any matter, legislative or administrative, within the
realm of local affairs. Eastlake v. Forest City Enterprises, Inc., 426
U. S. 668, 674, n. 9. Though a referendum's substantive result may be
invalid if it is arbitrary or capricious, respondents do not challenge the
referendum itself. Pp. 198-199.

3. Because respondents have abandoned their Fair Housing Act disparate impact claim, the Sixth Circuit's disparate impact holding is vacated, and the case is remanded with instructions to dismiss the relevant
portion of the complaint. Pp. 199-200.

Opinion of the Court
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
In 1995, the city of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio (hereinafterCity), submitted to voters a facially neutral referendum petition that called for the repeal of a municipal housing ordi-nance authorizing construction of a low-income housing complex. The United States Court of Appeals for the SixthCircuit found genuine issues of material fact with regard to
whether the City violated the Equal Protection Clause, theDue Process Clause, and the Fair Housing Act, 82 Stat. 81,
as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 3601 et seq., by placing the petitionon the ballot. We granted certiorari to determine whether
the Sixth Circuit erred in ruling that respondents' suitagainst the City could proceed to trial.

I
A
In June 1995, respondents Buckeye Community HopeFoundation, a nonprofit corporation dedicated to developing

affordable housing through the use of low-income tax credits,and others (hereinafter Buckeye or respondents), purchased
land zoned for apartments in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. In Feb-ruary 1996, Buckeye submitted a site plan for Pleasant
Meadows, a multifamily, low-income housing complex, to thecity planning commission. Residents of Cuyahoga Falls immediately expressed opposition to the proposal. See 263F. 3d 627, 630 (CA6 2001). After respondents agreed to various conditions, including that respondents build an earthenwall surrounded by a fence on one side of the complex, the
commission unanimously approved the site plan and submit-ted it to the city council for final authorization.

As the final approval process unfolded, public oppositionto the plan resurfaced and eventually coalesced into a referTrehan, and Robert G. Schwemm; and for the National Multi Housing

endum petition drive. See Cuyahoga Falls City Charter,Art. 9, $ 2, App. 14 (giving voters "the power to approve or

reject at the polls any ordinance or resolution passed by theCouncil" within 30 days of the ordinance's passage). At city
council meetings and independent gatherings, some of whichthe mayor attended to express his personal opposition to the
site plan, citizens of Cuyahoga Falls voiced various concerns:
that the development would cause crime and drug activityto escalate, that families with children would move in, and

that the complex would attract a population similar to theone on Prange Drive, the City's only African-American
neighborhood. See, e. g., 263 F. 3d, at 636-637; App. 98, 139,
191; Tr. 182-185, 270, 316. Nevertheless, because the plan
met all municipal zoning requirements, the city council approved the project on April 1, 1996, through City Ordinance No. 48-1996.

On April 29, a group of citizens filed a formal petition with
the City requesting that the ordinance be repealed or submitted to a popular vote. Pursuant to the charter, which
provides that an ordinance challenged by a petition "shall
[not] go into effect until approved by a majority" of voters,
the filing stayed the implementation of the site plan. Art. 9,

$ 2, App. 15. On April 30, respondents sought an injunction
against the petition in state court, arguing that the Ohio
Constitution does not authorize popular referendums on administrative matters. On May 31, the Court of Common
Pleas denied the injunction. Civ. No. 96-05-1701 (Summit
County), App. to Pet. for Cert. 255a. A month later, respondents nonetheless requested building permits from the
City in order to begin construction. On June 26, the city
engineer rejected the request after being advised by the city
law director that the permits "could not be issued because
the site plan ordinance `does not take effect' due to the petitions." 263 F. 3d, at 633.

In November 1996, the voters of Cuyahoga Falls passed
the referendum, thus repealing Ordinance No. 48-1996. In

Opinion of the Court
a joint stipulation, however, the parties agreed that theresults of the election would not be certified until the litigation over the referendum was resolved. See Stipulationand Jointly Agreed upon Preliminary Injunction Order in
No. 5:96 CV 1458 (ND Ohio, Nov. 25, 1996). In July 1998,the Ohio Supreme Court, having initially concluded that
the referendum was proper, reversed itself and declaredthe referendum unconstitutional. 82 Ohio St. 3d 539, 697
N. E. 2d 181 (holding that the Ohio State Constitution au-thorizes referendums only in relation to legislative acts, not
administrative acts, such as the site-plan ordinance). TheCity subsequently issued the building permits, and Buckeye
commenced construction of Pleasant Meadows.

B
In July 1996, with the state-court litigation still pending,respondents filed suit in federal court against the City and

several city officials, seeking an injunction ordering the Cityto issue the building permits, as well as declaratory and monetary relief. Buckeye alleged that "in allowing a site planapproval ordinance to be submitted to the electors of Cuyahoga Falls through a referendum and in rejecting [its] appli-cation for building permits," the City and its officials violated
the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Four-teenth Amendment, as well as the Fair Housing Act, 42
U. S. C. $ 3601. Complaint in No. 5:96 CV 1458 || 1 (ND Ohio,July 5, 1996) (hereinafter Complaint). In June 1997, the
District Court dismissed the case against the mayor in hisindividual capacity but denied the City's motion for summary
judgment on the equal protection and due process claims,concluding that genuine issues of material fact existed as
to both claims. 970 F. Supp. 1289, 1308 (ND Ohio 1997).After the Ohio Supreme Court declared the referendum invalid in 1998, thus reducing respondents' action to a claimfor damages for the delay in construction, the City and its
officials again moved for summary judgment. On November

Opinion of the Court

19, 1999, the District Court granted the motion on all counts.Civ. No. 5:96 CV 1458, App. to Pet. for Cert. 35a.

The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed. Asto respondents' equal protection claim, the court concluded
that they had produced sufficient evidence to go to trial onthe allegation that the City, by allowing the referendum petition to stay the implementation of the site plan, gave effectto the racial bias reflected in the public's opposition to the
project. See 263 F. 3d, at 639. The court then held thateven if respondents failed to prove intentional discrimination, they stated a valid claim under the Fair Housing Acton the theory that the City's actions had a disparate impact
based on race and family status. See id., at 640. Finally,the court concluded that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the City, by denying respondents thebenefit of the lawfully approved site plan, engaged in arbitrary and irrational government conduct in violation of sub-stantive due process.

Id., at 644. We granted certiorari,536 U. S. 938 (2002), and now reverse the constitutional holdings and vacate the Fair Housing Act holding.

II
Respondents allege that by submitting the petition to thevoters and refusing to issue building permits while the petition was pending, the City and its officials violated the EqualProtection Clause. See Complaint || 41. Petitioners claim
that the Sixth Circuit went astray by ascribing the motiva-tions of a handful of citizens supportive of the referendum to
the City. We agree with petitioners that respondents havefailed to present sufficient evidence of an equal protection
violation to survive summary judgment.We have made clear that "[p]roof of racially discriminatory
intent or purpose is required" to show a violation of theEqual Protection Clause. Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 265 (1977)(citing

Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229 (1976)). In decid538US1 Unit: $U33 [10-26-04 18:52:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN

195Cite as: 538 U. S. 188 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
ing the equal protection question, the Sixth Circuit erred inrelying on cases in which we have subjected enacted, discretionary measures to equal protection scrutiny and treateddecisionmakers' statements as evidence of such intent. See
263 F. 3d, at 634-635 (citing Cleburne v. Cleburne Living
Center, Inc., 473 U. S. 432, 448 (1985); Arlington Heights v.
Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., supra, at 268;
and Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U. S. 385, 392 (1969)). Becauserespondents claim injury from the referendum petitioning

process and not from the referendum itself--which neverwent into effect--these cases are inapposite. Ultimately,
neither of the official acts respondents challenge reflects the
intent required to support equal protection liability.

First, in submitting the referendum petition to the voters,
the City acted pursuant to the requirements of its charter,
which sets out a facially neutral petitioning procedure. See
Art. 9, $ 2. By placing the referendum on the ballot, the
City did not enact the referendum and therefore cannot be
said to have given effect to voters' allegedly discriminatory
motives for supporting the petition. Similarly, the city engineer, in refusing to issue the building permits while the referendum was still pending, performed a nondiscretionary,
ministerial act. He acted in response to the city law director's instruction that the building permits "could not . . .
issue" because the charter prohibited a challenged site-plan
ordinance from going into effect until "approved by a majority of those voting thereon," App. 16. See 263 F. 3d, at 633.
Respondents point to no evidence suggesting that these official acts were themselves motivated by racial animus. Respondents do not, for example, offer evidence that the City
followed the obligations set forth in its charter because of
the referendum's discriminatory purpose, or that city officials
would have selectively refused to follow standard charter
procedures in a different case.

Instead, to establish discriminatory intent, respondents
and the Sixth Circuit both rely heavily on evidence of alleg538US1 Unit: $U33 [10-26-04 18:52:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN
196 CUYAHOGA FALLS v. BUCKEYE COMMUNITY

Opinion of the Court

edly discriminatory voter sentiment. See id., at 635-637.But statements made by private individuals in the course of

a citizen-driven petition drive, while sometimes relevant toequal protection analysis, see

supra, at 194, do not, in and of
themselves, constitute state action for the purposes of theFourteenth Amendment. Cf.

Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U. S.
991, 1002-1003 (1982) (" `[T]he principle has become firmly
embedded in our constitutional law that the action inhibitedby the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment is only

such action as may fairly be said to be that of the States' "(quoting

Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1, 13 (1948))). Moreover, respondents put forth no evidence that the "private
motives [that] triggered" the referendum drive "can fairly be
attributed to the State." Blum v. Yaretsky, supra, at 1004.

In fact, by adhering to charter procedures, city officials
enabled public debate on the referendum to take place, thus
advancing significant First Amendment interests. In assessing the referendum as a "basic instrument of democratic
government," Eastlake v. Forest City Enterprises, Inc., 426
U. S. 668, 679 (1976), we have observed that "[p]rovisions for
referendums demonstrate devotion to democracy, not to bias,
discrimination, or prejudice," James v. Valtierra, 402 U. S.
137, 141 (1971). And our well established First Amendment
admonition that "government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself
offensive or disagreeable," Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397,
414 (1989), dovetails with the notion that all citizens, regardless of the content of their ideas, have the right to petition
their government. Cf. Meyer v. Grant, 486 U. S. 414, 421-
422 (1988) (describing the circulation of an initiative petition
as " `core political speech' "); Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 96 (1972) ("[G]overnment may not grant the
use of a forum to people whose views it finds acceptable, but
deny use to those wishing to express less favored or more
controversial views"). Again, statements made by decisionmakers or referendum sponsors during deliberation over a

538US1 Unit: $U33 [10-26-04 18:52:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN

197Cite as: 538 U. S. 188 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
referendum may constitute relevant evidence of discrimina-tory intent in a challenge to an ultimately enacted initiative.

See, e. g., Washington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 458 U. S.457, 471 (1982) (considering statements of initiative sponsors
in subjecting enacted referendum to equal protection scru-tiny);

Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S., at 268. But respondents do not
challenge an enacted referendum.In their brief to this Court, respondents offer an alternative theory of equal protection liability: that city officials, in-cluding the mayor, acted in concert with private citizens to
prevent Pleasant Meadows from being built because of the
race and family status of its likely residents. See Brief for
Respondents 12-26; Tr. of Oral Arg. 33-34, 36-40, 43. Respondents allege, among other things, that the city law director prompted disgruntled voters to file the petition, that the
city council intentionally delayed its deliberations to thwart
the development, and that the mayor stoked the public opposition. See Brief for Respondents 17. Not only did the
courts below not directly address this theory of liability, but
respondents also appear to have disavowed this claim at oral
argument, focusing instead on the denial of the permits.
See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37-38.

What is more, respondents never articulated a cognizable
legal claim on these grounds. Respondents fail to show that
city officials exercised any power over voters' decisionmaking during the drive, much less the kind of "coercive
power" either "overt or covert" that would render the voters' actions and statements, for all intents and purposes,
state action. Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U. S., at 1004. Nor, as
noted above, do respondents show that the voters' sentiments can be attributed in any way to the state actors
against which it has brought suit. See ibid. Indeed, in
finding a genuine issue of material fact with regard to intent,
the Sixth Circuit relied almost entirely on apparently independent statements by private citizens. See 263 F. 3d, at

HOPE FOUNDATION

Opinion of the Court

635-637. And in dismissing the claim against the mayor inhis individual capacity, the District Court found no evidence

that he orchestrated the referendum. See 970 F. Supp., at1321. Respondents thus fail to present an equal protection
claim sufficient to survive summary judgment.

III
In evaluating respondents' substantive due process claim,the Sixth Circuit found, as a threshold matter, that respondents had a legitimate claim of entitlement to the buildingpermits, and therefore a property interest in those permits,
in light of the city council's approval of the site plan. See263 F. 3d, at 642. The court then held that respondents had
presented sufficient evidence to survive summary judgmenton their claim that the City engaged in arbitrary conduct
by denying respondents the benefit of the plan. Id., at 644.Both in their complaint and before this Court, respondents
contend that the City violated substantive due process, notonly for the reason articulated by the Sixth Circuit, but also
on the grounds that the City's submission of an administra-tive land-use determination to the charter's referendum procedures constituted per se arbitrary conduct. See Com-plaint |||| 39, 43; Brief for Respondents 32-49. We find no
merit in either claim.We need not decide whether respondents possessed a
property interest in the building permits, because the cityengineer's refusal to issue the permits while the petition was
pending in no sense constituted egregious or arbitrary gov-ernment conduct. See

County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523U. S. 833, 846 (1998) (noting that in our evaluations of "abusive executive action," we have held that "only the mostegregious official conduct can be said to be `arbitrary in the
constitutional sense' "). In light of the charter's provisionthat "[n]o such ordinance [challenged by a petition] shall go
into effect until approved by a majority of those voting

Opinion of the Court
thereon," Art. 9, $ 2, App. 15, the law director's instructionto the engineer to not issue the permits represented an eminently rational directive. Indeed, the site plan, by law,could not be implemented until the voters passed on the
referendum.Respondents' second theory of liability has no basis in our
precedent. As a matter of federal constitutional law, wehave rejected the distinction that respondents ask us to
draw, and that the Ohio Supreme Court drew as a matter ofstate law, between legislative and administrative referendums. In Eastlake v. Forest City Enterprises, Inc., 426U. S., at 672, 675, we made clear that because all power stems
from the people, "[a] referendum cannot . . . be characterizedas a delegation of power," unlawful unless accompanied by
"discernible standards." The people retain the power togovern through referendum " `with respect to any matter,
legislative or administrative, within the realm of local af-fairs.' "

Id., at 674, n. 9. Cf. James v. Valtierra, 402 U. S.137. Though the "substantive result" of a referendum may

be invalid if it is "arbitrary and capricious," Eastlake v.
Forest City Enterprises, supra, at 676, respondents do notchallenge the referendum itself. The subjection of the siteplan ordinance to the City's referendum process, regardlessof whether that ordinance reflected an administrative or legislative decision, did not constitute per se arbitrary govern-ment conduct in violation of due process.

IV
For the reasons detailed above, we reverse the Sixth Cir-cuit's judgment with regard to respondents' equal protection

and substantive due process claims. The Sixth Circuit alsoheld that respondents' disparate impact claim under the Fair
Housing Act could proceed to trial, 263 F. 3d, at 641, butrespondents have now abandoned the claim. See Brief for
Respondents 31. We therefore vacate the Sixth Circuit's

Scalia, J., concurring

disparate impact holding and remand with instructions todismiss, with prejudice, the relevant portion of the complaint. See Deakins v. Monaghan, 484 U. S. 193, 200 (1988).The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for
the Sixth Circuit is, accordingly, reversed in part and vacatedin part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,concurring.

I join the Court's opinion, including Part III, which con-cludes that respondents' assertions of arbitrary government
conduct must be rejected. I write separately to observethat,

even if there had been arbitrary government conduct,
that would not have established the substantive-due-process
violation that respondents claim.

It would be absurd to think that all "arbitrary and capricious" government action violates substantive due process--
even, for example, the arbitrary and capricious cancellation
of a public employee's parking privileges. The judicially
created substantive component of the Due Process Clause
protects, we have said, certain "fundamental liberty interest[s]" from deprivation by the government, unless the infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state
interest. Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 721
(1997). Freedom from delay in receiving a building permit
is not among these "fundamental liberty interests." To the
contrary, the Takings Clause allows government confiscation of private property so long as it is taken for a public
use and just compensation is paid; mere regulation of land
use need not be "narrowly tailored" to effectuate a "compelling state interest." Those who claim "arbitrary" deprivations of nonfundamental liberty interests must look to the
Equal Protection Clause, and Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S.
386, 395 (1989), precludes the use of " `substantive due proc538US1 Unit: $U33 [10-26-04 18:52:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., concurring
ess' " analysis when a more specific constitutional provisiongoverns.

As for respondents' assertion that referendums may notbe used to decide whether low-income housing may be built
on their land: that is not a substantive-due-process claim, butrather a challenge to the procedures by which respondents
were deprived of their alleged liberty interest in building ontheir land. There is nothing procedurally defective about
conditioning the right to build low-income housing on theoutcome of a popular referendum, cf.

James v. Valtierra, 402U. S. 137 (1971), and the delay in issuing the permit was prescribed by a duly enacted provision of the Cuyahoga FallsCity Charter (Art. 9, $ 2), which surely constitutes "due process of law," see Connecticut Dept. of Public Safety v. Doe,ante, p. 8 (

Scalia, J., concurring).With these observations, I join the Court's opinion.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 01-1862. Argued January 21, 2003--Decided March 25, 2003
Amendments made to 28 U. S. C., ch. 153, by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) do not apply to cases pending
in federal court on April 24, 1996--AEDPA's effective date. Lindh v.
Murphy, 521 U. S. 320. Respondent was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death in California state court. After his petition
for state postconviction relief was denied, he moved for the appointment
of federal habeas counsel and a stay of execution in Federal District
Court on May 12, 1995, and later filed a federal habeas application on
July 2, 1996. Although he filed the habeas application after AEDPA's
effective date, the District Court concluded, inter alia, that it was not
subject to AEDPA because his motions for counsel and a stay were filed
prior to that date. The Ninth Circuit agreed that the application was
not subject to AEDPA, but reversed for reasons not relevant here.

Held: For purposes of applying the Lindh rule, a case does not become

"pending" until an actual application for habeas relief is filed in federal court. Respondent's application is subject to AEDPA's amendments because it was not filed until after AEDPA's effective date.
Pp. 205-210.

(a) Because of AEDPA's heavy emphasis on the standards governing
the review of a habeas application's merits, the Court interprets the
Lindh rule in view of that emphasis. Thus, whether AEDPA applies
to a state prisoner turns on what was before a federal court on AEDPA's
effective date. If, on that date, the state prisoner had before a federal
court a habeas application seeking an adjudication on the merits of the
prisoner's claims, then AEDPA does not apply. Otherwise, an application filed after AEDPA's effective date should be reviewed under
AEDPA, even if other filings by that same applicant--e. g., a request for
the appointment of counsel or a motion for a stay of execution--were
presented to a federal court prior to AEDPA's effective date. A review
of the amended chapter 153 supports this conclusion. For example, 28
U. S. C. $ 2254(e)(1) provides that, "[i]n a proceeding instituted by an
application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant
to the judgment of a State court, a determination of a factual issue made
by a State court shall be presumed to be correct." (Emphasis added.)

Syllabus
Under the Ninth Circuit's view, that presumption would rarely apply in
a capital case, as $ 2254(e)(1) would be applicable only to those capital
prisoners who did not need counsel and did not seek a stay. AEDPA's
text, however, contains no indication that $ 2254(e)(1) was intended to
have such a limited scope. Nor is it reasonable to believe that Congress
meant for a capital prisoner to avoid application of $ 2254(e)(1)'s stringent requirements simply by filing a request for counsel or a motion for
a stay before filing an actual habeas application. Finally, the procedural rules governing $ 2254 cases reinforce the Court's view. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply in the habeas context to the extent
that they are not inconsistent with the Habeas Corpus Rules. Because
nothing in the Habeas Rules contradicts Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 3--"[a] civil action is commenced by filing a complaint"--the logical conclusion is that a habeas suit begins with the filing of a habeas
application, the equivalent of a complaint in an ordinary civil case.
Pp. 205-208.

(b) As the task here is to apply Lindh to an action under chapter 153,
respondent's request to look at provisions in chapter 154 is inapposite.
Moreover, his reliance on McFarland v. Scott, 512 U. S. 849, which involved the interpretation of $ 2251, not $ 2254, and must be understood
in light of the Court's concern to protect the right to counsel contained
in 18 U. S. C. $ 848(q)(4)(B), and Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236,
which says nothing about whether a request for counsel or motion for a
stay suffices to create a "case" that is "pending" within the Lindh rule's
meaning, is misplaced. Pp. 208-210.

Lynne S. Coffin argued the cause for respondent. Withher on the brief were Andrew S. Love and Denise Kendall.*

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
In Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320 (1997), we held thatamendments made to chapter 153 of Title 28 of the United

States Code by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Pen-alty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, do not apply to
cases pending in federal court on April 24, 1996--AEDPA'seffective date. In this case we consider when a capital habeas case becomes "pending" for purposes of the rule an-nounced in

Lindh. I

Respondent Robert Garceau brutally killed his girlfriendMaureen Bautista and her 14-year-old son, Telesforo Bautista. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sen-tenced to death. The California Supreme Court affirmed respondent's conviction and sentence, People v. Garceau, 6 Cal.4th 140, 862 P. 2d 664 (1993), and denied on the merits his
petition for state postconviction relief. We denied certio-rari. 513 U. S. 848 (1994).

On May 12, 1995, respondent filed a motion for the appoint-ment of federal habeas counsel and an application for a stay
of execution in the United States District Court for the East-ern District of California. The District Court promptly

issued a 45-day stay of execution. On June 26, 1995, theDistrict Court appointed counsel and extended the stay of
execution for another 120 days. On August 1, 1995, theState filed a motion to vacate the stay, in part because respondent had failed to file a "specification of nonfrivolousissues," as required by local court rules. Brief for Respond*Kent S. Scheidegger and Charles L. Hobson filed a brief for the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation as amicus curiae urging reversal.

Leon Friedman, Jeffrey L. Kirchmeier, and Joshua L. Dratel filed a
brief for the Association of the Bar of the City of New York as amicus
curiae urging affirmance.

Opinion of the Court
ent 2. Respondent cured that defect, and, on October 13,1995, the District Court denied the State's motion and ordered that the habeas petition be filed within nine months.Respondent filed his application for habeas relief on July 2,
1996.Although respondent's habeas application was filed after
AEDPA's effective date, the District Court, following Circuitprecedent, concluded that the application was not subject to
AEDPA. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 31-32 (citing Lindh,
supra; Calderon v. United States Dist. Ct. for the CentralDist. of Cal., 163 F. 3d 530, 540 (CA9 1998) (en banc), cert.

denied, 526 U. S. 1060 (1999)). On the merits, however, theDistrict Court ruled that respondent was not entitled to habeas relief. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit re-versed. Like the District Court, the Ninth Circuit concluded AEDPA does not apply to respondent's application.275 F. 3d 769, 772, n. 1 (2001). Unlike the District Court,
however, the Ninth Circuit granted habeas relief for reasonsthat are not relevant to our discussion here.

Id., at 777-778.We granted certiorari. 536 U. S. 990 (2001).

II
As already noted, we held in Lindh that the new provi-sions of chapter 153 of Title 28 do not apply to cases pending

as of the date AEDPA became effective. Lindh, however,had no occasion to elaborate on the precise time when a case
becomes "pending" for purposes of chapter 153 because inthat case petitioner's habeas application had been filed prior
to AEDPA's effective date. See Lindh, supra, at 323 (notingthat petitioner filed his federal habeas application on July 9,
1992). Since Lindh, the Courts of Appeals have divided onthe question whether AEDPA applies to a habeas application
filed after AEDPA's effective date if the applicant sought theappointment of counsel or a stay of execution (or both) prior
to that date. Five Courts of Appeals have ruled thatAEDPA applies, see,

e. g., Isaacs v. Head, 300 F. 3d 1232,

Gosier v. Welborn, 175 F. 3d 504, 506

Williams v. Cain, 125 F. 3d 269, 273-274 (CA5
1997), while the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit hasheld it does not,

Calderon, supra, at 539-540. For the reasons stated below, we agree with the majority of the Courts
of Appeals.Congress enacted AEDPA to reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences, particularly incapital cases, see

Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 386
(2000) (opinion of Stevens, J.) ("Congress wished to curb
delays, to prevent `retrials' on federal habeas, and to give
effect to state convictions to the extent possible under law");
see also id., at 404 (majority opinion), and "to further the
principles of comity, finality, and federalism," Williams v.
Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, 436 (2000). One of the methods Congress used to advance these objectives was the adoption of
an amended 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d). Williams, 529 U. S., at 404
("It cannot be disputed that Congress viewed $ 2254(d)(1) as
an important means by which its goals for habeas reform
would be achieved"). As we have explained before, $ 2254(d)
places "new constraint[s] on the power of a federal habeas
court to grant a state prisoner's application for a writ of habeas corpus with respect to claims adjudicated on the merits
in state court." Id., at 412. Our cases make clear that
AEDPA in general and $ 2254(d) in particular focus in large
measure on revising the standards used for evaluating the
merits of a habeas application. See id., at 412-413; Lindh,
supra, at 329 (noting that "amended $ 2254(d) . . . governs
standards affecting entitlement to relief "); see also Early v.
Packer, 537 U. S. 3 (2002) (per curiam) (applying AEDPA's
standards); Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19 (2002) (per
curiam) (same).

Because of AEDPA's heavy emphasis on the standards
governing the review of the merits of a habeas application,

538US1 Unit: $U34 [10-26-04 18:53:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

207Cite as: 538 U. S. 202 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
we interpret the rule announced in Lindh in view of thatemphasis, as have the majority of the Courts of Appeals.

See, e. g., Holman v. Gilmore, 126 F. 3d 876, 880 (CA7 1997)("[T]he motion for counsel is not itself a petition, because it
does not call for (or even permit) a decision on the merits.And it is `the merits' that the amended $ 2254(d)(1) is all
about"); Isaacs, supra, at 1245 (same); Coyle, supra, at 1040
(same). Thus, whether AEDPA applies to a state prisonerturns on what was before a federal court on the date AEDPA

became effective. If, on that date, the state prisoner hadbefore a federal court an application for habeas relief seeking
an adjudication on the merits of the petitioner's claims, then
amended $ 2254(d) does not apply. Otherwise, an application
filed after AEDPA's effective date should be reviewed under
AEDPA, even if other filings by that same applicant--such
as, for example, a request for the appointment of counsel or
a motion for a stay of execution--were presented to a federal
court prior to AEDPA's effective date.

A review of the amended chapter 153 supports our conclusion. For instance, $ 2254(e)(1) provides that, "[i]n a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas
corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of
a State court, a determination of a factual issue made by a
State court shall be presumed to be correct." (Emphasis
added.) Under the Ninth Circuit's view, the presumption
established in $ 2254(e)(1) would rarely apply in a capital
case. If, as the Ninth Circuit held, a capital habeas case
can be commenced (and, therefore, may become pending for
purposes of Lindh) with the filing of a request for the appointment of counsel or a motion for a stay, then $ 2254(e)(1),
which by its terms applies only to a proceeding "instituted"
by "an application for a writ of habeas corpus," would not
apply to any capital prisoners whose first filing in federal
court is a request for the appointment of counsel or a motion
for a stay. This would make $ 2254(e)(1) applicable only to
those capital prisoners who did not need counsel and did not

Opinion of the Court
seek a stay. AEDPA's text, however, contains no indicationthat $ 2254(e)(1) was intended to have such a limited scope.

Nor is it reasonable to believe that Congress meant for acapital prisoner to avoid the application of the stringent requirements of $ 2254(e)(1) simply by filing a request for coun-sel or a motion for a stay before filing an actual application
for habeas relief. Other provisions of chapter 153 likewisesupport our view. See,

e. g., 28 U. S. C. $ 2241(d) (indicatingthat the power to grant a writ is not triggered except by

"application for a writ of habeas corpus"); $ 2244(a) (provid-ing that federal judges are not required to "entertain" a second or successive "application for a writ of habeas corpus"except as provided for by statute).

Finally, our conclusion is reinforced by the proceduralrules governing $ 2254 cases. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 3 explains that "[a] civil action is commenced by filinga complaint." The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply
in the context of habeas suits to the extent that they are notinconsistent with the Habeas Corpus Rules. See 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254 Rule 11; Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 81(a)(2); Pitchess v.
Davis, 421 U. S. 482, 489 (1975) (per curiam). Nothing inthe Habeas Corpus Rules contradicts Rule 3. The logical

conclusion, therefore, is that a habeas suit begins with thefiling of an application for habeas corpus relief--the equivalent of a complaint in an ordinary civil case.

III
Respondent asks us to determine the scope of the ruleannounced in

Lindh by looking at some of the provisions ofchapter 154 of Title 28. But our task in this case is to apply

Lindh to an action under chapter 153; thus, the precisephrasing of provisions in chapter 154 is inapposite to our
inquiry here.Moreover, respondent's argument that our holding in McFarland v. Scott, 512 U. S. 849 (1994), should inform our deci-sion here is unpersuasive. To begin with,

McFarland in538US1 Unit: $U34 [10-26-04 18:53:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

209Cite as: 538 U. S. 202 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
volved the interpretation of $ 2251, not $ 2254, which is atissue here. And, as the Courts of Appeals have recognized,

see Isaacs, 300 F. 3d, at 1242-1246 (collecting and discussingauthorities), the Court's ruling in

McFarland must be understood in light of the Court's concern to protect the right tocounsel contained in 21 U. S. C. $ 848(q)(4)(B).

McFarland,
512 U. S., at 855 ("This interpretation is the only one that
gives meaning to the statute as a practical matter"); id., at856 ("Requiring an indigent capital petitioner to proceed

without counsel in order to obtain counsel thus would exposehim to the substantial risk that his habeas claims never
would be heard on the merits. Congress legislated against
this legal backdrop in adopting $ 848(q)(4)(B), and we safely
assume that it did not intend for the express requirement of
counsel to be defeated in this manner"); id., at 857 ("Even if
the District Court had granted McFarland's motion for appointment of counsel and had found an attorney to represent
him, this appointment would have been meaningless unless
McFarland's execution also was stayed"). Thus, McFarland
cannot carry the day for respondent.

Similarly, the Ninth Circuit's and respondent's reliance on
Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236 (1998), is misplaced. In
Hohn, we considered whether this Court has jurisdiction to
review a court of appeals' denial of a certificate of appealability (COA). To answer that question we focused on the text
of 28 U. S. C. $ 1254, which "confines our jurisdiction to
`[c]ases in' the courts of appeals." Hohn, supra, at 241 (citing Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731, 741-742 (1982)). Although we concluded that an application for a COA constituted a case within the meaning of $ 1254, we did not provide
an all-purpose definition of the term "case." Thus, while
Hohn might support an argument that respondent's request
for appointment of counsel and his motion for a stay of execution began a "case" that could be reviewed on appeal, see,
e. g., Gosier, 175 F. 3d, at 506 ("[A] request for counsel is a
`case' in the sense that it is subject to appellate review (and,

if need be, review by the Supreme Court)"), it says nothingabout whether a request for counsel or motion for a stay

suffices to create a "case" that is "pending" within the mean-ing of the Lindh rule.

* * *
In sum, we hold that, for purposes of applying the ruleannounced in

Lindh, a case does not become "pending" untilan actual application for habeas corpus relief is filed in federal court. Because respondent's federal habeas corpus ap-plication was not filed until after AEDPA's effective date,
that application is subject to AEDPA's amendments.1 Ac-cordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals
and remand the case for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice O'Connor, concurring in the judgment.
The Court today holds that the post-Antiterrorism andEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) version of 28

1 Justice O'Connor contends that we may have misapplied our test
because a filing labeled "Specification of Non-Frivolous Issues" placed the
merits of respondent's claims before the District Court before AEDPA's
effective date. Post, at 211 (opinion concurring in judgment). That is
simply not so. Respondent's "Specification of Non-Frivolous Issues"
plainly stated that "[b]ased on a preliminary review of case materials,
counsel believes the following federal constitutional issues exist in this
case and are among the issues that may be raised on [Garceau's] behalf in
a petition for habeas corpus." App. to Brief in Opposition 227 (emphasis
added). The clear import of this language is that the filing itself did not
seek any relief on the merits or place the merits of respondent's claims
before the District Court for decision. Rather, the document simply
alerted the District Court as to some of the possible claims that might be
raised by respondent in the future. Indeed, the habeas corpus application
respondent eventually filed contained numerous issues that were not mentioned in the "Specification of Non-Frivolous Issues."

2 In view of the question on which we granted certiorari, we decline petitioner's request to rule on the merits of respondent's habeas
application.

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
U. S. C. $ 2254 applies to respondent Robert Garceau'shabeas corpus application because Garceau did not file his

application until after AEDPA's effective date. I agreewith that holding. I concur only in the judgment, however,
because in my view the Court's reasoning is broader thannecessary.

The Court states that if "the state prisoner had before
a federal court an application for habeas relief seeking anadjudication on the

merits of the petitioner's claims, then
amended $ 2254(d) does not apply." Ante, at 207. Underthe facts of this case, however, the Court may have misapplied its own rule. As the Court concedes, ante, at 204-205,
the District Court had a pre-AEDPA filing setting forth the
merits of Garceau's claims. After Garceau filed a motion for
the appointment of counsel, motion for a stay, and motion for
leave to file a habeas application, the District Court stayed
Garceau's execution. Over the objection of the State, the
District Court held that Garceau had identified nonfrivolous
issues so that a stay of the execution was appropriate. It is
difficult to see how the "merits" were not in front of the
District Court at that time, which was well before AEDPA's
effective date.

In addition, the Court does not adequately distinguish McFarland v. Scott, 512 U. S. 849 (1994). Although I dissented
from that case, I also recognize that "the doctrine of stare
decisis is most compelling" when the Court confronts "a pure
question of statutory construction." Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways Comm'n, 502 U. S. 197, 205 (1991).
The Court here, however, appears to adopt the reasoning of
the dissent in McFarland. Compare ante, at 208 ("Finally,
our conclusion is reinforced by the procedural rules governing $ 2254 cases"), with McFarland, supra, at 862 (O'Connor, J., dissenting in relevant part) ("The rules governing

$ 2254 cases confirm this conclusion"). I see no need to question the underpinnings of McFarland in this case, and I accept the holding of McFarland that an application for a writ

538US1 Unit: $U34 [10-26-04 18:53:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN
212 WOODFORD v. GARCEAU

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
of habeas corpus is not necessary to trigger the beginning ofa habeas proceeding. See,

e. g., 28 U. S. C. $$ 2251, 2262.
I agree, however, with the Court's conclusion that thepost-AEDPA version of $ 2254 is applicable to Garceau's case.

The text of $ 2254 itself provides the answer. Both beforeand after AEDPA, $ 2254 has concerned

only applications for
a writ of habeas corpus. Compare $ 2254(a) ("The Supreme
Court, a Justice thereof, a circuit judge, or a district courtshall entertain

an application for a writ of habeas corpus . . ." (emphasis added)) with 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(a) (1994ed.) (same). Indeed, only the filing of an application for a

writ of habeas corpus triggered the former version of

$ 2254(d). See 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d) (1994 ed.) ("In any proceeding instituted in a Federal court by an application for a
writ of habeas corpus . . ."). Thus, although Garceau's preapplication filings trigger a habeas corpus proceeding sufficient to permit the District Court to grant a stay under 28
U. S. C. $ 2251 and to engage in other activity related to the
case, these filings do not answer whether the pre- or postAEDPA version of $ 2254(d) applies here. Because $ 2254
has always spoken in terms of "applications," a case is pending for $ 2254 purposes only when the prisoner files an application for a writ of habeas corpus.

I acknowledge that some language in Lindh v. Murphy,
521 U. S. 320 (1997), and in McFarland, supra, can be read
to say that if a habeas case is pending before AEDPA, none
of AEDPA's amendments apply--including the amendments
to $ 2254. But these statements do not answer the question
in this case. If $ 2254 applied to habeas proceedings other
than applications for a writ of habeas corpus, the answer
might well be different. Compare 28 U. S. C. $ 2251 (a judge,
"before whom a habeas corpus proceeding is pending, may
. . . stay any proceeding") with $ 2254(e)(1) ("In a proceeding
instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus . . .").
But as the Court correctly points out, ante, at 207-208, $ 2254
applies only once a prisoner has filed "an application for a

538US1 Unit: $U34 [10-26-04 18:53:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Souter, J., dissenting
writ of habeas corpus." $ 2254(a). See also $$ 2254(b)(1),2254(b)(2), 2254(d), 2254(e)(1).

It does not follow from our case law, nor does it followfrom the text of $ 2254 or any other habeas provision, that a
habeas applicant can receive the benefit of the pre-AEDPAversion of $ 2254 when $ 2254 itself cannot be triggered until
the prisoner files an application for a writ of habeas corpus.
A "case" simply could not have existed for purposes of $ 2254until Garceau filed the application itself. Finally, Garceau

has no reliance interest here. The pre-AEDPA version of$ 2254(d) specifically acknowledged that a habeas applicant
was entitled to the then-existing less-restrictive version of$ 2254(d) only when the prisoner "instituted" a "proceeding
. . . by an application for a writ of habeas corpus." 28
U. S. C. $ 2254(d) (1994 ed.).

Because 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 is triggered only when a prisoner files an application for a writ of habeas corpus, and because Garceau filed his petition after AEDPA's date, I concur
in the judgment of the Court that the post-AEDPA version
of $ 2254(d) governs his claim.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

In modifying 28 U. S. C. $ 2254, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214,
did not specifically identify the state habeas cases that the
amended statute would govern, except in certain capital
cases subject to special rules not applicable here. Lindh v.
Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 326 (1997), held that in the statute's
general application, the amendments cover only cases filed
after AEDPA's effective date. Here we have to take the
further step of deciding when a case is filed for purposes of
the Lindh rule.

The majority focuses on 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 alone, which is
fair enough where a habeas petitioner's first encounter with
the district court occurs in filing the petition for habeas relief

U. S. C. $ 848(q)(4)(B), and his subsequently appointed lawyerthen petitioned under 28 U. S. C. $ 2251 for a stay of execution while preparing a habeas petition. I therefore thinkthis case calls for the principle that related statutory provisions are to be read together, see, e. g., Coit Independence
Joint Venture v. FSLIC, 489 U. S. 561, 573 (1989) (citing
Brown v. Duchesne, 19 How. 183, 194 (1857)). AEDPA's
amendment of $ 2254 ought to be understood in light of$ 2251.

When counsel, appointed to prepare and litigate a habeas
petition under $ 2254, seeks a stay of execution under $ 2251,
the district court will at some point condition the continuation of any stay on its assessment of the substantiality of the
issues counsel expects to raise in the petition yet to be filed,
a judgment that will call for some consideration of standards
for federal relief in cases governed by $ 2254. When a district court's exercise of jurisdiction for habeas purposes occurs during the transition from an earlier to a later version
of $ 2254, it makes sense to hold that the version to be applied in a given case is the one in effect when the habeas
court first takes account of $ 2254 standards for habeas relief.
A case should thus be considered filed for purposes of the
Lindh rule by the time the habeas court makes a determination that takes standards for federal relief into consideration.

When the District Court took its initial look at anticipated
claims in this case, for example, it was clear that the habeas
petition might well be filed before the effective date of the
amendment to $ 2254; it was thus appropriate for the District
Court to consider the possible merit of the claim in light
of the earlier, existing law. As a consequence, it would be
reasonable to apply that law throughout. There would not
be much point, after all, in relying on existing law to judge
the merits of a stay, if counsel could not rely on existing law
in preparing the case. Otherwise the court could be staying

a case that might be hopeless under the later, more restric-tive, law; or conversely, would be forcing counsel to stint

on responsible preparation, in order to assure that a peti-tion subject to the earlier law be filed before AEDPA's general effective date. I would therefore hold that the earlierversion of $ 2254 should apply throughout a habeas proceeding if the habeas court that issued a $ 2251 stay took its pre-liminary look at the prospects for habeas success prior to
AEDPA's effective date.In this case, that first look occurred six months before the
amendment's effective date, and I would accordingly hold thepre-AEDPA law applicable here. I respectfully dissent.

BROWN et al. v. LEGAL FOUNDATION OF

WASHINGTON et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 01-1325. Argued December 9, 2002--Decided March 26, 2003
Every State uses interest on lawyers' trust accounts (IOLTA) to pay for

legal services for the needy. In promulgating Rules establishing Washington's program, the State Supreme Court required that: (a) all client
funds be deposited in interest-bearing trust accounts, (b) funds that cannot earn net interest for the client be deposited in an IOLTA account,
(c) lawyers direct banks to pay the net interest on the IOLTA accounts
to the Legal Foundation of Washington (Foundation), and (d) the Foundation use all such funds for tax-exempt law-related charitable and educational purposes. It seems apparent from the court's explanation of
its IOLTA Rules that a lawyer who mistakenly uses an IOLTA account
for money that could earn interest for the client would violate the Rule.
That court subsequently made its IOLTA Rules applicable to Limited
Practice Officers (LPOs), nonlawyers who are licensed to act as escrowees in real estate closings. Petitioners, who have funds that are deposited by LPOs in IOLTA accounts, and others sought to enjoin respondent state official from continuing this requirement, alleging, among
other things, that the taking of the interest earned on their funds in
IOLTA accounts violates the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth
Amendment, and that the requirement that client funds be placed in
such accounts is an illegal taking of the beneficial use of those funds.
The record suggests that petitioners' funds generated some interest that
was paid to the Foundation, but that without IOLTA they would have
produced no net interest for either petitioner. The District Court
granted respondents summary judgment, concluding, as a factual matter, that petitioners could not make any net returns on the interest
accrued in the accounts and, if they could, the funds would not be subject to the IOLTA program; and that, as a legal matter, the constitutional issue focused on what an owner has lost, not what the taker has
gained, and that petitioners had lost nothing. While the case was on
appeal, this Court decided in Phillips v. Washington Legal Foundation,
524 U. S. 156, 172, that interest generated by funds held in IOLTA accounts is the private property of the owner of the principal. Relying
on that case, a Ninth Circuit panel held that Washington's program
caused an unconstitutional taking of petitioners' property and remanded

Syllabus
the case for a determination whether they are entitled to just compensation. On reconsideration, the en banc Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's judgment, reasoning that, under the ad hoc approach applied in Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104, there
was no taking because petitioners had suffered neither an actual loss
nor an interference with any investment-backed expectations, and that
if there were such a taking, the just compensation due was zero.

Held:

1. A state law requiring that client funds that could not otherwise
generate net earnings for the client be deposited in an IOLTA account
is not a "regulatory taking," but a law requiring that the interest on
those funds be transferred to a different owner for a legitimate public
use could be a per se taking requiring the payment of "just compensation" to the client. Pp. 231-235.

(a) The Fifth Amendment imposes two conditions on the State's
authority to confiscate private property: the taking must be for a "public
use" and "just compensation" must be paid to the owner. In this case,
the overall, dramatic success of IOLTA programs in serving the compelling interest in providing legal services to literally millions of needy
Americans qualifies the Foundation's distribution of the funds as a "public use." Pp. 231-232.

(b) The Court first addresses the type of taking that this case
involves. The Court's jurisprudence concerning condemnations and
physical takings involves the straightforward application of per se rules,
while its regulatory takings jurisprudence is characterized by essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries designed to allow careful examination
and weighing of all relevant circumstances. Tahoe-Sierra Preservation
Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 535 U. S. 302, 322.
Petitioners separately challenged (1) the requirement that their funds
must be placed in an IOLTA account and (2) the later transfers of interest to the Foundation. The former is merely a transfer of principal and
therefore does not effect a confiscation of any interest. Even if viewed
as the first step in a regulatory taking which should be analyzed under
the Penn Central factors, it is clear that there would be no taking because the transaction had no adverse economic impact on petitioners and
did not interfere with any investment-backed expectation. 438 U. S., at
124. A per se approach is more consistent with the Court's reasoning
in Phillips than Penn Central's ad hoc analysis. Because interest
earned in IOLTA accounts "is the `private property' of the owner of the
principal," Phillips, 524 U. S., at 172, the transfer of the interest to the
Foundation here seems more akin to the occupation of a small amount
of rooftop space in Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp.,

Syllabus
458 U. S. 419, which was a physical taking subject to per se rules. The
Court therefore assumes that petitioners retained the beneficial ownership of at least a portion of their escrow deposits until the funds were
disbursed at closings, that those funds generated interest in the IOLTA
accounts, and that their interest was taken for a public use when it was
turned over to the Foundation. This does not end the inquiry, however,
for the Court must now determine whether any "just compensation" is
due. Pp. 233-235.

2. Because "just compensation" is measured by the owner's pecuniary
loss--which is zero whenever the Washington law is obeyed--there has
been no violation of the Just Compensation Clause. Pp. 235-241.

(a) This Court's consistent and unambiguous holdings support the
conclusion that the "just compensation" required by the Fifth Amendment is measured by the property owner's loss rather than the government's gain. E. g., Boston Chamber of Commerce v. Boston, 217 U. S.
189, 195. Applying the teachings of such cases to the question here, it
is clear that neither petitioner is entitled to any compensation for the
nonpecuniary consequences of the taking of the interest on his deposited
funds, and that any pecuniary compensation must be measured by his
net losses rather than the value of the public's gain. Thus, if petitioners' net loss was zero, the compensation that is due is also zero.
Pp. 235-237.

(b) Although lawyers and LPOs may occasionally deposit client
funds in an IOLTA account when those funds could have produced net
interest for their clients, it does not follow that there is a need for further hearings to determine whether petitioners are entitled to compensation from respondents. The Washington Supreme Court's Rules unambiguously require lawyers and LPOs to deposit client funds in
non-IOLTA accounts whenever those funds could generate net earnings
for the client. If petitioners' money could have generated net income,
the LPOs violated the court's Rules, and any net loss was the consequence of the LPOs' incorrect private decisions rather than state action.
Such mistakes may give petitioners a valid claim against the LPOs, but
would provide no support for a compensation claim against the State or
respondents. Because Washington's IOLTA program mandates a nonIOLTA account when net interest can be generated for the client, the
compensation due petitioners for any taking of their property would be
nil, and there was therefore no constitutional violation when they were
not compensated. Pp. 237-240.

220 BROWN v. LEGAL FOUNDATION OF WASH.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
The State of Washington, like every other State in theUnion, uses interest on lawyers' trust accounts (IOLTA) to

pay for legal services provided to the needy. Some IOLTAprograms were created by statute, but in Washington, as in
most other States, the IOLTA program was established bythe State Supreme Court pursuant to its authority to regulate the practice of law. In Phillips v. Washington Legal
Foundation, 524 U. S. 156 (1998), a case involving the TexasIOLTA program, we held "that the interest income generated by funds held in IOLTA accounts is the `private prop-erty' of the owner of the principal."

Id., at 172. We didnot, however, express any opinion on the question whether

the income had been "taken" by the State or "as to theamount of `just compensation,' if any, due respondents."
Ibid. We now confront those questions.

I
As we explained in Phillips, id., at 160-161, in the courseof their legal practice, attorneys are frequently required to

hold clients' funds for various lengths of time. It has longbeen recognized that they have a professional and fiduciary
obligation to avoid commingling their clients' money with

Opinion of the Court
their own, but it is not unethical to pool several clients'funds in a single trust account. Before 1980 client funds

were typically held in non-interest-bearing federally insuredchecking accounts. Because federal banking regulations in
effect since the Great Depression prohibited banks from pay-ing interest on checking accounts, the value of the use of
the clients' money in such accounts inured to the bankinginstitutions.

In 1980, Congress authorized federally insured banks topay interest on a limited category of demand deposits referred to as "NOW accounts." See 87 Stat. 342, 12 U. S. C.$ 1832. This category includes deposits made by individuals
and charitable organizations, but does not include thosemade by for-profit corporations or partnerships unless
the deposits are made pursuant to a program under which
charitable organizations have "the exclusive right to theinterest."

1

In response to the change in federal law, Florida adopted
the first IOLTA program in 1981 authorizing the use of NOWaccounts for the deposit of client funds, and providing that

all of the interest on such accounts be used for charitablepurposes. Every State in the Nation and the District of Columbia have followed Florida's lead and adopted an IOLTAprogram, either through their legislatures or their highest
courts.2 The result is that, whereas before 1980 the banks

In Virginia, the legislature has overridden the State Supreme Court's
IOLTA Rules. See 1995 Va. Acts ch. 93 (making lawyer participation in
the IOLTA program optional rather than mandatory by adding Va. Code
Ann. $ 54.1-3915.1 (2002)). In Indiana, the program was created by legislation but was struck down by the Indiana Supreme Court as an impermissible encroachment on the court's power to regulate the practice of law.
See In re Public Law No. 154-1990, 561 N. E. 2d 791 (1990). Later, the
Indiana Supreme Court adopted an IOLTA program. See Ind. Rule Prof.

charitable entities providing legal services for the poor.The aggregate value of those contributions in 2001 apparently exceeded $200 million.3In 1984, the Washington Supreme Court established its
IOLTA program by amending its Rules of Professional Con-duct.

IOLTA Adoption Order, 102 Wash. 2d 1101. The
amendments were adopted after over two years of deliberation, during which the court received hundreds of publiccomments and heard oral argument from the Seattle-King

County Bar Association, designated to represent the propo-nents of the Rule, and the Walla Walla County Bar Association, designated to represent the opponents of the Rule.In its opinion explaining the order, the court noted that
earlier Rules had required attorneys to hold client trustfunds "in accounts separate from their own funds,"

id., at
1102, and had prohibited the use of such funds for the law-yer's own pecuniary advantage, but did not address the question whether or how such funds should be invested. Com-menting on then-prevalent practice the court observed:

"In conformity with trust law, however, lawyers usuallyinvest client trust funds in separate interest-bearing accounts and pay the interest to the clients whenever thetrust funds are large enough in amount or to be held for
a long enough period of time to make such investments
economically feasible, that is, when the amount of interest earned exceeds the bank charges and costs of setting
up the account. However, when trust funds are so nomduct to require attorney participation in IOLTA. See Azen, Building a
Base for Pro Bono in Pennsylvania, 24 Pa. Law. 28 (Mar.-Apr. 2002).

Petitioners appear to suggest that a different constitutional analysis
might apply to a legislative program than to one adopted by the State's
judiciary. See Brief for Petitioners 23, n. 7; Tr. of Oral Arg. 50-51. We
assume, however, that the procedure followed by the State when promulgating its IOLTA Rules is irrelevant to the takings issue.

224 BROWN v. LEGAL FOUNDATION OF WASH.

Opinion of the Court
inal in amount or to be held for so short a period thatthe amount of interest that could be earned would not

justify the cost of creating separate accounts, mostattorneys simply deposit the funds in a single
noninterest-bearing trust checking account containingall such trust funds from all their clients. The funds in
such accounts earn no interest for either the client or
the attorney. The banks, in contrast, have received theinterest-free use of client money."

Ibid.

The court then described the four essential features of its
IOLTA program: (a) the requirement that all client funds bedeposited in interest-bearing trust accounts, (b) the requirement that funds that cannot earn net interest for the clientbe deposited in an IOLTA account, (c) the requirement that
the lawyers direct the banks to pay the net interest on the
IOLTA accounts to the Legal Foundation of Washington(Foundation), and (d) the requirement that the Foundation

must use all funds received from IOLTA accounts for tax-exempt law-related charitable and educational purposes.
It explained:

"1. All client funds paid to any Washington lawyer or
law firm must be deposited in identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts separate from any accounts containing non-trust money of the lawyer or law firm. Theprogram is mandatory for all Washington lawyers.
New CPR DR 9-102(A)."2. The new rule provides for two kinds of interestbearing trust accounts. The first type of account bearsinterest to be paid, net of any transaction costs, to the
client. This type of account may be in the form of
either separate accounts for each client or a single
pooled account with subaccounting to determine how
much interest is earned for each client. The second
type of account is a pooled interest-bearing account with
the interest to be paid directly by the financial institu538US1 Unit: $U35 [10-26-04 19:54:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tion to the Legal Foundation of Washington (hereinafterthe Foundation), a nonprofit entity to be established pursuant to the order following this opinion. New CPRDR 9-102(C)(1), (2).

"3. Determining whether client funds should be de-posited in accounts bearing interest for the benefit of
the client or the Foundation is left to the discretion of
each lawyer, but the new rule specifies that the lawyershall base his decision solely on whether the funds could

be invested to provide a positive net return to the client.This determination is made by considering several enumerated factors: the amount of interest the funds wouldearn during the period they are expected to be deposited, the cost of establishing and administering the ac-count, and the capability of financial institutions to calculate and pay interest to individual clients. New CPRDR 9-102(C)(3).

. . . . .
"5. Lawyers and law firms must direct the depository institution to pay interest or dividends, net ofany service charges or fees, to the Foundation, and to

send certain regular reports to the Foundation and thelawyer or law firm depositing the funds. New CPR
DR 9-102(C)(4).

"The Foundation must use all funds received fromlawyers' trust accounts for tax-exempt law-related charitable and educational purposes within the meaning ofsection 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, as directed by this court. See Articles of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Legal Foundation of Washington, 100
Wash. 2d, Advance Sheet 13, at ii, vi (1984)." Id., at
1102-1104.

In its opinion the court responded to three objections that
are relevant to our inquiry in this case. First, it rejected
the contention that the new program "constitutes an uncon538US1 Unit: $U35 [10-26-04 19:54:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN
226 BROWN v. LEGAL FOUNDATION OF WASH.

Opinion of the Court
stitutional taking of property without due process or just
compensation." Id., at 1104. Like other State Supreme
Courts that had considered the question, it distinguished our
decision in Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith,
449 U. S. 155 (1980), on the ground that the new " `program
creates income where there had been none before, and the
income thus created would never benefit the client under any
set of circumstances.' " 102 Wash. 2d, at 1108 (quoting In re
Interest on Trust Accounts, 402 So. 2d 389, 395 (Fla. 1981)).

Second, it rejected the argument that it was unethical for
lawyers to rely on any factor other than the client's best
interests when deciding whether to deposit funds in an
IOLTA account rather than an account that would generate
interest for the client. The court endorsed, and added emphasis to, the response to that argument set forth in the proponents' reply brief:

" `Although the proposed amendments list several factors an attorney should consider in deciding how to invest his clients' trust funds, . . . all of these factors are
really facets of a single question: Can the client's money
be invested so that it will produce a net benefit for the
client? If so, the attorney must invest it to earn interest for the client. Only if the money cannot earn net
interest for the client is the money to go into an
IOLTA account.'

"Reply Brief of Proponents, at 14. This is a correct
statement of an attorney's duty under trust law, as well
as a proper interpretation of the proposed rule as published for public comment. However, in order to make
it even clearer that IOLTA funds are only those funds
that cannot, under any circumstances, earn net interest
(after deducting transaction and administrative costs
and bank fees) for the client, we have amended the proposed rule accordingly. See new CPR DR 9-102(C)(3).
The new rule makes it absolutely clear that the enumer538US1 Unit: $U35 [10-26-04 19:54:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ated factors are merely facets of the ultimate questionof whether client funds could be invested profitably for

the benefit of clients. If they can, then investment forthe client is mandatory." 102 Wash. 2d, at 1113-1114.

The court also rejected the argument that it had failed toconsider the significance of advances in computer technology
that, in time, may convert IOLTA participation into an un-constitutional taking of property that could have been distributed to the client. It pointed to the fact that the Ruleexpressly requires attorneys to give consideration to the capability of financial institutions to calculate and pay intereston individual accounts, and added: "Thus, as cost effective
subaccounting services become available, making it possi-ble to earn net interest for clients on increasingly smaller
amounts held for increasingly shorter periods of time, moretrust money will have to be invested for the clients' benefit
under the new rule. The rule is therefore self-adjusting andis adequately designed to accommodate changes in banking
technology without running afoul of the state or federal con-stitutions."

Id., at 1114.Given the court's explanation of its Rule, it seems apparent

that a lawyer who mistakenly uses an IOLTA account as adepositary for money that could earn interest for the client
would violate the Rule. Hence, the lawyer will be liableto the client for any lost interest, however minuscule the
amount might be.In 1995, the Washington Supreme Court amended its
IOLTA Rules to make them applicable to Limited PracticeOfficers (LPOs) as well as lawyers. LPOs are nonlawyers
who are licensed to act as escrowees in the closing of realestate transactions. Like lawyers, LPOs often temporarily
control the funds of clients.

require LPOs to deposit trust funds into IOLTA accounts.Because the Court of Appeals held that the firm and two

of the individuals do not have standing,4 Washington LegalFoundation v. Legal Foundation of Washington, 271 F. 3d
835, 848-850 (CA9 2001), and since that holding was not chal-lenged in this Court, we limit our discussion to the claims
asserted by petitioners Allen Brown and Greg Hayes. Thedefendants, respondents in this Court, are the justices of the
Washington Supreme Court, the Foundation, which receivesand redistributes the interest on IOLTA accounts, and the
president of the Foundation.In their amended complaint, Brown and Hayes describe
the IOLTA program, with particular reference to its applica-tion to LPOs and to some of the activities of recipient organizations that have received funds from the Foundation.Brown and Hayes also both allege that they regularly purchase and sell real estate and in the course of such transac-tions they deliver funds to LPOs who are required to deposit
them in IOLTA accounts. They object to having the inter-est on those funds "used to finance the Recipient Organizations" and "to anyone other than themselves receiving theinterest derived from those funds." App. 25. The first
count of their complaint alleges that "being forced to associ-ate with the Recipient Organizations" violates their First
Amendment rights, id., at 25, 27-28; the second count allegesthat the "taking" of the interest earned on their funds in the
IOLTA accounts violates the Just Compensation Clause of

devotes a substantial portion of its resources to protecting the speech and
property rights of individuals from undue government interference."
App. 13. The two individuals found to have no standing are LPOs who
alleged that the 1995 amendment adversely affected their earnings because banks that had previously provided them with special services no
longer did so; they did not allege that any of their own funds had been
"taken."

Opinion of the Court
the Fifth Amendment, id., at 28-29; and the third count
alleges that the requirement that client funds be placed in
IOLTA accounts is "an illegal taking of the beneficial use
of those funds," id., at 29. The prayer for relief sought a
refund of interest earned on the plaintiffs' money that had
been placed in IOLTA accounts, a declaration that the IOLTA
Rules are unconstitutional, and an injunction against their
enforcement against LPOs. See id., at 30.

Most of the pretrial discovery related to the question
whether the 1995 Amendment to the IOLTA Rules had indirectly lessened the earnings of LPOs because LPOs no
longer receive certain credits that the banks had provided
them when banks retained the interest earned on escrowed
funds. Each of the petitioners, however, did identify a specific transaction in which interest on his escrow deposit was
paid to the Foundation.

Petitioner Hayes and a man named Fossum made an earnest money deposit of $2,000 on August 14, 1996, and a further payment of $12,793.32 on August 28, 1996, in connection
with a real estate purchase that was closed on August 30,
1996. Id., at 117-118. The money went into an IOLTA account. Presumably those funds, half of which belonged to
Fossum, were used to pay the sales price, "to pay off liens
and obtain releases to clear the title to the property being
conveyed." Id., at 98. The record does not explain exactly
how or when the ultimate recipients of those funds received
or cashed the checks issued to them by the escrowee, but the
parties apparently agree that the deposits generated some
interest on principal that was at least in part owned by
Hayes during the closing.

In connection with a real estate purchase that closed on
May 1, 1997, petitioner Brown made a payment of $90,521.29
that remained in escrow for two days, see id., at 53; he estimated that the interest on that deposit amounted to $4.96,
but he did not claim that he would have received any interest

Opinion of the Court
if the IOLTA Rules had not been in place.5 The record thussuggests, although the facts are not crystal clear, that funds

deposited by each of the petitioners generated some interestthat was ultimately paid to the Foundation. It also seems
clear that without IOLTA those funds would not haveproduced any net interest for either of the petitioners.

After discovery, the District Court granted the defend-ants' motion for summary judgment. As a factual matter
the court concluded "that in no event can the client-depositors make any net returns on the interest accrued in
these accounts. Indeed, if the funds were able to make anynet return, they would not be subject to the IOLTA program." Washington Legal Foundation v. Legal Foundation of Washington, No. C97-0146C (WD Wash., Jan. 30,1998), App. to Pet. for Cert. 94a. As a legal matter, the

court concluded that the constitutional issue focused on whatan owner has lost, not what the " `taker' " has gained, and
that petitioners Hayes and Brown had "lost nothing." Ibid.While the case was on appeal, we decided

Phillips v.Washington Legal Foundation, 524 U. S. 156 (1998). Relying on our opinion in that case, a three-judge panel of theNinth Circuit decided that the IOLTA program caused a taking of petitioners' property and that further proceedingswere necessary to determine whether they are entitled to
just compensation. The panel concluded: "In sum, we holdthat the interest generated by IOLTA pooled trust accounts
is property of the clients and customers whose money is de-posited into trust, and that a government appropriation of
that interest for public purposes is a taking entitling themto just compensation under the Fifth Amendment. But just
compensation for the takings may be less than the amount

of the interest taken, or nothing, depending on the circumstances, so determining the remedy requires a remand."
Washington Legal Foundation v. Legal Founda tion of
Washington, 236 F. 3d 1097, 1115 (2001).

The Court of Appeals then reconsidered the case en banc.
271 F. 3d 835 (CA9 2001). The en banc majority affirmed
the judgment of the District Court, reasoning that, under
the ad hoc approach applied in Penn Central Transp. Co. v.
New York City, 438 U. S. 104 (1978), there was no taking
because petitioners had suffered neither an actual loss nor
an interference with any investment-backed expectations,
and that the regulation of the use of their property was permissible. Moreover, in the majority's view, even if there
were a taking, the just compensation due was zero.

The three judges on the original panel, joined by Judge
Kozinski, dissented. In their view, the majority's reliance
on Penn Central was misplaced because this case involves a
"per se" taking rather than a regulatory taking. 271 F. 3d,
at 865-866. The dissenters adhered to the panel's view that
a remand is necessary in order to decide whether any compensation is due.

In their petition for certiorari, Brown and Hayes asked us
not only to resolve the disagreement between the majority
and the dissenters in the Ninth Circuit about the taking
issue, but also to answer a question that none of those judges
reached, namely, whether injunctive relief is available because the small amounts to which they claim they are entitled render recovery through litigation impractical. We
granted certiorari. 536 U. S. 903 (2002).

III
While it confirms the State's authority to confiscate private property, the text of the Fifth Amendment imposes two
conditions on the exercise of such authority: the taking must
be for a "public use" and "just compensation" must be paid

538US1 Unit: $U35 [10-26-04 19:54:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN
232 BROWN v. LEGAL FOUNDATION OF WASH.

Opinion of the Court
to the owner.6 In this case, the first condition is unquestionably satisfied. If the State had imposed a special tax, or
perhaps a system of user fees, to generate the funds to finance the legal services supported by the Foundation, there
would be no question as to the legitimacy of the use of the
public's money.7 The fact that public funds might pay the
legal fees of a lawyer representing a tenant in a dispute with
a landlord who was compelled to contribute to the program
would not undermine the public character of the "use" of the
funds. Provided that she receives just compensation for the
taking of her property, a conscientious pacifist has no standing to object to the government's decision to use the property she formerly owned for the production of munitions.
Even if there may be occasional misuses of IOLTA funds, the
overall, dramatic success of these programs in serving the
compelling interest in providing legal services to literally
millions of needy Americans certainly qualifies the Foundation's distribution of these funds as a "public use" within the
meaning of the Fifth Amendment.

6 Often referred to as the Just Compensation Clause, the final Clause of
the Fifth Amendment provides: "nor shall private property be taken for
public use, without just compensation." It applies to the States as well
as the Federal Government. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U. S.
226, 239 (1897).

7 As the dissenters in the Ninth Circuit observed in their original panel

opinion: "IOLTA programs spread rapidly because they were an exceedingly intelligent idea. Money that lawyers deposited in bank trust accounts always produced earnings, but before IOLTA, the clients who
owned the money did not receive any of the earnings that their money
produced. IOLTA extracted the earnings from the banks and gave it to
charities, largely to fund legal services for the poor. That is a very worthy purpose." 236 F. 3d 1097, 1115 (2001).

In his dissent from the en banc opinion, Judge Kozinski wrote: "It is no
doubt true that the IOLTA program serves a salutary purpose, one worthy
of our support. As a citizen and former member of the bar, I applaud the
state's effort to provide legal services for the poor and disadvantaged."
271 F. 3d 835, 867 (CA9 2001).

Opinion of the Court
Before moving on to the second condition, the "just com-pensation" requirement, we must address the type of taking,

if any, that this case involves. As we made clear just lastterm:

"The text of the Fifth Amendment itself provides abasis for drawing a distinction between physical takings
and regulatory takings. Its plain language requires thepayment of compensation whenever the government acquires private property for a public purpose, whetherthe acquisition is the result of a condemnation proceeding or a physical appropriation. But the Constitutioncontains no comparable reference to regulations that
prohibit a property owner from making certain uses ofher private property. Our jurisprudence involving condemnations and physical takings is as old as the Repub-lic and, for the most part, involves the straightforward
application of per se rules. Our regulatory takings ju-risprudence, in contrast, is of more recent vintage and
is characterized by `essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries,'
Penn Central, 438 U. S., at 124, designed to allow `care-ful examination and weighing of all the relevant circumstances.' Palazzolo [v. Rhode Island], 533 U. S. [606,]636 [2001] (O'C

onnor, J., concurring)."When the government physically takes possession of

an interest in property for some public purpose, it hasa categorical duty to compensate the former owner,
United States v. Pewee Coal Co., 341 U. S. 114, 115(1951), regardless of whether the interest that is taken
constitutes an entire parcel or merely a part thereof.Thus, compensation is mandated when a leasehold is
taken and the government occupies the property for itsown purposes, even though that use is temporary.
United States v. General Motors Corp., 323 U. S. 373(1945), United States v. Petty Motor Co., 327 U. S. 372
(1946). Similarly, when the government appropriatespart of a rooftop in order to provide cable TV access for

apartment tenants, Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan
CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419 (1982); or when its planes
use private airspace to approach a government airport,
United States v. Causby, 328 U. S. 256 (1946), it is required to pay for that share no matter how small. But
a government regulation that merely prohibits landlords
from evicting tenants unwilling to pay a higher rent,
Block v. Hirsh, 256 U. S. 135 (1921); that bans certain
private uses of a portion of an owner's property, Village
of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365 (1926);
Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480
U. S. 470 (1987); or that forbids the private use of certain
airspace, Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City,
438 U. S. 104 (1978), does not constitute a categorical
taking. `The first category of cases requires courts to
apply a clear rule; the second necessarily entails complex factual assessments of the purposes and economic
effects of government actions.' Yee v. Escondido, 503
U. S. 519, 523 (1992). See also Loretto, 458 U. S., at 440;
Keystone, 480 U. S., at 489, n. 18." Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning
Agency, 535 U. S. 302, 321-323 (2002).

In their complaint, Brown and Hayes separately challenge
(1) the requirement that their funds must be placed in an
IOLTA account (Count III) and (2) the later transfers to the
Foundation of whatever interest is thereafter earned (Count
II). The former is merely a transfer of principal and therefore does not effect a confiscation of any interest. Conceivably it could be viewed as the first step in a "regulatory
taking" which should be analyzed under the factors set forth
in our opinion in Penn Central. Under such an analysis,
however, it is clear that there would be no taking because
the transaction had no adverse economic impact on petitioners and did not interfere with any investment-backed expectation. See 438 U. S., at 124.

235Cite as: 538 U. S. 216 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
Even the dissenters in the Court of Appeals did not dis-agree with the proposition that Penn Central forecloses the

conclusion that there was a regulatory taking effected by theWashington IOLTA program. In their view, however, the
proper focus was on the second step, the transfer of interestfrom the IOLTA account to the Foundation. It was this step
that the dissenters likened to the kind of "per se" takingthat occurred in

Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATVCorp., 458 U. S. 419 (1982).

We agree that a per se approach is more consistent withthe reasoning in our Phillips opinion than Penn Central's
ad hoc analysis. As was made clear in Phillips, the interestearned in the IOLTA accounts "is the `private property' of
the owner of the principal." 524 U. S., at 172. If this is so,the transfer of the interest to the Foundation here seems
more akin to the occupation of a small amount of rooftopspace in Loretto.

We therefore assume that Brown and Hayes retained thebeneficial ownership of at least a portion of their escrow deposits until the funds were disbursed at the closings, thatthose funds generated some interest in the IOLTA accounts,
and that their interest was taken for a public use when itwas ultimately turned over to the Foundation. As the dissenters in the Ninth Circuit explained, though, this does notend our inquiry. Instead, we must determine whether any
"just compensation" is due.

"The Fifth Amendment does not proscribe the taking ofproperty; it proscribes taking without just compensation."

Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamil-ton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U. S. 172, 194 (1985). All of
the Circuit Judges and District Judges who have confrontedthe compensation question, both in this case and in Phillips,
have agreed that the "just compensation" required by theFifth Amendment is measured by the property owner's loss

236 BROWN v. LEGAL FOUNDATION OF WASH.

Opinion of the Court
rather than the government's gain. This conclusion is supported by consistent and unambiguous holdings in our cases.

Most frequently cited is Justice Holmes' characteristically
terse statement that "the question is what has the owner
lost, not what has the taker gained." Boston Chamber of
Commerce v. Boston, 217 U. S. 189, 195 (1910). Also directly
in point is Justice Brandeis' explanation of why a mere technical taking does not give rise to an obligation to pay
compensation:

"We have no occasion to determine whether in law the
President took possession and assumed control of the
Marion & Rye Valley Railway. For even if there was
technically a taking, the judgment for defendant was
right. Nothing was recoverable as just compensation,
because nothing of value was taken from the company;
and it was not subjected by the Government to pecuniary loss." Marion & Rye Valley R. Co. v. United
States, 270 U. S. 280, 282 (1926).

A few years later we again noted that the private party "is
entitled to be put in as good a position pecuniarily as if his
property had not been taken. He must be made whole but
is not entitled to more." Olson v. United States, 292 U. S.
246, 255 (1934).

In Kimball Laundry Co. v. United States, 338 U. S. 1
(1949), although there was disagreement within the Court
concerning the proper measure of the owner's loss when a
leasehold interest was condemned, it was common ground
that the government should pay "not for what it gets but for
what the owner loses." Id., at 23 (Douglas, J., dissenting).
Moreover, in his opinion for the majority, Justice Frankfurter made it clear that, given "the liability of all property
to condemnation for the common good," an owner's nonpecuniary losses attributable to "his unique need for property or
idiosyncratic attachment to it, like loss due to an exercise of

Opinion of the Court
the police power, is properly treated as part of the burdenof common citizenship." Id., at 5.

Applying the teaching of these cases to the question beforeus, it is clear that neither Brown nor Hayes is entitled to
any compensation for the nonpecuniary consequences of thetaking of the interest on his deposited funds, and that any
pecuniary compensation must be measured by his net lossesrather than the value of the public's gain. For that reason,
both the majority 8 and the dissenters 9 on the Court of Ap-peals agreed that if petitioners' net loss was zero, the compensation that is due is also zero.

V
Posing hypothetical cases that explain why a lawyer mightmistakenly deposit funds in an IOLTA account when those

funds might have produced net earnings for the client, theNinth Circuit dissenters concluded that a remand of this case
is necessary to decide whether petitioners are entitled toany compensation.

"Even though when funds are deposited into IOLTAaccounts, the lawyers expect them to earn less than it
would cost to distribute the interest, that expectationcan turn out to be incorrect, as discussed above. Several hypothetical cases illustrate the complexities of theremedies, which need further factual development on remand. Suppose $2,000 is deposited into a lawyer's trustaccount paying 5% and stays there for two days. It
earns about $.55, probably well under the cost of a stampand envelope, along with clerical expenses, needed to
send the $.55 to the client. In that case, the client'sfinancial loss from the taking, if a reasonable charge is

Amendment violation because the value of their just compensation is nil."

Opinion of the Court
made for the administrative expense, is nothing. Thefair market value of a right to receive $.55 by spending

perhaps $5.00 to receive it would be nothing. On theother hand, suppose, hypothetically, that the amount deposited into the trust account is $30,000, and it staysthere for 6 days. The client's loss here would be about
$29.59 if he does not get the interest, which may wellexceed the reasonable administrative expense of paying
it to him out of a common fund. It is hard to see howjust compensation could be zero in this hypothetical taking, even though it would be in the $2,000 for 2 dayshypothetical taking. It may be that the difference between what a pooled fund earns, and what the individualclients and escrow companies lose, adds up to enough to
sustain a valuable IOLTA program while not deprivingany of the clients and customers of just compensation
for the takings. This is a practical question entirely un-developed on this record. We leave it for the parties to
consider during the remedial phase of this litigation."271 F. 3d, at 883.

10

10 The first hypothetical posed by the Ninth Circuit dissenters illustrates
the fundamental flaw in Justice Scalia's approach to this case. Under
his view that just compensation should be measured by the gross amount
of the interest taken by the State, the client should recover the $.55 of
interest earned on a 2-day deposit even when the transaction costs amount
to $2.00. Thus, in this case, under Justice Scalia's approach, even if it
is necessary to incur substantial legal and accounting fees to determine
how many pennies of interest were earned while petitioners' funds remained in escrow and how much of that interest belonged to them rather
than to the sellers, the Constitution would require that they be paid the
gross amount of that interest, rather than an amount equal to their net
loss (which, of course, is zero). As explained above, this is inconsistent
with the Court's just compensation precedents. See supra, at 235-237.

Ironically, Justice Scalia seems to believe that our holding in Webb's
Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U. S. 155 (1980), would support such a bizarre result. In Webb's, however, the transaction cost that
is comparable to the postage in the Ninth Circuit's hypothetical (and to
the potential professional fees in this case) is the clerk's fee of $9,228.74,

239Cite as: 538 U. S. 216 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
These hypotheticals persuade us that lawyers and LPOsmay occasionally deposit client funds in an IOLTA account

when those funds could have produced net interest for theirclients. It does not follow, however, that there is a need for
further hearings to determine whether Brown or Hayes isentitled to any compensation from the respondents.

The Rules adopted and administered by the WashingtonSupreme Court unambiguously require lawyers and LPOs to
deposit client funds in non-IOLTA accounts whenever thosefunds could generate net earnings for the client. See

supra,at 224-225. Thus, if the LPOs who deposited petitioners'

money in IOLTA accounts could have generated net income,the LPOs violated the court's Rules. Any conceivable net
loss to petitioners was the consequence of the LPOs' incor-rect private decisions rather than any state action. Such
mistakes may well give petitioners a valid claim against theLPOs, but they would provide no support for a claim for
compensation from the State, or from any of the respondents.The District Court was therefore entirely correct when it
made the factual finding "that in no event can the client-depositors make any net return on the interest accrued in

which was deducted from the amount held in the interpleader fund. See
id., at 157, 160. The creditors in Webb's recovered an amount equal to
their net loss. Indeed, in Webb's we expressly limited our holding to "the
narrow circumstances of this case," id., at 164, and reserved decision on
the question whether any compensation would have been due if the clerk
had not charged a separate fee. See id., at 164-165.

Justice Scalia is mistaken in stating that we hold that just compensation is measured by the amount of interest "petitioners would have earned
had their funds been deposited in non-IOLTA accounts." Post, at 244
(dissenting opinion). We hold (1) that just compensation is measured by
the net value of the interest that was actually earned by petitioners and
(2) that, by operation of the Washington IOLTA Rules, no net interest can
be earned by the money that is placed in IOLTA accounts in Washington.
See IOLTA Adoption Order, 102 Wash. 2d 1101, 1114 (1984) ("IOLTA funds
are only those funds that cannot, under any circumstances, earn net interest (after deducting transaction and administrative costs and bank fees)
for the client").

these accounts. Indeed, if the funds were able to make anynet return, they would not be subject to the IOLTA program." No. C97-0146C (WD Wash., Jan. 30, 1998), App. toPet. for Cert. 94a.

The categorical requirement in Washington's IOLTA pro-gram that mandates the choice of a non-IOLTA account when
net interest can be generated for the client provided an inde-pendent ground for the en banc court's judgment. It held
that the program did "not work a constitutional violationwith regard to Brown's and Hayes's property: Even if their
property was taken, the Fifth Amendment only protectsagainst a taking without just compensation. Because of the
way the IOLTA program operates, the compensation dueBrown and Hayes for any taking of their property would be
nil. There was therefore no constitutional violation whenthey were not compensated." 271 F. 3d, at 861-862.

We agree with that holding.11

To recapitulate: It is neither unethical nor illegal for law-yers to deposit their clients' funds in a single bank account.

A state law that requires client funds that could not other-wise generate net earnings for the client to be deposited in
an IOLTA account is not a "regulatory taking." A law thatrequires that the interest on those funds be transferred to a
different owner for a legitimate public use, however, couldbe a

per se taking requiring the payment of "just compensa-tion" to the client. Because that compensation is measured

by the owner's pecuniary loss--which is zero whenever theWashington law is obeyed--there has been no violation of
the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment inthis case. It is therefore unnecessary to discuss the reme11 Contrary to Justice Scalia's assertion, this conclusion does not depend on the fact that interest "was created by the beneficence of a state
regulatory program." Post, at 241. It rests instead on the fact that just
compensation for a net loss of zero is zero.

dial question presented in the certiorari petition. Accord-ingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice
Kennedy, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

The Court today concludes that the State of Washingtonmay seize private property, without paying compensation, on

the ground that the former owners suffered no "net loss"because their confiscated property was created by the beneficence of a state regulatory program. In so holding theCourt creates a novel exception to our oft-repeated rule that
the just compensation owed to former owners of confiscatedproperty is the fair market value of the property taken.
What is more, the Court embraces a line of reasoning thatwe explicitly rejected in Phillips v. Washington Legal Foundation, 524 U. S. 156 (1998). Our precedents compel theconclusion that petitioners are entitled to the fair market
value of the interest generated by their funds held in intereston lawyers' trust accounts (IOLTA). I dissent from the
Court's judgment to the contrary.

I
In 1984 the Supreme Court of Washington issued an orderrequiring lawyers to place all client trust funds in "identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts." App. 150. If a cli-ent's funds can be invested to provide a "positive net return"
to the client, the lawyer must place the funds in an accountthat pays interest to the client. If the client's funds cannot
earn a "positive net return" for the client, the funds are tobe deposited in a pooled interest-bearing IOLTA account
with the interest payable to the Legal Foundation of Wash-ington (LFW), a nonprofit organization that provides legal
services for the indigent. A lawyer is not required to obtain
his client's consent, or even notify his client, regarding the

use of client funds in IOLTA accounts or the payment of in-terest to LFW. Id., at 151. The Supreme Court of Washington dismissed all constitutional objections to its 1984order on the now-discredited ground that any interest that
might be earned on IOLTA accounts would not be "property"of the clients. Id., at 158; cf. Phillips, supra.

As the Court correctly notes, Washington's IOLTA pro-gram comprises two steps: First, the State mandates that
certain client trust funds be placed in an IOLTA account,where those funds generate interest. Second, the State
seizes the interest earned on those accounts to fund LFW.
Ante, at 234. With regard to step one, we held in Phillips,supra, that any interest earned on client funds held in

IOLTA accounts belongs to the owner of the principal, notthe State or the State's designated recipient of the interest.
As to step two, the Court assumes, arguendo, that the appro-priation of petitioners' interest constitutes a "taking,"

1 but

holds that just compensation is zero because without themandatory pooling arrangements (step one) of IOLTA, petitioners' funds could not have generated any interest in thefirst place.

2 Ante, at 239-240. This holding contravenes our

1 Although the Ninth Circuit concluded that Washington's IOLTA
scheme did not constitute a "taking" of petitioners' property, Washington
Legal Foundation v. Legal Foundation of Wash., 271 F. 3d 835, 861 (2001),
the Court does not attempt to defend this aspect of the decision. Ante,
at 235.

2 The Court's ruminations on whether the State's IOLTA program satisfies the Fifth Amendment's "public use" requirement, ante, at 231-232,
come as a surprise, inasmuch as they address a nonjurisdictional constitutional issue raised by neither the parties nor their amici. Petitioners'
sole contention in this Court is that the State's IOLTA program violates
the just compensation requirement of the Takings Clause. Brief for Petitioners 18-48; Reply Brief for Petitioners 1-20.

In needlessly addressing this issue, the Court announces a new criterion
for "public use": The requirement is "unquestionably satisfied" if the State
could have raised funds for the same purpose through a "special tax" or a
"system of user fees," ante, at 232. This reduces the "public use" requirement to a negligible impediment indeed, since I am unaware of any use

decision in Phillips--effectively refusing to treat the inter-est as the property of petitioners we held it to be--and

brushes aside 80 years of precedent on determining justcompensation.

II
When a State has taken private property for a public use,the Fifth Amendment requires compensation in the amount

of the market value of the property on the date it is appro-priated. See

United States v. 50 Acres of Land, 469 U. S.24, 29 (1984) (holding that just compensation is " `market

value of the property at the time of the taking' " (emphasisadded) (quoting

Olson v. United States, 292 U. S. 246, 255(1934)));
Kirby Forest Industries, Inc. v. United States, 467
U. S. 1, 10 (1984); United States v. 564.54 Acres of Monroe
and Pike County Land, 441 U. S. 506, 511 (1979); Almota
Farmers Elevator & Warehouse Co. v. United States, 409U. S. 470, 474 (1973);

United States v. Commodities Trading
Corp., 339 U. S. 121, 130 (1950); United States v. New River
Collieries Co., 262 U. S. 341, 344 (1923). As we explained in
United States v. Petty Motor Co., 327 U. S. 372, 377 (1946),"just compensation . . . is not the value to the owner for his

particular purposes or to the condemnor for some special use
to which state taxes cannot constitutionally be devoted. The money thus
derived may be given to the poor, or to the rich, or (insofar as the Federal
Constitution is concerned) to the girlfriend of the retiring Governor.
Taxes and user fees, since they are not "takings," see United States v.
Sperry Corp., 493 U. S. 52, 63 (1989), are simply not subject to the "public
use" requirement, and so their constitutional legitimacy is entirely irrelevant to the existence vel non of a public use.

By raising the analogy of a tax or user fee the Court does, however,
usefully call attention to one of the more offensive features of the takings
scheme devised by the Washington Supreme Court: A tax or user fee
would be enacted by a democratically elected legislature. The IOLTA
scheme, by contrast, circumvents politically accountable decisionmaking,
and effects a taking of clients' funds through application of a rule purportedly regulating professional ethics, promulgated by the Washington Supreme Court. (The taking has nothing to do with ethics, of course.)

but a so-called `market value.' " Our cases have recognizedonly two situations in which this standard is not to be used:

when market value is too difficult to ascertain, and whenpayment of market value would result in " `manifest injustice' " to the owner or the public. See Kirby Forest Indus-tries, Inc., supra, at 10, n. 14.

In holding that any just compensation that might be owedis zero, the Court neither pretends to ascertain the market
value of the confiscated property nor asserts that the casefalls within one of the two exceptions where market value
need not be determined. Instead, the Court proclaims thatjust compensation is to be determined by the former property owner's "net loss," and endorses simultaneously twocompeting and irreconcilable theories of how that loss should
be measured. The Court proclaims its agreement with theNinth Circuit majority that just compensation is the interest
petitioners would have earned had their funds been depos-ited in

non-IOLTA accounts. Ante, at 239-240. See also271 F. 3d 835, 862 (CA9 2001) ("[W]ithout IOLTA, neither

Brown nor Hayes would have earned interest on his princi-pal because by regulatory definition, their funds would have
not otherwise been placed in an IOLTA account"). At thesame time, the Court approves the view of the Ninth Circuit
dissenters that just compensation is the amount of interest
actually earned in petitioners' IOLTA accounts, minus theamount that would have been lost in transaction costs had

petitioners sought to keep the money for themselves. Ante,at 238-239, n. 10. The Court cannot have it both ways--as
the Ninth Circuit itself realized--but even if it could, neitherof the two options from which lower courts may now choose
is consistent with Phillips or our precedents that equate justcompensation with the fair market value of the property
taken. A

Under the Court's first theory, just compensation is zerobecause, under the State Supreme Court's Rules, the only

Scalia, J., dissenting
funds placed in IOLTA accounts are those which could nothave earned net interest for the client

in a non-IOLTA savings account. App. 150. This approach defines petitioners'"net loss" as the amount of interest they would have received

had their funds been deposited in separate, non-IOLTA ac-counts. See

ante, at 239 ("[I]f the [Limited Practice Officers (LPOs)] who deposited petitioners' money in IOLTA accounts could have generated net income, the LPOs violatedthe court's Rules. Any conceivable net loss to petitioners

was the consequence of the LPOs' incorrect private decisionsrather than any state action").

This definition of just compensation has no foundation in
reason. Once interest is earned on petitioners' funds held
in IOLTA accounts, that money is petitioners' property. See
Phillips, 524 U. S., at 168 ("[A]ny interest that does accrue
attaches as a property right incident to the ownership of
the underlying principal"). It is at that point that the State
appropriates the interest to fund LFW--after the interest
has been generated in the pooled accounts--and it is at that
point that just compensation for the taking must be assessed.
It may very well be, as the Court asserts, that petitioners
could not have earned money on their funds absent IOLTA's
mandatory pooling arrangements, but just compensation is
not to be measured by what would have happened in a hypothetical world in which the State's IOLTA program did not
exist. When the State takes possession of petitioners' property--petitioners' money--and transfers it to LFW, the
property obviously has value. The conclusion that it is devoid of value because of the circumstances giving rise to its
creation is indefensible.

Consider the implications of the Court's approach for a
case such as Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith,
449 U. S. 155 (1980), which involved a Florida statute that
allowed the clerk of a court, in his discretion, to invest interpleader funds deposited with that court in interest-bearing
certificates, the interest earned to be deemed " `income of

the office of the clerk of the circuit court.' " Id., at 156, n. 1(quoting Fla. Stat. $ 28.33 (1977)). The appellant in Webb's

had tendered nearly $2 million to a state court after filingan interpleader action, and we held that the state court's
retention of the more than $100,000 in interest generated bythose funds was an uncompensated taking of private property.3 449 U. S., at 164.But what would have been just compensation for the taking in Webb's under today's analysis? It would consist notof the amount of interest

actually earned by the principal,but rather of the amount that would have been earned had

the State not provided for the clerk of court to generate theinterest in the first place. That amount would have been
zero since, as we noted in Webb's, Florida law did not requirethat interest be earned on a registry deposit, id., at 161.
Section 28.33's authorization for the clerk of court to investthe interpleader funds, like the Washington Supreme Court's
IOLTA scheme, was a state-created opportunity to generate
interest on moneys that would otherwise lie fallow. As theFlorida Supreme Court observed, "[i]nterest accrues

only
because of section 28.33. In this sense the statute takesonly what it creates."

Beckwith v. Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc., 374 So. 2d 951, 953 (1979) (emphasis added).In

challenged in Webb's, 449 U. S., at 158, provided that the Clerk of the
Circuit Court would make "charges for services rendered," including
charges for receiving money into the registry of court, $ 28.24(14). These
charges were not deducted from the gross interest earned, as the Court
suggests, ante, at 238-239, n. 10, but from the principal, before any interest had been generated on the interpleader fund. See 449 U. S., at 157-
158. The creditors in Webb's sued to recover the entire interest that had
been earned on the fund pursuant to $ 28.33, id., at 158, and we held that

and is to be allocated to those who are ultimately to be the owners of that
principal," id., at 162.

would otherwise not have come into existence gave licensefor the State to claim the interest for itself. What can possibly explain the contrary holding today? Surely it cannot bethat the Justices look more favorably upon a nationally emulated uncompensated taking of clients' funds to support (hur-rah!) legal services to the indigent than they do upon a more
local uncompensated taking of clients' funds to support noth-ing more inspiring than the Florida circuit courts. That
were surely an unprincipled distinction. But the real, prin-cipled basis for the distinction remains to be disclosed. And
until it is disclosed, today's endorsement of the propositionthat there is no taking when "the State giveth, and the State
taketh away," has potentially far-reaching consequences.May the government now seize welfare benefits, without
paying compensation, on the ground that there was no "netlos[s],"

ante, at 237, to the recipient? Cf. Goldberg v. Kelly,397 U. S. 254 (1970).

What is more, the Court's reasoning calls into questionour holding in

Phillips that interest generated on IOLTAaccounts is the "private property" of the owners of the principal. An ownership interest encumbered by the right ofthe government to seize moneys for itself or transfer them
to the nonprofit organization of its choice is not compatiblewith any notion of "private property." True, the Fifth
Amendment allows the government to appropriate privateproperty without compensation if the market value of the
property is zero (and if it is taken for a "public use"). But

4 The Court claims that its holding "does not depend on the fact that
interest was created by a state regulatory program," and "rests instead
on the fact that just compensation for a net loss of zero is zero." Ante,
at 240, n. 11 (internal quotation marks omitted). This simply disclaims
the ultimate ground by appealing to the proximate ground: The reason
the Court finds there has been a "a net loss of zero" is that the interest
on petitioners' funds is entirely attributable to the merging of those funds
into the IOLTA account--but for IOLTA, they would have earned no interest at all. That is to say, no compensation is due on the interest because
the "interest was created by a state regulatory program."

Scalia, J., dissenting
the Court does not defend the State's action on the groundthat the money taken is worthless, but instead on the ground

that the interest would not have been created but forIOLTA's mandatory pooling arrangements. The Court
thereby embraces precisely the line of argument we rejectedin Phillips: that the interest earned on client funds in IOLTA
accounts could not be deemed "private property" of the cli-ents because those funds "cannot reasonably be expected to
generate interest income on their own." 524 U. S., at 169(internal quotation marks omitted); cf.

id., at 183 (Breyer,J., dissenting).

B
The Court's rival theory for explaining why just compen-sation is zero fares no better. Contrary to its aforementioned description of petitioners' "net loss" as the amounttheir funds would have earned in non-IOLTA accounts,

ante,at 239-240, the Court declares that just compensation is "the

net value of the interest that was actually earned by peti-tioners," ante, at 239, n. 10 (emphasis added)--net value consisting of the value of the funds, less "transaction and admin-istrative costs and bank fees" that would be expended in
extracting the funds from the IOLTA accounts, ibid. Tosupport this concept of "net value," the Court cites nothing
but the cases discussed earlier in its opinion, ante, at 235-237, which establish that just compensation consists of the
value the owner has lost rather than the value the govern-ment has gained. In this case, however, there is

no differ-ence between the two. Petitioners have lost the interest

that Phillips says rightfully belongs to them--which is pre-cisely what the government has gained. The Court's apparent fear that following the Constitution in this case will pro-vide petitioners a "windfall" in the amount of transaction
costs saved is based on the unfounded assumption that theState must return the interest directly to petitioners. The
State could satisfy its obligation to pay just compensation bysimply returning petitioners' money to the IOLTA account

Scalia, J., dissenting
from which it was seized, leaving others to incur the accounting costs in the event petitioners seek to extract their interest from the account.

In any event, our cases that have distinguished the "property owner's loss" from the "government's gain" say nothing
whatever about reducing this value to some "net" amount.
Remarkably, the Court does not cite the recent case of ours
that specifically addresses this issue, and that does so in the
very context of an IOLTA-type scheme. Phillips flatly rejected the notion that just compensation may be reduced by
transaction costs the former owner would have sustained in
retaining his property. See 524 U. S., at 170 ("The government may not seize rents received by the owner of a building
simply because it can prove that the costs incurred in collecting the rents exceed the amount collected"); 5 see also Olson
v. United States, 292 U. S., at 255 ("It is the property and
not the cost of it that is safeguarded by [the] Constitutio[n]").

5 All the Court can muster in response to Phillips' rejection of its view
that the government may seize property for which the administrative
costs of retention exceed market value is a hypothetical posed by the
Ninth Circuit dissenters in support of their suggestion to remand. Ante,
at 238-239, n. 10. The doctrine of stare decisis adopts a different hierarchy: This Court's precedents are to be followed over dissenting opinions
in the Courts of Appeals.

The Court also suggests that the confiscation of petitioners' property is
"comparable to" the clerk's fee under Fla. Stat. $ 28.24 (1977), which we
discussed in Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U. S. 155
(1980). Ante, at 238-239, n. 10. The clerk's fee imposed pursuant to

$ 28.24(14) had nothing to do with "transaction costs" but was a fee for
services rendered by the State itself. 449 U. S., at 157. Here, the State
does not even attempt to characterize its retention of petitioners' interest
in that fashion. While petitioners, their escrow companies, and the banks
holding their funds may very well incur costs in returning the IOLTAgenerated interest to the clients, this does not convert the State's seizure
into a fee. In any event, as noted earlier, supra, at 246, n. 3, we neither
approved nor disapproved the State's retention of fees pursuant to

$ 28.24(14) in Webb's because the parties did not challenge it. 449 U. S.,
at 158.

Scalia, J., dissenting
And if the Federal Government seizes someone's paycheck,it may not deduct from its obligation to pay just compensation the amount that state and local governments would havetaxed, on the ground that it need only compensate the "net
los[s]," ante, at 237, to the former owner. That is why wehave repeatedly held that just compensation is the "market
value" of the confiscated property, rather than the "net loss"to the owner. "Market value" is not reduced by what the
owner would have lost in taxes or other exactions. " `[J]ustcompensation' means the full monetary equivalent of the
property taken." United States v. Reynolds, 397 U. S. 14,16 (1970).

But the irrationality of this aspect of the Court's opiniondoes not end with its blatant contradiction of a precedent
(Phillips) promulgated by a Court consisting of the same
Justices who sit today. Even if "net value" (rather than"market value")

were the appropriate measure of just compensation, the Court has no basis whatsoever for pronounc-ing the "net value" of petitioners' interest to be zero. While

the Court is correct that under the State's IOLTA rules, petitioners' funds could not have earned net interest in separate,
non-IOLTA accounts, ante, at 238-239, n. 10, that has no
bearing on the transaction costs that petitioners would sus-tain in removing their earned interest from the IOLTA accounts.6 The Court today arbitrarily forecloses clients from

6 The Court quotes the Washington Supreme Court's definition of IOLTA
funds as "only those funds that cannot, under any circumstances, earn net
interest (after deducting transaction and administrative costs and bank
fees) for the client." Ante, at 239, n. 10 (quoting IOLTA Adoption Order,
102 Wash. 2d 1101, 1114 (1984) (emphasis deleted)). It is true that IOLTA
funds cannot earn net interest for the client in non-IOLTA accounts, and,
prior to our decision in Phillips v. Washington Legal Foundation, 524
U. S. 156 (1998), also could not earn net interest for the client in IOLTA
accounts because state law declared such interest to be the property of
LFW. After Phillips, however, IOLTA funds can earn net interest for
the client when placed in IOLTA accounts--because all interest earned by
funds in IOLTA accounts is the client's property. See id., at 160.

recovering the "net interest" to which (even under theCourt's definition of just compensation) they are entitled.

What is more, there is no reason to believe that petitionersthemselves do not fall within the class of clients whose funds,
though unable to earn interest in non-IOLTA accounts, nev-ertheless generate "net interest" in IOLTA accounts. That
is why the Ninth Circuit dissenters (who shared the Court'ssecond theory of just compensation but not the first) voted
to remand to the District Court for a factual determinationof what the "net value" of petitioners' interest actually is.

To confuse confusion yet again, the Court justifies its deci-sion

not to remand by simply falling back upon the differenttheory of just compensation espoused by the Ninth Circuit

majority--namely, that just compensation will always bezero because the funds would not have earned interest for
the clients in a non-IOLTA savings account. Ante, at 239-240. See also 271 F. 3d, at 862 ("Brown and Hayes are in
actuality seeking compensation for the value added to theirproperty by Washington's IOLTA program"). That does not
conform, of course, with the Court's previously announcedstandard for just compensation: "the net value of the interest
that was actually earned by petitioners." Ante, at 239,n. 10 (emphasis added).

7 Assessing the "net value" of inter7 In this reprise of its first theory, designed to cover the embarrassing
fact that its second theory does not support its disposition, the Court
makes the assertion that, even if some lawyer mistakenly placed into the
IOLTA account client funds that could have generated net earnings independently (thus rendering even the Court's first theory factually inapplicable), compensation would still not be required, because "[a]ny conceivable
net loss [would be] the consequence of the [lawyer's] incorrect private
decisio[n] rather than any state action." Ante, at 239. That is surely not
correct. Even on the Court's own misbegotten theory, the taking occurs
when the IOLTA interest is transferred to LFW, and compensation is not
payable only if the principal generating that interest could not have
earned interest otherwise. How the principal got into the IOLTA account--mistakenly or otherwise--has nothing to do with whether there
has been a "taking" of "value." The government would owe just compensation for a taking of real property even if the action of some third party

est "actually earned" requires a factual determination of thecosts petitioners would incur if they sought to keep the

IOLTA-generated interest for themselves. By refusing toundertake this inquiry, the Court reveals that its contention
that the value of interest "actually earned" is the measureof just compensation is a facade. The Court's affirmance of
the decision below can only rest on the reasoning adopted bythe Ninth Circuit majority (notwithstanding its rejection in
Phillips): that property created by virtue of a state regula-tory program may be taken without compensation.

Perhaps we are witnessing today the emergence of a wholenew concept in Compensation Clause jurisprudence: the

Robin Hood Taking, in which the government's extraction ofwealth from those who own it is so cleverly achieved, and
the object of the government's larcenous beneficence is sohighly favored by the courts (taking from the rich to give to
indigent defendants) that the normal rules of the Constitu-tion protecting private property are suspended. One must
hope that that is the case. For to extend to the entire run ofCompensation Clause cases the rationale supporting today's
judgment--what the government hath given, the govern-ment may freely take away--would be disastrous.

The Court's judgment that petitioners are not entitled tothe market value of their confiscated property has no basis
in law. I respectfully dissent.
had caused the property mistakenly to be included on the list of properties
scheduled for condemnation. The notion that the government can keep
the property without compensation, and relegate the owner to his remedies against the private party, is nothing short of bizarre. Imagine the
fruitful application of this principle of "intervening private fault" in other
fields: "Yes, you were subjected to a brutally unlawful search and seizure
in connection with our raid upon a street corner where drugs were being
distributed. But since the only reason you were at that corner is that a
taxi dropped you at the wrong address, you must look to Yellow Cab for
your remedy."

Justice Kennedy, dissenting.
The principal dissenting opinion, authored by Justice
Scalia, sets forth a precise, complete, and convincing casefor rejecting the holding and analysis of the Court. I join

the dissent in full.It does seem appropriate to add this further observation.
By mandating that the interest from these accounts servecauses the justices of the Washington Supreme Court prefer,
the State not only takes property in violation of the Fifthand Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the
United States but also grants to itself a monopoly whichmight then be used for the forced support of certain viewpoints. Had the State, with the help of Congress, not actedin violation of its constitutional responsibilities by taking for
itself property which all concede to be that of the client, ante,at 235; Phillips v. Washington Legal Foundation, 524 U. S.
156, 172 (1998), the free market might have created variousand diverse funds for pooling small interest amounts. These
funds would have allowed the true owners of the propertythe option to express views and policies of their own choosing. Instead, as these programs stand today, the true ownercannot even opt out of the State's monopoly.

The First Amendment consequences of the State's actionhave not been addressed in this case, but the potential for a
serious violation is there. See Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed.,431 U. S. 209 (1977);

Keller v. State Bar of Cal., 496 U. S. 1(1990). Today's holding, then, is doubly unfortunate. One

constitutional violation (the taking of property) likely willlead to another (compelled speech). These matters may
have to come before the Court in due course.

BRANCH et al. v. SMITH et al.
appeal from the united states district court for thesouthern district of mississippi

No. 01-1437. Argued December 10, 2002--Decided March 31, 2003*
After the 2000 census caused Mississippi to lose one congressional seat, the

state legislature failed to pass a new redistricting plan. Anticipating
a state-law deadline for qualifying candidates, appellants and crossappellees (state plaintiffs) filed suit in October 2001, asking the State
Chancery Court to issue a redistricting plan for the 2002 elections. In
a similar action, appellees and cross-appellants (federal plaintiffs) asked
the Federal District Court to enjoin the current plan and any statecourt plan, and to order at-large elections pursuant to Miss. Code Ann.

$ 23-15-1039 and 2 U. S. C. $ 2a(c)(5) or, alternatively, to devise its own
redistricting plan. The three-judge District Court permitted the state
plaintiffs to intervene and concluded that it would assert jurisdiction if
it became clear by January 7, 2002, that no state plan would be in place
by March 1. On the eve of the state trial, the State Supreme Court
ruled that the Chancery Court had jurisdiction to issue a redistricting
plan. The Chancery Court adopted such a plan. On December 21,
2001, the state attorney general submitted that plan and the Supreme
Court's decision to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for preclearance
pursuant to $ 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. DOJ requested additional information from the State, noting that the 60-day review period
would commence once that information was received. The information
was provided on February 20, 2002. Meanwhile, the Federal District
Court promulgated a plan that would fix the State's congressional districts for the 2002 elections should the state-court plan not be precleared
by February 25. When that date passed, the District Court enjoined
the State from using the state-court plan and ordered that its own plan
be used in 2002 and until the State produced a precleared, constitutional
plan. The court based the injunction on the failure of the timely preclearance of the state-court plan, but found, in the alternative, that the
state-court plan was unconstitutional. The State did not appeal. DOJ
declined to make a determination about the preclearance submission
because the District Court's injunction rendered the state-court plan
incapable of administration.

*Together with No. 01-1596, Smith et al. v. Branch et al., also on appeal

Held: The judgment is affirmed.
189 F. Supp. 2d 548, affirmed.

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I, II, and III-A, holding:

1. The District Court properly enjoined enforcement of the statecourt plan. Pp. 261-266.

(a) There are two critical distinctions between these cases and
Growe v. Emison, 507 U. S. 25. First, there is no suggestion here that
the District Court failed to allow the state court adequate opportunity
to develop a redistricting plan. Second, the state-court plan here was
subject to $ 5 of the Voting Rights Act. The controversy over whether
the state-court plan was precleared centers on $ 5's proviso that whenever a covered jurisdiction "shall enact or seek to administer" a voting
change, the change may be enforced if the Attorney General does not
object within 60 days. Pp. 261-263.

(b) DOJ's failure to object within 60 days of the state attorney general's original submission did not render the state-court plan enforceable
on February 25. A jurisdiction seeking preclearance must provide the
Attorney General with information sufficient to prove that the change
is nondiscriminatory. DOJ regulations--which are "wholly reasonable
and consistent with the Act," Georgia v. United States, 411 U. S. 526,
541--provide that incomplete state submissions do not start the 60-day
clock, and that the clock begins to run from the date that requested
information is received. DOJ's request here, which was neither frivolous nor unwarranted, postponed the 60-day period. Pp. 263-264.

(c) The state-court plan was also not precleared 60 days after the
state attorney general submitted the requested information. The State
was "seek[ing] to administer" the changes within $ 5's meaning when its
attorney general made his initial submission to DOJ and when he provided additional information. However, when the State failed to appeal
the District Court's injunction, it ceased "seek[ing] to administer" the
state-court plan. The 60-day period was no longer running, so the plan
was not rendered enforceable by operation of law. Because a private
party's actions are not those of a State, the state plaintiffs' appeal is
insufficient to demonstrate that the State still "seek[s] to administer"
the plan. Pp. 264-265.

(d) Since this Court affirms the injunction on the ground that the
state-court plan was not precleared and could not be precleared in time
for the 2002 election, the Court vacates the District Court's alternative
holding that such plan was unconstitutional. Pp. 265-266.

2. The District Court properly fashioned its own congressional reapportionment plan under 2 U. S. C. $ 2c. The tension between

Syllabus

$$ 2a(c)(5) and 2c is apparent: Pending redistricting, $ 2a(c)(5) requires
at-large elections if a State loses a congressional seat, while $ 2c, which
was enacted 26 years later, requires States with more than one Representative to use single-member districts. Contrary to the federal plaintiffs' contention, $ 2c is not limited to legislative action, but also applies
to action by state and federal courts when the prescribed legislative
action has not been forthcoming. When $ 2c was adopted in 1967, the
issue was precisely the courts' involvement in fashioning electoral plans.
The Voting Rights Act had recently been enacted, and this Court's decisions in, e. g., Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, had ushered in a new era in
which federal courts were overseeing efforts by badly malapportioned
States to conform their congressional districts to one-person, onevote standards. Given the risk that judges would simply order at-large
elections, it is most unlikely that $ 2c was directed solely at legislative apportionment. Nor has any court found $ 2c to be so limited.
In addition, $ 2c's language is most susceptible of this interpretation.
Pp. 266-272.

Justice Scalia, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Kennedy,
and Justice Ginsburg, concluded in Part III-B that $ 2a(c)--where
what it prescribes is constitutional (as it is in paragraph (5))--applies
when a state legislature and the state and federal courts have all failed
to redistrict pursuant to $ 2c. This interpretation allows both $$ 2a(c)
and 2c to be given effect. Section 2a(c) governs the manner of any
election held "[u]ntil a State is redistricted in the manner provided by
[state] law after any apportionment." When a court redistricts pursuant to $ 2c, it necessarily does so in such a manner because it must follow
the State's "policies and preferences" for districting. White v. Weiser,
412 U. S. 783, 795. A court may invoke $ 2a(c)'s stopgap provision only
when an election is so imminent that redistricting pursuant to state law
(including $ 2c's mandate) cannot be completed without disrupting the
election process. Mississippi's at-large provision should be deemed operative when $$ 2a(c)(2) and (5) would be: The state provision envisions
both legislatively and judicially prescribed change and does not come
into play as long as it is feasible for a state or federal court to complete
redistricting. Pp. 273-276.

Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Souter and Justice Breyer,
while agreeing that the District Court properly enjoined the state-court
plan's enforcement and promulgated its own plan under 2 U. S. C. $ 2c,
concluded that $ 2c impliedly repealed $ 2a(c) and that the 1967 federal
Act pre-empted Mississippi's statutory authorization for at-large congressional elections. The presumption against implied repeals, like
that against pre-emption, is overcome if there is an irreconcilable conflict between the two provisions or if the later Act was clearly intended

to "cove[r] the whole subject of the earlier one." Posadas v. National
City Bank, 296 U. S. 497, 503. By prohibiting States with more than
one Representative from electing Representatives at-large, the 1967 Act
unambiguously forbids elections that $ 2a(c)(5) would otherwise authorize. Thus, under either of Posadas' standards, the 1967 Act repealed
the earlier $ 2a(c)(5) and pre-empted Mississippi's law. Any fair reading
of the history leading to the 1967 Act's passage shows that the parties
believed that the changes they were debating would completely replace

$ 2a(c). The statute was the final gasp in a protracted legislative process. Four versions of the original bill expressly repealed $ 2a(c), and
there was no disagreement about that provision. When that bill did
not pass, its less controversial parts, including what is now $ 2c, were
attached to a private bill. The absence of any discussion, debate, or
reference to the repeal provision in the legislative process prevents its
omission from the final private bill as being seen as a deliberate choice
by Congress. Pp. 285-292.

In these cases, we decide whether the District Court prop-erly enjoined a Mississippi state court's proposed congressional redistricting plan and whether it properly fashionedits own congressional reapportionment plan rather than
order at-large elections. I

The 2000 census caused Mississippi to lose one congres-sional seat, reducing its representation in the House of Representatives from five Members to four. The state legisla-ture, however, failed to pass a new redistricting plan after
the decennial census results were published in 2001. In an-ticipation of the March 1, 2002, state-law deadline for the
qualification of candidates, see Miss. Code Ann. $ 23-15-299(Lexis 2001), appellant and cross-appellee Beatrice Branch
and others (state plaintiffs) filed suit in a Mississippi StateChancery Court in October 2001, asking the state court to

Opinion of the Court
1037 (Lexis 2001), dividing the State into five, rather thanfour, congressional districts, was unconstitutional and unenforceable. The federal plaintiffs asked the District Court toenjoin the current redistricting plan, and subsequently asked
it to enjoin any plan developed by a state court (which theyasserted would violate Article I, $ 4, of the Constitution, and,
in any event, could not be enforced until the state court's
assertion of redistricting authority was precleared under $ 5of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 439, 42 U. S. C.

$ 1973c), and asked that it order at-large elections pursuantto Miss. Code Ann. $ 23-15-1039 (2001) and 46 Stat. 26, 2
U. S. C. $ 2a(c)(5), or, alternatively, devise its own redistricting plan.

A three-judge District Court was convened pursuant to 28
U. S. C. $ 2284. Initially the District Court did not interfere
with the State Chancery Court's efforts to develop a redistricting plan. In an order filed on December 5, 2001, Smith
v. Clark, 189 F. Supp. 2d 502 (SD Miss.), the District Court
permitted the state plaintiffs to intervene and deferred ruling on the federal plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. In staying its hand, the District Court recognized that
" `the Constitution leaves with the States primary responsibility for apportionment of their federal congressional . . .
districts,' " id., at 503 (quoting Growe v. Emison, 507 U. S.
25, 34 (1993)), but concluded that "if it is not clear to this
court by January 7, 2002 that the State authorities can have
a redistricting plan in place by March 1, we will assert our
jurisdiction . . . and if necessary, we will draft and implement
a plan for reapportioning the state congressional districts,"
189 F. Supp. 2d, at 503; see also 189 F. Supp. 2d 503, 505-506
(SD Miss. 2002).

On the eve of the State Chancery Court trial, the Mississippi Supreme Court denied petitions for writs of prohibition
and mandamus filed by a state defendant and others challenging the Chancery Court's jurisdiction to engage in congressional redistricting. It held that the Chancery Court

Opinion of the Court
had jurisdiction to issue a redistricting plan. In re Mauldin, Civ. No. 2001-M-01891 (Dec. 13, 2001), App. to Juris.
Statement 110a. Following trial, on December 21, 2001, theState Chancery Court adopted a redistricting plan submitted

by the state plaintiffs. On December 26, the state attorneygeneral submitted that plan, along with the Mississippi Supreme Court's Mauldin decision (which arguably changed
the process for drawing congressional districts by authoriz-ing the Chancery Court to create a redistricting plan), to the

Department of Justice (DOJ) for preclearance. On February14, 2002, DOJ sent a letter to the state attorney general requesting additional information about the Mauldin decision,
because "the information sent to date regarding this change
in voting procedure is insufficient . . . ." App. to Juris.
Statement 193a. The letter advised that the "sixty-day
review period will begin when we receive the information
specified." Id., at 196a. The state attorney general provided additional information on February 19 and 20, 2002.

Meanwhile, in January 2002, the District Court, expressing "serious doubts whether the Mississippi Supreme Court's
Order and the plan adopted by the Chancery Court pursuant
to that order will be precleared prior to the March 1 candidate qualification deadline," 189 F. Supp. 2d, at 508, had
begun to develop its own redistricting plan, id., at 511. On
February 4, 2002, it promulgated a redistricting plan to be
used absent the timely preclearance of the Chancery Court
plan. 189 F. Supp. 2d 512 (SD Miss.). On February 19, it
ordered that, if the Chancery Court redistricting plan was
not "precleared before the close of business on Monday, February 25, 2002," then the District Court's plan would fix the
Mississippi congressional districts for the 2002 elections.
189 F. Supp. 2d 529, 548. February 25th came and went
with no action by DOJ. On February 26, the District Court
enjoined the State from using the Chancery Court plan and
ordered use of the District Court's own plan in the 2002 elections and all succeeding elections until the State produced

Opinion of the Court
a constitutional redistricting plan that was precleared. 189F. Supp. 2d 548, 559. The court said that the basis for its

injunction and order was "reflected in our opinion of Febru-ary 19, that is, the failure of the timely preclearance under

$ 5 of the Voting Rights Act of the Hinds County ChanceryCourt's plan." Id., at 549. However, "in the event that
on appeal it is determined that we erred in our February19 ruling," the court put forth as its "alternative holding"
that Article I, $ 4, of the United States Constitution prohib-ited the State Chancery Court from issuing a redistricting
plan without express authorization from the state legisla-ture.

Ibid.The State did not file a notice of appeal. On April 1, 2002,

DOJ informed the State in a letter that "it would be inappro-priate for the Attorney General to make a determination
concerning [the State's preclearance] submission now" be-cause the District Court's injunction rendered the statecourt plan incapable of administration. App. 29.The state plaintiffs--intervenors in the District Court--
filed a timely notice of appeal from the District Court and ajurisdictional statement. The federal plaintiffs filed a jurisdictional statement on conditional cross-appeal. We notedprobable jurisdiction in both appeals and consolidated them.
536 U. S. 903 (2002). II

At the outset we should observe two critical distinctionsbetween these cases and the one that was before us in

Growev. Emison, 507 U. S. 25 (1993). In Growe, the Federal District Court had refused to abstain or defer to state-courtredistricting proceedings. Id., at 30-31. In reversing, we
reminded the federal courts of " `what has been said on manyoccasions: reapportionment is primarily the duty and responsibility of the State through its legislature or other body,rather than of a federal court.' " Id., at 34 (quoting Chapman v. Meier, 420 U. S. 1, 27 (1975)). We held that "[a]bsentevidence that these state branches will fail

timely to perform

538US1 Unit: $U36 [10-31-04 19:50:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN
262 BRANCH v. SMITH

Opinion of the Court
that duty, a federal court must neither affirmatively obstructstate reapportionment nor permit federal litigation to be

used to impede it." 507 U. S., at 34 (emphasis added). Inthe present cases, unlike in

Growe, there is no suggestion
that the District Court failed to allow the state court ade-quate opportunity to develop a redistricting plan. The second distinction is that the state-court plan here, unlike that
in Growe, was subject to $ 5 of the Voting Rights Act, 42U. S. C. $ 1973c. The District Court rested its injunction of

the state-court plan on the ground that necessary preclear-ance had not been obtained. It is that challenged premise
that we examine first.

Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act provides that whenever
a covered jurisdiction, such as Mississippi, see 30 Fed. Reg.
9897 (1965), "shall enact or seek to administer" a change in
"any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure," the State must obtain preclearance from the District Court for the District of Columbia or
the Attorney General before the change may be enforced.
42 U. S. C. $ 1973c. The Act requires preclearance of all
voting changes, ibid.; see Dougherty County Bd. of Ed.
v. White, 439 U. S. 32, 38-39 (1978), and there is no dispute
that this includes voting changes mandated by order of a
state court, see, e. g., In re McMillin, 642 So. 2d 1336, 1339
(Miss. 1994). Rather, the controversy pertains to the proviso in $ 1973c to the effect that, where the preclearance submission is made to the Attorney General, the voting change
may be enforced if "the Attorney General has not interposed
an objection within sixty days after such submission . . . ."

Appellants in No. 01-1437 (originally the state plaintiffs)
assert that the District Court erred in believing that the
Chancery Court's plan lacked preclearance. It was automatically rendered enforceable, they contend, by DOJ's failure
to object within the 60-day period running from the state
attorney general's initial submission on December 26, 2001--
or, in the alternative, it was subsequently rendered enforce538US1 Unit: $U36 [10-31-04 19:50:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
able by DOJ's failure to object within the 60-day period run-ning from the state attorney general's submission of additional information on February 20, 2002. We consider eachof these contentions in turn.

A
Under $ 5, a jurisdiction seeking administrative preclear-ance must prove that the change is nondiscriminatory in purpose and effect. Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd., 528U. S. 320, 328 (2000). It bears the burden of providing the
Attorney General information sufficient to make that proof,
Georgia v. United States, 411 U. S. 526, 537-539 (1973), andfailure to do so will cause the Attorney General to object,

see ibid.; 28 CFR $ 51.52(c) (2002). In DOJ's view, however,incomplete state submissions do not start the 60-day clock
for review. See $$ 51.27, 51.37. The regulations imple-menting $ 5 authorize a DOJ request for additional information from a jurisdiction that has initially "omittedinformation considered necessary for the evaluation of
the submission." $ 51.37(a). If the jurisdiction responds bysupplying the additional information (or stating that it is unavailable), the 60-day clock begins to run from the date theresponse is received. $ 51.37(c). We have upheld these regulations as being "wholly reasonable and consistent with theAct."

Georgia v. United States, supra, at 541; accord, Mor-ris v. Gressette, 432 U. S. 491, 504, n. 19 (1977).

DOJ's February 14 request for additional information waswithin the Attorney General's discretion under 28 CFR

$ 51.37, thereby postponing the 60-day time period for objec-tions until the requested information was received. The request was neither frivolous nor unwarranted. See Georgiav. United States, supra, at 541, n. 13. DOJ believed that the
Mississippi Supreme Court's Mauldin order, holding that theChancery Court had jurisdiction to engage in redistricting,
was a change in voting procedures, and it sought additionalinformation demonstrating that this change would not have

538US1 Unit: $U36 [10-31-04 19:50:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN
264 BRANCH v. SMITH

Opinion of the Court
the purpose or effect of denying or abridging the right to
vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language
minority group, as required under $ 5. The fact that the
District Court identified the same issue as posing a hurdle
to preclearance further suggests that DOJ's request was
not frivolous. 189 F. Supp. 2d, at 508-509. The request for
more information was not frivolous or unwarranted at the
time it was made, regardless of whether it ultimately develops that Mauldin and the Chancery Court's assertion of jurisdiction to redistrict are not voting changes that required
preclearance.

B

Appellants contend that even if the State Chancery
Court's plan was not precleared by operation of law on February 25, 2002, it was precleared on April 22, 60 days after
the state attorney general submitted the additional information requested. We think not.

Section 5 provides that "[w]henever a [covered jurisdiction] shall enact or seek to administer" a voting change, such
a change may be enforced if it is submitted to the Attorney
General and there is no objection by the Attorney General
within 60 days. 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c (emphasis added).
Clearly the State Chancery Court's redistricting plan was
not "enacted" by the State of Mississippi. An "enactment"
is the product of legislation, not adjudication. See Webster's New International Dictionary 841 (2d ed. 1949) (defining "enact" as "[t]o make into an act or law; esp., to perform
the legislative act with reference to (a bill) which gives
it the validity of law"); Black's Law Dictionary 910 (7th
ed. 1999) (defining "legislate" as "[t]o make or enact laws").
The web of state and federal litigation before us is the consequence of the Mississippi Legislature's failure to enact a
plan. The Chancery Court's redistricting plan, then, could
be eligible for preclearance only if the State was "seek[ing]
to administer" it.

265Cite as: 538 U. S. 254 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
There is no doubt that the State was "seek[ing] to administer" the changes for which preclearance was sought when
the Mississippi attorney general made his initial submission
to DOJ on December 26, 2001, and when he provided additional information regarding the state-court plan on February 20, 2002. On February 26, 2002, however, the District
Court "enjoined [the State] from implementing the congressional redistricting plan adopted by the [state court]," 189
F. Supp. 2d, at 559, and the State never appealed that injunction. Uncontrovertibly, the State was no longer "seek[ing]
to administer" the state-court plan, and thus the 60-day time
period for DOJ review was no longer running. The passing
of 60 days from the date of the State's February 20, 2002,
submission of the additional requested information had no
legal significance, and the state-court plan was not rendered
enforceable by operation of law.

Appellants' argument--that their appeal, as intervenors,
is sufficient to demonstrate that the State still "seek[s] to
administer" the state-court plan--is invalid on its face. The
actions of a private party are not the actions of a State and
cannot satisfy the prerequisite to $ 5 preclearance.

C
Since we affirm the injunction on the basis of the District
Court's principal stated ground that the state-court plan had
not been precleared and had no prospect of being precleared
in time for the 2002 election, we have no occasion to address
the District Court's alternative holding that the State Chancery Court's redistricting plan was unconstitutional--a holding that the District Court specified was set forth to cover
the eventuality of the principal stated ground's being rejected on appeal--and therefore we vacate it as a basis for
the injunction. The District Court's alternative holding is
not to be regarded as supporting the injunction we have affirmed on the principal ground, or as binding upon state and

Having determined that the District Court properly en-joined enforcement of the state-court redistricting plan, we

turn to the propriety of the redistricting plan that the Dis-trict Court itself adopted. Cross-appellees in No. 01-1596
(originally the state plaintiffs) and the United States, as
amicus curiae, argue that the District Court was requiredto draw (as it did) single-member congressional districts;

cross-appellants in No. 01-1596 (originally the federal plain-tiffs) contend that it was required to order at-large elections
for the congressional seats. We must decide whether, ascross-appellees contend, the District Court was governed by
the provisions of 2 U. S. C. $ 2c; or, as cross-appellants con-tend, by the provisions of 2 U. S. C. $ 2a(c)(5).

A
Article I, $ 4, cl. 1, of the Constitution provides that the"Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators

and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State bythe Legislature thereof . . . ." It reserves to Congress, however, the power "at any time by Law [to] make or alter suchRegulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators."
Ibid. Pursuant to this authority, Congress in 1929 enactedthe current statutory scheme governing apportionment of
the House of Representatives. 2 U. S. C. $$ 2a(a), (b). In1941, Congress added to those provisions a subsection addressing what is to be done pending redistricting:

"Until a State is redistricted in the manner providedby the law thereof after any apportionment, the Representatives to which such State is entitled under suchapportionment shall be elected in the following manner:
(1) If there is no change in the number of Represent-atives, they shall be elected from the districts then

Opinion of the Court
prescribed by the law of such State, and if any of themare elected from the State at large they shall continue

to be so elected; (2) if there is an increase in the numberof Representatives, such additional Representative or
Representatives shall be elected from the State at largeand the other Representatives from the districts then
prescribed by the law of such State; (3) if there is a de-crease in the number of Representatives but the number
of districts in such State is equal to such decreased num-ber of Representatives, they shall be elected from the
districts then prescribed by the law of such State; (4) ifthere is a decrease in the number of Representatives
but the number of districts in such State is less thansuch number of Representatives, the number of Representatives by which such number of districts is exceededshall be elected from the State at large and the other
Representatives from the districts then prescribed bythe law of such State; or (5) if there is a decrease in the
number of Representatives and the number of districtsin such State exceeds such decreased number of Representatives, they shall be elected from the State atlarge." $ 2a(c).

In 1967, 26 years after $ 2a(c) was enacted, Congress adopted$ 2c, which provides, as relevant here:

"In each State entitled in the Ninety-first Congress orin any subsequent Congress thereafter to more than one
Representative under an apportionment made pursuantto the provisions of section 2a(a) of this title, there shall
be established by law a number of districts equal to thenumber of Representatives to which such State is so
entitled, and Representatives shall be elected only fromdistricts so established, no district to elect more than
one Representative . . . ."
The tension between these two provisions is apparent:Section 2c requires States entitled to more than one Repre538US1 Unit: $U36 [10-31-04 19:50:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
sentative to elect their Representatives from single-memberdistricts, rather than from multimember districts or the

State at large. Section 2a(c), however, requires multimem-ber districts or at-large elections in certain situations; and
with particular relevance to the present cases, in which Mis-sissippi, by reason of the 2000 census, lost a congressional
seat, $ 2a(c)(5) requires at-large elections. Cross-appellants
would reconcile the two provisions by interpreting the intro-ductory phrase of $ 2a(c) ("Until a State is redistricted in the

manner provided by the law thereof after any apportion-ment") and the phrase "established by law" in $ 2c to refer
exclusively to legislative redistricting--so that $ 2c tells
the legislatures what to do (single-member districting) and

$ 2a(c) provides what will happen absent legislative action--
in the present cases, the mandating of at-large elections.

The problem with this reconciliation of the provisions is
that the limited role it assigns to $ 2c (governing legislative
apportionment but not judicial apportionment) is contradicted both by the historical context of $ 2c's enactment and
by the consistent understanding of all courts in the almost
40 years since that enactment. When Congress adopted $ 2c
in 1967, the immediate issue was precisely the involvement
of the courts in fashioning electoral plans. The Voting
Rights Act of 1965 had recently been enacted, assigning to
the federal courts jurisdiction to involve themselves in elections. See 79 Stat. 439 (as amended and codified at 42
U. S. C. $ 1973 et seq.). Even more significant, our decisions
in Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186 (1962), Wesberry v. Sanders,
376 U. S. 1 (1964), and Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533 (1964),
had ushered in a new era in which federal courts were overseeing efforts by badly malapportioned States to conform
their congressional electoral districts to the constitutionally
required one-person, one-vote standards. In a world in
which the role of federal courts in redistricting disputes had
been transformed from spectating, see Colegrove v. Green,
328 U. S. 549 (1946) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.), to directing,

Opinion of the Court
the risk arose that judges forced to fashion remedies wouldsimply order at-large elections.

At the time Congress enacted $ 2c, at least six DistrictCourts, two of them specifically invoking 2 U. S. C. $ 2a(c)(5),
had suggested that if the state legislature was unable to re-district to correct malapportioned congressional districts,
they would order the State's entire congressional delegation
to be elected at large. On March 26, 1964, a three-judgeDistrict Court ordered that, pending enactment of a constitutional redistricting plan by the Michigan Legislature,all Michigan Representatives would be elected at large.
Calkins v. Hare, 228 F. Supp. 824, 830 (ED Mich. 1964). On
October 19, 1964, a three-judge District Court entered a
similar order for the State of Texas. See Bush v. Martin,
251 F. Supp. 484, 489, and n. 11, 490, and n. 17 (SD Tex.
1966). On February 3, 1965, a three-judge District Court in
Arkansas, whose House delegation had decreased from six to
four Members after the 1960 census, stated that under

$ 2a(c)(5), "if the Legislature . . . had taken no action [after
the 1960 apportionment] the congressmen would have been
required to run at large," and that the same reasoning would
compel the court to require at-large elections if the legislature adopted malapportioned congressional districts. Park
v. Faubus, 238 F. Supp. 62, 66 (ED Ark. 1965). On August 5,
1966, a three-judge District Court in Missouri, whose House
delegation had decreased from 11 to 10 Members after the
1960 census, informed the State that if it was unable to redistrict in accordance with the Constitution, then pursuant to
the "command of Section 2(a)(c) [sic]," "the congressional
elections for Missouri will be ordered conducted at large
until new and constitutional districts are created." Preisler
v. Secretary of State of Missouri, 257 F. Supp. 953, 981, 982

Opinion of the Court
held forth the possibility of requiring at-large elections.With all this threat of judicially imposed at-large elections,

and (as far as we are aware) no threat of a legislatively im-posed change to at-large elections, it is most unlikely that

$ 2c was directed solely at legislative reapportionment.Nor have the courts ever thought so. To the contrary,
every court that has addressed the issue has held that $ 2c
requires courts, when they are remedying a failure to redis-trict constitutionally, to draw single-member districts whenever possible. The first court to examine $ 2c, just twoweeks after the statute was enacted, was the three-judge
District Court in Missouri that had previously threatened to
order at-large elections in accordance with $ 2a(c)(5). In its
decision on December 29, 1967, that court observed that the
enactment of $ 2c had "relieved [it] of the prior existing Congressional command to order that the 1968 and succeeding
congressional elections in Missouri be held at large," Preisler v. Secretary of State of Missouri, 279 F. Supp. 952, 969
(WD Mo. 1967), aff 'd, 394 U. S. 526 (1969), and accordingly
reversed its prior position and stated that it would fashion a
districting plan if the State failed to fulfill its duty. Four
years later, the Supreme Court of Virginia denied a writ of
mandamus directing at-large elections to replace an allegedly
unconstitutional Redistricting Act, on the ground that by
reason of $ 2c "we cannot legally issue the writ." Simpson
v. Mahan, 212 Va. 416, 417, 185 S. E. 2d 47, 48 (1971). The
next year the Supreme Court of California reached the same
conclusion that $ 2c required it to establish single-member
districts, see Legislature v. Reinecke, 6 Cal. 3d 595, 602-603,
492 P. 2d 385, 390 (1972), a conclusion that it reaffirmed in
1982, see Assembly of State of Cal. v. Deukmejian, 30 Cal.
3d 638, 664, 639 P. 2d 939, 955 (1982). In Shayer v. Kirkpatrick, 541 F. Supp. 922, 926 (WD Mo.), aff 'd sub nom. Schatzle
v. Kirkpatrick, 456 U. S. 966 (1982), the District Court concluded that "nothing in section 2c suggests any limitation
on its applicability," and declined to order at-large elections

Opinion of the Court
pursuant to $ 2a(c)(5) because $ 2c "appears to prohibit at-large elections." And in

Carstens v. Lamm, 543 F. Supp.
68 (Colo. 1982), the District Court reached a substantiallyidentical result, although contemplating that $ 2a(c) provided

a "stop-gap measure" in the "event that no constitutional re-districting plan exists on the eve of a congressional election,
and there is not enough time for either the Legislature or
the courts to develop an acceptable plan," id., at 77, and n. 23.It bears noting that this Court affirmed two of the District

Court decisions described above, see Preisler, supra, and
Shayer, supra, one without discussing $ 2c, and one summarily. And in 1971 we observed in dictum that "[i]n 1967,
Congress reinstated the single-member district requirement" that had existed before the enactment of $ 2a(c).
Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U. S. 124, 159, n. 39 (1971).

Of course the implausibility (given the circumstances of
its enactment) that $ 2c was meant to apply only to legislative reapportionment, and the unbroken unanimity of state
and federal courts in opposition to that interpretation, would
be of no consequence if the text of $ 2c (and of $ 2a(c))
unmistakably demanded that interpretation. But it does
not. Indeed, it is more readily susceptible of the opposite
interpretation.

The clause "there shall be established by law a number of
districts equal to the number of Representatives to which
such State is so entitled" could, to be sure, be so interpreted
that the phrase "by law" refers only to legislative action.
Its more common meaning, however, encompasses judicial
decisions as well. See, e. g., Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U. S. 730,
741 (2002) (referring to judicial decisions as "established law"
in qualified immunity context); Swidler & Berlin v. United
States, 524 U. S. 399, 407 (1998) (referring to judicial decisions as "established law" in the attorney-client privilege
context); United States v. Frady, 456 U. S. 152, 166 (1982)
(referring to the judicially established standard of review for
a 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 motion as "long-established law"); see

Opinion of the Court
also $ 2254(d)(1) ("clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States"); Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803) (it is "the province
and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is").

We think, therefore, that while $ 2c assuredly envisions
legislative action, it also embraces action by state and federal courts when the prescribed legislative action has not
been forthcoming. We might note that giving "by law" its
less common meaning would cause the immediately following
clause of $ 2c ("and Representatives shall be elected only
from districts so established" (emphasis added)) to exclude
all courts from redistricting, including even state courts acting pursuant to state legislative authorization in the event
of legislative default. It is hard to see what plausible congressional purpose this would serve. When, as here, the situation (a decrease in the number of Representatives, all of
whom were formerly elected from single-member districts)
enables courts to prescribe at-large elections under paragraph (5) of $ 2a(c) (assuming that section subsists, see infra,
at 273), it can be said that there is a constitutional fallback.
But what would occur if the situation called for application
of paragraphs (1) to (4) of $ 2a(c), none of which is constitutionally enforceable when (as is usual) the decennial census
has shown a proscribed degree of disparity in the voting population of the established districts? The absolute prohibition of $ 2c ("Representatives shall be elected only from
[single-member] districts [legislatively] established") would
be subject to no exception, and courts would (despite Baker
v. Carr) be congressionally forbidden to act when the state
legislature has not redistricted. Only when it is utterly unavoidable should we interpret a statute to require an unconstitutional result--and that is far from the situation here.

In sum, $ 2c is as readily enforced by courts as it is by
state legislatures, and is just as binding on courts--federal
or state--as it is on legislatures.

Opinion of Scalia, J.

B
Having determined that in enacting 2 U. S. C. $ 2c, Con-gress mandated that States are to provide for the election of

their Representatives from single-member districts, and thatthis mandate applies equally to courts remedying a state legislature's failure to redistrict constitutionally, we confrontthe remaining question: what to make of $ 2a(c)? As observed earlier, the texts of $ 2c and $ 2a(c)(5) are in tension.Representatives cannot be "elected only from districts," $ 2c,
while being elected "at large," $ 2a(c). Some of the courtsconfronted with this conflict have concluded that $ 2c repeals $ 2a(c) by implication. See Shayer v. Kirkpatrick, 541F. Supp., at 927; Assembly of State of Cal. v. Deukmejian,
30 Cal. 3d, at 663-664, 639 P. 2d, at 954. There is somethingto be said for that position--especially since paragraphs
(1) through (4) of $ 2a(c) have become (because of postenact-ment decisions of this Court) in virtually all situations
plainly unconstitutional. (The unlikely exception is the situ-ation in which the decennial census makes no districting
change constitutionally necessary.) Eighty percent of thesection being a dead letter, why would Congress adhere to
the flotsam of paragraph (5)?We have repeatedly stated, however, that absent "a clearly
expressed congressional intention," Morton v. Mancari, 417U. S. 535, 551 (1974), "repeals by implication are not favored," Universal Interpretive Shuttle Corp. v. Washington
Metropolitan Area Transit Comm'n, 393 U. S. 186, 193(1968). An implied repeal will only be found where provisions in two statutes are in "irreconcilable conflict," or wherethe latter Act covers the whole subject of the earlier one and
"is clearly intended as a substitute." Posadas v. NationalCity Bank, 296 U. S. 497, 503 (1936). So while there is a
strong argument that $ 2c was a substitute for $ 2a(c), wethink the better answer is that $ 2a(c)--where what it prescribes is constitutional (as it is with regard to paragraph(5))--continues to apply.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
Section 2a(c) is, of course, only provisionally applicable.It governs the manner of election for Representatives in any

election held "[u]ntil a State is redistricted in the mannerprovided by the law thereof after any apportionment."
That language clashes with $ 2c only if it is interpreted toforbid judicial redistricting unless the state legislature has
first acted. On that interpretation, whereas $ 2c categorically instructs courts to redistrict, $ 2a(c)(5) forbids them todo anything but order at-large elections unless the state legislature has acted. But there is of course no need for suchan interpretation. "Until a State is redistricted" can certainly refer to redistricting by courts as well as by legislatures. Indeed, that interpretation would seem the preferable one even if it were not a necessary means of reconciling
the two sections. Under prior versions of $ 2a(c), its default
or stopgap provisions were to be invoked for a State "until
the legislature of such State . . . [had] redistrict[ed] such
State." Act of Jan. 16, 1901, ch. 93, $ 4, 31 Stat. 734 (emphasis added); see Act of Feb. 7, 1891, ch. 116, $ 4, 26 Stat. 736
("until such State be redistricted as herein prescribed by the
legislature of said State" (emphasis added)); Act of Feb. 25,
1882, ch. 20, $ 3, 22 Stat. 6 ("shall be elected at large, unless
the Legislatures of said States have provided or shall otherwise provide" (emphasis added)). These provisions are in
stark contrast to the text of the current $ 2a(c): "[u]ntil a
State is redistricted in the manner provided by the law
thereof."

If the more expansive (and more natural) interpretation of

$ 2a(c) is adopted, its condition can be met--and its demand
for at-large elections suspended--by the very court that follows the command of $ 2c. For when a court, state or federal, redistricts pursuant to $ 2c, it necessarily does so "in
the manner provided by [state] law." It must follow the
"policies and preferences of the State, as expressed in statutory and constitutional provisions or in the reapportionment
plans proposed by the state legislature," except, of course,

when "adherence to state policy . . . detract[s] from the re-quirements of the Federal Constitution." White v. Weiser,

412 U. S. 783, 795 (1973). Federal constitutional prescrip-tions, and federal statutory commands such as that of $ 2c,
are appropriately regarded, for purposes of $ 2a(c), as a partof the state election law.

Thus, $ 2a(c) is inapplicable unless the state legislature,and state and federal courts, have all failed to redistrict pursuant to $ 2c. How long is a court to await that redistrictingbefore determining that $ 2a(c) governs a forthcoming election? Until, we think, the election is so imminent that noentity competent to complete redistricting pursuant to state
law (including the mandate of $ 2c) is able to do so withoutdisrupting the election process. Only then may $ 2a(c)'s
stopgap provisions be invoked. Thus, $ 2a(c) cannot be prop-erly applied--neither by a legislature nor a court--as long
as it is feasible for federal courts to effect the redistrictingmandated by $ 2c. So interpreted, $ 2a(c) continues to function as it always has, as a last-resort remedy to be appliedwhen, on the eve of a congressional election, no constitutional
redistricting plan exists and there is no time for either theState's legislature or the courts to develop one. Cf. Carstens v. Lamm, 543 F. Supp., at 77-78.There remains to be considered Mississippi's at-large election provision, which reads as follows:

"Should an election of representatives in Congress occurafter the number of representatives to which the state

is entitled shall be changed, in consequence of a newapportionment being made by Congress, and before the
districts shall have been changed to conform to the newapportionment, representatives shall be chosen as follows: In case the number of representatives to which thestate is entitled be increased, then one (1) member shall
be chosen in each district as organized, and the addi-tional member or members shall be chosen by the electors of the state at large; and if the number of repre538US1 Unit: $U36 [10-31-04 19:50:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

sentatives shall be diminished, then the whole numbershall be chosen by the electors of the state at large."

Miss. Code Ann. $ 23-15-1039 (Lexis 2001).
There has been no interpretation of this provision by the
Mississippi courts. We believe it was designed to track 2U. S. C. $$ 2a(c)(2) and (5), and should be deemed operative

when those provisions would be. That is to say, (1) thephrase "and before the districts shall have been changed to
conform to the new apportionment" envisions both legisla-tively and judicially prescribed change, and (2) the statute
does not come into play as long as it remains feasible for astate or federal court to complete redistricting. In these
cases, the District Court properly completed the redis-tricting of Mississippi pursuant to 2 U. S. C. $ 2c and thus
neither Mississippi Code $ 23-15-1039 nor 2 U. S. C. $ 2a(c)
was applicable. IV

Justice O'Connor's opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part (hereinafter dissent) agrees that the DistrictCourt properly acted to remedy a constitutional violation,

see post, at 300-301, but contends that it should have looked
to $ 2a(c) rather than $ 2c in selecting an appropriate remedy.We think not. We have explained why it

makes sense for

$ 2c to apply until there is no longer any reasonable prospectfor redistricting according to state law--whereupon $ 2a(c)

applies. If, like the dissent, we were to forgo such analysisand simply ask, in the abstract, which of the two provisions
has primacy, we would probably still select $ 2c--the onlyone cast in absolute, rather than conditional, terms. The
dissent gives not the hint of a reason why it believes $ 2a(c)
has primacy. It says that "[t]he text of $ 2a(c) directs federal
courts to order at-large elections `[u]ntil a State is redistricted in the manner provided by the law thereof.' " Post,
at 301. But it is equally true that $ 2c directs federal courts
to redistrict absolutely and without qualification.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
The dissent does contemplate a role for federal courts inredrawing congressional districts, but only "

after a State has
been redistricted" in the first instance. Post, at 300. It isnot entirely clear which entities the dissent considers competent to do this initial redistricting--certainly the legislature,and perhaps also state courts, but only if such "courts are
part of the `manner provided by the law thereof.' " Post, at
300, n. 1. But the dissent also says that "a court shouldenforce $ 2a(c)

before a `State is redistricted in the manner
provided by the law thereof,' and a court should enforce $ 2c
after a State" has been initially redistricted, post, at 300--
which (if one takes the words at face value) leaves no room
for any court to do the initial redistricting. We assume the
dissent does not mean precisely what it has said.

The dissent implicitly differentiates between federal and
state courts--effectively holding that state courts may undertake the initial redistricting that would satisfy $ 2a(c)'s
prerequisite, but federal courts may not. It presumably
rests this distinction upon the belief that state courts are
capable of redistricting " `in the manner provided by the law
thereof,' " whereas federal courts are not. See post, at 300,
n. 1. To read that phrase as potentially including state--
but not federal--courts, the dissent takes the word "manner"
to refer to process or procedures, rather than substantive
requirements. See ibid. (If the State's process for redistricting includes courts, then and only then may courts redistrict, rendering $ 2a(c) inapplicable.) But such a reading
renders the phrase "in the manner provided by the law
thereof " redundant of the requirement that the State be "redistricted." Of course the State has not been redistricted if
districts have been drawn by someone without authority to
redistrict. Should an ambitious county clerk or individual
legislator sit down and draw up a districting map, no one
would think that the State has, within the meaning of the
statute, been "redistricted." In our view, the word "manner" refers to the State's substantive "policies and prefer538US1 Unit: $U36 [10-31-04 19:50:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ences" for redistricting, White v. Weiser, 412 U. S., at 795, as
expressed in a State's statutes, constitution, proposed reapportionment plans, see ibid., or a State's "traditional districting principles," Abrams v. Johnson, 521 U. S. 74, 86
(1997); see also Upham v. Seamon, 456 U. S. 37, 42-43 (1982)
(per curiam). Thus, when a federal court redistricts a
State in a manner that complies with that State's substantive
districting principles, it does so " `in the manner provided by
the law thereof.' " See supra, at 274-275.* While it certainly remains preferable for the State's legislature to complete its constitutionally required redistricting pursuant to
the requirements of $ 2c, see Abrams, supra, at 101, or for
the state courts to do so if they can, see Growe, 507 U. S., at
34, we have long since crossed the Rubicon that seems to
impede the dissent, see, e. g., Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186
(1962). When the State, through its legislature or other authorized body, cannot produce the needed decision, then federal courts are "left to embark on [the] delicate task" of redistricting, Abrams, supra, at 101.

The dissent claims that we have read the statutory phrase
"[u]ntil a State is redistricted" to mean "[u]ntil . . . the election is so imminent that no entity competent to complete
redistricting pursuant . . . to the mandate of $ 2c . . . is able to
do so without disrupting the election process." Post, at 298.
From that premise, it proceeds to mount a vigorous (and, in
the principles it espouses, highly edifying) "plain meaning"
attack upon our holding. Unfortunately, the premise is patently false. We, no less than the dissent, acknowledge that

*Contrary to the dissent's assertion, post, at 300, n. 1, our reading creates no conflict with Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman,
465 U. S. 89 (1984). Here a federal court granted relief on the basis of
federal law--specifically, the Federal Constitution. The District Court
did not "instruc[t] state officials on how to conform their conduct to state
law," id., at 106; rather, it deferred to the State's "policies and preferences"
for redistricting, White v. Weiser, 412 U. S. 783, 795 (1973). Far from
intruding on state sovereignty, such deference respects it.

"the text tells us `how long' $ 2a(c) should govern: `until aState is redistricted in the manner provided by the law

thereof,' " post, at 299. The issue is not how long $ 2a(c) gov-erns, but how long a court (under the continuing mandate of

$ 2a(c)) should wait before ordering an at-large election.The dissent treats $ 2a(c) as though it prescribes (in its application to the facts of the present case) the immediate establishment of statewide districts (i. e., an at-large election) forall Representatives. It prescribes no such thing. All it

says is that "[u]ntil [the] State is redistricted in the mannerprovided by the law thereof," Representatives "shall be
elected from the State at large." The only point at which

$ 2a(c) issues a command--the only point at which it bites--
is at election time. Only if, at election time, redistricting
"in the manner provided by [state] law" has not occurred,
does $ 2a(c) become operative.

So despite the dissent's ardent protestations to the contrary, see ibid., the dissent, no less than we, must confront
the question "[h]ow long is a court to await that redistricting
before determining that $ 2a(c) governs a forthcoming election?" Surely the dissent cannot possibly believe that, since
"the text tells us `how long' $ 2a(c) should govern," ibid., a
court can declare, immediately after congressional reapportionment, and before the state legislature has even had a
chance to act, that the State's next elections for Representatives will be at large. We say that the state legislature (and
the state and federal courts) should be given the full time
available--right up until the time when further delay will
disrupt the election process--to reapportion according to
state law. Since the dissent disagrees with that, we wonder
what its own timeline might be. But to claim that there
is no timeline--simply to assert that "[$ ]2a(c) contains no
imminence requirement," ibid.--is absurd.

The dissent suggests that our reading of $ 2c runs afoul of
the Court's anticommandeering jurisprudence, see post, at
301-302, but in doing so the dissent fails to recognize that

280 BRANCH v. SMITH

Opinion of Scalia, J.
the state legislature's obligation to prescribe the "Times,Places and Manner" of holding congressional elections is

grounded in Article I, $ 4, cl. 1, of the Constitution itself andnot any mere statutory requirement. Here, as acknowledged by the dissent, the federal plaintiffs "alleged a consti-tutional violation"--failure to provide for the election of the
proper number of Representatives in accordance with Article I, $ 2, cl. 1--"and the federal court drew a plan to remedythat violation,"

post, at 301. In crafting its remedy, the District Court appropriately followed the "Regulations" Con-gress prescribed in $ 2c--"Regulations" that Article I, $ 4,

cl. 1, of the Constitution expressly permits Congress to
make, see supra, at 266. To be sure, $ 2c "envisions legislative action," supra, at 272, but in the context of Article I,

$ 4, cl. 1, such "Regulations" are expressly allowed. In
enacting $ 2c (and $ 2a(c), for that matter), Congress was not
placing a statutory obligation on the state legislatures as it
was in New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144 (1992);
rather, it was regulating (as the Constitution specifically permits) the manner in which a State is to fulfill its pre-existing
constitutional obligations under Article I, $$ 2 and 4. Our
interpretation of $ 2c no more permits a commandeering of
the machinery of state government than does the dissent's
understanding of $ 2a(c). Under our view, if the State fails
to redistrict, then federal courts may do so. Under the dissent's view, if the State fails to redistrict (and loses congressional seats), then the federal courts must order at-large
elections pursuant to $ 2a(c)(5). See, e. g., post, at 299-300.
If our reading of $ 2c runs afoul of any anticommandeering
principles, then the dissent commits the same sin.

Another straw man erected by the dissent is to be found
in its insistence--as though in response to an argument of
ours--that "[s]ince $ 2a(c) was enacted decades before the
Baker line of cases, this subsequent development cannot
change the interpretation of $ 2a(c)." Post, at 307. But we
have never said that those cases changed the meaning of

Opinion of Scalia, J.

$ 2a(c); we have said that they help to explain the meaningof $ 2c, which

was enacted after they were decided. And it
is, of course, the most rudimentary rule of statutory con-struction (which one would have thought familiar to dissenters so prone to preachment on that subject, see, e. g., post, at298, 304, 307) that courts do not interpret statutes in isolation, but in the context of the corpus juris of which they are
a part, including later-enacted statutes:

"The correct rule of interpretation is, that if divers stat-utes relate to the same thing, they ought all to be taken

into consideration in construing any one of them . . . .If a thing contained in a subsequent statute, be within
the reason of a former statute, it shall be taken to be
within the meaning of that statute . . . ; and if it can begathered from a subsequent statute

in pari materia,
what meaning the legislature attached to the words of aformer statute, they will amount to a legislative declaration of its meaning, and will govern the construction ofthe first statute."

United States v. Freeman, 3 How.
556, 564-565 (1845).

That is to say, the meaning of $ 2c (illuminated by the Baker
v. Carr line of cases) sheds light upon the meaning of $ 2a(c).Finally, the dissent gives the statutory phrase "redistricted in the manner provided by the law thereof " a mean-ing that is highly unusual. It means, according to the dissent, "redistricted as state law requires," even when state
law is unconstitutional--so that even an unconstitutional
redistricting satisfies the "until" clause of $ 2a(c), and enables$ 2c to be applied. We know of no other instance in which a

federal statute acknowledges to be "state law" a provision
that violates the Supremacy Clause and is therefore a legal
nullity. It is particularly peculiar for the dissent to allow
an unconstitutional redistricting to satisfy the "until" clause
when it will not allow a nonprecleared redistricting to satisfy the "until" clause (in those States subject to $ 5 of the

not "redistricted" within the meaning of $ 2a(c) if the dis-tricts have not been precleared, but it is "redistricted" even
if the districts are patently unconstitutional (so long as theyhave been precleared, or the State is not subject to the preclearance requirement). Section 2a(c), of course, has no"preclearance exception." If redistricting "in the manner
provided by [state] law" is ineffective when a federal statute($ 5 preclearance) has been disregarded, surely it is also ineffective when the Federal Constitution has been disregarded.It is not we but the dissent that reads into the text of $ 2a(c)
("redistricted in the manner provided by [state] law") dis-tinctions that have no basis in reality.

The rule prescribed by Connor reflects the purposes behind the Voting Rights Act. Concerned that "covered jurisdictions would exercise their ingenuity to devise new and
subtle forms of discrimination, Congress prohibited those jurisdictions from implementing any change in voting procedure without obtaining preclearance under $ 5." Hathorn v.
Lovorn, 457 U. S. 255, 268 (1982). A jurisdiction covered by

$ 5 must seek approval of either the Attorney General of the
United States or the United States District Court for the
District of Columbia. See, e. g., Clark v. Roemer, 500 U. S.
646, 652 (1991); Lopez v. Monterey County, 519 U. S. 9, 12
(1996). Absent preclearance, a voting change is neither effective nor enforceable as a matter of federal law. Connor

this way anticipate a ruling not yet made by the Executive.
The proposed changes are not capable of implementation,
and the constitutional objections may be resolved through
the preclearance process.

The constitutional challenge presented to the District
Court here fell within the ambit of the Connor rule. Our
previous cases addressed contentions that the state reapportionment plan violated the one-person, one-vote principle or
diluted minority voting strength. Connor v. Waller, 396
F. Supp. 1308, 1309 (SD Miss. 1975), rev'd, 421 U. S. 656 (1975)
(per curiam); Board of Supervisors, supra, at 643-644;
Wise, supra, at 538-539. In this litigation, appellees objected to the constitutionality of the state court's assumption
of authority to devise a redistricting plan. The fact that appellees framed their constitutional argument to the state
court's authority to pass a redistricting plan rather than to
the plan's components does not make their claim reviewable.
The plan was not yet precleared and so could not cause appellees injury through enforcement or implementation.

In deciding to address the constitutional challenge the District Court was motivated by the commendable purpose of
enabling this Court to examine all the issues presented by
the litigation in one appeal. This approach, however, forces
the federal courts to undertake unnecessary review of complex constitutional issues in advance of an Executive determination and so risks frustrating the mechanism established
by the Voting Rights Act. In these cases, for instance, the
District Court's decision led to a delay in preclearance because the United States Attorney General (whether or not
authorized to do so by the statute) refused to consider the
state-court plan while the constitutional injunction remained
in place. App. 28-29. The advance determination, moreover, can risk at least the perception that the Executive is
revising the judgment of an Article III court. Adherence to
the rule of Connor provides States covered by $ 5 with time

to remedy constitutional defects without the involvement offederal courts. Given the statutory command of direct review to this Court, it also helps to ensure that only constitu-tional issues necessary to the resolution of the electoral dispute are brought to us.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter and
Justice Breyer join, concurring in part and concurring inthe judgment.

In 1967 Congress enacted a brief statutory provision thatbanned at-large elections for Representatives. In my opinion the portion of that statute that is codified at 2 U. S. C.$ 2c impliedly repealed $ 2a(c). The reasons that support
that conclusion also persuade me that the 1967 federal Actpre-empted Mississippi's statutory authorization of at-large
election of Representatives in Congress. Accordingly, whileI join Parts I, II, and III-A of the Court's opinion, I do not
join Parts III-B or IV.The question whether an Act of Congress has repealed an
earlier federal statute is similar to the question whether it
has pre-empted a state statute. When Congress clearly ex-presses its intent to repeal or to pre-empt, we must respect

that expression. When it fails to do so expressly, the pre-sumption against implied repeals, like the presumption
against pre-emption, can be overcome in two situations: (1) ifthere is an irreconcilable conflict between the provisions in
the two Acts; or (2) if the later Act was clearly intended to"cove[r] the whole subject of the earlier one."

Posadas v.
National City Bank, 296 U. S. 497, 503 (1936).1

1 Compare Posadas, 296 U. S., at 503 ("There are two well-settled categories of repeals by implication--(1) where provisions in the two acts are
in irreconcilable conflict, the later act to the extent of the conflict constitutes an implied repeal of the earlier one; and (2) if the later act covers
the whole subject of the earlier one and is clearly intended as a substitute,
it will operate similarly as a repeal of the earlier act"), with Freightliner

As I read the 1967 statute it entirely prohibits States thathave more than one congressional district from adopting

either a multimember district or electing their Representa-tives in at-large elections, with one narrow exception that
applied to the 1968 election in two States. After a ratherlong and contentious legislative process, Congress enacted
this brief provision:

"AN ACT"For the relief of Doctor Ricardo Vallejo Samala and

to provide for congressional redistricting."

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Con-gress assembled, That, for the purposes of the Immigration and Nationality Act, Doctor Ricardo Vallejo Samalashall be held and considered to have been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence asof August 30, 1959.

with federal law").

tives at Large to the Ninety-first Congress)." Pub. L.90-196, 81 Stat. 581 (emphasis added).

The second paragraph of this statute enacts a general ruleprohibiting States with more than one congressional Representative from electing their Representatives to Congress inat-large elections.

2 That the single exception to this congressional command applied only to Hawaii and New Mexico,and only to the 1968 election, emphasizes the fact that the

Act applies to every other State and every other election.Thus, it unambiguously forbids elections that would otherwise have been authorized by $ 2a(c)(5). It both creates an"irreconcilable conflict" with the 1941 law and it "covers the
whole subject" of at-large congressional elections. Posadas,296 U. S., at 503. Under either of the accepted standards
for identifying implied repeals, it repealed the earlier federalstatute. In addition, this statute pre-empts the Mississippi
statute setting the default rule as at-large elections.The first paragraph of the 1967 statute suggests an answer
to the question why Congress failed to enact an express re-peal of the 1941 law when its intent seems so obvious. The
statute that became law in December 1967 was the final gaspin a protracted legislative process that began on January 17,
1967, when Chairman Celler of the House Judiciary Commit-tee introduced H. R. 2508, renewing efforts made in the preceding Congress to provide legislative standards responsiveto this Court's holding in Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U. S. 1
(1964), that the one-person, one-vote principle applies to con-gressional elections.

3 The bill introduced by Representative Celler in 1967 contained express language replacing

2 The States of Hawaii and New Mexico were the only two States that
met the statutory exception because they were "entitled to more than one
Representative" and had "in all previous elections elected [their] Representatives at Large." Pub. L. 90-196, 81 Stat. 581.

3 In 1965, the House of Representatives passed a bill identical, in all

relevant respects, to the bill Representative Celler introduced in January
1967. See H. R. 5505, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. (1965).

$ 2a(c) in its entirety.4 H. R. 2508, as introduced, had three
principal components that are relevant to the implied repeal
analysis. First, the bill required single-member district
elections: "[T]here shall be established by law a number of
districts equal to the number of Representatives to which
such State is so entitled; and Representatives shall be
elected only from districts so established, no district to elect
more than one Representative." H. R. 2508, 90th Cong., 1st
Sess., 2 (1967). Second, the bill limited gerrymandering, requiring each district to "at all times be composed of contiguous territory, in as compact form as practicable." Ibid.
Third, the bill required proportional representation: "[N]o
district established in any State for the Ninetieth or any subsequent Congress shall contain a number of persons, excluding Indians not taxed, more than 15 per centum greater or
less than the average obtained" by dividing the population
by the number of Representatives. Ibid.

This bill generated great controversy and discussion. Importantly for present purposes, however, only two of the
three components were discussed in depth at all. At no
point, either in any of the numerous Conference Reports or
lengthy floor debates, does any disagreement regarding the
language expressly repealing $ 2a(c) or the single-member
district requirement appear. Rather, the debate was confined to the gerrymandering requirement, the proportionality rule, and the scope and duration of the temporary exceptions to the broad prohibition against at-large elections.

4 Specifically, $ 2a(c) would have been expressly repealed by the following language, present in all but the final version of H. R. 2508: "That
section 22 of the Act of June 18, 1929, entitled `An Act to provide for the
fifteenth and subsequent decennial censuses and to provide for apportionment of Representatives' (46 Stat. 26), as amended, is amended as follows:

"Subsection (c) is amended by striking out all of the language in that

The House Judiciary Committee amended the bill, limiting
the proportional differences between districts in all States
to not exceed 10 percent and creating an exception to the
general rule for the 91st and 92d Congresses (1968 and 1970
elections) that allowed for "the States of Hawaii and New
Mexico [to] continue to elect their Representatives at large"
and for the proportional differences to be as large as 30 percent. H. R. Rep. No. 191, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 1-2 (1967).
The House then passed this amended bill. The Senate Judiciary Committee then amended this bill, striking Hawaii
from the exception and allowing for 35 percent, rather than
30 percent, variation between districts during the 91st and
92d Congresses. S. Rep. No. 291, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 1
(1967). The bill went to conference twice, and the conference recommended two sets of amendments. The first Conference Report, issued June 27, 1967, recommended striking
any exception to the general rule and limiting proportional
variation to 10 percent or less. See H. R. Conf. Rep.
No. 435, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 1-2 (1965). After this compromise failed to pass either the House or the Senate, the
conference then recommended a measure that was very similar to the second paragraph of the private bill eventually
passed--a general rule requiring single-member districts
with an exception, of unlimited duration, for Hawaii and New
Mexico. H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 795, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 1
(1965). Importantly, every version of the bill discussed in
the House Report, the Senate Report, and both Conference
Reports contained a provision expressly repealing $ 2a(c).
In spite of these several modifications, the bill, as recommended by the last conference, failed to pass either chamber.

The decision to attach what is now $ 2c to the private bill
reflected this deadlock. Indeed, proponents of this attachment remarked that they sought to take the uncontroversial
components of the prior legislation to ensure that Congress
would pass some legislation in response to Wesberry v. Sand538US1 Unit: $U36 [10-31-04 19:50:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ers, 376 U. S. 1 (1964).5 The absence of any discussion, de-bate, or reference to the provision expressly repealing $ 2a(c)

in the private bill prevents its omission from the final billas being seen as a deliberate choice by Congress. Any fair
reading of the history leading up to the passage of this billdemonstrates that all parties involved were operating under
the belief that the changes they were debating would com-pletely replace $ 2a(c).

Justice O'Connor has provided us with a convincing ex-position of the flaws in

Justice Scalia's textual interpreta-tion of $ 2a(c)(5). See post, at 298-301 (opinion concurring

in part and dissenting in part). Ironically, however, she hasbeen misled by undue reliance on the text of statutes enacted
in 1882, 1891, 1901, and 1911--a period in our history longbefore the 1950's and 1960's when Congress enacted the voting rights legislation that recognized the central importanceof protecting minority access to the polls. It was only then

5 Senator Bayh introduced one amendment to the private bill that excluded Hawaii and New Mexico while Senator Baker offered another that
had no exceptions. Senator Bayh characterized his amendment as follows: "What I have tried to do is to take that part of the conference report
over which there was no dispute, or a minimal amount of dispute, and
attach that part to the bill which is now the pending business." 113 Cong.
Rec. 31719 (1967). Senator Baker described his amendment as follows:
"The measure makes no other provision. It has nothing to do with gerrymandering. It has nothing to do with compactness. It has nothing to do
with census. It strictly provides in a straightforward manner that when
there is more than one Member of the House of Representatives from a
State, the State must be districted, and that the Members may not run at
large. . . . I believe that my amendment is the most straightforward and
direct and simple way to get at the most urgent need in the entire field of
redistricting, and that is to prevent the several States of the Union from
being under the threat of having their Representatives to the U. S. House
of Representatives stand for election at large." Id., at 31718.

In a colloquy between Senators Bayh and Baker on the floor, they both
agreed that the final amendment left no doubt as to its effect: "This will
make it mandatory for all Congressmen to be elected by single-Member
districts, whether the reapportionment is done by State legislatures or by
a Federal court." Id., at 31720 (remarks of Sen. Bayh).

Opinion of Stevens, J.
that an important federal interest in prohibiting at-large vot-ing, particularly in States like Mississippi, became a matter

of congressional concern. This intervening and dramatichistorical change significantly lessens the relevance of these
earlier statutes to the present analysis.Moreover, her analysis of the implied repeal issue apparently assumes that if two provisions could coexist in the
same statute, one could not impliedly repeal the other if theywere enacted in successive statutes. Thus, she makes no

comment on the proviso in the 1967 statute that preservedat-large elections in New Mexico and Hawaii for 1968. This
proviso surely supports the conclusion that it was the only
exception intended by Congress from the otherwise total
prohibition of at-large elections. The authorization of atlarge elections in the 1882 statute cited by Justice O'Connor was also set forth in a proviso; although the words
"provided that" are omitted from the 1891, 1901, and
1911 statutes, they just contain examples of differently
worded exceptions from a general rule. It is also important
to note that the text of the 1967 statute, unlike the four earlier statutes, uses the word "only" to create a categorical
prohibition against at-large elections. As a matter of plain
English, the conflict between that prohibition and $ 2a(c),
which permitted at-large elections, is surely irreconcilable.

Justice O'Connor's consideration of the legislative history of the 1967 statute fails to give appropriate consideration to the four bills that would have expressly repealed

$ 2a(c)(5). See supra, at 287-289. Those bills, coupled with
the absence of any expression by anyone involved in the protracted legislative process of an intent to preserve at-large
elections anywhere except in New Mexico and Hawaii, provide powerful support for the conclusion that, as a literal
reading of the text of $ 2c plainly states, Congress intended
to enact a categorical prohibition of at-large elections. The
odd circumstance that the final version of the prohibition was
added to a private bill makes it quite clear that the omission

of a clause expressly repealing $ 2a(c) was simply an inadver-tence. Canons of statutory construction--such as the presumption against implied repeals or the presumption againstpre-emption--are often less reliable guides in the search for
congressional intent than a page or two of history.

* * *
The history of the 1967 statute, coupled with the plain lan-guage of its text, leads to only one conclusion--Congress impliedly repealed $ 2a(c). It is far wiser to give effect to themanifest intent of Congress than, as the plurality attempts,
to engage in tortured judicial legislation to preserve a rem-nant of an obsolete federal statute and an equally obsolete
state statute. Accordingly, while I concur in the Court'sjudgment and opinion, I do not join Parts III-B or IV of the
plurality opinion.

Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Thomas joins,concurring in part and dissenting in part.

I join Parts I and II of the Court's opinion because I agreethat the Mississippi Chancery Court's redistricting plan lacks
preclearance. I join Part II-C because it is consistent withour decisions holding that federal courts should not rule on
a constitutional challenge to a nonprecleared voting changewhen the change is not yet capable of implementation. See,
e. g., Connor v. Waller, 421 U. S. 656 (1975) (per curiam); seealso

ante, p. 282 (Kennedy, J., concurring). I cannot joinPart III or Part IV, however, because I disagree with the

Court that 2 U. S. C. $ 2c is a command to the States and Idisagree with the plurality regarding the proper statutory
construction of $ 2a(c)(5). I

First, I agree with the plurality's somewhat reluctant con-clusion that $ 2c does not impliedly repeal $ 2a(c)(5). Here,
it is quite easy to read $$ 2c and 2a(c) together. A naturalstatutory reading of $ 2a(c) gives force to both $$ 2c and 2a(c):

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Section 2a(c) applies "[u]ntil a State is redistricted in themanner provided by the law thereof." Section 2c applies

after a State has "redistricted in the manner provided by thelaw thereof."

As both the plurality and Justice Stevens recognize, animplied repeal can exist only if the "provisions in the two
acts are in irreconcilable conflict" or if "the later act covers
the whole subject of the earlier one and is clearly intendedas a substitute."

Posadas v. National City Bank, 296 U. S.
497, 503 (1936). See also ante, at 273 (plurality opinion);
ante, at 285 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring
in judgment). Indeed, " `when two statutes are capable of
co-existence, it is the duty of the courts . . . to regard each
as effective.' " Radzanower v. Touche Ross & Co., 426 U. S.
148, 155 (1976) (quoting Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535,
551 (1974)). We have not found any implied repeal of a statute since 1975. See Gordon v. New York Stock Exchange,
Inc., 422 U. S. 659. And outside the antitrust context, we
appear not to have found an implied repeal of a statute since
1917. See Lewis v. United States, 244 U. S. 134. Because
it is not difficult to read $$ 2a(c) and 2c in a manner that
gives force to both statutes, $ 2c cannot impliedly repeal

$ 2a(c). See, e. g., United States v. Burroughs, 289 U. S. 159,
164 (1933) ("[I]f effect can reasonably be given to both statutes, the presumption is that the earlier is intended to remain in force"); Radzanower v. Touche Ross & Co., supra, at
155 ("Repeal is to be regarded as implied only if necessary
to make the [later enacted law] work, and even then only to
the minimum extent necessary. This is the guiding principle to reconciliation of the two statutory schemes" (alteration
in original and internal quotation marks omitted)).

The previous versions of $$ 2c and 2a(c) confirm that an
implied repeal does not exist here. Since 1882, versions of

$$ 2c and 2a(c) have coexisted. Indeed, the 1882, 1891, 1901,
and 1911 apportionment statutes all contained the singlemember district requirement as well as the at-large default

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Justice Stevens attempts to distinguish the prior versions of $ 2a(c) because they contained slightly different language from the present version of $ 2a(c). See ante, at 291.
Even assuming, however, that the 1882 version of $ 2a(c) is
slightly different from the present version, the versions of

$ 2a(c) in effect in 1891, 1901, and 1911 are materially indistinguishable from the present version. Indeed, the 1911
statute--the one in effect at the time Congress enacted the
present version of $ 2a(c)--is almost word for word the same
as the current statute. Compare Act of Aug. 8, 1911, ch. 5,

$ 4, 37 Stat. 14 ("until such State shall be redistricted in the
manner provided by the laws thereof "), with 2 U. S. C. $ 2a(c)
("[u]ntil a State is redistricted in the manner provided by the
law therof "). See also Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355, 374
(1932) (noting that the 1911 version of $ 2a(c) would apply
"unless and until new districts are created").

Given this history of the two provisions coexisting in
the same statute, I would not hold that $ 2c impliedly repeals $ 2a(c). The two statutes are "capable of co-existence"
because each covers a different subject matter. Morton
v. Mancari, supra, at 551. Section 2c was not intended

to cover the whole subject of $ 2a(c) and was not "clearly

intended as a substitute" for $ 2a(c). Posadas v. National
City Bank, supra, at 503. Section 2a(c) (requiring at-large
elections) applies unless or until the State redistricts, and

$ 2c (requiring single-member districts) applies once the
State has completed the redistricting process.

This Court has in fact read the prior versions of $$ 2c and
2a(c) so that the two did not conflict. In Smiley v. Holm,
supra, we recognized that under the 1911 version of these
provisions, at-large elections were an appropriate remedy if
the State was not properly redistricted in the first instance.
See id., at 374 ("[U]nless and until new districts are created,
all representatives allotted to the State must be elected by
the State at large").

296 BRANCH v. SMITH

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
When the 1911 statute expired in 1929, Congress did not
reenact it. Instead, Congress passed $ 2a(c), which took effect in 1941. Because $ 2a(c) concerned only at-large elections, no complementary single-member district requirement
existed from 1941 until 1967. In 1967, Congress enacted

$ 2c, which states in relevant part: "[T]here shall be established by law a number of districts equal to the number of
Representatives to which such State is so entitled, and Representatives shall be elected only from districts so established, no district to elect more than one Representative
. . . ." The relevant language of this statute tracks the language of the prior versions of $ 2c. Justice Stevens' only
distinction between the prior versions of $ 2c and this version of $ 2c is that Congress added the word "only" to the
latest version of $ 2c. See ante, at 288. But this one word
is a thin reed on which to rest an implied repeal. Justice
Stevens would hold that instead of expressly repealing

$ 2a(c), Congress added the word "only" to $ 2c. This oneword addition that does not change the meaning of the statute is no basis for finding an implied repeal.

Justice Stevens argues that Congress intended to
" `cove[r] the whole subject' " of at-large redistricting when
it enacted $ 2c in 1967. Ante, at 287 (quoting Posadas v.
National City Bank, 296 U. S., at 503). But the 1967 enactment of $ 2c simply restored the prior balance between the
at-large mandate and the single-member district mandate
that had existed since 1882. To hold that an implied repeal
exists, one would have to conclude that Congress repeatedly
enacted two completely conflicting provisions in the same
statute. The better reading is to give each provision a separate sphere of influence, with $ 2a(c) applying until a "State
is redistricted in the manner provided by the law thereof,"
and $ 2c applying after the State is redistricted. Because
the 1967 version of $ 2c parallels the prior versions of $ 2c,
and because of the longstanding coexistence between the
prior versions of $$ 2a(c) and 2c, Justice Stevens' argu538US1 Unit: $U36 [10-31-04 19:50:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
ment that Congress " `clearly intended' " $ 2c " `as a substi-tute' " for $ 2a(c) is untenable.

Ante, at 285, n. 1; Posadas
v. National City Bank, supra, at 503. Cf. Regional Rail
Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U. S. 102, 134 (1974) (" `Presumably Congress had given serious thought to the earlierstatute . . . . Before holding that the result of the earlier

consideration has been repealed or qualified, it is reasonable
for a court to insist on the legislature's using language show-ing that it has made a considered determination to that

end' ").

Justice Stevens' strongest argument is that the legislative history indicates that "all parties involved were operat-ing under the belief that the changes they were debating

would completely replace $ 2a(c)." Ante, at 290. Yet Justice Stevens acknowledges that Congress could have expressly repealed $ 2a(c). See ante, at 287-288, 291-292.
Justice Stevens thinks the evidence that Congress tried
to expressly repeal $ 2a(c) four times cuts strongly in favorof an implied repeal here. See

ante, at 292. But these four
attempts to repeal $ 2a(c) were unsuccessful. It is difficult
to conclude that Congress can impliedly repeal a statutewhen it deliberately chose not to expressly repeal that statute. In this case, where the two provisions have co-existed
historically, and where Congress explicitly rejected an express repeal of $ 2a(c), I would not find an implied repeal
of $ 2a(c).

I would hold instead that Congress passed $ 2c in 1967 to
restore redistricting law to its pre-1941 status, when $ 2a(c)
became effective without any complementary provision regarding single-member districts. The floor statements and
colloquy by Senators Baker and Bayh cited by Justice Stevens, see ante, at 290, n. 5, cannot overcome the strong presumption against implied repeals, especially given the historical evidence that $$ 2c and 2a(c) had peacefully coexisted
since the 19th century. And as explained in more detail in
Part II-B, infra, the circumstances leading up to the passage
of $ 2c in 1967 do not support a finding of implied repeal.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
In short, because $$ 2a(c)(5) and 2c are capable of co-existence, and because the history shows that $ 2c does not

cover the whole subject of $ 2a(c), I agree with the pluralitythat $ 2c does not impliedly repeal $ 2a(c), and therefore that

$ 2a(c) "continues to apply." Ante, at 273.

II

A

Although the plurality acknowledges that $ 2a(c) remainsin full force, it inexplicably adopts a reading of $ 2a(c) that

has no textual basis. Under $ 2a(c)(5), the State must con-duct at-large elections "[u]ntil a State is redistricted in the
manner provided by the law thereof." Instead of simplyreading the plain text of the statute, however, the plurality
invents its own version of the text of $ 2a(c). The pluralityholds that "[u]ntil a State is redistricted . . ." means "[u]ntil
. . . the election is so imminent that no entity competent tocomplete redistricting pursuant to . . . the mandate of $ 2c [ ]
is able to do so without disrupting the election process."
Ante, at 274, 275. But such a reading is not faithful to thetext of the statute. Like

Justice Stevens, I believe thatthe Court's interpretation of $ 2a(c) is nothing more than

"tortured judicial legislation." Ante, at 292. See alsoScalia, The Rule of Law as a Law of Rules, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev.
1175, 1185 (1989) ("[W]hen one does not have a solid textualanchor or an established social norm from which to derive
the general rule, its pronouncement appears uncomfortablylike legislation").

Dictionary definitions confirm what the plain text says:"Until a State is redistricted in the manner provided by the
law thereof " means "[u]ntil a State is redistricted in the man-ner provided by the law thereof." The meaning of the word
"until" is not difficult to understand, nor is it some special-ized term of art. See Webster's New International Dictionary 2794 (2d ed. 1957) (defining "until" to mean "[d]uring thewhole time before"); Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 1297

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
(10th ed. 1993) (defining "until" to mean "up to such timeas" or "[b]efore"). The word "redistricted" also is not hard

to comprehend. Id., at 980 (defining "redistrict" to mean"to divide anew into districts"); Black's Law Dictionary
1283 (7th ed. 1999) (defining "redistrict" to mean "[t]o orga-nize into new districts, esp. legislative ones; reapportion").
While the Court employs dictionary definitions to interpret

$ 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, see ante, at 264, it nota-bly refrains from using any dictionary definition for $ 2a(c).

Section 2a(c) contains no imminence requirement. It isnot credible to say that "until a State is redistricted in the
manner provided by the law thereof after any apportionment" means: "[u]ntil . . . the election is so imminent that no
entity competent to complete redistricting pursuant to . . .
the mandate of $ 2c [ ] is able to do so without disrupting the
election process." Ante, at 275. The plurality characterizes $ 2a(c) as a "stopgap provisio[n]," but the text of $ 2a(c)
is not so limited. Ibid. The plurality asks "[h]ow long is a
court to await that redistricting before determining that

$ 2a(c) governs a forthcoming election?" Ibid. Yet the text
provides no basis for why the plurality would ask such a
question. Indeed, the text tells us "how long" $ 2a(c) should
govern: "[u]ntil a State is redistricted in the manner provided by the law thereof." (Emphasis added.) Under the
plurality's reading, however, $ 2a(c) would not apply even
though $ 2a(c) by its terms should apply, as the State has not
yet "redistricted in the manner provided by the law thereof."
The language of the statute cannot bear such a reading.
Cf. Holloway v. United States, 526 U. S. 1, 14 (1999) (Scalia,
J., dissenting) ("No amount of rationalization can change the
reality of this normal (and as far as I know exclusive) English usage. The word in the statute simply will not bear the
meaning that the Court assigns").

The dispositive question is what the text says it is: Has
a State "redistricted in the manner provided by the law
thereof "? 2 U. S. C. $ 2a(c). "Until a State is redistricted

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
in the manner provided by the law thereof after any appor-tionment," a court cannot draw single-member districts.

Ibid. (emphasis added). The court must apply the terms of$ 2a(c) and order at-large elections. If, however, the State
is redistricted "in the manner provided by the law thereof,"$ 2c applies. Thus, after a State has been redistricted, if a
court determines that the redistricting violates the Constitu-tion or the Voting Rights Act, the correct remedy for such
a violation is the $ 2c procedure of drawing single-memberdistricts that comport with federal statutory law and the
Constitution. But "[u]ntil a State is redistricted in the man-ner provided by the law thereof," $ 2a(c)(5) mandates that a
court order at-large elections. In short, a court should en-force $ 2a(c)

before a "State is redistricted in the manner pro-vided by the law thereof," and a court should enforce $ 2c

after a State has been "redistricted in the manner providedby the law thereof."

The plurality seems to forget that in cases such as thisone, a federal court has the power to redistrict only because
private parties have alleged a violation of the Constitution or
the Voting Rights Act. Sections 2a(c) and 2c do not createindependently enforceable private rights of action themselves. Rather, both these provisions address the remedythat a federal court must order if it finds a violation of a
constitutional or statutory right.1 The federal plaintiffs in

1 It does not matter whether $ 2a(c) applies exclusively to legislative redistricting. Under the terms of $ 2a(c), courts can be involved in the redistricting process. To the extent that courts are part of the "manner
provided by the law thereof," courts may redistrict. 2 U. S. C. $ 2a(c).
And contrary to the plurality's interpretation, the text of $ 2a(c) makes
clear that this "manner" refers exclusively to state law. The manner in
which a State redistricts can only refer to the process by which a State
redistricts. Moreover, the plurality's conflation of state and federal law
is in substantial tension with this Court's opinion in Pennhurst State
School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89 (1984) (delineating a distinction between state and federal law when a federal court enters an
injunction).

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
this litigation alleged a constitutional violation, and the fed-eral court drew a plan to remedy that violation. Having

found a constitutional violation, the federal court was re-quired to fashion the appropriate remedy of $ 2c or $ 2a(c)
depending on whether the "State is redistricted in the man-ner provided by the law thereof." 2 U. S. C. $ 2a(c).

The plurality's reading of $ 2a(c) also fails on its own terms.
As the plurality appears to acknowledge, ante, at 277, theplain text of $ 2a(c) requires courts to apply $ 2a(c) before

applying $ 2c. Yet the plurality never justifies why, when itis interpreting $ 2a(c), it looks to $ 2c instead of reading the
plain language of $ 2a(c) itself. If state law really includes
federal law, as the Court maintains, both $$ 2c and 2a(c) are
equally applicable. The text of $ 2a(c) directs federal courts
to order at-large elections "[u]ntil a State is redistricted
in the manner provided by the law thereof." In deciding
whether $ 2c or $ 2a(c) is applicable, it is no answer to escape
the directive of $ 2a(c) by pointing to the text of $ 2c. Indeed, if one takes at face value the plurality's statement that

$ 2a(c) "continues to apply," ante, at 273, a court should not
look at $ 2c until the State complies with the terms of $ 2a(c).
Section 2a(c) is antecedent to $ 2c, since $ 2a(c) defines when
at-large elections are appropriate.

Moreover, the Court's interpretation of the interplay between $$ 2a(c) and 2c calls into question this Court's anticommandeering jurisprudence. See, e. g., New York v.
United States, 505 U. S. 144, 166 (1992) ("We have always
understood that even where Congress has the authority
under the Constitution to pass laws requiring or prohibiting
certain acts, it lacks the power directly to compel the States
to require or prohibit those acts"); and Printz v. United
States, 521 U. S. 898, 912 (1997) (Scalia, J.) ("[S]tate legislatures are not subject to federal direction"). The plurality
states that the anticommandeering jurisprudence is inapplicable to Article I, $ 4, because that section gives Congress
the power to "Regulat[e]" the times, places, and manner of

302 BRANCH v. SMITH

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
holding congressional elections. But of course, Article I, $ 8,
uses similar language when it authorizes Congress to "regulate Commerce . . . among the several States." Whether the
anticommandeering principle of New York and Printz is as
robust in the Article I, $ 4, context (the font of congressional
authority here) as it is in the Article I, $ 8, context (the
source of congressional authority in those cases) is a question
that need not be definitively resolved here. In any event,
the canon of constitutional avoidance counsels strongly
against the reading of $$ 2c and 2a(c) adopted in Parts III
and IV of the principal opinion. The Court's reading of $ 2c,
see ante, at 271-272--also adopted by Justice Stevens--
invites a future facial attack to the constitutional validity
of $ 2c.2

The history of the prior versions of $ 2c shows that $ 2c
has never been treated as an absolute command. States
routinely used at-large elections under the previous iterations of $ 2c, even though those versions of $ 2c also stated
that Representatives "shall be elected by districts." Act of
June 25, 1842, ch. 47, $ 2, 5 Stat. 491; Act of July 14, 1862,
ch. 170, 12 Stat. 572; Act of Feb. 2, 1872, 17 Stat. 28; cf. supra,
at 293-294 (documenting the 1882, 1891, 1901, and 1911 versions of $ 2c). See also K. Martis, Historical Atlas of United

2 It is just as coercive for Congress to say that if the State does not
comply with a legislative command, a federal court will enter an injunction
making the State conform with Congress' command. See, e. g., New York
v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 174-177 (1992) (striking down Congress'
"take title" provision because the choice between two unconstitutional
choices is "no choice at all"). If $ 2c is not a command, however, a State
has the choice between passing redistricting legislation or using at-large
elections. Section 2c merely limits the type of remedies that a federal
court may adopt in response to a pre-existing violation of federal law.
Neither it nor $ 2a(c) affirmatively provides courts the authority to draw
districts absent a violation. Rather, $ 2a(c) specifies which remedy is appropriate for the constitutional violation. See 2 U. S. C. $ 2a(c) (a court
must order at-large elections "[u]ntil a State is redistricted in the manner
provided by the law thereof").

States Congressional Districts 1789-1983, pp. 4, 6 (1982)(hereinafter Martis) (documenting 36 States that used atlarge elections from the 28th Congress--after Congresspassed the first version of $ 2c in 1842--through the 70th

State used some form of at-large representation.Unless the Court is willing to say that these States openly
flouted federal law, the only way to read this history is toacknowledge that $ 2c is not a statutory command. But see

type of redistricting legislation they are allowed to pass (allothers being prohibited). This reading also comports with
the pre-1842 history of congressional elections. Before Con-gress passed its first version of $ 2c in 1842, States routinely
would elect more than one individual from a specific district.See Martis 4-5 (listing five States--Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania--that usedmultimember districts from the 3d Congress in 1793 through

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
went into effect, however, States could no longer use multi-member districts. Rather, States could either redistrict

using single-member districts or use at-large elections. Inshort, $ 2c does not tell States that they must pass redistricting legislation. Section 2c is instead a restriction on thetype of legislation that a State may pass--a restriction completely consistent with New York and Printz. And $ 2a(c)provides that at-large elections will be the default mechanism if States choose not to pass redistricting legislation.An interpretation of $ 2a(c) which mandates that courts
order at-large elections "[u]ntil a State is redistricted in themanner provided by the law thereof " does not mean that
once a redistricting plan is in effect, $ 2a(c) applies if a courtlater deems the apportionment plan invalid. The words of

$ 2a(c) specifically refer to the process in which the Stateredistricts: "in the manner provided by the law thereof."
Section 2a(c) is no longer implicated after the State finishesits process of redistricting "in the manner provided by the
law thereof after any apportionment." When all requiredaction by the State is complete, and when the state plan first
becomes effective, the "State is redistricted in the mannerprovided by the law thereof." Ibid.

B
Because the plurality's construction of $ 2a(c) has no statu-tory basis, the only way to understand the Court's opinion is

that the Court is overlooking the words of the statute fornontextual prudential reasons. Cf. A. Scalia, A Matter of
Interpretation 18-23 (1997) (discussing the case of Church ofHoly Trinity v. United States, 143 U. S. 457 (1892), and noting that "Congress can enact foolish statutes as well as wiseones, and it is not for the courts to decide which is which and
rewrite the former").The only other prudential reason why the plurality would
distort the plain text of $ 2a(c) is to hold sub silentio that

$ 2c impliedly repeals $ 2a(c). Why else would the pluralitynote the "tension" between the two statutes, ante, at 273,

note that "[t]here is something to be said for [the impliedrepeal] position," ibid., and engage in such a long exegesis
about the historical context surrounding the enactment of$ 2c? See ante, at 268-271 (majority opinion). The plurality adopts the reading of $ 2a(c) proposed by one DistrictCourt in a 1982 decision. See

Carstens v. Lamm, 543F. Supp. 68 (Colo. 1982). As the United States recognizes in

its brief, the reasoning of Carstens is nothing less than apartial implied repeal of $ 2a(c). See Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 29. ("Section 2c's unequivocalmandate that Members of the House of Representatives
should be elected from single-member districts (exceptwhere exigencies of time render that impracticable, see
Carston [sic] v. Lamm, supra) resolves that problem. Itcreates a workable and sensible regime that faithfully fulfills
Congress's purpose when it enacted Section 2c in 1967"); seealso

id., at 10 ("While . . . repeal by implication is disfavored,so is failure to give a later-enacted statute the full scope that

its terms require").Moreover, neither the plurality nor

Justice Stevens can
rely on the historical context of the pre-1967 cases to supporttheir interpretations of $$ 2a(c) and 2c. This history in fact

cuts against them. It is true that before 1967, some districtcourts threatened to impose at-large elections if the state
redistricting plan were ruled unconstitutional. See ante, at269-270 (majority opinion) (citing cases). In all these cases,
however, a legislature had already redistricted "in the man-ner provided by the law thereof." 2 U. S. C. $ 2a(c).

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Thus, Congress' response in enacting $ 2(c) cannot be readto target anything more than situations in which a State had

already "redistricted in the manner provided by the lawthereof." And of course, once a State was redistricted in
this manner, $ 2a(c) by its terms would not apply. If any-thing, the enactment of $ 2c in 1967 clarified that the statutory balance between $$ 2c and 2a(c) that had existed in priorversions of the statute would continue to exist.

The cases cited by the Court do not resolve the question ofwhat happens when a State

fails to redistrict "in the mannerprovided by the law thereof." 2 U. S. C. $ 2a(c). The Court

itself describes these pre-1967 cases as decisions where thecourts "are remedying a failure to redistrict constitutionally." Ante, at 270. I agree with the Court that when acourt strikes down a State's apportionment plan, $ 2c mandates that a court "draw single-member districts wheneverpossible." Ibid. The historical context confirms that once
a State is redistricted, and the court rules that the planis unconstitutional, $ 2c ensures that courts not order atlarge elections. Because in these pre-1967 cases the legisla-ture had redistricted "in the manner provided by the law
thereof," $ 2a(c) was not applicable. Thus, the Court cannotrely on these pre-1967 cases to support the notion that the

qualified voters in four of the five Congressional Districts of Kansas, seeking to have Kansas Statutes, which is the last congressional reapportionment by the Kansas Legislature, declared unconstitutional" (citation omitted)); Baker v. Clement, 247 F. Supp. 886, 888 (MD Tenn. 1965) ("This case

historical context surrounding the enactment of $ 2c renders$ 2a(c) toothless. Indeed, it is unclear why the Court examines this historical context at all. Cf. Bank One Chicago,
N. A. v. Midwest Bank & Trust Co., 516 U. S. 264, 279 (1996)
(Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)("In my view a law means what its text most appropriately

conveys, whatever the Congress that enacted it might have
`intended.' The law is what the law says, and we shouldcontent ourselves with reading it rather than psychoanalyzing those who enacted it").The Court also implies that it reads $ 2a(c) in the way it
does because our decisions in Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186
(1962), Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U. S. 1 (1964), and Reynolds
v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533 (1964), "ushered in a new era in which
federal courts were overseeing efforts by badly malapportioned States to conform their congressional electoral districts to the constitutionally required one-person, one-vote
standards." Ante, at 268. For Justice Stevens, these
decisions explain why Congress passed $ 2c. See ante, at
287, 289-290. But these watershed opinions cannot change
the meaning of $ 2a(c). First, a later development cannot
change an unamended statute. See Vermont Agency of
Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S.
765, 780-784 (2000) (Scalia, J.). Since $ 2a(c) was enacted
decades before the Baker line of cases, this subsequent development cannot change the interpretation of $ 2a(c).

Second, the Court's decision in Baker v. Carr, supra,
rested in large part on the fact that courts were already
involved in overseeing apportionment cases. Courts had
been "directing" redistricting disputes since well before
Baker. Ante, at 268. Indeed, the Court in Baker specifically acknowledged that "[a]n unbroken line of our precedents
sustains the federal courts' jurisdiction of the subject matter
of federal constitutional claims of this nature." 369 U. S., at
201-202 (citing cases, including Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S.
549 (1946)). In Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S., at 375, for exam538US1 Unit: $U36 [10-31-04 19:50:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
ple, we specifically reached the redistricting question, andheld that the prior versions of $$ 2c and 2a(c) mandated atlarge elections "in the absence of a redistricting act." Weheld that at-large elections were required "in order to afford
the representation to which the State is constitutionally enti-tled, and the general provisions of the Act of 1911 cannot be
regarded as intended to have a different import." Ibid.

In Wood v. Broom, 287 U. S. 1 (1932), the Court ruled onan issue strikingly similar to that in front of the Court today:

the effect of the prior versions of $$ 2c and 2a(c) when theMississippi congressional delegation was reduced by one
seat. In fact, the District Court in Wood made a ruling on
statutory grounds that would mirror the post-Baker constitutional review: "The District Court held that the new districts, created by the redistricting act, were not composed of
compact and contiguous territory, having as nearly as practicable the same number of inhabitants, and hence failed to
comply with the mandatory requirements of $ 3 of the Act of
August 8, 1911." 287 U. S., at 5. See also Hume v. Mahan,
1 F. Supp. 142 (ED Ky. 1932). Likewise, before Baker, state
courts had enforced prior versions of $$ 2c and 2a(c). See,
e. g., Moran v. Bowley, 347 Ill. 148, 179 N. E. 526 (1932); State
ex rel. Carroll v. Becker, 329 Mo. 501, 45 S. W. 2d 533 (1932).
In short, while Baker and its progeny expanded the scope of
federal court review, these cases did not change the fact that
this Court recognized federal court jurisdiction over this
subject matter at the time of $ 2a(c)'s enactment. Therefore,
the Baker line of cases could not have caused $ 2a(c) to magically change meaning.

The plurality also seems to base its sub silentio holding of
implied repeal on the fact that "[e]ighty percent" of $ 2a(c) is
"dead letter." Ante, at 273. But even assuming that the
first four parts of $ 2a(c) are currently unconstitutional, they
were not necessarily unconstitutional when Congress passed

$ 2c in 1967. For instance, $ 2a(c)(1) specifies that "[i]f there
is no change in the number of Representatives, they shall be

538US1 Unit: $U36 [10-31-04 19:50:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
elected from the districts then prescribed by the law of suchState." While it is true today that no district could in all

probability remain exactly the same after an apportionment,it was not true in 1967.

This Court did not hold that a strict zero-deviation ruleapplied to redistricting cases until the 1983 decision of

Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U. S. 725. Indeed, the decision of this
Court in Wesberry v. Sanders, supra, stated only that con-gressional districts must be equal to each other "as nearly

as is practicable." Id., at 7-8. As Justice Stevens pointsout, after

Wesberry, the House passed a bill in 1965 permitting congressional districts to deviate by as much as 15%.
See ante, at 287-288. In 1967, in the same Congress that
passed $ 2c, the House passed a bill permitting congressional
districts to deviate by as much as 10%. See ante, at 289.
And it appears that at least with the State of New Mexico,
the congressional apportionment plan did not change after
the 1970 census. See Martis 247 (noting that New Mexico
used its 1968 districting plan from the 91st through the 97th
Congresses--in other words, from 1968 through 1983).
These same principles also explain why as of 1967, $$ 2a(c)(2),
2a(c)(3), and 2a(c)(4) were similarly constitutional.

Even if parts of $ 2a(c) would be unconstitutional today, a
court can redistrict the existing district lines to make the
districts constitutional while ordering an at-large election
for the additional Representatives. Indeed, this approach
best accords with the principle that a federal court's "modifications of a state plan are limited to those necessary to
cure any constitutional or statutory defect." Upham v. Seamon, 456 U. S. 37, 43 (1982) (per curiam). And even if only

$ 2a(c)(5) were constitutional, the plurality correctly recognizes that $ 2a(c)(5) is easily severable from the rest of the
statute. See ante, at 273.

Finally, the fact that a court must enter an order under

$ 2a(c)(5) mandating at-large elections does not necessarily
mean that the plan would violate $$ 2 or 5 of the Voting

Rights Act, 42 U. S. C. $$ 1973, 1973c, or that traditionalwinner-take-all elections are required on a statewide basis.

Rather, as cross-appellants acknowledge, Brief for Cross-Appellants in No. 01-1596, pp. 27-28; Tr. of Oral Arg. 47-48,
a court could design an at-large election plan that awardsseats on a cumulative basis, or by some other method that
would result in a plan that satisfies the Voting Rights Act.Cf.

Growe v. Emison, 507 U. S. 25, 40 (1993); Rogers v. Lodge,458 U. S. 613, 616-617 (1982); Holder v. Hall, 512 U. S. 874,

897-898, 908-912 (1994) (Thomas, J., concurring in judg-ment); Dillard v. Chilton County Bd. of Ed., 699 F. Supp.
870 (MD Ala. 1988); see also S. Issacharoff, P. Karlan, & R.Pildes, The Law of Democracy 1091-1151 (rev. 2d ed. 2002);
Pildes & Donoghue, Cumulative Voting in the United States,1995 U. Chi. Legal F. 241, 251-257.

In short, I cannot agree that the phrase "[u]ntil a State isredistricted in the manner provided by the law thereof " contains any sort of "imminence" requirement, a requirementwithout any statutory mooring. And although the plurality
claims to hold that $ 2c does not impliedly repeal $ 2a(c), theplurality's opinion makes sense only if $ 2c serves as a partial
implied repeal of $ 2a(c). It is difficult to say, as the pluralitydoes, that $ 2a(c) "continues to apply,"

ante, at 273, and alsoto say, as the plurality does, that $ 2a(c) applies only if "the

election is so imminent that no entity competent to completeredistricting pursuant to . . . the mandate of $ 2c [ ] is able to
do so without disrupting the election process." Ante, at 275.Unless and until Congress expressly repeals $ 2a(c), I would
hold that federal courts are required to order some form ofat-large elections "[u]ntil a State is redistricted in the manner provided by the law thereof after any apportionment."

III
Having concluded that $ 2a(c) applies "[u]ntil a State is re-districted in the manner provided by the law thereof after

any apportionment," it is necessary to consider the question

538US1 Unit: $U36 [10-31-04 19:50:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

311Cite as: 538 U. S. 254 (2003)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
that the Court intentionally avoids: whether the State ofMississippi here has been "redistricted in the manner provided by the law thereof." If it has not, $ 2a(c) applies, andthe District Court should have ordered at-large elections.
If it has been "redistricted," the District Court was correctto draw single-member districts under $ 2c. Under this
Court's consistent case law, and under Mississippi state law,
a State is not "redistricted" until the apportionment plan hasbeen precleared under $ 5 of the Voting Rights Act, 42

U. S. C. $ 1973c. Because Mississippi's plan has not beenprecleared, I would hold that $ 2a(c) applies.

We have held that a "new reapportionment plan enacted
by a State . . . will not be considered `effective as law,' until
it has been submitted and has received clearance under $ 5."
Wise v. Lipscomb, 437 U. S. 535, 542 (1978) (plurality opinion)
(quoting Connor v. Finch, 431 U. S. 407, 412 (1977)) (citation
omitted). Accord, Connor v. Waller, 421 U. S., at 656 (an
apportionment plan is "not now and will not be effective as
laws until and unless cleared pursuant to $ 5"); Morris v.
Gressette, 432 U. S. 491, 501-502 (1977) ("Section 5 requires
covered jurisdictions to delay implementation of validly
enacted state legislation until federal authorities have had
an opportunity to determine whether that legislation conforms to the Constitution and to the provisions of the Voting
Rights Act"); Clark v. Roemer, 500 U. S. 646, 652 (1991); Hathorn v. Lovorn, 457 U. S. 255, 269 (1982) ("Our opinions
repeatedly note that failure to follow [the preclearance procedures] renders the change unenforceable"). Indeed, in
Hathorn v. Lovorn, we held that Mississippi itself could "not
further implement [a] change until the parties comply with

$ 5." Id., at 270.

Preclearance is the final step in the process of redistricting. If the apportionment plan is not precleared, it is not
"effective as law," and cannot be implemented. Under our
case law, then, a State is only redistricted once the clearance
process is complete. Before a covered jurisdiction receives

312 BRANCH v. SMITH

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
clearance, the Federal Government may force the State tomake changes to the redistricting plan. Once a State receives preclearance, it may implement a voting change.The Mississippi Supreme Court has recognized that the
redistricting process is not complete until the apportionmentplan is cleared: "Voting changes subject to $ 5 `will not be
effective as law until and unless cleared.' " In re McMillin,
642 So. 2d 1336, 1339 (Miss. 1994) (quoting Connor v. Waller,
supra, at 656). In McMillin, the Mississippi Supreme Court
held that a plan for nonpartisan judicial elections passed bythe legislature was not yet effective because it had not been

precleared. 642 So. 2d, at 1339. Consequently, the court
ordered elections to occur under the old plan, which required
partisan judicial elections. See ibid. ("Consequently, the
statutes currently governing primary judicial elections and
setting such elections for Tuesday, June 7, 1994, are the only
enforceable provisions regarding said primaries"). Thus,
despite the fact that the legislature had passed a law mandating nonpartisan judicial elections, despite the fact that the
new law expressly repealed the old law, despite the fact that
the Governor had signed the law, and despite the fact that
the State had submitted the new law to the United States
Attorney General for preclearance under $ 5, this new law
was not operative for one reason: The United States Attorney General had not precleared this new law by the time of
the new primary elections. See id., at 1338. Thus, at least
in Mississippi, the old voting plan remains in effect until the
new plan has been precleared.

Accordingly, the terms of $ 2a(c)(5) should apply here, and
the District Court should have ordered at-large elections for
the entire state congressional delegation. Congress can expressly repeal $ 2a(c) quite easily. But it has not done so.
This Court should not presume to act in Congress' stead.
And this Court should not read $ 2a(c) in a manner divorced
from any semblance of textual fidelity in order for it to reach
what it deems to be the "correct" or more unintrusive re538US1 Unit: $U36 [10-31-04 19:50:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ARCHER et ux. v. WARNER
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 01-1418. Argued January 13, 2003--Decided March 31, 2003
A debt is not dischargeable in bankruptcy "to the extent" it is "for money

. . . obtained by . . . fraud." 11 U. S. C. $ 523(a)(2)(A). Petitioners, the
Archers, sued respondent Warner and her former husband in state court
for (among other things) fraud connected with the sale of the Warners'
company to the Archers. In settling the lawsuit, the Archers executed
releases discharging the Warners from all present and future claims,
except for obligations under a $100,000 promissory note and related instruments. The Archers then voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit with
prejudice. After the Warners failed to make the first payment on the
promissory note, the Archers sued in state court. The Warners filed
for bankruptcy, and the Bankruptcy Court ordered liquidation under
Chapter 7. The Archers brought the present claim, asking the Bankruptcy Court to find the $100,000 debt nondischargeable, and to order
the Warners to pay the sum. Respondent Warner contested nondischargeability. The Bankruptcy Court denied the Archers' claim. The
District Court and the Fourth Circuit affirmed. The latter court held
that the settlement agreement, releases, and promissory note worked a
kind of "novation" that replaced (1) an original potential debt to the
Archers for money obtained by fraud with (2) a new debt for money
promised in a settlement contract that was dischargeable in bankruptcy.

Held: A debt for money promised in a settlement agreement accompanied

by the release of underlying tort claims can amount to a debt for money
obtained by fraud, within the nondischargeability statute's terms.
Pp. 318-323.

(a) The outcome here is governed by Brown v. Felsen, 442 U. S. 127,
in which (1) Brown filed a state-court suit seeking money that he said
Felsen had obtained through fraud; (2) the court entered a consent decree based on a stipulation providing that Felsen would pay Brown a
certain amount; (3) neither the decree nor the stipulation indicated the
payment was for fraud; (4) Felsen did not pay; (5) Felsen entered bankruptcy; and (6) Brown asked the Bankruptcy Court to look behind the
decree and stipulation and hold that the debt was nondischargeable because it was a debt for money obtained by fraud. Id., at 128-129. This
Court found that, although claim preclusion would bar Brown from making any claim " `based on the same cause of action' " that he had brought

Syllabus
in state court, id., at 131, it did not prevent the Bankruptcy Court from
looking beyond the state-court record and the documents terminating
the state-court proceeding to decide whether the debt was a debt for
money obtained by fraud, id., at 138-139. As a matter of logic, Brown's
holding means that the Fourth Circuit's novation theory cannot be right.
If reducing a fraud claim to settlement definitively changed the nature
of the debt for dischargeability purposes, the nature of the debt in
Brown would have changed similarly, thereby rendering that debt dischargeable. This Court's instruction that the Bankruptcy Court could
"weigh all the evidence," id., at 138, would have been pointless, as there
would have been nothing for the court to examine. Moreover, the
Court's statement in Brown that "the mere fact that a conscientious
creditor has previously reduced his claim to judgment should not bar
further inquiry into the true nature of the debt," ibid., strongly favors
the Archers' position. Finally, Brown's basic reasoning applies here.
The Court noted that a change in the Bankruptcy Code's nondischargeability provision indicated that "Congress intended the fullest
possible inquiry" to ensure that "all debts arising out of" fraud are "excepted from discharge," no matter their form. Ibid. Congress also intended to allow the determination whether a debt arises out of fraud to
take place in bankruptcy court, not to force it to occur earlier in state
court when nondischargeability concerns "are not directly in issue and
neither party has a full incentive to litigate them." Id., at 134. The
only difference between Brown and this case--that the relevant debt
here is embodied in a settlement, not in a stipulation and consent judgment--is not determinative, since the dischargeability provision applies
to all debts that "aris[e] out of" fraud. Id., at 138. Pp. 318-322.

(b) The Fourth Circuit remains free, on remand, to determine
whether Warner's additional arguments were properly raised or preserved, and, if so, to decide them. Pp. 322-323.

. . . obtained by . . . false pretenses, a false representation, oractual fraud." 11 U. S. C. $ 523(a)(2)(A). Can this language
cover a debt embodied in a settlement agreement that set-tled a creditor's earlier claim "for money . . . obtained by . . .
fraud"? In our view, the statute can cover such a debt, andwe reverse a lower court judgment to the contrary.

through fraud; (2) the parties settle the lawsuit and releaserelated claims; (3) the settlement agreement does not resolve

the issue of fraud, but provides that B will pay A a fixedsum; (4)

B does not pay the fixed sum; (5) B enters bankruptcy; and (6) A claims that B's obligation to pay the fixedsettlement sum is nondischargeable because, like the original

debt, it is for "money . . . obtained by . . . fraud."

This outline summarizes the following circumstances: Inlate 1991, Leonard and Arlene Warner bought the Warner

Manufacturing Company for $250,000. About six monthslater they sold the company to Elliott and Carol Archer for
$610,000. A few months after that the Archers sued the
Warners in North Carolina state court for (among other
things) fraud connected with the sale.

In May 1995, the parties settled the lawsuit. The settlement agreement specified that the Warners would pay the
Archers "$300,000.00 less legal and accounting expenses"
"as compensation for emotional distress/personal injury type
damages." App. 61. It added that the Archers would "execute releases to any and all claims . . . arising out of this
litigation, except as to amounts set forth in [the] Settlement
Agreement." Id., at 63. The Warners paid the Archers
$200,000 and executed a promissory note for the remaining
$100,000. The Archers executed releases "discharg[ing]"
the Warners "from any and every right, claim, or demand"
that the Archers "now have or might otherwise hereafter
have against" them, "excepting only obligations under" the
promissory note and related instruments. Id., at 67; see also
id., at 70. The releases, signed by all parties, added that
the parties did not "admi[t] any liability or wrongdoing," that
the settlement was "the compromise of disputed claims, and
that payment [was] not to be construed as an admission of
liability." Id., at 67-68, 71. A few days later the Archers
voluntarily dismissed the state-court lawsuit with prejudice.

In November 1995, the Warners failed to make the first
payment on the $100,000 promissory note. The Archers

Opinion of the Court
sued for the payment in state court. The Warners filedfor bankruptcy. The Bankruptcy Court ordered liquidation

under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. And the Archersbrought the present claim, asking the Bankruptcy Court to
find the $100,000 debt nondischargeable, and to order theWarners to pay the $100,000. Leonard Warner agreed to
a consent order holding his debt nondischargeable. ArleneWarner contested nondischargeability. The Archers argued
that Arlene Warner's promissory note debt was nondis-chargeable because it was for "money . . . obtained by . . .
fraud."The Bankruptcy Court, finding the promissory note debt
dischargeable, denied the Archers' claim. The DistrictCourt affirmed the Bankruptcy Court. And the Court of
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, dividing two to one, affirmedthe District Court. 283 F. 3d 230 (2002). The majority reasoned that the settlement agreement, releases, and promis-sory note had worked a kind of "novation." This novation
replaced (1) an original potential debt to the Archers formoney obtained by fraud with (2) a new debt. The new debt
was not for money obtained by fraud. It was for moneypromised in a settlement contract. And it was consequently
dischargeable in bankruptcy.We granted the Archers' petition for certiorari, 536 U. S.
938 (2002), because different Circuits have come to differentconclusions about this matter, compare In re West, 22 F. 3d
775, 778 (CA7 1994) (supporting the novation theory), withUnited States v. Spicer, 57 F. 3d 1152, 1155 (CADC 1995)
("The weight of recent authority rejects" the novation the-ory), cert. denied, 516 U. S. 1043 (1996).

II
We agree with the Court of Appeals and the dissent, post,at 324-325 (opinion of

Thomas, J.), that "[t]he settlementagreement and promissory note here, coupled with the broad

language of the release, completely addressed and released

Opinion of the Court
each and every underlying state law claim." 283 F. 3d, at237. That agreement left only one relevant debt: a debt for

money promised in the settlement agreement itself. To rec-ognize that fact, however, does not end our inquiry. We
must decide whether that same debt can also amount to adebt for

money obtained by fraud, within the terms of the
nondischargeability statute. Given this Court's precedent,
we believe that it can.

Brown v. Felsen, 442 U. S. 127 (1979), governs the outcome here. The circumstances there were the following:(1) Brown sued Felsen in state court seeking money that

(Brown said) Felsen had obtained through fraud; (2) the state
court entered a consent decree embodying a stipulation providing that Felsen would pay Brown a certain amount;
(3) neither the decree nor the stipulation indicated the payment was for fraud; (4) Felsen did not pay; (5) Felsen entered
bankruptcy; and (6) Brown asked the Bankruptcy Court to
look behind the decree and stipulation and to hold that the
debt was nondischargeable because it was a debt for money
obtained by fraud. Id., at 128-129.

The lower courts had held against Brown. They pointed
out that the relevant debt was for money owed pursuant to
a consent judgment; they noted that the relevant judgmentrelated documents did not refer to fraud; they added that the
doctrine of res judicata prevented the Bankruptcy Court
from looking behind those documents to uncover the nature
of the claim that had led to their creation; and they consequently concluded that the relevant debt could not be characterized as one for money obtained by fraud. Id., at 130-131.

This Court unanimously rejected the lower court's reasoning. The Court conceded that the state law of claim preclusion would bar Brown from making any claim " `based on the
same cause of action' " that Brown had brought in state
court. Id., at 131 (quoting Montana v. United States, 440
U. S. 147, 153 (1979)). Indeed, this aspect of res judicata
would prevent Brown from litigating "all grounds for . . .

320 ARCHER v. WARNER

Opinion of the Court
recovery" previously available to Brown, whether or notBrown had previously "asserted" those grounds in the prior

state-court "proceeding." 442 U. S., at 131. But all this,the Court held, was beside the point. Claim preclusion did
not prevent the Bankruptcy Court from looking beyond therecord of the state-court proceeding and the documents that
terminated that proceeding (the stipulation and consent
judgment) in order to decide whether the debt at issue(namely, the debt embodied in the consent decree and stipulation) was a debt for money obtained by fraud. Id., at138-139.

As a matter of logic, Brown's holding means that the
Fourth Circuit's novation theory cannot be right. The reduction of Brown's state-court fraud claim to a stipulation
(embodied in a consent decree) worked the same kind of novation as the "novation" at issue here. (Despite the dissent's suggestions to the contrary, post, at 327, it did so by
an agreement of the parties that would seem to have "sever[ed] the causal relationship," ibid., between liquidated debt
and underlying fraud no more and no less than did the settlement and releases at issue here.) Yet, in Brown, this Court
held that the Bankruptcy Court should look behind that stipulation to determine whether it reflected settlement of a
valid claim for fraud. If the Fourth Circuit's view were correct--if reducing a fraud claim to settlement definitively
changed the nature of the debt for dischargeability purposes--the nature of the debt in Brown would have changed
similarly, thereby rendering the debt dischargeable. This
Court's instruction that the Bankruptcy Court could "weigh
all the evidence," 442 U. S., at 138, would have been pointless. There would have been nothing for the Bankruptcy
Court to examine.

Moreover, the Court's language in Brown strongly favors
the Archers' position here. The Court said that "the mere
fact that a conscientious creditor has previously reduced his
claim to judgment should not bar further inquiry into the

538US1 Unit: $U37 [10-26-04 20:09:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
true nature of the debt." Ibid.; accord, Grogan v. Garner,498 U. S. 279, 290 (1991) (assuming that the Bankruptcy Code

seeks to "permit exception from discharge of all fraud claimscreditors have successfully reduced to judgment"). If we
substitute the word "settlement" for the word "judgment,"the Court's statement describes this case.

Finally, the Court's basic reasoning in Brown applies here.
The Court pointed out that the Bankruptcy Code's nondis-chargeability provision had originally covered "only `judgments' sounding in fraud." 442 U. S., at 138. Congresslater changed the language so that it covered all such " `liabilities.' " Ibid. This change indicated that "Congress intended the fullest possible inquiry" to ensure that "all debts
arising out of " fraud are "excepted from discharge," no matter what their form. Ibid.; see also 11 U. S. C. $ 523(a) (current "any debt" language). Congress also intended to allow
the relevant determination (whether a debt arises out of
fraud) to take place in bankruptcy court, not to force it to
occur earlier in state court at a time when nondischargeability concerns "are not directly in issue and neither party has
a full incentive to litigate them." Brown, 442 U. S., at 134.

The only difference we can find between Brown and the
present case consists of the fact that the relevant debt here
is embodied in a settlement, not in a stipulation and consent
judgment. But we do not see how that difference could
prove determinative. The dischargeability provision applies to all debts that "aris[e] out of " fraud. Id., at 138; see
also Cohen v. de la Cruz, 523 U. S. 213, 215 (1998). A debt
embodied in the settlement of a fraud case "arises" no less
"out of " the underlying fraud than a debt embodied in a stipulation and consent decree. Policies that favor the settlement of disputes, like those that favor "repose," are neither
any more nor any less at issue here than in Brown. See 442
U. S., at 133-135. In Brown, the doctrine of res judicata
itself ensured "a blanket release" of the underlying claim of
fraud, just as the contractual releases did here, post, at 324.

322 ARCHER v. WARNER

Opinion of the Court
See supra, at 318-319. Despite the dissent's protests to thecontrary,

post, at 323-327, what has not been established
here, as in Brown, is that the parties meant to resolve the
issue of fraud or, more narrowly, to resolve that issue for
purposes of a later claim of nondischargeability in bank-ruptcy. In a word, we can find no significant difference between Brown and the case now before us.

Arlene Warner argues that we should affirm the Court ofAppeals' decision on alternative grounds. She says that the

settlement agreement and releases not only worked a nova-tion by converting potential tort liabilities into a contract
debt, but also included a promise that the Archers would not
make the present claim of nondischargeability for fraud.
She adds that, in any event, because the Archers dismissed
the original fraud action with prejudice, North Carolina law
treats the fraud issue as having been litigated and determined in her favor, thereby barring the Archers from making their present claim on grounds of collateral estoppel.
But cf. Arizona v. California, 530 U. S. 392, 414 (2000)
("[S]ettlements ordinarily occasion no issue preclusion . . .
unless it is clear . . . that the parties intend their agreement
to have such an effect").

Without suggesting that these additional arguments are
meritorious, we note that the Court of Appeals did not determine the merits of either argument, both of which are, in
any event, outside the scope of the question presented and
insufficiently addressed below. See Roberts v. Galen of Va.,
Inc., 525 U. S. 249, 253-254 (1999) (per curiam). We choose
to leave initial evaluation of these arguments to "[t]he federal
judges who deal regularly with questions of state law in
their respective districts and circuits," and who "are in a
better position than we," Butner v. United States, 440 U. S.
48, 58 (1979), to determine, for example, whether the parties intended their agreement and dismissal to have issuepreclusive, as well as claim-preclusive, effect, and to what
extent such preclusion applies to enforcement of a debt spe538US1 Unit: $U37 [10-26-04 20:09:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN

cifically excepted from the releases, supra, at 317; post,at 325. The Court of Appeals remains free, on remand, to

determine whether such questions were properly raised orpreserved, and, if so, to decide them.

We conclude that the Archers' settlement agreement andreleases may have worked a kind of novation, but that fact
does not bar the Archers from showing that the settlementdebt arose out of "false pretenses, a false representation,
or actual fraud," and consequently is nondischargeable, 11U. S. C. $ 523(a)(2)(A). We reverse the Court of Appeals'
judgment to the contrary. And we remand this case for fur-ther proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Stevens joins,dissenting.

Section 523(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code excepts from dis-charge "any debt . . . for money, property, [or] services, . . .
to the extent obtained by . . . false pretenses, a false repre-sentation, or actual fraud." 11 U. S. C. $ 523(a)(2)(A) (emphasis added). The Court holds that a debt owed under asettlement agreement was "obtained by" fraud even though
the debt resulted from a contractual arrangement pursuantto which the parties agreed, using the broadest language
possible, to release one another from "any and every right,claim, or demand . . . arising out of " a fraud action filed by
petitioners in North Carolina state court. App. 67. Be-cause the Court's conclusion is supported neither by the text
of the Bankruptcy Code nor by any of the agreements exe-cuted by the parties, I respectfully dissent.

The Court begins its description of this case with the ob-servation that "the settlement agreement does not resolve
the issue of fraud, but provides that B will pay A a fixedsum." Ante, at 317 (emphasis added). Based on that erroneous premise, the Court goes on to find that there is "nosignificant difference between

Brown [v. Felsen, 442 U. S. 127

Thomas, J., dissenting
(1979),] and [this case]." Ante, at 322. The only distinction,the Court explains, is that "the relevant debt here is embodied in a settlement, not in a stipulation and consent judg-ment" as in

Brown v. Felsen, 442 U. S. 127 (1979). Ante,
at 321.Remarkably, however, the Court fails to address the critical difference between this case and Brown: The parties here
executed a blanket release, rather than entered into a con-sent judgment. And, in my view, "if it is shown that [a] note

was given and received as payment or waiver of the originaldebt and the parties agreed that the note was to substitute
a new obligation for the old, the note fully discharges the
original debt, and the nondischargeability of the original
debt does not affect the dischargeability of the obligation
under the note." In re West, 22 F. 3d 775, 778 (CA7 1994).
That is the case before us, and, accordingly, Brown does not
control our disposition of this matter.

In Brown, Brown sued Felsen in state court, alleging that
Felsen had fraudulently induced him to act as guarantor on
a bank loan. 442 U. S., at 128. The suit was settled by stipulation, which was incorporated by the court into a consent
judgment, but "[n]either the stipulation nor the resulting
judgment indicated the cause of action on which respondent's
liability to petitioner was based." Ibid. The Court held
that principles of res judicata did not bar the Bankruptcy
Court from looking behind the consent judgment and stipulation to determine the extent to which the debt was "obtained
by" fraud. The Court concluded that it would upset the
policy of the Bankruptcy Code for "state courts to decide
[questions of nondischargeability] at a stage when they are
not directly in issue and neither party has a full incentive to
litigate them." Id., at 134. Brown did not, however, address the question presented in this case--whether a creditor may, without the participation of the state court, completely release a debtor from "any and every right, claim, or
demand . . . relating to" a state-court fraud action. App. 67.

538US1 Unit: $U37 [10-26-04 20:09:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

325Cite as: 538 U. S. 314 (2003)
Thomas, J., dissenting
Based on the sweeping language of the general release, itis inaccurate for the Court to say that the parties did not

"resolve the issue of fraud." Ante, at 317. To be sure, asin Brown, there is no legally controlling document stating
that respondent did (or did not) commit fraud. But, unlikein Brown, where it was not clear which claims were being
resolved by the consent judgment, the release in this caseclearly demonstrates that the parties intended to resolve
conclusively not only the issue of fraud, but also any other"right[s], claim[s], or demand[s]" related to the state-court
litigation, "excepting only obligations under [the] Note anddeeds of trust."

1 App. 67. See McNair v. Goodwin, 262

N. C. 1, 7, 136 S. E. 2d 218, 223 (1964) (" `[A] compromiseagreement is conclusive between the parties as to the matters compromised' " (quoting Penn Dixie Lines v. Grannick,238 N. C. 552, 556, 78 S. E. 2d 410, 414 (1953))).

The fact that the parties intended, by the language of thegeneral release, to replace an "old" fraud debt with a "new"
contract debt is an important distinction from Brown, for thetext of the Bankruptcy Code prohibits discharge of any debt
"to the extent obtained by" fraud. 11 U. S. C. $ 523(a)(2)(emphasis added). In interpreting this provision, the Court
has recognized that, in order for a creditor to establish thata debt is not dischargeable, he must demonstrate that there
is a causal nexus between the fraud and the debt. SeeCohen v. de la Cruz, 523 U. S. 213, 218 (1998) (describing

$ 523(a)(2)(A) as barring discharge of debts " `resultingfrom' " or " `traceable to' " fraud (quoting Field v. Mans, 516
U. S. 59, 61, 64 (1995))). Indeed, petitioners conceded at oralargument that the "obtained by" language of $ 523(a)(2) requires a creditor to prove that a debtor's fraud is the proxi-mate cause of the debt. Tr. of Oral Arg. 10, 12; see also 1

damage; the loss must be the direct result of, or proximately
traceable to, the breach of an obligation owing to the plaintiff " (emphasis added)).This Court has been less than clear with respect to the

requirements for establishing proximate cause. In the past,the Court has applied the term " `proximate cause' to label
generically the judicial tools used to limit a person's responsibility for the consequences of that person's own acts."
Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503
U. S. 258, 268 (1992). The Court has explained that, "[a]tbottom, the notion of proximate cause reflects `ideas of

what justice demands, or of what is administratively possible and convenient.' " Ibid. (quoting W. Keeton, D. Dobbs,
R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts

$ 41, p. 264 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter Keeton)); see also
Palsgraf v. Long Island R. R. Co., 248 N. Y. 339, 352, 162
N. E. 99, 103 (1928) (Andrews, J., dissenting) ("What we do
mean by the word `proximate' is, that because of convenience, of public policy, of a rough sense of justice, the law
arbitrarily declines to trace a series of events beyond a certain point"). While the concept of proximate cause is somewhat amorphous, see Keeton 279, the common law is clear
that certain intervening events--otherwise called "superseding causes"--are sufficient to sever the causal nexus and cut
off all liability. See Exxon Co., U. S. A. v. Sofec, Inc., 517
U. S. 830, 837 (1996) (" `The doctrine of superseding cause is
. . . applied where the defendant's negligence in fact substantially contributed to the plaintiff 's injury, but the injury was
actually brought about by a later cause of independent origin
that was not foreseeable' " (quoting 1 T. Schoenbaum, Admiralty and Maritime Law $ 5-3, pp. 165-166 (2d ed. 1994)));
57A Am. Jur. 2d, Negligence $ 790, p. 701 (1989) ("The intervention, between the negligence of the defendant and the

the injury, and he cannot be held liable, notwithstanding theexistence of some connection between his negligence and

the injury").In this case, we are faced with the novel situation where
the parties have, by agreement, attempted to sever thecausal relationship between the debtor's fraudulent conduct
and the debt.2 In my view, the "intervening" settlementand release create the equivalent of a superseding cause, no
different from the intervening negligent acts of a third partyin a negligence action. In this case, the parties have made
clear their intent to replace the old "fraud" debt with a new"contract" debt. Accordingly, the only debt that remains intact for bankruptcy purposes is the one "obtained by" volun-tary agreement of the parties, not by fraud.

Petitioners' own actions in the course of this litigation support this conclusion. Throughout the proceedings below andcontinuing in this Court, petitioners have sought to recover

only the amount of the debt set forth in the settlement agreement, which is lower than the total damages they allegedlysuffered as a result of respondent's alleged fraud. See Brief

for Petitioners 21 ("[T]he nondischargeability action wasbrought solely in order to enforce the agreement to pay [the
amount in the settlement agreement]"). This crucial factdemonstrates that petitioners seek to recover a debt based
only in contract, not in fraud.

2 Petitioners argue that any prepetition waiver of nondischargeability
protections should be deemed unenforceable because it is inconsistent with
the Bankruptcy Code and impairs the rights of third-party creditors.
Brief for Petitioners 24. As respondent points out, however, a creditor
forfeits the right to contest dischargeability if it fails to affirmatively request a hearing within 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of
the creditors. See 11 U. S. C. $ 523(c)(1); Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 4007(c).
Thus, presumably, creditors may choose, for any or no reason at all, to
forgo an assertion of nondischargeability under $ 523(a)(2). Indeed, petitioners have failed to point to any provision of the Bankruptcy Code that
specifically bars a creditor from entering into an agreement that impairs
its right to contest dischargeability.

Thomas, J., dissenting
The Court concludes otherwise. The Court, however,does not explain why it permits petitioners to look at the

settlement agreement for the amount of the debt they seekto recover but not for the character of that debt. Neither
this Court's precedents nor the text of the Bankruptcy Codepermits such a selective implementation of a valid agreement
between the parties. * * *

The Court today ignores the plain intent of the parties, asevidenced by a properly executed settlement agreement and
general release, holding that a debt owed by respondentunder a contract was "obtained by" fraud. Because I find
no support for the Court's conclusion in the text of the Bank-ruptcy Code, or in the agreements of the parties, I respectfully dissent.

KENTUCKY ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS,

INC., et al. v. MILLER, COMMISSIONER,

KENTUCKY DEPARTMENT OF

INSURANCE

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 00-1471. Argued January 14, 2003--Decided April 2, 2003
Petitioner health maintenance organizations (HMOs) maintain exclusive

"provider networks" with selected doctors, hospitals, and other healthcare providers. Kentucky has enacted two "Any Willing Provider"
(AWP) statutes, which prohibit "[a] health insurer [from] discriminat[ing] against any provider who is . . . willing to meet the terms and
conditions for participation established by the . . . insurer," and require
a "health benefit plan that includes chiropractic benefits [to] . . . [p]ermit
any licensed chiropractor who agrees to abide by the terms [and] conditions . . . of the . . . plan to serve as a participating primary chiropractic
provider." Petitioners filed this suit against respondent, the Commissioner of Kentucky's Department of Insurance, asserting that the AWP
laws are pre-empted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974 (ERISA), which pre-empts all state laws "insofar as they . . .
relate to any employee benefit plan," 29 U. S. C. $ 1144(a), but saves from
pre-emption state "law[s] . . . which regulat[e] insurance . . . ,"

$ 1144(b)(2)(A). The District Court concluded that although both AWP
statutes "relate to" employee benefit plans under $ 1144(a), each law
"regulates insurance" and is therefore saved from pre-emption by

$ 1144(b)(2)(A). The Sixth Circuit affirmed.

Held: Kentucky's AWP statutes are "law[s] . . . which regulat[e] insurance"

under $ 1144(b)(2)(A). Pp. 334-342.

(a) For these statutes to be "law[s] . . . which regulat[e] insurance,"
they must be "specifically directed toward" the insurance industry; laws
of general application that have some bearing on insurers do not qualify.
E. g., Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41, 50. However, not all
state laws "specifically directed toward" the insurance industry will be
covered by $ 1144(b)(2)(A), which saves laws that regulate insurance,
not insurers. Insurers must be regulated "with respect to their insurance practices." Rush Prudential HMO, Inc. v. Moran, 536 U. S. 355,

330 KENTUCKY ASSN. OF HEALTH PLANS, INC. v. MILLER

Syllabus
(b) Petitioners argue that the AWP laws are not "specifically directed" toward the insurance industry. The Court disagrees. Neither
of these statutes, by its terms, imposes any prohibitions or requirements
on providers, who may still enter exclusive networks with insurers who
conduct business outside the Commonwealth or who are otherwise not
covered by the AWP laws. The statutes are transgressed only when
a "health insurer," or a "health benefit plan that includes chiropractic
benefits," excludes from its network a provider who is willing and able
to meet its terms. Pp. 334-336.

(c) Also unavailing is petitioners' contention that Kentucky's AWP
laws fall outside $ 1144(b)(2)(A)'s scope because they do not regulate an
insurance practice but focus upon the relationship between an insurer
and third-party providers. Petitioners rely on Group Life & Health
Ins. Co. v. Royal Drug Co., 440 U. S. 205, 210, which held that thirdparty provider arrangements between insurers and pharmacies were
not "the `business of insurance' " under $ 2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson
Act. ERISA's saving clause, however, is not concerned (as is the
McCarran-Ferguson Act provision) with how to characterize conduct
undertaken by private actors, but with how to characterize state laws
in regard to what they "regulate." Kentucky's laws "regulate" insurance by imposing conditions on the right to engage in the business of
insurance. To come within ERISA's saving clause those conditions
must also substantially affect the risk pooling arrangement between insurer and insured. Kentucky's AWP statutes pass this test by altering
the scope of permissible bargains between insurers and insureds in a
manner similar to the laws we upheld in Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v.
Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724, UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America v. Ward,
526 U. S. 358, and Rush Prudential, supra. Pp. 337-339.

(d) The Court's prior use, to varying degrees, of its cases interpreting

$$ 2(a) and 2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act in the ERISA saving
clause context has misdirected attention, failed to provide clear guidance
to lower federal courts, and, as this case demonstrates, added little to
the relevant analysis. The Court has never held that the McCarranFerguson factors are an essential component of the $ 1144(b)(2)(A) inquiry. Today the Court makes a clean break from the McCarranFerguson factors in interpreting ERISA's saving clause. Pp. 339-342.

established by the health insurer, including the Kentuckystate Medicaid program and Medicaid partnerships." Ky.

Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 304.17A-270 (West 2001). Moreover, any"health benefit plan that includes chiropractic benefits shall
. . . [p]ermit any licensed chiropractor who agrees to abide bythe terms, conditions, reimbursement rates, and standards of
quality of the health benefit plan to serve as a participatingprimary chiropractic provider to any person covered by the
plan." $ 304.17A-171(2). We granted certiorari to decidewhether the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 (ERISA) pre-empts either, or both, of these "Any Will-ing Provider" (AWP) statutes.

I
Petitioners include several health maintenance organiza-tions (HMOs) and a Kentucky-based association of HMOs.

In order to control the quality and cost of health-care deliv-ery, these HMOs have contracted with selected doctors, hospitals, and other health-care providers to create exclusive"provider networks." Providers in such networks agree to
render health-care services to the HMOs' subscribers at dis-counted rates and to comply with other contractual requirements. In return, they receive the benefit of patient volumehigher than that achieved by nonnetwork providers who lack
access to petitioners' subscribers.Kentucky's AWP statutes impair petitioners' ability to
limit the number of providers with access to their networks,and thus their ability to use the assurance of high patient
volume as the quid pro quo for the discounted rates thatnetwork membership entails. Petitioners believe that AWP
laws will frustrate their efforts at cost and quality control,and will ultimately deny consumers the benefit of their costreducing arrangements with providers.In April 1997, petitioners filed suit against respondent,
the Commissioner of Kentucky's Department of Insurance,in the United States District Court for the Eastern District

Opinion of the Court
of Kentucky, asserting that ERISA, 88 Stat. 832, asamended, pre-empts Kentucky's AWP laws. ERISA preempts all state laws "insofar as they may now or hereafterrelate to any employee benefit plan," 29 U. S. C. $ 1144(a),
but state "law[s] . . . which regulat[e] insurance, banking, orsecurities" are saved from pre-emption, $ 1144(b)(2)(A). The
District Court concluded that although both AWP statutes
"relate to" employee benefit plans under $ 1144(a), each law"regulates insurance" and is therefore saved from preemption by $ 1144(b)(2)(A). App. to Pet. for Cert. 64a-84a.In affirming the District Court, the Sixth Circuit also concluded that the AWP laws "regulat[e] insurance" and fall
within ERISA's saving clause. Kentucky Assn. of Health
Plans, Inc. v. Nichols, 227 F. 3d 352, 363-372 (2000). Relying on UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America v. Ward, 526 U. S.
358 (1999), the Sixth Circuit first held that Kentucky's AWP
laws regulate insurance "as a matter of common sense," 227
F. 3d, at 364, because they are "specifically directed toward
`insurers' and the insurance industry . . . ," id., at 366. The
Sixth Circuit then considered, as "checking points or guideposts" in its analysis, the three factors used to determine
whether a practice fits within "the business of health insurance" in our cases interpreting the McCarran-Ferguson Act.
Id., at 364. These factors are: "first, whether the practice
has the effect of transferring or spreading a policyholder's
risk; second, whether the practice is an integral part of the
policy relationship between the insurer and the insured; and
third, whether the practice is limited to entities within the
insurance industry." Union Labor Life Ins. Co. v. Pireno,
458 U. S. 119, 129 (1982). The Sixth Circuit found all three
factors satisfied. 227 F. 3d, at 368-371. Notwithstanding
its analysis of the McCarran-Ferguson factors, the Sixth Circuit reiterated that the "basic test" under ERISA's saving
clause is whether, from a commonsense view, the Kentucky
AWP laws regulate insurance. Id., at 372. Finding that
the laws passed both the "common sense" test and the

Opinion of the Court
McCarran-Ferguson "checking points," the Sixth Circuit up-held Kentucky's AWP statutes. Ibid.

We granted certiorari, 536 U. S. 956 (2002).

II
To determine whether Kentucky's AWP statutes are savedfrom pre-emption, we must ascertain whether they are

"law[s] . . . which regulat[e] insurance" under $ 1144(b)(2)(A).It is well established in our case law that a state law must
be "specifically directed toward" the insurance industry inorder to fall under ERISA's saving clause; laws of general
application that have some bearing on insurers do not qual-ify. Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41, 50 (1987);
see also Rush Prudential HMO, Inc. v. Moran, 536 U. S. 355,366 (2002); FMC Corp. v. Holliday, 498 U. S. 52, 61 (1990).
At the same time, not all state laws "specifically di-rected toward" the insurance industry will be covered by

$ 1144(b)(2)(A), which saves laws that regulate insurance,not insurers. As we explained in Rush Prudential, insurers
must be regulated "with respect to their insurance prac-tices," 536 U. S., at 366. Petitioners contend that Kentucky's AWP laws fall outside the scope of $ 1144(b)(2)(A) fortwo reasons. First, because Kentucky has failed to "specifically direc[t]" its AWP laws toward the insurance indus-try; and second, because the AWP laws do not regulate an
insurance practice. We find neither contention persuasive.

A
Petitioners claim that Kentucky's statutes are not "spe-cifically directed toward" insurers because they regulate not

only the insurance industry but also doctors who seek toform and maintain limited provider networks with HMOs.
That is to say, the AWP laws equally prevent providers fromentering into limited network contracts with insurers, just
as they prevent insurers from creating exclusive networksin the first place. We do not think it follows that Kentucky

538US2 Unit: $U38 [10-26-04 16:53:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

335Cite as: 538 U. S. 329 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
has failed to specifically direct its AWP laws at the insur-ance industry.

Neither of Kentucky's AWP statutes, by its terms, imposesany prohibitions or requirements on health-care providers.
See Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 304.17A-270 (West 2001) (imposingobligations only on "health insurer[s]" not to discriminate
against any willing provider); $ 304.17A-171 (imposing obligations only on "health benefit plan[s] that includ[e] chiro-practic benefits"). And Kentucky health-care providers are

still capable of entering exclusive networks with insurerswho conduct business outside the Commonwealth of Kentucky or who are otherwise not covered by $$ 304.17A-270
or 304.17A-171. Kentucky's statutes are transgressed only
when a "health insurer," or a "health benefit plan that includes chiropractic benefits," excludes from its network a
provider who is willing and able to meet its terms.

It is of course true that as a consequence of Kentucky's
AWP laws, entities outside the insurance industry (such as
health-care providers) will be unable to enter into certain
agreements with Kentucky insurers. But the same could be
said about the state laws we held saved from pre-emption in
FMC Corp. and Rush Prudential. Pennsylvania's law prohibiting insurers from exercising subrogation rights against
an insured's tort recovery, see FMC Corp., supra, at 55, n. 1,
also prevented insureds from entering into enforceable contracts with insurers allowing subrogation. Illinois' requirement that HMOs provide independent review of whether
services are "medically necessary," Rush Prudential, supra,
at 372, likewise excluded insureds from joining an HMO that
would have withheld the right to independent review in exchange for a lower premium. Yet neither case found the effects of these laws on noninsurers, significant though they
may have been, inconsistent with the requirement that laws
saved from pre-emption by $ 1144(b)(2)(A) be "specifically
directed toward" the insurance industry. Regulations "directed toward" certain entities will almost always disable

336 KENTUCKY ASSN. OF HEALTH PLANS, INC. v. MILLER

Opinion of the Court
other entities from doing, with the regulated entities, what
the regulations forbid; this does not suffice to place such regulation outside the scope of ERISA's saving clause.1

1 Petitioners also contend that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 304.17A-270 (West
2001) is not "specifically directed toward" insurers because it applies to
"self-insurer or multiple employer welfare arrangement[s] not exempt
from state regulation by ERISA." $ 304.17A-005(23). We do not think

$ 304.17A-270's application to self-insured non-ERISA plans forfeits its
status as a "law . . . which regulates insurance" under 29 U. S. C.

$ 1144(b)(2)(A). ERISA's saving clause does not require that a state law
regulate "insurance companies" or even "the business of insurance" to be
saved from pre-emption; it need only be a "law . . . which regulates insurance," ibid. (emphasis added), and self-insured plans engage in the same
sort of risk pooling arrangements as separate entities that provide insurance to an employee benefit plan. Any contrary view would render superfluous ERISA's "deemer clause," $ 1144(b)(2)(B), which provides that an
employee benefit plan covered by ERISA may not "be deemed to be an
insurance company or other insurer . . . or to be engaged in the business
of insurance . . . for purposes of any law of any State purporting to regulate insurance companies [or] insurance contracts. . . ." That clause has
effect only on state laws saved from pre-emption by $ 1144(b)(2)(A) that
would, in the absence of $ 1144(b)(2)(B), be allowed to regulate self-insured
employee benefit plans. Under petitioners' view, such laws would never
be saved from pre-emption in the first place. (The deemer clause presents
no obstacle to Kentucky's law, which reaches only those employee benefit
plans "not exempt from state regulation by ERISA.")

Both of Kentucky's AWP laws apply to all HMOs, including HMOs that
do not act as insurers but instead provide only administrative services to
self-insured plans. Petitioners maintain that the application to noninsuring HMOs forfeits the laws' status as "law[s] . . . which regulat[e] insurance." $ 1144(b)(2)(A). We disagree. To begin with, these noninsuring
HMOs would be administering self-insured plans, which we think suffices to bring them within the activity of insurance for purposes of

$ 1144(b)(2)(A). Moreover, we think petitioners' argument is foreclosed
by Rush Prudential HMO, Inc. v. Moran, 536 U. S. 355, 372 (2002), where
we noted that Illinois' independent-review laws contained "some overbreadth in the application of [215 Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 125,] $ 4-10 [(2000)]
beyond orthodox HMOs," yet held that "there is no reason to think Congress would have meant such minimal application to noninsurers to remove a state law entirely from the category of insurance regulation saved
from preemption."

Opinion of the Court

B
Petitioners claim that the AWP laws do not regulate insur-ers with respect to an insurance practice because, unlike the

state laws we held saved from pre-emption in Metropolitan
Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724 (1985), UNUM,and Rush Prudential, they do not control the actual terms of

insurance policies. Rather, they focus upon the relationshipbetween an insurer and third-party providers--which in
petitioners' view does not constitute an "insurance practice."In support of their contention, petitioners rely on Group
Life & Health Ins. Co. v. Royal Drug Co., 440 U. S. 205, 210(1979), which held that third-party provider arrangements
between insurers and pharmacies were not "the `businessof insurance' " under $ 2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.

2

ERISA's saving clause, however, is not concerned (as is theMcCarran-Ferguson Act provision) with how to characterize

conduct undertaken by private actors, but with how to char-acterize

state laws in regard to what they "regulate." Itdoes not follow from Royal Drug that a law mandating certain insurer-provider relationships fails to "regulate insur-ance." Suppose a state law required all licensed attorneys
to participate in 10 hours of continuing legal education (CLE)each year. This statute "regulates" the practice of law--

2 Section 2 of the McCarran-Ferguson Act provides:
"(a) The business of insurance, and every person engaged therein, shall
be subject to the laws of the several States which relate to the regulation
or taxation of such business.

"(b) No Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose of regulating the
business of insurance, or which imposes a fee or tax upon such business,
unless such Act specifically relates to the business of insurance: Provided,
That after June 30, 1948, the Act of July 2, 1890, as amended, known as
the Sherman Act, and the Act of October 15, 1914, as amended, known as
the Clayton Act, and the Act of September 26, 1914, known as the Federal
Trade Commission Act, as amended, shall be applicable to the business of
insurance to the extent that such business is not regulated by State law."
59 Stat. 34, 15 U. S. C. $ 1012 (emphasis added).

538US2 Unit: $U38 [10-26-04 16:53:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN
338 KENTUCKY ASSN. OF HEALTH PLANS, INC. v. MILLER

Opinion of the Court
even though sitting through 10 hours of CLE classes doesnot constitute the practice of law--because the State has

conditioned the right to practice law on certain require-ments, which substantially affect the product delivered by
lawyers to their clients. Kentucky's AWP laws operate in asimilar manner with respect to the insurance industry: Those
who wish to provide health insurance in Kentucky (any
"health insurer") may not discriminate against any willingprovider. This "regulates" insurance by imposing conditions on the right to engage in the business of insurance;whether or not an HMO's contracts with providers constitute
"the business of insurance" under Royal Drug is beside the
point.

We emphasize that conditions on the right to engage in the
business of insurance must also substantially affect the risk
pooling arrangement between the insurer and the insured to
be covered by ERISA's saving clause. Otherwise, any state
law aimed at insurance companies could be deemed a law
that "regulates insurance," contrary to our interpretation of

$ 1144(b)(2)(A) in Rush Prudential, 536 U. S., at 364. A
state law requiring all insurance companies to pay their janitors twice the minimum wage would not "regulate insurance," even though it would be a prerequisite to engaging in
the business of insurance, because it does not substantially
affect the risk pooling arrangement undertaken by insurer
and insured. Petitioners contend that Kentucky's AWP
statutes fail this test as well, since they do not alter or affect
the terms of insurance policies, but concern only the relationship between insureds and third-party providers, Brief for
Petitioners 29. We disagree. We have never held that
state laws must alter or control the actual terms of insurance
policies to be deemed "laws . . . which regulat[e] insurance"
under $ 1144(b)(2)(A); it suffices that they substantially affect
the risk pooling arrangement between insurer and insured.
By expanding the number of providers from whom an insured may receive health services, AWP laws alter the scope

339Cite as: 538 U. S. 329 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
of permissible bargains between insurers and insureds in amanner similar to the mandated-benefit laws we upheld in

Metropolitan Life, the notice-prejudice rule we sustainedin UNUM,

3 and the independent-review provisions we approved in Rush Prudential. No longer may Kentucky in-sureds seek insurance from a closed network of health-care

providers in exchange for a lower premium. The AWP pro-hibition substantially affects the type of risk pooling arrangements that insurers may offer.

III
Our prior decisions construing $ 1144(b)(2)(A) have relied,to varying degrees, on our cases interpreting $$ 2(a) and 2(b)

of the McCarran-Ferguson Act. In determining whethercertain practices constitute "the business of insurance"
under the McCarran-Ferguson Act (emphasis added), ourcases have looked to three factors: "first, whether the practice has the effect of transferring or spreading a policyhold-er's risk; second, whether the practice is an integral part of
the policy relationship between the insurer and the insured;and third, whether the practice is limited to entities within
the insurance industry." Pireno, 458 U. S., at 129.We believe that our use of the McCarran-Ferguson case
law in the ERISA context has misdirected attention, failed

3 While the Ninth Circuit concluded in Cisneros v. UNUM Life Ins. Co.
of America, 134 F. 3d 939, 945-946 (1998), aff'd in part, rev'd and remanded in part, UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America v. Ward, 526 U. S. 358
(1999), that "the notice-prejudice rule does not spread the policyholder's
risk within the meaning of the first McCarran-Ferguson factor," our test
requires only that the state law substantially affect the risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and insured; it does not require that the
state law actually spread risk. See supra, at 337-338. The noticeprejudice rule governs whether or not an insurance company must cover
claims submitted late, which dictates to the insurance company the conditions under which it must pay for the risk that it has assumed. This
certainly qualifies as a substantial effect on the risk pooling arrangement
between the insurer and insured.

Opinion of the Court
to provide clear guidance to lower federal courts, and, asthis case demonstrates, added little to the relevant analysis. That is unsurprising, since the statutory languageof $ 1144(b)(2)(A) differs substantially from that of the
McCarran-Ferguson Act. Rather than concerning itselfwith whether certain practices constitute "[t]he business of
insurance," 15 U. S. C. $ 1012(a), or whether a state law
was "enacted . . . for the purpose of regulating the busi-ness of insurance," $ 1012(b) (emphasis added), 29 U. S. C.

$ 1144(b)(2)(A) asks merely whether a state law is a "law . . .which regulates insurance, banking, or securities." What is
more, the McCarran-Ferguson factors were developed in
cases that characterized conduct by private actors, not state
laws. See Pireno, supra, at 126 ("The only issue before us is
whether petitioners' peer review practices are exempt from
antitrust scrutiny as part of the `business of insurance' " (emphasis added)); Royal Drug, 440 U. S., at 210 ("The only issue
before us is whether the Court of Appeals was correct in
concluding that these Pharmacy Agreements are not the
`business of insurance' within the meaning of $ 2(b) of the
McCarran-Ferguson Act" (emphasis added)).

Our holdings in UNUM and Rush Prudential--that a
state law may fail the first McCarran-Ferguson factor yet
still be saved from pre-emption under $ 1144(b)(2)(A)--raise
more questions than they answer and provide wide opportunities for divergent outcomes. May a state law satisfy any
two of the three McCarran-Ferguson factors and still fall
under the saving clause? Just one? What happens if two
of three factors are satisfied, but not "securely satisfied" or
"clearly satisfied," as they were in UNUM and Rush Prudential? 526 U. S., at 374; 536 U. S., at 373. Further confusion arises from the question whether the state law itself or
the conduct regulated by that law is the proper subject to
which one applies the McCarran-Ferguson factors. In Pilot
Life, we inquired whether Mississippi's law of bad faith has
the effect of transferring or spreading risk, 481 U. S., at 50,

538US2 Unit: $U38 [10-26-04 16:53:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

341Cite as: 538 U. S. 329 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
whether that law is integral to the insurer-insured relation-ship, id., at 51, and whether that law is limited to the insurance industry, ibid.4 Rush Prudential, by contrast, focusedthe McCarran-Ferguson inquiry on the conduct regulated by
the state law, rather than the state law itself. 536 U. S.,at 373 ("It is obvious enough that the independent review
requirement regulates `an integral part of the policy relation-ship between the insurer and insured' " (emphasis added));
id., at 374 ("The final factor, that the law be aimed at a `practice . . . limited to entities within the insurance industry' issatisfied . . ." (emphasis added; citation omitted)).

We have never held that the McCarran-Ferguson factorsare an essential component of the $ 1144(b)(2)(A) inquiry.
Metropolitan Life initially used these factors only to but-tress its previously reached conclusion that Massachusetts'
mandated-benefit statute was a "law . . . which regulatesinsurance" under $ 1144(b)(2)(A). 471 U. S., at 742-743.
Pilot Life referred to them as mere "considerations [to be]weighed" in determining whether a state law falls under the
saving clause. 481 U. S., at 49. UNUM emphasized thatthe McCarran-Ferguson factors were not " `require[d]' " in
the saving clause analysis, and were only "checking points"to be used after determining whether the state law regulates
insurance from a "common-sense" understanding. 526 U. S.,at 374. And

Rush Prudential called the factors "guide-posts," using them only to "confirm our conclusion" that Illinois' statute regulated insurance under $ 1144(b)(2)(A). 536U. S., at 373.

Today we make a clean break from the McCarran-Ferguson factors and hold that for a state law to be deemed
a "law . . . which regulates insurance" under $ 1144(b)(2)(A),

4 This approach rendered the third McCarran-Ferguson factor a mere
repetition of the prior inquiry into whether a state law is "specifically
directed toward" the insurance industry under the "common-sense view."

it must satisfy two requirements. First, the state law mustbe specifically directed toward entities engaged in insurance.

See Pilot Life, supra, at 50, UNUM, supra, at 368; RushPrudential, supra, at 366. Second, as explained above, the
state law must substantially affect the risk pooling arrange-ment between the insurer and the insured. Kentucky's law
satisfies each of these requirements.

VIRGINIA v. BLACK et al.
certiorari to the supreme court of virginia
No. 01-1107. Argued December 11, 2002--Decided April 7, 2003
Respondents were convicted separately of violating a Virginia statute that

makes it a felony "for any person . . . , with the intent of intimidating
any person or group . . . , to burn . . . a cross on the property of another,
a highway or other public place," and specifies that "[a]ny such burning
. . . shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to intimidate a person
or group." When respondent Black objected on First Amendment
grounds to his trial court's jury instruction that cross burning by itself
is sufficient evidence from which the required "intent to intimidate"
could be inferred, the prosecutor responded that the instruction was
taken straight out of the Virginia Model Instructions. Respondent
O'Mara pleaded guilty to charges of violating the statute, but reserved
the right to challenge its constitutionality. At respondent Elliott's trial,
the judge instructed the jury as to what the Commonwealth had to
prove, but did not give an instruction on the meaning of the word "intimidate," nor on the statute's prima facie evidence provision. Consolidating all three cases, the Virginia Supreme Court held that the crossburning statute is unconstitutional on its face; that it is analytically
indistinguishable from the ordinance found unconstitutional in R. A. V.
v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377; that it discriminates on the basis of content
and viewpoint since it selectively chooses only cross burning because of
its distinctive message; and that the prima facie evidence provision renders the statute overbroad because the enhanced probability of prosecution under the statute chills the expression of protected speech.

Held: The judgment is affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.
262 Va. 764, 553 S. E. 2d 738, affirmed in part, vacated in part, and

remanded.

Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court with respect
to Parts I, II, and III, concluding that a State, consistent with the First
Amendment, may ban cross burning carried out with the intent to intimidate. Pp. 352-363.

(a) Burning a cross in the United States is inextricably intertwined
with the history of the Ku Klux Klan, which, following its formation in
1866, imposed a reign of terror throughout the South, whipping, threatening, and murdering blacks, southern whites who disagreed with the
Klan, and "carpetbagger" northern whites. The Klan has often used
cross burnings as a tool of intimidation and a threat of impending vio538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
lence, although such burnings have also remained potent symbols of
shared group identity and ideology, serving as a central feature of Klan
gatherings. To this day, however, regardless of whether the message
is a political one or is also meant to intimidate, the burning of a cross is
a "symbol of hate." Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, 771. While cross burning does not inevitably
convey a message of intimidation, often the cross burner intends that
the recipients of the message fear for their lives. And when a cross
burning is used to intimidate, few if any messages are more powerful.
Pp. 352-357.

(b) The protections the First Amendment affords speech and expressive conduct are not absolute. This Court has long recognized that the
government may regulate certain categories of expression consistent
with the Constitution. See, e. g., Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315
U. S. 568, 571-572. For example, the First Amendment permits a State
to ban "true threats," e. g., Watts v. United States, 394 U. S. 705, 708
(per curiam), which encompass those statements where the speaker
means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an
act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals,
see, e. g., ibid. The speaker need not actually intend to carry out the
threat. Rather, a prohibition on true threats protects individuals from
the fear of violence and the disruption that fear engenders, as well as
from the possibility that the threatened violence will occur. R. A. V.,
supra, at 388. Intimidation in the constitutionally proscribable sense
of the word is a type of true threat, where a speaker directs a threat to
a person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in
fear of bodily harm or death. Respondents do not contest that some
cross burnings fit within this meaning of intimidating speech, and
rightly so. As the history of cross burning in this country shows, that
act is often intimidating, intended to create a pervasive fear in victims
that they are a target of violence. Pp. 358-360.

(c) The First Amendment permits Virginia to outlaw cross burnings
done with the intent to intimidate because burning a cross is a particularly virulent form of intimidation. Instead of prohibiting all intimidating messages, Virginia may choose to regulate this subset of intimidating messages in light of cross burning's long and pernicious history as
a signal of impending violence. A ban on cross burning carried out
with the intent to intimidate is fully consistent with this Court's holding
in R. A. V. Contrary to the Virginia Supreme Court's ruling, R. A. V.
did not hold that the First Amendment prohibits all forms of contentbased discrimination within a proscribable area of speech. Rather, the
Court specifically stated that a particular type of content discrimination
does not violate the First Amendment when the basis for it consists

Syllabus
entirely of the very reason its entire class of speech is proscribable.
505 U. S., at 388. For example, it is permissible to prohibit only that
obscenity that is most patently offensive in its prurience--i. e., that
which involves the most lascivious displays of sexual activity. Ibid.
Similarly, Virginia's statute does not run afoul of the First Amendment
insofar as it bans cross burning with intent to intimidate. Unlike the
statute at issue in R. A. V., the Virginia statute does not single out
for opprobrium only that speech directed toward "one of the specified
disfavored topics." Id., at 391. It does not matter whether an individual burns a cross with intent to intimidate because of the victim's race,
gender, or religion, or because of the victim's "political affiliation, union
membership, or homosexuality." Ibid. Thus, just as a State may regulate only that obscenity which is the most obscene due to its prurient
content, so too may a State choose to prohibit only those forms of intimidation that are most likely to inspire fear of bodily harm. Pp. 360-363.

Justice O'Connor, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Stevens, and Justice Breyer, concluded in Parts IV and V that the Virginia statute's prima facie evidence provision, as interpreted through
the jury instruction given in respondent Black's case and as applied
therein, is unconstitutional on its face. Because the instruction is the
same as the Commonwealth's Model Jury Instruction, and because the
Virginia Supreme Court had the opportunity to expressly disavow it,
the instruction's construction of the prima facie provision is as binding
on this Court as if its precise words had been written into the statute.
E. g., Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U. S. 1, 4. As construed by the instruction, the prima facie provision strips away the very reason why a
State may ban cross burning with the intent to intimidate. The provision permits a jury to convict in every cross burning case in which defendants exercise their constitutional right not to put on a defense.
And even where a defendant like Black presents a defense, the provision
makes it more likely that the jury will find an intent to intimidate regardless of the particular facts of the case. It permits the Commonwealth to arrest, prosecute, and convict a person based solely on the
fact of cross burning itself. As so interpreted, it would create an unacceptable risk of the suppression of ideas. E. g., Secretary of State of
Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U. S. 947, 965, n. 13. The act of
burning a cross may mean that a person is engaging in constitutionally
proscribable intimidation, or it may mean only that the person is engaged in core political speech. The prima facie evidence provision blurs
the line between these meanings, ignoring all of the contextual factors
that are necessary to decide whether a particular cross burning is intended to intimidate. The First Amendment does not permit such a
shortcut. Thus, Black's conviction cannot stand, and the judgment as

Syllabus
to him is affirmed. Conversely, Elliott's jury did not receive any instruction on the prima facie provision, and the provision was not an
issue in O'Mara's case because he pleaded guilty. The possibility that
the provision is severable, and if so, whether Elliott and O'Mara could be
retried under the statute, is left open. Also left open is the theoretical
possibility that, on remand, the Virginia Supreme Court could interpret
the prima facie provision in a manner that would avoid the constitutional
objections described above. Pp. 363-368.

Justice Scalia agreed that this Court should vacate and remand the
judgment of the Virginia Supreme Court with respect to respondents
Elliott and O'Mara so that that court can have an opportunity authoritatively to construe the cross-burning statute's prima-facie-evidence provision. Pp. 368, 379.

Justice Souter, joined by Justice Kennedy and Justice Ginsburg, concluded that the Virginia statute is unconstitutional and cannot be saved by any exception under R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377,
and therefore concurred in the Court's judgment insofar as it affirms
the invalidation of respondent Black's conviction. Pp. 380-381, 387.

348 VIRGINIA v. BLACK

Opinion of the Court
cross burning as prima facie evidence of intent to intimidaterenders the statute unconstitutional in its current form.

I
Respondents Barry Black, Richard Elliott, and JonathanO'Mara were convicted separately of violating Virginia's

cross-burning statute, $ 18.2-423. That statute provides:

"It shall be unlawful for any person or persons, withthe intent of intimidating any person or group of persons, to burn, or cause to be burned, a cross on the prop-erty of another, a highway or other public place. Any
person who shall violate any provision of this sectionshall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.

"Any such burning of a cross shall be prima facie evi-dence of an intent to intimidate a person or group of
persons."
On August 22, 1998, Barry Black led a Ku Klux Klan rallyin Carroll County, Virginia. Twenty-five to thirty people attended this gathering, which occurred on private propertywith the permission of the owner, who was in attendance.
The property was located on an open field just off BrushyFork Road (State Highway 690) in Cana, Virginia.

When the sheriff of Carroll County learned that a Klanrally was occurring in his county, he went to observe it from
the side of the road. During the approximately one hourthat the sheriff was present, about 40 to 50 cars passed the
site, a "few" of which stopped to ask the sheriff what washappening on the property. App. 71. Eight to ten houses
were located in the vicinity of the rally. Rebecca Sechrist,who was related to the owner of the property where the rally
took place, "sat and watched to see wha[t] [was] going on"from the lawn of her in-laws' house. She looked on as the
Klan prepared for the gathering and subsequently conductedthe rally itself. Id., at 103.

During the rally, Sechrist heard Klan members speakabout "what they were" and "what they believed in."

Id.,

Opinion of the Court
at 106. The speakers "talked real bad about the blacks andthe Mexicans."

Id., at 109. One speaker told the assembled gathering that "he would love to take a .30/.30 and justrandom[ly] shoot the blacks."

Ibid. The speakers also
talked about "President Clinton and Hillary Clinton," andabout how their tax money "goes to . . . the black people."

Ibid. Sechrist testified that this language made her "very
. . . scared." Id., at 110.At the conclusion of the rally, the crowd circled around a

25- to 30-foot cross. The cross was between 300 and 350yards away from the road. According to the sheriff, the
cross "then all of a sudden . . . went up in a flame." Id.,
at 71. As the cross burned, the Klan played Amazing Grace
over the loudspeakers. Sechrist stated that the cross burning made her feel "awful" and "terrible." Id., at 110.

When the sheriff observed the cross burning, he informed
his deputy that they needed to "find out who's responsible
and explain to them that they cannot do this in the State
of Virginia." Id., at 72. The sheriff then went down the
driveway, entered the rally, and asked "who was responsible for burning the cross." Id., at 74. Black responded,
"I guess I am because I'm the head of the rally." Ibid. The
sheriff then told Black, "[T]here's a law in the State of Virginia that you cannot burn a cross and I'll have to place you
under arrest for this." Ibid.

Black was charged with burning a cross with the intent
of intimidating a person or group of persons, in violation of

$ 18.2-423. At his trial, the jury was instructed that "intent
to intimidate means the motivation to intentionally put a
person or a group of persons in fear of bodily harm. Such
fear must arise from the willful conduct of the accused rather
than from some mere temperamental timidity of the victim."
Id., at 146. The trial court also instructed the jury that "the
burning of a cross by itself is sufficient evidence from which
you may infer the required intent." Ibid. When Black objected to this last instruction on First Amendment grounds,

Opinion of the Court
the prosecutor responded that the instruction was "takenstraight out of the [Virginia] Model Instructions."

Id., at
134. The jury found Black guilty, and fined him $2,500.The Court of Appeals of Virginia affirmed Black's conviction.

Rec. No. 1581-99-3 (Va. App., Dec. 19, 2000), App. 201.On May 2, 1998, respondents Richard Elliott and Jonathan
O'Mara, as well as a third individual, attempted to burn
a cross on the yard of James Jubilee. Jubilee, an African-American, was Elliott's next-door neighbor in Virginia

Beach, Virginia. Four months prior to the incident, Jubileeand his family had moved from California to Virginia Beach.
Before the cross burning, Jubilee spoke to Elliott's mother
to inquire about shots being fired from behind the Elliott
home. Elliott's mother explained to Jubilee that her son
shot firearms as a hobby, and that he used the backyard as a
firing range.

On the night of May 2, respondents drove a truck onto
Jubilee's property, planted a cross, and set it on fire. Their
apparent motive was to "get back" at Jubilee for complaining
about the shooting in the backyard. Id., at 241. Respondents were not affiliated with the Klan. The next morning,
as Jubilee was pulling his car out of the driveway, he noticed
the partially burned cross approximately 20 feet from his
house. After seeing the cross, Jubilee was "very nervous"
because he "didn't know what would be the next phase," and
because "a cross burned in your yard . . . tells you that it's
just the first round." Id., at 231.

Elliott and O'Mara were charged with attempted cross
burning and conspiracy to commit cross burning. O'Mara
pleaded guilty to both counts, reserving the right to challenge the constitutionality of the cross-burning statute.
The judge sentenced O'Mara to 90 days in jail and fined him
$2,500. The judge also suspended 45 days of the sentence
and $1,000 of the fine.

At Elliott's trial, the judge originally ruled that the jury
would be instructed "that the burning of a cross by itself is

Opinion of the Court
sufficient evidence from which you may infer the requiredintent."

Id., at 221-222. At trial, however, the court instructed the jury that the Commonwealth must prove that"the defendant intended to commit cross burning," that "the

defendant did a direct act toward the commission of the crossburning," and that "the defendant had the intent of intimidating any person or group of persons." Id., at 250. The
court did not instruct the jury on the meaning of the word"intimidate," nor on the prima facie evidence provision of

$ 18.2-423. The jury found Elliott guilty of attempted crossburning and acquitted him of conspiracy to commit cross
burning. It sentenced Elliott to 90 days in jail and a $2,500
fine. The Court of Appeals of Virginia affirmed the convictions of both Elliott and O'Mara. O'Mara v. Commonwealth, 33 Va. App. 525, 535 S. E. 2d 175 (2000).

Each respondent appealed to the Supreme Court of Virginia, arguing that $ 18.2-423 is facially unconstitutional.
The Supreme Court of Virginia consolidated all three cases,
and held that the statute is unconstitutional on its face. 262
Va. 764, 553 S. E. 2d 738 (2001). It held that the Virginia
cross-burning statute "is analytically indistinguishable from
the ordinance found unconstitutional in R. A. V. [v. St. Paul,
505 U. S. 377 (1992)]." Id., at 772, 553 S. E. 2d, at 742. The
Virginia statute, the court held, discriminates on the basis of
content since it "selectively chooses only cross burning because of its distinctive message." Id., at 774, 553 S. E. 2d,
at 744. The court also held that the prima facie evidence
provision renders the statute overbroad because "[t]he enhanced probability of prosecution under the statute chills the
expression of protected speech." Id., at 777, 553 S. E. 2d,
at 746.

Three justices dissented, concluding that the Virginia
cross-burning statute passes constitutional muster because it
proscribes only conduct that constitutes a true threat. The
justices noted that unlike the ordinance found unconstitutional in R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377 (1992), the Virginia

statute does not just target cross burning "on the basis ofrace, color, creed, religion or gender." 262 Va., at 791, 553

S. E. 2d, at 753. Rather, "the Virginia statute applies toany individual who burns a cross for any reason provided the
cross is burned with the intent to intimidate." Ibid. Thedissenters also disagreed with the majority's analysis of the
prima facie provision because the inference alone "is clearlyinsufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant burned a cross with the intent to intimidate." Id.,at 795, 553 S. E. 2d, at 756. The dissent noted that the burden of proof still remains on the Commonwealth to proveintent to intimidate. We granted certiorari. 535 U. S.
1094 (2002).1 II

Cross burning originated in the 14th century as a meansfor Scottish tribes to signal each other. See M. Newton &
J. Newton, The Ku Klux Klan: An Encyclopedia 145 (1991).Sir Walter Scott used cross burnings for dramatic effect in
The Lady of the Lake, where the burning cross signified botha summons and a call to arms. See W. Scott, The Lady of
The Lake, canto third. Cross burning in this country, how-ever, long ago became unmoored from its Scottish ancestry.
Burning a cross in the United States is inextricably inter-twined with the history of the Ku Klux Klan.

The first Ku Klux Klan began in Pulaski, Tennessee, in thespring of 1866. Although the Ku Klux Klan started as a
social club, it soon changed into something far different.The Klan fought Reconstruction and the corresponding drive
to allow freed blacks to participate in the political process.

1 After we granted certiorari, the Commonwealth enacted another statute designed to remedy the constitutional problems identified by the state
court. See Va. Code Ann. $ 18.2-423.01 (2002). Section 18.2-423.01 bans
the burning of "an object" when done "with the intent of intimidating any
person or group of persons." The statute does not contain any prima
facie evidence provision. Section 18.2-423.01, however, did not repeal

$ 18.2-423, the cross-burning statute at issue in this case.

Opinion of the Court
Soon the Klan imposed "a veritable reign of terror" through-out the South. S. Kennedy, Southern Exposure 31 (1991)

(hereinafter Kennedy). The Klan employed tactics such aswhipping, threatening to burn people at the stake, and murder. W. Wade, The Fiery Cross: The Ku Klux Klan inAmerica 48-49 (1987) (hereinafter Wade). The Klan's victims included blacks, southern whites who disagreed with
the Klan, and "carpetbagger" northern whites.The activities of the Ku Klux Klan prompted legislative

action at the national level. In 1871, "President Grant senta message to Congress indicating that the Klan's reign of
terror in the Southern States had rendered life and property
insecure." Jett v. Dallas Independent School Dist., 491
U. S. 701, 722 (1989) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). In response, Congress passed what is now
known as the Ku Klux Klan Act. See "An Act to enforce
the Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and for other Purposes," 17 Stat.
13 (now codified at 42 U. S. C. $$ 1983, 1985, and 1986). President Grant used these new powers to suppress the Klan in
South Carolina, the effect of which severely curtailed the
Klan in other States as well. By the end of Reconstruction
in 1877, the first Klan no longer existed.

The genesis of the second Klan began in 1905, with the
publication of Thomas Dixon's The Clansmen: An Historical
Romance of the Ku Klux Klan. Dixon's book was a sympathetic portrait of the first Klan, depicting the Klan as a group
of heroes "saving" the South from blacks and the "horrors"
of Reconstruction. Although the first Klan never actually
practiced cross burning, Dixon's book depicted the Klan
burning crosses to celebrate the execution of former slaves.
Id., at 324-326; see also Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, 770-771 (1995) (Thomas,
J., concurring). Cross burning thereby became associated
with the first Ku Klux Klan. When D. W. Griffith turned
Dixon's book into the movie The Birth of a Nation in 1915,

538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN
354 VIRGINIA v. BLACK

Opinion of the Court
the association between cross burning and the Klan becameindelible. In addition to the cross burnings in the movie,

a poster advertising the film displayed a hooded Klansmanriding a hooded horse, with his left hand holding the reins
of the horse and his right hand holding a burning cross abovehis head. Wade 127. Soon thereafter, in November 1915,
the second Klan began.

From the inception of the second Klan, cross burningshave been used to communicate both threats of violence and

messages of shared ideology. The first initiation ceremonyoccurred on Stone Mountain near Atlanta, Georgia. While
a 40-foot cross burned on the mountain, the Klan members
took their oaths of loyalty. See Kennedy 163. This cross
burning was the second recorded instance in the United
States. The first known cross burning in the country had
occurred a little over one month before the Klan initiation,
when a Georgia mob celebrated the lynching of Leo Frank
by burning a "gigantic cross" on Stone Mountain that was
"visible throughout" Atlanta. Wade 144 (internal quotation
marks omitted).

The new Klan's ideology did not differ much from that of
the first Klan. As one Klan publication emphasized, "We
avow the distinction between [the] races, . . . and we shall
ever be true to the faithful maintenance of White Supremacy
and will strenuously oppose any compromise thereof in any
and all things." Id., at 147-148 (internal quotation marks
omitted). Violence was also an elemental part of this new
Klan. By September 1921, the New York World newspaper
documented 152 acts of Klan violence, including 4 murders,
41 floggings, and 27 tar-and-featherings. Wade 160.

Often, the Klan used cross burnings as a tool of intimidation and a threat of impending violence. For example, in
1939 and 1940, the Klan burned crosses in front of synagogues and churches. See Kennedy 175. After one cross
burning at a synagogue, a Klan member noted that if the
cross burning did not "shut the Jews up, we'll cut a few

Opinion of the Court
throats and see what happens." Ibid. (internal quotationmarks omitted). In Miami in 1941, the Klan burned four

crosses in front of a proposed housing project, declaring, "Weare here to keep niggers out of your town . . . . When the
law fails you, call on us." Id., at 176 (internal quotationmarks omitted). And in Alabama in 1942, in "a whirlwind
climax to weeks of flogging and terror," the Klan burned
crosses in front of a union hall and in front of a union leader'shome on the eve of a labor election.

Id., at 180. These
cross burnings embodied threats to people whom the Klandeemed antithetical to its goals. And these threats had special force given the long history of Klan violence.

The Klan continued to use cross burnings to intimidate
after World War II. In one incident, an African-American
"school teacher who recently moved his family into a block
formerly occupied only by whites asked the protection of city
police . . . after the burning of a cross in his front yard."
Richmond News Leader, Jan. 21, 1949, p. 19, App. 312. And
after a cross burning in Suffolk, Virginia, during the late
1940's, the Virginia Governor stated that he would "not allow
any of our people of any race to be subjected to terrorism or
intimidation in any form by the Klan or any other organization." D. Chalmers, Hooded Americanism: The History of
the Ku Klux Klan 333 (1980) (hereinafter Chalmers). These
incidents of cross burning, among others, helped prompt Virginia to enact its first version of the cross-burning statute
in 1950.

The decision of this Court in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), along with the civil rights
movement of the 1950's and 1960's, sparked another outbreak of Klan violence. These acts of violence included
bombings, beatings, shootings, stabbings, and mutilations.
See, e. g., Chalmers 349-350; Wade 302-303. Members of
the Klan burned crosses on the lawns of those associated
with the civil rights movement, assaulted the Freedom Riders, bombed churches, and murdered blacks as well as whites

Opinion of the Court
whom the Klan viewed as sympathetic toward the civilrights movement.

Throughout the history of the Klan, cross burnings havealso remained potent symbols of shared group identity and
ideology. The burning cross became a symbol of the Klanitself and a central feature of Klan gatherings. According
to the Klan constitution (called the kloran), the "fiery cross"
was the "emblem of that sincere, unselfish devotedness ofall klansmen to the sacred purpose and principles we have

espoused." The Ku Klux Klan Hearings before the HouseCommittee on Rules, 67th Cong., 1st Sess., 114, Exh. G
(1921); see also Wade 419. And the Klan has often published
its newsletters and magazines under the name The Fiery
Cross. See id., at 226, 489.

At Klan gatherings across the country, cross burning
became the climax of the rally or the initiation. Posters
advertising an upcoming Klan rally often featured a Klan
member holding a cross. See N. MacLean, Behind the Mask
of Chivalry: The Making of the Second Ku Klux Klan 142-
143 (1994). Typically, a cross burning would start with a
prayer by the "Klavern" minister, followed by the singing of
Onward Christian Soldiers. The Klan would then light the
cross on fire, as the members raised their left arm toward
the burning cross and sang The Old Rugged Cross. Wade
185. Throughout the Klan's history, the Klan continued to
use the burning cross in their ritual ceremonies.

For its own members, the cross was a sign of celebration
and ceremony. During a joint Nazi-Klan rally in 1940, the
proceeding concluded with the wedding of two Klan members who "were married in full Klan regalia beneath a blazing cross." Id., at 271. In response to antimasking bills
introduced in state legislatures after World War II, the Klan
burned crosses in protest. See Chalmers 340. On March
26, 1960, the Klan engaged in rallies and cross burnings
throughout the South in an attempt to recruit 10 million
members. See Wade 305. Later in 1960, the Klan became

Opinion of the Court
an issue in the third debate between Richard Nixon and John
Kennedy, with both candidates renouncing the Klan. After
this debate, the Klan reiterated its support for Nixon by
burning crosses. See id., at 309. And cross burnings featured prominently in Klan rallies when the Klan attempted
to move toward more nonviolent tactics to stop integration.
See id., at 323; cf. Chalmers 368-369, 371-372, 380, 384. In
short, a burning cross has remained a symbol of Klan ideology and of Klan unity.

To this day, regardless of whether the message is a political one or whether the message is also meant to intimidate,
the burning of a cross is a "symbol of hate." Capitol Square
Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S., at 771
(Thomas, J., concurring). And while cross burning sometimes carries no intimidating message, at other times the
intimidating message is the only message conveyed. For
example, when a cross burning is directed at a particular
person not affiliated with the Klan, the burning cross often
serves as a message of intimidation, designed to inspire in
the victim a fear of bodily harm. Moreover, the history of
violence associated with the Klan shows that the possibility
of injury or death is not just hypothetical. The person who
burns a cross directed at a particular person often is making a serious threat, meant to coerce the victim to comply
with the Klan's wishes unless the victim is willing to risk
the wrath of the Klan. Indeed, as the cases of respondents
Elliott and O'Mara indicate, individuals without Klan affiliation who wish to threaten or menace another person sometimes use cross burning because of this association between
a burning cross and violence.

In sum, while a burning cross does not inevitably convey
a message of intimidation, often the cross burner intends
that the recipients of the message fear for their lives. And
when a cross burning is used to intimidate, few if any messages are more powerful.

358 VIRGINIA v. BLACK

Opinion of the Court

III

A

The First Amendment, applicable to the States through
the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that "Congress shall
make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech." The
hallmark of the protection of free speech is to allow "free
trade in ideas"--even ideas that the overwhelming majority
of people might find distasteful or discomforting. Abrams
v. United States, 250 U. S. 616, 630 (1919) (Holmes, J., dissenting); see also Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 414 (1989) ("If
there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself
offensive or disagreeable"). Thus, the First Amendment
"ordinarily" denies a State "the power to prohibit dissemination of social, economic and political doctrine which a vast
majority of its citizens believes to be false and fraught with
evil consequence." Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357,
374 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring). The First Amendment
affords protection to symbolic or expressive conduct as well
as to actual speech. See, e. g., R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul,
505 U. S., at 382; Texas v. Johnson, supra, at 405-406; United
States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 376-377 (1968); Tinker v.
Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U. S.
503, 505 (1969).

The protections afforded by the First Amendment, however, are not absolute, and we have long recognized that
the government may regulate certain categories of expression consistent with the Constitution. See, e. g., Chaplinsky
v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568, 571-572 (1942) ("There are
certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech,
the prevention and punishment of which has never been
thought to raise any Constitutional problem"). The First
Amendment permits "restrictions upon the content of speech
in a few limited areas, which are `of such slight social value

538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived fromthem is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order

and morality.' " R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul, supra, at 382-383 (quoting

Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, supra, at 572).
Thus, for example, a State may punish those words "whichby their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an

immediate breach of the peace." Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, supra, at 572; see also R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul,
supra, at 383 (listing limited areas where the First Amendment permits restrictions on the content of speech). Wehave consequently held that fighting words--"those personally abusive epithets which, when addressed to the ordinary
citizen, are, as a matter of common knowledge, inherently
likely to provoke violent reaction"--are generally proscribable under the First Amendment. Cohen v. California, 403
U. S. 15, 20 (1971); see also Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,
supra, at 572. Furthermore, "the constitutional guarantees
of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid
or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation
except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce
such action." Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444, 447 (1969)
(per curiam). And the First Amendment also permits a
State to ban a "true threat." Watts v. United States, 394
U. S. 705, 708 (1969) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks
omitted); accord, R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul, supra, at 388
("[T]hreats of violence are outside the First Amendment");
Madsen v. Women's Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S. 753, 774
(1994); Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network of Western N. Y., 519
U. S. 357, 373 (1997).

"True threats" encompass those statements where the
speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an
intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular
individual or group of individuals. See Watts v. United
States, supra, at 708 ("political hyberbole" is not a true
threat); R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U. S., at 388. The

Opinion of the Court
speaker need not actually intend to carry out the threat.Rather, a prohibition on true threats "protect[s] individuals

from the fear of violence" and "from the disruption that fearengenders," in addition to protecting people "from the possibility that the threatened violence will occur." Ibid. In-timidation in the constitutionally proscribable sense of the
word is a type of true threat, where a speaker directs athreat to a person or group of persons with the intent of
placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death. Respond-ents do not contest that some cross burnings fit within this
meaning of intimidating speech, and rightly so. As notedin Part II,

supra, the history of cross burning in this coun-try shows that cross burning is often intimidating, intended

to create a pervasive fear in victims that they are a targetof violence.

B
The Supreme Court of Virginia ruled that in light of
R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul, supra, even if it is constitutionalto ban cross burning in a content-neutral manner, the Virginia cross-burning statute is unconstitutional because itdiscriminates on the basis of content and viewpoint. 262
Va., at 771-776, 553 S. E. 2d, at 742-745. It is true, as theSupreme Court of Virginia held, that the burning of a cross
is symbolic expression. The reason why the Klan burns across at its rallies, or individuals place a burning cross on
someone else's lawn, is that the burning cross representsthe message that the speaker wishes to communicate. Individuals burn crosses as opposed to other means of communi-cation because cross burning carries a message in an effective and dramatic manner.2

2 Justice Thomas argues in dissent that cross burning is "conduct, not
expression." Post, at 394. While it is of course true that burning a cross
is conduct, it is equally true that the First Amendment protects symbolic
conduct as well as pure speech. See supra, at 358. As Justice Thomas
has previously recognized, a burning cross is a "symbol of hate," and a

538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

361Cite as: 538 U. S. 343 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
The fact that cross burning is symbolic expression, how-ever, does not resolve the constitutional question. The Supreme Court of Virginia relied upon R. A. V. v. City ofSt. Paul, supra, to conclude that once a statute discriminates
on the basis of this type of content, the law is unconstitu-tional. We disagree.

In R. A. V., we held that a local ordinance that bannedcertain symbolic conduct, including cross burning, when done
with the knowledge that such conduct would " `arouse anger,alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, color,
creed, religion or gender' " was unconstitutional. Id., at 380(quoting the St. Paul Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance,
St. Paul, Minn., Legis. Code $ 292.02 (1990)). We held that
the ordinance did not pass constitutional muster because itdiscriminated on the basis of content by targeting only those

individuals who "provoke violence" on a basis specified inthe law. 505 U. S., at 391. The ordinance did not cover
"[t]hose who wish to use `fighting words' in connection withother ideas--to express hostility, for example, on the basis
of political affiliation, union membership, or homosexuality."
Ibid. This content-based discrimination was unconstitu-tional because it allowed the city "to impose special prohibitions on those speakers who express views on disfavoredsubjects."

Ibid.
We did not hold in R. A. V. that the First Amendmentprohibits

all forms of content-based discrimination within a
proscribable area of speech. Rather, we specifically statedthat some types of content discrimination did not violate the

First Amendment:

"When the basis for the content discrimination consists
entirely of the very reason the entire class of speechat issue is proscribable, no significant danger of idea or

"a symbol of white supremacy." Capitol Square Review and Advisory
Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, 770-771 (1995) (concurring opinion).

538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN
362 VIRGINIA v. BLACK

Opinion of the Court
viewpoint discrimination exists. Such a reason, havingbeen adjudged neutral enough to support exclusion of

the entire class of speech from First Amendment protec-tion, is also neutral enough to form the basis of distinction within the class." Id., at 388.
Indeed, we noted that it would be constitutional to banonly a particular type of threat: "[T]he Federal Government

can criminalize only those threats of violence that aredirected against the President . . . since the reasons why
threats of violence are outside the First Amendment . . .have special force when applied to the person of the President." Ibid. And a State may "choose to prohibit only thatobscenity which is the most patently offensive in its prurience--i. e., that which involves the most lascivious displaysof sexual activity." Ibid. (emphasis in original). Consequently, while the holding of R. A. V. does not permit a Stateto ban only obscenity based on "offensive political messages," ibid., or "only those threats against the Presidentthat mention his policy on aid to inner cities," ibid., the First
Amendment permits content discrimination "based on thevery reasons why the particular class of speech at issue . . .
is proscribable," id., at 393.Similarly, Virginia's statute does not run afoul of the First
Amendment insofar as it bans cross burning with intent tointimidate. Unlike the statute at issue in

R. A. V., theVirginia statute does not single out for opprobrium only that

speech directed toward "one of the specified disfavoredtopics." Id., at 391. It does not matter whether an individual burns a cross with intent to intimidate because of thevictim's race, gender, or religion, or because of the victim's
"political affiliation, union membership, or homosexuality."Ibid. Moreover, as a factual matter it is not true that cross
burners direct their intimidating conduct solely to racial orreligious minorities. See, e. g., supra, at 355 (noting the instances of cross burnings directed at union members); Statev.

Miller, 6 Kan. App. 2d 432, 629 P. 2d 748 (1981) (describing

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
the case of a defendant who burned a cross in the yard ofthe lawyer who had previously represented him and who was

currently prosecuting him). Indeed, in the case of Elliottand O'Mara, it is at least unclear whether the respondents
burned a cross due to racial animus. See 262 Va., at 791, 553S. E. 2d, at 753 (Hassell, J., dissenting) (noting that "these
defendants burned a cross because they were angry thattheir neighbor had complained about the presence of a firearm shooting range in the Elliott's yard, not because of anyracial animus").

The First Amendment permits Virginia to outlaw crossburnings done with the intent to intimidate because burning
a cross is a particularly virulent form of intimidation. In-stead of prohibiting all intimidating messages, Virginia may
choose to regulate this subset of intimidating messages inlight of cross burning's long and pernicious history as a
signal of impending violence. Thus, just as a State may reg-ulate only that obscenity which is the most obscene due to
its prurient content, so too may a State choose to prohibitonly those forms of intimidation that are most likely to inspire fear of bodily harm. A ban on cross burning carriedout with the intent to intimidate is fully consistent with
our holding in R. A. V. and is proscribable under the FirstAmendment.

IV
The Supreme Court of Virginia ruled in the alternativethat Virginia's cross-burning statute was unconstitutionally

overbroad due to its provision stating that "[a]ny such burn-ing of a cross shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to
intimidate a person or group of persons." Va. Code Ann.$ 18.2-423 (1996). The Commonwealth added the prima
facie provision to the statute in 1968. The court below didnot reach whether this provision is severable from the rest of
the cross-burning statute under Virginia law. See $ 1-17.1("The provisions of all statutes are severable unless . . . it is

538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN
364 VIRGINIA v. BLACK

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
apparent that two or more statutes or provisions must oper-ate in accord with one another"). In this Court, as in the

Supreme Court of Virginia, respondents do not argue thatthe prima facie evidence provision is unconstitutional as applied to any one of them. Rather, they contend that theprovision is unconstitutional on its face.

The Supreme Court of Virginia has not ruled on the meaning of the prima facie evidence provision. It has, however,stated that "the act of burning a cross alone, with no evidence of intent to intimidate, will nonetheless suffice for ar-rest and prosecution and will insulate the Commonwealth
from a motion to strike the evidence at the end of its case-inchief." 262 Va., at 778, 553 S. E. 2d, at 746. The jury in
the case of Richard Elliott did not receive any instruction on
the prima facie evidence provision, and the provision was not
an issue in the case of Jonathan O'Mara because he pleaded
guilty. The court in Barry Black's case, however, instructed
the jury that the provision means: "The burning of a cross,
by itself, is sufficient evidence from which you may infer the
required intent." App. 196. This jury instruction is the
same as the Model Jury Instruction in the Commonwealth of
Virginia. See Virginia Model Jury Instructions, Criminal,
Instruction No. 10.250 (1998 and Supp. 2001).

The prima facie evidence provision, as interpreted by the
jury instruction, renders the statute unconstitutional. Because this jury instruction is the Model Jury Instruction, and
because the Supreme Court of Virginia had the opportunity
to expressly disavow the jury instruction, the jury instruction's construction of the prima facie provision "is a ruling
on a question of state law that is as binding on us as though
the precise words had been written into" the statute. E. g.,
Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U. S. 1, 4 (1949) (striking down
an ambiguous statute on facial grounds based upon the
instruction given to the jury); see also New York v. Ferber,
458 U. S. 747, 768, n. 21 (1982) (noting that Terminiello involved a facial challenge to the statute); Secretary of State

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U. S. 947, 965, n. 13(1984); Note, The First Amendment Overbreadth Doctrine,

83 Harv. L. Rev. 844, 845-846, n. 8 (1970); Monaghan, Over-breadth, 1981 S. Ct. Rev. 1, 10-12; Blakey & Murray, Threats,
Free Speech, and the Jurisprudence of the Federal CriminalLaw, 2002 B. Y. U. L. Rev. 829, 883, n. 133. As construed by
the jury instruction, the prima facie provision strips away
the very reason why a State may ban cross burning withthe intent to intimidate. The prima facie evidence provision

permits a jury to convict in every cross-burning case inwhich defendants exercise their constitutional right not to
put on a defense. And even where a defendant like Black
presents a defense, the prima facie evidence provision makes
it more likely that the jury will find an intent to intimidate
regardless of the particular facts of the case. The provision
permits the Commonwealth to arrest, prosecute, and convict
a person based solely on the fact of cross burning itself.

It is apparent that the provision as so interpreted " `would
create an unacceptable risk of the suppression of ideas.' "
Secretary of State of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., supra,
at 965, n. 13 (quoting Members of City Council of Los
Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U. S. 789, 797 (1984)).
The act of burning a cross may mean that a person is engaging in constitutionally proscribable intimidation. But that
same act may mean only that the person is engaged in core
political speech. The prima facie evidence provision in
this statute blurs the line between these two meanings of
a burning cross. As interpreted by the jury instruction, the
provision chills constitutionally protected political speech
because of the possibility that the Commonwealth will prosecute--and potentially convict--somebody engaging only in
lawful political speech at the core of what the First Amendment is designed to protect.

As the history of cross burning indicates, a burning cross
is not always intended to intimidate. Rather, sometimes the
cross burning is a statement of ideology, a symbol of group

538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN
366 VIRGINIA v. BLACK

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
solidarity. It is a ritual used at Klan gatherings, and it isused to represent the Klan itself. Thus, "[b]urning a cross

at a political rally would almost certainly be protected ex-pression."

R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S., at 402, n. 4 (White,
J., concurring in judgment) (citing Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395U. S., at 445). Cf.

National Socialist Party of America v.
Skokie, 432 U. S. 43 (1977) (per curiam). Indeed, occasionally a person who burns a cross does not intend to expresseither a statement of ideology or intimidation. Cross burnings have appeared in movies such as Mississippi Burning,and in plays such as the stage adaptation of Sir Walter
Scott's The Lady of the Lake.

The prima facie provision makes no effort to distinguish
among these different types of cross burnings. It does not
distinguish between a cross burning done with the purpose
of creating anger or resentment and a cross burning done
with the purpose of threatening or intimidating a victim. It
does not distinguish between a cross burning at a public rally
or a cross burning on a neighbor's lawn. It does not treat
the cross burning directed at an individual differently from
the cross burning directed at a group of like-minded believers. It allows a jury to treat a cross burning on the property of another with the owner's acquiescence in the same
manner as a cross burning on the property of another without the owner's permission. To this extent I agree with
Justice Souter that the prima facie evidence provision can
"skew jury deliberations toward conviction in cases where
the evidence of intent to intimidate is relatively weak and
arguably consistent with a solely ideological reason for burning." Post, at 385 (opinion concurring in judgment in part
and dissenting in part).

It may be true that a cross burning, even at a political
rally, arouses a sense of anger or hatred among the vast majority of citizens who see a burning cross. But this sense of
anger or hatred is not sufficient to ban all cross burnings.
As Gerald Gunther has stated, "The lesson I have drawn

538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

367Cite as: 538 U. S. 343 (2003)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
from my childhood in Nazi Germany and my happier adult
life in this country is the need to walk the sometimes difficult
path of denouncing the bigot's hateful ideas with all my
power, yet at the same time challenging any community's
attempt to suppress hateful ideas by force of law." Casper,
Gerry, 55 Stan. L. Rev. 647, 649 (2002) (internal quotation
marks omitted). The prima facie evidence provision in this
case ignores all of the contextual factors that are necessary
to decide whether a particular cross burning is intended
to intimidate. The First Amendment does not permit such
a shortcut.

For these reasons, the prima facie evidence provision, as
interpreted through the jury instruction and as applied in
Barry Black's case, is unconstitutional on its face. We recognize that the Supreme Court of Virginia has not authoritatively interpreted the meaning of the prima facie evidence
provision. Unlike Justice Scalia, we refuse to speculate
on whether any interpretation of the prima facie evidence
provision would satisfy the First Amendment. Rather, all
we hold is that because of the interpretation of the prima
facie evidence provision given by the jury instruction, the
provision makes the statute facially invalid at this point.
We also recognize the theoretical possibility that the court,
on remand, could interpret the provision in a manner different from that so far set forth in order to avoid the constitutional objections we have described. We leave open that
possibility. We also leave open the possibility that the provision is severable, and if so, whether Elliott and O'Mara
could be retried under $ 18.2-423.

With respect to Barry Black, we agree with the Supreme
Court of Virginia that his conviction cannot stand, and we

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, concurring.
Cross burning with "an intent to intimidate," Va. CodeAnn. $ 18.2-423 (1996), unquestionably qualifies as the kind

of threat that is unprotected by the First Amendment. Forthe reasons stated in the separate opinions that Justice
White and I wrote in R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377 (1992),that simple proposition provides a sufficient basis for upholding the basic prohibition in the Virginia statute even thoughit does not cover other types of threatening expressive conduct. With this observation, I join Justice O'Connor'sopinion.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins as toParts I and II, concurring in part, concurring in the judgment in part, and dissenting in part.

I agree with the Court that, under our decision in R. A. V.v.
St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377 (1992), a State may, without infring-ing the First Amendment, prohibit cross burning carried out

with the intent to intimidate. Accordingly, I join PartsI-III of the Court's opinion. I also agree that we should
vacate and remand the judgment of the Virginia SupremeCourt so that that court can have an opportunity authoritatively to construe the prima-facie-evidence provision of Va.Code Ann. $ 18.2-423 (1996). I write separately, however,
to describe what I believe to be the correct interpretation of$ 18.2-423, and to explain why I believe there is no justification for the plurality's apparent decision to invalidate thatprovision on its face.

of the statute violates the Constitution, it is necessary, first,to establish precisely what the presentation of prima facie

evidence accomplishes.Typically, "prima facie evidence" is defined as:

"Such evidence as, in the judgment of the law, is suffi-cient to establish a given fact . . . and which if not rebutted or contradicted, will remain sufficient. [Such evi-dence], if unexplained or uncontradicted, is sufficient to
sustain a judgment in favor of the issue which it sup-ports, but [it] may be contradicted by other evidence."
Black's Law Dictionary 1190 (6th ed. 1990).
The Virginia Supreme Court has, in prior cases, embraced
this canonical understanding of the pivotal statutory lan-guage.

2d 718, 722 (1951) ("Prima facie evidence is evidence whichon its first appearance is sufficient to raise a presumption of

fact or establish the fact in question unless rebutted"). Forexample, in

Nance v. Commonwealth, 203 Va. 428, 124 S. E.
2d 900 (1962), the Virginia Supreme Court interpreted a lawof the Commonwealth that (1) prohibited the possession of

certain "burglarious" tools "with intent to commit burglary,
robbery, or larceny . . . ," and (2) provided that "[t]he posses-sion of such burglarious tools . . . shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to commit burglary, robbery or larceny."Va. Code Ann. $ 18.1-87 (1960). The court explained that
the prima-facie-evidence provision "cuts off no defense norinterposes any obstacle to a contest of the facts, and `relieves
neither the court nor the jury of the duty to determine all ofthe questions of fact from the weight of the whole evidence.' "
Nance v. Commonwealth, 203 Va., at 432, 124 S. E. 2d, at
903-904; see also ibid., 124 S. E. 2d, at 904 (noting that the
prima-facie-evidence provision " `is merely a rule of evidence
and not the determination of a fact . . .' ").

The established meaning in Virginia, then, of the term
"prima facie evidence" appears to be perfectly orthodox: It

Opinion of Scalia, J.
is evidence that suffices, on its own, to establish a particularfact. But it is hornbook law that this is true only to the

extent that the evidence goes unrebutted. "Prima facie evi-dence of a fact is such evidence as, in judgment of law, is
sufficient to establish the fact; and, if not rebutted, remainssufficient for the purpose." 7B Michie's Jurisprudence of
Virginia and West Virginia $ 32 (1998) (emphasis added).

To be sure, Virginia is entirely free, if it wishes, to discardthe canonical understanding of the term "prima facie evidence." Its courts are also permitted to interpret thephrase in different ways for purposes of different statutes.
In this case, however, the Virginia Supreme Court has done
nothing of the sort. To the extent that tribunal has spoken
to the question of what "prima facie evidence" means for
purposes of $ 18.2-423, it has not deviated a whit from its
prior practice and from the ordinary legal meaning of these
words. Rather, its opinion explained that under $ 18.2-423,
"the act of burning a cross alone, with no evidence of intent
to intimidate, will . . . suffice for arrest and prosecution and
will insulate the Commonwealth from a motion to strike the
evidence at the end of its case-in-chief." 262 Va. 764, 778,
553 S. E. 2d 738, 746 (2001). Put otherwise, where the Commonwealth has demonstrated through its case in chief that
the defendant burned a cross in public view, this is sufficient,
at least until the defendant has come forward with rebuttal
evidence, to create a jury issue with respect to the intent
element of the offense.

It is important to note that the Virginia Supreme Court
did not suggest (as did the trial court's jury instructions in
respondent Black's case, see infra, at 377) that a jury may,
in light of the prima-facie-evidence provision, ignore any rebuttal evidence that has been presented and, solely on the
basis of a showing that the defendant burned a cross, find
that he intended to intimidate. Nor, crucially, did that court
say that the presentation of prima facie evidence is always
sufficient to get a case to a jury, i. e., that a court may never

Opinion of Scalia, J.
direct a verdict for a defendant who has been shown to haveburned a cross in public view, even if, by the end of trial,

the defendant has presented rebuttal evidence. Instead,according to the Virginia Supreme Court, the effect of the
prima-facie-evidence provision is far more limited. It suf-fices to "insulate the Commonwealth from a motion to strike
the evidence at the end of its case-in-chief," but it does noth-ing more. 262 Va., at 778, 553 S. E. 2d, at 746 (emphasis
added). That is, presentation of evidence that a defendantburned a cross in public view is automatically sufficient, on
its own, to support an inference that the defendant intendedto intimidate

only until the defendant comes forward withsome evidence in rebuttal.

II
The question presented, then, is whether, given this un-derstanding of the term "prima facie evidence," the crossburning statute is constitutional. The Virginia SupremeCourt answered that question in the negative. It stated
that "$ 18.2-423 sweeps within its ambit for arrest and pros-ecution, both protected and unprotected speech."

Ibid."The enhanced probability of prosecution under the statute

chills the expression of protected speech sufficiently to ren-der the statute overbroad." Id., at 777, 553 S. E. 2d, at 746.

This approach toward overbreadth analysis is unprece-dented. We have never held that the mere threat that individuals who engage in protected conduct will be subject toarrest and prosecution suffices to render a statute overbroad.
Rather, our overbreadth jurisprudence has consistently fo-cused on whether

the prohibitory terms of a particular stat-ute extend to protected conduct; that is, we have inquired

whether individuals who engage in protected conduct can beconvicted under a statute, not whether they might be subject
to arrest and prosecution. E. g., Houston v. Hill, 482 U. S.451, 459 (1987) (a statute "that make[s] unlawful a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct may be heldfacially invalid" (emphasis added));

ford, 408 U. S. 104, 114 (1972) (a statute may be overbroad"if in its reach it prohibits constitutionally protected conduct" (emphasis added)); R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S., at397 (White, J., concurring in judgment) (deeming the ordinance at issue "fatally overbroad because it criminalizes . . .expression protected by the First Amendment" (emphasis
added)).Unwilling to embrace the Virginia Supreme Court's novel
mode of overbreadth analysis, today's opinion properly fo-cuses on the question of who may be convicted, rather than
who may be arrested and prosecuted, under $ 18.2-423.Thus, it notes that "[t]he prima facie evidence provision permits a jury to convict in every cross-burning case in whichdefendants exercise their constitutional right not to put on a
defense." 1 Ante, at 365 (emphasis added). In such cases,the plurality explains, "[t]he provision permits the Commonwealth to arrest, prosecute, and convict a person basedsolely on the fact of cross burning itself."

Ibid. (emphasisadded). And this, according to the plurality, is constitutionally problematic because "a burning cross is not always in-tended to intimidate," and nonintimidating cross burning
cannot be prohibited. Ibid. In particular, the opinionnotes that cross burning may serve as "a statement of ideology" or "a symbol of group solidarity" at Ku Klux Klan ritu-als, and may even serve artistic purposes as in the case of
the film Mississippi Burning. Ante, at 365-366.The plurality is correct in all of this--and it means that
some individuals who engage in protected speech may, be1 The plurality also asserts that "even where a defendant like Black presents a defense, the prima facie evidence provision makes it more likely
that the jury will find an intent to intimidate regardless of the particular
facts of the case." Ante, at 365. There is no basis for this assertion.
The Virginia Supreme Court's opinion in Nance v. Commonwealth, 203
Va. 428, 432, 124 S. E. 2d 900, 903-904 (1962), states, in no uncertain terms,
that the presentation of a prima facie case " `relieves neither the court nor
the jury of the duty to determine all of the questions of fact from the
weight of the whole evidence.' " (Emphasis added.)

cause of the prima-facie-evidence provision, be subject toconviction. Such convictions, assuming they are unconstitutional, could be challenged on a case-by-case basis. The plu-rality, however, with little in the way of explanation, leaps
to the conclusion that the possibility of such convictions jus-tifies facial invalidation of the statute.

In deeming $ 18.2-423 facially invalid, the plurality presumably means to rely on some species of overbreadth doc-trine.

2 But it must be a rare species indeed. We have

noted that "[i]n a facial challenge to the overbreadth andvagueness of a law, a court's first task is to determine

whether the enactment reaches a substantial amount of con-stitutionally protected conduct."

Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 494 (1982). If onelooks only to the core provision of $ 18.2-423--"[i]t shall be

unlawful for any person or persons, with the intent of intim-idating any person or group of persons, to burn, or cause to
be burned, a cross . . ."--it appears not to capture any protected conduct; that language is limited in its reach to con2 Overbreadth was, of course, the framework of analysis employed by
the Virginia Supreme Court. See 262 Va. 764, 777-778, 553 S. E. 2d 738,
745-746 (2001) (examining the prima-facie-evidence provision in a section
labeled "OVERBREADTH ANALYSIS" and holding that the provision
"is overbroad"). Likewise, in their submissions to this Court, the parties'
analyses of the prima-facie-evidence provision focus on the question of
overbreadth. Brief for Petitioner 41-50 (confining its discussion of the
prima-facie-evidence provision to a section titled "THE VIRGINIA STATUTE IS NOT OVERBROAD"); Brief for Respondents 39-41 (arguing that
"[t]he prima facie evidence provision . . . render[s] [the statute] overbroad"); Reply Brief for Petitioner 13-20 (dividing its discussion of the
prima-facie-evidence provision into sections titled "There Is No Real
Overbreadth" and "There Is No Substantial Overbreadth"). This reliance
on overbreadth doctrine is understandable. This Court has made clear
that to succeed in a facial challenge without relying on overbreadth doctrine, "the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists
under which the Act would be valid." United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S.
739, 745 (1987). As the Court's opinion concedes, some of the speech covered by $ 18.2-423 can constitutionally be proscribed, ante, at 363.

duct which a State is, under the Court's holding, ante, at363, allowed to prohibit. In order to identify any protected

conduct that is affected by Virginia's cross-burning law, theplurality is compelled to focus not on the statute's core prohibition, but on the prima-facie-evidence provision, and henceon the process through which the prohibited conduct may be
found by a jury.3 And even in that context, the pluralitycannot claim that improper convictions will result from the
operation of the prima-facie-evidence provision alone. Asthe plurality concedes, the only persons who might impermissibly be convicted by reason of that provision are thosewho adopt a particular trial strategy, to wit, abstaining from
the presentation of a defense.The plurality is thus left with a strikingly attenuated argument to support the claim that Virginia's cross-burningstatute is facially invalid. The class of persons that the plurality contemplates could impermissibly be convicted under$ 18.2-423 includes only those individuals who (1) burn a
cross in public view, (2) do not intend to intimidate, (3) arenonetheless charged and prosecuted, and (4) refuse to present a defense. Ante, at 365 ("The prima facie evidence pro-vision permits a jury to convict in every cross-burning case
in which defendants exercise their constitutional right not toput on a defense").

Conceding (quite generously, in my view) that this class ofpersons exists, it cannot possibly give rise to a viable facial
challenge, not even with the aid of our First Amendment

3 Unquestionably, the process through which elements of a criminal offense are established in a jury trial may raise serious constitutional concerns. Typically, however, such concerns sound in due process, not First
Amendment overbreadth. E. g., County Court of Ulster Cty. v. Allen,
442 U. S. 140, 156-157 (1979); Barnes v. United States, 412 U. S. 837, 838
(1973); In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 359 (1970). Respondents in this case
have not challenged $ 18.2-423 under the Due Process Clause, and neither
the plurality nor the Virginia Supreme Court relies on due process in
declaring the statute invalid.

overbreadth doctrine. For this Court has emphasized re-peatedly that "where a statute regulates expressive conduct,

the scope of the statute does not render it unconstitutionalunless its overbreadth is not only real, but substantial as
well, judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimatesweep."

Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U. S. 103, 112 (1990) (internal
quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). See also Houston v. Hill, 482 U. S., at 458 ("Only a statute that is substan-tially overbroad may be invalidated on its face");

Members
of City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466U. S. 789, 800 (1984) ("[T]he mere fact that one can conceive

of some impermissible applications of a statute is not suffi-cient to render it susceptible to an overbreadth challenge");
New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 771 (1982) ("[A] law shouldnot be invalidated for overbreadth unless it reaches a substantial number of impermissible applications . . ."). Thenotion that the set of cases identified by the plurality in
which convictions might improperly be obtained is suffi-ciently large to render the statute

substantially overbroad
is fanciful. The potential improper convictions of which the
plurality complains are more appropriately classified as thesort of "marginal applications" of a statute in light of which

"facial invalidation is inappropriate." Parker v. Levy, 417U. S. 733, 760 (1974).

4 Confronted with the incontrovertible fact that this statute easily
passes overbreadth analysis, the plurality is driven to the truly startling
assertion that a statute which is not invalid in all of its applications may
nevertheless be facially invalidated even if it is not overbroad. The only
expression of that proposition that the plurality can find in our jurisprudence appears in footnote dictum in the 5-to-4 opinion in Secretary of State
of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U. S. 947, 965-966, n. 13 (1984). See
id., at 975 (Rehnquist, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Powell and O'Connor, JJ., dissenting). Stare decisis cannot explain the newfound affection
for this errant doctrine (even if stare decisis applied to dictum), because
the holding of a later opinion (joined by six Justices) flatly repudiated it.
See United States v. Salerno, supra, at 745 (Rehnquist, C. J., joined by

Opinion of Scalia, J.
Perhaps more alarming, the plurality concedes, ante, at 364,365, that its understanding of the prima-facie-evidence provision is premised on the jury instructions given in respondentBlack's case. This would all be well and good were it not
for the fact that the plurality facially invalidates $ 18.2-423.Ante, at 367 ("[T]he prima facie evidence provision, as interpreted through the jury instruction and as applied in BarryBlack's case, is unconstitutional on its face"). I am aware
of no case--and the plurality cites none--in which we havefacially invalidated an

ambiguous statute on the basis of aconstitutionally troubling jury instruction.

5 And it is altoWhite, Blackmun, Powell, O'Connor, and Scalia, JJ.) (to succeed in a
facial challenge without relying on overbreadth doctrine, "the challenger

must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act
would be valid").

Even if I were willing, as the plurality apparently is, to ignore our repudiation of the Munson dictum, that case provides no foundation whatever
for facially invalidating a statute under the conditions presented here.
Our willingness facially to invalidate the statute in Munson without reliance on First Amendment overbreadth was premised on our conclusion
that the challenged provision was invalid in all of its applications. We
explained that "there is no core of easily identifiable and constitutionally
proscribable conduct that the statute prohibits." Munson, 467 U. S., at
965-966. And we stated that "[t]he flaw in the statute is not simply that
it includes within its sweep some impermissible applications, but that in
all its applications it operates on a fundamentally mistaken premise that
high solicitation costs are an accurate measure of fraud." Id., at 966.
Unless the Court is prepared to abandon a contention that it takes great
pains to establish--that "the history of cross burning in this country
shows that cross burning is often intimidating, intended to create a pervasive fear in victims that they are a target of violence," ante, at 360--it is
difficult to see how Munson has any bearing on the constitutionality of
the prima-facie-evidence provision.

5 The plurality's reliance on Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U. S. 1 (1949),

is mistaken. In that case the Court deemed only the jury instruction,
rather than the ordinance under review, to be constitutionally infirm. To
be sure, it held that such a jury instruction could never support a constitutionally valid conviction, but that is quite different from holding the ordinance to be facially invalid. Insofar as the ordinance was concerned,
Terminiello made repeated references to the as-applied nature of the

538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

377Cite as: 538 U. S. 343 (2003)
Opinion of Scalia, J.
gether unsurprising that there is no precedent for such a
holding. For where state law is ambiguous, treating jury
instructions as binding interpretations would cede an enormous measure of power over state law to trial judges. A
single judge's idiosyncratic reading of a state statute could
trigger its invalidation. In this case, the troubling instruction--"The burning of a cross, by itself, is sufficient evidence
from which you may infer the required intent," App. 196--
was taken verbatim from Virginia's Model Jury Instructions.
But these Model Instructions have been neither promulgated
by the legislature nor formally adopted by the Virginia Supreme Court. And it is hornbook law, in Virginia as elsewhere, that "[p]roffered instructions which do not correctly
state the law . . . are erroneous and should be refused." 10A
Michie's Jurisprudence of Virginia and West Virginia, Instructions $ 15, p. 35 (Supp. 2000).

The plurality's willingness to treat this jury instruction as
binding (and to strike down $ 18.2-423 on that basis) would
be shocking enough had the Virginia Supreme Court offered
no guidance as to the proper construction of the prima-facieevidence provision. For ordinarily we would decline to pass
upon the constitutionality of an ambiguous state statute until
that State's highest court had provided a binding construcchallenge. Id., at 3 (noting that the defendant "maintained at all times
that the ordinance as applied to his conduct violated his right of free
speech . . ." (emphasis added)); id., at 5 (noting that "[a]s construed and
applied [the provision] at least contains parts that are unconstitutional"
(emphasis added)); id., at 6 ("The pinch of the statute is in its application"

U. L. Rev. 359, 433, n. 333 (1998) (characterizing Terminiello as "adopting
a court's jury instruction as an authoritative narrowing construction of
a breach of the peace ordinance but ultimately confining its decision to
overturning the defendant's conviction rather than invalidating the statute
on its face").

tion. E. g., Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520U. S. 43, 78 (1997). If there is any exception to that rule, it

is the case where one of two possible interpretations of thestate statute would clearly render it unconstitutional, and
the other would not. In that situation, applying the maxim"ut res magis valeat quam pereat" we would do precisely
the opposite of what the plurality does here--that is, wewould adopt the alternative reading that renders the statute
constitutional rather than unconstitutional. The plurality'sanalysis is all the more remarkable given the dissonance between the interpretation of $ 18.2-423 implicit in the juryinstruction and the one suggested by the Virginia Supreme
Court. That court's opinion did not state that, once proof ofpublic cross burning is presented, a jury is permitted to infer
an intent to intimidate solely on this basis and regardless ofwhether a defendant has offered evidence to rebut any such
inference. To the contrary, in keeping with the black-letterunderstanding of "prima facie evidence," the Virginia Supreme Court explained that such evidence suffices only to"insulate the Commonwealth from a motion to strike the evidence at the end of its case-in-chief." 262 Va., at 778, 553S. E. 2d, at 746. The court did not so much as hint that a
jury is permitted, under $ 18.2-423, to ignore rebuttal evi-dence and infer an intent to intimidate strictly on the basis
of the prosecution's prima facie case. And unless and untilthe Supreme Court of Virginia tells us that the prima-facieevidence provision permits a jury to infer intent under suchconditions, this Court is entirely unjustified in facially invalidating $ 18.2-423 on this basis.As its concluding performance, in an apparent effort to
paper over its unprecedented decision facially to invalidatea statute in light of an errant jury instruction, the plurality
states:

"We recognize that the Supreme Court of Virginia hasnot authoritatively interpreted the meaning of the prima

facie evidence provision. . . . We also recognize the

Opinion of Scalia, J.
theoretical possibility that the court, on remand, couldinterpret the provision in a manner different from that

so far set forth in order to avoid the constitutional objec-tions we have described. We leave open that possibility." Ante, at 367.
Now this is truly baffling. Having declared, in the immedi-ately preceding sentence, that $ 18.2-423 is "unconstitutional

on its face," ibid. (emphasis added), the plurality holds outthe possibility that the Virginia Supreme Court will offer
some saving construction of the statute. It should go with-out saying that if a saving construction of $ 18.2-423 is possible, then facial invalidation is inappropriate. E. g., Harrisonv. NAACP, 360 U. S. 167, 176 (1959) ("[N]o principle has
found more consistent or clear expression than that the fed-eral courts should not adjudicate the constitutionality of
state enactments fairly open to interpretation until the statecourts have been afforded a reasonable opportunity to pass
upon them"). So, what appears to have happened is that theplurality has facially invalidated not $ 18.2-423, but its own
hypothetical interpretation of $ 18.2-423, and has then re-manded to the Virginia Supreme Court to learn the actual
interpretation of $ 18.2-423. Words cannot express my won-derment at this virtuoso performance.

III
As the analysis in Part I, supra, demonstrates, I be-lieve the prima-facie-evidence provision in Virginia's crossburning statute is constitutionally unproblematic. Never-theless, because the Virginia Supreme Court has not yet
offered an authoritative construction of $ 18.2-423, I concur inthe Court's decision to vacate and remand the judgment with
respect to respondents Elliott and O'Mara. I also agreethat respondent Black's conviction cannot stand. As noted
above, the jury in Black's case was instructed that "[t]heburning of a cross,

by itself, is sufficient evidence from whichyou may infer the required intent." App. 196 (emphasis

Opinion of Souter, J.
added). Where this instruction has been given, it is impos-sible to determine whether the jury has rendered its verdict

(as it must) in light of the entire body of facts before it--including evidence that might rebut the presumption that
the cross burning was done with an intent to intimidate--or, instead, has chosen to ignore such rebuttal evidence and
focused exclusively on the fact that the defendant burned across.

6 Still, I cannot go along with the Court's decision to

affirm the judgment with respect to Black. In that judg-ment, the Virginia Supreme Court, having erroneously concluded that $ 18.2-423 is overbroad, not only vacated Black'sconviction, but dismissed the indictment against him as well.
262 Va., at 779, 553 S. E. 2d, at 746. Because I believe theconstitutional defect in Black's conviction is rooted in a jury
instruction and not in the statute itself, I would not dismissthe indictment and would permit the Commonwealth to retry
Black if it wishes to do so. It is an interesting questionwhether the plurality's willingness to let the Virginia Supreme Court resolve the plurality's make-believe facial inval-idation of the statute extends as well to the facial invalidation insofar as it supports dismissal of the indictment againstBlack. Logically, there is no reason why it would not.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Kennedy and Justice Ginsburg join, concurring in the judgment in part anddissenting in part.

I agree with the majority that the Virginia statute makesa content-based distinction within the category of punishable
intimidating or threatening expression, the very type of dis6 Though the jury may well have embraced the former (constitutionally
permissible) understanding of its duties, that possibility is not enough to
dissipate the cloud of constitutional doubt. See Sandstrom v. Montana,

constitutionally sound understanding of an ambiguous instruction: "[W]e
cannot discount the possibility that the jury may have interpreted the
instruction [improperly]").

tinction we considered in R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377(1992). I disagree that any exception should save Virginia's

law from unconstitutionality under the holding in R. A. V. orany acceptable variation of it.

I
The ordinance struck down in R. A. V., as it had been con-strued by the State's highest court, prohibited the use of

symbols (including but not limited to a burning cross) asthe equivalent of generally proscribable fighting words, but
the ordinance applied only when the symbol was provocative" `on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender.' "

Id.,at 380 (quoting St. Paul, Minn., Legis. Code $ 292.02 (1990)).

Although the Virginia statute in issue here contains no suchexpress "basis of " limitation on prohibited subject matter,
the specific prohibition of cross burning with intent to intimi-date selects a symbol with particular content from the field
of all proscribable expression meant to intimidate. To besure, that content often includes an essentially intimidating
message, that the cross burner will harm the victim, mostprobably in a physical way, given the historical identification
of burning crosses with arson, beating, and lynching. Buteven when the symbolic act is meant to terrify, a burning
cross may carry a further, ideological message of white Prot-estant supremacy. The ideological message not only accompanies many threatening uses of the symbol, but is also ex-pressed when a burning cross is not used to threaten but
merely to symbolize the supremacist ideology and the soli-darity of those who espouse it. As the majority points out,
the burning cross can broadcast threat and ideology to-gether, ideology alone, or threat alone, as was apparently the
choice of respondents Elliott and O'Mara. Ante, at 354-357, 363.

The issue is whether the statutory prohibition restrictedto this symbol falls within one of the exceptions to

R. A. V.'sgeneral condemnation of limited content-based proscription

within a broader category of expression proscribable generally. Because of the burning cross's extraordinary force as
a method of intimidation, the R. A. V. exception most likely
to cover the statute is the first of the three mentioned there,
which the R. A. V. opinion called an exception for content
discrimination on a basis that "consists entirely of the very
reason the entire class of speech at issue is proscribable."
505 U. S., at 388. This is the exception the majority speaks
of here as covering statutes prohibiting "particularly virulent" proscribable expression. Ante, at 363.

I do not think that the Virginia statute qualifies for this
virulence exception as R. A. V. explained it. The statute
fits poorly with the illustrative examples given in R. A. V.,
none of which involves communication generally associated
with a particular message, and in fact, the majority's discussion of a special virulence exception here moves that exception toward a more flexible conception than the version in
R. A. V. I will reserve judgment on that doctrinal development, for even on a pragmatic conception of R. A. V. and its
exceptions the Virginia statute could not pass muster, the
most obvious hurdle being the statute's prima facie evidence
provision. That provision is essential to understanding why
the statute's tendency to suppress a message disqualifies it
from any rescue by exception from R. A. V.'s general rule.

II
R. A. V. defines the special virulence exception to the rule
barring content-based subclasses of categorically proscribable expression this way: prohibition by subcategory is nonetheless constitutional if it is made "entirely" on the "basis"
of "the very reason" that "the entire class of speech at issue
is proscribable" at all. 505 U. S., at 388. The Court explained that when the subcategory is confined to the most
obviously proscribable instances, "no significant danger of
idea or viewpoint discrimination exists," ibid., and the expla538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

nation was rounded out with some illustrative examples.None of them, however, resembles the case before us.

1

The first example of permissible distinction is for a prohi-bition of obscenity unusually offensive "in its prurience,"

ibid. (emphasis deleted), with citation to a case in which theSeventh Circuit discussed the difference between obscene
depictions of actual people and simulations. As that courtnoted, distinguishing obscene publications on this basis
does not suggest discrimination on the basis of the messageconveyed.

Kucharek v. Hanaway, 902 F. 2d 513, 517-518(1990). The opposite is true, however, when a general prohibition of intimidation is rejected in favor of a distinct pro-scription of intimidation by cross burning. The cross may
have been selected because of its special power to threaten,but it may also have been singled out because of disapproval
of its message of white supremacy, either because a legisla-ture thought white supremacy was a pernicious doctrine or
because it found that dramatic, public espousal of it was acivic embarrassment. Thus, there is no kinship between the
cross-burning statute and the core prurience example.Nor does this case present any analogy to the statute
prohibiting threats against the President, the second of
R. A. V.'s examples of the virulence exception and the onethe majority relies upon. Ante, at 362. The content discrimination in that statute relates to the addressee of thethreat and reflects the special risks and costs associated with
threatening the President. Again, however, threats againstthe President are not generally identified by reference to the
content of any message that may accompany the threat, letalone any viewpoint, and there is no obvious correlation in
fact between victim and message. Millions of statementsare made about the President every day on every subject

1 Although three examples are given, the third may be skipped here. It
covers misleading advertising in a particular industry in which the risk of
fraud is thought to be great, and thus deals with commercial speech with
its separate doctrine and standards. R. A. V., 505 U. S., at 388-389.

Opinion of Souter, J.
and from every standpoint; threats of violence are not anintegral feature of any one subject or viewpoint as distinct

from others. Differential treatment of threats against thePresident, then, selects nothing but special risks, not special
messages. A content-based proscription of cross burning,on the other hand, may be a subtle effort to ban not only the
intensity of the intimidation cross burning causes when doneto threaten, but also the particular message of white supremacy that is broadcast even by nonthreatening cross burning.I thus read

R. A. V.'s examples of the particular virulenceexception as covering prohibitions that are not clearly associated with a particular viewpoint, and that are consequentlydifferent from the Virginia statute. On that understanding
of things, I necessarily read the majority opinion as treatingR. A. V.'s virulence exception in a more flexible, pragmatic
manner than the original illustrations would suggest. Ante,at 363. Actually, another way of looking at today's decision
would see it as a slight modification of R. A. V.'s third excep-tion, which allows content-based discrimination within a proscribable category when its "nature" is such "that there is norealistic possibility that official suppression of ideas is afoot."
R. A. V., supra, at 390. The majority's approach could betaken as recognizing an exception to

R. A. V. when circum-stances show that the statute's ostensibly valid reason for

punishing particularly serious proscribable expression prob-ably is not a ruse for message suppression, even though the
statute may have a greater (but not exclusive) impact onadherents of one ideology than on others, ante, at 362-363.

III
My concern here, in any event, is not with the merit of apragmatic doctrinal move. For whether or not the Court

should conceive of exceptions to R. A. V.'s general rule in amore practical way, no content-based statute should survive
even under a pragmatic recasting of R. A. V. without a highprobability that no "official suppression of ideas is afoot,"

Opinion of Souter, J.
505 U. S., at 390. I believe the prima facie evidence provi-sion stands in the way of any finding of such a high probability here.Virginia's statute provides that burning a cross on the
property of another, a highway, or other public place is"prima facie evidence of an intent to intimidate a person or
group of persons." Va. Code Ann. $ 18.2-423 (1996). While
that language was added by amendment to the earlier por-tion of the statute criminalizing cross burning with intent to

intimidate, ante, at 363 (plurality opinion), it was a part ofthe prohibitory statute at the time these respondents burned
crosses, and the whole statute at the time of respondents'
conduct is what counts for purposes of the First Amendment.

As I see the likely significance of the evidence provision,
its primary effect is to skew jury deliberations toward conviction in cases where the evidence of intent to intimidate is
relatively weak and arguably consistent with a solely ideological reason for burning. To understand how the provision may work, recall that the symbolic act of burning a
cross, without more, is consistent with both intent to intimidate and intent to make an ideological statement free of any
aim to threaten. Ante, at 354-357. One can tell the intimidating instance from the wholly ideological one only by reference to some further circumstance. In the real world, of
course, and in real-world prosecutions, there will always be
further circumstances, and the factfinder will always learn
something more than the isolated fact of cross burning.
Sometimes those circumstances will show an intent to intimidate, but sometimes they will be at least equivocal, as
in cases where a white supremacist group burns a cross
at an initiation ceremony or political rally visible to the public. In such a case, if the factfinder is aware of the prima
facie evidence provision, as the jury was in respondent
Black's case, ante, at 349-350, the provision will have the
practical effect of tilting the jury's thinking in favor of the
prosecution. What is significant is not that the provision

538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN
386 VIRGINIA v. BLACK

Opinion of Souter, J.
permits a factfinder's conclusion that the defendant actedwith proscribable and punishable intent without any further

indication, because some such indication will almost alwaysbe presented. What is significant is that the provision will
encourage a factfinder to err on the side of a finding of intentto intimidate when the evidence of circumstances fails to
point with any clarity either to the criminal intent or to the
permissible one. The effect of such a distortion is difficultto remedy, since any guilty verdict will survive sufficiency

review unless the defendant can show that, "viewing the evi-dence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, [no] rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of
the crime beyond a reasonable doubt." Jackson v. Virginia,
443 U. S. 307, 319 (1979). The provision will thus tend to
draw nonthreatening ideological expression within the ambit
of the prohibition of intimidating expression, as Justice
O'Connor notes. Ante, at 365-366 (plurality opinion).

To the extent the prima facie evidence provision skews
prosecutions, then, it skews the statute toward suppressing
ideas. Thus, the appropriate way to consider the statute's
prima facie evidence term, in my view, is not as if it were an
overbroad statutory definition amenable to severance or a
narrowing construction. The question here is not the permissible scope of an arguably overbroad statute, but the
claim of a clearly content-based statute to an exception from
the general prohibition of content-based proscriptions, an exception that is not warranted if the statute's terms show that
suppression of ideas may be afoot. Accordingly, the way to
look at the prima facie evidence provision is to consider it
for any indication of what is afoot. And if we look at the
provision for this purpose, it has a very obvious significance
as a mechanism for bringing within the statute's prohibition
some expression that is doubtfully threatening though certainly distasteful.

It is difficult to conceive of an intimidation case that
could be easier to prove than one with cross burning, assum538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

387Cite as: 538 U. S. 343 (2003)
Opinion of Souter, J.
ing any circumstances suggesting intimidation are present.The provision, apparently so unnecessary to legitimate prosecution of intimidation, is therefore quite enough to raisethe question whether Virginia's content-based statute seeks
more than mere protection against a virulent form of intimi-dation. It consequently bars any conclusion that an exception to the general rule of R. A. V. is warranted on the
ground "that there is no realistic [or little realistic] possibil-ity that official suppression of ideas is afoot," 505 U. S., at

390.2 Since no R. A. V. exception can save the statute ascontent based, it can only survive if narrowly tailored to
serve a compelling state interest, id., at 395-396, a stringenttest the statute cannot pass; a content-neutral statute banning intimidation would achieve the same object withoutsingling out particular content.

IV
I conclude that the statute under which all three of therespondents were prosecuted violates the First Amendment,

since the statute's content-based distinction was invalid atthe time of the charged activities, regardless of whether

the prima facie evidence provision was given any effect inany respondent's individual case. In my view, severance of
the prima facie evidence provision now could not eliminate
the unconstitutionality of the whole statute at the time ofthe respondents' conduct. I would therefore affirm the

judgment of the Supreme Court of Virginia vacating therespondents' convictions and dismissing the indictments.
Accordingly, I concur in the Court's judgment as to respond-ent Black and dissent as to respondents Elliott and O'Mara.

2 The same conclusion also goes for the second R. A. V. exception relating to " `secondary effects.' " 505 U. S., at 389 (citing Renton v. Playtime
Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41, 48 (1986)). Our "secondary effects" jurisprudence presupposes that the regulation at issue is "unrelated to the suppression of free expression." Ibid.

value cross burning has, the legislature simply wrote it outby banning only intimidating conduct undertaken by a particular means. A conclusion that the statute prohibitingcross burning with intent to intimidate sweeps beyond a prohibition on certain conduct into the zone of expression over-looks not only the words of the statute but also reality.

To me, the majority's brief history of the Ku Klux Klan onlyreinforces this common understanding of the Klan as a terrorist organization, which, in its endeavor to intimidate,or even eliminate those it dislikes, uses the most brutal of
methods.Such methods typically include cross burning--"a tool for
the intimidation and harassment of racial minorities, Catho-lics, Jews, Communists, and any other groups hated by the
Klan." Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, 770 (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring). Forthose not easily frightened, cross burning has been followed

by more extreme measures, such as beatings and murder. J.Williams, Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years,

But the perception that a burning cross is a threat and aprecursor of worse things to come is not limited to blacks.
Because the modern Klan expanded the list of its enemiesbeyond blacks and "radical[s]" to include Catholics, Jews,
most immigrants, and labor unions, Newton & Newton ix, aburning cross is now widely viewed as a signal of impending
terror and lawlessness. I wholeheartedly agree with the ob-servation made by the Commonwealth of Virginia:

"A white, conservative, middle-class Protestant, wakingup at night to find a burning cross outside his home, will
reasonably understand that someone is threatening him.His reaction is likely to be very different than if he were
to find, say, a burning circle or square. In the lattercase, he may call the fire department. In the former, he
will probably call the police." Brief for Petitioner 26.
In our culture, cross burning has almost invariably meantlawlessness and understandably instills in its victims wellgrounded fear of physical violence.

In February 1952, in light of this series of cross burningsand attendant reports that the Klan, "long considered dead

burning as creating an intolerable atmosphere of terror isnot surprising: Although the cross took on some religious

it had reverted to its original function "as an instrumentof intimidation." W. Wade, The Fiery Cross: The Ku Klux

af ter the enactment of this statute, Virginia's GeneralAssembly embarked on a campaign of "massive resistance"

in response to Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S.483 (1954). See generally Griffin v. School Bd. of Prince
Edward Cty., 377 U. S. 218, 221 (1964); Harrison v. Day, 200Va. 439, 448-454, 106 S. E. 2d 636, 644-648 (1959) (describing
massive resistance as legislatively mandated attempt to closepublic schools rather than desegregate).

It strains credulity to suggest that a state legislature thatadopted a litany of segregationist laws self-contradictorily
intended to squelch the segregationist message. Even forsegregationists, violent and terroristic conduct, the Siamese
twin of cross burning, was intolerable. The ban on crossburning with intent to intimidate demonstrates that even
segregationists understood the difference between intimidating and terroristic conduct and racist expression. It is sim-ply beyond belief that, in passing the statute now under review, the Virginia Legislature was concerned with anythingbut penalizing conduct it must have viewed as particularly
vicious.

Accordingly, this statute prohibits only conduct, not ex-pression. And, just as one cannot burn down someone's

house to make a political point and then seek refuge in theFirst Amendment, those who hate cannot terrorize and intimidate to make their point. In light of my conclusion that

id., at 795, 553 S. E. 2d, at 755 (Hassell, J.,dissenting) ("Code $ 18.2-423 creates a statutory inference"

term "presumption." Martin v. Phillips, 235 Va. 523, 526,369 S. E. 2d 397, 399 (1988).

"A presumption is a rule of law that compels the factfinder to draw a certain conclusion or a certain inference
from a given set of facts.1 The primary significance ofa presumption is that it operates to shift to the opposing
party the burden of producing evidence tending to rebutthe presumption.

2 No presumption, however, can operate to shift the ultimate burden of persuasion from theparty upon whom it was originally cast.

"1In contrast, an inference, sometimes loosely referred to as a presumption of fact, does not compel a specific conclusion. An inference merely applies to the rational potency or probative value of an
evidentiary fact to which the fact finder may attach whatever force
or weight it deems best. 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence in Trials at Common Law $ 2491(1), at 304 (Chad. rev. 1981).

"2An inference, on the other hand, does not invoke this procedural
consequence of shifting the burden of production. Id."

Ibid. (some citations omitted; emphasis added).

Both the majority and the dissent below classified the clause
in question as an "inference," and I see no reason to disagree,
particularly in light of the instructions given to the jury inBlack's case, requiring it to find guilt beyond a reasonable

doubt both as to the fact that "the defendant burned or
caused to be burned a cross in a public place," and that "he
did so with the intent to intimidate any person or group of
persons," 262 Va., at 796, 553 S. E. 2d, at 756 (Hassell, J.,
dissenting) (quoting jury instructions in Black's case).

Even though under Virginia law the statutory provision at
issue here is characterized as an "inference," the Court must
still inquire whether the label Virginia attaches corresponds
to the categorization our cases have given such clauses. In
this respect, it is crucial to observe that what Virginia law
calls an "inference" is what our cases have termed a "permissive inference or presumption." County Court of Ulster
Cty. v. Allen, 442 U. S. 140, 157 (1979).3 Given that this

3 As the Court explained in Allen, a permissive inference or presumption "allows--but does not require--the trier of fact to infer the elemental
fact from proof by the prosecutor of the basic one and which places no
burden of any kind on the defendant. In that situation the basic fact may
constitute prima facie evidence of the elemental fact. . . . Because this
permissive presumption leaves the trier of fact free to credit or reject the
inference and does not shift the burden of proof, it affects the application
of the `beyond a reasonable doubt' standard only if, under the facts of the
case, there is no rational way the trier could make the connection permit538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Thomas, J., dissenting
Court's definitions of a "permissive inference" and a "mandatory presumption" track Virginia's definitions of "inference"
and "presumption," the Court should judge the Virginia statute based on the constitutional analysis applicable to "inferences": they raise no constitutional flags unless there is "no
rational way the trier could make the connection permitted
by the inference." Ibid. As explained in Part I, supra, not
making a connection between cross burning and intimidation
would be irrational.

But even with respect to statutes containing a mandatory
irrebuttable presumption as to intent, the Court has not
shown much concern. For instance, there is no scienter requirement for statutory rape. See, e. g., Tenn. Code Ann.

$ 39-13-506 (1997); Ore. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 163.365 (1989); Mo.
Rev. Stat. $ 566.032 (2000); Ga. Code Ann. $ 16-6-3 (1996).
That is, a person can be arrested, prosecuted, and convicted
for having sex with a minor, without the government ever
producing any evidence, let alone proving beyond a reasonable doubt, that a minor did not consent. In fact, "[f]or purposes of the child molesting statute . . . consent is irrelevant.
The legislature has determined in such cases that children
under the age of sixteen (16) cannot, as a matter of law, consent to have sexual acts performed upon them, or consent to
engage in a sexual act with someone over the age of sixteen
(16)." Warrick v. State, 538 N. E. 2d 952, 954 (Ind. App.
1989) (citing Ind. Code $ 35-42-4-3 (1988)). The legislature
finds the behavior so reprehensible that the intent is satisfied
by the mere act committed by a perpetrator. Considering

ted by the inference." 442 U. S., at 157 (citations omitted). By contrast,
"[a] mandatory presumption . . . may affect not only the strength of the
`no reasonable doubt' burden but also the placement of that burden; it tells
the trier that he or they must find the elemental fact upon proof of the
basic fact, at least unless the defendant has come forward with some evidence to rebut the presumed connection between the two facts." Ibid.

Thomas, J., dissenting
the horrific effect cross burning has on its victims, it is alsoreasonable to presume intent to intimidate from the act

itself.Statutes prohibiting possession of drugs with intent to distribute operate much the same way as statutory rape laws.Under these statutes, the intent to distribute is effectively
satisfied by possession of some threshold amount of drugs.See,

e. g., Del. Code Ann., Tit. 16, $ 4753A (1987); Mass. Gen.Laws, ch. 94C, $ 32E (West 1997); S. C. Code Ann. $ 44-53-

370 (West 2000). As with statutory rape, the presumptionof intent in such statutes is irrebuttable--not only can a person be arrested for the crime of possession with intent todistribute (or "trafficking") without any evidence of intent
beyond quantity of drugs, but such person cannot evenmount a defense to the element of intent. However, as with
statutory rape statutes, our cases do not reveal any contro-versy with respect to the presumption of intent in these
drug statutes.Because the prima facie clause here is an inference, not an
irrebuttable presumption, there is all the more basis underour due process precedents to sustain this statute.

B
The plurality, however, is troubled by the presumption be-cause this is a First Amendment case. The plurality laments the fate of an innocent cross burner who burns a cross,but does so without an intent to intimidate. The plurality
fears the chill on expression because, according to the plural-ity, the inference permits "the Commonwealth to arrest,
prosecute, and convict a person based solely on the fact ofcross burning itself."

Ante, at 365. First, it is, at the veryleast, unclear that the inference comes into play during arrest and initiation of a prosecution, that is, prior to the in-structions stage of an actual trial. Second, as I explained
above, the inference is rebuttable and, as the jury instruc-tions given in this case demonstrate, Virginia law still re538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

399Cite as: 538 U. S. 343 (2003)
Thomas, J., dissenting
quires the jury to find the existence of each element, includ-ing intent to intimidate, beyond a reasonable doubt.

Moreover, even in the First Amendment context, theCourt has upheld such regulations where conduct that
initially appears culpable ultimately results in dismissedcharges. A regulation of pornography is one such example.
While possession of child pornography is illegal, New York
v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 764 (1982), possession of adult por-nography, as long as it is not obscene, is allowed,

Miller v.
California, 413 U. S. 15 (1973). As a result, those pornogra-phers trafficking in images of adults who look like minors

may be not only deterred but also arrested and prosecuted
for possessing what a jury might find to be legal materials.
This "chilling" effect has not, however, been a cause for
grave concern with respect to overbreadth of such statutes
among the Members of this Court.

That the First Amendment gives way to other interests is
not a remarkable proposition. What is remarkable is that,
under the plurality's analysis, the determination whether an
interest is sufficiently compelling depends not on the harm a
regulation in question seeks to prevent, but on the area of
society at which it aims. For instance, in Hill v. Colorado,
530 U. S. 703 (2000), the Court upheld a restriction on protests near abortion clinics, explaining that the State had a
legitimate interest, which was sufficiently narrowly tailored,
in protecting those seeking services of such establishments
from "unwanted advice" and "unwanted communication," id.,
at 708, 716, 717, 729. In so concluding, the Court placed
heavy reliance on the "vulnerable physical and emotional
conditions" of patients. Id., at 729. Thus, when it came to
the rights of those seeking abortions, the Court deemed restrictions on "unwanted advice," which, notably, can be given
only from a distance of at least eight feet from a prospective
patient, justified by the countervailing interest in obtaining
an abortion. Yet, here, the plurality strikes down the statute because one day an individual might wish to burn a cross,

but might do so without an intent to intimidate anyone.That cross burning subjects its targets, and, sometimes, an

unintended audience, see 262 Va., at 782, 553 S. E. 2d, at748-749 (Hassell, J., dissenting); see also App. 93-97, to extreme emotional distress, and is virtually never viewedmerely as "unwanted communication," but rather, as a physical threat, is of no concern to the plurality. Henceforth,under the plurality's view, physical safety will be valued less
than the right to be free from unwanted communications.

Because I would uphold the validity of this statute, I re-spectfully dissent.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 02-215. Argued February 24, 2003--Decided April 7, 2003
Respondent physicians filed suit alleging that managed-health-care organizations, including petitioners, violated, inter alia, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) by failing to reimburse
them for health-care services that they had provided to patients covered
by the organizations' plans. Petitioners moved to compel arbitration.
The District Court refused to compel arbitration of the RICO claims
on the ground that the arbitration clauses in the parties' agreements
prohibited awards of "punitive damages," and hence an arbitrator lacked
authority to award treble damages under RICO. Accordingly, the court
deemed the arbitration agreements unenforceable with respect to those
claims. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.

Held: It is unclear whether the agreements actually prevent an arbitrator

from awarding treble damages under RICO. This Court's cases have
placed different statutory treble damages provisions on different points
along the spectrum between purely compensatory and strictly punitive
awards. In particular, the Court has repeatedly acknowledged that
RICO's treble-damages provision is remedial in nature, and it is not
clear that the parties intended the term "punitive" to encompass claims
for treble damages under RICO. Since the Court does not know how
the arbitrator will construe the remedial limitations, the questions
whether they render the parties' agreement unenforceable and whether
it is for courts or arbitrators to decide enforceability in the first instance
are unusually abstract. It would be premature for the Court to address
them; the proper course is to compel arbitration. Pp. 403-407.

quantum meruit. In re: Managed Care Litigation, 132F. Supp. 2d 989, 992 (SD Fla. 2000).

Of particular concern here, PacifiCare and United movedthe District Court to compel arbitration, arguing that provisions in their contracts with respondents required arbitra-tion of these disputes, including those arising under RICO.
Ibid. Respondents opposed the motion on the ground that,because the arbitration provisions prohibit an award of punitive damages, see App. 107, 147, 168, 212, respondents couldnot obtain "meaningful relief " in arbitration for their claims
under the RICO statute, which authorizes treble damages,18 U. S. C. $ 1964(c). See

Paladino v. Avnet Computer Tech-nologies, Inc., 134 F. 3d 1054, 1062 (CA11 1998) (holding that

where a remedial limitation in an arbitration agreement pre-vents a plaintiff from obtaining "meaningful relief " for a
statutory claim, the agreement to arbitrate is unenforceablewith respect to that claim).

The District Court denied petitioners' request to compelarbitration of the RICO claims. 132 F. Supp. 2d, at 1007.
The court concluded that given the remedial limitations inthe relevant contracts, it was, indeed, "faced with a potential
Paladino situation . . . , where the plaintiff may not be ableto obtain meaningful relief for allegations of statutory violations in an arbitration forum." Id., at 1005. Accordingly, itfound the arbitration agreements unenforceable with respect
to respondents' RICO claims. Id., at 1007. The EleventhCircuit affirmed "for the reasons set forth in [the District
Court's] comprehensive opinion," In re: Humana Inc. Managed Care Litigation, 285 F. 3d 971, 973 (2002), and wegranted certiorari, 537 U. S. 946 (2002).

II
Petitioners argue that whether the remedial limitationsrender their arbitration agreements unenforceable is not a

question of "arbitrability," and hence should have been de-cided by an arbitrator, rather than a court, in the first in538US2 Unit: $U40 [12-24-03 15:33:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN
404 PACIFICARE HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC. v. BOOK

Opinion of the Court
stance. They also claim that even if this question is one ofarbitrability, and is therefore properly within the purview

of the courts at this time, the remedial limitations at issuedo not require invalidation of their arbitration agreements.
Either way, petitioners contend, the lower courts shouldhave compelled arbitration. We conclude that it would be
premature for us to address these questions at this time.

Our decision in Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros, S. A. v. M/V
Sky Reefer, 515 U. S. 528 (1995), supplies the analytic framework for assessing the ripeness of this dispute. In Vimar,we dealt with a bill of lading concerning a shipment of goods

from Morocco to Massachusetts. Upon receipt of the goods,
the purchaser discovered that they had been damaged, and,
along with its insurer (Vimar), filed suit against the shipper.
The shipper sought to compel arbitration, relying on choiceof-law and arbitration clauses in the bill of lading under
which disputes arising out of the parties' agreement were to
be governed by Japanese law and resolved through arbitration before the Tokyo Maritime Arbitration Commission.
Vimar countered by arguing that the arbitration clause violated the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), 46 U. S. C.
App. $ 1300 et seq., and hence was unenforceable. 515 U. S.,
at 531-532. In particular, Vimar claimed that "there is no
guarantee foreign arbitrators will apply COGSA"; that the
foreign arbitrator was likely to apply rules of Japanese law
under which respondents' liability might be less than what it
would be under COGSA; and that this would violate "[t]he
central guarantee of [COGSA] $ 3(8) . . . that the terms of a
bill of lading may not relieve the carrier of obligations or
diminish the legal duties specified by the Act." Id., at 539.

Notwithstanding Vimar's insistence that the arbitration
agreement violated federal policy as embodied in COGSA,
we declined to reach the issue and held that the arbitration
clause was, at least initially, enforceable. "At this interlocutory stage," we explained, "it is not established what law the
arbitrators will apply to petitioner's claims or that petitioner

538US2 Unit: $U40 [12-24-03 15:33:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

405Cite as: 538 U. S. 401 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
will receive diminished protection as a result. The arbitra-tors may conclude that COGSA applies of its own force or

that Japanese law does not apply so that, under anotherclause of the bill of lading, COGSA controls."

Id., at 540.
We further emphasized that "mere speculation that the for-eign arbitrators

might apply Japanese law which, depending
on the proper construction of COGSA, might reduce respondents' legal obligations, does not in and of itself lessenliability under COGSA $ 3(8)," nor did it provide an adequate

basis upon which to declare the relevant arbitration agree-ment unenforceable.

Id., at 541 (emphases added). We
found that "[w]hatever the merits of petitioner's comparative
reading of COGSA and its Japanese counterpart, its claim is
premature." Id., at 540.

The case at bar arrives in a similar posture. Two of the
four arbitration agreements at issue provide that "punitive
damages shall not be awarded [in arbitration]," App. 107,
147; one provides that "[t]he arbitrators . . . shall have no
authority to award any punitive or exemplary damages," id.,
at 212; and one provides that "[t]he arbitrators . . . shall
have no authority to award extra contractual damages of any
kind, including punitive or exemplary damages . . . ," id., at
168. Respondents insist, and the District Court agreed, 132
F. Supp. 2d, at 1000-1001, 1005, that these provisions preclude an arbitrator from awarding treble damages under
RICO. We think that neither our precedents nor the ambiguous terms of the contracts make this clear.

Our cases have placed different statutory treble-damages
provisions on different points along the spectrum between
purely compensatory and strictly punitive awards. Thus, in
Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States
ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S. 765, 784 (2000), we characterized
the treble-damages provision of the False Claims Act, 31
U. S. C. $$ 3729-3733, as "essentially punitive in nature." In
Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U. S. 477,
485 (1977), on the other hand, we explained that the treble538US2 Unit: $U40 [12-24-03 15:33:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN
406 PACIFICARE HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC. v. BOOK

Opinion of the Court
damages provision of $ 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 15,"is in essence a remedial provision." Likewise in American

Soc. of Mechanical Engineers, Inc. v. Hydrolevel Corp., 456U. S. 556, 575 (1982), we noted that "the antitrust private
action [which allows for treble damages] was created primar-ily as a remedy for the victims of antitrust violations."
(Emphasis added.) And earlier this Term, in Cook Countyv.

United States ex rel. Chandler, ante, at 130, we statedthat "it is important to realize that treble damages have a

compensatory side, serving remedial purposes in addition topunitive objectives." Indeed, we have repeatedly acknowledged that the treble-damages provision contained in RICOitself is remedial in nature. In Agency Holding Corp. v.
Malley-Duff & Associates, Inc., 483 U. S. 143, 151 (1987), westated that "[b]oth RICO and the Clayton Act are designed
to remedy economic injury by providing for the recovery oftreble damages, costs, and attorney's fees." (Emphasis
added.) And in Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 241 (1987) we took note of the "remedialfunction" of RICO's treble-damages provision.

In light of our case law's treatment of statutory trebledamages, and given the uncertainty surrounding the parties'
intent with respect to the contractual term "punitive," 1 theapplication of the disputed language to respondents' RICO
claims is, to say the least, in doubt. And Vimar instructsthat we should not, on the basis of "mere speculation" that
an arbitrator might interpret these ambiguous agreements

1 Contrary to respondents' contention, the prohibition in Dr. Manual
Porth's contract against an arbitrator's awarding "extracontractual" damages is likewise ambiguous. This language might mean, as respondents
would have it, that an arbitrator is prohibited from awarding any damages
other than for breach of contract. Brief for Respondents 20-21. But
it might only mean that an arbitrator cannot award noneconomic damages
such as punitive or mental-anguish damages. See 3 D. Dobbs, Law of
Remedies: Damages-Equity-Restitution $ 12.1(1), p. 8 (2d ed. 1993) ("Punitive damages and mental anguish damages are thus considered `extracontractual,' and usually denied in pure contract cases").

Opinion of the Court
in a manner that casts their enforceability into doubt, takeupon ourselves the authority to decide the antecedent question of how the ambiguity is to be resolved.2 515 U. S., at541. In short, since we do not know how the arbitrator will
construe the remedial limitations, the questions whetherthey render the parties' agreements unenforceable and
whether it is for courts or arbitrators to decide enforceabilityin the first instance are unusually abstract. As in

Vimar,the proper course is to compel arbitration. The judgment

of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remandedfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Thomas took no part in the consideration or deci-sion of this case.

2 If the contractual ambiguity could itself be characterized as raising a
"gateway" question of arbitrability, then it would be appropriate for a
court to answer it in the first instance. But we noted just this Term that
"the phrase `question of arbitrability' has a . . . limited scope." Howsam
v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79, 83 (2002). Indeed, we have
"found the phrase [question of arbitrability] applicable in the kind of narrow circumstance where contracting parties would likely have expected a
court to have decided the gateway matter, where they are not likely to
have thought that they had agreed that an arbitrator would do so, and,
consequently, where reference of the gateway dispute to the court avoids
the risk of forcing parties to arbitrate a matter that they may well not
have agreed to arbitrate." Id., at 83-84. Given our presumption in favor
of arbitration, Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr.
Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 24-25 (1983), we think the preliminary question whether
the remedial limitations at issue here prohibit an award of RICO treble
damages is not a question of arbitrability.

STATE FARM MUTUAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCECO.

v. CAMPBELL et al.

certiorari to the supreme court of utah
No. 01-1289. Argued December 11, 2002--Decided April 7, 2003
Although investigators and witnesses concluded that Curtis Campbell

caused an accident in which one person was killed and another permanently disabled, his insurer, petitioner State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Company (State Farm), contested liability, declined to settle
the ensuing claims for the $50,000 policy limit, ignored its own investigators' advice, and took the case to trial, assuring Campbell and his wife
that they had no liability for the accident, that State Farm would represent their interests, and that they did not need separate counsel. In
fact, a Utah jury returned a judgment for over three times the policy
limit, and State Farm refused to appeal. The Utah Supreme Court
denied Campbell's own appeal, and State Farm paid the entire judgment. The Campbells then sued State Farm for bad faith, fraud, and
intentional infliction of emotional distress. The trial court's initial ruling granting State Farm summary judgment was reversed on appeal.
On remand, the court denied State Farm's motion to exclude evidence
of dissimilar out-of-state conduct. In the first phase of a bifurcated
trial, the jury found unreasonable State Farm's decision not to settle.
Before the second phase, this Court refused, in BMW of North America,
Inc. v. Gore, 517 U. S. 559, to sustain a $2 million punitive damages
award which accompanied a $4,000 compensatory damages award. The
trial court denied State Farm's renewed motion to exclude dissimilar
out-of-state conduct evidence. In the second phase, which addressed,
inter alia, compensatory and punitive damages, evidence was introduced that pertained to State Farm's business practices in numerous
States but bore no relation to the type of claims underlying the Campbells' complaint. The jury awarded the Campbells $2.6 million in compensatory damages and $145 million in punitive damages, which the trial
court reduced to $1 million and $25 million respectively. Applying
Gore, the Utah Supreme Court reinstated the $145 million punitive damages award.

Held: A punitive damages award of $145 million, where full compensatory

damages are $1 million, is excessive and violates the Due Process Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 416-429.

of deterrence and retribution. The Due Process Clause prohibits the
imposition of grossly excessive or arbitrary punishments on a tortfeaser.
E. g., Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc., 532 U. S.
424, 433. Punitive damages awards serve the same purpose as criminal
penalties. However, because civil defendants are not accorded the protections afforded criminal defendants, punitive damages pose an acute
danger of arbitrary deprivation of property, which is heightened when
the decisionmaker is presented with evidence having little bearing on
the amount that should be awarded. Thus, this Court has instructed
courts reviewing punitive damages to consider (1) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's misconduct, (2) the disparity between
the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive
damages award, and (3) the difference between the punitive damages
awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed
in comparable cases. Gore, supra, at 575. A trial court's application
of these guideposts is subject to de novo review. Cooper Industries,
supra, at 424. Pp. 416-418.

(b) Under Gore's guideposts, this case is neither close nor difficult.
Pp. 418-428.

(1) To determine a defendant's reprehensibility--the most important indicium of a punitive damages award's reasonableness--a court
must consider whether: the harm was physical rather than economic;
the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard
of the health or safety of others; the conduct involved repeated actions
or was an isolated incident; and the harm resulted from intentional malice, trickery, or deceit, or mere accident. Gore, 517 U. S., at 576-577.
It should be presumed that a plaintiff has been made whole by compensatory damages, so punitive damages should be awarded only if the
defendant's culpability is so reprehensible to warrant the imposition
of further sanctions to achieve punishment or deterrence. Id., at 575.
In this case, State Farm's handling of the claims against the Campbells
merits no praise, but a more modest punishment could have satisfied the
State's legitimate objectives. Instead, this case was used as a platform to expose, and punish, the perceived deficiencies of State Farm's
operations throughout the country. However, a State cannot punish
a defendant for conduct that may have been lawful where it occurred,
id., at 572. Nor does the State have a legitimate concern in imposing
punitive damages to punish a defendant for unlawful acts committed
outside of its jurisdiction. The Campbells argue that such evidence was
used merely to demonstrate, generally, State Farm's motives against its
insured. Lawful out-of-state conduct may be probative when it demonstrates the deliberateness and culpability of the defendant's action in
the State where it is tortious, but that conduct must have a nexus to

v. CAMPBELL

Syllabus

the specific harm suffered by the plaintiff. More fundamentally, in relying on such evidence, the Utah courts awarded punitive damages to
punish and deter conduct that bore no relation to the Campbells' harm.
Due process does not permit courts to adjudicate the merits of other
parties' hypothetical claims under the guise of the reprehensibility analysis. Punishment on these bases creates the possibility of multiple punitive damages awards for the same conduct, for nonparties are not normally bound by another plaintiff's judgment. For the same reasons,
the Utah Supreme Court's decision cannot be justified on the grounds
that State Farm was a recidivist. To justify punishment based upon
recidivism, courts must ensure the conduct in question replicates the
prior transgressions. There is scant evidence of repeated misconduct
of the sort that injured the Campbells, and a review of the decisions
below does not convince this Court that State Farm was only punished
for its actions toward the Campbells. Because the Campbells have
shown no conduct similar to that which harmed them, the only relevant
conduct to the reprehensibility analysis is that which harmed them.
Pp. 419-424.

(2) With regard to the second Gore guidepost, the Court has been
reluctant to identify concrete constitutional limits on the ratio between
harm, or potential harm, to the plaintiff and the punitive damages
award; but, in practice, few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages will satisfy due process.
See, e. g., 517 U. S., at 581. Single-digit multipliers are more likely to
comport with due process, while still achieving the State's deterrence
and retribution goals, than are awards with 145-to-1 ratios, as in this
case. Because there are no rigid benchmarks, ratios greater than those
that this Court has previously upheld may comport with due process
where a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount
of economic damages, id., at 582, but when compensatory damages are
substantial, then an even lesser ratio can reach the outermost limit of
the due process guarantee. Here, there is a presumption against an
award with a 145-to-1 ratio; the $1 million compensatory award for a
year and a half of emotional distress was substantial; and the distress
caused by outrage and humiliation the Campbells suffered is likely a
component of both the compensatory and punitive damages awards.
The Utah Supreme Court sought to justify the massive award based on
premises bearing no relation to the award's reasonableness or proportionality to the harm. Pp. 424-428.

(3) The Court need not dwell on the third guidepost. The most
relevant civil sanction under Utah state law for the wrong done to the
Campbells appears to be a $10,000 fine for an act of grand fraud, which

Syllabus
is dwarfed by the $145 million punitive damages award. The Utah Supreme Court's references to a broad fraudulent scheme drawn from outof-state and dissimilar conduct evidence were insufficient to justify this
amount. P. 428.

(c) Applying Gore's guideposts to the facts here, especially in light
of the substantial compensatory damages award, likely would justify a
punitive damages award at or near the compensatory damages amount.
The Utah courts should resolve in the first instance the proper punitive
damages calculation under the principles discussed here. P. 429.

v. CAMPBELL

Opinion of the Court

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
We address once again the measure of punishment, bymeans of punitive damages, a State may impose upon a defendant in a civil case. The question is whether, in the cir-cumstances we shall recount, an award of $145 million in punitive damages, where full compensatory damages are $1million, is excessive and in violation of the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution ofthe United States.

In 1981, Curtis Campbell (Campbell) was driving with hiswife, Inez Preece Campbell, in Cache County, Utah. He decided to pass six vans traveling ahead of them on a two-lanehighway. Todd Ospital was driving a small car approaching
from the opposite direction. To avoid a head-on collisionwith Campbell, who by then was driving on the wrong side
of the highway and toward oncoming traffic, Ospital swervedonto the shoulder, lost control of his automobile, and colVictor E. Schwartz and Leah Lorber; for the Washington Legal Foundation et al. by Arvin Maskin, Daniel J. Popeo, and Paul D. Kamenar; and

Opinion of the Court
lided with a vehicle driven by Robert G. Slusher. Ospitalwas killed, and Slusher was rendered permanently disabled.

The Campbells escaped unscathed.In the ensuing wrongful death and tort action, Campbell
insisted he was not at fault. Early investigations did sup-port differing conclusions as to who caused the accident, but
"a consensus was reached early on by the investigators and
witnesses that Mr. Campbell's unsafe pass had indeed causedthe crash." 65 P. 3d 1134, 1141 (Utah 2001). Campbell's insurance company, petitioner State Farm Mutual AutomobileInsurance Company (State Farm), nonetheless decided to
contest liability and declined offers by Slusher and Ospital's
estate (Ospital) to settle the claims for the policy limit of
$50,000 ($25,000 per claimant). State Farm also ignored the
advice of one of its own investigators and took the case to
trial, assuring the Campbells that "their assets were safe,
that they had no liability for the accident, that [State Farm]
would represent their interests, and that they did not need
to procure separate counsel." Id., at 1142. To the contrary,
a jury determined that Campbell was 100 percent at fault,
and a judgment was returned for $185,849, far more than the
amount offered in settlement.

At first State Farm refused to cover the $135,849 in excess
liability. Its counsel made this clear to the Campbells: " `You
may want to put for sale signs on your property to get things
moving.' " Ibid. Nor was State Farm willing to post a supersedeas bond to allow Campbell to appeal the judgment
against him. Campbell obtained his own counsel to appeal
the verdict. During the pendency of the appeal, in late 1984,
Slusher, Ospital, and the Campbells reached an agreement
whereby Slusher and Ospital agreed not to seek satisfaction
of their claims against the Campbells. In exchange the
Campbells agreed to pursue a bad-faith action against State
Farm and to be represented by Slusher's and Ospital's attorneys. The Campbells also agreed that Slusher and Ospital
would have a right to play a part in all major decisions con538US2 Unit: $U41 [10-27-04 10:05:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN
414 STATE FARM MUT. AUTOMOBILE INS. CO.

v. CAMPBELL

Opinion of the Court

cerning the bad-faith action. No settlement could be con-cluded without Slusher's and Ospital's approval, and Slusher

and Ospital would receive 90 percent of any verdict againstState Farm.

In 1989, the Utah Supreme Court denied Campbell's ap-peal in the wrongful-death and tort actions. Slusher v. Ospital, 777 P. 2d 437. State Farm then paid the entire judg-ment, including the amounts in excess of the policy limits.
The Campbells nonetheless filed a complaint against StateFarm alleging bad faith, fraud, and intentional infliction of
emotional distress. The trial court initially granted StateFarm's motion for summary judgment because State Farm
had paid the excess verdict, but that ruling was reversed onappeal. 840 P. 2d 130 (Utah App. 1992). On remand State
Farm moved in limine to exclude evidence of alleged con-duct that occurred in unrelated cases outside of Utah, but
the trial court denied the motion. At State Farm's requestthe trial court bifurcated the trial into two phases conducted
before different juries. In the first phase the jury deter-mined that State Farm's decision not to settle was unreasonable because there was a substantial likelihood of an excessverdict.

Before the second phase of the action against State Farmwe decided BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U. S.
559 (1996), and refused to sustain a $2 million punitive dam-ages award which accompanied a verdict of only $4,000 in
compensatory damages. Based on that decision, State Farmagain moved for the exclusion of evidence of dissimilar outof-state conduct. App. to Pet. for Cert. 168a-172a. Thetrial court denied State Farm's motion. Id., at 189a.

The second phase addressed State Farm's liability forfraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress, as well
as compensatory and punitive damages. The Utah SupremeCourt aptly characterized this phase of the trial:

"State Farm argued during phase II that its decision totake the case to trial was an `honest mistake' that did

538US2 Unit: $U41 [10-27-04 10:05:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

415Cite as: 538 U. S. 408 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
not warrant punitive damages. In contrast, the Camp-bells introduced evidence that State Farm's decision to

take the case to trial was a result of a national scheme tomeet corporate fiscal goals by capping payouts on claims
company wide. This scheme was referred to as StateFarm's `Performance, Planning and Review,' or PP & R,
policy. To prove the existence of this scheme, the trialcourt allowed the Campbells to introduce extensive expert testimony regarding fraudulent practices by StateFarm in its nation-wide operations. Although State
Farm moved prior to phase II of the trial for the exclu-sion of such evidence and continued to object to it at
trial, the trial court ruled that such evidence was admis-sible to determine whether State Farm's conduct in the
Campbell case was indeed intentional and sufficientlyegregious to warrant punitive damages." 65 P. 3d, at
1143.
Evidence pertaining to the PP&R policy concerned StateFarm's business practices for over 20 years in numerous

States. Most of these practices bore no relation to third-party automobile insurance claims, the type of claim underlying the Campbells' complaint against the company. Thejury awarded the Campbells $2.6 million in compensatory
damages and $145 million in punitive damages, which thetrial court reduced to $1 million and $25 million respectively.
Both parties appealed.The Utah Supreme Court sought to apply the three guideposts we identified in Gore, supra, at 574-575, and it rein-stated the $145 million punitive damages award. Relying in
large part on the extensive evidence concerning the PP&Rpolicy, the court concluded State Farm's conduct was reprehensible. The court also relied upon State Farm's "massivewealth" and on testimony indicating that "State Farm's actions, because of their clandestine nature, will be punished atmost in one out of every 50,000 cases as a matter of statistical
probability," 65 P. 3d, at 1153, and concluded that the ratio

Opinion of the Court

between punitive and compensatory damages was not un-warranted. Finally, the court noted that the punitive damages award was not excessive when compared to various civiland criminal penalties State Farm could have faced, including $10,000 for each act of fraud, the suspension of its licenseto conduct business in Utah, the disgorgement of profits, and
imprisonment. Id., at 1154-1155. We granted certiorari.535 U. S. 1111 (2002).

II
We recognized in Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Leatherman
Tool Group, Inc., 532 U. S. 424 (2001), that in our judicialsystem compensatory and punitive damages, although usually awarded at the same time by the same decisionmaker,serve different purposes.

Id., at 432. Compensatory dam-ages "are intended to redress the concrete loss that the plaintiff has suffered by reason of the defendant's wrongful con-duct." Ibid. (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 903,
pp. 453-454 (1979)). By contrast, punitive damages serve abroader function; they are aimed at deterrence and retribution. Cooper Industries, supra, at 432; see also Gore, supra,at 568 ("Punitive damages may properly be imposed to further a State's legitimate interests in punishing unlawful con-duct and deterring its repetition"); Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co.
v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1, 19 (1991) ("[P]unitive damages are im-posed for purposes of retribution and deterrence").

While States possess discretion over the imposition of pu-nitive damages, it is well established that there are procedural and substantive constitutional limitations on theseawards.

Cooper Industries, supra; Gore, supra, at 559;Honda Motor Co. v. Oberg, 512 U. S. 415 (1994); TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U. S. 443 (1993);Haslip, supra. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment prohibits the imposition of grossly excessive orarbitrary punishments on a tortfeasor. Cooper Industries,
supra, at 433; Gore, 517 U. S., at 562; see also id., at 587(

Breyer, J., concurring) ("This constitutional concern, itself

Opinion of the Court
harkening back to the Magna Carta, arises out of the basicunfairness of depriving citizens of life, liberty, or property,

through the application, not of law and legal processes, butof arbitrary coercion"). The reason is that "[e]lementary notions of fairness enshrined in our constitutional jurispru-dence dictate that a person receive fair notice not only of the
conduct that will subject him to punishment, but also of the
severity of the penalty that a State may impose." Id., at574;

Cooper Industries, supra, at 433 ("Despite the broad
discretion that States possess with respect to the impositionof criminal penalties and punitive damages, the Due Process

Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution imposes substantive limits on that discretion"). To
the extent an award is grossly excessive, it furthers no legitimate purpose and constitutes an arbitrary deprivation of
property. Haslip, supra, at 42 (O'Connor, J., dissenting)
("Punitive damages are a powerful weapon. Imposed wisely
and with restraint, they have the potential to advance legitimate state interests. Imposed indiscriminately, however,
they have a devastating potential for harm. Regrettably,
common-law procedures for awarding punitive damages fall
into the latter category").

Although these awards serve the same purposes as criminal penalties, defendants subjected to punitive damages in
civil cases have not been accorded the protections applicable
in a criminal proceeding. This increases our concerns over
the imprecise manner in which punitive damages systems
are administered. We have admonished that "[p]unitive
damages pose an acute danger of arbitrary deprivation of
property. Jury instructions typically leave the jury with
wide discretion in choosing amounts, and the presentation of
evidence of a defendant's net worth creates the potential that
juries will use their verdicts to express biases against big
businesses, particularly those without strong local presences." Honda Motor, supra, at 432; see also Haslip, supra,
at 59 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) ("[T]he Due Process Clause

v. CAMPBELL

Opinion of the Court

does not permit a State to classify arbitrariness as a virtue.Indeed, the point of due process--of the law in general--is

to allow citizens to order their behavior. A State can haveno legitimate interest in deliberately making the law so arbitrary that citizens will be unable to avoid punishment basedsolely upon bias or whim"). Our concerns are heightened
when the decisionmaker is presented, as we shall discuss,with evidence that has little bearing as to the amount of
punitive damages that should be awarded. Vague instruc-tions, or those that merely inform the jury to avoid "passion
or prejudice," App. to Pet. for Cert. 108a-109a, do little toaid the decisionmaker in its task of assigning appropriate
weight to evidence that is relevant and evidence that is tan-gential or only inflammatory.

In light of these concerns, in Gore, supra, we instructedcourts reviewing punitive damages to consider three guideposts: (1) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant'smisconduct; (2) the disparity between the actual or potential
harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damagesaward; and (3) the difference between the punitive damages
awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized orimposed in comparable cases. Id., at 575. We reiterated
the importance of these three guideposts in Cooper Indus-tries and mandated appellate courts to conduct de novo review of a trial court's application of them to the jury's award.532 U. S. 424. Exacting appellate review ensures that an
award of punitive damages is based upon an " `applicationof law, rather than a decisionmaker's caprice.' " Id., at 436
(quoting Gore, supra, at 587 (Breyer, J., concurring)).

III
Under the principles outlined in BMW of North America,
Inc. v. Gore, this case is neither close nor difficult. It waserror to reinstate the jury's $145 million punitive damages

award. We address each guidepost of Gore in some detail.

Opinion of the Court

A
"[T]he most important indicium of the reasonableness of apunitive damages award is the degree of reprehensibility of

the defendant's conduct." Gore, 517 U. S., at 575. We haveinstructed courts to determine the reprehensibility of a defendant by considering whether: the harm caused was physi-cal as opposed to economic; the tortious conduct evinced an
indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safetyof others; the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability; the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolatedincident; and the harm was the result of intentional malice,
trickery, or deceit, or mere accident. Id., at 576-577. Theexistence of any one of these factors weighing in favor of a
plaintiff may not be sufficient to sustain a punitive damagesaward; and the absence of all of them renders any award
suspect. It should be presumed a plaintiff has been madewhole for his injuries by compensatory damages, so punitive
damages should only be awarded if the defendant's culpabil-ity, after having paid compensatory damages, is so reprehensible as to warrant the imposition of further sanctions toachieve punishment or deterrence. Id., at 575.

Applying these factors in the instant case, we must ac-knowledge that State Farm's handling of the claims against
the Campbells merits no praise. The trial court found thatState Farm's employees altered the company's records to
make Campbell appear less culpable. State Farm disregarded the overwhelming likelihood of liability and thenear-certain probability that, by taking the case to trial, a

judgment in excess of the policy limits would be awarded.State Farm amplified the harm by at first assuring the
Campbells their assets would be safe from any verdict andby later telling them, postjudgment, to put a for-sale sign
on their house. While we do not suggest there was error inawarding punitive damages based upon State Farm's conduct
toward the Campbells, a more modest punishment for this

v. CAMPBELL

Opinion of the Court

reprehensible conduct could have satisfied the State's legiti-mate objectives, and the Utah courts should have gone no

further.This case, instead, was used as a platform to expose, and
punish, the perceived deficiencies of State Farm's operationsthroughout the country. The Utah Supreme Court's opinion
makes explicit that State Farm was being condemned for its
nationwide policies rather than for the conduct directed to-ward the Campbells. 65 P. 3d, at 1143 ("[T]he Campbells

introduced evidence that State Farm's decision to take thecase to trial was a result of a national scheme to meet corporate fiscal goals by capping payouts on claims company
wide"). This was, as well, an explicit rationale of the trial
court's decision in approving the award, though reduced from
$145 million to $25 million. App. to Pet. for Cert. 120a
("[T]he Campbells demonstrated, through the testimony of
State Farm employees who had worked outside of Utah, and
through expert testimony, that this pattern of claims adjustment under the PP&R program was not a local anomaly, but
was a consistent, nationwide feature of State Farm's business operations, orchestrated from the highest levels of corporate management").

The Campbells contend that State Farm has only itself to
blame for the reliance upon dissimilar and out-of-state conduct evidence. The record does not support this contention.
From their opening statements onward the Campbells
framed this case as a chance to rebuke State Farm for its
nationwide activities. App. 208 ("You're going to hear evidence that even the insurance commission in Utah and
around the country are unwilling or inept at protecting people against abuses"); id., at 242 ("[T]his is a very important
case. . . . [I]t transcends the Campbell file. It involves a
nationwide practice. And you, here, are going to be evaluating and assessing, and hopefully requiring State Farm to
stand accountable for what it's doing across the country,
which is the purpose of punitive damages"). This was a po538US2 Unit: $U41 [10-27-04 10:05:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

421Cite as: 538 U. S. 408 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
sition maintained throughout the litigation. In opposingState Farm's motion to exclude such evidence under

Gore,
the Campbells' counsel convinced the trial court that therewas no limitation on the scope of evidence that could be considered under our precedents. App. to Pet. for Cert. 172a("As I read the case

[Gore], I was struck with the fact that
a clear message in the case . . . seems to be that courts in
punitive damages cases should receive more evidence, notless. And that the court seems to be inviting an even

broader area of evidence than the current rulings of thecourt would indicate");

id., at 189a (trial court ruling).
A State cannot punish a defendant for conduct that may
have been lawful where it occurred. Gore, supra, at 572;
Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809, 824 (1975) ("A State does
not acquire power or supervision over the internal affairs of
another State merely because the welfare and health of its
own citizens may be affected when they travel to that
State"); New York Life Ins. Co. v. Head, 234 U. S. 149, 161
(1914) ("[I]t would be impossible to permit the statutes of
Missouri to operate beyond the jurisdiction of that State . . .
without throwing down the constitutional barriers by which
all the States are restricted within the orbits of their lawful
authority and upon the preservation of which the Government under the Constitution depends. This is so obviously
the necessary result of the Constitution that it has rarely
been called in question and hence authorities directly dealing
with it do not abound"); Huntington v. Attrill, 146 U. S. 657,
669 (1892) ("Laws have no force of themselves beyond the
jurisdiction of the State which enacts them, and can have
extra-territorial effect only by the comity of other States").
Nor, as a general rule, does a State have a legitimate concern
in imposing punitive damages to punish a defendant for unlawful acts committed outside of the State's jurisdiction.
Any proper adjudication of conduct that occurred outside
Utah to other persons would require their inclusion, and, to
those parties, the Utah courts, in the usual case, would need

v. CAMPBELL

Opinion of the Court

to apply the laws of their relevant jurisdiction. Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U. S. 797, 821-822 (1985).

Here, the Campbells do not dispute that much of the out-of-state conduct was lawful where it occurred. They argue,

however, that such evidence was not the primary basis forthe punitive damages award and was relevant to the extent
it demonstrated, in a general sense, State Farm's motive
against its insured. Brief for Respondents 46-47 ("[E]venif the practices described by State Farm were not malum in

se or malum prohibitum, they became relevant to punitivedamages to the extent they were used as tools to implement
State Farm's wrongful PP&R policy"). This argument
misses the mark. Lawful out-of-state conduct may be probative when it demonstrates the deliberateness and culpability of the defendant's action in the State where it is tortious,
but that conduct must have a nexus to the specific harm suffered by the plaintiff. A jury must be instructed, furthermore, that it may not use evidence of out-of-state conduct to
punish a defendant for action that was lawful in the jurisdiction where it occurred. Gore, 517 U. S., at 572-573 (noting
that a State "does not have the power . . . to punish [a defendant] for conduct that was lawful where it occurred and that
had no impact on [the State] or its residents"). A basic principle of federalism is that each State may make its own
reasoned judgment about what conduct is permitted or
proscribed within its borders, and each State alone can
determine what measure of punishment, if any, to impose on
a defendant who acts within its jurisdiction. Id., at 569
("[T]he States need not, and in fact do not, provide such protection in a uniform manner").

For a more fundamental reason, however, the Utah courts
erred in relying upon this and other evidence: The courts
awarded punitive damages to punish and deter conduct that
bore no relation to the Campbells' harm. A defendant's dissimilar acts, independent from the acts upon which liability
was premised, may not serve as the basis for punitive dam538US2 Unit: $U41 [10-27-04 10:05:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ages. A defendant should be punished for the conduct thatharmed the plaintiff, not for being an unsavory individual or

business. Due process does not permit courts, in the calcu-lation of punitive damages, to adjudicate the merits of other
parties' hypothetical claims against a defendant under theguise of the reprehensibility analysis, but we have no doubt
the Utah Supreme Court did that here. 65 P. 3d, at 1149
("Even if the harm to the Campbells can be appropriatelycharacterized as minimal, the trial court's assessment of the

situation is on target: `The harm is minor to the individualbut massive in the aggregate' "). Punishment on these
bases creates the possibility of multiple punitive damages
awards for the same conduct; for in the usual case nonparties
are not bound by the judgment some other plaintiff obtains.
Gore, supra, at 593 (Breyer, J., concurring) ("Larger damages might also `double count' by including in the punitive
damages award some of the compensatory, or punitive, damages that subsequent plaintiffs would also recover").

The same reasons lead us to conclude the Utah Supreme
Court's decision cannot be justified on the grounds that State
Farm was a recidivist. Although "[o]ur holdings that a recidivist may be punished more severely than a first offender
recognize that repeated misconduct is more reprehensible
than an individual instance of malfeasance," Gore, supra, at
577, in the context of civil actions courts must ensure the
conduct in question replicates the prior transgressions.
TXO, 509 U. S., at 462, n. 28 (noting that courts should look
to " `the existence and frequency of similar past conduct' "
(quoting Haslip, 499 U. S., at 21-22)).

The Campbells have identified scant evidence of repeated
misconduct of the sort that injured them. Nor does our review of the Utah courts' decisions convince us that State
Farm was only punished for its actions toward the Campbells. Although evidence of other acts need not be identical
to have relevance in the calculation of punitive damages, the
Utah court erred here because evidence pertaining to claims

v. CAMPBELL

Opinion of the Court

that had nothing to do with a third-party lawsuit was intro-duced at length. Other evidence concerning reprehensibility was even more tangential. For example, the Utah Su-preme Court criticized State Farm's investigation into the
personal life of one of its employees and, in a broader ap-proach, the manner in which State Farm's policies corrupted
its employees. 65 P. 3d, at 1148, 1150. The Campbells at-tempt to justify the courts' reliance upon this unrelated testimony on the theory that each dollar of profit made by under-paying a third-party claimant is the same as a dollar made
by underpaying a first-party one. Brief for Respondents 45;see also 65 P. 3d, at 1150 ("State Farm's continuing illicit
practice created market disadvantages for other honest in-surance companies because these practices increased profits.
As plaintiffs' expert witnesses established, such wrongfullyobtained competitive advantages have the potential to pressure other companies to adopt similar fraudulent tactics, orto force them out of business. Thus, such actions cause distortions throughout the insurance market and ultimatelyhurt all consumers"). For the reasons already stated, this
argument is unconvincing. The reprehensibility guidepostdoes not permit courts to expand the scope of the case so
that a defendant may be punished for any malfeasance, whichin this case extended for a 20-year period. In this case, because the Campbells have shown no conduct by State Farmsimilar to that which harmed them, the conduct that harmed
them is the only conduct relevant to the reprehensibilityanalysis.

B
Turning to the second Gore guidepost, we have been reluc-tant to identify concrete constitutional limits on the ratio

between harm, or potential harm, to the plaintiff and thepunitive damages award. 517 U. S., at 582 ("[W]e have consistently rejected the notion that the constitutional line ismarked by a simple mathematical formula, even one that
compares actual and potential damages to the punitive

Opinion of the Court
award"); TXO, supra, at 458. We decline again to imposea bright-line ratio which a punitive damages award cannot

exceed. Our jurisprudence and the principles it has nowestablished demonstrate, however, that, in practice, few
awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive andcompensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy
due process. In Haslip, in upholding a punitive damages
award, we concluded that an award of more than four timesthe amount of compensatory damages might be close to the

line of constitutional impropriety. 499 U. S., at 23-24. Wecited that 4-to-1 ratio again in

Gore. 517 U. S., at 581. The
Court further referenced a long legislative history, dating
back over 700 years and going forward to today, providing
for sanctions of double, treble, or quadruple damages to
deter and punish. Id., at 581, and n. 33. While these ratios
are not binding, they are instructive. They demonstrate
what should be obvious: Single-digit multipliers are more
likely to comport with due process, while still achieving the
State's goals of deterrence and retribution, than awards with
ratios in range of 500 to 1, id., at 582, or, in this case, of
145 to 1.

Nonetheless, because there are no rigid benchmarks that
a punitive damages award may not surpass, ratios greater
than those we have previously upheld may comport with due
process where "a particularly egregious act has resulted in
only a small amount of economic damages." Ibid.; see also
ibid. (positing that a higher ratio might be necessary where
"the injury is hard to detect or the monetary value of noneconomic harm might have been difficult to determine").
The converse is also true, however. When compensatory
damages are substantial, then a lesser ratio, perhaps only
equal to compensatory damages, can reach the outermost
limit of the due process guarantee. The precise award in
any case, of course, must be based upon the facts and circumstances of the defendant's conduct and the harm to the
plaintiff.

v. CAMPBELL

Opinion of the Court

In sum, courts must ensure that the measure of punish-ment is both reasonable and proportionate to the amount of

harm to the plaintiff and to the general damages recovered.In the context of this case, we have no doubt that there
is a presumption against an award that has a 145-to-1 ratio.The compensatory award in this case was substantial; the
Campbells were awarded $1 million for a year and a half of
emotional distress. This was complete compensation. Theharm arose from a transaction in the economic realm, not

from some physical assault or trauma; there were no physicalinjuries; and State Farm paid the excess verdict before the
complaint was filed, so the Campbells suffered only minor
economic injuries for the 18-month period in which State
Farm refused to resolve the claim against them. The compensatory damages for the injury suffered here, moreover,
likely were based on a component which was duplicated in
the punitive award. Much of the distress was caused by the
outrage and humiliation the Campbells suffered at the actions of their insurer; and it is a major role of punitive damages to condemn such conduct. Compensatory damages,
however, already contain this punitive element. See Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 908, Comment c, p. 466 (1977)
("In many cases in which compensatory damages include an
amount for emotional distress, such as humiliation or indignation aroused by the defendant's act, there is no clear line
of demarcation between punishment and compensation and a
verdict for a specified amount frequently includes elements
of both").

The Utah Supreme Court sought to justify the massive
award by pointing to State Farm's purported failure to report a prior $100 million punitive damages award in Texas
to its corporate headquarters; the fact that State Farm's policies have affected numerous Utah consumers; the fact that
State Farm will only be punished in one out of every 50,000
cases as a matter of statistical probability; and State Farm's
enormous wealth. 65 P. 3d, at 1153. Since the Supreme

Opinion of the Court
Court of Utah discussed the Texas award when applying theratio guidepost, we discuss it here. The Texas award, however, should have been analyzed in the context of the repre-hensibility guidepost only. The failure of the company to
report the Texas award is out-of-state conduct that, if theconduct were similar, might have had some bearing on the
degree of reprehensibility, subject to the limitations we have
described. Here, it was dissimilar, and of such marginal rel-evance that it should have been accorded little or no weight.

The award was rendered in a first-party lawsuit; no judg-ment was entered in the case; and it was later settled for a
fraction of the verdict. With respect to the Utah Supreme
Court's second justification, the Campbells' inability to direct
us to testimony demonstrating harm to the people of Utah
(other than those directly involved in this case) indicates that
the adverse effect on the State's general population was in
fact minor.

The remaining premises for the Utah Supreme Court's decision bear no relation to the award's reasonableness or proportionality to the harm. They are, rather, arguments that
seek to defend a departure from well-established constraints
on punitive damages. While States enjoy considerable discretion in deducing when punitive damages are warranted,
each award must comport with the principles set forth in
Gore. Here the argument that State Farm will be punished
in only the rare case, coupled with reference to its assets
(which, of course, are what other insured parties in Utah and
other States must rely upon for payment of claims) had little
to do with the actual harm sustained by the Campbells. The
wealth of a defendant cannot justify an otherwise unconstitutional punitive damages award. Gore, 517 U. S., at 585
("The fact that BMW is a large corporation rather than an
impecunious individual does not diminish its entitlement to
fair notice of the demands that the several States impose on
the conduct of its business"); see also id., at 591 (Breyer,
J., concurring) ("[Wealth] provides an open-ended basis for

Opinion of the Court

inflating awards when the defendant is wealthy . . . . Thatdoes not make its use unlawful or inappropriate; it simply

means that this factor cannot make up for the failure of otherfactors, such as `reprehensibility,' to constrain significantly
an award that purports to punish a defendant's conduct").The principles set forth in Gore must be implemented with
care, to ensure both reasonableness and proportionality.

C
The third guidepost in Gore is the disparity between thepunitive damages award and the "civil penalties authorized

or imposed in comparable cases." Id., at 575. We notethat, in the past, we have also looked to criminal penalties
that could be imposed. Id., at 583; Haslip, 499 U. S., at 23.The existence of a criminal penalty does have bearing on the
seriousness with which a State views the wrongful action.When used to determine the dollar amount of the award,
however, the criminal penalty has less utility. Great caremust be taken to avoid use of the civil process to assess criminal penalties that can be imposed only after the heightenedprotections of a criminal trial have been observed, including,
of course, its higher standards of proof. Punitive damagesare not a substitute for the criminal process, and the remote
possibility of a criminal sanction does not automatically sus-tain a punitive damages award.

Here, we need not dwell long on this guidepost. The mostrelevant civil sanction under Utah state law for the wrong
done to the Campbells appears to be a $10,000 fine for an actof fraud, 65 P. 3d, at 1154, an amount dwarfed by the $145
million punitive damages award. The Supreme Court ofUtah speculated about the loss of State Farm's business license, the disgorgement of profits, and possible imprison-ment, but here again its references were to the broad fraudulent scheme drawn from evidence of out-of-state anddissimilar conduct. This analysis was insufficient to justify
the award.

IV
An application of the Gore guideposts to the facts of thiscase, especially in light of the substantial compensatory damages awarded (a portion of which contained a punitive ele-ment), likely would justify a punitive damages award at or
near the amount of compensatory damages. The punitiveaward of $145 million, therefore, was neither reasonable nor
proportionate to the wrong committed, and it was an irratio-nal and arbitrary deprivation of the property of the defendant. The proper calculation of punitive damages under theprinciples we have discussed should be resolved, in the first
instance, by the Utah courts.The judgment of the Utah Supreme Court is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistentwith this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Ginsburg, dissenting.
Not long ago, this Court was hesitant to impose a federalcheck on state-court judgments awarding punitive damages.

In Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal,
Inc., 492 U. S. 257 (1989), the Court held that neither theExcessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment nor federal common law circumscribed awards of punitive damagesin civil cases between private parties.

Id., at 262-276, 277-280. Two years later, in Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip,

499 U. S. 1 (1991), the Court observed that "unlimited jury[or judicial] discretion . . . in the fixing of punitive damages
may invite extreme results that jar one's constitutional sensi-bilities," id., at 18; the Due Process Clause, the Court suggested, would attend to those sensibilities and guard againstunreasonable awards, id., at 17-24. Nevertheless, the Court
upheld a punitive damages award in Haslip "more than 4times the amount of compensatory damages, . . . more than
200 times [the plaintiff 's] out-of-pocket expenses," and "muchin excess of the fine that could be imposed."

Id., at 23.And in TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp.,

509 U. S. 443 (1993), the Court affirmed a state-court award"526 times greater than the actual damages awarded by the
jury." Id., at 453; 1 cf. Browning-Ferris, 492 U. S., at 262(ratio of punitive to compensatory damages over 100 to 1).

It was not until 1996, in BMW of North America, Inc. v.Gore, 517 U. S. 559, that the Court, for the first time, invalidated a state-court punitive damages assessment as un1 By switching the focus from the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages to the potential loss to the plaintiffs had the defendant succeeded in
its illicit scheme, the Court could describe the relevant ratio in TXO as 10
to 1. See BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U. S. 559, 581, and

reasonably large. See id., at 599 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Ifour activity in this domain is now "well established," see

ante, at 416, 427, it takes place on ground not long held.In Gore, I stated why I resisted the Court's foray into
punitive damages "territory traditionally within the States'domain." 517 U. S., at 612 (dissenting opinion). I adhere to
those views, and note again that, unlike federal habeas cor-pus review of state-court convictions under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254,
the Court "work[s] at this business [of checking state courts]alone," unaided by the participation of federal district courts
and courts of appeals. 517 U. S., at 613. It was once rec-ognized that "the laws of the particular State must suffice
[to superintend punitive damages awards] until judges or leg-islators authorized to do so initiate system-wide change."
Haslip, 499 U. S., at 42 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judg-ment). I would adhere to that traditional view.

I
The large size of the award upheld by the Utah SupremeCourt in this case indicates why damages-capping legislation

may be altogether fitting and proper. Neither the amount ofthe award nor the trial record, however, justifies this Court's
substitution of its judgment for that of Utah's competent de-cisionmakers. In this regard, I count it significant that, on
the key criterion "reprehensibility," there is a good dealmore to the story than the Court's abbreviated account tells.

Ample evidence allowed the jury to find that State Farm'streatment of the Campbells typified its "Performance, Planning and Review" (PP&R) program; implemented by topmanagement in 1979, the program had "the explicit objective
of using the claims-adjustment process as a profit center."App. to Pet. for Cert. 116a. "[T]he Campbells presented
considerable evidence," the trial court noted, documenting"that the PP&R program . . . has functioned, and continues
to function, as an unlawful scheme . . . to deny benefits owedconsumers by paying out less than fair value in order to meet

preset, arbitrary payout targets designed to enhance corpo-rate profits."

Id., at 118a-119a. That policy, the trial court
observed, was encompassing in scope; it "applied equally tothe handling of both third-party and first-party claims."

Id., at 119a. But cf. ante, at 423-424, 427 (suggesting thatState Farm's handling of first-party claims has "nothing to
do with a third-party lawsuit").

Evidence the jury could credit demonstrated that thePP&R program regularly and adversely affected Utah residents. Ray Summers, "the adjuster who handled the Camp-bell case and who was a State Farm employee in Utah for
almost twenty years," described several methods used by
State Farm to deny claimants fair benefits, for example, "falsifying or withholding of evidence in claim files." App. to
Pet. for Cert. 121a. A common tactic, Summers recounted,
was to "unjustly attac[k] the character, reputation and credibility of a claimant and mak[e] notations to that effect in the
claim file to create prejudice in the event the claim ever came
before a jury." Id., at 130a (internal quotation marks omitted). State Farm manager Bob Noxon, Summers testified,
resorted to a tactic of this order in the Campbell case when
he "instruct[ed] Summers to write in the file that Todd Ospital (who was killed in the accident) was speeding because
he was on his way to see a pregnant girlfriend." Ibid. In
truth, "[t]here was no pregnant girlfriend." Ibid. Expert
testimony noted by the trial court described these tactics as
"completely improper." Ibid.

The trial court also noted the testimony of two Utah State
Farm employees, Felix Jensen and Samantha Bird, both of
whom recalled "intolerable" and "recurrent" pressure to reduce payouts below fair value. Id., at 119a (internal quotation marks omitted). When Jensen complained to top managers, he was told to "get out of the kitchen" if he could not
take the heat; Bird was told she should be "more of a team
player. " Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). At
times, Bird said, she "was forced to commit dishonest acts

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
and to knowingly underpay claims." Id., at 120a. Eventually, Bird quit. Ibid. Utah managers superior to Bird,
the evidence indicated, were improperly influenced by the
PP&R program to encourage insurance underpayments.
For example, several documents evaluating the performance
of managers Noxon and Brown "contained explicit preset average payout goals." Ibid.

Regarding liability for verdicts in excess of policy limits,
the trial court referred to a State Farm document titled the
"Excess Liability Handbook"; written before the Campbell
accident, the handbook instructed adjusters to pad files with
"self-serving" documents, and to leave critical items out of
files, for example, evaluations of the insured's exposure. Id.,
at 127a-128a (internal quotation marks omitted). Divisional
superintendent Bill Brown used the handbook to train Utah
employees. Id., at 134a. While overseeing the Campbell
case, Brown ordered adjuster Summers to change the portions of his report indicating that Mr. Campbell was likely at
fault and that the settlement cost was correspondingly high.
Id., at 3a. The Campbells' case, according to expert testimony the trial court recited, "was a classic example of State
Farm's application of the improper practices taught in the
Excess Liability Handbook." Id., at 128a.

The trial court further determined that the jury could find
State Farm's policy "deliberately crafted" to prey on consumers who would be unlikely to defend themselves. Id., at
122a. In this regard, the trial court noted the testimony of
several former State Farm employees affirming that they
were trained to target "the weakest of the herd"--"the elderly, the poor, and other consumers who are least knowledgeable about their rights and thus most vulnerable to
trickery or deceit, or who have little money and hence have
no real alternative but to accept an inadequate offer to settle
a claim at much less than fair value." Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).

Ginsburg, J., dissenting

The Campbells themselves could be placed within the"weakest of the herd" category. The couple appeared economically vulnerable and emotionally fragile. App. 3360a-3361a (Order Denying State Farm's Motion for Judgment
NOV and New Trial Regarding Intentional Infliction ofEmotional Distress). At the time of State Farm's wrongful
conduct, "Mr. Campbell had residuary effects from a stroke
and Parkinson's disease." Id., at 3360a.To further insulate itself from liability, trial evidence indicated, State Farm made "systematic" efforts to destroy in-ternal company documents that might reveal its scheme,
App. to Pet. for Cert. 123a, efforts that directly affected the
Campbells, id., at 124a. For example, State Farm had
"a special historical department that contained a copy of all
past manuals on claim-handling practices and the dates on
which each section of each manual was changed." Ibid.
Yet in discovery proceedings, State Farm failed to produce
any claim-handling practice manuals for the years relevant
to the Campbells' bad-faith case. Id., at 124a-125a.

State Farm's inability to produce the manuals, it appeared
from the evidence, was not accidental. Documents retained
by former State Farm employee Samantha Bird, as well as
Bird's testimony, showed that while the Campbells' case was
pending, Janet Cammack, "an in-house attorney sent by top
State Farm management, conducted a meeting . . . in Utah
during which she instructed Utah claims management to
search their offices and destroy a wide range of material of
the sort that had proved damaging in bad-faith litigation in
the past--in particular, old claim-handling manuals, memos,
claim school notes, procedure guides and other similar documents." Id., at 125a. "These orders were followed even
though at least one meeting participant, Paul Short, was personally aware that these kinds of materials had been requested by the Campbells in this very case." Ibid.

Consistent with Bird's testimony, State Farm admitted
that it destroyed every single copy of claim-handling manu538US2 Unit: $U41 [10-27-04 10:05:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

als on file in its historical department as of 1988, even thoughthese documents could have been preserved at minimal

expense. Ibid. Fortuitously, the Campbells obtained acopy of the 1979 PP&R manual by subpoena from a former
employee. Id., at 132a. Although that manual has been re-quested in other cases, State Farm has never itself produced
the document. Ibid."As a final, related tactic," the trial court stated, the jury
could reasonably find that "in recent years State Farm hasgone to extraordinary lengths to stop damaging documents
from being created in the first place." Id., at 126a. StateFarm kept no records at all on excess verdicts in third-party
cases, or on bad-faith claims or attendant verdicts. Ibid.State Farm alleged "that it has no record of its punitive damage payments, even though such payments must be reportedto the [Internal Revenue Service] and in some states may
not be used to justify rate increases." Ibid. Regional VicePresident Buck Moskalski testified that "he would not report
a punitive damage verdict in [the Campbells'] case to highermanagement, as such reporting was not set out as part of
State Farm's management practices." Ibid.State Farm's "wrongful profit and evasion schemes," the
trial court underscored, were directly relevant to the Camp-bells' case, id., at 132a:

"The record fully supports the conclusion that the bad-faith claim handling that exposed the Campbells to an
excess verdict in 1983, and resulted in severe damagesto them, was a product of the unlawful profit scheme
that had been put in place by top management at StateFarm years earlier. The Campbells presented substantial evidence showing how State Farm's improper insist-ence on claims-handling employees' reducing their claim
payouts . . . regardless of the merits of each claim, mani-fested itself . . . in the Utah claims operations during
the period when the decisions were made not to offer tosettle the Campbell case for the $50,000 policy limits--

Ginsburg, J., dissenting

indeed, not to make any offer to settle at a lower
amount. This evidence established that high-level manager Bill Brown was under heavy pressure from the
PP&R scheme to control indemnity payouts during the
time period in question. In particular, when Brown declined to pay the excess verdict against Curtis Campbell, or even post a bond, he had a special need to keep
his year-end numbers down, since the State Farm incentive scheme meant that keeping those numbers down
was important to helping Brown get a much-desired
transfer to Colorado. . . . There was ample evidence that
the concepts taught in the Excess Liability Handbook,
including the dishonest alteration and manipulation of
claim files and the policy against posting any supersedeas bond for the full amount of an excess verdict, were
dutifully carried out in this case. . . . There was ample
basis for the jury to find that everything that had happened to the Campbells--when State Farm repeatedly
refused in bad-faith to settle for the $50,000 policy limits and went to trial, and then failed to pay the
`excess' verdict, or at least post a bond, after trial--was
a direct application of State Farm's overall profit
scheme, operating through Brown and others." Id., at
133a-134a.

State Farm's "policies and practices," the trial evidence
thus bore out, were "responsible for the injuries suffered by
the Campbells," and the means used to implement those policies could be found "callous, clandestine, fraudulent, and dishonest." Id., at 136a; see id., at 113a (finding "ample evidence" that State Farm's reprehensible corporate policies
were responsible for injuring "many other Utah consumers
during the past two decades"). The Utah Supreme Court,
relying on the trial court's record-based recitations, understandably characterized State Farm's behavior as "egregious
and malicious." Id., at 18a.

II
The Court dismisses the evidence describing and docu-menting State Farm's PP&R policy and practices as essentially irrelevant, bearing "no relation to the Campbells'harm."

Ante, at 422; see ante, at 424 ("conduct that harmed[the Campbells] is the only conduct relevant to the reprehensibility analysis"). It is hardly apparent why that should beso. What is infirm about the Campbells' theory that their
experience with State Farm exemplifies and reflects an over-arching underpayment scheme, one that caused "repeated
misconduct of the sort that injured them," ante, at 423?The Court's silence on that score is revealing: Once one recognizes that the Campbells did show "conduct by State Farmsimilar to that which harmed them,"

ante, at 424, it becomesimpossible to shrink the reprehensibility analysis to this sole

case, or to maintain, at odds with the determination of thetrial court, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 113a, that "the adverse
effect on the State's general population was in fact minor,"ante, at 427.

Evidence of out-of-state conduct, the Court acknowledges,may be "probative [even if the conduct is lawful in the State
where it occurred] when it demonstrates the deliberatenessand culpability of the defendant's action in the State where
it is tortious. . . ." Ante, at 422; cf. ante, at 419 (reiteratingthis Court's instruction that trial courts assess whether "the
harm was the result of intentional malice, trickery, or deceit,or mere accident"). "Other acts" evidence concerning practices both in and out of State was introduced in this caseto show just such "deliberateness" and "culpability." The
evidence was admissible, the trial court ruled: (1) to docu-ment State Farm's "reprehensible" PP&R program; and
(2) to "rebut [State Farm's] assertion that [its] actions to-ward the Campbells were inadvertent errors or mistakes in
judgment." App. 3329a (Order Denying Various Motions ofState Farm to Exclude Plaintiffs' Evidence). Viewed in this
light, there surely was "a nexus" between much of the "other

When the Court first ventured to override state-court pu-nitive damages awards, it did so moderately. The Court recalled that "[i]n our federal system, States necessarily haveconsiderable flexibility in determining the level of punitive
damages that they will allow in different classes of cases andin any particular case."

Gore, 517 U. S., at 568. Today's de-cision exhibits no such respect and restraint. No longer

content to accord state-court judgments "a strong presump-tion of validity,"

TXO, 509 U. S., at 457, the Court announcesthat "few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree,will satisfy due process." Ante, at 425.

2 Moreover, the

Court adds, when compensatory damages are substantial,doubling those damages "can reach the outermost limit of

the due process guarantee." Ibid.; see ante, at 429 ("factsof this case . . . likely would justify a punitive damages award
at or near the amount of compensatory damages"). In a leg-islative scheme or a state high court's design to cap punitive
damages, the handiwork in setting single-digit and 1-to-1benchmarks could hardly be questioned; in a judicial decree
imposed on the States by this Court under the banner ofsubstantive due process, the numerical controls today's decision installs seem to me boldly out of order.

I remain of the view that this Court has no warrant toreform state law governing awards of punitive damages.

2 TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U. S. 443, 462,
n. 8 (1993), noted that "[u]nder well-settled law," a defendant's "wrongdoing in other parts of the country" and its "impressive net worth" are factors "typically considered in assessing punitive damages." It remains to
be seen whether, or the extent to which, today's decision will unsettle
that law.

v. WELLS

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 01-1435. Argued February 25, 2003--Decided April 22, 2003
Respondent filed suit alleging that petitioner medical clinic violated the

Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA or Act) when it terminated her employment. Petitioner moved for summary judgment, asserting that it was not covered by the Act because it did not have 15 or
more employees for the 20 weeks required by the ADA. That assertion's accuracy depends on whether the four physician-shareholders who
own the professional corporation and constitute its board of directors
are counted as employees. In granting the motion, the District Court
concluded that the physicians were more analogous to partners in a
partnership than to shareholders in a corporation and therefore were
not employees under the ADA. The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding no
reason to permit a professional corporation to reap the tax and civil
liability advantages of its corporate status and then argue that it is like
a partnership so as to avoid employment discrimination liability.

Held:

1. The common-law element of control is the principal guidepost to be
followed in deciding whether the four director-shareholder physicians in
this case should be counted as "employees." Where, as here, a statute
does not helpfully define the term "employee," this Court's cases construing similar language give guidance in how best to fill the statutory
text's gap. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden, 503 U. S. 318, 322, 323.
The professional corporation is a new type of business entity with no
exact common-law precedent, but the common law's definition of the
master-servant relationship provides helpful guidance: the focus on the
master's control over the servant. Accordingly, the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) argues that a court should examine
whether shareholder-directors operate independently and manage the
business or instead are subject to the firm's control. Specific EEOC
guidelines discuss the broad question of who is an "employee" and the
narrower one of when partners, officers, board of directors' members,
and major shareholders qualify as employees. The Court is persuaded
by the EEOC's focus on the common-law touchstone of control and specifically by its submission that each of six factors are relevant to the
inquiry whether a shareholder-director is an employee. Pp. 444-451.

Opinion of the Court
2. Because the District Court's findings appear to weigh in favor of
concluding that the four physicians are not clinic employees, but evidence in the record may contradict those findings or support a contrary
conclusion under the EEOC's standard, the case is remanded for further
proceedings. P. 451.

ployer" is not covered unless its work force includes "15 ormore employees for each working day in each of 20 or more

calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year."$ 12111(5). The question in this case is whether four physicians actively engaged in medical practice as shareholdersand directors of a professional corporation should be counted
as "employees." I

Petitioner, Clackamas Gastroenterology Associates, P. C.,is a medical clinic in Oregon. It employed respondent, Deborah Anne Wells, as a bookkeeper from 1986 until 1997.After her termination, she brought this action against the
clinic alleging unlawful discrimination on the basis of dis-ability under Title I of the ADA. Petitioner denied that it
was covered by the Act and moved for summary judgment,asserting that it did not have 15 or more employees for

the 20 weeks required by the statute. It is undisputed thatthe accuracy of that assertion depends on whether the
four physician-shareholders who own the professional corpo-ration and constitute its board of directors are counted as
employees.The District Court, adopting the Magistrate Judge's findings and recommendation, granted the motion. Relying onan "economic realities" test adopted by the Seventh Circuit
in EEOC v. Dowd & Dowd, Ltd., 736 F. 2d 1177, 1178 (1984),the District Court concluded that the four doctors were
"more analogous to partners in a partnership than to share-holders in a general corporation" and therefore were "not
employees for purposes of the federal antidiscriminationlaws." App. 89.

A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-cuit reversed. Noting that the Second Circuit had rejected
the economic realities approach, the majority held that theuse of any corporation, including a professional corporation,
" `precludes any examination designed to determine whetherthe entity is in fact a partnership.' " 271 F. 3d 903, 905

(2001) (quoting Hyland v. New Haven Radiology Associates,P. C., 794 F. 2d 793, 798 (CA2 1986)). It saw "no reason to

permit a professional corporation to secure the `best of bothpossible worlds' by allowing it both to assert its corporate
status in order to reap the tax and civil liability advantagesand to argue that it is like a partnership in order to avoid
liability for unlawful employment discrimination." 271 F.3d, at 905. The dissenting judge stressed the differences
between an Oregon physicians' professional corporation andan ordinary business corporation,

2 and argued that Congress'

2 The dissenting judge summarized Oregon's treatment of professional
corporations as follows:

"In Oregon, a physicians' professional corporation, like this one, preserves the professional relationship between the physicians and their patients, as well as the standards of conduct that the medical profession
requires. Or. Rev. Stat. $ 58.185(2). Further, `a shareholder of the corporation is personally liable as if the shareholder were rendering the
service or services as an individual' with respect to all claims of negligence, wrongful acts or omissions, or misconduct committed in the rendering of professional services. Or. Rev. Stat. $ 58.185(3) (emphasis added).
A licensed professional also is jointly and severally liable for such claims,
albeit with some dollar limitations. Or. Rev. Stat. $ 58.185(4)-(9). Ordinary business corporation rules apply only to other aspects of the entity, apart from the provision of professional services. Or. Rev. Stat.

$ 58.185(11). A professional corporation's activities must remain consistent with the requirements of the type of license in question, Or. Rev. Stat.

$ 58.205, and it may merge only with other professional corporations, Or.
Rev. Stat. $ 58.196, so the provision of professional services--with its attendant liabilities--must remain at the heart of a P. C. like this defendant.

"Additional special rules apply to professional corporations that are organized to practice medicine, none of which apply to ordinary business
corporations. A majority of the directors, the holders of the majority of
shares, and all officers except the secretary and treasurer must be
Oregon-licensed physicians. Or. Rev. Stat. $ 58.375(1)(a)-(c). The Board
of Medical Examiners is given express statutory authority to require more
than a majority of shares, and more than a majority of director positions,
to be held by Oregon-licensed physicians. Or. Rev. Stat. $ 58.375(1)(d) &
(e). The Board of Medical Examiners also may restrict the corporate powers of a professional corporation organized for the purpose of practicing
medicine, beyond the restrictions imposed on ordinary business corpora538US2 Unit: $U42 [10-27-04 19:59:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

of Graber, J.).We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict in the Circuits, which extends beyond the Seventh and the SecondCircuits.

"We have often been asked to construe the meaning of`employee' where the statute containing the term does not

helpfully define it." Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden,503 U. S. 318, 322 (1992). The definition of the term in the
ADA simply states that an "employee" is "an individual em-ployed by an employer." 42 U. S. C. $ 12111(4). That surely
qualifies as a mere "nominal definition" that is "completelycircular and explains nothing."

Darden, 503 U. S., at 323.As we explained in
Darden, our cases construing similar lan-guage give us guidance on how best to fill the gap in the

statutory text.In Darden we were faced with the question whether an
insurance salesman was an independent contractor or an"employee" covered by the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Because ERISA's definitionof "employee" was "completely circular," 503 U. S., at 323,
we followed the same general approach that we had pre-viously used in deciding whether a sculptor was an "employee" within the meaning of the Copyright Act of 1976, seeCommunity for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 490 U. S. 730

tions. Or. Rev. Stat. $ 58.379. Lastly, Or. Rev. Stat. $$ 58.375 through
58.389 contain impediments to the transfer of shares and other corporate
activities." 271 F. 3d, at 907-908 (opinion of Graber, J.) (footnote omitted).

3 The disagreement in the Circuits is not confined to the particulars of

the ADA. For example, the Seventh Circuit's decision in EEOC v.
Dowd & Dowd, Ltd., 736 F. 2d 1177 (1984), concerned Title VII, and the
Second Circuit's opinion in Hyland v. New Haven Radiology Associates,
P. C., 794 F. 2d 793 (1986), involved the ADEA. See also Devine v. Stone,
Leyton & Gershman, P. C., 100 F. 3d 78 (CA8 1996) (Title VII case).

(1989),4 and we adopted a common-law test for determiningwho qualifies as an "employee" under ERISA.

5 Quoting

Reid, 490 U. S., at 739-740, we explained that " `whenCongress has used the term "employee" without defining

it, we have concluded that Congress intended to describethe conventional master-servant relationship as understood
by common-law agency doctrine.' " Darden, 503 U. S., at322-323.

Rather than looking to the common law, petitioner arguesthat courts should determine whether a shareholder-director
of a professional corporation is an "employee" by askingwhether the shareholder-director is, in reality, a "partner."
Brief for Petitioner 9, 15-16, 21 (arguing that the four share-holders in the clinic are more analogous to partners in a
partnership than shareholders in a corporation and that

4 In Reid, 490 U. S., at 738, the ownership of a copyright in a statue
depended on whether it had been " `prepared by an employee within the
scope of his or her employment' " within the meaning of the Copyright Act
of 1976.

5 Darden described the common-law test for determining whether a

hired party is an employee as follows:

" `[W]e consider the hiring party's right to control the manner and
means by which the product is accomplished. Among the other factors
relevant to this inquiry are the skill required; the source of the instrumentalities and tools; the location of the work; the duration of the relationship
between the parties; whether the hiring party has the right to assign
additional projects to the hired party; the extent of the hired party's discretion over when and how long to work; the method of payment; the hired
party's role in hiring and paying assistants; whether the work is part of
the regular business of the hiring party; whether the hiring party is in
business; the provision of employee benefits; and the tax treatment of the
hired party.' " 503 U. S., at 323-324 (quoting Community for Creative
Non-Violence v. Reid, 490 U. S. 730, 751-752 (1989), and citing Restatement (Second) of Agency $ 220(2) (1958)).

These particular factors are not directly applicable to this case because
we are not faced with drawing a line between independent contractors
and employees. Rather, our inquiry is whether a shareholder-director is
an employee or, alternatively, the kind of person that the common law
would consider an employer.

Opinion of the Court

"those who are properly classified as partners are not`employees' for purposes of the anti-discrimination statutes"). The question whether a shareholder-director is anemployee, however, cannot be answered by asking whether
the shareholder-director appears to be the functional equiva-lent of a partner. Today there are partnerships that include
hundreds of members, some of whom may well qualify as"employees" because control is concentrated in a small number of managing partners. Cf. Hishon v. King & Spalding,467 U. S. 69, 79, n. 2 (1984) (Powell, J., concurring) ("[A]n
employer may not evade the strictures of Title VII simplyby labeling its employees as `partners' ");

EEOC v. Sid-ley Austin Brown & Wood, 315 F. 3d 696, 709 (CA7 2002)

(Easterbrook, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg-ment); Strother v. Southern California Permanente Medical
Group, 79 F. 3d 859 (CA9 1996). Thus, asking whethershareholder-directors are partners--rather than asking

whether they are employees--simply begs the question.Nor does the approach adopted by the Court of Appeals in
this case fare any better. The majority's approach, which
paid particular attention to "the broad purpose of the ADA,"271 F. 3d, at 905, is consistent with the statutory purpose of

ridding the Nation of the evil of discrimination. See 42U. S. C. $ 12101(b).

6 Nevertheless, two countervailing considerations must be weighed in the balance. First, as the

6 The meaning of the term "employee" comes into play when determining whether an individual is an "employee" who may invoke the ADA's
protections against discrimination in "hiring, advancement, or discharge,"
42 U. S. C. $ 12112(a), as well as when determining whether an individual
is an "employee" for purposes of the 15-employee threshold. See

$ 12111(5)(A); see also Brief for United States et al. as Amici Curiae
10-11; Schmidt v. Ottawa Medical Center, P. C., 322 F. 3d 461 (CA7 2003).
Consequently, a broad reading of the term "employee" would--consistent
with the statutory purpose of ridding the Nation of discrimination--tend
to expand the coverage of the ADA by enlarging the number of employees
entitled to protection and by reducing the number of firms entitled to
exemption.

447Cite as: 538 U. S. 440 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
dissenting judge noted below, the congressional decision to
limit the coverage of the legislation to firms with 15 or more
employees has its own justification that must be respected--
namely, easing entry into the market and preserving the
competitive position of smaller firms. See 271 F. 3d, at 908
(opinion of Graber, J.) ("Congress decided `to spare very
small firms from the potentially crushing expense of mastering the intricacies of the antidiscrimination laws, establishing procedures to assure compliance, and defending against
suits when efforts at compliance fail' " (quoting Papa v. Katy
Industries, Inc., 166 F. 3d 937, 940 (CA7), cert. denied, 528
U. S. 1019 (1999))). Second, as Darden reminds us, congressional silence often reflects an expectation that courts will
look to the common law to fill gaps in statutory text, particularly when an undefined term has a settled meaning at common law. Congress has overridden judicial decisions that
went beyond the common law in an effort to correct " `the
mischief ' " at which a statute was aimed. See 503 U. S., at
324-325.

Perhaps the Court of Appeals' and the parties' failure to
look to the common law for guidance in this case stems from
the fact that we are dealing with a new type of business
entity that has no exact precedent in the common law.
State statutes now permit incorporation for the purpose of
practicing a profession, but in the past "the so-called learned
professions were not permitted to organize as corporate entities." 1A W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Private
Corporations $ 112.10 (rev. ed. 1997-2002). Thus, professional corporations are relatively young participants in the
market, and their features vary from State to State. See
generally 1 B. Bittker & J. Eustice, Federal Income Taxation
of Corporations and Shareholders || 2.06 (7th ed. 2002) (explaining that States began to authorize the creation of professional corporations in the late 1950's and that the momentum to form professional corporations grew in the 1970's).

P. C. v. WELLS

Opinion of the Court

Nonetheless, the common law's definition of the master-servant relationship does provide helpful guidance. At common law the relevant factors defining the master-servant re-lationship focus on the master's control over the servant.
The general definition of the term "servant" in the Restate-ment (Second) of Agency $ 2(2) (1957), for example, refers to
a person whose work is "controlled or is subject to the right
to control by the master." See also id., $ 220(1) ("A servantis a person employed to perform services in the affairs of

another and who with respect to the physical conduct in theperformance of the services is subject to the other's control
or right to control"). In addition, the Restatement's more
specific definition of the term "servant" lists factors to be
considered when distinguishing between servants and independent contractors, the first of which is "the extent of control" that one may exercise over the details of the work of
the other. Id., $ 220(2)(a). We think that the common-law
element of control is the principal guidepost that should be
followed in this case.

This is the position that is advocated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency that
has special enforcement responsibilities under the ADA and
other federal statutes containing similar threshold issues for
determining coverage. It argues that a court should examine "whether shareholder-directors operate independently
and manage the business or instead are subject to the firm's
control." Brief for United States et al. as Amici Curiae
8. According to the EEOC's view, "[i]f the shareholderdirectors operate independently and manage the business,
they are proprietors and not employees; if they are subject
to the firm's control, they are employees." Ibid.

Specific EEOC guidelines discuss both the broad question of who is an "employee" and the narrower question of
when partners, officers, members of boards of directors,
and major shareholders qualify as employees. See 2 Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, Compliance Manual

Opinion of the Court

$$ 605:0008-605:00010 (2000) (hereinafter EEOC Compliance
Manual).7 With respect to the broad question, the guidelines list 16 factors--taken from Darden, 503 U. S., at 323-
324--that may be relevant to "whether the employer controls
the means and manner of the worker's work performance."
EEOC Compliance Manual $ 605:0008, and n. 71.8 The
guidelines list six factors to be considered in answering the
narrower question, which they frame as "whether the individual acts independently and participates in managing the
organization, or whether the individual is subject to the organization's control." Id., $ 605:0009.

We are persuaded by the EEOC's focus on the commonlaw touchstone of control, see Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323
U. S. 134, 140 (1944),9 and specifically by its submission that
each of the following six factors is relevant to the inquiry
whether a shareholder-director is an employee:

"Whether the organization can hire or fire the individual
or set the rules and regulations of the individual's work

7 The EEOC's manual states that it applies across the board to other
federal antidiscrimination statutes. See EEOC Compliance Manual

$ 605:0001 ("This Section discusses coverage, timeliness, and other threshold issues to be considered when a charge is first filed under Title VII of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act
of 1967 (ADEA), the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), or
the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (EPA)" (footnote omitted)).

8 For example, the EEOC considers whether the work requires a high

level of skill or expertise, whether the employer furnishes the tools, materials, and equipment, and whether the employer has the right to control when, where, and how the worker performs the job. Id., $ 605:0008.

9 As the Government has acknowledged, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 19, the

EEOC's Compliance Manual is not controlling--even though it may constitute a "body of experience and informed judgment" to which we may resort for guidance. Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S., at 140; see also
Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U. S. 576, 587 (2000) (holding that
agency interpretations contained in "policy statements, agency manuals,
and enforcement guidelines, all of which lack the force of law[,] do not
warrant Chevron-style deference").

As the EEOC's standard reflects, an employer is the per-son, or group of persons, who owns and manages the enterprise. The employer can hire and fire employees, can assigntasks to employees and supervise their performance, and can
decide how the profits and losses of the business are to bedistributed. The mere fact that a person has a particular
title--such as partner, director, or vice president--shouldnot necessarily be used to determine whether he or she is an
employee or a proprietor. See ibid. ("An individual's title. . . does not determine whether the individual is a partner,

Some of the District Court's findings--when considered inlight of the EEOC's standard--appear to weigh in favor of a

conclusion that the four director-shareholder physicians inthis case are not employees of the clinic. For example, they
apparently control the operation of their clinic, they sharethe profits, and they are personally liable for malpractice
claims. There may, however, be evidence in the record thatwould contradict those findings or support a contrary conclusion under the EEOC's standard that we endorse today.11Accordingly, as we did in Darden, we reverse the judgment
of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to that courtfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

common-law employees, a designation they embrace for vari-ous purposes under federal and state law. Classifying as

employees all doctors daily engaged as caregivers on Clacka-mas' premises, moreover, serves the animating purpose of
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA or Act).Seeing no cause to shelter Clackamas from the governance
of the ADA, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of
Appeals.An "employee," the ADA provides, is "an individual employed by an employer." 42 U. S. C. $ 12111(4). Where, ashere, a federal statute uses the word "employee" without
explaining the term's intended scope, we ordinarily presume
"Congress intended to describe the conventional masterservant relationship as understood by common-law agency
doctrine." Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden, 503 U. S.
318, 322-323 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). The
Court today selects one of the common-law indicia of a
master-servant relationship--control over the work of others
engaged in the business of the enterprise--and accords that
factor overriding significance. Ante, at 448. I would not so
shrink the inquiry.

Are the physician-shareholders "servants" of Clackamas
for the purpose relevant here? The Restatement defines
"servant" to mean "an agent employed by a master to perform service in his affairs whose physical conduct in the performance of the service is controlled or is subject to the right
to control by the master." Restatement (Second) of Agency

$ 2(2) (1957) (hereinafter Restatement). When acting as
clinic doctors, the physician-shareholders appear to fit the
Restatement definition. The doctors provide services on
behalf of the corporation, in whose name the practice is conducted. See Ore. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 58.185(1)(a) (1998 Supp.)
(shareholders of a professional corporation "render the specified professional services of the corporation" (emphasis
added)). The doctors have employment contracts with
Clackamas, App. 71, under which they receive salaries and

yearly bonuses, Tr. of Oral Arg. 8, and they work at facilitiesowned or leased by the corporation, App. 29, 71. In performing their duties, the doctors must "compl[y] with . . .standards [the organization has] established."

Id., at 66; see
Restatement, ch. 7, tit. B, Introductory Note, p. 479 ("[F]ullyemployed but highly placed employees of a corporation . . .

are not less servants because they are not controlled in their
day-to-day work by other human beings. Their physical ac-tivities are controlled by their sense of obligation to devote

their time and energies to the interests of the enterprise.").The physician-shareholders, it bears emphasis, invite
the designation "employee" for various purposes under federal and state law. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), much like the ADA, defines "employee" as "any individual employed by an employer." 29
U. S. C. $ 1002(6). Clackamas readily acknowledges that the
physician-shareholders are "employees" for ERISA purposes. Tr. of Oral Arg. 6-7. Indeed, gaining qualification
as "employees" under ERISA was the prime reason the
physician-shareholders chose the corporate form instead of a
partnership. See id., at 7. Further, Clackamas agrees, the
physician-shareholders are covered by Oregon's workers'
compensation law, ibid., a statute applicable to "person[s] . . .
who . . . furnish services for a remuneration, subject to the
direction and control of an employer," Ore. Rev. Stat. Ann.

$ 656.005(30) (1996 Supp.). Finally, by electing to organize
their practice as a corporation, the physician-shareholders
created an entity separate and distinct from themselves,
one that would afford them limited liability for the debts
of the enterprise. $$ 58.185(4), (5), (10), (11) (1998 Supp.). I
see no reason to allow the doctors to escape from their choice
of corporate form when the question becomes whether they
are employees for purposes of federal antidiscrimination
statutes.

Nothing in or about the ADA counsels otherwise. As the
Court observes, the reason for exempting businesses with

fewer than 15 employees from the Act, was "to spare verysmall firms from the potentially crushing expense of mastering the intricacies of the antidiscrimination laws, establish-ing procedures to assure compliance, and defending against
suits when efforts at compliance fail." Ante, at 447 (quota-tion from

Papa v. Katy Industries, Inc., 166 F. 3d 937, 940
(CA7 1999)). The inquiry the Court endorses to determine
the physician-shareholders' qualification as employees askswhether they "ac[t] independently and participat[e] in managing the organization, or . . . [are] subject to the organiza-tion's control."

Ante, at 449 (quoting 2 Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, Compliance Manual $ 605:0009
(2000)). Under the Court's approach, a firm's coverage by
the ADA might sometimes turn on variations in ownership
structure unrelated to the magnitude of the company's business or its capacity for complying with federal prescriptions.

This case is illustrative. In 1996, Clackamas had 4
physician-shareholders and at least 14 other employees for
28 full weeks; in 1997, it had 4 physician-shareholders and at
least 14 other employees for 37 full weeks. App. 55-62; see
42 U. S. C. $ 12111(5) (to be covered by the Act, an employer
must have the requisite number of employees "for each
working day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the
current or preceding calendar year"). Beyond question, the
corporation would have been covered by the ADA had one
of the physician-shareholders sold his stake in the business
and become a "mere" employee. Yet such a change in ownership arrangements would not alter the magnitude of Clackamas' operation: In both circumstances, the corporation
would have had at least 18 people on site doing the everyday
work of the clinic for the requisite number of weeks.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's approach, which the Court endorses, it is true, "excludes from
protection those who are most able to control the firm's practices and who, as a consequence, are least vulnerable to the
discriminatory treatment prohibited by the Act." Brief for

Clackamas affects not only whether they may sue under theADA, but also--and of far greater practical import--
whether employees like bookkeeper Deborah Anne Wells arecovered by the Act. Because the character of the relationship between Clackamas and the doctors supplies no justifi-cation for withholding from clerical worker Wells federal
protection against discrimination in the workplace, I wouldaffirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

JINKS v. RICHLAND COUNTY, SOUTH CAROLINA,

et al.

certiorari to the supreme court of south carolina

No. 02-258. Argued March 5, 2003--Decided April 22, 2003
Title 28 U. S. C. $ 1367 determines whether a federal district court with

jurisdiction over a civil action may exercise supplemental jurisdiction
over other claims forming part of the same Article III "case or controversy." If the court declines to exercise such jurisdiction, the claims
will be dismissed and must be refiled in state court. To prevent the
limitations period on those claims from expiring while they are pending
in federal court, $ 1367(d) requires state courts to toll the period while
a supplemental claim is pending in federal court and for 30 days after
its dismissal unless state law provides for a longer tolling period. Petitioner filed a federal-court action claiming that Richland County (hereinafter respondent) and others violated 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 in connection
with her husband's death. She also asserted supplemental claims for
wrongful death and survival under South Carolina law. The District
Court granted defendants summary judgment on the $ 1983 claim and
declined to exercise jurisdiction over the state-law claims. Petitioner
then filed the supplemental claims in state court and won a wrongfuldeath verdict against respondent. The State Supreme Court reversed,
finding the state-law claims time barred. Although they would not
have been barred under $ 1367(d)'s tolling rule, the court held $ 1367(d)
unconstitutional as applied to claims brought in state court against a
State's political subdivisions.

Held: Section 1367(d)'s application to claims brought against a State's political subdivisions is constitutional. Pp. 461-467.

(a) The Court rejects respondent's contention that $ 1367(d) is facially
invalid because it exceeds Congress's enumerated powers. Rather, it
is necessary and proper for executing Congress's power "[t]o constitute
Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court," Art. I, $ 8, cl. 9, and assuring
that those tribunals may fairly and efficiently exercise "[t]he judicial
Power of the United States," Art. III, $ 1. As to "necessity": It suffices
that $ 1367(d) is conducive to the administration of justice in federal
court and is plainly adapted to that end. See McCulloch v. Maryland,
4 Wheat. 316, 421. And as to propriety: Contrary to respondent's claim,

$ 1367(d) does not violate state-sovereignty principles by regulating
state-court procedures. Pp. 461-465.

Syllabus
(b) Also without merit is respondent's contention that $ 1367(d) should
not be interpreted to apply to claims brought against a State's political
subdivisions. Congress lacks Article I authority to override a State's
immunity from suit in its own courts, see Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706,
but it may subject a municipality to suit in state court if that is done
pursuant to a valid exercise of its enumerated powers, see id., at 756.
This is merely the consequence of those cases, which respondent does
not ask the Court to overrule, holding that municipalities do not enjoy
a constitutionally protected immunity from suit. And any suggestion
that an "unmistakably clear" statement is required before an Act of
Congress may expose a local government to liability cannot possibly be
reconciled with Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436

458 JINKS v. RICHLAND COUNTY

Opinion of the Court
Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Supreme Court of South Carolina dismissed petitioner's lawsuit against Richland County (hereinafter respondent) as time barred. In doing so it held that 28 U. S. C.

$ 1367(d), which required the state statute of limitations to
be tolled for the period during which petitioner's cause of
action had previously been pending in federal court, is unconstitutional as applied to lawsuits brought against a State's
political subdivisions. The issue before us is the validity of
that constitutional determination.

I
A

When a federal district court has original jurisdiction over
a civil cause of action, $ 1367 determines whether it may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over other claims that do
not independently come within its jurisdiction, but that form
part of the same Article III "case or controversy." Section
1367(a) provides:

"Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) or as expressly provided otherwise by Federal statute, in any
civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to
claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that
they form part of the same case or controversy under
Article III of the United States Constitution. Such

Opinion of the Court
supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that in-volve the joinder or intervention of additional parties."

As the introductory clause suggests, not every claim withinthe same "case or controversy" as the claim within the federal courts' original jurisdiction will be decided by the fed-eral court; $$ 1367(b) and (c) describe situations in which a
federal court may or must decline to exercise supplementaljurisdiction. Section 1367(c), for example, states:

"The district courts may decline to exercise supplemen-tal jurisdiction over a claim under subsection (a) if--
"(1) the claim raises a novel or complex issue of Statelaw,
"(2) the claim substantially predominates over the claimor claims over which the district court has original
jurisdiction,
"(3) the district court has dismissed all claims overwhich it has original jurisdiction, or

"(4) in exceptional circumstances, there are other com-pelling reasons for declining jurisdiction."

Thus, some claims asserted under $ 1367(a) will be dismissedbecause the district court declines to exercise jurisdiction
over them and, if they are to be pursued, must be refiledin state court. To prevent the limitations period on such
supplemental claims from expiring while the plaintiff wasfruitlessly pursuing them in federal court, $ 1367(d) provides
a tolling rule that must be applied by state courts:

"The period of limitations for any claim asserted undersubsection (a), and for any other claim in the same action

that is voluntarily dismissed at the same time as or afterthe dismissal of the claim under subsection (a), shall be
tolled while the claim is pending and for a period of 30days after it is dismissed unless State law provides for
a longer tolling period."

Opinion of the Court

B
On October 14, 1994, Carl H. Jinks was arrested and jailed
for failure to pay child support. Four days later, while confined at respondent's detention center, he died of complications associated with alcohol withdrawal. In 1996, within
the applicable statute of limitations, petitioner Susan Jinks,
Carl Jinks's widow, brought an action in the United States
District Court for the District of South Carolina against respondent, its detention center director, and its detention center physician. She asserted a cause of action under Rev.
Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, and also supplemental claims
for wrongful death and survival under the South Carolina
Tort Claims Act. See S. C. Code Ann. $ 15-78-10 et seq.
(West Supp. 2002). On November 20, 1997, the District
Court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the $ 1983 claim, and two weeks later issued an order
declining to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining statelaw claims, dismissing them without prejudice pursuant to
28 U. S. C. $ 1367(c)(3).

On December 18, 1997, petitioner filed her wrongful-death
and survival claims in state court. After the jury returned
a verdict of $80,000 against respondent on the wrongfuldeath claim, respondent appealed to the South Carolina Supreme Court, which reversed on the ground that petitioner's
state-law claims were time barred. Although they would
not have been time barred under $ 1367(d)'s tolling rule, the
State Supreme Court held that $ 1367(d) was unconstitutional as applied to claims brought in state court against a
State's political subdivisions, because it "interferes with the
State's sovereign authority to establish the extent to which
its political subdivisions are subject to suit." 349 S. C. 298,
304, 563 S. E. 2d 104, 107 (2002).

A

Respondent and its amici first contend that $ 1367(d) isfacially invalid because it exceeds the enumerated powers

of Congress. We disagree. Although the Constitution doesnot expressly empower Congress to toll limitations periods
for state-law claims brought in state court, it does give Con-gress the authority "[t]o make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution [Congress's Ar-ticle I, $ 8,] Powers and all other Powers vested by this
Constitution in the Government of the United States . . . ."Art. I, $ 8, cl. 18. The enactment of $ 1367(d) was not the
first time Congress prescribed the alteration of a state-lawlimitations period;

1 nor is this the first case in which we have

ruled on its authority to do so. In Stewart v. Kahn, 11 Wall.

1 See, e. g., Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, 50 U. S. C. App.

$ 525 ("The period of military service shall not be included in computing
any period now or hereafter to be limited by any law, regulation, or order
for the bringing of any action or proceeding in any court . . . by or against
any person in military service"); 42 U. S. C. $ 9658(a)(1) ("In the case of
any action brought under State law for personal injury, or property damages, which are caused or contributed to by exposure to any hazardous
substance, or pollutant or contaminant, released into the environment
from a facility, if the applicable limitations period for such action (as specified in the State statute of limitations or under common law) provides a
commencement date which is earlier than the federally required commencement date, such period shall commence at the federally required
commencement date in lieu of the date specified in such State statute");
11 U. S. C. $ 108(c) ("Except as provided in section 524 of this title, if applicable nonbankruptcy law . . . fixes a period for commencing or continuing

end of such period, including any suspension of such period occurring on

462 JINKS v. RICHLAND COUNTY

Opinion of the Court
493 (1871), we upheld as constitutional a federal statute thattolled limitations periods for state-law civil and criminal

cases for the time during which actions could not be prose-cuted because of the Civil War. We reasoned that this law
was both necessary and proper to carrying into effect theFederal Government's war powers, because it "remed[ied]
the evils" that had arisen from the war. "It would be astrange result if those in rebellion, by protracting the conflict, could thus rid themselves of their debts, and Congress,which had the power to wage war and suppress the insurrection, had no power to remedy such an evil, which is one ofits consequences."

Id., at 507.Of course $ 1367(d) has nothing to do with the war power.

We agree with petitioner and intervenor United States, how-ever, that $ 1367(d) is necessary and proper for carrying into
execution Congress's power "[t]o constitute Tribunals infe-rior to the supreme Court," U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 9,
and to assure that those tribunals may fairly and efficientlyexercise "[t]he judicial Power of the United States," Art. III,

$ 1. As to "necessity": The federal courts can assuredlyexist and function in the absence of $ 1367(d), but we long
ago rejected the view that the Necessary and Proper Clausedemands that an Act of Congress be " `

absolutely neces-sary' " to the exercise of an enumerated power. See McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 414-415 (1819). Rather, itsuffices that $ 1367(d) is "conducive to the due administration
of justice" in federal court,2 and is "plainly adapted" to thatend, id., at 417, 421. Section 1367(d) is conducive to the administration of justice because it provides an alternative tothe unsatisfactory options that federal judges faced when
they decided whether to retain jurisdiction over supplemen-tal state-law claims that might be time barred in state court.
In the pre-$ 1367(d) world, they had three basic choices:

2 This was Chief Justice Marshall's description in McCulloch of why--
by way of example--legislation punishing perjury in the federal courts is
valid under the Necessary and Proper Clause. See 4 Wheat., at 417.

463Cite as: 538 U. S. 456 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
First, they could condition dismissal of the state-law claimon the defendant's waiver of any statute-of-limitations defense in state court. See, e. g., Duckworth v. Franzen, 780F. 2d 645, 657 (CA7 1985);

Financial General Bankshares,
Inc. v. Metzger, 680 F. 2d 768, 778 (CADC 1982). Thatwaiver could be refused, however, in which case one of the

remaining two choices would have to be pursued. Second,
they could retain jurisdiction over the state-law claim eventhough it would more appropriately be heard in state court.

See Newman v. Burgin, 930 F. 2d 955, 963-964 (CA1 1991)(collecting cases). That would produce an obvious frustration of statutory policy. And third, they could dismiss the
state-law claim but allow the plaintiff to reopen the federal
case if the state court later held the claim to be time barred.
See, e. g., Rheaume v. Texas Dept. of Public Safety, 666 F. 2d
925, 932 (CA5 1982). That was obviously inefficient. By
providing a straightforward tolling rule in place of this regime, $ 1367(d) unquestionably promotes fair and efficient operation of the federal courts and is therefore conducive to
the administration of justice.

And it is conducive to the administration of justice for another reason: It eliminates a serious impediment to access to
the federal courts on the part of plaintiffs pursuing federaland state-law claims that "derive from a common nucleus of
operative fact," Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U. S. 715, 725
(1966). Prior to enactment of $ 1367(d), they had the following unattractive options: (1) They could file a single federalcourt action, which would run the risk that the federal court
would dismiss the state-law claims after the limitations period had expired; (2) they could file a single state-law action,
which would abandon their right to a federal forum; (3) they
could file separate, timely actions in federal and state court
and ask that the state-court litigation be stayed pending resolution of the federal case, which would increase litigation
costs with no guarantee that the state court would oblige.
Section 1367(d) replaces this selection of inadequate choices

Opinion of the Court
with the assurance that state-law claims asserted under

$ 1367(a) will not become time barred while pending in federal court.

We are also persuaded, and respondent does not deny, that

$ 1367(d) is "plainly adapted" to the power of Congress to
establish the lower federal courts and provide for the fair
and efficient exercise of their Article III powers. There is
no suggestion by either of the parties that Congress enacted

$ 1367(d) as a "pretext" for "the accomplishment of objects
not entrusted to the [federal] government," McCulloch,
supra, at 423, nor is the connection between $ 1367(d) and
Congress's authority over the federal courts so attenuated
as to undermine the enumeration of powers set forth in Article I, $ 8, cf. United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 567-568
(1995); United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 615 (2000).

Respondent and its amici further contend, however, that

$ 1367(d) is not a "proper" exercise of Congress's Article I
powers because it violates principles of state sovereignty.
See Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898, 923-924 (1997).
Respondent views $ 1367(d)'s tolling rule as a regulation of
state-court "procedure," and contends that Congress may
not, consistent with the Constitution, prescribe procedural
rules for state courts' adjudication of purely state-law claims.
See, e. g., Bellia, Federal Regulation of State Court Procedures, 110 Yale L. J. 947 (2001); Congressional Authority to
Require State Courts to Use Certain Procedures in Products
Liability Cases, 13 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 372, 373-374
(1989) (stating that "potential constitutional questions" arise
when Congress "attempts to prescribe directly the state
court procedures to be followed in products liability cases").
Assuming for the sake of argument that a principled dichotomy can be drawn, for purposes of determining whether an
Act of Congress is "proper," between federal laws that regulate state-court "procedure" and laws that change the "substance" of state-law rights of action, we do not think that

Opinion of the Court
state-law limitations periods fall into the category of "proce-dure" immune from congressional regulation. Respondent's

reliance on Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman, 486 U. S. 717 (1988),which held a state statute of limitations to be "procedural"
for purposes of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, is mis-placed. As we noted in that very case, the meaning of
" `substance' " and " `procedure' " in a particular context is"largely determined by the purposes for which the dichotomy is drawn." Id., at 726. For purposes of Erie R. Co. v.
Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938), for example, statutes of limita-tions are treated as substantive. Guaranty Trust Co. v.

York, 326 U. S. 99 (1945). Stewart v. Kahn, 11 Wall., at 506-507, provides ample support for the proposition that--if the
substance-procedure dichotomy posited by respondent isvalid--the tolling of limitations periods falls on the "substantive" side of the line. To sustain $ 1367(d) in this case, weneed not (and do not) hold that Congress has unlimited
power to regulate practice and procedure in state courts.We therefore reject respondent's contention that $ 1367(d)
is facially unconstitutional. B

Respondent next maintains that $ 1367(d) should not beinterpreted to apply to claims brought against a State's political subdivisions. We find this contention also to be with-out merit.

The South Carolina Tort Claims Act, S. C. Code Ann. $ 15-
78-10 et seq. (West Supp. 2002), confers upon respondent animmunity from tort liability for any claim brought more than

two years after the injury was or should have been discov-ered. In respondent's view, $ 1367(d)'s extension of the time
period in which a State's political subdivisions may be suedconstitutes an impermissible abrogation of "sovereign immunity." That is not so. Although we have held that Con-gress lacks authority under Article I to override a

State's
immunity from suit in its own courts, see Alden v. Maine,

466 JINKS v. RICHLAND COUNTY

Opinion of the Court
527 U. S. 706 (1999), it may subject a municipality to suit in
state court if that is done pursuant to a valid exercise of its
enumerated powers, see id., at 756. Section 1367(d) tolls the
limitations period with respect to state-law causes of action
brought against municipalities, but we see no reason why
that represents a greater intrusion on "state sovereignty"
than the undisputed power of Congress to override state-law
immunity when subjecting a municipality to suit under a federal cause of action. In either case, a State's authority to
set the conditions upon which its political subdivisions are
subject to suit in its own courts must yield to the enactments
of Congress. This is not an encroachment on "state sovereignty," but merely the consequence of those cases (which
respondent does not ask us to overrule) which hold that municipalities, unlike States, do not enjoy a constitutionally protected immunity from suit.

Nor do we see any reason to construe $ 1367(d) not to apply
to claims brought against a State's political subdivisions absent an "unmistakably clear" statement of the statute's applicability to such claims. Although we held in Raygor v. Regents of Univ. of Minn., 534 U. S. 533 (2002), that $ 1367(d)
does not apply to claims filed in federal court against States
but subsequently dismissed on sovereign immunity grounds,
we did so to avoid interpreting the statute in a manner that
would raise "serious constitutional doubt" in light of our
decisions protecting a State's sovereign immunity from
congressional abrogation, id., at 543. As we have just
explained, however, no such constitutional doubt arises from
holding that petitioner's claim against respondent--which is
not a State, but a political subdivision of a State--falls under
the definition of "any claim asserted under subsection (a)."

$ 1367(d) (emphasis added). In any event, the idea that an
"unmistakably clear" statement is required before an Act of
Congress may expose a local government to liability cannot
possibly be reconciled with our holding in Monell v. New

DOLE FOOD CO. et al. v. PATRICKSON et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 01-593. Argued January 22, 2003--Decided April 22, 2003*
Plaintiffs filed a state-court action against Dole Food Company and others

(Dole petitioners), alleging injury from chemical exposure. The Dole
petitioners impleaded petitioners Dead Sea Bromine Co. and Bromine
Compounds, Ltd. (collectively, the Dead Sea Companies). The Dole
petitioners removed the action to federal court under 28 U. S. C.

$ 1441(a), arguing that the federal common law of foreign relations provided federal-question jurisdiction under $ 1331. The District Court
agreed it had jurisdiction, but dismissed the case on other grounds. As
to the Dead Sea Companies, the court rejected their claim that they are
instrumentalities of a foreign state (Israel) as defined by the Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA), and are therefore entitled to
removal under $ 1441(d). The Ninth Circuit reversed. As to the Dole
petitioners, it held removal could not rest on the federal common law of
foreign relations. Regarding the Dead Sea Companies, the court noted,
but declined to answer, the question whether status as an instrumentality of a foreign state is assessed at the time of the alleged wrongdoing
or at the time suit is filed. It held that the Dead Sea Companies, even
at the earlier date, were not instrumentalities of Israel because they did
not meet the FSIA's instrumentality definition.

Held:

1. The writ of certiorari is dismissed in No. 01-593, as the Dole petitioners did not seek review in this Court of the Ninth Circuit's ruling
on the federal common law of foreign relations. P. 472.

2. A foreign state must itself own a majority of a corporation's shares
if the corporation is to be deemed an instrumentality of the state under
the FSIA. Israel did not have direct ownership of shares in either of
the Dead Sea Companies at any time pertinent to this action. Rather,
they were, at various times, separated from Israel by one or more intermediate corporate tiers. As indirect subsidiaries of Israel, the companies cannot come within the statutory language granting instrumentality status to an entity a "majority of whose shares or other ownership
interest is owned by a foreign state or political subdivision thereof."

*Together with No. 01-594, Dead Sea Bromine Co., Ltd., et al. v. Patrickson et al., also on certiorari to the same court.

Syllabus

$ 1603(b)(2). Only direct ownership satisfies the statutory requirement.
In issues of corporate law structure often matters. The statutory reference to ownership of "shares" shows that Congress intended coverage
to turn on formal corporate ownership. As a corporation and its shareholders are distinct entities, see, e. g., First Nat. City Bank v. Banco
Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba, 462 U. S. 611, 625, a corporate parent which owns a subsidiary's shares does not, for that reason alone,
own or have legal title to the subsidiary's assets; and, it follows with
even greater force, the parent does not own or have legal title to the
subsidiary's subsidiaries. The veil separating corporations and their
shareholders may be pierced in certain exceptional circumstances, but
the Dead Sea Companies refer to no authority for extending the doctrine so far that, as a categorical matter, all subsidiaries are deemed to
be the same as the parent corporation. Various federal statutes refer
to "direct or indirect ownership." The absence of this language in

$ 1603(b) instructs the Court that Congress did not intend to disregard
structural ownership rules here. That section's "other ownership interest" phrase, when following the word "shares," should be interpreted to
refer to a type of interest other than stock ownership. Reading the
phrase to refer to a state's interest in entities further down the corporate ladder would make the specific reference to "shares" redundant.
The fact that Israel exercised considerable control over the companies
may not be substituted for an ownership interest, since control and ownership are distinct concepts, and it is majority ownership by a foreign
state, not control, that is the benchmark of instrumentality status.
Pp. 473-478.

3. Instrumentality status is determined at the time of the filing of
the complaint. Construing $ 1603(b)(2) so that the present tense in the
provision "a majority of whose shares . . . is owned by a foreign state"
has real significance is consistent with the longstanding principle that
the Court's jurisdiction depends upon the state of things at the time the
action is brought. E. g., Keene Corp. v. United States, 508 U. S. 200,
207. The Dead Sea Companies' attempt to compare foreign sovereign
immunity with other immunities that are based on a government officer's status at the time of the conduct giving rise to the suit is inapt
because the reason for those other immunities does not apply here. Unlike those immunities, foreign sovereign immunity is not meant to avoid
chilling foreign states or their instrumentalities in the conduct of their
business but to give them some protection from the inconvenience of
suit as a gesture of comity, Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria,
461 U. S. 480, 486. Because any relationship recognized under the
FSIA between the Dead Sea Companies and Israel had been severed
before suit was commenced, the companies would not be entitled to in538US2 Unit: $U44 [10-27-04 11:22:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

1976 (FSIA or Act), Pub. L. 94-583, 90 Stat. 2891. Some of
the Act's provisions also may be invoked by a corporate entity that is an "instrumentality" of a foreign state as defined
by the Act. Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504
U. S. 607, 611 (1992); Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480, 488 (1983). The corporate entities in
this action claim instrumentality status to invoke the Act's
provisions allowing removal of state-court actions to federal
court. As the action comes to us, it presents two questions.
The first is whether a corporate subsidiary can claim instrumentality status where the foreign state does not own a majority of its shares but does own a majority of the shares of
a corporate parent one or more tiers above the subsidiary.
The second question is whether a corporation's instrumentality status is defined as of the time an alleged tort or other
actionable wrong occurred or, on the other hand, at the time
suit is filed. We granted certiorari, 536 U. S. 956 (2002).

I
The underlying action was filed in a state court in Hawaii
in 1997 against Dole Food Company and other companies
(Dole petitioners). Plaintiffs in the action were a group of
farm workers from Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, and
Panama who alleged injury from exposure to dibromochloropropane, a chemical used as an agricultural pesticide in their
home countries. The Dole petitioners impleaded petitioners
Dead Sea Bromine Co., Ltd., and Bromine Compounds, Ltd.
(collectively, the Dead Sea Companies). The merits of the
suit are not before us.

The Dole petitioners removed the action to the United
States District Court for the District of Hawaii under 28
U. S. C. $ 1441(a), arguing that the federal common law
of foreign relations provided federal-question jurisdiction
under $ 1331. The District Court agreed there was federal
subject-matter jurisdiction under the federal common law of

Opinion of the Court
foreign relations but, nevertheless, dismissed the case on
grounds of forum non conveniens.

The Dead Sea Companies removed under a separate theory. They claimed to be instrumentalities of a foreign state
as defined by the FSIA, entitling them to removal under

$ 1441(d). The District Court held that the Dead Sea Companies are not instrumentalities of a foreign state for purposes of the FSIA and are not entitled to removal on that
basis. Civ. No. 97-01516HG (D. Haw., Sept. 9, 1998), App. to
Pet. for Cert. in No. 01-594, p. 79a.

The Court of Appeals reversed. Addressing the ground
relied on by the Dole petitioners, it held removal could not
rest on the federal common law of foreign relations. 251
F. 3d 795, 800 (CA9 2001). In this Court the Dole petitioners did not seek review of that portion of the Court of Appeals' ruling, and we do not address it. Accordingly, the
writ of certiorari in No. 01-593 is dismissed.

The Court of Appeals also reversed the order allowing
removal at the instance of the Dead Sea Companies, who
alleged they were instrumentalities of the State of Israel.
The Court of Appeals noted, but declined to answer, the
question whether status as an instrumentality of a foreign
state is assessed at the time of the alleged wrongdoing or at
the time suit is filed. It went on to hold that the Dead Sea
Companies, even at the earlier date, were not instrumentalities of Israel because they did not meet the Act's definition
of instrumentality.

In order to prevail here, the Dead Sea Companies must
show both that instrumentality status is determined as of
the time the alleged tort occurred and that they can claim
instrumentality status even though they were but subsidiaries of a parent owned by the State of Israel. We address
each question in turn. In No. 01-594, the case in which the
Dead Sea Companies are petitioners, we now affirm.

Opinion of the Court

II

A
Title 28 U. S. C. $ 1441(d) governs removal of actionsagainst foreign states. It provides that "[a]ny civil action

brought in a State court against a foreign state as defined in[28 U. S. C. $ 1603(a)] may be removed by the foreign state
to the district court of the United States for the district anddivision embracing the place where such action is pending."
See also $ 1330 (governing original jurisdiction). Section1603(a), part of the FSIA, defines "foreign state" to include
an "agency or instrumentality of a foreign state." "[A]gencyor instrumentality of a foreign state" is defined, in turn, as:

"[A]ny entity--"(1) which is a separate legal person, corporate or otherwise, and"(2) which is an organ of a foreign state or political
subdivision thereof, or a majority of whose shares orother ownership interest is owned by a foreign state or
political subdivision thereof, and"(3) which is neither a citizen of a State of the United
States . . . nor created under the laws of any third coun-try." $ 1603(b).

B
The Court of Appeals resolved the question of the FSIA'sapplicability by holding that a subsidiary of an instrumentality is not itself entitled to instrumentality status. Its hold-ing was correct.

The State of Israel did not have direct ownership of sharesin either of the Dead Sea Companies at any time pertinent to
this suit. Rather, these companies were, at various times,separated from the State of Israel by one or more intermediate corporate tiers. For example, from 1984-1985, Israelwholly owned a company called Israeli Chemicals, Ltd.;
which owned a majority of shares in another company called

Opinion of the Court
Dead Sea Works, Ltd.; which owned a majority of shares inDead Sea Bromine Co., Ltd.; which owned a majority of

shares in Bromine Compounds, Ltd.The Dead Sea Companies, as indirect subsidiaries of the
State of Israel, were not instrumentalities of Israel underthe FSIA at any time. Those companies cannot come within
the statutory language which grants status as an instrumentality of a foreign state to an entity a "majority of whoseshares or other ownership interest is owned by a foreign

state or political subdivision thereof." $ 1603(b)(2). Wehold that only direct ownership of a majority of shares by
the foreign state satisfies the statutory requirement.

Section 1603(b)(2) speaks of ownership. The Dead Sea
Companies urge us to ignore corporate formalities and use
the colloquial sense of that term. They ask whether, in common parlance, Israel would be said to own the Dead Sea
Companies. We reject this analysis. In issues of corporate
law structure often matters. It is evident from the Act's
text that Congress was aware of settled principles of corporate law and legislated within that context. The language
of $ 1603(b)(2) refers to ownership of "shares," showing that
Congress intended statutory coverage to turn on formal corporate ownership. Likewise, $ 1603(b)(1), another component of the definition of instrumentality, refers to a "separate
legal person, corporate or otherwise." In light of these indicia that Congress had corporate formalities in mind, we assess whether Israel owned shares in the Dead Sea Companies as a matter of corporate law, irrespective of whether
Israel could be said to have owned the Dead Sea Companies
in everyday parlance.

A basic tenet of American corporate law is that the corporation and its shareholders are distinct entities. See, e. g.,
First Nat. City Bank v. Banco Para el Comercio Exterior
de Cuba, 462 U. S. 611, 625 (1983) ("Separate legal personality has been described as `an almost indispensable aspect of
the public corporation' "); Burnet v. Clark, 287 U. S. 410, 415

Opinion of the Court
(1932) ("A corporation and its stockholders are generally tobe treated as separate entities"). An individual shareholder, by virtue of his ownership of shares, does not own thecorporation's assets and, as a result, does not own subsidiary
corporations in which the corporation holds an interest. See1 W.

Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations

$ 31 (rev. ed. 1999). A corporate parent which owns the
shares of a subsidiary does not, for that reason alone, own orhave legal title to the assets of the subsidiary; and, it follows

with even greater force, the parent does not own or havelegal title to the subsidiaries of the subsidiary. See

id., $ 31,
at 514 ("The properties of two corporations are distinct,
though the same shareholders own or control both. A holding corporation does not own the subsidiary's property").
The fact that the shareholder is a foreign state does not
change the analysis. See First Nat. City Bank, supra, at
626-627 ("[G]overnment instrumentalities established as juridical entities distinct and independent from their sovereign
should normally be treated as such").

Applying these principles, it follows that Israel did not
own a majority of shares in the Dead Sea Companies. The
State of Israel owned a majority of shares, at various times,
in companies one or more corporate tiers above the Dead Sea
Companies, but at no time did Israel own a majority of
shares in the Dead Sea Companies. Those companies were
subsidiaries of other corporations.

The veil separating corporations and their shareholders
may be pierced in some circumstances, and the Dead Sea
Companies essentially urge us to interpret the FSIA as piercing the veil in all cases. The doctrine of piercing the corporate veil, however, is the rare exception, applied in the case
of fraud or certain other exceptional circumstances, see, e. g.,
Burnet, supra, at 415; Fletcher, supra, $$ 41 to 41.20, and
usually determined on a case-by-case basis. The Dead Sea
Companies have referred us to no authority for extending
the doctrine so far that, as a categorical matter, all subsidiar538US2 Unit: $U44 [10-27-04 11:22:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ies are deemed to be the same as the parent corporation.The text of the FSIA gives no indication that Congress intended us to depart from the general rules regarding corpo-rate formalities.

Where Congress intends to refer to ownership in otherthan the formal sense, it knows how to do so. Various federal statutes refer to "direct and indirect ownership." See,
e. g., 5 U. S. C. $ 8477(a)(4)(G)(iii) (referring to an interest"owned directly or indirectly"); 12 U. S. C. $ 84(c)(5) (referring to "any corporation wholly owned directly or indirectlyby the United States"); 15 U. S. C. $ 79b(a)(8)(A) (referring
to securities "which are directly or indirectly owned, controlled, or held with power to vote"); $ 1802(3) ("The term
`newspaper owner' means any person who owns or controls
directly, or indirectly through separate or subsidiary corporations, one or more newspaper publications"). The absence
of this language in 28 U. S. C. $ 1603(b) instructs us that Congress did not intend to disregard structural ownership rules.

The FSIA's definition of instrumentality refers to a foreign
state's majority ownership of "shares or other ownership
interest." $ 1603(b)(2). The Dead Sea Companies would
have us read "other ownership interest" to include a state's
"interest" in its instrumentality's subsidiary. The better
reading of the text, in our view, does not support this argument. The words "other ownership interest," when following the word "shares," should be interpreted to refer to a
type of interest other than ownership of stock. The statute
had to be written for the contingency of ownership forms in
other countries, or even in this country, that depart from
conventional corporate structures. The statutory phrase
"other ownership interest" is best understood to accomplish
this objective. Reading the term to refer to a state's interest in entities lower on the corporate ladder would make the
specific reference to "shares" redundant. Absent a statutory text or structure that requires us to depart from normal
rules of construction, we should not construe the statute in

538US2 Unit: $U44 [10-27-04 11:22:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

477Cite as: 538 U. S. 468 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
a manner that is strained and, at the same time, would render a statutory term superfluous. See Mertens v. Hewitt
Associates, 508 U. S. 248, 258 (1993) ("We will not read the
statute to render the modifier superfluous"); United States v.
Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 36 (1992) (declining to
adopt a construction that would violate the "settled rule that
a statute must, if possible, be construed in such fashion that
every word has some operative effect").

The Dead Sea Companies say that the State of Israel exercised considerable control over their operations, notwithstanding Israel's indirect relationship to those companies.
They appear to think that, in determining instrumentality
status under the Act, control may be substituted for an
ownership interest. Control and ownership, however, are
distinct concepts. See, e. g., United States v. Bestfoods,
524 U. S. 51, 64-65 (1998) (distinguishing between "operation" and "ownership" of a subsidiary's assets for purposes
of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act of 1980 liability). The terms of $ 1603(b)(2)
are explicit and straightforward. Majority ownership by a
foreign state, not control, is the benchmark of instrumentality status. We need not delve into Israeli law or examine
the extent of Israel's involvement in the Dead Sea Companies' operations. Even if Israel exerted the control the
Dead Sea Companies describe, that would not give Israel
a "majority of [the companies'] shares or other ownership
interest." The statutory language will not support a control
test that mandates inquiry in every case into the past details
of a foreign nation's relation to a corporate entity in which
it does not own a majority of the shares.

The better rule is the one supported by the statutory text
and elementary principles of corporate law. A corporation
is an instrumentality of a foreign state under the FSIA only
if the foreign state itself owns a majority of the corporation's shares.

Opinion of the Court
We now turn to the second question before us, which pro-vides an alternative reason for affirming the Court of Appeals. See Woods v. Interstate Realty Co., 337 U. S. 535,537 (1949).

C
To be entitled to removal under $ 1441(d), the Dead SeaCompanies must show that they are entities "a majority of

whose shares or other ownership interest is owned by a for-eign state." $ 1603(b)(2). We think the plain text of this
provision, because it is expressed in the present tense, re-quires that instrumentality status be determined at the time
suit is filed.Construing $ 1603(b) so that the present tense has real significance is consistent with the "longstanding principle that`the jurisdiction of the Court depends upon the state of
things at the time of the action brought.' " Keene Corp.v. United States, 508 U. S. 200, 207 (1993) (quoting Mollan
v. Torrance, 9 Wheat. 537, 539 (1824)). It is well settled,for example, that federal-diversity jurisdiction depends on

the citizenship of the parties at the time suit is filed. See,e. g., Anderson v. Watt, 138 U. S. 694, 702-703 (1891) ("And
the [ jurisdictional] inquiry is determined by the conditionof the parties at the commencement of the suit"); see also
Minneapolis & St. Louis R. Co. v. Peoria & Pekin Union
R. Co., 270 U. S. 580, 586 (1926) ("The jurisdiction of thelower court depends upon the state of things existing at the

$ 1332(a)(4), which provides for suits between "a foreignstate, defined in section 1603(a) . . . , as plaintiff and citizens
of a State or of different States." It would be anomalous toread $ 1441(d)'s words, "foreign state as defined in section
1603(a)," differently.The Dead Sea Companies urge us to administer the FSIA

Opinion of the Court
of an officer at the time of the conduct giving rise to the suit.We think its comparison is inapt. Our cases applying those

immunities do not involve the interpretation of a statute.See,

e. g., Spalding v. Vilas, 161 U. S. 483, 493-499 (1896)
(basing a decision regarding official immunity on commonlaw and considerations of "convenience and public policy");

Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232, 239-242 (1974).

The reason for the official immunities in those cases doesnot apply here. The immunities for government officers

prevent the threat of suit from "crippl[ing] the proper andeffective administration of public affairs."

Spalding, supra,
at 498 (discussing immunity for executive officers); see also
Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S. 547, 554 (1967) ( judicial immunity
serves the public interest in judges who are "at liberty to
exercise their functions with independence and without fear
of consequences" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Foreign sovereign immunity, by contrast, is not meant to avoid
chilling foreign states or their instrumentalities in the conduct of their business but to give foreign states and their
instrumentalities some protection from the inconvenience of
suit as a gesture of comity between the United States and
other sovereigns. Verlinden, 461 U. S., at 486.

For the same reason, the Dead Sea Companies' reliance on
Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731 (1982), is unavailing.
There, we recognized that the President was immune from
liability for official actions taken during his time in office,
even against a suit filed when he was no longer serving in
that capacity. The immunity served the same function that
the other official immunities serve. See id., at 751 ("Because
of the singular importance of the President's duties, diversion of his energies by concern with private lawsuits would
raise unique risks to the effective functioning of government"). As noted above, immunity under the FSIA does
not serve the same purpose.

The immunity recognized in Nixon was also based on a
further rationale, one not applicable here: the constitutional

Opinion of Breyer, J.
separation of powers. See id., at 749 ("We consider this immunity a functionally mandated incident of the President's
unique office, rooted in the constitutional tradition of the separation of powers and supported by our history"). That rationale is not implicated by the statutory immunity Congress
created for actions such as the one before us.

Any relationship recognized under the FSIA between the
Dead Sea Companies and Israel had been severed before suit
was commenced. As a result, the Dead Sea Companies
would not be entitled to instrumentality status even if their
theory that instrumentality status could be conferred on a
subsidiary were accepted.

* * *
For these reasons, we hold first that a foreign state must
itself own a majority of the shares of a corporation if the
corporation is to be deemed an instrumentality of the state
under the provisions of the FSIA; and we hold second that
instrumentality status is determined at the time of the filing
of the complaint.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals in No. 01-594
is affirmed, and the writ of certiorari in No. 01-593 is
dismissed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice O'Connor joins,
concurring in part and dissenting in part.

I join Parts I, II-A, and II-C, and dissent only from
Part II-B, of the Court's opinion. Unlike the majority,
I believe that the statutory phrase "other ownership interest
. . . owned by a foreign state," 28 U. S. C. $ 1603(b)(2), covers
a Foreign Nation's legal interest in a Corporate Subsidiary,
where that interest consists of the Foreign Nation's ownership of a Corporate Parent that owns the shares of the
Subsidiary.

Opinion of Breyer, J.
The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA)sets forth legal criteria for determining when a "foreign

state," 28 U. S. C. $ 1603(a), can assert a defense of sovereignimmunity. The FSIA also specifies that a "foreign state"
defendant may ask a federal court to make the relevantsovereign immunity determination. $ 1441(d). And the
FSIA allows certain foreign-state commercial entities not
entitled to sovereign immunity to have the merits of a caseheard in federal court. $$ 1330(a), 1441(d), 1605(a)(2).

These last-mentioned entities, entitled to invoke federal-court jurisdiction, include corporations that fall within the
FSIA's definition of an "agency or instrumentality of a foreign state," $$ 1603(a), (b).

The corporate defendants here, subsidiaries of a foreign
parent corporation, fall within that definition if "a majority
of [their] shares or other ownership interest is owned by"
a foreign nation. $ 1603(b)(2) (emphasis added). The relevant foreign nation does not directly own a majority of the
corporate subsidiaries' shares. But (simplifying the facts) it
does own a corporate parent, which, in turn, owns the corporate subsidiaries' shares. See ante, at 473-474.

Does this type of majority-ownership interest count as an
example of what the statute calls an "other ownership interest"? The Court says no, holding that the text of the FSIA
requires that "only direct ownership of a majority of shares
by the foreign state satisfies the statutory requirement."
Ante, at 474 (emphasis added). I disagree.

The statute's language, standing alone, cannot answer the
question. That is because the words "own" and "ownership"--neither of which is defined in the FSIA--are not technical terms or terms of art but common terms, the precise
legal meaning of which depends upon the statutory context
in which they appear. See J. Cribbet & C. Johnson, Principles of the Law of Property 16 (3d ed. 1989) ("AngloAmerican law has not made much use of the term ownership
in a technical sense"); Black's Law Dictionary 1049, 1105 (6th

ed. 1990) ("The term [`owner'] is . . . a nomen generalissi-mum"--a "term of the most general meaning" or "of the

most general kind"--"and its meaning is to be gathered fromthe connection in which it is used, and from the subjectmatter to which it is applied"). See also Williams v. Taylor,529 U. S. 420, 431 (2000) ("We give the words of a statute
their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning, absent an indication Congress intended them to bear some dif-ferent import" (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis

added)).Thus, this Court has held that "ship

owne[r]" can include
a corporate shareholder even though, technically speaking,
the corporation, not the shareholder, owns the ship. Flink
v. Paladini, 279 U. S. 59, 62-63 (1929) (emphasis added).
Moreover, this Court has held that a trademark can be
"owned by" a parent corporation even though, technically
speaking, a subsidiary corporation, not the parent, registered
and thus owned the mark. K mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc.,
486 U. S. 281, 292 (1988) (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (emphasis
added) (noting "the inability to discern" which "entit[y] . . .
can be said to `own' the . . . trademark if . . . the domestic
subsidiary is wholly owned by its foreign parent"); id., at 318
(Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("It
may be reasonable for some purposes to say that a trademark nominally owned by a domestic subsidiary is `owned
by' its foreign parent corporation"); id., at 319 ("A parent
corporation may or may not be said to `own' the assets owned
by its subsidiary"). Similarly, here the words "other ownership interest" might, or might not, refer to the kind of
majority-ownership interest that arises when one owns the
shares of a parent that, in turn, owns a subsidiary. If a
shareholder in Company A is an "owner" of Company A's
ship, as in Flink, then why should the shareholder not be an
"owner" of Company A's subsidiary? If Company A's trademark can be said to be "owned by" its shareholder, as in
K mart, then why should Company A's subsidiary not be said

Opinion of Breyer, J.
to be "owned by" its shareholder? And, at the very least,can we not say that the shareholder has an "ownership interest" in the subsidiary?Neither do the various linguistic indicia to which the majority points help resolve the question. As the majoritypoints out, the statute's use of the word "shares" leans in
favor of reading "ownership" as incorporating formal, technical American legal requirements. Ante, at 474-475. Butany resulting suggestion of formal technical limitation is

neatly counterbalanced by the fact that the "statute had tobe written for the contingency of ownership forms in other
countries, or even in this country, that depart from conventional corporate structures." Ante, at 476. And given this
latter necessity, there is no reason to read the phrase "shares
or other" as if those words meant to exclude from the scope
of "other" any kind of mixed, say, debt/equity, ownership arrangement that might involve shares only in part.

The majority's further claim that Congress' use of the
word "ownership" means "only direct ownership," ante, at
474 (emphasis added), or formal ownership, founders upon
Flink, supra, and K mart, supra, as well as upon several
statutes that demonstrate that Congress felt it necessary explicitly to use the word "direct" (a word missing in the FSIA)
in order to achieve that result. See, e. g., 20 U. S. C. $ 1087-
3(a) ("common shares . . . directly owned by a Holding Company" (emphasis added)); 26 U. S. C. $ 165(g)(3)(A) (requiring
that "the taxpayer owns directly stock" in a corporation (emphasis added)); $ 851(c)(3)(A) (stock "owned directly by one
or more of the other corporations" (emphasis added)). Were
the Court's logic correct, see ante, at 476-477, the word "direct" in these statutes would be redundant.

The majority's "veil piercing" argument, ante, at 475-476,
is beside the point. So is the majority's reiteration of the
separateness of a corporation and its shareholders, ante, at
474-475, a formal separateness that this statute explicitly
sets aside. See 28 U. S. C. $$ 1603(a), (b) (acknowledging the

separateness of a corporate entity but nevertheless deliber-ately conferring the "foreign state" status of the shareholder

upon the corporation itself ); H. R. Rep. No. 94-1487, p. 15(1976) (same). See also Working Group of the American Bar
Association, Reforming the Foreign Sovereign ImmunitiesAct, 40 Colum. J. Transnat'l L. 489, 517-518 (2002) (hereinafter ABA Working Group) (FSIA rejects the "separateentity" rule that courts had often applied to deny immunityto state-owned corporations).

Statutory interpretation is not a game of blind man's bluff.Judges are free to consider statutory language in light of a
statute's basic purposes. And here, as in Flink, supra, and
K mart, supra, an examination of those purposes sheds considerable light. The statute itself makes clear that it seeks:
(1) to provide a foreign-state defendant in a legal action the
right to have its claim of a sovereign immunity bar decided
by the "courts of the United States," i. e., the federal courts,
28 U. S. C. $ 1604; see $ 1441(d); and (2) to make certain that
the merits of unbarred claims against foreign states, say,
states engaging in commercial activities, see $ 1605(a)(2), will
be decided "in the same manner" as similar claims against
"a private individual," $ 1606; but (3) to guarantee a foreign
state defending an unbarred claim certain protections, including a prohibition of punitive damages, the right to
removal to federal court, a trial before a judge, and other

procedural rights (related to service of process, venue,
attachment, and execution of judgments). $$ 1330, 1391(f),
1441(d), 1606, 1608-1611. See Verlinden B. V. v. Central
Bank of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480, 497 (1983) ("Congress deliberately sought to channel cases against foreign sovereigns
away from the state courts and into federal courts"); H. R.
Rep. No. 94-1487, at 32 ("giv[ing] foreign states clear authority to remove to a Federal forum actions brought against
them in the State courts" in light of "the potential sensitivity
of actions against foreign states and the importance of developing a uniform body of law in this area"); id., at 13 ("Such

Opinion of Breyer, J.
broad jurisdiction in the Federal courts should be conduciveto uniformity in decision, which is desirable since a disparate

treatment of cases involving foreign governments may haveadverse foreign relations consequences").

Most important for present purposes, the statute seeks toguarantee these protections to the foreign nation not only
when it acts directly in its own name but also when it acts
through separate legal entities, including corporations andother "organ[s]." 28 U. S. C. $ 1603(b).

Given these purposes, what might lead Congress to grantprotection to a Foreign Nation acting through a Corporate
Parent but deny the same protection to the Foreign Nation
acting through, for example, a wholly owned Corporate Subsidiary? The answer to this question is: In terms of the
statute's purposes, nothing at all would lead Congress to
make such a distinction.

As far as this statute is concerned, decisions about how to
incorporate, how to structure corporate entities, or whether
to act through a single corporate layer or through several
corporate layers are matters purely of form, not of substance.
Cf. H. R. Rep. No. 94-1487, at 15 (agencies or instrumentalities "could assume a variety of forms"); First Nat. City Bank
v. Banco Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba, 462 U. S. 611,
625 (1983) (noting that "developing countries" often "establish separate juridical entities . . . to make large-scale national investments"). The need for federal-court determination of a sovereign immunity claim is no less important
where subsidiaries are involved. The need for procedural
protections is no less compelling. The risk of adverse foreign policy consequences is no less great. See ABA Working Group 523 ("The strength of a foreign state's sovereign
interests . . . does not necessarily dissipate when it employs
more complicated legal structures resembling those used by
modern private businesses"); Dellapenna, Refining the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, 9 Willamette J. Int'l L. &
Disp. Resol. 57, 92-93 (2001). See also A. Kumar, The State

Opinion of Breyer, J.
Holding Company: Issues and Options 3 (World Bank Discus-sion Paper No. 187, 1992) ("The existence of state holding

companies, in many variants, is widespread").That is why I doubt the majority's claim that its reading
of the text of the FSIA is "[t]he better reading," ante, at 476,leading to "[t]he better rule,"

ante, at 477. The majority's
rule is not better for a foreign nation, say, Mexico or Honduras, which may use "a tiered corporate structure to manageand control important areas of national interest, such as natural resources," ABA Working Group 523, and, as a result,will find its ability to use the federal courts to adjudicate
matters of national importance and "potential sensitivity" restricted, H. R. Rep. No. 94-1487, at 32. Congress is most
unlikely to characterize as "better" a rule tied to legal formalities that undercuts its basic jurisdictional objectives.
And working lawyers will now have to factor into complex corporate restructuring equations (determining, say,
whether to use an intermediate holding company when merging or disaggregating even wholly owned government corporations) a risk that the government might lose its previously available access to federal court.

Given these consequences, from what perspective can the
Court's unnecessarily technical reading of this part of the
statute produce a "better rule"? To hold, as the Court does
today, that for purposes of the FSIA "other ownership interest" does not include the interest that a Foreign Nation has
in a tiered Corporate Subsidiary "would be not merely to
depart from the primary rule that words are to be taken in
their ordinary sense, but to narrow the operation of the statute to an extent that would seriously imperil the accomplishment of its purpose." Danciger v. Cooley, 248 U. S. 319,
326 (1919).

I believe that the Court should decide this issue just as it
decided Flink. There, the Court unanimously determined
that, in light of "[t]he policy of the statutes" in question, a
corporate shareholder was an "owner" of a ship, which, tech538US2 Unit: $U44 [10-27-04 11:22:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

nically speaking, belonged to the corporation. 279 U. S., at62-63. Justice Holmes wrote, in his opinion for the Court:

"For th[e] purpose [of these statutes] no rational distinc-tion can be taken between several persons owning
shares in a vessel [here, a subsidiary] directly and mak-ing the same division by putting the title in a corporation and distributing the corporate stock. The policy ofthe statutes must extend equally to both. . . . We are of
[the] opinion that the words of the acts must be takenin a broad and popular sense in order not to defeat the
manifest intent. This is not to ignore the distinctionbetween a corporation and its members, a distinction
that cannot be overlooked even in extreme cases . . . ,but to interpret an untechnical word [`owner'] in the
liberal way in which we believe it to have been used. . . ."

FRANCHISE TAX BOARD OF CALIFORNIA v. HYATT

et al.

certiorari to the supreme court of nevada
No. 02-42. Argued February 24, 2003--Decided April 23, 2003
Respondent Hyatt's (hereinafter respondent) "part-year" 1991 California

income-tax return represented that he had ceased to be a California
resident and had become a Nevada resident in October 1991, shortly
before he received substantial licensing fees. Petitioner California
Franchise Tax Board (CFTB) determined that he was a California resident until April 1992, and accordingly issued notices of proposed assessments for 1991 and 1992 and imposed substantial civil fraud penalties.
Respondent filed suit against CFTB in a Nevada state court, alleging
that CFTB had directed numerous contacts at Nevada and had committed negligence and intentional torts during the course of its audit of
respondent. In its motion for summary judgment or dismissal, CFTB
argued that the state court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because
full faith and credit and other legal principles required that the court
apply California law immunizing CFTB from suit. Upon denial of that
motion, CFTB petitioned the Nevada Supreme Court for a writ of mandamus ordering dismissal. The latter court ultimately granted the petition in part and denied it in part, holding that the lower court should
have declined to exercise its jurisdiction over the underlying negligence
claim under comity principles, but that the intentional tort claims could
proceed to trial. Among other things, the court noted that Nevada immunizes its state agencies from suits for discretionary acts but not for
intentional torts committed within the course and scope of employment
and held that affording CFTB statutory immunity with respect to intentional torts would contravene Nevada's interest in protecting its citizens
from injurious intentional torts and bad faith acts committed by sister
States' government employees.

Held: The Full Faith and Credit Clause, U. S. Const., Art. IV, $ 1, does

not require Nevada to give full faith and credit to California's statutes
providing its tax agency with immunity from suit. The full faith and
credit command "is exacting" with respect to a final judgment rendered
by a court with adjudicatory authority over the subject matter and persons governed by the judgment, Baker v. General Motors Corp., 522
U. S. 222, 233, but is less demanding with respect to choice of laws. The
Clause does not compel a State to substitute the statutes of other States
for its own statutes dealing with a subject matter concerning which it

Syllabus
is competent to legislate. E. g., Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman, 486 U. S. 717,
722. Nevada is undoubtedly competent to legislate with respect to the
subject matter of the alleged intentional torts here, which, it is claimed,
have injured one of its citizens within its borders. CFTB argues unpersuasively that this Court should adopt a "new rule" mandating that a
state court extend full faith and credit to a sister State's statutorily
recaptured sovereign immunity from suit when a refusal to do so would
interfere with the State's capacity to fulfill its own sovereign responsibilities. The Court has, in the past, appraised and balanced state interests when invoking the Full Faith and Credit Clause to resolve conflicts
between overlapping laws of coordinate States. See, e. g., Bradford
Elec. Light Co. v. Clapper, 286 U. S. 145. However, this balancing-ofinterests approach quickly proved unsatisfactory and the Court abandoned it, Allstate Ins. Co. v. Hague, 449 U. S. 302, 308, n. 10, 322, n. 6,
339, n. 6, recognizing, instead, that it is frequently the case under the
Clause that a court can lawfully apply either the law of one State or the
contrary law of another, Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman, supra, at 727. The
Court has already ruled that the Full Faith and Credit Clause does not
require a forum State to apply a sister State's sovereign immunity statutes where such application would violate the forum State's own legitimate public policy. Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S. 410, 424. There is no
constitutionally significant distinction between the degree to which the
allegedly tortious acts here and in Hall are related to a core sovereign
function. States' sovereignty interests are not foreign to the full faith
and credit command, but the Court is not presented here with a case in
which a State has exhibited a "policy of hostility to the public Acts" of
a sister State. Carroll v. Lanza, 349 U. S. 408, 413. The Nevada Supreme Court sensitively applied comity principles with a healthy regard
for California's sovereign status, relying on the contours of Nevada's
own sovereign immunity from suit as a benchmark for its analysis.

Opinion of the Court
respondent's claim that he had changed residency shortly before receiving substantial licensing fees for certain patented
inventions related to computer technology.

At the conclusion of its audit, CFTB determined that respondent was a California resident until April 3, 1992, and
accordingly issued notices of proposed assessments for income taxes for 1991 and 1992 and imposed substantial civil
fraud penalties. Id., at 56-57, 58-59. Respondent protested the proposed assessments and penalties in California
through CFTB's administrative process. See Cal. Rev. &
Tax. Code Ann. $$ 19041, 19044-19046 (West 1994).

On January 6, 1998, with the administrative protest ongoing in California, respondent filed a lawsuit against CFTB
in Nevada in Clark County District Court. Respondent

alleges that CFTB directed "numerous and continuous contacts . . . at Nevada" and committed several torts during the
course of the audit, including invasion of privacy, outrageous
conduct, abuse of process, fraud, and negligent misrepresentation. App. to Pet. for Cert. 51-52, 54. Respondent seeks
punitive and compensatory damages. Id., at 51-52. He
also sought a declaratory judgment "confirm[ing] [his] status
as a Nevada resident effective as of September 26, 1991,"
id., at 51, but the District Court dismissed the claim for lack
of subject matter jurisdiction on April 16, 1999, App. 93-95.

During the discovery phase of the Nevada lawsuit, CFTB
filed a petition in the Nevada Supreme Court for a writ of
mandamus, or in the alternative, for a writ of prohibition,
challenging certain of the District Court's discovery orders.
While that petition was pending, CFTB filed a motion in the
District Court for summary judgment or, in the alternative,
for dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. CFTB argued that the
District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because
principles of sovereign immunity, full faith and credit, choice
of law, comity, and administrative exhaustion all required
that the District Court apply California law, under which:

Opinion of the Court
"Neither a public entity nor a public employee is liablefor an injury caused by:

"(a) Instituting any judicial or administrative proceedingor action for or incidental to the assessment or collection
of a tax [or]
"(b) An act or omission in the interpretation or application of any law relating to a tax." Cal. Govt. Code Ann.$ 860.2 (West 1995).

The District Court denied CFTB's motion for summary judgment or dismissal, prompting CFTB to file a second petition
in the Nevada Supreme Court. This petition sought a writ
of mandamus ordering the dismissal of the case, or in the
alternative, a writ of prohibition and mandamus limiting the
scope of the suit to claims arising out of conduct that occurred in Nevada.

On June 13, 2001, the Nevada Supreme Court granted
CFTB's second petition, dismissed the first petition as moot,
and ordered the District Court to enter summary judgment
in favor of CFTB. App. to Pet. for Cert. 38-43. On April
4, 2002, however, the court granted respondent's petition for
rehearing, vacated its prior ruling, granted CFTB's second
petition in part, and denied it in part. Id., at 5-18. The
court held that the District Court "should have declined to
exercise its jurisdiction over the underlying negligence claim
under comity principles" but that the intentional tort claims
could proceed to trial. Id., at 7.

The Nevada Supreme Court noted that both Nevada and
California have generally waived their sovereign immunity
from suit in state court and "have extended the waivers to
their state agencies or public employees except when state
statutes expressly provide immunity." Id., at 9-10 (citing
Nev. Rev. Stat. $ 41.031 (1996); Cal. Const., Art. 3, $ 5; and
Cal. Govt. Code Ann. $ 820 (West 1995)). Whereas Nevada
has not conferred immunity on its state agencies for intentional torts committed within the course and scope of

Opinion of the Court
employment, the court acknowledged that "California has
expressly provided [CFTB] with complete immunity." App.
to Pet. for Cert. 10 (citing Cal. Govt. Code Ann. $ 860.2
(West 1995) and Mitchell v. Franchise Tax Board, 183 Cal.
App. 3d 1133, 228 Cal. Rptr. 750 (1986)). To determine
which State's law should apply, the court applied principles
of comity.

Though the Nevada Supreme Court recognized the doctrine of comity as "an accommodation policy, under which the
courts of one state voluntarily give effect to the laws and
judicial decisions of another state out of deference and respect, to promote harmonious interstate relations," the court
also recognized its duty to determine whether the application of California law "would contravene Nevada's policies
or interests," giving "due regard to the duties, obligations,
rights and convenience of Nevada's citizens." App. to Pet.
for Cert. 11. "An investigation is generally considered to be
a discretionary function," the court observed, "and Nevada
provides its [own] agencies with immunity for the performance of a discretionary function even if the discretion is
abused." Id., at 12. "[A]ffording [CFTB] statutory immunity for negligent acts," the court therefore concluded, "does
not contravene any Nevada interest in this case." Ibid.
The court accordingly held that "the district court should
have declined to exercise its jurisdiction" over respondent's
negligence claim under principles of comity. Id., at 7. With
respect to the intentional torts, however, the court held that
"affording [CFTB] statutory immunity . . . does contravene
Nevada's policies and interests in this case." Id., at 12. Because Nevada "does not allow its agencies to claim immunity
for discretionary acts taken in bad faith, or for intentional
torts committed in the course and scope of employment," the
court held that "Nevada's interest in protecting its citizens
from injurious intentional torts and bad faith acts committed
by sister states' government employees" should be accorded

greater weight "than California's policy favoring completeimmunity for its taxation agency." Id., at 12-13.

We granted certiorari to resolve whether Article IV, $ 1,of the Constitution requires Nevada to give full faith and
credit to California's statute providing its tax agency withimmunity from suit, 537 U. S. 946 (2002), and we now affirm.

II
The Constitution's Full Faith and Credit Clause provides:"Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the

public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every otherState. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe
the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedingsshall be proved, and the Effect thereof." Art. IV, $ 1. As
we have explained, "[o]ur precedent differentiates the creditowed to laws (legislative measures and common law) and to
judgments." Baker v. General Motors Corp., 522 U. S. 222,232 (1998). Whereas the full faith and credit command "is
exacting" with respect to "[a] final judgment . . . renderedby a court with adjudicatory authority over the subject matter and persons governed by the judgment," id., at 233, it isless demanding with respect to choice of laws. We have
held that the Full Faith and Credit Clause does not compel" `a state to substitute the statutes of other states for its own
statutes dealing with a subject matter concerning which itis competent to legislate.' " Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman, 486
U. S. 717, 722 (1988) (quoting Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v.Industrial Accident Comm'n, 306 U. S. 493, 501 (1939)).

The State of Nevada is undoubtedly "competent to legis-late" with respect to the subject matter of the alleged intentional torts here, which, it is claimed, have injured one of itscitizens within its borders. " `[F]or a State's substantive
law to be selected in a constitutionally permissible manner,that State must have a significant contact or significant aggregation of contacts, creating state interests, such thatchoice of its law is neither arbitrary nor fundamentally un538US2 Unit: $U45 [02-10-05 07:37:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

fair.' " Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U. S. 797, 818(1985) (quoting

Allstate Ins. Co. v. Hague, 449 U. S. 302, 312-
313 (1981) (plurality opinion)); see 472 U. S., at 822-823.Such contacts are manifest in this case: the plaintiff claims

to have suffered injury in Nevada while a resident there; andit is undisputed that at least some of the conduct alleged to
be tortious occurred in Nevada, Brief for Petitioner 33-34,
n. 16. See, e. g., Carroll v. Lanza, 349 U. S. 408, 413 (1955)("The State where the tort occurs certainly has a concern in

the problems following in the wake of the injury"); Pacific
Employers Ins. Co. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n, supra,
at 503 ("Few matters could be deemed more appropriately
the concern of the state in which [an] injury occurs or more
completely within its power").

CFTB does not contend otherwise. Instead, CFTB urges
this Court to adopt a "new rule" mandating that a state court
extend full faith and credit to a sister State's statutorily recaptured sovereign immunity from suit when a refusal to do
so would "interfer[e] with a State's capacity to fulfill its own
sovereign responsibilities." Brief for Petitioner 13 (internal
quotation marks omitted).

We have, in the past, appraised and balanced state interests when invoking the Full Faith and Credit Clause to
resolve conflicts between overlapping laws of coordinate
States. See Bradford Elec. Light Co. v. Clapper, 286 U. S.
145 (1932) (holding that the Constitution required a federal
court sitting in New Hampshire to apply a Vermont workers'
compensation statute in a tort suit brought by the administrator of a Vermont worker killed in New Hampshire). This
balancing approach quickly proved unsatisfactory. Compare
Alaska Packers Assn. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n of
Cal., 294 U. S. 532, 550 (1935) (holding that a forum State,
which was the place of hiring but not of a claimant's domicile,
could apply its own law to compensate for an accident in
another State, because "[n]o persuasive reason" was shown
for requiring application of the law of the State where the

accident occurred), with Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n, supra, at 504-505 (holding that the
State where an accident occurred could apply its own work-ers' compensation law and need not give full faith and credit

to that of the State of hiring and domicile of the employerand employee). As Justice Robert H. Jackson, recounting
these cases, aptly observed, "it [is] difficult to point to any
field in which the Court has more completely demonstratedor more candidly confessed the lack of guiding standards

of a legal character than in trying to determine what choiceof law is required by the Constitution." Full Faith and
Credit--The Lawyer's Clause of the Constitution, 45 Colum.
L. Rev. 1, 16 (1945).

In light of this experience, we abandoned the balancingof-interests approach to conflicts of law under the Full Faith
and Credit Clause. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Hague, 449 U. S., at
308, n. 10 (plurality opinion); id., at 322, n. 6 (Stevens, J.,
concurring in judgment); id., at 339, n. 6 (Powell, J., dissenting). We have recognized, instead, that "it is frequently the
case under the Full Faith and Credit Clause that a court can
lawfully apply either the law of one State or the contrary
law of another." Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman, supra, at 727.
We thus have held that a State need not "substitute the statutes of other states for its own statutes dealing with a subject matter concerning which it is competent to legislate."
Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n,
supra, at 501; see Baker v. General Motors Corp., supra, at
232; Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman, supra, at 722; Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, supra, at 818-819. Acknowledging this
shift, CFTB contends that this case demonstrates the need
for a new rule under the Full Faith and Credit Clause that
will protect "core sovereignty" interests as expressed in
state statutes delineating the contours of the State's immunity from suit. Brief for Petitioner 13.

We disagree. We have confronted the question whether
the Full Faith and Credit Clause requires a forum State to

538US2 Unit: $U45 [02-10-05 07:37:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

497Cite as: 538 U. S. 488 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
recognize a sister State's legislatively recaptured immunity
once before. In Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S. 410 (1979), an employee of the University of Nevada was involved in an automobile accident with California residents, who filed suit in
California and named Nevada as a defendant. The California courts refused to apply a Nevada statute that capped
damages in tort suits against the State on the ground that
"to surrender jurisdiction or to limit respondents' recovery
to the $25,000 maximum of the Nevada statute would be obnoxious to its statutorily based policies of jurisdiction over
nonresident motorists and full recovery." Id., at 424.

We affirmed, holding, first, that the Constitution does not
confer sovereign immunity on States in the courts of sister
States. Id., at 414-421. Petitioner does not ask us to reexamine that ruling, and we therefore decline the invitation
of petitioner's amici States, see Brief for State of Florida
et al. as Amici Curiae 2, to do so. See this Court's Rule
14.1(a); Mazer v. Stein, 347 U. S. 201, 206, n. 5 (1954) ("We
do not reach for constitutional questions not raised by the
parties").

The question presented here instead implicates Hall's second holding: that the Full Faith and Credit Clause did not
require California to apply Nevada's sovereign immunity
statutes where such application would violate California's
own legitimate public policy. 440 U. S., at 424. The Court
observed in a footnote:

"California's exercise of jurisdiction in this case poses
no substantial threat to our constitutional system of cooperative federalism. Suits involving traffic accidents
occurring outside of Nevada could hardly interfere with
Nevada's capacity to fulfill its own sovereign responsibilities. We have no occasion, in this case, to consider
whether different state policies, either of California or of
Nevada, might require a different analysis or a different
result." Id., at 424, n. 24.

498 FRANCHISE TAX BD. OF CAL. v. HYATT

Opinion of the Court
CFTB asserts that an analysis of this lawsuit's effects shouldlead to a different result: that the Full Faith and Credit

Clause requires Nevada to apply California's immunity stat-ute to avoid interference with California's "sovereign responsibility" of enforcing its income tax laws. Brief for Peti-tioner 13.

Our past experience with appraising and balancing state
interests under the Full Faith and Credit Clause counselsagainst adopting CFTB's proposed new rule. Having recognized, in Hall, that a suit against a State in a sister State'scourt "necessarily implicates the power and authority" of
both sovereigns, 440 U. S., at 416, the question of which sovereign interest should be deemed more weighty is not one
that can be easily answered. Yet petitioner's rule would elevate California's sovereignty interests above those of Nevada, were we to deem this lawsuit an interference with California's "core sovereign responsibilities." We rejected as
"unsound in principle and unworkable in practice" a rule of
state immunity from federal regulation under the Tenth
Amendment that turned on whether a particular state government function was "integral" or "traditional." Garcia v.
San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528,
546-547 (1985). CFTB has convinced us of neither the relative soundness nor the relative practicality of adopting a similar distinction here.

Even were we inclined to embark on a course of balancing
States' competing sovereign interests to resolve conflicts of
laws under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, this case would
not present the occasion to do so. There is no principled
distinction between Nevada's interests in tort claims arising
out of its university employee's automobile accident, at issue
in Hall, and California's interests in the tort claims here arising out of its tax collection agency's residency audit. To be
sure, the power to promulgate and enforce income tax laws
is an essential attribute of sovereignty. See Franchise Tax
Bd. of Cal. v. Postal Service, 467 U. S. 512, 523 (1984)

538US2 Unit: $U45 [02-10-05 07:37:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
(" `[T]axes are the life-blood of government' " (quoting Bullv.

United States, 295 U. S. 247, 259-260 (1935))). But the
university employee's educational mission in Hall might alsobe so described. Cf.

Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S.
483, 493 (1954) ("[E]ducation is perhaps the most importantfunction of state and local governments").

If we were to compare the degree to which the allegedly
tortious acts here and in Hall are related to a core sovereignfunction, we would be left to ponder the relationship between an automobile accident and educating, on one hand,and the intrusions alleged here and collecting taxes, on the
other. We discern no constitutionally significant distinctionbetween these relationships. To the extent CFTB complains of the burdens and expense of out-of-state litigation,
and the diversion of state resources away from the performance of important state functions, those burdens do not distinguish this case from any other out-of-state lawsuit against
California or one of its agencies.

States' sovereignty interests are not foreign to the full
faith and credit command. But we are not presented here
with a case in which a State has exhibited a "policy of hostility to the public Acts" of a sister State. Carroll v. Lanza,
349 U. S., at 413. The Nevada Supreme Court sensitively
applied principles of comity with a healthy regard for California's sovereign status, relying on the contours of Nevada's
own sovereign immunity from suit as a benchmark for its
analysis. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 10-13.

In short, we heed the lessons learned as a result of Bradford Elec. Light Co. v. Clapper, 286 U. S. 145 (1932), and its
progeny. Without a rudder to steer us, we decline to embark on the constitutional course of balancing coordinate
States' competing sovereign interests to resolve conflicts of
laws under the Full Faith and Credit Clause.

The judgment of the Nevada Supreme Court is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

MASSARO v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 01-1559. Argued February 25, 2003--Decided April 23, 2003
Petitioner Massaro was indicted on federal racketeering charges in connection with a murder. The day before his trial began, prosecutors
learned of a bullet allegedly recovered from the car in which the victim's
body was found, but did not inform defense counsel until the trial was
underway. Defense counsel more than once declined the trial court's
offer of a continuance so the bullet could be examined. Massaro was
convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. On direct appeal his new
counsel argued that the District Court had erred in admitting the bullet
in evidence, but did not raise an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel
claim. The Second Circuit affirmed. Massaro later moved to vacate
his conviction under 28 U. S. C. $ 2255, claiming, as relevant here, that
his trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance in failing to accept
the trial court's offer of a continuance. The District Court found his
claim procedurally defaulted because he could have raised it on direct
appeal. In affirming, the Second Circuit adhered to its precedent that,
when the defendant is represented by new counsel on appeal and the
ineffective-assistance claim is based solely on the trial record, the claim
must be raised on direct appeal; failure to do so results in procedural
default unless the petitioner shows cause and prejudice.

Held: An ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim may be brought in a collateral proceeding under $ 2255, whether or not the petitioner could have
raised the claim on direct appeal. Requiring a criminal defendant to
bring ineffective-assistance claims on direct appeal does not promote
the procedural default rule's objectives: conserving judicial resources
and respecting the law's important interest in the finality of judgments.
Applying that rule to ineffective-assistance claims would create a risk
that defendants would feel compelled to raise the issue before there has
been an opportunity fully to develop the claim's factual predicate, and
would raise the issue for the first time in a forum not best suited to
assess those facts, even if the record contains some indication of deficiencies in counsel's performance. A $ 2255 motion is preferable to direct appeal for deciding an ineffective-assistance claim. When a claim
is brought on direct appeal, appellate counsel and the court must proceed on a trial record that is not developed precisely for, and is therefore

Syllabus
often incomplete or inadequate for, the purpose of litigating or preserving the claim. A defendant claiming ineffective counsel must show that
counsel's actions were not supported by a reasonable strategy and that
the error was prejudicial. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668.
The evidence introduced at trial, however, will be devoted to guilt
or innocence issues, and the resulting record may not disclose the
facts necessary to decide either prong of the Strickland analysis.
Under the rule announced here, ineffective-assistance claims ordinarily
will be litigated in the first instance in the district court, the forum best
suited to developing the facts necessary to determining the adequacy of
representation during an entire trial. The court may take testimony
from witnesses for the defendant and the prosecution and from the
counsel alleged to have rendered the deficient performance. In addition, the $ 2255 motion often will be ruled upon by the district judge
who presided at trial, who should have an advantageous perspective
for determining the effectiveness of counsel's conduct and whether any
deficiencies were prejudicial. This Court does not hold that ineffectiveassistance claims must be reserved for collateral review, as there may
be cases in which trial counsel's ineffectiveness is so apparent from the
record that appellate counsel will raise the issue on direct appeal or in
which obvious deficiencies in representation will be addressed by an
appellate court sua sponte. In such cases, certain questions may arise
in subsequent $ 2255 proceedings concerning the conclusiveness of
determinations made on the claims raised on direct appeal; but these
implementation matters are not before the Court. Pp. 504-509.

502 MASSARO v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
Petitioner, Joseph Massaro, was indicted on federal rack-eteering charges, including murder in aid of racketeering, 18

U. S. C. $ 1962(d), in connection with the shooting death ofJoseph Fiorito. He was tried in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York. The day be-fore Massaro's trial was to begin, prosecutors learned of
what appeared to be a critical piece of evidence: a bullet al-legedly recovered from the car in which the victim's body
was found. They waited for several days, however, to in-form defense counsel of this development. Not until the
trial was underway and the defense had made its openingstatement did they make this disclosure. After the trial
court and the defense had been informed of the developmentbut still during the course of trial, defense counsel more than
once declined the trial court's offer of a continuance so thebullet could be examined. Massaro was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.On direct appeal new counsel for Massaro argued the District Court had erred in admitting the bullet in evidence, buthe did not raise any claim relating to ineffective assistance of
trial counsel. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
affirmed the conviction. Judgt. order reported at 57 F. 3d1063 (1995).

Massaro later filed a motion under 28 U. S. C. $ 2255, seek-ing to vacate his conviction. As relevant here, he claimed
that his trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance infailing to accept the trial court's offer to grant a continuance.
The United States District Court for the Southern Districtof New York found this claim procedurally defaulted because
Massaro could have raised it on direct appeal.The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.

assistance claim against himself. Nevertheless, it adheredto its decision in

Billy-Eko v. United States, 8 F. 3d 111
(1993). Under Billy-Eko, when the defendant is repre-sented by new counsel on appeal and the ineffectiveassistance claim is based solely on the record made at trial,the claim must be raised on direct appeal; failure to do so
results in procedural default unless the petitioner shows
cause and prejudice. Finding that Massaro was representedby new counsel on appeal, that his trial counsel's ineffectiveness was evident from the record, and that he had failed toshow cause or prejudice, the Court of Appeals held him procedurally barred from bringing the ineffective-assistance
claim on collateral review.

We granted certiorari. 536 U. S. 990 (2002). Petitioner
now urges us to hold that claims of ineffective assistance of
counsel need not be raised on direct appeal, whether or not
there is new counsel and whether or not the basis for the
claim is apparent from the trial record. The Federal Courts
of Appeals are in conflict on this question, with the Seventh
Circuit joining the Second Circuit, see Guinan v. United
States, 6 F. 3d 468 (CA7 1993), and 10 other Federal Courts
of Appeals taking the position that there is no procedural
default for failure to raise an ineffective-assistance claim on
direct appeal, see, e. g., United States v. Cofske, 157 F. 3d 1,
2 (CA1 1998), cert. denied, 526 U. S. 1059 (1999); United
States v. Jake, 281 F. 3d 123, 132, n. 7 (CA3 2002); United

504 MASSARO v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
We agree with the majority of the Courts of Appeals, andwe reverse.

The background for our discussion is the general rule thatclaims not raised on direct appeal may not be raised on collateral review unless the petitioner shows cause and preju-dice. See

United States v. Frady, 456 U. S. 152, 167-168
(1982); Bousley v. United States, 523 U. S. 614, 621-622
(1998). The procedural-default rule is neither a statutorynor a constitutional requirement, but it is a doctrine adhered

to by the courts to conserve judicial resources and to respectthe law's important interest in the finality of judgments.
We conclude that requiring a criminal defendant to bring
ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims on direct appeal does
not promote these objectives.

As Judge Easterbrook has noted, "[r]ules of procedure
should be desig ned to induce litigants to present their
contenti ons to the right tribunal at the right time. "
Guinan, supra, at 474 (concurring opinion). Applying the
usual procedural-default rule to ineffective-assistance claims
would have the opposite effect, creating the risk that defendants would feel compelled to raise the issue before there has
been an opportunity fully to develop the factual predicate for
the claim. Furthermore, the issue would be raised for the
first time in a forum not best suited to assess those facts.
This is so even if the record contains some indication of
deficiencies in counsel's performance. The better-reasoned
approach is to permit ineffective-assistance claims to be
brought in the first instance in a timely motion in the district
court under $ 2255. We hold that an ineffective-assistanceof-counsel claim may be brought in a collateral proceeding
under $ 2255, whether or not the petitioner could have raised
the claim on direct appeal.

In light of the way our system has developed, in most cases
a motion brought under $ 2255 is preferable to direct appeal for deciding claims of ineffective assistance. When an
ineffective-assistance claim is brought on direct appeal, ap538US2 Unit: $U46 [11-02-04 17:53:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

505Cite as: 538 U. S. 500 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
pellate counsel and the court must proceed on a trial recordnot developed precisely for the object of litigating or preserving the claim and thus often incomplete or inadequatefor this purpose. Under

Strickland v. Washington, 466
U. S. 668 (1984), a defendant claiming ineffective counselmust show that counsel's actions were not supported by

a reasonable strategy and that the error was prejudicial.
The evidence introduced at trial, however, will be devoted toissues of guilt or innocence, and the resulting record in many

cases will not disclose the facts necessary to decide eitherprong of the

Strickland analysis. If the alleged error is
one of commission, the record may reflect the action taken
by counsel but not the reasons for it. The appellate court
may have no way of knowing whether a seemingly unusual
or misguided action by counsel had a sound strategic motive
or was taken because the counsel's alternatives were even
worse. See Guinan, supra, at 473 (Easterbrook, J., concurring) ("No matter how odd or deficient trial counsel's
performance may seem, that lawyer may have had a reason
for acting as he did. . . . Or it may turn out that counsel's
overall performance was sufficient despite a glaring omission . . ."). The trial record may contain no evidence of alleged errors of omission, much less the reasons underlying
them. And evidence of alleged conflicts of interest might be
found only in attorney-client correspondence or other documents that, in the typical criminal trial, are not introduced.
See, e. g., Billy-Eko, supra, at 114. Without additional factual development, moreover, an appellate court may not be
able to ascertain whether the alleged error was prejudicial.

Under the rule we adopt today, ineffective-assistance
claims ordinarily will be litigated in the first instance in the
district court, the forum best suited to developing the facts
necessary to determining the adequacy of representation
during an entire trial. The court may take testimony from
witnesses for the defendant and the prosecution and from the
counsel alleged to have rendered the deficient performance.

Opinion of the Court
See, e. g., Griffin, 699 F. 2d, at 1109 (In a $ 2255 proceeding,the defendant "has a full opportunity to prove facts establishing ineffectiveness of counsel, the government has a fullopportunity to present evidence to the contrary, the district
court hears spoken words we can see only in print and seesexpressions we will never see, and a factual record bearing
precisely on the issue is created"); Beaulieu v. United States,
930 F. 2d 805 (CA10 1991) (partially rev'd on other grounds,
United States v. Galloway, 56 F. 3d 1239 (CA10 1995). In
addition, the $ 2255 motion often will be ruled upon by thesame district judge who presided at trial. The judge, having observed the earlier trial, should have an advantageous
perspective for determining the effectiveness of counsel's
conduct and whether any deficiencies were prejudicial.

The Second Circuit's rule creates inefficiencies for courts
and counsel, both on direct appeal and in the collateral proceeding. On direct appeal it puts counsel into an awkward
position vis-a` -vis trial counsel. Appellate counsel often
need trial counsel's assistance in becoming familiar with
a lengthy record on a short deadline, but trial counsel will
be unwilling to help appellate counsel familiarize himself
with a record for the purpose of understanding how it reflects trial counsel's own incompetence.

Subjecting ineffective-assistance claims to the usual causeand-prejudice rule also would create perverse incentives
for counsel on direct appeal. To ensure that a potential

ineffective-assistance claim is not waived--and to avoid incurring a claim of ineffective counsel at the appellate stage--
counsel would be pressured to bring claims of ineffective
trial counsel, regardless of merit.

Even meritorious claims would fail when brought on direct
appeal if the trial record were inadequate to support them.
Appellate courts would waste time and resources attempting
to address some claims that were meritless and other claims
that, though colorable, would be handled more efficiently if
addressed in the first instance by the district court on col538US2 Unit: $U46 [11-02-04 17:53:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
lateral review. See, e. g., United States v. Galloway, supra,at 1241 ("threat of . . . procedural bar has doubtless resulted

in many claims being asserted on direct appeal only to pro-tect the record . . . unnecessarily burden[ing] both the parties and the court . . ."). This concern is far from spec-ulative. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in
light of its rule applying procedural default to ineffectiveassistance claims, has urged counsel to "err on the side ofinclusion on direct appeal,"

Billy-Eko, 8 F. 3d, at 116.
On collateral review, the Second Circuit's rule would causeadditional inefficiencies. Under that rule a court on collateral review must determine whether appellate counsel is
"new." Questions may arise, for example, about whether a
defendant has retained new appellate counsel when different
lawyers in the same law office handle trial and appeal. The
habeas court also must engage in a painstaking review of the
trial record solely to determine if it was sufficient to support
the ineffectiveness claim and thus whether it should have
been brought on direct appeal. A clear rule allowing these
claims to be brought in a proceeding under $ 2255, by contrast, will eliminate these requirements. Although we could
"require the parties and the district judges to search for needles in haystacks--to seek out the rare claim that could have
been raised on direct appeal, and deem it waived," Guinan,
6 F. 3d, at 475 (Easterbrook, J., concurring)--we do not see
the wisdom in requiring a court to spend time on exercises
that, in most instances, will produce no benefit. It is a better use of judicial resources to allow the district court on
collateral review to turn at once to the merits.

The most to be said for the rule in the Second Circuit is
that it will speed resolution of some ineffective-assistance
claims. For the reasons discussed, however, we think few
such claims will be capable of resolution on direct appeal and
thus few will benefit from earlier resolution. And the benefits of the Second Circuit's rule in those rare instances are
outweighed by the increased judicial burden the rule would

508 MASSARO v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
impose in many other cases, where a district court on col-lateral review would be forced to conduct the cause-andprejudice analysis before turning to the merits. The SecondCircuit's rule, moreover, does not produce the benefits of
other rules requiring claims to be raised at the earliestopportunity--such as the contemporaneous objection rule--
because here, raising the claim on direct appeal does not permit the trial court to avoid the potential error in the firstplace.

A growing majority of state courts now follow the rule weadopt today. For example, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania recently changed its position to hold that "a claim raising trial counsel ineffectiveness will no longer be considered
waived because new counsel on direct appeal did not raise a
claim related to prior counsel's ineffectiveness." Commonwealth v. Grant, 572 Pa. 48, 67, 813 A. 2d 726, 738 (2002); see
also id., at 62-67, and n. 13, 813 A. 2d, at 735-738, and n. 13
(cataloging other States' case law adopting this position).

Although the Government now urges us to adopt the rule
of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the Government took the opposite approach in some previous cases, arguing not only that claims of ineffective assistance of counsel
could be brought in the first instance in a motion under

$ 2255, but that they must be brought in such a motion proceeding and not on direct appeal. See, e. g., United States
v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 667, n. 42 (1984). We do not go
this far. We do not hold that ineffective-assistance claims
must be reserved for collateral review. There may be cases
in which trial counsel's ineffectiveness is so apparent from
the record that appellate counsel will consider it advisable to
raise the issue on direct appeal. There may be instances,
too, when obvious deficiencies in representation will be
addressed by an appellate court sua sponte. In those cases,
certain questions may arise in subsequent proceedings under

$ 2255 concerning the conclusiveness of determinations made
on the ineffective-assistance claims raised on direct ap538US2 Unit: $U46 [11-02-04 17:53:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
peal; but these matters of implementation are not before us.We do hold that failure to raise an ineffective-assistanceof-counsel claim on direct appeal does not bar the claimfrom being brought in a later, appropriate proceedi ng

under $ 2255.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.

It is so ordered.

DEMORE, DISTRICT DIRECTOR, SAN FRANCISCO

DISTRICT OF IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE, et al. v. KIM

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 01-1491. Argued January 15, 2003--Decided April 29, 2003
Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U. S. C. $ 1226(c), "[t]he Attorney General shall take into custody any alien who" is removable from
this country because he has been convicted of one of a specified set of
crimes, including an "aggravated felony." After respondent, a lawful
permanent resident alien, was convicted in state court of first-degree
burglary and, later, of "petty theft with priors," the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) charged him with being deportable from
the United States in light of these convictions, and detained him pending
his removal hearing. Without disputing the validity of his convictions
or the INS' conclusion that he is deportable and therefore subject to
mandatory detention under $ 1226(c), respondent filed a habeas corpus
action challenging $ 1226(c) on the ground that his detention thereunder
violated due process because the INS had made no determination that
he posed either a danger to society or a flight risk. The District Court
agreed and granted respondent's petition subject to the INS' prompt
undertaking of an individualized bond hearing, after which respondent was released on bond. In affirming, the Ninth Circuit held that

$ 1226(c) violates substantive due process as applied to respondent
because he is a lawful permanent resident, the most favored category
of aliens. The court rejected the Government's two principal justifications for mandatory detention under $ 1226(c), discounting the first--
ensuring the presence of criminal aliens at their removal proceedings--
upon finding that not all aliens detained pursuant to $ 1226(c) would
ultimately be deported, and discounting the second--protecting the public from dangerous criminal aliens--on the grounds that the aggravated
felony classification triggering respondent's detention included crimes
(such as respondent's) that the court did not consider "egregious" or
otherwise sufficiently dangerous to the public to necessitate mandatory
detention. Relying on Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678, the court concluded that the INS had not provided a justification for no-bail civil
detention sufficient to overcome a permanent resident alien's liberty
interest.

Syllabus
Held:

1. Section 1226(e)--which states that "[t]he Attorney General's discretionary judgment regarding the application of this section shall not be
subject to review" and that "[n]o court may set aside any action or decision by the Attorney General under this section regarding the detention
or release of any alien"--does not deprive the federal courts of jurisdiction to grant habeas relief to aliens challenging their detention under

$ 1226(c). Respondent does not challenge a "discretionary judgment"
by the Attorney General or a "decision" that the Attorney General has
made regarding his detention or release. Rather, respondent challenges the statutory framework that permits his detention without bail.
Where Congress intends to preclude judicial review of constitutional
claims its intent to do so must be clear. E. g., Webster v. Doe, 486 U. S.
592, 603. And, where a provision precluding review is claimed to bar
habeas review, the Court requires a particularly clear statement that
such is Congress' intent. See INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 308-309,
298, 327. Section 1226(e) contains no explicit provision barring habeas
review. Pp. 516-517.

2. Congress, justifiably concerned with evidence that deportable
criminal aliens who are not detained continue to engage in crime and
fail to appear for their removal hearings in large numbers, may require
that persons such as respondent be detained for the brief period necessary for their removal proceedings. In the exercise of its broad power
over naturalization and immigration, Congress regularly makes rules
that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens. Mathews v. Diaz, 426
U. S. 67, 79-80. Although the Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due
process in deportation proceedings, Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 306,
detention during such proceedings is a constitutionally valid aspect of
the process, e. g., Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U. S. 228, 235, even
where, as here, aliens challenge their detention on the grounds that
there has been no finding that they are unlikely to appear for their
deportation proceedings, Carlson v. Landon, 342 U. S. 524, 538. The
INS detention of respondent, a criminal alien who has conceded that he
is deportable, for the limited period of his removal proceedings, is governed by these cases. Respondent argues unpersuasively that the

$ 1226(c) detention policy violates due process under Zadvydas, 533
U. S., at 699, in which the Court held that $ 1231(a)(6) authorizes continued detention of an alien subject to a final removal order beyond that
section's 90-day removal period for only such time as is reasonably necessary to secure the removal. Zadvydas is materially different from
the present case in two respects. First, the aliens there challenging
their detention following final deportation orders were ones for whom
removal was "no longer practically attainable," such that their detention

Syllabus
did not serve its purported immigration purpose. Id., at 690. In contrast, because the statutory provision at issue in this case governs detention of deportable criminal aliens pending their removal proceedings,
the detention necessarily serves the purpose of preventing the aliens
from fleeing prior to or during such proceedings. Second, while the
period of detention at issue in Zadvydas was "indefinite" and "potentially permanent," id., at 690-691, the record shows that $1226(c) detention not only has a definite termination point, but lasts, in the majority
of cases, for less than the 90 days the Court considered presumptively
valid in Zadvydas. Pp. 517-531.

Opinion of the Court

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.
Section 236(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 66Stat. 200, as amended, 110 Stat. 3009-585, 8 U. S. C. $ 1226(c),
provides that "[t]he Attorney General shall take into custodyany alien who" is removable from this country because he
has been convicted of one of a specified set of crimes. Re-spondent is a citizen of the Republic of South Korea. He
entered the United States in 1984, at the age of six, andbecame a lawful permanent resident of the United States
two years later. In July 1996, he was convicted of first--degree burglary in state court in California and, in April
1997, he was convicted of a second crime, "petty theft withpriors." The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)
charged respondent with being deportable from the UnitedStates in light of these convictions, and detained him pending his removal hearing.1 We hold that Congress, justifiablyconcerned that deportable criminal aliens who are not detained continue to engage in crime and fail to appear fortheir removal hearings in large numbers, may require that
persons such as respondent be detained for the brief periodnecessary for their removal proceedings.

Respondent does not dispute the validity of his prior con-victions, which were obtained following the full procedural
protections our criminal justice system offers. Respondentalso did not dispute the INS' conclusion that he is subject to

1 App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a; see 8 U. S. C. $$ 1101(a)(43)(G), 1227(a)(2)
(A)(iii). Section 1226(c) authorizes detention of aliens who have committed certain crimes including, inter alia, any "aggravated felony,"

$$ 1226(c)(1)(B), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), and any two "crimes involving moral
turpitude," $$ 1226(c)(1)(B), 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii). Although the INS initially
included only respondent's 1997 conviction in the charging document, it
subsequently amended the immigration charges against him to include his
1996 conviction for first-degree burglary as another basis for mandatory
detention and deportation. Brief for Petitioners 3, n. 2 (alleging that respondent's convictions reflected two " `crimes involving moral turpitude' ").

Opinion of the Court
mandatory detention under $ 1226(c). See Brief in Opposi-tion 1-2; App. 8-9.

2 In conceding that he was deportable,

respondent forwent a hearing at which he would have beenentitled to raise any nonfrivolous argument available to demonstrate that he was not properly included in a mandatorydetention category. See 8 CFR $ 3.19(h)(2)(ii) (2002); Matter
of Joseph, 22 I. & N. Dec. 799 (BIA 1999).3 Respondent in-stead filed a habeas corpus action pursuant to 28 U. S. C.

$ 2241 in the United States District Court for the NorthernDistrict of California challenging the constitutionality of

$ 1226(c) itself. App. to Pet. for Cert. 2a. He argued thathis detention under $ 1226(c) violated due process because
the INS had made no determination that he posed either adanger to society or a flight risk.

Id., at 31a, 33a.The District Court agreed with respondent that $ 1226(c)'s

requirement of mandatory detention for certain criminalaliens was unconstitutional. Kim v. Schiltgen, No. C 99-

2 As respondent explained: "The statute requires the [INS] to take into
custody any alien who `is deportable' from the United States based on
having been convicted of any of a wide range of crimes. . . . [Respondent]
does not challenge INS's authority to take him into custody after he finished serving his criminal sentence. His challenge is solely to Section
1226(c)'s absolute prohibition on his release from detention, even where,
as here, the INS never asserted that he posed a danger or significant flight
risk." Brief in Opposition 1-2.

3 This "Joseph hearing" is immediately provided to a detainee who

claims that he is not covered by $ 1226(c). Tr. of Oral Arg. 22. At the
hearing, the detainee may avoid mandatory detention by demonstrating
that he is not an alien, was not convicted of the predicate crime, or that
the INS is otherwise substantially unlikely to establish that he is in fact
subject to mandatory detention. See 8 CFR $ 3.19(h)(2)(ii) (2002); Matter
of Joseph, 22 I. & N. Dec. 799 (BIA 1999). Because respondent conceded
that he was deportable because of a conviction that triggers $ 1226(c) and
thus sought no Joseph hearing, we have no occasion to review the adequacy of Joseph hearings generally in screening out those who are improperly detained pursuant to $ 1226(c). Such individualized review is available, however, and Justice Souter is mistaken if he means to suggest
otherwise. See post, at 555-556, 558 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part) (hereinafter dissent).

Opinion of the Court
2257 SI (Aug. 11, 1999), App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a-51a. The
District Court therefore granted respondent's petition subject to the INS' prompt undertaking of an individualized
bond hearing to determine whether respondent posed either
a flight risk or a danger to the community. Id., at 50a. Following that decision, the District Director of the INS released respondent on $5,000 bond.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.
Kim v. Ziglar, 276 F. 3d 523 (2002). That court held that

$ 1226(c) violates substantive due process as applied to respondent because he is a permanent resident alien. Id., at
528. It noted that permanent resident aliens constitute the
most favored category of aliens and that they have the right
to reside permanently in the United States, to work here,
and to apply for citizenship. Ibid. The court recognized
and rejected the Government's two principal justifications
for mandatory detention under $ 1226(c): (1) ensuring the
presence of criminal aliens at their removal proceedings; and
(2) protecting the public from dangerous criminal aliens.
The Court of Appeals discounted the first justification because it found that not all aliens detained pursuant to

$ 1226(c) would ultimately be deported. Id., at 531-532.
And it discounted the second justification on the grounds
that the aggravated felony classification triggering respondent's detention included crimes that the court did not consider "egregious" or otherwise sufficiently dangerous to the
public to necessitate mandatory detention. Id., at 532-533.
Respondent's crimes of first-degree burglary (burglary of an
inhabited dwelling) and petty theft, for instance, the Ninth
Circuit dismissed as "rather ordinary crimes." Id., at 538.
Relying upon our recent decision in Zadvydas v. Davis, 533
U. S. 678 (2001), the Court of Appeals concluded that the INS
had not provided a justification "for no-bail civil detention
sufficient to overcome a lawful permanent resident alien's
liberty interest." 276 F. 3d, at 535.

516 DEMORE v. KIM

Opinion of the Court
Three other Courts of Appeals have reached the same con-clusion. See Patel v. Zemski, 275 F. 3d 299 (CA3 2001);

Welch v. Ashcroft, 293 F. 3d 213 (CA4 2002); Hoang v. Com-fort, 282 F. 3d 1247 (CA10 2002). The Seventh Circuit, however, rejected a constitutional challenge to $ 1226(c) by a per-manent resident alien. Parra v. Perryman, 172 F. 3d 954
(1999). We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict, see536 U. S. 956 (2002), and now reverse.

I
We address first the argument that 8 U. S. C. $ 1226(e) de-prives us of jurisdiction to hear this case. See

Florida v.Thomas, 532 U. S. 774, 777 (2001) ("Although the parties did

not raise the issue in their briefs on the merits, we must firstconsider whether we have jurisdiction to decide this case").
An amicus argues, and the concurring opinion agrees, that$ 1226(e) deprives the federal courts of jurisdiction to grant
habeas relief to aliens challenging their detention under$ 1226(c). See Brief for Washington Legal Foundation et al.
as Amici Curiae. Section 1226(e) states:

"(e) Judicial review
"The Attorney General's discretionary judgment re-garding the application of this section shall not be subject to review. No court may set aside any action ordecision by the Attorney General under this section regarding the detention or release of any alien or thegrant, revocation, or denial of bond or parole."

The amicus argues that respondent is contesting a "deci-sion by the Attorney General" to detain him under $ 1226(c),
and that, accordingly, no court may set aside that action.Brief for Washington Legal Foundation et al. as Amici
Curiae 7-8.But respondent does not challenge a "discretionary judgment" by the Attorney General or a "decision" that the At-torney General has made regarding his detention or release.

Opinion of the Court
Rather, respondent challenges the statutory framework thatpermits his detention without bail. Parra v. Perryman,

supra, at 957 ("Section 1226(e) likewise deals with challengesto operational decisions, rather than to the legislation establishing the framework for those decisions").This Court has held that "where Congress intends to preclude judicial review of constitutional claims its intent to doso must be clear."

Webster v. Doe, 486 U. S. 592, 603 (1988);see also Johnson v. Robison, 415 U. S. 361, 367 (1974) (holding that provision barring review of " `decisions of the Ad-ministrator on any question of law or fact under any law
administered by the Veterans' Administration providing ben-efits for veterans' " did not bar constitutional challenge (emphasis deleted)). And, where a provision precluding reviewis claimed to bar habeas review, the Court has required a
particularly clear statement that such is Congress' intent.See INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 308-309 (2001) (holding
that title of provision, "Elimination of Custody Review byHabeas Corpus," along with broad statement of intent to
preclude review, was not sufficient to bar review of habeascorpus petitions); see also

id., at 298 (citing cases refusing tofind bar to habeas review where there was no specific mention of the Court's authority to hear habeas petitions); id., at327 (S

calia, J., dissenting) (arguing that opinion established"a superclear statement, `magic words' requirement for

the congressional expression of " an intent to preclude ha-beas review).

Section 1226(e) contains no explicit provision barring ha-beas review, and we think that its clear text does not bar
respondent's constitutional challenge to the legislation au-thorizing his detention without bail.

II
Having determined that the federal courts have jurisdic-tion to review a constitutional challenge to $ 1226(c), we proceed to review respondent's claim. Section 1226(c) man538US2 Unit: $U47 [02-09-05 15:24:15] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Opinion of the Court
dates detention during removal proceedings for a limitedclass of deportable aliens--including those convicted of an

aggravated felony. Congress adopted this provision againsta backdrop of wholesale failure by the INS to deal with increasing rates of criminal activity by aliens. See, e. g.,Criminal Aliens in the United States: Hearings before the
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate
Committee on Governmental Affairs, 103d Cong., 1st Sess.(1993); S. Rep. No. 104-48, p. 1 (1995) (hereinafter S. Rep.

104-48) (confinement of criminal aliens alone cost $724 mil-lion in 1990). Criminal aliens were the fastest growing segment of the federal prison population, already constituting
roughly 25% of all federal prisoners, and they formed a rapidly rising share of state prison populations as well. Id., at
6-9. Congress' investigations showed, however, that the
INS could not even identify most deportable aliens, much
less locate them and remove them from the country. Id.,
at 1. One study showed that, at the then-current rate of
deportation, it would take 23 years to remove every criminal
alien already subject to deportation. Id., at 5. Making
matters worse, criminal aliens who were deported swiftly
reentered the country illegally in great numbers. Id., at 3.

The INS' near-total inability to remove deportable criminal aliens imposed more than a monetary cost on the Nation.
First, as Congress explained, "[a]liens who enter or remain
in the United States in violation of our law are effectively
taking immigration opportunities that might otherwise be
extended to others." S. Rep. No. 104-249, p. 7 (1996). Second, deportable criminal aliens who remained in the United
States often committed more crimes before being removed.
One 1986 study showed that, after criminal aliens were identified as deportable, 77% were arrested at least once more
and 45%--nearly half--were arrested multiple times before
their deportation proceedings even began. Hearing on
H. R. 3333 before the Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees, and International Law of the House Committee on the

1989 House Hearing); see also Zadvydas, 533 U. S., at 713-
714 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (discussing high rates of recidivism for released criminal aliens).

Congress also had before it evidence that one of the major
causes of the INS' failure to remove deportable criminal
aliens was the agency's failure to detain those aliens during
their deportation proceedings. See Department of Justice,
Office of the Inspector General, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Deportation of Aliens After Final Orders Have
Been Issued, Rep. No. I-96-03 (Mar. 1996), App. 46 (hereinafter Inspection Report) ("Detention is key to effective deportation"); see also H. R. Rep. No. 104-469, p. 123 (1995).
The Attorney General at the time had broad discretion to
conduct individualized bond hearings and to release criminal
aliens from custody during their removal proceedings when
those aliens were determined not to present an excessive
flight risk or threat to society. See 8 U. S. C. $ 1252(a) (1982
ed.). Despite this discretion to conduct bond hearings, however, in practice the INS faced severe limitations on funding
and detention space, which considerations affected its release
determinations. S. Rep. 104-48, at 23 ("[R]elease determinations are made by the INS in large part, according to the
number of beds available in a particular region"); see also
Reply Brief for Petitioners 9.

Once released, more than 20% of deportable criminal
aliens failed to appear for their removal hearings. See

4 Although the Attorney General had authority to release these aliens
on bond, it is not clear that all of the aliens released were in fact given
individualized bond hearings. See Brief for Petitioners 19 ("[M]ore than
20% of criminal aliens who were released on bond or otherwise not kept
in custody throughout their deportation proceedings failed to appear for
those proceedings" (emphasis added)), citing S. Rep. 104-48, at 2. The
evidence does suggest, however, that many deportable criminal aliens in
this "released criminal aliens" sample received such determinations. See

dissent disputes that statistic, post, at 562-564 (opinion of
Souter, J.), but goes on to praise a subsequent study con-ducted by the Vera Institute of Justice that more than confirms it. Post, at 565-566. As the dissent explains, theVera study found that "77% of those [deportable criminal
aliens] released on bond" showed up for their removal pro-ceedings.

Post, at 565. This finding--that one out of fourcriminal aliens released on bond absconded prior to the completion of his removal proceedings--is even more strikingthan the one-in-five flight rate reflected in the evidence before Congress when it adopted $ 1226(c).5 The Vera Insti-tute study strongly supports Congress' concern that, even
with individualized screening, releasing deportable criminalaliens on bond would lead to an unacceptable rate of flight.

Congress amended the immigration laws several timestoward the end of the 1980's. In 1988, Congress limited

Brief for Petitioners 19 (noting that, for aliens not evaluated for flight risk
at a bond hearing, the prehearing skip rate doubled to 40%).

5 The dissent also claims that the study demonstrated that "92% of criminal aliens . . . who were released under supervisory conditions attended
all of their hearings." Post, at 565 (opinion of Souter, J.). The study
did manage to raise the appearance rate for criminal aliens through a
supervision program known as the Appearance Assistance Program
(AAP). But the AAP study is of limited value. First, the study included
only 16 aliens who, like respondent, were released from prison and charged
with being deportable on the basis of an aggravated felony. 1 Vera Institute of Justice, Testing Community Supervision for the INS: An Evaluation of the Appearance Assistance Program, pp. 33-34, 36 (Aug. 1, 2000).
In addition, all 127 aliens in the AAP study were admitted into the study
group only after being screened for "strength of family and community
ties, appearance rates in prior legal proceedings, and eligibility to apply
for a legal remedy." Id., at 13; see also id., at 37. Following this selection process, "supervision staff were in frequent, ongoing communication
with participants," id., at 14, through, among other things, required reporting sessions, periodic home visits, and assistance in retaining legal
representation, id., at 41-42. And, in any event, respondent seeks an individualized bond hearing, not "community supervision." The dissent's
claim that criminal aliens released under supervisory conditions are likely
to attend their hearings, post, at 565, therefore, is totally beside the point.

Opinion of the Court
the Attorney General's discretion over custody determina-tions with respect to deportable aliens who had been convicted of aggravated felonies. See Pub. L. 100-690, Tit. VII,$ 7343(a), 102 Stat. 4470. Then, in 1990, Congress broadened
the definition of "aggravated felony," subjecting more crimi-nal aliens to mandatory detention. See Pub. L. 101-649, Tit.
V, $ 501(a), 104 Stat. 5048. At the same time, however, Congress added a new provision, 8 U. S. C. $ 1252(a)(2)(B) (1988ed., Supp. II), authorizing the Attorney General to release

permanent resident aliens during their deportation proceed-ings where such aliens were found not to constitute a flight
risk or threat to the community. See Pub. L. 101-649, Tit.
V, $ 504(a)(5), 104 Stat. 5049.

During the same period in which Congress was making
incremental changes to the immigration laws, it was also considering wholesale reform of those laws. Some studies presented to Congress suggested that detention of criminal
aliens during their removal proceedings might be the best
way to ensure their successful removal from this country.
See, e. g., 1989 House Hearing 75; Inspection Report, App.
46; S. Rep. 104-48, at 32 ("Congress should consider requiring that all aggravated felons be detained pending deportation. Such a step may be necessary because of the high rate
of no-shows for those criminal aliens released on bond"). It
was following those Reports that Congress enacted 8 U. S. C.

$ 1226, requiring the Attorney General to detain a subset of
deportable criminal aliens pending a determination of their
removability.

"In the exercise of its broad power over naturalization
and immigration, Congress regularly makes rules that would
be unacceptable if applied to citizens." Mathews v. Diaz,
426 U. S. 67, 79-80 (1976). The dissent seeks to avoid this
fundamental premise of immigration law by repeatedly referring to it as "dictum." Post, at 547-549, n. 9 (opinion of
Souter, J.). The Court in Mathews, however, made the
statement the dissent now seeks to avoid in reliance on clear

precedent establishing that " `any policy toward aliens isvitally and intricately interwoven with contemporaneous

policies in regard to the conduct of foreign relations, the warpower, and the maintenance of a republican form of government.' " 426 U. S., at 81, n. 17 (quoting Harisiades v.Shaughnessy, 342 U. S. 580, 588-589 (1952)). And, since
Mathews, this Court has firmly and repeatedly endorsed theproposition that Congress may make rules as to aliens that
would be unacceptable if applied to citizens. See, e. g.,
Zadvydas, 533 U. S., at 718 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) ("Theliberty rights of the aliens before us here are subject to limitations and conditions not applicable to citizens"); Reno v.Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 305-306 (1993) ("Thus, `in the exercise
of its broad power over immigration and naturalization,"Congress regularly makes rules that would be unacceptable
if applied to citizens" ' " (quoting Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U. S. 787,792 (1977), in turn quoting Mathews, supra, at 79-80));
United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U. S. 259, 273 (1990).In his habeas corpus challenge, respondent did not contest
Congress' general authority to remove criminal aliens fromthe United States. Nor did he argue that he himself was
not "deportable" within the meaning of $ 1226(c).6 Rather,

6 Respondent's concession on this score is relevant for two reasons: First,
because of the concession, respondent by his own choice did not receive
one of the procedural protections otherwise provided to aliens detained
under $ 1226(c). And, second, because of the concession we do not reach
a contrary argument raised by respondent for the first time in his brief on
the merits in this Court. Specifically, in his brief on the merits, respondent suggests that he might not be subject to detention under $ 1226(c)
after all because his 1997 conviction for petty theft with priors might
not qualify as an aggravated felony under recent Ninth Circuit precedent.
Respondent now states that he intends to argue at his next removal hearing that "his 1997 conviction does not constitute an aggravated felony . . .
and his 1996 conviction [for first-degree burglary] does not constitute
either an aggravated felony or a crime involving moral turpitude." Brief
for Respondent 11-12. As respondent has conceded that he is deportable
for purposes of his habeas corpus challenge to $ 1226(c) at all previous
stages of this proceeding, see n. 3, supra, we decide the case on that basis.

Opinion of the Court
respondent argued that the Government may not, consistent
with the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, detain
him for the brief period necessary for his removal proceedings. The dissent, after an initial detour on the issue of respondent's concession, see post, at 541-543 (opinion of Souter, J.), ultimately acknowledges the real issue in this case.
Post, at 555-556, n. 11; see also Brief in Opposition 1-2 (explaining that respondent's "challenge is solely to Section
1226(c)'s absolute prohibition on his release from detention").

"It is well established that the Fifth Amendment entitles
aliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings."
Flores, supra, at 306. At the same time, however, this
Court has recognized detention during deportation proceedings as a constitutionally valid aspect of the deportation
process. As we said more than a century ago, deportation
proceedings "would be vain if those accused could not be held
in custody pending the inquiry into their true character."
Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U. S. 228, 235 (1896); see

dissent notes, respondent has applied for withholding of removal. Post,

aliens during the pendency of their deportation proceedings. See $20, 34

tivities. The detained aliens did not deny that they weremembers of the Communist Party or that they were therefore deportable. Id., at 530. Instead, like respondent inthe present case, they challenged their detention on the
grounds that there had been no finding that they were un-likely to appear for their deportation proceedings when ordered to do so. Id., at 531-532; see also Brief for Petitioner
in Carlson v. Landon, O. T. 1951, No. 35, p. 12 (arguingthat legislative determinations could not justify "depriving

[an alien] of his liberty without facts personal to the individ-ual"). Although the Attorney General ostensibly had discretion to release detained Communist aliens on bond, the
INS had adopted a policy of refusing to grant bail to those
aliens in light of what Justice Frankfurter viewed as the
mistaken "conception that Congress had made [alien Communists] in effect unbailable." 342 U. S., at 559, 568 (dissenting opinion).

The Court rejected the aliens' claims that they were entitled to be released from detention if they did not pose a flight
risk, explaining "[d]etention is necessarily a part of this deportation procedure." Id., at 538; see also id., at 535. The
Court noted that Congress had chosen to make such aliens
deportable based on its "understanding of [Communists'] attitude toward the use of force and violence . . . to accomplish
their political aims." Id., at 541. And it concluded that the
INS could deny bail to the detainees "by reference to the
legislative scheme" even without any finding of flight risk.
Id., at 543; see also id., at 550 (Black, J., dissenting) ("Denial
[of bail] was not on the ground that if released [the aliens]
might try to evade obedience to possible deportation orders"); id., at 551, and n. 6.

The dissent argues that, even though the aliens in Carlson
were not flight risks, "individualized findings of dangerousness were made" as to each of the aliens. Post, at 573 (opinion of Souter, J.). The dissent, again, is mistaken. The
aliens in Carlson had not been found individually dangerous.

Opinion of the Court
The only evidence against them was their membership inthe Communist Party and "a degree . . . of participation in

Communist activities." 342 U. S., at 541. There was no"individualized findin[g]" of likely future dangerousness as
to any of the aliens and, in at least one case, there was aspecific finding of nondangerousness.

8 The Court nonetheless concluded that the denial of bail was permissible "byreference to the legislative scheme to eradicate the evils of

Communist activity." Id., at 543.9

8 See Carlson v. Landon, 342 U. S., at 549 (Black, J., dissenting) (noting
that, in at least one case, the alien involved had been found " `not likely to
engage in any subversive activities' " (emphasis added)); see also id., at
550, n. 5 (quoting the District Judge's finding in case No. 35 that " `I don't
know whether it is true . . . that their release is dangerous to the security
of the United States' "); id., at 552 ("[T]he bureau agent is not required to
prove that a person he throws in jail is . . . `dangerous' " (emphasis added));
see also id., at 567 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting) ("[T]he Attorney General
. . . did not deny bail from an individualized estimate of `the danger to the
public safety of [each person's] presence within the community' " (emphasis added)).

9 Apart from its error with respect to the dangerousness determination,

the dissent attempts to distinguish Carlson from the present case by arguing that the aliens in Carlson had engaged in " `personal activity' " in
support of a political party Congress considered " `a menace to the public.' " Post, at 569 (opinion of Souter, J.). In suggesting that this is a
distinction, the dissent ignores the "personal activity" that aliens like respondent have undertaken in committing the crimes that subject them to
detention in the first instance--personal activity that has been determined
with far greater procedural protections than any finding of "active membership" in the Communist Party involved in Carlson. See 342 U. S., at
530 ("[T]he Director made allegation[s], supported by affidavits, that the
Service's dossier of each petitioner contained evidence indicating to him
that each was at the time of arrest a member of the Communist Party
of the United States and had since 1930 participated . . . in the Party's
indoctrination of others"). In the present case, respondent became "deportable" under $ 1226(c) only following criminal convictions that were secured following full procedural protections. These convictions, moreover,
reflect "personal activity" that Congress considered relevant to future
dangerousness. Cf. Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678, 714 (2001) (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (noting that "a criminal record accumulated by an

Opinion of the Court
In Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292 (1993), the Court consid-ered another due process challenge to detention during deportation proceedings. The due process challenge therewas brought by a class of alien juveniles. The INS had arrested them and was holding them in custody pending theirdeportation hearings. The aliens challenged the INS' policy
of releasing detained alien juveniles only into the care oftheir parents, legal guardians, or certain other adult relatives. See, e. g., id., at 297 (citing Detention and Release ofJuveniles, 53 Fed. Reg. 17449 (1988) (codified as to deportation at 8 CFR $ 242.24 (1992))). The aliens argued that thepolicy improperly relied "upon a `blanket' presumption of the
unsuitability of custodians other than parents, close rela-tives, and guardians" to care for the detained juvenile aliens.
507 U. S., at 313. In rejecting this argument, the Court em-phasized that "reasonable presumptions and generic rules,"
even when made by the INS rather than Congress, are notnecessarily impermissible exercises of Congress' traditional
power to legislate with respect to aliens. Ibid.; see alsoid., at 313-314 ("In the case of each detained alien juvenile,
the INS makes those determinations that are specific to theindividual and necessary to accurate application of the regulation . . . . The particularization and individuation need gono further than this"). Thus, as with the prior challenges
to detention during deportation proceedings, the Court inFlores rejected the due process challenge and upheld the
constitutionality of the detention.Despite this Court's longstanding view that the Government may constitutionally detain deportable aliens duringthe limited period necessary for their removal proceedings,
respondent argues that the narrow detention policy reflectedin 8 U. S. C. $ 1226(c) violates due process. Respondent, like

admitted alien" is a good indicator of future danger, and that "[a]ny suggestion that aliens who have completed prison terms no longer present a
danger simply does not accord with the reality that a significant risk may
still exist").

Opinion of the Court
the four Courts of Appeals that have held $ 1226(c) to beunconstitutional, relies heavily upon our recent opinion in

Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678 (2001).In Zadvydas, the Court considered a due process challenge
to detention of aliens under 8 U. S. C. $ 1231 (1994 ed., Supp.V), which governs detention following a final order of removal. Section 1231(a)(6) provides, among other things,that when an alien who has been ordered removed is not in
fact removed during the 90-day statutory "removal period,"that alien "may be detained beyond the removal period"
in the discretion of the Attorney General. The Court in
Zadvydas read $ 1231 to authorize continued detention of analien following the 90-day removal period for only such time

as is reasonably necessary to secure the alien's removal.533 U. S., at 699.

But Zadvydas is materially different from the present casein two respects.
First, in Zadvydas, the aliens challenging their detentionfollowing final orders of deportation were ones for whom removal was "no longer practically attainable." Id., at 690.The Court thus held that the detention there did not serve
its purported immigration purpose. Ibid. In so holding,the Court rejected the Government's claim that, by detaining the aliens involved, it could prevent them from fleeingprior to their removal. The Court observed that where, as
there, "detention's goal is no longer practically attainable,detention no longer bears a reasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual was committed." Ibid. (inter-nal quotation marks and citation omitted).

In the present case, the statutory provision at issue gov-erns detention of deportable criminal aliens pending their

10 The dissent denies this point, insisting that the detention at issue in
Zadvydas actually did bear a reasonable relation to its immigration purpose. Post, at 561 (opinion of Souter, J.) ("[T]he statute in Zadvydas
. . . served the purpose of preventing aliens . . . from fleeing prior to
actual deportation").

528 DEMORE v. KIM

Opinion of the Court
removal proceedings. Such detention necessarily servesthe purpose of preventing deportable criminal aliens from

fleeing prior to or during their removal proceedings, thusincreasing the chance that, if ordered removed, the aliens
will be successfully removed. Respondent disagrees, ar-guing that there is no evidence that mandatory detention
is necessary because the Government has never shown that
individualized bond hearings would be ineffective. SeeBrief for Respondent 14. But as discussed above, see

supra,
at 519-520, in adopting $ 1226(c), Congress had before it evi-dence suggesting that permitting discretionary release of

aliens pending their removal hearings would lead to large
numbers of deportable criminal aliens skipping their hearings and remaining at large in the United States unlawfully.

Respondent argues that these statistics are irrelevant and
do not demonstrate that individualized bond hearings "are
ineffective or burdensome." Brief for Respondent 33-40.
It is of course true that when Congress enacted $ 1226, individualized bail determinations had not been tested under optimal conditions, or tested in all their possible permutations.
But when the Government deals with deportable aliens, the
Due Process Clause does not require it to employ the least
burdensome means to accomplish its goal. The evidence
Congress had before it certainly supports the approach it
selected even if other, hypothetical studies might have suggested different courses of action. Cf., e. g., Los Angeles v.
Alameda Books, Inc., 535 U. S. 425, 436-437 (2002); Flores,
supra, at 315 ("It may well be that other policies would be
even better, but `we are [not] a legislature charged with
formulating public policy' " (quoting Schall v. Martin, 467
U. S. 253, 281 (1984))).

Zadvydas is materially different from the present case in
a second respect as well. While the period of detention at
issue in Zadvydas was "indefinite" and "potentially permanent," 533 U. S., at 690-691, the detention here is of a much
shorter duration.

529Cite as: 538 U. S. 510 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
Zadvydas distinguished the statutory provision it was
there considering from $ 1226 on these very grounds, noting
that "post-removal-period detention, unlike detention pending a determination of removability . . . , has no obvious
termination point." Id., at 697 (emphasis added). Under

$1226(c), not only does detention have a definite termination
point, in the majority of cases it lasts for less than the 90
days we considered presumptively valid in Zadvydas.11 The
Executive Office for Immigration Review has calculated that,
in 85% of the cases in which aliens are detained pursuant to

$ 1226(c), removal proceedings are completed in an average
time of 47 days and a median of 30 days. Brief for Petitioners 39-40. In the remaining 15% of cases, in which the alien
appeals the decision of the immigration judge to the Board
of Immigration Appeals, appeal takes an average of four
months, with a median time that is slightly shorter. Id., at
40.12

These statistics do not include the many cases in which
removal proceedings are completed while the alien is still
serving time for the underlying conviction. Id., at 40,

11 The dissent concedes that "[t]he scheme considered in Zadvydas did
not provide review immediately . . . . [C]ustody review hearings usually
occurred within three months of a transfer to a postorder detention unit."
Post, at 555, n. 11 (opinion of Souter, J.). Yet, in discussing the present
case, the dissent insists that "the due process requirement of an individualized finding of necessity applies to detention periods shorter than" respondent's. Post, at 568, n. 24 (citing Schall v. Martin, 467 U. S. 253, 270,
276-277 (1984), in which "the detainee was entitled to a hearing" when
threatened with "a maximum detention period of 17 days"). The dissent
makes no attempt to reconcile its suggestion that aliens are entitled to an
immediate hearing with the holding in Zadvydas permitting aliens to be
detained for several months prior to such a hearing.

12 The very limited time of the detention at stake under $ 1226(c) is not

missed by the dissent. See post, at 568 (opinion of Souter, J.) ("Successful challenges often require several months"); ibid. (considering "[t]he potential for several months [worth] of confinement"); but see post, at 549
("potentially lengthy detention").

Opinion of the Court
n. 17.13 In those cases, the aliens involved are never sub-jected to mandatory detention at all. In sum, the detention

at stake under $ 1226(c) lasts roughly a month and a half inthe vast majority of cases in which it is invoked, and about
five months in the minority of cases in which the alienchooses to appeal.

14 Respondent was detained for some13 Congress has directed the INS to identify and track deportable criminal aliens while they are still in the criminal justice system, and to complete removal proceedings against them as promptly as possible. See
Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-132,

$$ 432, 438(a), 110 Stat. 1273-1276; Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-208, $$ 326, 329, 110 Stat.
3009-630 to 3009-631 (codified at 8 U. S. C. $ 1228). The INS therefore
established the Institutional Hearing Program (IHP) (subsequently subsumed under the "Institutional Removal Program"). By 1997, the General Accounting Office found that nearly half of all deportable criminal
aliens' cases were completed through the IHP prior to the aliens' release
from prison. See General Accounting Office, Report to the Chairman,
Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims of the House Committee on the
Judiciary, INS' Efforts to Remove Imprisoned Aliens Continue to Need
Improvement 10, Fig. 1 (Oct. 1998). The report urged, however, that the
INS needed to improve its operations in order to complete removal proceedings against all deportable criminal aliens before their release. Id.,
at 13. Should this come to pass, of course, $ 1226(c) and the temporary
detention it mandates would be rendered obsolete.

14 Prior to the enactment of $ 1226(c), when the vast majority of deportable criminal aliens were not detained during their deportation proceedings, many filed frivolous appeals in order to delay their deportation. See
S. Rep. 104-48, at 2 ("Delays can earn criminal aliens more than work
permits and wages--if they delay long enough they may even obtain U. S.
citizenship"). Cf. Zadvydas, 533 U. S., at 713 (Kennedy, J., dissenting)
("[C]ourt ordered release cannot help but encourage dilatory and obstructive tactics by aliens"). Respondent contends that the length of detention
required to appeal may deter aliens from exercising their right to do so.
Brief for Respondent 32. As we have explained before, however, "the
legal system . . . is replete with situations requiring the making of difficult
judgments as to which course to follow," and, even in the criminal context,
there is no constitutional prohibition against requiring parties to make
such choices. McGautha v. California, 402 U. S. 183, 213 (1971) (internal
quotation marks omitted); accord, Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, 412 U. S. 17,

relief, but respondent himself had requested a continuanceof his removal hearing.

For the reasons set forth above, respondent's claim mustfail. Detention during removal proceedings is a constitutionally permissible part of that process. See, e. g., Wong
Wing, 163 U. S., at 235 ("We think it clear that detention, ortemporary confinement, as part of the means necessary to

give effect to the provisions for the exclusion or expulsion ofaliens would be valid"); Carlson v. Landon, 342 U. S. 524
(1952); Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292 (1993). The INS deten-tion of respondent, a criminal alien who has conceded that
he is deportable, for the limited period of his removal pro-ceedings, is governed by these cases. The judgment of the
Court of Appeals is Reversed.

Justice Kennedy, concurring.
While the justification for 8 U. S. C. $ 1226(c) is based uponthe Government's concerns over the risks of flight and danger to the community, ante, at 518-521, the ultimate purposebehind the detention is premised upon the alien's deportability. As a consequence, due process requires individualizedprocedures to ensure there is at least some merit to the Immigration and Naturalization Service's (INS) charge and,therefore, sufficient justification to detain a lawful permanent resident alien pending a more formal hearing. See
Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678, 690 (2001) ("[W]here deten-tion's goal is no longer practically attainable, detention no

longer bears a reasonable relation to the purpose for which

habeas petition. His removal hearing was scheduled to occur two months
later, but respondent requested and received a continuance to obtain documents relevant to his withholding application. See Brief for Respondent

id., at 718 (Kennedy, J., dissenting)
("Liberty under the Due Process Clause includes protectionagainst unlawful or arbitrary personal restraint or detention"). If the Government cannot satisfy this minimal,threshold burden, then the permissibility of continued detention pending deportation proceedings turns solely upon the
alien's ability to satisfy the ordinary bond procedures--namely, whether if released the alien would pose a risk of

flight or a danger to the community. Id., at 721 (Kennedy,J., dissenting).

As the Court notes, these procedures were apparently
available to respondent in this case. Respondent was entitled to a hearing in which he could have "raise[d] any nonfrivolous argument available to demonstrate that he was
not properly included in a mandatory detention category."
Ante, at 514, and n. 3 (citing 8 CFR $ 3.19(h)(2)(ii) (2002);
Matter of Joseph, 22 I. & N. Dec. 799 (BIA 1999)). Had he
prevailed in such a proceeding, the Immigration Judge then
would have had to determine if respondent "could be considered . . . for release under the general bond provisions" of

$ 1226(a). Id., at 809. Respondent, however, did not seek
relief under these procedures, and the Court had no occasion
here to determine their adequacy. Ante, at 514, n. 3.

For similar reasons, since the Due Process Clause prohibits arbitrary deprivations of liberty, a lawful permanent
resident alien such as respondent could be entitled to an individualized determination as to his risk of flight and dangerousness if the continued detention became unreasonable or
unjustified. Zadvydas, 533 U. S., at 684-686; id., at 721
(Kennedy, J., dissenting) ("[A]liens are entitled to be free
from detention that is arbitrary or capricious"). Were there
to be an unreasonable delay by the INS in pursuing and completing deportation proceedings, it could become necessary
then to inquire whether the detention is not to facilitate deportation, or to protect against risk of flight or dangerous538US2 Unit: $U47 [02-09-05 15:24:15] PAGES PGT: OPLG

ness, but to incarcerate for other reasons. That is not aproper inference, however, either from the statutory scheme

itself or from the circumstances of this case. The Court'scareful opinion is consistent with these premises, and I join
it in full.

Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas join, concurring in part and concurring in thejudgment.

I join all but Part I of the Court's opinion because, a major-ity having determined there is jurisdiction, I agree with the
Court's resolution of respondent's challenge on the merits.I cannot join Part I because I believe that 8 U. S. C. $ 1226(e)
unequivocally deprives federal courts of jurisdiction to setaside "any action or decision" by the Attorney General in
detaining criminal aliens under $ 1226(c) while removal pro-ceedings are ongoing. That is precisely the nature of the
action before us. I

I begin with the text of the statute:

"The Attorney General's discretionary judgment re-garding the application of this section shall not be subject to review. No court may set aside any action or
decision by the Attorney General under this sectionregarding the detention or release of any alien or the

grant, revocation, or denial of bond or parole." $ 1226(e)(emphasis added).

There is no dispute that after respondent's release fromprison in 1999, the Attorney General detained him "under
this section," i. e., under $ 1226. And, the action of whichrespondent complains is one "regarding the detention or release of a[n] alien or the grant, revocation, or denial of bondor parole." $ 1226(e). In my view, the only plausible reading of $ 1226(e) is that Congress intended to prohibit federalcourts from "set[ting] aside" the Attorney General's decision

538US2 Unit: $U47 [02-09-05 15:24:15] PAGES PGT: OPLG
534 DEMORE v. KIM

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
to deem a criminal alien such as respondent ineligible forrelease during the limited duration of his or her removal

proceedings.I recognize both the "strong presumption in favor of judicial review of administrative action" and our "longstandingrule requiring a clear statement of congressional intent to
repeal habeas jurisdiction." INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289,298 (2001). I also acknowledge that Congress will not be
deemed to have repealed habeas jurisdiction in the absenceof a specific and unambiguous statutory directive to that effect. See id., at 312-313; Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wall. 85, 105(1869). Here, however, the signal sent by Congress in
enacting $ 1226(e) could not be clearer: "No court may setaside

any action or decision . . . regarding the detention orrelease of any alien." (Emphasis added.) There is simply

no reasonable way to read this language other than as pre-cluding all review, including habeas review, of the Attorney
General's actions or decisions to detain criminal aliens pursu-ant to $ 1226(c).

In St. Cyr, the Court held that certain provisions of theAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996
(AEDPA) and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immi-grant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) do not strip federal courts of their jurisdiction to review an alien's habeasclaim that he or she is eligible for a waiver of deportation.
533 U. S., at 312. I dissented in that case, and continue tobelieve it was wrongly decided. Nothing in

St. Cyr, how-ever, requires that we ignore the plain language and clear

meaning of $ 1226(e).In St. Cyr, the Court stressed the significance of Congress'
use of the term "judicial review" in each of the jurisdictional-limiting provisions at issue. In concluding that Congress
had not intended to limit habeas jurisdiction by limiting "ju-dicial review," the Court reasoned as follows:

"The term `judicial review' or `jurisdiction to review' isthe focus of each of these three provisions. In the im538US2 Unit: $U47 [02-09-05 15:24:15] PAGES PGT: OPLG

535Cite as: 538 U. S. 510 (2003)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
migration context, `judicial review' and `habeas corpus'have historically distinct meanings. See Heikkila v.

Barber, 345 U. S. 229 (1953). In Heikkila, the Courtconcluded that the finality provisions at issue `preclud[ed] judicial review' to the maximum extent possibleunder the Constitution, and thus concluded that the [Administrative Procedure Act] was inapplicable. Id., at235. Nevertheless, the Court reaffirmed the right to
habeas corpus. Ibid. Noting that the limited roleplayed by the courts in habeas corpus proceedings was
far narrower than the judicial review authorized by theAPA, the Court concluded that `it is the scope of inquiry
on habeas corpus that differentiates' habeas review from`judicial review.' "

Id., at 311-312.

In this case, however, $ 1226(e) does not mention any limita-tions on "judicial review." To be sure, the first sentence of

$ 1226(e) precludes "review" of the Attorney General's "dis-cretionary judgment[s]" to detain aliens under $ 1226(c).
But the second sentence is not so limited, and states unequiv-ocally that "[n]o court may set aside any action or decision"
to detain an alien under $ 1226(c). It cannot seriously bemaintained that the second sentence employs a term of art
such that "no court" does not really mean "no court," or thata decision of the Attorney General may not be "set aside" in
actions filed under the Immigration and Naturalization Actbut may be set aside on habeas review.

Congress' use of the term "Judicial review" as the title of$ 1226(e) does not compel a different conclusion. As the
Court stated in St. Cyr, "a title alone is not controlling," id.,at 308, because the title of a statute has no power to give
what the text of the statute takes away. Where as here thestatutory text is clear, " `the title of a statute . . . cannot limit
the plain meaning of the text.' " Pennsylvania Dept. ofCorrections v. Yeskey, 524 U. S. 206, 212 (1998) (quoting
Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 331 U. S. 519, 528-529 (1947)).

536 DEMORE v. KIM

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
The Court also focused in St. Cyr on the absence of anylanguage in the relevant statutory provisions making explicit

reference to habeas review under 28 U. S. C. $ 2241. See 533U. S., at 313, n. 36. This statutory silence spoke volumes,
the Court reasoned, in light of the "historic use of $ 2241jurisdiction as a means of reviewing deportation and exclusion orders," ibid. In contrast, there is no analogous history
of routine reliance on habeas jurisdiction to challenge thedetention of aliens without bail pending the conclusion of removal proceedings. We have entertained such challengesonly twice, and neither was successful on the merits. See
Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292 (1993); Carlson v. Landon, 342
U. S. 524 (1952). See also Neuman, Habeas Corpus, Executive Detention, and the Removal of Aliens, 98 Colum. L. Rev.
961, 1067, n. 120 (1998) (distinguishing detention pursuant to
a final order of removal from the interlocutory detention at
issue here). Congress' failure to mention $ 2241 in this context therefore lacks the significance that the Court accorded
Congress' silence on the issue in St. Cyr. In sum, nothing
in St. Cyr requires us to interpret 8 U. S. C. $ 1226(e) to mean
anything other than what its plain language says.

I recognize that the two Courts of Appeals that have
considered the issue have held that $ 1226(e) does not preclude habeas claims such as respondent's. See Patel v. Zemski, 275 F. 3d 299 (CA3 2001); Parra v. Perryman, 172 F. 3d
954 (CA7 1999). In Parra, the Seventh Circuit held that

$ 1226(e) does not bar "challenges to $ 1226(c) itself, as opposed to decisions implementing that subsection." Id., at
957. Though the Court's opinion today relies heavily on this
distinction, I see no basis for importing it into the plain language of the statute.

The Seventh Circuit sought support from our decision in
Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525
U. S. 471 (1999) (AADC), but our holding there supports my
reading of $ 1226(e). In AADC, the Court construed a statute that sharply limits review of claims "arising from the

538US2 Unit: $U47 [02-09-05 15:24:15] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
decision or action by the Attorney General to commence pro-ceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against

any alien under this [Act]." 8 U. S. C. $ 1252(g) (1994 ed.,Supp. III). The Court concluded that this provision imposes
jurisdictional limits only on claims addressing one of thethree " `decision[s] or action[s]' " specifically enumerated in
the statute. AADC, supra, at 482. Nowhere in AADC didthe Court suggest, however, that the statute's jurisdictional
limits might not apply depending on the particular groundsraised by an alien for challenging the Attorney General's decisions or actions in these three areas. AADC thereforeprovides no support for imposing artificial limitations on the
broad scope of 8 U. S. C. $ 1226(e).

II
Because $ 1226(e) plainly deprives courts of federal habeasjurisdiction over claims that mandatory detention under

$ 1226(c) is unconstitutional, one could conceivably argue thatsuch a repeal violates the Suspension Clause, which provides
as follows: "The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shallnot be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it." U. S. Const., Art. I,$ 9, cl. 2. The clarity of $ 1226(e)'s text makes such a question unavoidable, unlike in St. Cyr, where the Court invokedthe doctrine of constitutional doubt and interpreted the relevant provisions of AEDPA and IIRIRA not to repeal habeasjurisdiction.

St. Cyr, supra, at 314; see also Seminole Tribeof Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 57, n. 9 (1996) (where the

text of a statute is clear, the "preference for avoiding a con-stitutional question" cannot be invoked to defeat the plainly
expressed intent of Congress).In my view, any argument that $ 1226(e) violates the Suspension Clause is likely unavailing. St. Cyr held that "atthe absolute minimum, the Suspension Clause protects the
writ `as it existed in 1789.' " 533 U. S., at 301 (quoting
Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 663-664 (1996)). The consti538US2 Unit: $U47 [02-09-05 15:24:15] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
tutionality of $ 1226(e)'s limitation on habeas review there-fore turns on whether the writ was generally available to

those in respondent's position in 1789 (or, possibly, there-after) to challenge detention during removal proceedings.

Admittedly, discerning the relevant habeas corpus law forpurposes of Suspension Clause analysis is a complex task.
Nonetheless, historical evidence suggests that respondent
would not have been permitted to challenge his temporarydetention pending removal until very recently. Because colonial America imposed few restrictions on immigration,there is little case law prior to that time about the availability of habeas review to challenge temporary detention pend-ing exclusion or deportation. See

St. Cyr, supra, at 305.
The English experience, however, suggests that such reviewwas not available:

"In England, the only question that has ever been madein regard to the power to expel aliens has been whether
it could be exercised by the King without the consent ofParliament. It was formerly exercised by the King, but
in later times by Parliament, which passed several actson the subject between 1793 and 1848. Eminent English judges, sitting in the Judicial Committee of thePrivy Council, have gone very far in supporting the exclusion or expulsion, by the executive authority of a colony, of aliens having no absolute right to enter its terri-tory or to remain therein."

Fong Yue Ting v. United
States, 149 U. S. 698, 709 (1893) (citations omitted).

In this country, Congress did not pass the first law regulat-ing immigration until 1875. See 18 Stat. (pt. 3) 477. In the

late 19th century, as statutory controls on immigration tightened, the number of challenges brought by aliens to Government deportation or exclusion decisions also increased. See
St. Cyr, supra, at 305-306. Because federal immigration
laws from 1891 until 1952 made no express provision for judicial review, what limited review existed took the form of pe538US2 Unit: $U47 [02-09-05 15:24:15] PAGES PGT: OPLG

539Cite as: 538 U. S. 510 (2003)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
titions for writs of habeas corpus. See, e. g., Ekiu v. United
States, 142 U. S. 651 (1892); Fong Yue Ting v. United States,
supra; The Japanese Immigrant Case, 189 U. S. 86 (1903);
Chin Yow v. United States, 208 U. S. 8 (1908); Kwock Jan Fat
v. White, 253 U. S. 454 (1920); Ng Fung Ho v. White, 259 U. S.
276 (1922). Though the Court was willing to entertain these
habeas challenges to Government exclusion and deportation
decisions, in no case did the Court question the right of immigration officials to temporarily detain aliens while exclusion
or deportation proceedings were ongoing.

By the mid-20th century, the number of aliens in deportation proceedings being released on parole rose considerably.
See, e. g., Carlson v. Landon, 342 U. S., at 538, n. 31. Nonetheless, until 1952 habeas corpus petitions remained the only
means by which deportation orders could be challenged.
Heikkila v. Barber, 345 U. S. 229, 236-237 (1953). Under
this regime, an alien who had been paroled but wished to
challenge a final deportation order had to place himself in
Government custody before filing a habeas petition challenging the order. Bridges v. Wixon, 326 U. S. 135, 140 (1945).
Given this, it is not surprising that the Court was not faced
with numerous habeas claims brought by aliens seeking release from detention pending deportation.

So far as I am aware, not until 1952 did we entertain such
a challenge. See Carlson v. Landon, supra. And there, we
reaffirmed the power of Congress to order the temporary
detention of aliens during removal proceedings. Id., at 538.
In Reno v. Flores, we likewise rejected a similar challenge
to such detention. And, Flores was a wide-ranging class
action in which 28 U. S. C. $ 2241 was but one of several statutes invoked as the basis for federal jurisdiction. 507 U. S.,
at 296. All in all, it appears that in 1789, and thereafter
until very recently, the writ was not generally available to
aliens to challenge their detention while removal proceedings were ongoing.

Opinion of Souter, J.
Because a majority of the Court has determined that juris-diction exists over respondent's claims, I need not conclusively decide the thorny question whether 8 U. S. C. $ 1226(e)violates the Suspension Clause. For present purposes, it is
enough to say that in my view, $ 1226(e) unambiguously barshabeas challenges to the Attorney General's decisions regarding the temporary detention of criminal aliens under

$ 1226(c) pending removal. That said, because a majority ofthe Court has determined that there is jurisdiction, and because I agree with the majority's resolution of the meritsof respondent's challenge, I join in all but Part I of the
Court's opinion.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg join, concurring in part and dissenting in
part.

Respondent Kim is an alien lawfully admitted to permanent residence in the United States. He claims that theConstitution forbids the Immigration and Naturalization

Service (INS) from detaining him under 8 U. S. C. $ 1226(c)
unless his detention serves a government interest, such as
preventing flight or danger to the community. He contends
that due process affords him a right to a hearing before an
impartial official,1 giving him a chance to show that he poses
no risk that would justify confining him between the moment
the Government claims he is removable and the adjudication
of the Government's claim.

I join Part I of the Court's opinion, which upholds federal
jurisdiction in this case, but I dissent from the Court's dispo1 Kim does not claim a hearing before any specific official. The generality of his claim may reflect the fact, noted just below, that the INS released
him on bond without any hearing whatsoever after the District Court
entered its judgment in this case. App. 11-13. Accordingly, there is no
occasion to enquire whether due process requires access to any particular
arbiter, such as one unaffiliated with the INS. I therefore use the neutral
term "impartial" in describing the hearing Kim claims.

sition on the merits. The Court's holding that the Constitu-tion permits the Government to lock up a lawful permanent

resident of this country when there is concededly no reasonto do so forgets over a century of precedent acknowledging
the rights of permanent residents, including the basic libertyfrom physical confinement lying at the heart of due process.
The INS has never argued that detaining Kim is necessaryto guarantee his appearance for removal

2 proceedings or to

protect anyone from danger in the meantime. Instead,shortly after the District Court issued its order in this case,

the INS, sua sponte and without even holding a custodyhearing, concluded that Kim "would not be considered a
threat" and that any risk of flight could be met by a bond of$5,000. App. 11-13. He was released soon thereafter, and
there is no indication that he is not complying with the termsof his release.

The Court's approval of lengthy mandatory detention cantherefore claim no justification in national emergency or any
risk posed by Kim particularly. The Court's judgment isunjustified by past cases or current facts, and I respectfully
dissent. I

At the outset, there is the Court's mistaken suggestionthat Kim "conceded" his removability,

ante, at 514, 523, andn. 6, 531. The Court cites no statement before any court

conceding removability, and I can find none. At the first op-portunity, Kim applied to the Immigration Court for withholding of removal, Brief for Respondent 9, n. 12, and he

3009-587, adding 8 U. S. C. $ 1229a. Because this case requires consideration of cases decided both before and after 1996, this opinion refers to
"removal" generally but, where the context requires, distinguishes between "deportation" of aliens who have entered the United States and
"exclusion" of aliens who seek entry.

represents that he intends to assert that his criminal convic-tions are not for removable offenses and that he is independently eligible for statutory relief from removal, id., at 11-12;see also ante, at 522-523, n. 6. In his brief before the Ninth
Circuit, Kim stated that his removability was "an open ques-tion," that he was "still fighting [his] removal administratively," and that the Immigration Court had yet tohold a merits hearing. Brief of Petitioner-Appellee in
No. 99-17373 (CA9), pp. 4, 13-14, 24, 33-34, and n. 28, 48-49.At oral argument here, his counsel stated that Kim was challenging his removability. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 36-38, 44.The suggestion that Kim should have contested his removability in this habeas corpus petition, ante, at 522-523, andn. 6, misses the point that all he claims, or could now claim,
is that his detention pending removal proceedings violatesthe Constitution. Challenges to removability itself, and applications for relief from removal, are usually submitted inthe first instance to an immigration judge. See 8 U. S. C.

$ 1229a(a)(3). The Immigration Judge had not yet held aninitial hearing on the substantive issue of removability when
Kim filed his habeas petition in the District Court, eventhough Kim had been detained for over three months under

$ 1226(c). If Kim's habeas corpus petition had claimed "thathe himself was not `deportable,' " as the Court suggests it
should have, ante, at 522, the District Court would probablyhave dismissed the claim as unexhausted.

E. g., Espinal v.
Filion, No. 00-CIV-2647-HB- JCF, 2001 WL 395196 (SDNY,Apr. 17, 2001). Kim did not, therefore, "conced[e] that he is

deportable," ante, at 531, by challenging removability beforethe Immigration Judge and challenging detention in a federal court.3

3 The Court's effort to explain its reference to a nonexistent concession,
ante, at 522-523, n. 6, seeks to gain an advantage from the fact that the
Immigration and Nationality Act uses the word "deportable" in various
ways, one being to describe classes of aliens who may be removed if the
necessary facts are proven, e. g., $ 1227(a), and another to describe aliens
who have actually been adjudged as being in the United States unlawfully,

It has been settled for over a century that all aliens withinour territory are "persons" entitled to the protection of the

Due Process Clause. Aliens "residing in the United Statesfor a shorter or longer time, are entitled, so long as they are
permitted by the government of the United States to remainin the country, to the safeguards of the Constitution, and to
the protection of the laws, in regard to their rights of personand of property, and to their civil and criminal responsibility." Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U. S. 698, 724(1893). The Japanese Immigrant Case, 189 U. S. 86, 100-
101 (1903), settled any lingering doubt that the Fifth Amend-ment's Due Process Clause gives aliens a right to challenge
mistreatment of their person or property.The constitutional protection of an alien's person and property is particularly strong in the case of aliens lawfully
e. g., $ 1229b. An alien is not adjudged "deportable" until an order enters
"concluding that the alien is deportable or ordering deportation," and such
an order is not final until affirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals
or until the time expires for seeking review. $$ 1101(a)(47)(A)-(B). To
suggest, as the Court seems to do, that an alien has conceded removability
simply because he does not dispute that he has been charged with facts
that will render him removable if those facts are later proven is like saying
that a civil defendant has conceded liability by failing to move to dismiss
the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) or that a
criminal defendant has conceded guilt by failing to dispute the validity of
the indictment. But even if the Court's reasoning were sound, it would
not cover Kim's situation, for he has stated (and the Court acknowledges)
his intent to contest the sufficiency of his criminal convictions as a basis
for removal. Ante, at 522-523, n. 6. This discussion, which the Court
calls a "detour," ante, at 523, is necessary only because of the Court's
insistence in stating that Kim conceded that he is "deportable." Ante, at

admitted to permanent residence (LPRs). The immigrationlaws give LPRs the opportunity to establish a life permanently in this country by developing economic, familial, andsocial ties indistinguishable from those of a citizen. In fact,
the law of the United States goes out of its way to encour-age just such attachments by creating immigration preferences for those with a citizen as a close relation, 8 U. S. C.$$ 1153(a)(1), (3)-(4), and those with valuable professional
skills or other assets promising benefits to the UnitedStates, $$ 1153(b)(1)-(5).

Once they are admitted to permanent residence, LPRsshare in the economic freedom enjoyed by citizens: they may
compete for most jobs in the private and public sectors with-out obtaining job-specific authorization, and apart from the

moved to the United States at the age of six and was lawfully
admitted to permanent residence when he was eight. His
mother is a citizen, and his father and brother are LPRs.
LPRs in Kim's situation have little or no reason to feel or to
establish firm ties with any place besides the United States.5

Our decisions have reflected these realities. As early as
1892, we addressed an issue of statutory construction with
the realization that "foreigners who have become domiciled
in a country other than their own, acquire rights and must
discharge duties in many respects the same as possessed by
and imposed upon the citizens of that country, and no restriction on the footing upon which such persons stand by reason

citizens were "bound, by such residence, to the society of which they are
members, subject to the laws of the state, and owing a qualified allegiance
thereto; they are obliged to defend it, (with an exception in favor of such

Kwong Hai Chew v. Colding, 344 U. S. 590
(1953), we read the word "excludable" in a regulation as hav-ing no application to LPRs, since such a reading would have

been questionable given "a resident alien's constitutionalright to due process."

Id., at 598-599.7 Kwong Hai Chew
adopted the statement of Justice Murphy, concurring in
Bridges, that " `once an alien lawfully enters and resides in
this country he becomes invested with the rights guaranteed
by the Constitution to all people within our borders. Such
rights include those protected by the First and the Fifth
Amendments and by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. None of these provisions acknowledges
any distinction between citizens and resident aliens. They
extend their inalienable privileges to all "persons" and guard
against any encroachment on those rights by federal or state
authority.' " 344 U. S., at 596-597, n. 5 (quoting Bridges,

tionally hospitable, has been accorded a generous and ascending scale of rights as he increases his identity with our
society. . . . [A]t least since 1886, we have extended to the
person and property of resident aliens important constitutional guaranties--such as the due process of law of the
Fourteenth Amendment").

The law therefore considers an LPR to be at home in the
United States, and even when the Government seeks removal, we have accorded LPRs greater protections than
other aliens under the Due Process Clause. In Landon v.
Plasencia, 459 U. S. 21 (1982), we held that a long-term resident who left the country for a brief period and was placed
in exclusion proceedings upon return was entitled to claim
greater procedural protections under that Clause than aliens
seeking initial entry. The LPR's interest in remaining in
the United States is, we said, "without question, a weighty
one." Id., at 34. See also Rosenberg v. Fleuti, 374 U. S. 449
(1963); Kwong Hai Chew, supra.

Although LPRs remain subject to the federal removal
power, that power may not be exercised without due process,
and any decision about the requirements of due process for
an LPR must account for the difficulty of distinguishing in
practical as well as doctrinal terms between the liberty interest of an LPR and that of a citizen.8 In evaluating Kim's
challenge to his mandatory detention under 8 U. S. C.

$ 1226(c), the only reasonable starting point is the traditional
doctrine concerning the Government's physical confinement
of individuals.9

8 This case provides no occasion to determine the constitutionality of
mandatory detention of aliens other than LPRs.

9 The statement that "[i]n the exercise of its broad power over naturalization and immigration, Congress regularly makes rules that would be
unacceptable if applied to citizens," Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U. S. 67, 79-80
(1976), cannot be read to leave limitations on the liberty of aliens unreviewable. Ante, at 521-522. Diaz involved a federal statute that limited
eligibility for a federal medical insurance program to United States citizens and LPRs who had been continuously resident in the United States

Kim's claim is a limited one: not that the Government maynot detain LPRs to ensure their appearance at removal hearfor five years. 426 U. S., at 69-70. Reversing a lower court judgment
that this statute violated equal protection, we said this:

"In the exercise of its broad power over naturalization and immigration,
Congress regularly makes rules that would be unacceptable if applied to
citizens. The exclusion of aliens and the reservation of the power to deport have no permissible counterpart in the Federal Government's power
to regulate the conduct of its own citizenry. The fact that an Act of Congress treats aliens differently from citizens does not in itself imply that
such disparate treatment is `invidious.' " Id., at 79-80 (footnotes omitted).

Taken in full, the meaning of this paragraph is plain: through the exercise of the deportation and exclusion power, Congress exposes aliens to a
treatment (expulsion) that cannot be imposed on citizens. The cases cited
in the footnotes to this paragraph accordingly all concern Congress's
power to enact grounds of exclusion or deportation. Id., at 80, nn. 14-15
(citing Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U. S. 753 (1972); Galvan v. Press, 347
U. S. 522 (1954); and Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U. S. 580 (1952));
cf. ante, at 522 (quoting Diaz, supra, at 81, n. 17, in turn quoting Harisiades). Nothing in Diaz addresses due process protection of liberty or
purports to sanction any particular limitation on the liberty of LPRs under
circumstances comparable to those here.

Even on its terms, the Diaz statement is dictum. We acknowledged
immediately that "[t]he real question presented by [Diaz] is not whether
discrimination between citizens and aliens is permissible; rather, it is
whether the statutory discrimination within the class of aliens--allowing
benefits to some aliens but not to others--is permissible." 426 U. S., at 80.
Our holding that Congress could consider length of residence and immigration status in allocating medical insurance in no way suggests the existence of a federal power to imprison a long-term resident alien when the
Government concedes that there is no need to do so.

The Court does not explain why it believes the Diaz dictum to be relevant to this case, other than to repeat it and identify prior instances of its
quotation. Ante, at 521-522. The Court resists calling the statement
" `dictum,' " ante, at 521, but it does not deny that Diaz involved "discrimination within the class of aliens" rather than "discrimination between citizens and aliens," 426 U. S., at 80, thus making any suggestion about Congress's power to treat citizens and aliens differently unnecessary to the
holding. Nor does the Court deny that Diaz dealt with an equal protection challenge to the allocation of medical insurance and had nothing to

ings, but that due process under the Fifth Amendment condi-tions a potentially lengthy detention on a hearing and an

impartial decisionmaker's finding that detention is necessaryto a governmental purpose. He thus invokes our repeated
decisions that the claim of liberty protected by the FifthAmendment is at its strongest when government seeks to
detain an individual. The Chief Justice wrote in 1987that "[i]n our society liberty is the norm, and detention prior
to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception."
United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 755. See also Renov. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 316 (1993) (O'C

Kennedy, J., dissenting) ("As incarcerationof persons is the most common and one of the most feared

instruments of state oppression and state indifference, weought to acknowledge at the outset that freedom from this
restraint is essential to the basic definition of liberty in theFifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution").

Accordingly, the Fifth Amendment permits detention onlywhere "heightened, substantive due process scrutiny" finds
a " `sufficiently compelling' " governmental need. Flores,supra, at 316 (O'C

onnor, J., concurring) (quoting Salerno,481 U. S., at 748). In deciding in

Salerno that this principledid not categorically bar pretrial detention of criminal defendants without bail under the Bail Reform Act of 1984, itwas crucial that the statute provided that, "[i]n a full-blown
adversary hearing, the Government must convince a neutraldecisionmaker by clear and convincing evidence that no conditions of release can reasonably assure the safety of thecommunity or any person."

$ 3142(f)). We stressed that the Act was not a "scattershotattempt to incapacitate those who are merely suspected of "

serious offenses, 481 U. S., at 750, and held that due processallowed some pretrial detention because the Act confined it
to a sphere of real need: "[w]hen the Government proves byclear and convincing evidence that an arrestee presents an
identified and articulable threat to an individual or the community." Id., at 751; see also Foucha, supra, at 81 (callingthe pretrial detention statute in

Salerno a "sharply focused
scheme").We have reviewed involuntary civil commitment statutes

the same way. In Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418 (1979),
we held that a State could not civilly commit the mentally ill
without showing by "clear and convincing evidence" that the
person was dangerous to others, id., at 433. The elevated
burden of proof was demanded because "[l]oss of liberty calls
for a showing that the individual suffers from something
more serious than is demonstrated by idiosyncratic behavior." Id., at 427. The statutory deficiency was the same
in Foucha, where we held that Louisiana's civil commitment
statute failed due process because the individual was denied
an "adversary hearing at which the State must prove by
clear and convincing evidence that he is demonstrably dangerous to the community." 504 U. S., at 81. See also id., at
88 (opinion of O'Connor, J.) (civil commitment depends on
a "necessary connection between the nature and purposes
of confinement").

In addition to requiring a compelling reason for detention,
we held that the class of persons affected must be narrow
and, in pretrial-type lockup, the time must be no more than
what is reasonably necessary before the merits can be resolved. In the case of the Bail Reform Act, we placed
weight on the fact that the statute applied only to defendants
suspected of "the most serious of crimes," Salerno, supra,
at 747; see also Foucha, supra, at 81, while the statute in
Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346 (1997), likewise provided

only for confinement of "a limited subclass of dangerous per-sons" who had committed " `a sexually violent offense' " and

who suffered from " `a mental abnormality or personality dis-order' " portending " `predatory acts of sexual violence,' "

id.,
at 357 (quoting Kan. Stat. Ann. $ 59-29a02(a) (1994)). Salerno relied on the restriction of detention "by the stringent
time limitations of the Speedy Trial Act," 481 U. S., at 747,
whereas in Foucha, it was a fault that the statute did notimpose any comparable limitation, 504 U. S., at 82 (citing

Salerno). See also Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U. S. 715, 738(1972) ("At the least, due process requires that the nature

and duration of commitment bear some reasonable relation
to the purpose for which the individual is committed").

The substantive demands of due process necessarily go
hand in hand with the procedural, and the cases insist at the
least on an opportunity for a detainee to challenge the reason
claimed for committing him. E. g., Hendricks, supra, at 357
(stating that civil commitment was permitted where "the
confinement takes place pursuant to proper procedures and
evidentiary standards"); Foucha, supra, at 81-82 (invalidating a statute under which "the State need prove nothing to
justify continued detention"); Salerno, supra, at 751 ("[T]he
procedures by which a judicial officer evaluates the likelihood
of future dangerousness are specifically designed to further
the accuracy of that determination"); Addington, supra, at
427 (requiring a heightened burden of proof "to impress the
factfinder with the importance of the decision and thereby
perhaps to reduce the chances that inappropriate commitments will be ordered").

These cases yield a simple distillate that should govern the
result here. Due process calls for an individual determination before someone is locked away. In none of the cases
cited did we ever suggest that the government could avoid
the Due Process Clause by doing what $ 1226(c) does, by selecting a class of people for confinement on a categorical basis
and denying members of that class any chance to dispute the

Opinion of Souter, J.
necessity of putting them away. The cases, of course, would
mean nothing if citizens and comparable residents could be
shorn of due process by this sort of categorical sleight of
hand. Without any "full-blown adversary hearing" before
detention, Salerno, supra, at 750, or heightened burden of
proof, Addington, supra, or other procedures to show the
government's interest in committing an individual, Foucha,
supra; Jackson, supra, procedural rights would amount to
nothing but mechanisms for testing group membership.
Cf. Foucha, supra, at 88 (opinion of O'Connor, J.) ("Nor
would it be permissible to treat all acquittees alike, without
regard for their particular crimes"). And if procedure could
be dispensed with so expediently, so presumably could the
substantive requirements that the class of detainees be narrow and the detention period strictly limited. Salerno,
supra; Hendricks, supra.

C

We held as much just two Terms ago in Zadvydas v. Davis,
533 U. S. 678 (2001), which stands for the proposition that
detaining an alien requires more than the rationality of a
general detention statute; any justification must go to the
alien himself. Zadvydas considered detention of two aliens,
Zadvydas and Ma, who had already been ordered removed
and therefore enjoyed no lawful immigration status. Their
cases arose because actual removal appeared unlikely owing
to the refusal of their native countries to accept them, with
the result that they had been detained not only for the standard 90-day removal period, during which time most removal
orders are executed, but beyond that period because the
INS considered them to be a " `risk to the community' " and
" `unlikely to comply with the order of removal.' " Id., at
682 (quoting 8 U. S. C. $ 1231(a)(6) (1994 ed., Supp. V)).
Zadvydas and Ma challenged their continued and potentially
indefinite detention under the Due Process Clause of the
Fifth Amendment.

553Cite as: 538 U. S. 510 (2003)
Opinion of Souter, J.
The Zadvydas opinion opened by noting the clear applica-bility of general due process standards: physical detention

requires both a "special justification" that "outweighs the`individual's constitutionally protected interest in avoiding
physical restraint' " and "adequate procedural protections."533 U. S., at 690 (quoting

Hendricks, 521 U. S., at 356). Nowhere did we suggest that the "constitutionally protected
liberty interest" in avoiding physical confinement, even foraliens already ordered removed, was conceptually different

from the liberty interest of citizens considered in Jackson,
Salerno, Foucha, and Hendricks. On the contrary, we cited
those cases and expressly adopted their reasoning, even as
applied to aliens whose right to remain in the United States
had already been declared forfeited. Zadvydas, 533 U. S.,
at 690.

Thus, we began by positing commonly accepted substantive standards and proceeded to enquire into any "special
justification" that might outweigh the aliens' powerful interest in avoiding physical confinement "under [individually ordered] release conditions that may not be violated." Id., at
696. We found nothing to justify the Government's position.
The statute was not narrowed to a particularly dangerous
class of aliens, but rather affected "aliens ordered removed
for many and various reasons, including tourist visa violations." Id., at 691. The detention itself was not subject
to "stringent time limitations," Salerno, supra, at 747, but
was potentially indefinite or even permanent, Zadvydas, 533
U. S., at 691. Finally, although both Zadvydas and Ma appeared to be dangerous, this conclusion was undermined by
defects in the procedures resulting in the finding of dangerousness. Id., at 692. The upshot was such serious doubt
about the constitutionality of the detention statute that we
construed it as authorizing continuing detention only when
an alien's removal was "reasonably foreseeable." Id., at 699.
In the cases of Zadvydas and Ma, the fact that their countries
of citizenship were not willing to accept their return weighed

554 DEMORE v. KIM

Opinion of Souter, J.
against the Government's interest in keeping them at handfor instant removal, even though both were serious flight

risks, id., at 684-686, 690, and we remanded the cases to theCourts of Appeals for a determination of the sufficiency of
the Government's interests in Zadvydas's and Ma's individualdetention,

id., at 702.
Our individualized analysis and disposition in Zadvydas
support Kim's claim for an individualized review of his chal-lenge to the reasons that are supposed to justify confining

him prior to any determination of removability. In fact,aliens in removal proceedings have an additional interest
in avoiding confinement, beyond anything considered in
Zadvydas: detention prior to entry of a removal order may
well impede the alien's ability to develop and present his case
on the very issue of removability. See Brief for Citizens and
Immigrants for Equal Justice et al. as Amici Curiae 20-23.
After all, our recognition that the serious penalty of removal
must be justified on a heightened standard of proof, Woodby
v. INS, 385 U. S. 276 (1966), will not mean all that much when
the INS can detain, transfer, and isolate aliens away from
their lawyers, witnesses, and evidence. Cf. Stack v. Boyle,
342 U. S. 1, 4 (1951). Kim's right to defend against removal gives him an even stronger claim than the aliens in
Zadvydas could raise.

In fact, the principal dissenters in Zadvydas, as well as
the majority, accepted a theory that would compel success
for Kim in this case. The dissent relied on the fact that
Zadvydas and Ma were subject to a "final order of removal"
and had "no right under the basic immigration laws to remain in this country," 533 U. S., at 720 (opinion of Kennedy,
J.), in distinguishing them "from aliens with a lawful right
to remain here," ibid., which is Kim's position. The dissent
recognized the right of all aliens, even "removable and inadmissible" ones, to be "free from detention that is arbitrary
or capricious," id., at 721, and the opinion explained that detention would pass the "arbitrary or capricious" test "when

Opinion of Souter, J.
necessary to avoid the risk of flight or danger to the community," ibid.10

Hence the Zadvydas dissent's focus on "whether there are
adequate procedures" allowing "persons once subject to detention to show that through rehabilitation, new appreciation
of their responsibilities, or under other standards, they no
longer present special risks or danger if put at large." Ibid.;
see also id., at 722-723. Indeed, there is further support for
Kim's claim in the dissent's view that the process afforded to
removable aliens like Zadvydas and Ma "[went] far toward
th[e] objective" of satisfying procedural due process, id., at
722; 11 that process stands in stark contrast to the total ab10 In support of its standard, the dissent relied on a report by the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which likewise countenanced
detention only "in cases of necessity" and stated, under a heading entitled
"Guideline 3: Exceptional Grounds for Detention":

"There should be a presumption against detention. Where there are
monitoring mechanisms which can be employed as viable alternatives to
detention, (such as reporting obligations or guarantor requirements . . .),
these should be applied first unless there is evidence to suggest that such
an alternative will not be effective in the individual case. Detention
should therefore only take place after a full consideration of all possible
alternatives, or when monitoring mechanisms have been demonstrated not
to have achieved the lawful and legitimate purpose." United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees, Revised Guidelines on Applicable Criteria and Standards Relating to the Detention of Asylum Seekers (Feb.
1999) (hereinafter Detention Guidelines) (emphasis in original), cited
in Zadvydas, 533 U. S., at 721 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).

The High Commissioner also referred to the "minimum procedural guarante[e]" for a detainee "either personally or through a representative, to
challenge the necessity of the deprivation of liberty at the review hearing,
and to rebut any findings made." Detention Guidelines, Guideline 5: Procedural Safeguards.

11 The scheme considered in Zadvydas did not provide review immediately after the removability determination; the dissent noted that custody
review hearings usually occurred within three months of a transfer to a
postorder detention unit, with further reviews annually or more frequently if the alien requested them. 533 U. S., at 722-723. But the lag
was fitted to the circumstances. In the usual case, removal in fact would

Opinion of Souter, J.
sence of custody review available in response to Kim's claim
that he is neither dangerous nor a flight risk.12 The removable aliens in Zadvydas had the right to a hearing, to representation, and to consideration of facts bearing on risk of
flight, including criminal history, evidence of rehabilitation,
and ties to the United States. Ibid. The references to the
"necessity" of an individual's detention and the discussion
of the procedural requirements show that the principal
Zadvydas dissenters envisioned due process as individualized review, and the Court of Appeals in this case correctly
held that Kim's mandatory detention without benefit of individualized enquiry violated due process as understood
by both the Zadvydas majority and Justice Kennedy in
dissent. Kim v. Ziglar, 276 F. 3d 523, 535-537 (CA9
2002). Every Court of Appeals to consider the detention of

come promptly; it is only when it did not that interim custody raised a
substantial issue. The issue here, of course, is not timing but the right to
individualized review at all.

12 The hearing recognized in Matter of Joseph, 22 I. & N. Dec. 799 (BIA

1999), is no response to this deficiency. As the Court notes, the " `Joseph
hearing' " only permits an alien to show that he does not meet the statutory criteria for mandatory detention under $ 1226(c). Ante, at 514, and
n. 3. Kim argues that, even assuming that he fits under the statute, the
statute's application to LPRs like him does not fit under the Due Process
Clause.

Justice Kennedy recognizes that the Due Process Clause requires "an
individualized determination as to [an LPR's] risk of flight and dangerousness if the continued detention [becomes] unreasonable or unjustified."
Ante, at 532 (concurring opinion). It is difficult to see how Kim's detention in this case is anything but unreasonable and unjustified, since the
Government concedes that detention is not necessary to completion of his
removal proceedings or to the community's protection. Certainly the fact
that "there is at least some merit to the [INS's] charge" that Kim should
be held to be removable, ante, at 531, does not establish a compelling
reason for detention. The INS releases many noncriminal aliens on bond

In sum, due process requires a "special justification" forphysical detention that "outweighs the individual's constitutionally protected interest in avoiding physical restraint"as well as "adequate procedural protections."

By these standards, Kim's case is an easy one. "[H]eight-ened, substantive due process scrutiny," Flores, supra, at

316 (O'Connor, J., concurring), uncovers serious infirmitiesin $ 1226(c). Detention is not limited to dangerous criminal
aliens or those found likely to flee, but applies to all aliensclaimed to be deportable for criminal convictions, even
where the underlying offenses are minor. E. g., Michel v.
INS, 206 F. 3d 253, 256 (CA2 2000) (possession of stolen bustransfers); Matter of Bart, 20 I. & N. Dec. 436 (BIA 1992)

(issuance of a bad check). Detention under $ 1226(c) is notlimited by the kind of time limit imposed by the Speedy Trial
Act, and while it lasts only as long as the removal proceed-ings, those proceedings have no deadline and may last over
a year. See Brief for Citizens and Immigrants for EqualJustice et al. as Amici Curiae 23-26; see also id., at 10-20
(citing examples). Section 1226(c) neither requires nor per-mits an official to determine whether Kim's detention was
necessary to prevent flight or danger.Kim's detention without particular justification in these respects, or the opportunity to enquire into it, violates bothcomponents of due process, and I would accordingly affirm
the judgment of the Court of Appeals requiring the INS tohold a bail hearing to see whether detention is needed to
avoid a risk of flight or a danger to the community.14 Thisis surely little enough, given the fact that 8 U. S. C. $ 1536
gives an LPR charged with being a foreign terrorist theright to a release hearing pending a determination that he
be removed. III

The Court proceeds to the contrary conclusion on thepremise that "the Government may constitutionally detain

a State's interest in punishing those who violate its criminal laws. Kim

him.

deportable aliens during the limited period necessary fortheir removal proceedings."

Ante, at 526. Sometimes,
maybe often, it may, but that is not the point in contention.Kim has never challenged the INS's general power to detain

aliens in removal proceedings or even its power to detainhim in particular, if it affords him a chance to participate
in an enquiry whether he poses a flight risk or a danger to
society.The question, rather, is whether Congress has chosen " `a

constitutionally permissible means of implementing' [its im-migration] power."

Zadvydas, supra, at 695 (quoting INS
v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 941-942 (1983)); see also Carlsonv.

Landon, 342 U. S. 524, 537 (1952) (stating that the deportation power "is, of course, subject to judicial interven-tion under the `paramount law of the Constitution' "). As

in Zadvydas, we are here concerned not with the powerto remove aliens but with the "important constitutional limitations" on that power's exercise. Zadvydas, supra, at
695.15

15 The Court's citations to Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U. S. 228
(1896), are therefore inapposite. Ante, at 523, 531. In Wong Wing, we
hypothesized that detention "necessary to give effect" to the removal of
an alien "would be valid"; the use of the subjunctive mood makes plain
that the issue was not before the Court. 163 U. S., at 235. Wong Wing
certainly did not hold that detention in aid of removal was exempt from
the Due Process Clause.

Moreover, the Wong Wing dictum must be understood in light of the
common contemporary practice in the federal courts of releasing aliens on
bail pending deportation proceedings. While the Court is correct that
the first statutory provision permitting Executive officials to release aliens
on bond was enacted in 1907, ante, at 523, n. 7, the Court ignores the
numerous judicial grants of bail prior to that year. See, e. g., United
States ex rel. Turner v. Williams, 194 U. S. 279, 283 (1904) (stating that
the lower court admitted the appellant to bail pending appeal to this

560 DEMORE v. KIM

Opinion of Souter, J.

A
The Court spends much effort trying to distinguish Zadvydas, but even if the Court succeeded, success would notavail it much. Zadvydas was an application of principles developed in over a century of cases on the rights of aliensand the limits on the government's power to confine individuals. While there are differences between detention pendingremoval proceedings (this case) and detention after entry of
a removal order (Zadvydas), the differences merely point up
bail pending an investigation into the lawfulness of their residence within
the United States, and before any order for deportation has been made");
In re Ah Tai, 125 F. 795, 796-797 (Mass. 1903) (identifying a practice in
several federal districts admitting aliens to bail, both before an initial
finding of deportability and during the appeal therefrom); In re Chow Goo
Pooi, 25 F. 77, 78 (CC Cal. 1884). The breadth of this practice is evident
from one court's statement that "[t]o hold bail altogether inadmissible . . .
would invalidate hundreds of existing recognizances." Ah Tai, supra,
at 797.

As Judge Augustus Hand later noted, the only change in 1907 was that
bail decisions were committed to the discretion of Executive officials,
rather than judges:

"Prior to the passage by Congress in 1907 of the act empowering the
administrative official to fix bail, various courts made it a practice to grant
bail to aliens during deportation hearings. . . . In our opinion that act was
intended to place the general determination of granting bail in the hands
of the authorities charged with the enforcement of the deportation laws
as persons ordinarily best qualified to perform such a function . . . ."
United States ex rel. Potash v. District Director of Immigration and Naturalization, 169 F. 2d 747, 751 (CA2 1948) (citations omitted).

Thus, while Wong Wing stated in passing that detention may be used
where it was "part of the means necessary" to the removal of aliens, 163
U. S., at 235, that statement was written against the background of the
general availability of judicial relief from detention pending deportation
proceedings.

The judicial grants of bail prior to 1907 arose in federal habeas proceedings. Contrary to Justice O'Connor's objection to federal jurisdiction
in this matter, there is indeed a "history of routine reliance on habeas
jurisdiction to challenge the detention of aliens without bail pending the
conclusion of removal proceedings." Ante, at 536 (opinion concurring in
part and concurring in judgment).

that Kim's is the stronger claim, see supra, at 554-556. In
any case, the analytical framework set forth in Salerno, Foucha, Hendricks, Jackson, and other physical confinement
cases applies to both, and the two differences the Court relies upon fail to remove Kim's challenge from the ambit of
either the earlier cases or Zadvydas itself.16

First, the Court says that $ 1226(c) "serves the purpose of
preventing deportable criminal aliens from fleeing prior to
or during their removal proceedings." Ante, at 528. Yes it
does, and the statute in Zadvydas, viewed outside the context of any individual alien's detention, served the purpose
of preventing aliens ordered to be deported from fleeing
prior to actual deportation. In each case, the fact that
a statute serves its purpose in general fails to justify the
detention of an individual in particular. Some individual
aliens covered by $ 1226(c) have meritorious challenges to
removability or claims for relief from removal. See Brief
for Citizens and Immigrants for Equal Justice et al. as Amici
Curiae 10-20. As to such aliens, as with Zadvydas and Ma,
the Government has only a weak reason under the immigration laws for detaining them.

The Court appears to respond that Congress may require
detention of removable aliens based on a general conclusion
that detention is needed for effective removal of criminal
aliens on a class-wide basis. But on that logic Zadvydas
should have come out the other way, for detention of the
entire class of aliens who have actually been ordered removed will in general "serv[e] the purpose" of their effective
removal, ante, at 528. Yet neither the Court nor Justice
Kennedy in dissent suggested that scrutiny under the Due
Process Clause could be satisfied at such a general level.
Rather, we remanded the individual cases of Zadvydas and
Ma for determinations of the strength of the Government's

16 The Court tellingly does not even mention Salerno, Foucha, Hendricks, or Jackson.

reasons for detaining them in particular. 533 U. S., at 702.17We can insist on nothing less here, since the Government's

justification for detaining individuals like Zadvydas and Ma,who had no right to remain in this country and were proven
flight risks and dangers to society, id., at 684-686, is cer-tainly stronger (and at least no weaker) than its interest in
detaining a lawful permanent resident who has not beenshown (or even claimed) to be either a flight risk or a threat
to the community.18The Court's closest approach to a reason justifying classwide detention without exception here is a Senate Reportstating that over 20% of nondetained criminal aliens failed

17 The Court is therefore mistaken in suggesting that I view the detention of the individual aliens in Zadvydas as serving a governmental purpose. Ante, at 527, n. 10. The Court confuses the "statute in Zadvydas,
viewed outside the context of any individual alien's detention," supra, at
561, with the "detention at issue in Zadvydas," ante, at 527, n. 10, namely,
the detention of Zadvydas and Ma as individuals. The due process analysis in Zadvydas concentrated on the latter, holding that the detention of
Zadvydas and Ma would not serve a legitimate immigration purpose if
there were no "significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future." 533 U. S., at 701. Thus, the Court's suggestion in this case
that "the statutory provision" authorizes "detention" that prevents deportable aliens from fleeing as a general matter, ante, at 527-528, is no
sufficient basis for claiming Zadvydas as support for the Court's methodology or result. Rather, the Court should consider whether the detention
of Kim as an individual is necessary to a compelling Government interest,
just as it did for the detention of Zadvydas and Ma as individuals. As the
Government concedes, Kim's individual detention serves no Government
purpose at all.

18 Nor can the general risk of recidivism, ante, at 518-519, justify this

measure. The interest in preventing recidivism may be vindicated "by
the ordinary criminal processes involving charge and conviction, the use
of enhanced sentences for recidivists, and other permissible ways of dealing with patterns of criminal conduct." Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U. S.
71, 82 (1992). The ability to detain aliens in removal proceedings who
pose threats to the community also satisfies this interest. Cf. United
States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739 (1987). The alternative to detention, of
course, is not unrestricted liberty, but supervised release, which also addresses the risk of recidivism. Zadvydas, 533 U. S., at 696.

to appear for removal hearings. Ante, at 519 (citing S. Rep.
No. 104-48 (1995) (hereinafter Senate Report)). To begin
with, the Senate Report's statistic treats all criminal aliens
alike and does not distinguish between LPRs like Kim, who
are likely to have developed strong ties within the United
States, see supra, at 544-547, and temporary visitors or illegal entrants. Even more importantly, the statistic tells us
nothing about flight risk at all because, as both the Court
and the Senate Report recognize, the INS was making its
custody determinations not on the ground of likelihood of
flight or dangerousness, but "in large part, according to the
number of beds available in a particular region." Senate
Report 23, cited ante, at 519; see also H. R. Rep. No. 104-469,
p. 124 (1995) (hereinafter House Report) ("[I]n deciding

to release a deportable alien, the INS is making a decision
that the alien cannot be detained given its limited resources"); App. 26-27. This meant that the INS often could
not detain even the aliens who posed serious flight risks.
Senate Report 23 (noting that the INS had only 3,500 detention beds for criminal aliens in the entire country and
the INS district comprising Pennsylvania, Delaware, and
West Virginia had only 15). The desperate lack of detention
space likewise had led the INS to set bonds too low, because
"if the alien is not able to pay, the alien cannot be released,
and a needed bed space is lost." House Report 124. The
Senate Report also recognized that, even when the INS identifies a criminal alien, the INS "often refuses to take action
because of insufficient agents to transport prisoners, or because of limited detention space." Senate Report 2. Four
former high-ranking INS officials explained the Court's statistics as follows: "Flight rates were so high in the early
1990s not as a result of chronic discretionary judgment failures by [the] INS in assessing which aliens might pose a
flight risk. Rather, the rates were alarmingly high because
decisions to release aliens in proceedings were driven over538US2 Unit: $U47 [02-09-05 15:24:15] PAGES PGT: OPLG

whelmingly by a lack of detention facilities." Brief for T.Alexander Aleinikoff et al. as Amici Curiae 19.

The Court's recognition that, at the time of the enactmentof $ 1226(c), "individualized bail determinations had not been
tested under optimal conditions" is thus rather an under-statement. Ante, at 528. The Court does not explain how
the INS's resource-driven decisions to release individualswho pose serious flight risks, and their predictable failure to
attend removal hearings, could justify a systemwide denialof any opportunity for release to individuals like Kim who
are neither flight risks nor threats to the public.The Court also cites a report by the Department of Justice
relied upon by the Government. Department of Justice, Of-fice of the Inspector General, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Deportation of Aliens After Final Orders Have
Been Issued, Rep. No. I-96-03 (Mar. 1996), App. 14 (herein-after Post-Order Report), cited

ante, at 519, 521. But that
report does not even address the issue of detention before adetermination has been made that an alien is removable. As

its title indicates, the Post-Order Report analyzed removal
rates only for aliens who had already received final orders ofremovability.

19 See also Post-Order Report, App. 25 ("This

current review was limited to actions taken by INS to re-move aliens after [immigration judges or the Board of Immigration Appeals] had issued final orders").20

19 Detention of such aliens is governed by the statute at issue in
Zadvydas, $ 1231(a), not by $ 1226(c).

20 A prior study by the same body noted that nonappearance rates by

aliens in deportation proceedings before issuance of orders to deport
(aliens, that is, like Kim) were approximately 23% for the first half of 1993
and 21% for all of 1992. Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector
General, Case Hearing Process in the Executive Office for Immigration
Review, Rep. No. I-93-03, p. 5 (May 1994) (hereinafter Case Hearing Report). Congress appears to have considered these relevant figures, Senate Report 2 ("Over 20 percent of nondetained criminal aliens fail to
appear for deportation proceedings"), without referring to irrelevant
postorder numbers. The Government relied on the Post-Order Report

More relevant to this case, and largely ignored by theCourt, is a recent study conducted at the INS's request concluding that 92% of criminal aliens (most of whom wereLPRs) who were released under supervisory conditions attended all of their hearings. 1 Vera Institute of Justice,Testing Community Supervision for the INS: An Evaluation
of the Appearance Assistance Program, pp. ii, 33, 36 (Aug.
1, 2000) (hereinafter Vera Institute Study). Even withoutsupervision, 82% of criminal aliens released on recognizance

Tr. of Oral Arg. 23. The Government did not cite the Case Hearing
Report.

21 The Court throws in minor criticisms of the Vera Institute Study that

have no bearing on its relevance here. The institute's supervised release
program included 127 criminal aliens who would be subject to mandatory
detention under $ 1226(c) because of their criminal histories. Vera Institute Study 33. Since the INS seeks Kim's removal on the grounds of
either crimes of moral turpitude or an aggravated felony, see ante, at 513,
n. 1, the fact that most of the Vera Institute Study's subjects were convicted of crimes of moral turpitude but not an aggravated felony, ante, at
520, n. 5, is of no moment. Nor were all of the aliens studied subject to
intensive supervision, ibid.; most were subject to "regular supervision,"
which involved no mandatory reporting sessions beyond an initial orientation session with supervision staff and required only that the alien keep
the staff apprised of a current mailing address, appear in court, and comply with the orders of the immigration judge, Vera Institute Study 17-18.
That the institute considered various screening criteria before authorizing
supervised release, ante, at 520, n. 5, does not undermine the value of the
study, since any program adopted by the INS in lieu of mandatory detention could do the same. Cf. Zadvydas, 533 U. S., at 696. Finally, the fact
that Kim sought and was granted release on bond rather than supervised
release, ante, at 520, n. 5, does not detract from the relevance of the Vera
Institute Study. Regardless of what methods the INS decides to employ
to prevent flight, the study supports the conclusion that mandatory deten538US2 Unit: $U47 [02-09-05 15:24:15] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Opinion of Souter, J.
The Court nowhere addresses the Vera Institute's conclu-sion that criminal aliens released under supervisory conditions are overwhelmingly likely to attend their hearings.Instead, the Court fixes on the fact that 23% of the comparison group of aliens released on bond failed to attend all oftheir hearings. Ante, at 519-520. Since the bond determinations were made by the INS, the fact remains thatresource-driven concerns may well have led the INS to release individuals who were evident flight risks on bonds toolow to ensure their attendance. See

supra, at 563-564.The Court's assumption that the INS's bond determinations

involved "individualized screening" for flight risk, ante, at520, finds no support in the Vera Institute Study. Thus the
Court's reliance on the failure rate of aliens released by theINS on bond, whether it comes from the Senate Report or
the Vera Institute Study, ante, at 519-520, does not supportits conclusion.

In sum, the Court's inapposite statistics do not show thatdetention of criminal LPRs pending removal proceedings,
even on a general level, is necessary to ensure attendance atremoval hearings, and the Vera Institute Study reinforces
the point by establishing the effectiveness of release undersupervisory conditions, just as we did in

Zadvydas. 533U. S., at 696 (noting that imprisonment was constitutionally

suspect given the possibility of "supervision under releaseconditions that may not be violated").

tion under $ 1226(c) is "not necessary" to prevent flight, Vera Institute

22 This case accordingly presents no issue of " `court ordered release,' "

ante, at 530, n. 14 (quoting Zadvydas, supra, at 713 (Kennedy, J., dissenting)); in this case, for example, the INS reached its own determination to
release Kim on bond. This case concerns only the uncontroversial requirement that detention serve a compelling governmental interest and
that detainees be afforded adequate procedures ensuring against erroneous confinement. E. g., Salerno, 481 U. S., at 751 ("[T]he procedures by

Opinion of Souter, J.
The Court's second effort is its claim that mandatory de-tention under $ 1226(c) is generally of a "much shorter duration" than the incarceration at issue in Zadvydas. Ante,at 528. While it is true that removal proceedings are unlikely to prove "indefinite and potentially permanent," 533U. S., at 696, they are not formally limited to any period, and
often extend beyond the time suggested by the Court, that
is, "an average time of 47 days" or, for aliens who exercisetheir right of appeal, "an average of four months,"

ante, at
529; see also Case Hearing Report 12 (finding that the aver-age time from receipt of charging documents by a detained

alien to a final decision by the immigration judge was 54days). Even taking these averages on their face, however,
they are no legitimate answer to the due process claim toindividualized treatment and hearing.

In the first place, the average time from receipt of charg-ing documents to decision obscures the fact that the alien
may receive charging documents only after being detainedfor a substantial period. Kim, for example, was not charged
until five weeks after the INS detained him. Brief for
Respondent 9.Even more revealing is an explanation of the raw numbers

that are averaged out. As the Solicitor General conceded,the length of the average detention period in great part reflects the fact that the vast majority of cases involve alienswho raise no challenge to removability at all. Tr. of Oral

challenges to removability requiring lengthy proceedings.23
See Vera Institute Study 33, 37 (stating that many of the
criminal aliens studied were "lawful permanent residents
who have spent much or all of their adult lives in the United
States" and that 40% of those released on supervision "were
allowed to stay in the United States"). Successful challenges often require several months of proceedings, see Brief
for Citizens and Immigrants for Equal Justice et al. as Amici
Curiae 10-20; detention for an open-ended period like this
falls far short of the "stringent time limitations" held to be
significant in Salerno, 481 U. S., at 747. The potential for
several months of confinement requires an individualized
finding of necessity under Zadvydas.24

B
The Court has failed to distinguish Zadvydas in any way
that matters. It does no better in its effort to portray its
result in this case as controlled by Carlson v. Landon, 342
U. S. 524 (1952), and Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292 (1993).

23 Criminal aliens whose "removal proceedings are completed while
[they are] still serving time for the underlying conviction," ante, at 529,
are irrelevant to this case, since they are never detained pending removal
proceedings under $ 1226(c).

24 The Court calls several months of unnecessary imprisonment a "very

limited time," ante, at 529, n. 12. But the due process requirement of an
individualized finding of necessity applies to detention periods shorter
than Kim's. Schall v. Martin, 467 U. S. 253 (1984), involved a maximum
detention period of 17 days, id., at 270, yet our due process analysis noted
that the detainee was entitled to a hearing in which he could challenge the
necessity of his confinement before an impartial decisionmaker required to
state the facts and reasons underlying any decision to detain, id., at 276-
277. The 90-day removal period in $ 1231(a)(1) not only has a fixed endpoint, but also applies only after the alien has been adjudged removable,

$ 1231(a)(1)(B). The discussion of that provision in Zadvydas cannot be
read to indicate any standard of permissible treatment of an LPR who has
not yet been found removable.

Carlson did not involve mandatory detention. It involved
a system similar to the one Kim contends for here. The
aliens' detention pending deportation proceedings in Carlson
followed a decision on behalf of the Attorney General that
custody was preferable to release on bond or on conditional
parole. 342 U. S., at 528, n. 5 (citing Internal Security Act
of 1950, $ 23, 64 Stat. 1011). We sustained that decision because we found that the District Director of the INS, to
whom the Attorney General had delegated the authority, did
not abuse his discretion in concluding that "evidence of membership [in the Communist Party] plus personal activity in
supporting and extending the Party's philosophy concerning
violence" made the aliens "a menace to the public interest."
342 U. S., at 541. The significance of looking to "personal
activity" in our analysis was complemented by our express
recognition that there was "no evidence or contention that
all persons arrested as deportable . . . for Communist membership are denied bail," id., at 541-542, and by a Government report showing that in fact "the large majority" of
aliens arrested on charges comparable to the Carlson petitioners' were allowed bail. Id., at 542; see also id., at 538,
n. 31 (noting that it was "quite clear" that "detention without
bond has been the exception").

Indeed, the Carlson Court's constitutional analysis relying
on the opportunity for individualized bond determinations
simply followed the argument in the brief for the United
States in that case. In response to the aliens' argument that
the statute made it "mandatory on the Attorney General to
deny bail to alien communists," the Government stated, "[w]e
need not consider the constitutionality of such a law for that
is not what the present law provides." Brief for Respondent in Carlson v. Landon, O. T. 1951, No. 35, p. 19; see also
id., at 20 ("[T]he act itself, by its terms, leaves no doubt that
the power to detain is discretionary, not mandatory"). The

Government also presented the following excerpt of a state-ment of the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee:

" `No particular hardship is going to be worked on any-one because, bear this fact in mind, it is not mandatory
on the Attorney General to hold people in detention.He is given discretionary power. If in his judgment
one of the class of people I have just mentioned oughtto be held for paramount national reasons, he may detain
him, but he is not obliged to hold anybody, although Itrust that in every case of a subversive or a hardened
criminal he will.' " Id., at 19 (quoting 96 Cong. Rec.10449-10450 (1950) (statement of Rep. Walter) (emphasis
added in Brief for Respondent in Carlson v. Landon,
supra)).

In short, Carlson addressed a very different scheme fromthe one here.

It is also beside the point for the Court to suggest that"like respondent in the present case," the

Carlson petition-ers challenged their detention because "there had been no

finding that they were unlikely to appear for their deporta-tion proceedings." Ante, at 524. Each of them was detained after being found to be "a menace to the public inter-est," 342 U. S., at 541, and their challenge, unlike Kim's, was
that the INS had locked them up for an impermissible reason(danger to society) whereas only a finding of risk of flight
would have justified detention. Id., at 533-534 ("It is urged. . . that where there is no evidence to justify a fear of unavailability for the hearings or for the carrying out of a possi-ble judgment of deportation, denial of bail under the circumstances of these cases is an abuse of discretion"); see also id.,at 551 (Black, J., dissenting) ("A power to put in jail because
dangerous cannot be derived from a power to deport").25

25 Similarly, the question presented in Butterfield v. Zydok, argued and
decided together with Carlson, was "[w]hether, in exercising his discretion
to grant or withhold bail pending final determination of the deportability

571Cite as: 538 U. S. 510 (2003)
Opinion of Souter, J.
We rejected that contention, leaving the petitioners in detention because they were dangerous to the public interest, and
on that issue, an official had determined that the Carlson
petitioners ought to be detained. Here, however, no impartial decisionmaker has determined that detaining Kim is required for any purpose at all, and neither the Government
nor the Court even claims such a need.

For the same reason it is beside the point to note that the
unsuccessful Carlson petitioners' brief raised a claim that
detention without reference to facts personal to their individual cases would violate the Due Process Clause. Ante,
at 524. As the United States pointed out in its own Carlson
brief, that issue was never presented, since the District Director's exercise of discretion was based on individualized
determinations that the petitioners were dangerous to society. See supra, at 570.26 Nor is the Court entitled to invoke Carlson by saying that the INS "had adopted a policy
of refusing to grant bail" to alien Communists, which made
the Attorney General's discretion to release aliens on bond
merely "ostensibl[e]." Ante, at 524. The Carlson Court
found that "[t]here is no evidence or contention that all perof an alien, the Attorney General is justified in denying bail on the ground
that the alien is an active participant in Communist Party affairs, or
whether he is bound also to consider other circumstances, particularly the
likelihood that the alien will report as ordered." Pet. for Cert. in Butterfield v. Zydok, O. T. 1951, No. 136, p. 2.

26 While a prior conviction may sometimes evidence a risk of future danger, it is not conclusive in all cases, and Kim is a good example, given that
the Government found that he "would not be considered a threat." App.
13. Indeed, the Court acknowledges that convictions are only "relevant
to" dangerousness, ante, at 525, n. 9; it does not state that they compel a
finding of danger in all cases. As even the Zadvydas dissent recognized,
due process requires that detained criminal aliens be given an opportunity
to rebut the necessity of detention by showing "that through rehabilitation, new appreciation of their responsibilities, or under other standards,
they no longer present special risks or danger if put at large." 533 U. S.,
at 721 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).

sons arrested as deportable . . . for Communist membershipare denied bail." 342 U. S., at 541-542.

The Court refuses to accept the opinion of the CarlsonCourt and the representations made in the successful brief
for the Government in that case. The Court not only failsto acknowledge the actual holding of Carlson; it improperly adopts as authority statements made in dissent. TheCourt's emphatic assertion that "[t]here was no `individualized findin[g]' of likely future dangerousness as to any of thealiens,"

ante, at 525, rests entirely on opinions voiced in dis-sent, although the Court only mentions this fact in a footnote, ante, at 525, n. 8 (citing 342 U. S., at 549, 550, n. 5,552 (Black, J., dissenting), and

id., at 567 (Frankfurter, J.,
dissenting)). Statements made in dissent do not overridethe

Carlson Court's express finding that the petitioners in
that case were found to be not only members of the Commu-nist Party, but "active in Communist work" and to "a degree,

minor perhaps in [one] case, [participants] in Communist ac-tivities."

Id., at 541.27
Moreover, the Carlson dissenters did not suggest that no
individualized determinations had occurred; rather, they con-tended that the District Director's individual findings of dangerousness were unsupported by sufficient reliable evidence.See

id., at 549-550 (Black, J., dissenting) (arguing that the
aliens were not in fact " `dangerous' " at all); id., at 552 (ar-guing that danger findings were based on "the rankest hearsay evidence" instead of the INS being "required to prove"that the detainee was dangerous);

id., at 555-556 (arguing
that activity within the Communist movement did not makethe aliens "dangerous");

id., at 566-567 (Frankfurter, J.,

27 In the footnote immediately following its citation of dissenting opinions, the Court cites a passage from the Carlson majority opinion confirming that the Carlson petitioners' detention rested on the "allegation, supported by affidavits, that the [INS's] dossier of each petitioner contained
evidence" of Communist Party membership and activities "to the prejudice of the public interest." 342 U. S., at 530 (quoted ante, at 525, n. 9).

dissenting) (arguing that evidence of Communist party mem-bership was "insufficient to show danger"; that evidence of

some aliens' activities was stale; and that the history oftreatment of the aliens involved forced him to conclude that
the Attorney General was not actually exercising discretionon an individual basis).

28 And even if the Carlson dissenters

were factually correct, all that would show is that the Carlson Court was misled (by the Government, no less) into de-ciding the case on the basis that individualized findings of

dangerousness were made. Given that the Carlson Courtclearly believed that it was deciding a case in which individualized determinations occurred, it is serious error for thisCourt to treat Carlson as deciding a case in which they
did not.Finally, the Court gets no help from the isolated passages
of the Carlson opinion that it quotes. Although the CarlsonCourt stated that detention was " `a part' " of deportation
procedure, ante, at 524 (quoting Carlson, 342 U. S., at 538),it nowhere said that detention was part of every deportation
proceeding. Instead, it acknowledged that "the far largerpart" of aliens deportable on "subversive charges" were re28 Justice Black's dissenting statement that one of the aliens was " `not
likely to engage in any subversive activities,' " 342 U. S., at 549, does not
amount to a "specific finding of nondangerousness," ante, at 525. On the
contrary, the Court expressly stated that the Government could prove
dangerousness based on "personal activity" in the Communist Party; it
simply was not required to go so far as to show "specific acts of sabotage
or incitement to subversive action." Carlson, supra, at 541. Thus while
there was no finding of "subversive action," there certainly was a finding
of "danger," albeit one that Justice Black found unconvincing.

Likewise, Justice Frankfurter's statement in dissent that the Solicitor
General of the United States had "advised" that "it has been the Government's policy . . . to terminate bail" for aliens awaiting deportation who
were "present active Communists," 342 U. S., at 568, is difficult to reconcile with the contrary statements in both the majority opinion and the
United States's brief in Carlson, see supra, at 569-572. Whatever its
basis, Justice Frankfurter's reference to a "policy" of bail denials does not
bear the weight that the Court places upon it today.

leased on "modest bonds or personal recognizances" pendingtheir deportation proceedings. Id., at 538, n. 31. Contrary

to the Court's holding today, the Carlson Court understoodthat discretion to admit to bail was necessary, since "[o]f
course [a] purpose to injure [the United States] could notbe imputed generally to all aliens subject to deportation."
Id., at 538. It was only in this light that the Court said thatthe INS could "justify [its] refusal of bail by reference to
the legislative scheme to eradicate the evils of Communistactivity"; the Court was referring to the INS's power to
detain on a finding that a given alien was engaged in Com-munist activity that threatened society.

Id., at 543. TheCourt nowhere addressed, much less approved, the notion

that the INS could justify, or that Congress could compel, anindividual's detention without any determination at all that
his detention was necessary to some Government purpose.And if there was ever any doubt on this point, it failed to
survive our subsequent, unanimous recognition that the de-tention scheme in

Carlson required "some level of individual-ized determination" as a precondition to detention. INS v.

National Center for Immigrants' Rights, Inc., 502 U. S. 183,194-195 (1991); see also Flores, 507 U. S., at 313. Carlson
stands at odds with the Court's outcome in this case.

2
The Court's paragraph on Flores, supra, is no more helpto it. Like

Carlson, Flores did not involve mandatory de-tention, and the INS regulation at issue in Flores actually

required that alien juveniles be released pending removalproceedings unless the INS determined that detention was
required " `to secure [the juvenile's] timely appearance beforethe [INS] or the immigration court or to ensure the juvenile's
safety or that of others.' " 507 U. S., at 297 (quoting 8 CFR$ 242.24(b)(1) (1992)). Again, Kim agrees that such a system
is constitutional and contends for it here. Flores turned noton the necessity of detention, but on the regulation's restric538US2 Unit: $U47 [02-09-05 15:24:15] PAGES PGT: OPLG

575Cite as: 538 U. S. 510 (2003)
Opinion of Souter, J.
tion that alien juveniles could only be released to the custodyof the juvenile's parent, legal guardian, or another specified

adult relative. Even this limitation, however, was subjectto exception for releasing a juvenile to another person in
" `unusual and compelling circumstances and in the discretionof the [INS] district director or chief patrol agent.' " 507
U. S., at 297 (quoting 8 CFR $ 242.24(b)(4) (1992)).

Thus, the substantive due process issue in Flores was notwhether the aliens' detention was necessary to a governmental purpose: " `freedom from physical restraint' " was "not atissue" at all because, as juveniles, the aliens were " `always
in some form of custody.' " 507 U. S., at 302 (quoting Schallv.

Martin, 467 U. S. 253, 265 (1984)). Since " `[l]egal custody'
rather than `detention' more accurately describes the realityof the arrangement" in

Flores, 507 U. S., at 298, that case
has no bearing on this one, which concerns the detention ofan adult.

29

Flores is equally distinguishable at the procedural level.
We held that the procedures for the custody decision sufficed
constitutionally because any determination to keep the alien
"in the custody of the [INS], released on recognizance, or
released under bond" was open to review by the immigration
court, the Board of Immigration Appeals, and the federal
courts. Id., at 308. Like the aliens in Carlson, the juveniles in Flores were subject to a different system and raised
a different complaint from Kim's.

While Flores holds that the INS may use "reasonable presumptions and generic rules" in carrying out its statutory
discretion, 507 U. S., at 313, it gave no carte blanche to gen29 Nor is it to the point for the Court to quote Flores as rejecting the
aliens' challenge to a " ` "blanket" presumption of the unsuitability of custodians other than parents, close relatives, and guardians.' " Ante, at 526
(quoting 507 U. S., at 313). Flores expressly stated that the regulation
did not implicate the core liberty interest in avoiding physical confinement.
Id., at 302 ("The `freedom from physical restraint' . . . is not at issue in
this case").

eral legislation depriving an entire class of aliens of libertyduring removal proceedings. Flores did not disturb established standards that detention of an adult must be justifiedin each individual instance.

IV
This case is not about the National Government's undis-puted power to detain aliens in order to avoid flight or prevent danger to the community. The issue is whether thatpower may be exercised by detaining a still lawful permanent resident alien when there is no reason for it and no wayto challenge it. The Court's holding that the Due Process
Clause allows this under a blanket rule is devoid of evenostensible justification in fact and at odds with the settled
standard of liberty. I respectfully dissent.

Justice Breyer, concurring in part and dissenting inpart.

I agree with the majority that the courts have jurisdiction,and I join Part I of its opinion. If I believed (as the majority
apparently believes, see ante, at 513-514, and n. 3) that Kimhad conceded that he is deportable, then I would conclude
that the Government could detain him without bail for thefew weeks ordinarily necessary for formal entry of a removal
order. Brief for Petitioners 39-40; see ante, at 528-531.Time limits of the kind set forth in Zadvydas v. Davis, 533
U. S. 678 (2001), should govern these and longer periods ofdetention, for an alien's concession that he is deportable

30 Indeed, the passages the Court quotes from Flores did not concern
the regulation's constitutionality at all, but rather its validity as an implementation of the authorizing statute. Id., at 313 ("Respondents also contend that the INS regulation violates the statute because it relies upon a
`blanket' presumption"). Flores clearly separated its analysis of the regulation under the Due Process Clause from its analysis of the regulation
under the statute. See id., at 300; see also id., at 318-319 (O'Connor, J.,
concurring) (pointing out the substantive due process analysis at id., at
301-306, and the procedural due process analysis at id., at 306-309).

577Cite as: 538 U. S. 510 (2003)
Opinion of Breyer, J.
seems to me the rough equivalent of the entry of an order
of removal. See id., at 699-701 (reading the statute, under
constitutional compulsion, as commonly imposing a presumption of a 6-month "reasonable" time limit for post-removalorder detention).

This case, however, is not one in which an alien concedes
deportability. As Justice Souter points out, Kim argues
to the contrary. See ante, at 541-542 (opinion concurring in
part and dissenting in part). Kim claims that his earlier
convictions were neither for an " `aggravated felony' " nor for
two crimes of " `moral turpitude.' " Brief for Respondent 3,
11-12, 31-32, and n. 29. And given shifting lower court
views on such matters, I cannot say that his arguments
are insubstantial or interposed solely for purposes of delay.
See, e. g., United States v. Corona-Sanchez, 291 F. 3d 1201,
1213 (CA9 2002) (petty theft with a prior not an "aggravated
felony"). Compare Omagah v. Ashcroft, 288 F. 3d 254, 259
(CA5 2002) (" `Moral turpitude refers generally to conduct
that shocks the public conscience as being inherently base,
vile, or depraved' "), with Guarneri v. Kessler, 98 F. 2d 580,
580-581 (CA5 1938) ("Moral turpitude" involves " `[a]nything
done contrary to justice, honesty, principle or good morals' "),
and Quilodran-Brau v. Holland, 232 F. 2d 183, 184 (CA3
1956) ("The borderline of `moral turpitude' is not an easy one
to locate").

That being so--as long as Kim's legal arguments are neither insubstantial nor interposed solely for purposes of
delay--then the immigration statutes, interpreted in light of
the Constitution, permit Kim (if neither dangerous nor a
flight risk) to obtain bail. For one thing, Kim's constitutional claims to bail in these circumstances are strong. See
ante, at 548-552, 557-558 (Souter, J., concurring in part and
dissenting in part). Indeed, they are strong enough to require us to "ascertain whether a construction of the statute
is fairly possible by which the [constitutional] question may

be avoided." Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 62 (1932); ac-cord,

Zadvydas, supra, at 689.
For another, the relevant statutes literally say nothingabout an individual who, armed with a strong argument

against deportability, might, or might not, fall within theirterms. Title 8 U. S. C. $ 1226(c) tells the Attorney General
to "take into custody any alien who . . . is deportable" (emphasis added), not one who may, or may not, fall into thatcategory. Indeed, the Government now permits such an

alien to obtain bail if his argument against deportability issignificantly

stronger than substantial, i. e., strong enough to
make it "substantially unlikely" that the Government will
win. Matter of Joseph, 22 I. & N. Dec. 799 (BIA 1999).
Cf. 8 CFR $ 3.19(h)(2)(ii) (2002).

Finally, bail standards drawn from the criminal justice
system are available to fill this statutory gap. Federal law
makes bail available to a criminal defendant after conviction
and pending appeal provided (1) the appeal is "not for the
purpose of delay," (2) the appeal "raises a substantial question of law or fact," and (3) the defendant shows by "clear
and convincing evidence" that, if released, he "is not likely
to flee or pose a danger to the safety" of the community. 18
U. S. C. $ 3143(b). These standards give considerable weight
to any special governmental interest in detention (e. g.,
process-related concerns or class-related flight risks, see
ante, at 528). The standards are more protective of a detained alien's liberty interest than those currently administered in the Immigration and Naturalization Service's Joseph
hearings. And they have proved workable in practice in the
criminal justice system. Nothing in the statute forbids
their use when $ 1226(c) deportability is in doubt.

I would interpret the (silent) statute as imposing these
bail standards. Cf. Zadvydas, supra, at 698; United States
v. Witkovich, 353 U. S. 194, 201-202 (1957); Kent v. Dulles,
357 U. S. 116, 129 (1958). So interpreted, the statute would
require the Government to permit a detained alien to seek

Opinion of Breyer, J.
an individualized assessment of flight risk and dangerousnessas long as the alien's claim that he is not deportable is (1)

not interposed solely for purposes of delay and (2) raises aquestion of "law or fact" that is not insubstantial. And that
interpretation, in my view, is consistent with what the Con-stitution demands. I would remand this case to the Ninth
Circuit to determine whether Kim has raised such a claim.With respect, I dissent from the Court's contrary
disposition.

ROELL et al. v. WITHROW
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 02-69. Argued February 26, 2003--Decided April 29, 2003
The Federal Magistrate Act of 1979 (Act) empowers full-time magistrate

judges to conduct "any or all proceedings in a jury or nonjury civil
matter and order the entry of judgment in the case," as long as they
are "specially designated . . . by the district court" and acting with "the
consent of the parties." 28 U. S. C. $ 636(c)(1). Respondent Withrow,
a state prisoner, brought an action under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 against members of the prison's medical staff, petitioners Roell, Garibay, and Reagan,
alleging that they had deliberately disregarded his medical needs in
violation of the Eighth Amendment. During a preliminary hearing, the
Magistrate Judge told Withrow that he could choose to have her rather
than the District Judge preside over the entire case. Withrow agreed
orally and later in writing, but the petitioners did not at that point give
their consent. Without waiting for their decision, the District Judge
referred the case to the Magistrate Judge for final disposition, but with
the caveat that all petitioners would have an opportunity to consent to
her jurisdiction, and that the referral order would be vacated if any of
them did not consent. Only Reagan gave written consent to the referral; Roell and Garibay said nothing about the referral. The case nevertheless proceeded in front of the Magistrate Judge, all the way to a jury
verdict and judgment for the petitioners. Roell and Garibay voluntarily participated in the entire course of proceedings and voiced no objection when, at several points, the Magistrate Judge made it clear that
she believed they had consented. When Withrow appealed, the Fifth
Circuit sua sponte remanded the case to the District Court to determine
whether the parties had consented to proceed before the Magistrate
Judge. Only then did Roell and Garibay file a formal letter of consent
stating that they consented to all of the prior proceedings before the
Magistrate Judge. The District Court referred the Fifth Circuit's enquiry to that same Magistrate Judge, who reported that by their actions
Roell and Garibay clearly implied their consent to her jurisdiction, but
ruled that she had lacked jurisdiction because, under Circuit precedent,
such consent had to be expressly given. The District Court adopted
the report and recommendation. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding
that, under $ 636(c)(1), lack of consent and defects in the referral order
are nonwaivable jurisdictional errors, that $ 636(c) consent must be ex538US2 Unit: $U48 [10-27-04 13:22:50] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Syllabus
press, and that petitioners' postjudgment consent was inadequate
under the Act.

Held: Consent to a magistrate judge's designation can be inferred from a

party's conduct during litigation. Roell's and Garibay's general appearances before the Magistrate Judge, after they had been told of their
right to be tried by a district judge, supply the consent necessary for
the Magistrate Judge's "civil jurisdiction" under $ 636(c)(1). It is true
that $ 636(c)(2) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 73(b), which establish the procedures for a $ 636(c)(1) referral, envision advance, written
consent communicated to the clerk. This procedure is by no means just
advisory, and district courts are bound to adhere strictly to it. But the
text and structure of $ 636(c) as a whole indicate that a defect in the
referral under $ 636(c)(2) does not eliminate that magistrate judge's
"civil jurisdiction" under $ 636(c)(1) as long as the parties have in fact
voluntarily consented. So far as concerns full-time magistrate judges,

$ 636(c)(1), which is the font of magistrate judge authority, speaks only
of "the consent of the parties," without qualification as to form, and

$ 636(c)(3) similarly provides that "[t]he consent of the parties allows" a
full-time magistrate judge to enter a final, appealable judgment of the
district court. These unadorned references to the "consent of the parties" contrast with the language in $ 636(c)(1) covering referral to certain part-time magistrate judges, which requires not only that the parties consent, but that they do so by "specific written request." In
addition, there is a good pragmatic reason to think that Congress intended to permit implied consent. In giving magistrate judges casedispositive civil authority, Congress hoped to relieve the district courts'
caseload while still preserving every litigant's right to insist on trial
before an Article III district judge. Strict insistence on the express
consent requirement embodied in $ 636(c)(2) would minimize any risk to
the latter objective, but it would create an even greater risk to the
former one: the risk of a full and complicated trial wasted at the option
of an undeserving and possibly opportunistic litigant. Here, Withrow
gave express, written consent; he thus received the protection intended
by the statute and deserves no boon from the other side's failure. Had
the outcome of the case been different, the shoe might be on the other
foot; insistence on the bright line would let parties in Roell's and Garibay's position hedge their bets, keeping a poker face to conceal their
failure to file the form, and then sandbagging the other side when the
judgment turned out not to their liking. The preferable rule, which
does better by the mix of congressional objectives, is to infer consent from a litigant's general appearance before the magistrate judge,
after having been told of his right to be tried by a district judge.

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Federal Magistrate Act of 1979 (Federal MagistrateAct or Act) expanded the power of magistrate judges by authorizing them to conduct "any or all proceedings in a juryor nonjury civil matter and order the entry of judgment in
the case," as long as they are "specially designated . . . bythe district court" and are acting "[u]pon the consent of the
parties." 28 U. S. C. $ 636(c)(1). The question is whetherconsent can be inferred from a party's conduct during litigation, and we hold that it can be.

Respondent Jon Michael Withrow is a Texas state prisonerwho brought an action under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C.

$ 1983, against members of the prison's medical staff, peti-tioners Joseph Roell, Petra Garibay, and James Reagan, alleging that they had deliberately disregarded his medicalneeds in violation of the Eighth Amendment. See

Estelle v.Gamble, 429 U. S. 97 (1976). During a preliminary hearing

before a Magistrate Judge to determine whether the suitcould proceed in forma pauperis, see 28 U. S. C. $ 1915, the
Magistrate Judge told Withrow that he could choose to have

Opinion of the Court
her rather than the District Judge preside over the entire
case. App. 10-11. Withrow agreed orally, id., at 11, and
later in writing, App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a. A lawyer from
the Texas attorney general's office who attended the hearing,
but was not permanently assigned to Withrow's case, indicated that she would have to "talk to the attorneys who have
been assigned the case to see if [the petitioners] will execute
consent forms." App. 11.

Without waiting for the petitioners' decision, the District
Judge referred the case to the Magistrate Judge for final
disposition, but with the caveat that "all defendants [would]
be given an opportunity to consent to the jurisdiction of the
magistrate judge," and that the referral order would be vacated if any of the defendants did not consent. App. to Pet.
for Cert. 21a. The Clerk of Court sent the referral order to
the petitioners along with a summons directing them to include "[i]n their answer or in a separate pleading . . . a statement that `All defendants consent to the jurisdiction of a
United States Magistrate Judge' or `All defendants do not
consent to the jurisdiction of a United States Magistrate
Judge.' " App. 13. The summons advised them that "[t]he
court shall not be told which parties do not consent." Ibid.
Only Reagan, who was represented by private counsel, gave
written consent to the referral; Roell and Garibay, who were
represented by an assistant in the attorney general's office,
filed answers but said nothing about the referral. App. to
Pet. for Cert. 17a.

The case nevertheless proceeded in front of the Magistrate
Judge, all the way to a jury verdict and judgment for the
petitioners. When Withrow appealed, the Court of Appeals
sua sponte remanded the case to the District Court to "determine whether the parties consented to proceed before the
magistrate judge and, if so, whether the consents were oral
or written." Id., at 13a. It was only then that Roell and
Garibay filed a formal letter of consent with the District

Court, stating that "they consented to all proceedings beforethis date before the United States Magistrate Judge, including disposition of their motion for summary judgment andtrial."

Id., at 22a.
The District Court nonetheless referred the Court of Ap-peals's enquiry to the same Magistrate Judge who had conducted the trial, who reported that "by their actions [Roell
and Garibay] clearly implied their consent to the jurisdictionof a magistrate."

Id., at 19a. She was surely correct, for
the record shows that Roell and Garibay voluntarily partici-pated in the entire course of proceedings before the Magistrate Judge, and voiced no objection when, at several points,the Magistrate Judge made it clear that she believed they
had consented.1 The Magistrate Judge observed, however,that under the Circuit's precedent "consent cannot be implied
by the conduct of the parties," id., at 18a, and she accord-ingly concluded that the failure of Roell and Garibay to give
express consent before sending their postjudgment letter to
the District Court meant that she had lacked jurisdiction to
hear the case, ibid. The District Court adopted the report
and recommendation over the petitioners' objection. Id.,
at 14a-15a.

The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court, agreeing that "[w]hen, pursuant to $ 636(c)(1), the magistrate judge

1 On at least three different occasions, counsel for Roell and Garibay was
present and stood silent when the Magistrate Judge stated that they had
consented to her authority. First, in a status teleconference involving the
addition of a new defendant, Danny Knutson, who later settled with Withrow and was dropped from the suit, the Magistrate Judge stated that
"all of the other parties have consented to my jurisdiction." App. 18.
Petitioners later filed a motion for summary judgment, which the Magistrate Judge denied, noting in her order that "this case was referred to the
undersigned to conduct all further proceedings, including entry of final
judgment, in accordance with 28 U. S. C. $ 636(c)(1)." App. to Pet. for
Cert. 26a. And finally, during jury selection, the Magistrate Judge told
the panel that both sides had consented to her jurisdiction to hear the
case. Id., at 27a.

consent did not satisfy $ 636(c)(1)'s consent requirement.

The Federal Magistrate Act provides that "[u]pon the con-sent of the parties, a full-time United States magistrate

judge . . . may conduct any or all proceedings in a jury ornonjury civil matter and order the entry of judgment in the
case, when specially designated to exercise such jurisdictionby the district court." 28 U. S. C. $ 636(c)(1). Unlike nonconsensual referrals of pretrial but case-dispositive mattersunder $ 636(b)(1), which leave the district court free to do as
it sees fit with the magistrate judge's recommendations, a$ 636(c)(1) referral gives the magistrate judge full authority
over dispositive motions, conduct of trial, and entry of finaljudgment, all without district court review. A judgment entered by "a magistrate judge designated to exercise civil ju-risdiction under [$ 636(c)(1)]" is to be treated as a final judgment of the district court, appealable "in the same manneras an appeal from any other judgment of a district court."

$ 636(c)(3).2

2 Prior to the 1996 amendments to the Act, see Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-317, $ 207(1)(B), 110 Stat. 3850, parties could
also elect to appeal to "a judge of the district court in the same manner
as on an appeal from a judgment of the district court to a court of appeals."
28 U. S. C. $ 636(c)(4) (1994 ed.) (repealed 1996). If the latter course was
pursued, the court of appeals could grant leave to appeal the district
court's judgment. $ 636(c)(5) (same). In all events, whether the initial
appeal was to the court of appeals under $ 636(c)(3) or to the district court
under $ 636(c)(4), the parties retained the right to seek ultimate review
from this Court. $ 636(c)(5) (same).

586 ROELL v. WITHROW

Opinion of the Court
Section 636(c)(2) establishes the procedures for a $ 636(c)(1)referral. "If a magistrate judge is designated to exercise

civil jurisdiction under [$ 636(c)(1)], the clerk of court shall,at the time the action is filed, notify the parties of the availability of a magistrate judge to exercise such jurisdiction."$ 636(c)(2). Within the time required by local rule, "[t]he decision of the parties shall be communicated to the clerk ofcourt."

Ibid. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 73(b) speci-fies that the parties' election of a magistrate judge shall be

memorialized in "a joint form of consent or separate formsof consent setting forth such election," see Fed. Rules Civ.
Proc. Form 34, and that neither the magistrate nor the dis-trict judge "shall . . . be informed of a party's response to
the clerk's notification, unless all parties have consented tothe referral of the matter to a magistrate judge." The procedure created by 28 U. S. C. $ 636(c)(2) and Rule 73(b) thusenvisions advance, written consent communicated to the
clerk, the point being to preserve the confidentiality of a par-ty's choice, in the interest of protecting an objecting party
against any possible prejudice at the magistrate judge'shands later on. See also $ 636(c)(2) ("Rules of court for the
reference of civil matters to magistrate judges shall includeprocedures to protect the voluntariness of the parties'
consent").Here, of course, $ 636(c)(2) was honored in the breach, by a
referral before Roell and Garibay gave their express consent,without any statement from them, written or oral, until after
judgment. App. to Pet. for Cert. 19a. Nonetheless, Roelland Garibay "clearly implied their consent" by their decision
to appear before the Magistrate Judge, without expressingany reservation, after being notified of their right to refuse
and after being told that she intended to exercise case-dispositive authority. Ibid.

Opinion of the Court
consent so shown can count as conferring "civil jurisdiction"under $ 636(c)(1), or whether adherence to the letter of

$ 636(c)(2) is an absolute demand.So far as it concerns full-time magistrate judges,

4 the font

of a magistrate judge's authority, $ 636(c)(1), speaks only of"the consent of the parties," without qualification as to form,

and $ 636(c)(3) similarly provides that "[t]he consent of theparties allows" a full-time magistrate judge to enter a final,
appealable judgment of the district court. These unadornedreferences to "consent of the parties" contrast with the language in $ 636(c)(1) covering referral to certain part-timemagistrate judges, which requires not only that the parties
consent, but that they do so by "specific written request."Cf. also 18 U. S. C. $ 3401(b) (allowing magistrate judges to
preside over misdemeanor trials only if the defendant "ex-pressly consents . . . in writing or orally on the record"). A
distinction is thus being made between consent simple, andconsent expressed in a "specific written request." And
although the specific referral procedures in 28 U. S. C.$ 636(c)(2) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 73(b) are by
no means just advisory, the text and structure of the sectionas a whole suggest that a defect in the referral to a full-time
magistrate judge under $ 636(c)(2) does not eliminate thatmagistrate judge's "civil jurisdiction" under $ 636(c)(1) so
long as the parties have in fact voluntarily consented. SeeKing v. Ionization Int'l, Inc., 825 F. 2d 1180, 1185 (CA7 1987)
(noting that the Act "does not require a specific form . . .of consent").

act done with the intention of appearing and submitting to the court's
jurisdiction' " (quoting 4 Am. Jur. 2d, Appearance $ 1, p. 620 (1995))).

4 The parties do not dispute that the Magistrate Judge who presided

over the trial was a full-time Magistrate Judge.

5 The textual evidence cited by the dissent is far from conclusive. The

dissent focuses on the fact that $ 636(c)(1) allows a magistrate judge to
exercise authority only "[u]pon" the parties' consent, and it concludes that
this temporal connotation forecloses accepting implied consent. But the

588 ROELL v. WITHROW

Opinion of the Court
These textual clues are complemented by a good pragmatic
reason to think that Congress intended to permit implied
consent. In giving magistrate judges case-dispositive civil
authority, Congress hoped to relieve the district courts'
"mounting queue of civil cases" and thereby "improve access
to the courts for all groups." S. Rep. No. 96-74, p. 4 (1979);
see H. R. Rep. No. 96-287, p. 2 (1979) (The Act's main object
was to create "a supplementary judicial power designed to
meet the ebb and flow of the demands made on the Federal
judiciary"). At the same time, though, Congress meant to
preserve a litigant's right to insist on trial before an Article
III district judge insulated from interference with his obligation to ignore everything but the merits of a case. See
Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n v. Schor, 478 U. S.
833, 848 (1986) (Article III protects litigants' " `right to have
claims decided before judges who are free from potential

timing of consent is a different matter from the manner of its expression,
and it is perfectly in keeping with the sequence of events envisioned by

$ 636(c)(1) to infer consent from a litigant's initial act of appearing before the magistrate judge and submitting to her jurisdiction, instead of
insisting on trial before a district judge. An "appearance" being commonly understood as "[t]he first act of the defendant in court," J. Ballentine, Law Dictionary with Pronunciations 91 (2d ed. 1948), any subsequent
proceedings by the court will occur "[u]pon the consent of the parties,"

$ 636(c)(1).

Furthermore, it is hardly true, contrary to the dissent's claim, post, at
594 (opinion of Thomas, J.), that $ 636(c)(2) and Rule 73(b) are pointless if
implied consent is permitted under $ 636(c)(1). Certainly, notification of
the right to refuse the magistrate judge is a prerequisite to any inference
of consent, so that aspect of $ 636(c)(2)'s protection is preserved. And
litigants may undoubtedly insist that they be able to communicate their
decision on the referral to the clerk, in order to guard against the risk of
reprisals at the hands of either judge. The only question is whether a
litigant who forgoes that procedural opportunity, but still voluntarily gives
his consent through a general appearance before the magistrate judge, is
still subject to the magistrate judge's "civil jurisdiction," and we think
that the language of $ 636(c)(1) indicates that he is.

Opinion of the Court
domination by other branches of government' " (quoting
United States v. Will, 449 U. S. 200, 218 (1980))). It was
thus concern about the possibility of coercive referrals thatprompted Congress to make it clear that "the voluntary consent of the parties is required before a civil action may be
referred to a magistrate for a final decision." S. Conf. Rep.
No. 96-322, p. 7 (1979); see also S. Rep. No. 96-74, at 5 ("The
bill clearly requires the voluntary consent of the parties as
a prerequisite to a magistrate's exercise of the new jurisdiction. The committee firmly believes that no pressure, tacit
or expressed, should be applied to the litigants to induce
them to consent to trial before the magistrates"); H. R. Rep.
No. 96-287, at 2 (The Act "creates a vehicle by which litigants can consent, freely and voluntarily, to a less formal,
more rapid, and less expensive means of resolving their
civil controversies").6

When, as here, a party has signaled consent to the magistrate judge's authority through actions rather than words,
the question is what outcome does better by the mix of congressional objectives. On the one hand, the virtue of strict
insistence on the express consent requirement embodied in

$ 636(c)(2) is simply the value of any bright line: here, absolutely minimal risk of compromising the right to an Article

6 Originally, the third sentence of $ 636(c)(2) provided that once the decision of the parties was communicated to the clerk, "neither the district
judge nor the magistrate shall attempt to persuade or induce any party to
consent to reference of any civil matter to a magistrate." 93 Stat. 643.
In the 1990 amendments to the Act, Congress amended $ 636(c)(2) to provide that even after the parties' decision is made, "either the district court
judge or the magistrate may again advise the parties of the availability of
the magistrate, but in so doing, shall also advise the parties that they
are free to withhold consent without adverse substantive consequences."
Judicial Improvements Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101-650, $ 308, 104 Stat. 5112.
The change reflected Congress's diminishing concern that communication
between the judge and the parties would lead to coercive referrals. See
H. R. Rep. No. 101-734, p. 27 (1990).

Opinion of the Court
III judge. But there is another risk, and insisting on a
bright line would raise it: the risk of a full and complicated
trial wasted at the option of an undeserving and possibly
opportunistic litigant. This risk is right in front of us in
this case. Withrow consented orally and in writing to the
Magistrate Judge's authority following notice of his right to
elect trial by an Article III district judge; he received the
protection intended by the statute, and deserves no boon
from the other side's failure to cross the bright line. In fact,
there is even more to Withrow's unworthiness, since under
the local rules of the District Court, it was Withrow's unmet
responsibility as plaintiff to get the consent of all parties and
file the completed consent form with the clerk. See Gen.
Order No. 80-5, Art. III(B)(2) (SD Tex., June 16, 1980), p. 5,
App. to Brief in Opposition 7a. In another case, of course,
the shoe might be on the other foot; insisting on the bright
line would allow parties in Roell's and Garibay's position to
sit back without a word about their failure to file the form,
with a right to vacate any judgment that turned out not to
their liking.

The bright line is not worth the downside. We think the
better rule is to accept implied consent where, as here, the
litigant or counsel was made aware of the need for consent
and the right to refuse it, and still voluntarily appeared to
try the case before the Magistrate Judge. Inferring consent
in these circumstances thus checks the risk of gamesmanship
by depriving parties of the luxury of waiting for the outcome
before denying the magistrate judge's authority. Judicial
efficiency is served; the Article III right is substantially honored. See Schor, supra, at 849-850 (finding that the litigant
"effective[ly] waive[d]" his right to an Article III court by
deciding "to seek relief before the [Commodity Futures
Trading Commission] rather than in the federal courts");

The provision that this Court must interpret reads: "Uponthe consent of the parties, a . . . magistrate judge . . . may

7 We doubt that this interpretation runs a serious risk of "spawn[ing] a
second litigation of significant dimension." Buckhannon Board & Care
Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human Resources, 532
U. S. 598, 609 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). In the first
place, implied consent will be the exception, not the rule, since, as we
discuss above, district courts remain bound by the procedural requirements of $ 636(c)(2) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 73(b). See supra,
at 586, 587-588, n. 5. The dissent surmises, post, at 596, that our position
raises "ambiguities" as to whether an inference of consent will be supported in a particular case, but we think this concern is greatly exaggerated: as long as parties are notified of the availability of a district judge
as required by $ 636(c)(2) and Rule 73(b), a litigant's general appearance
before the magistrate judge will usually indicate the necessary consent.
In all events, whatever risk of "second[ary] litigation" may exist under an
implied consent rule pales in comparison to the inefficiency and unfairness
of requiring relitigation of the entire case in circumstances like these.

8 Because we conclude that Roell and Garibay impliedly consented to

the Magistrate Judge's authority, we need not address whether express
postjudgment consent would be sufficient in a case where there was no
prior consent, either express or implied. We also have no opportunity to
decide whether the Court of Appeals was correct that lack of consent is a
"jurisdictional defect" that can be raised for the first time on appeal.

conduct any or all proceedings in a jury or nonjury civil matter and order the entry of judgment." 28 U. S. C. $ 636(c)(1).
The majority holds that no express consent need be given
prior to the commencement of proceedings before the magistrate judge. Rather, consent can be implied "where . . . the
litigant or counsel was made aware of the need for consent
and the right to refuse it, and still voluntarily appeared to
try the case before the Magistrate Judge." Ante, at 590.
In my view, this interpretation of $ 636(c)(1) is contrary to its
text, fails to respect the statutory scheme, and raises serious
constitutional concerns. Furthermore, I believe that a lack
of proper consent is a jurisdictional defect and, therefore, a
court of appeals reviewing a judgment entered by a magistrate judge pursuant to $ 636(c) may inquire sua sponte into
the consent's validity.

I

A

There are two prongs to the majority's holding: (1) parties
can give their consent during the actual proceedings conducted by a magistrate judge, and (2) such consent need not
be explicit, but rather may be inferred from the parties' conduct. Neither of these conclusions is correct.

As already noted, a magistrate judge may carry out certain functions of a district court only "[u]pon the consent of
the parties." Congress' use of the word "upon" suggests
that the necessary consent must precede the magistrate
judge's exercise of his authority. "Upon" is defined as
"immediately or very soon after." The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1570 (1966). Thus, under
the plain language of the statute, consent is a precondition
to the magistrate judge's exercise of case-dispositive power;
without it, a magistrate judge cannot preside over a trial or
enter judgment. Pacemaker Diagnostic Clinic of Am., Inc.
v. Instromedix, Inc., 725 F. 2d 537, 540 (CA9 1984) (en banc)

Thomas, J., dissenting
The word "upon" is used to mean "thereafter" in other
parts of the statute as well. For example, $ 636(h) provides
that a "magistrate judge who has retired may, upon the consent of the chief judge of the district involved, be recalled to
serve as a magistrate judge . . . ." (Emphasis added.)
Clearly, a retired magistrate judge cannot return to his
former post before the chief judge consents. Similarly,

$ 636(e)(3) uses the word "upon" to mean "subsequent to."
That subsection grants magistrate judges the power to hold
parties before them in contempt, but conditions the imposition of contempt sanctions "upon notice and hearing under
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. " (Emphasis
added.) That is, a party cannot be held in contempt without
first being given notice and a hearing. Because under the
normal rules of statutory construction the Court "assumes
that identical words used in different parts of the same
act are intended to have the same meaning," Sorenson v.
Secretary of Treasury, 475 U. S. 851, 860 (1986) (citations
and internal quotation marks omitted), the word "upon" in

$ 636(c)(1) must mean "thereafter," just as it does in $$ 636(h)
and (e)(3). By allowing consent to be "inferred from a party's conduct during litigation," ante, at 582 (emphasis added),
the majority disregards the clear meaning of the word
"upon."

Similarly, the conclusion that implied, rather than express,
consent suffices is not borne out by either $ 636(c)(1) itself or
the statutory scheme as a whole. The majority is, of course,
correct that the relevant clause of $ 636(c)(1) speaks only of
"consent," while the clause addressing part-time magistrate
judges requires that consent be communicated by a "specific
written request." Ante, at 587 (internal quotation marks
omitted). But this premise does not command the conclusion the majority draws. Both clauses require express consent, with the latter mandating a specific form of express
consent--a written request.

594 ROELL v. WITHROW

Thomas, J., dissenting
This reading is most consistent with the statutory scheme.Despite the majority's concession that $ 636(c)(2) and Federal

Rule of Civil Procedure 73 "are by no means just advisory,"
ante, at 587, the majority fails to give them any weight.
Section 636(c)(2) requires the clerk of the district court tonotify the parties of the availability of a magistrate "at the

time the action is filed," after which the "decision of the parties [whether to consent] shall be communicated to the clerkof court." The fact that the parties' decision must be communicated to the clerk soon after the filing of the action indi-cates that the consent envisioned by the statute must be
given affirmatively and expressly. Indeed, a party would
find it quite difficult to "communicat[e]" the necessary consent to the clerk of the court through actions undertaken
"during litigation," ante, at 582 (emphasis added). The majority's view suggests that the clerk of the court must monitor the parties' behavior in the magistrate judge's courtroom
and determine, at some point not specified by the majority,
that the parties' actions have ripened into consent. That is
not a reasonable interpretation. Accordingly, I would hold
that appearance before a magistrate judge without objection
cannot be deemed "consent" within the meaning of this statutory scheme.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 73 fortifies this reading.
The Rule mirrors the provisions of $ 636(c)(2) for informing
parties of their option to proceed before a magistrate judge
and of their obligation to file a consent form if they chose to
do so. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 73(b) ("When a magistrate judge
has been designated to exercise civil trial jurisdiction, the
clerk shall give written notice to the parties of their opportunity to consent," and if the parties agree, "they shall execute
and file a joint form of consent or separate forms of consent
. . ." (emphasis added)).

Read together, the foregoing provisions indicate that parties must expressly communicate their consent to the magistrate judge's exercise of jurisdiction over their case and must

do so before litigation--or at the very least before a magis-trate judge enters a binding judgment.

B
While I agree with the majority's view that $ 636(c)(1) was"meant to preserve a litigant's right to insist on trial before

an Article III district judge," ante, at 588, and to prevent"coercive referrals," ante, at 589, the majority's construction
of this provision does not follow the Court's "settled policyto avoid an interpretation of a federal statute that engenders
constitutional issues." Gomez v. United States, 490 U. S.858, 864 (1989).

"A critical limitation on [the] expanded jurisdiction [ofmag istrate judges] is consent. "

Id., at 870. Reading$ 636(c)(1) to require express consent not only is more consistent with the text of the statute, but also ensures that theparties knowingly and voluntarily waive their right to an
Article III judge. A party's express consent is a clear andunambiguous indication that the party had sufficient notice
it was freely waiving its right. Accordingly, I would choosethis interpretation over the majority's view that implied consent suffices to give a magistrate judge dispositive authorityover a case. Cf. Aetna Ins. Co. v. Kennedy ex rel. Bogash,
301 U. S. 389, 393 (1937) (holding that the parties, by theirrequest for directed verdicts, did not waive their right to
trial by jury, and observing that "courts indulge every rea-sonable presumption against waiver");

Ohio Bell TelephoneCo. v. Public Util. Comm'n of Ohio, 301 U. S. 292, 307 (1937)

(holding that a telephone company did not waive its rightto have the value of its property determined upon evidence
presented in open proceedings by not opposing consolidationof two proceedings, and noting that "[w]e do not presume
acquiescence in the loss of fundamental rights").Moreover, the majority's test for determining whether a
party has given adequate implied consent--"where . . . thelitigant or counsel was made aware of the need for consent

and the right to refuse it, and still voluntarily appeared totry the case before the Magistrate Judge,"

ante, at 590--
is rife with ambiguities. How are the courts to determinewhether the litigant

or counsel "was made aware of the need
to consent and the right to refuse it"? Are courts requiredto search beyond the record and inquire into whether a clerk

of the court informed either a litigant or his counsel of the
litigant's rights and provided them with requisite forms tosign? Can courts rely, if applicable, on the parties' participation in other unrelated proceedings before a magistratejudge? In addition, the majority's view of what constitutes
"voluntariness" in this context is not at all clear as it seems
to depend, at least in part, on establishing a litigant's or
counsel's awareness of the litigant's rights.

Although the majority brushes aside the prudential implications of its reading, ante, at 591, n. 7 ("We doubt that this
interpretation runs a serious risk of `spawn[ing] a second
litigation of significant dimension.' Buckhannon Board &
Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and
Human Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 609 (2001)"), it is hardly a
novel proposition that a bright-line rule would be easier to
administer. And, it would certainly be so in adjudicating
the validity of consent under this statute. If express consent is required, courts will not have to study the record of
a proceeding on a case-by-case basis, searching for patterns
in the parties' behavior that would provide sufficient indicia
of voluntariness to satisfy this newly minted, but vague, test
for consent. A bright-line rule brings clarity and predictability, and, in light of the constitutional implications of this
case, these values should not be discounted.

Given the uncertainties surrounding the determination of
the validity of implied consent, it is not surprising that the
majority does not even claim that the requirements of Article III have been satisfied in this case. Rather, all the majority can muster is that "the Article III right is substantially honored." Ante, at 590 (emphasis added). However,

538US2 Unit: $U48 [10-27-04 13:22:50] PAGES PGT: OPLG

597Cite as: 538 U. S. 580 (2003)
Thomas, J., dissenting
litigants' rights under Article III are either protected or
they are not. As the majority suggests, its reading does not
safeguard these rights. Indeed, the only protection offered
by the majority is its hope that the "procedural requirements
of $ 636(c)(2) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 73(b)" will
be complied with. Ante, at 591, n. 7. The majority offers
no credible solution for circumstances, such as the ones here,
where these rules were not followed.

Even apart from the plain text of the statute and the canon
of constitutional avoidance, concerns about fairness--to
which the majority alludes above, see ante, at 588-590--
weigh in favor of express consent. According to the majority, the respondent is a "possibly opportunistic litigant," who
"deserves no boon from the other side's failure to cross the
bright line," ante, at 590. The record, however, provides no
evidence that respondent, proceeding pro se below, manipulated the system. Moreover, "the other side" is the State of
Texas, a repeat player, represented by its own counsel, and
no doubt familiar with the rules of the local federal courts.
Finally, it was not respondent who raised the issue of consent, but the Court of Appeals, which considered the question sua sponte.

II

Because the parties here did not expressly consent to the
proceeding before the Magistrate Judge, I next consider
whether the lack of such consent destroys jurisdiction of a
court of appeals reviewing a magistrate judge's judgment.
I believe it does, and thus, a court of appeals may--and indeed must--raise it sua sponte.

A court of appeals exercises jurisdiction over a magistrate
judge's final order pursuant to $ 636(c)(3), which provides:

"Upon entry of judgment in any case referred under
paragraph (1) of this subsection, an aggrieved party may
appeal directly to the appropriate United States court
of appeals from the judgment of the magistrate judge in

538US2 Unit: $U48 [10-27-04 13:22:50] PAGES PGT: OPLG
598 ROELL v. WITHROW

Thomas, J., dissenting
the same manner as an appeal from any other judgmentof a district court. The consent of the parties allows a

magistrate judge designated to exercise civil jurisdic-tion under paragraph (1) of this subsection to direct the
entry of a judgment of the district court in accordancewith the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure." (Emphasis added.)
Under $ 636(c)(3), appellate jurisdiction over final judgmentsentered by a magistrate judge depends on whether the requirements of $ 636(c)(1), including consent, are satisfied.Absence of consent means absence of a "judgment," which, in
turn, means absence of appellate jurisdiction. Thus, under$ 636, the necessary precondition for a court of appeals' jurisdiction over a magistrate judge's order is the parties' consentto proceed before the magistrate judge. Because valid consent is a jurisdictional prerequisite for appellate jurisdiction,and, hence, an integral part of the inquiry into the existence
of such jurisdiction, $ 636(c)(3) permits a court of appeals toexamine the validity of the consent to the magistrate judge's
authority sua sponte.The de facto officer doctrine is not to the contrary. That
doctrine "prevent[s] litigants from abiding the outcome of alawsuit and then overturning it if adverse upon a technicality
of which they were previously aware." Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U. S. 530, 535 (1962) (plurality opinion). Examplesof such "technicalities" are defects in the judge's appointment or designation. See, e. g., Ex parte Ward, 173 U. S.452, 456 (1899) ( judge improperly appointed during a Senate
recess); Wright v. United States, 158 U. S. 232, 238 (1895)(deputy marshal whose oath of office had not been properly
administered); McDowell v. United States, 159 U. S. 596, 601-602 (1895) ( judge whose designation to sit in a different district may have been improper under the statute); Ball v.United States, 140 U. S. 118, 128-129 (1891) ( judge sitting in
place of a deceased judge where designation permitted onlythe substitution for a disabled judge). The doctrine is, how538US2 Unit: $U48 [10-27-04 13:22:50] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Ayrshire Collieries Corp. v. United States, 331 U. S. 132(three-judge court); United States v. Emholt, 105 U. S. 414
(certificate of divided opinion)." Glidden, 370 U. S., at 535(plurality opinion). Additionally, "when the statute claimed
to restrict authority is not merely technical but embodies astrong policy concerning the proper administration of judicial
business, this Court has treated the alleged defect as `juris-dictional' and agreed to consider it on direct review even
though not raised at the earliest practicable opportunity."
Id., at 535-536. This is the case here--$ 636(c) "embodies astrong policy" of ensuring that litigants waive their rights to

an Article III judge knowingly and voluntarily. The re-quirement of consent is not a mere "technicality." Sections
636(c)(1), 636(c)(2), and 636(c)(3) reference consent explicitlyand require it as a precondition for the exercise of a magistrate judge's authority and of a court of appeals' review ofthe magistrate judge's judgment. The foregoing indicates
the importance of consent as a touchstone of this statutoryscheme. Thus, absence of consent is a jurisdictional defect
and a court of appeals must raise such defects sua sponte.

ILLINOIS ex rel. MADIGAN, ATTORNEY GENERAL

OF ILLINOIS v. TELEMARKETING ASSOCIATES,

INC., et al.

certiorari to the supreme court of illinois

No. 01-1806. Argued March 3, 2003--Decided May 5, 2003
Respondents, Illinois for-profit fundraising corporations and their owner

(collectively Telemarketers), were retained by VietNow National Headquarters, a charitable nonprofit corporation, to solicit donations to aid
Vietnam veterans. The contracts between those parties provided,
among other things, that Telemarketers would retain 85 percent of the
gross receipts from Illinois donors, leaving 15 percent for VietNow.
The Illinois Attorney General filed a complaint in state court, alleging,
inter alia, that Telemarketers represented to donors that a significant
amount of each dollar donated would be paid over to VietNow for specifically identified charitable endeavors, and that such representations
were knowingly deceptive and materially false, constituted a fraud, and
were made for Telemarketers' private pecuniary benefit. The trial
court granted Telemarketers' motion to dismiss the fraud claims
on First Amendment grounds. In affirming, the Illinois Appellate and
Supreme Courts placed heavy weight on Schaumburg v. Citizens for a
Better Environment, 444 U. S. 620, Secretary of State of Md. v. Joseph
H. Munson Co., 467 U. S. 947, and Riley v. National Federation of Blind
of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781. Those decisions held that certain regulations of charitable solicitation barring fees in excess of a prescribed level
effectively imposed prior restraints on fundraising, and were therefore
incompatible with the First Amendment. The state high court acknowledged that this case involved no such prophylactic proscription of
high-fee charitable solicitation. Instead, the court noted, the Attorney
General sought to enforce the State's generally applicable antifraud laws
against Telemarketers for specific instances of deliberate deception.
However, the Illinois Supreme Court said, Telemarketers' solicitation
statements were alleged to be false only because Telemarketers contracted for 85 percent of the gross receipts and failed to disclose this
information to donors. The court concluded that the Attorney General's complaint was, in essence, an attempt to regulate Telemarketers'
ability to engage in a protected activity based upon a percentage-rate
limitation--the same regulatory principle rejected in Schaumburg,
Munson, and Riley.

Syllabus
Held: Consistent with this Court's precedent and the First Amendment,

States may maintain fraud actions when fundraisers make false or misleading representations designed to deceive donors about how their
donations will be used. The Illinois Attorney General's allegations
against Telemarketers therefore state a claim for relief that can survive
a motion to dismiss. Pp. 611-624.

(a) The First Amendment protects the right to engage in charitable
solicitation, see, e. g., Schaumburg, 444 U. S., at 632, but does not shield
fraud, see, e. g., Donaldson v. Read Magazine, Inc., 333 U. S. 178, 190.
Like other forms of public deception, fraudulent charitable solicitation
is unprotected speech. See, e. g., Schneider v. State (Town of Irvington), 308 U. S. 147, 164. This Court has not previously addressed the
First Amendment's application to individual fraud actions of the kind at
issue here. It has, however, three times held unconstitutional prophylactic laws designed to combat fraud by imposing prior restraints on
solicitation when fundraising fees exceeded a specified reasonable
level. Pp. 611-617.

(b) In those cases, Schaumburg, Munson, and Riley, the Court took
care to leave a corridor open for fraud actions to guard the public
against false or misleading charitable solicitations. See, e. g., Schaumburg, 444 U. S., at 637. As those decisions recognized, there are differences critical to First Amendment concerns between fraud actions
trained on representations made in individual cases and statutes that
categorically ban solicitations when fundraising costs run high. Simply
labeling an action one for "fraud," of course, will not carry the day. Had
the State Attorney General's complaint charged fraud based solely on
the percentage of donations the fundraisers would retain, or their failure
to alert donors to fee arrangements at the start of each call, Riley would
support swift dismissal. Portions of the Attorney General's complaint
against Telemarketers were of this genre. But the complaint and annexed affidavits, in large part, alleged not simply what Telemarketers
failed to convey. They also described what Telemarketers misleadingly
represented. Taking into account the affidavits, and reading the complaint in the light most favorable to the Attorney General, that pleading
described misrepresentations this Court's precedent does not place
under the First Amendment's cover. First, the complaint asserted that
Telemarketers affirmatively represented that a significant amount of
each dollar donated would be paid over to VietNow to be used for specific charitable purposes while in fact Telemarketers knew that 15 cents
or less of each dollar would be available for those purposes. Second,
the complaint essentially alleged that the charitable solicitation was a
fac,ade: Although Telemarketers represented that donated funds would
go to VietNow's charitable purposes, the amount of funds paid over to

Syllabus

the charity was merely incidental to the fundraising effort, which was
made for Telemarketers' private pecuniary benefit. Fraud actions so
tailored, targeting misleading affirmative representations about how donations would be used, are unlike the prophylactic measures invalidated
in Schaumburg, Munson, and Riley: So long as the emphasis is on what
the fundraisers misleadingly convey, and not on percentage limitations
on solicitors' fees per se, fraud actions need not impermissibly chill protected speech. Pp. 617-619.

(c) The prohibitions invalidated in Schaumburg, Munson, and Riley
turned solely on whether high percentages of donated funds were spent
on fundraising. Their application did not depend on whether the fundraiser made fraudulent representations to potential donors. In contrast
to the prior restraints inspected in those cases, a properly tailored
fraud action targeting specific fraudulent representations employs no
" `[b]road prophylactic rul[e],' " Schaumburg, 444 U. S., at 637 (citation
omitted), lacking any "nexus . . . [to] the likelihood that the solicitation
is fraudulent," Riley, 487 U. S., at 793. Such an action thus falls on the
constitutional side of the line "between regulation aimed at fraud and
regulation aimed at something else in the hope that it would sweep
fraud in during the process." Munson, 467 U. S., at 969-970. The Attorney General's complaint has a solid core in allegations that home in
on Telemarketers' affirmative statements designed to mislead donors
regarding the use of their contributions. Of prime importance, to prove
a defendant liable for fraud under Illinois case law, the State must show
by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant knowingly made a
false representation of a material fact, that such representation was
made with the intent to mislead the listener, and that the representation
succeeded in doing so. In contrast to a prior restraint on solicitation,
or a regulation that imposes on fundraisers an uphill burden to prove
their conduct lawful, the State bears the full burden of proof in an individualized fraud action. Exacting proof requirements of this order, in
other contexts, have been held to provide sufficient breathing room for
protected speech. See, e. g., New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S.
254, 279-280. As an additional safeguard responsive to First Amendment concerns, an appellate court could independently review the trial
court's findings. Cf. Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States,
Inc., 466 U. S. 485, 498-511. What the First Amendment and this
Court's case law emphatically do not require, however, is a blanket exemption from fraud liability for a fundraiser who intentionally misleads
in calls for donations. While the percentage of fundraising proceeds
turned over to a charity is not an accurate measure of the amount of
funds used "for" a charitable purpose, Munson, 467 U. S., at 967, n. 16,
the gravamen of the fraud action in this case is not high costs or fees,

Syllabus
but particular representations made with intent to mislead. The Illinois Attorney General has not suggested that a charity must desist from
using donations for legitimate purposes such as information dissemination, advocacy, and the like. Rather, the Attorney General has alleged
that Telemarketers attracted donations by misleading potential donors
into believing that a substantial portion of their contributions would
fund specific programs or services, knowing full well that was not the
case. Such representations remain false or misleading, however legitimate the other purposes for which the funds are in fact used. The
Court does not agree with Telemarketers that the Attorney General's
fraud action is simply an end run around Riley's holding that fundraisers
may not be required, in every telephone solicitation, to state the percentage of receipts the fundraiser would retain. It is one thing to compel every fundraiser to disclose its fee arrangements at the start of
a telephone conversation, quite another to take fee arrangements into
account in assessing whether particular affirmative representations
designedly deceive the public. Pp. 619-623.

(d) Given this Court's repeated approval of government efforts to enable donors to make informed choices about their charitable contributions, see, e. g., Schaumburg, 444 U. S., at 638, almost all States and
many localities require charities and professional fundraisers to register
and file regular reports on their activities, particularly their fundraising
costs. These reports are generally available to the public and are often
placed on the Internet. Telemarketers do not object on First Amendment grounds to these disclosure requirements. Just as government
may seek to inform the public and prevent fraud through such requirements, so it may vigorously enforce antifraud laws to prohibit professional fundraisers from obtaining money on false pretenses or by making false statements. Riley, 487 U. S., at 800. High fundraising costs,
without more, do not establish fraud, see id., at 793, and mere failure to
volunteer the fundraiser's fee when contacting a potential donee, without more, is insufficient to state a claim for fraud, id., at 795-801. But
these limitations do not disarm States from assuring that their residents
are positioned to make informed choices about their charitable giving.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case concerns the amenability of for-profit fundraising
corporations to suit by the Attorney General of Illinois for
fraudulent charitable solicitations. The controversy arises
from the fundraisers' contracts with a charitable nonprofit
corporation organized to advance the welfare of Vietnam veterans; under the contracts, the fundraisers were to retain 85
percent of the proceeds of their fundraising endeavors. The
State Attorney General's complaint alleges that the fundraisers defrauded members of the public by falsely representing that "a significant amount of each dollar donated
would be paid over to [the veterans organization] for its
[charitable] purposes while in fact the [fundraisers] knew
that . . . 15 cents or less of each dollar would be available"
for those purposes. App. 9, || 34. Complementing that allegation, the complaint states that the fundraisers falsely represented that "the funds donated would go to further . . .
charitable purposes," id., at 8, || 29, when in fact "the amount
. . . paid over to charity was merely incidental to the fund

raising effort," which was conducted primarily "for the pri-vate pecuniary benefit of " the fundraisers, id., at 9, || 35.

The question presented is whether those allegations statea claim for relief that can survive a motion to dismiss. In
accord with the Illinois trial and appellate courts, the IllinoisSupreme Court held they did not. That court was "mindful
of the opportunity for public misunderstanding and the po-tential for donor confusion which may be presented with
fund-raising solicitations of the sort involved in th[is] case,"
Ryan v. Telemarketing Associates, Inc., 198 Ill. 2d 345, 363,763 N. E. 2d 289, 299 (2001); it nevertheless concluded that

threshold dismissal of the complaint was compelled by thisCourt's decisions in Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better
Environment, 444 U. S. 620 (1980), Secretary of State of Md.v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U. S. 947 (1984), and Riley
v. National Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781(1988). Those decisions held that certain regulations of
charitable subscriptions, barring fees in excess of a pre-scribed level, effectively imposed prior restraints on fundraising, and were therefore incompatible with the FirstAmendment.

We reverse the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court.Our prior decisions do not rule out, as supportive of a fraud
claim against fundraisers, any and all reliance on the per-centage of charitable donations fundraisers retain for themselves. While bare failure to disclose that information di-rectly to potential donors does not suffice to establish fraud,
when nondisclosure is accompanied by intentionally mislead-ing statements designed to deceive the listener, the First
Amendment leaves room for a fraud claim.

N. E. 2d, at 291. Telemarketing Associates and Armet were
retained by VietNow National Headquarters, a charitable nonprofit corporation, to solicit donations to aid Vietnam veterans. Id., at 348, 763 N. E. 2d, at 291. In this
opinion, we generally refer to respondents, collectively, as
"Telemarketers."

The contracts between the charity, VietNow, and the fundraisers, Telemarketers, provided that Telemarketers would
retain 85 percent of the gross receipts from donors within
Illinois, leaving 15 percent for VietNow. Ibid. Under the
agreements, donor lists developed by Telemarketers would
remain in their "sole and exclusive" control. App. 24, 93-94,
102, || 65. Telemarketers also brokered contracts on behalf
of VietNow with out-of-state fundraisers; under those contracts, out-of-state fundraisers retained between 70 percent
and 80 percent of donated funds, Telemarketers received between 10 percent and 20 percent as a finder's fee, and VietNow received 10 percent. 198 Ill. 2d, at 348, 763 N. E. 2d, at
291. Between July 1987 and the end of 1995, Telemarketers
collected approximately $7.1 million, keeping slightly more
than $6 million for themselves, and leaving approximately
$1.1 million for the charity. Ibid.1

In 1991, the Illinois Attorney General filed a complaint
against Telemarketers in state court. Id., at 348-350, 763
N. E. 2d, at 291-292.2 The complaint asserted common-law
and statutory claims for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty.
Ibid. It alleged, inter alia, that the 85 percent fee for which
Telemarketers contracted was "excessive" and "not justified

however, the complaint concerned misrepresentation.

In the course of their telephone solicitations, the complaint
states, Telemarketers misleadingly represented that "funds
donated would go to further Viet[N]ow's charitable purposes." Id., at 8, || 29. Affidavits attached to the complaint
aver that Telemarketers told prospective donors their contributions would be used for specifically identified charitable
endeavors; typical examples of those endeavors include "food
baskets given to vets [and] their families for Thanksgiving,"
id., at 124, paying "bills and rent to help physically and mentally disabled Vietnam vets and their families," id., at 131,
"jo[b] training," id., at 145, and "rehabilitation [and] other
services for Vietnam vets," id., at 169 (some capitalization
omitted in quotes). One affiant asked what percentage of
her contribution would be used for fundraising expenses; she
"was told 90% or more goes to the vets." Ibid. (capitalization omitted). Another affiant stated she was told her donation would not be used for "labor expenses" because "all
members are volunteers." Id., at 111 (capitalization omitted).3 Written materials Telemarketers sent to each donor

obviously, the two affidavits attesting to Telemarketers' representations
that "90% or more goes to the vets," and that there would be no "labor

The 15 cents or less of each solicited dollar actually madeavailable to VietNow, the Attorney General charged, "was

Telemarketers moved to dismiss the fraud claims, urgingthat they were barred by the First Amendment. The trial
court granted the motion,5 and the dismissal order wasaffirmed, in turn, by the Illinois Appellate Court and the
Illinois Supreme Court. The Illinois courts placed heavyweight on three decisions of this Court:

sentence fragment counsel identified falls short of showing, in the face of
established Illinois case law, that the court "found" the affidavits annexed
by the Illinois Attorney General dehors the complaint. Counsel's contention is further clouded by the Illinois Supreme Court's explicit notation
that "the Attorney General ha[d] attached to his complaint the affidavits
of 44 VietNow donors." 198 Ill. 2d, at 352, 763 N. E. 2d, at 293.

947 (1984); and Riley v. National Federation of Blind of
N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781 (1988). Each of the three decisions
invalidated state or local laws that categorically restrainedsolicitation by charities or professional fundraisers if a high

percentage of the funds raised would be used to cover ad-ministrative or fundraising costs.

Schaumburg, 444 U. S., at
620; Munson, 467 U. S., at 947; and Riley, 487 U. S., at 781;
see 198 Ill. 2d, at 359, 763 N. E. 2d, at 297.The Illinois Supreme Court acknowledged that this case,

unlike Schaumburg, Munson, and Riley, involves no pro-phylactic provision proscribing any charitable solicitation if
fundraising costs exceeded a prescribed limit. Instead, the
Attorney General sought to enforce the State's generally applicable antifraud laws against Telemarketers for "specific instances of deliberate deception." 198 Ill. 2d, at 358, 763 N. E.
2d, at 296 (quoting Riley, 487 U. S., at 803 (Scalia, J., concurring)). "However," the court said, "the statements made by
[Telemarketers] during solicitation are alleged to be `false'
only because [Telemarketers] retained 85% of the gross
receipts and failed to disclose this information to donors."
198 Ill. 2d, at 359, 763 N. E. 2d, at 297. The Attorney General's complaint, in the Illinois Supreme Court's view, was
"in essence, an attempt to regulate [Telemarketers'] ability
to engage in a protected activity based upon a percentagerate limitation"--"the same regulatory principle that was rejected in Schaumburg[,] Munson, and Riley." Ibid.

"[H]igh solicitation costs," the Illinois Supreme Court
stressed, "can be attributable to a number of factors." Ibid.
In this case, the court noted, Telemarketers contracted to
provide a "wide range" of services in addition to telephone
solicitation. Ibid. For example, they agreed to publish a
newsletter and to maintain a toll-free information hotline.
Id., at 359-360, 763 N. E. 2d, at 297-298. Moreover, the
court added, VietNow received "nonmonetary benefits by
having [its] message disbursed by the solicitation process,"
and Telemarketers were directed to solicit "in a manner that

Opinion of the Court
would `promote goodwill' on behalf of VietNow." Id., at 361,763 N. E. 2d, at 298. Taking these factors into account, the

court concluded that it would be "incorrect to presume . . .[any] nexus between high solicitation costs and fraud." Id.,
at 360, 763 N. E. 2d, at 298.The Illinois Supreme Court further determined that,
under Riley, "fraud cannot be defined in such a way that itplaces on solicitors the affirmative duty to disclose to potential donors, at the point of solicitation, the net proceeds tobe returned to the charity."

Id., at 361, 763 N. E. 2d, at298.
6 Finally, the court expressed the fear that if the complaint were allowed to proceed, all fundraisers in Illinoiswould be saddled with "the burden of defending the reasonableness of their fees, on a case-by-case basis, whenever inthe Attorney General's judgment the public was being deceived about the charitable nature of a fund-raising campaignbecause the fund-raiser's fee was too high." Id., at 362, 763
N. E. 2d, at 299. The threatened exposure to litigation costsand penalties, the court said, "could produce a substantial
chilling effect on protected speech." Ibid. We granted cer-tiorari. 537 U. S. 999 (2002).

The First Amendment protects the right to engage incharitable solicitation. See

causes--that are within the protection of the First Amend-ment");

Riley, 487 U. S., at 788-789. But the First Amendment does not shield fraud. See, e. g., Donaldson v. Read
Magazine, Inc., 333 U. S. 178, 190 (1948) (the government's
power "to protect people against fraud" has "always beenrecognized in this country and is firmly established");

Gertz
v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323, 340 (1974) (the "intentional lie" is "no essential part of any exposition of ideas"(internal quotation marks omitted)). Like other forms of

public deception, fraudulent charitable solicitation is un-protected speech. See,

e. g., Schneider v. State (Town of
Irvington), 308 U. S. 147, 164 (1939) ("Frauds," including
"fraudulent appeals . . . made in the name of charity and
religion," may be "denounced as offenses and punished by
law."); Donaldson, 333 U. S., at 192 ("A contention cannot be
seriously considered which assumes that freedom of the
press includes a right to raise money to promote circulation
by deception of the public.").

The Court has not previously addressed the First Amendment's application to individual fraud actions of the kind at
issue here. It has, however, three times considered prophylactic statutes designed to combat fraud by imposing prior
restraints on solicitation when fundraising fees exceeded a
specified reasonable level. Each time, the Court held the
prophylactic measures unconstitutional.

In Schaumburg, decided in 1980, the Court invalidated a
village ordinance that prohibited charitable organizations
from soliciting contributions unless they used at least 75
percent of their receipts "directly for the charitable purpose
of the organization." 444 U. S., at 624 (internal quotation
marks omitted). The ordinance defined "charitable purposes" to exclude salaries and commissions paid to solicitors,
and the administrative expenses of the charity, including
salaries. Ibid. The village of Schaumburg's "principal justification" for the ordinance was fraud prevention: "[A]ny organization using more than 25 percent of its receipts on fund538US2 Unit: $U49 [11-02-04 17:58:23] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Opinion of the Court
raising, salaries, and overhead," Schaumburg submitted, "is
not a charitable, but a commercial, for-profit enterprise"; "to
permit [such an organization] to represent itself as a charity,"
the village urged, "is fraudulent." Id., at 636.

The Court agreed with Schaumburg that fraud prevention
ranks as "a substantial governmental interes[t]," ibid., but
concluded that "the 75-percent requirement" promoted that
interest "only peripherally." Ibid. Spending "more than
25 percent of [an organization's] receipts on fundraising, salaries, and overhead," the Court explained, does not reliably
indicate that the enterprise is "commercial" rather than
"charitable." Ibid. Such spending might be altogether appropriate, Schaumburg noted, for a charitable organization
"primarily engaged in research, advocacy, or public education [that uses its] own paid staff to carry out these functions
as well as to solicit financial support." Id., at 636-637.
"The Village's legitimate interest in preventing fraud," the
Court stated, "can be better served by measures less intrusive than a direct prohibition on solicitation," id., at 637:
"Fraudulent misrepresentations can be prohibited and the
penal laws used to punish such conduct directly," ibid.

Four years later, in Munson, the Court invalidated a
Maryland law that prohibited charitable organizations from
soliciting if they paid or agreed to pay as expenses more
than 25 percent of the amount raised. Unlike the inflexible
ordinance in Schaumburg, the Maryland law authorized a
waiver of the 25 percent limitation "where [it] would effectively prevent the charitable organization from raising contributions." 467 U. S., at 950-951, n. 2. The Court held
that the waiver provision did not save the statute. Id.,
at 962. "[No] reaso[n] other than financial necessity warrant[ed] a waiver," Munson observed. Id., at 963. The
statute provided no shelter for a charity that incurred high
solicitation costs because it chose to disseminate information
as part of its fundraising. Ibid. Nor did it shield a charity

ASSOCIATES, INC.

Opinion of the Court

whose high solicitation costs stemmed from the unpopularityof its cause.

Id., at 967.
"[N]o doubt [there] are organizations that have high fund-raising costs not due to protected First Amendment activity," the Court recognized; it concluded, however, thatMaryland's statute was incapable of "distinguish[ing] those
organizations from charities that have high costs due to
protected First Amendment activities." Id., at 966. Thestatute's fatal flaw, the Court said, was that it "operate[d] on

[the] fundamentally mistaken premise that high solicitationcosts are an accurate measure of fraud."

Ibid. As in
Schaumburg, the Court noted, fraud could be checked by
"measures less intrusive than a direct prohibition on solicitation": Fraud could be punished directly and the State
"could require disclosure of the finances of a charitable organization so that a member of the public could make an informed decision about whether to contribute." 467 U. S., at
961, and n. 9.

Third in the trilogy of cases on which the Illinois Supreme
Court relied was our 1988 decision in Riley. The village
ordinance in Schaumburg and the Maryland law in Munson
regulated charities; the North Carolina charitable solicitation controls at issue in Riley directly regulated professional
fundraisers. North Carolina's law prohibited professional
fundraisers from retaining an "unreasonable" or "excessive"
fee. 487 U. S., at 784 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Fees up to 20 percent of the gross receipts collected were
deemed reasonable; fees between 20 percent and 35 percent
were deemed unreasonable if the State showed that the solicitation did not involve advocacy or dissemination of information. Id., at 784-785. Fees exceeding 35 percent were presumed unreasonable, but the fundraiser could rebut the
presumption by showing either that the solicitation involved
advocacy or information dissemination, or that, absent the
higher fee, the charity's "ability to raise money or communicate would be significantly diminished." Id., at 785-786.

615Cite as: 538 U. S. 600 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
Relying on Schaumburg and Munson, the Court's decisionin

Riley invalidated North Carolina's endeavor to rein in
charitable solicitors' fees. The Court held, once again, thatfraud may not be inferred simply from the percentage of

charitable donations absorbed by fundraising costs. See 487U. S., at 789 ("solicitation of charitable contributions is protected speech"; "using percentages to decide the legality of
the fundraiser's fee is not narrowly tailored to the State'sinterest in preventing fraud").

The opportunity to rebut the unreasonableness presump-tion attending a fee over 35 percent did not bring North Carolina's scheme within the constitutional zone, the Court explained. Under the State's law, "even where a prima facie
showing of unreasonableness ha[d] been rebutted, the factfinder [still had to] make an ultimate determination, on a
case-by-case basis, as to whether the fee was reasonable--a
showing that the solicitation involved . . . advocacy or [the]
dissemination of information [did] not alone establish that
the total fee was reasonable." Id., at 786.

Training on that aspect of North Carolina's regulation, the
Court stated: "Even if we agreed that some form of a
percentage-based measure could be used, in part, to test for
fraud, we could not agree to a measure that requires the
speaker to prove `reasonableness' case by case based upon
what is at best a loose inference that the fee might be too
high." Id., at 793. "[E]very campaign incurring fees in excess of 35% . . . [would] subject [fundraisers] to potential
litigation over the `reasonableness' of the fee," the Court observed; that litigation risk, the Court concluded, would "chill
speech in direct contravention of the First Amendment's dictates." Id., at 794. Especially likely to be burdened, the
Riley opinion noted, were solicitations combined with advocacy or the communication of information, and fundraising by
small or unpopular charities. Ibid. The Court cautioned,
however, as it did in Schaumburg and Munson, that States
need not "sit idly by and allow their citizens to be de538US2 Unit: $U49 [11-02-04 17:58:23] PAGES PGT: OPLG

ASSOCIATES, INC.

Opinion of the Court

frauded." 487 U. S., at 795. We anticipated that NorthCarolina law enforcement officers would be "ready and able"

to enforce the State's antifraud law. Ibid.

Riley presented a further issue. North Carolina law required professional fundraisers to disclose to potential do-nors, before asking for money, the percentage of the prior

year's charitable contributions the fundraisers had actually
turned over to charity. Ibid. The State defended this dis-closure requirement as a proper means to dispel public misperception that the money donors gave to professional fund-raisers went in greater-than-actual proportion to benefit
charity. Id., at 798.

This Court condemned the measure as an "unduly burdensome" prophylactic rule, an exaction unnecessary to achieve
the State's goal of preventing donors from being misled.
Id., at 800. The State's rule, Riley emphasized, conclusively
presumed that "the charity derive[d] no benefit from funds
collected but not turned over to it." Id., at 798. This was
"not necessarily so," the Court said, for charities might well
benefit from the act of solicitation itself, when the request
for funds conveyed information or involved cause-oriented
advocacy. Ibid.

The Court noted in Riley that North Carolina (like Illinois
here) required professional fundraisers to disclose their professional status. Id., at 799; see Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 225,

$ 460/17(a) (2001); supra, at 609, n. 4, 611, n. 6. That disclosure, the Court said, effectively notified contributors that a
portion of the money they donated would underwrite solicitation costs. A concerned donor could ask how much of the
contribution would be turned over to the charity, and under
North Carolina law, fundraisers would be obliged to provide
that information. Riley, 487 U. S., at 799 (citing N. C. Gen.
Stat. $ 131C-16 (1986)). But upfront telephone disclosure of
the fundraiser's fee, the Court believed, might end as well as
begin the conversation: A potential contributor who thought
the fee too high might simply hang up. 487 U. S., at 799-

Opinion of the Court
800. "[M]ore benign and narrowly tailored options" thatwould not chill solicitation altogether were available; for example, the Court suggested, "the State may itself publishthe detailed financial disclosure forms it requires professional fundraisers to file," and "[it] may vigorously enforceits antifraud laws to prohibit professional fundraisers from
obtaining money on false pretenses or by making false state-ments."

Ibid. III

A
The Court's opinions in Schaumburg, Munson, and Rileytook care to leave a corridor open for fraud actions to guard

the public against false or misleading charitable solicitations.See Schaumburg, 444 U. S., at 637; Munson, 467 U. S., at 961,
and n. 9; Riley, 487 U. S., at 795, 800.7 As those decisionsrecognized, and as we further explain below, there are differences critical to First Amendment concerns between fraudactions trained on representations made in individual cases
and statutes that categorically ban solicitations when fund-raising costs run high. See Part III-B,

infra. Simply la-beling an action one for "fraud," of course, will not carry the

day. For example, had the complaint against Telemarketerscharged fraud based solely on the percentage of donations
the fundraisers would retain, or their failure to alert poten-tial donors to their fee arrangements at the start of each
telephone call, Riley would support swift dismissal.8 AState's Attorney General surely cannot gain case-by-case
ground this Court has declared off limits to legislators.

7 We are therefore unpersuaded by Telemarketers' plea that they lacked
fair notice of their vulnerability to fraud actions. See Brief for Respondents 46, 49-50.

8 Although fundraiser retention of 85 percent of donations is significantly

higher than the 35 percent limit in Riley, this Court has not yet accepted
any percentage-based measure as dispositive. See supra, at 615 (quoting
Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 793
(1988)).

Opinion of the Court

Portions of the complaint in fact filed by the Attorney Gen-eral are of this genre. See,

e. g., App. 103, || 72 (asserting
that Telemarketers' charge "is excessive" and "not justifiedby expenses [they] paid");

id., at 86, |||| 67H-67I (alleging
statutory violations based on failure to disclose to prospec-tive donors Telemarketers' percentage fee). As we earlier

noted, however, see supra, at 608-609, the complaint and annexed affidavits, in large part, alleged not simply what Tele-marketers failed to convey; they also described what Telemarketers misleadingly represented.Under Illinois law, similar to the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, "[w]hen the legal sufficiency of a complaint is
challenged by a . . . motion to dismiss, all well-pleaded facts
in the complaint are taken as true and [the court] must determine whether the allegations . . . , when interpreted in the
light most favorable to the plaintiff, are sufficient to establish a cause of action upon which relief may be granted."
Connick v. Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd., 174 Ill. 2d 482, 490, 675
N. E. 2d 584, 588 (1997) (emphasis added). Dismissal is
proper "only if it clearly appears that no set of facts can be
proved under the pleadings which will entitle the plaintiff to
recover." 198 Ill. 2d, at 351, 763 N. E. 2d, at 293.

Taking into account the affidavits, and reading the complaint in the light most favorable to the Attorney General,
that pleading described misrepresentations our precedent
does not place under the First Amendment's cover. First, it
asserted that Telemarketers affirmatively represented that
"a significant amount of each dollar donated would be paid
over to Viet[N]ow" to be used for specific charitable purposes--rehabilitation services, job training, food baskets,
and assistance for rent and bills, App. 9, || 34; id., at 124, 131,
145, 163, 169, 187, 189--while in reality Telemarketers knew
that "15 cents or less of each dollar" was "available to Viet[N]ow for its purposes." Id., at 9, || 34. Second, the complaint alleged, essentially, that the charitable solicitation was
a fac,ade: Although Telemarketers represented that donated

538US2 Unit: $U49 [11-02-04 17:58:24] PAGES PGT: OPLG

619Cite as: 538 U. S. 600 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
funds would go to VietNow's specific "charitable purposes,"id., at 8, || 29, the "amount of funds being paid over to charity

was merely incidental to the fund raising effort," which wasmade "for the private pecuniary benefit of [Telemarketers]
and their agents," id., at 9, || 35. Cf., e. g., Voices for Free-dom, CCH Trade Reg. || 23,080 (1993) [1987-1993 Transfer
Binder] (complaint against fundraisers who, inter alia, repre-sented that "substantial portions of the funds from [the sale
of commemorative bracelets] would be used to support amessage center for the troops stationed in the Persian Gulf,"
but "did not use substantial portions of the bracelet-salesproceeds to support the message center").

Fraud actions so tailored, targeting misleading affirmativerepresentations about how donations will be used, are plainly
distinguishable, as we next discuss, from the measures inval-idated in

Schaumburg, Munson, and Riley: So long as theemphasis is on what the fundraisers misleadingly convey, and

not on percentage limitations on solicitors' fees per se, suchactions need not impermissibly chill protected speech.

B
In Schaumburg, Munson, and Riley, the Court invalidatedlaws that prohibited charitable organizations or fundraisers from engaging in charitable solicitation if they spenthigh percentages of donated funds on fundraising--whether
or not any fraudulent representations were made to potentialdonors. Truthfulness even of all representations was not

a defense. See supra, at 612-616. In contrast to the priorrestraints inspected in those cases, a properly tailored fraud
action targeting fraudulent representations themselves em-ploys no "[b]road prophylactic rul[e],"

Schaumburg, 444U. S., at 637 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted),

lacking any "nexus . . . [to] the likelihood that the solicitationis fraudulent," Riley, 487 U. S., at 793. Such an action thus
falls on the constitutional side of the line the Court's casesdraw "between regulation aimed at fraud and regulation

aimed at something else in the hope that it would sweepfraud in during the process." Munson, 467 U. S., at 969-

970. The Illinois Attorney General's complaint, in this light,has a solid core in allegations that home in on affirmative
statements Telemarketers made intentionally misleading do-nors regarding the use of their contributions. See supra,
at 608-609.Of prime importance, and in contrast to a prior restraint
on solicitation, or a regulation that imposes on fundraisersan uphill burden to prove their conduct lawful, in a properly
tailored fraud action the State bears the full burden of proof.False statement alone does not subject a fundraiser to fraud
liability. As restated in Illinois case law, to prove a defend-ant liable for fraud, the complainant must show that the
defendant made a false representation of a material factknowing that the representation was false; further, the complainant must demonstrate that the defendant made the rep-resentation with the intent to mislead the listener, and succeeded in doing so. See In re Witt, 145 Ill. 2d 380, 391, 583N. E. 2d 526, 531 (1991). Heightening the complainant's burden, these showings must be made by clear and convincingevidence. See Hofmann v. Hofmann, 94 Ill. 2d 205, 222, 446
N. E. 2d 499, 506 (1983).9Exacting proof requirements of this order, in other contexts, have been held to provide sufficient breathing roomfor protected speech. See New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,
376 U. S. 254, 279-280 (1964) (action for defamation of public

9 In Riley, this Court expressed concern that case-by-case litigation over
the reasonableness of fundraising fees would inhibit speech. 487 U. S., at
793-794. That concern arose in large measure because the North Carolina statute there at issue placed the burden of proof on the fundraiser.
The Court has long cautioned that, to avoid chilling protected speech, the
government must bear the burden of proving that the speech it seeks to
prohibit is unprotected. See Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U. S. 51, 58
(1965); Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513, 525-526 (1958). The government
shoulders that burden in a fraud action.

Inc., 466 U. S. 485, 502, and n. 19 (1984) (noting "kinship"
between New York Times standard and "motivation that
must be proved to support a common-law action for deceit").10 As an additional safeguard responsive to First
Amendment concerns, an appellate court could independently review the trial court's findings. Cf. Bose Corp., 466
U. S., at 498-511 (de novo appellate review of findings regarding actual malice). What the First Amendment and our
case law emphatically do not require, however, is a blanket
exemption from fraud liability for a fundraiser who intentionally misleads in calls for donations.

The Illinois Supreme Court in the instant case correctly
observed that "the percentage of [fundraising] proceeds
turned over to a charity is not an accurate measure of the
amount of funds used `for' a charitable purpose." 198 Ill. 2d,
at 360, 763 N. E. 2d, at 298 (citing Munson, 467 U. S., at 967,
n. 16). But the gravamen of the fraud action in this case is
not high costs or fees, it is particular representations made
with intent to mislead. If, for example, a charity conducted
an advertising or awareness campaign that advanced charitable purposes in conjunction with its fundraising activity, its
representation that donated funds were going to "charitable
purposes" would not be misleading, much less intentionally
so. Similarly, charitable organizations that engage primarily in advocacy or information dissemination could get and
spend money for their activities without risking a fraud

10 Although this case does not present the issue, the Illinois Attorney
General urges that a constitutional requirement resembling "actual malice" does not attend "every form of liability by charitable solicitors who
misrepresent the use of donations." Reply Brief 16-17, n. 11 (internal
quotation marks omitted). We confine our consideration to the complaint
in this case, which alleged that Telemarketers "acted with knowledge of
the falsity of their representations." Ibid.

467 U. S., at 963; Riley, 487 U. S., at 798-799.11

The Illinois Attorney General here has not suggested that
a charity must desist from using donations for information
dissemination, advocacy, the promotion of public awareness,
the production of advertising material, the development or
enlargement of the charity's contributor base,12 and the like.
Rather, she has alleged that Telemarketers attracted donations by misleading potential donors into believing that a
substantial portion of their contributions would fund specific
programs or services, knowing full well that was not the
case. See supra, at 608-609, 618-619. Such representations remain false or misleading, however legitimate the
other purposes for which the funds are in fact used.

We do not agree with Telemarketers that the Illinois Attorney General's fraud action is simply an end run around
Riley's holding that fundraisers may not be required,
in every telephone solicitation, to state the percentage of
receipts the fundraiser would retain. See Brief for Respondents 14-19. It is one thing to compel every fundraiser
to disclose its fee arrangements at the start of a telephone
conversation, quite another to take fee arrangements into

11 Amicus Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), for example, states
that its mission is "to communicate the message `Don't Drink and Drive.' "
Brief for Public Citizen, Inc., et al. as Amici Curiae 13. Telephone solicitors retained by MADD "reach millions of people a year, and each call
educates the public about the tragedy of drunk driving, provides statistics
and asks the customer to always designate a sober driver." Ibid. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Solicitations that described
MADD's charitable mission would not be fraudulent simply because
MADD devotes a large proportion of its resources to fundraising calls,
for those calls themselves fulfill its advocacy/information dissemination
mission.

12 This Court has consistently recognized that small or unpopular charities would be hindered by limitations on the portion of receipts they could
devote to subscription building. See Secretary of State of Md. v. Joseph
H. Munson Co., 467 U. S. 947, 967 (1984); Riley, 487 U. S., at 794.

account in assessing whether particular affirmative repre-sentations designedly deceive the public.

C
Our decisions have repeatedly recognized the legitimacyof government efforts to enable donors to make informed

choices about their charitable contributions. In Schaum-burg, the Court thought it proper to require "disclosure of
the finances of charitable organizations," thereby to preventfraud "by informing the public of the ways in which their
contributions will be employed." 444 U. S., at 638. In
Munson, the Court reiterated that "disclosure of the financesof a charitable organization" could be required "so that a

member of the public could make an informed decision aboutwhether to contribute." 467 U. S., at 961-962, n. 9. And
in Riley, the Court said the State may require profes-sional fundraisers to file "detailed financial disclosure forms"
and may communicate that information to the public. 487U. S., at 800; see also id., at 799, n. 11 (State may require
fundraisers "to disclose unambiguously [their] professionalstatus").

In accord with our precedent, as Telemarketers and theiramici acknowledge, in "[a]lmost all of [the] states and many
localities," charities and professional fundraisers must "reg-ister and file regular reports on activities[,] particularly
fundraising costs." Brief for Respondents 37; see Brief forIndependent Sector et al. as

Amici Curiae 6-8. These re-ports are generally available to the public; indeed, "[m]any

states have placed the reports they receive from charitiesand professional fundraisers on the Internet." Brief for Respondents 39; see Brief for Independent Sector et al. asAmici Curiae 9-10. Telemarketers do not object on First
Amendment grounds to these disclosure requirements. Tr.of Oral Arg. 43.

"vigorously enforce . . . antifraud laws to prohibit profes-sional fundraisers from obtaining money on false pretenses

or by making false statements." Riley, 487 U. S., at 800.High fundraising costs, without more, do not establish fraud.
See id., at 793. And mere failure to volunteer the fund-raiser's fee when contacting a potential donee, without more,
is insufficient to state a claim for fraud. Id., at 795-801.But these limitations do not disarm States from assuring
that their residents are positioned to make informed choicesabout their charitable giving. Consistent with our precedent and the First Amendment, States may maintain fraudactions when fundraisers make false or misleading representations designed to deceive donors about how their donationswill be used.

For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Illinois Su-preme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,concurring.

The question presented by the petition for certiorari inthis case reads as follows: "Whether the First Amendment
categorically prohibits a State from pursuing a fraud actionagainst a professional fundraiser who represents that donations will be used for charitable purposes but in fact keepsthe vast majority (in this case 85 percent) of all funds donated." Pet. for Cert. i. I join the Court's opinion becauseI think it clear from the opinion that if the

only representa-tion made by the fundraiser were the one set forth in the

question presented ("that donations will be used for charita-ble purposes"), and if the only evidence of alleged failure to
comply with that representation were the evidence set forthin the question presented (that the fundraiser "keeps the

vast majority (in this case 85 percent) of all funds donated"),the answer to the question would be yes.

It is the teaching of Riley v. National Federation of Blindof N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 793 (1988), and Secretary of State
of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U. S. 947, 966 (1984),that since there is such wide disparity in the legitimate
expenses borne by charities, it is not possible to establisha maximum percentage that is reasonable. It also follows
from that premise that there can in general be no reasonableexpectation on the part of donors as to what fraction of the
gross proceeds goes to expenses. When that proposition iscombined with the unquestionable fact that one who is promised, without further specification, that his charitable contri-bution will go to a particular cause must reasonably understand that it will go there after the deduction of legitimateexpenses, the conclusion must be that the promise is not broken (and hence fraud is not committed) by the mere fact thatexpenses are very high. Today's judgment, however, rests
upon a "solid core" of misrepresentations, ante, at 620, thatgo well beyond mere commitment of the collected funds to
the charitable purpose.

KAUPP v. TEXAS
on petition for writ of certiorari to the court ofappeals of texas, fourteenth district

No. 02-5636. Decided May 5, 2003
After petitioner Kaupp, then 17, was implicated in the murder of a 14-

year-old girl by the confession of the girl's half brother, detectives tried,
but failed, to obtain a warrant to question Kaupp. They then went to
his house at 3 a.m.; awakened and handcuffed him; led him, shoeless and
dressed only in his underwear, to a patrol car; stopped at the crime
scene; and took him to the sheriff's headquarters, where they removed
the handcuffs and advised him of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona,
384 U. S. 436. Once presented with the brother's confession, Kaupp admitted to having a part in the crime. He did not acknowledge causing
the fatal wound or confess to the murder, for which he was later indicted. Kaupp moved unsuccessfully to suppress his confession as the
fruit of an illegal arrest, was convicted, and was sentenced to prison.
In affirming, the Texas Court of Appeals found that the arrest occurred
after Kaupp's confession; that Kaupp consented to go with the officers
when he answered "Okay" to an officer's statement that they needed to
talk; that a reasonable person would not have believed that putting on
handcuffs before being removed to a patrol car was a significant restriction on his freedom of movement, since this was common practice of the
sheriff's office; and that Kaupp did not resist the use of handcuffs or act
in a manner consistent with anything but full cooperation. The State
Court of Criminal Appeals denied discretionary review.

Held: Kaupp was arrested within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment

before the detectives began to question him. A seizure of the person
within the meaning of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments occurs
when, "taking into account all of the circumstances surrounding the encounter, the police conduct would `have communicated to a reasonable
person that he was not at liberty to ignore the police presence and go
about his business.' " Florida v. Bostick, 501 U. S. 429, 437. This test
is derived from Justice Stewart's opinion in United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U. S. 544, 554, which includes, as examples of circumstances
that might indicate a seizure, the threatening presence of several police
officers, an officer's display of a weapon, some physical touching of the
person, or the use of language or tone of voice indicating that compliance
with the officer's request might be compelled. This Court has never
sustained the involuntary removal of a suspect from his home to a police

station and his detention there for investigative purposes absent probable cause or judicial authorization. The State does not claim to have
had probable cause here, and an application of the test just mentioned
shows that Kaupp was arrested, there being evidence of every one of
Mendenhall's probative circumstances. A 17-year-old boy was awakened at 3 a.m. by at least three police officers, placed in handcuffs, and
taken in his underwear and without shoes in a patrol car to the crime
scene and then to the sheriff's offices, where he was taken into an interrogation room and questioned. The contrary reasons mentioned by the
state courts--his "Okay" response, that the sheriff's office routinely
handcuffed individuals when transporting them, and that Kaupp did not
resist the handcuffs or act uncooperatively--are no answer to the facts
here. Because Kaupp was arrested before he was questioned, and because the State does not claim that the sheriff's department had probable cause to detain him at that point, his confession must be suppressed
unless the State can show that it was an act of free will sufficient to
purge the primary taint of the unlawful invasion. The only relevant
consideration supporting the State is the observance of Miranda, but
such warnings alone cannot always break the causal connection between
the illegality and the confession, Brown v. Illinois, 422 U. S. 590, 603.
All other relevant considerations--the temporal proximity of the arrest
and the confession, the presence of intervening circumstances, and the
official misconduct's purpose and flagrancy--point the opposite way.
Unless, on remand, the State can point to testimony undisclosed on this
record, and weighty enough to carry its burden despite the clear force
of the evidence here, the confession must be suppressed.

Certiorari granted; vacated and remanded.

This case turns on the Fourth Amendment rule that a confession "obtained by exploitation of an illegal arrest" maynot be used against a criminal defendant.

Brown v. Illinois,
422 U. S. 590, 603 (1975). After a 14-year-old girl disappeared in January 1999, the Harris County Sheriff 's Department learned she had had a sexual relationship with her 19-
year-old half brother, who had been in the company of
petitioner Robert Kaupp, then 17 years old, on the day of
the girl's disappearance. On January 26th, deputy sheriffs
questioned the brother and Kaupp at headquarters; Kaupp
was cooperative and was permitted to leave, but the brother

failed a polygraph examination (his third such failure).Eventually he confessed that he had fatally stabbed his half

sister and placed her body in a drainage ditch. He impli-cated Kaupp in the crime.

Detectives immediately tried but failed to obtain a war-rant to question Kaupp.

1 Detective Gregory Pinkins nevertheless decided (in his words) to "get [Kaupp] in and confronthim with what [the brother] had said." App. A to Pet. for

Cert. 2. In the company of two other plainclothes detec-tives and three uniformed officers, Pinkins went to Kaupp's
house at approximately 3 a.m. on January 27th. AfterKaupp's father let them in, Pinkins, with at least two
other officers, went to Kaupp's bedroom, awakened himwith a flashlight, identified himself, and said, " `we need to
go and talk.' " Ibid. Kaupp said " `Okay.' " Ibid. Thetwo officers then handcuffed Kaupp and led him, shoeless and
dressed only in boxer shorts and a T-shirt, out of his houseand into a patrol car. The State points to nothing in the
record indicating Kaupp was told that he was free to declineto go with the officers.

They stopped for 5 or 10 minutes where the victim's bodyhad just been found, in anticipation of confronting Kaupp
with the brother's confession, and then went on to the sher-iff 's headquarters. There, they took Kaupp to an interview
room, removed his handcuffs, and advised him of his rightsunder Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). Kaupp first
denied any involvement in the victim's disappearance, but 10

warrant," which they described as authority to take Kaupp into custody
for questioning. App. 3 to App. D to Pet. for Cert. 6 (trial transcript).
The detectives did not seek a conventional arrest warrant, as they did not
believe they had probable cause for Kaupp's arrest. See ibid. As the
trial court later explained, the detectives had no evidence or motive to
corroborate the brother's allegations of Kaupp's involvement, see App. C
to Pet. for Cert. 2; the brother had previously failed three polygraph examinations, while, only two days earlier, Kaupp had voluntarily taken and
passed one, in which he denied his involvement, see id., at 1-2.

or 15 minutes into the interrogation, told of the brother'sconfession, he admitted having some part in the crime. He

did not, however, acknowledge causing the fatal wound orconfess to murder, for which he was later indicted.

After moving unsuccessfully to suppress his confessionas the fruit of an illegal arrest, Kaupp was convicted and
sentenced to 55 years' imprisonment. The State Court of
Appeals affirmed the conviction by unpublished opinion,concluding that no arrest had occurred until after the confession. The state court said that Kaupp consented to go withthe officers when he answered " `Okay' " to Pinkins's statement that " `we need to go and talk.' " App. A to Pet. for
Cert. 2, 6. The court saw no contrary significance in the
subsequent handcuffing and removal to the patrol car, given
the practice of the sheriff 's department in "routinely" using
handcuffs for safety purposes when transporting individuals,
as officers had done with Kaupp only the day before. Id.,
at 6. The court observed that "a reasonable person in
[Kaupp's] position would not believe that being put in handcuffs was a significant restriction on his freedom of movement." Ibid. Finally, the state court noted that Kaupp
"did not resist the use of handcuffs or act in a manner consistent with anything other than full cooperation." Id., at
6-7. Kaupp appealed, but the Court of Criminal Appeals of
Texas denied discretionary review. App. B to Pet. for Cert.

Stewart's opinion in United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U. S.544 (1980), see California v. Hodari D., 499 U. S. 621, 627-

628 (1991), which gave several "[e]xamples of circumstancesthat might indicate a seizure, even where the person did not
attempt to leave," including "the threatening presence ofseveral officers, the display of a weapon by an officer, some
physical touching of the person of the citizen, or the use oflanguage or tone of voice indicating that compliance with the
officer's request might be compelled." Mendenhall, supra,at 554.

Although certain seizures may be justified on somethingless than probable cause, see,

e. g., Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1(1968), we have never "sustained against Fourth Amendment

challenge the involuntary removal of a suspect from his hometo a police station and his detention there for investigative
purposes . . . absent probable cause or judicial authorization."Hayes v. Florida, 470 U. S. 811, 815 (1985);

2 cf. Payton v.

New York, 445 U. S. 573, 589-590 (1980); compare Floridav.

Royer, 460 U. S. 491, 499 (1983) (plurality opinion) ("[Thepolice] may [not] seek to verify [mere] suspicions by means

that approach the conditions of arrest"), with United Statesv. Sokolow, 490 U. S. 1, 7 (1989) ("[T]he police can stop and
briefly detain a person for investigative purposes if the offi-cer has a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts
that criminal activity `may be afoot,' even if the officer lacksprobable cause" (quoting Terry, supra, at 30)). Such involuntary transport to a police station for questioning is"sufficiently like arres[t] to invoke the traditional rule that
arrests may constitutionally be made only on probablecause."

Hayes, supra, at 816.The State does not claim to have had probable cause here,

and a straightforward application of the test just mentionedshows beyond cavil that Kaupp was arrested within the

meaning of the Fourth Amendment, there being evidence ofevery one of the probative circumstances mentioned by Justice Stewart in Mendenhall.3 A 17-year-old boy was awak-ened in his bedroom at three in the morning by at least three
police officers, one of whom stated " `we need to go andtalk.' " He was taken out in handcuffs, without shoes,
dressed only in his underwear in January, placed in a patrol
car, driven to the scene of a crime and then to the sher-iff 's offices, where he was taken into an interrogation room

and questioned. This evidence points to arrest even morestarkly than the facts in

Dunaway v. New York, 442 U. S.
200, 212 (1979), where the petitioner "was taken from aneighbor's home to a police car, transported to a police station, and placed in an interrogation room." There we heldit clear that the detention was "in important respects indistinguishable from a traditional arrest" and therefore re-quired probable cause or judicial authorization to be legal.
Ibid. The same is, if anything, even clearer here.

Contrary reasons mentioned by the state courts are no
answer to the facts. Kaupp's " `Okay' " in response to Pinkins's statement is no showing of consent under the circumstances. Pinkins offered Kaupp no choice, and a group of
police officers rousing an adolescent out of bed in the middle
of the night with the words " `we need to go and talk' " presents no option but "to go." There is no reason to think
Kaupp's answer was anything more than "a mere submission
to a claim of lawful authority." Royer, supra, at 497 (plurality opinion); see also Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U. S.
218, 226, 233-234 (1973). If reasonable doubt were possible

3 On the record before us, it is possible to debate whether the law enforcement officers were armed. The State Court of Appeals not only described them as armed but said specifically that Pinkins's weapon was
visible, though not drawn, when he confronted Kaupp in the bedroom.
See App. A to Pet. for Cert. 6. But at least one officer testified before
the trial court that they went to Kaupp's house unarmed. See App. 3 to
App. D to Pet. for Cert. 8 (trial transcript).

on this point, the ensuing events would resolve it: removalfrom one's house in handcuffs on a January night with nothing on but underwear for a trip to a crime scene on the wayto an interview room at law enforcement headquarters.
Even "an initially consensual encounter . . . can be trans-formed into a seizure or detention within the meaning of the
Fourth Amendment." INS v. Delgado, 466 U. S. 210, 215
(1984); see Hayes, supra, at 815-816 ("[A]t some point in theinvestigative process, police procedures can qualitatively and

quantitatively be so intrusive with respect to a suspect'sfreedom of movement and privacy interests as to trigger the
full protection of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments").
It cannot seriously be suggested that when the detectives
began to question Kaupp, a reasonable person in his situation
would have thought he was sitting in the interview room
as a matter of choice, free to change his mind and go home
to bed.

Nor is it significant, as the state court thought, that the
sheriff 's department "routinely" transported individuals, including Kaupp on one prior occasion, while handcuffed for
safety of the officers, or that Kaupp "did not resist the use
of handcuffs or act in a manner consistent with anything
other than full cooperation." App. A to Pet. for Cert. 6.
The test is an objective one, see, e. g., Chesternut, 486
U. S., at 574, and stressing the officers' motivation of selfprotection does not speak to how their actions would reasonably be understood. As for the lack of resistance, failure
to struggle with a cohort of deputy sheriffs is not a waiver
of Fourth Amendment protection, which does not require the
perversity of resisting arrest or assaulting a police officer.

Since Kaupp was arrested before he was questioned, and
because the State does not even claim that the sheriff 's department had probable cause to detain him at that point,
well-established precedent requires suppression of the confession unless that confession was "an act of free will [sufficient] to purge the primary taint of the unlawful invasion."

Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U. S. 471, 486 (1963). Dem-onstrating such purgation is, of course, a function of circumstantial evidence, with the burden of persuasion on the State.See

Brown, 422 U. S., at 604. Relevant considerations include observance of Miranda, "[t]he temporal proximity ofthe arrest and the confession, the presence of intervening

circumstances, and, particularly, the purpose and flagrancy
of the official misconduct." 422 U. S., at 603-604 (footnotesand citation omitted).

The record before us shows that only one of these consid-erations, the giving of

Miranda warnings, supports the
State, and we held in Brown that "Miranda warnings, alone
and per se, cannot always . . . break, for Fourth Amendment
purposes, the causal connection between the illegality and
the confession." 422 U. S., at 603 (emphasis in original); see
also Taylor v. Alabama, 457 U. S. 687, 699 (1982) (O'Connor,
J., dissenting) (noting that, although Miranda warnings are
an important factor, "they are, standing alone, insufficient").
All other factors point the opposite way. There is no indication from the record that any substantial time passed between Kaupp's removal from his home in handcuffs and his
confession after only 10 or 15 minutes of interrogation. In
the interim, he remained in his partially clothed state in the
physical custody of a number of officers, some of whom, at
least, were conscious that they lacked probable cause to arrest. See Brown, supra, at 604-605. In fact, the State has
not even alleged "any meaningful intervening event" between the illegal arrest and Kaupp's confession. Taylor,
supra, at 691. Unless, on remand, the State can point to
testimony undisclosed on the record before us, and weighty
enough to carry the State's burden despite the clear force of
the evidence shown here, the confession must be suppressed.

The judgment of the State Court of Appeals is vacated,
and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

PRICE, WARDEN v. VINCENT
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 02-524. Argued April 21, 2003--Decided May 19, 2003
At respondent's trial on an open murder charge, defense counsel moved,

at the close of the prosecution's case in chief and outside the jury's hearing, for a directed verdict of acquittal as to first-degree murder. The
trial judge stated that second-degree murder was " `an appropriate
charge,' " 292 F. 3d 506, 508, but agreed to hear the prosecutor's statement on first-degree murder the next morning. When the prosecution
made the statement, defense counsel objected, arguing that the court
had granted its directed verdict motion the previous day, and that further prosecution on first-degree murder would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. The judge responded that he had granted the motion but
had not directed a verdict, and noted that the jury had not been told
of his statement. He subsequently submitted the first-degree murder
charge to the jury, which convicted respondent on that charge. The
Michigan Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the Double Jeopardy Clause prevented respondent's prosecution for first-degree murder.
Reversing in turn, the State Supreme Court determined that the trial
judge's comments were not sufficiently final to terminate jeopardy. Respondent then notified the court of a docket sheet entry stating: " `1
open murder to 2nd degree murder,' " id., at 512. The Michigan Supreme Court refused to reconsider its decision. Respondent filed a federal habeas petition, and the Federal District Court granted the petition
after concluding that continued prosecution for first-degree murder had
violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. The Sixth Circuit affirmed.

Held: Respondent did not meet the statutory requirements for habeas relief. The parties do not dispute the underlying facts, and respondent is
therefore entitled to relief only if he can demonstrate that the state
court's adjudication of his claim was "contrary to" or an "unreasonable
application of" this Court's clearly established precedents. 28 U. S. C.

forth in [the Court's] cases" or if it "confronts a set of facts that are

less arrives at" a different result. Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362,
405-406. Here, the Michigan Supreme Court identified, and reaffirmed
the principles articulated in, the applicable precedents of United States
v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564, and Smalis v. Pennsylvania,
476 U. S. 140. Nowhere did it apply a legal standard contrary to those
set forth in this Court's cases, nor did it confront a set of facts materially
indistinguishable from those in any case decided by this Court. The
state court's decision therefore was not "contrary to" this Court's precedents. Nor was the state court's decision an "unreasonable application"
of clearly established law. That court applied both Martin Linen and
Smalis to conclude that the judge's comments were not sufficiently final
to terminate jeopardy. In reaching this conclusion, in addition to reviewing the context and substance of the trial judge's comments at
length, the court observed that there was no formal judgment or order
entered on the record. While it noted that formal motions or rulings
were not required to demonstrate finality as a matter of Michigan law,
it cautioned that a judgment must bear sufficient indicia of finality and
it concluded that sufficient indicia were not present here. This was not
an objectively unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme
Court law. Indeed, numerous courts have refused to find double jeopardy violations under similar circumstances. Even if this Court agreed
with the Sixth Circuit that the Double Jeopardy Clause should be read
to prevent continued prosecution under these circumstances, it was at
least reasonable for the state court to conclude otherwise. Pp. 638-643.

killed. Respondent was arrested in connection with theshooting and was charged with open murder. At the close

of the prosecution's case in chief and outside the hearing ofthe jury, defense counsel moved for a directed verdict of acquittal as to first-degree murder, arguing that there was in-sufficient evidence of premeditation and deliberation. The
trial judge stated:

" `[M]y impression at this time is that there's not been
shown premeditation or planning in the, in the allegedslaying. That what we have at the very best is Second

Degree Murder. . . . I think that Second Degree Murderis an appropriate charge as to the defendants. Okay.' "
292 F. 3d, at 508.
Before court adjourned, the prosecutor asked to make a brief
statement regarding first-degree murder the following morn-ing.

Ibid. The trial judge agreed to hear it.
When the prosecution made the statement, however, de-fense counsel objected. The defense argued that the court

had granted its motion for a directed verdict as to first-degree murder the previous day, and that further prosecution on that charge would violate the Double Jeopardy
Clause. Ibid. The judge responded, " `Oh, I granted a mo-tion but I have not directed a verdict.' "

noted that the jury had not been informed of his statements,and said that he would reserve a ruling on the matter. Subsequently, he decided to permit the charge of first-degreemurder to be submitted to the jury.

The jury convicted respondent of first-degree murder, andrespondent appealed.

n. 9 (1977)). The State Supreme Court then reviewed thecontext and substance of the trial judge's comments, and concluded that the comments were not sufficiently final to con-stitute a judgment of acquittal terminating jeopardy. After
the Michigan Supreme Court's decision, respondent discov-ered that the Clerk had made the following entry on the
docket sheet: " `Motions by all atts for directed verdict.Court amended c[oun]t: 1 open murder to 2nd degree murder.' " 292 F. 3d, at 512; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 7. Re-spondent moved the State Supreme Court to reconsider its

A habeas petitioner whose claim was adjudicated on themerits in state court is not entitled to relief in federal court

unless he meets the requirements of 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d).The double jeopardy claim in respondent's habeas petition
arises out of the same set of facts upon which he based hisdirect appeal, and the State Supreme Court's holding that
no double jeopardy violation occurred therefore constitutedan adjudication of this claim on the merits. Thus, under

$ 2254(d), respondent is not entitled to relief unless he candemonstrate that the state court's adjudication of his claim:

Opinion of the Court
"(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, orinvolved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Courtof the United States; or

"(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unrea-sonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding."
Although the Court of Appeals recited this standard, 292F. 3d, at 510, it proceeded to evaluate respondent's claim

denovo rather than through the lens of $ 2254(d), apparently

because it "agree[d] with the district court that whether thestate trial judge acquitted [respondent] of first-degree murder is a question of law and not one of fact." Id., at 511.The Court of Appeals did not consider whether the Michigan
Supreme Court's decision was "contrary to" or an "unreason-able application of " our clearly established precedents, or
whether it was "based on an unreasonable determination ofthe facts." Instead, the Court of Appeals declared:

" `[W]e are not bound by the holding of the MichiganSupreme Court that the trial judge's statements did
not constitute a directed verdict under Michigan law.Instead, we must examine the state trial judge's comments to determine whether he made a ruling whichresolved the factual elements of the first-degree murder
charge.' " Ibid.
The Court of Appeals then concluded that, in its judgment,the state trial court's actions "constituted a grant of an acquittal on the first-degree murder charge such that jeopardyattached," id., at 512, and affirmed.

This was error. As noted above, under $ 2254(d) it mustbe shown that the Michigan Supreme Court's decision was
either contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, thisCourt's clearly established precedents, or was based upon an
unreasonable determination of the facts. The parties do notdispute the underlying facts, and respondent is therefore

Opinion of the Court
entitled to habeas relief only if he can meet one of the two
bases for relief provided in $ 2254(d)(1). We will address
these bases in turn.

First, we have explained that a decision by a state court
is "contrary to" our clearly established law if it "applies a
rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in our
cases" or if it "confronts a set of facts that are materially
indistinguishable from a decision of this Court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from our precedent." Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 405-406 (2000). See also
Early v. Packer, 537 U. S. 3, 7-8 (2002) (per curiam). Here,
the Michigan Supreme Court identified the applicable Supreme Court precedents, United States v. Martin Linen
Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564 (1977), and Smalis v. Pennsylvania, 476 U. S. 140 (1986), and "reaffirm[ed] the principles articulated" in those decisions. People v. Vincent, 455 Mich.,
at 121, 565 N. W. 2d, at 633. Moreover, the Michigan Supreme Court properly followed Martin Linen by recognizing
that the trial judge's characterization of his own ruling is not
controlling for purposes of double jeopardy, and by inquiring
into " `whether the ruling of the [trial] judge, whatever its
label, actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some
or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.' " 455
Mich., at 119, 565 N. W. 2d, at 633 (citing Martin Linen,
supra, at 571). Nowhere did the Michigan Supreme Court
apply a legal standard contrary to those set forth in our
cases. Nor did that court confront a set of facts materially
indistinguishable from those presented in any of this Court's
clearly established precedents. In Smalis and Martin
Linen, unlike in the present case, the trial courts not only
rendered statements of clarity and finality but also entered
formal orders from which appeals were taken. 476 U. S., at
142; 430 U. S., at 566.

Second, respondent can satisfy $ 2254(d) if he can demonstrate that the Michigan Supreme Court's decision involved

641Cite as: 538 U. S. 634 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
an "unreasonable application" of clearly established law. As
we have explained:

"[A] federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply
because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the state-court decision applied [a Supreme
Court case] incorrectly. See Bell v. Cone, 535 U. S. 685,
698-699 (2002); Williams, supra, at 411. Rather, it is
the habeas applicant's burden to show that the state
court applied [that case] to the facts of his case in an
objectively unreasonable manner." Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 24-25 (2002) (per curiam).

Here, having recognized that, under Martin Linen, the trial
judge's characterization of his own ruling was not controlling
for purposes of double jeopardy, the court went on to examine the substance of the judge's actions, to determine
whether "further proceedings would violate the defendant's
double jeopardy rights." People v. Vincent, 455 Mich., at
119, 565 N. W. 2d, at 633. In doing so, the court noted the
goal of the Double Jeopardy Clause to prevent against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. Id., at
120, n. 5, 565 N. W. 2d, at 633, n. 5; see also Martin Linen,
supra, at 569 (noting controlling constitutional principle motivating Double Jeopardy Clause is prohibition against multiple trials and corresponding prevention of oppression by the
Government); Lockhart v. Nelson, 488 U. S. 33, 42 (1988).
The Michigan Supreme Court also considered Smalis, in
which this Court stated:

"[T]he Double Jeopardy Clause bars a postacquittal appeal by the prosecution not only when it might result
in a second trial, but also if reversal would translate
into `further proceedings of some sort, devoted to the
resolution of factual issues going to the elements of the
offense charged.' " 476 U. S., at 145-146 (quoting Martin Linen, supra, at 570).

642 PRICE v. VINCENT

Opinion of the Court
Applying Martin Linen and Smalis, the State Supreme
Court concluded that the judge's comments simply were not
sufficiently final as to terminate jeopardy. People v. Vincent, 455 Mich., at 120, 565 N. W. 2d, at 633 ("[F]urther proceedings were not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause");
id., at 120, n. 5, 565 N. W. 2d, at 633, n. 5 ("[T]he principles
embodied within [double jeopardy] protections were not violated"); id., at 127, 565 N. W. 2d, at 636 (Because "the judge's
comments . . . lacked the requisite degree of clarity and specificity," "the continuation of the trial . . . did not prejudice or
violate the defendant's constitutional rights").

In reaching this conclusion, in addition to reviewing the
context and substance of the trial judge's comments at
length, the Michigan Supreme Court observed that "there
was no formal judgment or order entered on the record."
Ibid.1 The Michigan Supreme Court noted that formal motions or rulings were not required to demonstrate finality as
a matter of Michigan law, but cautioned that "the judgment
must bear sufficient indicia of finality to survive an appeal."
Id., at 126, n. 9, 565 N. W. 2d, at 636, n. 9. The court listed
factors that might be considered in evaluating finality as including "a clear statement in the record or a signed order,"
"an instruction to the jury that a charge or element of the
charge has been dismissed by the judge," or "a docket entry."
Ibid. "[E]ach case," the court said, "will turn on its own
particular circumstances." Ibid. Even after the docket
entry was brought to its attention, the State Supreme Court
adhered to its original decision that, in this case, the trial

1 The Michigan Supreme Court noted that the comments at issue were
never discussed in front of the jury, People v. Vincent, 455 Mich., at 114-
115, n. 1, 565 N. W. 2d, at 631, n. 1, and that the jury was never discharged,
id., at 121, n. 6, 565 N. W. 2d, at 633, n. 6. Moreover, the State Supreme
Court noted, no trial proceedings took place with respondent laboring
under the mistaken impression that he was not facing the possibility of
conviction for first-degree murder. Id., at 114-115, n. 1, 565 N. W. 2d, at
631, n. 1.

Opinion of the Court
judge's comments were not sufficiently final to terminatejeopardy. This was not an objectively unreasonable application of clearly established law as defined by this Court. In-deed, numerous other courts have refused to find double
jeopardy violations under similar circumstances.2 Even ifwe agreed with the Court of Appeals that the Double Jeopardy Clause should be read to prevent continued prosecutionof a defendant under these circumstances, it was at least reasonable for the state court to conclude otherwise.Because respondent did not meet the statutory requirements for habeas relief, the judgment of the Court of Ap-peals is reversed.

It is so ordered.

2 In United States v. LoRusso, 695 F. 2d 45, 54 (1982), for example, the
Second Circuit held that double jeopardy did not bar continued prosecution
on a charge when the judge withdrew an oral grant of a motion to dismiss
a count "[w]here no judgment has been entered . . . and there has been no
dismissal of the jury." In United States v. Byrne, 203 F. 3d 671 (2000),
the Ninth Circuit found no double jeopardy violation where a trial judge
orally granted a motion for acquittal, then agreed to consider an additional
transcript. Id., at 674 ("[T]here was no announcement of the court's decision to the jury, and the trial did not resume until" after the court had
denied the defendant's motion). See also United States v. Baggett, 251
F. 3d 1087, 1095 (CA6 2001) ("Byrne and LoRusso stand for the proposition
that an oral grant of a Rule 29 motion outside of the jury's presence does
not terminate jeopardy, inasmuch as a court is free to change its mind
prior to the entry of judgment"); State v. Iovino, 524 A. 2d 556, 559 (R. I.
1987) (distinguishing United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S.
564 (1977), on the grounds that in the case before it, "the jury remained
impaneled to adjudicate lesser included charges, and that defendant was
not faced with any threat of reprosecution beyond the jury already assembled to hear his case"); State v. Sperry, 149 Ore. App. 690, 696, 945 P. 2d
546, 550 (1997) ("[U]nder the circumstances presented here, the trial court
could reconsider [its oral grant of a motion for a judgment of acquittal]
and withdraw its ruling without violating" the Double Jeopardy Clause).

PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA v. WALSH, ACTINGCOMMISSIONER, MAINE DEPARTMENT

OF HUMAN SERVICES, et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe first circuit

No. 01-188. Argued January 22, 2003--Decided May 19, 2003
A State participating in Medicaid must have a medical assistance plan

approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). In
response to increasing Medicaid expenditures for prescription drugs,
Congress enacted a cost-saving measure in 1990 that requires drug companies to pay rebates to States on their Medicaid purchases. States
have since enacted supplemental rebate programs to achieve additional
cost savings on Medicaid purchases and purchases for other needy citizens. The purpose of the "Maine Rx" Program is to reduce prescription
drug prices for state residents. Under the program, Maine will attempt to negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers. If a company
does not enter into a rebate agreement, its Medicaid sales will be subjected to a "prior authorization" procedure that requires state agency
approval to qualify a doctor's prescription for reimbursement. Petitioner, an association of nonresident drug manufacturers, challenged the
program before its commencement date, claiming that it is pre-empted
by the Medicaid Act and violates the negative Commerce Clause.
Without resolving any factual issues, the District Court entered a preliminary injunction preventing the statute's implementation, concluding,
inter alia, that any obstacle, no matter how modest, to the federal program's administration is sufficient to establish pre-emption. The First
Circuit reversed.

Held: The judgment is affirmed.
249 F. 3d 66, affirmed.

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I, II, III, and VI, concluding that petitioner has not carried its
burden of showing a probability of success on the merits of its Commerce Clause claims. Its arguments--that the rebate requirement constitutes impermissible extraterritorial regulation and that it discriminates against interstate commerce in order to subsidize in-state retail
sales--are unpersuasive. Unlike the price control statute invalidated
in Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U. S. 511, and the price affirma538US2 Unit: $U52 [11-02-04 18:02:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tion statute struck down in Healy v. Beer Institute, 491 U. S. 324, Maine
Rx does not regulate the price of any out-of-state transaction by its
express terms or its inevitable effect. Nor does Maine Rx impose a
disparate burden on out-of-state competitors. A manufacturer cannot
avoid its rebate obligation by opening production facilities in Maine and
would receive no benefit from the rebates even if it did so; the payments
to local pharmacists provide no special benefit to competitors of rebatepaying manufacturers. West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U. S.
186, distinguished. Pp. 668-670.

Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg,
and Justice Breyer, concluded in Parts IV and VII:

(a) The answer to the question before the Court--whether petitioner's showing was sufficient to support the District Court's injunction--
will not determine the validity of Maine's Rx Program since further
proceedings may lead to another result. Moreover, the Secretary may
view Maine Rx as an amendment to its Medicaid Plan that requires his
approval before becoming effective. As the case comes to this Court,
the question is whether there is a probability that Maine's program was
pre-empted by the federal statute's mere existence. Therefore, there
is a presumption that the state statute is valid, and the question asked
is whether petitioner has shouldered the burden of overcoming that presumption. Pp. 660-662.

(b) At this stage of the litigation, petitioner has not carried its burden of showing a probability of success on the merits of its claims.
P. 670.

Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg, concluded in Part V that petitioner's showing is insufficient to
support a finding that the Medicaid Act pre-empts Maine's Rx Program
insofar as it threatens to coerce manufacturers into reducing their prices
on non-Medicaid sales. Petitioner claims that the potential interference
with Medicaid benefits without serving any Medicaid purpose is prohibited by the federal statute. However, petitioner must show that Maine
Rx serves no such goal. In fact, Maine Rx may serve the Medicaidrelated purposes of providing benefits to needy persons and curtailing
the State's Medicaid costs. While these purposes would not provide a
sufficient basis for upholding the program if it severely curtailed Medicaid recipients' prescription drug access, the District Court erred in assuming that even a modest impediment to such access would invalidate
the program. The Medicaid Act gives States substantial discretion to
choose the proper mix of amount, scope, and duration limitations on
coverage as long as care and services are provided in the recipients'
best interests. Alexander v. Choate, 469 U. S. 287, 303. That a State's
decision to curtail Medicaid benefits may have been motivated by a state

policy unrelated to the Medicaid Act does not limit the scope of its broad
discretion to define the benefits package it will finance. See Beal v.
Doe, 432 U. S. 438. The presumption against federal pre-emption of a
state statute designed to foster public health has special force when it
appears, and the Secretary has not decided to the contrary, that the
two governments are pursuing common purposes. At this stage of the
proceeding, the severity of any impediment that Maine's program may
impose on a Medicaid patient's access to the drug of her choice is a
matter of conjecture. Thus, the First Circuit correctly resolved the
pre-emption issue. Pp. 662-668.

Justice Breyer concluded that petitioner cannot obtain a preliminary injunction simply by showing minimal or quite modest harm even
though Maine offered no evidence of countervailing Medicaid-related
benefit. Proper determination of the pre-emption question will demand
a more careful balancing of Medicaid-related harms and benefits than
the District Court undertook. Thus, its technical misstatement of the
proper legal standard should not be overlooked. Vacating the injunction will also help ensure that the District Court takes account of the
Secretary's views in further proceedings, which is important since HHS
administers Medicaid and is better able than a court to assemble relevant facts and to make relevant predictions, and since the law grants
significant weight to the Secretary's legal conclusions about whether
Maine's program is consistent with Medicaid's objectives. Under the
Medicaid Act, Maine may obtain those views when it files its plan with
HHS for approval. In addition, a court may "refer" a question to the
Secretary under the legal doctrine of "primary jurisdiction," which
seeks to produce better informed and uniform legal rulings by allowing
courts to take advantage of an agency's specialized knowledge, expertise, and central position within a regulatory regime. Where, as here,
certain conditions are satisfied, see Far East Conference v. United
States, 342 U. S. 570, 574-575, a court may raise the doctrine on its own
motion. A court may then stay its proceedings to allow a party to
initiate agency review. Even if Maine chooses not to obtain the Secretary's views on its own, the desirability of the District Court's having
those views to consider is relevant to the "public interest" determination
that often factors into whether a preliminary injunction should issue.
Pp. 670-674.

Justice Scalia concluded that petitioner's statutory claim should be
rejected on the ground that the remedy for the State's failure to comply
with its Medicaid Act obligations is set forth in the Act itself: termination of funding by the Secretary. Petitioner must seek enforcement of
Medicaid conditions by that authority and may obtain relief in the courts

Justice Thomas concluded that Maine Rx is not pre-empted by the
Medicaid Act. The premise of petitioner's pre-emption claim is that
Maine Rx is "an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the
full purposes and objectives of Congress." Hines v. Davidowitz, 312
U. S. 52, 67. The Medicaid Act represents a delicate balance between
competing interests, e. g., care and cost. It grants States broad discretion to impose prior authorization, and proper consideration of the Secretary's role in administering the Act forecloses petitioner's pre-emption
claim. The Act provides a complete list of the restrictions participating
States may place on prescription drug coverage. 42 U. S. C. $ 1396r-
8(d)(1). The only stricture on a prior authorization program is compliance with certain procedures, $ 1396r-8(d)(5). The purpose of $ 1396r-
8(d)(1) is its effect--to grant participating States authority to subject
drugs to prior authorization subject only to $ 1396r-8(d)(5)'s express limitations. In light of the broad grant of discretion to States to impose
prior authorization, petitioner cannot produce a credible conflict between Maine Rx and the Medicaid Act. Given the Secretary's authority
to administer and interpret the Medicaid Act, petitioner can prevail on
its view that the Medicaid Act pre-empts Maine Rx and renders it void
under the Supremacy Clause only by showing that the Medicaid Act is
unambiguous or that Congress has directly addressed the issue. See
Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467
U. S. 837, 842. However, the Act's text cannot be read in such a way.
Indeed, the Secretary has adopted an interpretation of the Act that
does not preclude States from negotiating prices for non-Medicaid drug
purchases. Obstacle pre-emption's very premise is that Congress has
not expressly displaced state law and therefore not directly spoken to
the pre-emption question. Therefore, where an agency is charged with
administering a federal statute, as the Secretary is here, Chevron imposes a perhaps-insurmountable barrier to an obstacle pre-emption
claim. Pp. 675-683.

state legislatures have enacted supplemental rebate pro-grams to achieve additional cost savings on Medicaid purchases as well as for purchases made by other needy citizens.The "Maine Rx" program, enacted in 2000, is primarily intended to provide discounted prescription drugs to Maine'suninsured citizens but its coverage is open to all residents of
the State. Under the program, Maine will attempt to nego-tiate rebates with drug manufacturers to fund the reduced
price for drugs offered to Maine Rx participants. If adrug company does not enter into a rebate agreement, its

AMERICA v. WALSH

Opinion of the Court

Medicaid sales will be subjected to a "prior authorization"
procedure.

In this case, an association of nonresident drug manufacturers has challenged the constitutionality of the Maine Rx
Program, claiming that the program is pre-empted by the
federal Medicaid statute and that it violates the negative
Commerce Clause. The association has not alleged that the
program denies Medicaid patients meaningful access to prescription drugs or that it has excluded any drugs from access
to the market in Maine. Instead, it contends that the program imposes a significant burden on Medicaid recipients
by requiring prior authorization in certain circumstances
without serving any valid Medicaid purpose, and that the
program effectively regulates out-of-state commerce. The
District Court sustained both challenges and entered a preliminary injunction preventing implementation of the statute. The Court of Appeals reversed, and we granted certiorari because the questions presented are of national
importance. 536 U. S. 956 (2002).

I
Congress created the Medicaid program in 1965 by adding
Title XIX to the Social Security Act.2 The program authorizes federal financial assistance to States that choose to reimburse certain costs of medical treatment for needy persons.
In order to participate in the Medicaid program, a State must
have a plan for medical assistance approved by the Secretary
of Health and Human Services (Secretary). 42 U. S. C.

provide coverage for the "categorically needy" 4 and, at theState's option, may also cover the "medically needy."

5

Prior to 1990, the Medicaid statute did not specifically ad-dress outpatient prescription drug coverage. The Secretary's regulations and guidelines "set upper limits on eachState's aggregate expenditures for drugs."

6 Under plans

approved by the Secretary, some States designed and admin-istered their own formularies, listing the drugs that they

would cover. States also employed "prior authorization pro-grams" that required approval by a state agency to qualify
a doctor's prescription for reimbursement. See, e. g., Dodson v. Parham, 427 F. Supp. 97, 100-101 (ND Ga. 1977)("Georgia has historically administered its prescription drug

program on the basis of a drug `formulary' or, in other words,a restricted list of drugs for which Medicaid will reimburse
provider pharmacists. Thus, any drug not specifically in-cluded on the list will not be reimbursed unless prior approval is granted by [the administrator of Georgia Medicaidprogram]");

Opinion of the Court

California Medicaid program only after prior authorization).These programs were not specifically governed by any federal law or regulations, but rather were made part of theState Medicaid plans and approved by the Secretary because
they aided in controlling Medicaid costs.7Congress effectively ratified the Secretary's practice of approving state plans containing prior authorization require-ments when it created its rebate program in an amendment
contained in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990(OBRA 1990).

8 The new program had two basic parts.

First, it imposed a general requirement that, in order toqualify for Medicaid payments, drug companies must enter

into agreements either with the Secretary or, if authorizedby the Secretary, with individual States, to provide rebates
on their Medicaid sales of outpatient prescription drugs.9The rebate on a "single source drug" or an "innovator multiple source drug" is the difference between the manufactur-er's average price and its "best price," or 15.1% of the average manufacturer price, whichever is greater. 42 U. S. C.$$ 1396r-8(c)(1), (2). The rebate for other drugs is 11.1% of
the average manufacturer price. See $ 1396r-8(c)(3).Second, once a drug manufacturer enters into a rebate
agreement, the law requires the State to provide coveragefor that drug under its plan unless the State complies with
one of the exclusion or restriction provisions in the MedicaidAct. See $ 1396r-8(d). For example, a State may exclude

7 "Before 1990, States had routinely required prior authorization for prescription or dispensing of drugs in order to control Medicaid costs . . . .
In enacting the drug rebate provisions of Section 1396r-8 in 1990, Congress did not intend to upset that practice." Brief in Opposition for
United States as Amicus Curiae 14-15.

8 104 Stat. 1388-143.

9 The statute authorizes payment for some drugs not covered by rebate

agreements if a State determines that their availability is essential to the
health of beneficiaries, if they have been given a special rating by the
Federal Food and Drug Administration, and if a doctor has obtained prior
authorization for their use. See 42 U. S. C. $ 1396r-8(a)(3).

Opinion of the Court
coverage of drugs such as "[a]gents . . . used for cosmeticpurposes or hair growth." $ 1396r-8(d)(2)(C).

Most relevant to this case, Congress allowed States, "as acondition of coverage or payment for a covered outpatient
drug," $ 1396r-8(d)(5), to require approval of the drug beforeit is dispensed. Thus, under OBRA 1990, except for a
narrow category of new drugs,10 "[a] State may subject toprior authorization any covered outpatient drug," $ 1396r-
8(d)(1)(A), so long as the State's prior authorization program(1) provides a response by telephone or other telecommunication device within 24 hours of a request for prior authoriza-tion, and, (2) except for the listed excludable drugs, provides
for the dispensing of at least a 72-hour supply of a covereddrug in an emergency situation, see $ 1396r-8(d)(5).

In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993,11 Con-gress further amended the Act to allow the States to use
formularies subject to strict limitations. That amendmentexpressly stated that a prior authorization program that
complies with the 24-hour and 72-hour conditions is not sub-ject to the limitations imposed on formularies.

12 The 1993

amendment reenacted the provisions for state prior authori-zation programs that had been included in OBRA 1990, omitting, however, the narrow exception for new drugs.

2002). The statute provides that "the State [shall] act as apharmacy benefit manager in order to make prescription

drugs more affordable for qualified Maine residents, therebyincreasing the overall health of Maine residents, promoting
healthy communities and protecting the public health andwelfare." $ 2681(1). The program is intended to enable individuals to buy drugs from retail pharmacies at a discountroughly equal to the rebate on Medicaid purchases. See

$ 2681(4).The statute provides that any manufacturer or "labeler"

13

selling drugs in Maine through any publicly supported fi-nancial assistance program "shall enter into a rebate agreement" with the State Commissioner of Human Services(Commissioner). $ 2681(3). The Commissioner is directed
to use his best efforts to obtain a rebate that is at least equalto the rebate calculated under the federal program created
pursuant to OBRA 1990. See $ 2681(4). Rebates are to bepaid into a fund administered by the Commissioner, and then
distributed to participating pharmacies to compensate themfor selling at discounted prices. $ 2681(6).

For those manufacturers that do not enter into rebateagreements, there are two consequences: First, their nonparticipation is information that the Department of HumanServices must release "to health care providers and the public." $ 2681(7). Second, and more importantly for our pur-poses, the "department shall impose prior authorization requirements in the Medicaid program under this Title, aspermitted by law, for the dispensing of prescription drugs
provided by those [nonparticipating] manufacturers and la-belers."

14 The proposed rules also explain that Maine intends to appoint a "Drug Utilization Review Committee,"composed of physicians and pharmacists who will evaluate

each drug manufactured by a company that has declined toenter into a rebate agreement to decide whether it is clinically appropriate to subject the drug to prior authorization.15The State represents that it "certainly will not subject any
single-source drug that fulfills a unique therapeutic functionto the prior authorization process" even if its manufacturer
does not enter into a rebate agreement.16 The determina-tion "whether a particular drug should be subjected to a
prior authorization requirement will be based firmly uponconsiderations of medical necessity, and in compliance with
the State's responsibilities as the administrator of the MaineMedicaid Program."

656 PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MFRS. OF

AMERICA v. WALSH

Opinion of the Court

Although 27 individual manufacturers elected to participateby executing the proposed agreement, petitioner, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, an asso-ciation representing manufacturers that "account for more
than 75 percent of brand name drug sales in the UnitedStates,"

19 responded by bringing this action challenging the

validity of the statute. Its complaint was accompanied bya motion for a preliminary injunction, supported by seven

affidavits.Four of the affidavits describe the nature of the association
and the companies' methods of distribution, emphasizing thefact that, with the exception of sales to two resident distributors, all of their prescription drug sales occur outside ofMaine.

20 Three of them comment on the operation of prior

authorization programs administered by private managedcare organizations, describing their actual and potential adverse impact on both manufacturers and patients. Thus,one executive stated: "Imposition of a prior authorization
[(PA)] requirement with respect to a particular drug se-verely curtails access to the drug for covered patients and
sharply reduces the drug's market share and sales, as thePA causes a shift of patients to competing drugs of other
manufacturers that are not subject to a PA. Because a PAimposes additional procedural burdens on physicians prescribing the manufacturer's drug and retail pharmacies dis-pensing it, the effect of a PA is to diminish the manufacturer's goodwill that helped foster demand for its drug overcompeting drugs produced by other manufacturers, and to
shift physician and patient loyalty to those competing drugs,perhaps permanently."

21 Another affidavit described how

prior authorization by a managed care organization in Ne-vada had sharply reduced the market share of four of SmithKline's drugs. For example, the market share of Aug19 Id., at 37 (Complaint || 6).

mentin, a drug used to treat bacterial infections, declinedfrom 49% to 18% in the six months after the program was

imposed.22 In the third affidavit, Dr. Howell of SmithKlineBeecham Corporation expressed the opinion that prior authorization had never been required in one program "for thepurpose of influencing the manufacturer's pricing behavior
in another program," and that such use, "without regard tosafety or efficacy, will lead to drugs being prescribed that
are less safe and efficacious." 23Respondents' opposition to the motion was supported by
Concannon's own affidavit and the affidavits of two doctors.They do not dispute the factual assertions concerning the
impact of prior authorization on the drug companies' marketshares, but instead comment on the benefits of prior authorization for patients. The State's Medicaid Medical Director,
Dr. Clifford, explained that "[p]hysicians in Maine are al-ready well acquainted with the extensive prior authorization

programs of the four HMO/Insurance programs which collectively cover nearly half the state's residents" and that theState had taken steps to "ensure that physicians will always

be able to prescribe the safest and most efficacious drugs fortheir Medicaid patients."

ear infections 80%-85% of the time, and that Augmentin was

often employed by managed care organizations (`MCOs') to enforce a drug
formulary and is usually intended to limit the drugs to be prescribed by
health care professionals. MCOs typically require health care professionals to obtain prior authorization from the MCO before prescribing a drug
(1) to ensure proper use of prescription drugs with a high potential for
inappropriate use, (2) to limit the use of prescription drugs with severe or
life threatening side effects and/or drug interactions; and (3) to encourage
the use of cost-effective medications without diminishing safety or efficacy." Id., at 102-103.

"3 to 6 times as expensive" as amoxicillin.25 Concannon'saffidavit described the composition of a committee of physicians and pharmacists that would "make the final determina-tion of the clinical appropriateness of any recommendation
that a prior authorization requirement be imposed with re-spect to a particular prescription drug manufactured by a
manufacturer which has not entered into a Maine Rx Re-bate Agreement."

26

Without resolving any factual issues, the District Courtgranted petitioner's motion for a preliminary injunction.

Relying on Healy v. Beer Institute, 491 U. S. 324, 336 (1989),
the court first held that Maine had no power to regulate theprices paid to drug manufacturers in transactions that occur

out of the State. Recognizing that some of their sales weremade to two distributors in Maine, the court further held
that the Medicaid Act pre-empted Maine's Rx Program inso-far as it threatened to impose a prior authorization requirement on nonparticipating manufacturers. In so holding, the
court assumed for the purpose of the decision that the " `De-partment of Human Services will not deny a single Medicaid

recipient access to the safest and most efficacious prescrip-tion drug therapy indicated for their individual medical circumstances.' " 27 In that court's view, pre-emption was nev-ertheless required because "Maine can point to no

Medicaid
purpose in this new prior authorization requirement thatMaine has added for Medicaid prescription drugs. Maine

has not just passed a law that might conflict with the objec-tives of a federal law. It has actually taken the federal Medicaid program and altered it to serve Maine's local pur-poses."

benefit of uninsured citizens, then it can just as easily put the rebates into

Opinion of the Court
alteration served purposes outside the scope of the Medicaidprogram and created an obstacle to the administration of the

federal program was sufficient to establish pre-emption: "Nomatter how modest an obstacle the new prior authorization
amounts to (the parties disagree on the severity of the obsta-cle), it is an obstacle--drugs on the list must be approved
by the state Medicaid Medical Director before they can bedispensed . . . ."

29

The Court of Appeals disagreed with the District Court'sanalysis of the pre-emption issue for three reasons. First,

since the federal statute expressly authorizes use of priorauthorization, it found "no conflict between the Maine Act
and Medicaid's structure and purpose." 249 F. 3d 66, 75(CA1 2001). In its view, as long as there is compliance with
the federal 24- and 72-hour conditions, the State's motivationfor imposing the requirement is irrelevant. Second, given
the absence of an actual conflict, the court found that themere fact that Maine Rx "fails to directly advance the purpose of the federal program" is an insufficient basis for"inflicting the `strong medicine' of preemption" on a state
statute. Id., at 76. Third, the court further stated that, as-suming the relevance of the State's motivation, "the Maine
Rx Program furthers Medicaid's aim of providing medicalservices to those whose `income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services,' 42U. S. C. $ 1396, even if the individuals covered by the Maine
Rx Program are not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid."Ibid. Moreover, the court held that there is evidence that
making prescription drugs more accessible to the uninsuredmay keep some of them off Medicaid thereby minimizing the
State's Medicaid expenditures.The Court of Appeals also reviewed the affidavits and concluded that they "fall short of establishing that the Act will
a state program for highway and bridge construction or school funding."

might affect the quality of medical care for Medicaid recipi-ents in subtle ways, such as inconveniencing prescribing physicians. It therefore expressly preserved petitioner's rightto renew its pre-emption challenge after implementation of
the program "should there be evidence that Medicaid recipi-ents are harmed by the prior authorization requirement `as
applied.' " Ibid. The Court also found no violation of thedormant Commerce Clause and vacated the temporary injunction, but stayed its mandate pending our review of thecase.

The question before us is whether the District Courtabused its discretion when it entered the preliminary injunction. See Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422 U. S. 922, 931-932(1975). By no means will our answer to that question finally
determine the validity of Maine's Rx Program. The DistrictCourt did not conduct an evidentiary hearing and did not
resolve any factual disputes raised by the affidavits filed bythe parties. Accordingly, no matter how we answer the
question whether petitioner's showing was sufficient to sup-port the injunction, further proceedings in this case may lead
to a contrary result.Moreover, there is also a possibility that the Secretary
may view the Maine Rx Program as an amendment to itsMedicaid Plan that requires his approval before it becomes
effective.30 While the petition for certiorari was pending,

30 We note that CMS, acting on behalf of the Secretary, see n. 3, supra,
sent a letter on September 18, 2002, to all of the state Medicaid directors.
In that letter, the CMS Director indicated that "the establishment of a
prior authorization program for Medicaid covered drugs to secure drug
benefits, rebates, or discounts for non-Medicaid populations is a significant
component of a State plan and we would therefore expect that a State

Opinion of Stevens, J.
the United States filed a brief recommending that we denyreview, in part because further proceedings may clarify the

issues. Its brief cautioned against the adoption of a ruleprohibiting prior authorization programs whenever they operate in part to benefit a non-Medicaid population, and sug-gested that a program tailored to benefit needy persons who
are not Medicaid-eligible might advance Medicaid-related
goals.31 That brief, however, as well as the Federal Govern-ment's brief filed after we granted review, expressed the

opinion that, because Maine's program was adopted withoutthe Secretary's approval and was open to all Maine residents
regardless of financial need, it was not tailored to achieveMedicaid-related goals and was therefore invalid. Like the
interlocutory judicial rulings in this case, we assume that amore complete understanding of all the relevant facts might
lead to a modification of the views expressed in those briefs.In all events, we must confront the issues without the benefit
of either a complete record or any dispositive ruling by the
Secretary.

The issue we confront is, of course, quite different from
the question that would be presented if the Secretary, after
a hearing, had held that the Maine Rx Program was an impermissible amendment of its Medicaid Plan. In such event,
the Secretary's ruling would be presumptively valid. As
the case comes to us, however, the question is whether there
is a probability that Maine's program was pre-empted by the
mere existence of the federal statute. We start therefore
with a presumption that the state statute is valid, see Davies
Warehouse Co. v. Bowles, 321 U. S. 144, 153 (1944), and ask

whether petitioner has shouldered the burden of overcomingthat presumption.

V
The centerpiece of petitioner's attack on Maine's Rx Pro-gram is its allegedly unique use of a threat to impose a prior

authorization requirement on Medicaid sales to coerce manu-facturers into reducing their prices on sales to non-Medicaid
recipients. Petitioner argues, and the District Court held,that the potential interference with the delivery of Medicaid
benefits without any benefit to the federal program is prohib-ited by the federal statute. In accepting this argument, the
District Court relied heavily on the fact that Maine hadfailed to identify any "Medicaid purpose" in its new authorization requirement. It appears that Maine had argued be-fore the District Court that such a purpose was unnecessary
because the federal statute expressly authorizes what ithas done.

In this Court, petitioner argues that it could not have beenan abuse of discretion for the District Court to decide the
case on the assumption that the program will serve no Med-icaid purpose, even if that assumption is erroneous, given
that the State, insisting that no such purpose was necessary,offered no Medicaid purpose in its opposition to the motion
for a temporary injunction. To the extent that petitioner isrelying on a waiver theory, such reliance is inappropriate
because the State never represented that there was no Med-icaid purpose served by its program; it simply argued that it
did not need to offer one. Regardless of the legal positiontaken by the State, petitioner bore the burden of establishing, by a clear showing, a probability of success on the mer-its. See

Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U. S. 968, 972 (1997)(per curiam); cf. Benten v. Kessler, 505 U. S. 1084, 1085

(1992) (per curiam) (requiring movant to demonstrate a sub-stantial likelihood of success on the merits). Accordingly, it
was petitioner's burden to show that there was no Medicaid-related goal or purpose served by Maine Rx. Given that

Opinion of Stevens, J.
burden, if the program on its face clearly serves someMedicaid-related goals, it would follow that the District

Court's evaluation rested on an erroneous predicate. Weare persuaded that there are three such goals plainly present
in the Maine Rx Program.The Court of Appeals identified two Medicaid-related interests that will be served if the program is successful andrebates become available on sales to uninsured individuals.
First, the program will provide medical benefits to personswho can be described as "medically needy" even if they do
not qualify for AFDC or SSI benefits. There is some factualdispute concerning the extent to which the program will also
benefit nonneedy persons, but even if the program is moreinclusive than the Secretary thinks it should be, the potential
benefits for nonneedy persons would not nullify the benefitsthat would be provided to the neediest segment of the uninsured population.32 Second, there is the possibility that, byenabling some borderline aged and infirm persons better access to prescription drugs earlier, Medicaid expenses will bereduced. If members of this borderline group are not able
to purchase necessary prescription medicine, their conditionsmay worsen, causing further financial hardship and thus
making it more likely that they will end up in the Medicaidprogram and require more expensive treatment.

A third rather obvious Medicaid purpose will be fosteredwhenever it is necessary to impose the prior authorization
requirement on a manufacturer that refuses to participate.As the record demonstrates, private managed care organizations typically require prior authorization both to protect pa-tients from inappropriate prescriptions and "to encourage
the use of cost-effective medications without diminishing

32 We note in this regard that it is estimated that almost two-thirds of
the nonelderly uninsured are low-income individuals or come from lowincome families making less than 200% of the federal poverty level. See
Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, The Uninsured: A
Primer 2 (Mar. 2001).

safety or efficacy." 33 No doubt that is why Congress expressly preserved the States' ability to adopt that practice
when it passed the Medicaid amendments in 1990.34 The
fact that prior authorization actually does produce substantial cost savings for organizations purchasing large volumes
of drugs is apparent both from the affidavits in the record
describing the impact of such programs on manufacturers'
market shares and from the results of a program adopted in
Florida. See Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America v. Meadows, 304 F. 3d 1197 (CA11 2002).35
Avoiding unnecessary costs in the administration of a State's
Medicaid program obviously serves the interests of both the
Federal Government and the States that pay the cost of providing prescription drugs to Medicaid patients.

The fact that the Maine Rx Program may serve Medicaidrelated purposes, both by providing benefits to needy persons and by curtailing the State's Medicaid costs, would not

33 See n. 23, supra.
34 "As under current law, States would have the option of imposing prior

authorization requirements with respect to covered prescription drugs in
order to safeguard against unnecessary utilization and assure that payments are consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care." H. R.
Rep. No. 101-881, p. 98 (1990).

35 "The new Florida law . . . exempts certain Medicaid-eligible drugs

from a `prior authorization' requirement. If a drug is not on the preferred
list, the prescribing doctor must call a state pharmacist to obtain approval
of its use. In the course of this procedure, the pharmacist informs the
doctor of the availability of other drugs (usually on the preferred drug
list) that allegedly have comparable therapeutic value but are less expensive. The actual phone calls tend to be relatively brief (usually less than
10 minutes in length), and approval of the prescribing doctor's first-choice
drug is guaranteed in 100 percent of all cases, provided only that he or she
make the telephone call. During the first three months of the program,
approximately 55 percent of all these calls have resulted in a change of
the prescription to a drug on the preferred drug list. Naturally, because
this procedure may tend to promote less profitable drugs at the expense
of more profitable ones, it is not favored by the pharmaceutical manufacturers that brought this lawsuit." 304 F. 3d, at 1198.

provide a sufficient basis for upholding the program if it severely curtailed Medicaid recipients' access to prescription
drugs. Cf. 42 U. S. C. $ 1396a(a)(19) (State Medicaid plan
must assure that care and services are to be provided "in a
manner consistent with . . . the best interests of the recipients"). It was, however, incorrect for the District Court to
assume that any impediment, "[n]o matter how modest," to
a patient's ability to obtain the drug of her choice at state
expense would invalidate the Maine Rx Program. Civ.
No. 00-157-B-H, App. to Pet. for Cert. 68.

We have made it clear that the Medicaid Act "gives the
States substantial discretion to choose the proper mix of
amount, scope, and duration limitations on coverage, as long
as care and services are provided in `the best interest of the
recipients.' " Alexander v. Choate, 469 U. S. 287, 303 (1985).
In that case, we rejected a challenge brought by a class of
handicapped persons to a Tennessee cost-saving measure
that reduced the number of annual days of inpatient hospital
care for Medicaid patients from 20 to 14, emphasizing that
the change did not deny beneficiaries "meaningful access"
to medical services. Id., at 302, 306. The District Court's
finding that the 14-day limitation would fully serve 95% of
handicapped individuals eligible for Medicaid satisfied the
statutory standard.

In this case, the District Court made no comparable finding, but assumed that Maine would fully comply with all federal requirements and "not deny a single Medicaid recipient
access to the safest and most efficacious prescription drug
therapy indicated for their [sic] individual medical circumstances." 36 The District Court's assumption gave appropriate credence to the affidavits filed on behalf of the State,
and, under our reasoning in Alexander, reflects compliance
with the statutory standard.

AMERICA v. WALSH

Opinion of Stevens, J.

The fact that a State's decision to curtail Medicaid benefitsmay have been motivated by a state policy unrelated to the

Medicaid Act does not limit the scope of its broad discretionto define the package of benefits it will finance. In Beal v.
Doe, 432 U. S. 438 (1977), despite accepting the plaintiffs'submission that nontherapeutic abortions are both less dangerous and less expensive than childbirth, we held that Penn-sylvania's interest in encouraging normal childbirth provided
an adequate justification for its decision to exclude the abor-tion procedure from its Medicaid program. Maine's interest
in protecting the health of its uninsured residents also pro-vides a plainly permissible justification for a prior authorization requirement that is assumed to have only a minimal im-pact on Medicaid recipients' access to prescription drugs.
The Medicaid Act contains no categorical prohibition againstreliance on state interests unrelated to the Medicaid program
itself when a State is fashioning the particular contours ofits own program. It retains the "considerable latitude" that
characterizes optional participation in a jointly financed ben-efit program.

The presumption against federal pre-emption of a statestatute desig ned to foster public health, Hillsborough

County v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U. S.707, 715-718 (1985), has special force when it appears, and
the Secretary has not decided to the contrary, that the twogovernments are pursuing "common purposes," New York
State Dept. of Social Servs. v. Dublino, 413 U. S. 405, 421(1973). In Dublino, we rejected a pre-emption challenge to
a state statute that imposed employment requirements asconditions for continued eligibility for AFDC benefits that

(footnotes omitted).

New York's interest in encouraging employment of its citi-zens, we wrote:

"To the extent that the Work Rules embody New York'sattempt to promote self-reliance and civic responsibility,
to assure that limited state welfare funds be spent onbehalf of those genuinely incapacitated and most in
need, and to cope with the fiscal hardships envelopingmany state and local governments, this Court should
not lightly interfere. The problems confronting our so-ciety in these areas are severe, and state governments,
in cooperation with the Federal Government, mustbe allowed considerable latitude in attempting their
resolution." Id., at 413.
The mere fact that the New York program imposed a nonfederal obstacle to continued eligibility for benefits did not pro-vide a sufficient basis for pre-emption, but we left open questions concerning possible conflicts with the federal programfor resolution in further proceedings.

Id., at 422- 423.
Similarly, in this case, the mere fact that prior authoriza-tion may impose a modest impediment to access to prescription drugs provided at government expense does not provide
a sufficient basis for pre-emption of the entire Maine RxProgram.

At this stage of the proceeding, the severity of any impedi-ment that Maine's program may impose on a Medicaid patient's access to the drug of her choice is a matter of con-jecture. To the extent that drug manufacturers agree to
participate in the program, there will be no impediment. Tothe extent that the manufacturers refuse, the Drug Utilization Review Committee will determine whether it is clinically appropriate to subject those drugs to prior authorization. If the committee determines prior authorization is
required, that requirement may result in the delivery of a
less expensive drug than a physician first prescribed, but on
the present record we cannot conclude that a significant

Opinion of the Court

number of patients' medical needs--indeed, any patient'smedical needs--will be adversely affected.

The record does demonstrate that prior authorization maywell have a significant adverse impact on the manufacturers
of brand name prescription drugs and that it will imposesome administrative costs on physicians. The impact on
manufacturers is not relevant because any transfer of busi-ness to less expensive products will produce savings for the
Medicaid program. The impact on doctors may be signifi-cant if it produces an administrative burden that affects the
quality of their treatment of patients, but no such effect hasbeen proved. Moreover, given doctors' familiarity with the
extensive use of prior authorization in the private sector,any such effect seems unlikely.

We therefore agree with the Court of Appeals' resolutionof the pre-emption issue based on the record before us. We
again reiterate that the question whether the Secretary's ap-proval must be sought before Maine Rx Program may go
into effect is not before us. Along these same lines, we offerno view as to whether it would be appropriate for the Secretary to disapprove this program if Maine had asked the Sec-retary to review it. We also offer no view as to whether it
would be proper for the Secretary to disallow funding forthe Maine Medicaid program if Maine fails to seek approval
from the Secretary of its Maine Rx Program. Based on theCMS letter of September 18, 2002,

38 it appears that the Secretary is likely to take some action with respect to this pro-gram. Until the Secretary does, however, we cannot predict

at this preliminary stage the ultimate fate of the Maine RxProgram, and we limit our holding accordingly.

VI
Whereas petitioner's pre-emption challenge focused on theeffects of the prior authorization requirement that would fol38 See n. 30, supra.

538US2 Unit: $U52 [11-02-04 18:02:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
low a manufacturer's refusal to participate in the Rx Pro-gram, its Commerce Clause challenge focuses on the effects

of the rebate agreements that will follow manufacturer com-pliance with the program. As we understand the challenge,
the alleged harm to interstate commerce would be the sameregardless of whether manufacturer compliance is completely voluntary or the product of coercion. Petitioner
argues, first, that the rebate requirement constitutes im-permissible extraterritorial regulation, and second, that it

discriminates against interstate commerce in order to subsi-dize in-state retail sales. Neither argument is persuasive.

Writing for the Court in Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc.,
294 U. S. 511, 521 (1935), Justice Cardozo made the classic
observation that "New York has no power to project its legislation into Vermont by regulating the price to be paid in
that state for milk acquired there." That proposition provided the basis for the majority's conclusion in Healy v. Beer
Institute, 491 U. S. 324 (1989), that a Massachusetts price
affirmation statute had the impermissible effect of regulating
the price of beer sold in neighboring States. Petitioner argues that the reasoning in those cases applies to what it
characterizes as Maine's regulation of the terms of transactions that occur elsewhere. But, as the Court of Appeals
correctly stated, unlike price control or price affirmation
statutes, "the Maine Act does not regulate the price of any
out-of-state transaction, either by its express terms or by its
inevitable effect. Maine does not insist that manufacturers
sell their drugs to a wholesaler for a certain price. Similarly, Maine is not tying the price of its in-state products to
out-of-state prices." 249 F. 3d, at 81-82 (footnote omitted).
The rule that was applied in Baldwin and Healy accordingly
is not applicable to this case.

In West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U. S. 186
(1994), we reviewed the constitutionality of a Massachusetts
pricing order that imposed an assessment on all fluid milk
sold by dealers to Massachusetts retailers and distributed

the proceeds to Massachusetts dairy farmers. Becausetwo-thirds of the assessed milk was produced by out-of-state

farmers while the entire fund was used to benefit in-statefarmers, the order effectively imposed a tax on out-of-state
producers to subsidize production by their in-state competi-tors. We concluded that the program was invalid because it
had a discriminatory effect analogous to a protective tariffthat taxes goods imported from neighboring States but does
not tax similar products produced locally.Petitioner argues that Maine's Rx fund is similar because
it would be created entirely from rebates paid by out-of-statemanufacturers and would be used to subsidize sales by local
pharmacists to local consumers. Unlike the situation in
West Lynn, however, the Maine Rx Program will not imposea disparate burden on any competitors. A manufacturer

could not avoid its rebate obligation by opening productionfacilities in Maine and would receive no benefit from the rebates even if it did so; the payments to the local pharmacistsprovide no special benefit to competitors of rebate-paying
manufacturers. The rule that was applied in West Lynn isthus not applicable to this case.

VII
At this stage of the litigation, petitioner has not carriedits burden of showing a probability of success on the merits

of its claims. And petitioner has not argued that the Courtof Appeals was incorrect in holding that other factors--such
as the risk of irreparable harm, the balance of the equities,and the public interest--do not alter the analysis of its injunction request. The judgment of the Court of Appeals isaffirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Breyer, concurring in part and concurring inthe judgment.

I join Parts I-III and Part VI of the Court's opinion andParts IV and VII of the plurality's opinion. I also agree

with Part V's conclusion. The District Court's entry of apreliminary injunction rested upon a determination that federal Medicaid law pre-empted the Maine Rx Program as longas Maine's prior authorization program posed some obstacle,
" `[n]o matter how modest,' " to realizing federal Medicaidgoals.

Ante, at 659 (majority opinion) (emphasis added).
Like the plurality, I believe that the italicized phrase understates the strength of the showing that the law required peti-tioner to make.

Ante, at 667.
To prevail, petitioner ultimately must demonstrate thatMaine's program would "seriously compromise important

federal interests." Arkansas Elec. Cooperative Corp. v.
Arkansas Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 461 U. S. 375, 389 (1983).
Cf. Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U. S. 397, 422-423 (1970). Petitioner consequently cannot obtain a preliminary injunction simply by showing minimal or quite "modest" harm--

even though Maine offered no evidence of countervailing
Medicaid-related benefit, post, at 687-688 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The relevant statutory language, after all, expressly permits prior authorization programs, 42 U. S. C. $ 1396r-8(d)(1), and Congress may
well have believed that such programs, in general, help Medicaid by generating savings. See ante, at 651-653, and n. 7
(majority opinion). That being so, Congress would not have
intended to forbid prior authorization programs virtually per
se--i. e., on the showing of slight harm--even if no specific
Medicaid-related benefit is apparent in a particular case.

I recognize that petitioner presented evidence to the District Court that could have justified a stronger conclusion.
E. g., App. 57, 103-104. Cf. Brief for Legal Services Organizations Representing Medicaid Beneficiaries as Amici Curiae 14. Yet the District Court's preliminary injunction
nonetheless rests upon premises that subsequent developments have made clear are unrealistic. For one thing, despite Maine's initial failure to argue the matter, Maine's program may further certain Medicaid-related objectives, at

least to some degree. Ante, at 663-665 (plurality opinion).
For another, the Secretary of Health and Human Services
(whose views are highly relevant to the question before us,
infra this page) has indicated that state programs somewhat
similar to Maine's may prove consistent with Medicaid objectives, and the Secretary has approved at least one such program. Ante, at 660-661, n. 30 (plurality opinion); Letter
from Theodore B. Olson, Solicitor General, to William K.
Suter, Clerk of the Court (Jan. 10, 2003). As a result, it is
now apparent that proper determination of the pre-emption
question will demand a more careful balancing of Medicaidrelated harms and benefits than the District Court undertook. Cf. California v. FERC, 495 U. S. 490, 506 (1990)
(finding a state law pre-empted where it "would disturb and
conflict with the balance embodied in [a] considered federal
agency determination"). These postentry considerations,
along with the general importance of the pre-emption question, convince me that we should not overlook the District
Court's technical misstatement of the proper legal standard,
and that we should therefore affirm the Court of Appeals'
judgment vacating the injunction.

By vacating the injunction, we shall also help ensure that
the District Court takes account of the Secretary's views in
further proceedings that may involve a renewed motion for
a preliminary injunction. It is important that the District
Court do so. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) administers the Medicaid program. Institutionally speaking, that agency is better able than a court to assemble relevant facts (e. g., regarding harm caused to present
Medicaid patients) and to make relevant predictions (e. g.,
regarding furtherance of Medicaid-related goals). And the
law grants significant weight to any legal conclusion by the
Secretary as to whether a program such as Maine's is consistent with Medicaid's objectives. See, e. g., Chevron U. S. A.
Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.

837 (1984); Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134 (1944).
Cf. post, at 680-681 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).

The Medicaid statute sets forth a method through which
Maine may obtain those views. A participating State must
file a Medicaid plan with HHS and obtain HHS approval.
42 U. S. C. $ 1396. A State must also promptly file a plan
amendment to reflect any "[m]aterial changes in State law,
organization, or policy, or in the State's operation of the Medicaid program." 42 CFR $ 430.12(c) (2002). And the Secretary has said that a statute like Maine's is a "significant component of a state plan" with respect to which Maine is
expected to file an amendment. App. to Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 48a.

In addition, the legal doctrine of "primary jurisdiction"
permits a court itself to "refer" a question to the Secretary.
That doctrine seeks to produce better informed and uniform
legal rulings by allowing courts to take advantage of an
agency's specialized knowledge, expertise, and central position within a regulatory regime. United States v. Western
Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 59, 63-65 (1956). "No fixed formula
exists" for the doctrine's application. Id., at 64. Rather,
the question in each instance is whether a case raises "issues
of fact not within the conventional experience of judges," but
within the purview of an agency's responsibilities; whether
the "limited functions of review by the judiciary are more
rationally exercised, by preliminary resort" to an agency
"better equipped than courts" to resolve an issue in the first
instance; or, in a word, whether preliminary reference of issues to the agency will promote that proper working relationship between court and agency that the primary jurisdiction doctrine seeks to facilitate. Far East Conference v.
United States, 342 U. S. 570, 574-575 (1952); see also Western
Pacific R. Co., supra, at 63-65. Cf. 2 R. Pierce, Administrative Law $ 14.4, p. 944 (2002) (relatively frequent application
of the doctrine in pre-emption cases).

Where such conditions are satisfied--and I have littledoubt that they are satisfied here--courts may raise the doctrine on their own motion. E. g., Williams Pipe Line Co. v.

its proceedings--for a limited time, if appropriate--to allowa party to initiate agency review.

Western Pacific R. Co.,

Co., 837 F. 2d 199, 206 (CA5 1988) (stay of limited duration).
Lower courts have sometimes accompanied a stay withan injunction designed to preserve the status quo.

E. g.,
Wheelabrator Corp. v. Chafee, 455 F. 2d 1306, 1316 (CADC
1971). And, in my view, even if Maine should choose not to
obtain the Secretary's views on its own, the desirability of
the District Court's having those views to consider, supra,
at 672, is relevant to the "public interest" determination that
often factors into whether a preliminary injunction should
issue, see, e. g., MacDonald v. Chicago Park District, 132
F. 3d 355, 357 (CA7 1997); 11A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M.

(1995). But cf. Rosado, 397 U. S., at 406.

For these reasons, I concur in the Court's judgment and

facially discriminatory against interstate commerce nor (as
the Court explains, ante, at 668-670) similar to other state
action that we have hitherto found invalid on negativeCommerce-Clause grounds; and because, as I have explained
elsewhere, the negative Commerce Clause, having no foundation in the text of the Constitution and not lending itself
to judicial application except in the invalidation of facially

discriminatory action, should not be extended beyond suchaction and nondiscriminatory action of the precise sort

hitherto invalidated. See West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v.Healy, 512 U. S. 186, 209-210 (1994) (opinion concurring in
judgment).I would reject petitioner's statutory claim on the ground
that the remedy for the State's failure to comply with theobligations it has agreed to undertake under the Medicaid

$ 1396c. Petitioner must seek enforcement of the Medicaidconditions by that authority--and may seek and obtain relief
in the courts only when the denial of enforcement is "arbi-trary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in
accordance with law." 5 U. S. C. $ 706(2)(A).

Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the plurality that petitioner was not entitledto a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the

Maine Rx Program. I write separately because I do not be-lieve that "further proceedings in this case may lead to a
contrary result," ante, at 660, and because I do not agreewith the plurality's reasoning. It is clear from the text of
the Medicaid Act and the Constitution that petitioner's pre-emption and negative Commerce Clause claims are without
merit. I therefore concur in the judgment of the Court.

The premise of petitioner's pre-emption claim is thatMaine Rx "stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and

execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress."

there was no Medicaid-related goal or purpose served byMaine Rx." Ante, at 662. Both

Justice Stevens and
Justice O'Connor treat the Medicaid Act as embodying anabstract and highly generalized purpose that is inconsistent

with the Act's depth. The text of this complex statute beliestheir efforts to distill from it a single purpose.

The Medicaid Act represents a delicate balance Congressstruck between competing interests--care and cost, mandates and flexibility, oversight and discretion. While peti-tioner principally relies on 42 U. S. C. $ 1396a(a)(19), which
requires the Secretary of the Department of Health andHuman Services to ensure that state plans "provide such
safeguards as may be necessary to assure that . . . care andservices will be provided, in a manner consistent with . . .
the best interests of the recipients," the Medicaid Act alsopursues arguably competing interests such as cost control,
see $ 1396a(a)(30), and affording States broad discretion tocontrol access to prescription drugs, see

Pharmaceutical
Research and Mfrs. of America v. Thompson, 259 F. Supp.2d 39, 72 (DC 2003) (hereinafter Pharmaceutical Research)

(noting that prior authorization may be in tension with the" `best interests' " of Medicaid recipients).

The plurality's conclusion that $ 1396a(a)(19) imposes asilent prohibition on prior authorization programs that "severely curtai[l] Medicaid recipients' access to prescriptiondrugs," ante, at 665, ignores this complexity. In my view,
the Medicaid Act grants States broad discretion to imposeprior authorization and proper consideration of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services' rolein administering the Medicaid Act forecloses petitioner's
pre-emption claim.

A

I begin with an analysis of the relevant provisions of theMedicaid Act. Title 42 U. S. C. $ 1396r-8(d)(1) provides a

complete list of the restrictions participating States may

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
place on prescription drug coverage under Medicaid. Im-portantly, it says that "[a] State may subject to prior authorization any covered outpatient drug." $ 1396r-8(d)(1)(A).The only stricture placed on a prior authorization program
is compliance with certain enumerated procedures, $ 1396r-8(d)(5). Undoubtedly, the "purpose" of $ 1396r-8(d)(1) is
its effect--to grant participating States the authority to sub-ject drugs to prior authorization subject only to the express
limitations in $ 1396r-8(d)(5).This reading of the Medicaid Act's prior authorization provisions is confirmed by its near-neighbors. Section 1396r-8(d) allows States to exclude or further restrict coverage (beyond prior authorization) of a "covered outpatient drug" if"the prescribed use is not for a medically accepted indication," $ 1396r-8(d)(1)(B)(i), or if the drug or use is on a listspecified in $ 1396r-8(d)(2). That list includes, for example,
prescriptions for "anorexia . . . or weight gain," $ 1396r-8(d)(2)(A), and "cosmetic purposes or hair growth," $ 1396r-
8(d)(2)(C), as well as all barbiturates, $ 1396r-8(d)(2)(I).Furthermore, under $ 1396r-8(d)(6), "[a] State may impose
limitations, with respect to all such drugs in a therapeuticclass, on the minimum or maximum quantities per prescription . . . if such limitations are necessary to discourage waste. . . ." This fine-tuning of a State's ability to restrict drug
coverage beyond prior authorization stands in stark contrastto the broad authority granted to States to impose prior
authorization. Indeed, these provisions confirm that whenCongress meant to impose limitations on state authority in
this area it did so explicitly.The authority to entirely exclude coverage of certain
drugs or uses, for any reason,1 again illustrates the futility

1 Neither the plurality nor the opinion concurring in part and dissenting
in part (hereinafter dissent) suggests that there is any purpose-based limitation on a State's authority under $ 1396r-8(d)(2). Nor can they. The
restrictions enable States to make value, rather than cost or care, judg538US2 Unit: $U52 [11-02-04 18:02:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

of discerning one "purpose" from the Medicaid Act. If, asthe plurality reasons, the " `best interests' " of Medicaid beneficiaries require that access to prescription drugs not be"severely curtailed," then $ 1396r-8(d)(2) empowers States
to do what the plurality believes is precisely opposed to thebest interests of Medicaid beneficiaries. This is just a further illustration of the compromises embodied in the Medicaid Act and demonstrates the impossibility of defining "pur-poses" in complex statutes at such a high level of abstraction

and the concomitant danger of invoking obstacle pre-emptionbased on the arbitrary selection of one purpose to the exclusion of others.In light of the broad grant of discretion to States to impose
prior authorization, petitioner cannot produce a credible con-flict between Maine Rx and the Medicaid Act. Both the plurality and the dissent fail to explain how a State's purpose(and there may be many) in enacting a prior authorization
program makes any difference in determining whether thatprogram is in the "best interests" of Medicaid beneficiaries.
The mere existence of a prior authorization procedure, as
contemplated by $ 1396r-8(d)(5), cannot "severely curtai[l]"access to prescription drugs (the Court's touchstone for a

"conflict" with $ 1396a(a)(19), ante, at 665). Otherwise theplurality has rendered an interpretation of the Medicaid Act
that leaves it with an internal conflict.The dissent reasons that prior authorization programs
must "safeguar[d] against unnecessary utilization," post, at
685 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)
(internal quotation marks omitted), of prescription drugs and

ments as to whether a drug should be covered. See, e. g., $ 1396r-
8(d)(2)(B) (fertility drugs), $ 1396r-8(d)(2)(C) (cosmetic purposes). Again,
this begs the question of why, for example, Congress would give States
greater authority over the decision whether or not to cover a prescription
hair growth drug than whether or not to subject the same hair growth
drug to prior authorization.

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
control costs, but also never explains how the motivation forimposing prior authorization affects whether it furthers

these ends.2 The dissent points to nothing in the recordthat suggests that Maine Rx will not limit unnecessary use
of the covered drugs or control costs associated with pre-scription drug expenditures under Medicaid. Rather, the
dissent merely asserts that because Maine Rx conditionsprior authorization on nonparticipation in the rebate program it follows ipse dixit that Maine Rx does not furtherthese objectives.

Post, at 688-689 (O'Connor, J., concur-ring in part and dissenting in part). Obstacle pre-emption

turns on whether the goals of the federal statute are frus-trated by the effect of the state law. The dissent's focus on
the subjective intent of the state legislature enacting the lawtargeted for pre-emption asks an irrelevant question.

B
The plurality and dissent also fail to consider the necessaryimplications of the Secretary's role in approving state Medicaid plans and otherwise administering the Act. The Secre-tary is delegated a type of pre-emptive authority--he must
approve state plans that comply with $ 1396a, $ 1396a(b), butis given the authority to withhold funds if he deems a State
to be noncompliant, $ 1396c.3 While acknowledging the pos2 These requirements, of course, have no basis in the text of the Medicaid
Act. I discuss the dissent's reasoning only because its reliance on Maine
Rx's express "purpose" turns the presumption against pre-emption on its
head. If Maine Rx also stated that its purpose was to control prescription
drug costs under Medicaid would it be safe from pre-emption? I find it
odd that application of federal statutory pre-emption under the Supremacy
Clause should turn on whether a state legislature has recited what this
Court deems to be the proper rationale.

3 In fact, the Secretary's power to withhold funds from States that

breach the Medicaid Act's terms indicates that the Act itself contemplates
the existence of state plans that do not comply with the requirements of

$ 1396a(a). Title 42 U. S. C. $ 1396c provides:

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment

sibility that the Secretary "may view the Maine Rx Program
as an amendment to its Medicaid Plan that requires . . . approval before it becomes effective," ante, at 660, and potentially withhold such approval, the plurality does not discuss
the logical consequences of petitioner's view that Maine Rx
is pre-empted by the Medicaid Act.

According to petitioner, the Secretary is forbidden by the
Medicaid Act from approving Maine Rx because the Act itself pre-empts Maine Rx and renders it void under the Supremacy Clause. If the Secretary approved Maine Rx, his
interpretation would necessarily, if petitioner is correct, be
rejected by a reviewing court under the first step of the inquiry of Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense
Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842-843 (1984), which asks
whether the statute is unambiguous.4 See, e. g., Smiley v.

"If the Secretary, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to
the State agency administering or supervising the administration of the
State plan approved under this subchapter, finds--

"(1) that the plan has been so changed that it no longer complies with
the provisions of section 1396a of this title; or

"(2) that in the administration of the plan there is a failure to comply
substantially with any such provision;

"the Secretary shall notify such State agency that further payments will
not be made to the State . . . until the Secretary is satisfied that there will
no longer be any such failure to comply."

The Medicaid Act cannot meaningfully be interpreted to invalidate state
laws, such as Maine Rx, that do not comply with its express terms, much
less state laws a court concludes pose an obstacle to the Act's "purpose."
State plans that do not meet $ 1396a(a)'s requirements are to be defunded
by the Secretary--they are not void under the Supremacy Clause. It is
not apparent to me where the plurality finds the congressional directive
to pre-empt state plans that breach a contract between the Federal Government and the State. Cf. Part I-D, infra. In my view, no such directive exists, and States are free to deviate from the Medicaid Act's requirements, subject only to sanctions by the Secretary.

4 If a federal statute is ambiguous with respect to whether it pre-empts

state law, then the presumption against pre-emption should ordinarily prevent a court from concluding that the state law is pre-empted. Therefore,
a court's conclusion that Maine Rx is pre-empted would require rejection

538US2 Unit: $U52 [11-02-04 18:02:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 739 (1996).
Petitioner must therefore show that the Medicaid Act is unambiguous or, in other words, that Congress "has directly
spoken to the precise question at issue." Chevron, supra,
at 842. However, given the foregoing discussion of the text
of the Medicaid Act, it cannot be read to unambiguously
prohibit Maine Rx, or indicate that Congress, in enacting

$ 1396a(a)(19), directly addressed this issue. Indeed, the Department of Health and Human Services has already adopted
an interpretation of the Medicaid Act that "does not preclude
States from negotiating prices, including manufacturer discounts and rebates for non-Medicaid drug purchases." Letter from D. Smith, Dir. of Center for Medicaid and State
Operations, Centers for Medicare & Medical Services, to
all State Medicaid Dirs. (Sept. 18, 2002), App. to Brief
for United States as Amicus Curiae 48a.5 Obstacle preemption's very premise is that Congress has not expressly
displaced state law, and thus not "directly spoken" to
the pre-emption question. Therefore, where an agency is
charged with administering a federal statute as the Secretary is here, Chevron imposes a perhaps-insurmountable barrier to a claim of obstacle pre-emption.

I note that the interpretation of the Medicaid Act I offer,
unlike petitioner's, does not require the Secretary to reach a
particular decision with respect to Maine Rx. The Secretary is expressly charged with determining whether state
plans comply with the numerous requirements of 42 U. S. C.

$$ 1396a(a), 1396a(b), 1396c. Among these, as discussed earlier, is the requirement that the plan serve "the best inof the Secretary's contrary construction of the statute at Chevron's first
step, not its second, which asks whether the agency construction is reasonable. 467 U. S., at 843.

5 This interpretation has been upheld by the District Court for the District of Columbia. Pharmaceutical Research and Mfrs. of America v.
Thompson, 259 F. Supp. 2d 39, 69-72 (2003). Petitioner's arguments provide no answer to the careful analysis offered by that court.

terests of [Medicaid] recipients." $ 1396a(a)(19). While Imaintain that federal courts cannot use obstacle pre-emption

to determine whether or not Maine Rx serves these inter-ests, the Secretary must examine the entire state plan, not
just Maine Rx in isolation. Moreover, the Secretary's man-date from Congress is to conduct, with greater expertise and
resources than courts, the inquiry into whether Maine Rxupsets the balance contemplated by the Medicaid Act. Congress' delegation to the agency to perform this complex bal-ancing task precludes federal-court intervention on the basis
of obstacle pre-emption--it does not bar the Secretary fromperforming his duty to adjudge whether Maine Rx upsets
the balance the Medicaid Act contemplates and withhold ap-proval or funding if necessary. If petitioner or respondents
disagree with the Secretary's decision, they may seek judi-cial review, as petitioner has already done for plans similar
to Maine Rx that the Secretary has approved. See Pharmaceutical Research and Mfrs. of America v. Thompson,259 F. Supp. 2d 39, 69-72 (DC 2003).

C
Maine Rx is not pre-empted by the Medicaid Act. Thisconclusion is easily reached without speculation about

whether Maine Rx advances "Medicaid-related goals" or howmuch it does so. The disagreement between the plurality
and dissent in this case aptly illustrates why "[a] freewheel-ing judicial inquiry into whether a state statute is in tension
with federal objectives . . . undercut[s] the principle that itis Congress rather than the courts that pre-empts state law."
Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Assn., 505 U. S.88, 111 (1992) (

Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concur-ring in judgment).

D
I make one final observation with respect to petitioner'spre-emption claim. The Court has stated that Spending

Clause legislation "is much in the nature of a contract."

538US2 Unit: $U52 [11-02-04 18:02:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

683Cite as: 538 U. S. 644 (2003)
Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451
U. S. 1, 17 (1981). This contract analogy raises serious questions as to whether third parties may sue to enforce Spending Clause legislation--through pre-emption or otherwise.
See Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U. S. 329, 349-350 (1997)
(Scalia, J., concurring). In contract law, a third party to
the contract (as petitioner is here) may only sue for breach
if he is the "intended beneficiary" of the contract. See, e. g.,
Restatement (Second) of Contracts $ 304 (1979) ("A promise
in a contract creates a duty in the promisor to any intended
beneficiary to perform the promise, and the intended beneficiary may enforce the duty"). When Congress wishes to
allow private parties to sue to enforce federal law, it must
clearly express this intent. Under this Court's precedents,
private parties may employ 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 or an implied
private right of action only if they demonstrate an "unambiguously conferred right." Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U. S.
273, 283 (2002). Petitioner quite obviously cannot satisfy
this requirement and therefore arguably is not entitled to
bring a pre-emption lawsuit as a third-party beneficiary to
the Medicaid contract. Respondents have not advanced this
argument in this case. However, were the issue to be
raised, I would give careful consideration to whether Spending Clause legislation can be enforced by third parties in the
absence of a private right of action.

II
Petitioner's Commerce Clause challenge is easily met, because "[t]he negative Commerce Clause has no basis in the
text of the Constitution, makes little sense, and has proved
virtually unworkable in application." Camps Newfound/
Owatonna, Inc. v. Town of Harrison, 520 U. S. 564, 610
(1997) (Thomas, J., dissenting). I therefore agree with the
Court that petitioner cannot prevail on this claim.

AMERICA v. WALSH

Opinion of O'Connor, J.

Justice O'Connor, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Kennedy join, concurring in part and dissentingin part.

I join Parts I-III and VI of the Court's opinion, and Iagree with the plurality's conclusion that States may not impose on Medicaid beneficiaries the burdens of prior authori-zation in the absence of a countervailing Medicaid purpose,
ante, at 662. I part with the plurality because I do notagree that the District Court abused its discretion in enjoining respondents from imposing prior authorization under theMaine Rx Program. Before the District Court, respondents
"point[ed] to no Medicaid purpose" served by Maine Rx'sprior-authorization requirement. App. to Pet. for Cert. 68
(emphasis in original). This is not surprising. The pro-gram is open to all Maine residents, rich and poor. It does
not purport to further a Medicaid-related purpose, and it isnot tailored to have such an effect. By imposing prior authorization on Maine's Medicaid population to achieve whollynon-Medicaid related goals, Maine Rx "stands as an obstacle
to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes andobjectives" of the federal Medicaid Act. Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941). I would uphold the DistrictCourt's injunction on this basis, and I therefore respectfully
dissent from Parts IV, V, and VII of the plurality's opinion.

I
Our ultimate task in analyzing a pre-emption claim is "todetermine whether state regulation is consistent with the

structure and purpose" of the federal statutory scheme "asa whole." Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management
Assn., 505 U. S. 88, 98 (1992) (plurality opinion of O'Connor,J.). We look to " `the provisions of the whole law, and to
its object and policy.' " Ibid. (quoting Pilot Life Ins. Co. v.Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41, 51 (1987)). Our touchstone is Congress' intent. Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management
Assn., supra, at 96. "The nature of the power exerted by

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Congress, the object sought to be attained, and the characterof the obligations imposed by the law, are all important in

considering the question of whether supreme federal enact-ments preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject." Hines v. Davidowitz, supra, at 70.Under the Medicaid Act, once a drug manufacturer enters
into a Medicaid rebate agreement with respect to a particular outpatient drug, a State that has elected to offer prescrip-tion drug coverage must cover the drug under its state plan

unless it complies with one of the Medicaid Act's provisionsthat permits a State to exclude or restrict coverage. 42
U. S. C. $ 1396r-8(d); see ante, at 652. Prior authorization
is one such restriction. Section 1396r-8(d)(5) provides that
a state plan "may require, as a condition of coverage or

payment for a covered outpatient drug . . . the approval of

the drug before its dispensing for any medically accepted
indication."

Prior authorization is, by definition, a procedural obstacle
to Medicaid beneficiaries' access to medically necessary prescription drugs covered under the Medicaid program. It
nevertheless may serve a Medicaid purpose by "safeguard[ing] against unnecessary utilization and assur[ing] that payments are consistent with efficiency, economy and quality of
care." H. R. Rep. No. 101-881, p. 98 (1990). A State accordingly may impose prior authorization to reduce Medicaid
costs. Cf. New York State Dept. of Social Servs. v. Dublino,
413 U. S. 405, 421 (1973) ("Where coordinate state and federal efforts exist within a complementary administrative
framework, and in the pursuit of common purposes, the case
for federal pre-emption becomes a less persuasive one" (emphasis added)). A State may not, however, impose prior authorization to generate revenue for purposes wholly unrelated to its Medicaid program.

While the Medicaid Act does not expressly bar States from
using prior authorization to accomplish goals unrelated to
the Medicaid program, such a limit on States' authority is

inherent in the purpose and structure of the Medicaid Act.
As the District Court recognized, a contrary rule would permit Maine to use prior authorization to raise funds for "highway and bridge construction or school funding," and presumably any other purpose, so long as the Secretary of Health
and Human Services took no action to prevent it. App. to
Pet. for Cert. 68. The purpose and structure of the Medicaid Act make clear that Congress did not intend such an absurd result.

Congress created the Medicaid program to "enabl[e] each
State, as far as practicable under the conditions in such
State, to furnish . . . medical assistance on behalf of families
with dependent children and of aged, blind, or disabled individuals, whose income and resources are insufficient to meet
the costs of necessary medical services." 42 U. S. C. $ 1396.
Consistent with that purpose, Congress has imposed income and resource limitations on many of the groups eligible
for assistance under the Act. See, e. g., $$ 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)
(IV), (VI), and (VII); $ 1396b(f ).

A requirement that prior authorization be used only where
it furthers a Medicaid purpose is reinforced by the structure
of the Medicaid Act. Congress has afforded States broad
flexibility in tailoring the scope and coverage of their Medicaid programs, see Alexander v. Choate, 469 U. S. 287, 303
(1985), but the Act establishes a number of prerequisites
for approval of a state plan by the Secretary. 42 U. S. C.

$$ 1396a(a)(1)-(65). Two such requirements are of particular relevance here. First, a state plan must contain safeguards to ensure covered services are provided in a manner
consistent with "the best interests of the [Medicaid] recipients." $ 1396a(a)(19). Second, a state plan must "safeguard
against unnecessary utilization" of services and ensure that
"payments are consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care." $ 1396a(a)(30)(A). These provisions confirm
Congress' intent that state Medicaid initiatives not burden

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Medicaid beneficiaries without serving a Medicaid goal suchas stretching available resources to the greatest effect.

II
The District Court correctly concluded that the Maine RxProgram's prior-authorization provision is invalid because it

burdens Medicaid recipients while advancing no Medicaidgoals. Under the Maine Rx Program, the State "shall impose prior authorization requirements in the Medicaid pro-gram" on any "nonparticipating" drug manufacturer that
does not enter into a rebate agreement with the State fordrugs dispensed to non-Medicaid patients. Me. Rev. Stat.
Ann., Tit. 22, $ 2681(7) (West Supp. 2002). The rebate agree-ments are designed to reduce prescription drug prices for all
residents of the State, regardless of financial or medical need.$$ 2681(1), (2)(F). The program thus serves the State's
non-Medicaid population by threatening to erect an obstacleto Medicaid recipients' ability to receive covered outpatient
drugs.The plurality concedes that Maine Rx cannot survive a
pre-emption challenge if it does not have as its purpose oreffect a "Medicaid-related goal or purpose."

Ante, at 662.Based on the record before the District Court, I would hold

that the court did not abuse its discretion in concluding thatpetitioner demonstrated a likelihood of success on its preemption claim. Petitioner alleged that the Maine Rx Pro-gram does not serve a Medicaid purpose. The Maine Rx
statute on its face bears this out. The program is designed"to reduce prescription drug prices for residents of the
State," and it accomplishes this goal by threatening to im-pose prior authorization on otherwise covered outpatient
drugs. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 22, $$ 2681(1), (2)(F),(7) (West Supp. 2002). In the District Court, Maine did not
attempt to justify the program on the basis that it served aMedicaid purpose. Instead, Maine took the position that it
was not required to demonstrate any such purpose. An ap538US2 Unit: $U52 [11-02-04 18:02:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

pellate court reviewing a preliminary injunction is confinedto the record before the District Court, and here, neither the

record before the District Court nor the Maine Rx statuteitself reveals a Medicaid purpose that will be served by the
Maine Rx Program.The plurality speculates about three "Medicaid-related interests that will be served if the [Maine Rx] program is successful." Ante, at 663. First, the plurality asserts thatMaine Rx "will provide medical benefits to persons who can

be described as `medically needy' even if they do not qualifyfor [Aid to Families with Dependent Children] or [Supplemental Security Income] benefits." Ibid. Second, the plurality contends that "there is the possibility that, by enabling
some borderline aged and infirm persons better access to
prescription drugs earlier, Medicaid expenses will be reduced." Ibid. Third, the plurality posits that "whenever it
is necessary to impose the prior authorization requirement
on a manufacturer that refuses to participate," Maine Rx will
promote the use of cost-effective medications and thereby
"[a]voi[d] unnecessary costs in the administration of [the]
State's Medicaid program." Ante, at 663, 664. Asserting
that these "Medicaid-related goals" are "plainly present in
the Maine Rx Program," the plurality concludes that the
District Court's failure sua sponte to recognize them constituted "an erroneous predicate" for the preliminary injunction. Ante, at 663.

I disagree. I would not say it was an abuse of discretion
for the District Court to conclude petitioner met its burden
in showing that there was no Medicaid-related goal or purpose served by Maine Rx. Cf. ante, at 662-665. Each of
the plurality's post-hoc justifications for the Maine Rx Program's burden on Medicaid beneficiaries rests on factual
predicates that are not supported in the record. Even assuming the predicate assumptions behind the plurality's first
and second justifications--that some of the potential beneficiaries of Maine Rx can be classified as "medically needy" or

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
"borderline aged and infirm"--it is impossible to discern
based on the facts in the record whether the Medicaid program would reap a benefit from the discounts made available
to such populations. The proposition that discounts on prescription drugs purchased out-of-pocket might produce Medicaid cost savings by preventing Maine residents from becoming eligible for Medicaid is not self-evident. With no
party before it advocating such an attenuated causal chain,
and with no facts in the record to support it, the District
Court can hardly be said to have abused its discretion in
divining no Medicaid purpose on the face of the Maine Rx
statute.

The plurality's third rationale fails on similar grounds.
The assertion that prior authorization under the Maine Rx
Program will necessarily produce cost savings for Maine's
Medicaid program is unsupportable. Under Maine Rx, the
imposition of prior authorization is in no manner tied to the
efficacy or cost-effectiveness of a particular drug. Rather,
the sole trigger for prior authorization is the failure of a
manufacturer or labeler to pay rebates for the benefit of
non-Medicaid populations. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 22,

$ 2681(7) (West Supp. 2002). It is thus entirely possible that
only the most efficacious and cost-effective drugs will be subject to a prior-authorization requirement under Maine Rx.
Maine Rx's prior-authorization requirement would, in that
event, at best serve no purpose and at worst delay and inhibit Medicaid beneficiaries' access to necessary medication.
In concluding that the District Court abused its discretion,
the plurality essentially rejects, out of hand, this possibility.
In so doing, the plurality distorts the limitations on the scope
of our appellate review at this interlocutory stage of proceedings. See Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422 U. S. 922, 931-
932 (1975) ("[W]hile the standard to be applied by the district
court in deciding whether a plaintiff is entitled to a preliminary injunction is stringent, the standard of appellate review

is simply whether the issuance of the injunction . . . consti-tuted an abuse of discretion").

The District Court had before it, on one hand, concreteevidence of the burdens that Maine Rx's prior-authorization
requirement would impose on Medicaid beneficiaries. Onthe other hand, the District Court had no evidence or argument suggesting that Maine Rx would achieve cost sav-ings or any other Medicaid-related goal. Finding that the
District Court, under these circumstances, did not abuseits discretion by preliminarily enjoining Maine Rx's priorauthorization requirement, I would reverse the judgment ofthe Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings.

BREUER v. JIM'S CONCRETE OF BREVARD, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 02-337. Argued April 2, 2003--Decided May 19, 2003
Petitioner Breuer sued respondent, his former employer, Jim's Concrete

of Brevard, Inc., in a Florida state court for unpaid wages, liquidated
damages, prejudgment interest, and attorney's fees under the Fair
Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), which provides, inter alia, that
"[a]n action to recover . . . may be maintained . . . in any Federal or State
court of competent jurisdiction," 29 U. S. C. $ 216(b). Jim's Concrete
removed the case to the Federal District Court under 28 U. S. C.

$ 1441(a), which reads: "Except as otherwise expressly provided by Act
of Congress, any civil action brought in a State court of which the [federal] district courts . . . have original jurisdiction, may be removed by
the defendant . . . to the [appropriate federal] district court." Breuer
sought an order remanding the case to state court, arguing that removal
was improper because $ 216(b)'s provision that an action "may be maintained" in state court put forward an express exception to $ 1441(a)'s
general removal authorization. Though the District Court denied
Breuer's motion, it certified the issue for interlocutory appeal. The
Eleventh Circuit affirmed, saying that although Congress had expressly
barred removal in direct, unequivocal language in other statutes,

$ 216(b) was not comparably prohibitory.

Held: Section 216(b) does not bar removal of a suit from state to federal

court. Breuer's case was properly removed under $ 1441. Pp. 694-700.

(a) Breuer unquestionably could have begun his action in the District
Court under $ 216(b), as well as under 28 U. S. C. $$ 1331 and $ 1337(a).
Removal of FLSA actions is thus prohibited under $ 1441(a) only if Congress expressly provided as much. Nothing on the face of $ 216(b) looks
like an express prohibition of removal, there being no mention of removal, let alone of prohibition. While $ 216(b) provides that an action
"may be maintained . . . in any . . . State court of competent jurisdiction," the word "maintain" enjoys a breadth of meaning that leaves its
bearing on removal ambiguous at best. "Maintain" in reference to a
legal action is often read as "bring" or "file," but "to maintain an action"
may also mean "to continue" to litigate, as opposed to "commence" an
action. If an ambiguous term like "maintain" qualified as an express
provision for $ 1441(a) purposes, then the requirement of an "expres[s]
provi[sion]" would call for nothing more than a "provision," pure and

simple, leaving the word "expressly" without any consequence whatever. The need to take the express exception requirement seriously is
underscored by examples of indisputable prohibitions of removal in a
number of other statutes, e. g., $ 1445, which demonstrate that, when
Congress wishes to give plaintiffs an absolute choice of forum, it is capable of doing so in unmistakable terms. Pp. 694-697.

(b) None of Breuer's refinements on his basic argument from the term
"maintain" puts him in a stronger position. The Court rejects his argument that "may be maintained" shows up as sufficiently prohibitory once
it is coupled with a federal policy of construing removal jurisdiction
narrowly, as set forth in Shamrock Oil & Gas Corp. v. Sheets, 313 U. S.
100, 108-109. Whatever apparent force this argument might have
claimed when Shamrock was handed down has been qualified by the
later amendment of $ 1441 into its present form, requiring any exception
to the general removability rule to be express. Nor does it avail
Breuer to emphasize the sense of "maintain" as implying continuation
of an action to final judgment, so as to give a plaintiff who began an
action the statutory right under $ 216(b) to see it through. The right
to maintain an action may indeed be a right to fight to the finish, but
removal does nothing to defeat that right; far from concluding a case
before final judgment, removal just transfers it from one forum to another. Moreover, if "an action . . . may be maintained" meant that a
plaintiff could insist on keeping an FLSA case wherever he filed it in
the first place, it would seem that an FLSA case brought in a federal
district court could never be transferred to a different one over the
plaintiff's objection, a result that would plainly clash with the provision
for change of venue, $ 1404(a). Finally, although Breuer may be right
that many FLSA claims are for such small amounts that removal to a
sometimes distant federal court, often increasing the cost of litigation,
may make it difficult for many employees to vindicate their rights effectively, the implications of that assertion keep this Court from going
Breuer's way. Because a number of other statutes incorporate or use
the same language as 29 U. S. C. $ 216(b), see, e. g., $ 626(b), there cannot
be an FLSA removal exception without wholesale exceptions for other
statutory actions, to the point that it is just too hard to believe that a
right to "maintain" an action was ever meant to displace the right to
remove. Pp. 697-699.

Opinion of the Court
States have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the defendant or the defendants, to the district court of the United
States for the district and division embracing the place
where such action is pending." Breuer sought an order remanding the case to state court, arguing that removal was
improper owing to the FLSA's provision that an action "may
be maintained" in any state court, a provision that Breuer
put forward as an express exception to the general authorization of removal under $ 1441(a). Though the District
Court denied Breuer's motion, it certified the issue for interlocutory appeal under $ 1292(b). The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, saying that Congress had expressly barred removal
in "direct, unequivocal language" in other statutes, 292 F. 3d
1308, 1310 (2002), but was not comparably prohibitory in

$ 216(b). The Eleventh Circuit thus joined the First, see
Cosme Nieves v. Deshler, 786 F. 2d 445 (1986), but placed
itself at odds with the Eighth, see Johnson v. Butler Bros.,
162 F. 2d 87 (1947) (denying removability under FLSA). We
granted certiorari to resolve the conflict, 537 U. S. 1099
(2003), and now affirm.

II

A

There is no question that Breuer could have begun his
action in the District Court. The FLSA provides that an
action "may be maintained . . . in any Federal or State court
of competent jurisdiction," 29 U. S. C. $ 216(b), and the district courts would in any event have original jurisdiction
over FLSA claims under 28 U. S. C. $ 1331, as "arising under
the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States," and

$ 1337(a), as "arising under any Act of Congress regulating
commerce." Removal of FLSA actions is thus prohibited
under $ 1441(a) only if Congress expressly provided as much.

Nothing on the face of 29 U. S. C. $ 216(b) looks like an
express prohibition of removal, there being no mention of
removal, let alone of prohibition. While $ 216(b) provides

Opinion of the Court
that an action "may be maintained . . . in any . . . State courtof competent jurisdiction," the word "maintain" enjoys a

breadth of meaning that leaves its bearing on removal am-biguous at best. "To maintain an action" may mean "to continue" to litigate, as opposed to "commence" an action.1Black's Law Dictionary 1143 (3d ed. 1933). But "maintain"
in reference to a legal action is often read as "bring" or "file";"[t]o maintain an action or suit may mean to commence or
institute it; the term imports the existence of a cause of ac-tion."

Ibid.; see 1A J. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice|| 0.167[5], p. 472 (2d ed. 1996) (calling the " `may be maintained' " language an "ambiguous phrase" and "certainly notan express provision against removal within the meaning of

$ 1441"); 14C C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, FederalPractice and Procedure $ 3729, p. 235 (1998) (referring to
"use of the ambiguous term `maintain' in the statute"). Themost, then, that Breuer can claim simply from the use of the
term "maintain" is that any text, even when ambiguous, thatmight be read as inconsistent with removal is an "express"
prohibiting provision under the statute. But if an ambigu-ous term like "maintain" qualified as an express provision

1 Actually, there is reason to think that this sense of "maintain" was
intended. Under the FLSA, the Secretary of Labor may file a suit on
behalf of an employee to recover unpaid wages or overtime compensation,
and when the Secretary files such a suit, an employee's right to bring a
comparable action terminates, see, e. g., 29 U. S. C. $ 216(c). Congressional reports suggest that although an employee may no longer initiate a
new action once the Secretary has sued, an employee may continue to
litigate, i. e., "maintain," an action already pending. See H. R. Conf. Rep.
No. 327, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., 20 (1961) (filing of the Secretary's complaint
would "not, however, operate to terminate any employee's right to maintain such a private suit to which he had become a party plaintiff before
the Secretary's action"); S. Rep. No. 145, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., 39 (1961)
(Secretary's filing of complaint "terminates the rights of individuals to
later file suit"); cf. Smallwood v. Gallardo, 275 U. S. 56, 61 (1927) ("To
maintain a suit is to uphold, continue on foot and keep from collapse a suit
already begun"). Seen in this light, Congress's use of the term "maintain"
is easy to understand, carrying no implication for removal.

Opinion of the Court
for purposes of 28 U. S. C. $ 1441(a), then the requirement ofan "expres[s] provi[sion]" would call for nothing more than a

"provision," pure and simple, leaving the word "expressly"with no consequence whatever. "[E]xpres[s] provi[sion]"
must mean something more than any verbal hook for anargument.

The need to take the express exception requirement seriously is underscored by examples of indisputable prohibi-tions of removal in a number of other statutes. Section

1445, for example, provides that

"(a) A civil action in any State court against a railroador its receivers or trustees . . . may not be removed to

any district court of the United States.

"(b) A civil action in any State court against a carrieror its receivers or trustees to recover damages for delay,

loss, or injury of shipments . . . may not be removed toany district court of the United States unless the matter
in controversy exceeds $10,000, exclusive of interestand costs.

"(c) A civil action in any State court arising under theworkmen's compensation laws of such State may not be
removed to any district court of the United States."(d) A civil action in any State court arising under . . .
the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 may not be
removed to any district court of the United States."

See also 15 U. S. C. $ 77v(a) ("[N]o case arising under [theSecurities Act of 1933] and brought in any State court of

F. 2d, at 451. It has not done so here.

B
None of Breuer's refinements on his basic argument fromthe term "maintain" puts him in a stronger position. He

goes on to say, for example, that interpretation does not stopat the dictionary, and he argues that the statutory phrase
"may be maintained" shows up as sufficiently prohibitoryonce it is coupled with a federal policy of construing removal
jurisdiction narrowly. Breuer relies heavily on our state-ment in Shamrock Oil & Gas Corp. v. Sheets, 313 U. S. 100
(1941), that "the policy of the successive acts of Congressregulating the jurisdiction of federal courts is one calling for
the strict construction of [removal legislation] . . . . `Dueregard for the rightful independence of state governments,
which should actuate federal courts, requires that theyscrupulously confine their own jurisdiction to the precise
limits . . . the statute has defined.' " Id., at 108-109 (quoting
Healy v. Ratta, 292 U. S. 263, 270 (1934)). But whatever ap-parent force this argument might have claimed when Shamrock was handed down has been qualified by later statutorydevelopment. At the time that case was decided, $ 1441 provided simply that any action within original federal subject-matter jurisdiction could be removed. Fourteen years later,
however, it was amended into its present form, requiring anyexception to the general removability rule to be express.
See Act of June 25, 1948, $ 1441(a), 62 Stat. 937 (authorizingremoval over civil suits within the district courts' original
jurisdiction "[e]xcept as otherwise expressly provided by Actof Congress"); see also 28 U. S. C. $ 1441 (historical and revi538US2 Unit: $U53 [11-02-04 18:03:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
sion notes). Since 1948, therefore, there has been no question that whenever the subject matter of an action qualifies
it for removal, the burden is on a plaintiff to find an express
exception. As Shamrock itself said, "the language of the
Act . . . evidence[s] the Congressional purpose," 313 U. S., at
108, and congressional insistence on express exception is
hardly satisfied by the malleability of the term "maintain" in
the text Breuer relies upon.

Nor does it do Breuer any good to emphasize a sense of
"maintain" as implying continuation of an action to final
judgment, so as to give a plaintiff who began an action the
statutory right under 29 U. S. C. $ 216(b) to see it through.
We may concede that it does, and the concession leaves the
term "maintain" just as ambiguous as ever on the issue before us.2 The right to maintain an action may indeed be a
right to fight to the finish, but removal does nothing to defeat
that right; far from concluding a case before final judgment,
removal just transfers it from one forum to another. As
between a state and a federal forum, the statute seems to
betray an indifference, with its provision merely for maintaining action "in any Federal or State Court," ibid.

But even if the text of $ 216(b) were not itself reason
enough to doubt that the provision conveys any right to remain in the original forum, the implication of Breuer's position would certainly raise misgivings about his point. For
if the phrase "[a]n action . . . may be maintained" meant that
a plaintiff could insist on keeping an FLSA case wherever
he filed it in the first place, it would seem that an FLSA case
brought in a federal district court could never be transferred
to a different one over the plaintiff 's objection, a result that
would plainly clash with the provision for change of venue,
28 U. S. C. $ 1404(a) ("For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer

Opinion of the Court
any civil action to any other district or division where itmight have been brought").

It is, finally, a like concern about consequences that leavesus with fatal reservations about Breuer's pragmatic appeal
that many claims under the FLSA are for such smallamounts that removal to a sometimes distant federal court
may make it less convenient and more expensive for employ-ees to vindicate their rights effectively. This may often be
true, but even if its truth somehow justified winking at theambiguity of the term "maintain," the implications would
keep us from going Breuer's way. A number of other statutes incorporate or use the same language as $ 216(b), see 29U. S. C. $ 626(b) (providing that the Age Discrimination in

Employment Act of 1967 "shall be enforced in accordancewith the powers, remedies, and procedures provided in"

$ 216(b) and other sections of the FLSA); $ 2005(c)(2) ("Anaction to recover the liability prescribed [under the Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988] in paragraph (1)may be maintained against the employer in any Federal
or State court of competent jurisdiction"); $ 2617(a)(2) ("An
action to recover the damages or equitable relief [under theFamily and Medical Leave Act of 1993] prescribed in paragraph (1) may be maintained against any employer (includinga public agency) in any Federal or State court of competent
jurisdiction by any one or more employees"). Breuer, then,cannot have a removal exception for the FLSA without entailing exceptions for other statutory actions, to the pointthat it becomes just too hard to believe that a right to "maintain" an action was ever meant to displace the right toremove.

3 Breuer points to two nonjudicial authorities that do nothing to assuage
our skepticism. He calls our attention to the position taken by the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, United States Department of
Labor, in an amicus brief filed before the Eighth Circuit in Johnson v.
Butler Bros., 162 F. 2d 87 (1947), arguing that the text of the FLSA and

not be removed to federal court. But this brief is not persuasive authority. The Secretary has no responsibility for applying the removal statute
and no particular authority to interpret it; the Secretary's opinion cannot
make up for the absence of express statutory language. Breuer also
points to a Senate Report accompanying the 1958 enactment of 28 U. S. C.

$ 1445, a provision barring removal of workers' compensation actions
under state law. Referring to actions brought under the FLSA, the report states "[i]f filed in the State courts the law prohibits removal to the
Federal court." S. Rep. No. 1830, 85th Cong., 2d Sess., 9 (1958). But a
stray comment in a congressional report stands a long way from an express statutory provision.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 02-281. Argued March 31, 2003--Decided May 19, 2003
The Bishop Paiute Tribe in California chartered and wholly owns the

Bishop Paiute Gaming Corporation, which operates and manages the
Paiute Palace Casino (Casino), a tribal gaming operation. When the
Inyo County District Attorney asked the Casino for the employment
records of three Casino employees under investigation for welfare fraud,
the Tribe responded that its privacy policy precluded release of the records without the employees' consent. The District Attorney, on showing probable cause, then obtained and executed a search warrant authorizing a search of the Casino for payroll records of the three employees.
The District Attorney subsequently asked for the records of six other
Casino employees. The Tribe reiterated its privacy policy, but offered
to accept as evidence of consent a redacted copy of the last page of each
employee's signed welfare application. The District Attorney refused
the offer. To ward off any additional searches, the Tribe and its Gaming Corporation filed suit in Federal District Court against the District
Attorney and the Sheriff, in their individual and official capacities, and
Inyo County (County). Asserting federal-question jurisdiction under
28 U. S. C. $$ 1331, 1337, 1343(i)(3)(4), and the federal common law of
Indian affairs, the Tribe sought injunctive and declaratory relief to vindicate its status as a sovereign immune from state processes under federal law, and to establish that state law was preempted to the extent
that it purported to authorize seizure of tribal records. The Tribe also
sought relief under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, including compensatory damages,
alleging that the defendants violated the Tribe's and Gaming Corporation's Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights and the Tribe's right
to self-government. The District Court, on defendants' motion, dismissed the Tribe's complaint, holding, inter alia, that tribal sovereign
immunity did not categorically preclude the search and seizure of the
Casino's personnel records. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that
execution of a search warrant against the Tribe interfered with "the
right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by
them." Williams v. Lee, 358 U. S. 217, 220. Acknowledging a prior

decision in which it held that the right to tribal self-government is not
protected by $ 1983, the court concluded that, in this case, a $ 1983 claim
could be maintained because the Tribe sought protection from an unlawful search and seizure, a right secured by the Fourth Amendment and
therefore within $ 1983's compass.

Held:

1. The Tribe may not sue under $ 1983 to vindicate the sovereign
right it here claims. Section 1983 permits "citizen[s]" and "other person[s] within the jurisdiction" of the United States to seek legal and
equitable relief from "person[s]" who, under color of state law, deprive
them of federally protected rights. Although this case does not
squarely present the question, the Court assumes that tribes, like
States, are not subject to suit under $ 1983. See Will v. Michigan Dept.
of State Police, 491 U. S. 58. The issue pivotal here is whether a tribe
qualifies as a claimant--a "person within the jurisdiction" of the United
States--under $ 1983. Qualification of a sovereign as a "person" who
may maintain a particular claim for relief depends not "upon a bare
analysis of the word `person,' " Pfizer Inc. v. Government of India, 434

704 INYO COUNTY v. PAIUTE-SHOSHONE INDIANS OF

BISHOP COMMUNITY OF BISHOP COLONY

Opinion of the Court

Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case stems from a California county's investigation ofNative American tribe members for alleged off-reservation

crimes. Pursuing the investigation, county law enforcementofficers executed a state-court warrant for casino employment records kept by the Tribe on its reservation. TheTribe sued Inyo County (County), the District Attorney, and
the Sheriff in federal court, asserting sovereign immunityfrom state-court processes and seeking declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief.The parties and, as amicus curiae, the United States
agree that a Native American Tribe, like a State of theUnited States, is not a "person" subject to suit under 42
U. S. C. $ 1983. We hold that, in the situation here pre-sented, the Tribe does not qualify as a "person" who may
sue under $ 1983. Whether the Tribe's suit qualifies forfederal-court jurisdiction because it arises under some federal law other than $ 1983 is an issue the parties have notprecisely addressed, and the trial and appellate courts have
not clearly decided. We therefore remand the case forclose consideration and specific resolution of that threshold
question. I

The Bishop Paiute Tribe is a federally recognized tribelocated on the Bishop Paiute Reservation in California. The
Bishop Paiute Gaming Corporation, chartered and whollyowned by the Tribe, operates and manages the Paiute Palace
Casino (Casino), a tribal gaming operation run under theIndian Gaming Regulatory Act, 102 Stat. 2467, 25 U. S. C.

$ 2701 et seq.In March 1999, the Inyo County Department of Health and
Human Services (Department) received information from theState Department of Social Services indicating that three
Casino employees had failed to report Casino earnings ontheir applications for state welfare benefits. Brief for Petitioners 4-5. According to the County, the employees failed

705Cite as: 538 U. S. 701 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
to respond when the Department requested that they recon-cile the apparent discrepancies between their Casino earnings and their welfare application forms. Id., at 5. The De-partment then forwarded the matter to the Inyo County
District Attorney's Office, which, in turn, asked the employ-ees to reconcile the apparent discrepancies. Id., at 6. That
request, the County asserts, was also ignored. Ibid.In February 2000, the District Attorney's Office asked the
Casino for the three employees' employment records, ex-plaining that it was investigating "alleged welfare fraud."
291 F. 3d 549, 554 (CA9 2002). The Tribe responded that itsprivacy policy precluded release of the records without the
employees' consent.The District Attorney then sought and, on showing probable cause, obtained a search warrant from the Inyo CountySuperior Court. The warrant authorized a search of the Casino for payroll records of the three employees. On March23, 2000, the Inyo County Sheriff and the District Attorney
executed the warrant. They did so over the objection oftribal officials. Those officials urged that the state court
lacked jurisdiction to authorize a search of premises and sei-zure of records belonging to a sovereign tribe.

1 The Sheriff

and the District Attorney, lacking cooperation from theTribe, cut the locks off the storage facility containing the

Casino's personnel records. The county officials seized time-card entries, payroll registers, and payroll check registers
relating to the three employees; the seizure also garneredinformation contained in quarterly wage and withholding reports the Corporation had submitted to the State. Eachitem seized contained at least one reference to an employee
under investigation.In July 2000, the District Attorney's Office asked the Tribe
for the personnel records of six other Casino employees.

1 The United States maintains, and the County does not dispute, that
the Corporation is an "arm" of the Tribe for sovereign immunity purposes.

706 INYO COUNTY v. PAIUTE-SHOSHONE INDIANS OF

BISHOP COMMUNITY OF BISHOP COLONY

Opinion of the Court

The Tribe reiterated its privacy policy, but offered to accept
as evidence of consent a redacted copy of the last page of
each employee's signed welfare application. That page contained a statement that employment records of individuals
applying for public assistance were subject to review by
county officials. The District Attorney refused the offer.2

To ward off any additional searches, the Tribe and the Corporation filed suit in Federal District Court naming as defendants the District Attorney and the Sheriff, in their individual and official capacities, and the County. Asserting
federal-question jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. $$ 1331, 1337,
1343(i)(3)(4), and the "federal common law of Indian affairs,"
the Tribe sought injunctive and declaratory relief to vindicate its status as a sovereign immune from state processes
under federal law, and to establish that state law was
preempted to the extent that it purported to authorize
seizure of tribal records. App. 97, || 1, 105-114, |||| 26-53.
The Tribe's complaint also sought relief under 42 U. S. C.

$ 1983, including compensatory damages. In this regard, the
Tribe alleged that by acting beyond the scope of their jurisdiction and "without authorization of law" in executing the
warrant,3 the defendants violated the Tribe's and Corporation's Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, and the
Tribe's right to self-government. App. 109, || 38; see id., at
108-110, |||| 33-39.

2 At oral argument, the County defended this refusal by asserting that
federal law prohibited it from releasing the relevant pages of the employees' welfare applications. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4-5. But the United
States assured the Court that "[t]here is no Federal regulation or other
Federal requirement" that would have prevented the County from sharing
the relevant information with the Tribe. Id., at 21. This entire controversy, it thus appears, might have been avoided had the county officials
understood that federal law allowed the accommodation sought by the
Tribe.

3 The Tribe did not dispute the State's authority over the crimes under

investigation. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29.

707Cite as: 538 U. S. 701 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
On November 22, 2000, the District Court, on defendants'motion, dismissed the Tribe's complaint. Tribal sovereign

immunity, the court held, did not categorically preclude thesearch and seizure of the Casino's personnel records. Taking into account the competing interests of the State and theTribe, the court concluded that, "[i]n the interest of a fair and
uniform application of California's criminal law, state officials
should be able to execute search warrant[s] against the tribeand tribal property." App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a. The court

also held that the District Attorney and the Sheriff had qual-ified immunity from suit in their individual capacities.

Id.,
at 57a-58a.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the
District Court's judgment dismissing the action. "[E]xecution of a search warrant against the Tribe," the Court of
Appeals said, "interferes with `the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them.' " 291
F. 3d, at 558 (quoting Williams v. Lee, 358 U. S. 217, 220
(1959)). In the appellate court's view, the District Court
should not have "balanced the interests at stake" to determine whether the warrant was enforceable. 291 F. 3d, at
559. This Court's precedent, the Ninth Circuit said, advanced "a more categorical approach denying state jurisdiction . . . over a tribe absent a waiver by the tribe or a clear
grant of authority by Congress." Ibid. (citing Oklahoma
Tax Comm'n v. Chickasaw Nation, 515 U. S. 450, 458 (1995)).

"[E]ven if a balancing test is the appropriate legal framework," the Court of Appeals added, "the balance of interests
favors a ruling for the Tribe." 291 F. 3d, at 559. The
Tribe's privacy policies regarding employee records "promote tribal [self-government] interests," the Ninth Circuit
reasoned; notably, those policies fostered "a trusting relationship with tribal members," and "affect[ed] the Casino,
the Tribe's predominant source of economic development
revenue." Ibid. The appeals court recognized the State's
countervailing "interest in investigating potential welfare

Opinion of the Court

fraud," but thought it incumbent upon the State to furtherthat interest "through far less intrusive means." Ibid.

The Court of Appeals also ruled that the District Attorneyand the Sheriff were not shielded by qualified immunity.
"[A] reasonable county officer," it held, "would have known. . . that seizing tribal property held on tribal land violated
the Fourth Amendment because the property and land wereoutside the officer's jurisdiction."

Id., at 568. The appealscourt acknowledged prior Ninth Circuit precedent holding

that the right to tribal self-government is not protected by$ 1983. Id., at 568, n. 7 (citing Hoopa Valley Tribe v. Nevins,
881 F. 2d 657 (1989)); see Brief for United States as AmicusCuriae 29, n. 15. But in this case, the Court of Appeals
concluded, a $ 1983 claim could be maintained because theTribe sought "protection from an unlawful search and seizure," a right secured by the Fourth Amendment and there-fore within $ 1983's compass. 291 F. 3d, at 568, and n. 7.
On December 2, 2002, we granted certiorari. 537 U. S. 1043.

II
Central to our review is the question whether the Tribe'scomplaint is actionable under $ 1983. That provision permits "citizen[s]" and "other person[s] within the jurisdiction"of the United States to seek legal and equitable relief from
"person[s]" who, under color of state law, deprive them offederally protected rights.

4 In Will v. Michigan Dept. of

State Police, 491 U. S. 58 (1989), this Court held that a Stateis not a "person" amenable to suit under $ 1983. "[I]n enact4 The relevant portion of 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 reads: "Every person who,
under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any
State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be
subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the
jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party
injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for
redress."

Opinion of the Court
ing $ 1983," the Court said, "Congress did not intend to over-ride well-established immunities or defenses under the common law," including "[t]he doctrine of sovereign immunity."Id., at 67. Although this case does not squarely present the
question, the parties agree, and we will assume for purposesof this opinion, that Native American tribes, like States of
the Union, are not subject to suit under $ 1983. See Brief
for Petitioners 35-38; Tr. of Oral Arg. 49; Kiowa Tribe of
Okla. v. Manufacturing Technologies, Inc., 523 U. S. 751, 754
(1998) ("an Indian tribe is subject to suit only where Con-gress has authorized the suit or the tribe has waived its

immunity").The issue pivotal here is whether a tribe qualifies

as a
claimant--a "person within the jurisdiction" of the UnitedStates--under $ 1983.

5 The United States maintains it does

not, invoking the Court's "longstanding interpretive pre-sumption that `person' does not include the sovereign," a presumption that "may be disregarded only upon some affirma-tive showing of statutory intent to the contrary." Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 7-8 (quoting Vermont
Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S. 765, 780-781 (2000)); see Will, 491 U. S., at 64.
Nothing in the text, purpose, or history of $ 1983, the Gov-ernment contends, overcomes the interpretive presumption

5 Courts of Appeals have expressed divergent views on this question.
See Native Village of Venetie IRA Council v. Alaska, 155 F. 3d 1150,
1152, n. 1 (CA9 1998) (concluding that Tribes are persons entitled to sue
under $ 1983); American Vantage Co. v. Table Mountain Rancheria, 292
F. 3d 1091, 1097, n. 4 (CA9 2002) ("[I]t is doubtful whether [a] Tribe qua

Opinion of the Court

that " `person' does not include the sovereign." Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 7-8 (some internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, the Government urges,
given the Court's decision that "person" excludes sovereigns
as defendants under $ 1983, it would be anomalous for the
Court to give the same word a different meaning when it
appears later in the same sentence. Id., at 8; see Brown v.
Gardner, 513 U. S. 115, 118 (1994) (the "presumption that a
given term is used to mean the same thing throughout a
statute" is "surely at its most vigorous when a term is repeated within a given sentence"); cf. Lafayette v. Louisiana
Power & Light Co., 435 U. S. 389, 397 (1978) (because municipalities are "persons" entitled to sue under the antitrust
laws, they are also, in principle, "persons" capable of being
sued under those laws).

The Tribe responds that Congress intended $ 1983 "to provide a powerful civil remedy `against all forms of official violation of federally protected rights.' " Brief for Respondents 45 (quoting Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social
Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 700-701 (1978)). To achieve that remedial purpose, the Tribe maintains, $ 1983 should be "broadly
construed." Brief for Respondents 45 (citing Monell, 436
U. S., at 684-685 (internal quotation marks omitted)). Indian tribes, the Tribe here asserts, "have been especially vulnerable to infringement of their federally protected rights
by states." Brief for Respondents 42 (citing, inter alia, The
Kansas Indians, 5 Wall. 737 (1867) (state taxation of tribal
lands); Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians,
526 U. S. 172 (1999) (state infringement on tribal rights to
hunt, fish, and gather on ceded lands); Mississippi Band of
Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 490 U. S. 30 (1989) (tribal jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings); California
v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, 480 U. S. 202 (1987)
(state attempt to regulate gambling on tribal land)). To
guard against such infringements, the Tribe contends, the

711Cite as: 538 U. S. 701 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
Court should read $ 1983 to encompass suits brought by Indian tribes.

As we have recognized in other contexts, qualification of a
sovereign as a "person" who may maintain a particular claim
for relief depends not "upon a bare analysis of the word `person,' " Pfizer Inc. v. Government of India, 434 U. S. 308, 317
(1978), but on the "legislative environment" in which the
word appears, Georgia v. Evans, 316 U. S. 159, 161 (1942).
Thus, in Georgia, the Court held that a State, as purchaser
of asphalt shipped in interstate commerce, qualified as a
"person" entitled to seek redress under the Sherman Act for
restraint of trade. Id., at 160-163. Similarly, in Pfizer, the
Court held that a foreign nation, as purchaser of antibiotics,
ranked as a "person" qualified to sue pharmaceuticals manufacturers under our antitrust laws. 434 U. S., at 309-320;
cf. Stevens, 529 U. S., at 787, and n. 18 (deciding States are
not "person[s]" subject to qui tam liability under the False
Claims Act, but leaving open the question whether they "can
be `persons' for purposes of commencing an FCA qui tam
action" (emphasis deleted)); United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., 532 U. S. 200, 213 (2001) ("Although we
generally presume that identical words used in different
parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning,
the presumption is not rigid, and the meaning of the same
words well may vary to meet the purposes of the law." (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citations omitted)).

There is in this case no allegation that the County lacked
probable cause or that the warrant was otherwise defective.
It is only by virtue of the Tribe's asserted "sovereign" status
that it claims immunity from the County's processes. See
App. 97-105, |||| 1-25, 108-110, |||| 33-39; 291 F. 3d, at 554

property." (emphasis added)). Section 1983 was designed tosecure private rights against government encroachment, see

Will, 491 U. S., at 66, not to advance a sovereign's preroga-tive to withhold evidence relevant to a criminal investigation. For example, as the County acknowledges, a tribalmember complaining of a Fourth Amendment violation
would be a "person" qualified to sue under $ 1983. See Brieffor Petitioners 20, n. 7. But, like other private persons, that
member would have no right to immunity from an appropri-ately executed search warrant based on probable cause. Accordingly, we hold that the Tribe may not sue under $ 1983to vindicate the sovereign right it here claims.

6

III
In addition to $ 1983, the Tribe asserted as law underwhich its claims arise the "federal common law of Indian

affairs." Supra, at 706 (quoting App. 97, || 1). But theTribe has not explained, and neither the District Court nor
the Court of Appeals appears to have carefully considered,what prescription of federal common law enables a tribe to
maintain an action for declaratory and injunctive relief es-tablishing its sovereign right to be free from state criminal
processes. In short, absent $ 1983 as a foundation for theTribe's action, it is unclear what federal law, if any, the
Tribe's case "aris[es] under." 28 U. S. C. $ 1331. We there-fore remand for focused consideration and resolution of that
jurisdictional question.

* * *
The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals forthe Ninth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for

further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

(Stevens, J., concurring in judgment), in our view, to bracket them with
States of the Union in this regard.

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
Justice Stevens, concurring in the judgment.
In my judgment a Native American tribe is a "person"
who may sue under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. The Tribe's complaint, however, does not state a cause of action under $ 1983
because the county's alleged infringement of the Tribe's sovereign prerogatives did not deprive the Tribe of "rights,
privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and
laws" within the meaning of $ 1983. At bottom, rather than
relying on an Act of Congress or a provision of the Constitution, the Tribe's complaint rests on the judge-made doctrine
of tribal immunity--a doctrine that "developed almost by
accident." Kiowa Tribe of Okla. v. Manufacturing Technologies, Inc., 523 U. S. 751, 756 (1998). Because many applications of that doctrine are both anomalous and unjust, see id.,
at 760, 764-766 (Stevens, J., dissenting), I would not accord
it the same status as the "laws" referenced in $ 1983.

It is demeaning to Native American tribes to deny them
the same access to a $ 1983 remedy that is available to any
other person whose constitutional rights are violated by persons acting under color of state law. The text of $ 1983--
which provides that $ 1983 defendants are "person[s] who,
under color of [State law,]" subject any "other person" to a
deprivation of a federal right--adequately explains why a
tribe is not a person subject to suit under $ 1983. For tribes
generally do not act under color of state law. But that text
sheds no light on the question whether the tribe is an "other
person" who may bring a $ 1983 suit when the tribe is the
victim of a constitutional violation. The ordinary meaning
of the word "person" as used in federal statutes,1 as well as
the specific remedial purpose of $ 1983, support the conclu1 The Dictionary Act, which was passed just two months before $ 1983
and was designed to supply rules of construction for all legislation, provided that "the word `person' may extend and be applied to bodies politic
and corporate . . . ." Act of Feb. 25, 1871, $ 2, 16 Stat. 431.

sion that a tribe should be able to invoke the protections ofthe statute if its constitutional rights are violated.

2

In this case, however, the Tribe's allegations do not statea cause of action under $ 1983. The execution of the warrant

challenged in this case would unquestionably have been law-ful if the casino had been the property of an ordinary commercial corporation. See ante, at 711 ("There is in this caseno allegation that the County lacked probable cause or that
the warrant was otherwise defective"). Thus, the Triberests its case entirely on its claim that, as a sovereign, it
should be accorded a special immunity that private casinosdo not enjoy. See

ibid. That sort of claim to special privi-leges, which is based entirely on the Tribe's sovereign status,

is not one for which the $ 1983 remedy was enacted.Accordingly, while I agree with the Court that the judgment should be set aside, I do not join the Court's opinion.

2 Our holding in Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S. 58, 65
(1989), that a State is not a "person" within $ 1983 is fully consistent with
this view. Will rested on "the ordinary rule of statutory construction
that if Congress intends to alter the `usual constitutional balance between
the States and the Federal Government,' it must make its intention to do
so `unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.' Atascadero State
Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 242 (1985); see also Pennhurst State
School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 99 (1984)." Ibid.

CITY OF LOS ANGELES v. DAVID
on petition for writ of certiorari to the unitedstates court of appeals for the ninth circuit

No. 02-1212. Decided May 19, 2003
Respondent David paid petitioner Los Angeles $134.50 to recover his car,

which had been towed from a spot where parking was prohibited, and
requested a hearing to recover the money. The hearing was held 27
days after the car was towed and his claim was denied. He then filed
a 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 suit, claiming that the city violated his due process
rights by failing to provide a sufficiently prompt hearing. The District
Court granted the city summary judgment, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the Constitution required the city to provide an
earlier hearing, perhaps within 48 hours of towing and at least within
5 days.

Held: The Due Process Clause does not prohibit an agency from imposing

the kind of procedural delay experienced here when holding hearings
to consider claims such as David's. The three factors that normally
determine whether an individual has received the "process" that the
Constitution finds "due"--which were set forth in Mathews v. Eldridge,
424 U. S. 319, 335, and applied in FDIC v. Mallen, 486 U. S. 230, 242--
require reversal of the Ninth Circuit's decision. The first factor--the
"private interest" affected by the official action--is a monetary interest
that does not work the far more serious harm caused by the temporary
deprivation of a job that was at issue in Mallen. The second factor--
concern for accuracy--also does not support the Ninth Circuit's conclusion. A 30-day delay in presenting evidence is unlikely to spawn significant factual errors, and the nature of the issue--whether a car is
illegally parked--indicates that initial towing errors are unlikely. The
third factor--the government's interest--argues strongly in the city's
favor. Only five percent of the 1,000 impound hearings the city holds
annually are conducted within 48 hours, and those involve persons who
cannot afford the impoundment fees. The delay is substantially required by administrative needs related to organizing the hearing, e. g.,
arranging for the towing officer to appear. Requiring the city to hold
1,000 hearings, rather than 50, within a short time period would prove
burdensome.

Certiorari granted; 307 F. 3d 1143, reversed.

716 LOS ANGELES v. DAVID

Per Curiam
Per Curiam.
On August 13, 1998, an officer of the city of Los Angeles
Department of Transportation ordered respondent Edwin
David's automobile towed from a spot where parking was
forbidden. After paying $134.50, David recovered his car.
David, believing that the trees obstructed his view of the
"no parking" sign, requested a hearing to recover the money.
On September 9, 1998--27 days after the vehicle was
towed--the city held the hearing and denied David's claim.

David then brought this lawsuit in Federal District Court
under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, arguing that the
city, in failing to provide a sufficiently prompt hearing, had
violated his federal right to "due process of law." Amdt. 14,

$ 1. The District Court granted summary judgment for the
city. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, by a vote
of 2 to 1, reversed, holding that the Constitution required the
city to provide an earlier payment-recovery hearing, perhaps
within 48 hours of the towing and at least within 5 days.
307 F. 3d 1143, 1147 (2002). The city, seeking certiorari
here, argues that the Ninth Circuit's holding runs contrary
to well-settled principles of constitutional law. We agree.
We grant the writ and summarily reverse the Ninth Circuit's judgment.

In Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 335 (1976), the
Court set forth three factors that normally determine
whether an individual has received the "process" that the
Constitution finds "due":

"First, the private interest that will be affected by the
official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and
the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and
administrative burdens that the additional or substitute
procedural requirement would entail."

Per Curiam
By weighing these concerns, courts can determine whethera State has met the "fundamental requirement of due process"--"the opportunity to be heard `at a meaningful time andin a meaningful manner.' "

Id., at 333.
In FDIC v. Mallen, 486 U. S. 230, 242 (1988), the Courtconsidered circumstances in which "impairment of an individual's property is not preceded by any opportunity for a
pre-deprivation hearing." A Government agency had sus-pended an indicted bank employee from his job. A statute

required the agency to provide a postdeprivation hearingwithin 30 days and to issue a decision within 60 days of that
hearing. The bank employee claimed that the 30- or 90-day
delay between (a) the suspension and (b) the postsuspension
hearing and decision violated the Due Process Clause. The
Court recognized that there "is a point at which an unjustified delay in completing a post-deprivation proceeding
`would become a constitutional violation.' " Ibid. It applied Eldridge-type factors to determine whether that point
had been reached. 486 U. S., at 242 (assessing the importance of, and harm to, the private interest, the likelihood of
interim error, and the governmental interest in a delay).
And it concluded that a 30-day delay of the hearing, and a
potential 90-day delay of a decision, did not violate the Constitution. Id., at 243.

Eldridge, as applied in Mallen, requires reversal of the
Ninth Circuit's decision. The first Eldridge factor, the
"private interest," is a monetary interest here. It consists
of the private individual's interest in maintaining the use of
money between (a) the time of paying the impoundment and
towing fees and (b) the time of the hearing. The temporary
deprivation of a job, the "private interest" at issue in Mallen,
typically works a far more serious harm. Cf. Eldridge,
supra, at 340 (distinguishing in this respect between benefits "not based upon financial need" and welfare assistance
"given to persons on the very margin of subsistence"). So
does a temporary deprivation of the use of the automobile

itself--the relevant deprivation at issue in the lower courtcases to which the Ninth Circuit looked for support. See

Stypmann v. San Francisco, 557 F. 2d 1338, 1342-1344 (CA91977). Cf.

Goichman v. Rheuban Motors, Inc., 682 F. 2d
1320, 1324 (CA9 1982). Indeed, the city indicates that anyloss in the time value of the money can be compensated by

an interest payment. Pet. for Cert. 7.

The second Eldridge factor--concern for accuracy--doesnot support the Ninth Circuit's conclusion. A 30-day delay

in presenting evidence is unlikely to spawn significant factualerrors. Administrative and judicial proceedings normally
take place after considerably more time has elapsed. And
the straightforward nature of the issue--whether the car
was illegally parked--indicates that initial towing errors,
while they may occur, are unlikely. Cf. Mallen, supra, at
244-245 (finding "little likelihood that the deprivation is
without basis" in light of the grand jury indictment).

The third Eldridge factor--the "Government's interest"--
argues strongly in the city's favor. The nature of the city's
interest in delay is one of administrative necessity. The city
points out that it "conducts more than a thousand vehicle
impound hearings annually." Pet. for Cert. 8. It holds
about five percent of these hearings--those involving individuals who are unable to afford the impoundment fees--
within 48 hours. Ibid. It "takes time to organize hearings:
there are only so many courtrooms and presiding officials;
the city has to contact the towing officer and arrange for his
appearance; the city may have to find a substitute to cover
that officer's responsibilities while he attends the hearing."
307 F. 3d, at 1149 (Kozinski, J., dissenting). And the Ninth
Circuit's holding, which presumably would require the city
to schedule annually 1,000 or more hearings, instead of 50
hearings, within a 48-hour (or 5-day) time limit, will prove
burdensome. The administrative resources available to
modern police departments are not limitless. The administrative necessity supporting the delay here is no less sub538US2 Unit: $U55 [10-27-04 16:30:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN

stantial than the governmental interest in the 30-day hear-ing delay in Mallen, namely, the need to protect the integrity

of the banking system and to prepare thoroughly for thehearing. Mallen, supra, at 244. We also add that the reason for denying a predeprivation hearing here--such a hear-ing is impossible if the city is to be able to enforce the parking rules--is not any less important than in Mallen.We conclude that the 27-day delay in holding a hearing
here reflects no more than a routine delay substantially re-quired by administrative needs. Our cases make clear that
the Due Process Clause does not prohibit an agency fromimposing this kind of procedural delay when holding hearings to consider claims of the kind here at issue. The NinthCircuit's judgment to the contrary is reversed.

It is so ordered.

NEVADA DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES

et al. v. HIBBS et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 01-1368. Argued January 15, 2003--Decided May 27, 2003
Respondent Hibbs (hereinafter respondent), an employee of the Nevada

Department of Human Resources (Department), sought leave to care for
his ailing wife under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA),
which entitles an eligible employee to take up to 12 work weeks of
unpaid leave annually for the onset of a "serious health condition" in the
employee's spouse and for other reasons, 29 U. S. C. $ 2612(a)(1)(C).
The Department granted respondent's request for the full 12 weeks of
FMLA leave, but eventually informed him that he had exhausted
that leave and that he must report to work by a certain date. Respondent failed to do so and was terminated. Pursuant to FMLA provisions
creating a private right of action to seek both equitable relief and
money damages "against any employer (including a public agency),"

$ 2617(a)(2), that "interfere[d] with, restrain[ed], or den[ied] the exercise
of" FMLA rights, $ 2615(a)(1), respondent sued petitioners, the Department and two of its officers, in Federal District Court seeking damages
and injunctive and declaratory relief for, inter alia, violations of

$ 2612(a)(1)(C). The court awarded petitioners summary judgment on
the grounds that the FMLA claim was barred by the Eleventh Amendment and that respondent's Fourteenth Amendment rights had not been
violated. The Ninth Circuit reversed.

Held: State employees may recover money damages in federal court in

the event of the State's failure to comply with the FMLA's family-care
provision. Congress may abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment
immunity from suit in federal court if it makes its intention to abrogate
unmistakably clear in the language of the statute and acts pursuant to
a valid exercise of its power under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.
See, e. g., Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S. 356,
363. The FMLA satisfies the clear statement rule. See Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 73-78. Congress also acted within its
authority under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment when it sought to
abrogate the States' immunity for purposes of the FMLA's family-leave
provision. In the exercise of its $ 5 power, Congress may enact socalled prophylactic legislation that proscribes facially constitutional con538US2 Unit: $U57 [02-10-05 13:08:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

duct in order to prevent and deter unconstitutional conduct, e. g., City
of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 536, but it may not attempt to substantively redefine the States' legal obligations, Kimel, supra, at 88.
The test for distinguishing appropriate prophylactic legislation from
substantive redefinition is that valid $ 5 legislation must exhibit "congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end." City of Boerne, supra, at
520. The FMLA aims to protect the right to be free from gender-based
discrimination in the workplace. Statutory classifications that distinguish between males and females are subject to heightened scrutiny,
see, e. g., Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 197-199; i. e., they must "serv[e]
important governmental objectives," and "the discriminatory means
employed [must be] substantially related to the achievement of those
objectives," United States v. Virginia, 518 U. S. 515, 533. When it
enacted the FMLA, Congress had before it significant evidence of a
long and extensive history of sex discrimination with respect to the
administration of leave benefits by the States, which is weighty enough
to justify the enactment of prophylactic $ 5 legislation. Cf. Fitzpatrick
v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445, 456. Garrett, supra, and Kimel, supra, in which
the Court reached the opposite conclusion, are distinguished on the
ground that the $ 5 legislation there at issue responded to a purported
tendency of state officials to make age- or disability-based distinctions,
characteristics that are not judged under a heightened review standard,
but pass equal protection muster if there is a rational basis for enacting
them. See, e. g., Kimel, supra, at 86. Here, because the standard for
demonstrating the constitutionality of a gender-based classification is
more difficult to meet than the rational-basis test, it was easier for Congress to show a pattern of state constitutional violations. Cf. South
Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 308-313. The impact of the discrimination targeted by the FMLA, which is based on mutually reinforcing stereotypes that only women are responsible for family caregiving
and that men lack domestic responsibilities, is significant. Moreover,
Congress' chosen remedy, the FMLA's family-care provision, is "congruent and proportional to the targeted violation," Garrett, supra, at 374.
Congress had already tried unsuccessfully to address this problem
through Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Pregnancy
Discrimination Act. Where previous legislative attempts have failed,
see Katzenbach, supra, at 313, such problems may justify added prophylactic measures in response, Kimel, supra, at 88. By creating an
across-the-board, routine employment benefit for all eligible employees,
Congress sought to ensure that family-care leave would no longer be
stigmatized as an inordinate drain on the workplace caused by female

Syllabus
employees, and that employers could not evade leave obligations simply
by hiring men. Unlike the statutes at issue in City of Boerne, Kimel,
and Garrett, which applied broadly to every aspect of state employers'
operations, the FMLA is narrowly targeted at the faultline between
work and family--precisely where sex-based overgeneralization has
been and remains strongest--and affects only one aspect of the employment relationship. Also significant are the many other limitations that
Congress placed on the FMLA's scope. See Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 527 U. S. 627, 647.
For example, the FMLA requires only unpaid leave, $ 2612(a)(1); applies
only to employees who have worked for the employer for at least one
year and provided 1,250 hours of service within the last 12 months,

$ 2611(2)(A); and does not apply to employees in high-ranking or sensitive positions, including state elected officials, their staffs, and appointed
policymakers, $$ 2611(2)(B)(i) and (3), 203(e)(2)(C). Pp. 726-740.

ployer "interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of "
FMLA rights, $ 2615(a)(1). We hold that employees of the
State of Nevada may recover money damages in the event
of the State's failure to comply with the family-care provision
of the Act.

Petitioners include the Nevada Department of Human Resources (Department) and two of its officers. Respondent
William Hibbs (hereinafter respondent) worked for the Department's Welfare Division. In April and May 1997, he
sought leave under the FMLA to care for his ailing wife,
who was recovering from a car accident and neck surgery.
The Department granted his request for the full 12 weeks of
FMLA leave and authorized him to use the leave intermittently as needed between May and December 1997. Respondent did so until August 5, 1997, after which he did not
return to work. In October 1997, the Department informed
respondent that he had exhausted his FMLA leave, that no
further leave would be granted, and that he must report to
work by November 12, 1997. Respondent failed to do so and
was terminated.

Respondent sued petitioners in the United States District
Court seeking damages and injunctive and declaratory relief
for, inter alia, violations of 29 U. S. C. $ 2612(a)(1)(C). The
District Court awarded petitioners summary judgment on
the grounds that the FMLA claim was barred by the Eleventh Amendment and that respondent's Fourteenth Amendment rights had not been violated. Respondent appealed,
and the United States intervened under 28 U. S. C. $ 2403 to
defend the validity of the FMLA's application to the States.
The Ninth Circuit reversed. 273 F. 3d 844 (2001).

We granted certiorari, 536 U. S. 938 (2002), to resolve a
split among the Courts of Appeals on the question whether
an individual may sue a State for money damages in federal
court for violation of $ 2612(a)(1)(C). Compare Kazmier v.

Opinion of the Court
Widmann, 225 F. 3d 519, 526, 529 (CA5 2000), with 273 F. 3d844 (case below).

For over a century now, we have made clear that the Con-stitution does not provide for federal jurisdiction over suits
against nonconsenting States. Board of Trustees of Univ.
of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S. 356, 363 (2001); Kimel v. Florida
Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 72-73 (2000); College Savings
Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd.,527 U. S. 666, 669-670 (1999);

Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 54 (1996); Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1,15 (1890).

Congress may, however, abrogate such immunity in federal
court if it makes its intention to abrogate unmistakably clear
in the language of the statute and acts pursuant to a valid
exercise of its power under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Garrett, supra, at 363; Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U. S. 775, 786 (1991) (citing Dellmuth v.
Muth, 491 U. S. 223, 228 (1989)). The clarity of Congress'
intent here is not fairly debatable. The Act enables employees to seek damages "against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction," 29 U. S. C. $ 2617(a)(2), and Congress has defined
"public agency" to include both "the government of a State
or political subdivision thereof " and "any agency of . . .
a State, or a political subdivision of a State," $$ 203(x),
2611(4)(A)(iii). We held in Kimel that, by using identical language in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act
of 1967 (ADEA), 81 Stat. 602, as amended, 29 U. S. C.

$ 621 et seq., Congress satisfied the clear statement rule of
Dellmuth. 528 U. S., at 73-78. This case turns, then, on
whether Congress acted within its constitutional authority
when it sought to abrogate the States' immunity for purposes of the FMLA's family-leave provision.

In enacting the FMLA, Congress relied on two of the powers vested in it by the Constitution: its Article I commerce
power and its power under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment

Opinion of the Court
to enforce that Amendment's guarantees.1 Congress may
not abrogate the States' sovereign immunity pursuant to its
Article I power over commerce. Seminole Tribe, supra.
Congress may, however, abrogate States' sovereign immunity through a valid exercise of its $ 5 power, for "the Eleventh Amendment, and the principle of state sovereignty
which it embodies, are necessarily limited by the enforcement provisions of $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment."
Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445, 456 (1976) (citation omitted). See also Garrett, supra, at 364; Kimel, supra, at 80.

Two provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment are relevant here: Section 5 grants Congress the power "to enforce"
the substantive guarantees of $ 1--among them, equal protection of the laws--by enacting "appropriate legislation."
Congress may, in the exercise of its $ 5 power, do more than
simply proscribe conduct that we have held unconstitutional.
" `Congress' power "to enforce" the Amendment includes the
authority both to remedy and to deter violation of rights
guaranteed thereunder by prohibiting a somewhat broader
swath of conduct, including that which is not itself forbidden
by the Amendment's text.' " Garrett, supra, at 365 (quoting
Kimel, supra, at 81); City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507,
536 (1997); Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641, 658 (1966).
In other words, Congress may enact so-called prophylactic

legislation that proscribes facially constitutional conduct, inorder to prevent and deter unconstitutional conduct.

City of Boerne also confirmed, however, that it falls to thisCourt, not Congress, to define the substance of constitutional
guarantees. 521 U. S., at 519-524. "The ultimate interpre-tation and determination of the Fourteenth Amendment's
substantive meaning remains the province of the JudicialBranch."

Kimel, 528 U. S., at 81. Section 5 legislationreaching beyond the scope of $ 1's actual guarantees must

be an appropriate remedy for identified constitutional viola-tions, not "an attempt to substantively redefine the States'
legal obligations." Id., at 88. We distinguish appropriateprophylactic legislation from "substantive redefinition of the
Fourteenth Amendment right at issue," id., at 81, by apply-ing the test set forth in City of Boerne: Valid $ 5 legislation
must exhibit "congruence and proportionality between theinjury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted
to that end," 521 U. S., at 520.The FMLA aims to protect the right to be free from
gender-based discrimination in the workplace.2 We haveheld that statutory classifications that distinguish between
males and females are subject to heightened scrutiny. See,
e. g., Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 197-199 (1976). For agender-based classification to withstand such scrutiny, it

must "serv[e] important governmental objectives," and "thediscriminatory means employed [must be] substantially related to the achievement of those objectives." United

2 The text of the Act makes this clear. Congress found that, "due to the
nature of the roles of men and women in our society, the primary responsibility for family caretaking often falls on women, and such responsibility
affects the working lives of women more than it affects the working lives
of men." 29 U. S. C. $ 2601(a)(5). In response to this finding, Congress
sought "to accomplish the [Act's other] purposes . . . in a manner that . . .
minimizes the potential for employment discrimination on the basis of sex
by ensuring generally that leave is available . . . on a gender-neutral
basis[,] and to promote the goal of equal employment opportunity for
women and men . . . ." $$ 2601(b)(4) and (5) (emphasis added).

States v. Virginia, 518 U. S. 515, 533 (1996) (citations andinternal quotation marks omitted). The State's justification

for such a classification "must not rely on overbroad general-izations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences
of males and females." Ibid. We now inquire whetherCongress had evidence of a pattern of constitutional violations on the part of the States in this area.

The history of the many state laws limiting women's em-ployment opportunities is chronicled in--and, until relatively

recently, was sanctioned by--this Court's own opinions.For example, in

Bradwell v. State, 16 Wall. 130 (1873) (Illinois), and Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U. S. 464, 466 (1948) (Michigan), the Court upheld state laws prohibiting women from
practicing law and tending bar, respectively. State laws frequently subjected women to distinctive restrictions, terms,
conditions, and benefits for those jobs they could take. In
Muller v. Oregon, 208 U. S. 412, 419, n. 1 (1908), for example,
this Court approved a state law limiting the hours that
women could work for wages, and observed that 19 States
had such laws at the time. Such laws were based on the
related beliefs that (1) a woman is, and should remain, "the
center of home and family life," Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U. S. 57,
62 (1961), and (2) "a proper discharge of [a woman's] maternal
functions--having in view not merely her own health, but
the well-being of the race--justif[ies] legislation to protect
her from the greed as well as the passion of man," Muller,
supra, at 422. Until our decision in Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S.
71 (1971), "it remained the prevailing doctrine that government, both federal and state, could withhold from women
opportunities accorded men so long as any `basis in reason' "--such as the above beliefs--"could be conceived for the
discrimination." Virginia, supra, at 531 (quoting Goesaert,
supra, at 467).

Congress responded to this history of discrimination by
abrogating States' sovereign immunity in Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 255, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a),

Opinion of the Court
and we sustained this abrogation in Fitzpatrick. But stategender discrimination did not cease. "[I]t can hardly be

doubted that . . . women still face pervasive, although attimes more subtle, discrimination . . . in the job market."
Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677, 686 (1973). Accord-ing to evidence that was before Congress when it enacted
the FMLA, States continue to rely on invalid gender stereo-types in the employment context, specifically in the administration of leave benefits. Reliance on such stereotypes can-not justify the States' gender discrimination in this area.
Virginia, supra, at 533. The long and extensive history
of sex discrimination prompted us to hold that measuresthat differentiate on the basis of gender warrant heightened

scrutiny; here, as in Fitzpatrick, the persistence of suchunconstitutional discrimination by the States justifies Congress' passage of prophylactic $ 5 legislation.As the FMLA's legislative record reflects, a 1990 Bureau
of Labor Statistics (BLS) survey stated that 37 percent ofsurveyed private-sector employees were covered by maternity leave policies, while only 18 percent were covered by
paternity leave policies. S. Rep. No. 103-3, pp. 14-15 (1993).The corresponding numbers from a similar BLS survey

the previous year were 33 percent and 16 percent, respec-tively.

Ibid. While these data show an increase in the percentage of employees eligible for such leave, they also showa widening of the gender gap during the same period. Thus,

stereotype-based beliefs about the allocation of family du-ties remained firmly rooted, and employers' reliance on
them in establishing discriminatory leave policies remainedwidespread.

sector, a 50-state survey also before Congress demonstrated that "[t]he

Congress also heard testimony that "[p]arental leave forfathers . . . is rare. Even . . . [w]here child-care leave policies

do exist, men, both in the public and private sectors, receivenotoriously discriminatory treatment in their requests for
such leave." Joint Hearing 147 (Washington Council ofLawyers) (emphasis added). Many States offered women
extended "maternity" leave that far exceeded the typical 4-to 8-week period of physical disability due to pregnancy and
childbirth,4 but very few States granted men a parallel bene-fit: Fifteen States provided women up to one year of extended maternity leave, while only four provided men withthe same. M. Lord & M. King, The State Reference Guide
to Work-Family Programs for State Employees 30 (1991).This and other differential leave policies were not attributable to any differential physical needs of men and women,but rather to the pervasive sex-role stereotype that caring
for family members is women's work.5

5 For example, state employers' collective-bargaining agreements often

granted extended "maternity" leave of six months to a year to women
only. Gerald McEntee, President of the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, testified that "the vast majority of our contracts, even though we look upon them with great pride,
really cover essentially maternity leave, and not paternity leave." The

on Labor and Human Resources, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, p. 385 (1987)
(hereinafter 1987 Senate Labor Hearings). In addition, state leave laws
often specified that catchall leave-without-pay provisions could be used for
extended maternity leave, but did not authorize such leave for paternity
purposes. See, e. g., Family and Medical Leave Act of 1987: Joint Hearing
before the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, 100th Cong.,

Opinion of the Court
Finally, Congress had evidence that, even where state laws
and policies were not facially discriminatory, they were applied in discriminatory ways. It was aware of the "serious
problems with the discretionary nature of family leave," because when "the authority to grant leave and to arrange the
length of that leave rests with individual supervisors," it
leaves "employees open to discretionary and possibly unequal treatment." H. R. Rep. No. 103-8, pt. 2, pp. 10-11
(1993). Testimony supported that conclusion, explaining
that "[t]he lack of uniform parental and medical leave policies
in the work place has created an environment where [sex]
discrimination is rampant." 1987 Senate Labor Hearings,
pt. 2, at 170 (testimony of Peggy Montes, Mayor's Commission on Women's Affairs, City of Chicago).

In spite of all of the above evidence, Justice Kennedy
argues in dissent that Congress' passage of the FMLA was
unnecessary because "the States appear to have been ahead
of Congress in providing gender-neutral family leave benefits," post, at 750, and points to Nevada's leave policies in
particular, post, at 755. However, it was only "[s]ince Federal family leave legislation was first introduced" that the
States had even "begun to consider similar family leave initiatives." S. Rep. No. 103-3, at 20; see also S. Rep. No. 102-

1st Sess., 2-5 (1987) (Rep. Gary Ackerman recounted suffering expressly
sex-based denial of unpaid leave of absence where benefit was ostensibly
available for "child care leave").

Evidence pertaining to parenting leave is relevant here because state
discrimination in the provision of both types of benefits is based on the
same gender stereotype: that women's family duties trump those of the
workplace. Justice Kennedy's dissent (hereinafter dissent) ignores this
common foundation that, as Congress found, has historically produced discrimination in the hiring and promotion of women. See post, at 748-749.
Consideration of such evidence does not, as the dissent contends, expand
our $ 5 inquiry to include "general gender-based stereotypes in employment." Post, at 749 (emphasis added). To the contrary, because parenting and family leave address very similar situations in which work and
family responsibilities conflict, they implicate the same stereotypes.

68, p. 77 (1991) (minority views of Sen. Durenberger) ("[S]o
few states have elected to enact similar legislation at the
state level").

Furthermore, the dissent's statement that some States
"had adopted some form of family-care leave" before the
FMLA's enactment, post, at 750, glosses over important
shortcomings of some state policies. First, seven States had
childcare leave provisions that applied to women only. Indeed, Massachusetts required that notice of its leave provisions be posted only in "establishment[s] in which females
are employed." 6 These laws reinforced the very stereotypes that Congress sought to remedy through the FMLA.
Second, 12 States provided their employees no family leave,
beyond an initial childbirth or adoption, to care for a seriously ill child or family member.7 Third, many States pro6 Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 149, $ 105D (West 1997) (providing leave to "female employee[s]" for childbirth or adoption); see also 3 Colo. Code Regs.

The dissent asserts that four of these schemes--those of Colorado, Iowa,
Louisiana, and New Hampshire--concern "pregnancy disability leave
only." Post, at 752. But Louisiana provided women with four months
of such leave, which far exceeds the medically recommended pregnancy
disability leave period of six weeks. See n. 4, supra. This genderdiscriminatory policy is not attributable to any different physical needs of
men and women, but rather to the invalid stereotypes that Congress
sought to counter through the FMLA. See supra, at 731.

such discretionary family-leave programs would do little tocombat the stereotypes about the roles of male and female

employees that Congress sought to eliminate. Finally, fourStates provided leave only through administrative regulations or personnel policies, which Congress could reasonablyconclude offered significantly less firm protection than a federal law.9 Against the above backdrop of limited state leavepolicies, no matter how generous petitioners' own may have

10 Contrary to the dissent's belief, we do not hold that Congress may

"abrogat[e] state immunity from private suits whenever the State's social
benefits program is not enshrined in the statutory code and provides employers with discretion," post, at 753, or when a State does not confer
social benefits "as generous or extensive as Congress would later deem
appropriate," post, at 752. The dissent misunderstands the purpose of
the FMLA's family-leave provision. The FMLA is not a "substantive entitlement program," post, at 754; Congress did not create a particular leave
policy for its own sake. See infra, at 737-738. Rather, Congress sought
to adjust family-leave policies in order to eliminate their reliance on, and
perpetuation of, invalid stereotypes, and thereby dismantle persisting
gender-based barriers to the hiring, retention, and promotion of women in
the workplace. In pursuing that goal, for the reasons discussed above,

Opinion of the Court
In sum, the States' record of unconstitutional participation
in, and fostering of, gender-based discrimination in the administration of leave benefits is weighty enough to justify
the enactment of prophylactic $ 5 legislation.11

We reached the opposite conclusion in Garrett and Kimel.
In those cases, the $ 5 legislation under review responded
to a purported tendency of state officials to make age- or
disability-based distinctions. Under our equal protection
case law, discrimination on the basis of such characteristics is
not judged under a heightened review standard, and passes
muster if there is "a rational basis for doing so at a classbased level, even if it `is probably not true' that those reasons
are valid in the majority of cases." Kimel, 528 U. S., at 86
(quoting Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 473 (1991)). See
also Garrett, 531 U. S., at 367 ("States are not required by
the Fourteenth Amendment to make special accommodations
for the disabled, so long as their actions toward such individuals are rational"). Thus, in order to impugn the constitutionality of state discrimination against the disabled or the
elderly, Congress must identify, not just the existence of ageor disability-based state decisions, but a "widespread pattern" of irrational reliance on such criteria. Kimel, supra,
at 90. We found no such showing with respect to the ADEA
and Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990
(ADA). Kimel, supra, at 89; Garrett, supra, at 368.

supra, at 733-734 and this page, Congress reasonably concluded that state
leave laws and practices should be brought within the Act.

11 Given the extent and specificity of the above record of unconstitutional

state conduct, it is difficult to understand the dissent's accusation that we
rely on "a simple recitation of a general history of employment discrimination against women." Post, at 746. As we stated above, our holding
rests on congressional findings that, at the time the FMLA was enacted,
States "rel[ied] on invalid gender stereotypes in the employment context,
specifically in the administration of leave benefits." Supra, at 730 (emphasis added). See supra, at 730-732.

Opinion of the Court
Here, however, Congress directed its attention to stategender discrimination, which triggers a heightened level of

scrutiny. See, e. g., Craig, 429 U. S., at 197-199. Becausethe standard for demonstrating the constitutionality of a
gender-based classification is more difficult to meet than ourrational-basis test--it must "serv[e] important governmental
objectives" and be "substantially related to the achievement
of those objectives," Virginia, 518 U. S., at 533--it was eas-ier for Congress to show a pattern of state constitutional

violations. Congress was similarly successful in South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 308-313 (1966), where we
upheld the Voting Rights Act of 1965: Because racial classifi-cations are presumptively invalid, most of the States' acts of

race discrimination violated the Fourteenth Amendment.The impact of the discrimination targeted by the FMLA
is significant. Congress determined:

"Historically, denial or curtailment of women's employment opportunities has been traceable directly to thepervasive presumption that women are mothers first,

and workers second. This prevailing ideology aboutwomen's roles has in turn justified discrimination
against women when they are mothers or mothers-to-be." Joint Hearing 100.

Stereotypes about women's domestic roles are reinforcedby parallel stereotypes presuming a lack of domestic responsibilities for men. Because employers continued to regardthe family as the woman's domain, they often denied men
similar accommodations or discouraged them from takingleave. These mutually reinforcing stereotypes created a
self-fulfilling cycle of discrimination that forced women to
continue to assume the role of primary family caregiver, and
fostered employers' stereotypical views about women's commitment to work and their value as employees. Those perceptions, in turn, Congress reasoned, lead to subtle discrimination that may be difficult to detect on a case-by-case basis.

737Cite as: 538 U. S. 721 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
We believe that Congress' chosen remedy, the family-careleave provision of the FMLA, is "congruent and proportional

to the targeted violation," Garrett, supra, at 374. Congresshad already tried unsuccessfully to address this problem
through Title VII and the amendment of Title VII by thePregnancy Discrimination Act, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e(k). Here,
as in Katzenbach, supra, Congress again confronted a "difficult and intractable proble[m]," Kimel, supra, at 88, whereprevious legislative attempts had failed. See

Katzenbach,
supra, at 313 (upholding the Voting Rights Act). Such prob-lems may justify added prophylactic measures in response.

Kimel, supra, at 88.

By creating an across-the-board, routine employment benefit for all eligible employees, Congress sought to ensure that
family-care leave would no longer be stigmatized as an inordinate drain on the workplace caused by female employees,
and that employers could not evade leave obligations simply
by hiring men. By setting a minimum standard of family
leave for all eligible employees, irrespective of gender, the
FMLA attacks the formerly state-sanctioned stereotype that
only women are responsible for family caregiving, thereby
reducing employers' incentives to engage in discrimination
by basing hiring and promotion decisions on stereotypes.

The dissent characterizes the FMLA as a "substantive entitlement program" rather than a remedial statute because
it establishes a floor of 12 weeks' leave. Post, at 754. In
the dissent's view, in the face of evidence of gender-based
discrimination by the States in the provision of leave benefits, Congress could do no more in exercising its $ 5 power
than simply proscribe such discrimination. But this position
cannot be squared with our recognition that Congress "is not
confined to the enactment of legislation that merely parrots
the precise wording of the Fourteenth Amendment," but
may prohibit "a somewhat broader swath of conduct, including that which is not itself forbidden by the Amendment's
text." Kimel, supra, at 81. For example, this Court has

538US2 Unit: $U57 [02-10-05 13:08:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN
738 NEVADA DEPT. OF HUMAN RESOURCES v. HIBBS

Opinion of the Court
upheld certain prophylactic provisions of the Voting RightsAct as valid exercises of Congress' $ 5 power, including the

literacy test ban and preclearance requirements for changesin States' voting procedures. See,

e. g., Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641 (1966); Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U. S. 112(1970);

South Carolina v. Katzenbach, supra.
Indeed, in light of the evidence before Congress, a statute
mirroring Title VII, that simply mandated gender equalityin the administration of leave benefits, would not have

achieved Congress' remedial object. Such a law would allowStates to provide for no family leave at all. Where "[t]wothirds of the nonprofessional caregivers for older, chronically
ill, or disabled persons are working women," H. R. Rep.
No. 103-8, pt. 1, at 24; S. Rep. No. 103-3, at 7, and state
practices continue to reinforce the stereotype of women as
caregivers, such a policy would exclude far more women than
men from the workplace.

Unlike the statutes at issue in City of Boerne, Kimel, and
Garrett, which applied broadly to every aspect of state employers' operations, the FMLA is narrowly targeted at the
faultline between work and family--precisely where sexbased overgeneralization has been and remains strongest--
and affects only one aspect of the employment relationship.
Compare Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535 U. S.
81, 91 (2002) (discussing the "important limitations of the
[FMLA's] remedial scheme"), with City of Boerne, 521 U. S.,
at 532 (the "[s]weeping coverage" of the Religious Freedom
Restoration Act of 1993); Kimel, 528 U. S., at 91 ("the indiscriminate scope of the [ADEA's] substantive requirements"); and Garrett, 531 U. S., at 361 (the ADA prohibits
disability discrimination "in regard to [any] terms, conditions, and privileges of employment" (internal quotation
marks omitted)).

We also find significant the many other limitations that
Congress placed on the scope of this measure. See Florida
Prepaid, 527 U. S., at 647 ("[W]here `a congressional enact538US2 Unit: $U57 [02-10-05 13:08:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

employees who have worked for the employer for at leastone year and provided 1,250 hours of service within the last
12 months, $ 2611(2)(A). Employees in high-ranking or sen-sitive positions are simply ineligible for FMLA leave; of
particular importance to the States, the FMLA expresslyexcludes from coverage state elected officials, their staffs,
and appointed policymakers. $$ 2611(2)(B)(i) and (3), 203(e)(2)(C). Employees must give advance notice of foreseeable
leave, $ 2612(e), and employers may require certification bya health care provider of the need for leave, $ 2613. In
choosing 12 weeks as the appropriate leave floor, Congresschose "a middle ground, a period long enough to serve
`the needs of families' but not so long that it would upset`the legitimate interests of employers.' " Ragsdale, supra,
at 94 (quoting 29 U. S. C. $ 2601(b)).12 Moreover, the cause

12 Congress established 12 weeks as a floor, thus leaving States free to
provide their employees with more family-leave time if they so choose.
See 29 U. S. C. $ 2651(b) ("Nothing in this Act or any amendment made by
this Act shall be construed to supersede any provision of any State or
local law that provides greater family or medical leave rights than the
rights established under this Act or any amendment made by this Act").
The dissent faults Congress for giving States this choice, arguing that the
FMLA's terms do not bar States from granting more family-leave time to
women than to men. Post, at 756. But Justice Kennedy effectively
counters his own argument in his very next breath, recognizing that such
gender-based discrimination would "run afoul of the Equal Protection
Clause or Title VII." Ibid. In crafting new legislation to remedy unconstitutional state conduct, Congress may certainly rely on and take account
of existing laws. Indeed, Congress expressly did so here. See 29 U. S. C.

The plain language of the Eleventh Amendment poses nobarrier to the adjudication of this case because respondents
are citizens of Nevada. The sovereign immunity defense asserted by Nevada is based on what I regard as the secondEleventh Amendment, which has its source in judge-made

common law, rather than constitutional text. Pennsylvaniav.

Union Gas Co., 491 U. S. 1, 23 (1989) (Stevens, J., concurring). As long as it clearly expresses its intent, Congressmay abrogate that common-law defense pursuant to its

power to regulate commerce "among the several States."U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8. The family-care provision of the
Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 is unquestionably avalid exercise of a power that is "broad enough to support
federal legislation regulating the terms and conditions of
state employment." Fitzpatrick, 427 U. S., at 458 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).* Accordingly, Nevada's
sovereign immunity defense is without merit.

Justice Scalia, dissenting.
I join Justice Kennedy's dissent, and add one further
observation: The constitutional violation that is a prerequi-site to "prophylactic" congressional action to "enforce" the

Fourteenth Amendment is a violation by the State against
which the enforcement action is taken. There is no guilt
by association, enabling the sovereignty of one State to beabridged under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment because of

by 49 other States. We explained as much long ago in theCivil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3, 14 (1883), which invalidated

a portion of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, purportedly basedon $ 5, in part for the following reason:

"It applies equally to cases arising in states which havethe justest laws respecting the personal rights of citizens, and whose authorities are ever ready to enforcesuch laws as to those which arise in states that may have
violated the prohibition of the amendment."
Congress has sometimes displayed awareness of this self-evident limitation. That is presumably why the most

sweeping provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965--whichwe upheld in

City of Rome v. United States, 446 U. S. 156(1980), as a valid exercise of congressional power under $ 2

of the Fifteenth Amendment*--were restricted to States"with a demonstrable history of intentional racial discrimination in voting," id., at 177.Today's opinion for the Court does not even attempt to
demonstrate that each one of the 50 States covered by 29U. S. C. $ 2612(a)(1)(C) was in violation of the Fourteenth
Amendment. It treats "the States" as some sort of collec-tive entity which is guilty or innocent as a body. "[T]he
States' record of unconstitutional participation in, and fos-tering of, gender-based discrimination," it concludes, "is
weighty enough to justify the enactment of prophylactic $ 5legislation."

Ante, at 735. This will not do. Prophylaxisin the sense of extending the remedy beyond the violation is

one thing; prophylaxis in the sense of extending the remedybeyond the violator is something else. See City of Rome,
supra, at 177 ("Congress could rationally have concluded

the Fourteenth Amendment. Compare Amdt. 14, $ 5 ("The Congress

that, because electoral changes by jurisdictions with a demonstrable history of intentional racial discrimination in
voting create the risk of purposeful discrimination, it was
proper to prohibit changes that have a discriminatory impact" (emphasis added)).

When a litigant claims that legislation has denied him individual rights secured by the Constitution, the court ordinarily asks first whether the legislation is constitutional as
applied to him. See Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601,
613 (1973). When, on the other hand, a federal statute is
challenged as going beyond Congress's enumerated powers,
under our precedents the court first asks whether the statute
is unconstitutional on its face. Ante, at 727-728; Post, at
744 (Kennedy, J., dissenting); see United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598 (2000); City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S.
507 (1997); United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995). If
the statute survives this challenge, however, it stands to reason that the court may, if asked, proceed to analyze whether
the statute (constitutional on its face) can be validly applied
to the litigant. In the context of $ 5 prophylactic legislation
applied against a State, this would entail examining whether
the State has itself engaged in discrimination sufficient to
support the exercise of Congress's prophylactic power.

It seems, therefore, that for purposes of defeating petitioners' challenge, it would have been enough for respondents to
demonstrate that $ 2612(a)(1)(C) was facially valid--i. e.,
that it could constitutionally be applied to some jurisdictions.
See United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987).
(Even that demonstration, for the reasons set forth by Justice Kennedy, has not been made.) But when it comes to
an as-applied challenge, I think Nevada will be entitled to
assert that the mere facts that (1) it is a State, and (2) some
States are bad actors, is not enough; it can demand that it
be shown to have been acting in violation of the Fourteenth
Amendment.

Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 makes explicitthe congressional intent to invoke $ 5 of the Fourteenth

Amendment to abrogate state sovereign immunity and allowsuits for money damages in federal courts. Ante, at 726-
727, and n. 1. The specific question is whether Congressmay impose on the States this entitlement program of its
own design, with mandated minimums for leave time, andthen enforce it by permitting private suits for money damages against the States. This in turn must be answered byasking whether subjecting States and their treasuries to
monetary liability at the insistence of private litigants is acongruent and proportional response to a demonstrated
pattern of unconstitutional conduct by the States. See ante,at 728;

Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531U. S. 356, 365 (2001); City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507,

520 (1997). If we apply the teaching of these and relatedcases, the family leave provision of the Act, 29 U. S. C.

$ 2612(a)(1)(C), in my respectful view, is invalid to the extentit allows for private suits against the unconsenting States.

Congress does not have authority to define the substantive
content of the Equal Protection Clause; it may only shapethe remedies warranted by the violations of that guarantee.

City of Boerne, supra, at 519-520. This requirement hasspecial force in the context of the Eleventh Amendment,
which protects a State's fiscal integrity from federal intru-sion by vesting the States with immunity from private actions for damages pursuant to federal laws. The CommerceClause likely would permit the National Government to
enact an entitlement program such as this one; but whenCongress couples the entitlement with the authorization to
sue the States for monetary damages, it blurs the line ofaccountability the State has to its own citizens. These basic
concerns underlie cases such as Garrett and Kimel v. Florida
Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62 (2000), and should counsel far

Kennedy, J., dissenting
more caution than the Court shows in holding $ 2612(a)(1)(C)is somehow a congruent and proportional remedy to an identified pattern of discrimination.The Court is unable to show that States have engaged in
a pattern of unlawful conduct which warrants the remedy ofopening state treasuries to private suits. The inability to
adduce evidence of alleged discrimination, coupled with the
inescapable fact that the federal scheme is not a remedy buta benefit program, demonstrates the lack of the requisite link

between any problem Congress has identified and the pro-gram it mandated.

In examining whether Congress was addressing a demonstrated "pattern of unconstitutional employment discrimination by the States," the Court gives superficial treatment to
the requirement that we "identify with some precision the
scope of the constitutional right at issue." Garrett, supra,
at 365, 368. The Court suggests the issue is "the right to
be free from gender-based discrimination in the workplace,"
ante, at 728, and then it embarks on a survey of our precedents speaking to "[t]he history of the many state laws limiting women's employment opportunities," ante, at 729. All
would agree that women historically have been subjected to
conditions in which their employment opportunities are more
limited than those available to men. As the Court acknowledges, however, Congress responded to this problem by abrogating States' sovereign immunity in Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a). Ante, at 729;
see also Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445 (1976). The provision now before us, 29 U. S. C. $ 2612(a)(1)(C), has a different aim than Title VII. It seeks to ensure that eligible employees, irrespective of gender, can take a minimum amount
of leave time to care for an ill relative.

The relevant question, as the Court seems to acknowledge,
is whether, notwithstanding the passage of Title VII and
similar state legislation, the States continued to engage in
widespread discrimination on the basis of gender in the pro538US2 Unit: $U57 [02-10-05 13:08:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

vision of family leave benefits. Ante, at 730. If such a pat-tern were shown, the Eleventh Amendment would not bar

Congress from devising a congruent and proportional rem-edy. The evidence to substantiate this charge must be far
more specific, however, than a simple recitation of a gen-eral history of employment discrimination against women.
When the federal statute seeks to abrogate state sovereign
immunity, the Court should be more careful to insist on ad-herence to the analytic requirements set forth in its own

precedents. Persisting overall effects of gender-based dis-crimination at the workplace must not be ignored; but simply
noting the problem is not a substitute for evidence which
identifies some real discrimination the family leave rules are
designed to prevent.

Respondents fail to make the requisite showing. The
Act's findings of purpose are devoid of any discussion of the
relevant evidence. See Lizzi v. Alexander, 255 F. 3d 128,
135 (CA4 2001) ("In making [its] finding of purpose, Congress
did not identify, as it is required to do, any pattern of gender
discrimination by the states with respect to the granting of
employment leave for the purpose of providing family or
medical care"); see also Chittister v. Department of Community and Econ. Dev., 226 F. 3d 223, 228-229 (CA3 2000) ("Notably absent is any finding concerning the existence, much
less the prevalence, in public employment of personal sick
leave practices that amounted to intentional gender discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause").

As the Court seems to recognize, the evidence considered
by Congress concerned discriminatory practices of the private sector, not those of state employers. Ante, at 730-731,
n. 3. The statistical information compiled by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics (BLS), which are the only factual findings
the Court cites, surveyed only private employers. Ante,
at 730. While the evidence of discrimination by private
entities may be relevant, it does not, by itself, justify the
abrogation of States' sovereign immunity. Garrett, 531

U. S., at 368 ("Congress' $ 5 authority is appropriately exer-cised only in response to state transgressions").

The Court seeks to connect the evidence of private dis-crimination to an alleged pattern of unconstitutional behavior by States through inferences drawn from two sources.The first is testimony by Meryl Frank, Director of the Infant
Care Leave Project, Yale Bush Center in Child Development
and Social Policy, who surveyed both private and public em-ployers in all 50 States and found little variation between

the leave policies in the two sectors. Ante, at 730-731, n. 3(citing The Parental and Medical Leave Act of 1986: Joint
Hearing before the Subcommittee on Labor-Management
Relations and the Subcommittee on Labor Standards of the
House Committee on Education and Labor, 99th Cong., 2d
Sess., 33 (1986) (hereinafter Joint Hearing)). The second is
a view expressed by the Washington Council of Lawyers
that even " `[w]here child-care leave policies do exist, men,
both in the public and private sectors, receive notoriously
discriminatory treatment in their requests for such leave.' "
Ante, at 731 (quoting Joint Hearing 147) (emphasis added by
the Court).

Both statements were made during the hearings on the
proposed 1986 national leave legislation, and so preceded the
Act by seven years. The 1986 bill, which was not enacted,
differed in an important respect from the legislation Congress eventually passed. That proposal sought to provide
parenting leave, not leave to care for another ill family member. Compare H. R. 4300, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., $$ 102(3),
103(a) (1986), with 29 U. S. C. $ 2612(a)(1)(C). See also L.

with respect to the parenting leave. See Joint Hearing 31(statement of Meryl Frank) (the Yale Bush study "evaluate[d] the impact of the changing composition of the work-place on families with infants");

id., at 147 (statement of the
Washington Council of Lawyers) ("[F]or the first time, childcare responsibilities of both natural and adoptive mothers
and fathers will be legislatively protected"). Even if this
isolated testimony could support an inference that privatesector's gender-based discrimination in the provision of parenting leave was parallel to the behavior by state actors in1986, the evidence would not be probative of the States' conduct some seven years later with respect to a statutory provision conferring a different benefit. The Court of Appeals
admitted as much: "We recognize that a weakness in this
evidence as applied to Hibbs' case is that the BLS and Yale
Bush Center studies deal only with parental leave, not with
leave to care for a sick family member. They thus do not
document a widespread pattern of precisely the kind of discrimination that $ 2612(a)(1)(C) is intended to prevent." 273
F. 3d 844, 859 (CA9 2001).

The Court's reliance on evidence suggesting States provided men and women with the parenting leave of different
length, ante, at 731, and n. 5, suffers from the same flaw.
This evidence concerns the Act's grant of parenting leave,

$$ 2612(a)(1)(A), (B), and is too attenuated to justify the family leave provision. The Court of Appeals' conclusion to the
contrary was based on an assertion that "if states discriminate along gender lines regarding the one kind of leave, then
they are likely to do so regarding the other." 273 F. 3d, at
859. The charge that a State has engaged in a pattern of
unconstitutional discrimination against its citizens is a most
serious one. It must be supported by more than conjecture.

The Court maintains the evidence pertaining to the parenting leave is relevant because both parenting and family
leave provisions respond to "the same gender stereotype:
that women's family duties trump those of the workplace."

Kennedy, J., dissenting
Ante, at 732, n. 5. This sets the contours of the inquiry attoo high a level of abstraction. The question is not whether

the family leave provision is a congruent and proportionalresponse to general gender-based stereotypes in employment which "ha[ve] historically produced discrimination inthe hiring and promotion of women,"

ibid.; the question is
whether it is a proper remedy to an alleged pattern of unconstitutional discrimination by States in the grant of familyleave. The evidence of gender-based stereotypes is too remote to support the required showing.The Court next argues that "even where state laws and
policies were not facially discriminatory, they were applied
in discriminatory ways." Ante, at 732. This charge is
based on an allegation that many States did not guarantee
the right to family leave by statute, instead leaving the decision up to individual employers, who could subject employees
to " `discretionary and possibly unequal treatment.' " Ibid.
(quoting H. R. Rep. No. 103-8, pt. 2, pp. 10-11 (1993)). The
study from which the Court derives this conclusion examined
"the parental leave policies of Federal executive branch
agencies," H. R. Rep. No. 103-8, at 10, not those of the
States. The study explicitly stated that its conclusions concerned federal employees: " `[I]n the absence of a national
minimum standard for granting leave for parental purposes,
the authority to grant leave and to arrange the length of
that leave rests with individual supervisors, leaving Federal
employees open to discretionary and possibly unequal treatment.' " Id., at 10-11. A history of discrimination on the
part of the Federal Government may, in some situations,
support an inference of similar conduct by the States, but the
Court does not explain why the inference is justified here.

Even if there were evidence that individual state employers, in the absence of clear statutory guidelines, discriminated in the administration of leave benefits, this circumstance alone would not support a finding of a state-sponsored
pattern of discrimination. The evidence could perhaps sup538US2 Unit: $U57 [02-10-05 13:08:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S.
229, 239 (1976)).The federal-state equivalence upon which the Court places

such emphasis is a deficient rationale at an even more fundamental level, however; for the States appear to have beenahead of Congress in providing gender-neutral family leave

benefits. Thirty States, the District of Columbia, andPuerto Rico had adopted some form of family-care leave in
the years preceding the Act's adoption. The reports in both
Houses of Congress noted this fact. H. R. Rep. No. 103-8,
at 32-33; S. Rep. No. 103-3, pp. 20-21 (1993); see also Brief
for State of Alabama et al. as Amici Curiae 18-22. Congressional hearings noted that the provision of family leave
was "an issue which has picked up tremendous momentum
in the States, with some 21 of them having some form of
family or medical leave on the books." The Family and
Medical Leave Act of 1991: Hearing on H. R. 2 before the
Subcommittee on Labor-Management Relations of the House
Committee on Education and Labor, 102d Cong., 1st Sess.,
p. 4 (1991) (statement of Rep. Marge Roukema). Congress
relied on the experience of the States in designing the national leave policy to be cost effective and gender neutral.

Act of 1987: Hearings on S. 249 before the Subcommittee on
Children, Family, Drugs and Alcoholism of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, 100th Cong., 1st
Sess., pt. 2, pp. 194-195, 533-534 (1987). Congress also acknowledged that many States had implemented leave policies more generous than those envisioned by the Act. H. R.
Rep. No. 103-8, pt. 1, at 50; S. Rep. No. 103-3, at 38. At the
very least, the history of the Act suggests States were in the
process of solving any existing gender-based discrimination
in the provision of family leave.

Kennedy, J., dissenting
The Court acknowledges that States have adopted familyleave programs prior to federal intervention, but argues

these policies suffered from serious imperfections. Ante,at 733-734. Even if correct, this observation proves, at
most, that programs more generous and more effective thanthose operated by the States were feasible. That the States
did not devise the optimal programs is not, however, evidence that the States were perpetuating unconstitutionaldiscrimination. Given that the States assumed a pioneering

role in the creation of family leave schemes, it is not surpris-ing these early efforts may have been imperfect. This is altogether different, however, from purposeful discrimination.

The Court's lengthy discussion of the allegedly deficient
state policies falls short of meeting this standard. A great
majority of these programs exhibit no constitutional defect
and, in fact, are authorized by this Court's precedent. The
Court points out that seven States adopted leave provisions
applicable only to women. Ante, at 733. Yet it must acknowledge that three of these schemes concerned solely
pregnancy disability leave. Ante, at 733, n. 6 (citing 3 Colo.
Code Regs. $ 708-1, Rule 80.8 (2002); Iowa Code $ 216.6(2)
(2000); N. H. Stat. Ann. $ 354-A:7(VI)(b) (Michie Supp.
2000)). Our cases make clear that a State does not violate
the Equal Protection Clause by granting pregnancy disability leave to women without providing for a grant of parenting leave to men. Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U. S. 484, 496-
497, n. 20 (1974); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 49 (counsel for

the United States conceding that Geduldig would permit
this practice). The Court treats the pregnancy disability scheme of the fourth State, Louisiana, as a disguised
gender-discriminatory provision of parenting leave because
the scheme would permit leave in excess of the period Congress believed to be medically necessary for pregnancy
disability. Ante, at 733, n. 6. The Louisiana statute, however, granted leave only for "that period during which the
female employee is disabled on account of pregnancy, child538US2 Unit: $U57 [02-10-05 13:08:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

birth, or related medical conditions. " La. Stat. Ann.$ 23:1008(A)(2)(b) (West Supp. 1993) (repealed 1997). Properly administered, the scheme, despite its generous maxi-mum, would not transform into a discriminatory "4-month
maternity leave for female employees only." Ante, at 733,n. 6.

The Court next observes that 12 States "provided their
employees no family leave, beyond an initial childbirth oradoption."

Ante, at 733. Four of these States are those
which, as discussed above, offered pregnancy disability leaveonly. See

ante, at 733, n. 7 (citing 3 Colo. Code Regs.

N. H. Stat. Ann. $ 354-A:7(VI)(b) (Michie Supp. 2000)). Of
the remaining eight States, five offered parenting leave to
both men and women on an equal basis; a practice which no
one contends suffers from a constitutional infirmity. See

U. S. Dept. of Labor, Women's Bureau, State Maternity/

Family Leave Law, p. 12 (June 1993) (discussing the policy

(as with the pregnancy disability leave) offends the Constitution. Instead, the Court seems to suggest that a pattern of
unconstitutional conduct may be inferred solely because a
State, in providing its citizens with social benefits, does not
make these benefits as generous or extensive as Congress
would later deem appropriate.

The Court further chastises the States for having "provided no statutorily guaranteed right to family leave, offering instead only voluntary or discretionary leave programs."

vided leave only through administrative regulations or per-sonnel policies"). The Court does not argue the States intended to enable employers to discriminate in the provisionof family leave; nor, as already noted, is there evidence state
employers discriminated in the administration of leave bene-fits. See

supra, at 749-750. Under the Court's reasoning,
Congress seems justified in abrogating state immunity from
private suits whenever the State's social benefits program isnot enshrined in the statutory code and provides employers

with discretion.Stripped of the conduct which exhibits no constitutional
infirmity, the Court's "exten[sive] and specifi[c] . . . record of
unconstitutional state conduct," ante, at 735, n. 11, boils
down to the fact that three States, Massachusetts, Kansas,
and Tennessee, provided parenting leave only to their female
employees, and had no program for granting their employees
(male or female) family leave. See ante, at 733-734, nn. 6
and 7 (citing Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 149, $ 105D (West 1997);
Kan. Admin. Regs. 21-32-6(d) (2003); Tenn. Code Ann. $ 4-
21-408(a) (1998)). As already explained, supra, at 748-749,
the evidence related to the parenting leave is simply too attenuated to support a charge of unconstitutional discrimination in the provision of family leave. Nor, as the Court
seems to acknowledge, does the Constitution require States
to provide their employees with any family leave at all.
Ante, at 738. A State's failure to devise a family leave program is not, then, evidence of unconstitutional behavior.

Considered in its entirety, the evidence fails to document
a pattern of unconstitutional conduct sufficient to justify the
abrogation of States' sovereign immunity. The few incidents identified by the Court "fall far short of even suggesting the pattern of unconstitutional discrimination on which

Amici Curiae 5-14.
Our concern with gender discrimination, which is sub-jected to heightened scrutiny, as opposed to age- or

disability-based distinctions, which are reviewed under ra-tional standard, see

Kimel, supra, at 83-84; Garrett, supra,
at 366-367, does not alter this conclusion. The application
of heightened scrutiny is designed to ensure gender-basedclassifications are not based on the entrenched and pervasive

stereotypes which inhibit women's progress in the work-place.

Ante, at 736. This consideration does not divest respondents of their burden to show that "Congress identified
a history and pattern of unconstitutional employment discrimination by the States." Garrett, supra, at 368. The
Court seems to reaffirm this requirement. Ante, at 729
("We now inquire whether Congress had evidence of a pattern of constitutional violations on the part of the States
. . ."); see also ante, at 735 ("[T]he States' record of unconstitutional participation in, and fostering of, gender-based discrimination in the administration of leave benefits is weighty
enough to justify the enactment of prophylactic $ 5 legislation"). In my submission, however, the Court does not follow it. Given the insufficiency of the evidence that States
discriminated in the provision of family leave, the unfortunate fact that stereotypes about women continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem would not alone support
the charge that a State has engaged in a practice designed
to deny its citizens the equal protection of the laws. Garrett, supra, at 369.

The paucity of evidence to support the case the Court tries
to make demonstrates that Congress was not responding
with a congruent and proportional remedy to a perceived
course of unconstitutional conduct. Instead, it enacted a
substantive entitlement program of its own. If Congress
had been concerned about different treatment of men and
women with respect to family leave, a congruent remedy

Kennedy, J., dissenting
would have sought to ensure the benefits of any leave pro-gram enacted by a State are available to men and women on

an equal basis. Instead, the Act imposes, across the board,a requirement that States grant a minimum of 12 weeks of
leave per year. 29 U. S. C. $ 2612(a)(1)(C). This require-ment may represent Congress' considered judgment as to
the optimal balance between the family obligations of workers and the interests of employers, and the States may de-cide to follow these guidelines in designing their own family

leave benefits. It does not follow, however, that if theStates choose to enact a different benefit scheme, they
should be deemed to engage in unconstitutional conduct and
forced to open their treasuries to private suits for damages.

Well before the federal enactment, Nevada not only provided its employees, on a gender-neutral basis, with an option of requesting up to one year of unpaid leave, Nev.
Admin. Code $ 284.578(1) (1984), but also permitted, subject
to approval and other conditions, leaves of absence in excess
of one year, $ 284.578(2). Nevada state employees were also
entitled to use up to 10 days of their accumulated paid sick
leave to care for an ill relative. $ 284.558(1). Nevada, in
addition, had a program of special "catastrophic leave."
State employees could donate their accrued sick leave to a
general fund to aid employees who needed additional leave
to care for a relative with a serious illness. Nev. Rev. Stat.

$ 284.362(1) (1995).

To be sure, the Nevada scheme did not track that devised
by the Act in all respects. The provision of unpaid leave
was discretionary and subject to a possible reporting requirement. Nev. Admin. Code $ 284.578(2)(3) (1984). A
congruent remedy to any discriminatory exercise of discretion, however, is the requirement that the grant of leave be
administered on a gender-equal basis, not the displacement
of the State's scheme by a federal one. The scheme enacted
by the Act does not respect the States' autonomous power
to design their own social benefits regime.

Were more proof needed to show that this is an entitle-ment program, not a remedial statute, it should suffice to

note that the Act does not even purport to bar discriminationin some leave programs the States do enact and administer.
Under the Act, a State is allowed to provide women with,say, 24 weeks of family leave per year but provide only 12
weeks of leave to men. As the counsel for the United States
conceded during the argument, a law of this kind might runafoul of the Equal Protection Clause or Title VII, but it

would not constitute a violation of the Act. Tr. of Oral Arg.49. The Act on its face is not drawn as a remedy to genderbased discrimination in family leave.

It has been long acknowledged that federal legislation
which "deters or remedies constitutional violations can fall
within the sweep of Congress' enforcement power even if in
the process it prohibits conduct which is not itself unconstitutional." City of Boerne, 521 U. S., at 518; see also ante, at
737 (in exercising its power under $ 5 of the Fourteenth
Amendment, Congress "may prohibit `a somewhat broader
swath of conduct, including that which is not itself forbidden
by the Amendment's text' " (quoting Kimel, 528 U. S., at 81)).
The Court has explained, however, that Congress may not
"enforce a constitutional right by changing what the right
is." City of Boerne, supra, at 519. The dual requirement
that Congress identify a pervasive pattern of unconstitutional state conduct and that its remedy be proportional and
congruent to the violation is designed to separate permissible exercises of congressional power from instances where
Congress seeks to enact a substantive entitlement under the
guise of its $ 5 authority.

The Court's precedents upholding the Voting Rights Act
of 1965 as a proper exercise of Congress' remedial power are
instructive. In South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301
(1966), the Court concluded that the Voting Rights Act's
prohibition on state literacy tests was an appropriate method
of enforcing the constitutional protection against racial dis538US2 Unit: $U57 [02-10-05 13:08:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

crimination in voting. This measure was justified because"Congress documented a marked pattern of unconstitutional

action by the States." Garrett, 531 U. S., at 373 (citing
Katzenbach, supra, at 312, 313); see also City of Boerne,
supra, at 525 ("We noted evidence in the record reflectingthe subsisting and pervasive discriminatory--and therefore

unconstitutional--use of literacy tests" (citing Katzenbach,
supra, at 333-334)). Congress' response was a "limited re-medial scheme designed to guarantee meaningful enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment." Garrett, supra, at 373.This scheme was both congruent, because it "aimed at areas
where voting discrimination has been most flagrant," Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 315, and proportional, because it was
necessary to "banish the blight of racial discrimination in
voting, which has infected the electoral process in parts of
our country for nearly a century," id., at 308. The Court
acknowledged Congress' power to devise "strong remedial
and preventive measures" to safeguard voting rights on subsequent occasions, but always explained that these measures
were legitimate because they were responding to a pattern
of "the widespread and persisting deprivation of constitutional rights resulting from this country's history of racial
discrimination." City of Boerne, supra, at 526-527 (citing
Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U. S. 112 (1970); City of Rome v.
United States, 446 U. S. 156 (1980); Katzenbach v. Morgan,
384 U. S. 641 (1966)).

This principle of our $ 5 jurisprudence is well illustrated
not only by the Court's opinions in these cases but also by
the late Justice Harlan's dissent in Katzenbach v. Morgan.
There, Justice Harlan contrasted his vote to invalidate a
federal ban on New York state literacy tests from his earlier decision, in South Carolina v. Katzenbach, to uphold
stronger remedial measures against the State of South Carolina, such as suspension of literacy tests, imposition of preclearance requirements for any changes in state voting laws,
and appointment of federal voting examiners. Katzenbach

v. Morgan, supra, at 659, 667; see also South Carolina v.
Katzenbach, supra, at 315-323. Justice Harlan explained
that in the case of South Carolina there was " `voluminouslegislative history' as well as judicial precedents supporting

the basic congressional findings that the clear commands ofthe Fifteenth Amendment had been infringed by various
state subterfuges. . . . Given the existence of the evil, we
held the remedial steps taken by the legislature under theEnforcement Clause of the Fifteenth Amendment to be a

justifiable exercise of congressional initiative." 384 U. S., at667 (quoting

South Carolina v. Katzenbach, supra, at 309,
329-330). By contrast, the New York case, in his view,
lacked a showing that "there has in fact been an infringement of that constitutional command, that is, whether a particular state practice . . . offend[ed] the command of the
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."
384 U. S., at 667. In the absence of evidence that a State
has engaged in unconstitutional conduct, Justice Harlan
would have concluded that the literacy test ban Congress
sought to impose was not an "appropriate remedial measur[e]
to redress and prevent the wrongs," but an impermissible
attempt "to define the substantive scope of the Amendment." Id., at 666, 668.

For the same reasons, the abrogation of state sovereign
immunity pursuant to Title VII was a legitimate congressional response to a pattern of gender-based discrimination
in employment. Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445 (1976).
The family leave benefit conferred by the Act is, by contrast,
a substantive benefit Congress chose to confer upon state
employees. See City of Boerne, supra, at 520 ("There must
be a congruence and proportionality between the injury to
be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that
end. Lacking such a connection, legislation may become
substantive in operation and effect"). The plain truth is
Congress did not "ac[t] to accomplish the legitimate end
of enforcing judicially-recognized Fourteenth Amendment

on the states." Beck, The Heart of Federalism: Pretext Re-view of Means-End Relationships, 36 U. C. D. L. Rev. 407,
440 (2003).It bears emphasis that, even were the Court to bar unconsented federal suits by private individuals for money dam-ages from a State, individuals whose rights under the Act
were violated would not be without recourse. The Act islikely a valid exercise of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause, Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3, and so the standards it pre-scribes will be binding upon the States. The United States
may enforce these standards in actions for money damages;and private individuals may bring actions against state officials for injunctive relief under Ex parte Young, 209 U. S.123 (1908). What is at issue is only whether the States can
be subjected, without consent, to suits brought by privatepersons seeking to collect moneys from the state treasury.
Their immunity cannot be abrogated without documentationof a pattern of unconstitutional acts by the States, and only
then by a congruent and proportional remedy. There hasbeen a complete failure by respondents to carry their burden
to establish each of these necessary propositions. I wouldhold that the Act is not a valid abrogation of state sovereign
immunity and dissent with respect from the Court's conclu-sion to the contrary.

CHAVEZ v. MARTINEZ
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 01-1444. Argued December 4, 2002--Decided May 27, 2003
While respondent Martinez was being treated for gunshot wounds received during an altercation with police, he was interrogated by petitioner Chavez, a patrol supervisor. Martinez admitted that he used
heroin and had taken an officer's gun during the incident. At no point
was Martinez given Miranda warnings. Although he was never
charged with a crime, and his answers were never used against him in
any criminal proceeding, Martinez filed a 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 suit, maintaining, among other things, that Chavez's actions violated his Fifth
Amendment right not to be "compelled in any criminal case to be a
witness against himself," and his Fourteenth Amendment substantive
due process right to be free from coercive questioning. The District
Court ruled that Chavez was not entitled to qualified immunity, and
the Ninth Circuit affirmed, finding that Chavez's coercive questioning
violated Martinez's Fifth Amendment rights even though his statements
were not used against him in a criminal proceeding, and that a police
officer violates due process when he obtains a confession by coercive
conduct, regardless of whether the confession is subsequently used at
trial.

Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
270 F. 3d 852, reversed and remanded.

Justice Thomas, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice O'Connor,
and Justice Scalia, concluded in Part II-A that Chavez did not deprive Martinez of his Fifth Amendment rights. Pp. 766-773.

(a) An officer is entitled to qualified immunity if his alleged conduct
did not violate a constitutional right. See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S.
194, 201. The text of the Fifth Amendment's Self-Incrimination Clause
cannot support the Ninth Circuit's view that mere compulsive questioning violates the Constitution. A "criminal case" at the very least
requires the initiation of legal proceedings, and police questioning does
not constitute such a case. Statements compelled by police interrogation may not be used against a defendant in a criminal case, but it is not
until such use that the Self-Incrimination Clause is violated, see United
States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U. S. 259, 264. Martinez was never
made to be a "witness" against himself because his statements were
never admitted as testimony against him in a criminal case. Nor was

Syllabus
he ever placed under oath and exposed to " `the cruel trilemma of selfaccusation, perjury or contempt.' " Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U. S. 433,
445. Pp. 766-767.

(b) The Ninth Circuit's approach is also irreconcilable with this
Court's case law. The government may compel witnesses to testify at
trial or before a grand jury, on pain of contempt, so long as the witness
is not the target of the criminal case in which he testifies, see, e. g.,
Kastigar v. United States, 406 U. S. 441, 443; and this Court has long
permitted the compulsion of incriminating testimony so long as the
statements (or evidence derived from them) cannot be used against the
speaker in a criminal case, id., at 458. Martinez was no more compelled
in a criminal case to be a witness against himself than an immunized
witness forced to testify on pain of contempt. That an immunized witness knows that his statements may not be used against him, while
Martinez likely did not, does not make the immunized witness' statements any less compelled and lends no support to the Ninth Circuit's
conclusion that coercive police interrogations alone violate the Fifth
Amendment. Moreover, those subjected to coercive interrogations
have an automatic protection from the use of their involuntary statements in any subsequent criminal trial, e. g., Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S.
298, 307-308, which is coextensive with the use and derivative use immunity mandated by Kastigar. Pp. 767-770.

(c) The fact that the Court has permitted the Fifth Amendment privilege to be asserted in noncriminal cases does not alter the conclusion in
this case. Judicially created prophylactic rules--such as the rule allowing a witness to insist on an immunity agreement before being compelled to give testimony in noncriminal cases, and the exclusionary
rule--are designed to safeguard the core constitutional right protected
by the Self-Incrimination Clause. They do not extend the scope of that
right itself, just as violations of such rules do not violate a person's
constitutional rights. Accordingly, Chavez's failure to read Miranda
warnings to Martinez did not violate Martinez's constitutional rights
and cannot be grounds for a $ 1983 action. And the absence of a "criminal case" in which Martinez was compelled to be a "witness" against
himself defeats his core Fifth Amendment claim. Pp. 770-773.

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Part II, concluding that the issue whether Martinez may pursue a claim
of liability for a substantive due process violation should be addressed
on remand. Pp. 779-780.

Justice Souter, joined by Justice Breyer, concluded in Part I
that Martinez's claim that his questioning alone was a violation of the
Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments subject to redress by a 42 U. S. C.

$ 1983 damages action, though outside the core of Fifth Amendment

Syllabus
protection, could be recognized if a core guarantee, or the judicial capacity to protect it, would be placed at risk absent complementary protection, see, e. g., McCarthy v. Arndstein, 266 U. S. 34, 40. However, Martinez cannot make the "powerful showing" necessary to expand
protection of the privilege against self-incrimination to the point of the
civil liability he requests. Inherent in his purely Fifth Amendment
claim is the risk of global application in every instance of interrogation
producing a statement inadmissible under the Fifth and Fourteenth
Amendments, or violating one of the complementary rules this Court
has accepted in aid of the core privilege. And Martinez has offered no
reason to believe that this new rule is necessary in aid of the basic
guarantee. Pp. 777-779.

Justice Thomas announced the judgment of the Court
and delivered an opinion.*

This case involves a 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 suit arising out of
petitioner Ben Chavez's allegedly coercive interrogation of
respondent Oliverio Martinez. The United States Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that Chavez was not entitled to a defense of qualified immunity because he violated
Martinez's clearly established constitutional rights. We
conclude that Chavez did not deprive Martinez of a constitutional right.

On November 28, 1997, police officers Maria Pen~ a and Andrew Salinas were near a vacant lot in a residential area of
Oxnard, California, investigating suspected narcotics activity. While Pen~ a and Salinas were questioning an individual,
they heard a bicycle approaching on a darkened path that
crossed the lot. They ordered the rider, respondent Martinez, to dismount, spread his legs, and place his hands behind
his head. Martinez complied. Salinas then conducted a

There is some dispute about what occurred during the al-tercation. The officers claim that Martinez drew Salinas'

gun from its holster and pointed it at them; Martinez deniesthis. Both sides agree, however, that Salinas yelled, " `He's
got my gun!' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a. Pen~ a then drewher gun and shot Martinez several times, causing severe injuries that left Martinez permanently blinded and paralyzedfrom the waist down. The officers then placed Martinez
under arrest.Petitioner Chavez, a patrol supervisor, arrived on the
scene minutes later with paramedics. Chavez accompaniedMartinez to the hospital and then questioned Martinez there
while he was receiving treatment from medical personnel.The interview lasted a total of about 10 minutes, over a 45-
minute period, with Chavez leaving the emergency room forperiods of time to permit medical personnel to attend to
Martinez.At first, most of Martinez's answers consisted of "I don't

U. S. C. $ 1983, maintaining that Chavez's actions violated his
Fifth Amendment right not to be "compelled in any criminal
case to be a witness against himself," as well as his Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process right to be free
from coercive questioning. The District Court granted
summary judgment to Martinez as to Chavez's qualified immunity defense on both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment claims. Chavez took an interlocutory appeal to the
Ninth Circuit, which affirmed the District Court's denial of
qualified immunity. Martinez v. Oxnard, 270 F. 3d 852
(2001). Applying Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194 (2001), the
Ninth Circuit first concluded that Chavez's actions, as alleged by Martinez, deprived Martinez of his rights under the
Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Ninth Circuit did
not attempt to explain how Martinez had been "compelled in
any criminal case to be a witness against himself." Instead,
the Ninth Circuit reiterated the holding of an earlier Ninth
Circuit case, Cooper v. Dupnik, 963 F. 2d 1220, 1229 (1992)
(en banc), that "the Fifth Amendment's purpose is to prevent
coercive interrogation practices that are destructive of
human dignity," 270 F. 3d, at 857 (internal quotation marks
omitted), and found that Chavez's "coercive questioning" of
Martinez violated his Fifth Amendment rights, "[e]ven
though Martinez's statements were not used against him in
a criminal proceeding," ibid. As to Martinez's due process
claim, the Ninth Circuit held that "a police officer violates
the Fourteenth Amendment when he obtains a confession
by coercive conduct, regardless of whether the confession is
subsequently used at trial." Ibid.

The Ninth Circuit then concluded that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights asserted by Martinez were clearly
established by federal law, explaining that a reasonable officer "would have known that persistent interrogation of the
suspect despite repeated requests to stop violated the sus538US2 Unit: $U58 [10-27-04 16:56:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

pect's Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment right to be freefrom coercive interrogation." Id., at 858.

We granted certiorari. 535 U. S. 1111 (2002).

II
In deciding whether an officer is entitled to qualified im-munity, we must first determine whether the officer's alleged

conduct violated a constitutional right. See Katz, 533 U. S.,at 201. If not, the officer is entitled to qualified immunity,
and we need not consider whether the asserted right was"clearly established." Ibid. We conclude that Martinez's
allegations fail to state a violation of his constitutionalrights.

The Fifth Amendment, made applicable to the States bythe Fourteenth Amendment, Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1

(1964), requires that "[n]o person . . . shall be compelled inany criminal case to be a witness against himself." U. S.
Const., Amdt. 5 (emphases added). We fail to see how,based on the text of the Fifth Amendment, Martinez can
allege a violation of this right, since Martinez was neverprosecuted for a crime, let alone compelled to be a witness
against himself in a criminal case.Although Martinez contends that the meaning of "criminal
case" should encompass the entire criminal investigatoryprocess, including police interrogations, Brief for Respondent 23, we disagree. In our view, a "criminal case" at thevery least requires the initiation of legal proceedings. See
Blyew v. United States, 13 Wall. 581, 595 (1872) ("The words`case' and `cause' are constantly used as synonyms in statutes
and judicial decisions, each meaning a proceeding in court, a
suit, or action" (emphasis added)); Black's Law Dictionary215 (6th ed. 1990) (defining "[c]ase" as "[a] general term for

Opinion of Thomas, J.
need not decide today the precise moment when a "criminalcase" commences; it is enough to say that police questioning

does not constitute a "case" any more than a private inves-tigator's precomplaint activities constitute a "civil case."
Statements compelled by police interrogations of coursemay not be used against a defendant at trial, see Brown v.
Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278, 286 (1936), but it is not untiltheir use in a criminal case that a violation of the SelfIncrimination Clause occurs, see United States v. VerdugoUrquidez, 494 U. S. 259, 264 (1990) ("The privilege againstself-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment is

Here, Martinez was never made to be a "witness" againsthimself in vi olation of the Fif th Amendment's SelfIncrimination Clause because his statements were never ad-mitted as testimony against him in a criminal case. Nor was
he ever placed under oath and exposed to " `the cruel tri-lemma of self-accusation, perjury or contempt.' " Michigan

The text of the Self-Incrimination Clause simply cannot sup-port the Ninth Circuit's view that the mere use of compulsive
questioning, without more, violates the Constitution.

Nor can the Ninth Circuit's approach be reconciled withour case law. It is well established that the government

may compel witnesses to testify at trial or before a grand

jury, on pain of contempt, so long as the witness is not thetarget of the criminal case in which he testifies. See Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U. S. 420, 427 (1984); Kastigar v. UnitedStates, 406 U. S. 441, 443 (1972). Even for persons who have
a legitimate fear that their statements may subject them tocriminal prosecution, we have long permitted the compulsion
of incriminating testimony so long as those statements (orevidence derived from those statements) cannot be used
against the speaker in any criminal case. See Brown v.
Walker, 161 U. S. 591, 602-604 (1896); Kastigar, supra, at458; United States v. Balsys, 524 U. S. 666, 671-672 (1998).

We have also recognized that governments may penalizepublic employees and government contractors (with the loss
of their jobs or government contracts) to induce them to re-spond to inquiries, so long as the answers elicited (and their
fruits) are immunized from use in any criminal case againstthe speaker. See Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U. S. 70, 84-85
(1973) ("[T]he State may insist that [contractors] . . . eitherrespond to relevant inquiries about the performance of their
contracts or suffer cancellation"); Lefkowitz v. Cunningham,431 U. S. 801, 806 (1977) ("Public employees may constitutionally be discharged for refusing to answer potentially in-criminating questions concerning their official duties if they
have not been required to surrender their constitutional im-munity" against later use of statements in criminal proceedings).2 By contrast, no "penalty" may ever be imposed on

2 The government may not, however, penalize public employees and government contractors to induce them to waive their immunity from the use
of their compelled statements in subsequent criminal proceedings. See
Uniformed Sanitation Men Assn., Inc. v. Commissioner of Sanitation of
City of New York, 392 U. S. 280 (1968); Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U. S. 70
(1973), and this is true even though immunity is not itself a right secured
by the text of the Self-Incrimination Clause, but rather a prophylactic rule
we have constructed to protect the Fifth Amendment's right from invasion. See Part II-A-3, infra. Once an immunity waiver is signed, the
signatory is unable to assert a Fifth Amendment objection to the subsequent use of his statements in a criminal case, even if his statements were

someone who exercises his core Fifth Amendment right notto be a "witness" against himself in a "criminal case." See

Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609, 614 (1965) (the trialcourt's and the prosecutor's comments on the defendant's
failure to testify violates the Self-Incrimination Clause of theFifth Amendment). Our holdings in these cases demonstrate that, contrary to the Ninth Circuit's view, mere co-ercion does not violate the text of the Self-Incrimination
Clause absent use of the compelled statements in a criminalcase against the witness.

We fail to see how Martinez was any more "compelled inany criminal case to be a witness against himself " than an
immunized witness forced to testify on pain of contempt.One difference, perhaps, is that the immunized witness
knows that his statements will not, and may not, be usedagainst him, whereas Martinez likely did not. But this does
not make the statements of the immunized witness any less"compelled" and lends no support to the Ninth Circuit's conclusion that coercive police interrogations, absent the use ofthe involuntary statements in a criminal case, violate the
Fifth Amendment's Self-Incrimination Clause. Moreover,our cases provide that those subjected to coercive police interrogations have an automatic protection from the use oftheir involuntary statements (or evidence derived from their
statements) in any subsequent criminal trial. Oregon v. El-stad, 470 U. S. 298, 307-308 (1985); United States v. Blue, 384
U. S. 251, 255 (1966); Leyra v. Denno, 347 U. S. 556, 558(1954); Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U. S. 143, 155 (1944). See
also Pillsbury Co. v. Conboy, 459 U. S. 248, 278 (1983) (Black-mun, J., concurring in judgment); Williams v. United States,
401 U. S. 646, 662 (1971) (Brennan, J., concurring in result).This protection is, in fact, coextensive with the use and dein fact compelled. A waiver of immunity is therefore a prospective
waiver of the core self-incrimination right in any subsequent criminal proceeding, and States cannot condition public employment on the waiver of
constitutional rights, Lefkowitz, supra, at 85.

rivative use immunity mandated by Kastigar when the gov-ernment compels testimony from a reluctant witness. See

406 U. S., at 453. Accordingly, the fact that Martinez didnot know his statements could not be used against him does
not change our view that no violation of the Fifth Amend-ment's Self-Incrimination Clause occurred here.

3
Although our cases have permitted the Fifth Amendment'sself-incrimination privilege to be asserted in noncriminal

cases, see id., at 444-445 (recognizing that the "FifthAmendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination
. . . can be asserted in any proceeding, civil or criminal, ad-ministrative or judicial, investigatory or adjudicatory . . .");
Lefkowitz v. Turley, supra, at 77 (stating that the FifthAmendment privilege allows one "not to answer official questions put to him in any other proceeding, civil or criminal,formal or informal, where the answers might incriminate
him in future criminal proceedings"), that does not alter ourconclusion that a violation of the constitutional

right againstself-incrimination occurs only if one has been compelled to

be a witness against himself in a criminal case.In the Fifth Amendment context, we have created prophylactic rules designed to safeguard the core constitutionalright protected by the Self-Incrimination Clause. See,

e. g.,Tucker, 417 U. S., at 444 (describing the "procedural safeguards" required by Miranda as "not themselves rights pro-tected by the Constitution but . . . measures to insure that
the right against compulsory self-incrimination was pro-tected" to "provide practical reinforcement for the right");
Elstad, supra, at 306 (stating that "[t]he Miranda exclusion-ary rule . . . serves the Fifth Amendment and sweeps more
broadly than the Fifth Amendment itself "). Among theserules is an evidentiary privilege that protects witnesses from
being forced to give incriminating testimony, even in non-criminal cases, unless that testimony has been immunized

from use and derivative use in a future criminal proceeding
before it is compelled. See Kastigar, supra, at 453; Maness
v. Meyers, 419 U. S. 449, 461-462 (1975) (noting that the Fifth
Amendment privilege may be asserted if one is "compelled
to produce evidence which later may be used against him as
an accused in a criminal action" (emphasis added)).

By allowing a witness to insist on an immunity agreement
before being compelled to give incriminating testimony in
a noncriminal case, the privilege preserves the core Fifth
Amendment right from invasion by the use of that compelled
testimony in a subsequent criminal case. See Tucker,
supra, at 440-441 ("Testimony obtained in civil suits, or before administrative or legislative committees, could [absent
a grant of immunity] prove so incriminating that a person
compelled to give such testimony might readily be convicted
on the basis of those disclosures in a subsequent criminal
proceeding"). Because the failure to assert the privilege
will often forfeit the right to exclude the evidence in a subsequent "criminal case," see Murphy, 465 U. S., at 440; Garner
v. United States, 424 U. S. 648, 650 (1976) (failure to claim
privilege against self-incrimination before disclosing incriminating information on tax returns forfeited the right to exclude that information in a criminal prosecution); United
States v. Kordel, 397 U. S. 1, 7 (1970) (criminal defendant forfeited his right to assert Fifth Amendment privilege with
regard to answers he gave to interrogatories in a prior civil
proceeding), it is necessary to allow assertion of the privilege
prior to the commencement of a "criminal case" to safeguard
the core Fifth Amendment trial right. If the privilege could
not be asserted in such situations, testimony given in those
judicial proceedings would be deemed "voluntary," see Rogers v. United States, 340 U. S. 367, 371 (1951); United States
v. Monia, 317 U. S. 424, 427 (1943); hence, insistence on a
prior grant of immunity is essential to memorialize the fact
that the testimony had indeed been compelled and therefore

protected from use against the speaker in any "criminalcase."

Rules designed to safeguard a constitutional right, how-ever, do not extend the scope of the constitutional right itself, just as violations of judicially crafted prophylactic rulesdo not violate the constitutional rights of any person. As
we explained, we have allowed the Fifth Amendment privi-lege to be asserted by witnesses in noncriminal cases in
order to safeguard the core constitutional right defined bythe Self-Incrimination Clause--the right not to be compelled
in any criminal case to be a witness against oneself. 3 Wehave likewise established the

Miranda exclusionary rule asa prophylactic measure to prevent violations of the right protected by the text of the Self-Incrimination Clause--the ad-mission into evidence in a criminal case of confessions obtained through coercive custodial questioning. See Warrenv. Lincoln, 864 F. 2d 1436, 1442 (CA8 1989) (alleged Miranda
violation not actionable under $ 1983); Giuffre v. Bissell, 31F. 3d 1241, 1256 (CA3 1994) (same);

Bennett v. Passic, 545F. 2d 1260, 1263 (CA10 1976) (same); see also New York v.

Quarles, 467 U. S. 649, 686 (1984) (Marshall, J., dissenting)("All the Fifth Amendment forbids is the introduction of coerced statements at trial"). Accordingly, Chavez's failure toread Miranda warnings to Martinez did not violate Martinez's constitutional rights and cannot be grounds for a $ 1983action. See Connecticut v. Barrett, 479 U. S. 523, 528 (1987)
(Miranda's warning requirement is "not itself required bythe Fifth Amendmen[t] . . . but is instead justified only by
reference to its prophylactic purpose"); Tucker, supra, at 444(

Miranda's safeguards "were not themselves rights pro-tected by the Constitution but were instead measures to insure that the right against compulsory self-incrimination wasprotected"). And the absence of a "criminal case" in which

Opinion of Thomas, J.
Martinez was compelled to be a "witness" against himselfdefeats his core Fifth Amendment claim. The Ninth Circuit's view that mere compulsi on violates the Self-Incrimination Clause, see 270 F. 3d, at 857;

California Attorneys for Criminal Justice v. Butts, 195 F. 3d 1039, 1045-1046(1999);

Cooper, 963 F. 2d, at 1243-1244, finds no support in
the text of the Fifth Amendment and is irreconcilable with
our case law.4 Because we find that Chavez's alleged con-duct did not violate the Self-Incrimination Clause, we reverse the Ninth Circuit's denial of qualified immunity as toMartinez's Fifth Amendment claim.

Our views on the proper scope of the Fifth Amendment'sSelf-Incrimination Clause do not mean that police torture or
other abuse that results in a confession is constitutionallypermissible so long as the statements are not used at trial;
it simply means that the Fourteenth Amendment's DueProcess Clause, rather than the Fifth Amendment's SelfIncrimination Clause, would govern the inquiry in those
cases and provide relief in appropriate circumstances.5

4 It is Justice Kennedy's indifference to the text of the SelfIncrimination Clause, as well as a conspicuous absence of a single citation
to the actual text of the Fifth Amendment, that permits him to adopt the
Ninth Circuit's interpretation.

Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385 (1978), on which Justice Kennedy
and Justice Ginsburg rely in support of their reading of the Fifth
Amendment, was a case addressing the admissibility of a coerced confession under the Due Process Clause. Mincey did not even mention the
Fifth Amendment or the Self-Incrimination Clause, and refutes Justice
Kennedy's and Justice Ginsburg's assertions that their interpretation
of that Clause would have been known to any reasonable officer at the
time Chavez conducted his interrogation.

5 We also do not see how, in light of Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386

(1989), Justice Kennedy can insist that "the Self-Incrimination Clause
is applicable at the time and place police use compulsion to extract a statement from a suspect" while at the same time maintaining that the use of
"torture or its equivalent in an attempt to induce a statement" violates
the Due Process Clause. Post, at 795, 796 (opinion concurring in part and
dissenting in part). Graham foreclosed the use of substantive due proc538US2 Unit: $U58 [10-27-04 16:56:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

The Fourteenth Amendment provides that no person shallbe deprived "of life, liberty, or property, without due process

of law." Convictions based on evidence obtained by meth-ods that are "so brutal and so offensive to human dignity"
that they "shoc[k] the conscience" violate the Due ProcessClause.

Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165, 172, 174 (1952)(overturning conviction based on evidence obtained by involuntary stomach pumping). See also Breithaupt v. Abram,352 U. S. 432, 435 (1957) (reiterating that evidence obtained
through conduct that " `shock[s] the conscience' " may not beused to support a criminal conviction). Although

Rochin
did not establish a civil remedy for abusive police behavior,
we recognized in County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U. S.833, 846 (1998), that deprivations of liberty caused by "the

most egregious official conduct," id., at 846, 847-848, n. 8,may violate the Due Process Clause. While we rejected, in
Lewis, a $ 1983 plaintiff 's contention that a police officer'sdeliberate indifference during a high-speed chase that caused
the death of a motorcyclist violated due process, id., at 854,we left open the possibility that unauthorized police behavior
in other contexts might "shock the conscience" and give riseto $ 1983 liability.

Id., at 850.
We are satisfied that Chavez's questioning did not violate
Martinez's due process rights. Even assuming, arguendo,that the persistent questioning of Martinez somehow deprived him of a liberty interest, we cannot agree with Martiess analysis in claims involving the use of excessive force in effecting an
arrest and held that such claims are governed solely by the Fourth
Amendment's prohibitions against "unreasonable" seizures, because the
Fourth Amendment provided the explicit source of constitutional protection against such conduct. 490 U. S., at 394-395. If, as Justice Kennedy believes, the Fifth Amendment's Self-Incrimination Clause governs
coercive police interrogation even absent use of compelled statements in
a criminal case, then Graham suggests that the Due Process Clause
would not.

nez's characterization of Chavez's behavior as "egregious" or"conscience shocking." As we noted in

Lewis, the official
conduct "most likely to rise to the conscience-shocking level"is the "conduct intended to injure in some way unjustifiable

by any government interest." Id., at 849. Here, there isno evidence that Chavez acted with a purpose to harm Martinez by intentionally interfering with his medical treatment.
Medical personnel were able to treat Martinez throughoutthe interview, App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a, 18a, and Chavez

ceased his questioning to allow tests and other proceduresto be performed.

Id., at 4a. Nor is there evidence that
Chavez's conduct exacerbated Martinez's injuries or prolonged his stay in the hospital. Moreover, the need to investigate whether there had been police misconduct constituted
a justifiable government interest given the risk that key evidence would have been lost if Martinez had died without the
authorities ever hearing his side of the story.

The Court has held that the Due Process Clause also protects certain "fundamental liberty interest[s]" from deprivation by the government, regardless of the procedures provided, unless the infringement is narrowly tailored to serve
a compelling state interest. Washington v. Glucksberg, 521
U. S. 702, 721 (1997). Only fundamental rights and liberties
which are " `deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition' " and " `implicit in the concept of ordered liberty' " qualify for such protection. Ibid. Many times, however, we
have expressed our reluctance to expand the doctrine of substantive due process, see Lewis, supra, at 842; Glucksberg,
supra, at 720; Albright v. Oliver, 510 U. S. 266, 271 (1994);
Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 302 (1993); in large part
"because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this
unchartered area are scarce and open-ended," Collins v.
Harker Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125 (1992). See also Regents
of Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, 474 U. S. 214, 225-226 (1985).

Glucksberg requires a " `careful description' " of the asserted fundamental liberty interest for the purposes of sub538US2 Unit: $U58 [10-27-04 16:56:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Thomas, J.
stantive due process analysis; vague generalities, such as
"the right not to be talked to," will not suffice. 521 U. S.,
at 721. We therefore must take into account the fact that
Martinez was hospitalized and in severe pain during the interview, but also that Martinez was a critical nonpolice witness to an altercation resulting in a shooting by a police officer, and that the situation was urgent given the perceived
risk that Martinez might die and crucial evidence might be
lost. In these circumstances, we can find no basis in our
prior jurisprudence, see, e. g., Miranda, 384 U. S., at 477-478
("It is an act of responsible citizenship for individuals to give
whatever information they may have to aid in law enforcement"), or in our Nation's history and traditions to suppose
that freedom from unwanted police questioning is a right so
fundamental that it cannot be abridged absent a "compelling
state interest." Flores, supra, at 302. We have never required such a justification for a police interrogation, and we
decline to do so here. The lack of any "guideposts for responsible decisionmaking" in this area, and our oft-stated
reluctance to expand the doctrine of substantive due process,
further counsel against recognizing a new "fundamental liberty interest" in this case.

We conclude that Martinez has failed to allege a violation
of the Fourteenth Amendment, and it is therefore unnecessary to inquire whether the right asserted by Martinez was
clearly established.

III

Because Chavez did not violate Martinez's Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, he was entitled to qualified immunity. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings.

It is so ordered.

Respondent Martinez's claim under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 forviolation of his privilege against compelled self-incrimination

Justice Thomas acknowledges. As he points out, thetext of the Fifth Amendment (applied here under the doctrine of Fourteenth Amendment incorporation) focuses oncourtroom use of a criminal defendant's compelled, selfincriminating testimony, and the core of the guaranteeagainst compelled self-incrimination is the exclusion of any
such evidence. Justice Ginsburg makes it clear that thepresent case is very close to

Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S.385 (1978), and Martinez's testimony would clearly be inadmissible if offered in evidence against him. But Martinezclaims more than evidentiary protection in asking this Court
to hold that the questioning alone was a completed violationof the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments subject to redress
by an action for damages under $ 1983.To recognize such a constitutional cause of action for compensation would, of course, be well outside the core of FifthAmendment protection, but that alone is not a sufficient reason to reject Martinez's claim. As Justice Harlan explainedin his dissent in

variety of Fifth Amendment holdings: barring compulsion togive testimonial evidence in a civil proceeding, see

McCarthy
v. Arndstein, 266 U. S. 34, 40 (1924); requiring a grant ofimmunity in advance of any testimonial proffer, see

Kastigar
v. United States, 406 U. S. 441, 446-447 (1972); precludingthreats or impositions of penalties that would undermine the

right to immunity, see, e. g., Uniformed Sanitation Men
Assn., Inc. v. Commissioner of Sanitation of City of New
York, 392 U. S. 280, 284-285 (1968); Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414
U. S. 70, 77-79 (1973); Lefkowitz v. Cunningham, 431 U. S.801, 804-806 (1977);

McKune v. Lile, 536 U. S. 24, 35 (2002)
(plurality opinion); and conditioning admissibility on warnings and waivers to promote intelligent choices and to simplify subsequent inquiry into voluntariness, see Miranda,
supra. All of this law is outside the Fifth Amendment's
core, with each case expressing a judgment that the core
guarantee, or the judicial capacity to protect it, would be
placed at some risk in the absence of such complementary
protection.

I do not, however, believe that Martinez can make the
"powerful showing," subject to a realistic assessment of costs
and risks, necessary to expand protection of the privilege
against compelled self-incrimination to the point of the civil
liability he asks us to recognize here. See id., at 515, 517
(Harlan, J., dissenting). The most obvious drawback inherent in Martinez's purely Fifth Amendment claim to damages
is its risk of global application in every instance of interrogation producing a statement inadmissible under Fifth
and Fourteenth Amendment principles, or violating one of
the complementary rules we have accepted in aid of the privilege against evidentiary use. If obtaining Martinez's statement is to be treated as a stand-alone violation of the privilege subject to compensation, why should the same not
be true whenever the police obtain any involuntary selfincriminating statement, or whenever the government so
much as threatens a penalty in derogation of the right to

Opinion of the Court
immunity, or whenever the police fail to honor Miranda?*Martinez offers no limiting principle or reason to foresee a

stopping place short of liability in all such cases.Recognizing an action for damages in every such instance
not only would revolutionize Fifth and Fourteenth Amend-ment law, but would beg the question that must inform every
extension or recognition of a complementary rule in serviceof the core privilege: why is this new rule necessary in aid
of the basic guarantee? Martinez has offered no reason tobelieve that the guarantee has been ineffective in all or many
of those circumstances in which its vindication has dependedon excluding testimonial admissions or barring penalties.
And I have no reason to believe the law has been systemi-cally defective in this respect.

But if there is no failure of efficacy infecting the existingbody of Fifth Amendment law, any argument for a damages
remedy in this case must depend not on its Fifth Amendmentfeature but upon the particular charge of outrageous conduct
by the police, extending from their initial encounter withMartinez through the questioning by Chavez. That claim,
however, if it is to be recognized as a constitutional one thatmay be raised in an action under $ 1983, must sound in substantive due process. See generally County of Sacramentov. Lewis, 523 U. S. 833, 849 (1998) ("[C]onduct intended to
injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interestis the sort of official action most likely to rise to the
conscience-shocking level"). Here, it is enough to say that
Justice Stevens shows that Martinez has a serious argument in support of such a position.

Whether Martinez may pursue a claim of liability for a
substantive due process violation is thus an issue that should

be addressed on remand, along with the scope and merits of
any such action that may be found open to him.

Justice Scalia, concurring in part in the judgment.
I agree with the Court's rejection of Martinez's Fifth
Amendment claim, that is, his claim that Chavez violated his
right not to be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness
against himself.1 See ante, at 766-767 (plurality opinion);
ante, at 777-779 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment). And
without a violation of the right protected by the text of the
Self-Incrimination Clause (what the plurality and Justice
Souter call the Fifth Amendment's "core"), Martinez's 42
U. S. C. $ 1983 action is doomed. Section 1983 does not provide remedies for violations of judicially created prophylactic
rules, such as the rule of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436
(1966), as the Court today holds, see ante, at 772 (plurality
opinion); post, at 789-790 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part
and dissenting in part); nor is it concerned with "extensions"
of constitutional provisions designed to safeguard actual constitutional rights, cf. ante, at 777-778 (Souter, J., concurring
in judgment).2 Rather, a plaintiff seeking redress through

$ 1983 must establish the violation of a federal constitutional
or statutory right. See Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U. S. 329,
340 (1997); Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 493
U. S. 103, 106 (1989).

1 While occasionally referring to this as a "Fifth Amendment claim,"
a convention commonly followed, Justice Thomas and Justice Souter
acknowledge that technically it is a Fourteenth Amendment claim, since
it is only through the Fourteenth Amendment that the Fifth is "made

perceived "purpose" of a constitutional provision. Cf. Martinez v. Oxnard, 270 F. 3d 852, 857 (CA9 2001) ("[T]he Fifth Amendment's purpose is
to prevent coercive interrogation practices that are destructive of human
dignity" (internal quotation marks omitted)).

Scalia, J., concurring in part in judgment
My reasons for rejecting Martinez's Fifth Amendmentclaim are those set forth in

Justice Thomas's opinion.
I join Parts I and II of that opinion, including Part II-B,which deals with substantive due process. Consideration

and rejection of that constitutional claim is absolutely neces-sary to support reversal of the Ninth Circuit's judgment.
For after discussing (and erroneously deciding) Martinez's
Fifth Amendment claim, the Ninth Circuit continued asfollows:

"Likewise, a police officer violates the Fourteenth
Amendment when he obtains a confession by coerciveconduct, regardless of whether the confession is subsequently used at trial. `The due process violation caused
by coercive behavior of law-enforcement officers in pur-suit of a confession is

complete with the coercive behavior itself. . . . The actual use or attempted use of that
coerced statement in a court of law is not necessary
to complete the affront to the Constitution.' Cooper v.
Dupnik, 963 F. 2d at 1244-45 (emphasis added).
Mr. Martinez has thus stated a prima facie case thatSergeant Chavez violated his Fifth and Fourteenth

Amendment rights to be free from police coercion inpursuit of a confession." 270 F. 3d 852, 857 (2001).

It seems to me impossible to interpret this passage as any-thing other than an invocation of the doctrine of "substantive
due process," which makes unlawful certain government con-duct, regardless of whether the procedural guarantees of the
Fifth Amendment (or the guarantees of any of the other pro-visions of the Bill of Rights) have been violated. See

Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702 (1997). To be sure, the
term "substantive due process" is not used in the quoted
passage, but the passage's technically false dichotomy between Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights
uses "Fourteenth Amendment rights" as a stand-in for that
aspect of the Fourteenth Amendment which consists of the

782 CHAVEZ v. MARTINEZ

Scalia, J., concurring in part in judgment
doctrine of substantive due process. (Justice Thomas usessimilar shorthand in the concluding sentence of his analysis:

"Our views on the proper scope of the Fifth Amendment'sSelf-Incrimination Clause do not mean that police torture or
other abuse that results in a confession is constitutionallypermissible so long as the statements are not used at trial;
it simply means that the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, rather than the Fifth Amendment's Self-Incrimination Clause, would govern the inquiry in those

cases." Ante, at 773.) What other possible meaning couldthe passage possess? Surely the Ninth Circuit was not expending a paragraph to make the utterly useless observation
that, in addition to violating the Fifth Amendment (because
that is incorporated in the Fourteenth) Chavez violated the
Fourteenth Amendment (because that incorporates the
Fifth). That substantive due process was the point is confirmed by the fact that the sole authority cited to support
violation of "the Fourteenth Amendment" is Cooper v. Dupnik, 963 F. 2d 1220, 1244-1245 (1992), a Ninth Circuit case
that explicitly recognized a substantive-due-process right to
be free from coercive police questioning. See id., at
1244-1250.

Since the Ninth Circuit's Fourteenth Amendment holding
rested upon substantive due process, we are without authority to disturb that court's judgment solely because of our disagreement with its Fifth Amendment (Self-Incrimination
Clause) analysis; the substantive-due-process holding provides an independent ground supporting the decision that
Chavez was not entitled to qualified immunity. While Justice Souter declines to address that independent ground--
even though the parties extensively briefed the issue, Brief
for Petitioner 21-36; Brief for Respondent 29-40; Reply Brief
for Petitioner 8-12; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae
17-23, and even though Justice Stevens discusses it in dissent, post, at 787-788 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part)--I believe that addressing it, and resolving

Opinion of Stevens, J.
it against respondent, is essential to the Court's disposition,which reverses the Ninth Circuit's judgment in its entirety.

I therefore see no basis for a remand to determine"[w]hether Martinez may pursue a claim of liability for a substantive due process violation." Ante, at 779 (majority opin-ion). That question has already been decided by the Ninth
Circuit, and we today reverse its decision. My disagreement with the Court, however, is of little consequence, be-cause Martinez will not be able to prevail on remand by raising anew his substantive-due-process claim. Not only is theclaim meritless, as

Justice Thomas demonstrates, ante, at
774-776, but Martinez already had his chance to press asubstantive-due-process theory in the Court of Appeals and

chose not to, even though Ninth Circuit precedent clearly
established substantive due process (including--contrary to
the Government's assertion at oral argument, see Tr. of Oral
Arg. 26--a "shocks the conscience" criterion) as an available
theory of liability under the Fourteenth Amendment. See
Cooper, supra, at 1248 ("There is a second Fourteenth
Amendment substantive due process yardstick available to
Cooper as a theory of $ 1983 liability. The test is whether
the Task Force's conduct `shocks the conscience' "). Nowhere did respondent's appellate brief mention the words
"substantive due process"; the only rights it asserted were
the right against self-incrimination and the right to warnings
under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). Appellees'
Responding Brief in No. 00-56520 (CA9), pp. 28-32, 36-43.
If, as Justice Souter apparently believes, the opinion
below did not address respondent's "substantive due process" claim, that claim has been forfeited.

As a matter of fact, the interrogation of respondent was
the functional equivalent of an attempt to obtain an involuntary confession from a prisoner by torturous methods. As

788 CHAVEZ v. MARTINEZ

Opinion of Stevens, J.
By its terms, the Fifth Amendment itself has no applica-tion to the States. It is, however, one source of the protections against state actions that deprive individuals of rights"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty" that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees. Indeed, as I pointed out inmy dissent in

Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298, 371 (1985), it
is the most specific provision in the Bill of Rights "that protects all citizens from the kind of custodial interrogation thatwas once employed by the Star Chamber, by `the Germans

of the 1930's and early 1940's,' and by some of our own policedepartments only a few decades ago."

2 Whenever it occurs,

as it did here, official interrogation of that character is a clas-sic example of a violation of a constitutional right "implicit

in the concept of ordered liberty." 3
in confession at 1:20 a.m.; court held `[w]arnings . . . were insufficient to
cure such blatant abuse or compensate for the coercion in this case')."

2 Adding to the cases cited by Justice O'Connor, I appended this footnote: "See, e. g., Leyra v. Denno, 347 U. S. 556 (1954); Malinski v. New
York, 324 U. S. 401 (1945); Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U. S. 143 (1944);
Ward v. Texas, 316 U. S. 547 (1942); Vernon v. Alabama, 313 U. S. 547

15 N. Y. 2d 235, 205 N. E. 2d 857 (1965) (potential witness tortured by
police). Such custodial interrogation is, of course, closer to that employed
by the Soviet Union than that which our constitutional scheme tolerates.
See Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U. S. 1, 15-16 (1970) (opinion of Douglas, J.)
(`In [Russia] detention incommunicado is the common practice, and the
period of permissible detention now extends for nine months. Where
there is custodial interrogation, it is clear that the critical stage of the
trial takes place long before the courtroom formalities commence. That
is apparent to one who attends criminal trials in Russia. Those that I
viewed never put in issue the question of guilt; guilt was an issue resolved
in the inner precincts of a prison under questioning by the police')." Id.,

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
I respectfully dissent, but for the reasons articulated by
Justice Kennedy, post, at 799, concur in Part II of Justice
Souter's opinion.

Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice Stevens joins,
and with whom Justice Ginsburg joins as to Parts II and
III, concurring in part and dissenting in part.

A single police interrogation now presents us with two
issues: first, whether failure to give a required warning
under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), was itself
a completed constitutional violation actionable under 42
U. S. C. $ 1983; and second, whether an actionable violation
arose at once under the Self-Incrimination Clause (applicable
to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment) when the
police, after failing to warn, used severe compulsion or extraordinary pressure in an attempt to elicit a statement or
confession.

I agree with Justice Thomas that failure to give a Miranda warning does not, without more, establish a completed
violation when the unwarned interrogation ensues. As to
the second aspect of the case, which does not involve the
simple failure to give a Miranda warning, it is my respectful
submission that Justice Souter and Justice Thomas
are incorrect. They conclude that a violation of the SelfIncrimination Clause does not arise until a privileged statement is introduced at some later criminal proceeding.

A constitutional right is traduced the moment torture or
its close equivalents are brought to bear. Constitutional

Amendment. Justice Thomas' opinion is fundamentally flawed in two
respects. It incorrectly assumes that the claim it rejects is not a due
process claim, ante, at 772-773, and it incorrectly assumes that coercive
interrogation is not unconstitutional when it occurs because it merely violates a judge-made "prophylactic" rule. But the violation in this case is
far more serious than a mere failure to advise respondent of his Miranda
rights; moreover, the Court disavowed the "prophylactic" characterization
of Miranda in Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 437-439 (2000).

790 CHAVEZ v. MARTINEZ

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
protection for a tortured suspect is not held in abeyance untilsome later criminal proceeding takes place. These are the

premises of this separate opinion.

I
The Miranda warning, as is now well settled, is a constitu-tional requirement adopted to reduce the risk of a coerced

confession and to implement the Self-Incrimination Clause.
Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 444 (2000); Miranda v. Arizona, supra, at 467. Miranda mandates a ruleof exclusion. It must be so characterized, for it has significant exceptions that can only be assessed and determined inthe course of trial. Unwarned custodial interrogation does
not in every instance violate Miranda. See, e. g., New Yorkv. Quarles, 467 U. S. 649 (1984) (statement admissible if questioning was immediately necessary for public safety). Fur-thermore, statements secured in violation of Miranda are
admissible in some instances. See, e. g., Harris v. New York,401 U. S. 222 (1971) (statement admissible for purposes of
impeachment). The identification of a Miranda violationand its consequences, then, ought to be determined at trial.
The exclusion of unwarned statements, when not within anexception, is a complete and sufficient remedy.

II
Justice Souter and Justice Thomas are wrong, in myview, to maintain that in all instances a violation of the SelfIncrimination Clause simply does not occur unless and untila statement is introduced at trial, no matter how severe the
pain or how direct and commanding the official compulsionused to extract it.

It must be remembered that the Self-Incrimination Clauseof the Fifth Amendment is applicable to the States in its
full text through the Due Process Clause of the FourteenthAmendment.

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
proper interpretation of the Self-Incrimination Clause in thecontext of the present dispute.

Our cases and our legal tradition establish that the Self-Incrimination Clause is a substantive constraint on the conduct of the government, not merely an evidentiary rule gov-erning the work of the courts. The Clause must provide
more than mere assurance that a compelled statement will
not be introduced against its declarant in a criminal trial.Otherwise there will be too little protection against the compulsion the Clause prohibits. The Clause protects an indi-vidual from being forced to give answers demanded by an
official in any context when the answers might give rise to
criminal liability in the future. "It can be asserted in any
proceeding, civil or criminal, administrative or judicial, investigatory or adjudicatory; and it protects against any disclosures that the witness reasonably believes could be used
in a criminal prosecution or could lead to other evidence that
might be so used." Kastigar v. United States, 406 U. S. 441,
444-445 (1972) (footnotes omitted). The decision in Kastigar described the Self-Incrimination Clause as an exemption
from the testimonial duty. Ibid. As the duty is immediate,
so must be the privilege. Furthermore, the exercise of the
privilege depends on what the witness reasonably believes
will be the future use of a statement. Id., at 445. Again,
this indicates the existence of a present right.

The Clause provides both assurance that a person will not
be compelled to testify against himself in a criminal proceeding and a continuing right against government conduct intended to bring about self-incrimination. Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U. S. 70, 77 (1973) ("The Amendment not only
protects the individual against being involuntarily called as
a witness against himself in a criminal prosecution but also
privileges him not to answer official questions put to him in
any other proceeding, civil or criminal, formal or informal,
where the answers might incriminate him in future criminal
proceedings"); accord, Bram v. United States, 168 U. S. 532,

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
542-543 (1897); Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U. S. 547, 562(1892). The principle extends to forbid policies which exert

official compulsion that might induce a person into forfeitinghis rights under the Clause.

Lefkowitz v. Cunningham, 431
U. S. 801, 806 (1977) ("These cases settle that governmentcannot penalize assertion of the constitutional privilege

against compelled self-incrimination by imposing sanctions
to compel testimony which has not been immunized"); accord,
Uniformed Sanitation Men Assn., Inc. v. Commissioner of
Sanitation of City of New York, 392 U. S. 280 (1968); Gardner v. Broderick, 392 U. S. 273, 279 (1968). Justice Souter
and Justice Thomas acknowledge a future privilege. Ante,
at 777-778; ante, at 769. That does not end the matter. A
future privilege does not negate a present right.

Their position finds some support in a single statement in
United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U. S. 259, 264 (1990)
("Although conduct by law enforcement officials prior to trial
may ultimately impair that right [against compelled selfincrimination], a constitutional violation occurs only at
trial"). That case concerned the application of the Fourth
Amendment, and the extent of the right secured under the
Self-Incrimination Clause was not then before the Court.
Ibid. Furthermore, Verdugo-Urquidez involved a prosecution in the United States arising from a criminal investigation in another country, id., at 274-275, so there was a special
reason for the Court to be concerned about the application
of the Clause in that context, id., at 269 (noting the Court
had "rejected the claim that aliens are entitled to Fifth
Amendment rights outside the sovereign territory of the
United States" (citing Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763
(1950))). In any event, the decision cannot be read to support the proposition that the application of the Clause is
limited in the way Justice Souter and Justice Thomas
describe today.

A recent case illustrates that a violation of the SelfIncrimination Clause may have immediate consequences.

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
Just last Term, nine Justices all proceeded from the premisethat a present, completed violation of the Self-Incrimination

Clause could occur if an incarcerated prisoner were requiredto admit to past crimes on pain of forfeiting certain privileges or being assigned harsher conditions of confinement.
McKune v. Lile, 536 U. S. 24 (2002); id., at 48 (O'Connor, J.,
concurring in judgment); id., at 54 (Stevens, J., dissenting).
Although there was disagreement over whether a violationoccurred in the circumstances of that case, there was no disagreement that a present violation could have taken place.No Member of the Court suggested that the absence of a
pending criminal proceeding made the Self-Incrimination
Clause inquiry irrelevant.

This is not to say all questions as to the meaning and extent of the Clause are simple of resolution, or that all of the
cited cases are easy to reconcile. Many questions about the
application of the Self-Incrimination Clause are close and difficult. There are instances, moreover, when incriminating
statements can be required from a reluctant witness, see,
e. g., Gardner, supra, at 276, and others where information
may be required even absent a promise of immunity, see,
e. g., Shapiro v. United States, 335 U. S. 1, 19 (1948). Justice Souter and Justice Thomas are correct to note that
testimony may be ordered, on pain of contempt, if appropriate immunity is granted. It does not follow that the
Clause establishes no present right. The immunity rule
simply shows that the right is not absolute.

The conclusion that the Self-Incrimination Clause is not
violated until the government seeks to use a statement in
some later criminal proceeding strips the Clause of an essential part of its force and meaning. This is no small matter. It should come as an unwelcome surprise to judges,
attorneys, and the citizenry as a whole that if a legislative
committee or a judge in a civil case demands incriminating
testimony without offering immunity, and even imposes sanctions for failure to comply, that the witness and counsel can538US2 Unit: $U58 [10-27-04 16:56:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

not insist the right against compelled self-incrimination isapplicable then and there.

Justice Souter and Justice
Thomas, I submit, should be more respectful of the under-standing that has prevailed for generations now. To tell our

whole legal system that when conducting a criminal investi-gation police officials can use severe compulsion or even torture with no present violation of the right against compelled
self-incrimination can only diminish a celebrated provision inthe Bill of Rights. A Constitution survives over time because the people share a common, historic commitment tocertain simple but fundamental principles which preserve
their freedom. Today's decision undermines one of those re-spected precepts.

Dean Griswold explained the place the Self-IncriminationClause has secured in our legal heritage:

"The Fifth Amendment has been very nearly a lone surerock in a time of storm. It has been one thing which
has held quite firm, although something like a jugger-naut has pushed upon it. It has, thus, through all its
vicissitudes, been a symbol of the ultimate moral senseof the community, upholding the best in us, when otherwise there was a good deal of wavering under the pres-sures of the times." E. Griswold, The Fifth Amendment Today 73 (1955).
It damages the law, and the vocabulary with which we
impart our legal tradition from one generation to the next,to downgrade our understanding of what the Fifth Amendment requires.There is some authority, it must be acknowledged, for the
proposition that the act of torturing to obtain a confession is
not comprehended within the Self-Incrimination Clause itself. In Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278 (1936), the
Court held that convictions based upon tortured confessions
could not stand, but it identified the Due Process Clause, and
not the Self-Incrimination Clause, as the source for its ruling.

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
Id., at 285. The Court interpreted the Self-IncriminationClause as limited to "the processes of justice by which the

accused may be called as a witness and required to testify.Compulsion by torture to extort a confession is a different
matter." Ibid. The decision in Brown antedated the incor-poration of the Clause and the ensuing understanding of its
fundamental role in our legal system.The views expressed by

Justice Souter and Justice
Thomas also have some academic support. Professor Mc-Naughton, in his revision of Professor Wigmore's treatise on

the law of evidence, recites various rationales for the Self-Incrimination Clause, declaring all of them insufficient. 8 J.
Wigmore, Evidence $ 2251 (J. McNaughton rev. ed. 1961).The 11th justification he discusses is the prevention of torture, id., at 315, a practice Professor McNaughton simplyassures us will not be revived,

ibid.This is not convincing. The Constitution is based upon

the theory that when past abuses are forbidden the resultingright has present meaning. A police officer's interrogation
is different in a formal sense from interrogation ordered byan official inquest, but the close relation between the two
ought not to be so quickly discounted. Even if some thinkthe abuses of the Star Chamber cannot revive, the specter
of Sheriff Screws, see Screws v. United States, 325 U. S. 91(1945), or of the deputies who beat the confessions out of the
defendants in Brown v. Mississippi, is not so easily banished.See

Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298, 312, n. 3 (1985); id., at371-372, n. 19 (

Stevens, J., dissenting).

III
In my view the Self-Incrimination Clause is applicable atthe time and place police use compulsion to extract a statement from a suspect. The Clause forbids that conduct. Amajority of the Court has now concluded otherwise, but that
should not end this case. It simply implicates the largerdefinition of liberty under the Due Process Clause of the

796 CHAVEZ v. MARTINEZ

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
Fourteenth Amendment. D ickerson, 530 U. S., at 433("Over time, our cases recognized two constitutional bases

for the requirement that a confession be voluntary to be ad-mitted into evidence: the Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination and the Due Process Clause of the Four-teenth Amendment"). Turning to this essential, but less
specific, guarantee, it seems to me a simple enough matter
to say that use of torture or its equivalent in an attempt toinduce a statement violates an individual's fundamental right

to liberty of the person. Brown, supra, at 285; Palko v.
Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319 (1937); see also Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165 (1952). The Constitution does not countenance the official imposition of severe pain or pressure for
purposes of interrogation. This is true whether the protection is found in the Self-Incrimination Clause, the broader
guarantees of the Due Process Clause, or both.

That brings us to the interrogation in this case. Had the
officer inflicted the initial injuries sustained by Martinez (the
gunshot wounds) for purposes of extracting a statement,
there would be a clear and immediate violation of the Constitution, and no further inquiry would be needed. That is not
what happened, however. The initial injuries and anguish
suffered by the suspect were not inflicted to aid the interrogation. The wounds arose from events preceding it. True,
police officers had caused the injuries, but they had not done
so to compel a statement or with the purpose of facilitating
some later interrogation. The case can be analyzed, then,
as if the wounds had been inflicted by some third person, and
the officer came to the hospital to interrogate.

There is no rule against interrogating suspects who are in
anguish and pain. The police may have legitimate reasons,
borne of exigency, to question a person who is suffering or
in distress. Locating the victim of a kidnaping, ascertaining
the whereabouts of a dangerous assailant or accomplice, or
determining whether there is a rogue police officer at large
are some examples. That a suspect is in fear of dying, fur538US2 Unit: $U58 [10-27-04 16:56:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

797Cite as: 538 U. S. 760 (2003)
Opinion of Kennedy, J.
thermore, may not show compulsion but just the opposite.The fear may be a motivating factor to volunteer information. The words of a declarant who believes his death isimminent have a special status in the law of evidence. See,
e. g., Mattox v. United States, 146 U. S. 140, 152 (1892) ("Theadmission of the testimony is justified upon the ground of
necessity, and in view of the consideration that the certain
expectation of almost immediate death will remove all temp-tation to falsehood, and enforce as strict adherence to the

truth as the obligation of an oath could impose"); see alsoFed. Rule Evid. 804(b)(2) (providing an exception from the
hearsay rule for certain statements uttered under belief of
impending death). A declarant in Martinez's circumstances
may want to tell his story even if it increases his pain and
agony to do so. The Constitution does not forbid the police
from offering a person an opportunity to volunteer evidence
he wishes to reveal.

There are, however, actions police may not take if the prohibition against the use of coercion to elicit a statement is
to be respected. The police may not prolong or increase a
suspect's suffering against the suspect's will. That conduct
would render government officials accountable for the increased pain. The officers must not give the impression
that severe pain will be alleviated only if the declarant cooperates, for that, too, uses pain to extract a statement. In a
case like this one, recovery should be available under $ 1983
if a complainant can demonstrate that an officer exploited his
pain and suffering with the purpose and intent of securing
an incriminating statement. That showing has been made
here.

The transcript of the interrogation set out by Justice
Stevens, ante, at 784-786 (opinion concurring in part and
dissenting in part), and other evidence considered by the
District Court demonstrate that the suspect thought his
treatment would be delayed, and thus his pain and condition
worsened, by refusal to answer questions.

798 CHAVEZ v. MARTINEZ

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
It is true that the interrogation was not continuous. Ten
minutes of questions and answers were spread over a 45-
minute interval. App. to Pet. for Cert. 27a. Treatment
was apparently administered during those interruptions.
The pauses in the interrogation, however, do not indicate any
error in the trial court's findings and conclusions.

The District Court found that Martinez "had been shot in
the face, both eyes were injured; he was screaming in pain,
and coming in and out of consciousness while being repeatedly questioned about details of the encounter with the police." Id., at 22a. His blinding facial wounds made it impossible for him visually to distinguish the interrogating
officer from the attending medical personnel. The officer
made no effort to dispel the perception that medical treatment was being withheld until Martinez answered the questions put to him. There was no attempt through Miranda
warnings or other assurances to advise the suspect that his
cooperation should be voluntary. Martinez begged the officer to desist and provide treatment for his wounds, but the
questioning persisted despite these pleas and despite Martinez's unequivocal refusal to answer questions. Cf. Mincey
v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 398 (1978) (Court said of similar
circumstances: "It is hard to imagine a situation less conducive to the exercise of a rational intellect and a free will"
(internal quotation marks omitted)).

The standards governing the interrogation of suspects and
witnesses who suffer severe pain must accommodate the exigencies that law enforcement personnel encounter in circumstances like this case. It is clear enough, however, that the
police should take the necessary steps to ensure that there
is neither the fact nor the perception that the declarant's
pain is being used to induce the statement against his will.
In this case no reasonable police officer would believe that
the law permitted him to prolong or increase pain to obtain
a statement. The record supports the ultimate finding that

Opinion of Ginsburg, J.
the officer acted with the intent of exploiting Martinez's condition for purposes of extracting a statement.

Accordingly, I would affirm the decision of the Court of
Appeals that a cause of action under $ 1983 has been stated.
The other opinions filed today, however, reach different conclusions as to the correct disposition of the case. Were Justice Stevens, Justice Ginsburg, and I to adhere to our
position, there would be no controlling judgment of the
Court. In these circumstances, and because a ruling on substantive due process in this case could provide much of the
essential protection the Self-Incrimination Clause secures,
I join Part II of Justice Souter's opinion and would remand the case for further consideration.

Justice Ginsburg, concurring in part and dissenting in
part.

I join Parts II and III of Justice Kennedy's opinion.
For reasons well stated therein, I would hold that the SelfIncrimination Clause applies at the time and place police use
severe compulsion to extract a statement from a suspect.
See ante, at 790-798 and this page (opinion concurring in
part and dissenting in part). The evidence in this case, as
Justice Kennedy explains, supports the conclusion "that
the suspect thought his treatment would be delayed, and
thus his pain and condition worsened, by refusal to answer
questions." Ante, at 797. I write separately to state my
view that, even if no finding were made concerning Martinez's belief that refusal to answer would delay his treatment,
or Chavez's intent to create such an impression, the interrogation in this case would remain a clear instance of the kind
of compulsion no reasonable officer would have thought constitutionally permissible.

In Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385 (1978), appropriately
referenced by Justice Kennedy, see ante, at 798, this Court
held involuntary certain statements made during an in538US2 Unit: $U58 [10-27-04 16:56:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Ginsburg, J.
hospital police interrogation.1 The suspect questioned inMincey had been "seriously wounded just a few hours earlier," and "[a]lthough he had received some treatment, hiscondition at the time of [the] interrogation was still sufficiently serious that he was in the intensive care unit." 437U. S., at 398. He was interrogated while "lying on his back
on a hospital bed, encumbered by tubes, needles, and breath-ing apparatus."

Id., at 399. Despite the suspect's clear andrepeated indications that he did not want to talk, the officer

persisted in questioning him as he drifted in and out of con-sciousness. The Court thought it "apparent" in these circumstances that the suspect's statements "were not theproduct of his free and rational choice." Id., at 401 (internal
quotation marks omitted).Martinez's interrogation strikingly resembles the hospitalbed questioning in Mincey. Like the suspect in Mincey,Martinez was "at the complete mercy of [his interrogator],
unable to escape or resist the thrust of [the] interrogation."
Id., at 399 (internal quotation marks omitted). As Justice
Kennedy notes, Martinez "had been shot in the face, botheyes were injured; he was screaming in pain, and coming in

and out of consciousness while being repeatedly questionedabout details of the encounter with the police."

Ante, at 798(quoting Martinez v. Oxnard, CV 98-9313 (CD Cal., July 31,

2000), p. 7, App. to Pet. for Cert. 22a). "In this debilitatedand helpless condition, [Martinez] clearly expressed his wish
not to be interrogated." Mincey, 437 U. S., at 399. Chaveznonetheless continued to question him, "ceas[ing] the interrogation only during intervals when [Martinez] lost con-sciousness or received medical treatment." Id., at 401.
Martinez was "weakened by pain and shock"; "barely con-scious, . . . his will was simply overborne."

Id., at 401-402.

1 While Mincey concerned admissibility under the Due Process Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment, its analysis of the coercive nature of the
interrogation is nonetheless instructive in this case. See Dickerson v.
United States, 530 U. S. 428, 433-434 (2000).

Thus, whatever Martinez might have thought about Cha-vez's interference with his treatment, I would agree with the

prisoner by torturous methods"); cf. 4 J. Wigmore, Evidence$ 2251, p. 827 (1923) (noting about police interrogations
common-law jurisprudence seeks to ward off: "It is far plea-santer to sit comfortably in the shade rubbing red pepper
into a poor devil's eyes than to go about in the sun hunting up evidence." (emphasis deleted and internal quotation

In common with the Due Process Clause, the privilege
against self-incrimination safeguards "the freedom of the individual from the arbitrary power of governmental authorities." E. Griswold, The Fifth Amendment Today 51 (1955).
Closely connected "with the struggle to eliminate torture as
a governmental practice," id., at 3, the privilege is rightly
regarded as "one of the great landmarks in man's struggle

NATIONAL PARK HOSPITALITY ASSOCIATION v.DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuit

No. 02-196. Argued March 4, 2003--Decided May 27, 2003
The Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (CDA) establishes rules governing disputes arising out of certain Government contracts. After Congress
enacted the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998, establishing a comprehensive concession management program for national
parks, the National Park Service (NPS) issued implementing regulations including 36 CFR $ 51.3, which purports to render the CDA inapplicable to concession contracts. Petitioner concessioners' association
challenged $ 51.3's validity. The District Court upheld the regulation,
concluding that the CDA is ambiguous on whether it applies to concession contracts and finding NPS' interpretation reasonable under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.
837. The District of Columbia Circuit affirmed, placing no reliance on
Chevron, but finding NPS' reading of the CDA consistent with both the
CDA and the 1998 Act.

Held: The controversy is not yet ripe for judicial resolution. Determining whether administrative action is ripe requires evaluation of (1) the
issues' fitness for judicial decision and (2) the hardship to the parties of
withholding court consideration. Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387
U. S. 136, 149. Regarding the hardship inquiry, the federal respondents
concede that, because NPS has no delegated rulemaking authority
under the CDA, $ 51.3 is not a legislative regulation with the force of
law. And their assertion that $ 51.3 is an interpretative regulation advising the public of the agency's construction of the statutes and rules
which it administers is incorrect, as NPS is not empowered to administer the CDA. That task rests with agency contracting officers and
boards of contract appeals, as well as the federal courts; and any authority regarding the agency boards' proper arrangement belongs to the
Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy. Consequently, $ 51.3 is
nothing more than a general policy statement designed to inform the
public of NPS' views on the CDA's proper application. Thus, $ 51.3 does
not create "adverse effects of a strictly legal kind," which are required
for a hardship showing. Ohio Forestry Assn., Inc. v. Sierra Club, 523
U. S. 726, 733. Moreover, $ 51.3 does not affect a concessioner's primary
conduct, e. g., Toilet Goods Assn., Inc. v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 158, 164,

Opinion of the Court

as it leaves the concessioner free to conduct its business as it sees fit.
Moreover, nothing in the regulation prevents concessioners from following the procedures set forth in the CDA once a dispute over a concession
contract actually arises. This Court has previously found that challenges to regulations similar to $ 51.3 were not ripe for lack of a hardship
showing. See, e. g., id., at 161-162. Petitioner's contention that delaying judicial resolution of the issue will cause real harm because the
CDA's applicability vel non is a factor taken into account by a concessioner preparing its bids is unpersuasive. Mere uncertainty as to the
validity of a legal rule does not constitute a hardship for purposes of
the ripeness analysis. As to whether the issue here is fit for review,
further factual development would "significantly advance [this Court's]
ability to deal with the legal issues presented," Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., 438 U. S. 59, 82, even though
the question is "purely legal" and $ 51.3 constitutes "final agency action"
under the Administrative Procedure Act, Abbott Laboratories, supra,
at 149. Judicial resolution of the question presented here should await
a concrete dispute about a particular concession contract. Pp. 807-812.

ports to render the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (CDA), 92Stat. 2383, 41 U. S. C. $ 601 et seq., inapplicable to concession

contracts. We conclude that the controversy is not yet ripefor judicial resolution.

I
The CDA establishes rules governing disputes arising outof certain Government contracts.

1 The statute provides

that these disputes first be submitted to an agency's con-tracting officer. $ 605. A Government contractor dissatisfied with the contracting officer's decision may seek revieweither from the United States Court of Federal Claims or
from an administrative board in the agency. See $$ 606,607(d), 609(a). Either decision may then be appealed to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.2See 28 U. S. C. $ 1295; 41 U. S. C. $ 607(g).

Since 1916 Congress has charged NPS to "promote andregulate the use of the Federal areas known as national
parks," "conserve the scenery and the natural and historicobjects and the wild life therein," and "provide for [their]
enjoyment [in a way that] will leave them unimpaired for theenjoyment of future generations." An Act To establish a
National Park Service, 39 Stat. 535, 16 U. S. C. $ 1. To makevisits to national parks more enjoyable for the public, Congress authorized NPS to "grant privileges, leases, and per-mits for the use of land for the accommodation of visitors."

1 Title 41 U. S. C. $ 602(a) provides:
"Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, this chapter applies to
any express or implied contract (including those of the nonappropriated
fund activities described in sections 1346 and 1491 of title 28) entered into
by an executive agency for--

"(1) the procurement of property, other than real property in being;
"(2) the procurement of services;
"(3) the procurement of construction, alteration, repair or maintenance
of real property; or,

"(4) the disposal of personal property."
2 The CDA also provides that a prevailing contractor is entitled to prejudgment interest. $ 611.

DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR

Opinion of the Court

$ 3, 39 Stat. 535. Such "privileges, leases, and permits" havebecome embodied in national parks concession contracts.

The specific rules governing national parks concession con-tracts have changed over time. In 1998, however, Congress
enacted the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of1998 (1998 Act or Act), Pub. L. 105-391, 112 Stat. 3497 (codified with certain exceptions in 16 U. S. C. $$ 5951-5966), es-tablishing a new and comprehensive concession management
program for national parks. The 1998 Act authorizes theSecretary of the Interior to enact regulations implementing
the Act's provisions, $ 5965.NPS, to which the Secretary has delegated her authority
under the 1998 Act, promptly began a rulemaking proceedingto implement the Act. After notice and comment, final regulations were issued in April 2000. 65 Fed. Reg. 20630(2000) (codified in 36 CFR pt. 51). The regulations define
the term "concession contract" as follows:

"A concession contract (or contract) means a bindingwritten agreement between the Director and a concessioner . . . . Concession contracts are not contractswithin the meaning of 41 U. S. C. 601 et seq. (the Contract Disputes Act) and are not service or procurementcontracts within the meaning of statutes, regulations or
policies that apply only to federal service contracts orother types of federal procurement actions."

3 36 CFR

$ 51.3 (2002).

Through this provision NPS took a position with respectto a longstanding controversy with the Department of Interior's Board of Contract Appeals (IBCA). Beginning in 1989,the IBCA ruled that NPS concession contracts were subject
to the CDA, see R & R Enterprises, 89-2 B. C. A., || 21708,pp. 109145-109147 (1989), and subsequent attempts by NPS
to convince the IBCA otherwise proved unavailing, National

Petitioner challenged the validity of $ 51.3 in the District
Court for the District of Columbia. Amfac Resorts, L. L. C.
v. United States Dept. of Interior, 142 F. Supp. 2d 54, 80-82
(2001). The District Court upheld the regulation, applying
the deference principle of Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural
Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984). The
court concluded that the CDA is ambiguous on whether it
applies to concession contracts and found NPS' interpretation of the CDA reasonable. 142 F. Supp. 2d, at 80-82.

The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed, albeit on different grounds. Amfac Resorts,
L. L. C. v. United States Dept. of Interior, 282 F. 3d 818,
834-835 (2002). Recognizing that NPS "does not administer
the [CDA], and thus may not have interpretative authority
over its provisions," the court placed no reliance on Chevron
but simply "agree[d]" with NPS' reading of the CDA, finding
that reading consistent with both the CDA and the 1998 Act.
282 F. 3d, at 835. We granted certiorari to consider whether
the CDA applies to contracts between NPS and concessioners in the national parks. 537 U. S. 1018 (2002). Because
petitioner has brought a facial challenge to the regulation and is not litigating any concrete dispute with NPS,
we asked the parties to provide supplemental briefing on
whether the case is ripe for judicial action. Tr. of Oral
Arg. 62.

Ripeness is a justiciability doctrine designed "to prevent
the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication,
from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over
administrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from
judicial interference until an administrative decision has
been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the

challenging parties." Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387U. S. 136, 148-149 (1967); accord,

Ohio Forestry Assn., Inc.
v. Sierra Club, 523 U. S. 726, 732-733 (1998). The ripenessdoctrine is "drawn both from Article III limitations on judicial power and from prudential reasons for refusing to exer-cise jurisdiction,"

Reno v. Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509
U. S. 43, 57, n. 18 (1993) (citations omitted), but, even in a
case raising only prudential concerns, the question of ripe-ness may be considered on a court's own motion.

Determining whether administrative action is ripe for judicial review requires us to evaluate (1) the fitness of the
issues for judicial decision and (2) the hardship to the parties
of withholding court consideration. Abbott Laboratories,
supra, at 149. "Absent [a statutory provision providing for
immediate judicial review], a regulation is not ordinarily considered the type of agency action `ripe' for judicial review
under the [Administrative Procedure Act (APA)] until the
scope of the controversy has been reduced to more manageable proportions, and its factual components fleshed out, by
some concrete action applying the regulation to the claimant's situation in a fashion that harms or threatens to harm
him. (The major exception, of course, is a substantive rule
which as a practical matter requires the plaintiff to adjust
his conduct immediately. . . .)" Lujan v. National Wildlife
Federation, 497 U. S. 871, 891 (1990). Under the facts now
before us, we conclude this case is not ripe.

We turn first to the hardship inquiry. The federal respondents concede that, because NPS has no delegated rulemaking authority under the CDA, the challenged portion of

$ 51.3 cannot be a legislative regulation with the force of law.
See Brief for Federal Respondents 15, n. 6; Supplemental
Brief for Federal Respondents 6. They note, though, that
"agencies may issue interpretive rules `to advise the public
of the agency's construction of the statutes and rules which

Opinion of the Court
it administers,' " Brief for Federal Respondents 15, n. 6
(quoting Shalala v. Guernsey Memorial Hospital, 514 U. S.
87, 99 (1995) (emphasis added)), and seek to characterize

$ 51.3 as such an interpretive rule.

We disagree. Unlike in Guernsey Memorial Hospital,
where the agency issuing the interpretative guideline was
responsible for administering the relevant statutes and regulations, NPS is not empowered to administer the CDA.
Rather, the task of applying the CDA rests with agency contracting officers and boards of contract appeals, as well
as the Federal Court of Claims, the Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit, and, ultimately, this Court. Moreover,
under the CDA, any authority regarding the proper arrangement of agency boards belongs to the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy. See 41 U. S. C. $ 607(h) ("Pursuant
to the authority conferred under the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act [41 U. S. C. $ 401 et seq.], the Administrator is authorized and directed, as may be necessary or
desirable to carry out the provisions of this chapter, to issue
guidelines with respect to criteria for the establishment,
functions, and procedures of the agency boards . . ."). Consequently, we consider $ 51.3 to be nothing more than a "general statemen[t] of policy" designed to inform the public
of NPS' views on the proper application of the CDA. 5
U. S. C. $ 553(b)(3)(A).

Viewed in this light, $ 51.3 does not create "adverse effects
of a strictly legal kind," which we have previously required
for a showing of hardship. Ohio Forestry Assn., Inc., 523
U. S., at 733. Just like the Forest Service plan at issue in
Ohio Forestry, $ 51.3 "do[es] not command anyone to do anything or to refrain from doing anything; [it] do[es] not grant,
withhold, or modify any formal legal license, power, or authority; [it] do[es] not subject anyone to any civil or criminal
liability; [and it] create[s] no legal rights or obligations."

Opinion of the Court

Moreover, $ 51.3 does not affect a concessioner's primary
conduct. Toilet Goods Assn., Inc. v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 158,
164 (1967); Ohio Forestry Assn., supra, at 733-734. Unlike
the regulation at issue in Abbott Laboratories, which required drug manufacturers to change the labels, advertisements, and promotional materials they used in marketing
prescription drugs on pain of criminal and civil penalties,
see 387 U. S., at 152-153, the regulation here leaves a concessioner free to conduct its business as it sees fit. See also
Gardner v. Toilet Goods Assn., Inc., 387 U. S. 167, 171 (1967)
(regulations governing conditions for use of color additives in foods, drugs, and cosmetics were "self-executing"
and had "an immediate and substantial impact upon the
respondents").

We have previously found that challenges to regulations
similar to $ 51.3 were not ripe for lack of a showing of hardship. In Toilet Goods Assn., for example, the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) issued a regulation requiring
producers of color additives to provide FDA employees with
access to all manufacturing facilities, processes, and formulae. 387 U. S., at 161-162. We concluded the case was not
ripe for judicial review because the impact of the regulation
could not "be said to be felt immediately by those subject to
it in conducting their day-to-day affairs" and "no irremediabl[y] adverse consequences flow[ed] from requiring a later
challenge." Id., at 164. Indeed, the FDA regulation was
more onerous than $ 51.3 because failure to comply with it
resulted in the suspension of the producer's certification and,
consequently, could affect production. See id., at 165, and
n. 2. Here, by contrast, concessioners suffer no practical
harm as a result of $ 51.3. All the regulation does is announce the position NPS will take with respect to disputes
arising out of concession contracts. While it informs the
public of NPS' view that concessioners are not entitled to
take advantage of the provisions of the CDA, nothing in the

538US2 Unit: $U59 [10-27-04 17:07:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
regulation prevents concessioners from following the procedures set forth in the CDA once a dispute over a concession
contract actually arises. And it appears that, notwithstanding $ 51.3, the IBCA has been quite willing to apply the CDA
to certain concession contracts. Watch Hill Concessions,
Inc., 01-1 B. C. A., || 31298, pp. 154520-154521 (IBCA 2001)
(concluding that concession contract was subject to the CDA
despite the contrary language in $ 51.3).

Petitioner contends that delaying judicial resolution of this
issue will result in real harm because the applicability vel
non of the CDA is one of the factors a concessioner takes into
account when preparing its bid for NPS concession contracts.
See Supplemental Brief for Petitioner 4-6. Petitioner's argument appears to be that mere uncertainty as to the validity of a legal rule constitutes a hardship for purposes of the
ripeness analysis. We are not persuaded. If we were to
follow petitioner's logic, courts would soon be overwhelmed
with requests for what essentially would be advisory opinions because most business transactions could be priced
more accurately if even a small portion of existing legal uncertainties were resolved.4 In short, petitioner has failed

4 Petitioner notes that its complaint challenged not only the regulation
but also two specific prospectuses issued by NPS in late 2000. Thus, petitioner argues, even if the first challenge is not ripe, the latter two are
reviewable under the Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1491(b)(1). See Supplemental Brief for Petitioner 6-8. Petitioner did not seek certiorari review
on these issues; accordingly, we decline to consider them. See this Court's
Rule 14.1(a); Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 535-536 (1992).

Similarly, Justice Breyer's reliance on the Tucker Act to show that
the hardship requirement of Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S.
136 (1967), has been satisfied, see post, at 820-821 (dissenting opinion), is
misplaced. The fact that one "congressional statute" authorizes "immediate judicial relief from [certain types of] agency determinations," post, at
820, says nothing about whether "immediate judicial review" is advisable
for challenges brought against other types of agency actions based on a
different statute.

to demonstrate that deferring judicial review will result inreal hardship.

We consider next whether the issue in this case is fit forreview. Although the question presented here is "a purely
legal one" and $ 51.3 constitutes "final agency action" withinthe meaning of $ 10 of the APA, 5 U. S. C. $ 704, Abbott Laboratories, supra, at 149, we nevertheless believe that furtherfactual development would "significantly advance our ability
to deal with the legal issues presented," Duke Power Co. v.
Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., 438 U. S. 59, 82(1978); accord, Ohio Forestry Assn., Inc., 523 U. S., at 736-

737; Toilet Goods Assn., supra, at 163. While the federalrespondents generally argue that NPS was correct to conclude that the CDA does not cover concession contracts, theyacknowledge that certain types of concession contracts might
come under the broad language of the CDA. Brief for Fed-eral Respondents 33-34. Similarly, while petitioner and respondent Xanterra Parks & Resorts, LLC, present a facialchallenge to $ 51.3, both rely on specific characteristics of certain types of concession contracts to support their positions.See Brief for Petitioner 21-23, 36; Brief for Respondent
Xanterra Parks & Resorts, LLC, 20, 22. In light of the fore-going, we conclude that judicial resolution of the question
presented here should await a concrete dispute about a par-ticular concession contract.

For the reasons stated above, we vacate the judgment ofthe Court of Appeals insofar as it addressed the validity of

$ 51.3 and remand the case with instructions to dismiss thecase with respect to this issue.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, concurring in the judgment.
Petitioner seeks this Court's resolution of the straightfor-ward legal question whether the Contract Disputes Act of

538US2 Unit: $U59 [10-27-04 17:07:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

813Cite as: 538 U. S. 803 (2003)
Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
1978 (CDA), 41 U. S. C. $ 601 et seq., applies to concession
contracts with the National Park Service. Though this
question is one that would otherwise be appropriate for this
Court to decide, in my view petitioner has not satisfied
the threshold requirement of alleging sufficient injury to invoke federal-court jurisdiction. If such allegations of injury
were present, however, this case would not raise any of the
concerns that the ripeness doctrine was designed to avoid.

I
The CDA provides certain significant protections for private parties contracting with federal agencies. It authorizes de novo review of a contractor's disputed decision, payment of prejudgment interest if a dispute with the agency is
resolved in the contractor's favor, and expedited procedures
for resolving minor disputes. $$ 607-612. The value to
contractors of these protections has not been quantified in
this case, but the protections are unquestionably significant.

Ever since the enactment of the CDA in 1978, the National
Park Service has insisted that the statute does not apply
to contracts with concessionaires who operate restaurants,
lodges, and gift shops in the national parks. See, e. g., Lodging of Federal Respondents 1. In its view, the statute applies to Government contracts involving the procurement of
goods or services that the Government agrees to pay for, not
to licenses issued by the Government to concessionaires who
sell goods and services to the public. After the enactment
of the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998, 16
U. S. C. $$ 5951-5966, the Park Service issued a regulation
restating that position. 36 CFR $ 51.3 (2002). There is
nothing tentative or inconclusive about the agency's position.
The promulgation of the regulation indicated that the agency
had determined that a clear statement of its interpretation
of the CDA would be useful to potential concessionaires bidding for future contracts. Under the Park Service's view,

nearly 600 concession contracts in 131 national parks fall out-side of the CDA. Lodging of Federal Respondents 6.

Petitioner is a trade association whose members are par-ties to such contracts and periodically enter into negotiations
for future contracts. They are undisputedly interested inknowing whether disputes that are sure to arise under some
of those contracts will be resolved pursuant to the CDA pro-cedures or the less favorable procedures that will apply if
the Park Service regulation is valid.

II
In our leading case discussing the "ripeness doctrine" weexplained that the question whether a controversy is "ripe"

for judicial resolution has a "twofold aspect, requiring us toevaluate both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision
and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consid-eration." Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136,
148-149 (1967). Both aspects of the inquiry involve the ex-ercise of judgment, rather than the application of a blackletter rule.The first aspect is the more important and it is satisfied in
this case. The CDA applies to any express or implied con-tract for the procurement of property, services, or construction. 41 U. S. C. $ 602(a). In the view of the Park Service,a procurement contract is one that obligates the Government
to pay for goods and services that it receives, whereas con-cession contracts authorize third parties to provide services
to park area visitors. Petitioner, on the other hand, arguesthat the contracts provide for the performance of services
that discharge a public duty even though the Governmentdoes not pay the concessionaires. Whichever view may better reflect the intent of the Congress that enacted the CDA,it is perfectly clear that this question of statutory interpretation is as "fit" for judicial decision today as it will ever be.Even if there may be a few marginal cases in which the applicability of the CDA may depend on unique facts, the regula538US2 Unit: $U59 [10-27-04 17:07:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN

815Cite as: 538 U. S. 803 (2003)
Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
tion's blanket exclusion of concession contracts is either acorrect or an incorrect interpretation of the statute. The

issue has been fully briefed and argued and, in my judgment,is ripe for decision.

The second aspect of the ripeness inquiry is less clear andless important. If there were reason to believe that further
development of the facts would clarify the legal question, orthat the agency's view was tentative or apt to be modified,
only a strong showing of hardship to the parties would jus-tify a prompt decision. In this case, it is probably correct
that the hardship associated with a delayed decision is mini-mal. On the other hand, as the Park Service's decision to
promulgate the regulation demonstrates, eliminating thepresent uncertainty about the applicable dispute resolution
procedures will provide a benefit for all interested parties.If petitioner had alleged sufficient injury arising from the
Park Service's position, I would favor the exercise of ourdiscretion to consider the case ripe for decision. Because
such an allegation of injury is absent, however, petitionerdoes not have standing to have this claim adjudicated.

III
To establish an Article III case or controversy, a litigantmust establish that he has "standing."

Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149, 155 (1990). To have standing, a "plaintiffmust allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressedby the requested relief." Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751
(1984). This requirement specifically applies to parties chal-lenging the validity of administrative regulations. See Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727, 735 (1972).In the complaint filed in the District Court, petitioner alleged that the resolution of the merits of its dispute over thevalidity of the Park Service regulation was important, but it
failed to allege that the existence of the regulation hadcaused any injury to it or to its members:

DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment

"The applicability of the CDA to concession contractsis important to concessioners because NPS concession

contracts are of lengthy duration, often require signifi-cant upfront financial commitments, and by their terms
provide the agency with broad unilateral discretion toalter many aspects of those contracts over time. The
unlawful decision by the NPS to exempt itself from theCDA is thus of great importance to the contract solicitation process." App. 22.
At oral argument, counsel reiterated that the resolution ofthis question was "important" and that concessionaires

"need to know now, in terms of deciding whether to bid oncertain contracts, what their rights are under those contracts." Tr. of Oral Arg. 7-8. After argument, when askedto brief the issue of ripeness, petitioner stated that its members "need to know before a dispute arises--and in fact, be-fore deciding whether to bid on a concessions contract--what
procedural mechanisms will apply to contractual disputes,"and that "the prices at which concessioners `compete for
Government contract business' would be directly affected."Supplemental Brief for Petitioner 1, 5 (citations omitted). It
is fair to infer from the record before us, however, that peti-tioner's members have bid on, and been awarded, numerous
contracts without having the benefit of a definitive answerto the important legal question that their complaint has
identified.Neither in its complaint in the District Court nor in its
briefing or argument before this Court has petitioner identi-fied a specific incident in which the Park Service's regulation
caused a concessionaire to refuse to bid on a contract, to mod-ify its bid, or to suffer any other specific injury. Rather,
petitioner has focused entirely on the importance of knowingwhether the Park Service's position is valid. While it is no
doubt important for petitioner and its members to know asmuch as possible about the future of their business transactions, importance does not necessarily establish injury.

Breyer, J., dissenting
Though some of petitioner's members may well have sufferedsome sort of injury from the Park Service's regulation, neither the allegations of the complaint nor the evidence in therecord identifies any specific injury that would be redressed
by a favorable decision on the merits of the case. Accord-ingly, petitioner has no standing to pursue its claim.

For this reason, I concur in the Court's judgment.
Justice Breyer, with whom Justice O'Connor joins,dissenting.

Like the majority, I believe that petitioner National ParkHospitality Association has standing here to pursue its legal
claim, namely, that the dispute resolution procedures setforth in the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (CDA), 41 U. S. C.

$ 601 et seq., apply to national park concession contracts.But, unlike the majority, I believe that the question is ripe
for our consideration.I cannot agree with

Justice Stevens that petitionerlacks Article III standing to bring suit on behalf of its members. See ante, at 815-816 and this page (opinion concur-ring in judgment). In my view, the National Park Service's
definition of "concession contract" to exclude the CDA's protections (a definition embodied in the regulation about whichpetitioner complains, see 36 CFR $ 51.3 (2002)) causes petitioner and its members "injury in fact." Lujan v. Defenders
of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992) (discussing requirements of "injury in fact," causation, and redressability); seealso

Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm'n,
432 U. S. 333, 343 (1977) (association's standing based on in-jury to a member).

For one thing, many of petitioner's members are partiesto, as well as potential bidders for, park concession contracts.
Lodging for Federal Respondents 6 (listing 590 concessioncontracts in 131 parks). Those members will likely find that
disputes arise under the contracts. And in resolving such
disputes, the Park Service, following its regulation, will re538US2 Unit: $U59 [10-27-04 17:07:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ject the concessioners' entitlement to the significant protec-tions or financial advantages that the CDA provides. See

41 U. S. C. $$ 605-612; ante, at 813-814 (Stevens, J., concur-ring in judgment). In the circumstances present here, that
kind of injury, though a future one, is concrete and likelyto occur.

For another thing, the challenged Park Service interpretation causes a present injury. If the CDA does not applyto concession contract disagreements, as the Park Service

regulation declares, then some of petitioner's members mustplan now for higher contract implementation costs. Given
the agency's regulation, bidders will likely be forced to pay
more to obtain, or to retain, a concession contract than they
believe the contract is worth. That is what petitioner argues. Supplemental Brief for Petitioner 4-6. See also
App. to Supplemental Brief for Petitioner 3a-4a. Certain
general allegations in the underlying complaints support this
claim. See, e. g., App. 20-22, |||| 35, 61-67; Amfac Resorts,
L. L. C. Complaint in No. 1:00CV02838 (DC), pp. 4-5, || 8
(available in Clerk of Court's case file); id., at 31-33, |||| 102-
111. Cf. Amfac Resorts, L. L. C. v. United States Dept. of
Interior, 282 F. 3d 818, 830 (CADC 2002). And several uncontested circumstances indicate that such allegations are
likely to prove true.

First, as the record makes clear, petitioner has a widespread membership, and many of its members regularly bid
on contracts that, through cross-references to the Park Service regulation, embody the Park Service's interpretation.
See, e. g., App. 69, 80; Lodging for Federal Respondents 14,
25. See also Standard Concession Contract, 65 Fed. Reg.

id., at 44898, 44899-44900, 44910, 44912. Second, related
contract solicitations are similarly widespread and recurring,
involving numerous bidders. Third, after investigation, the
relevant congressional committee found that the "way potential contractors view the disputes-resolving system influ538US2 Unit: $U59 [10-27-04 17:07:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ences how, whether, and at what prices they compete forgovernment contract business." S. Rep. No. 95-1118, p. 4

(1978). Fourth, the CDA provides a prevailing contractorwith prejudgment interest, and authorizes expedited procedures. 41 U. S. C. $$ 607(f ), 608, 611. These are factorsthat make the inapplicability of the CDA more costly to successful bidders. See S. Rep. No. 95-1118, at 2-4; ante, at
813-814 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).These circumstances make clear that petitioner's members

will likely suffer a concrete monetary harm, either now or inthe foreseeable future. Such a showing here is sufficient
to satisfy the Constitution's standing requirements. And
the threatened injuries, present and future--monetary
harm, injuries to a potential or actual contractual relationship, and injuries that arguably fall within the CDA's protective scope--are sufficient to satisfy "prudential" standing
requirements as well. Federal Election Comm'n v. Akins,
524 U. S. 11, 19-20 (1998); Association of Data Processing
Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U. S. 150, 153
(1970). Cf. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. United
States, 316 U. S. 407, 421-422 (1942).

Given this threat of immediate concrete harm (primarily
in the form of increased bidding costs), this case is also ripe
for judicial review. As Justice Stevens explains in Parts
I and II of his opinion, the case now presents a legal issue--
the applicability of the CDA to concession contracts--that is
fit for judicial determination. That issue is a purely legal
one, demanding for its resolution only use of ordinary judicial
interpretive techniques. See ante, at 814-815 (opinion concurring in judgment). The relevant administrative action,
i. e., the agency's definition of "concession contract" under
the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998, 16
U. S. C. $$ 5951-5966, has been "formalized," Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 148 (1967). It is embodied
in an interpretive regulation issued after notice and public
comment and pursuant to the Department of the Interior's

formal delegation to the National Park Service of its ownstatutorily granted rulemaking authority, $ 5965;

ante, at
806-807. (Unlike the majority, I would apply to the regula-tion the legal label "interpretive rule," not "general statement of policy," ante, at 809 (internal quotation marks andalteration omitted), though I agree with the majority that,
because the Park Service does not administer the CDA, see
ibid., we owe its conclusion less deference.) The Park Serv-ice's interpretation is definite and conclusive, not tentative or

likely to change; as the majority concedes, the Park Service'sdetermination constitutes "final agency action" within the
meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act. Ante, at 812
(internal quotation marks omitted).

The only open question concerns the nature of the harm
that refusing judicial review at this time will cause petitioner's members. See Abbott Laboratories, supra, at 149.
The fact that concessioners can raise the legal question at a
later time, after a specific contractual dispute arises, see
ante, at 812, militates against finding this case ripe. So too
does a precedential concern: Will present review set a precedent that leads to premature challenges in other cases where
agency interpretations may be less formal, less final, or less
well suited to immediate judicial determination? See ante,
at 811-812.

But the fact of immediate and particularized (and not totally reparable) injury during the bidding process offsets the
first of these considerations. And the second is more than
offset by a related congressional statute that specifies that
prospective bidders for Government contracts can obtain
immediate judicial relief from agency determinations that
unlawfully threaten precisely this kind of harm. See 28
U. S. C. $ 1491(b)(1) (allowing prospective bidder to object,
for instance, to "solicitation by a Federal agency for bids . . .
for a proposed contract" and permitting review of related
allegation of "any . . . violation of statute or regulation in
connection with a procurement or a proposed procurement").

See also R. Nash, S. Schooner, & K. O'Brien, The Govern-ment Contracts Reference Book 308, 423 (2d ed. 1998). This

statute authorizes a potential bidder to complain of a pro-posed contractual term that, in the bidder's view, is unlawful,
say, because it formally incorporates a regulation that em-bodies a specific, allegedly unlawful, remedial requirement.
Cf. App. 25, |||| 114-116 (excerpts from petitioner's complaintmaking just this claim); App. to Supplemental Brief for Petitioner 2a, |||| 121-122 (same). That being so, i. e., the pres-ent injury in such a case being identical to the present injury
at issue here, I can find no convincing prudential reason towithhold Administrative Procedure Act review.

In sum, given this congressional policy, the concrete na-ture of the injury asserted by petitioner, and the final nature
of the agency action at issue, I see no good reason to post-pone review. I would find the issue ripe for this Court's
consideration. And I would affirm the decision of the Courtof Appeals on the merits, primarily for the reasons set forth
in its opinion as supplemented here by the Government.

BLACK & DECKER DISABILITY PLAN v. NORD
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 02-469. Argued April 28, 2003--Decided May 27, 2003
Petitioner Black & Decker Disability Plan (Plan), an employee welfare

benefit plan governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 (ERISA), provides benefits for eligible disabled employees
of Black & Decker Corporation (Black & Decker) and certain of its subsidiaries. Black & Decker is the administrator of the Plan but has delegated authority to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife) to
render initial recommendations on benefit claims. Respondent Nord,
an employee of a Black & Decker subsidiary, submitted a claim for disability benefits under the Plan, which MetLife denied. At MetLife's
review stage, Nord submitted letters and supporting documentation
from his physician, Dr. Hartman, and a treating orthopedist to whom
Hartman had referred Nord. These treating physicians stated that
Nord suffered from a degenerative disc disease and chronic pain that
rendered him unable to work. Black & Decker referred Nord to a neurologist for an independent examination. The neurologist concluded
that, aided by pain medication, Nord could perform sedentary work.
MetLife thereafter made a final recommendation to deny Nord's claim,
which Black & Decker accepted. Seeking to overturn that determination, Nord filed this action under ERISA. The District Court granted
summary judgment for the Plan, concluding that Black & Decker's denial of Nord's claim was not an abuse of the plan administrator's discretion. The Ninth Circuit reversed and itself granted summary judgment
for Nord. The Court of Appeals explained that the case was controlled
by a recent Ninth Circuit decision holding that, when making benefit
determinations, ERISA plan administrators must follow a "treating
physician rule." As described by the appeals court, that rule required
a plan administrator who rejects the opinions of a claimant's treating
physician to come forward with specific reasons for the decision, based
on substantial evidence in the record. The Ninth Circuit found that,
under this rule, the plan administrator had not provided adequate justification for rejecting the opinions of Nord's treating physicians.

Held: ERISA does not require plan administrators to accord special deference to the opinions of treating physicians. The "treating physician
rule" imposed by the Ninth Circuit was originally developed by Courts

of Appeals as a means to control disability determinations by administrative law judges under the Social Security Act. In 1991, the Commissioner of Social Security adopted regulations approving and formalizing
use of the rule in the Social Security disability program. Nothing in
ERISA or the Secretary of Labor's ERISA regulations, however, suggests that plan administrators must accord special deference to the opinions of treating physicians, or imposes a heightened burden of explanation on administrators when they reject a treating physician's opinion.
If the Secretary found it meet to adopt a treating physician rule by
regulation, courts would examine that determination with appropriate
deference. See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense
Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837. But the Secretary has not chosen that
course and an amicus brief reflecting the Department of Labor's position opposes adoption of such a rule for disability determinations under
plans covered by ERISA. Whether a treating physician rule would
increase the accuracy of ERISA disability determinations, as the Ninth
Circuit believed it would, is a question that the Legislature or superintending administrative agency is best positioned to address. Finally,
and of prime importance, critical differences between the Social Security disability program and ERISA benefit plans caution against importing a treating physician rule from the former area into the latter. By
accepting and codifying such a rule, the Social Security Commissioner
sought to serve the need for efficient administration of an obligatory
nationwide benefits program. In contrast, nothing in ERISA requires
employers to establish employee benefits plans or mandates what kind
of benefits employers must provide if they choose to have such a plan.
Lockheed Corp. v. Spink, 517 U. S. 882, 887. Rather, employers have
large leeway to design disability and other welfare plans as they see fit.
In determining entitlement to Social Security benefits, the adjudicator
measures the claimant's condition against a uniform set of federal criteria. The validity of a claim to benefits under an ERISA plan, on the
other hand, is likely to turn, in large part, on the interpretation of terms
in the plan at issue. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U. S.
101, 115. Deference is due the Labor Secretary's stated view that
ERISA is best served by preserving the greatest flexibility possible
for operating claims processing systems consistent with a plan's prudent administration. Plan administrators may not arbitrarily refuse to
credit a claimant's reliable evidence, including the opinions of a treating
physician. But courts have no warrant to require administrators automatically to accord special weight to the opinions of a claimant's phy538US2 Unit: $U60 [10-27-04 17:16:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
Under a rule adopted by the Commissioner of Social Security, in determining whether a claimant is entitled to Social
Security disability benefits, special weight is accorded opinions of the claimant's treating physician. See 20 CFR

$$ 404.1527(d)(2), 416.927(d)(2) (2002). This case presents
the question whether a similar "treating physician rule" applies to disability determinations under employee benefits
plans covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 (ERISA or Act), 88 Stat. 832, as amended, 29
U. S. C. $ 1001 et seq. We hold that plan administrators are
not obliged to accord special deference to the opinions of
treating physicians.

ERISA and the Secretary of Labor's regulations under the
Act require "full and fair" assessment of claims and clear
communication to the claimant of the "specific reasons" for
benefit denials. See 29 U. S. C. $ 1133; 29 CFR $ 2560.503-1
(2002). But these measures do not command plan administrators to credit the opinions of treating physicians over
other evidence relevant to the claimant's medical condition.
Because the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit erroneously applied a "treating physician rule" to a disability plan
governed by ERISA, we vacate that court's judgment and
remand for further proceedings.

Petitioner Black & Decker Disability Plan (Plan), an
ERISA-governed employee welfare benefit plan, covers employees of Black & Decker Corporation (Black & Decker) and
certain of its subsidiaries. The Plan provides benefits for
eligible employees with a "disability." As relevant here, the
Plan defines "disability" to mean "the complete inability . . .
of a Participant to engage in his regular occupation with

the Employer." 1 296 F. 3d 823, 826, n. 2 (CA9 2002).Black & Decker both funds the Plan and acts as plan administrator, but it has delegated authority to Metropolitan LifeInsurance Company (MetLife) to render initial recommendations on benefit claims. Disability determinations, theBlack & Decker Plan provides, "[are to] be made by the [plan
administrator] based on suitable medical evidence and a re-view of the Participant's employment history that the [plan
administrator] deems satisfactory in its sole and absolute dis-cretion."

Id., at 826, n. 1.Respondent Kenneth L. Nord was formerly employed by

a Black & Decker subsidiary as a material planner. His job,classed "sedentary," required up to six hours of sitting and
two hours of standing or walking per day. Id., at 826.In 1997, Nord consulted Dr. Leo Hartman about hip and
back pain. Dr. Hartman determined that Nord suffers froma mild degenerative disc disease, a diagnosis confirmed by a
Magnetic Resonance Imaging scan. After a week's trial onpain medication prescribed by Dr. Hartman, Nord's condition
remained unimproved. Dr. Hartman told Nord to ceasework temporarily, and recommended that he consult an orthopedist while continuing to take the pain medication.Nord submitted a claim for disability benefits under the
Plan, which MetLife denied in February 1998. Nord nextexercised his right to seek further consideration by MetLife's "Group Claims Review." Id., at 827. At that stage,Nord submitted letters and supporting documentation from
Dr. Hartman and a treating orthopedist to whom Hartmanhad referred Nord. Nord also submitted a questionnaire
form, drafted by Nord's counsel, headed "Work CapacityEvaluation." Black & Decker human resources representa1 The Plan sets out a different standard for determining whether an
employee is entitled to benefits for a period longer than 30 months. Because respondent Nord sought benefits "for up to 30 months," 296 F. 3d
823, 826 (CA9 2002), the standard for longer term disability is not in play
in this case.

tive Janmarie Forward answered the questions, as the forminstructed, by the single word "yes" or "no." One of the six

items composing the "Work Capacity Evaluation" directedForward to "[a]ssume that Kenneth Nord would have a moderate pain that would interfere with his ability to performintense interpersonal communications or to act appropriately
under stress occasionally (up to one-third) during the day."
Lodging for Pet. for Cert. L-37. The associated questionasked whether an "individual of those limitations [could]

perform the work of a material planner." Ibid. Forwardmarked a space labeled "no."

During the MetLife review process, Black & Decker referred Nord to neurologist Antoine Mitri for an independent
examination. Dr. Mitri agreed with Nord's doctors that
Nord suffered from a degenerative disc disease and chronic
pain. But aided by pain medication, Dr. Mitri concluded,
Nord could perform "sedentary work with some walking interruption in between." Id., at L-45. MetLife thereafter
made a final recommendation to deny Nord's claim.

Black & Decker accepted MetLife's recommendation and,
on October 27, 1998, so informed Nord. The notification letter summarized the conclusions of Nord's doctors, the results
of diagnostic tests, and the opinion of Dr. Mitri. See id., at
L-155 to L-156. It also recounted that Black & Decker had
forwarded Dr. Mitri's report to Nord's counsel with a request
for comment by Nord's attending physician. Although Nord
had submitted additional information, the letter continued,
he had "provided . . . no new or different information that
would change [MetLife's] original decision." Id., at L-156.
The letter further stated that the Work Capacity Evaluation
form completed by Black & Decker human resources representative Forward was "not sufficient to reverse [the Plan's]
decision." Ibid.

Seeking to overturn Black & Decker's determination,
Nord filed this action in Federal District Court "to recover
benefits due to him under the terms of his plan." 29 U. S. C.

828 BLACK & DECKER DISABILITY PLAN v. NORD

Opinion of the Court

$ 1132(a)(1)(B). On cross-motions for summary judgment,the District Court granted judgment for the Plan, concluding

that Black & Decker's denial of Nord's claim was not anabuse of the plan administrator's discretion.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit roundly re-versed and itself "grant[ed] Nord's motion for summary judgment." 296 F. 3d, at 832. Nord's appeal, the Ninth Circuit
explained, was controlled by that court's recent decision in
Regula v. Delta Family-Care Disability Survivorship Plan,
266 F. 3d 1130 (2001). 296 F. 3d, at 829. The Ninth Circuithad held in

Regula that, when making benefit determinations, ERISA plan administrators must follow a "treating
physician rule." See 266 F. 3d, at 1139-1144. As described
by the appeals court, the rule required an administrator
"who rejects [the] opinions [of a claimant's treating physician]
to come forward with specific reasons for his decision, based
on substantial evidence in the record." Id., at 1139. Declaring that Nord was entitled to judgment as a matter of
law, the Ninth Circuit emphasized that Black & Decker fell
short under the treating physician rule: The plan administrator had not provided adequate justification, the Court of Appeals said, for rejecting opinions held by Dr. Hartman and
others treating Nord on Hartman's recommendation. 296
F. 3d, at 830-832.

We granted certiorari, 537 U. S. 1098 (2002), in view of
the division among the Circuits on the propriety of judicial
installation of a treating physician rule for disability claims
within ERISA's domain. Compare Regula, 266 F. 3d, at
1139; Donaho v. FMC Corp., 74 F. 3d 894, 901 (CA8 1996),

treating physician rule should govern ERISA cases). Con-cluding that courts have no warrant to order application of

a treating physician rule to employee benefit claims madeunder ERISA, we vacate the Ninth Circuit's judgment and
remand the case for further proceedings.2

II
The treating physician rule at issue here was originallydeveloped by Courts of Appeals as a means to control disability determinations by administrative law judges under theSocial Security Act, 49 Stat. 620, 42 U. S. C. $ 231 et seq. See
Maccaro, The Treating Physician Rule and the Adjudicationof Claims for Social Security Disability Benefits, 41 Soc. Sec.
Rep. Serv. 833, 833-834 (1993). In 1991, the Commissionerof Social Security adopted regulations approving and formalizing use of the rule in the Social Security disability pro-gram. See 56 Fed. Reg. 36961, 36968 (codified at 20 CFR

$$ 404.1527(d)(2), 416.927(d)(2) (2002)). The Social SecurityAdministration, the regulations inform, will generally "give
more weight to opinions from . . . treating sources," and "willalways give good reasons in our notice of determination or
decision for the weight we give your treating source's opin-ion." $$ 404.1527(d)(2), 416.927(d)(2).

Concluding that a treating physician rule should similarlygovern private benefit plans under ERISA, the Ninth Circuit
said in Regula that its "reasons ha[d] to do with commonsense as well as consistency in [ judicial] review of disability
determinations where benefits are protected by federal law."266 F. 3d, at 1139. "Just as in the Social Security context,"
the court observed, "the disputed issue in ERISA disabilitydeterminations concerns whether the facts of the beneficiary's case entitle him to benefits." Ibid. The Ninth Circuit

perceived "no reason why the treating physician rule should

"ERISA was enacted to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefit plans, and to
protect contractually defined benefits." Firestone Tire &
Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U. S. 101, 113 (1989) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The Act furthers these
aims in part by regulating the manner in which plans process
benefits claims. Plans must "provide adequate notice in
writing to any participant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the plan has been denied, setting forth the specific
reasons for such denial, written in a manner calculated to
be understood by the participant." 29 U. S. C. $ 1133(1).
ERISA further requires that plan procedures "afford a rea3 The treating physician rule has not attracted universal adherence outside the Social Security context. Some courts have approved a rule similar to the Social Security Commissioner's for disability determinations
under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 33 U. S. C.

$ 901 et seq., see, e. g., Pietrunti v. Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, 119 F. 3d 1035, 1042 (CA2 1997), and the Secretary of
Labor has adopted a version of the rule for benefit determinations under
the Black Lung Benefits Act, 30 U. S. C. $ 901 et seq., see 20 CFR

$ 718.104(d)(5) (2002). One Court of Appeals, however, has rejected a
treating physician rule for the assessment of claims of entitlement to veterans' benefits for service-connected disabilities, see White v. Principi,
243 F. 3d 1378, 1381 (CA Fed. 2001), and another has rejected such a rule
for disability determinations under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974,
45 U. S. C. $ 231 et seq., see Dray v. Railroad Retirement Bd., 10 F. 3d
1306, 1311 (CA7 1993). Furthermore, there appears to be no uniform
practice regarding application of a treating physician rule under state
workers' compensation statutes. See Conradt v. Mt. Carmel School, 197
Wis. 2d 60, 69, 539 N. W. 2d 713, 717 (Ct. App. 1995) ("Conradt misrepresents the state of the law when she claims that a majority of states have
adopted the `treating physician rule.' ").

sonable opportunity . . . for a full and fair review" of disposi-tions adverse to the claimant. $ 1133(2). Nothing in the

Act itself, however, suggests that plan administrators mustaccord special deference to the opinions of treating physicians. Nor does the Act impose a heightened burden of ex-planation on administrators when they reject a treating physician's opinion.

ERISA empowers the Secretary of Labor to "prescribesuch regulations as he finds necessary or appropriate to

carry out" the statutory provisions securing employee bene-fit rights. $ 1135; see $ 1133 (plans shall process claims "[i]n
accordance with regulations of the Secretary"). The Secretary's regulations do not instruct plan administrators to accord extra respect to treating physicians' opinions. See 29
CFR $ 2560.503-1 (1997) (regulations in effect when Nord
filed his claim); 29 CFR $ 2560.503-1 (2002) (current regulations). Notably, the most recent version of the Secretary's
regulations, which installs no treating physician rule, issued
more than nine years after the Social Security Administration codified a treating physician rule in that agency's regulations. Compare 56 Fed. Reg. 36932, 36961 (1991), with 65
Fed. Reg. 70265 (2000).

If the Secretary of Labor found it meet to adopt a treating physician rule by regulation, courts would examine that
determination with appropriate deference. See Chevron
U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467
U. S. 837 (1984). The Secretary has not chosen that course,
however, and an amicus brief reflecting the position of the
Department of Labor opposes adoption of such a rule for
disability determinations under plans covered by ERISA.
See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 7-27. Although Congress "expect[ed]" courts would develop "a federal common law of rights and obligations under ERISAregulated plans," Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S.
41, 56 (1987), the scope of permissible judicial innovation is
narrower in areas where other federal actors are engaged,

nuisance action against the city based on the latter's pollu-tion of Lake Michigan).

The question whether a treating physician rule would "increas[e] the accuracy of disability determinations" underERISA plans, as the Ninth Circuit believed it would,

Regula,
266 F. 3d, at 1139, moreover, seems to us one the Legislatureor superintending administrative agency is best positioned

to address. As compared to consultants retained by a plan,
it may be true that treating physicians, as a rule, "ha[ve] a
greater opportunity to know and observe the patient as an
individual." Ibid. (internal quotation marks and citation
omitted). Nor do we question the Court of Appeals' concern
that physicians repeatedly retained by benefits plans may
have an "incentive to make a finding of `not disabled' in order
to save their employers money and to preserve their own
consulting arrangements." Id., at 1143. But the assumption that the opinions of a treating physician warrant greater
credit than the opinions of plan consultants may make scant
sense when, for example, the relationship between the claimant and the treating physician has been of short duration, or
when a specialist engaged by the plan has expertise the
treating physician lacks. And if a consultant engaged by a
plan may have an "incentive" to make a finding of "not disabled," so a treating physician, in a close case, may favor a
finding of "disabled." Intelligent resolution of the question
whether routine deference to the opinion of a claimant's
treating physician would yield more accurate disability determinations, it thus appears, might be aided by empirical
investigation of the kind courts are ill equipped to conduct.

Finally, and of prime importance, critical differences between the Social Security disability program and ERISA
benefit plans caution against importing a treating physician

rule from the former area into the latter. The Social Se-curity Act creates a nationwide benefits program funded

by Federal Insurance Contributions Act payments, see 26U. S. C. $$ 3101(a), 3111(a), and superintended by the Commissioner of Social Security. To cope with the "more than2.5 million claims for disability benefits [filed] each year,"
Cleveland v. Policy Management Systems Corp., 526 U. S.
795, 803 (1999), the Commissioner has published detailed reg-ulations governing benefits adjudications. See,

e. g., id., at
803-804. Presumptions employed in the Commissioner'sregulations "grow out of the need to administer a large benefits system efficiently." Id., at 804. By accepting and codifying a treating physician rule, the Commissioner sought to
serve that need. Along with other regulations, the treating
physician rule works to foster uniformity and regularity in
Social Security benefits determinations made in the first instance by a corps of administrative law judges.

In contrast to the obligatory, nationwide Social Security
program, "[n]othing in ERISA requires employers to establish employee benefits plans. Nor does ERISA mandate
what kind of benefits employers must provide if they choose
to have such a plan." Lockheed Corp. v. Spink, 517 U. S.
882, 887 (1996). Rather, employers have large leeway to design disability and other welfare plans as they see fit. In
determining entitlement to Social Security benefits, the adjudicator measures the claimant's condition against a uniform
set of federal criteria. "[T]he validity of a claim to benefits
under an ERISA plan," on the other hand, "is likely to turn,"
in large part, "on the interpretation of terms in the plan at
issue." Firestone Tire, 489 U. S., at 115. It is the Secretary of Labor's view that ERISA is best served by "preserv[ing] the greatest flexibility possible for . . . operating claims

Opinion of the Court
(available in Clerk of Court's case file). Deference is duethat view.

Plan administrators, of course, may not arbitrarily refuseto credit a claimant's reliable evidence, including the opinions
of a treating physician. But, we hold, courts have no war-rant to require administrators automatically to accord special
weight to the opinions of a claimant's physician; nor maycourts impose on plan administrators a discrete burden of
explanation when they credit reliable evidence that conflictswith a treating physician's evaluation.

4 The Court of Appeals therefore erred when it employed a treating physicianrule lacking Department of Labor endorsement in holding

that Nord was entitled to summary judgment.

* * *
For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United StatesCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is vacated, and the

case is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.

It is so ordered.

4 Nord asserts that there are two treating physician rules: a "procedural" rule, which requires a hearing officer to explain why she rejected
the opinions of a treating physician, and a "substantive" rule, which requires that "more weight" be given to the medical opinions of a treating
physician. Brief for Respondent 12-13 (internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, Nord contends, the Court of Appeals applied only the
"procedural" version of the rule. Id., at 13. We are not certain that
Nord's reading of the Court of Appeals decision is correct. See 296 F. 3d,
at 831 (faulting the Plan for, inter alia, having "[n]o evidence . . . that
Nord's treating physicians considered inappropriate factors in making
their diagnosis or that Nord's physicians lacked the requisite expertise to
draw their medical conclusions"). At any rate, for the reasons explained
in this opinion, we conclude that ERISA does not support judicial imposition of a treating physician rule, whether labeled "procedural" or
"substantive."

835OCTOBER TERM, 2002
Syllabus

BUNKLEY v. FLORIDA
on petition for writ of certiorari to the supremecourt of florida

No. 02-8636. Decided May 27, 2003
Petitioner Bunkley had a pocketknife with a 21/2- to 3-inch blade in his

pocket when he was arrested as he left an unoccupied restaurant. He
was charged with first-degree burglary because his knife was classified
as a "dangerous weapon" under Florida law, was convicted, and was
sentenced to life in prison. Had the pocketknife not been so classified,
his sentence could have been no more than five years. His conviction
became final in 1989. Florida has exempted the "common pocketknife"
from its weapons statute since 1901, and the relevant language has remained unchanged. In 1997, in a separate case, the Florida Supreme
Court interpreted the meaning of the "common pocketknife" exception
for the first time, including a pocketknife with a 33/4-inch blade within
the exception. L. B. v. State, 700 So. 2d 370, 373. Bunkley then moved
for state postconviction relief, alleging that his armed robbery conviction was invalid under L. B. because his pocketknife was shorter than
33/4 inches and could not therefore support a conviction involving
weapon possession. The Circuit Court denied his motion, and the State
District Court of Appeal affirmed. The State Supreme Court rejected
Bunkley's claim, holding that L. B. was an evolutionary refinement in
the law that did not apply retroactively.

Held: The Florida Supreme Court erred in failing to determine whether

the "common pocketknife" exception encompassed Bunkley's pocketknife at the time his conviction became final. The result here is controlled by Fiore v. White, 531 U. S. 225, which involved a Pennsylvania
criminal statute that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court interpreted for
the first time after Fiore's conviction had already become final. Under
that interpretation, Fiore's conduct did not violate an element of the
statute. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court's reply to this Court's certified question--that its interpretation merely clarified the statute's plain
language--revealed that Fiore's conviction violated due process, because a State cannot convict a person without proving each element of
the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Application of Fiore's due process principles may render a retroactivity analysis unnecessary here.
Fiore requires the Florida Supreme Court to answer whether, in light
of L. B., Bunkley's 21/2- to 3-inch pocketknife fit within the state statute's
"common pocketknife" exception at the time his conviction became final.

836 BUNKLEY v. FLORIDA

Per Curiam
Because the L. B. decision cast doubt on the validity of Bunkley's conviction by interpreting the exception to cover his weapon, Fiore entitles
Bunkley to a determination whether L. B. correctly stated the law as it
stood at the time Bunkley was convicted. The Florida Supreme Court
characterized L. B. as part of a century-long evolutionary process, but
did not decide what stage the law had reached by 1989. The proper
question for purposes of Fiore is not just whether the law changed, but
when it changed. Unless and until the State Supreme Court clarifies
the exception's content in 1989, this Court cannot know whether Bunkley's conviction violates the due process principles set forth in Fiore.

Certiorari granted; 833 So. 2d 739, vacated and remanded.

Clyde Timothy Bunkley petitions for a writ of certiorari,arguing that the Florida Supreme Court contradicted the

principles of this Court's decision in Fiore v. White, 531U. S. 225 (2001) (per curiam), when it failed to determine
whether the "common pocketknife" exception to Florida'sdefinition of a " `[w]eapon' " encompassed Bunkley's pocketknife at the time that his conviction became final in 1989.Fla. Stat. $ 790.001(13) (2000). We agree, and therefore
grant Bunkley's motion to proceed in forma pauperis andhis petition for a writ of certiorari.

In the early morning hours of April 16, 1986, Bunkley bur-glarized a closed, unoccupied Western Sizzlin' Restaurant.

(per curiam). "There is no evidence indicating Bunkleyever used the pocketknife during the burglary, nor that he

threatened anyone with the pocketknife at any time." Ibid.Bunkley was charged with burglary in the first degree because he was armed with a "dangerous weapon"--namely,the pocketknife. Fla. Stat. $ 810.02(2)(b) (2000). The punishment for burglary in the first degree is "imprisonment

for a term of years not exceeding life imprisonment."$ 810.02(2). If the pocketknife had not been classified as a

"dangerous weapon," Bunkley would have been charged withburglary in the third degree. See 833 So. 2d 739, 742 (Fla.
2002). Burglary in the third degree is punishable "by aterm of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years." Fla. Stat.

$ 775.082(3)(d) (2002); see also 833 So. 2d, at 742. Bunkley
was convicted of burglary in the first degree. He was sen-tenced to life imprisonment. In 1989, a Florida appellate

court affirmed Bunkley's conviction and sentence. See 539So. 2d 477.

Florida law defines a " `[w]eapon' " to "mea[n] any dirk,metallic knuckles, slingshot, billie, tear gas gun, chemical
weapon or device, or other deadly weapon except a firearmor a common pocketknife." $ 790.001(13). Florida has excepted the " `common pocketknife' " from its weapons statutesince 1901, and the relevant language has remained unchanged since that time. See 833 So. 2d, at 743.In 1997, the Florida Supreme Court interpreted the meaning of the "common pocketknife" exception for the first time.
In L. B. v. State, 700 So. 2d 370, 373 (per curiam), the courtdetermined that a pocketknife with a blade of 3

3/4 inches

"plainly falls within the statutory exception to the definition
of `weapon' found in section 790.001(13)." The complete
analysis of the Florida Supreme Court on this issue was as
follows: "In 1951, the Attorney General of Florida opined
that a pocketknife with a blade of four inches in length or
less was a `common pocketknife.' The knife appellant carried, which had a 33/4-inch blade, clearly fell within this
range." Ibid. (citation omitted). The Florida Supreme
Court accordingly vacated the conviction in L. B. because
the "knife in question was a `common pocketknife' under any
intended definition of that term." Ibid. Justice Grimes,
joined by Justice Wells, wrote an opinion agreeing with the
majority's resolution of the case "[i]n view of the Attorney
General's opinion and the absence of a more definitive description of a common pocketknife." Ibid.

838 BUNKLEY v. FLORIDA

Per Curiam
After the Florida Supreme Court issued its decision inL. B., Bunkley filed a motion for postconviction relief under

Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850 (1999). Bunkleyalleged that under the L. B. decision, his pocketknife could
not have been considered a "weapon" under $ 790.001(13).He therefore argued that his conviction for armed burglary was invalid and should be vacated because a "commonpocketknife can not

[sic] support a conviction involvingpossession of a weapon." App. to Pet. for Cert. C-2. The

Circuit Court rejected Bunkley's motion, and the DistrictCourt of Appeal of Florida, Second District, affirmed. 768
So. 2d 510 (2000).The Florida Supreme Court also rejected Bunkley's claim.
It held that the L. B. decision did not apply retroactively.Under Florida law, only "jurisprudential upheavals" will be
applied retroactively. 833 So. 2d, at 743 (internal quotationmarks omitted). The court stated that a "jurisprudential
upheaval is a major constitutional change of law." Id., at745 (internal quotation marks omitted). By contrast, any
"evolutionary refinements" in the law "are not applied retro-actively."

Id., at 744. The court then held that L. B. wasan evolutionary refinement in the law, and therefore Bunkley

was not entitled to relief. In a footnote, the Florida Su-preme Court cited our decision in Fiore v. White, supra, and
held without analysis that Fiore did not apply to this case.See 833 So. 2d, at 744, n. 12.*

*The dissent claims that the Florida Supreme Court did not need to
decide anything other than whether L. B. was a change in the law. See
post, at 845 (citing Fla. Rule Crim. Proc. 3.850(b)(2) (2000)). Yet as the
dissent concedes, see post, at 843, the Florida Supreme Court passed upon
the Fiore due process inquiry as well as the retroactivity question. The
dissent also notes that Bunkley has raised the issue of the common pocketknife in prior appeals. These appeals, however, were filed prior to the
Florida Supreme Court's opinion in L. B. And we agree with the dissent
that absent the L. B. decision, Bunkley would not be able to pursue his
claim now. The Florida Supreme Court committed an error of law here
by not addressing whether the L. B. decision means that at the time Bunk538US2 Unit: $U61 [10-27-04 17:24:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Justice Pariente, joined by Chief Justice Anstead, dis-sented. She stated that the Florida Supreme Court's decision in L. B. "should be applied to grant Bunkley collateralrelief." 833 So. 2d, at 746. She criticized the majority opinion for relying solely on a retroactivity question. In herview, "application of the due process principles of Fiore renders a retroactivity analysis . . . unnecessary." Id., at 747.She noted that even if

L. B. was merely an evolutionary re-finement of the law, "the majority offers no precedent laying

out the stages of this evolution." 833 So. 2d, at 747. Be-cause she thought the L. B. decision "correctly stated the
law at the time Bunkley's conviction became final," shewould have vacated Bunkley's conviction. 833 So. 2d, at 747.

II
Fiore v. White involved a Pennsylvania criminal statutethat the Pennsylvania Supreme Court interpreted for the

first time after the defendant Fiore's conviction became final.See 531 U. S., at 226. Under the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court's interpretation of the criminal statute, Fiore couldnot have been guilty of the crime for which he was convicted.
See id., at 227-228. We originally granted certiorari in
Fiore to consider "when, or whether, the Federal Due Proc-ess Clause requires a State to apply a new interpretation of

a state criminal statute retroactively to cases on collateralreview." Id., at 226. "Because we were uncertain whether
the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision . . . representeda change in the law," we certified a question to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Id., at 228. This question askedwhether the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's interpretation of
the statute " `state[d] the correct interpretation of the law ofPennsylvania at the date Fiore's conviction became final.' "
Ibid.
ley was convicted, he was convicted of a crime--armed burglary--for
which he may not be guilty. Therefore, Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032
(1983), has no applicability here.

840 BUNKLEY v. FLORIDA

Per Curiam
When the Pennsylvania Supreme Court replied that theruling " `merely clarified the plain language of the statute,' "

ibid., the question on which we originally granted certioraridisappeared. Pennsylvania's answer revealed the "simple,
inevitable conclusion" that Fiore's conviction violated dueprocess.

Id., at 229. It has long been established by this
Court that "the Due Process Clause . . . forbids a State to
convict a person of a crime without proving the elementsof that crime beyond a reasonable doubt."

Id., at 228-229.
Because Pennsylvania law--as interpreted by the later StateSupreme Court decision--made clear that Fiore's conduct

did not violate an element of the statute, his conviction did
not satisfy the strictures of the Due Process Clause. Consequently, "retroactivity [was] not at issue." Id., at 226.

Fiore controls the result here. As Justice Pariente stated
in dissent, "application of the due process principles of Fiore"
may render a retroactivity analysis "unnecessary." 833
So. 2d, at 747. The question here is not just one of retroactivity. Rather, as Fiore holds, "retroactivity is not at
issue" if the Florida Supreme Court's interpretation of the
"common pocketknife" exception in L. B. is "a correct statement of the law when [Bunkley's] conviction became final."
531 U. S., at 226. The proper question under Fiore is not
whether the law has changed. Rather, Fiore requires that
the Florida Supreme Court answer whether, in light of
L. B., Bunkley's pocketknife of 21/2 to 3 inches fit within

$ 790.001(13)'s "common pocketknife" exception at the time
his conviction became final.

Although the Florida Supreme Court has determined that
the L. B. decision was merely an "evolutionary refinement"
in the meaning of the "common pocketknife" exception, it has
not answered whether the law in 1989 defined Bunkley's 21/2-
to 3-inch pocketknife as a "weapon" under $ 790.001(13). Although the L. B. decision might have "culminat[ed] . . . [the]
century-long evolutionary process," the question remains
about what $ 790.001(13) meant in 1989. 833 So. 2d, at 745.

Per Curiam
If Bunkley's pocketknife fit within the "common pocketknife"exception to $ 790.001(13) in 1989, then Bunkley was convicted of a crime for which he cannot be guilty--burglary inthe first degree. And if the "stages" of $ 790.001(13)'s "evolution" had not sufficiently progressed so that Bunkley'spocketknife was still a weapon in 1989, this case raises the
issue left open in Fiore.

It is true that the Florida Supreme Court held Fiore inap-plicable because the

L. B. decision was a change in the law
which "culminat[ed] [the] century-long evolutionary process."833 So. 2d, at 745. As the dissent acknowledges, however,

see post, at 843, n. 1, the Florida Supreme Court's decision
in L. B. cast doubt on the validity of Bunkley's conviction.
For the first time, the Florida Supreme Court interpreted
the common pocketknife exception, and its interpretation
covered the weapon Bunkley possessed at the time of his
offense. In the face of such doubt, Fiore entitles Bunkley to
a determination as to whether L. B. correctly stated the common pocketknife exception at the time he was convicted.
Ordinarily, the Florida Supreme Court's holding that L. B.
constitutes a change in--rather than a clarification of--the
law would be sufficient to dispose of the Fiore question. By
holding that a change in the law occurred, the Florida Supreme Court would thereby likewise have signaled that the
common pocketknife exception was narrower at the time
Bunkley was convicted.

Here, however, the Florida Supreme Court said more. It
characterized L. B. as part of the "century-long evolutionary
process." 833 So. 2d, at 745. Because Florida law was in a
state of evolution over the course of these many years, we
do not know what stage in the evolutionary process the law
had reached at the time Bunkley was convicted. The Florida Supreme Court never asked whether the weapons statute had "evolved" by 1989 to such an extent that Bunkley's
21/2- to 3-inch pocketknife fit within the "common pocketknife" exception. The proper question under Fiore is not

just whether the law changed. Rather, it is when the lawchanged. The Florida Supreme Court has not answered

this question; instead, it appeared to assume that merelylabeling

L. B. as the "culmination" in the common pocketknife exception's "century-long evolutionary process" wassufficient to resolve the

Fiore question. 833 So. 2d, at 745.
It is not. Without further clarification from the Florida Supreme Court as to the content of the common pocketknifeexception in 1989, we cannot know whether

L. B. correctly
stated the common pocketknife exception at the time hewas convicted.

On remand, the Florida Supreme Court should considerwhether, in light of the

L. B. decision, Bunkley's pocketknife
of 21/2 to 3 inches fit within $ 790.001(13)'s "common pocketknife" exception at the time his conviction became final.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida, accordingly,
is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

The Court here makes new law, and does so without
briefing or argument. In Fiore v. White, 528 U. S. 23, 29
(1999), we granted certiorari to answer whether due process
requires a state court to apply a judicially announced change
in state criminal law retroactively. We realized after granting certiorari, however, that we could not answer that question until we knew whether there had been a change in the
law at all. We therefore certified a question to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court asking whether its decision in Commonwealth v. Scarpone, 535 Pa. 273, 279, 634 A. 2d 1109,
1112 (1993), was a change in the law from the time of the
defendant's conviction. When the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court answered that there had been no change, we acknowledged that there was no question of retroactivity left for

us to answer. Fiore v. White, 531 U. S. 225, 226 (2001) (percuriam).

In the present case, the Court concedes that the FloridaSupreme Court acknowledged our opinion in Fiore. The
Florida Supreme Court concluded that its decision in L. B.v. State, 700 So. 2d 370 (1997) (per curiam), decided after
petitioner's conviction became final, marked a change inFlorida law. 833 So. 2d 739, 744, n. 12 (2002).

1 The state

court therefore considered whether the change should be ap-plied retroactively, and concluded that it should not be.

The Court recognizes, as it must, that the Florida Su-preme Court concluded that

L. B. was a change in the lawfrom the time of petitioner's conviction. Ante, at 841 ("It is

true that the Florida Supreme Court held . . . [that] the L. B.decision was a change in the law"). Yet the Court criticizes
the Florida Supreme Court for thinking that conclusion "suf-ficient to dispose of the Fiore question." Ibid. The Court
acknowledges that "[o]rdinarily, the Florida Supreme Court'sholding that

L. B. constitutes a change in--rather than a clar-ification of--the law would be sufficient to dispose of the

Fiore question," but then holds that, because the Florida Su-preme Court "characterized L. B. as part of the `century-long
evolutionary process,' " Fiore requires that court to answeran additional question: whether petitioner's knife fit within
the " `common pocketknife' " exception at the time of his con-viction. Ante, at 841.

Fiore requires no such thing. Fiore asked whether achange had occurred and, upon finding that none had, ended
the inquiry. The Court here goes much further. It ac-knowledges that L. B. neither clarified the law that was in
existence at the time of petitioner's conviction nor changedthe law with retroactive effect. Yet it nonetheless insists

1 Petitioner presents strong arguments in favor of his view that the
bright-line rule set out in L. B. existed as a matter of Florida law at the
time of his conviction. Pet. for Cert. 6. But the Florida Supreme Court
concluded otherwise, and we may not revisit that question.

that the Florida Supreme Court reevaluate the sufficiency of
the evidence in this case. See ante, at 840, 842 (holding that
Florida Supreme Court must answer whether "Bunkley's
pocketknife . . . fit within [Fla. Stat.] $ 790.001(13)'s `common
pocketknife' exception at the time his conviction became
final"). The Court announces this conclusion as a matter of
"Fiore" without explaining why due process requires it.
The Court's holding is a new one, and its criticism of the
state court for failing to anticipate this holding is unjustified.2 The Florida Supreme Court, moreover, has essentially answered the question on which the Court now
remands.3

The Court's decision to expand Fiore is not only new, it
also unjustifiably interferes with States' interest in finality.
The Florida courts have already considered several times the
question this Court now asks them to answer. On direct
appeal, petitioner specifically argued that a knife with a

2 The Court further criticizes the Florida Supreme Court for its workmanship in the decision under review. Thus, while it recognizes the Florida court's conclusion that L. B. did not state the law at the time of petitioner's conviction, the Court reprimands the Florida court for failing to
reach its holding in a sufficiently clear manner. See, e. g., ante, at 842
("Without further clarification from the Florida Supreme Court . . . we
cannot know whether L. B. correctly stated the common pocketknife exception at the time [petitioner] was convicted"). This rebuke to the state
court violates the well-established rule that this Court will not "require
state courts to reconsider cases to clarify the grounds of their decisions."
Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1040 (1983); see also id., at 1041 (noting
the Court's desire to "avoi[d] the unsatisfactory and intrusive practice of
requiring state courts to clarify their decisions to the satisfaction of this
Court").

3 The state court explained that "[a]lthough some courts" prior to L. B.

"may have interpreted `common pocketknife' contrary to the holding in
L. B., each court nevertheless sought to comply with legislative intent and
to rule in harmony with the law as it was interpreted at that point in
time." 833 So. 2d 739, 745 (Fla. 2002). Thus, the court explained, "none
of the convictions imposed pursuant to section 790.001(13) violated the
Due Process Clause." Ibid.

Florida has established a 2-year period of limitations forfiling motions for postconviction relief. Florida Rule of

Criminal Procedure 3.850 "provides an exception to the two-year time limitation for filing postconviction motions where
`a fundamental constitutional right asserted was not estab-lished within the period provided for herein and has been
held to apply retroactively.' " 768 So. 2d 510, 511 (Fla. App.2000)

(per curiam) (quoting Fla. Rule Crim. Proc. 3.850(b)(2)(2000)). The Court's decision here overrides Florida's Rule,

authorizing claims for postconviction relief where there hasbeen a change in the law that has specifically been held

notto apply retroactively.

The Court's holding expanding Fiore is striking, and theCourt's decision to adopt it summarily is even more so.
I would deny the petition for writ of certiorari.

AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL RULESOF EVIDENCE
Rule 608. Evidence of character and conduct of witness.

(a) Opinion and reputation evidence of character.--Thecredibility of a witness may be attacked or supported by evidence in the form of opinion or reputation, but subject tothese limitations: (1) the evidence may refer only to character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, and (2) evidence oftruthful character is admissible only after the character of the
witness for truthfulness has been attacked by opinion or rep-utation evidence or otherwise.

(b) Specific instances of conduct.--Specific instances ofthe conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or
supporting the witness' character for truthfulness, otherthan conviction of crime as provided in Rule 609, may not
be proved by extrinsic evidence. They may, however, inthe discretion of the court, if probative of truthfulness or

untruthfulness, be inquired into on cross-examination ofthe witness (1) concerning the witness' character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, or (2) concerning the characterfor truthfulness or untruthfulness of another witness as
to which character the witness being cross-examined hastestified.

The giving of testimony, whether by an accused or by anyother witness, does not operate as a waiver of the accused's
or the witness' privilege against self-incrimination when ex-amined with respect to matters that relate only to character
for truthfulness.

OPINION OF INDIVIDUAL JUSTICE

IN CHAMBERS

KENYERES v. ASHCROFT, ATTORNEY GENERAL,

et al.

on application for stay
No. 02A777. Decided March 21, 2003
Applicant's request for a stay of his removal from the United States is

denied, and a previously granted temporary stay to enable the United
States to respond to his claims and to permit Justice Kennedy to
consider the matter is vacated. When the Immigration and Naturalization Service initiated removal proceedings against him for overstaying
his tourist visa, an Immigration Judge denied applicant's asylum request
and ruled that withholding of removal was unavailable because there
was reason to believe that applicant had committed a serious nonpolitical crime outside the United States. The Bureau of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed. The Eleventh Circuit denied a stay of removal
pending judicial review on the ground that 8 U. S. C. $ 1252(f)(2) requires a court to adduce clear and convincing evidence before granting
such a temporary stay. This is not an appropriate case in which to
examine and resolve the important question whether $ 1252(f)(2)'s
heightened standard applies to temporary stays, an issue that has divided the Courts of Appeals. Applicant is unlikely to prevail under
either the Eleventh Circuit's standard or the more lenient one adopted
by other Courts of Appeals. A reviewing court must uphold an administrative determination in an immigration case unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. Given the Immigration Judge's factual findings and the evidence in the removal hearing record, applicant is unable
to establish a reasonable likelihood that a reviewing court will be compelled to disagree with the BIA's decision. Thus, his claim is not sufficiently meritorious to create a reasonable probability that four Members
of this Court will vote to grant certiorari.

1302 KENYERES v. ASHCROFT

Opinion in Chambers
Justice Kennedy, Circuit Justice.
This case is before me on an application for a stay of analien's removal from the United States.

Applicant, Zsolt Kenyeres, is a citizen of the Republic ofHungary. On January 29, 1997, he entered the United
States on a tourist visa, which permitted him to remain inthe country through July 28, 1997. Applicant remained past
the deadline without authorization from the Immigration andNaturalization Service (INS), and on June 21, 2000, the INS
initiated removal proceedings, alleging the overstay. Appli-cant sought asylum under 94 Stat. 105, as amended, 8 U. S. C.

$ 1158(a), withholding of removal under 110 Stat. 3009-602,8 U. S. C. $ 1231(b)(3), and deferral of removal under the
United Nations Convention Against Torture and OtherCruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,
Dec. 10, 1984, 1465 U. N. T. S. 85, 23 I. L. M. 1027, see 8 CFR$ 208.17 (2002). An Immigration Judge held applicant to be
removable; but the Bureau of Immigration Appeals (BIA)concluded that the judge failed to provide sufficient explanation for his decision, and remanded the case.On remand the Immigration Judge determined that Kenyeres' asylum application was untimely under 8 U. S. C.$ 1158(a)(2)(B), and that he could not make a showing of
changed circumstances or extraordinary conditions necessary to excuse the delay, see $ 1158(a)(2)(D). As to withhold-ing of removal, the judge ruled this relief was unavailable because of "serious reasons to believe that the aliencommitted a serious nonpolitical crime outside the United
States before the alien arrived i n the United States. "$ 1231(b)(3)(B)(iii).

The INS presented sufficient evidence that applicant waswanted in Hungary on charges of embezzlement, which is a
serious nonpolitical crime. See In re Castellon, 17 I. & N.Dec. 616 (BIA 1981). Noting applicant's concession that
he overstayed his visa, the Immigration Judge ordered him

1303Cite as: 538 U. S. 1301 (2003)
Opinion in Chambers
removed on account of this violation. (Applicant has
withdrawn his application for deferral of removal under the
Convention Against Torture.) The BIA affirmed the Immigration Judge's order without opinion.

Applicant sought review by the Court of Appeals for the
Eleventh Circuit and requested a stay of removal pending
review. The Court of Appeals denied the stay. No. 03-
10845-D (Mar. 14, 2003). The court relied on 8 U. S. C.

$ 1252(f)(2), which provides that "no court shall enjoin the
removal of any alien pursuant to a final order under this
section unless the alien shows by clear and convincing evidence that the entry or execution of such order is prohibited
as a matter of law." The Court of Appeals relied on its decision in Weng v. Attorney General, 287 F. 3d 1335 (2002) (per
curiam), which holds that the evidentiary standard prescribed by $ 1252(f )(2) applies to motions for a temporary
stay of removal pending judicial review.

Kenyeres has filed with me as Circuit Justice an application for a stay of removal, arguing that the interpretation of

$ 1252(f)(2) adopted by the Court of Appeals is erroneous.
By insisting that clear and convincing evidence be adduced
in order to grant a stay, he maintains, the Eleventh Circuit
in effect made judicial review unavailable in cases of asylum
and withholding of deportation. He contends that an application for a stay should be assessed under a more lenient
standard, one adopted by other Courts of Appeals. Their
standard simply asks whether applicant has demonstrated a
likelihood of success on the merits. Applicant submits he
can satisfy this requirement and so a stay of removal should
issue. I granted a temporary stay of the BIA order to enable the United States to respond to applicant's claims and
to consider the matter.

The question raised by applicant indeed has divided the
Courts of Appeals. The Courts of Appeals for the Second,
Sixth, and Ninth Circuits have examined the matter, both

1304 KENYERES v. ASHCROFT

Opinion in Chambers
before and after the Eleventh Circuit's decision in Weng, andhave reached a contrary result. See

Andreiu v. Ashcroft,
253 F. 3d 477 (CA9 2001) (en banc); Bejjani v. INS, 271 F. 3d670 (CA6 2001);

Mohammed v. Reno, 309 F. 3d 95 (CA2 2002).
In the cases just cited, these courts take the position thatthe heightened standard of $ 1252(f )(2) applies only to injunctions against an alien's removal, not to temporary stays
sought for the duration of the alien's petition for review.
Andreiu, supra, at 479-483; Bejjani, supra, at 687-689; Mohammed, supra, at 97-100. These courts evaluate requestsfor a stay under their traditional standard for granting injunctive relief in the immigration context, which seeks to
measure an applicant's likelihood of success on the merits
and to take account of the equity interests involved. See
Andreiu, supra, at 483 ("[P]etitioner must show `either (1) a
probability of success on the merits and the possibility of
irreparable injury, or (2) that serious legal questions are
raised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in the petitioner's favor' " (quoting Abassi v. INS, 143 F. 3d 513, 514
(CA9 1998))); Bejjani, supra, at 688 (requiring a showing of
"(1) a likelihood of success on the merits; (2) that irreparable
harm would occur if a stay is not granted; (3) that the potential harm to the movant outweighs the harm to the opposing
party if a stay is not granted; and (4) that the granting of
the stay would serve the public interest" (quoting Sofinet v.
INS, 188 F. 3d 703, 706 (CA7 1999))); Mohammed, supra, at
101 (" `a substantial possibility, although less than a likelihood, of success' " (quoting Dubose v. Pierce, 761 F. 2d 913,
920 (CA2 1985), vacated on other grounds, 487 U. S. 1229
(1988))).

The courts on each side of the split have considered the
contrary opinions of their sister Circuits and have adhered
to their own expressed views. See Weng, supra, at 1337,
n. 2; Mohammed, supra, at 98-99. Both standards have
been a subject of internal criticism. See Andreiu, supra, at
485 (Beezer, J., separately concurring); Bonhomme-Ardouin

Opinion in Chambers
v. Attorney General, 291 F. 3d 1289, 1290 (CA11 2002) (Bar-kett, J., concurring).

The issue is important. If the exacting standard of$ 1252(f)(2) applies to requests for temporary stays, then
to obtain judicial review aliens subject to removal must domore than show a likelihood of success on the merits. See
Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418, 425 (1979) (The "intermediate standard of clear and convincing evidence" lies"between a preponderance of the evidence and proof beyond

a reasonable doubt"). An opportunity to present one's meri-torious grievances to a court supports the legitimacy and
public acceptance of a statutory regime. It is particularly
so in the immigration context, where seekers of asylum and
refugees from persecution expect to be treated in accordance
with the rule-of-law principles often absent in the countries
they have escaped. A standard that is excessively stringent
may impede access to the courts in meritorious cases. On
the other hand, $ 1252(f)(2) is a part of Congress' deliberate
effort to reform the immigration law in order to relieve the
courts from the need to consider meritless petitions, and so
devote their scarce judicial resources to meritorious claims
for relief. Cf. Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
Comm., 525 U. S. 471, 486 (1999). If the interpretation
adopted by the Second, Sixth, and Ninth Circuits is erroneous, and $ 1252(f)(2) governs requests for stays, this congressional effort will be frustrated. As of this point, applicant
already has overstayed his visa by more than five years.
Had the Eleventh Circuit granted the stay under the more
lenient approach, months more would elapse before his case
is resolved.

Given the significant nature of the issue and the acknowledged disagreement among the lower courts, the Court, in
my view, should examine and resolve the question in an appropriate case. This, however, is not an appropriate case.

Applicant is unlikely to prevail in his request for a stay
under either of the standards adopted by the Courts of Ap538US1IC2L 10-15-04 15:25:56 PAGES IC13PGT
1306 KENYERES v. ASHCROFT

Opinion in Chambers
peals. Applicant argues that the Immigration Judge erroneously rejected his claim under the nonpolitical crime
restriction of $ 1231(b)(3)(B)(iii). He asserts that the Hungarian Government fabricated the embezzlement and fraud
charges against him for political reasons. Whether these
charges should be disregarded as fabricated depends on a
question of fact. The Immigration Judge's findings in that
respect are "conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator
would be compelled to conclude to the contrary." $ 1252(b)
(4)(B). Based on the record presented at the removal hearing, the Immigration Judge could find substantial grounds to
believe that applicant committed serious financial crimes in
Hungary. The record contains a translation of the Hungarian arrest warrant for embezzlement and aggravated fraud,
as well as testimony that the warrant was obtained from
Interpol, which the INS deems to be a reliable source. See
App. E to Memorandum of Respondents in Opposition 100-
101, 135-136. In his own testimony applicant did not dispute that he was engaged in money laundering for organized
crime. See id., at 111-112, 115-116, 120.

A reviewing court must uphold an administrative determination in an immigration case unless the evidence compels a
conclusion to the contrary. INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U. S.
478, 481, n. 1, 483-484 (1992); see also INS v. Orlando Ventura, 537 U. S. 12, 16 (2002) (per curiam). Given the factual
findings of the Immigration Judge and the evidence in the
record, applicant is unable to establish a reasonable likelihood that a reviewing court will be compelled to disagree
with the decision of the BIA. Applicant's claim is not sufficiently meritorious to create a reasonable probability that
four Members of this Court will vote to grant certiorari in
his case. See, e. g., Bartlett v. Stephenson, 535 U. S. 1301,
1304-1305 (2002) (Rehnquist, C. J., in chambers); Lucas v.
Townsend, 486 U. S. 1301, 1304 (1988) (Kennedy, J., in chambers). My assessment likely would be different in a case

where the choice of evidentiary standard applicable to a re-quest for a stay could influence the outcome.

The stay previously granted is vacated, and the applicationfor a stay is denied.
