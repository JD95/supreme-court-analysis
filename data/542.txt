CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 2003

ELK GROVE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT et al. v.

NEWDOW et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 02-1624. Argued March 24, 2004--Decided June 14, 2004
Petitioner school district requires each elementary school class to recite

daily the Pledge of Allegiance. Respondent Newdow's daughter participates in this exercise. Newdow, an atheist, filed suit alleging that, because the Pledge contains the words "under God," it constitutes religious indoctrination of his child in violation of the Establishment and
Free Exercise Clauses. He also alleged that he had standing to sue on
his own behalf and on behalf of his daughter as "next friend." The
Magistrate Judge concluded that the Pledge is constitutional, and the
District Court agreed and dismissed the complaint. The Ninth Circuit
reversed, holding that Newdow has standing as a parent to challenge a
practice that interferes with his right to direct his daughter's religious
education, and that the school district's policy violates the Establishment Clause. Sandra Banning, the child's mother, then filed a motion
to intervene or dismiss, declaring, inter alia, that she had exclusive
legal custody under a state-court order and that, as her daughter's sole
legal custodian, she felt it was not in the child's interest to be a party
to Newdow's suit. Concluding that Banning's sole legal custody did not
deprive Newdow, as a noncustodial parent, of Article III standing to
object to unconstitutional government action affecting his child, the
Ninth Circuit held that, under California law, Newdow retains the right
to expose his child to his particular religious views even if they contra1

Syllabus
dict her mother's, as well as the right to seek redress for an alleged
injury to his own parental interests.

Held: Because California law deprives Newdow of the right to sue as next

friend, he lacks prudential standing to challenge the school district's
policy in federal court. The standing requirement derives from the
constitutional and prudential limits to the powers of an unelected, unrepresentative judiciary. E. g., Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 750.
The Court's prudential standing jurisprudence encompasses, inter alia,
"the general prohibition on a litigant's raising another person's legal
rights," e. g., id., at 751, and the Court generally declines to intervene
in domestic relations, a traditional subject of state law, e. g., In re Burrus, 136 U. S. 586, 593-594. The extent of the standing problem raised
by the domestic relations issues in this case was not apparent until Banning filed her motion to intervene or dismiss, declaring that the family
court order gave her "sole legal custody" and authorized her to "exercise legal control" over her daughter. Newdow's argument that he nevertheless retains an unrestricted right to inculcate in his daughter his
beliefs fails because his rights cannot be viewed in isolation. This case
also concerns Banning's rights under the custody orders and, most important, their daughter's interests upon finding herself at the center of
a highly public debate. Newdow's standing derives entirely from his
relationship with his daughter, but he lacks the right to litigate as her
next friend. Their interests are not parallel and, indeed, are potentially
in conflict. Newdow's parental status is defined by state law, and this
Court customarily defers to the state-law interpretations of the regional
federal court, see Bishop v. Wood, 426 U. S. 341, 346-347. Here, the
Ninth Circuit relied on intermediate state appellate cases recognizing
the right of each parent, whether custodial or noncustodial, to impart to
the child his or her religious perspective. Nothing that either Banning
or the school board has done, however, impairs Newdow's right to instruct his daughter in his religious views. Instead, he requests the
more ambitious relief of forestalling his daughter's exposure to religious
ideas endorsed by her mother, who wields a form of veto power, and to
use his parental status to challenge the influences to which his daughter
may be exposed in school when he and Banning disagree. The California cases simply do not stand for the proposition that Newdow has a
right to reach outside the private parent-child sphere to dictate to others what they may and may not say to his child respecting religion. A
next friend surely could exercise such a right, but the family court's
order has deprived Newdow of that status. Pp. 11-18.

Opinion of the Court
a group recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. Respondent,
Michael A. Newdow, is an atheist whose daughter participates in that daily exercise. Because the Pledge contains
the words "under God," he views the School District's policy
as a religious indoctrination of his child that violates the
First Amendment. A divided panel of the Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit agreed with Newdow. In light of the
obvious importance of that decision, we granted certiorari to
review the First Amendment issue and, preliminarily, the
question whether Newdow has standing to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts. We conclude that Newdow
lacks standing and therefore reverse the Court of Appeals'
decision.

6 ELK GROVE UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. v. NEWDOW

Opinion of the Court

I
"The very purpose of a national flag is to serve as a symbolof our country,"

Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 405 (1989),and of its proud traditions "of freedom, of equal opportunity,

of religious tolerance, and of good will for other peoples whoshare our aspirations," id., at 437 (

Stevens, J., dissenting).As its history illustrates, the Pledge of Allegiance evolved

as a common public acknowledgment of the ideals that ourflag symbolizes. Its recitation is a patriotic exercise designed to foster national unity and pride in those principles.The Pledge of Allegiance was initially conceived more than
a century ago. As part of the nationwide interest in com-memorating the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus'
discovery of America, a widely circulated national magazinefor youth proposed in 1892 that pupils recite the following
affirmation: "I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republicfor which it stands: one Nation indivisible, with Liberty and
Justice for all." 1 In the 1920's, the National Flag Confer-ences replaced the phrase "my Flag" with "the flag of the
United States of America."In 1942, in the midst of World War II, Congress adopted,
and the President signed, a Joint Resolution codifying a de-tailed set of "rules and customs pertaining to the display and
use of the flag of the United States of America." Ch. 435,56 Stat. 377. Section 7 of this codification provided in full:

"That the pledge of allegiance to the flag, `I pledge alle-giance to the flag of the United States of America and
to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation indivisi-ble, with liberty and justice for all', be rendered by

1 J. Baer, The Pledge of Allegiance: A Centennial History, 1892-1992,
p. 3 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). At the time, the phrase
"one Nation indivisible" had special meaning because the question whether
a State could secede from the Union had been intensely debated and was
unresolved prior to the Civil War. See J. Randall, Constitutional Problems Under Lincoln 12-24 (rev. ed. 1964). See also W. Rehnquist, Centennial Crisis: The Disputed Election of 1876, p. 182 (2004).

Opinion of the Court
standing with the right hand over the heart; extending
the right hand, palm upward, toward the flag at the
words `to the flag' and holding this position until the
end, when the hand drops to the side. However, civilians will always show full respect to the flag when the
pledge is given by merely standing at attention, men
removing the headdress. Persons in uniform shall render the military salute." Id., at 380.

This resolution, which marked the first appearance of the
Pledge of Allegiance in positive law, confirmed the importance of the flag as a symbol of our Nation's indivisibility and
commitment to the concept of liberty.

Congress revisited the Pledge of Allegiance 12 years later
when it amended the text to add the words "under God."
Act of June 14, 1954, ch. 297, 68 Stat. 249. The House Report that accompanied the legislation observed that, "[f]rom
the time of our earliest history our peoples and our institutions have reflected the traditional concept that our Nation
was founded on a fundamental belief in God." H. R. Rep.
No. 1693, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1954). The resulting text
is the Pledge as we know it today: "I pledge allegiance to the
Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for
which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all." 4 U. S. C. $ 4.

II
Under California law, "every public elementary school"
must begin each day with "appropriate patriotic exercises."
Cal. Educ. Code Ann. $ 52720 (West 1989). The statute provides that "[t]he giving of the Pledge of Allegiance to the
Flag of the United States of America shall satisfy" this requirement. Ibid. The Elk Grove Unified School District
has implemented the state law by requiring that "[e]ach elementary school class recite the pledge of allegiance to the

Opinion of the Court
flag once each day." 2 Consistent with our case law, the
School District permits students who object on religious
grounds to abstain from the recitation. See West Virginia
Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624 (1943).

In March 2000, Newdow filed suit in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of California against
the United States Congress, the President of the United
States, the State of California, and the School District and its
superintendent.3 App. 24. At the time of filing, Newdow's
daughter was enrolled in kindergarten in the School District
and participated in the daily recitation of the Pledge.
Styled as a mandamus action, the complaint explains that
Newdow is an atheist who was ordained more than 20 years
ago in a ministry that "espouses the religious philosophy that
the true and eternal bonds of righteousness and virtue stem
from reason rather than mythology." Id., at 42, || 53. The
complaint seeks a declaration that the 1954 Act's addition of
the words "under God" violated the Establishment and Free
Exercise Clauses of the United States Constitution,4 as well
as an injunction against the School District's policy requiring
daily recitation of the Pledge. Id., at 42. It alleges that
Newdow has standing to sue on his own behalf and on behalf
of his daughter as "next friend." Id., at 26, 56.

2 Elk Grove Unified School District's Policy AR 6115, App. to Brief for
United States as Respondent Supporting Petitioners 2a.

3 Newdow also named as defendants the Sacramento City Unified School

District and its superintendent on the chance that his daughter might one
day attend school in that district. App. 48. The Court of Appeals held
that Newdow lacks standing to challenge that district's policy because his
daughter is not currently a student there. Newdow v. U. S. Congress, 328
F. 3d 466, 485 (CA9 2003) (Newdow III). Newdow has not challenged
that ruling.

4 The First Amendment provides in relevant part that "Congress shall

make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the
free exercise thereof." U. S. Const., Amdt. 1. The Religion Clauses
apply to the States by incorporation into the Fourteenth Amendment.
See Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 303 (1940).

9Cite as: 542 U. S. 1 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
The case was referred to a Magistrate Judge, whose brieffindings and recommendation concluded, "the Pledge does

not violate the Establishment Clause." Id., at 79. The Dis-trict Court adopted that recommendation and dismissed the
complaint on July 21, 2000. App. to Pet. for Cert. 97. TheCourt of Appeals reversed and issued three separate decisions discussing the merits and Newdow's standing.

In its first opinion the appeals court unanimously held thatNewdow has standing "as a parent to challenge a practice

that interferes with his right to direct the religious educa-tion of his daughter."

Newdow v. U. S. Congress, 292 F. 3d
597, 602 (CA9 2002) (Newdow I). That holding sustained
Newdow's standing to challenge not only the policy of the
School District, where his daughter still is enrolled, but also
the 1954 Act of Congress that had amended the Pledge, because his " `injury in fact' " was " `fairly traceable' " to its enactment. Id., at 603-605. On the merits, over the dissent
of one judge, the court held that both the 1954 Act and the
School District's policy violate the Establishment Clause of
the First Amendment. Id., at 612.

After the Court of Appeals' initial opinion was announced,
Sandra Banning, the mother of Newdow's daughter, filed a
motion for leave to intervene, or alternatively to dismiss the
complaint. App. 82. She declared that although she and
Newdow shared "physical custody" of their daughter, a
state-court order granted her "exclusive legal custody" of
the child, "including the sole right to represent [the daughter's] legal interests and make all decision[s] about her education" and welfare. Id., at 82, |||| 2-3. Banning further
stated that her daughter is a Christian who believes in God
and has no objection either to reciting or hearing others
recite the Pledge of Allegiance, or to its reference to God.
Id., at 83, || 4. Banning expressed the belief that her daughter would be harmed if the litigation were permitted to proceed, because others might incorrectly perceive the child as
sharing her father's atheist views. Id., at 85, || 10. Ban542US1 Unit: $U58 [10-25-06 12:50:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
10 ELK GROVE UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. v. NEWDOW

Opinion of the Court
ning accordingly concluded, as her daughter's sole legalcustodian, that it was not in the child's interest to be a party

to Newdow's lawsuit. Id., at 85. On September 25, 2002,the California Superior Court entered an order enjoining
Newdow from including his daughter as an unnamed partyor suing as her "next friend." That order did not purport
to answer the question of Newdow's Article III standing.
See Newdow v. U. S. Congress, 313 F. 3d 500, 502 (CA9 2002)
(Newdow II).

In a second published opinion, the Court of Appeals recon-sidered Newdow's standing in light of Banning's motion.

The court noted that Newdow no longer claimed to represent
his daughter, but unanimously concluded that "the grant of
sole legal custody to Banning" did not deprive Newdow, "as
a noncustodial parent, of Article III standing to object to
unconstitutional government action affecting his child." Id.,
at 502-503. The court held that under California law Newdow retains the right to expose his child to his particular
religious views even if those views contradict the mother's,
and that Banning's objections as sole legal custodian do not
defeat Newdow's right to seek redress for an alleged injury
to his own parental interests. Id., at 504-505.

On February 28, 2003, the Court of Appeals issued an
order amending its first opinion and denying rehearing en
banc. Newdow v. U. S. Congress, 328 F. 3d 466, 468 (CA9
2003) (Newdow III). The amended opinion omitted the initial opinion's discussion of Newdow's standing to challenge
the 1954 Act and declined to determine whether Newdow
was entitled to declaratory relief regarding the constitutionality of that Act. Id., at 490. Nine judges dissented from
the denial of en banc review. Id., at 471, 482. We granted
the School District's petition for a writ of certiorari to consider two questions: (1) whether Newdow has standing as a
noncustodial parent to challenge the School District's policy,
and (2) if so, whether the policy offends the First Amendment. 540 U. S. 945 (2003).

Opinion of the Court

III
In every federal case, the party bringing the suit mustestablish standing to prosecute the action. "In essence the

question of standing is whether the litigant is entitled tohave the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues." Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 498 (1975). Thestanding requirement is born partly of " `an idea, which is
more than an intuition but less than a rigorous and explicittheory, about the constitutional and prudential limits to the
powers of an unelected, unrepresentative judiciary in ourkind of government.' "

Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 750(1984) (quoting
Vander Jagt v. O'Neill, 699 F. 2d 1166, 1178-1179 (CADC 1983) (Bork, J., concurring)).

The command to guard jealously and exercise rarely ourpower to make constitutional pronouncements requires
strictest adherence when matters of great national signifi-cance are at stake. Even in cases concededly within our jurisdiction under Article III, we abide by "a series of rulesunder which [we have] avoided passing upon a large part of
all the constitutional questions pressed upon [us] for deci-sion." Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). Always we must balance "the heavyobligation to exercise jurisdiction," Colorado River Water
Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U. S. 800, 820 (1976),against the "deeply rooted" commitment "not to pass on
questions of constitutionality" unless adjudication of the con-stitutional issue is necessary,

Spector Motor Service, Inc. v.McLaughlin, 323 U. S. 101, 105 (1944). See also Rescue

Army v. Municipal Court of Los Angeles, 331 U. S. 549, 568-575 (1947).

Consistent with these principles, our standing jurispru-dence contains two strands: Article III standing, which enforces the Constitution's case-or-controversy requirement,see Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 559-562
(1992); and prudential standing, which embodies "judiciallyself-imposed limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction,"

542US1 Unit: $U58 [10-25-06 12:50:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
12 ELK GROVE UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. v. NEWDOW

Opinion of the Court
Allen, 468 U. S., at 751. The Article III limitations are fa-miliar: The plaintiff must show that the conduct of which he

complains has caused him to suffer an "injury in fact" that afavorable judgment will redress. See

Lujan, 504 U. S., at
560-561. Although we have not exhaustively defined theprudential dimensions of the standing doctrine, we have explained that prudential standing encompasses "the general
prohibition on a litigant's raising another person's legalrights, the rule barring adjudication of generalized grievances more appropriately addressed in the representativebranches, and the requirement that a plaintiff 's complaint
fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked." Allen, 468 U. S., at 751. See also Secretary of
State of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U. S. 947, 955-956
(1984). "Without such limitations--closely related to Art.
III concerns but essentially matters of judicial selfgovernance--the courts would be called upon to decide abstract questions of wide public significance even though
other governmental institutions may be more competent to
address the questions and even though judicial intervention
may be unnecessary to protect individual rights." Warth,
422 U. S., at 500.

One of the principal areas in which this Court has customarily declined to intervene is the realm of domestic relations.
Long ago we observed that "[t]he whole subject of the domestic relations of husband and wife, parent and child, belongs to the laws of the States and not to the laws of the
United States." In re Burrus, 136 U. S. 586, 593-594 (1890).
See also Mansell v. Mansell, 490 U. S. 581, 587 (1989) ("[D]omestic relations are preeminently matters of state law");
Moore v. Sims, 442 U. S. 415, 435 (1979) ("Family relations
are a traditional area of state concern"). So strong is our
deference to state law in this area that we have recognized
a "domestic relations exception" that "divests the federal
courts of power to issue divorce, alimony, and child custody
decrees." Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U. S. 689, 703

542US1 Unit: $U58 [10-25-06 12:50:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

13Cite as: 542 U. S. 1 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
(1992). We have also acknowledged that it might be appro-priate for the federal courts to decline to hear a case involving "elements of the domestic relationship," id., at 705, evenwhen divorce, alimony, or child custody is not strictly at
issue:

"This would be so when a case presents `difficult ques-tions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import whose importance transcends theresult in the case then at bar.' Such might well be
the case if a federal suit were filed prior to effectuationof a divorce, alimony, or child custody decree, and the
suit depended on a determination of the status of theparties." Id., at 705-706 (quoting Colorado River, 424
U. S., at 814).
Thus, while rare instances arise in which it is necessary toanswer a substantial federal question that transcends or exists apart from the family law issue, see, e. g., Palmore v.
Sidoti, 466 U. S. 429, 432-434 (1984), in general it is appro-priate for the federal courts to leave delicate issues of domestic relations to the state courts.5As explained briefly above, the extent of the standing
problem raised by the domestic relations issues in this casewas not apparent until August 5, 2002, when Banning filed

5 Our holding does not rest, as The Chief Justice suggests, see post,
at 19-22 (opinion concurring in judgment), on either the domestic relations
exception or the abstention doctrine. Rather, our prudential standing
analysis is informed by the variety of contexts in which federal courts
decline to intervene because, as Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U. S. 689
(1992), contemplated, the suit "depend[s] on a determination of the status
of the parties," id., at 706. We deemed it appropriate to review the dispute in Palmore because it "raise[d] important federal concerns arising
from the Constitution's commitment to eradicating discrimination based
on race." 466 U. S., at 432. In this case, by contrast, the disputed family
law rights are entwined inextricably with the threshold standing inquiry.
The Chief Justice in this respect, see post, at 21-22, misses our point:
The merits question undoubtedly transcends the domestic relations issue,
but the standing question surely does not.

Opinion of the Court
her motion for leave to intervene or dismiss the complaintfollowing the Court of Appeals' initial decision. At that

time, the child's custody was governed by a February 6, 2002,order of the California Superior Court. That order provided that Banning had " `sole legal custody as to the rightsand responsibilities to make decisions relating to the health,
education and welfare of ' " her daughter. Newdow II, 313F. 3d, at 502. The order stated that the two parents should
" `consult with one another on substantial decisions relatingto' " the child's " `psychological and educational needs,' " but
it authorized Banning to " `exercise legal control' " if the par-ents could not reach " `mutual agreement.' "

Ibid.That family court order was the controlling document at

the time of the Court of Appeals' standing decision. Afterthe Court of Appeals ruled, however, the Superior Court
held another conference regarding the child's custody. At ahearing on September 11, 2003, the Superior Court announced that the parents have "joint legal custody," but thatBanning "makes the final decisions if the two . . . disagree."
App. 127-128.6

6 The court confirmed that position in a written order issued January
9, 2004:

"The parties will have joint legal custody defined as follows: Ms. Banning will continue to make the final decisions as to the minor's health,
education, and welfare if the two parties cannot mutually agree. The parties are required to consult with each other on substantial decisions relating to the health, education and welfare of the minor child, including . . .
psychological and educational needs of the minor. If mutual agreement
is not reached in these areas, then Ms. Banning may exercise legal control
of the minor that is not specifically prohibited or is inconsistent with the
physical custody." App. to Reply Brief for United States as Respondent
Supporting Petitioners 12a.

Despite the use of the term "joint legal custody"--which is defined by
California statute, see Cal. Fam. Code Ann. $ 3003 (West 1994)--we see no
meaningful distinction for present purposes between the custody order

Opinion of the Court
Newdow contends that despite Banning's final authority,he retains "an unrestricted right to inculcate in his daughter--free from governmental interference--the atheistic be-liefs he finds persuasive." Id., at 48, || 78. The difficulty
with that argument is that Newdow's rights, as in manycases touching upon family relations, cannot be viewed in
isolation. This case concerns not merely Newdow's interestin inculcating his child with his views on religion, but also
the rights of the child's mother as a parent generally andunder the Superior Court orders specifically. And most important, it implicates the interests of a young child who findsherself at the center of a highly public debate over her custody, the propriety of a widespread national ritual, and themeaning of our Constitution.

The interests of the affected persons in this case are inmany respects antagonistic. Of course, legal disharmony in
family relations is not uncommon, and in many instances thatdisharmony poses no bar to federal-court adjudication of
proper federal questions. What makes this case different isthat Newdow's standing derives entirely from his relationship with his daughter, but he lacks the right to litigate asher next friend. In marked contrast to our case law on jus
tertii, see, e. g., Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U. S. 106, 113-118(1976) (plurality opinion), the interests of this parent and this
child are not parallel and, indeed, are potentially in conflict.7
child's education, but Banning possesses what we understand amounts to
a tie-breaking vote.

7 "There are good and sufficient reasons for th[e] prudential limitation

on standing when rights of third parties are implicated--the avoidance
of the adjudication of rights which those not before the Court may not
wish to assert, and the assurance that the most effective advocate of

the rights at issue is present to champion them." Duke Power Co. v.
Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., 438 U. S. 59, 80 (1978).
Banning tells us that her daughter has no objection to the Pledge, and we
are mindful in cases such as this that "children themselves have constitutionally protectible interests." Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S. 205, 243

16 ELK GROVE UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. v. NEWDOW

Opinion of the Court
Newdow's parental status is defined by California's domestic relations law. Our custom on questions of state law ordinarily is to defer to the interpretation of the Court of Appeals for the Circuit in which the State is located. See
Bishop v. Wood, 426 U. S. 341, 346-347 (1976). In this case,
the Court of Appeals, which possesses greater familiarity
with California law, concluded that state law vests in Newdow a cognizable right to influence his daughter's religious
upbringing. Newdow II, 313 F. 3d, at 504-505. The court
based its ruling on two intermediate state appellate cases
holding that "while the custodial parent undoubtedly has the
right to make ultimate decisions concerning the child's religious upbringing, a court will not enjoin the noncustodial
parent from discussing religion with the child or involving
the child in his or her religious activities in the absence of
a showing that the child will be thereby harmed." In re
Marriage of Murga, 103 Cal. App. 3d 498, 505, 163 Cal. Rptr.
79, 82 (1980). See also In re Marriage of Mentry, 142 Cal.
App. 3d 260, 268-270, 190 Cal. Rptr. 843, 849-850 (1983) (relying on Murga to invalidate portion of restraining order
barring noncustodial father from engaging children in religious activity or discussion without custodial parent's consent). Animated by a conception of "family privacy" that
includes "not simply a policy of minimum state intervention
but also a presumption of parental autonomy," 142 Cal. App.
3d, at 267-268, 190 Cal. Rptr., at 848, the state cases create a
zone of private authority within which each parent, whether
custodial or noncustodial, remains free to impart to the child
his or her religious perspective.

Nothing that either Banning or the School Board has done,
however, impairs Newdow's right to instruct his daughter in

(1972) (Douglas, J., dissenting). In a fundamental respect, "[i]t is the
future of the student, not the future of the parents," that is at stake.
Id., at 245.

Opinion of the Court
his religious views. Instead, Newdow requests relief that
is more ambitious than that sought in Mentry and Murga.
He wishes to forestall his daughter's exposure to religious
ideas that her mother, who wields a form of veto power, endorses, and to use his parental status to challenge the influences to which his daughter may be exposed in school when
he and Banning disagree. The California cases simply do
not stand for the proposition that Newdow has a right to
dictate to others what they may and may not say to his child
respecting religion. Mentry and Murga are concerned with
protecting " `the fragile, complex interpersonal bonds between child and parent,' " 142 Cal. App. 3d, at 267, 190 Cal.
Rptr., at 848, and with permitting divorced parents to expose
their children to the " `diversity of religious experiences
[that] is itself a sound stimulant for a child,' " id., at 265, 190
Cal. Rptr., at 847. The cases speak not at all to the problem
of a parent seeking to reach outside the private parent-child
sphere to restrain the acts of a third party. A next friend
surely could exercise such a right, but the Superior Court's
order has deprived Newdow of that status.

In our view, it is improper for the federal courts to entertain a claim by a plaintiff whose standing to sue is founded
on family law rights that are in dispute when prosecution of
the lawsuit may have an adverse effect on the person who is
the source of the plaintiff 's claimed standing. When hard
questions of domestic relations are sure to affect the outcome, the prudent course is for the federal court to stay its
hand rather than reach out to resolve a weighty question of
federal constitutional law. There is a vast difference between Newdow's right to communicate with his child--which
both California law and the First Amendment recognize--
and his claimed right to shield his daughter from influences
to which she is exposed in school despite the terms of the
custody order. We conclude that, having been deprived
under California law of the right to sue as next friend, New542US1 Unit: $U58 [10-25-06 12:50:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Scalia took no part in the consideration or deci-sion of this case.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice O'Connor joins, and with whom Justice Thomas joins as toPart I, concurring in the judgment.

The Court today erects a novel prudential standing princi-ple in order to avoid reaching the merits of the constitutional claim. I dissent from that ruling. On the merits,I conclude that the Elk Grove Unified School District (School
District) policy that requires teachers to lead willing stu-dents in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, which includes the
words "under God," does not violate the EstablishmentClause of the First Amendment.

I
The Court correctly notes that "our standing jurispru-dence contains two strands: Article III standing, which en8 Newdow's complaint and brief cite several additional bases for standing: that Newdow "at times has himself attended--and will in the future
attend--class with his daughter," App. 49, || 80; that he "has considered
teaching elementary school students in [the School District]," id., at 65,
|| 120; that he "has attended and will continue to attend" school board
meetings at which the Pledge is "routinely recited," id., at 52, || 85; and
that the School District uses his tax dollars to implement its Pledge policy,
id., at 62-65. Even if these arguments suffice to establish Article III
standing, they do not respond to our prudential concerns. As for taxpayer standing, Newdow does not reside in or pay taxes to the School
District; he alleges that he pays taxes to the District only "indirectly"
through his child support payments to Banning. Brief for Respondent
Newdow 49, n. 70. That allegation does not amount to the "direct
dollars-and-cents injury" that our strict taxpayer-standing doctrine requires. Doremus v. Board of Ed. of Hawthorne, 342 U. S. 429, 434 (1952).

forces the Constitution's case-or-controversy requirement,see

Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 559-562
(1992); and prudential standing, which embodies `judiciallyself-imposed limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction,'

[Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751 (1984)]." Ante, at 11-12.To be clear, the Court does not dispute that respondent Newdow (hereinafter respondent) satisfies the requisites of Article III standing. But curiously the Court incorporates criti-cism of the Court of Appeals' Article III standing decision

into its justification for its novel prudential standing princi-ple. The Court concludes that respondent lacks prudential
standing, under its new standing principle, to bring his suit
in federal court.

We have, in the past, judicially self-imposed clear limits on
the exercise of federal jurisdiction. See, e. g., Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 499 (1975); Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737,
751 (1984) ("Standing doctrine embraces several judicially
self-imposed limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction,
such as the general prohibition on a litigant's raising another
person's legal rights . . ."). In contrast, here is the Court's
new prudential standing principle: "[I]t is improper for the
federal courts to entertain a claim by a plaintiff whose standing to sue is founded on family law rights that are in dispute
when prosecution of the lawsuit may have an adverse effect
on the person who is the source of the plaintiff 's claimed
standing." Ante, at 17. The Court loosely bases this novel
prudential standing limitation on the domestic relations exception to diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction pursuant to 28
U. S. C. $ 1332, the abstention doctrine, and criticisms of the
Court of Appeals' construction of California state law, coupled with the prudential standing prohibition on a litigant's
raising another person's legal rights.

First, the Court relies heavily on Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U. S. 689 (1992), in which we discussed both the
domestic relations exception and the abstention doctrine.
In Ankenbrandt, the mother of two children sued her former

spouse and his female companion on behalf of the children,alleging physical and sexual abuse of the children. The

lower courts declined jurisdiction based on the domestic rela-tions exception to diversity jurisdiction and abstention under
Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37 (1971). We reversed, con-cluding that the domestic relations exception only applies
when a party seeks to have a district court issue "divorce,
alimony, and child custody decrees," Ankenbrandt, 504 U. S.,at 704. We further held that abstention was inappropriate

because "the status of the domestic relationship ha[d] beendetermined as a matter of state law, and in any event ha[d]
no bearing on the underlying torts alleged," id., at 706.

The Court first cites the domestic relations exception to
support its new principle. Then the Court relies on a quote
from Ankenbrandt's discussion of the abstention doctrine:
"We have also acknowledged that it might be appropriate for
the federal courts to decline to hear a case involving `elements of the domestic relationship,' id., at 705, even when
divorce, alimony, or child custody is not strictly at issue."
Ante, at 13. The Court perfunctorily states: "Thus, while
rare instances arise in which it is necessary to answer a substantial federal question that transcends or exists apart from
the family law issue, see, e. g., Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U. S.
429, 432-434 (1984), in general it is appropriate for the federal courts to leave delicate issues of domestic relations to
the state courts." Ante, at 13. That conclusion does not
follow from Ankenbrandt's discussion of the domestic relations exception and abstention; even if it did, it would not be
applicable in this case because, on the merits, this case presents a substantial federal question that transcends the family law issue to a greater extent than Palmore.

The domestic relations exception is not a prudential limitation on our federal jurisdiction. It is a limiting construction
of the statute defining federal diversity jurisdiction, 28
U. S. C. $ 1332, which "divests the federal courts of power to
issue divorce, alimony, and child custody decrees," Anken542US1 Unit: $U58 [10-25-06 12:50:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

21Cite as: 542 U. S. 1 (2004)

brandt, 504 U. S., at 703. This case does not involve diver-sity jurisdiction, and respondent does not ask this Court to

issue a divorce, alimony, or child custody decree. Instead itinvolves a substantial federal question about the constitutionality of the School District's conducting the Pledge cere-mony, which is the source of our jurisdiction. Therefore, the
domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction forms
no basis for denying standing to respondent.When we discussed abstention in

Ankenbrandt, we first
noted that "[a]bstention rarely should be invoked, becausethe federal courts have a `virtually unflagging obligation . . .

to exercise the jurisdiction given them.' " Id., at 705 (quoting Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United
States, 424 U. S. 800, 817 (1976)). Ankenbrandt's discussion
of abstention by no means supports the proposition that only
in the rare instances where "a substantial federal question . . . transcends or exists apart from the family law issue,"
ante, at 13, should federal courts decide the federal issue.
As in Ankenbrandt, "the status of the domestic relationship
has been determined as a matter of state law, and in any
event has no bearing on the underlying [constitutional violation] alleged." 504 U. S., at 706. Sandra Banning and respondent now share joint custody of their daughter, respondent retains the right to expose his daughter to his religious
views, and the state of their domestic affairs has nothing
to do with the underlying constitutional claim. Abstention
forms no basis for denying respondent standing.

The Court cites Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U. S. 429 (1984), as
an example of the exceptional case where a "substantial federal question that transcends or exists apart from the family
law issue" makes the exercise of our jurisdiction appropriate.
Ante, at 13. In Palmore, we granted certiorari to review a
child custody decision, and reversed the state court's decision
because we found that the effects of racial prejudice resulting from the mother's interracial marriage could not justify
granting custody to the father. Contrary to the Court's as542US1 Unit: $U58 [10-25-06 12:50:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
22 ELK GROVE UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. v. NEWDOW

sertion, the alleged constitutional violation, while clearly in-volving a "substantial federal question," did not "transcen[d]

or exis[t] apart from the family law issue," ante, at 13; ithad everything to do with the domestic relationship--"[w]e
granted certiorari to review a judgment of a state court di-vesting a natural mother of the custody of her infant child,"
466 U. S., at 430 (emphasis added). Under the Court's dis-cussion today, it appears that we should have stayed out of
the "domestic dispute" in Palmore no matter how constitu-tionally offensive the result would have been.

Finally, it seems the Court bases its new prudential stand-ing principle, in part, on criticisms of the Court of Appeals'
construction of state law, coupled with the prudential princi-ple prohibiting third-party standing. In the Court of Appeals' original opinion, it held unanimously that respondentsatisfied the Article III standing requirements, stating respondent "has standing as a parent to challenge a practicethat interferes with his right to direct the religious education of his daughter." Newdow v. U. S. Congress, 292 F.3d 597, 602 (CA9 2002). After Banning moved for leave to
intervene, the Court of Appeals reexamined respondent'sstanding to determine whether the parents' court-ordered
custodial arrangement altered respondent's standing. New-dow v. U. S. Congress, 313 F. 3d 500 (CA9 2002). The court
examined whether respondent could assert an injury in factby asking whether, under California law, "noncustodial parents maintain the right to expose and educate their childrento their individual religious views, even if those religious
views contradict those of the custodial parent." 1 Id., at 504.The Court of Appeals again unanimously concluded that the
respondent satisfied Article III standing, despite the custodyorder, because he retained sufficient parental rights under
California law. Id., at 504-505 (citing In re Marriage of

Murga v. Petersen, 103 Cal. App. 3d 498, 163 Cal. Rptr. 79(1980);

In re Marriage of Mentry, 142 Cal. App. 3d 260, 190
Cal. Rptr. 843 (1983)).The Court, contrary to the Court of Appeals' interpretation of California case law, concludes that respondent"requests relief that is more ambitious than that sought in
Mentry and Murga" because he seeks to restrain the act of
a third party outside the parent-child sphere. Ante, at 17.The Court then mischaracterizes respondent's alleged interest based on the Court's de novo construction of Califor-nia law.

The correct characterization of respondent's interest rests
on the interpretation of state law. As the Court recognizes,
ante, at 16, we have a "settled and firm policy of deferring
to regional courts of appeals in matters that involve the construction of state law." Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U. S.
879, 908 (1988). We do so "not only to render unnecessary
review of their decisions in this respect, but also to reflect
our belief that district courts and courts of appeals are better
schooled in and more able to interpret the laws of their respective States." Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472
U. S. 491, 500 (1985) (internal quotation marks and citation
omitted). In contrast to the Court, I would defer to the
Court of Appeals' interpretation of California law because it
is our settled policy to do so, and because I think that the
Court of Appeals has the better reading of Murga, supra,
and Mentry, supra.

The Court does not take issue with the fact that, under
California law, respondent retains a right to influence his
daughter's religious upbringing and to expose her to his
views. But it relies on Banning's view of the merits of this
case to diminish respondent's interest, stating that the respondent "wishes to forestall his daughter's exposure to religious ideas that her mother, who wields a form of veto
power, endorses, and to use his parental status to challenge
the influences to which his daughter may be exposed in

school when he and Banning disagree." Ante, at 17. Asalleged by respondent and as recognized by the Court of Appeals, respondent wishes to enjoin the School District fromendorsing a form of religion inconsistent with his own views
because he has a right to expose his daughter to those viewswithout the State's placing its imprimatur on a particular
religion. Under the Court of Appeals' construction of Cali-fornia law, Banning's "veto power" does not override respondent's right to challenge the Pledge ceremony.The Court concludes that the California cases "do not
stand for the proposition that [respondent] has a right to dic-tate to others what they may or may not say to his child
respecting religion." Ibid. Surely, under California caselaw and the current custody order, respondent may not tell
Banning what she may say to their child respecting religion,and respondent does not seek to. Just as surely, respondent
cannot name his daughter as a party to a lawsuit againstBanning's wishes. But his claim is different: Respondent
does not seek to tell just anyone what he or she may say tohis daughter, and he does not seek to vindicate solely her
rights.Respondent asserts that the School District's Pledge ceremony infringes his right under California law to exposehis daughter to his religious views. While she is intimately
associated with the source of respondent's standing (thefather-daughter relationship and respondent's rights thereunder), the daughter is not the source of respondent's stand-ing; instead it is their relationship that provides respondent
his standing, which is clear once respondent's interest isproperly described.

2 The Court's criticisms of the Court of

2 Also as properly described, it is clear that this is not the same as a
next-friend suit. The Court relies on the fact that respondent "[was] deprived under California law of the right to sue as next friend." Ante,
at 17. The same Superior Court that determined that respondent could
not sue as next friend stated:

Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment
Appeals' Article III standing decision and the prudentialprohibition on third-party standing provide no basis for denying respondent standing.Although the Court may have succeeded in confining this
novel principle almost narrowly enough to be, like the pro-verbial excursion ticket--good for this day only--our doctrine of prudential standing should be governed by generalprinciples, rather than ad hoc improvisations.

The Pledge of Allegiance reads:

"I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States ofAmerica, and to the Republic for which it stands, one

Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justicefor all." 4 U. S. C. $ 4.

As part of an overall effort to "codify and emphasize existingrules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the
flag of the United States of America," see H. R. Rep.No. 2047, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1942); S. Rep. No. 1477,

ch. 297, $ 7, 68 Stat. 249. The amendment's sponsor, Repre-sentative Rabaut, said its purpose was to contrast this country's belief in God with the Soviet Union's embrace of athe-ism. 100 Cong. Rec. 1700 (1954). We do not know what

any way that this court could preclude that.' " App. to Brief for Respondent Newdow B4.

The California court did not reject Newdow's right as distinct from his
daughter's, and we should not either.

other Members of Congress thought about the purpose of theamendment. Following the decision of the Court of Appeals

in this case, Congress passed legislation that made extensivefindings about the historic role of religion in the political development of the Nation and reaffirmed the text of thePledge. Act of Nov. 13, 2002, Pub. L. 107-293, $$ 1-2, 116
Stat. 2057-2060. To the millions of people who regularly re-cite the Pledge, and who have no access to, or concern with,
such legislation or legislative history, "under God" mightmean several different things: that God has guided the destiny of the United States, for example, or that the UnitedStates exists under God's authority. How much consideration anyone gives to the phrase probably varies, since thePledge itself is a patriotic observance focused primarily on
the flag and the Nation, and only secondarily on the descrip-tion of the Nation.

The phrase "under God" in the Pledge seems, as a histori-cal matter, to sum up the attitude of the Nation's leaders,
and to manifest itself in many of our public observances.Examples of patriotic invocations of God and official acknowledgments of religion's role in our Nation's history abound.At George Washington's first inauguration on April 30,
1789, he

"stepped toward the iron rail, where he was to receivethe oath of office. The diminutive secretary of the Senate, Samuel Otis, squeezed between the President andChancellor Livingston and raised up the crimson cushion
with a Bible on it. Washington put his right hand onthe Bible, opened to Psalm 121:1: `I raise my eyes toward
the hills. Whence shall my help come.' The Chancel-lor proceeded with the oath: `Do you solemnly swear
that you will faithfully execute the office of President ofthe United States and will to the best of your ability
preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of theUnited States?' The President responded, `I solemnly
swear,' and repeated the oath, adding, `So help me God.'

He then bent forward and kissed the Bible before him."M. Riccards, A Republic, If You Can Keep It: The

Foundation of the American Presidency, 1700-1800,pp. 73-74 (1987).

Later the same year, after encouragement from Congress,3Washington issued his first Thanksgiving proclamation,
which began:

"Whereas it is the duty of all Nations to acknowledgethe providence of Almighty God, to obey his will, to be

grateful for his benefits, and humbly to implore his pro-tection and favor--and whereas both Houses of Congress have by their joint Committee requested me `torecommend to the People of the United States a day of

for their safety and happiness.' " 4 Papers of GeorgeWashington 131: Presidential Series (W. Abbot &
D. Twohig eds. 1993).
Almost all succeeding Presidents have issued similarThanksgiving proclamations.

Later Presidents, at critical times in the Nation's history,have likewise invoked the name of God. Abraham Lincoln,
concluding his masterful Gettysburg Address in 1863, usedthe very phrase "under God":

"It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great taskremaining before us--that from these honored dead we
take increased devotion to that cause for which they

President Washington to proclaim `a day of public thanksgiving and

people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."1 Documents of American History 429 (H. Commager
ed. 8th ed. 1968).
Lincoln's equally well-known second inaugural address, de-livered on March 4, 1865, makes repeated references to God,

concluding with these famous words:

"With malice toward none, with charity for all, withfirmness in the right as God gives us to see the right,

Woodrow Wilson appeared before Congress in April 1917,to request a declaration of war against Germany. He finished with these words:

The motto "In God We Trust" first appeared on the country's coins during the Civil War. Secretary of the Treasury
Salmon P. Chase, acting under the authority of an Act of
Congress passed in 1864, prescribed that the motto should
appear on the two cent coin. The motto was placed on more
and more denominations, and since 1938 all United States
coins bear the motto. Paper currency followed suit at a
slower pace; Federal Reserve notes were so inscribed during
the decade of the 1960's. Meanwhile, in 1956, Congress declared that the motto of the United States would be "In God
we Trust." Act of July 30, 1956, ch. 795, 70 Stat. 732.

Our Court Marshal's opening proclamation concludes with
the words " `God save the United States and this honorable
Court.' " The language goes back at least as far as 1827.

Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment
All of these events strongly suggest that our national cul-ture allows public recognition of our Nation's religious history and character. In the words of the House Report thataccompanied the insertion of the phrase "under God" in the
Pledge: "From the time of our earliest history our peoplesand our institutions have reflected the traditional concept
that our Nation was founded on a fundamental belief in God."H. R. Rep. No. 1693, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1954). Giving
additional support to this idea is our national anthem TheStar-Spangled Banner, adopted as such by Congress in 1931.

"Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,

As pointed out by the Court, California law requires publicelementary schools to "conduc[t] . . . appropriate patriotic
exercises" at the beginning of the schoolday, and notes thatthe "giving of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America shall satisfy the requirements ofthis section." Cal. Educ. Code Ann. $ 52720 (West 1989).
The School District complies with this requirement by in-structing that "[e]ach elementary school class recite the
[P]ledge of [A]llegiance to the [F]lag once each day." App.149 -150. Students who object on relig i ous (or other)
grounds may abstain from the recitation. West Virginia Bd.of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 642 (1943) (holding that
the government may not compel school students to recitethe Pledge).

Notwithstanding the voluntary nature of the School Dis-trict policy, the Court of Appeals, by a divided vote, held
that the policy violates the Establishment Clause of the FirstAmendment because it "impermissibly coerces a religious

act." Newdow v. U. S. Congress, 328 F. 3d 466, 487 (CA92003). To reach this result, the court relied primarily on

our decision in Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577 (1992). Thatcase arose out of a graduation ceremony for a public high
school in Providence, Rhode Island. The ceremony beganwith an invocation and ended with a benediction, both given
by a local rabbi. The Court held that even though attend-ance at the ceremony was voluntary, students who objected
to the prayers would nonetheless feel coerced to attend andto stand during each prayer. But the Court throughout its
opinion referred to the prayer as "an explicit religious exer-cise,"

id., at 598, and "a formal religious exercise," id., at 589.As the Court notes in its opinion, "the Pledge of Allegiance evolved as a common public acknowledgment of theideals that our flag symbolizes. Its recitation is a patriotic
exercise designed to foster national unity and pride in thoseprinciples." Ante, at 6.

I do not believe that the phrase "under God" in the Pledgeconverts its recital into a "religious exercise" of the sort described in Lee. Instead, it is a declaration of belief in alle-giance and loyalty to the United States flag and the Republic
that it represents. The phrase "under God" is in no sensea prayer, nor an endorsement of any religion, but a simple
recognition of the fact noted in H. R. Rep. No. 1693, at 2:"From the time of our earliest history our peoples and our
institutions have reflected the traditional concept that ourNation was founded on a fundamental belief in God." Reciting the Pledge, or listening to others recite it, is a patrioticexercise, not a religious one; participants promise fidelity to
our flag and our Nation, not to any particular God, faith,or church.

Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment
There is no doubt that respondent is sincere in his atheismand rejection of a belief in God. But the mere fact that he

disagrees with this part of the Pledge does not give him aveto power over the decision of the public schools that willing participants should pledge allegiance to the flag in themanner prescribed by Congress. There may be others who
disagree, not with the phrase "under God," but with thephrase "with liberty and justice for all." But surely that
would not give such objectors the right to veto the holdingof such a ceremony by those willing to participate. Only if
it can be said that the phrase "under God" somehow tendsto the establishment of a religion in violation of the First
Amendment can respondent's claim succeed, where onebased on objections to "with liberty and justice for all" fails.
Our cases have broadly interpreted this phrase, but none
have gone anywhere near as far as the decision of the Courtof Appeals in this case. The recital, in a patriotic ceremony

pledging allegiance to the flag and to the Nation, of the de-scriptive phrase "under God" cannot possibly lead to the establishment of a religion, or anything like it.

When courts extend constitutional prohibitions beyondtheir previously recognized limit, they may restrict democratic choices made by public bodies. Here, Congress pre-scribed a Pledge of Allegiance, the State of California required patriotic observances in its schools, and the School
319 U. S., at 629. There was no opportunity to opt out, as there is in the
present case. "Failure to conform [was] `insubordination' dealt with by
expulsion. Readmission [was] denied by statute until compliance. Meanwhile the expelled child [was] `unlawfully absent' and [could] be proceeded
against as a delinquent. His parents or guardians [were] liable to prosecution, and if convicted [were] subject to a fine not exceeding $50 and jail
term not exceeding thirty days." Ibid. (footnotes omitted). I think
there is a clear difference between compulsion (Barnette) and coercion
(Lee). Compulsion, after Barnette, is not permissible, and it is not an
issue in this case. And whatever the virtues and vices of Lee, the Court
was concerned only with "formal religious exercise[s]," 505 U. S., at 589,
which the Pledge is not.

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
District chose to comply by requiring teacher-led recital ofthe Pledge of Allegiance by willing students. Thus, we have

three levels of popular government--the national, the state,and the local--collaborating to produce the Elk Grove ceremony. The Constitution only requires that schoolchildrenbe entitled to abstain from the ceremony if they chose to do
so. To give the parent of such a child a sort of "heckler's
veto" over a patriotic ceremony willingly participated in byother students, simply because the Pledge of Allegiance contains the descriptive phrase "under God," is an unwarrantedextension of the Establishment Clause, an extension which
would have the unfortunate effect of prohibiting a commend-able patriotic observance.

Justice O'Connor, concurring in the judgment.
I join the concurrence of The Chief Justice in full.
Like him, I would follow our policy of deferring to the Federal Courts of Appeals in matters that involve the interpretation of state law, see Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U. S.
879 (1988), and thereby conclude that respondent Newdow
does have standing to bring his constitutional claim before a
federal court. Like The Chief Justice, I believe that we
must examine those questions, and, like him, I believe that
petitioner school district's policy of having its teachers lead
students in voluntary recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance
does not offend the Establishment Clause. But while the
history presented by The Chief Justice illuminates the
constitutional problems this case presents, I write separately
to explain the principles that guide my own analysis of the
constitutionality of that policy.

As I have said before, the Establishment Clause "cannot
easily be reduced to a single test. There are different
categories of Establishment Clause cases, which may call for
different approaches." Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U. S. 687, 720 (1994) (concurring opinion). When a court confronts a challenge to

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
government-sponsored speech or displays, I continue to believe that the endorsement test "captures the essential command of the Establishment Clause, namely, that government
must not make a person's religious beliefs relevant to his or
her standing in the political community by conveying a message `that religion or a particular religious belief is favored
or preferred.' " County of Allegheny v. American Civil
Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573,
627 (1989) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (quoting Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 70 (1985)
(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment)). In that context,
I repeatedly have applied the endorsement test, Capitol
Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753,
772-773 (1995) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in
judgment) (display of a cross in a plaza next to state capitol);
Allegheny, supra, at 625 (display of creche in county courthouse and menorah outside city and county buildings); Wallace, supra, at 69 (statute authorizing a meditative moment
of silence in classrooms); Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668,
688 (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurring) (inclusion of Nativity
scene in city government's Christmas display), and I would
do so again here.

Endorsement, I have explained, "sends a message to nonadherents that they are outsiders, not full members of the
political community, and an accompanying message to adherents that they are insiders, favored members of the political
community." Ibid. In order to decide whether endorsement has occurred, a reviewing court must keep in mind two
crucial and related principles.

First, because the endorsement test seeks "to identify
those situations in which government makes adherence to a
religion relevant . . . to a person's standing in the political
community," it assumes the viewpoint of a reasonable observer. Pinette, 515 U. S., at 772 (internal quotation marks
omitted). Given the dizzying religious heterogeneity of our

35Cite as: 542 U. S. 1 (2004)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
Nation, adopting a subjective approach would reduce the test
to an absurdity. Nearly any government action could be
overturned as a violation of the Establishment Clause if a
"heckler's veto" sufficed to show that its message was one of
endorsement. See id., at 780 ("There is always someone
who, with a particular quantum of knowledge, reasonably
might perceive a particular action as an endorsement of religion"). Second, because the "reasonable observer" must
embody a community ideal of social judgment, as well as rational judgment, the test does not evaluate a practice in isolation from its origins and context. Instead, the reasonable
observer must be deemed aware of the history of the conduct
in question, and must understand its place in our Nation's
cultural landscape. See id., at 781.

The Court has permitted government, in some instances,
to refer to or commemorate religion in public life. See, e. g.,
Pinette, supra; Allegheny, supra; Lynch, supra; Marsh v.
Chambers, 463 U. S. 783 (1983). While the Court's explicit
rationales have varied, my own has been consistent; I believe
that although these references speak in the language of religious belief, they are more properly understood as employing the idiom for essentially secular purposes. One such
purpose is to commemorate the role of religion in our history.
In my view, some references to religion in public life and
government are the inevitable consequence of our Nation's
origins. Just as the Court has refused to ignore changes
in the religious composition of our Nation in explaining the
modern scope of the Religion Clauses, see, e. g., Wallace,
supra, at 52-54 (even if the Religion Clauses were originally
meant only to forestall intolerance between Christian sects,
they now encompass all forms of religious conscience), it
should not deny that our history has left its mark on our
national traditions. It is unsurprising that a Nation founded
by religious refugees and dedicated to religious freedom
should find references to divinity in its symbols, songs, mot542US1 Unit: $U58 [10-25-06 12:50:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
toes, and oaths.* Eradicating such references would sever
ties to a history that sustains this Nation even today. See
Allegheny, supra, at 623 (declining to draw lines that would
"sweep away all government recognition and acknowledgment of the role of religion in the lives of our citizens").

Facially religious references can serve other valuable purposes in public life as well. Twenty years ago, I wrote that
such references "serve, in the only ways reasonably possible
in our culture, the legitimate secular purposes of solemnizing
public occasions, expressing confidence in the future, and encouraging the recognition of what is worthy of appreciation
in society." Lynch, supra, at 692-693 (concurring opinion).
For centuries, we have marked important occasions or pronouncements with references to God and invocations of divine assistance. Such references can serve to solemnize an
occasion instead of to invoke divine provenance. The reasonable observer discussed above, fully aware of our national
history and the origins of such practices, would not perceive
these acknowledgments as signifying a government endorsement of any specific religion, or even of religion over
nonreligion.

There are no de minimis violations of the Constitution--
no constitutional harms so slight that the courts are obliged

*Note, for example, the following state mottoes: Arizona ("God Enriches"); Colorado ("Nothing without Providence"); Connecticut ("He Who
Transplanted Still Sustains"); Florida ("In God We Trust"); Ohio ("With
God All Things Are Possible"); and South Dakota ("Under God the People
Rule"). Arizona, Colorado, and Florida have placed their mottoes on their
state seals, and the mottoes of Connecticut and South Dakota appear on
the flags of those States as well. Georgia's newly redesigned flag includes
the motto "In God We Trust." The oaths of judicial office, citizenship,
and military and civil service all end with the (optional) phrase "[S]o help
me God." See 28 U. S. C. $ 453; 5 U. S. C. $ 3331; 10 U. S. C. $ 502; 8 CFR

God our King"); America the Beautiful ("God shed his grace on thee"); and
God bless America.

to ignore them. Given the values that the EstablishmentClause was meant to serve, however, I believe that government can, in a discrete category of cases, acknowledge orrefer to the divine without offending the Constitution. This
category of "ceremonial deism" most clearly encompassessuch things as the national motto ("In God We Trust"), religious references in traditional patriotic songs such as The
Star-Spangled Banner, and the words with which the Mar-shal of this Court opens each of its sessions ("God save the

United States and this honorable Court"). See Allegheny,
492 U. S., at 630 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). These references are not minor trespasses upon the Establishment Clause to which I turn a
blind eye. Instead, their history, character, and context prevent them from being constitutional violations at all.

This case requires us to determine whether the appearance of the phrase "under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance
constitutes an instance of such ceremonial deism. Although
it is a close question, I conclude that it does, based on my
evaluation of the following four factors.

History and Ubiquity

The constitutional value of ceremonial deism turns on a
shared understanding of its legitimate nonreligious purposes. That sort of understanding can exist only when a
given practice has been in place for a significant portion of
the Nation's history, and when it is observed by enough persons that it can fairly be called ubiquitous. See Lynch, 465
U. S., at 693. By contrast, novel or uncommon references to
religion can more easily be perceived as government endorsements because the reasonable observer cannot be presumed to be fully familiar with their origins. As a result,
in examining whether a given practice constitutes an instance of ceremonial deism, its "history and ubiquity" will be
of great importance. As I explained in Allegheny, supra,
at 630-631:

542US1 Unit: $U58 [10-25-06 12:50:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
38 ELK GROVE UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. v. NEWDOW

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
"Under the endorsement test, the `history and ubiquity'of a practice is relevant not because it creates an `artificial exception' from that test. On the contrary, the `his-tory and ubiquity' of a practice is relevant because it
provides part of the context in which a reasonable ob-server evaluates whether a challenged governmental
practice conveys a message of endorsement of religion."
Fifty years have passed since the words "under God" wereadded, a span of time that is not inconsiderable given the

relative youth of our Nation. In that time, the Pledge hasbecome, alongside the singing of The Star-Spangled Banner,
our most routine ceremonial act of patriotism; countlessschoolchildren recite it daily, and their religious heterogeneity reflects that of the Nation as a whole. As a result, thePledge and the context in which it is employed are familiar
and nearly inseparable in the public mind. No reasonableobserver could have been surprised to learn the words of the
Pledge, or that petitioner school district has a policy of lead-ing its students in daily recitation of the Pledge.

It cannot be doubted that "no one acquires a vested orprotected right in violation of the Constitution by long use,
even when that span of time covers our entire national exist-ence and indeed predates it. Yet an unbroken practice . . .
is not something to be lightly cast aside." Walz v. Tax
Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664, 678 (1970). Andthe history of a given practice is all the more relevant when

the practice has been employed pervasively without engen-dering significant controversy. In Lynch, where we evaluated the constitutionality of a town Christmas display thatincluded a creche, we found relevant to the endorsement
question the fact that the display had "apparently caused nopolitical divisiveness prior to the filing of this lawsuit" despite its use for over 40 years. See 465 U. S., at 692-693.Similarly, in the 50 years that the Pledge has been recited as
it is now, by millions of children, this was, at the time of itsfiling, only the third reported case of which I am aware to

challenge it as an impermissible establishment of religion.See

Sherman v. Community Consol. School Dist. 21, 980
F. 2d 437 (CA7 1992); Smith v. Denny, 280 F. Supp. 651 (EDCal. 1968). The citizens of this Nation have been neither

timid nor unimaginative in challenging government practicesas forbidden "establishments" of religion. See,

e. g., Altman

(challenging, among other things, reading of a story of theHindu deity Ganesha in a fourth-grade classroom);

Allen, 760 F. 2d 447, 449 (CA2 1985) (challenge to conviction
for vandalism of B-52 bomber, based on theory that

Gordon Parks, in high school English literature class); Crowley v. Smithsonian Inst., 636 F. 2d 738 (CADC 1980) (challenge to museum display that explained the concept of evolution). Given the vigor and creativity of such challenges,
I find it telling that so little ire has been directed at the
Pledge.

Absence of worship or prayer

"[O]ne of the greatest dangers to the freedom of the individual to worship in his own way [lies] in the Government's
placing its official stamp of approval upon one particular kind
of prayer or one particular form of religious services."

40 ELK GROVE UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. v. NEWDOW

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
Engel v. Vitale, 370 U. S. 421, 429 (1962). Because of thisprinciple, only in the most extraordinary circumstances could

actual worship or prayer be defended as ceremonial deism.We have upheld only one such prayer against Establishment
Clause challenge, and it was supported by an extremely longand unambiguous history. See

Marsh v. Chambers, 463
U. S. 783 (1983) (upholding Nebraska Legislature's 128-yearold practice of opening its sessions with a prayer offered bya chaplain). Any statement that has as its purpose placing

the speaker or listener in a penitent state of mind, or that isintended to create a spiritual communion or invoke divine
aid, strays from the legitimate secular purposes of solemnizing an event and recognizing a shared religious history.
Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe, 530 U. S. 290, 309
(2000) ("[T]he use of an invocation to foster . . . solemnity
is impermissible when, in actuality, it constitutes [statesponsored] prayer").

Of course, any statement can be imbued by a speaker or
listener with the qualities of prayer. But, as I have explained, the relevant viewpoint is that of a reasonable observer, fully cognizant of the history, ubiquity, and context
of the practice in question. Such an observer could not conclude that reciting the Pledge, including the phrase "under
God," constitutes an instance of worship. I know of no religion that incorporates the Pledge into its canon, nor one that
would count the Pledge as a meaningful expression of religious faith. Even if taken literally, the phrase is merely descriptive; it purports only to identify the United States as a
Nation subject to divine authority. That cannot be seen as
a serious invocation of God or as an expression of individual
submission to divine authority. Cf. Engel, supra, at 424 (describing prayer as "a solemn avowal of divine faith and supplication for the blessings of the Almighty"). A reasonable
observer would note that petitioner school district's policy
of Pledge recitation appears under the heading of "Patriotic
Exercises," and the California law which it implements re542US1 Unit: $U58 [10-25-06 12:50:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

fers to "appropriate patriotic exercises." Cal. Educ. CodeAnn. $ 52720 (West 1989). Petitioner school district also employs teachers, not chaplains or religious instructors, to leadits students' exercise; this serves as a further indication that
it does not treat the Pledge as a prayer. Cf. Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577, 594 (1992) (reasoning that a graduation
benediction could not be construed as a de minimis religious
exercise without offending the rabbi who offered it).It is true that some of the legislators who voted to add the

phrase "under God" to the Pledge may have done so in anattempt to attach to it an overtly religious message. See
H. R. Rep. No. 1693, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 2-3 (1954). But
their intentions cannot, on their own, decide our inquiry.
First of all, those legislators also had permissible secular objectives in mind--they meant, for example, to acknowledge
the religious origins of our Nation's belief in the "individuality and the dignity of the human being." Id., at 1. Second--and more critically--the subsequent social and cultural
history of the Pledge shows that its original secular character was not transformed by its amendment. In School Dist.
of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203 (1963), we
explained that a government may initiate a practice "for the
impermissible purpose of supporting religion" but nevertheless "retai[n] the la[w] for the permissible purpose of furthering overwhelmingly secular ends." Id., at 263-264 (citing
McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420 (1961)). Whatever the
sectarian ends its authors may have had in mind, our continued repetition of the reference to "one Nation under God"
in an exclusively patriotic context has shaped the cultural
significance of that phrase to conform to that context. Any
religious freight the words may have been meant to carry
originally has long since been lost. See Lynch, 465 U. S.,
at 716 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (suggesting that the reference to God in the Pledge might be permissible because it
has "lost through rote repetition any significant religious
content").

Absence of reference to particular religion

"The clearest command of the Establishment Clause isthat one religious denomination cannot be officially preferred

over another." Larson v. Valente, 456 U. S. 228, 244 (1982).While general acknowledgments of religion need not be
viewed by reasonable observers as denigrating the nonreli-gious, the same cannot be said of instances "where the endorsement is sectarian, in the sense of specifying detailsupon which men and women who believe in a benevolent,
omnipotent Creator and Ruler of the world are known todiffer."

Weisman, supra, at 641 (Scalia, J., dissenting).As a result, no religious acknowledgment could claim to be

an instance of ceremonial deism if it explicitly favored oneparticular religious belief system over another.

The Pledge complies with this requirement. It does not
refer to a nation "under Jesus" or "under Vishnu," but in-stead acknowledges religion in a general way: a simple reference to a generic "God." Of course, some religions--Bud-dhism, for instance--are not based upon a belief in a separate
Supreme Being. See Brief for Buddhist Temples et al. as
Amici Curiae 15-16. But one would be hard pressed to
imagine a brief solemnizing reference to religion that would
adequately encompass every religious belief expressed byany citizen of this Nation. The phrase "under God," conceived and added at a time when our national religious diver-sity was neither as robust nor as well recognized as it is now,
represents a tolerable attempt to acknowledge religion andto invoke its solemnizing power without favoring any individual religious sect or belief system.
Minimal religious content

A final factor that makes the Pledge an instance of ceremonial deism, in my view, is its highly circumscribed referenceto God. In most of the cases in which we have struck down

government speech or displays under the Establishment
Clause, the offending religious content has been much more

pervasive. See, e. g., Weisman, supra, at 581-582 (prayers
involving repeated thanks to God and requests for blessings).
Of course, a ceremony cannot avoid Establishment Clause
scrutiny simply by avoiding an explicit mention of God. See
Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38 (1985) (invalidating Alabama
statute providing moment of silence for meditation or voluntary prayer). But the brevity of a reference to religion or
to God in a ceremonial exercise can be important for several
reasons. First, it tends to confirm that the reference is
being used to acknowledge religion or to solemnize an event
rather than to endorse religion in any way. Second, it
makes it easier for those participants who wish to "opt out"
of language they find offensive to do so without having to
reject the ceremony entirely. And third, it tends to limit
the ability of government to express a preference for one
religious sect over another.

The reference to "God" in the Pledge of Allegiance qualifies as a minimal reference to religion; Newdow's challenge
focuses on only two of the Pledge's 31 words. Moreover, the
presence of those words is not absolutely essential to the
Pledge, as demonstrated by the fact that it existed without
them for over 50 years. As a result, students who wish to
avoid saying the words "under God" still can consider themselves meaningful participants in the exercise if they join in
reciting the remainder of the Pledge.

I have framed my inquiry as a specific application of the
endorsement test by examining whether the ceremony or
representation would convey a message to a reasonable observer, familiar with its history, origins, and context, that
those who do not adhere to its literal message are political
outsiders. But consideration of these factors would lead me
to the same result even if I were to apply the "coercion"
test that has featured in several opinions of this Court.

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
The coercion test provides that, "at a minimum, . . . government may not coerce anyone to support or participate
in religion or its exercise, or otherwise act in a way which
`establishes a [state] religion or religious faith, or tends to
do so.' " Id., at 587 (quoting Lynch, 465 U. S., at 678). Any
coercion that persuades an onlooker to participate in an act
of ceremonial deism is inconsequential, as an Establishment
Clause matter, because such acts are simply not religious in
character. As a result, symbolic references to religion that
qualify as instances of ceremonial deism will pass the coercion test as well as the endorsement test. This is not to say,
however, that government could overtly coerce a person to
participate in an act of ceremonial deism. Our cardinal freedom is one of belief; leaders in this Nation cannot force us to
proclaim our allegiance to any creed, whether it be religious,
philosophic, or political. That principle found eloquent expression in a case involving the Pledge itself, even before it
contained the words to which Newdow now objects. See
West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 642 (1943)
(Jackson, J.). The compulsion of which Justice Jackson was
concerned, however, was of the direct sort--the Constitution
does not guarantee citizens a right entirely to avoid ideas
with which they disagree. It would betray its own principles if it did; no robust democracy insulates its citizens from
views that they might find novel or even inflammatory.

Michael Newdow's challenge to petitioner school district's
policy is a well-intentioned one, but his distaste for the reference to "one Nation under God," however sincere, cannot be
the yardstick of our Establishment Clause inquiry. Certain
ceremonial references to God and religion in our Nation are
the inevitable consequence of the religious history that gave
birth to our founding principles of liberty. It would be
ironic indeed if this Court were to wield our constitutional

Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.
We granted certiorari in this case to decide whether theElk Grove Unified School District's Pledge policy violates the

Constitution. The answer to that question is: "no." But ina testament to the condition of our Establishment Clause
jurisprudence, the Court of Appeals reached the oppositeconclusion based on a persuasive reading of our precedent,
especially Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577 (1992). In my view,
Lee adopted an expansive definition of "coercion" that cannotbe defended however one decides the "difficult question" of

"[w]hether and how th[e Establishment] Clause should con-strain state action under the Fourteenth Amendment." Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U. S. 639, 678 (2002) (Thomas,J., concurring). The difficulties with our Establishment
Clause cases, however, run far deeper than Lee.1Because I agree with

The Chief Justice that respondentNewdow has standing, I would take this opportunity to

begin the process of rethinking the Establishment Clause.I would acknowledge that the Establishment Clause is a federalism provision, which, for this reason, resists incorpora1 This is by no means a novel observation. See, e. g., Rosenberger v.
Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 861 (1995) (Thomas, J.,
concurring) (noting that "our Establishment Clause jurisprudence is in
hopeless disarray"); Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School
Dist., 508 U. S. 384, 398-401 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).
We have selectively invoked particular tests, such as the "Lemon test,"
Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (1971), with predictable outcomes.
See, e. g., Lamb's Chapel, supra, at 398-401 (Scalia, J., concurring in
judgment). Our jurisprudential confusion has led to results that can only
be described as silly. In County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573 (1989), for example,
the Court distinguished between a creche on the one hand and an 18-foot
Chanukah menorah placed near a 45-foot Christmas tree on the other.
The Court held that the first display violated the Establishment Clause
but that the second did not.

tion. Moreover, as I will explain, the Pledge policy is notimplicated by any sensible incorporation of the Establishment Clause, which would probably cover little more thanthe Free Exercise Clause.

I
In Lee, the Court held that invocations and benedictionscould not, consistent with the Establishment Clause, be

given at public secondary school graduations. The Courtemphasized "heightened concerns with protecting freedom
of conscience from subtle coercive pressure in the elemen-tary and secondary public schools." 505 U. S., at 592. It
brushed aside both the fact that the students were not re-quired to attend the graduation, see id., at 586 (asserting
that student "attendance and participation in" the gradua-tion ceremony "are in a fair and real sense obligatory"), and
the fact that they were not compelled, in any meaningfulsense, to participate in the religious component of the graduation ceremony, see id., at 593 ("What matters is that, givenour social conventions, a reasonable dissenter in this milieu
could believe that the group exercise signified her own par-ticipation or approval of it"). The Court surmised that the
prayer violated the Establishment Clause because a highschool student could--in light of the "peer pressure" to attend graduation and "to stand as a group or, at least, main-tain respectful silence during the invocation and benediction," ibid.--have "a reasonable perception that she is beingforced by the State to pray in a manner her conscience will
not allow," ibid.Adherence to

Lee would require us to strike down thePledge policy, which, in most respects, poses more serious

difficulties than the prayer at issue in Lee. A prayer atgraduation is a one-time event, the graduating students are
almost (if not already) adults, and their parents are usuallypresent. By contrast, very young students, removed from
the protection of their parents, are exposed to the Pledgeeach and every day.

47Cite as: 542 U. S. 1 (2004)
Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
Moreover, this case is more troubling than Lee with respect to both kinds of "coercion." First, although students
may feel "peer pressure" to attend their graduations, the
pressure here is far less subtle: Students are actually compelled (that is, by law, and not merely "in a fair and real
sense," id., at 586) to attend school. See also School Dist.
of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203, 223 (1963).

Analysis of the second form of "coercion" identified in Lee
is somewhat more complicated. It is true that since this
Court decided West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S.
624 (1943), States cannot compel (in the traditional sense)
students to pledge their allegiance. Formally, then, dissenters can refuse to pledge, and this refusal would be clear to
onlookers.2 That is, students have a theoretical means of
opting out of the exercise. But as Lee indicated: "Research
in psychology supports the common assumption that adolescents are often susceptible to pressure from their peers towards conformity . . . ." 505 U. S., at 593-594. On Lee's
reasoning, Barnette's protection is illusory, for government
officials can allow children to recite the Pledge and let peer
pressure take its natural and predictable course. Further,
even if we assume that sitting in respectful silence could be
mistaken for assent to or participation in a graduation
prayer, dissenting students graduating from high school are
not "coerced" to pray. At most, they are "coerced" into possibly appearing to assent to the prayer. The "coercion"
here, however, results in unwilling children actually pledging their allegiance.3

2 Of course, as Lee and subsequent cases make clear, " `[l]aw reaches
past formalism.' " Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe, 530 U. S.
290, 311 (2000) (quoting Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577, 595 (1992)).

3 Surely the "coercion" to pledge (where failure to do so is immediately

obvious to one's peers) is far greater than the "coercion" resulting from a
student-initiated and student-led prayer at a high school football game.

48 ELK GROVE UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. v. NEWDOW

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
The Chief Justice would distinguish Lee by asserting"that the phrase `under God' in the Pledge [does not] conver[t] its recital into a `religious exercise' of the sort de-scribed in

Lee." Ante, at 31 (opinion concurring in judgment). In Barnette, the Court addressed a state law thatcompelled students to salute and pledge allegiance to the

flag. The Court described this as "compulsion of students to
declare a belief." 319 U. S., at 631. The Pledge "require[d]affirmation of a belief and an attitude of mind."

Id., at 633.
In its current form, reciting the Pledge entails pledging alle-giance to "the Flag of the United States of America, and to

the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God." 4
U. S. C. $ 4. Under Barnette, pledging allegiance is "to declare a belief " that now includes that this is "one Nation
under God." It is difficult to see how this does not entail
an affirmation that God exists. Whether or not we classify
affirming the existence of God as a "formal religious exercise" akin to prayer, it must present the same or similar constitutional problems.

To be sure, such an affirmation is not a prayer, and I admit
that this might be a significant distinction. But the Court
has squarely held that the government cannot require a person to "declare his belief in God." Torcaso v. Watkins, 367
U. S. 488, 489 (1961); id., at 495 ("We repeat and again reaffirm that neither a State nor the Federal Government can
constitutionally force a person `to profess a belief or disbelief
in any religion' "); see also Employment Div., Dept. of
Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872, 877 (1990)
("The government may not compel affirmation of religious
belief "); Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263, 269-270, n. 6
(1981) (rejecting attempt to distinguish worship from other
forms of religious speech). And the Court has said, in my
view questionably, that the Establishment Clause "prohibits
government from appearing to take a position on questions
of religious belief." County of Allegheny v. American Civil
Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573,

594 (1989). See also Good News Club v. Milford CentralSchool, 533 U. S. 98, 126-127 (2001) (

Scalia, J., concurring).I conclude that, as a matter of our precedent, the Pledge

policy is unconstitutional. I believe, however, that Lee waswrongly decided.

Lee depended on a notion of "coercion"that, as I discuss below, has no basis in law or reason. The

kind of coercion implicated by the Religion Clauses is thataccomplished

"by force of law and threat of penalty." 505U. S., at 640 (

Scalia, J., dissenting); see id., at 640-645.Peer pressure, unpleasant as it may be, is not coercion. But

rejection of Lee-style "coercion" does not suffice to settle thiscase. Although children are not coerced to pledge their allegiance, they are legally coerced to attend school. Cf., e. g.,
Schempp, supra; Engel v. Vitale, 370 U. S. 421 (1962). Be-cause what is at issue is a state action, the question becomes

whether the Pledge policy implicates a religious liberty rightprotected by the Fourteenth Amendment.

II
I accept that the Free Exercise Clause, which clearly pro-tects an individual right, applies against the States through

the Fourteenth Amendment. See Zelman, 536 U. S., at 679,and n. 4 (

Thomas, J., concurring). But the EstablishmentClause is another matter. The text and history of the Establishment Clause strongly suggest that it is a federalismprovision intended to prevent Congress from interfering
with state establishments. Thus, unlike the Free ExerciseClause, which does protect an individual right, it makes little
sense to incorporate the Establishment Clause. In any case,I do not believe that the Pledge policy infringes any religious
liberty right that would arise from incorporation of theClause. Because the Pledge policy also does not infringe
any free-exercise rights, I conclude that it is constitutional.

A
The Establishment Clause provides that "Congress shallmake no law respecting an establishment of relig i on. "

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
Amdt. 1. As a textual matter, this Clause probably prohib-its Congress from establishing a national religion. But see

P. Hamburger, Separation of Church and State 106, n. 40(2002) (citing sources). Perhaps more importantly, the
Clause made clear that Congress could not interfere withstate establishments, notwithstanding any argument that
could be made based on Congress' power under the Necessary and Proper Clause. See A. Amar, The Bill of Rights36-39 (1998).

Nothing in the text of the Clause suggests that it reachesany further. The Establishment Clause does not purport to
protect individual rights. By contrast, the Free Exercise
Clause plainly protects individuals against congressional interference with the right to exercise their religion, and the
remaining Clauses within the First Amendment expressly
disable Congress from "abridging [particular] freedom[s]."
(Emphasis added.) This textual analysis is consistent with
the prevailing view that the Constitution left religion to the
States. See, e. g., 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States $ 1873 (5th ed. 1891); see also Amar,
The Bill of Rights, at 32-42; id., at 246-257. History also
supports this understanding: At the founding, at least six
States had established religions, see McConnell, The Origins
and Historical Understanding of Free Exercise of Religion,
103 Harv. L. Rev. 1409, 1437 (1990). Nor has this federalism
point escaped the notice of Members of this Court. See,
e. g., Zelman, supra, at 677-680 (Thomas, J., concurring);
Lee, supra, at 641 (Scalia, J., dissenting).

Quite simply, the Establishment Clause is best understood
as a federalism provision--it protects state establishments
from federal interference but does not protect any individual
right. These two features independently make incorporation of the Clause difficult to understand. The best argument in favor of incorporation would be that, by disabling
Congress from establishing a national religion, the Clause
protected an individual right, enforceable against the Fed542US1 Unit: $U58 [10-25-06 12:50:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

51Cite as: 542 U. S. 1 (2004)
Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
eral Government, to be free from coercive federal establish-ments. Incorporation of this individual right, the argument

goes, makes sense. I have alluded to this possibility before.See

Zelman, supra, at 679 (Thomas, J., concurring) ("States
may pass laws that include or touch on religious matters solong as these laws do not impede free exercise rights

or any
other individual liberty interest" (emphasis added)).

But even assuming that the Establishment Clause pre-cludes the Federal Government from establishing a national

religion, it does not follow that the Clause created or pro-tects any individual right. For the reasons discussed above,
it is more likely that States and only States were the direct
beneficiaries. See also Lee, supra, at 641 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Moreover, incorporation of this putative individual right leads to a peculiar outcome: It would prohibit
precisely what the Establishment Clause was intended to
protect--state establishments of religion. See Schempp,
374 U. S., at 310 (Stewart, J., dissenting) (noting that "the
Fourteenth Amendment has somehow absorbed the Establishment Clause, although it is not without irony that a constitutional provision evidently designed to leave the States
free to go their own way should now have become a restriction upon their autonomy"). Nevertheless, the potential
right against federal establishments is the only candidate
for incorporation.

I would welcome the opportunity to consider more fully
the difficult questions whether and how the Establishment
Clause applies against the States. One observation suffices
for now: As strange as it sounds, an incorporated Establishment Clause prohibits exactly what the Establishment
Clause protected--state practices that pertain to "an establishment of religion." At the very least, the burden of persuasion rests with anyone who claims that the term took on
a different meaning upon incorporation. We must therefore
determine whether the Pledge policy pertains to an "establishment of religion."

B
The traditional "establishments of religion" to which theEstablishment Clause is addressed necessarily involve actual

legal coercion:

"The coercion that was a hallmark of historical estab-lishments of religion was coercion of religious orthodoxy

and of financial support by force of law and threat ofpenalty. Typically, attendance at the state church was
required; only clergy of the official church could lawfullyperform sacraments; and dissenters, if tolerated, faced
an array of civil disabilities. L. Levy, The Establish-ment Clause 4 (1986). Thus, for example, in the Colony
of Virginia, where the Church of England had been es-tablished, ministers were required by law to conform to
the doctrine and rites of the Church of England; and allpersons were required to attend church and observe the
Sabbath, were tithed for the public support of Anglicanministers, and were taxed for the costs of building and
repairing churches. Id., at 3-4." Lee, 505 U. S., at640-641 (

Scalia, J., dissenting).

Even if "establishment" had a broader definition, one thatincluded support for religion generally through taxation, the

element of legal coercion (by the State) would still be pres-ent. See

id., at 641.It is also conceivable that a government could "establish"

a religion by imbuing it with governmental authority, see,e. g., Larkin v. Grendel's Den, Inc., 459 U. S. 116 (1982), or
by "delegat[ing] its civic authority to a group chosen accord-ing to a religious criterion," Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel
Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U. S. 687, 698 (1994);County of Allegheny, 492 U. S., at 590-591. A religious organization that carries some measure of the authority of theState begins to look like a traditional "religious establishment," at least when that authority can be used coercively.See also

Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U. S. 306, 319 (1952) (Black,

J., dissenting) (explaining that the Establishment Clause "in-sure[s] that no one powerful sect or combination of sects

could use political or governmental power to punish dissent-ers whom they could not convert to their faith" (emphasis
added)).It is difficult to see how government practices that have
nothing to do with creating or maintaining the sort of coercive state establishment described above implicate the possi-ble liberty interest of being free from coercive state establishments. In addressing the constitutionality of voluntaryschool prayer, Justice Stewart made essentially this point,
emphasizing that "we deal here not with the establishmentof a state church, . . . but with whether school children who
want to begin their day by joining in prayer must be prohib-ited from doing so."

Engel, 370 U. S., at 445 (dissenting
opinion).4To be sure, I find much to commend the view that the

Establishment Clause "bar[s] governmental preferences for
particular religious faiths." Rosenberger v. Rector and
Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 856 (1995) (Thomas,
J., concurring). But the position I suggest today is consistent with this. Legal compulsion is an inherent component
of "preferences" in this context. James Madison's Memorial
and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments (re4 It may well be the case that anything that would violate the incorporated Establishment Clause would actually violate the Free Exercise
Clause, further calling into doubt the utility of incorporating the Establishment Clause. See, e. g., A. Amar, The Bill of Rights 253-254 (1998).
Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577 (1992), could be thought of this way to the
extent that anyone might have been "coerced" into a religious exercise.
Cf. Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U. S. 306, 311 (1952) (rejecting as "obtuse reasoning" a free-exercise claim where "[n]o one is forced to go to the religious classroom and no religious exercise or instruction is brought to the
classrooms of the public schools"); ibid. (rejecting coercion-based Establishment Clause claim absent evidence that "teachers were using their
office to persuade or force students to take the religious instruction" (emphasis added)).

printed in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1,63-72 (1947) (appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.)), which extolled the no-preference argument, concerned coercive tax-ation to support an established religion, much as its title
implies.5 And, although "more extreme notions of theseparation of church and state [might] be attribut[able] to
Madison, many of them clearly stem from `arguments re-flecting the concepts of natural law, natural rights, and the
social contract between government and a civil society,'[R. Cord, Separation of Church and State: Historical Fact
and Current Fiction 22 (1982)], rather than the principle ofnonestablishment in the Constitution."

Rosenberger, supra,at 856 (
Thomas, J., concurring). See also Hamburger, Sepa-ration of Church and State, at 105 (noting that Madison's

proposed language for what became the EstablishmentClause did not reflect his more extreme views).

C
Through the Pledge policy, the State has not created ormaintained any religious establishment, and neither has it

granted government authority to an existing religion. ThePledge policy does not expose anyone to the legal coercion
associated with an established religion. Further, no otherfree-exercise rights are at issue. It follows that religious
liberty rights are not in question and that the Pledge policyfully comports with the Constitution.

5 Again, coercive government preferences might also implicate the Free
Exercise Clause and are perhaps better analyzed in that framework.

NORTON, SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, et al. v.SOUTHERN UTAH WILDERNESS ALLIANCE

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 03-101. Argued March 29, 2004--Decided June 14, 2004
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), an Interior Department agency,

manages the Utah land at issue here under the Federal Land Policy and
Management Act of 1976. Pursuant to 43 U. S. C. $ 1782, the Secretary
of the Interior has identified certain federal lands as "wilderness study
areas" (WSAs) and recommended some of these as suitable for wilderness designation. Land designated as wilderness by Act of Congress
enjoys special protection; until Congress acts, the Secretary must "manage [WSAs] . . . so as not to impair the[ir] suitability . . . for preservation
as wilderness." $ 1782(c). In addition, each WSA or other area is managed "in accordance with" a land use plan, $ 1732(a), a BLM document
which generally describes, for a particular area, allowable uses, goals
for the land's future condition, and next steps. 43 CFR $ 1601.0-5(k).
Respondents Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance and others (collectively SUWA) sought declaratory and injunctive relief for BLM's failure
to act to protect Utah public lands from environmental damage caused
by off-road vehicles (ORVs), asserting three claims relevant here, and
contending that they could sue under the Administrative Procedure Act
(APA) to "compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably
delayed," 5 U. S. C. $ 706(1). The Tenth Circuit reversed the District
Court's dismissal of the claims.

Held: BLM's alleged failures to act are not remediable under the APA.

Pp. 61-73.

(a) A $ 706(1) claim can proceed only where a plaintiff asserts that an
agency failed to take a discrete agency action that it is required to take.
The discrete-action limitation precludes a broad programmatic attack
such as that rejected in Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497
U. S. 871, and the required-action limitation rules out judicial direction
of even discrete agency action that is not demanded by law. Pp. 61-65.

(b) SUWA first claims that BLM violated $ 1782(c)'s nonimpairment
mandate by permitting ORV use in certain WSAs. While $ 1782(c) is
mandatory as to the object to be achieved, it leaves BLM discretion to
decide how to achieve that object. SUWA argues that the nonimpairment mandate will support an APA suit, but a general deficiency in
compliance lacks the requisite specificity. The principal purpose of this

limitation is to protect agencies from undue judicial interference with
their lawful discretion and to avoid judicial entanglement in abstract
policy disagreements which courts lack the expertise and information to
resolve. If courts were empowered to enter general orders compelling
compliance with broad statutory mandates, they would necessarily be
empowered to decide whether compliance was achieved. The APA does
not contemplate such pervasive federal-court oversight. Pp. 65-67.

(c) SUWA also claims that BLM's failure to comply with provisions
of its land use plans contravenes the requirement that the Secretary
manage public lands in accordance with such plans, 43 U. S. C. $ 1732(a).
A land use plan, however, is a tool to project present and future use.
Unlike a specific statutory command requiring an agency to promulgate
regulations by a certain date, a land use plan is generally a statement
of priorities; it guides and restrains actions, but does not prescribe
them. A statement about what BLM plans to do, if it has funds and
there are not more pressing priorities, cannot be plucked out of context
and made a basis for a $ 706(1) suit. The land use plan statements at
issue here are not a legally binding commitment enforceable under

$ 706(1). Pp. 67-72.

(d) SUWA finally contends that BLM did not fulfill its obligation
under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to take a "hard
look" at whether to undertake supplemental environmental analyses for
areas where ORV use had increased. Because the applicable regulation
requires an environmental impact statement (EIS) to be supplemented
where there "are significant new circumstances or information relevant
to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its
impacts," 40 CFR $ 1502.9(c)(1)(ii), an agency must take a "hard look"
at new information to assess the need for supplementation, Marsh v.
Oregon Natural Resources Council, 490 U. S. 360, 385. However, supplementation is required only if "there remains major Federal actio[n]
to occur," id., at 374. Since the BLM's approval of a land use plan is
the "action" that requires an EIS, once a plan has been approved, there
is no ongoing "major Federal actio[n]" that could require supplementation. Pp. 72-73.

Opinion of the Court
public lands under certain statutory provisions and its own
planning documents.

I

Almost half the State of Utah, about 23 million acres, is
federal land administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), an agency within the Department of Interior.
For nearly 30 years, BLM's management of public lands has
been governed by the Federal Land Policy and Management
Act of 1976 (FLPMA), 90 Stat. 2744, 43 U. S. C. $ 1701 et seq.,
which "established a policy in favor of retaining public lands
for multiple use management." Lujan v. National Wildlife
Federation, 497 U. S. 871, 877 (1990). "Multiple use management" is a deceptively simple term that describes the enormously complicated task of striking a balance among the
many competing uses to which land can be put, "including,
but not limited to, recreation, range, timber, minerals, watershed, wildlife and fish, and [uses serving] natural scenic,
scientific and historical values." 43 U. S. C. $ 1702(c). A
second management goal, "sustained yield," requires BLM
to control depleting uses over time, so as to ensure a high
level of valuable uses in the future. $ 1702(h). To these
ends, FLPMA establishes a dual regime of inventory and
planning. Sections 1711 and 1712, respectively, provide for
a comprehensive, ongoing inventory of federal lands, and
for a land use planning process that "project[s]" "present
and future use," $ 1701(a)(2), given the lands' inventoried
characteristics.

Of course not all uses are compatible. Congress made the
judgment that some lands should be set aside as wilderness
at the expense of commercial and recreational uses. A preFLPMA enactment, the Wilderness Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 890,
provides that designated wilderness areas, subject to certain
exceptions, "shall [have] no commercial enterprise and no
permanent road," no motorized vehicles, and no manmade
structures. 16 U. S. C. $ 1133(c). The designation of a wil542US1 Unit: $U59 [11-01-06 14:23:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

59Cite as: 542 U. S. 55 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
derness area can be made only by Act of Congress, see 43U. S. C. $ 1782(b).

Pursuant to $ 1782, the Secretary of the Interior (Sec-retary) has identified so-called "wilderness study areas"
(WSAs), roadless lands of 5,000 acres or more that possess"wilderness characteristics," as determined in the Secretary's land inventory. $ 1782(a); see 16 U. S. C. $ 1131(c).
As the name suggests, WSAs (as well as certain wild landsidentified prior to the passage of FLPMA) have been subjected to further examination and public comment in orderto evaluate their suitability for designation as wilderness.
In 1991, out of 3.3 million acres in Utah that had been identified for study, 2 million were recommended as suitable for
wilderness designation. 1 U. S. Dept. of Interior, BLM,
Utah Statewide Wilderness Study Report 3 (Oct. 1991).
This recommendation was forwarded to Congress, which has
not yet acted upon it. Until Congress acts one way or the
other, FLPMA provides that "the Secretary shall continue
to manage such lands . . . in a manner so as not to impair the
suitability of such areas for preservation as wilderness." 43
U. S. C. $ 1782(c). This nonimpairment mandate applies to
all WSAs identified under $ 1782, including lands considered
unsuitable by the Secretary. See $$ 1782(a), (b); App. 64
(BLM Interim Management Policy for Lands Under Wilderness Review).

Aside from identification of WSAs, the main tool that BLM
employs to balance wilderness protection against other uses
is a land use plan--what BLM regulations call a "resource
management plan." 43 CFR $ 1601.0-5(k) (2003). Land
use plans, adopted after notice and comment, are "designed
to guide and control future management actions," $ 1601.0-2.
See 43 U. S. C. $ 1712; 43 CFR $ 1610.2 (2003). Generally, a
land use plan describes, for a particular area, allowable uses,
goals for future condition of the land, and specific next steps.

$ 1601.0-5(k). Under FLPMA, "[t]he Secretary shall manage the public lands under principles of multiple use and sus542US1 Unit: $U59 [11-01-06 14:23:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tained yield, in accordance with the land use plans . . . whenthey are available." 43 U. S. C. $ 1732(a).

Protection of wilderness has come into increasing conflictwith another element of multiple use, recreational use of
so-called off-road vehicles (ORVs), which include vehiclesprimarily designed for off-road use, such as lightweight,
four-wheel "all-terrain vehicles," and vehicles capable of
such use, such as sport utility vehicles. See 43 CFR$ 8340.0-5(a) (2003). According to the United States Forest

Service's most recent estimates, some 42 million Americansparticipate in off-road travel each year, more than double the
number two decades ago. H. Cordell, Outdoor Recreation
for 21st Century America 40 (2004). United States sales
of all-terrain vehicles alone have roughly doubled in the past
five years, reaching almost 900,000 in 2003. See Tanz,
Making Tracks, Making Enemies, N. Y. Times, Jan. 2, 2004,
p. F1, col. 5; Discover Today's Motorcycling, Motorcycle
Industry Council, Press Release (Feb. 13, 2004), http://
www.motorcycles.org (all Internet materials as visited June
4, 2004, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). The use
of ORVs on federal land has negative environmental consequences, including soil disruption and compaction, harassment of animals, and annoyance of wilderness lovers. See
Brief for Natural Resources Defense Council et al. as Amici
Curiae 4-7, and studies cited therein. Thus, BLM faces a
classic land use dilemma of sharply inconsistent uses, in a
context of scarce resources and congressional silence with
respect to wilderness designation.

In 1999, respondents Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance
and other organizations (collectively SUWA) filed this action
in the United States District Court for Utah against petitioners BLM, its Director, and the Secretary. In its second
amended complaint, SUWA sought declaratory and injunctive relief for BLM's failure to act to protect public lands in
Utah from damage caused by ORV use. SUWA made three
claims that are relevant here: (1) that BLM had violated its

61Cite as: 542 U. S. 55 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
nonimpairment obligation under $ 1782(c) by allowing degra-dation in certain WSAs; (2) that BLM had failed to implement provisions in its land use plans relating to ORV use;and (3) that BLM had failed to take a "hard look" at whether,
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969(NEPA), 83 Stat. 852, 42 U. S. C. $ 4321 et seq., it should undertake supplemental environmental analyses for areas inwhich ORV use had increased. SUWA contended that it
could sue to remedy these three failures to act pursuant tothe APA's provision of a cause of action to "compel agency
action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed." 5U. S. C. $ 706(1).

The District Court entered a dismissal with respect to thethree claims. A divided panel of the Tenth Circuit reversed.
301 F. 3d 1217 (2002). The majority acknowledged thatunder $ 706(1), "federal courts may order agencies to act only
where the agency fails to carry out a mandatory, nondiscre-tionary duty."

Id., at 1226. It concluded, however, thatBLM's nonimpairment obligation was just such a duty, and

therefore BLM could be compelled to comply. Under simi-lar reasoning, it reversed the dismissal with respect to the
land use plan claim; and likewise reversed dismissal of theNEPA claim. We granted certiorari. 540 U. S. 980 (2003).

II
All three claims at issue here involve assertions that BLMfailed to take action with respect to ORV use that it was

required to take. Failures to act are sometimes remediableunder the APA, but not always. We begin by considering
what limits the APA places upon judicial review of agencyinaction.

The APA authorizes suit by "[a] person suffering legalwrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevantstatute." 5 U. S. C. $ 702. Where no other statute provides
a private right of action, the "agency action" complained

542US1 Unit: $U59 [11-01-06 14:23:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN
62 NORTON v. SOUTHERN UTAH WILDERNESS ALLIANCE

Opinion of the Court
of must be "final agency action." $ 704 (emphasis added)."[A]gency action" is defined in $ 551(13) to include "the whole

or a part of an agency rule, order, license, sanction, relief, orthe equivalent or denial thereof,

or failure to act." (Emphasis added.) The APA provides relief for a failure to act in$ 706(1): "The reviewing court shall . . . compel agency action

unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed."

Sections 702, 704, and 706(1) all insist upon an "agencyaction," either as the action complained of (in $$ 702 and 704)

or as the action to be compelled (in $ 706(1)). The definitionof that term begins with a list of five categories of decisions
made or outcomes implemented by an agency--"agency rule,
order, license, sanction [or] relief." $ 551(13). All of those
categories involve circumscribed, discrete agency actions, as
their definitions make clear: "an agency statement of . . .
future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe
law or policy" (rule); "a final disposition . . . in a matter other
than rule making" (order); a "permit . . . or other form of
permission" (license); a "prohibition . . . or . . . taking [of]
other compulsory or restrictive action" (sanction); or a
"grant of money, assistance, license, authority," etc., or "recognition of a claim, right, immunity," etc., or "taking of other
action on the application or petition of, and beneficial to, a
person" (relief). $$ 551(4), (6), (8), (10), (11).

The terms following those five categories of agency
action are not defined in the APA: "or the equivalent or
denial thereof, or failure to act." $ 551(13). But an "equivalent . . . thereof " must also be discrete (or it would not
be equivalent), and a "denial thereof " must be the denial of
a discrete listed action (and perhaps denial of a discrete
equivalent).

The final term in the definition, "failure to act," is in our
view properly understood as a failure to take an agency
action--that is, a failure to take one of the agency actions
(including their equivalents) earlier defined in $ 551(13).
Moreover, even without this equation of "act" with "agency

63Cite as: 542 U. S. 55 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
action" the interpretive canon of ejusdem generis would at-tribute to the last item ("failure to act") the same characteristic of discreteness shared by all the preceding items. See,e. g., Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs. v.
Guardianship Estate of Keffeler, 537 U. S. 371, 384-385(2003). A "failure to act" is not the same thing as a "denial."
The latter is the agency's act of saying no to a request; theformer is simply the omission of an action without formally
rejecting a request--for example, the failure to promulgatea rule or take some decision by a statutory deadline. The
important point is that a "failure to act" is properly under-stood to be limited, as are the other items in $ 551(13), to a
discrete action.A second point central to the analysis of the present case
is that the only agency action that can be compelled underthe APA is action legally

required. This limitation appearsin $ 706(1)'s authorization for courts to "compel agency action

unlawfully withheld." 1 (Emphasis added.) In this regardthe APA carried forward the traditional practice prior to its
passage, when judicial review was achieved through use ofthe so-called prerogative writs--principally writs of mandamus under the All Writs Act, now codified at 28 U. S. C.$ 1651(a). The mandamus remedy was normally limited to
enforcement of "a specific, unequivocal command," ICC v.
New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., 287 U. S. 178, 204 (1932), theordering of a " `precise, definite act . . . about which [an official] had no discretion whatever,' " United States ex rel.Dunlap v. Black, 128 U. S. 40, 46 (1888) (quoting Kendall v.
United States ex rel. Stokes, 12 Pet. 524, 613 (1838)). Seealso

ICC v. United States ex rel. Humboldt S. S. Co., 224U. S. 474, 484 (1912). As described in the Attorney General's Manual on the APA, a document whose reasoning wehave often found persuasive, see, e. g., Darby v. Cisneros, 509

1 Of course $ 706(1) also authorizes courts to "compel agency action . . .
unreasonably delayed"--but a delay cannot be unreasonable with respect
to action that is not required.

Opinion of the Court
U. S. 137, 148, n. 10 (1993); Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U. S.
281, 302, n. 31 (1979); Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.
v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 435 U. S. 519,
546 (1978), $ 706(1) empowers a court only to compel an
agency "to perform a ministerial or non-discretionary act,"
or "to take action upon a matter, without directing how it
shall act." Attorney General's Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act 108 (1947) (emphasis added). See also L.
Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action 372 (1965);
K. Davis, Administrative Law $ 257, p. 925 (1951).

Thus, a claim under $ 706(1) can proceed only where a
plaintiff asserts that an agency failed to take a discrete
agency action that it is required to take. These limitations
rule out several kinds of challenges. The limitation to discrete agency action precludes the kind of broad programmatic attack we rejected in Lujan v. National Wildlife
Federation, 497 U. S. 871 (1990). There we considered
a challenge to BLM's land withdrawal review program,
couched as unlawful agency "action" that the plaintiffs
wished to have "set aside" under $ 706(2).2 Id., at 879. We
concluded that the program was not an "agency action":

"[R]espondent cannot seek wholesale improvement of
this program by court decree, rather than in the offices
of the Department or the halls of Congress, where programmatic improvements are normally made. Under
the terms of the APA, respondent must direct its attack
against some particular `agency action' that causes it
harm." Id., at 891 (emphasis in original).

2 Title 5 U. S. C. $ 706(2) provides, in relevant part:
"The reviewing court shall--. . . . .

"(2) hold unlawful and set aside agency action . . . found to be--
"(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in
accordance with law . . . ."

65Cite as: 542 U. S. 55 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
The plaintiffs in National Wildlife Federation would have
fared no better if they had characterized the agency's alleged
"failure to revise land use plans in proper fashion" and "failure to consider multiple use," ibid., in terms of "agency action unlawfully withheld" under $ 706(1), rather than agency
action "not in accordance with law" under $ 706(2).

The limitation to required agency action rules out judicial
direction of even discrete agency action that is not demanded
by law (which includes, of course, agency regulations that
have the force of law). Thus, when an agency is compelled
by law to act within a certain time period, but the manner
of its action is left to the agency's discretion, a court can
compel the agency to act, but has no power to specify what
the action must be. For example, 47 U. S. C. $ 251(d)(1),
which required the Federal Communications Commission "to
establish regulations to implement" interconnection requirements "[w]ithin 6 months" of the date of enactment of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, would have supported a judicial decree under the APA requiring the prompt issuance
of regulations, but not a judicial decree setting forth the content of those regulations.

III

A

With these principles in mind, we turn to SUWA's first
claim, that by permitting ORV use in certain WSAs, BLM
violated its mandate to "continue to manage [WSAs] . . . in
a manner so as not to impair the suitability of such areas for
preservation as wilderness," 43 U. S. C. $ 1782(c). SUWA
relies not only upon $ 1782(c) but also upon a provision of
BLM's Interim Management Policy for Lands Under Wilderness Review, which interprets the nonimpairment mandate
to require BLM to manage WSAs so as to prevent them from
being "degraded so far, compared with the area's values for
other purposes, as to significantly constrain the Congress's

66 NORTON v. SOUTHERN UTAH WILDERNESS ALLIANCE

Opinion of the Court
prerogative to either designate [it] as wilderness or releaseit for other uses." App. 65.

Section 1782(c) is mandatory as to the object to beachieved, but it leaves BLM a great deal of discretion in
deciding how to achieve it. It assuredly does not mandate,with the clarity necessary to support judicial action under

$ 706(1), the total exclusion of ORV use.

SUWA argues that $ 1782 does contain a categorical im-perative, namely, the command to comply with the nonimpairment mandate. It contends that a federal court couldsimply enter a general order compelling compliance with
that mandate, without suggesting any particular manner of
compliance. It relies upon the language from the Attorney
General's Manual quoted earlier, that a court can "take action upon a matter, without directing how [the agency] shall
act," and upon language in a case cited by the Manual noting
that "mandamus will lie . . . even though the act required
involves the exercise of judgment and discretion," Safeway
Stores, Inc. v. Brown, 138 F. 2d 278, 280 (Emerg. Ct. App.
1943). The action referred to in these excerpts, however, is
discrete agency action, as we have discussed above. General
deficiencies in compliance, unlike the failure to issue a ruling
that was discussed in Safeway Stores, lack the specificity
requisite for agency action.

The principal purpose of the APA limitations we have discussed--and of the traditional limitations upon mandamus
from which they were derived--is to protect agencies from
undue judicial interference with their lawful discretion, and
to avoid judicial entanglement in abstract policy disagreements which courts lack both expertise and information to
resolve. If courts were empowered to enter general orders
compelling compliance with broad statutory mandates, they
would necessarily be empowered, as well, to determine
whether compliance was achieved--which would mean that
it would ultimately become the task of the supervising court,
rather than the agency, to work out compliance with the

67Cite as: 542 U. S. 55 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
broad statutory mandate, injecting the judge into day-to-dayagency management. To take just a few examples from federal resources management, a plaintiff might allege that theSecretary had failed to "manage wild free-roaming horses
and burros in a manner that is designed to achieve and main-tain a thriving natural ecological balance," or to "manage
the [New Orleans Jazz National] [H]istorical [P]ark in sucha manner as will preserve and perpetuate knowledge and
understanding of the history of jazz," or to "manage the[Steens Mountain] Cooperative Management and Protection
Area for the benefit of present and future generations." 16U. S. C. $$ 1333(a), 410bbb-2(a)(1), 460nnn-12(b). The prospect of pervasive oversight by federal courts over the man-ner and pace of agency compliance with such congressional
directives is not contemplated by the APA.

B
SUWA's second claim is that BLM failed to comply withcertain provisions in its land use plans, thus contravening

the requirement that "[t]he Secretary shall manage the pub-lic lands . . . in accordance with the land use plans . . . when
they are available." 43 U. S. C. $ 1732(a); see also 43 CFR$ 1610.5-3(a) (2003) ("All future resource management authorizations and actions . . . and subsequent more detailed orspecific planning, shall conform to the approved plan"). The
relevant count in SUWA's second amended complaint allegedthat BLM had violated a variety of commitments in its land
use plans, but over the course of the litigation these havebeen reduced to two, one relating to the 1991 resource management plan for the San Rafael area, and the other to vari-ous aspects of the 1990 ORV implementation plan for the
Henry Mountains area.The actions contemplated by the first of these alleged commitments (completion of a route designation plan in the SanRafael area), and by one aspect of the second (creation of
"use supervision files" for designated areas in the Henry

Mountains area) have already been completed,3 and theseclaims are therefore moot. There remains the claim, with

respect to the Henry Mountains plan, that "in light of dam-age from ORVs in the Factory Butte area," a sub-area of
Henry Mountains open to ORV use, "the [plan] obligatedBLM to conduct an intensive ORV monitoring program."
Brief for SUWA 7-8. This claim is based upon the plan'sstatement that the Factory Butte area "will be monitored
and closed if warranted." App. 140. SUWA does not con-test BLM's assertion in the court below that informal monitoring has taken place for some years, see Brief for AppelleeSecretary of Interior et al. in No. 01-4009 (CA10), p. 23, but
it demands continuing implementation of a monitoring program. By this it apparently means to insist upon adherenceto the plan's general discussion of "Use Supervision and

Monitoring" in designated areas, App. 148-149, which (in ad-dition to calling for the use supervision files that have already been created) provides that "[r]esource damage will bedocumented and recommendations made for corrective action," "[m]onitoring in open areas will focus on determining
damage which may necessitate a change in designation," and"emphasis on use supervision will be placed on [limited and

closed areas]." Id., at 149. SUWA acknowledges that amonitoring program has recently been

commenced. Brief
for SUWA 12. In light, however, of the continuing action

relevant BLM field office, noting the establishment of monitoring files for
the Henry Mountains area); Brief for Respondent SUWA et al. 12 (hereinafter Brief for SUWA) (acknowledging completion of these actions).

It is arguable that the complaint sought not merely creation but continuing maintenance of use supervision files, in which case (for the reasons set
forth with respect to the ORV monitoring program later in text) that claim
would not be moot. If so, what we say below with regard to the merits
of the ORV monitoring claim would apply equally to the use supervision
file claim.

Opinion of the Court
that existence of a "program" contemplates, and in light ofBLM's contention that the program cannot be compelled

under $ 706(1), this claim cannot be considered moot.The statutory directive that BLM manage "in accordance
with" land use plans, and the regulatory requirement thatauthorizations and actions "conform to" those plans, prevent
BLM from taking actions inconsistent with the provisions of
a land use plan. Unless and until the plan is amended, suchactions can be set aside as contrary to law pursuant to 5

U. S. C. $ 706(2). The claim presently under discussion, how-ever, would have us go further, and conclude that a statement in a plan that BLM "will" take this, that, or the otheraction, is a binding commitment that can be compelled under

$ 706(1). In our view it is not--at least absent clear indica-tion of binding commitment in the terms of the plan.

FLPMA describes land use plans as tools by which "pres-ent and future use is

projected." 43 U. S. C. $ 1701(a)(2) (emphasis added). The implementing regulations make clear
that land use plans are a preliminary step in the overall process of managing public lands--"designed to guide and control
future management actions and the development of subsequent, more detailed and limited scope plans for resources
and uses." 43 CFR $ 1601.0-2 (2003). The statute and regulations confirm that a land use plan is not ordinarily
the medium for affirmative decisions that implement the
agency's "project[ions]." 4 Title 43 U. S. C. $ 1712(e) provides
that "[t]he Secretary may issue management decisions to implement land use plans"--the decisions, that is, are distinct
from the plan itself. Picking up the same theme, the regula4 The exceptions "are normally limited to those required by regulation,
such as designating [ORV] areas, roads, and trails (see 43 CFR 8342)."

tion defining a land use plan declares that a plan "is not afinal implementation decision on actions which require further specific plans, process steps, or decisions under specificprovisions of law and regulations." 43 CFR $ 1601.0-5(k)
(2003). The BLM's Land Use Planning Handbook specifiesthat land use plans are normally not used to make sitespecific implementation decisions. See Handbook II-2.

Plans also receive a different agency review process fromimplementation decisions. Appeal to the Department's

Board of Land Appeals is available for "a specific actionbeing proposed to implement some portion of a resource
management plan or amendment." 43 CFR $ 1610.5-3(b)
(2003). However, the Board, which reviews "decisions rendered by Departmental officials relating to . . . [t]he use and
disposition of public lands and their resources," $ 4.1(b)(3)(i),
does not review the approval of a plan, since it regards a
plan as a policy determination, not an implementation decision. See, e. g., Wilderness Society, 109 I. B. L. A. 175, 178
(1989); Wilderness Society, 90 I. B. L. A. 221, 224 (1986); see
also Handbook II-2, IV-3. Plans are protested to the BLM
director, not appealed.

The San Rafael plan provides an apt illustration of the immense scope of projected activity that a land use plan can
embrace. Over 100 pages in length, it presents a comprehensive management framework for 1.5 million acres of
BLM-administered land. Twenty categories of resource
management are separately discussed, including mineral extraction, wilderness protection, livestock grazing, preservation of cultural resources, and recreation. The plan lays out
an ambitious agenda for the preparation of additional, more
detailed plans and specific next steps for implementation.
Its introduction notes that "[a]n [ORV] implementation plan
is scheduled to be prepared within 1 year following approval
of the [San Rafael plan]." San Rafael Plan 9. Similarly
"scheduled for preparation" are activity plans for certain environmentally sensitive areas, "along with allotment man542US1 Unit: $U59 [11-01-06 14:23:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

agement plans, habitat management plans, a fire manage-ment plan, recreation management plans . . . , cultural

resource management plans for selected sites, watershed ac-tivity plans, and the wild and scenic river management plan."
Ibid. The projected schedule set forth in the plan shows"[a]nticipated [i]mplementation" of some future plans within
one year, others within three years, and still others, such as
certain recreation and cultural resource management plans,at a pace of "one study per fiscal year."

Id., at 95-102.
Quite unlike a specific statutory command requiring anagency to promulgate regulations by a certain date, a land

use plan is generally a statement of priorities; it guides and
constrains actions, but does not (at least in the usual case)
prescribe them. It would be unreasonable to think that
either Congress or the agency intended otherwise, since land
use plans nationwide would commit the agency to actions far
in the future, for which funds have not yet been appropriated. Some plans make explicit that implementation of
their programmatic content is subject to budgetary constraints. See Brief for Petitioners 42-43, and n. 18 (quoting
from such plans). While the Henry Mountains plan does not
contain such a specification, we think it must reasonably be
implied. A statement by BLM about what it plans to do, at
some point, provided it has the funds and there are not more
pressing priorities, cannot be plucked out of context and
made a basis for suit under $ 706(1).

Of course, an action called for in a plan may be compelled
when the plan merely reiterates duties the agency is already
obligated to perform, or perhaps when language in the plan
itself creates a commitment binding on the agency. But
allowing general enforcement of plan terms would lead to
pervasive interference with BLM's own ordering of priorities. For example, a judicial decree compelling immediate
preparation of all of the detailed plans called for in the San
Rafael plan would divert BLM's energies from other projects
throughout the country that are in fact more pressing. And

542US1 Unit: $U59 [11-01-06 14:23:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN
72 NORTON v. SOUTHERN UTAH WILDERNESS ALLIANCE

Opinion of the Court
while such a decree might please the environmental plaintiffsin the present case, it would ultimately operate to the detriment of sound environmental management. Its predictableconsequence would be much vaguer plans from BLM in the
future--making coordination with other agencies more diffi-cult, and depriving the public of important information concerning the agency's long-range intentions.We therefore hold that the Henry Mountains plan's statements to the effect that BLM will conduct "Use Supervisionand Monitoring" in designated areas--like other "will do"
projections of agency action set forth in land use plans--arenot a legally binding commitment enforceable under $ 706(1).
That being so, we find it unnecessary to consider whether theaction envisioned by the statements is sufficiently discrete to
be amenable to compulsion under the APA.5

IV
Finally, we turn to SUWA's contention that BLM failed tofulfill certain obligations under NEPA. Before addressing

whether a NEPA-required duty is actionable under the APA,we must decide whether NEPA creates an obligation in the
first place. NEPA requires a federal agency to prepare anenvironmental impact statement (EIS) as part of any "proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions sig-nificantly affecting the quality of the human environment."
42 U. S. C. $ 4332(2)(C). Often an initial EIS is sufficient,but in certain circumstances an EIS must be supplemented.
See Marsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Council, 490 U. S.360, 370-374 (1989). A regulation of the Council on Environmental Quality requires supplementation where "[t]hereare significant new circumstances or information relevant to
environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed actionor its impacts." 40 CFR $ 1502.9(c)(1)(ii) (2003). In Marsh,

5 We express no view as to whether a court could, under $ 706(1), enforce
a duty to monitor ORV use imposed by a BLM regulation, see 43 CFR

$ 8342.3 (2003). That question is not before us.

73Cite as: 542 U. S. 55 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
we interpreted $ 4332 in light of this regulation to require anagency to take a "hard look" at the new information to assess

whether supplementation might be necessary. 490 U. S., at385; see id., at 378-385.

SUWA argues that evidence of increased ORV use is "sig-nificant new circumstances or information" that requires a
"hard look." We disagree. As we noted in Marsh, supple-mentation is necessary only if "there remains `major Federal
actio[n]' to occur," as that term is used in $ 4332(2)(C). Id.,at 374. In

Marsh, that condition was met: The dam con-struction project that gave rise to environmental review was

not yet completed. Here, by contrast, although the "[a]p-proval of a [land use plan]" is a "major Federal action" requiring an EIS, 43 CFR $ 1601.0-6 (2003) (emphasis added),that action is completed when the plan is approved. The
land use plan is the "proposed action" contemplated by theregulation. There is no ongoing "major Federal action" that
could require supplementation (though BLM is required toperform additional NEPA analyses if a plan is amended or
revised, see $$ 1610.5-5, 5-6).

UNITED STATES v. DOMINGUEZ BENITEZ
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 03-167. Argued April 21, 2004--Decided June 14, 2004
After respondent Dominguez Benitez (hereinafter Dominguez) confessed

to selling drugs to an informant, he was indicted on drug possession and
conspiracy counts. On the conspiracy count, he faced a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence. His plea agreement with the Government provided that Dominguez would plead guilty to conspiracy and the Government would dismiss the possession charge; that he would receive a
safety-valve reduction of two levels, which would allow the court to
authorize a sentence below the otherwise mandatory 10-year minimum;
that the agreement did not bind the sentencing court; and that he could
not withdraw his plea if the court rejected the Government's stipulations or recommendations. He pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge,
but, in the plea colloquy, the court failed to mention (though the written
plea agreement did say) that Dominguez could not withdraw his plea if
the court did not accept the Government's recommendations. See Fed.
Rule Crim. Proc. 11(c)(3)(B). The Probation Office subsequently found
that Dominguez had three prior convictions, making him ineligible for
the safety valve, so the District Court sentenced him to the mandatory
minimum. On appeal, Dominguez argued, for the first time, that the
District Court's failure to warn him, as Rule 11(c)(3)(B) instructs, that
he could not withdraw his plea if the court did not accept the Government's recommendations required reversal. The Ninth Circuit agreed,
citing United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, in applying Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 52's plain-error standard.

Held: To obtain relief for an unpreserved Rule 11 failing, a defendant must

show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have
pleaded guilty. Pp. 80-86.

(a) When a defendant is dilatory in raising Rule 11 error, reversal is
unwarranted unless the error is plain. United States v. Vonn, 535 U. S.
55, 63. Except for certain structural errors undermining the criminal
proceeding's fairness as a whole, relief for error is tied to prejudicial
effect, and the standard phrased as "error that affects substantial
rights," as used in Rule 52, means error with a prejudicial effect on a
judicial proceeding's outcome. See Kotteakos v. United States, 328
U. S. 750. Kotteakos held that to affect "substantial rights," an error
must have "substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining

Syllabus
the . . . verdict." Id., at 776. Where the burden of demonstrating prejudice (or materiality) is on the defendant seeking relief, this Court has
invoked a similar standard, which requires "a reasonable probability
that, but for [the error claimed], the result of the proceeding would have
been different" is required. United States v. Bagley, 473 U. S. 667, 682
(opinion of Blackmun, J.). For defendants such as Dominguez, the burden of establishing entitlement to plain-error relief should not be too
easy: First, the standard should enforce the policies underpinning Rule
52(b) generally, to encourage timely objections and reduce wasteful reversals by demanding strenuous exertion to get relief for unpreserved
error, see Vonn, supra, at 73; and second, it should respect the particular importance of the finality of guilty pleas, which usually rest on a
defendant's profession of guilt in open court, and are indispensable in
the modern criminal justice system's operation, see United States v.
Timmreck, 441 U. S. 780, 784. Pp. 80-83.

(b) The Ninth Circuit's test in this case fell short. Its first element
(whether the error was "minor or technical") requires no examination of
the omitted warning's effect on a defendant's decision, a failing repeated
to a significant extent by the test's second element (whether the defendant understood the rights at issue when he pleaded guilty). That
court's standard does not allow consideration of evidence tending to
show that a misunderstanding was inconsequential to a defendant's decision, or evidence indicating the relative significance of other facts that
may have borne on his choice regardless of any Rule 11 error. Nor
does it consider the overall strength of the Government's case. When,
as here, the record shows both a controlled drug sale to an informant
and a confession, one can fairly ask what a defendant seeking to withdraw his plea thought he could gain by going to trial. The point is not
to second-guess the defendant's actual decision, but to enquire whether
the omitted warning would have made the difference required by the
standard of reasonable probability; it is hard to see here how the warning could have affected Dominguez's assessment of his strategic position. Also, the plea agreement, read to Dominguez in his native Spanish, specifically warned that he could not withdraw his plea if the court
refused to accept the Government's recommendations; this fact, uncontested by Dominguez, tends to show that the Rule 11 error made no
difference to the outcome here. Pp. 83-86.

76 UNITED STATES v. DOMINGUEZ BENITEZ

Opinion of the Court
Dan Himmelfarb argued the cause for the United States.With him on the briefs were Solicitor General Olson, Assistant Attorney General Wray, and Deputy Solicitor GeneralDreeben.

Myra D. Mossman, by appointment of the Court, 540 U. S.1175, argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.*

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
Respondent claims the right to withdraw his plea of guiltyas a consequence of the District Court's failure to give one

of the warnings required by Federal Rule of Criminal Proce-dure 11. Because the claim of Rule 11 error was not preserved by timely objection, the plain-error standard of Rule52(b) applies, with its requirement to prove effect on substantial rights. The question is what showing must thus bemade to obtain relief for an unpreserved Rule 11 failing, and
we hold that a defendant is obliged to show a reasonable
probability that, but for the error, he would not have enteredthe plea.

I
In early May 1999, a confidential informant working with
law enforcement arranged through respondent Carlos Do-minguez Benitez (hereinafter Dominguez) to buy several

pounds of methamphetamine. First, the informant got a
sample from Dominguez, and a week later Dominguez wentto a restaurant in Anaheim, California, to consummate the

sale in the company of two confederates, one of whombrought a shopping bag with over a kilogram of the drugs.
The meeting ended when the informant gave a signal andofficers arrested the dealers. Dominguez confessed to selling the methamphetamine and gave information about hissupplier and confederates.

Opinion of the Court
A federal grand jury indicted Dominguez on two counts:conspiracy to possess more than 500 grams of methamphetamine, and possession of 1,391 grams of a methamphetaminemixture, both with intent to distribute. On the conspiracy
count, Dominguez faced a statutory, mandatory minimumsentence of 10 years, with a maximum of life. 84 Stat. 1260,
21 U. S. C. $$ 841(b)(1)(A), 846. The District Court ap-pointed counsel, who began talking with the Government
about a plea agreement.In September 1999, the District Court received the first of
several letters from Dominguez,1 in which he asked for a newlawyer and expressed discomfort with the plea agreement
his counsel was encouraging him to sign. On counsel's mo-tion, the court held a status conference, at which Dominguez
spoke to the judge. Again he said he was dissatisfied withhis representation, and wanted a "better deal." The court
asked whether he was "talking about a disposition . . . otherthan trial," and Dominguez answered, "At no time have I
decided to go to any trial." App. 46-47. Counsel spoke tothe same effect later in the proceeding, when he said that he
had "told [the prosecutor] all along that there won't be a trialon the [date set] based on my client's representations that he
doesn't want a trial." Id., at 51. The court explained toDominguez that it could not help him in plea negotiations,
and found no reason to change counsel.Shortly after that, the parties agreed that Dominguez
would plead guilty to the conspiracy, and the Governmentwould dismiss the possession charge. The Government stipulated that Dominguez would receive what is known as asafety-valve reduction of two levels. See United States
Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $$ 2D1.1(b)(6),

1 Dominguez speaks and writes Spanish, not English. A certified translator was present for the hearings in court we describe, and for the plea
agreement. Some of the letters are in English, and the record does not
show who translated them or assisted Dominguez in writing them.

Opinion of the Court
5C1.2 (Nov. 1999) (hereinafter USSG).2 The safety valvewas important because it would allow the court to invoke 18

U. S. C. $ 3553(f ), authorizing a sentence below the otherwisemandatory minimum in certain cases of diminished culpability, the only chance Dominguez had for a sentence under 10years. That chance turned on satisfying five conditions, one
going to Dominguez's criminal history, which the agreementdid not address. The agreement did, however, warn Dominguez that it did not bind the sentencing court, and that Do-minguez could not withdraw his plea if the court did not
accept the Government's stipulations or recommendations.At a hearing the next day, Dominguez changed his plea to
guilty. In the plea colloquy, the court gave almost all therequired Rule 11 warnings, including the warning that the
plea agreement did not bind the court, but the judge failedto mention that Dominguez could not withdraw his plea if
the court did not accept the Government's recommendations.See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(c)(3)(B).

3

When the Probation Office subsequently issued its report,it found that Dominguez had three prior convictions, two of

them under other names, which neither defense counsel northe prosecutor had known at the time of the plea negotiations. The upshot was that Dominguez was ineligible forthe safety valve, and so had no chance to escape the sentence
of 10 years. After receiving two more letters from Domin-guez complaining about the quality of counsel's representa2 The agreement also contemplated that Dominguez's total offense level
under the Guidelines would be 27, after considering the safety valve and
a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. Assuming so,
and assuming he had no (or minimal) criminal history, his sentence could
have been as low as 70 months. See USSG ch. 5, pt. A (sentencing table).

3 At the time of the plea hearing, the requirement appeared at Federal

Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(e)(2). It has not changed in substance.
We refer to the current Rule in the text of this opinion, and do likewise
for Rules 11(h) and 52(b), each of which has also received a stylistic
amendment.

Opinion of the Court
tion, the District Court sentenced Dominguez to the manda-tory minimum. At the sentencing hearing, all counsel told

the court that they had thought Dominguez might at leasthave been eligible for the safety-valve mitigation, but agreed
that with three convictions, he was not. Dominguez told the
court that he had "never had any knowledge about the points
of responsibility, the safety valve, or anything like that."
App. 109. The court replied that in light of the "lengthy
change of plea proceedings" it was "difficult . . . to accept
what" Dominguez said. Id., at 112.

On appeal, Dominguez argued that the District Court's
failure to warn him, as Rule 11(c)(3)(B) instructs, that he
could not withdraw his guilty plea if the court did not accept the Government's recommendations required reversal.
After waiting for United States v. Vonn, 535 U. S. 55 (2002),
a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
agreed, 310 F. 3d 1221 (2002), and cited United States v.
Olano, 507 U. S. 725 (1993), in applying the plain-error standard. The court held that the District Court had indeed
erred; and that the error was plain, affected Dominguez's
substantial rights, and required correction in the interests
of justice.

To show that substantial rights were affected, the Court
of Appeals required Dominguez to "prove that the court's
error was not minor or technical and that he did not understand the rights at issue when he entered his guilty plea."
310 F. 3d, at 1225.4 The court rejected the Government's
arguments that the written plea agreement or the District
Court's other statements in the plea colloquy sufficiently advised Dominguez of his rights, given Dominguez's inability
to speak English and the assurances of both counsel that
he would likely qualify under the safety-valve provision.
Judge Tallman dissented, with the warning that the majori4 Other Courts of Appeals employed different tests. See n. 8, infra.

ty's analysis followed neither Vonn nor Circuit precedent.310 F. 3d, at 1227-1228.

We granted certiorari, 540 U. S. 1072 (2003), on the ques-tion "[w]hether, in order to show that a violation of Federal
Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 constitutes reversible plainerror, a defendant must demonstrate that he would not have
pleaded guilty if the violation had not occurred." Pet. forCert. (I). We now reverse.

II

A
Because the Government agreed to make a nonbindingsentencing recommendation, Rule 11(c)(3)(B) required the

court to "advise the defendant that the defendant has noright to withdraw the plea if the court does not follow the
recommendation or request." Rule 11, however, instructsthat not every violation of its terms calls for reversal of conviction by entitling the defendant to withdraw his guiltyplea. "A variance from the requirements of this rule is
harmless error if it does not affect substantial rights." Fed.Rule Crim. Proc. 11(h).

5

In Vonn, we considered the standard that applies when adefendant is dilatory in raising Rule 11 error, and held that

reversal is not in order unless the error is plain. 535 U. S.,at 63; see

Olano, supra, at 731-737. Although we explainedthat in assessing the effect of Rule 11 error, a reviewing

court must look to the entire record, not to the plea proceed-ings alone, Vonn, supra, at 74-75, we did not formulate the
standard for determining whether a defendant has shown, asthe plain-error standard requires, Olano, supra, at 734-735,
an effect on his substantial rights.

5 Congress gave the courts this instruction in 1983, in partial response
to this Court's decision in McCarthy v. United States, 394 U. S. 459 (1969),
which it felt had caused too many reversals for reasons that were too
insubstantial. See United States v. Vonn, 535 U. S. 55, 66-71 (2002) (discussing the history of Rule 11(h)).

81Cite as: 542 U. S. 74 (2004)
Opinion of the Court

B
It is only for certain structural errors undermining the
fairness of a criminal proceeding as a whole that even preserved error requires reversal without regard to the mistake's effect on the proceeding. See Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 309-310 (1991) (giving examples).
Dominguez does not argue that either Rule 11 error generally or the Rule 11 error here is structural in this sense.6

Otherwise, relief for error is tied in some way to prejudicial effect, and the standard phrased as "error that affects
substantial rights," used in Rule 52, has previously been
taken to mean error with a prejudicial effect on the outcome
of a judicial proceeding. See Kotteakos v. United States, 328
U. S. 750 (1946). To affect "substantial rights," see 28
U. S. C. $ 2111, an error must have "substantial and injurious
effect or influence in determining the . . . verdict." Kotteakos, supra, at 776.7 In cases where the burden of demonstrating prejudice (or materiality) is on the defendant seeking relief, we have invoked a standard with similarities
to the Kotteakos formulation in requiring the showing of

6 The argument, if made, would not prevail. The omission of a single
Rule 11 warning without more is not colorably structural. Cf. United
States v. Timmreck, 441 U. S. 780, 783-784 (1979) (holding that Rule 11
error without more is not cognizable on collateral review).

7 When the Government has the burden of addressing prejudice, as in

excusing preserved error as harmless on direct review of the criminal
conviction, it is not enough to negate an effect on the outcome of the case.
See Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18, 24 (1967) ("[T]he court must be
able to declare a belief that [constitutional error] was harmless beyond a
reasonable doubt"). When the Government has the burden of showing
that constitutional trial error is harmless because it comes up on collateral
review, the heightened interest in finality generally calls for the Government to meet the more lenient Kotteakos standard. Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 638 (1993). If the burden is on a defendant to show
prejudice in the first instance, of course, it would be easier to show a
reasonable doubt that constitutional error affected a trial than to show a
likely effect on the outcome or verdict.

Opinion of the Court
"a reasonable probability that, but for [the error claimed],
the result of the proceeding would have been different."
United States v. Bagley, 473 U. S. 667, 682 (1985) (opinion of
Blackmun, J.) (adopting the prejudice standard of Strickland
v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 694 (1984), for claims under
Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963) (internal quotation
marks omitted)); 473 U. S., at 685 (White, J., concurring in
part and concurring in judgment) (same).8

No reason has appeared for treating the phrase "affecting
substantial rights" as untethered to a prejudice requirement
when applying Olano to this nonstructural error, or for
doubting that Bagley is a sensible model to follow. As Vonn
makes clear, the burden of establishing entitlement to relief
for plain error is on the defendant claiming it, and for several
reasons, we think that burden should not be too easy for
defendants in Dominguez's position. First, the standard
should enforce the policies that underpin Rule 52(b) generally, to encourage timely objections and reduce wasteful reversals by demanding strenuous exertion to get relief for
unpreserved error. See Vonn, 535 U. S., at 73. Second, it
should respect the particular importance of the finality of
guilty pleas, which usually rest, after all, on a defendant's

8 This standard is similar to one already applied by some Courts of Appeals, though those courts have not drawn a direct connection to Strickland and Bagley, and in some cases understood themselves to be reviewing for harmless, rather than plain, error. See United States v. Martinez,
289 F. 3d 1023, 1029 (CA7 2002) (on plain-error review, asking "whether
any Rule 11 violations would have likely affected [the defendant's] willingness to plead guilty"); see also United States v. Johnson, 1 F. 3d 296,
302 (CA5 1993) (en banc) (on harmless-error review, asking "whether the
defendant's knowledge and comprehension of the full and correct information would have been likely to affect his willingness to plead guilty");
cf. United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 734-735 (1993) (the main difference as to substantial rights in the harmless- and plain-error analyses is
that the burden of persuasion shifts from Government to defendant).

Opinion of the Court
profession of guilt in open court, and are indispensable in
the operation of the modern criminal justice system. See
United States v. Timmreck, 441 U. S. 780, 784 (1979). And,
in this case, these reasons are complemented by the fact,
worth repeating, that the violation claimed was of Rule 11,
not of due process.

We hold, therefore, that a defendant who seeks reversal of
his conviction after a guilty plea, on the ground that the district court committed plain error under Rule 11, must show
a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not
have entered the plea. A defendant must thus satisfy the
judgment of the reviewing court, informed by the entire record, that the probability of a different result is "sufficient
to undermine confidence in the outcome" of the proceeding.
Strickland, supra, at 694; Bagley, supra, at 682 (opinion of
Blackmun, J. (internal quotation marks omitted)).9

9 One significant difference, however, between Rule 11 claims and claims
under Strickland and Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), is that the
latter may be raised in postconviction proceedings such as a petition for
habeas corpus, or a motion to vacate a sentence under 28 U. S. C. $ 2255.
Those proceedings permit greater development of the record. See Massaro v. United States, 538 U. S. 500 (2003) (Strickland claims are not procedurally defaulted when brought for the first time on $ 2255, because of the
advantages of that form of proceeding for hearing such cases). For Rule
11 claims, by contrast, that way is open only in the most egregious cases.
Timmreck, supra; see also Vonn, 535 U. S., at 64 (noting that Rule 11(h)
was not meant to disturb Timmreck). A defendant will rarely, if ever, be
able to obtain relief for Rule 11 violations under $ 2255; and relief on direct
appeal, given the plain-error standard that will apply in many cases, will
be difficult to get, as it should be. Cf. United States v. Raineri, 42 F. 3d
36, 45 (CA1 1994) (Boudin, J.) ("[J]ust as there are many fair trials but few
perfect ones, so flaws are also to be expected in Rule 11 proceedings").

Our rule does not, however, foreclose relief altogether. The
reasonable-probability standard is not the same as, and should not be confused with, a requirement that a defendant prove by a preponderance of
the evidence that but for error things would have been different. See
Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 434 (1995).

84 UNITED STATES v. DOMINGUEZ BENITEZ

Opinion of the Court

C
What we have already said points to why the test appliedby the Court of Appeals in this case fell short. Its first element was whether the error was "minor or technical," 310F. 3d, at 1225, a phrase it took from

United States v. Graibe,946 F. 2d 1428 (CA9 1991), which in turn found it in the 1983

commentary that accompanied the amendment to Rule 11(h).946 F. 2d, at 1433. But this element requires no examination of the effect of the omitted warning on a defendant'sdecision, a failing repeated to a significant extent by the second element of the Ninth Circuit's test, taken from United
States v. Minore, 292 F. 3d 1109 (CA9 2002), which askswhether the defendant understood "the rights at issue when

he entered his guilty plea." 310 F. 3d, at 1225. True, thisenquiry gets closer than the first to a consideration of the
likely effect of Rule 11 error on the defendant's decision toplead; assessing a claim that an error affected a defendant's
decision to plead guilty must take into account any indicationthat the omission of a Rule 11 warning misled him. But the
standard of the Court of Appeals does not allow consider-ation of any record evidence tending to show that a misunderstanding was inconsequential to a defendant's decision, orevidence indicating the relative significance of other facts
that may have borne on his choice regardless of any Rule11 error.

10

Relevant evidence that the Court of Appeals thus passedover in this case included Dominguez's statement to the District Court that he did not intend to go to trial, and his coun10 This is another point of contrast with the constitutional question
whether a defendant's guilty plea was knowing and voluntary. We have
held, for example, that when the record of a criminal conviction obtained
by guilty plea contains no evidence that a defendant knew of the rights
he was putatively waiving, the conviction must be reversed. Boykin v.
Alabama, 395 U. S. 238, 243 (1969). We do not suggest that such a conviction could be saved even by overwhelming evidence that the defendant
would have pleaded guilty regardless.

Opinion of the Court
sel's confirmation of that representation, made at the samehearing. The neglected but relevant considerations also included the implications raised by Dominguez's protests atthe sentencing hearing. He claimed that when he pleaded
guilty he had "never had any knowledge about the points ofresponsibility, the safety valve, or anything like that." App.
109. These statements, if credited, would show that Dominguez was confused about the law that applied to his sentence,about which the court clearly informed him, but they do not

suggest any causal link between his confusion and the partic-ular Rule 11 violation on which he now seeks relief.

Other matters that may be relevant but escape notice
under the Ninth Circuit's test are the overall strength of the
Government's case and any possible defenses that appear
from the record, subjects that courts are accustomed to considering in a Strickland or Brady analysis. When the record made for a guilty plea and sentencing reveals evidence,
as this one does, showing both a controlled sale of drugs to
an informant and a confession, one can fairly ask a defendant
seeking to withdraw his plea what he might ever have
thought he could gain by going to trial. The point of the
question is not to second-guess a defendant's actual decision;
if it is reasonably probable he would have gone to trial absent the error, it is no matter that the choice may have been
foolish. The point, rather, is to enquire whether the omitted
warning would have made the difference required by the
standard of reasonable probability; it is hard to see here how
the warning could have had an effect on Dominguez's assessment of his strategic position. And even if there were reason to think the warning from the bench could have mattered, there was the plea agreement, read to Dominguez in
his native Spanish, which specifically warned that he could
not withdraw his plea if the court refused to accept the
Government's recommendations. This fact, uncontested by
Dominguez, tends to show that the Rule 11 error made no
difference to the outcome here.

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment

We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and re-mand the case for further proceedings consistent with this

opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment.
I agree with much of the Court's opinion and concur in itsdisposition of the case. I do not, however, agree with its

holding that respondent need not show prejudice by a pre-ponderance of the evidence.

Ante, at 83, n. 9.By my count, this Court has adopted no fewer than four

assertedly different standards of probability relating to theassessment of whether the outcome of trial

would have beendifferent if error had not occurred, or if omitted evidence

had been included. See Chapman v. California, 386 U. S.18, 24 (1967) (adopting "harmless beyond a reasonable doubt"
standard for preserving, on direct review, conviction ob-tained in a trial where constitutional error occurred); Brecht
v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 637 (1993) (rejecting Chap-man in favor of the less defendant-friendly " `substantial and
injurious effect or influence' " standard of Kotteakos v.United States, 328 U. S. 750 (1946), for overturning conviction on collateral review); United States v. Agurs, 427 U. S.97, 111-113 (1976) (rejecting

Kotteakos for overturning con-viction on the basis of violations of Brady v. Maryland, 373

U. S. 83 (1963), in favor of an even less defendant-friendlystandard later described in Strickland v. Washington, 466
U. S. 668, 694 (1984), as a "reasonable probability"); id., at693-694 (distinguishing the "reasonable probability" standard from the still yet less defendant-friendly "more likelythan not" standard applicable to claims of newly discovered
evidence). See generally Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419,434-436 (1995). Such ineffable gradations of probability
seem to me quite beyond the ability of the judicial mind (orany mind) to grasp, and thus harmful rather than helpful

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
to the consistency and rationality of judicial decisionmaking.That is especially so when they are applied to the hypothesizing of events that never in fact occurred. Such an enter-prise is not factfinding, but closer to divination.

For purposes of estimating what would have happened,it seems to me that the only serviceable standards are the
traditional "beyond a reasonable doubt" and "more likelythan not." We should not pretend to a higher degree of precision. I would not, therefore, extend our "reasonable prob-ability" standard to the plain-error context. I would hold
that, where a defendant has failed to object at trial, and thushas the burden of proving that a mistake he failed to prevent
had an effect on his substantial rights, he must show thateffect to be probable, that is, more likely than not.

HIBBS, DIRECTOR, ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OFREVENUE

v. WINN et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 02-1809. Argued January 20, 2004--Decided June 14, 2004
Plaintiffs-respondents, Arizona taxpayers, filed suit in federal court

against the Director of Arizona's Department of Revenue (Director)
seeking to enjoin the operation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 43-1089 on
Establishment Clause grounds. Arizona's law authorizes an income-tax
credit for payments to nonprofit "school tuition organizations" (STOs)
that award scholarships to students in private elementary or secondary
schools. Section 43-1089 provides that STOs may not designate schools
that "discriminate on the basis of race, color, handicap, familial status
or national origin," $ 43-1089(F), but does not preclude STOs from designating schools that provide religious instruction or give religion-based
admissions preferences. The District Court granted the Director's motion to dismiss on the ground that the Tax Injunction Act (TIA), 28
U. S. C. $ 1341, barred the suit. The TIA prohibits lower federal courts
from restraining "the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under
State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the
courts of such State." The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the
TIA does not bar federal-court actions challenging state tax credits.

Held:

1. The Court rejects respondents' contention that the Director's certiorari petition was jurisdictionally untimely under 28 U. S. C. $ 2101(c)
and this Court's Rule 13.3. Section 2101(c) instructs that a petition
must be filed "within ninety days after the entry of . . . judgment," and
this Court's Rule 13.3 elaborates on that statute's instruction. More
than 90 days elapsed between the date the Ninth Circuit first entered
judgment and the date the Director's petition was filed. That time
lapse, respondents assert, made the filing untimely under Rule 13.3's
first sentence: "[T]he time to file . . . runs from the date of entry of
the judgment or order sought to be reviewed." Moreover, respondents
submit, because no party petitioned for rehearing, the extended filing
periods prescribed by the Rule's second sentence never came into play.
This case, however, did not follow the typical course. The Ninth Circuit, on its own initiative, had recalled its mandate and ordered the
parties to brief the question whether the case should be reheard en
banc. That order, this Court holds, suspended the judgment's finality

89Cite as: 542 U. S. 88 (2004)
Syllabus
under $ 2101(c), just as a timely filed rehearing petition would or a
court's appropriate decision to consider a late-filed rehearing petition,
see Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U. S. 33, 49. The Court of Appeals' order
raised the question whether that court would modify the judgment and
alter the parties' rights; thus, while the court-initiated briefing order
was pending, there was no "judgment" to be reviewed. See, e. g., id.,
at 46. The Director's certiorari petition was timely under the statute
because it was filed within 90 days of the date the Ninth Circuit denied
rehearing en banc. Were this Court to read Rule 13 as the sole guide,
so that only a party's rehearing petition could reset the statute's 90-day
count, the Court would lose sight of the congressional objective underpinning $ 2101(c): An appellate court's final adjudication, Congress indicated, marks the time from which the filing period begins to run. The
statute takes priority over the "procedural rules adopted by the Court
for the orderly transaction of its business." Schacht v. United States,
398 U. S. 58, 64. Because the petition was timely under $ 2101(c), the
Court has jurisdiction. Pp. 96-99.

2. The TIA does not bar respondents' suit. Pp. 99-112.

(a) To determine whether the TIA bars this litigation, it is appropriate, first, to identify the relief sought. Respondents seek prospective relief only: injunctive relief prohibiting the Director from allowing
taxpayers to utilize the $ 43-1089 tax credit for payments to STOs that
make religion-based tuition grants; a declaration that $ 43-1089, on its
face and as applied, violates the Establishment Clause; and an order
that the Director inform such STOs that all funds in their possession as
of the order's date must be paid into the state general fund. Taking
account of the prospective nature of the relief requested, the Court
reaches the dispositive question whether respondents' suit seeks to "enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax
under State law," $ 1341. The answer turns on the meaning of the term
"assessment" as employed in the TIA. For Internal Revenue Code
(IRC) purposes, an assessment involves a "recording" of the amount the
taxpayer owes the Government. 26 U. S. C. $ 6203. The Court does
not focus on the word "assessment" in isolation, however, but follows
"the cardinal rule that statutory language must be read in context."
General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 596. In
the TIA and tax law generally, an assessment is closely tied to the collection of a tax, i. e., the assessment is the official recording of liability
that triggers levy and collection efforts. Complementing the cardinal
rule just stated, the rule against superfluities instructs courts to interpret a statute to effectuate all its provisions, so that no part is rendered
superfluous. If, as the Director asserts, the term "assessment," by itself, signified the entire taxing plan, the TIA would not need the words

542US1 Unit: $U61 [11-01-06 14:24:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN
90 HIBBS v. WINN

Syllabus
"levy" or "collection"; the term "assessment," alone, would do all the
necessary work. In briefing United States v. Galletti, 541 U. S. 114, the
Government made clear that, under the IRC definition, an "assessment"
serves as the trigger for levy and collection efforts. The Government
did not describe "assessment" as synonymous with the entire taxation
plan, nor disassociate the word from the company ("levy or collection")
it keeps. Instead, and in accord with this Court's understanding, the
Government related "assessment" to the term's collection-propelling
function. Pp. 99-102.

(b) Congress modeled $ 1341 on earlier federal statutes of similar
import, which in turn paralleled state provisions proscribing state-court
actions to enjoin the collection of state and local taxes. Congress drew
particularly on the Anti-Injunction Act (AIA), which bars "any court"
from entertaining a suit brought "for the purpose of restraining the
assessment or collection of any [federal] tax." 26 U. S. C. $ 7421(a).
This Court has recognized, from the AIA's text, that the measure serves
twin purposes: It responds to the Government's need to assess and collect taxes expeditiously with a minimum of preenforcement judicial
interference; and it requires that the legal right to disputed sums be
determined in a refund suit. E. g., Bob Jones Univ. v. Simon, 416 U. S.
725, 736. Lower federal courts have similarly comprehended $ 7421(a).
Just as the AIA shields federal tax collections from federal-court injunctions, so the TIA shields state tax collections from federal-court restraints. In both 26 U. S. C. $ 7421(a) and 28 U. S. C. $ 1341, Congress
directed taxpayers to pursue refund suits instead of attempting to
restrain collections. Third-party suits not seeking to stop the collection
(or contest the validity) of a tax imposed on plaintiffs were outside
Congress' purview. The TIA's legislative history shows that, in enacting the statute, Congress focused on taxpayers who sought to avoid
paying their state tax bill by pursuing a challenge route other than
the one specified by the taxing authority. Nowhere does the history
announce a sweeping congressional direction to prevent federal-court
interference with all aspects of state tax administration. The foregoing
understanding of the TIA's purposes and legislative history underpins
this Court's previous applications of that statute. See, e. g., California
v. Grace Brethren Church, 457 U. S. 393, 408-409. Id., at 410, distinguished. Contrary to the Director's assertion, Arkansas v. Farm
Credit Servs. of Central Ark., 520 U. S. 821; National Private Truck
Council, Inc. v. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n, 515 U. S. 582; Fair Assessment
in Real Estate Assn., Inc. v. McNary, 454 U. S. 100; and Rosewell v.
LaSalle Nat. Bank, 450 U. S. 503, do not hold that state tax administration matters must be kept entirely free from lower federal-court "interference." Like Grace Brethren Church, all of those cases fall within

$ 1341's undisputed compass: All involved plaintiffs who mounted federal
litigation to avoid paying state taxes (or to gain a refund of such taxes).
Federal-court relief, therefore, would have operated to reduce the flow
of state tax revenue. Those decisions are not fairly portrayed cut loose
from their secure, state-revenue-protective moorings. See, e. g., Grace
Brethren Church, 457 U. S., at 410. This Court has interpreted and
applied the TIA only in cases Congress wrote the statute to address,
i. e., cases in which state taxpayers seek federal-court orders enabling
them to avoid paying state taxes. The Court has read harmoniously
the $ 1341 instruction conditioning the jurisdictional bar on the availability of "a plain, speedy and efficient remedy" in state court. The remedy
inspected in the Court's decisions was not designed for the universe of
plaintiffs who sue the State, but was tailormade for taxpayers. See,
e. g., id., at 411. Pp. 102-108.

(c) In other federal courts as well, $ 1341 has been read to restrain
taxpayers from instituting federal actions to contest their liability for
state taxes, but not to stop third parties from pursuing constitutional
challenges to state tax benefits in a federal forum. Further, numerous
federal-court decisions--including decisions of this Court reviewing
lower federal-court judgments--have reached the merits of third-party
constitutional challenges to tax benefits without mentioning the TIA.
See, e. g., Byrne v. Public Funds for Public Schools of New Jersey,
442 U. S. 907; Griffin v. School Bd. of Prince Edward Cty., 377 U. S.
218. Consistent with the decades-long understanding prevailing on
this issue, respondents' suit may proceed without any TIA impediment. Pp. 108-112.

Opinion of the Court
Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 43-1089 (West Supp. 2003). Plaintiffsbelow, respondents here, brought an action in federal court

challenging $ 43-1089, and seeking to enjoin its operation, onEstablishment Clause grounds. The question presented is
whether the Tax Injunction Act (TIA or Act), 28 U. S. C.$ 1341, which prohibits a lower federal court from restraining
"the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State
law," bars the suit. Plaintiffs-respondents do not contesttheir own tax liability. Nor do they seek to impede Arizona's receipt of tax revenues. Their suit, we hold, is not thekind $ 1341 proscribes.

In decisions spanning a near half century, courts in the
federal system, including this Court, have entertained challenges to tax credits authorized by state law, without conceiving of $ 1341 as a jurisdictional barrier. On this first
occasion squarely to confront the issue, we confirm the authority federal courts exercised in those cases.

It is hardly ancient history that States, once bent on maintaining racial segregation in public schools, and allocating
resources disproportionately to benefit white students to the
detriment of black students, fastened on tuition grants and
tax credits as a promising means to circumvent Brown v.
Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954). The federal
courts, this Court among them, adjudicated the ensuing
challenges, instituted under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, and upheld
the Constitution's equal protection requirement. See, e. g.,
Griffin v. School Bd. of Prince Edward Cty., 377 U. S. 218,
233 (1964) (faced with unconstitutional closure of county public schools and tuition grants and tax credits for contributions to private segregated schools, District Court could require county to levy taxes to fund nondiscriminatory public
schools), rev'g 322 F. 2d 332, 343-344 (CA4 1963) (abstention
required until state courts determine validity of grants, tax
credits, and public-school closing), aff 'g Allen v. County
School Bd. of Prince Edward Cty., 198 F. Supp. 497, 503 (ED
Va. 1961) (county enjoined from paying grants or providing

tax credits to support private schools that exclude studentsbased on race while public schools remain closed), and aff 'g

207 F. Supp. 349, 355 (ED Va. 1962) (closure of public schoolsenjoined). See also Moton v. Lambert, 508 F. Supp. 367, 368
(ND Miss. 1981) (challenge to tax exemptions for racially dis-criminatory private schools may proceed in federal court).

In the instant case, petitioner Hibbs, Director of Arizona'sDepartment of Revenue, argues, in effect, that we and other
federal courts were wrong in those civil-rights cases. TheTIA, petitioner maintains, trumps $ 1983; the Act, according
to petitioner, bars all lower federal-court interference withstate tax systems, even when the challengers are not endeavoring to avoid a tax imposed on them, and no matter whetherthe State's revenues would be raised or lowered should the
plaintiffs prevail. The alleged jurisdictional bar, which peti-tioner asserts has existed since the TIA's enactment in 1937,
was not even imagined by the jurists in the pathmarkingcivil-rights cases just cited, or by the defendants in those
cases, litigants with every interest in defeating federal-courtadjudicatory authority. Our prior decisions command no respect, petitioner urges, because they constitute mere "subsilentio holdings." Reply Brief for Petitioner 8. We reject
that assessment.We examine in this opinion both the scope of the term
"assessment" as used in the TIA, and the question whetherthe Act was intended to insulate state tax laws from constitutional challenge in lower federal courts even when the suitwould have no negative impact on tax collection. Concluding that this suit implicates neither $ 1341's conception ofassessment nor any of the statute's underlying purposes, we
affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

a nonprofit organization that directs moneys, in the form ofscholarship grants, to students enrolled in private elementary or secondary schools. STOs must disburse as scholar-ship grants at least 90 percent of contributions received, may
allow donors to direct scholarships to individual students,
may not allow donors to name their own dependents, mustdesignate at least two schools whose students will receive

funds, and must not designate schools that "discriminate onthe basis of race, color, handicap, familial status or national
origin." See $$ 43-1089(D)-(F). STOs are not precludedby Arizona's statute from designating schools that provide
religious instruction or that give admissions preference onthe basis of religion or religious affiliation. When taxpayers
donate money to a qualified STO, $ 43-1089 allows them, incalculating their Arizona tax liability, to credit up to $500 of
their donation (or $625 for a married couple filing jointly,$ 43-1089(A)(2)).

In effect, $ 43-1089 gives Arizona taxpayers an election.
They may direct $500 (or, for joint-return filers, $625) to anSTO, or to the Arizona Department of Revenue. As long as

donors do not give STOs more than their total tax liability,
their $500 or $625 contributions are costless.

The Arizona Supreme Court, by a 3-to-2 vote, rejected a
facial challenge to $ 43-1089 before the statute went into effect. Kotterman v. Killian, 193 Ariz. 273, 972 P. 2d 606
(1999) (en banc). That case took the form of a special discretionary action invoking the court's original jurisdiction. See
id., at 277, 972 P. 2d, at 610. Kotterman, it is undisputed,
has no preclusive effect on the instant as-applied challenge
to $ 43-1089 brought by different plaintiffs.

Respondents' federal-court complaint against the Director
of Arizona's Department of Revenue (Director) alleged that

$ 43-1089 "authorizes the formation of agencies that have as
their sole purpose the distribution of State funds to children
of a particular religious denomination or to children attend542US1 Unit: $U61 [11-01-06 14:24:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ing schools of a particular religious denomination." Com-plaint || 13, App. 10. Respondents sought injunctive and declaratory relief, and an order requiring STOs to pay fundsstill in their possession "into the state general fund." Id.,
at 7-8, App. 15.The Director moved to dismiss the action, relying on the
TIA, which reads in its entirety:

"The district courts shall not enjoin, suspend or restrainthe assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State

law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may behad in the courts of such State." 28 U. S. C. $ 1341.

The Director did not assert that a federal-court order enjoin-ing $ 43-1089 would interfere with the State's tax levy or
collection efforts. He urged only that a federal injunctionwould restrain the "assessment" of taxes "under State law."
Agreeing with the Director, the District Court held that theTIA required dismissal of the suit. App. to Pet. for Cert. 31.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, hold-ing that "a federal action challenging the granting of a state
tax credit is not prohibited by the [TIA]." Winn v. Killian,307 F. 3d 1011, 1017 (2002). Far from "adversely affect[ing]
the state's ability to raise revenue," the Court of Appealsobserved, "the relief requested by [respondents] . . . would
result in the state's receiving more funds that could be usedfor the public benefit." Id., at 1017, 1018. We granted certiorari, 539 U. S. 986 (2003), in view of the division of opinionon whether the TIA bars constitutional challenges to state
tax credits in federal court. Compare 307 F. 3d, at 1017,with

ACLU Foundation v. Bridges, 334 F. 3d 416, 421-423(CA5 2003) (TIA bars federal action seeking to have any part

of a State's tax system declared unconstitutional). We nowaffirm the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.

Before reaching the merits of this case, we must addressrespondents' contention that the Director's petition for cer542US1 Unit: $U61 [11-01-06 14:24:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tiorari was jurisdictionally untimely under 28 U. S. C.$ 2101(c) and our Rules. See Brief in Opposition 8-13. Section 2101(c) instructs that a petition for certiorari must befiled "within ninety days after the entry of . . . judgment."
This Court's Rule 13.3 elaborates:

"The time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari runs
from the date of entry of the judgment or order soughtto be reviewed, and not from the issuance date of the

mandate (or its equivalent under local practice). But ifa petition for rehearing is timely filed in the lower court
by any party, the time to file the petition for a writ ofcertiorari for all parties (whether or not they requested
rehearing or joined in the petition for rehearing) runs
from the date of the denial of the petition for rehearingor, if the petition for rehearing is granted, the subsequent entry of judgment."
Respondents assert that the Director's petition missed theRule's deadlines: More than 90 days elapsed between the

date the Court of Appeals first entered judgment and thedate the petition was filed, rendering the filing untimely
under the first sentence of the Rule; and because no party
petitioned for rehearing, the extended periods prescribed bythe Rule's second sentence never came into play.

This case, however, did not follow the typical course. TheCourt of Appeals, on its own motion, recalled its mandate
and ordered the parties to brief the question whether thecase should be reheard en banc. That order, we conclude,
suspended the judgment's finality under $ 2101(c), just as atimely filed rehearing petition would, or a court's appropriate
decision to consider a late-filed rehearing petition. Compare Young v. Harper, 520 U. S. 143, 147, n. 1 (1997) (appeals
court agreed to consider a late-filed rehearing petition; timeliness of petition for certiorari measured from date court disposed of rehearing petition), with Missouri v. Jenkins, 495

not be tolled when it appears that the lower court grantedrehearing or amended its order solely for the purpose of extending that time.").A timely rehearing petition, a court's appropriate decision
to entertain an untimely rehearing petition, and a court'sdirection, on its own initiative, that the parties address
whether rehearing should be ordered share this key characteristic: All three raise the question whether the court willmodify the judgment and alter the parties' rights. See

id.,
at 46 ("A timely petition for rehearing . . . operates to sus-pend the finality of the . . . court's judgment, pending the

court's further determination whether the judgment should
be modified so as to alter its adjudication of the rights of the
parties" (quoting Department of Banking of Neb. v. Pink,
317 U. S. 264, 266 (1942) (per curiam); alterations in original)). In other words, "while [a] petition for rehearing is
pending," or while the court is considering, on its own initiative, whether rehearing should be ordered, "there is no
`judgment' to be reviewed." Jenkins, 495 U. S., at 46.

In this light, we hold that the Director's petition for a writ
of certiorari was timely. When the Court of Appeals ordered briefing on the rehearing issue, 90 days had not yet
passed from the issuance of the panel opinion. Because

$ 2101(c)'s 90-day limit had not yet expired, the clock could
still be reset by an order that left unresolved whether

the court would modify its judgment. The court-initiated
briefing order had just that effect. Because a genuinely
final judgment is critical under the statute, we must treat
the date of the court's order denying rehearing en banc as
the date judgment was entered. The petition was filed
within 90 days of that date and was thus timely under the
statute.

Were we to read Rule 13 as our sole guide, so that only a
rehearing petition filed by a party could reset the statute's
90-day count, we would lose sight of the congressional objective underpinning $ 2101(c): An appellate court's final adjudi542US1 Unit: $U61 [11-01-06 14:24:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

cation, Congress indicated, marks the time from which theperiod allowed for a certiorari petition begins to run. The

statute takes priority over the "procedural rules adoptedby the Court for the orderly transaction of its business."
Schacht v. United States, 398 U. S. 58, 64 (1970). Whencourt-created rules fail to anticipate unusual circumstances
that fit securely within a federal statute's compass, thestatute controls our decision. See,

e. g., Kontrick v. Ryan,540 U. S. 443, 453 (2004) (" `[I]t is axiomatic' that [courtprescribed procedural rules] `do not create or withdraw fed-eral jurisdiction.' " (quoting Owen Equipment & Erection
Co. v. Kroger, 437 U. S. 365, 370 (1978))). Because the peti-tion for a writ of certiorari was timely under $ 2101(c), we
have jurisdiction to decide whether the TIA bars respond-ents' suit.

III
To determine whether this litigation falls within the TIA'sprohibition, it is appropriate, first, to identify the relief

sought. Respondents seek prospective relief only. Spe-cifically, their complaint requests "injunctive relief prohibiting [the Director] from allowing taxpayers to utilize the taxcredit authorized by A. R. S. $ 43-1089 for payments made
to STOs that make tuition grants to children attending reli-gious schools, to children attending schools of only one religious denomination, or to children selected on the basis oftheir religion." Complaint 7, App. 15. Respondents further ask for a "declaration that A. R. S. $ 43-1089, on itsface and as applied," violates the Establishment Clause "by
affirmatively authorizing STOs to use State income-tax reve-nues to pay tuition for students attending religious schools
or schools that discriminate on the basis of religion." Ibid.Finally, respondents seek "[a]n order that [the Director] inform all [such] STOs that . . . all funds in their possession asof the date of this Court's order must be paid into the state
general fund." Complaint 7-8, App. 15. Taking account ofthe prospective nature of the relief requested, does respond542US1 Unit: $U61 [11-01-06 14:24:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ents' suit, in 28 U. S. C. $ 1341's words, seek to "enjoin, sus-pend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax

under State law"? The answer to that question turns on themeaning of the term "assessment" as employed in the TIA.

1

As used in the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), the term"assessment" involves a "recording" of the amount the taxpayer owes the Government. 26 U. S. C. $ 6203. The "assessment" is "essentially a bookkeeping notation." Laingv.

United States, 423 U. S. 161, 170, n. 13 (1976). Section
6201(a) of the IRC authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury"to make . . . assessments of all taxes . . . imposed by this

title." An assessment is made "by recording the liability ofthe taxpayer in the office of the Secretary in accordance with
rules or regulations prescribed by the Secretary." $ 6203.2See also M. Saltzman, IRS Practice and Procedure || 10.02,
pp. 10-4 to 10-7 (2d ed. 1991) (when Internal Revenue Serv-ice (IRS) signs "summary list" of assessment to record
amount of tax liability, "the official act of assessment has
occurred for purposes of the Code").3

1 State taxation, for $ 1341 purposes, includes local taxation. See 17
C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 4237,
pp. 643-644 (2d ed. 1988) ("Local taxes are imposed under authority of
state law and the courts have held that the Tax Injunction Act applies to
them."); R. Fallon, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler's The
Federal Courts and the Federal System 1173 (5th ed. 2003) ("For purposes
of the Act, local taxes have uniformly been held to be collected `under
State law.' ").

2 Section 301.6203-1 of the Treasury Regulations states that an assessment is accomplished by the "assessment officer signing the summary record of assessment," which, "through supporting records," provides "identification of the taxpayer, the character of the liability assessed, the taxable
period, if applicable, and the amount of the assessment. " 26 CFR

$ 301.6203-1 (2003).

3 The term "assessment" is used in a variety of ways in tax law. In the

property-tax setting, the word usually refers to the process by which the
taxing authority assigns a taxable value to real or personal property.
See, e. g., F. Schoettle, State and Local Taxation: The Law and Policy of
Multi-Jurisdictional Taxation 799 (2003) ("ASSESSMENT--The process of

101Cite as: 542 U. S. 88 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
We do not focus on the word "assessment" in isolation,however. Instead, we follow "the cardinal rule that statutory language must be read in context [since] a phrase gath-ers meaning from the words around it." General Dynamics
Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 596 (2004) (inter-nal quotation marks omitted). In $ 1341 and tax law generally, an assessment is closely tied to the collection of a tax,
i. e., the assessment is the official recording of liability thattriggers levy and collection efforts.

The rule against superfluities complements the principlethat courts are to interpret the words of a statute in context.
See 2A N. Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction$ 46.06, pp. 181-186 (rev. 6th ed. 2000) ("A statute should be
construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, so thatno part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant . . . ." (footnotes omitted)). If, as the Director asserts,the term "assessment," by itself, signified "[t]he entire plan
or scheme fixed upon for charging or taxing," Brief for Peti-tioner 12 (quoting Webster's New International Dictionary
of the English Language 166 (2d ed. 1934)), the TIA wouldnot need the words "levy" or "collection"; the term "assessment," alone, would do all the necessary work.
putting a value on real or personal property for purposes of a tax to be
measured as a percentage of property values. The valuation is ordinarily
done by a government official, the `assessor' or `tax assessor,' who will
sometimes hire a private professional to do the actual valuations.");
Black's Law Dictionary 112 (7th ed. 1999) (defining "assessment" as, inter
alia: "Official valuation of property for purposes of taxation <assessment
of the beach house>.--Also termed tax assessment. Cf. appraisal.").
See also 5 R. Powell, Real Property $ 39.02 (M. Wolf ed. 2000). To calculate the amount of property taxes owed, the tax assessor multiplies the
assessed value by the appropriate tax rate. See, e. g., R. Werner, Real
Estate Law 534 (11th ed. 2002). Income taxes, by contrast, are typically
self-assessed in the United States. As anyone who has filed a tax return
is unlikely to forget, the taxpayer, not the taxing authority, is the first
party to make the relevant calculation of income taxes owed. The word
"self-assessment," however, is not a technical term; as IRC $ 6201(a) indicates, the IRS executes the formal act of income-tax assessment.

102 HIBBS v. WINN

Opinion of the Court
Earlier this Term, in United States v. Galletti, 541 U. S.114 (2004), the Government identified "two important consequences" that follow from the IRS' timely tax assessment:"[T]he IRS may employ administrative enforcement methods
such as tax liens and levies to collect the outstanding tax,"see 26 U. S. C. $$ 6321-6327, 6331-6344; and "the time within
which the IRS may collect the tax either administratively orby a `proceeding in court' is extended [from 3 years] to 10
years after the date of assessment," see $$ 6501(a), 6502(a).Brief for United States in

United States v. Galletti, O. T.2003, No. 02-1389, pp. 15-16. The Government thus made

clear in briefing Galletti that, under the IRC definition, thetax "assessment" serves as the trigger for levy and collection
efforts. The Government did not describe the term as syn-onymous with the entire plan of taxation. Nor did it disassociate the word "assessment" from the company ("levy orcollection") that word keeps.

4 Instead, and in accord with

our understanding, the Government related "assessment" tothe term's collection-propelling function.

IV
Congress modeled $ 1341 upon earlier federal "statutes ofsimilar import," laws that, in turn, paralleled state provisions proscribing "actions in State courts to enjoin the collec-tion of State and county taxes." S. Rep. No. 1035, 75th
Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1937) (hereinafter S. Rep.). In compos-ing the TIA's text, Congress drew particularly on an 1867
measure, sometimes called the Anti-Injunction Act (AIA),which bars "any court" from entertaining a suit brought "for
the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection ofany [federal] tax." Act of Mar. 2, 1867, ch. 169, $ 10, 14 Stat.

4 The dissent is of two minds in this regard. On the one hand, it twice
suggests that a proper definition of the term "assessment," for $ 1341 purposes, is "the entire plan or scheme fixed upon for charging or taxing."
Post, at 117. On the other hand, the dissent would disconnect the word
from the enforcement process ("levy or collection") that "assessment" sets
in motion. See post, at 117-119.

475, now codified at 26 U. S. C. $ 7421(a). See JeffersonCounty v. Acker, 527 U. S. 423, 434-435 (1999). While

$ 7421(a) "apparently has no recorded legislative history,"Bob Jones Univ. v. Simon, 416 U. S. 725, 736 (1974), the
Court has recognized, from the AIA's text, that the measureserves twin purposes: It responds to "the Government's need
to assess and collect taxes as expeditiously as possible witha minimum of preenforcement judicial interference"; and it
" `require[s] that the legal right to the disputed sums be de-termined in a suit for refund,' "

ibid. (quoting Enochs v. Wil-liams Packing & Nav. Co., 370 U. S. 1, 7 (1962)).

5 Lower

federal courts have similarly comprehended $ 7421(a). See,e. g., McGlotten v. Connally, 338 F. Supp. 448, 453-454 (DC

1972) (three-judge court) ($ 7421(a) does not bar action seek-ing to enjoin income-tax exemptions to fraternal orders that
exclude nonwhites from membership, for in such an action,plaintiff "does not contest the amount of his own tax, nor
does he seek to limit the amount of tax revenue collectibleby the United States" (footnote omitted));

Tax Analysts andAdvocates v. Shultz, 376 F. Supp. 889, 892 (DC 1974) (Section

7421(a) does not bar challenge to IRS revenue ruling allow-ing contributors to political candidate committees to avoid
federal gift tax on contributions in excess of $3,000 ceiling;while $ 7421(a) "precludes suits to restrain the assessment or
collection of taxes," the proscription does not apply when"plaintiffs seek not to restrain the Commissioner from collecting taxes, but rather to require him to collect additionaltaxes according to the mandates of the law." (emphases in
original)).6

5 That Congress had in mind challenges to assessments triggering collections, i. e., attempts to prevent the collection of revenue, is borne out by
the final clause of 26 U. S. C. $ 7421(a), added in 1966: "whether or not such
person is the person against whom such tax was assessed." (Emphasis
added.)

367 (1984), with McGlotten and Tax Analysts and Advocates. Post,

did not seek to stop the collection of taxes. In contrast, in South Caro542US1 Unit: $U61 [11-01-06 14:24:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
Just as the AIA shields federal tax collecti ons fromfederal-court injunctions, so the TIA shields state tax collections from federal-court restraints. In both 26 U. S. C.$ 7421(a) and 28 U. S. C. $ 1341, Congress directed taxpayers
to pursue refund suits instead of attempting to restrain col-lections. Third-party suits not seeking to stop the collection
(or contest the validity) of a tax imposed on plaintiffs, as
McGlotten, 338 F. Supp., at 453-454, and Tax Analysts, 376F. Supp., at 892, explained, were outside Congress' purview.

The TIA's legislative history is not silent in this regard.The Act was designed expressly to restrict "the jurisdiction
of the district courts of the United States over suits relatingto the collection of State taxes." S. Rep., p. 1.

Specifically, the Senate Report commented that the Acthad two closely related, state-revenue-protective objectives:
(1) to eliminate disparities between taxpayers who couldseek injunctive relief in federal court--usually out-of-state
corporations asserting diversity jurisdiction--and taxpayerswith recourse only to state courts, which generally required
taxpayers to pay first and litigate later; and (2) to stop taxpayers, with the aid of a federal injunction, from withholdinglarge sums, thereby disrupting state government finances.

Id., at 1-2; see R. Fallon, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart andWechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System 1173

Jefferson County, 527 U. S., at 435 (observing that the TIA was"shaped by state and federal provisions barring anticipatory

actions by taxpayers to stop the tax collector from initiatingcollection proceedings"). In short, in enacting the TIA,

lina v. Regan, the State's suit aimed to reduce federal revenue receipts:
South Carolina sought to enjoin as a violation of its Tenth Amendment
rights not "a federal tax exemption," post, at 120, but federal income taxation of the interest on certain state-issued bonds. The Court held in that
unique suit that $ 7421(a) did not bar this Court's exercise of original jurisdiction over the case. 465 U. S., at 381.

Opinion of the Court
Congress trained its attention on taxpayers who sought to
avoid paying their tax bill by pursuing a challenge route
other than the one specified by the taxing authority. Nowhere does the legislative history announce a sweeping congressional direction to prevent "federal-court interference
with all aspects of state tax administration." Brief for Petitioner 20; post, at 123.7

The understanding of the Act's purposes and legislative
history set out above underpins this Court's previous applications of the TIA. In California v. Grace Brethren
Church, 457 U. S. 393 (1982), for example, we recognized that
the principal purpose of the TIA was to "limit drastically"
federal-court interference with "the collection of [state]
taxes." Id., at 408-409 (quoting Rosewell, 450 U. S., at 522).
True, the Court referred to the disruption of "state tax administration," but it did so specifically in relation to "the
collection of revenue." 457 U. S., at 410 (quoting Perez v.
Ledesma, 401 U. S. 82, 128, n. 17 (1971) (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)). The complainants in
Grace Brethren Church were several California churches and
religious schools. They sought federal-court relief from an
unemployment compensation tax that state law imposed on
them. 457 U. S., at 398. Their federal action, which bypassed state remedies, was exactly what the TIA was designed to ward off. The Director and the dissent endeavor
to reconstruct Grace Brethren Church as precedent for the
proposition that the TIA totally immunizes from lower
federal-court review "all aspects of state tax administration,

7 The language of the TIA differs significantly from that of the Johnson
Act, which provides in part: "The district courts shall not enjoin, suspend
or restrain the operation of, or compliance with," public-utility rate orders made by state regulatory bodies. 28 U. S. C. $ 1342 (emphasis
added). The TIA does not prohibit interference with "the operation of,
or compliance with," state tax laws; rather, $ 1341 proscribes interference
only with those aspects of state tax regimes that are needed to produce
revenue--i. e., assessment, levy, and collection.

and not just interference with the collection of revenue."
Brief for Petitioner 20; see post, at 123-124. The endeavor
is unavailing given the issue before the Court in Grace
Brethren Church and the context in which the words "state
tax administration" appear.

The Director invokes several other decisions alleged to
keep matters of "state tax administration" entirely free from
lower federal-court "interference." Brief for Petitioner
17-21; accord post, at 124-125. Like G race Brethren
Church, all of them fall within $ 1341's undisputed compass:
All involved plaintiffs who mounted federal litigation to
avoid paying state taxes (or to gain a refund of such taxes).
Federal-court relief, therefore, would have operated to reduce the flow of state tax revenue. See Arkansas v. Farm
Credit Servs. of Central Ark., 520 U. S. 821, 824 (1997) (corporations chartered under federal law claimed exemption
from Arkansas sales and income taxation); National Private
Truck Council, Inc. v. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n, 515 U. S. 582,
584 (1995) (action seeking to prevent Oklahoma from collecting taxes State imposed on nonresident motor carriers); Fair
Assessment in Real Estate Assn., Inc. v. McNary, 454 U. S.
100, 105-106 (1981) (taxpayers, alleging unequal taxation of
real property, sought, inter alia, damages measured by alleged tax overassessments); Rosewell, 450 U. S., at 510 (state
taxpayer, alleging her property was inequitably assessed, refused to pay state taxes).8

Our prior decisions are not fairly portrayed cut loose from
their secure, state-revenue-protective moorings. See, e. g.,

8 Petitioner urges, and the dissent agrees, that the TIA safeguards another vital state interest: the authority of state courts to determine what
state law means. Brief for Petitioner 21; post, at 125. Respondents,
however, have not asked the District Court to interpret any state law--
there is no disagreement as to the meaning of Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 43-
1089 (West Supp. 2003), only about whether, as applied, the State's law
violates the Federal Constitution. See supra, at 94-95. That is a question federal courts are no doubt equipped to adjudicate.

In sum, this Court has interpreted and applied the TIA
only in cases Congress wrote the Act to address, i. e., cases
in which state taxpayers seek federal-court orders enabling
them to avoid paying state taxes. See supra, at 105-106.
We have read harmoniously the $ 1341 instruction conditioning the jurisdictional bar on the availability of "a plain,
speedy and efficient remedy" in state court. The remedy
inspected in our decisions was not one designed for the universe of plaintiffs who sue the State. Rather, it was a remedy tailormade for taxpayers. See, e. g., Rosewell, 450
U. S., at 528 ("Illinois' legal remedy that provides property

In other federal courts as well, $ 1341 has been read torestrain state taxpayers from instituting federal actions to

contest their liability for state taxes, but not to stop thirdparties from pursuing constitutional challenges to tax benefits in a federal forum. Relevant to the distinction betweentaxpayer claims that would reduce state revenues and thirdparty claims that would enlarge state receipts, Seventh Cir-cuit Judge Easterbrook wrote trenchantly:

"Although the district court concluded that $ 1341 ap-plies to any federal litigation touching on the subject of
state taxes, neither the language nor the legislative his-tory of the statute supports this interpretation. The
text of $ 1341 does not suggest that federal courts shouldtread lightly in issuing orders that might allow local governments to raise additional taxes. The legislative his-tory . . . shows that $ 1341 is designed to ensure that
federal courts do not interfere with states' collection oftaxes, so long as the taxpayers have an opportunity to
present to a court federal defenses to the imposition andcollection of the taxes. The legislative history is filled
with concern that federal judgments were emptying
10 Far from "ignor[ing]" the "plain, speedy and efficient remedy" proviso,
as the dissent charges, post, at 121, we agree that this "codified exception"
is key to a proper understanding of the Act. The statute requires the
State to provide taxpayers with a swift and certain remedy when they
resist tax collections. An action dependent on a court's discretion, for example, would not qualify as a fitting taxpayer's remedy. Cf. supra, at 96.

to resident taxpayers. There was no articulated con-cern about federal courts' flogging state and local governments to collect additional taxes." Dunn v. Carey,808 F. 2d 555, 558 (1986) (emphasis added).

Second Circuit Judge Friendly earlier expressed a similarview of $ 1341:

"The [TIA's] context and the legislative history . . . leadus to conclude that, in speaking of `collection,' Congress
was referring to methods similar to assessment and levy,e. g., distress or execution . . . that would produce money
or other property directly, rather than indirectlythrough a more general use of coercive power. Congress was thinking of cases where taxpayers were re-peatedly using the federal courts to raise questions of
state or federal law going to the validity of the particu-lar taxes

imposed upon them . . . ." Wells v. Malloy,510 F. 2d 74, 77 (1975) (emphasis added).

See also In re Jackson County, 834 F. 2d 150, 151-152 (CA81987) (observing that "$ 1341 has been held to be inapplicable
to efforts to require collection of additional taxes, as opposedto efforts to inhibit the collection of taxes").

11 In conflict with sister Circuits, and at odds with its own prior opinions,
the Fifth Circuit, in ACLU Foundation v. Bridges, 334 F. 3d 416 (2003),
recently construed the TIA in the way the Director does here. Bridges
involved a challenge to tax exemptions for religious activities in several
Louisiana statutes. The District Court, in line with earlier Fifth Circuit
decisions, held that the TIA did not apply because the plaintiff was not
seeking to restrain the "assessment, levy or collection" of state taxes, but
to eliminate allegedly unconstitutional tax exemptions. Reversing, the
Fifth Circuit ruled that the TIA bars any federal suit seeking to have any
portion of a State's tax system declared unconstitutional. Id., at 421-423.

The Director and the United States refer to four other federal-court
decisions lending some support for their view that, for $ 1341 purposes, no
line should be drawn between challenges that would reduce revenues and

Further, numerous federal-court decisions--including de-cisions of this Court reviewing lower federal-court judgments--have reached the merits of third-party constitutionalchallenges to tax benefits without mentioning the TIA. See,
e. g., Byrne v. Public Funds for Public Schools of New Jer-sey, 442 U. S. 907 (1979), summarily aff 'g 590 F. 2d 514 (CA3

Development, 959 F. 2d 395 (CA2 1992); Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Collins,

States Brewers Assn., Inc. v. Perez, 592 F. 2d 1212 (CA1 1979)). See also
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 14-15. In two of the cases,
taxpayers were seeking relief aimed at lightening their own tax burdens.
Kraebel held that $ 1341 barred a taxpayer's constitutional challenge to a
property-tax exemption and abatement scheme. 959 F. 2d, at 400. Colonial Pipeline held that a taxpayer's suit seeking a court-ordered redistribution of Georgia's ad valorem tax system, which might have reduced
plaintiff's tax bill, implicated $ 1341's jurisdictional bar. 921 F. 2d, at 1243.
The court did observe, broadly: "[The] requested relief, if granted, . . .
would clearly conflict with the principle underlying the [TIA] that the
federal courts should generally avoid interfering with the sensitive and
peculiarly local concerns surrounding state taxation schemes." Id., at
1242.

Gillis, unlike Kraebel and Colonial Pipeline, was a third-party action.
The court declined to decide "[w]hether the [TIA] actually does bar the
availability of such relief," but noted that a suit seeking to enhance state
revenues may nonetheless fall within $ 1341's bar because "the Act is not,
by its own language, limited to the collection of taxes." 836 F. 2d, at 1005
(emphasis in original). Finally, Perez concerned the Butler Act, 48
U. S. C. $ 872, a TIA analog applicable to Puerto Rico. Ordering dismissal
of the case for want of jurisdiction, the court rested its decision not on
statutory construction, but on "underl[ying]" comity concerns, stating:
"[A]n order of a federal court requiring Commonwealth officials to collect
taxes which its legislature has not seen fit to impose on its citizens strikes
us as a particularly inappropriate involvement in a state's management of
its fiscal operations." 592 F. 2d, at 1214-1215.

not lessen this Court's obligation correctly to interpret a

It merits emphasis, however, thatprolonged congressional silence in response to a settled interpretation of a federal statute provides powerful supportfor maintaining the status quo. In statutory matters, judicial restraint strongly counsels waiting for Congress to takethe initiative in modifying rules on which judges and litigants have relied. See BedRoc Limited, LLC v. United

(1976) (Stevens, J., concurring). In a contest between thedictionary and the doctrine of

stare decisis, the latter clearly
wins. The Court's fine opinion, which I join without reser-vation, is consistent with these views.

Justice Kennedy, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

In this case, the Court shows great skepticism for the statecourts' ability to vindicate constitutional wrongs. Two

points make clear that the Court treats States as diminishedand disfavored powers, rather than merely applies statutory
text. First, the Court's analysis of the Tax Injunction Act(TIA or Act), 28 U. S. C. $ 1341, contrasts with a literal reading of its terms. Second, the Court's assertion that legisla-tive histories support the conclusion that "[t]hird-party suits
not seeking to stop the collection (or contest the validity) of
a tax imposed on plaintiffs . . . were outside Congress' purview" in enacting the TIA and the anti-injunction provision
on which the TIA was modeled, ante, at 104, is not borne out
by those sources, as previously recognized by the Court. In
light of these points, today's holding should probably be attributed to the concern the Court candidly shows animates
it. See ante, at 93 (noting it was the federal courts that
"upheld the Constitution's equal protection requirement"
when States circumvented Brown v. Board of Education,
347 U. S. 483 (1954), by manipulating their tax laws). The
concern, it seems, is that state courts are second rate constitutional arbiters, unequal to their federal counterparts.
State courts are due more respect than this. Dismissive
treatment of state courts is particularly unjustified since the
TIA, by express terms, provides a federal safeguard: The
Act lifts its bar on federal-court intervention when state
courts fail to provide "a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy." $ 1341.

In view of the TIA's text, the congressional judgment that
state courts are qualified constitutional arbiters, and the re542US1 Unit: $U61 [11-01-06 14:24:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

state-court adjudication. I agree with the majority that thepetition for certiorari was timely under 28 U. S. C. $ 2101(c),
see ante, at 96-99, and so submit this respectful dissent onthe merits of the decision.

I
Today is the first time the Court has considered whetherthe TIA bars federal district courts from granting injunctive

relief that would prevent States from giving citizens statuto-rily mandated state tax credits. There are cases, some dating back almost 50 years, which proceeded as if the jurisdic-tional bar did not apply to tax credit challenges; but some
more recent decisions have said the bar is applicable. Com-pare, e. g., Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388 (1983); Committee
for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756(1973); Griffin v. School Bd. of Prince Edward Cty., 377 U. S.
218 (1964), with, e. g., ACLU Foundation of La. v. Bridges,334 F. 3d 416 (CA5 2003); In re Gillis, 836 F. 2d 1001 (CA6
1988). While unexamined custom favors the first position,the statutory text favors the latter. In these circumstances
a careful explanation for the conclusion is necessary; but inthe end the scope and purpose of the Act should be understood from its terms alone.The question presented--whether the TIA bars the District Court from granting injunctive relief against the taxcredit--requires two inquiries. First, the term assessment,
as used in $ 1341, must be defined. Second, we must deter-mine if an injunction prohibiting the Director of Arizona's
Department of Revenue (Director) from allowing the creditwould enjoin, suspend, or restrain an assessment.

The word assessment in the TIA is not isolated from itsuse in another federal statute. The TIA was modeled on
the anti-injunction provision of the Internal Revenue Code(Code), 26 U. S. C. $ 7421(a). See

Jefferson County v. Acker,527 U. S. 423, 434 (1999). That provision specifies, and has

Kennedy, J., dissenting
specified since 1867, that federal courts may not restrain orenjoin an "assessment or collection of any [federal] tax." 26

U. S. C. $ 7421(a) (first codified by Act of Mar. 2, 1867, ch. 169,$ 10, 14 Stat. 475). The meaning of the term assessment in
this Code provision is discernible by reference to other Codesections. 26 U. S. C. $ 1

et seq.
Chapter 63 of Title 26 addresses the subject of assessments and sheds light on the meaning of the term inthe Code. Section 6201 first instructs that "[t]he Secretary [of the Internal Revenue Service] is . . . required tomake the . . . assessments of all taxes . . . imposed by this
title . . . ." 26 U. S. C. $ 6201(a). Further it provides, "[t]he
Secretary shall assess all taxes determined by the taxpayer
or by the Secretary . . . ." $ 6201(a)(1). Section 6203 in
turn sets forth a method for making an assessment: "The
assessment shall be made by recording the liability of the
taxpayer in the office of the Secretary."

Taken together, the provisions of Title 26 establish that an
assessment, as that term is used in $ 7421(a), must at the
least encompass the recording of a taxpayer's ultimate tax
liability. This is what the taxpayer owes the Government.
See also Laing v. United States, 423 U. S. 161, 170, n. 13
(1976) ("The `assessment,' essentially a bookkeeping notation, is made when the Secretary or his delegate establishes
an account against the taxpayer on the tax rolls"). Whether
the Secretary or his delegate (today, the Commissioner)
makes the recording on the basis of a taxpayer's selfreported filing form or instead chooses to rely on his own
calculation of the taxpayer's liability (e. g., via an audit) is
irrelevant. The recording of the liability on the Government's tax rolls is itself an assessment.

The TIA was modeled on the anti-injunction provision, see
Jefferson County, supra; it incorporates the same terminology employed by the provision; and it employs that terminology for the same purpose. It is sensible, then, to interpret
the TIA's terms by reference to the Code's use of the term.

Cf. Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 581 (1978) ("[W]here, as
here, Congress adopts a new law incorporating sections of a
prior law, Congress normally can be presumed to have had
knowledge of the interpretation given to the incorporated
law, at least insofar as it affects the new statute"). The
Court of Appeals, which concluded that an assessment was
the official estimate of the value of income or property used
to calculate a tax or the imposition of a tax on someone,
Winn v. Killian, 307 F. 3d 1011, 1015 (CA9 2002), placed principal reliance for its interpretation on a dictionary definition.
That was not entirely misplaced; but unless the definition is
considered in the context of the prior statute, the advantage
of that statute's interpretive guidance is lost.

Furthermore, the court defined the term in an unusual
way. It relied on a dictionary that was unavailable when
the TIA was enacted; it relied not on the definition of the
term under consideration, "assessment," but on the definition
of the term's related verb form, "assess"; and it examined
only a portion of that term's definition. In the dictionary
used by the Court of Appeals, the verb is defined in two
ways not noted by the court. One of the alternative definitions is quite relevant--"(2) to fix or determine the amount
of (damages, a tax, a fine, etc.)." Compare ibid. with Random House Dictionary of the English Language 90 (1979).
Further:

"Had [the panel] looked in a different lay dictionary, [it]
would have found a definition contrary to the one it preferred, such as `the entire plan or scheme fixed upon for
charging or taxing.' . . . Had the panel considered tax
treatises and law dictionaries . . . it would have found
much in accord with this broader definition. . . . Even
the federal income tax code supports a broad reading of
`assessment.' " Winn v. Killian, 321 F. 3d 911, 912
(CA9 2003) (Kleinfeld, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).

Kennedy, J., dissenting
Guided first by the Internal Revenue Code, an assessment
under $ 1341, at a minimum, is the recording of taxpayers'
liability on the State's tax rolls. The TIA, though a federal
statute that must be interpreted as a matter of federal law,
operates in a state-law context. In this respect, the Act
must be interpreted so as to apply evenly to the 50 various
state-law regimes and to the various recording schemes
States employ. It is therefore irrelevant whether state officials record taxpayer liabilities with their own pen in a specified location, by collecting and maintaining taxpayers' selfreported filing forms, or in some other manner. The
recordkeeping that equates to the determination of taxpayer
liability on the State's tax rolls is the assessment, whatever
the method. The Court seems to agree with this. See
ante, at 99-102.

The dictionary definition of assessment provides further
relevant information. Contemporaneous dictionaries from
the time of the TIA's enactment define assessment in expansive terms. They would broaden any understanding of the
term, and so the Act's bar. See, e. g., Webster's New International Dictionary 139 (1927) (providing three context relevant definitions for the term assessment: It is the act of apportioning or determining an amount to be paid; a valuation
of property for the purpose of taxation; or the entire plan or
scheme fixed upon for charging or taxing). See also United
States v. Galletti, 541 U. S. 114, 122 (2004) (noting that under
the Code the term assessment refers not only to recordings
of tax liability but also to "the calculation . . . of a tax liability," including self-calculation done by the taxpayer). The
Court need not decide the full scope of the term assessment
in the TIA, however. For present purposes, a narrow definition of the term suffices. Applying the narrowest definition, the TIA's literal text bars district courts from enjoining,
suspending, or restraining a State's recording of taxpayer
liability on its tax rolls, whether the recordings are made by

Kennedy, J., dissenting
self-reported taxpayer filing forms or by a State's calculationof taxpayer liability.

The terms "enjoin, suspend, or restrain" require littlescrutiny. No doubt, they have discrete purposes in the context of the TIA; but they also have a common meaning.They refer to actions that restrict assessments to varying
degrees. It is noteworthy that the term "enjoin" has not
just its meaning in the restrictive sense but also has meaningin an affirmative sense. The Black's Law Dictionary current

at the TIA's enactment gives as a definition of the term, "torequire; command; positively direct." Black's Law Dictionary 663 (3d ed. 1933). That definition may well be implicated here, since an order invalidating a tax credit would
seem to command States to collect taxes they otherwise
would not collect. The parties, however, proceed on the assumption that enjoin means to bar. It is unobjectionable for
the Court to make the assumption too, leaving the broader
definition for later consideration.

Respondents argue the TIA does not bar the injunction
they seek because even after the credit is enjoined, the Director will be able to record and enforce taxpayers' liabilities. See Brief for Respondents 16. In fact, respondents
say, with the credit out of the way the Director will be able
to record and enforce a higher level of liability and so profit
the State. Ibid. ("The amount of tax payable by some taxpayers would increase, but that can hardly be characterized
as an injunction or restraint of the assessment process").
The argument, however, ignores an important part of

the Act: "under State law." 28 U. S. C. $ 1341 ("The district courts shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment . . . of any tax under State law"). The Act not only
bars district courts from enjoining, suspending, or restraining a State's recording of taxpayer liabilities altogether; but
it also bars them from enjoining, suspending, or restraining
a State from recording the taxpayer liability that state law
mandates.

Arizona Rev. Stat. Ann. $43-1089 (West Supp. 2003) isstate law. It is an integral part of the State's tax statute; it

is reflected on state tax forms; and the State Supreme Courthas held that it is part of the calculus necessary to determine
tax liability. See Kotterman v. Killian, 193 Ariz. 273, 279,285, 972 P. 2d 606, 612, 618 (1999). A recording of a taxpayer's liability under state law must be made in accordancewith $ 43-1089. The same can be said with respect to each
and every provision of the State's tax law. To order theDirector not to record on the State's tax rolls taxpayer liability that reflects the operation of $ 43-1089 (or any other statetax law provision for that matter) would be to bar the Director from recording the correct taxpayer liability. The TIA'slanguage bars this relief and so bars this suit.

The Court tries to avoid this conclusion by saying thatthe recordings that constitute assessments under $ 1341 must
have a "collection-propelling function," ante, at 102, and thatthe recordings at issue here do not have such a function.
See also ante, at 102, n. 4 ("[T]he dissent would disconnectthe word [assessment] from the enforcement process").
That is wrong. A recording of taxpayer liability on theState's tax rolls of course propels collection. In most cases
the taxpayer's payment will accompany his filing, and thuswill accompany the assessment so that no literal collection
of moneys is necessary. As anyone who has paid taxes mustknow, however, if owed payment were not included with the
tax filing, the State's recording of one's liability on the State'srolls would certainly cause subsequent collection efforts, for
the filing's recording (i. e., the assessment) would propel col-lection by establishing the State's legal right to the taxpayer's moneys. II

The majority offers prior judicial interpretations of theCode's similarly worded anti-injunction provision to support
its contrary conclusions about the statutory text. See ante,at 102-103. That this Court and other federal courts have

allowed nontaxpayer suits challenging tax credits to proceedin the face of the anti-injunction provision is not at all controlling. Those cases are quite distinguishable. Had theplaintiffs in those cases been barred from suit, there would
have been no available forum at all for their claims. See
McGlotten v. Connally, 338 F. Supp. 448, 453-454 (DC 1972)
(three-judge court) ("The preferred course of raising [such
tax exemption and deduction] objections in a suit for refundis not available. In this situation we cannot read the statute

to bar the present suit"). See also Tax Analysts and Advocates v. Shultz, 376 F. Supp. 889, 892 (DC 1974) ("Since plaintiffs are not seeking to restrain the collection of taxes, and
since they cannot obtain relief through a refund suit, [26
U. S. C.] $ 7421(a) does not bar the injunctive relief they
seek"). The Court ratified those decisions only insofar as
they relied on this limited rationale as the basis for an exception to the statutory bar on adjudication. See South Carolina v. Regan, 465 U. S. 367, 373 (1984) (holding the antiinjunction provision inapplicable to a State's challenge to
the constitutionality of a federal tax exemption provision,

$ 103(a) of the Code (which exempts from a taxpayer's gross
income the interest earned on the obligations of any State),
as amended by $ 310(b)(1) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal
Responsibility Act of 1982, 96 Stat. 596, because "the
[anti-injunction provision] was not intended to bar an action
where . . . Congress has not provided the plaintiff with an
alternative legal way to challenge the validity of a tax").
Even that strict limitation was not strict enough for four
Members of the Court, one of whom noted "the broad sweep
of the [a]nti-[i]njunction [provision]." 465 U. S., at 382
(Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment). The other three
Justices went further still. They would have allowed an
exception to the anti-injunction provision's literal bar on nontaxpayer suits challenging tax exemption provisions only if
due process rights were at stake. See id., at 394 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) ("Bob Jones University's

Kennedy, J., dissenting
recognition that the complete inaccessibility of judicial re-view might implicate due process concerns provides absolutely no basis for crafting an exception" to the anti-injunction Act for a plaintiff who has "no due process right
to review of its claim in a judicial forum").In contrast to the anti-injunction provision, the TIA on its
own terms ensures an adequate forum for claims it bars.
The TIA specially exempts actions that could not be heardin state courts by providing an exception for instances

"where a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy may [not] be hadin the courts of [the] State." 28 U. S. C. $ 1341. The TIA's
text thus already incorporates the check that Regan concluded could be read into the anti-injunction provision even
though "[t]he [anti-injunction provision]'s language `could
scarcely be more explicit' in prohibiting nontaxpayer suits
like this one." 465 U. S., at 385 (O'Connor, J., concurring
in judgment) (quoting Bob Jones Univ. v. Simon, 416 U. S.
725, 736 (1974)). The practical effect is that a literal reading
of the TIA provides for federal district courts to stand at the
ready where litigants encounter legal or practical obstacles
to challenging state tax credits in state courts. And this
Court, of course, stands at the ready to review decisions by
state courts on these matters.

The Court does not discuss this codified exception, yet the
clause is crucial. It represents a congressional judgment
about the balance that should exist between the respect due
to the States (for both their administration of tax schemes
and their courts' interpretation of tax laws) and the need
for constitutional vindication. To ignore the provision is to
ignore that Congress has already balanced these interests.

Respondents admit they would be heard in state court.
Indeed a quite similar action previously was heard there.
See Kotterman v. Killian, 193 Ariz. 273, 972 P. 2d 606 (1999).
As a result, the TIA's exception (akin to that recognized by
Regan) does not apply. To proceed as if it does is to replace
Congress' balancing of the noted interests with the Court's.

The Court and respondents further argue that the TIA'spolicy purposes and relatedly the federal anti-injunction provision's policy purposes (as discerned from legislative histor-ies) justify today's holding. The two Acts, they say, reflect
a unitary purpose: "In both . . . Congress directed taxpayersto pursue refund suits instead of attempting to restrain [tax]
collections." Ante, at 104. See also ante, at 105 (concludingthat the Act's underlying purpose is to bar suits by "taxpayers who sought to avoid paying their tax bill"); see also Brieffor Respondents 18-20. This purpose, the Court and respondents say, shows that the Act was not intended to fore-close relief in challenges to tax credits. The proposition
rests on the premise that the TIA's sole purpose is to preventdistrict court orders that would decrease the moneys in state
fiscs. Because the legislative histories of the Acts are notcarefully limited in the manner that this reading suggests,
the policy argument against a literal application of the Act'sterms fails.

Taking the federal anti-injunction provision first, as hasbeen noted before, "[its] history expressly reflects the congressional desire that all injunctive suits against the tax col-lector be prohibited." Regan, 465 U. S., at 387 (O'C

onnor,J., concurring in judgment). The provision responded to

"the grave dangers which accompany intrusion of the injunc-tive power of the courts into the administration of the revenue." Id., at 388. It "generally precludes judicial resolu-tion of all abstract tax controversies," whether brought by a
taxpayer or a nontaxpayer. Id., at 392; see also id., at 387-392 (reviewing the legislative history of the anti-injunction
provision, its various amendments, and related enactments).Thus, the provision's object is not just to bar suits that might
"interrupt `the process of collecting . . . taxes,' " but "[s]imi-larly, the language and history evidence a congressional desire to prohibit courts from restraining any aspect of the taxlaws' administration."

Id., at 399.

The majority's reading of the TIA's legislative history isalso inconsistent with the interpretation of this same history

in the Court's earlier cases. The Court has made clear thatthe TIA's purpose is not only to protect the fisc but also to
protect the State's tax system administration and tax policyimplementation.

California v. Grace Brethren Church, 457
U. S. 393 (1982), is a prime example.

In Grace Brethren Church the Court held that the TIAnot only bars actions by individuals to stop tax collectors

from collecting moneys (i. e., injunctive suits) but also barsdeclaratory suits. See

id., at 408-410. The Court explained that permitting declaratory suits to proceed would"defea[t] the principal purpose of the Tax Injunction Act: `to

limit drastically federal district court jurisdiction to inter-fere with so important a local concern as the collection of
taxes.' " Id., at 408-409 (quoting Rosewell v. LaSalle Nat.
Bank, 450 U. S. 503, 522 (1981)). It continued:

" `If federal declaratory relief were available to teststate tax assessments, state tax administration might be

thrown into disarray, and taxpayers might escape theordinary procedural requirements imposed by state law.
During the pendency of the federal suit the collection ofrevenue under the challenged law might be obstructed,
with consequent damage to the State's budget, and perhaps a shift to the State of the risk of taxpayer in-solvency. Moreover, federal constitutional issues are

likely to turn on questions of state tax law, which, likeissues of state regulatory law, are more properly heard
in the state courts.' " Grace Brethren Church, supra,
at 410 (quoting with approval Perez v. Ledesma, 401

U. S. 82, 128, n. 17 (1971) (Brennan, J., concurring in part
and dissenting in part)).

While this, of course, demonstrates that protecting the
state fisc from damage is part of the TIA's purpose, it equally
shows that actions that would throw the "state tax adminis542US1 Unit: $U61 [11-01-06 14:24:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN
124 HIBBS v. WINN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
tration . . . into disarray" also implicate the Act and its pur-pose. The Court's concern with preventing administrative

disarray puts in context its explanation that the TIA's princi-pal concern is to limit federal district court interference with
the "collection of taxes." The phrase, in this context, refersto the operation of the whole tax collection system and the
implementation of entire tax policy, not just a part of it.While an order interfering with a specific collection suit disrupts one of the most essential aspects of a State's tax sys-tem, it is not the only way in which federal courts can disrupt
the State's tax system:

"[T]he legislative history of the Tax Injunction Act dem-onstrates that Congress worried not so much about the

form of relief available in the federal courts, as aboutdivesting the federal courts of jurisdiction to interfere
with state tax administration." Grace Brethen Church,supra, at 409, n. 22.

The Court's decisions in Fair Assessment in Real EstateAssn., Inc. v. McNary, 454 U. S. 100 (1981), National Private
Truck Council, Inc. v. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n, 515 U. S. 582(1995) (NPTC), and Rosewell, supra, make the same point.
Though the majority says these cases support its holding be-cause they "involved plaintiffs who mounted federal litigation to avoid paying state taxes," ante, at 106, the languageof these cases is too clear to be ignored and is contrary to
the Court's holding today. In Fair Assessment, the Courtobserved that "[t]he [TIA] `has its roots in equity practice,
in principles of federalism, and in recognition of the impera-tive need of a State to administer its own fiscal operations.'
This last consideration was [its] principal motivating force."454 U. S., at 110 (quoting

Rosewell, supra, at 522, in turnquoting Tully v. Griffin, Inc., 429 U. S. 68, 73 (1976) (other

citation omitted)). In NPTC, the Court said, "Congress andthis Court repeatedly have shown an aversion to federal interference with state tax administration. The passage ofthe [TIA] in 1937 is one manifestation of this aversion." 515

125Cite as: 542 U. S. 88 (2004)
Kennedy, J., dissenting
U. S., at 586 (summing up this aversion, generated also fromprinciples of comity and federalism, as creating a "background presumption that federal law generally will not inter-fere with administration of state taxes,"

id., at 588). In
Rosewell, the Court described the Act's language as "broad"and "prophylactic." 450 U. S., at 524 (majority opinion of

Brennan, J.). See also ibid. (the TIA was "passed to limit
federal-court interference in state tax matters").The Act is designed to respect not only the administration

of state tax systems but also state-court authority to saywhat state law means. "[F]ederal constitutional issues are
likely to turn on questions of state tax law, which, like issues
of state regulatory law, are more properly heard in the state
courts." Grace Brethren Church, supra, at 410 (internal
quotation marks omitted). See also Rosewell, supra, at 527.
This too establishes that the TIA's purpose is not solely to
ensure that the State's fisc is not decreased. There would
be only a diminished interest in allowing state courts to say
what the State's tax statutes mean if the Act protected just
the state fisc. The TIA protects the responsibility of the
States and their courts to administer their own tax systems
and to be accountable to the citizens of the State for their
policies and decisions. The majority objects that "there is
no disagreement as to the meaning of " state law in this case,
ante, at 106, n. 8. As an initial matter, it is not clear that
this is a fair conclusion. The litigation in large part turns
on what state law requires and whether the product of those
requirements violates the Constitution. More to the point,
however, even if there were no controversy about the statutory framework the Arizona tax provision creates, the majority's ruling has implications far beyond this case and will
most certainly result in federal courts in other States and in
other cases being required to interpret state tax law in order
to complete their review of challenges to state tax statutes.

Our heretofore consistent interpretation of the Act's legislative history to prohibit interference with state tax systems

542US1 Unit: $U61 [11-01-06 14:24:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN
126 HIBBS v. WINN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
and their administration accords with the direct, broad, andunqualified language of the statute. The Act bars all orders

that enjoin, suspend, or restrain the assessment of any taxunder state law. In effecting congressional intent we should
give full force to simple and broad proscriptions in the statu-tory language.

Because the TIA's language and purpose are comprehen-sive, arguments based on congressional silence on the question whether the TIA applies to actions that increase moneysa state tax system collects are of no moment. Contra,
Winn, 307 F. 3d, at 1017-1018 (relying on Dunn v. Carey, 808F. 2d 555, 558 (CA7 1986)); see also

ante, at 108-109 (relyingon Dunn). Whatever weight one gives to legislative histories, silence in the legislative record is irrelevant when a plaincongressional declaration exists on a matter. "[W]hen
terms are unambiguous we may not speculate on probabili-ties of intention." Insurance Co. v. Ritchie, 5 Wall. 541, 545
(1867). Here, Congress has said district courts are barredfrom disrupting the State's tax operations. It is immaterial
whether the State's collection is raised or lowered. A courtorder will thwart and replace the State's chosen tax policy if
it causes either result. No authority supports the proposi-tion that a State lacks an interest in reducing its citizens' tax
burden. It is a troubling proposition for this Court to pro-ceed on the assumption that the State's interest in limiting the tax burden on its citizens to that for which its lawprovides is a secondary policy, deserving of little respect
from us. IV

The final basis on which both the majority and respondentsrest is that years of unexamined habit by litigants and the
courts alike have resulted in federal courts' entertainingchallenges to state tax credits. See

ante, at 110-111 (citingrepresentative cases). While we should not reverse the

course of our unexamined practice lightly, our obligation isto give a correct interpretation of the statute. We are not

obliged to maintain the status quo when the status quo is
unfounded. The exercise of federal jurisdiction does not and
cannot establish jurisdiction. See United States v. L. A.
Tucker Truck Lines, Inc., 344 U. S. 33, 37-38 (1952). "[T]his
Court is not bound by a prior exercise of jurisdiction in a
case where it was not questioned and it was passed sub silentio." Id., at 38. In this respect, the present case is no
different than Federal Election Comm'n v. NRA Political
Victory Fund, 513 U. S. 88 (1994). The case presented the
question whether we had jurisdiction to consider a certiorari
petition filed by the Federal Election Commission (FEC),
and not by the Solicitor General on behalf of the FEC.
The Court held that it lacked jurisdiction. See id., at 99.
Though that answer seemed to contradict the Court's prior
practices, the Court said:

"Nor are we impressed by the FEC's argument that it
has represented itself before this Court on several occasions in the past without any question having been
raised about its authority to do so . . . . The jurisdiction
of this Court was challenged in none of these actions,
and therefore the question is an open one before us."
Id., at 97.

See also Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S. 58,
63, n. 4 (1989) (" `[T]his Court has never considered itself
bound when a subsequent case finally brings the jurisdictional issue before us.' Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U. S. 528, 535,
n. 5 (1974)" (alteration in original)). These cases make clear
that our failure to consider a question hardly equates to a
thing's being decided. Contra, ante, at 112-113 (Stevens,
J., concurring) (referring to prior silences of the courts with
respect to the TIA as stare decisis and settled interpretation). As a consequence, I would follow the statutory
language.

PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE v. SUDERS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 03-95. Argued March 31, 2004--Decided June 14, 2004
In March 1998, the Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) hired plaintiffrespondent Suders to work as a police communications operator for the
McConnellsburg barracks, where her male supervisors subjected her to
a continuous barrage of sexual harassment. In June 1998, Suders told
the PSP's Equal Employment Opportunity Officer, Virginia SmithElliott, that she might need help, but neither woman followed up on the
conversation. Two months later, Suders contacted Smith-Elliott again,
this time reporting that she was being harassed and was afraid.
Smith-Elliott told Suders to file a complaint, but did not tell her how to
obtain the necessary form. Two days later, Suders' supervisors arrested her for theft of her own computer-skills exam papers. Suders
had removed the papers after concluding that the supervisors had
falsely reported that she had repeatedly failed, when in fact, the exams
were never forwarded for grading. Suders then resigned from the
force and sued the PSP, alleging, inter alia, that she had been subjected
to sexual harassment and constructively discharged, in violation of Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

The District Court granted the PSP's motion for summary judgment.
Although recognizing that Suders' testimony would permit a fact trier
to conclude that her supervisors had created a hostile work environment, the court nevertheless held that the PSP was not vicariously liable for the supervisors' conduct. In support of its decision, the District
Court referred to Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775, 808. In that
case, and in Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742, decided
the same day, this Court held that an employer is strictly liable for
supervisor harassment that "culminates in a tangible employment action, such as discharge, demotion, or undesirable reassignment." Id.,
at 765. But when no such tangible action is taken, both decisions
also hold, the employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability. To
prevail on the basis of the defense, the employer must prove that "(a) [it]
exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually
harassing behavior," and that (b) the employee "unreasonably failed to
take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided
by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise." Ibid. Suders' hostile
work environment claim was untenable as a matter of law, the District

130 PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE v. SUDERS

Syllabus
Court stated, because she unreasonably failed to avail herself of the
PSP's internal antiharassment procedures. The court did not address
Suders' constructive discharge claim.

The Third Circuit reversed and remanded the case for trial. The
appeals court disagreed with the District Court in two key respects:
First, even if the PSP could assert the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative
defense, genuine issues of material fact existed about the effectiveness
of the PSP's program to address sexual harassment claims; second, Suders had stated a claim of constructive discharge due to hostile work
environment. The appeals court ruled that a constructive discharge, if
proved, constitutes a tangible employment action that renders an employer strictly liable and precludes recourse to the Ellerth/Faragher
affirmative defense.

Held: To establish "constructive discharge," a plaintiff alleging sexual

harassment must show that the abusive working environment became
so intolerable that her resignation qualified as a fitting response. An
employer may assert the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense to such
a claim unless the plaintiff quit in reasonable response to an adverse
action officially changing her employment status or situation, e. g., a humiliating demotion, extreme cut in pay, or transfer to a position in which
she would face unbearable working conditions. Pp. 141-152.

(a) Under the constructive discharge doctrine, an employee's reasonable decision to resign because of unendurable working conditions is
assimilated to a formal discharge for remedial purposes. The inquiry
is objective: Did working conditions become so intolerable that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign? This doctrine was developed by the National Labor Relations
Board in the 1930's, and was solidly established in the lower federal
courts by 1964, when Title VII was enacted. The Court agrees that
Title VII encompasses employer liability for a constructive discharge.
Pp. 141-143.

(b) This case concerns employer liability for one subset of constructive discharge claims: those resulting from sexual harassment, or "hostile work environment," attributable to a supervisor. The Court's
starting point is the Ellerth/Faragher framework. Those decisions delineate two categories of sexual harassment claims: (1) those alleging a
"tangible employment action," for which employers may be held strictly
liable; and (2) those asserting no tangible employment action, in which
case employers may assert the affirmative defense. Ellerth, 524 U. S.,
at 765. The key issues here are: Into which Ellerth/Faragher category
hostile-environment constructive discharge claims fall, and what proof
burdens the parties bear in such cases. In Ellerth and Faragher, the

542US1 Unit: $U62 [10-25-06 13:51:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

131Cite as: 542 U. S. 129 (2004)
Syllabus
Court invoked the principle drawn from agency law that an employer is
liable for the acts of its agent when the agent is "aided in accomplishing
the tort by the existence of the agency relation." Ellerth, 524 U. S., at
758. When a supervisor engaged in harassing conduct takes a tangible
employment action against a subordinate, the Court reasoned, it is beyond question that the supervisor is aided by the agency relation. A
tangible employment action, the Court stated, is an "official act of the
enterprise" and "fall[s] within the special province of the supervisor."
Id., at 762. In contrast, when supervisor harassment does not culminate in a tangible employment action, Ellerth and Faragher explained,
it is less obvious that the agency relation is the driving force. The
Court also recognized that a liability limitation linked to an employer's
effort to install effective grievance procedures and an employee's effort
to report harassing behavior would advance Title VII's conciliation and
deterrence purposes. Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 764. Accordingly, the
Court held that when no tangible employment action is taken, an employer may defeat vicarious liability for supervisor harassment by establishing the two-part affirmative defense. That defense, the Court
observed, accommodates the "avoidable consequences" doctrine Title
VII "borrows from tort law," ibid., by requiring plaintiffs reasonably to
stave off avoidable harm. Ellerth and Faragher clarify, however, that
the defending employer bears the burden to prove that the plaintiffemployee unreasonably failed to avoid or reduce harm. Faragher, 524
U. S., at 807. Pp. 143-146.

(1) The constructive discharge at issue stems from, and can be regarded as an aggravated case of, sexual harassment or hostile work
environment. For an atmosphere of harassment or hostility to be actionable, the offending behavior must be sufficiently severe or pervasive
to alter the victim's employment conditions and create an abusive working environment. Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57,
67. A hostile-environment constructive discharge claim entails something more: working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable person
would have felt compelled to resign. Suders' claim is of the same genre
as the claims analyzed in Ellerth and Faragher. Essentially, Suders
presents a "worse case" harassment scenario, harassment ratcheted up
to the breaking point. Like the harassment considered in Ellerth and
Faragher, harassment so intolerable as to cause a resignation may be
effected through co-worker conduct, unofficial supervisory conduct, or
official company acts. Unlike an actual termination, which is always
effected through an official company act, a constructive discharge may
or may not involve official action. When it does not, the extent to which
the agency relationship aided the supervisor's misconduct is less certain,
and that uncertainty justifies affording the employer the chance to es542US1 Unit: $U62 [10-25-06 13:51:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
132 PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE v. SUDERS

Syllabus
tablish, through the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense, that it should
not be held vicariously liable. The Third Circuit erred in drawing the
line differently. Pp. 146-150.

(2) The Third Circuit qualified its holding that a constructive discharge itself constitutes a tangible employment action under Ellerth
and Faragher: The affirmative defense delineated in those cases, the
court noted, might be imported into the anterior issue whether the employee's decision to resign was reasonable under the circumstances.
However, the appeals court left open when and how the Ellerth/
Faragher considerations would be brought home to the fact trier. The
Court of Appeals did not address specifically the allocation of pleading
and persuasion burdens, but simply relied on "the wisdom and expertise
of trial judges to exercise their gatekeeping authority when assessing
whether all, some, or none of the evidence relating to employers' antiharassment programs and to employees' exploration of alternative avenues warrants introduction at trial." 325 F. 3d 432, 463. There is no
cause for leaving the district courts thus unguided. Following Ellerth
and Faragher, the plaintiff who alleges no tangible employment action
has the duty to mitigate harm, but the defendant bears the burden to
allege and prove that the plaintiff failed in that regard. Pp. 150-152.

(c) Although the Third Circuit correctly ruled that the case, in its
current posture, presents genuine issues of material fact concerning
Suders' hostile work environment and constructive discharge claims,
that court erred in declaring the affirmative defense described in Ellerth and Faragher never available in constructive discharge cases.

Plaintiff-respondent Nancy Drew Suders alleged sexuallyharassing conduct by her supervisors, officers of the Pennsylvania State Police (PSP), of such severity she was forced toresign. The question presented concerns the proof burdens
parties bear when a sexual harassment/constructive dis-charge claim of that character is asserted under Title VII of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964.To establish hostile work environment, plaintiffs like Suders must show harassing behavior "sufficiently severe orpervasive to alter the conditions of [their] employment."

environment became so intolerable that her resignation qual-ified as a fitting response. An employer may defend against
such a claim by showing both (1) that it had installeda readily accessible and effective policy for reporting and
resolving complaints of sexual harassment, and (2) thatthe plaintiff unreasonably failed to avail herself of that
employer-provided preventive or remedial apparatus. Thisaffirmative defense will not be available to the employer,
however, if the plaintiff quits in reasonable response to anemployer-sanctioned adverse action officially changing her
employment status or situation, for example, a humiliatingdemotion, extreme cut in pay, or transfer to a position in
which she would face unbearable working conditions. In soruling today, we follow the path marked by our 1998 decisions in Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742,and Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775.

I
Because this case was decided against Suders in the Dis-trict Court on the PSP's motion for summary judgment, we

recite the facts, as summarized by the Court of Appeals, inthe light most favorable to Suders.

1 In March 1998, the PSP

hired Suders as a police communications operator for the Mc-Connellsburg barracks. Suders v. Easton, 325 F. 3d 432, 436

(CA3 2003). Suders' supervisors were Sergeant Eric D.Easton, Station Commander at the McConnellsburg barracks, Patrol Corporal William D. Baker, and Corporal EricB. Prendergast.

Ibid. Those three supervisors subjected

1 The PSP, we note, "vigorously dispute[s]" the truth of Suders' allegations, contending that some of the incidents she describes "never happened
at all," while "others took place in a context quite different from that
suggested by [Suders]." Brief for Petitioner 4, n. 3.

Opinion of the Court
Suders to a continuous barrage of sexual harassment thatceased only when she resigned from the force. Ibid.

Easton "would bring up [the subject of] people having sexwith animals" each time Suders entered his office. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). He told Prendergast, infront of Suders, that young girls should be given instruction
in how to gratify men with oral sex. Ibid. Easton alsowould sit down near Suders, wearing spandex shorts, and
spread his legs apart. Ibid. Apparently imitating a movepopularized by television wrestling, Baker repeatedly made
an obscene gesture in Suders' presence by grabbing his geni-tals and shouting out a vulgar comment inviting oral sex.
Id., at 437. Baker made this gesture as many as five-to-tentimes per night throughout Suders' employment at the barracks. Ibid. Suders once told Baker she " `d[id]n't think[he] should be doing this' "; Baker responded by jumping on
a chair and again performing the gesture, with the accompa-nying vulgarity.

Ibid. Further, Baker would "rub his rearend in front of her and remark `I have a nice ass, don't I?' "

Ibid. Prendergast told Suders " `the village idiot could doher job' "; wearing black gloves, he would pound on furniture
to intimidate her. Ibid.2In June 1998, Prendergast accused Suders of taking a
missing accident file home with her. Id., at 438. After thatincident, Suders approached the PSP's Equal Employment
Opportunity Officer, Virginia Smith-Elliott, and told her she"might need some help."

Ibid. Smith-Elliott gave Sudersher telephone number, but neither woman followed up on the

conversation. Ibid. On August 18, 1998, Suders contactedSmith-Elliott again, this time stating that she was being harassed and was afraid. Ibid. Smith-Elliott told Suders to

2 In addition, the supervisors made derogatory remarks about Suders'
age, e. g., stating " `a 25-year-old could catch on faster' " than she could,
325 F. 3d, at 436, and calling her " `momma,' " id., at 437. They further
harassed her for having political influence. Ibid. Suders' age and
political-affiliation discrimination claims are not before us.

Opinion of the Court
file a complaint, but did not tell her how to obtain the nec-essary form. Smith-Elliott's response and the manner in

which it was conveyed appeared to Suders insensitive andunhelpful.

Ibid.
Two days later, Suders' supervisors arrested her for theft,and Suders resigned from the force. The theft arrest occurred in the following circumstances. Suders had several
times taken a computer-skills exam to satisfy a PSP job re-quirement.

Id., at 438-439. Each time, Suders' supervisors told her that she had failed. Id., at 439. Suders oneday came upon her exams in a set of drawers in the women's

locker room. She concluded that her supervisors had never
forwarded the tests for grading and that their reports of her
failures were false. Ibid. Regarding the tests as her property, Suders removed them from the locker room. Ibid.;
App. 11, 119-120. Upon finding that the exams had been
removed, Suders' supervisors devised a plan to arrest her
for theft. 325 F. 3d, at 438-439. The officers dusted the
drawer in which the exams had been stored with a theftdetection powder that turns hands blue when touched. Id.,
at 439. As anticipated by Easton, Baker, and Prendergast,
Suders attempted to return the tests to the drawer, whereupon her hands turned telltale blue. Ibid. The supervisors
then apprehended and handcuffed her, photographed her
blue hands, and commenced to question her. Ibid. Suders
had previously prepared a written resignation, which she
tendered soon after the supervisors detained her. Ibid.
Nevertheless, the supervisors initially refused to release her.
Instead, they brought her to an interrogation room, gave her
warnings under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966),
and continued to question her. 325 F. 3d, at 439. Suders reiterated that she wanted to resign, and Easton then
let her leave. Ibid. The PSP never brought theft charges
against her.

In September 2000, Suders sued the PSP in Federal District Court, alleging, inter alia, that she had been subjected

42 U. S. C. $ 2000e et seq. App. 1, 12-13.3 At the close ofdiscovery, the District Court granted the PSP's motion for
summary judgment. Suders' testimony, the District Courtrecognized, sufficed to permit a trier of fact to conclude that
the supervisors had created a hostile work environment.
App. to Pet. for Cert. 76a. The court nevertheless held thatthe PSP was not vicariously liable for the supervisors' conduct. Id., at 80a.In so concluding, the District Court referred to our 1998
decision in Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775. See App.to Pet. for Cert. 77a-78a. In

Faragher, along with Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742, decided thesame day, the Court distinguished between supervisor harassment unaccompanied by an adverse official act and super-visor harassment attended by "a tangible employment action." Id., at 765; accord Faragher, 524 U. S., at 808. Both
decisions hold that an employer is strictly liable for supervisor harassment that "culminates in a tangible employment
action, such as discharge, demotion, or undesirable reassignment." Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 765; accord Faragher, 524
U. S., at 808. But when no tangible employment action is
taken, both decisions also hold, the employer may raise an
affirmative defense to liability, subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence: "The defense comprises two necessary elements: (a) that the employer exercised reasonable
care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing
behavior, and (b) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably

3 Suders raised several other claims that are not at issue here, including
claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA),
81 Stat. 602, 29 U. S. C. $ 621 et seq., and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (PHRA), Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 43, $ 951 et seq. (Purdon 1991).

failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective op-portunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise." Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 765; accord Faragher, 524U. S., at 807.

Suders' hostile work environment claim was untenable asa matter of law, the District Court stated, because she "unreasonably failed to avail herself of the PSP's internal procedures for reporting any harassment." App. to Pet. for Cert.80a. Resigning just two days after she first mentioned anything about harassment to Equal Employment OpportunityOfficer Smith-Elliott, the court noted, Suders had "never
given [the PSP] the opportunity to respond to [her] com-plaints."

Ibid. The District Court did not address Suders'
constructive discharge claim.4The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed and

remanded the case for disposition on the merits. 325 F. 3d,at 462. The Third Circuit agreed with the District Court
that Suders had presented evidence sufficient for a trier of
fact to conclude that the supervisors had engaged in a "pattern of sexual harassment that was pervasive and regular."
Id., at 442. But the appeals court disagreed with the District Court in two fundamental respects. First, the Court
of Appeals held that, even assuming the PSP could assert
the affirmative defense described in Ellerth and Faragher,

4 The District Court disposed of all other claims in the PSP's favor. The
court granted the PSP summary judgment on Suders' Title VII retaliation
claim, observing that Suders did not engage in any protected activity, e. g.,
she did not file a discrimination claim, prior to her resignation. Id., at
80a-81a. It dismissed Suders' ADEA and PHRA claims against the PSP
on sovereign immunity grounds, id., at 72a-73a, and her Title VII and
ADEA claims against the individual defendants on the ground that those
statutes do not provide for individual liability, id., at 70a-72a. The court
also dismissed the PHRA claims against the individual defendants because
Suders had failed to respond to the defendants' assertions of immunity.
Id., at 73a-74a. Suders did not raise any of the above claims on appeal.

Opinion of the Court
genuine issues of material fact existed concerning the effec-tiveness of the PSP's "program . . . to address sexual harassment claims." 325 F. 3d, at 443. Second, the appeals courtheld that the District Court erred in failing to recognize that
Suders had stated a claim of constructive discharge due tothe hostile work environment. Ibid.

5

A plaintiff alleging constructive discharge in violation ofTitle VII, the Court of Appeals stated, must establish:

"(1) he or she suffered harassment or discrimination sointolerable that a reasonable person in the same position
would have felt compelled to resign . . . ; and (2) theemployee's reaction to the workplace situation--that is,
his or her decision to resign--was reasonable given thetotality of circumstances . . . ."

Id., at 445.

Viewing the complaint in that context, the court determinedthat Suders had raised genuine issues of material fact relating to her claim of constructive discharge. Id., at 446.The Court of Appeals then made the ruling challenged
here: It held that "a constructive discharge, when proved,constitutes a tangible employment action."

Id., at 447.Under Ellerth and Faragher, the court observed, such an

action renders an employer strictly liable and precludes em-ployer recourse to the affirmative defense announced in
those decisions. 325 F. 3d, at 447. The Third Circuit recog-nized that the Courts of Appeals for the Second and Sixth
Circuits had ruled otherwise. A constructive discharge re-sulting from a supervisor-created hostile work environment,
both Circuits had held, does not qualify as a tangible employ-ment action, and therefore does not stop an employer from

5 Although Suders' complaint did not expressly mention constructive discharge, the Third Circuit found "[t]he allegations of constructive discharge
. . . apparent on the face of Suders's [pleading]." 325 F. 3d, at 443; see
ibid. ("In the very first paragraph, Suders alleged that she was `forced to
suffer a termination of employment because she would not yield to sexual
suggestions [and] innuendoes . . . .' " (quoting Introductory Statement to
Suders' complaint, reprinted in this Court at App. 6)).

invoking the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense. 325 F.3d, at 452-453 (citing

Caridad v. Metro-North Commuter
R. Co., 191 F. 3d 283, 294 (CA2 1999), and Turner v. Dowbrands, Inc., No. 99-3984, 2000 WL 924599, *1 (CA6, June 26,
2000) (unpublished)). The Third Circuit, however, reasonedthat a constructive discharge " `constitutes a significant

change in employment status' by ending the employeremployee relationship" and "also inflicts the same type of`direct economic harm' " as the tangible employment actions

Ellerth and Faragher offered by way of example (discharge,demotion, undesirable reassignment). 325 F. 3d, at 460
(quoting Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 761, 762). Satisfied that Suders had "raised genuine issues of material fact as to her
claim of constructive discharge," and that the PSP was "precluded from asserting the affirmative defense to liability advanced in support of its motion for summary judgment," the
Court of Appeals remanded Suders' Title VII claim for trial.
325 F. 3d, at 461.

This Court granted certiorari, 540 U. S. 1046 (2003), to resolve the disagreement among the Circuits on the question
whether a constructive discharge brought about by supervisor harassment ranks as a tangible employment action and
therefore precludes assertion of the affirmative defense articulated in Ellerth and Faragher. Compare 325 F. 3d, at
461 (constructive discharge qualifies as a tangible employment action); Jaros v. LodgeNet Entertainment Corp., 294
F. 3d 960, 966 (CA8 2002) (same), with Caridad, 191 F. 3d, at
294 (constructive discharge does not qualify as a tangible
employment action); Turner, 2000 WL 924599, *1 (same), and
Reed v. MBNA Marketing Systems, Inc., 333 F. 3d 27, 33
(CA1 2003) (constructive discharge qualifies as a tangible
employment action only when effected through a supervisor's official act); Robinson v. Sappington, 351 F. 3d 317, 336
(CA7 2003) (same). We conclude that an employer does not
have recourse to the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense
when a supervisor's official act precipitates the constructive

Opinion of the Court
discharge; absent such a "tangible employment action," however, the defense is available to the employer whose supervisors are charged with harassment. We therefore vacate the
Third Circuit's judgment and remand the case for further
proceedings.

A

Under the constructive discharge doctrine, an employee's
reasonable decision to resign because of unendurable working conditions is assimilated to a formal discharge for remedial purposes. See 1 B. Lindemann & P. Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 838-839 (3d ed. 1996) (hereinafter
Lindemann & Grossman). The inquiry is objective: Did
working conditions become so intolerable that a reasonable
person in the employee's position would have felt compelled
to resign? See C. Weirich et al., 2002 Cumulative Supplement to Lindemann & Grossman 651-652, and n. 1 (collecting
cases) (hereinafter Weirich).

The constructive discharge concept originated in the
labor-law field in the 1930's; the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) developed the doctrine to address situations
in which employers coerced employees to resign, often by
creating intolerable working conditions, in retaliation for employees' engagement in collective activities. Lieb, Constructive Discharge Under Section 8(a)(3) of the National
Labor Relations Act: A Study in Undue Concern Over Motives, 7 Indus. Rel. L. J. 143, 146-148 (1985); see In re Sterling Corset Co., 9 N. L. R. B. 858, 865 (1938) (first case to use
term "constructive discharg[e]"). Over the next two decades, Courts of Appeals sustained NLRB constructive discharge rulings. See, e. g., NLRB v. East Texas Motor
Freight Lines, 140 F. 2d 404, 405 (CA5 1944) (first Circuit
case to hold supervisor-caused resignation an unfair labor
practice); NLRB v. Saxe-Glassman Shoe Corp., 201 F. 2d 238,
243 (CA1 1953) (first Circuit case to allow backpay award for

constructive discharge). By 1964, the year Title VII wasenacted, the doctrine was solidly established in the federal

courts. See Comment, That's It, I Quit: Returning to FirstPrinciples in Constructive Discharge Doctrine, 23 Berkeley
J. Emp. & Lab. L. 401, 410 (2002).The Courts of Appeals have recognized constructive discharge claims in a wide range of Title VII cases. See, e. g.,
Robinson, 351 F. 3d, at 336-337 (sexual harassment); Moorev.

KUKA Welding Systems & Robot Corp., 171 F. 3d 1073,
1080 (CA6 1999) (race); Bergstrom-Ek v. Best Oil Co., 153F. 3d 851, 858-859 (CA8 1998) (pregnancy);

Baltimore Gas & Elec. Co., 60 F. 3d 1126, 1132-1133 (CA4
1995) (national origin); Derr v. Gulf Oil Corp., 796 F. 2d 340,
343 (CA10 1986) (sex); Young v. Southwestern Sav. & Loan
Assn., 509 F. 2d 140, 143-144 (CA5 1975) (religion). See also
Goss v. Exxon Office Systems Co., 747 F. 2d 885, 887 (CA3
1984) ("[A]pplication of the constructive discharge doctrine
to Title VII cases has received apparently universal recognition among the courts of appeals which have addressed that
issue."); 3 L. Larson, Labor and Employment Law $ 59.05[8]
(2003) (collecting cases). And the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency charged
with implementing Title VII, has stated: An employer "is
responsible for a constructive discharge in the same manner
that it is responsible for the outright discriminatory discharge of a charging party." 2 EEOC Compliance Manual

$612.9(a) (2002).

Although this Court has not had occasion earlier to hold
that a claim for constructive discharge lies under Title VII,
we have recognized constructive discharge in the labor-law
context, see Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467 U. S. 883, 894 (1984)
(NLRB may find employer engaged in unfair labor practice
"when, for the purpose of discouraging union activity, . . .
[the employer] creates working conditions so intolerable that
the employee has no option but to resign--a so-called `constructive discharge.' "). Furthermore, we have stated that

542US1 Unit: $U62 [10-25-06 13:51:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

143Cite as: 542 U. S. 129 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
"Title VII is violated by either explicit or constructive alter-ations in the terms or conditions of employment." Ellerth,

524 U. S., at 752. See also Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v.Vinson, 477 U. S., at 64 ("The phrase `terms, conditions, or
privileges of employment' [in Title VII] evinces a congres-sional intent to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate
treatment of men and women in employment." (some inter-nal quotation marks omitted)). We agree with the lower
courts and the EEOC that Title VII encompasses employerliability for a constructive discharge.

B
This case concerns an employer's liability for one subsetof Title VII constructive discharge claims: constructive discharge resulting from sexual harassment, or "hostile workenvironment," attributable to a supervisor. Our starting
point is the framework Ellerth and Faragher established togovern employer liability for sexual harassment by supervisors.6 As earlier noted, see supra, at 137-138, those deci-sions delineate two categories of hostile work environment
claims: (1) harassment that "culminates in a tangible employ-ment action," for which employers are strictly liable, Ellerth,
524 U. S., at 765; accord Faragher, 524 U. S., at 808, and(2) harassment that takes place in the absence of a tangible
employment action, to which employers may assert an af-firmative defense, Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 765; accord Faragher,
524 U. S., at 807. With the background set out above inmind, we turn to the key issues here at stake: Into which
Ellerth/Faragher category do hostile-environment construc-tive discharge claims fall--and what proof burdens do the
parties bear in such cases.In

Ellerth and Faragher, the plaintiffs-employees soughtto hold their employers vicariously liable for sexual harassment by their supervisors, even though the plaintiffs "suf6 Ellerth and Faragher expressed no view on the employer liability
standard for co-worker harassment. Nor do we.

144 PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE v. SUDERS

Opinion of the Court
fer[ed] no adverse, tangible job consequences." Ellerth, 524U. S., at 747. Setting out a framework for employer liability

in those decisions, this Court noted that Title VII's definitionof "employer" includes the employer's "agent[s]," 42 U. S. C.

$ 2000e(b). See Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 754. We viewed thatdefinition as a direction to "interpret Title VII based on
agency principles." Ibid. The Restatement (Second) of
Agency (1957) (hereinafter Restatement), the Court noted,states (in its black-letter formulation) that an employer is

liable for the acts of its agent when the agent " `was aided inaccomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation.' " Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 758 (quoting Restatement

$ 219(2)(d)); accord Faragher, 524 U. S., at 801.

We then identified "a class of cases where, beyond question, more than the mere existence of the employment relation aids in commission of the harassment: when a supervisor
takes a tangible employment action against the subordinate." Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 760. A tangible employment
action, the Court explained, "constitutes a significant change
in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits."
Id., at 761. Unlike injuries that could equally be inflicted
by a co-worker, we stated, tangible employment actions "fall
within the special province of the supervisor," who "has been
empowered by the company as . . . [an] agent to make economic decisions affecting other employees under his or her
control." Id., at 762. The tangible employment action, the
Court elaborated, is, in essential character, "an official act of
the enterprise, a company act." Ibid. It is "the means by
which the supervisor brings the official power of the enterprise to bear on subordinates." Ibid. Often, the supervisor will "use [the company's] internal processes" and thereby
"obtain the imprimatur of the enterprise." Ibid. Ordinarily, the tangible employment decision "is documented in
official company records, and may be subject to review by

542US1 Unit: $U62 [10-25-06 13:51:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

145Cite as: 542 U. S. 129 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
higher level supervisors." Ibid. In sum, we stated, "whena supervisor takes a tangible employment action against a

subordinate[,] . . . it would be implausible to interpret agencyprinciples to allow an employer to escape liability."

Id., at
762-763.When a supervisor's harassment of a subordinate does not

culminate in a tangible employment action, the Court next
explained, it is "less obvious" that the agency relation is thedriving force.

Id., at 763. We acknowledged that a supervisor's "power and authority invests his or her harassing con-duct with a particular threatening character, and in this

sense, a supervisor always is aided by the agency relation."
Ibid. But we also recognized that "there are acts of harassment a supervisor might commit which might be the same
acts a coemployee would commit, and there may be some
circumstances where the supervisor's status [would] mak[e]
little difference." Ibid.

An "aided-by-the-agency-relation" standard, the Court
suggested, was insufficiently developed to press into service
as the standard governing cases in which no tangible employment action is in the picture. Looking elsewhere for
guidance, we focused on Title VII's design "to encourage the
creation of antiharassment policies and effective grievance
mechanisms." Id., at 764. The Court reasoned that tying
the liability standard to an employer's effort to install effective grievance procedures would advance Congress' purpose
"to promote conciliation rather than litigation" of Title VII
controversies. Ibid. At the same time, such linkage of liability limitation to effective preventive and corrective measures could serve Title VII's deterrent purpose by "encourag[ing] employees to report harassing conduct before it
becomes severe or pervasive." Ibid. Accordingly, we held
that when no tangible employment action is taken, the employer may defeat vicarious liability for supervisor harassment by establishing, as an affirmative defense, both that
"the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and cor542US1 Unit: $U62 [10-25-06 13:51:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

rect promptly any sexually harassing behavior," and that"the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities providedby the employer or to avoid harm otherwise." Id., at 765;
accord Faragher, 524 U. S., at 807.Ellerth and Faragher also clarified the parties' respective
proof burdens in hostile environment cases. Title VII, theCourt noted, "borrows from tort law the avoidable consequences doctrine," Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 764, under whichvictims have "a duty `to use such means as are reasonable
under the circumstances to avoid or minimize the damages'that result from violations of the statute,"

Faragher, 524U. S., at 806 (quoting Ford Motor Co. v. EEOC, 458 U. S. 219,

231, n. 15 (1982)). The Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defenseaccommodates that doctrine by requiring plaintiffs reasonably to stave off avoidable harm. But both decisions placethe burden squarely on the defendant to prove that the plaintiff unreasonably failed to avoid or reduce harm. Ellerth,524 U. S., at 765; accord

Faragher, 524 U. S., at 807; cf. C.McCormick, Law of Damages 130 (1935) (defendant has burden of persuading factfinder "plaintiff could reasonably havereduced his loss or avoided injurious consequences").

The constructive discharge here at issue stems from, andcan be regarded as an aggravated case of, sexual harassment

or hostile work environment. For an atmosphere of sexualharassment or hostility to be actionable, we reiterate, see

tim's employment and create an abusive working environment." Meritor, 477 U. S., at 67 (internal quotation marks
and brackets omitted). A hostile-environment constructive
discharge claim entails something more: A plaintiff who advances such a compound claim must show working conditions
so intolerable that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign. See, e. g., Breeding v. Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., 164 F. 3d 1151, 1160 (CA8 1999) ("[A]lthough
there may be evidence from which a jury could find sexual
harassment, . . . the facts alleged [for constructive discharge
must be] . . . so intolerable that a reasonable person would
be forced to quit."); Perry v. Harris Chernin, Inc., 126 F. 3d
1010, 1015 (CA7 1997) ("[U]nless conditions are beyond `ordinary' discrimination, a complaining employee is expected to
remain on the job while seeking redress.").8

Suders' claim is of the same genre as the hostile work environment claims the Court analyzed in Ellerth and Faragher.9
Essentially, Suders presents a "worse case" harassment sce8 As earlier noted, see supra, at 141, a prevailing constructive discharge
plaintiff is entitled to all damages available for formal discharge. The
plaintiff may recover postresignation damages, including both backpay
and, in fitting circumstances, frontpay, see 1 Lindemann & Grossman 838;
Weirich 651, as well as the compensatory and punitive damages now provided for Title VII claims generally, see 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a(a)(1); Pollard v.
E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 532 U. S. 843, 848 (2001) (noting expanded
remedies under Civil Rights Act of 1991).

9 Both the Ellerth and Faragher plaintiffs resigned from their posts;

plaintiff Ellerth expressly alleged constructive discharge. See Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742, 748-749 (1998); Faragher v.
Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775, 783 (1998). Although Ellerth's constructive
discharge claim was not before this Court, the decision's omission of constructive discharge from its examples of tangible employment actions is
conspicuous. See 524 U. S., at 761; Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the
United States as Amicus Curiae 10 ("[T]his Court's omission of constructive discharge in its discussion of tangible employment actions was widely
regarded as a purposeful one."). Tellingly, we stated that Ellerth "ha[d]
not alleged she suffered a tangible employment action," despite the fact
that her complaint alleged constructive discharge. 524 U. S., at 766.

148 PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE v. SUDERS

Opinion of the Court
nario, harassment ratcheted up to the breaking point. Likethe harassment considered in our pathmarking decisions,

harassment so intolerable as to cause a resignation may beeffected through co-worker conduct, unofficial supervisory
conduct, or official company acts. Unlike an actual termina-tion, which is

always effected through an official act of the
company, a constructive discharge need not be. A constructive discharge involves both an employee's decision to leaveand precipitating conduct: The former involves no official action; the latter, like a harassment claim without any con-structive discharge assertion, may or may not involve official
action. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24.

To be sure, a constructive discharge is functionally the
same as an actual termination in damages-enhancing respects. See supra, at 147, n. 8. As the Third Circuit observed, both "en[d] the employer-employee relationship,"
and both "inflic[t] . . . direct economic harm." 325 F. 3d, at
460 (internal quotation marks omitted). But when an official act does not underlie the constructive discharge, the Ellerth and Faragher analysis, we here hold, calls for extension
of the affirmative defense to the employer. As those leading
decisions indicate, official directions and declarations are the
acts most likely to be brought home to the employer, the
measures over which the employer can exercise greatest control. See Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 762. Absent "an official act
of the enterprise," ibid., as the last straw, the employer ordinarily would have no particular reason to suspect that a resignation is not the typical kind daily occurring in the work
force. And as Ellerth and Faragher further point out, an
official act reflected in company records--a demotion or a
reduction in compensation, for example--shows "beyond
question" that the supervisor has used his managerial or controlling position to the employee's disadvantage. See Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 760. Absent such an official act, the extent to which the supervisor's misconduct has been aided by
the agency relation, as we earlier recounted, see supra, at

Opinion of the Court
145, is less certain. That uncertainty, our precedent estab-lishes, see

supra, at 145-146, justifies affording the employer
the chance to establish, through the Ellerth/Faragher af-firmative defense, that it should not be held vicariously

liable.The Third Circuit drew the line differently. Under its formulation, the affirmative defense would be eliminated in all
hostile-environment constructive discharge cases, but re-tained, as

Ellerth and Faragher require, in "ordinary" hostile
work environment cases, i. e., cases involving no tangible em-ployment action. That placement of the line, anomalously,

would make the graver claim of hostile-environment constructive discharge easier to prove than its lesser included
component, hostile work environment. Moreover, the Third
Circuit's formulation, that court itself recognized, would
make matters complex, indeed, more than a little confusing
to jurors. Creation of a hostile work environment is a necessary predicate to a hostile-environment constructive discharge case. Juries would be so informed. Under the
Third Circuit's decision, a jury, presumably, would be cautioned to consider the affirmative-defense evidence only in
reaching a decision on the hostile work environment claim,
and to ignore or at least downplay that same evidence in
deciding the closely associated constructive discharge claim.
It makes scant sense thus to alter the decisive instructions
from one claim to the next when the only variation between
the two claims is the severity of the hostile working conditions. Cf. Faragher, 524 U. S., at 801 (affirming "the virtue
of categorical clarity").

We note, finally, two recent Court of Appeals decisions
that indicate how the "official act" (or "tangible employment
action") criterion should play out when constructive discharge is alleged. Both decisions advance the untangled approach we approve in this opinion. In Reed v. MBNA Marketing Systems, Inc., 333 F. 3d 27 (CA1 2003), the plaintiff
claimed a constructive discharge based on her supervisor's

542US1 Unit: $U62 [10-25-06 13:51:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
150 PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE v. SUDERS

Opinion of the Court
repeated sexual comments and an incident in which he sexu-ally assaulted her. The First Circuit held that the alleged

wrongdoing did not preclude the employer from assertingthe Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense. As the court explained in Reed, the supervisor's behavior involved no officialactions. Unlike, "e. g., an extremely dangerous job assignment to retaliate for spurned advances," 333 F. 3d, at 33, thesupervisor's conduct in

Reed "was exceedingly unofficial andinvolved no direct exercise of company authority"; indeed, it

was "exactly the kind of wholly unauthorized conduct forwhich the affirmative defense was designed," ibid. In contrast, in Robinson v. Sappington, 351 F. 3d 317 (CA7 2003),after the plaintiff complained that she was sexually harassed
by the judge for whom she worked, the presiding judge de-cided to transfer her to another judge, but told her that "her
first six months [in the new post] probably would be `hell,' "and that it was in her " `best interest to resign.' " Id., at
324. The Seventh Circuit held that the employer was pre-cluded from asserting the affirmative defense to the plaintiff 's constructive discharge claim. The Robinson plaintiff 'sdecision to resign, the court explained, "resulted, at least in
part, from [the presiding judge's] official actio[n] in transfer-ring" her to a judge who resisted placing her on his staff.
Id., at 337. The courts in Reed and Robinson properly rec-ognized that

Ellerth and Faragher, which divided the uni-verse of supervisor-harassment claims according to the presence or absence of an official act, mark the path constructivedischarge claims based on harassing conduct must follow.

2
In its summation, the Third Circuit qualified its holdingthat a constructive discharge itself "constitutes a tangible

employment action within the meaning of Ellerth andFaragher." 325 F. 3d, at 462. The affirmative defense Ellerth and Faragher delineated, the court said, might be im-ported into the anterior issue whether "the employee's deci542US1 Unit: $U62 [10-25-06 13:51:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
sion to resign was reasonable under the circumstances."
325 F. 3d, at 462.10 As the Third Circuit expressed its
thinking:

"[I]t may be relevant to a claim of constructive discharge whether an employer had an effective remedial
scheme in place, whether an employer attempted to investigate, or otherwise to address, plaintiff 's complaints,
and whether plaintiff took advantage of alternatives offered by antiharassment programs." Ibid.

These considerations, the Third Circuit recognized, "are, of
course, the same considerations relevant to the affirmative
defense in Ellerth and Faragher." Ibid.

The Third Circuit left open when and how the Ellerth/
Faragher considerations would be brought home to the fact
trier. It did not address specifically the allocation of pleading and persuasion burdens. It simply relied on "the wisdom and expertise of trial judges to exercise their gatekeeping authority when assessing whether all, some, or none of
the evidence relating to employers' antiharassment programs
and to employees' exploration of alternative avenues warrants introduction at trial." 325 F. 3d, at 463.

10 For similar expressions, see, e. g., Jaros v. LodgeNet Entertainment
Corp., 294 F. 3d 960, 965 (CA8 2002) (though not entitled to the Ellerth/
Faragher affirmative defense, employer facing constructive discharge
complaint may assert that plaintiff "did not give it a chance to respond to
her [grievance]" in rebutting plaintiff's contention that conditions were so
intolerable as to force her resignation); Marrero v. Goya of Puerto Rico,
Inc., 304 F. 3d 7, 28 (CA1 2002) ("the jury reasonably can take into account
how the employer responded to the plaintiff's complaints, if any," in deciding whether conditions were intolerable); Hartman v. Sterling, Inc.,

152 PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE v. SUDERS

Thomas, J., dissenting
We see no cause for leaving the district courts thus un-guided. Following Ellerth and Faragher, the plaintiff who

alleges no tangible employment action has the duty to miti-gate harm, but the defendant bears the burden to allege and
prove that the plaintiff failed in that regard. See supra, at146. The plaintiff might elect to allege facts relevant to mitigation in her pleading or to present those facts in her casein chief, but she would do so in anticipation of the employer's
affirmative defense, not as a legal requirement.

* * *
We agree with the Third Circuit that the case, in its cur-rent posture, presents genuine issues of material fact concerning Suders' hostile work environment and constructivedischarge claims.

11 We hold, however, that the Court of Appeals erred in declaring the affirmative defense described inEllerth and Faragher never available in constructive discharge cases. Accordingly, we vacate the Third Circuit'sjudgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Thomas, dissenting.
As the Court explains, the National Labor RelationsBoard (NLRB) developed the concept of constructive discharge to address situations in which employers coerced em-ployees into resigning because of the employees' involvement
in union activities. See ante, at 141-142. In light of thisspecific focus, the NLRB requires employees to establish two
elements to prove a constructive discharge. First, the em-ployer must impose burdens upon the employee that "cause,
and [are] intended to cause, a change in his working condi-tions so difficult or unpleasant as to force him to resign.

11 Although most of the discriminatory behavior Suders alleged involved
unofficial conduct, the events surrounding her computer-skills exams, see
supra, at 136, were less obviously unofficial.

Thomas, J., dissenting
Second, it must be shown that those burdens were imposedbecause of the employee's uni on activities. "

Crystal
Princeton Refining Co., 222 N. L. R. B. 1068, 1069 (1976).When the constructive discharge concept was first imported into Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, somecourts imposed similar requirements. See,

e. g., Muller v.
United States Steel Corp., 509 F. 2d 923, 929 (CA10 1975)
(requiring a showing that "an employer deliberately ren-der[ed] the employee's working conditions intolerable and

thus force[d] him to quit his job"). Moreover, because theCourt had not yet recognized the hostile work environment
cause of action, the first successful Title VII constructive
discharge claims typically involved adverse employment actions. See, Muller, supra (denial of job promotion); Derr v.
Gulf Oil Corp., 796 F. 2d 340, 344 (CA10 1986) (demotion).
If, in order to establish a constructive discharge, an employee must prove that his employer subjected him to an
adverse employment action with the specific intent of forcing
the employee to quit, it makes sense to attach the same legal
consequences to a constructive discharge as to an actual
discharge.

The Court has now adopted a definition of constructive
discharge, however, that does not in the least resemble actual discharge. The Court holds that to establish " `constructive discharge,' " a plaintiff must "show that the abusive
working environment became so intolerable that [the employee's] resignation qualified as a fitting response." Ante,
at 134. Under this rule, it is possible to allege a constructive discharge absent any adverse employment action.
Moreover, a majority of Courts of Appeals have declined to
impose a specific intent or reasonable foreseeability requirement. See, e. g., Brooks v. San Mateo, 229 F. 3d 917, 930
(CA9 2000) ("[C]onstructive discharge occurs when the
working conditions deteriorate, as a result of discrimination,
to the point that they become sufficiently extraordinary and
egregious to overcome the normal motivation of a competent,

diligent, and reasonable employee to remain on the job toearn a livelihood and to serve his or her employer" (internal

quotation marks omitted)).Thus, as it is currently conceived, a "constructive" discharge does not require a "company ac[t] that can be per-formed only by the exercise of specific authority granted by
the employer," Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524U. S. 742, 768 (1998) (

Thomas, J., dissenting) (i. e., an adverseemployment action), nor does it require that the act be undertaken with the same purpose as an actual discharge.Under these circumstances, it no longer makes sense to view
a constructive discharge as equivalent to an actual discharge.Instead, as the Court points out, a constructive discharge is
more akin to "an aggravated case of . . . sexual harassment orhostile work environment." Ante, at 146. And under this
"hostile work environment plus" framework, the properstandard for determining employer liability is the same
standard for hostile work environment claims that I articu-lated in

Burlington Industries, Inc., supra. "An employershould be liable if, and only if, the plaintiff proves that the

employer was negligent in permitting the supervisor's con-duct to occur." Id., at 767. If a supervisor takes an adverse employment action because of sex that directly resultsin the constructive discharge, the employer is vicariously liable. Id., at 768. But, where the alleged constructive dis-charge results only from a hostile work environment, an employer is liable if negligent. Ibid. Because respondent hasnot adduced sufficient evidence of an adverse employment
action taken because of her sex, nor has she proffered anyevidence that petitioner knew or should have known of the
alleged harassment, I would reverse the judgment of theCourt of Appeals.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuit

No. 03-724. Argued April 26, 2004--Decided June 14, 2004
The Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act of 1982 (FTAIA or Act)

provides that the Sherman Act "shall not apply to conduct involving
trade or commerce . . . with foreign nations," 15 U. S. C. $ 6a, but creates
exceptions for conduct that significantly harms imports, domestic commerce, or American exporters. In this case, vitamin purchasers filed a
class action alleging that vitamin manufacturers and distributors had
engaged in a price-fixing conspiracy, raising vitamin prices in the United
States and foreign countries, in violation of the Sherman Act. As relevant here, defendants (petitioners) moved to dismiss the suit as to the
foreign purchasers (respondents), foreign companies located abroad,
who had purchased vitamins only outside United States commerce. In
dismissing respondents' claims, the District Court applied the FTAIA
and found none of its exceptions applicable. The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the FTAIA's exclusionary rule applied, but so
did its exception for conduct that has a "direct, substantial and reasonably foreseeable effect" on domestic commerce that "gives rise to a
[Sherman Act] claim," $$ 6a(1)(A), (2). Assuming that the foreign effect, i. e., higher foreign prices, was independent of the domestic effect,
i. e., higher domestic prices, the court nonetheless concluded that the
Act's text, legislative history, and policy goal of deterring harmful
price-fixing activity made the lack of connection between the two effects inconsequential.

Held: Where the price-fixing conduct significantly and adversely affects

both customers outside and within the United States, but the adverse
foreign effect is independent of any adverse domestic effect, the FTAIA
exception does not apply, and thus, neither does the Sherman Act, to a
claim based solely on the foreign effect. Pp. 161-175.

(a) Respondents' threshold argument that the transactions fall outside the FTAIA because its general exclusionary rule applies only to
conduct involving exports is rejected. The House Judiciary Committee
changed the bill's original language from "export trade or export commerce," H. R. 5235, to "trade or commerce (other than import trade or
import commerce)" deliberately to include commerce that did not involve American exports but was wholly foreign. Pp. 162-163.

Syllabus
(b) The FTAIA exception does not apply here for two reasons. First,
this Court ordinarily construes ambiguous statutes to avoid unreasonable interference with other nations' sovereign authority. This rule of
construction reflects customary international law principles and cautions courts to assume that legislators take account of other nations'
legitimate sovereign interests when writing American laws. It thereby
helps the potentially conflicting laws of different nations work together
in harmony. While applying America's antitrust laws to foreign conduct can interfere with a foreign nation's ability to regulate its own
commercial affairs, courts have long held such application nonetheless
reasonable, and hence consistent with prescriptive comity principles, insofar as the laws reflect a legislative effort to redress domestic antitrust
injury caused by foreign anticompetitive conduct. However, it is not
reasonable to apply American laws to foreign conduct insofar as that
conduct causes independent foreign harm that alone gives rise to a
plaintiff's claim. The risk of interference is the same, but the justification for the interference seems insubstantial. While some of the anticompetitive conduct alleged here took place in America, the higher foreign prices are not the consequence of any domestic anticompetitive
conduct sought to be forbidden by Congress, which rather wanted to
release domestic (and foreign) anticompetitive conduct from Sherman
Act constraint when that conduct causes foreign harm. Contrary to
respondents' claim, the comity concerns remain real as other nations
have not in all areas adopted antitrust laws similar to this country's
and, in any event, disagree dramatically about appropriate remedies.
Respondents' alternative argument that case-by-case comity analysis is
preferable to an across the board exclusion of foreign injury cases is too
complex to prove workable. Second, the FTAIA's language and history
suggest that Congress designed the Act to clarify, perhaps to limit, but
not to expand, the Sherman Act's scope as applied to foreign commerce.
There is no significant indication that at the time Congress wrote the
FTAIA courts would have thought the Sherman Act applicable in these
circumstances, nor do the six cases on which respondents rely warrant
a different conclusion. Pp. 163-173.

(c) Respondents' additional linguistic arguments might show a natural
reading of the statute, but the comity and history considerations previously discussed make clear that respondents' reading is not consistent
with the FTAIA's basic intent. Their deterrence-based policy argument is also unavailing in light of the contrary arguments by the antitrust enforcement agencies. Pp. 173-175.

(d) On remand, the Court of Appeals may consider whether respondents properly preserved their alternative argument that the foreign

Opinion of the Court
Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act of 1982(FTAIA) excludes from the Sherman Act's reach much anticompetitive conduct that causes only foreign injury. It doesso by setting forth a general rule stating that the Sherman
Act "shall not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce. . . with foreign nations." 96 Stat. 1246, 15 U. S. C. $ 6a. It
then creates exceptions to the general rule, applicable where(roughly speaking) that conduct significantly harms imports,
domestic commerce, or American exporters.We here focus upon anticompetitive price-fixing activity
that is in significant part foreign, that causes some domesticantitrust injury, and that independently causes separate foreign injury. We ask two questions about the price-fixingconduct and the foreign injury that it causes. First, does
that conduct fall within the FTAIA's general rule excludingthe Sherman Act's application? That is to say, does the
price-fixing activity constitute "conduct involving trade orcommerce . . . with foreign nations"? We conclude that it
does.

Opinion of the Court
Second, we ask whether the conduct nonetheless falls
within a domestic-injury exception to the general rule, an
exception that applies (and makes the Sherman Act nonetheless applicable) where the conduct (1) has a "direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect" on domestic commerce, and (2) "such effect gives rise to a [Sherman Act]
claim." $$ 6a(1)(A), (2). We conclude that the exception
does not apply where the plaintiff 's claim rests solely on the
independent foreign harm.

To clarify: The issue before us concerns (1) significant foreign anticompetitive conduct with (2) an adverse domestic
effect and (3) an independent foreign effect giving rise to the
claim. In more concrete terms, this case involves vitamin
sellers around the world that agreed to fix prices, leading to
higher vitamin prices in the United States and independently leading to higher vitamin prices in other countries such
as Ecuador. We conclude that, in this scenario, a purchaser
in the United States could bring a Sherman Act claim under
the FTAIA based on domestic injury, but a purchaser in Ecuador could not bring a Sherman Act claim based on foreign harm.

I

The plaintiffs in this case originally filed a class-action suit
on behalf of foreign and domestic purchasers of vitamins
under, inter alia, $ 1 of the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, as
amended, 15 U. S. C. $ 1, and $$ 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act,
38 Stat. 731, 737, as amended, 15 U. S. C. $$ 15, 26. Their
complaint alleged that petitioners, foreign and domestic vitamin manufacturers and distributors, had engaged in a pricefixing conspiracy, raising the price of vitamin products to
customers in the United States and to customers in foreign
countries.

As relevant here, petitioners moved to dismiss the suit as

to another pending suit and did not take part in the subsequent appeal. 315 F. 3d 338, 343 (CADC 2003).

A divided panel of the Court of Appeals reversed. 315
F. 3d 338. The panel concluded that the FTAIA's general
exclusionary rule applied to the case, but that its domesticinjury exception also applied. It basically read the plaintiffs' complaint to allege that the vitamin manufacturers'
price-fixing conspiracy (1) had "a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect" on ordinary domestic trade or
commerce, i. e., the conspiracy brought about higher domestic vitamin prices, and (2) "such effect" gave "rise to a [Sherman Act] claim," i. e., an injured domestic customer could
have brought a Sherman Act suit, 15 U. S. C. $$ 6a(1), (2).
Those allegations, the court held, are sufficient to meet the
exception's requirements. 315 F. 3d, at 341.

The court assumed that the foreign effect, i. e., higher
prices in Ukraine, Panama, Australia, and Ecuador, was independent of the domestic effect, i. e., higher domestic prices.
Ibid. But it concluded that, in light of the FTAIA's text,
legislative history, and the policy goal of deterring harmful
price-fixing activity, this lack of connection does not matter.

II

The FTAIA seeks to make clear to American exporters
(and to firms doing business abroad) that the Sherman Act
does not prevent them from entering into business arrangements (say, joint-selling arrangements), however anticompetitive, as long as those arrangements adversely affect only
foreign markets. See H. R. Rep. No. 97-686, pp. 1-3, 9-10
(1982) (hereinafter House Report). It does so by removing
from the Sherman Act's reach, (1) export activities and
(2) other commercial activities taking place abroad, unless
those activities adversely affect domestic commerce, imports
to the United States, or exporting activities of one engaged
in such activities within the United States.

The FTAIA says:

"Sections 1 to 7 of this title [the Sherman Act] shall
not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce (other
than import trade or import commerce) with foreign nations unless--

"(1) such conduct has a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect--

"(A) on trade or commerce which is not trade or
commerce with foreign nations [i. e., domestic trade or
commerce], or on import trade or import commerce with
foreign nations; or

"(B) on export trade or export commerce with foreign
nations, of a person engaged in such trade or commerce
in the United States [i. e., on an American export competitor]; and

162 F. HOFFMANN-La ROCHE LTD v. EMPAGRAN S. A.

Opinion of the Court
"(2) such effect gives rise to a claim under the pro-visions of sections 1 to 7 of this title, other than this

section.
"If sections 1 to 7 of this title apply to such conductonly because of the operation of paragraph (1)(B), then

sections 1 to 7 of this title shall apply to such conductonly for injury to export business in the United States."
15 U. S. C. $ 6a.
This technical language initially lays down a general ruleplacing all (nonimport) activity involving foreign commerce

outside the Sherman Act's reach. It then brings such con-duct back within the Sherman Act's reach provided that the
conduct both (1) sufficiently affects American commerce, i. e.,it has a "direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect" on American domestic, import, or (certain) export com-merce,

and (2) has an effect of a kind that antitrust lawconsiders harmful, i. e., the "effect" must "giv[e] rise to a

[Sherman Act] claim." $$ 6a(1), (2).We ask here how this language applies to price-fixing activity that is in significant part foreign, that has the requisitedomestic effect, and that also has independent foreign effects
giving rise to the plaintiff 's claim.

III
Respondents make a threshold argument. They say thatthe transactions here at issue fall outside the FTAIA because

the FTAIA's general exclusionary rule applies only to con-duct involving exports. The rule says that the Sherman Act
"shall not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce(other than import trade or import commerce) with foreign
nations." $ 6a (emphasis added). The word "with" meansbetween the United States and foreign nations. And, they
contend, commerce between the United States and foreignnations that is not import commerce must consist of export
commerce--a kind of commerce irrelevant to the case athand.

163Cite as: 542 U. S. 155 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
The difficulty with respondents' argument is that theFTAIA originated in a bill that initially referred only to "export trade or export commerce." H. R. 5235, 97th Cong.,1st Sess., $ 1 (1981). But the House Judiciary Committee
subsequently changed that language to "trade or commerce(other than import trade or import commerce)." 15 U. S. C.

$ 6a. And it did so deliberately to include commerce that didnot involve American exports but which was wholly foreign.

The House Report says in relevant part:

"The Subcommittee's `export' commerce limitation ap-peared to make the amendments inapplicable to transactions that were neither import nor export, i. e., transac-tions within, between, or among other nations. . . .
Such foreign transactions should, for the purposes ofthis legislation, be treated in the same manner as export transactions--that is, there should be no Americanantitrust jurisdiction absent a direct, substantial and
reasonably foreseeable effect on domestic commerce ora domestic competitor. The Committee amendment
therefore deletes references to `export' trade, and sub-stitutes phrases such as `other than import' trade. It is
thus clear that wholly foreign transactions as well asexport transactions are covered by the amendment, but
that import transactions are not." House Report, at9-10 (emphases added).

For those who find legislative history useful, the HouseReport's account should end the matter. Others, by considering carefully the amendment itself and the lack of anyother plausible purpose, may reach the same conclusion,
namely, that the FTAIA's general rule applies where the an-ticompetitive conduct at issue is foreign.

IV
We turn now to the basic question presented, that of theexception's application. Because the underlying antitrust

Opinion of the Court
action is complex, potentially raising questions not directlyat issue here, we reemphasize that we base our decision upon

the following: The price-fixing conduct significantly and ad-versely affects both customers outside the United States and
customers within the United States, but the adverse foreigneffect is independent of any adverse domestic effect. In
these circumstances, we find that the FTAIA exception does
not apply (and thus the Sherman Act does not apply) for twomain reasons.

First, this Court ordinarily construes ambiguous statutesto avoid unreasonable interference with the sovereign authority of other nations. See, e. g., McCulloch v. Sociedad
Nacional de Marineros de Honduras, 372 U. S. 10, 20-22
(1963) (application of National Labor Relations Act to
foreign-flag vessels); Romero v. International Terminal Operating Co., 358 U. S. 354, 382-383 (1959) (application of
Jones Act in maritime case); Lauritzen v. Larsen, 345 U. S.
571, 578 (1953) (same). This rule of construction reflects
principles of customary international law--law that (we must
assume) Congress ordinarily seeks to follow. See Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States

$$ 403(1), 403(2) (1986) (hereinafter Restatement) (limiting
the unreasonable exercise of prescriptive jurisdiction with
respect to a person or activity having connections with another State); Murray v. Schooner Charming Betsy, 2 Cranch
64, 118 (1804) ("[A]n act of congress ought never to be construed to violate the law of nations if any other possible
construction remains"); Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California,
509 U. S. 764, 817 (1993) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (identifying
rule of construction as derived from the principle of " `prescriptive comity' ").

This rule of statutory construction cautions courts to assume that legislators take account of the legitimate sovereign interests of other nations when they write American
laws. It thereby helps the potentially conflicting laws of different nations work together in harmony--a harmony partic542US1 Unit: $U63 [04-25-05 19:18:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ularly needed in today's highly interdependent commercialworld.

No one denies that America's antitrust laws, when appliedto foreign conduct, can interfere with a foreign nation's ability independently to regulate its own commercial affairs.But our courts have long held that application of our antitrust laws to foreign anticompetitive conduct is nonetheless
reasonable, and hence consistent with principles of prescrip-tive comity, insofar as they reflect a legislative effort to redress domestic antitrust injury that foreign anticompetitiveconduct has caused. See

United States v. Aluminum Co. of
America, 148 F. 2d 416, 443-444 (CA2 1945) (L. Hand, J.); 1
P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law || 236 (1978).

But why is it reasonable to apply those laws to foreign
conduct insofar as that conduct causes independent foreign
harm and that foreign harm alone gives rise to the plaintiff 's claim? Like the former case, application of those laws
creates a serious risk of interference with a foreign nation's
ability independently to regulate its own commercial affairs.
But, unlike the former case, the justification for that interference seems insubstantial. See Restatement $ 403(2) (determining reasonableness on basis of such factors as connections
with regulating nation, harm to that nation's interests, extent to which other nations regulate, and the potential for
conflict). Why should American law supplant, for example,
Canada's or Great Britain's or Japan's own determination
about how best to protect Canadian or British or Japanese
customers from anticompetitive conduct engaged in significant part by Canadian or British or Japanese or other foreign companies?

We recognize that principles of comity provide Congress
greater leeway when it seeks to control through legislation
the actions of American companies, see Restatement $ 402;
and some of the anticompetitive price-fixing conduct alleged
here took place in America. But the higher foreign prices
of which the foreign plaintiffs here complain are not the con542US1 Unit: $U63 [04-25-05 19:18:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
sequence of any domestic anticompetitive conduct that Congress sought to forbid, for Congress did not seek to forbid
any such conduct insofar as it is here relevant, i. e., insofar
as it is intertwined with foreign conduct that causes independent foreign harm. Rather Congress sought to release
domestic (and foreign) anticompetitive conduct from Sherman Act constraints when that conduct causes foreign harm.
Congress, of course, did make an exception where that conduct also causes domestic harm. See House Report, at 13
(concerns about American firms' participation in international cartels addressed through "domestic injury" exception). But any independent domestic harm the foreign conduct causes here has, by definition, little or nothing to do
with the matter.

We thus repeat the basic question: Why is it reasonable to
apply this law to conduct that is significantly foreign insofar
as that conduct causes independent foreign harm and that
foreign harm alone gives rise to the plaintiff 's claim? We
can find no good answer to the question.

The Areeda and Hovenkamp treatise notes that under the
Court of Appeals' interpretation of the statute

"a Malaysian customer could . . . maintain an action
under United States law in a United States court against
its own Malaysian supplier, another cartel member, simply by noting that unnamed third parties injured [in the
United States] by the American [cartel member's] conduct would also have a cause of action. Effectively, the
United States courts would provide worldwide subject
matter jurisdiction to any foreign suitor wishing to sue
its own local supplier, but unhappy with its own sovereign's provisions for private antitrust enforcement, provided that a different plaintiff had a cause of action
against a different firm for injuries that were within
U. S. [other-than-import] commerce. It does not seem
excessively rigid to infer that Congress would not have

Opinion of the Court
intended that result." P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, An-titrust Law || 273, pp. 51-52 (Supp. 2003).

We agree with the comment. We can find no convincing jus-tification for the extension of the Sherman Act's scope that
it describes.Respondents reply that many nations have adopted antitrust laws similar to our own, to the point where the practi-cal likelihood of interference with the relevant interests of
other nations is minimal. Leaving price fixing to the side,however, this Court has found to the contrary. See, e. g.,
Hartford Fire, 509 U. S., at 797-799 (noting that the allegedconduct in the London reinsurance market, while illegal
under United States antitrust laws, was assumed to be per-fectly consistent with British law and policy); see also,

e. g.,2 W. Fugate, Foreign Commerce and the Antitrust Laws

$ 16.6 (5th ed. 1996) (noting differences between EuropeanUnion and United States law on vertical restraints).

Regardless, even where nations agree about primary con-duct, say, price fixing, they disagree dramatically about appropriate remedies. The application, for example, of Amer-ican private treble-damages remedies to anticompetitive
conduct taking place abroad has generated considerable con-troversy. See, e. g., 2 ABA Section of Antitrust Law, Antitrust Law Developments 1208-1209 (5th ed. 2002). And sev-eral foreign nations have filed briefs here arguing that to
apply our remedies would unjustifiably permit their citizensto bypass their own less generous remedial schemes, thereby
upsetting a balance of competing considerations that theirown domestic antitrust laws embody.

E. g., Brief for Gov-ernment of Federal Republic of Germany et al. as Amici Curiae 2 (setting forth German interest "in seeing that Germancompanies are not subject to the extraterritorial reach of the
United States' antitrust laws by private foreign plaintiffs--whose injuries were sustained in transactions entirely outside United States commerce--seeking treble damages inprivate lawsuits against German companies"); Brief for Gov542US1 Unit: $U63 [04-25-05 19:18:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ernment of Canada as Amicus Curiae 14 ("treble damagesremedy would supersede" Canada's "national policy decision"); Brief for Government of Japan as Amicus Curiae 10(finding "particularly troublesome" the potential "interfere[nce] with Japanese governmental regulation of the Japa-nese market").

These briefs add that a decision permitting independently
injured foreign plaintiffs to pursue private treble-damagesremedies would undermine foreign nations' own antitrust enforcement policies by diminishing foreign firms' incentive tocooperate with antitrust authorities in return for prosecutorial amnesty. Brief for Government of Federal Republic of
Germany et al. as Amici Curiae 28-30; Brief for Government of Canada as Amicus Curiae 11-14. See also Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 19-21 (arguing the same in
respect to American antitrust enforcement).

Respondents alternatively argue that comity does not demand an interpretation of the FTAIA that would exclude
independent foreign injury cases across the board. Rather,
courts can take (and sometimes have taken) account of comity considerations case by case, abstaining where comity considerations so dictate. Cf., e. g., Hartford Fire, supra, at
797, n. 24; United States v. Nippon Paper Industries Co., 109
F. 3d 1, 8 (CA1 1997); Mannington Mills, Inc. v. Congoleum
Corp., 595 F. 2d 1287, 1294-1295 (CA3 1979).

In our view, however, this approach is too complex to
prove workable. The Sherman Act covers many different
kinds of anticompetitive agreements. Courts would have to
examine how foreign law, compared with American law,
treats not only price fixing but also, say, information-sharing
agreements, patent-licensing price conditions, territorial
product resale limitations, and various forms of joint venture, in respect to both primary conduct and remedy. The
legally and economically technical nature of that enterprise
means lengthier proceedings, appeals, and more proceedings--to the point where procedural costs and delays could

Opinion of the Court
themselves threaten interference with a foreign nation'sability to maintain the integrity of its own antitrust enforcement system. Even in this relatively simple price-fixingcase, for example, competing briefs tell us (1) that potential
treble-damages liability would help enforce widespread anti-price-fixing norms (through added deterrence) and (2) the
opposite, namely, that such liability would hinder antitrust
enforcement (by reducing incentives to enter amnesty pro-grams). Compare,

e. g., Brief for Certain Professors of Economics as Amici Curiae 2-4 with Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 19-21. How could a court seriously interested in resolving so empirical a matter--a matter potentially related to impact on foreign interests--do so simply
and expeditiously?

We conclude that principles of prescriptive comity counsel
against the Court of Appeals' interpretation of the FTAIA.
Where foreign anticompetitive conduct plays a significant
role and where foreign injury is independent of domestic effects, Congress might have hoped that America's antitrust
laws, so fundamental a component of our own economic system, would commend themselves to other nations as well.
But, if America's antitrust policies could not win their own
way in the international marketplace for such ideas, Congress, we must assume, would not have tried to impose them,
in an act of legal imperialism, through legislative fiat.

Second, the FTAIA's language and history suggest that
Congress designed the FTAIA to clarify, perhaps to limit,
but not to expand in any significant way, the Sherman Act's
scope as applied to foreign commerce. See House Report,
at 2-3. And we have found no significant indication that at
the time Congress wrote this statute courts would have
thought the Sherman Act applicable in these circumstances.

The Solicitor General and petitioners tell us that they have
found no case in which any court applied the Sherman Act
to redress foreign injury in such circumstances. Tr. of Oral

a case like this--where a foreign plaintiff is injured in a for-eign market with no injuries arising from the anticompetitive effect on a United States market"). And respondentsthemselves apparently conceded as much at a May 23, 2001,
hearing before the District Court below. 2001 WL 761360,
at *4.Nevertheless, respondents now have called to our attention six cases, three decided by this Court and three decidedby lower courts. In the first three cases the defendants
included both American companies and foreign companies
jointly engaged in anticompetitive behavior having both foreign and domestic effects. See Timken Roller Bearing Co.
v. United States, 341 U. S. 593, 595 (1951) (agreements among
American, British, and French corporations to eliminate
competition in the manufacture and sale of antifriction bearings in world, including United States, markets); United
States v. National Lead Co., 332 U. S. 319, 325-328 (1947)
(international cartels with American and foreign members,
restraining international commerce, including United States
commerce, in titanium pigments); United States v. American
Tobacco Co., 221 U. S. 106, 171-172 (1911) (American tobacco
corporations agreed in England with British company to divide world markets). In all three cases the plaintiff sought
relief, including relief that might have helped to protect
those injured abroad.

In all three cases, however, the plaintiff was the Government of the United States. A Government plaintiff, unlike
a private plaintiff, must seek to obtain the relief necessary
to protect the public from further anticompetitive conduct
and to redress anticompetitive harm. And a Government
plaintiff has legal authority broad enough to allow it to carry
out this mission. 15 U. S. C. $ 25; see also, e. g., United
States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 366 U. S. 316, 334
(1961) ("[I]t is well settled that once the Government has

Opinion of the Court
successfully borne the considerable burden of establishing aviolation of law, all doubts as to the remedy are to be resolved in its favor"). Private plaintiffs, by way of contrast,are far less likely to be able to secure broad relief. See

California v. American Stores Co., 495 U. S. 271, 295 (1990) ("Ourconclusion that a district court has the power to order divestiture in appropriate cases brought [by private plaintiffs] does
not, of course, mean that such power should be exercised inevery situation in which the Government would be entitled

to such relief "); 2 P. Areeda, H. Hovenkamp, & R. Blair, Anti-trust Law |||| 303d-303e, pp. 40-45 (2d ed. 2000) (distinguishing between private and government suits in terms of availability, public interest motives, and remedial scope); Griffin,
Extraterritoriality in U. S. and EU Antitrust Enforcement,
67 Antitrust L. J. 159, 194 (1999) ("[P]rivate plaintiffs often
are unwilling to exercise the degree of self-restraint and consideration of foreign governmental sensibilities generally exercised by the U. S. Government"). This difference means
that the Government's ability, in these three cases, to obtain
relief helpful to those injured abroad tells us little or nothing
about whether this Court would have awarded similar relief
at the request of private plaintiffs.

Neither did the Court focus explicitly in its opinions on a
claim that the remedies sought to cure only independently
caused foreign harm. Thus the three cases tell us even less
about whether this Court then thought that foreign private
plaintiffs could have obtained foreign relief based solely upon
such independently caused foreign injury.

Respondents also refer to three lower court cases brought
by private plaintiffs. In the first, Industria Siciliana Asfalti, Bitumi, S. p. A. v. Exxon Research & Engineering Co.,
No. 75 Civ. 5828-CSH, 1977 WL 1353 (SDNY, Jan. 18, 1977),
a District Court permitted an Italian firm to proceed against
an American firm with a Sherman Act claim based upon a
purely foreign injury, i. e., an injury suffered in Italy. The
court made clear, however, that the foreign injury was "inex542US1 Unit: $U63 [04-25-05 19:18:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tricably bound up with . . . domestic restraints of trade,"and that the plaintiff

"was injured . . . by reason of an alleged restraint of our domestic trade," id., at *11, *12 (em-phasis added),

i. e., the foreign injury was dependent upon,
not independent of, domestic harm. See Part VI, infra.In the second case,

Dominicus Americana Bohio v.
Gulf & Western Industries, Inc., 473 F. Supp. 680 (SDNY
1979), a District Court permitted Dominican and Americanfirms to proceed against a competing American firm and the

Dominican Tourist Information Center with a Sherman Actclaim based upon injury apparently suffered in the Dominican Republic. The court, in finding the Sherman Act applicable, weighed several different factors, including the participation of American firms in the unlawful conduct, the partly
domestic nature of both conduct and harm (to American tourists, a kind of "export"), and the fact that the domestic harm
depended in part upon the foreign injury. Id., at 688. The
court did not separately analyze the legal problem before it
in terms of independently caused foreign injury. Its opinion
simply does not discuss the matter. It consequently cannot
be taken as significant support for application of the Sherman Act here.

The third case, Hunt v. Mobil Oil Corp., 550 F. 2d 68, 72
(CA2 1977), involved a claim by Hunt, an independent oil
producer with reserves in Libya, that other major oil producers in Libya and the Persian Gulf (the "seven majors") had
conspired in New York and elsewhere to make it more difficult for Hunt to reach agreement with the Libyan Government on production terms and thereby eliminate him as a
competitor. The case can be seen as involving a primarily
foreign conspiracy designed to bring about foreign injury in
Libya. But, as in Dominicus, the court nowhere considered
the problem of independently caused foreign harm. Rather,
the case was about the "act of state" doctrine, and the sole
discussion of Sherman Act applicability--one brief paragraph--refers to other matters. 550 F. 2d, at 72, and n. 2.

173Cite as: 542 U. S. 155 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
We do not see how Congress could have taken this case assignificant support for the proposition that the Sherman Act

applies in present circumstances.The upshot is that no pre-1982 case provides significant
authority for application of the Sherman Act in the circum-stances we here assume. Indeed, a leading contemporaneous lower court case contains language suggesting the con-trary. See

Timberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of America,N. T. & S. A., 549 F. 2d 597, 613 (CA9 1976) (insisting that

the foreign conduct's domestic effect be "sufficiently largeto present a cognizable injury to the plaintiffs" (emphasis
added)).Taken together, these two sets of considerations, the one
derived from comity and the other reflecting history, con-vince us that Congress would not have intended the FTAIA's
exception to bring independently caused foreign injurywithin the Sherman Act's reach.

V
Respondents point to several considerations that point theother way. For one thing, the FTAIA's language speaks in

terms of the Sherman Act's applicability to certain kinds ofconduct. The FTAIA says that the Sherman Act applies to
foreign "conduct" with a certain kind of harmful domesticeffect. Why isn't that the end of the matter? How can the
Sherman Act both apply to the conduct when one personsues but

not apply to the same conduct when another personsues? The question of who can or cannot sue is a matter for

other statutes (namely, the Clayton Act) to determine.Moreover, the exception says that it applies if the conduct's domestic effect gives rise to "a claim," not to "theplaintiff 's claim" or "the claim at issue." 15 U. S. C. $ 6a(2)
(emphases added). The alleged conduct here did have do-mestic effects, and those effects were harmful enough to give
rise to "a" claim. Respondents concede that this claim isnot their own claim; it is someone else's claim. But, linguis542US1 Unit: $U63 [04-25-05 19:18:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN
174 F. HOFFMANN-La ROCHE LTD v. EMPAGRAN S. A.

Opinion of the Court
tically speaking, they say, that is beside the point. Nor didCongress place the relevant words "gives rise to a claim" in

the FTAIA to suggest any geographical limitation; rather itdid so for a here neutral reason, namely, in order to make
clear that the domestic effect must be an adverse (as opposedto a beneficial) effect. See House Report, at 11 (citing

National Bank of Canada v. Interbank Card Assn., 666 F. 2d
6, 8 (CA2 1981)).Despite their linguistic logic, these arguments are not convincing. Linguistically speaking, a statute can apply andnot apply to the same conduct, depending upon other circumstances; and those other circumstances may include the nature of the lawsuit (or of the related underlying harm). It
also makes linguistic sense to read the words "a claim" as if
they refer to the "plaintiff 's claim" or "the claim at issue."

At most, respondents' linguistic arguments might show
that respondents' reading is the more natural reading of the
statutory language. But those arguments do not show that
we must accept that reading. And that is the critical point.
The considerations previously mentioned--those of comity
and history--make clear that the respondents' reading is not
consistent with the FTAIA's basic intent. If the statute's
language reasonably permits an interpretation consistent
with that intent, we should adopt it. And, for the reasons
stated, we believe that the statute's language permits the
reading that we give it.

Finally, respondents point to policy considerations, namely,
that application of the Sherman Act in present circumstances
will (through increased deterrence) help protect Americans
against foreign-caused anticompetitive injury. Petitioners
and supporting enforcement-agency amici, however, have
made important experience-backed arguments (based upon
amnesty-seeking incentives) to the contrary. We cannot say
whether, on balance, respondents' side of this empirically

clear enough, nor of such likely empirical significance, that itcould overcome the considerations we have previously discussed and change our conclusion.For these reasons, we conclude that petitioners' reading of
the statute's language is correct. That reading furthers thestatute's basic purposes, it properly reflects considerations
of comity, and it is consistent with Sherman Act history.

We have assumed that the anticompetitive conduct hereindependently caused foreign injury; that is, the conduct's

domestic effects did not help to bring about that foreign in-jury. Respondents argue, in the alternative, that the foreign injury was not independent. Rather, they say, the anti-competitive conduct's domestic effects were linked to that
foreign harm. Respondents contend that, because vitaminsare fungible and readily transportable, without an adverse
domestic effect (i. e., higher prices in the United States), thesellers could not have maintained their international pricefixing arrangement and respondents would not have sufferedtheir foreign injury. They add that this "but for" condition
is sufficient to bring the price-fixing conduct within the scopeof the FTAIA's exception.

The Court of Appeals, however, did not address this argu-ment, 315 F. 3d, at 341, and, for that reason, neither shall we.
Respondents remain free to ask the Court of Appeals toconsider the claim. The Court of Appeals may determine
whether respondents properly preserved the argument, and,if so, it may consider it and decide the related claim.

For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appealsis vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

HIIBEL v. SIXTH JUDICIAL DISTRICT COURT OFNEVADA, HUMBOLDT COUNTY,

et al.

certiorari to the supreme court of nevada
No. 03-5554. Argued March 22, 2004--Decided June 21, 2004
Petitioner Hiibel was arrested and convicted in a Nevada court for refusing to identify himself to a police officer during an investigative stop
involving a reported assault. Nevada's "stop and identify" statute requires a person detained by an officer under suspicious circumstances
to identify himself. The state intermediate appellate court affirmed,
rejecting Hiibel's argument that the state law's application to his case
violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. The Nevada Supreme
Court affirmed.

Held: Petitioner's conviction does not violate his Fourth Amendment

rights or the Fifth Amendment's prohibition on self-incrimination.
Pp. 182-191.

(a) State stop and identify statutes often combine elements of traditional vagrancy laws with provisions intended to regulate police behavior in the course of investigatory stops. They vary from State to State,
but all permit an officer to ask or require a suspect to disclose his identity. In Papachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U. S. 156, 167-171, this Court
invalidated a traditional vagrancy law for vagueness because of its broad
scope and imprecise terms. The Court recognized similar constitutional limitations in Brown v. Texas, 443 U. S. 47, 52, where it invalidated a conviction for violating a Texas stop and identify statute on
Fourth Amendment grounds, and in Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352,
where it invalidated on vagueness grounds California's modified stop
and identify statute that required a suspect to give an officer "credible
and reliable" identification when asked to identify himself, id., at 360.
This case begins where those cases left off. Here, the initial stop was
based on reasonable suspicion, satisfying the Fourth Amendment requirements noted in Brown. Further, Hiibel has not alleged that the
Nevada statute is unconstitutionally vague, as in Kolender. This statute is narrower and more precise. In contrast to the "credible and reliable" identification requirement in Kolender, the Nevada Supreme
Court has interpreted the instant statute to require only that a suspect
disclose his name. It apparently does not require him to produce a
driver's license or any other document. If he chooses either to state
his name or communicate it to the officer by other means, the statute is
satisfied and no violation occurs. Pp. 182-185.

Syllabus

(b) The officer's conduct did not violate Hiibel's Fourth Amendment
rights. Ordinarily, an investigating officer is free to ask a person for
identification without implicating the Amendment. INS v. Delgado, 466
U. S. 210, 216. Beginning with Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, the Court has
recognized that an officer's reasonable suspicion that a person may be
involved in criminal activity permits the officer to stop the person for a
brief time and take additional steps to investigate further. Although it
is well established that an officer may ask a suspect to identify himself
during a Terry stop, see, e. g., United States v. Hensley, 469 U. S. 221,
229, it has been an open question whether the suspect can be arrested
and prosecuted for refusal to answer, see Brown, supra, at 53, n. 3.
The Court is now of the view that Terry principles permit a State to
require a suspect to disclose his name in the course of a Terry stop.
Terry, supra, at 34. The Nevada statute is consistent with Fourth
Amendment prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures because it properly balances the intrusion on the individual's interests
against the promotion of legitimate government interests. See Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S. 648, 654. An identity request has an immediate relation to the Terry stop's purpose, rationale, and practical demands, and the threat of criminal sanction helps ensure that the request
does not become a legal nullity. On the other hand, the statute does
not alter the nature of the stop itself, changing neither its duration nor
its location. Hiibel argues unpersuasively that the statute circumvents
the probable-cause requirement by allowing an officer to arrest a person
for being suspicious, thereby creating an impermissible risk of arbitrary
police conduct. These familiar concerns underlay Kolender, Brown,
and Papachristou. They are met by the requirement that a Terry stop
be justified at its inception and be "reasonably related in scope to the
circumstances which justified" the initial stop. Terry, supra, at 20.
Under those principles, an officer may not arrest a suspect for failure to
identify himself if the identification request is not reasonably related to
the circumstances justifying the stop. Cf. Hayes v. Florida, 470 U. S.
811, 817. The request in this case was a commonsense inquiry, not an
effort to obtain an arrest for failure to identify after a Terry stop yielded
insufficient evidence. The stop, the request, and the State's requirement of a response did not contravene the Fourth Amendment.
Pp. 185-189.

(c) Hiibel's contention that his conviction violates the Fifth Amendment's prohibition on self-incrimination fails because disclosure of his
name and identity presented no reasonable danger of incrimination.
The Fifth Amendment prohibits only compelled testimony that is incriminating, see Brown v. Walker, 161 U. S. 591, 598, and protects only

Syllabus
against disclosures that the witness reasonably believes could be used
in a criminal prosecution or could lead to other evidence that might be
so used, Kastigar v. United States, 406 U. S. 441, 445. Hiibel's refusal
to disclose was not based on any articulated real and appreciable fear
that his name would be used to incriminate him, or that it would furnish
evidence needed to prosecute him. Hoffman v. United States, 341 U. S.
479, 486. It appears he refused to identify himself only because he
thought his name was none of the officer's business. While the Court
recognizes his strong belief that he should not have to disclose his identity, the Fifth Amendment does not override the Nevada Legislature's
judgment to the contrary absent a reasonable belief that the disclosure
would tend to incriminate him. Answering a request to disclose a name
is likely to be so insignificant as to be incriminating only in unusual
circumstances. See, e. g., Baltimore City Dept. of Social Servs. v.
Bouknight, 493 U. S. 549, 555. If a case arises where there is a substantial allegation that furnishing identity at the time of a stop would have
given the police a link in the chain of evidence needed to convict the
individual of a separate offense, the court can then consider whether the
Fifth Amendment privilege applies, whether it has been violated, and
what remedy must follow. Those questions need not be resolved here.

intoxicated. The officer asked him if he had "any identifica-tion on [him]," which we understand as a request to produce

a driver's license or some other form of written identifica-tion. The man refused and asked why the officer wanted to
see identification. The officer responded that he was con-ducting an investigation and needed to see some identification. The unidentified man became agitated and insisted hehad done nothing wrong. The officer explained that he
wanted to find out who the man was and what he was doingthere. After continued refusals to comply with the officer's
request for identification, the man began to taunt the officerby placing his hands behind his back and telling the officer
to arrest him and take him to jail. This routine kept up forseveral minutes: The officer asked for identification 11 times
and was refused each time. After warning the man that hewould be arrested if he continued to refuse to comply, the
officer placed him under arrest.We now know that the man arrested on Grass Valley Road
is Larry Dudley Hiibel. Hiibel was charged with "willfullyresist[ing], delay[ing] or obstruct[ing] a public officer in discharging or attempting to discharge any legal duty of hisoffice" in violation of Nev. Rev. Stat. (NRS) $ 199.280 (2003).
The government reasoned that Hiibel had obstructed the of-ficer in carrying out his duties under $ 171.123, a Nevada
statute that defines the legal rights and duties of a policeofficer in the context of an investigative stop. Section
171.123 provides in relevant part:

"1. Any peace officer may detain any person whom theofficer encounters under circumstances which reasonably indicate that the person has committed, is commit-ting or is about to commit a crime.

. . . . .
"3. The officer may detain the person pursuant to thissection only to ascertain his identity and the suspicious

circumstances surrounding his presence abroad. Anyperson so detained shall identify himself, but may not

Hiibel was tried in the Justice Court of Union Township.The court agreed that Hiibel's refusal to identify himself as
required by $ 171.123 "obstructed and delayed Dove as apublic officer in attempting to discharge his duty" in violation of $ 199.280. App. 5. Hiibel was convicted and fined$250. The Sixth Judicial District Court affirmed, rejecting

ploring the Fourth and Fifth Amendment Issues, 69 IowaL. Rev. 1057 (1984).

Stop and identify statutes often combine elements of tradi-tional vagrancy laws with provisions intended to regulate
police behavior in the course of investigatory stops. Thestatutes vary from State to State, but all permit an officer
to ask or require a suspect to disclose his identity. A few
States model their statutes on the Uniform Arrest Act, amodel code that permits an officer to stop a person reasonably suspected of committing a crime and "demand of himhis name, address, business abroad and whither he is going."
Warner, The Uniform Arrest Act, 28 Va. L. Rev. 315, 344
(1942). Other statutes are based on the text proposed by
the American Law Institute as part of the Institute's Model
Penal Code. See ALI, Model Penal Code $ 250.6, Comment
4, pp. 392-393 (1980). The provision, originally designated

$ 250.12, provides that a person who is loitering "under circumstances which justify suspicion that he may be engaged
or about to engage in crime commits a violation if he refuses
the request of a peace officer that he identify himself and
give a reasonably credible account of the lawfulness of his
conduct and purposes." $ 250.12 (Tent. Draft No. 13) (1961).
In some States, a suspect's refusal to identify himself is a
misdemeanor offense or civil violation; in others, it is a factor
to be considered in whether the suspect has violated loitering laws. In other States, a suspect may decline to identify
himself without penalty.

Stop and identify statutes have their roots in early English
vagrancy laws that required suspected vagrants to face arrest unless they gave "a good Account of themselves," 15
Geo. 2, ch. 5, $ 2 (1744), a power that itself reflected commonlaw rights of private persons to "arrest any suspicious nightwalker, and detain him till he give a good account of
himself . . . ." 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, ch. 13, $ 6,
p. 130 (6th ed. 1787). In recent decades, the Court has
found constitutional infirmity in traditional vagrancy laws.

184 HIIBEL v. SIXTH JUDICIAL DIST. COURT OF NEV.,

HUMBOLDT CTY.

Opinion of the Court

In Papachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U. S. 156 (1972), theCourt held that a traditional vagrancy law was void for

vagueness. Its broad scope and imprecise terms deniedproper notice to potential offenders and permitted police officers to exercise unfettered discretion in the enforcement ofthe law. See

id., at 167-171.
The Court has recognized similar constitutional limitations
on the scope and operation of stop and identify statutes. In
Brown v. Texas, 443 U. S. 47, 52 (1979), the Court invalidated
a conviction for violating a Texas stop and identify statuteon Fourth Amendment grounds. The Court ruled that the

initial stop was not based on specific, objective facts establishing reasonable suspicion to believe the suspect was involved in criminal activity. See id., at 51-52. Absent that
factual basis for detaining the defendant, the Court held, the
risk of "arbitrary and abusive police practices" was too great
and the stop was impermissible. Id., at 52. Four Terms
later, the Court invalidated a modified stop and identify statute on vagueness grounds. See Kolender v. Lawson, 461
U. S. 352 (1983). The California law in Kolender required a
suspect to give an officer " `credible and reliable' " identification when asked to identify himself. Id., at 360. The Court
held that the statute was void because it provided no standard for determining what a suspect must do to comply with
it, resulting in " `virtually unrestrained power to arrest and
charge persons with a violation.' " Ibid. (quoting Lewis v.
New Orleans, 415 U. S. 130, 135 (1974) (Powell, J., concurring
in result)).

The present case begins where our prior cases left off.
Here there is no question that the initial stop was based on
reasonable suspicion, satisfying the Fourth Amendment requirements noted in Brown. Further, the petitioner has not
alleged that the statute is unconstitutionally vague, as in Kolender. Here the Nevada statute is narrower and more precise. The statute in Kolender had been interpreted to require a suspect to give the officer "credible and reliable"

Opinion of the Court
identification. In contrast, the Nevada Supreme Court hasinterpreted NRS $ 171.123(3) to require only that a suspect

disclose his name. See 118 Nev., at 875, 59 P. 3d, at 1206(opinion of Young, C. J.) ("The suspect is not required to provide private details about his background, but merely tostate his name to an officer when reasonable suspicion exists"). As we understand it, the statute does not require asuspect to give the officer a driver's license or any other
document. Provided that the suspect either states his nameor communicates it to the officer by other means--a choice,
we assume, that the suspect may make--the statute is satis-fied and no violation occurs. See

id., at 876-877, 59 P. 3d,at 1206-1207.

Hiibel argues that his conviction cannot stand because theofficer's conduct violated his Fourth Amendment rights.

We disagree.Asking questions is an essential part of police investigations. In the ordinary course a police officer is free to aska person for identification without implicating the Fourth
Amendment. "[I]nterrogation relating to one's identity or arequest for identification by the police does not, by itself,
constitute a Fourth Amendment seizure." INS v. Delgado,466 U. S. 210, 216 (1984). Beginning with

Terry v. Ohio, 392U. S. 1 (1968), the Court has recognized that a law enforcement officer's reasonable suspicion that a person may be in-volved in criminal activity permits the officer to stop the
person for a brief time and take additional steps to inves-tigate further.

Delgado, supra, at 216; United States v.Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U. S. 873, 881 (1975). To ensure that

the resulting seizure is constitutionally reasonable, a Terrystop must be limited. The officer's action must be " `justified at its inception, and . . . reasonably related in scope tothe circumstances which justified the interference in the first
place.' " United States v. Sharpe, 470 U. S. 675, 682 (1985)(quoting

Terry, supra, at 20). For example, the seizure can542US1 Unit: $U64 [10-31-06 13:51:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

not continue for an excessive period of time, see United
States v. Place, 462 U. S. 696, 709 (1983), or resemble a traditional arrest, see Dunaway v. New York, 442 U. S. 200, 212(1979).

Our decisions make clear that questions concerning a sus-pect's identity are a routine and accepted part of many

Terry
stops. See United States v. Hensley, 469 U. S. 221, 229
(1985) ("[T]he ability to briefly stop [a suspect], ask ques-tions, or check identification in the absence of probable cause

promotes the strong government interest in solving crimesand bringing offenders to justice");

Hayes v. Florida, 470
U. S. 811, 816 (1985) ("[I]f there are articulable facts supporting a reasonable suspicion that a person has committed a
criminal offense, that person may be stopped in order to
identify him, to question him briefly, or to detain him briefly
while attempting to obtain additional information"); Adams
v. Williams, 407 U. S. 143, 146 (1972) ("A brief stop of a suspicious individual, in order to determine his identity or to
maintain the status quo momentarily while obtaining more
information, may be most reasonable in light of the facts
known to the officer at the time").

Obtaining a suspect's name in the course of a Terry stop
serves important government interests. Knowledge of
identity may inform an officer that a suspect is wanted for
another offense, or has a record of violence or mental disorder. On the other hand, knowing identity may help clear
a suspect and allow the police to concentrate their efforts
elsewhere. Identity may prove particularly important in
cases such as this, where the police are investigating what
appears to be a domestic assault. Officers called to investigate domestic disputes need to know whom they are dealing
with in order to assess the situation, the threat to their own
safety, and possible danger to the potential victim.

Although it is well established that an officer may ask a
suspect to identify himself in the course of a Terry stop, it
has been an open question whether the suspect can be ar542US1 Unit: $U64 [10-31-06 13:51:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
rested and prosecuted for refusal to answer. See Brown,443 U. S., at 53, n. 3. Petitioner draws our attention to

statements in prior opinions that, according to him, answerthe question in his favor. In

Terry, Justice White stated in
a concurring opinion that a person detained in an investiga-tive stop can be questioned but is "not obliged to answer,

answers may not be compelled, and refusal to answer furnishes no basis for an arrest." 392 U. S., at 34. The Courtcited this opinion in dicta in

Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S.
420, 439 (1984), a decision holding that a routine traffic stopis not a custodial stop requiring the protections of

Miranda
v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). In the course of explaining
why Terry stops have not been subject to Miranda, the
Court suggested reasons why Terry stops have a "nonthreatening character," among them the fact that a suspect detained during a Terry stop "is not obliged to respond" to
questions. See Berkemer, supra, at 439, 440. According

to petitioner, these statements establish a right to refuse to
answer questions during a Terry stop.

We do not read these statements as controlling. The passages recognize that the Fourth Amendment does not impose
obligations on the citizen but instead provides rights against
the government. As a result, the Fourth Amendment itself
cannot require a suspect to answer questions. This case
concerns a different issue, however. Here, the source of the
legal obligation arises from Nevada state law, not the Fourth
Amendment. Further, the statutory obligation does not go
beyond answering an officer's request to disclose a name.
See NRS $ 171.123(3) ("Any person so detained shall identify
himself, but may not be compelled to answer any other inquiry of any peace officer"). As a result, we cannot view the
dicta in Berkemer or Justice White's concurrence in Terry as
answering the question whether a State can compel a suspect to disclose his name during a Terry stop.

The principles of Terry permit a State to require a suspect
to disclose his name in the course of a Terry stop. The rea542US1 Unit: $U64 [10-31-06 13:51:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court

sonableness of a seizure under the Fourth Amendment is de-termined "by balancing its intrusion on the individual's

Fourth Amendment interests against its promotion of legiti-mate government interests."

Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S.
648, 654 (1979). The Nevada statute satisfies that standard.The request for identity has an immediate relation to the

purpose, rationale, and practical demands of a Terry stop.
The threat of criminal sanction helps ensure that the requestfor identity does not become a legal nullity. On the other

hand, the Nevada statute does not alter the nature of thestop itself: it does not change its duration,

Place, supra, at
709, or its location, Dunaway, supra, at 212. A state law
requiring a suspect to disclose his name in the course of a
valid Terry stop is consistent with Fourth Amendment prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures.

Petitioner argues that the Nevada statute circumvents the
probable-cause requirement, in effect allowing an officer to
arrest a person for being suspicious. According to petitioner, this creates a risk of arbitrary police conduct that the
Fourth Amendment does not permit. Brief for Petitioner
28-33. These are familiar concerns; they were central to
the opinion in Papachristou, and also to the decisions limiting the operation of stop and identify statutes in Kolender
and Brown. Petitioner's concerns are met by the requirement that a Terry stop must be justified at its inception and
"reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified" the initial stop. 392 U. S., at 20. Under these principles, an officer may not arrest a suspect for failure to identify
himself if the request for identification is not reasonably related to the circumstances justifying the stop. The Court
noted a similar limitation in Hayes, where it suggested that
Terry may permit an officer to determine a suspect's identity
by compelling the suspect to submit to fingerprinting only if
there is "a reasonable basis for believing that fingerprinting
will establish or negate the suspect's connection with that
crime." 470 U. S., at 817. It is clear in this case that the

Opinion of the Court
request for identification was "reasonably related in scope tothe circumstances which justified" the stop. Terry, supra,

at 20. The officer's request was a commonsense inquiry, notan effort to obtain an arrest for failure to identify after a
Terry stop yielded insufficient evidence. The stop, the re-quest, and the State's requirement of a response did not contravene the guarantees of the Fourth Amendment.

Petitioner further contends that his conviction violatesthe Fif th Amendment's prohibiti on on compelled selfincrimination. The Fifth Amendment states that "[n]o per-son . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself." To qualify for the Fifth Amendmentprivilege, a communication must be testimonial, incriminating, and compelled. See United States v. Hubbell, 530 U. S.27, 34-38 (2000).

Respondents urge us to hold that the statements NRS$ 171.123(3) requires are nontestimonial, and so outside the
Clause's scope. We decline to resolve the case on that basis."[T]o be testimonial, an accused's communication must itself,
explicitly or implicitly, relate a factual assertion or discloseinformation." Doe v. United States, 487 U. S. 201, 210
(1988). See also Hubbell, 530 U. S., at 35. Stating one'sname may qualify as an assertion of fact relating to identity.
Production of identity documents might meet the definitionas well. As we noted in

Hubbell, acts of production mayyield testimony establishing "the existence, authenticity, and

custody of items [the police seek]." Id., at 41. Even ifthese required actions are testimonial, however, petitioner's
challenge must fail because in this case disclosure of hisname presented no reasonable danger of incrimination.

The Fifth Amendment prohibits only compelled testimonythat is incriminating. See Brown v. Walker, 161 U. S. 591,
598 (1896) (noting that where "the answer of the witness willnot directly show his infamy, but only

tend to disgrace him,

Opinion of the Court

he is bound to answer"). A claim of Fifth Amendment priv-ilege must establish

" `reasonable ground to apprehend danger to the witnessfrom his being compelled to answer . . . . [T]he danger
to be apprehended must be real and appreciable, withreference to the ordinary operation of law in the ordinary course of things,--not a danger of an imaginaryand unsubstantial character, having reference to some
extraordinary and barely possible contingency, so im-probable that no reasonable man would suffer it to influence his conduct.' " Id., at 599-600 (quoting Queen v.
Boyes, 1 B. & S. 311, 330, 121 Eng. Rep. 730, 738 (Q. B.
1861) (Cockburn, C. J.)).

As we stated in Kastigar v. United States, 406 U. S. 441, 445
(1972), the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsoryself-incrimination "protects against any disclosures that the

witness reasonably believes could be used in a criminalprosecution or could lead to other evidence that might be
so used." Suspects who have been granted immunity from
prosecution may, therefore, be compelled to answer; with the
threat of prosecution removed, there can be no reasonable
belief that the evidence will be used against them. See id.,
at 453.

In this case petitioner's refusal to disclose his name was
not based on any articulated real and appreciable fear that
his name would be used to incriminate him, or that it "would
furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute"
him. Hoffman v. United States, 341 U. S. 479, 486 (1951).
As best we can tell, petitioner refused to identify himself
only because he thought his name was none of the officer's
business. Even today, petitioner does not explain how the
disclosure of his name could have been used against him in a
criminal case. While we recognize petitioner's strong belief
that he should not have to disclose his identity, the Fifth

Stevens, J., dissenting
Amendment does not override the Nevada Legislature'sjudgment to the contrary absent a reasonable belief that the

disclosure would tend to incriminate him.The narrow scope of the disclosure requirement is also important. One's identity is, by definition, unique; yet it is,in another sense, a universal characteristic. Answering a
request to disclose a name is likely to be so insignificant inthe scheme of things as to be incriminating only in unusual
circumstances. See Baltimore City Dept. of Social Servs.v.

Bouknight, 493 U. S. 549, 555 (1990) (suggesting that"fact[s] the State could readily establish" may render "any

testimony regarding existence or authenticity [of them] in-sufficiently incriminating"); cf. California v. Byers, 402 U. S.
424, 432 (1971) (opinion of Burger, C. J.). In every criminalcase, it is known and must be known who has been arrested
and who is being tried. Cf. Pennsylvania v. Muniz, 496U. S. 582, 601-602 (1990) (principal opinion of Brennan, J.).
Even witnesses who plan to invoke the Fifth Amendmentprivilege answer when their names are called to take the
stand. Still, a case may arise where there is a substantialallegation that furnishing identity at the time of a stop would
have given the police a link in the chain of evidence neededto convict the individual of a separate offense. In that case,
the court can then consider whether the privilege applies,and, if the Fifth Amendment has been violated, what remedy
must follow. We need not resolve those questions here.The judgment of the Nevada Supreme Court is

Affirmed.

crime" 1--persons who are, in other words, targets of a crimi-nal investigation. The statute therefore is directed not "at

the public at large," but rather "at a highly selective groupinherently suspect of criminal activities." Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control Bd., 382 U. S. 70, 79 (1965).Under the Nevada law, a member of the targeted class
"may not be compelled to answer" any inquiry except a com-mand that he "identify himself."

2 Refusal to identify oneself upon request is punishable as a crime.3 Presumably thestatute does not require the detainee to answer any other

question because the Nevada Legislature realized that theFifth Amendment prohibits compelling the target of a criminal investigation to make any other statement. In my judg-ment, the broad constitutional right to remain silent, which
derives from the Fifth Amendment's guarantee that "[n]operson . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a
witness against himself," 4 is not as circumscribed as theCourt suggests, and does not admit even of the narrow exception defined by the Nevada statute."[T]here can be no doubt that the Fifth Amendment privilege is available outside of criminal court proceedings andserves to protect persons in all settings in which their freedom of action is curtailed in any significant way from beingcompelled to incriminate themselves." Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 467 (1966). It is a "settled principle"that "the police have the right to request citizens to answer
voluntarily questions concerning unsolved crimes, " but

3 In this case, petitioner was charged with violating $ 199.280, which

makes it a crime to "willfully resis[t], dela[y] or obstruc[t] a public officer

violation of that provision is a misdemeanor unless a dangerous weapon
is involved.

"they have no right to compel them to answer." Davis v.
Mississippi, 394 U. S. 721, 727, n. 6 (1969). The protections
of the Fifth Amendment are directed squarely toward thosewho are the focus of the government's investigative and

prosecutorial powers. In a criminal trial, the indicted de-fendant has an unqualified right to refuse to testify and may
not be punished for invoking that right. See Carter v. Kentucky, 450 U. S. 288, 299-300 (1981). The unindicted targetof a grand jury investigation enjoys the same constitutional

protection even if he has been served with a subpoena. See
Chavez v. Martinez, 538 U. S. 760, 767-768 (2003). So does
an arrested suspect during custodial interrogation in a police
station. Miranda, 384 U. S., at 467.

There is no reason why the subject of police interrogation
based on mere suspicion, rather than probable cause, should
have any lesser protection. Indeed, we have said that the
Fifth Amendment's protections apply with equal force in the
context of Terry stops, see Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968),
where an officer's inquiry "must be `reasonably related in
scope to the justification for [the stop's] initiation,' " Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 439 (1984) (some internal
quotation marks omitted). "Typically, this means that the
officer may ask the detainee a moderate number of questions
to determine his identity and to try to obtain information
confirming or dispelling the officer's suspicions. But the detainee is not obliged to respond." Ibid. See also Terry, 392
U. S., at 34 (White, J., concurring) ("Of course, the person
stopped is not obliged to answer, answers may not be compelled, and refusal to answer furnishes no basis for an arrest,
although it may alert the officer to the need for continued
observation"). Given our statements to the effect that citizens are not required to respond to police officers' questions
during a Terry stop, it is no surprise that petitioner assumed,
as have we, that he had a right not to disclose his identity.

The Court correctly observes that a communication does
not enjoy the Fifth Amendment privilege unless it is testi542US1 Unit: $U64 [10-31-06 13:51:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

monial. Although the Court declines to resolve this ques-tion,

ante, at 189, I think it clear that this case concerns
a testimonial communication. Recognizing that whether acommunication is testimonial is sometimes a "difficult question," Doe v. United States, 487 U. S. 201, 214-215 (1988), wehave stated generally that "[i]t is the `extortion of information from the accused,' the attempt to force him `to disclose
the contents of his own mind,' that implicates the Self-Incrimination Clause,"

id., at 211 (citations omitted). While
"[t]he vast majority of verbal statements thus will be testi-monial and, to that extent at least, will fall within the privilege," id., at 213-214, certain acts and physical evidence falloutside the privilege.

5 In all instances, we have afforded

Fifth Amendment protection if the disclosure in questionwas being admitted because of its content rather than some

other aspect of the communication.6Considered in light of these precedents, the compelled
statement at issue in this case is clearly testimonial. It is
significant that the communication must be made in response

5 A suspect may be made, for example, to provide a blood sample,
Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, 765 (1966), a voice exemplar,
United States v. Dionisio, 410 U. S. 1, 7 (1973), or a handwriting sample,
Gilbert v. California, 388 U. S. 263, 266-267 (1967).

6 See Pennsylvania v. Muniz, 496 U. S. 582, 598-599 (1990) (respondent's answer to the "birthday question" was protected because the "content of his truthful answer supported an inference that his mental faculties
were impaired"); Doe v. United States, 487 U. S. 201, 211, n. 10 (1988) ("The
content itself must have testimonial significance"); Fisher v. United States,
425 U. S. 391, 410-411 (1976) ("[H]owever incriminating the contents of
the accountant's workpapers might be, the act of producing them--the
only thing which the taxpayer is compelled to do--would not itself involve
testimonial self-incrimination"); Gilbert, 388 U. S., at 266-267 ("A mere
handwriting exemplar, in contrast to the content of what is written, like
the voice or body itself, is an identifying physical characteristic outside its
protection"); United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 223 (1967) ("[I]t deserves emphasis that this case presents no question of the admissibility
in evidence of anything Wade said or did at the lineup which implicates
his privilege").

to a question posed by a police officer. As we recently ex-plained, albeit in the different context of the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause, "[w]hatever else the term [`tes-timonial'] covers, it applies at a minimum . . . to police
interrogations." Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 68(2004). Surely police questioning during a

Terry stop qualifies as an interrogation, and it follows that responses to such
questions are testimonial in nature.Rather than determining whether the communication at

issue is testimonial, the Court instead concludes that theState can compel the disclosure of one's identity because it
is not "incriminating." Ante, at 189. But our cases have
afforded Fifth Amendment protection to statements that are
"incriminating" in a much broader sense than the Court suggests. It has "long been settled that [the Fifth Amendment's] protection encompasses compelled statements that
lead to the discovery of incriminating evidence even though
the statements themselves are not incriminating and are not
introduced into evidence." United States v. Hubbell, 530
U. S. 27, 37 (2000). By "incriminating" we have meant disclosures that "could be used in a criminal prosecution or
could lead to other evidence that might be so used," Kastigar
v. United States, 406 U. S. 441, 445 (1972)--communications,
in other words, that "would furnish a link in the chain of
evidence needed to prosecute the claimant for a federal
crime," Hoffman v. United States, 341 U. S. 479, 486 (1951).
Thus, "[c]ompelled testimony that communicates information
that may `lead to incriminating evidence' is privileged even
if the information itself is not inculpatory." Hubbell, 530
U. S., at 38 (quoting Doe, 487 U. S., at 208, n. 6).

Given a proper understanding of the category of "incriminating" communications that fall within the Fifth Amendment privilege, it is clear that the disclosure of petitioner's
identity is protected. The Court reasons that we should not
assume that the disclosure of petitioner's "name would be
used to incriminate him, or that it would furnish a link in [a]

chain of evidence needed to prosecute him." Ante, at 190(internal quotation marks omitted). But why else would an

officer ask for it? And why else would the Nevada Legisla-ture require its disclosure only when circumstances "reasonably indicate that the person has committed, is committingor is about to commit a crime"?

7 If the Court is correct,

then petitioner's refusal to cooperate did not impede the po-lice investigation. Indeed, if we accept the predicate for the

Court's holding, the statute requires nothing more than auseless invasion of privacy. I think that, on the contrary,
the Nevada Legislature intended to provide its police officers
with a useful law enforcement tool, and that the very exist-ence of the statute demonstrates the value of the information

it demands.A person's identity obviously bears informational and incriminating worth, "even if the [name] itself is not inculpa-tory."

Hubbell, 530 U. S., at 38. A name can provide the
key to a broad array of information about the person, partic-ularly in the hands of a police officer with access to a range

of law enforcement databases. And that information, in
turn, can be tremendously useful in a criminal prosecution.It is therefore quite wrong to suggest that a person's identity

provides a link in the chain to incriminating evidence "onlyin unusual circumstances."

Ante, at 191.
The officer in this case told petitioner, in the Court'swords, that "he was conducting an investigation and needed

to see some identification." Ante, at 181. As the target ofthat investigation, petitioner, in my view, acted well within
his rights when he opted to stand mute. Accordingly, Irespectfully dissent.

7 Nev. Rev. Stat. $ 171.123(1) (2003). The Court suggests that furnishing identification also allows the investigating officer to assess the threat
to himself and others. See ante, at 186. But to the extent that officer
or public safety is immediately at issue, that concern is sufficiently alleviated by the officer's ability to perform a limited patdown search for weapons. See Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 25-26 (1968).

Breyer, J., dissenting
Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

Notwithstanding the vagrancy statutes to which the majority refers, see ante, at 183-184, this Court's Fourth
Amendment precedents make clear that police may conduct
a Terry stop only within circumscribed limits. And one of
those limits invalidates laws that compel responses to police questioning.

In Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968), the Court considered
whether police, in the absence of probable cause, can stop,
question, or frisk an individual at all. The Court recognized
that the Fourth Amendment protects the " `right of every
individual to the possession and control of his own person.' "
Id., at 9 (quoting Union Pacific R. Co. v. Botsford, 141 U. S.
250, 251 (1891)). At the same time, it recognized that in
certain circumstances, public safety might require a limited
"seizure," or stop, of an individual against his will. The
Court consequently set forth conditions circumscribing when
and how the police might conduct a Terry stop. They include what has become known as the "reasonable suspicion"
standard. 392 U. S., at 20-22. Justice White, in a separate
concurring opinion, set forth further conditions. Justice
White wrote: "Of course, the person stopped is not obliged
to answer, answers may not be compelled, and refusal to answer furnishes no basis for an arrest, although it may alert
the officer to the need for continued observation." Id., at 34.

About 10 years later, the Court, in Brown v. Texas, 443
U. S. 47 (1979), held that police lacked "any reasonable suspicion" to detain the particular petitioner and require him to
identify himself. Id., at 53. The Court noted that the trial
judge had asked the following: " `I'm sure [officers conducting
a Terry stop] should ask everything they possibly could find
out. What I'm asking is what's the State's interest in putting a man in jail because he doesn't want to answer . . . .' "
Id., at 54 (Appendix to opinion of the Court) (emphasis in

original). The Court referred to Justice White's Terry con-currence. 443 U. S., at 53, n. 3. And it said that it "need

not decide" the matter. Ibid.Then, five years later, the Court wrote that an "officer may
ask the [Terry] detainee a moderate number of questionsto determine his identity and to try to obtain information
confirming or dispelling the officer's suspicions. But the detainee is not obliged to respond." Berkemer v. McCarty,468 U. S. 420, 439 (1984) (emphasis added). See also

Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 365 (1983) (Brennan, J., con-curring) (

Terry suspect "must be free to . . . decline to answer the questions put to him"); Illinois v. Wardlow, 528
U. S. 119, 125 (2000) (stating that allowing officers to stop
and question a fleeing person "is quite consistent with the
individual's right to go about his business or to stay put and
remain silent in the face of police questioning").

This lengthy history--of concurring opinions, of references, and of clear explicit statements--means that the
Court's statement in Berkemer, while technically dicta, is the
kind of strong dicta that the legal community typically takes
as a statement of the law. And that law has remained undisturbed for more than 20 years.

There is no good reason now to reject this generation-old
statement of the law. There are sound reasons rooted in
Fif th Amendment considerations for adhering to this
Fourth Amendment legal condition circumscribing police
authority to stop an individual against his will. See ante, at
192-196 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Administrative considerations also militate against change. Can a State, in addition
to requiring a stopped individual to answer "What's your
name?" also require an answer to "What's your license number?" or "Where do you live?" Can a police officer, who
must know how to make a Terry stop, keep track of the constitutional answers? After all, answers to any of these
questions may, or may not, incriminate, depending upon the
circumstances.

Indeed, as the Court points out, a name itself--even if itis not "Killer Bill" or "Rough 'em up Harry"--will sometimes

provide the police with "a link in the chain of evidenceneeded to convict the individual of a separate offense."
Ante, at 191. The majority reserves judgment aboutwhether compulsion is permissible in such instances. Ibid.
How then is a police officer in the midst of a Terry stop todistinguish between the majority's ordinary case and this
special case where the majority reserves judgment?The majority presents no evidence that the rule enunciated by Justice White and then by the Berkemer Court,which for nearly a generation has set forth a settled

Terry-stop condition, has significantly interfered with law enforcement. Nor has the majority presented any other convincingjustification for change. I would not begin to erode a clear
rule with special exceptions.I consequently dissent.

AETNA HEALTH INC., fka AETNA U. S.HEALTHCARE INC.,

et al. v. DAVILA

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 02-1845. Argued March 23, 2004--Decided June 21, 2004*
Respondents brought separate Texas state-court suits, alleging that petitioners, their health maintenance organizations (HMOs), had refused to
cover certain medical services in violation of an HMO's duty "to exercise
ordinary care" under the Texas Health Care Liability Act (THCLA),
and that those refusals "proximately caused" respondents' injuries.
Petitioners removed the cases to federal courts, claiming that the actions fit within the scope of, and were thus completely pre-empted
by, $ 502 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(ERISA). The District Courts agreed, declined to remand the cases to
state court, and dismissed the complaints with prejudice after respondents refused to amend them to bring explicit ERISA claims. Consolidating these and other cases, the Fifth Circuit reversed. It found that
respondents' claims did not fall under ERISA $ 502(a)(2), which allows
suit against a plan fiduciary for breaches of fiduciary duty to the plan,
because petitioners were being sued for mixed eligibility and treatment
decisions that were not fiduciary in nature, see Pegram v. Herdrich, 530
U. S. 211; and did not fall within the scope of $ 502(a)(1)(B), which provides a cause of action for the recovery of wrongfully denied benefits,
because THCLA did not duplicate that cause of action, see Rush Prudential HMO, Inc. v. Moran, 536 U. S. 355.

(a) When a federal statute completely pre-empts a state-law cause of
action, the state claim can be removed. See Beneficial Nat. Bank v.
Anderson, 539 U. S. 1, 8. ERISA is such a statute. Because its purpose is to provide a uniform regulatory regime, ERISA includes expansive pre-emption provisions, such as ERISA $ 502(a)'s integrated enforcement mechanism, which are intended to ensure that employee
benefit plan regulation is "exclusively a federal concern," Alessi v.
Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 451 U. S. 504, 523. Any state-law cause of

Syllabus
action that duplicates, supplements, or supplants ERISA's civil enforcement remedy conflicts with clear congressional intent to make that
remedy exclusive, and is therefore pre-empted. ERISA $ 502(a)'s preemptive force is still stronger. Since ERISA $ 502(a)(1)(B)'s preemptive force mirrors that of $ 301 of the Labor Management Relations
Act, 1947, Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U. S. 58, 65-66, and
since $ 301 converts state causes of actions into federal ones for purposes of determining the propriety of removal, so too does ERISA

$ 502(a)(1)(B). Pp. 207-209.

(b) If an individual, at some point in time, could have brought his
claim under ERISA $ 502(a)(1)(B), and where no other independent legal
duty is implicated by a defendant's actions, then the individual's cause of
action is completely pre-empted by ERISA $ 502(a)(1)(B). Respondents
brought suit only to rectify wrongful benefits denials, and their only
relationship with petitioners is petitioners' partial administration of
their ERISA-regulated benefit plans; respondents therefore could have
brought $ 502(a)(1)(B) claims to recover the allegedly wrongfully denied
benefits. Both respondents allege violations of the THCLA's duty of
ordinary care, which they claim is entirely independent of any ERISA
duty or the employee benefits plans at issue. However, respondents'
claims do not arise independently of ERISA or the plan terms. If a
managed care entity correctly concluded that, under the relevant plan's
terms, a particular treatment was not covered, the plan's failure to cover
the requested treatment would be the proximate cause of any injury
arising from the denial. More significantly, the THCLA provides that
a managed care entity is not subject to THCLA liability if it denies
coverage for a treatment not covered by the plan it administers.
Pp. 210-214.

(c) The Fifth Circuit's reasons for reaching its contrary conclusion are
all erroneous. First, it found significant that respondents asserted tort,
rather than contract, claims and that they were not seeking reimbursement for benefits denied. However, distinguishing between preempted and non-pre-empted claims based on the particular label affixed
to them would allow parties to evade ERISA's pre-emptive scope simply
by relabeling contract claims as claims for tortious breach of contracts.
And the fact that a state cause of action attempts to authorize remedies
beyond those that ERISA $ 502(a) authorizes does not put it outside the
scope of ERISA's civil enforcement mechanism. See, e. g., Pilot Life
Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41, 43. Second, the court believed the
plans' wording immaterial because the claims invoked an external ordinary care duty, but the wording is material to the state causes of action
and the THCLA creates a duty that is not external to respondents'
rights under their respective plans. Finally, nowhere in Rush Pruden542US1 Unit: $U65 [10-31-06 14:02:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
202 AETNA HEALTH INC. v. DAVILA

Syllabus
tial did this Court suggest that ERISA $ 502(a)'s pre-emptive force is
limited to state causes of action that precisely duplicate an ERISA

$ 502(a) cause. Nor would it be consistent with this Court's precedent
to do so. Pp. 214-216.

(d) Also unavailing is respondents' argument that the THCLA is a
law regulating insurance that is saved from pre-emption by ERISA

$ 514(b)(2)(A). This Court's understanding of $ 514(b)(2)(A) is informed
by the overpowering federal policy embodied in ERISA $ 502(a), which
is intended to create an exclusive federal remedy, Pilot Life, 481 U. S.,
at 52. Allowing respondents to proceed with their state-law suits
would "pose an obstacle" to that objective. Ibid. Pp. 216-218.

(e) Pegram's holding that an HMO is not intended to be treated as a
fiduciary to the extent that it makes mixed eligibility decisions acting
through its physicians is not implicated here because petitioners' coverage decisions are pure eligibility decisions. A benefit determination
under ERISA is part and parcel of the ordinary fiduciary responsibilities
connected to the administration of a plan. That it is infused with medical judgments does not alter this result. Pegram itself recognized this
principle, see 530 U. S., at 231-232. And ERISA and its implementing
regulations confirm this interpretation. Here, petitioners are neither
respondents' treating physicians nor those physicians' employees.

204 AETNA HEALTH INC. v. DAVILA

Opinion of the Court
Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
In these consolidated cases, two individuals sued their re-spective health maintenance organizations (HMOs) for alleged failures to exercise ordinary care in the handling ofcoverage decisions, in violation of a duty imposed by the
Texas Health Care Liability Act (THCLA), Tex. Civ. Prac. &Rem. Code Ann. $$ 88.001-88.003 (West 2004 Supp. Pamphlet). We granted certiorari to decide whether the indi-viduals' causes of action are completely pre-empted by the
"interlocking, interrelated, and interdependent remedialscheme,"

Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473U. S. 134, 146 (1985), found at $ 502(a) of the Employee

Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 88 Stat.891, as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a)

et seq. 540 U. S. 981(2003). We hold that the causes of action are completely

pre-empted and hence removable from state to federal court.The Court of Appeals, having reached a contrary conclusion,
is reversed. I

A
Respondent Juan Davila is a participant, and respondentRuby Calad is a beneficiary, in ERISA-regulated employee

benefit plans. Their respective plan sponsors had enteredinto agreements with petitioners, Aetna Health Inc. and
CIGNA HealthCare of Texas, Inc., to administer the plans.Under Davila's plan, for instance, Aetna reviews requests for
coverage and pays providers, such as doctors, hospitals, andnursing homes, which perform covered services for members; under Calad's plan sponsor's agreement, CIGNA is re-sponsible for plan benefits and coverage decisions.

Respondents both suffered injuries allegedly arising fromAetna's and CIGNA's decisions not to provide coverage for

A. McHugh, Jr., and Gregory B. Heller; for United Policyholders by Arnold R. Levinson; and for Senator Edward M. Kennedy et al. by
Mr. Zaremski.

Opinion of the Court
certain treatment and services recommended by respond-ents' treating physicians. Davila's treating physician prescribed Vioxx to remedy Davila's arthritis pain, but Aetnarefused to pay for it. Davila did not appeal or contest this
decision, nor did he purchase Vioxx with his own resourcesand seek reimbursement. Instead, Davila began taking Naprosyn, from which he allegedly suffered a severe reac-tion that required extensive treatment and hospitalization.
Calad underwent surgery, and although her treating physi-cian recommended an extended hospital stay, a CIGNA discharge nurse determined that Calad did not meet the plan'scriteria for a continued hospital stay. CIGNA consequently
denied coverage for the extended hospital stay. Calad expe-rienced postsurgery complications forcing her to return to
the hospital. She alleges that these complications would nothave occurred had CIGNA approved coverage for a longer
hospital stay.Respondents brought separate suits in Texas state court
against petitioners. Invoking THCLA $ 88.002(a), respond-ents argued that petitioners' refusal to cover the requested
services violated their "duty to exercise ordinary care whenmaking health care treatment decisions," and that these refusals "proximately caused" their injuries. Ibid. Petition-ers removed the cases to Federal District Courts, arguing
that respondents' causes of action fit within the scope of, andwere therefore completely pre-empted by, ERISA $ 502(a).
The respective District Courts agreed, and declined to re-mand the cases to state court. Because respondents refused
to amend their complaints to bring explicit ERISA claims,the District Courts dismissed the complaints with prejudice.

B
Both Davila and Calad appealed the refusals to remand tostate court. The United States Court of Appeals for the

Fifth Circuit consolidated their cases with several othersraising similar issues. The Court of Appeals recognized

542US1 Unit: $U65 [10-31-06 14:02:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
206 AETNA HEALTH INC. v. DAVILA

Opinion of the Court
that state causes of action that "duplicat[e] or fal[l] within
the scope of an ERISA $ 502(a) remedy" are completely preempted and hence removable to federal court. Roark v.
Humana, Inc., 307 F. 3d 298, 305 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). After examining the causes of action
available under $ 502(a), the Court of Appeals determined
that respondents' claims could possibly fall under only two:

$ 502(a)(1)(B), which provides a cause of action for the recovery of wrongfully denied benefits, and $ 502(a)(2), which
allows suit against a plan fiduciary for breaches of fiduciary
duty to the plan.

Analyzing $ 502(a)(2) first, the Court of Appeals concluded
that, under Pegram v. Herdrich, 530 U. S. 211 (2000), the decisions for which petitioners were being sued were "mixed
eligibility and treatment decisions" and hence were not fiduciary in nature. 307 F. 3d, at 307-308.1 The Court of Appeals next determined that respondents' claims did not fall
within $ 502(a)(1)(B)'s scope. It found significant that respondents "assert tort claims," while $ 502(a)(1)(B) "creates
a cause of action for breach of contract," id., at 309, and also
that respondents "are not seeking reimbursement for benefits denied them," but rather request "tort damages" arising
from "an external, statutorily imposed duty of `ordinary
care,' " ibid. From Rush Prudential HMO, Inc. v. Moran,
536 U. S. 355 (2002), the Court of Appeals derived the principle that complete pre-emption is limited to situations in
which "States . . . duplicate the causes of action listed in
ERISA $ 502(a)," and concluded that "[b]ecause the THCLA
does not provide an action for collecting benefits," it fell outside the scope of $ 502(a)(1)(B). 307 F. 3d, at 310-311.

1 In this Court, petitioners do not claim or argue that respondents'
causes of action fall under ERISA $ 502(a)(2). Because petitioners do not
argue this point, and since we can resolve these cases entirely by reference
to ERISA $ 502(a)(1)(B), we do not address ERISA $ 502(a)(2).

Opinion of the Court

II

A

Under the removal statute, "any civil action brought in aState court of which the district courts of the United States

have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the defend-ant" to federal court. 28 U. S. C. $ 1441(a). One category
of cases of which district courts have original jurisdiction is"[f]ederal question" cases: cases "arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States." $ 1331. Weface in these cases the issue whether respondents' causes of
action arise under federal law.Ordinarily, determining whether a particular case arises
under federal law turns on the " `well-pleaded complaint' "rule.

Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction LaborersVacation Trust for Southern Cal., 463 U. S. 1, 9-10 (1983).

The Court has explained that

"whether a case is one arising under the Constitution ora law or treaty of the United States, in the sense of the

jurisdictional statute[,] . . . must be determined fromwhat necessarily appears in the plaintiff 's statement of
his own claim in the bill or declaration, unaided by any-thing alleged in anticipation of avoidance of defenses
which it is thought the defendant may interpose." Taylor v. Anderson, 234 U. S. 74, 75-76 (1914).

In particular, the existence of a federal defense normallydoes not create statutory "arising under" jurisdiction,

Louis-ville & Nashville R. Co. v. Mottley, 211 U. S. 149 (1908), and

"a defendant may not [generally] remove a case to federalcourt unless the plaintiff 's complaint establishes that the
case `arises under' federal law," Franchise Tax Bd., supra,at 10. There is an exception, however, to the well-pleaded
complaint rule. "[W]hen a federal statute wholly displacesthe state-law cause of action through complete pre-emption,"
the state claim can be removed. Beneficial Nat. Bank v.
Anderson, 539 U. S. 1, 8 (2003). This is so because "[w]hen

542US1 Unit: $U65 [10-31-06 14:02:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
208 AETNA HEALTH INC. v. DAVILA

Opinion of the Court
the federal statute completely pre-empts the state-law cause
of action, a claim which comes within the scope of that cause
of action, even if pleaded in terms of state law, is in reality based on federal law." Ibid. ERISA is one of these
statutes.

B

Congress enacted ERISA to "protect . . . the interests of
participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries" by setting out substantive regulatory requirements
for employee benefit plans and to "provid[e] for appropriate
remedies, sanctions, and ready access to the Federal courts."
29 U. S. C. $ 1001(b). The purpose of ERISA is to provide
a uniform regulatory regime over employee benefit plans.
To this end, ERISA includes expansive pre-emption provisions, see ERISA $ 514, 29 U. S. C. $ 1144, which are intended
to ensure that employee benefit plan regulation would
be "exclusively a federal concern." Alessi v. RaybestosManhattan, Inc., 451 U. S. 504, 523 (1981).

ERISA's "comprehensive legislative scheme" includes "an
integrated system of procedures for enforcement." Russell,
473 U. S., at 147 (internal quotation marks omitted). This
integrated enforcement mechanism, ERISA $ 502(a), 29
U. S. C. $ 1132(a), is a distinctive feature of ERISA, and essential to accomplish Congress' purpose of creating a comprehensive statute for the regulation of employee benefit
plans. As the Court said in Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux,
481 U. S. 41 (1987):

"[T]he detailed provisions of $ 502(a) set forth a comprehensive civil enforcement scheme that represents a
careful balancing of the need for prompt and fair claims
settlement procedures against the public interest in encouraging the formation of employee benefit plans. The
policy choices reflected in the inclusion of certain remedies and the exclusion of others under the federal
scheme would be completely undermined if ERISA-plan

542US1 Unit: $U65 [10-31-06 14:02:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

209Cite as: 542 U. S. 200 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
participants and beneficiaries were free to obtain remedies under state law that Congress rejected in ERISA.
`The six carefully integrated civil enforcement provisions found in $ 502(a) of the statute as finally enacted
. . . provide strong evidence that Congress did not intend
to authorize other remedies that it simply forgot to
incorporate expressly.' " Id., at 54 (quoting Russell,
supra, at 146).

Therefore, any state-law cause of action that duplicates, supplements, or supplants the ERISA civil enforcement remedy
conflicts with the clear congressional intent to make the
ERISA remedy exclusive and is therefore pre-empted. See
481 U. S., at 54-56; see also Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U. S. 133, 143-145 (1990).

The pre-emptive force of ERISA $ 502(a) is still stronger.
In Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U. S. 58, 65-66
(1987), the Court determined that the similarity of the language used in the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947
(LMRA), and ERISA, combined with the "clear intention" of
Congress "to make $ 502(a)(1)(B) suits brought by participants or beneficiaries federal questions for the purposes
of federal court jurisdiction in like manner as $ 301 of

the LMRA," established that ERISA $ 502(a)(1)(B)'s preemptive force mirrored the pre-emptive force of LMRA

$ 301. Since LMRA $ 301 converts state causes of action
into federal ones for purposes of determining the propriety
of removal, see Avco Corp. v. Machinists, 390 U. S. 557
(1968), so too does ERISA $ 502(a)(1)(B). Thus, the ERISA
civil enforcement mechanism is one of those provisions with
such "extraordinary pre-emptive power" that it "converts an
ordinary state common law complaint into one stating a federal claim for purposes of the well-pleaded complaint rule."
Metropolitan Life, 481 U. S., at 65-66. Hence, "causes of
action within the scope of the civil enforcement provisions of

$ 502(a) [are] removable to federal court." Id., at 66.

210 AETNA HEALTH INC. v. DAVILA

Opinion of the Court

III

A

ERISA $ 502(a)(1)(B) provides:

"A civil action may be brought--(1) by a participant or
beneficiary--. . . (B) to recover benefits due to him under
the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the
terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future
benefits under the terms of the plan." 29 U. S. C.

$ 1132(a)(1)(B).

This provision is relatively straightforward. If a participant
or beneficiary believes that benefits promised to him under
the terms of the plan are not provided, he can bring suit
seeking provision of those benefits. A participant or beneficiary can also bring suit generically to "enforce his rights"
under the plan, or to clarify any of his rights to future benefits. Any dispute over the precise terms of the plan is resolved by a court under a de novo review standard, unless
the terms of the plan "giv[e] the administrator or fiduciary
discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits
or to construe the terms of the plan." Firestone Tire &
Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U. S. 101, 115 (1989).

It follows that if an individual brings suit complaining of a
denial of coverage for medical care, where the individual is
entitled to such coverage only because of the terms of an
ERISA-regulated employee benefit plan, and where no legal
duty (state or federal) independent of ERISA or the plan
terms is violated, then the suit falls "within the scope of "
ERISA $ 502(a)(1)(B). Metropolitan Life, supra, at 66. In
other words, if an individual, at some point in time, could
have brought his claim under ERISA $ 502(a)(1)(B), and
where there is no other independent legal duty that is implicated by a defendant's actions, then the individual's cause of
action is completely pre-empted by ERISA $ 502(a)(1)(B).

211Cite as: 542 U. S. 200 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
To determine whether respondents' causes of action fall
"within the scope" of ERISA $ 502(a)(1)(B), we must examine
respondents' complaints, the statute on which their claims
are based (the THCLA), and the various plan documents.
Davila alleges that Aetna provides health coverage under his
employer's health benefits plan. App. H to Pet. for Cert. in
No. 02-1845, p. 67a, || 11. Davila also alleges that after his
primary care physician prescribed Vioxx, Aetna refused to
pay for it. Id., at 67a, || 12. The only action complained of
was Aetna's refusal to approve payment for Davila's Vioxx
prescription. Further, the only relationship Aetna had with
Davila was its partial administration of Davila's employer's
benefit plan. See App. JA-25, JA-31, JA-39 to JA-40,
JA-45 to JA-48, JA-108.

Similarly, Calad alleges that she receives, as her husband's
beneficiary under an ERISA-regulated benefit plan, health
coverage from CIGNA. Id., at JA-184, || 17. She alleges
that she was informed by CIGNA, upon admittance into a
hospital for major surgery, that she would be authorized to
stay for only one day. Id., at JA-184, || 18. She also alleges
that CIGNA, acting through a discharge nurse, refused to
authorize more than a single day despite the advice and recommendation of her treating physician. Id., at JA-185,
|||| 20, 21. Calad contests only CIGNA's decision to refuse
coverage for her hospital stay. Id., at JA-185, || 20. And,
as in Davila's case, the only connection between Calad and
CIGNA is CIGNA's administration of portions of Calad's
ERISA-regulated benefit plan. Id., at JA-219 to JA-221.

It is clear, then, that respondents complain only about denials of coverage promised under the terms of ERISAregulated employee benefit plans. Upon the denial of benefits, respondents could have paid for the treatment
themselves and then sought reimbursement through a

$ 502(a)(1)(B) action, or sought a preliminary injunction, see
Pryzbowski v. U. S. Healthcare, Inc., 245 F. 3d 266, 274 (CA3

212 AETNA HEALTH INC. v. DAVILA

Opinion of the Court
2001) (giving examples where federal courts have issuedsuch preliminary injunctions).

2

Respondents contend, however, that the complained-of ac-tions violate legal duties that arise independently of ERISA

or the terms of the employee benefit plans at issue in thesecases. Both respondents brought suit specifically under the
THCLA, alleging that petitioners "controlled, influenced,
participated in and made decisions which affected the qualityof the diagnosis, care, and treatment provided" in a manner

that violated "the duty of ordinary care set forth in $$ 88.001and 88.002." App. H to Pet. for Cert. in No. 02-1845, at 69a,
|| 18; see also App. JA-187, || 28. Respondents contend thatthis duty of ordinary care is an independent legal duty.
They analogize to this Court's decisions interpreting LMRA$ 301, 29 U. S. C. $ 185, with particular focus on

Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 U. S. 386 (1987) (suit for breach ofindividual employment contract, even if defendant's action

also constituted a breach of an entirely separate collectivebargaining agreement, not pre-empted by LMRA $ 301).
Because this duty of ordinary care arises independently of
any duty imposed by ERISA or the plan terms, the argument goes, any civil action to enforce this duty is not within
the scope of the ERISA civil enforcement mechanism.

The duties imposed by the THCLA in the context of these
cases, however, do not arise independently of ERISA or the
plan terms. The THCLA does impose a duty on managed
care entities to "exercise ordinary care when making health
care treatment decisions," and makes them liable for damages proximately caused by failures to abide by that duty.

2 Respondents also argue that the benefit due under their ERISAregulated employee benefit plans is simply the membership in the respective HMOs, not coverage for the particular medical treatments that are
delineated in the plan documents. See Brief for Respondents 28-30. Respondents did not identify this possible argument in their brief in opposition to the petitions for certiorari, and we deem it waived. See this
Court's Rule 15.2.

542US1 Unit: $U65 [10-31-06 14:02:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

213Cite as: 542 U. S. 200 (2004)
Opinion of the Court

$ 88.002(a). However, if a managed care entity correctlyconcluded that, under the terms of the relevant plan, a particular treatment was not covered, the managed care entity'sdenial of coverage would not be a proximate cause of any
injuries arising from the denial. Rather, the failure of theplan itself to cover the requested treatment would be the
proximate cause.3 More significantly, the THCLA clearlystates that "[t]he standards in Subsections (a) and (b) create
no obligation on the part of the health insurance carrier,health maintenance organization, or other managed care entity to provide to an insured or enrollee treatment whichis not covered by the health care plan of the entity."

$ 88.002(d). Hence, a managed care entity could not be sub-ject to liability under the THCLA if it denied coverage for
any treatment not covered by the health care plan that itwas administering.

Thus, interpretation of the terms of respondents' benefitplans forms an essential part of their THCLA claim, and
THCLA liability would exist here only because of petition-ers' administration of ERISA-regulated benefit plans. Petitioners' potential liability under the THCLA in these cases,then, derives entirely from the particular rights and obligations established by the benefit plans. So, unlike the state-law claims in Caterpillar, supra, respondents' THCLA
causes of action are not entirely independent of the feder-ally regulated contract itself. Cf. Allis-Chalmers Corp. v.
Lueck, 471 U. S. 202, 217 (1985) (state-law tort of bad-faithhandling of insurance claim pre-empted by LMRA $ 301,
since the "duties imposed and rights established through thestate tort . . . derive[d] from the rights and obligations established by the contract"); Steelworkers v. Rawson, 495 U. S.

3 To take a clear example, if the terms of the health care plan specifically
exclude from coverage the cost of an appendectomy, then any injuries
caused by the refusal to cover the appendectomy are properly attributed
to the terms of the plan itself, not the managed care entity that applied
those terms.

214 AETNA HEALTH INC. v. DAVILA

Opinion of the Court
362, 371 (1990) (state-law tort action brought due to allegednegligence in the inspection of a mine was pre-empted,

as the duty to inspect the mine arose solely out of thecollective-bargaining agreement).

Hence, respondents bring suit only to rectify a wrongfuldenial of benefits promised under ERISA-regulated plans,
and do not attempt to remedy any violation of a legalduty independent of ERISA. We hold that respondents'
state causes of action fall "within the scope of " ERISA$ 502(a)(1)(B),

Metropolitan Life, 481 U. S., at 66, and aretherefore completely pre-empted by ERISA $ 502 and removable to federal district court.4

B
The Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion forseveral reasons, all of them erroneous. First, the Court of

Appeals found significant that respondents "assert a tortclaim for tort damages" rather than "a contract claim for
contract damages," and that respondents "are not seekingreimbursement for benefits denied them." 307 F. 3d, at 309.
But, distinguishing between pre-empted and non-pre-emptedclaims based on the particular label affixed to them would
"elevate form over substance and allow parties to evade"the pre-emptive scope of ERISA simply "by relabeling their
contract claims as claims for tortious breach of contract."Allis-Chalmers, supra, at 211. Nor can the mere fact that
the state cause of action attempts to authorize remediesbeyond those authorized by ERISA $ 502(a) put the cause

4 Respondents also argue that ERISA $ 502(a) completely pre-empts a
state cause of action only if the cause of action would be pre-empted under
ERISA $ 514(a); respondents then argue that their causes of action do not
fall under the terms of $ 514(a). But a state cause of action that provides
an alternative remedy to those provided by the ERISA civil enforcement
mechanism conflicts with Congress' clear intent to make the ERISA mechanism exclusive. See Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U. S. 133, 142
(1990) (holding that "[e]ven if there were no express pre-emption [under
ERISA $ 514(a)]" of the cause of action in that case, it "would be preempted because it conflict[ed] directly with an ERISA cause of action").

Opinion of the Court
of action outside the scope of the ERISA civil enforce-ment mechanism. In

Pilot Life, Metropolitan Life, and
Ingersoll-Rand, the plaintiffs all brought state claims thatwere labeled either tort or tort-like. See

Pilot Life, 481
U. S., at 43 (suit for, inter alia, " `Tortious Breach of Con-tract' ");

Metropolitan Life, supra, at 61-62 (suit requesting
damages for "mental anguish caused by breach of [the] contract"); Ingersoll-Rand, 498 U. S., at 136 (suit brought undervarious tort and contract theories). And, the plaintiffs in

these three cases all sought remedies beyond those author-ized under ERISA. See

Pilot Life, supra, at 43 (compensatory and punitive damages); Metropolitan Life, supra, at 61(mental anguish);

Ingersoll-Rand, supra, at 136 (punitive
damages, mental anguish). And, in all these cases, theplaintiffs' claims were pre-empted. The limited remedies

available under ERISA are an inherent part of the "carefulbalancing" between ensuring fair and prompt enforcement
of rights under a plan and the encouragement of the creationof such plans.

Pilot Life, supra, at 55.
Second, the Court of Appeals believed that "the wording
of [respondents'] plans is immaterial" to their claims, as"they invoke an external, statutorily imposed duty of `ordinary care.' " 307 F. 3d, at 309. But as we have already discussed, the wording of the plans is certainly material to their
state causes of action, and the duty of "ordinary care" that
the THCLA creates is not external to their rights under
their respective plans.

Ultimately, the Court of Appeals rested its decision on one
line from Rush Prudential. There, we described our holding in Ingersoll-Rand as follows: "[W]hile state law duplicated the elements of a claim available under ERISA, it converted the remedy from an equitable one under $ 1132(a)(3)
(available exclusively in federal district courts) into a legal
one for money damages (available in a state tribunal)." 536
U. S., at 379. The point of this sentence was to describe why
the state cause of action in Ingersoll-Rand was pre-empted
by ERISA $ 502(a): It was pre-empted because it attempted

216 AETNA HEALTH INC. v. DAVILA

Opinion of the Court
to convert an equitable remedy into a legal remedy. No-where in

Rush Prudential did we suggest that the preemptive force of ERISA $ 502(a) is limited to the situation inwhich a state cause of action precisely duplicates a cause of

action under ERISA $ 502(a).Nor would it be consistent with our precedent to conclude
that only strictly duplicative state causes of action are preempted. Frequently, in order to receive exemplary dam-ages on a state claim, a plaintiff must prove facts beyond

the bare minimum necessary to establish entitlement to anaward. Cf.

Allis-Chalmers, 471 U. S., at 217 (bad-faith refusal to honor a claim needed to be proved in order to re-cover exemplary damages). In order to recover for mental

anguish, for instance, the plaintiffs in Ingersoll-Rand and
Metropolitan Life would presumably have had to prove the
existence of mental anguish; there is no such element in anordinary suit brought under ERISA $ 502(a)(1)(B). See

Ingersoll-Rand, supra, at 136; Metropolitan Life, supra,at 61. This did not save these state causes of action from
pre-emption. Congress' intent to make the ERISA civil enforcement mechanism exclusive would be undermined ifstate causes of action that supplement the ERISA $ 502(a)

remedies were permitted, even if the elements of the statecause of action did not precisely duplicate the elements of an
ERISA claim. C

Respondents also argue--for the first time in their briefto this Court--that the THCLA is a law that regulates insurance, and hence that ERISA $ 514(b)(2)(A) saves their causesof action from pre-emption (and thereby from complete preemption).5 This argument is unavailing. The existence of

5 ERISA $ 514(b)(2)(A), 29 U. S. C. $ 1144(b)(2)(A), reads, as relevant:
"[N]othing in this subchapter shall be construed to exempt or relieve any
person from any law of any State which regulates insurance, banking,
or securities."

Opinion of the Court
a comprehensive remedial scheme can demonstrate an "overpowering federal policy" that determines the interpretation
of a statutory provision designed to save state law from
being pre-empted. Rush Prudential, 536 U. S., at 375.
ERISA's civil enforcement provision is one such example.
See ibid.

As this Court stated in Pilot Life, "our understanding of
[$ 514(b)(2)(A)] must be informed by the legislative intent
concerning the civil enforcement provisions provided by
ERISA $ 502(a), 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a)." 481 U. S., at 52. The
Court concluded that "[t]he policy choices reflected in the
inclusion of certain remedies and the exclusion of others
under the federal scheme would be completely undermined
if ERISA-plan participants and beneficiaries were free to obtain remedies under state law that Congress rejected in
ERISA." Id., at 54. The Court then held, based on

"the common-sense understanding of the saving clause,
the McCarran-Ferguson Act factors defining the business of insurance, and, most importantly, the clear expression of congressional intent that ERISA's civil enforcement scheme be exclusive, . . . that [the plaintiff 's]
state law suit asserting improper processing of a claim
for benefits under an ERISA-regulated plan is not saved
by $ 514(b)(2)(A)." Id., at 57 (emphasis added).

Pilot Life's reasoning applies here with full force. Allowing respondents to proceed with their state-law suits would
"pose an obstacle to the purposes and objectives of Congress." Id., at 52. As this Court has recognized in both
Rush Prudential and Pilot Life, ERISA $ 514(b)(2)(A) must
be interpreted in light of the congressional intent to create
an exclusive federal remedy in ERISA $ 502(a). Under ordinary principles of conflict pre-emption, then, even a state law
that can arguably be characterized as "regulating insurance"
will be pre-empted if it provides a separate vehicle to assert

Opinion of the Court
a claim for benefits outside of, or in addition to, ERISA'sremedial scheme.

IV
Respondents, their amici, and some Courts of Appealshave relied heavily upon

Pegram v. Herdrich, 530 U. S. 211(2000), in arguing that ERISA does not pre-empt or completely pre-empt state suits such as respondents'. Theycontend that Pegram makes it clear that causes of action
such as respondents' do not "relate to [an] employee benefitplan," ERISA $ 514(a), 29 U. S. C. $ 1144(a), and hence are
not pre-empted. See Brief for Respondents 35-38; Cicio v.
Does, 321 F. 3d 83, 100-104 (CA2 2003), cert. pending subnom. Vytra Healthcare v. Cicio, No. 03-69 [

Reporter's
Note: See post, p. 933]; see also Land v. CIGNA Healthcareof Fla., 339 F. 3d 1286, 1292-1294 (CA11 2003).

Pegram cannot be read so broadly. In Pegram, the plain-tiff sued her physician-owned-and-operated HMO (which provided medical coverage through plaintiff 's employer pursu-ant to an ERISA-regulated benefit plan) and her treating
physician, both for medical malpractice and for a breach ofan ERISA fiduciary duty. See 530 U. S., at 215-216. The
plaintiff 's treating physician was also the person chargedwith administering plaintiff 's benefits; it was she who decided whether certain treatments were covered. See id., at228. We reasoned that the physician's "eligibility decision
and the treatment decision were inextricably mixed." Id.,at 229. We concluded that "Congress did not intend [the
defendant HMO] or any other HMO to be treated as a fidu-ciary to the extent that it makes mixed eligibility decisions
acting through its physicians." Id., at 231.A benefit determination under ERISA, though, is generally a fiduciary act. See Bruch, 489 U. S., at 111-113. "Atcommon law, fiduciary duties characteristically attach to decisions about managing assets and distributing property tobeneficiaries."

Pegram, supra, at 231; cf. 2A A. Scott &W. Fratcher, Law of Trusts $$ 182, 183 (4th ed. 1987);

542US1 Unit: $U65 [10-31-06 14:02:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

219Cite as: 542 U. S. 200 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
G. Bogert & G. Bogert, Law of Trusts & Trustees $ 541 (rev.2d ed. 1993). Hence, a benefit determination is part and parcel of the ordinary fiduciary responsibilities connected to theadministration of a plan. See Varity Corp. v. Howe, 516
U. S. 489, 512 (1996) (relevant plan fiduciaries owe a "fidu-ciary duty with respect to the interpretation of plan documents and the payment of claims"). The fact that a benefitsdetermination is infused with medical judgments does not
alter this result.

Pegram itself recognized this principle. Pegram, in high-lighting its conclusion that "mixed eligibility decisions" were

not fiduciary in nature, contrasted the operation of "[t]radi-tional trustees administer[ing] a medical trust" and "physicians through whom HMOs act." 530 U. S., at 231-232. Atraditional medical trust is administered by "paying out
money to buy medical care, whereas physicians makingmixed eligibility decisions consume the money as well."
Ibid. And, significantly, the Court stated that "[p]rivatetrustees do not make treatment judgments."

Id., at 232.
But a trustee managing a medical trust undoubtedly must
make administrative decisions that require the exercise ofmedical judgment. Petitioners are not the employers of respondents' treating physicians and are therefore in a some-what analogous position to that of a trustee for a traditional
medical trust.6

6 Both Pilot Life and Metropolitan Life support this understanding.
The plaintiffs in Pilot Life and Metropolitan Life challenged disability
determinations made by the insurers of their ERISA-regulated employee
benefit plans. See Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41, 43 (1987);
Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U. S. 58, 61 (1987). A disability
determination often involves medical judgments. See, e. g., ibid. (plaintiff
determined not to be disabled only after a medical examination undertaken by one of his employer's physicians). Yet, in both Pilot Life and
Metropolitan Life, the Court held that the causes of action were preempted. Cf. Black & Decker Disability Plan v. Nord, 538 U. S. 822 (2003)
(discussing "treating physician" rule in the context of disability determinations made by ERISA-regulated disability plans).

542US1 Unit: $U65 [10-31-06 14:02:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
220 AETNA HEALTH INC. v. DAVILA

Opinion of the Court
ERISA itself and its implementing regulations confirmthis interpretation. ERISA defines a fiduciary as any person "to the extent . . . he has any discretionary author-ity or discretionary responsibility in the administration of

[an employee benefit] plan. " $ 3(21)(A)(i ii), 29 U. S. C.$ 1002(21)(A)(iii). When administering employee benefit
plans, HMOs must make discretionary decisions regarding
eligibility for plan benefits, and, in this regard, must betreated as plan fiduciaries. See

Varity Corp., supra, at 511
(plan administrator "engages in a fiduciary act when makinga discretionary determination about whether a claimant is

entitled to benefits under the terms of the plan documents").
Also, ERISA $ 503, which specifies minimum requirements
for a plan's claim procedure, requires plans to "afford a reasonable opportunity to any participant whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full and fair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim."
29 U. S. C. $ 1133(2). This strongly suggests that the ultimate decisionmaker in a plan regarding an award of benefits
must be a fiduciary and must be acting as a fiduciary when
determining a participant's or beneficiary's claim. The relevant regulations also establish extensive requirements to ensure full and fair review of benefit denials. See 29 CFR

$ 2560.503-1 (2003). These regulations, on their face, apply
equally to health benefit plans and other plans, and do not
draw distinctions between medical and nonmedical benefits
determinations. Indeed, the regulations strongly imply
that benefits determinations involving medical judgments
are, just as much as any other benefits determinations, actions by plan fiduciaries. See, e. g., $ 2560.503-1(h)(3)(iii).
Classifying any entity with discretionary authority over benefits determinations as anything but a plan fiduciary would
thus conflict with ERISA's statutory and regulatory scheme.

Since administrators making benefits determinations, even
determinations based extensively on medical judgments, are
ordinarily acting as plan fiduciaries, it was essential to Pe542US1 Unit: $U65 [10-31-06 14:02:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

221Cite as: 542 U. S. 200 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
gram's conclusion that the decisions challenged there were
truly "mixed eligibility and treatment decisions," 530 U. S.,
at 229, i. e., medical necessity decisions made by the plaintiff 's treating physician qua treating physician and qua benefits administrator. Put another way, the reasoning of Pegram "only make[s] sense where the underlying negligence
also plausibly constitutes medical maltreatment by a party
who can be deemed to be a treating physician or such a physician's employer." Cicio, 321 F. 3d, at 109 (Calabresi, J.,
dissenting in part). Here, however, petitioners are neither
respondents' treating physicians nor the employers of respondents' treating physicians. Petitioners' coverage decisions, then, are pure eligibility decisions, and Pegram is not
implicated.

V

We hold that respondents' causes of action, brought to
remedy only the denial of benefits under ERISA-regulated
benefit plans, fall within the scope of, and are completely
pre-empted by, ERISA $ 502(a)(1)(B), and thus removable to
federal district court. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cases are remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.7

It is so ordered.

7 The United States, as amicus, suggests that some individuals in respondents' positions could possibly receive some form of "make-whole"
relief under ERISA $ 502(a)(3). Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 27, n. 13. However, after their respective District Courts denied
their motions for remand, respondents had the opportunity to amend their
complaints to bring expressly a claim under ERISA $ 502(a). Respondents declined to do so; the District Courts therefore dismissed their complaints with prejudice. See App. JA-147 to JA-148; id., at JA-298; App.
B to Pet. for Cert. in No. 02-1845, pp. 34a-35a; App. B to Pet. for Cert. in
No. 03-83, p. 40a. Respondents have thus chosen not to pursue any
ERISA claim, including any claim arising under ERISA $ 502(a)(3). The
scope of this provision, then, is not before us, and we do not address it.

Ginsburg, J., concurring
Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Breyer joins,concurring.

The Court today holds that the claims respondents as-serted under Texas law are totally preempted by $ 502(a)
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974(ERISA or Act), 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a). That decision is consistent with our governing case law on ERISA's preemp-tive scope. I therefore join the Court's opinion. But, with
greater enthusiasm, as indicated by my dissenting opinion inGreat-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U. S.
204 (2002), I also join "the rising judicial chorus urging thatCongress and [this] Court revisit what is an unjust and increasingly tangled ERISA regime." DiFelice v. AETNA
U. S. Healthcare, 346 F. 3d 442, 453 (CA3 2003) (Becker, J.,concurring).

Because the Court has coupled an encompassing interpre-tation of ERISA's preemptive force with a cramped construction of the "equitable relief " allowable under $ 502(a)(3),a "regulatory vacuum" exists: "[V]irtually all state law
remedies are preempted but very few federal substitutesare provided." Id., at 456, 457 (internal quotation marks
omitted).

A series of the Court's decisions has yielded a host of sit-uations in which persons adversely affected by ERISAproscribed wrongdoing cannot gain make-whole relief.First, in

Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473
U. S. 134 (1985), the Court stated, in dicta: "[T]here is a starkabsence--in [ERISA] itself and in its legislative history--of

any reference to an intention to authorize the recovery ofextracontractual damages" for consequential injuries.

Id.,
at 148. Then, in Mertens v. Hewitt Associates, 508 U. S. 248(1993), the Court held that $ 502(a)(3)'s term " `equitable relief ' . . . refer[s] to those categories of relief that were typically available in equity (such as injunction, mandamus, and
restitution, but not compensatory damages)." Id., at 256
(emphasis in original). Most recently, in Great-West, the

542US1 Unit: $U65 [10-31-06 14:02:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

223Cite as: 542 U. S. 200 (2004)
Ginsburg, J., concurring
Court ruled that, as "$ 502(a)(3), by its terms, only allows for
equitable relief," the provision excludes "the imposition of
personal liability . . . for a contractual obligation to paymoney." 534 U. S., at 221 (emphasis in original).

As the array of lower court cases and opinions documents,see,

e. g., DiFelice; Cicio v. Does, 321 F. 3d 83 (CA2 2003),
cert. pending sub nom. Vytra Healthcare v. Cicio, No. 03-69
[Reporter's Note: See post, p. 933], fresh consideration ofthe availability of consequential damages under $ 502(a)(3) is

plainly in order. See 321 F. 3d, at 106, 107 (Calabresi, J.,dissenting in part) ("gaping wound" caused by the breadth
of preemption and limited remedies under ERISA, as interpreted by this Court, will not be healed until the Court
"start[s] over" or Congress "wipe[s] the slate clean"); DiFelice, 346 F. 3d, at 467 ("The vital thing . . . is that either
Congress or the Court act quickly, because the current situation is plainly untenable."); Langbein, What ERISA Means
by "Equitable": The Supreme Court's Trail of Error in Russell, Mertens, and Great-West, 103 Colum. L. Rev. 1317, 1365
(2003) (hereinafter Langbein) ("The Supreme Court needs to
. . . realign ERISA remedy law with the trust remedial tradition that Congress intended [when it provided in $ 502(a)(3)
for] `appropriate equitable relief.' ").

The Government notes a potential amelioration. Recognizing that "this Court has construed Section 502(a)(3) not
to authorize an award of money damages against a nonfiduciary," the Government suggests that the Act, as currently written and interpreted, may "allo[w] at least some
forms of `make-whole' relief against a breaching fiduciary in
light of the general availability of such relief in equity at
the time of the divided bench." Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 27-28, n. 13 (emphases added); cf. ante, at
220 ("entity with discretionary authority over benefits determinations" is a "plan fiduciary"); Tr. of Oral Arg. 13 ("Aetna
is [a fiduciary]--and CIGNA is for purposes of claims processing."). As the Court points out, respondents here de542US1 Unit: $U65 [10-31-06 14:02:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

clined the opportunity to amend their complaints to stateclaims for relief under $ 502(a); the District Court, therefore,

properly dismissed their suits with prejudice. See ante, at221, n. 7. But the Government's suggestion may indicate an
effective remedy others similarly circumstanced might fruit-fully pursue.

"Congress . . . intended ERISA to replicate the core prin-ciples of trust remedy law, including the make-whole standard of relief." Langbein 1319. I anticipate that Congress,or this Court, will one day so confirm.

Syllabus

PLILER, WARDEN v. FORD
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 03-221. Argued April 26, 2004--Decided June 21, 2004
Five days before the 1-year statute of limitations under the Antiterrorism

and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) would have run, respondent filed two pro se "mixed" federal habeas petitions--those containing both unexhausted and exhausted claims--and motions to stay
the petitions while he returned to state court to exhaust the unexhausted claims. The Magistrate Judge gave him three options: (1) The
petitions could be dismissed without prejudice and respondent could refile after exhausting the unexhausted claims; (2) the unexhausted claims
could be dismissed and he could proceed with only the exhausted claims;
or (3) he could contest the Magistrate Judge's finding that some claims
were unexhausted. He chose the first option with respect to one petition and failed to respond with respect to the other. The Federal District Court dismissed his petitions without prejudice. He then filed habeas petitions in the California Supreme Court, which were both denied.
The federal court dismissed his subsequently refiled pro se habeas petitions with prejudice as untimely under AEDPA, see 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(d),
and denied him a certificate of appealability (COA). The Ninth Circuit
granted a COA, concluding that his initial petitions were timely under

$ 2244(d) and that his later petitions related back to the initial ones.
The Ninth Circuit determined that although the District Court correctly
concluded that it did not have discretion to stay respondent's mixed
petitions, it could have acted on his stay motions had he chosen the
Magistrate Judge's second option and then renewed the prematurely
filed stay motions. It also held that the District Court had to give
respondent two specific warnings: first, that it could not consider his
motions to stay the mixed petitions unless he chose to amend them and
dismiss the then-unexhausted claims; and second, if applicable, that his
federal claims would be time barred, absent cause for equitable tolling,
upon his return to federal court if he opted to dismiss the petitions
without prejudice and return to state court to exhaust all his claims.

Held: The District Court was not required to provide the warnings directed by the Ninth Circuit. Pp. 230-234.

(a) Federal district courts must dismiss "mixed" habeas petitions.

Syllabus
AEDPA's limitations period is that if a petitioner comes to federal court
with a mixed petition toward the end of the limitations period, a dismissal of his mixed petition could result in the loss of all his claims--
including those already exhausted--because the limitations period could
expire during the time he returns to state court to exhaust his unexhausted claims. To address this, the Ninth Circuit allows a district
court to employ a stay-and-abeyance procedure, which involves
(1) dismissal of any unexhausted claims from the original mixed habeas
petition; (2) a stay of the remaining claims, pending exhaustion of the
dismissed unexhausted claims in state court; and (3) amendment of the
original petition to add the newly exhausted claims that then relate back
to the original petition. Here, the Ninth Circuit held that if a pro se
prisoner files a mixed petition, the district court must give two specific
warnings regarding the stay-and-abeyance procedure. But federal district judges have no obligation to act as counsel or paralegal to pro se
litigants. See, e. g., McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U. S. 168, 183-184. Explaining the details of federal habeas procedure and calculating statutes
of limitations are tasks normally and properly performed by trained
counsel. Requiring district courts to advise pro se litigants in such a
manner would undermine district judges' role as impartial decisionmakers. And the warnings run the risk of being misleading. The first
could encourage the use of stay-and-abeyance when it is not in the petitioner's best interest. The second would force upon judges the potentially burdensome task of making a case-specific calculation of whether
the AEDPA limitations period has already run or will have run by the
time the petitioner returns to federal court. Because such calculations
depend upon information contained in documents that do not necessarily
accompany the petition, a district judge's calculation could be in error
and thereby misinform a pro se petitioner. Respondent's argument
that Rose requires that a prisoner be given "the choice of returning to
state court to exhaust his claims or amending or resubmitting the habeas petition to present only exhausted claims to the district court," 455
U. S., at 510, is unavailing. Rose requires only that a district court
dismiss mixed petitions, which, as a practical matter, means that the
prisoner must follow one of these two paths if he wants to proceed with
his federal petition. Nothing in Rose requires that both options be
equally attractive, or that district judges give specific advisements as
to the availability and wisdom of these options. Respondent's reliance
on Castro v. United States, 540 U. S. 375, is misplaced, because Castro
dealt with a District Court's sua sponte recharacterization of a prisoner's pleading and did not address whether a district court is required
to explain a pro se litigant's options before a voluntary dismissal.

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
Under Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509 (1982), federal districtcourts must dismiss "mixed" habeas corpus petitions--those

containing both unexhausted and exhausted claims. In thiscase, we decide whether the District Court erred by dismissing, pursuant to Rose, a pro se habeas petitioner's two habeaspetitions without giving him two particular advisements.
Because we hold that the District Court's failure to providethese warnings did not make the dismissals improper, we
need not address the second question presented, whether re-spondent's subsequent untimely petitions relate back to his
"improperly dismissed" initial petitions.

two pro se federal habeas corpus petitions. The first peti-tion related to respondent's conviction for, among other
things, conspiring to murder John Loguercio and attemptingto murder Loguercio's wife; the second related to his conviction for the first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit themurder of Thomas Weed. Because the petitions contained
unexhausted claims, respondent also filed motions to stay thepetitions so that he could return to state court to exhaust
the unexhausted claims. The Magistrate Judge gave re-spondent three options: (1) The petitions could be dismissed
without prejudice and respondent could refile after exhaust-ing the unexhausted claims; (2) the unexhausted claims could
be dismissed and respondent could proceed with only the ex-hausted claims; or (3) respondent could contest the Magistrate Judge's finding that some of the claims had not beenexhausted. App. 51-52; 81-82.

With respect to his petition in the Loguercio case, re-spondent chose the first option. With respect to the Weed
case, respondent failed to respond to the Magistrate Judge.The District Court dismissed respondent's petitions without
prejudice. In both cases, respondent proceeded by filing ha-beas corpus petitions in the California Supreme Court, which
were both summarily denied. Respondent subsequently re-filed his

pro se habeas petitions in Federal District Court.The District Court, in both cases, dismissed the petitions

with prejudice as untimely under AEDPA's 1-year statuteof limitations, 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(d), and denied respondent's
motions for a certificate of appealability (COA). The NinthCircuit consolidated respondent's motions for a COA, and
then granted a COA on the question whether his federal ha-beas petitions were timely under $ 2244(d). A divided panel

Opinion of the Court
concluded that both of respondent's initial federal habeas pe-titions were timely filed and held that his later petitions related back to the initial petitions. Ford v. Hubbard, 330F. 3d 1086, 1097 (2003).

Although the District Court correctly concluded that it didnot have discretion to stay respondent's mixed petitions, see
Rose, supra, at 522, the Ninth Circuit determined that the
District Court could have acted on the stay motions if re-spondent had chosen the Magistrate Judge's second option--

dismissal of the unexhausted claims--and then renewed theprematurely filed stay motions. Under the Ninth Circuit's
view, the District Court was obligated to advise respondent
that it could consider his stay motions only if he chose this
route. 330 F. 3d, at 1099. The District Court's failure to
inform respondent was, according to the Court of Appeals,
prejudicial error because it deprived respondent of a "fair
and informed opportunity to have his stay motions heard, to
exhaust his unexhausted claims, and ultimately to have his
claims considered on the merits." Id., at 1100.

The District Court also committed prejudicial error, according to the Ninth Circuit, for failing to inform respondent
that AEDPA's 1-year statute of limitations had run on both
of his petitions and that, consequently, he would be barred
from refiling his petitions in federal court if he failed to
amend them or if he chose to dismiss the petitions without
prejudice in order to exhaust the unexhausted claims.
Under the Court of Appeals' view, the District Court "definitively, although not intentionally," misled respondent by
telling him that if he chose the first option, the dismissal
would be without prejudice. Ibid. The Court of Appeals
concluded that respondent should have been told that, because AEDPA's statute of limitations had run with respect
to his claims, a dismissal without prejudice would effectively
result in a dismissal with prejudice unless equitable tolling
applied. Id., at 1101. According to the Court of Appeals,
the District Court's error in this regard deprived respondent

of the opportunity to make a "meaningful" choice betweenthe two options. Id., at 1102.

1 We granted certiorari, 540

U. S. 1099 (2004). II

Under Rose, federal district courts must dismiss mixed ha-beas petitions. 455 U. S., at 510, 522. Subsequent to the
Court's decision in Rose, Congress enacted AEDPA, whichimposed a 1-year statute of limitations for filing a federal
habeas corpus petition. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(d)(1). Thecombined effect of Rose and AEDPA's limitations period is
that if a petitioner comes to federal court with a mixed peti-tion toward the end of the limitations period, a dismissal of
his mixed petition could result in the loss of all of hisclaims--including those already exhausted--because the limitations period could expire during the time a petitioner re-turns to state court to exhaust his unexhausted claims. To
address this, the Ninth Circuit has held that a district courtmay employ a stay-and-abeyance procedure. See

Calderonv. United States Dist. Court for Northern Dist. of Cal. ex rel.

Taylor, 134 F. 3d 981, 988 (1998). The stay-and-abeyanceprocedure involves three steps: first, dismissal of any unexhausted claims from the original mixed habeas petition; sec-ond, a stay of the remaining claims, pending exhaustion of
the dismissed unexhausted claims in state court; and third,amendment of the original petition to add the newly ex1 Finding it impossible to put respondent in the position he had occupied
prior to the District Court's "erroneous dismissal" of his initial petitions,
the Ninth Circuit concluded that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)'s
amendment procedures apply to "ensure that [respondent's] rights are not
unduly prejudiced as a result of the district court's errors." 330 F. 3d, at
1102. Accordingly, it held that "a pro se habeas petitioner who files a
mixed petition that is improperly dismissed by the district court, and who
then . . . returns to state court to exhaust his unexhausted claims and
subsequently re-files a second petition without unreasonable delay," may
have his second petition relate back to the initial timely petition. Ibid.
As explained above, we need not address whether the Ninth Circuit's decision on this ground was correct.

Opinion of the Court
hausted claims that then relate back to the original petition.
Id., at 986.

In this case, the Ninth Circuit held that if a pro se prisonerfiles a mixed petition, the district court must give two specific warnings regarding the stay-and-abeyance procedure:first, that "it would not have the power to consider [a prisoner's] motions to stay the [mixed] petitions unless he opted to
amend them and dismiss the then-unexhausted claims," 330F. 3d, at 1092-1093, and, second, if applicable, "that [a prisoner's] federal claims would be time-barred, absent cause forequitable tolling, upon his return to federal court if he opted
to dismiss the petitions `without prejudice' and return to
state court to exhaust all of his claims," id., at 1093.

Without addressing the propriety of this stay-andabeyance procedure, we hold that federal district judges are
not required to give pro se litigants these two warnings.
District judges have no obligation to act as counsel or paralegal to pro se litigants. In McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U. S.
168, 183-184 (1984), the Court stated that "[a] defendant does
not have a constitutional right to receive personal instruction from the trial judge on courtroom procedure" and that
"the Constitution [does not] require judges to take over
chores for a pro se defendant that would normally be attended to by trained counsel as a matter of course." See
also Martinez v. Court of Appeal of Cal., Fourth Appellate
Dist., 528 U. S. 152, 162 (2000) ("[T]he trial judge is under no
duty to provide personal instruction on courtroom procedure
or to perform any legal `chores' for the defendant that counsel would normally carry out"). Explaining the details of
federal habeas procedure and calculating statutes of limitations are tasks normally and properly performed by trained
counsel as a matter of course. Requiring district courts to
advise a pro se litigant in such a manner would undermine
district judges' role as impartial decisionmakers. And, to
the extent that respondent is concerned with a district
court's potential to mislead pro se habeas petitioners, the

542US1 Unit: $U66 [10-25-06 14:07:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
warnings respondent advocates run the risk of being mis-leading themselves.

Specifically, the first warning could encourage the use ofstay-and-abeyance when it is not in the petitioner's best interest to pursue such a course. This could be the case, forexample, where the petitioner's unexhausted claims are particularly weak and petitioner would therefore be better off
proceeding only with his exhausted claims. And it is certainly the case that not every litigant seeks to maximize judicial process.

The second advisement would force upon district judges
the potentially burdensome, time-consuming, and factintensive task of making a case-specific investigation and calculation of whether the AEDPA limitations period has already run or will have run by the time the petitioner returns
to federal court. As the dissent below recognized, district
judges often will not be able to make these calculations
based solely on the face of habeas petitions. 330 F. 3d, at
1108. Such calculations depend upon information contained
in documents that do not necessarily accompany the petitions. This is so because petitioners are not required by 28
U. S. C. $ 2254 or the Rules Governing $ 2254 Cases to attach
to their petitions, or to file separately, state-court records.2
See 1 R. Hertz & J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure $ 15.2c, p. 711 (4th ed. 2001) ("Most petitioners do not have the ability to submit the record with
the petition, and the statute and rules relieve them of any
obligation to do so and require the state to furnish the record
with the answer"). District judges, thus, might err in their

2 There is one circumstance where nonindigent petitioners must furnish
the court with portions of the record. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(f) ("If the
applicant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence . . . to support the
State court's determination of a factual issue . . . , the applicant, if able,
shall produce that part of the record pertinent to a determination of the
sufficiency of the evidence"; "[i]f the applicant, because of indigency or
other reason is unable to produce such part of the record," a court must
direct the State to produce it).

Opinion of the Court
calculation of the statute of limitations and affirmatively mis-inform

pro se petitioners of their options.
Respondent nevertheless argues that the advisements arenecessary to ensure that

pro se petitioners make informed
decisions and do not unknowingly forfeit rights. Brief forRespondent 27-32. Respondent reads

Rose as mandating
that "a prisoner be given `the choice of returning to state
court to exhaust his claims or amending or resubmitting thehabeas petition to present only exhausted claims to the district court.' " Brief for Respondent 25-26, 27 (quoting Rose,455 U. S., at 510) (emphasis in brief). But

Rose requires
only that "a district court must dismiss . . . `mixed petitions,'leaving the prisoner with the choice" described above.

Ibid.
In other words, Rose requires dismissal of mixed petitions,which, as a practical matter, means that the prisoner must

follow one of the two paths outlined in Rose if he wants toproceed with his federal habeas petition. But nothing in
Rose requires that both of these options be equally attrac-tive, much less suggests that district judges give specific advisements as to the availability and wisdom of these options.
As such, any advisement of this additional option wouldnot "simply implement what this Court

already requires."
Brief for Respondent 27 (emphasis in original).

Respondent also relies heavily upon Castro v. United
States, 540 U. S. 375 (2003). In Castro, we held that a federal district court cannot sua sponte recharacterize a pro se
litigant's motion as a first $ 2255 motion unless it informs
the litigant of the consequences of the recharacterization,
thereby giving the litigant the opportunity to contest the
recharacterization, or to withdraw or amend the motion.
Id., at 377. Castro dealt with a District Court, of its own
volition, taking away a petitioner's desired route--namely, a
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 motion--and transforming it, against his will, into a $ 2255 motion. Cf. id., at
386 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ("Recharacterization . . . requires a court deliberately
to override the pro se litigant's choice of procedural vehicle

234 PLILER v. FORD

O'Connor, J., concurring
for his claim"). We recognized that although this practice isoften used to help

pro se petitioners, it could also harm them.
Id., at 381-382. Because of these competing considerations,we reasoned that the warning would "help the

pro se litigant
understand . . . whether he should withdraw or amend hismotion [and] whether he should

contest the recharacterization." Id., at 384 (emphasis in original). Castro, then, did
not address the question whether a district court is requiredto explain to a

pro se litigant his options before a voluntary
dismissal and its reasoning sheds no light on the questionwe confront.

Therefore, we hold that district courts are not required togive the particular advisements required by the Ninth Circuit before dismissing a pro se petitioner's mixed habeas pe-tition under

Rose. We remand the case for further proceedings given the Court of Appeals' concern that respondenthad been affirmatively misled quite apart from the District

Court's failure to give the two warnings.For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of
Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice O'Connor, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion because it is limited to the nar-row question whether the notifications crafted by the Ninth

Circuit must be given.

The propriety of the stay-and-abeyance procedure generally is not addressed. The District Court did not employ
that procedure, nor did the Ninth Circuit hold that it must
be applied in every case. There is, therefore, no need for us
to pass on it in this case, and the Court properly avoids doing
so. I note, however, that the procedure is not an idiosyncratic one; as Justice Breyer describes, post, at 239 (dissenting opinion), seven of the eight Circuits to consider it
have approved stay-and-abeyance as an appropriate exercise
of a district court's equitable powers.

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
For the reasons given by the majority, ante, at 232-233, itis not incumbent upon a district court to establish whether

the statute of limitations has already run before explainingthe options available to a habeas petitioner who has filed a
mixed petition. Nevertheless, if the petitioner is affirma-tively misled, either by the court or by the State, equitable
tolling might well be appropriate. This is a question for theNinth Circuit to consider on remand. See

ante, at 234.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter joins, con-curring in the judgment.

While I fully agree with the views expressed by Justice
Ginsburg, post this page, and Justice Breyer, post, p. 237(dissenting opinions), I am persuaded that the judgment entered by the Court--remanding to the Ninth Circuit to de-termine the propriety of equitable tolling--is both consistent
with those views and correct. I therefore concur in thatjudgment.

Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Breyer joins,dissenting.
The three options the Magistrate Judge gave respondent,see

ante, at 228, did not include the three-step stay and abey-ance procedure described ante, at 230-231. Under that procedure: (1) unexhausted claims are dismissed from the fed-eral petition; (2) exhausted claims are retained in federal
court, but are stayed pending exhaustion in state court ofthe dismissed unexhausted claims; and (3) postexhaustion in
state court, the original federal petition is amended to rein-state the now exhausted claims, which are then deemed to
relate back to the initial filing.1 The Court today does not"addres[s] the propriety of this stay-and-abeyance proce1 The Ninth Circuit here allowed relation back of amendments although
no pleading remained before the federal court. See ante, at 230, n. 1. In
contrast, under the stay and abeyance procedure, the original habeas petition, although shorn of unexhausted claims, remains pending in federal
court, albeit stayed.

dure." Ante, at 231. But that unaddressed issue seems to
me pivotal. If the stay and abeyance procedure was a choice
respondent could have made, then the Magistrate Judge
erred in failing to inform respondent of that option. While
I do not suggest that clear statement of the options available
to respondent must be augmented by "advisements," ante,
at 234, I would not defer, as the Court does, the question at
the core of this case.2

Furthermore, as this Court recognizes, ante, at 228, respondent filed his habeas petitions "five days before [the termination of AEDPA's] 1-year statute of limitations." Thus,
any new petition by respondent would have been time barred
even before the Magistrate Judge dismissed respondent's
original petitions. Given that undisputed fact, the Magistrate Judge's characterization of the dismissal orders as
"without prejudice" seems to me highly misleading.

Because the Court disposes of this case without confronting the above-described ripe issues, I dissent. Although my
reasons differ from those stated in the Ninth Circuit's opinion, I would affirm the Ninth Circuit's judgment to the ex2 A related question also postponed by the Court's opinion is whether
the solution in Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509 (1982), to a mixed petition--
dismissal without prejudice--bears reexamination in light of the one-year
statute of limitations imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death
Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), on the time to file federal habeas petitions.
See Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 182-183 (2001) (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ("[A]lthough the Court's preAEDPA decision in Rose v. Lundy prescribed the dismissal of federal habeas corpus petitions containing unexhausted claims, in our post-AEDPA
world there is no reason why a district court should not retain jurisdiction
over a meritorious claim and stay further proceedings pending the complete exhaustion of state remedies." (citation omitted)); Crews v. Horn,
360 F. 3d 146, 154, and n. 5 (CA3 2004) (holding that both exhausted and
unexhausted claims "should be stayed," and noting that a stay, "as effectively as a dismissal, . . . is a traditional way to defer to another court
until that court has had an opportunity to exercise its jurisdiction over a
habeas petition's unexhausted claims" (internal quotation marks omitted)).

tent that it vacated the District Court's dismissal of Ford's
second petitions.

Justice Breyer, dissenting.
I join Justice Ginsburg's dissent. But I write separately to "addres[s] the propriety of " the Ninth Circuit's
"stay-and-abeyance procedure. " Ante, at 231 (majority
opinion). That procedure would have permitted Richard
Ford, the respondent, to ask the federal court to stay proceedings and hold his federal habeas petition (in abeyance)
on its docket while he returned to state court to exhaust his
unexhausted federal claims. Thus Ford would not have had
to bring his federal petition again, after expiration of the
1-year limitations period. California's courts thereby could
have considered his unexhausted claims without forcing him
to forfeit his right to ask a federal court for habeas relief.

What could be unlawful about this procedure? In Rose v.
Lundy, 455 U. S. 509 (1982), the Court, pointing to considerations of comity, held that federal habeas courts must give
state courts a first crack at deciding an issue. Id., at 518-
519. It prohibited the federal courts from considering unexhausted claims. The Court added that, where a habeas petition is "mixed" (containing both exhausted and unexhausted
claims), the federal habeas court should dismiss the petition.
Id., at 520. Rose reassured those prisoners (typically acting
pro se), however, that the dismissal would not "unreasonably
impair the prisoner's right to relief." Id., at 522. That reassurance made sense at that time because the law did not
then put a time limit on refiling. It thereby permitted a
prisoner to return to federal court after he had exhausted
his state remedies. Id., at 520. Of course, the law prohibits
a prisoner from "abusing the writ," but ordinarily a petitioner's dismissal of his mixed petition, his presenting unexhausted claims to the state courts, and his subsequent return
to federal court would not have constituted an abuse.

238 PLILER v. FORD

Breyer, J., dissenting
Fourteen years after Rose, Congress enacted the Antiter-rorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).

AEDPA imposed a 1-year statute of limitations for filing ahabeas petition. 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(d)(1). One might have
thought at first blush that the 1-year limitations periodwould not make much practical difference where an
exhaustion-based dismissal of a mixed petition was at issue,
for AEDPA tolls the limitations period while "a properlyfiled application for State post-conviction or other collateral

review . . . is pending." $ 2244(d)(2). In Duncan v. Walker,533 U. S. 167, 181-182 (2001), however, this Court held that
the words "other collateral review" do not cover a federal
habeas proceeding. And that fact means that a pro se habeas petitioner who mistakenly files a mixed petition in federal court may well find that he has no time to get to state
court and back before his year expires. Hence, after Duncan, the dismissal of such a petition will not simply give state
courts a chance to consider the unexhausted issues he raises;
it often also means the permanent end of any federal habeas
review. Ante, at 230; see also Duncan, supra, at 186, 191
(Breyer, J., dissenting) (citing statistics that 93% of habeas
petitioners are pro se; 63% of all habeas petitions are dismissed; 57% of those are dismissed for failure to exhaust;
and district courts took an average of nearly nine months to
dismiss petitions on procedural grounds). Indeed, in this
very case--a not atypical scenario--the limitations period
expired while the petition was pending before the District
Court.

I dissented in Duncan, arguing that Congress could not
have intended to cause prisoners to lose their habeas rights
under these circumstances. 533 U. S., at 190. Although the
majority reached a different conclusion, it did so primarily
upon the basis of the statute's language. See id., at 172-178.

Accepting the majority's view of that language, I nonetheless believe that the other considerations that I raised in
Duncan support the lawfulness of the Ninth Circuit's stay542US1 Unit: $U66 [10-25-06 14:07:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

and-abeyance procedure. That procedure recognizes thecomity interests that

Rose identified, and it reconciles those
interests with the longstanding constitutional interest inmaking habeas corpus available to state prisoners. There is

no tension between the two. It is thus not surprising thatnearly every circuit has adopted a similar procedure.

E. g.,
Crews v. Horn, 360 F. 3d 146, 152 (CA3 2004) ("[V]irtually
every other Circuit that has considered this issue has heldthat, following AEDPA, while it usually is within a district

court's discretion to determine whether to stay or dismiss amixed petition, staying the petition is the only appropriate
course of action where an outright dismissal could jeopardize
the timeliness of a collateral attack" (internal quotation
marks omitted)); Nowaczyk v. Warden, 299 F. 3d 69, 79 (CA1
2002); Palmer v. Carlton, 276 F. 3d 777, 781 (CA6 2002); Zarvela v. Artuz, 254 F. 3d 374, 381 (CA2 2001); Freeman v.
Page, 208 F. 3d 572, 577 (CA7 2000); Brewer v. Johnson, 139
F. 3d 491, 493 (CA5 1998); cf. Mackall v. Angelone, 131 F. 3d
442, 445 (CA4 1997); but cf. Akins v. Kenney, 341 F. 3d 681,
685-686 (CA8 2003) (refusing to stay mixed petitions). See
also Duncan, 533 U. S., at 182-183 (Stevens, J., concurring
in part and concurring in judgment) ("[T]here is no reason
why a district court should not retain jurisdiction over a
meritorious claim and stay further proceedings pending the
complete exhaustion of state remedies"); id., at 192 (Breyer,
J., dissenting) (noting "Justice Stevens' sound suggestions
that district courts hold mixed petitions in abeyance").

I recognize that the Duncan majority also noted the importance of respecting AEDPA's goals of "comity, finality,
and federalism." Id., at 178 (internal quotation marks omitted). But I do not see how the Ninth Circuit's procedure
could significantly undermine those goals. It is unlikely to
mean that prisoners will increasingly file mixed petitions.
A petitioner who believes that he is wrongly incarcerated
would not deliberately file a petition with unexhausted
claims in the wrong (i. e., federal) court, for that error would

simply prolong proceedings. Those under a sentence ofdeath might welcome delays, but in such cases deliberate

misfiling would risk a finding that the filer has abused thewrit and a consequent judicial refusal to hold the petition in
abeyance. Moreover, a habeas court may fashion a stay toprevent abusive delays; for example, by providing a time
limit within which a prisoner must exhaust state-court reme-dies. See,

e. g., Zarvela, supra, at 381.Nor does the Ninth Circuit procedure seriously undermine

AEDPA's 1-year limitations period. That provision re-quires a prisoner to file a federal habeas petition with at
least one exhausted claim within the 1-year period, and itprohibits the habeas petitioner from subsequently including
any new claim. These requirements remain.Given the importance of maintaining a prisoner's access to
a federal habeas court and the comparatively minor interfer-ence that the Ninth Circuit's procedure creates with comity
or other AEDPA concerns, I would find use of the stay-and-abeyance procedure legally permissible. I also believe
that the Magistrate Judge should have informed Ford of thisimportant rights-preserving option. See

ante, at 236 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). For these reasons, I respectfullydissent.

INTEL CORP. v. ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 02-572. Argued April 20, 2004--Decided June 21, 2004
In 1964, pursuant to a recommendation by the Commission on International Rules of Judicial Procedure (Rules Commission), and as part of
an endeavor to improve judicial assistance between the United States
and foreign countries, Congress completely revised 28 U. S. C. $ 1782(a).
In its current form, $ 1782(a) provides that a federal district court "may
order" a person residing or found in the district to give testimony or
produce documents "for use in a proceeding in a foreign or international
tribunal . . . upon the application of any interested person." The 1964
overhaul of $ 1782(a) deleted the prior law's words, "in any judicial proceeding pending in any court in a foreign country." (Emphasis added.)

Respondent Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), filed an antitrust complaint against petitioner Intel Corporation (Intel) with the
Directorate-General for Competition (DG-Competition) of the Commission of the European Communities (Commission), alleging that Intel had
violated European competition law. After the DG-Competition declined AMD's recommendation to seek documents Intel had produced in
a private antitrust suit in an Alabama federal court, AMD petitioned
the District Court for the Northern District of California under $ 1782(a)
for an order directing Intel to produce those documents. The District
Court concluded that $ 1782(a) did not authorize such discovery. The
Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded with instructions to rule on the
application's merits. The appeals court observed that $ 1782(a) includes
matters before bodies of a quasi-judicial or administrative nature, and,
since 1964, has contained no limitation to foreign proceedings that are
"pending." A proceeding judicial in character, the Ninth Circuit noted,
was a likely sequel to the Commission investigation. The Court of Appeals rejected Intel's argument that $ 1782(a) called for a threshold
showing that the documents AMD sought, if located in the European
Union, would have been discoverable in the Commission investigation.
Nothing in $ 1782(a)'s language or legislative history, the Ninth Circuit
said, required a "foreign-discoverability" rule of that order.

Held: Section 1782(a) authorizes, but does not require, the District Court

to provide discovery aid to AMD. Pp. 254-266.

1. To provide context, the Court summarizes how the Commission,
acting through the DG-Competition, enforces European competition

Syllabus
laws. Upon receiving a complaint, or sua sponte, the DG-Competition
conducts a preliminary investigation into alleged violations of those
laws. The DG-Competition may consider information provided by a
complainant, and it may seek information from a complaint's target.
The DG-Competition's investigation results in a formal written decision
whether to pursue the complaint. If the DG-Competition decides not
to proceed, its decision may be reviewed by the Court of First Instance
and, ultimately, the Court of Justice for the European Communities (European Court of Justice). When the DG-Competition pursues a complaint, it typically serves the investigation's target with a formal "statement of objections" and advises the target of its intention to recommend
a decision finding an antitrust violation. The target is entitled to a
hearing before an independent officer, who provides a report to the DGCompetition. Once the DG-Competition makes its recommendation,
the Commission may dismiss the complaint or issue a decision holding
the target liable and imposing penalties. The Commission's final action
is subject to review in the Court of First Instance and the European
Court of Justice. Lacking formal "litigant" status in Commission proceedings, a complainant nonetheless has significant procedural rights.
Important here, a complainant may submit relevant information to the
DG-Competition and seek judicial review of the Commission's disposition. Pp. 254-255.

2. Section 1782(a)'s language, confirmed by its context, warrants the
conclusion that the provision authorizes, but does not require, a federal
district court to provide assistance to a complainant in a Commission
proceeding that leads to a dispositive ruling. The Court therefore
rejects the categorical limitations Intel would place on the statute's
reach. Pp. 255-263.

(a) A complainant before the Commission, such as AMD, qualifies
as an "interested person" within $ 1782(a)'s compass. The Court rejects
Intel's contention that "interested person[s]" does not include complainants, but encompasses only litigants, foreign sovereigns, and a sovereign's designated agents. To support its reading, Intel highlights

$ 1782's caption, "[a]ssistance to foreign and international tribunals and
to litigants before such tribunals." (Emphasis added.) A statute's
caption, however, cannot undo or limit its text's plain meaning. Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 331 U. S. 519, 529. Section 1782(a)
plainly reaches beyond the universe of persons designated "litigant."
With significant participation rights in Commission proceedings, the
complainant qualifies as an "interested person" within any fair construction of that term. Pp. 256-257.

(b) The assistance AMD seeks meets $ 1782(a)'s specification "for
use in a foreign or international tribunal." The Commission qualifies

Syllabus
as a "tribunal" when it acts as a first-instance decisionmaker. Both the
Court of First Instance and the European Court of Justice are tribunals,
but not proof-takers. Their review is limited to the record before the
Commission. Hence, AMD could "use" evidence in those reviewing
courts only by submitting it to the Commission in the current, investigative stage. In adopting the Rules Commission's recommended replacement of the term "any judicial proceeding" with the words
"a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal," Congress opened
the way for judicial assistance in foreign administrative and quasijudicial proceedings. This Court has no warrant to exclude the Commission, to the extent that it acts as a first-instance decisionmaker, from

$ 1782(a)'s ambit. Pp. 257-258.

(c) The "proceeding" for which discovery is sought under $ 1782(a)
must be within reasonable contemplation, but need not be "pending"
or "imminent." The Court rejects Intel's argument that the Commission investigation launched by AMD's complaint does not qualify for

$ 1782(a) assistance. Since the 1964 revision, which deleted the prior
law's reference to "pending," Congress has not limited judicial assistance under $ 1782(a) to "pending" adjudicative proceedings. This Court
presumes that Congress intends its statutory amendments to have real
and substantial effect. Stone v. INS, 514 U. S. 386, 397. The 1964 revision's legislative history corroborates Congress' recognition that judicial
assistance would be available for both foreign proceedings and investigations. A 1996 amendment clarifies that $ 1782(a) covers "criminal investigations conducted before formal accusation." Nothing in that
amendment, however, suggests that Congress meant to rein in, rather
than to confirm, by way of example, the range of discovery $ 1782(a)
authorizes. Pp. 258-259.

(d) Section 1782(a) does not impose a foreign-discoverability requirement. Although $ 1782(a) expressly shields from discovery matters protected by legally applicable privileges, nothing in $ 1782(a)'s text
limits a district court's production-order authority to materials discoverable in the foreign jurisdiction if located there. Nor does the legislative
history suggest that Congress intended to impose a blanket foreigndiscoverability rule on $ 1782(a) assistance. The Court rejects two policy concerns raised by Intel in support of a foreign-discoverability limitation on $ 1782(a) aid--avoiding offense to foreign governments, and
maintaining parity between litigants. While comity and parity concerns may be legitimate touchstones for a district court's exercise of
discretion in particular cases, they do not warrant construction of

$ 1782(a)'s text to include a generally applicable foreign-discoverability
rule. Moreover, the Court questions whether foreign governments
would be offended by a domestic prescription permitting, but not requir542US1 Unit: $U67 [10-31-06 13:57:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
ing, judicial assistance. A foreign nation may limit discovery within its
domain for reasons peculiar to its own legal practices, culture, or traditions; such reasons do not necessarily signal objection to aid from United
States federal courts. A foreign tribunal's reluctance to order production of materials present in the United States similarly may signal no
resistance to the receipt of evidence gathered pursuant to $ 1782(a).
When the foreign tribunal would readily accept relevant information
discovered in the United States, application of a categorical foreigndiscoverability rule would be senseless. Concerns about parity among
adversaries in litigation likewise provide no sound basis for a cross-theboard foreign-discoverability rule. When information is sought by an
"interested person," a district court can condition relief upon reciprocal
information exchange. Moreover, the foreign tribunal can place conditions on its acceptance of information, thereby maintaining whatever
measure of parity it deems appropriate. The Court also rejects Intel's
suggestion that a $ 1782(a) applicant must show that United States law
would allow discovery in domestic litigation analogous to the foreign
proceeding. Section 1782 is a provision for assistance to tribunals
abroad. It does not direct United States courts to engage in comparative analysis to determine whether analogous proceedings exist here.
Comparisons of that order can be fraught with danger. For example,
the United States has no close analogue to the Commission regime,
under which AMD lacks party status and can participate only as a complainant. Pp. 259-263.

3. Whether $ 1782(a) assistance is appropriate in this case is yet unresolved. To guide the District Court on remand, the Court notes factors
relevant to that question. First, when the person from whom discovery
is sought is a participant in the foreign proceeding, as Intel is here, the
need for $ 1782(a) aid generally is not as apparent as it ordinarily is
when evidence is sought from a nonparticipant in the matter arising
abroad. A foreign tribunal has jurisdiction over those appearing before
it, and can itself order them to produce evidence. In contrast, nonparticipants in foreign proceedings may be outside the foreign tribunal's
jurisdictional reach; thus, their evidence, available in the United States,
may be unobtainable absent $ 1782(a) aid. Second, a court presented
with a $ 1782(a) request may consider the nature of the foreign tribunal,
the character of proceedings underway abroad, and the receptivity of
the foreign government, court, or agency to federal-court judicial assistance. Further, the grounds Intel urged for categorical limitations on

$ 1782(a)'s scope may be relevant in determining whether a discovery
order should be granted in a particular case. Specifically, a district
court could consider whether the $ 1782(a) request conceals an attempt
to circumvent foreign proof-gathering limits or other policies of a for542US1 Unit: $U67 [10-31-06 13:57:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
eign country or the United States. Also, unduly intrusive or burdensome requests may be rejected or trimmed. The Court declines, at this
juncture, Intel's suggestion that it exercise its supervisory authority to
adopt rules barring $ 1782(a) discovery here. Any such endeavor
should await further experience with $ 1782(a) applications in the lower
courts. Several facets of this case remain largely unexplored. While
Intel and its amici are concerned that granting AMD's application in
any part may yield disclosure of confidential information, encourage
"fishing expeditions," and undermine the Commission's program offering prosecutorial leniency for admissions of wrongdoing, no one has suggested that AMD's complaint to the Commission is pretextual. Nor has
it been shown that $ 1782(a)'s preservation of legally applicable privileges and the controls on discovery available under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 26(b)(2) and (c) would be ineffective to prevent discovery
of Intel's confidential information. The Court leaves it to the courts
below, applying closer scrutiny, to ensure an airing adequate to determine what, if any, assistance is appropriate. Pp. 264-266.

Assistant Attorney General Katsas, Michael Jay Singer,and Sushma Soni.*

Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case concerns the authority of federal district courtsto assist in the production of evidence for use in a foreign or

international tribunal. In the matter before us, respondentAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), filed an antitrust complaint against petitioner Intel Corporation (Intel) with theDirectorate-General for Competition (DG-Competition) of
the Commission of the European Communities (EuropeanCommission or Commission). In pursuit of that complaint,
AMD applied to the United States District Court for theNorthern District of California, invoking 28 U. S. C.

$ 1782(a), for an order requiring Intel to produce potentiallyrelevant documents. Section 1782(a) provides that a federal
district court "may order" a person "resid[ing]" or "found"in the district to give testimony or produce documents "for
use in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal . . .upon the application of any interested person."

Concluding that $ 1782(a) did not authorize the requesteddiscovery, the District Court denied AMD's application.
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed thatdetermination and remanded the case, instructing the District Court to rule on the merits of AMD's application. Inaccord with the Court of Appeals, we hold that the District
Court had authority under $ 1782(a) to entertain AMD's dis-covery request. The statute, we rule, does not categorically
bar the assistance AMD seeks: (1) A complainant before theEuropean Commission, such as AMD, qualifies as an "interested person" within $ 1782(a)'s compass; (2) the Commis-sion is a $ 1782(a) "tribunal" when it acts as a first-instance

but need not be "pending" or "imminent"; and (4) $ 1782(a)contains no threshold requirement that evidence sought from

that $ 1782(a) authorizes, but does not require, a federal dis-trict court to provide judicial assistance to foreign or international tribunals or to "interested person[s]" in proceedingsabroad. Whether such assistance is appropriate in this case
is a question yet unresolved. To guide the District Courton remand, we suggest considerations relevant to the disposition of that question. I

A
Section 1782 is the product of congressional efforts, overthe span of nearly 150 years, to provide federal-court assistance in gathering evidence for use in foreign tribunals.Congress first provided for federal-court aid to foreign tribunals in 1855; requests for aid took the form of letters roga-tory forwarded through diplomatic channels. See Act of
Mar. 2, 1855, ch. 140, $ 2, 10 Stat. 630 (circuit court may ap-point "a United States commissioner designated . . . to make
the examination of witnesses" on receipt of a letter rogatoryfrom a foreign court); Act of Mar. 3, 1863, ch. 95, $ 1, 12 Stat.
769 (authorizing district courts to respond to letters rogatoryby compelling witnesses here to provide testimony for use
abroad in "suit[s] for the recovery of money or property").1In 1948, Congress substantially broadened the scope of as1 "[A] letter rogatory is the request by a domestic court to a foreign
court to take evidence from a certain witness." Jones, International Judicial Assistance: Procedural Chaos and a Program for Reform, 62 Yale L. J.

States Code, 65 Colum. L. Rev. 1015, 1027 (1965) (hereinafter Smit, International Litigation) (noting foreign courts' use of letters rogatory to request evidence-gathering aid from United States courts).

sistance federal courts could provide for foreign proceedings.That legislation, codified as $ 1782, eliminated the prior requirement that the government of a foreign country be aparty or have an interest in the proceeding. The measure
allowed district courts to designate persons to preside atdepositions "to be used in any civil action pending in any
court in a foreign country with which the United States isat peace." Act of June 25, 1948, ch. 646, $ 1782, 62 Stat. 949

Chaos and a Program for Reform, 62 Yale L. J. 515 (1953).In 1958, prompted by the growth of international commerce, Congress created a Commission on InternationalRules of Judicial Procedure (Rules Commission) to "investigate and study existing practices of judicial assistance andcooperation between the United States and foreign countries
with a view to achieving improvements." Act of Sept. 2,Pub. L. 85-906, $ 2, 72 Stat. 1743; S. Rep. No. 2392, 85th

Act of Oct. 3, Pub. L. 88-619, $ 9, 78 Stat. 997; Smit, Interna-tional Litigation 1026-1035.

As recast in 1964, $ 1782 provided for assistance in obtain-ing documentary and other tangible evidence as well as testimony. Notably, Congress deleted the words "in any judicialproceeding

Congress further amended $ 1782(a) in 1996 to add, after thereference to "foreign or international tribunal," the words
"including criminal investigations conducted before formalaccusation." National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 1996, Pub. L. 104-106, $ 1342(b), 110 Stat. 486. Section1782(a)'s current text reads:

Opinion of the Court

B
AMD and Intel are "worldwide competitors in the microprocessor industry." 292 F. 3d 664, 665 (CA9 2002). In October 2000, AMD filed an antitrust complaint with the DGCompetition of the European Commission. Ibid.; App. 41.
"The European Commission is the executive and administrative organ of the European Communities." Brief for Commission of European Communities as Amicus Curiae 1
(hereinafter European Commission Amicus Curiae). The
Commission exercises responsibility over the wide range of
subject areas covered by the European Union treaty; those
areas include the treaty provisions, and regulations thereunder, governing competition. See ibid.; Consolidated Versions of Treaty on European Union and Treaty Establishing
European Community, Arts. 81 and 82, 2002 O. J. (C 325) 33,
64-65, 67 (hereinafter EC Treaty). The DG-Competition,
operating under the Commission's aegis, is the European
Union's primary antitrust law enforcer. European Commission Amicus Curiae 2. Within the DG-Competition's domain are anticompetitive agreements (Art. 81) and abuse
of dominant market position (Art. 82). Ibid.; EC Treaty

Cert. 13a-14a.4 After the DG-Competition declined to seek
judicial assistance in the United States, AMD, pursuant to

$ 1782(a), petitioned the District Court for the Northern District of California 5 for an order directing Intel to produce
documents discovered in the Intergraph litigation and on file
in the federal court in Alabama. App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a-
14a. AMD asserted that it sought the materials in connection with the complaint it had filed with the European
Commission. Ibid.6

The District Court denied the application as "[un]supported by applicable authority." Id., at 15a. Reversing
that determination, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit remanded the case for disposition on the merits. 292
F. 3d, at 669. The Court of Appeals noted two points significant to its decision: $ 1782(a) includes matters before
" `bodies of a quasi-judicial or administrative nature,' " id., at

F. 2d 1216, 1218-1219 (CA9 1976)); and, since 1964, the statute's text has contained "[no] requirement that the proceeding be `pending,' " 292 F. 3d, at 667 (quoting United States v.

the Alabama federal court, governs the confidentiality of all discovery in
that case. App. 72-73.

California. Id., at 113.

6 AMD's complaint to the Commission alleges, inter alia, "that Intel has

monopolized the worldwide market for Windows-capable i. e. x86, microprocessors." Id., at 55-56. The documents from the Intergraph litigation relate to: "(a) the market within which Intel x86 microprocessors compete; (b) the power that Intel enjoys within that market; (c) actions taken
by Intel to preserve and enhance its position in the market; and (d) the
impact of the actions taken by Intel to preserve and enhance its market
position." App. 55.

Opinion of the Court
Deputy Prosecutor Gen. of Russian Federation, 235 F. 3d1200, 1204 (CA9 2000)); see

supra, at 248-249. A proceeding
judicial in character, the Ninth Circuit further observed, wasa likely sequel to the European Commission's investigation:

"[The European Commission is] a body authorized to enforcethe EC Treaty with written, binding decisions, enforceable
through fines and penalties. [The Commission's] decisions
are appealable to the Court of First Instance and then tothe [European] Court of Justice. Thus, the proceeding for

which discovery is sought is, at minimum, one leading toquasi-judicial proceedings." 292 F. 3d, at 667; see

infra, at
254-255 (presenting synopsis of Commission proceedings and
judicial review of Commission decisions).

The Court of Appeals rejected Intel's argument that

$ 1782(a) called for a threshold showing that the documents
AMD sought in the California federal court would have been
discoverable by AMD in the European Commission investigation had those documents been located within the Union.
292 F. 3d, at 668. Acknowledging that other Courts of
Appeals had construed $ 1782(a) to include a "foreigndiscoverability" rule, the Ninth Circuit found "nothing in the
plain language or legislative history of Section 1782, including its 1964 and 1996 amendments, to require a threshold
showing [by] the party seeking discovery that what is sought
be discoverable in the foreign proceeding," id., at 669. A
foreign-discoverability threshold, the Court of Appeals
added, would disserve $ 1782(a)'s twin aims of "providing efficient assistance to participants in international litigation
and encouraging foreign countries by example to provide
similar assistance to our courts." Ibid.

On remand, a Magistrate Judge found AMD's application
"overbroad," and recommended an order directing AMD to
submit a more specific discovery request confined to documents directly relevant to the European Commission investigation. App. to Brief in Opposition 1a-6a; Brief for Petitioner 15, n. 9. The District Court has stayed further

We granted certiorari, 540 U. S. 1003 (2003), in view of
the division among the Circuits on the question whether$ 1782(a) contains a foreign-discoverability requirement.

We now hold that $ 1782(a) does not impose such a require-ment. We also granted review on two other questions.

First, does $ 1782(a) make discovery available to complain-ants, such as AMD, who do not have the status of private
"litigants" and are not sovereign agents? See Pet. for Cert.(i). Second, must a "proceeding" before a foreign "tribunal"
be "pending" or at least "imminent" for an applicant to in-voke $ 1782(a) successfully? Compare

870 F. 2d 686, 691 (CADC 1989) (proceeding must be "within
reasonable contemplation"), with In re Ishihari Chemical

International Judicial Assistance (Letter Rogatory) for
Federative Republic of Brazil, 936 F. 2d 702, 706 (CA2 1991)

7 The First and Eleventh Circuits have construed $ 1782(a) to contain a
foreign-discoverability requirement. See In re Application of Asta Medica, S. A., 981 F. 2d 1, 7 (CA1 1992); In re Request for Assistance from
Ministry of Legal Affairs of Trinidad and Tobago, 848 F. 2d 1151, 1156
(CA11 1988). The Fourth and Fifth Circuits have held that no such requirement exists if the $ 1782(a) applicant is a foreign sovereign. See
In re Letter of Request from Amtsgericht Ingolstadt, F. R. G., 82 F. 3d

To place this case in context, we sketch briefly how theEuropean Commission, acting through the DG-Competition,

enforces European competition laws and regulations. TheDG-Competition's "overriding responsibility" is to conduct
investigations into alleged violati ons of the EuropeanUnion's competition prescriptions. See European Commission Amicus Curiae 6. On receipt of a complaint or sua
sponte, the DG-Competition conducts a preliminary investi-gation. Ibid. In that investigation, the DG-Competition

"may take into account information provided by a complain-ant, and it may seek information directly from the target of
the complaint." Ibid. "Ultimately, DG Competition's pre-liminary investigation results in a formal written decision
whether to pursue the complaint. If [the DG-Competition]declines to proceed, that decision is subject to judicial review" by the Court of First Instance and, ultimately, by thecourt of last resort for European Union matters, the Court
of Justice for the European Communities (European Courtof Justice).

Id., at 7; App. 50; see, e. g., Case T-241/97, StorkAmsterdam BV v. Commission, 2000 E. C. R. II-309, [2000]

5 C. M. L. R. 31 (Ct. 1st Instance 2000) (annulling Commis-sion's rejection of a complaint).

8

If the DG-Competition decides to pursue the complaint, ittypically serves the target of the investigation with a formal

"statement of objections" and advises the target of its in-tention to recommend a decision finding that the target has
violated European competition law. European Commission

8 The Court of First Instance, which is "attached to the [European]
Court of Justice," was established "to improve the judicial protection of
individual interests, particularly in cases requiring the examination of
complex facts, whilst at the same time reducing the workload of the [European] Court of Justice." C. Kerse, E. C. Antitrust Procedure 37 (3d ed.

As "in all statutory construction cases, we begin [our ex-amination of $ 1782] with the language of the statute."
Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U. S. 438, 450 (2002). Thelanguage of $ 1782(a), confirmed by its context, our examination satisfies us, warrants this conclusion: The statute au-thorizes, but does not require, a federal district court to provide assistance to a complainant in a European Commissionproceeding that leads to a dispositive ruling,

i. e., a final ad-ministrative action both responsive to the complaint and reviewable in court.9 Accordingly, we reject the categoricallimitations Intel would place on the statute's reach.

9 The dissent suggests that the Commission "more closely resembles a
prosecuting authority, say, the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division,
than an administrative agency that adjudicates cases, say, the Federal
Trade Commission." Post, at 270. That is a questionable suggestion in
view of the European Commission's authority to determine liability and
impose penalties, dispositions that will remain final unless overturned by
the European courts. See supra this page.

256 INTEL CORP. v. ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.

Opinion of the Court

A
We turn first to Intel's contention that the catalog of "in-terested person[s]" authorized to apply for judicial assistance

under $ 1782(a) includes only "litigants, foreign sovereigns,and the designated agents of those sovereigns," and excludes
AMD, a mere complainant before the Commission, accordedonly "limited rights." Brief for Petitioner 10-11, 24, 26-27.
Highlighting $ 1782's caption, "[a]ssistance to foreign and in-ternational tribunals and to

litigants before such tribunals,"Intel urges that the statutory phrase "any interested person"

should be read, correspondingly, to reach only "litigants."
Id., at 24 (internal quotation marks omitted, emphasis inoriginal).

The caption of a statute, this Court has cautioned, "cannotundo or limit that which the [statute's] text makes plain."
Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 331 U. S. 519, 529(1947). The text of $ 1782(a), "upon the application of any
interested person," plainly reaches beyond the universe ofpersons designated "litigant." No doubt litigants are included among, and may be the most common example of,the "interested person[s]" who may invoke $ 1782; we read

$ 1782's caption to convey no more. See, e. g., Whitman v.
American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 482-483(2001) (rejecting narrow reading of 42 U. S. C. $ 7511(a) based

on caption in light of "specifically" broader coverage of pro-vision's text).

The complainant who triggers a European Commission in-vestigation has a significant role in the process. As earlier
observed, see supra, at 255, in addition to prompting an in-vestigation, the complainant has the right to submit information for the DG-Competition's consideration, and mayproceed to court if the Commission discontinues the investigation or dismisses the complaint. App. 52-53. Giventhese participation rights, a complainant "possess[es] a reasonable interest in obtaining [ judicial] assistance," andtherefore qualifies as an "interested person" within any fair
construction of that term. See Smit, International Litiga542US1 Unit: $U67 [10-31-06 13:57:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tion 1027 ("any interested person" is "intended to include notonly litigants before foreign or international tribunals, but

also foreign and international officials as well as any otherperson whether he be designated by foreign law or international convention or merely possess a reasonable interest inobtaining the assistance").

10

B
We next consider whether the assistance in obtaining doc-uments here sought by an "interested person" meets the

specification "for use in a foreign or international tribunal."Beyond question the reviewing authorities, both the Court
of First Instance and the European Court of Justice, qualifyas tribunals. But those courts are not proof-taking instances. Their review is limited to the record before theCommission. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 17. Hence, AMD could
"use" evidence in the reviewing courts only by submitting itto the Commission in the current, investigative stage.

Moreover, when Congress established the Commission onInternational Rules of Judicial Procedure in 1958, see

supra,at 248, it instructed the Rules Commission to recommend

10 The term "interested person," Intel notes, also appears in 28 U. S. C.

$ 1696(a), a provision enacted concurrently with the 1964 revision of $ 1782.
Brief for Petitioner 27. Section 1696(a) authorizes federal district courts
to "order service . . . of any document issued in connection with a [foreign]
proceeding" pursuant to a request made by the foreign tribunal "or upon
application of any interested person." Intel reasons that "[t]he class of
private parties qualifying as `interested persons' for [service] purposes
must of course be limited to litigants, because private parties . . . cannot
serve `process' unless they have filed suit." Brief for Petitioner 27 (emphasis in original). Section 1696(a), however, is not limited to service of
process; it allows service of "any document" issued in connection with a
foreign proceeding. As the Government points out by way of example:
"[I]f the European Commission's procedures were revised to require a
complainant to serve its complaint on a target company, but the complainant's role in the Commission's proceedings otherwise remained unchanged,
[$ ]1696 would authorize the district court to provide that `interested [person]' with assistance in serving that document." Brief for United States

procedural revisions "for the rendering of assistance to for-eign courts and quasi-judicial agencies." $ 2, 72 Stat. 1743

(emphasis added). Section 1782 had previously referred to"any judicial proceeding." The Rules Commission's draft,
which Congress adopted, replaced that term with "a proceed-ing in a foreign or international tribunal." See supra, at
248-249. Congress understood that change to "provid[e]the possibility of U. S. judicial assistance in connection with
[administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings abroad]."S. Rep. No. 1580, at 7-8; see Smit, International Litigation
1026-1027, and nn. 71, 73 ("[t]he term `tribunal' . . . includesinvestigating magistrates, administrative and arbitral tribunals, and quasi-judicial agencies, as well as conventional civil,commercial, criminal, and administrative courts"; in addition
to affording assistance in cases before the European Courtof Justice, $ 1782, as revised in 1964, "permits the rendition
of proper aid in proceedings before the [European] Commis-sion in which the Commission exercises quasi-judicial powers"). See also European Commission Amicus Curiae 9("[W]hen the Commission acts on DG Competition's final recommendation . . . the investigative function blur[s] into deci-sionmaking."). We have no warrant to exclude the European Commission, to the extent that it acts as a first-instancedecisionmaker, from $ 1782(a)'s ambit. See 292 F. 3d, at 667;
supra, at 255, n. 9. C

Intel also urges that AMD's complaint has not progressedbeyond the investigative stage; therefore, no adjudicative action is currently or even imminently on the Commission'sagenda. Brief for Petitioner 27-29.

Section 1782(a) does not limit the provision of judicial as-sistance to "pending" adjudicative proceedings. In 1964,
when Congress eliminated the requirement that a proceed-ing be "judicial," Congress also deleted the requirement that
a proceeding be "pending." See supra, at 248-249. "When

Congress acts to amend a statute, we presume it intends itsamendment to have real and substantial effect." Stone v.

INS, 514 U. S. 386, 397 (1995). The legislative history of the1964 revision is in sync; it reflects Congress' recognition that
judicial assistance would be available "whether the foreignor international proceeding or investigation is of a criminal,
civil, administrative, or other nature." S. Rep. No. 1580, at9 (emphasis added).

In 1996, Congress amended $ 1782(a) to clarify that thestatute covers "criminal investigations conducted before formal accusation." See $ 1342(b), 110 Stat. 486; supra, at 249.Nothing suggests that this amendment was an endeavor to
rein in, rather than to confirm, by way of example, the broadrange of discovery authorized in 1964. See S. Rep. No. 1580,
at 7 ("[T]he [district] court[s] have discretion to grant assist-ance when proceedings are pending before investigating
magistrates in foreign countries.").In short, we reject the view, expressed in

In re Ishihara
Chemical Co., that $ 1782 comes into play only when adjudi-cative proceedings are "pending" or "imminent." See 251

F. 3d, at 125 (proceeding must be "imminent--very likelyto occur and very soon to occur" (internal quotation marks
omitted)). Instead, we hold that $ 1782(a) requires only thata dispositive ruling by the Commission, reviewable by the
European courts, be within reasonable contemplation. SeeCrown Prosecution Serv. of United Kingdom, 870 F. 2d, at
691; In re Request for Assistance from Ministry of LegalAffairs of Trinidad and Tobago, 848 F. 2d 1151, 1155, and
n. 9 (CA11 1988); Smit, International Litigation 1026 ("It isnot necessary . . . for the [adjudicative] proceeding to be

district court from ordering production of documents whenthe foreign tribunal or the "interested person" would not be

able to obtain the documents if they were located in the for-eign jurisdiction? See

supra, at 253-254, and n. 7.
We note at the outset, and count it sig nificant, that$ 1782(a) expressly shields privileged material: "A person

may not be compelled to give his testimony or statement or
to produce a document or other thing in violation of any le-gally applicable privilege." See S. Rep. No. 1580, at 9 ("[N]o

person shall be required under the provisions of [$ 1782] toproduce any evidence in violation of an applicable privilege."). Beyond shielding material safeguarded by an appli-cable privilege, however, nothing in the text of $ 1782 limits
a district court's production-order authority to materials thatcould be discovered in the foreign jurisdiction if the materials were located there. "If Congress had intended to imposesuch a sweeping restriction on the district court's discretion,
at a time when it was enacting liberalizing amendments to
the statute, it would have included statutory language to
that effect." In re Application of Gianoli Aldunate, 3 F. 3d
54, 59 (CA2 1993); accord Four Pillars Enterprises Co. v.
Avery Dennison Corp., 308 F. 3d 1075, 1080 (CA9 2002); 292
F. 3d, at 669 (case below); In re Bayer AG, 146 F. 3d 188,
193-194 (CA3 1998).11

Nor does $ 1782(a)'s legislative history suggest that Congress intended to impose a blanket foreign-discoverability
rule on the provision of assistance under $ 1782(a). The Senate Report observes in this regard that $ 1782(a) "leaves the
issuance of an appropriate order to the discretion of the court

11 Section 1782(a) instructs that a district court's discovery order "may
prescribe the practice and procedure, which may be in whole or part the
practice and procedure of the foreign country or the international tribunal,
for taking the testimony or statement or producing the document or other
thing . . . [or may be] the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure." This modeof-proof-taking instruction imposes no substantive limitation on the discovery to be had.

which, in proper cases, may refuse to issue an order or mayimpose conditions it deems desirable." S. Rep. No. 1580,

at 7.Intel raises two policy concerns in support of a foreigndiscoverability limitation on $ 1782(a) aid--avoiding offenseto foreign governments, and maintaining parity between litigants. Brief for Petitioner 23-24; Reply Brief 5, 13-14; see
In re Application of Asta Medica, S. A., 981 F. 2d 1, 6 (CA11992) ("Congress did not seek to place itself on a collision

course with foreign tribunals and legislatures, which havecarefully chosen the procedures and laws best suited to their
concepts of litigation."). While comity and parity concernsmay be important as touchstones for a district court's exercise of discretion in particular cases, they do not permit ourinsertion of a generally applicable foreign-discoverability
rule into the text of $ 1782(a).We question whether foreign governments would in fact
be offended by a domestic prescription permitting, but notrequiring, judicial assistance. A foreign nation may limit
discovery within its domain for reasons peculiar to its ownlegal practices, culture, or traditions--reasons that do not
necessarily signal objection to aid from United States federalcourts. See

Bayer, 146 F. 3d, at 194 ("[T]here is no reason toassume that because a country has not adopted a particular

discovery procedure, it would take offense at its use."); Smit,Recent Developments in International Litigation, 35 S. Tex.

12 A foreign tribunal's reluctance to order

12 Most civil-law systems lack procedures analogous to the pretrial discovery regime operative under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See

Opinion of the Court
production of materials present in the United States simi-larly may signal no resistance to the receipt of evidence gathered pursuant to $ 1782(a). See South Carolina Ins. Co. v.Assurantie Maatschappij "De Zeven Provincien" N. V.,
[1987] 1 App. Cas. 24 (House of Lords ruled that nondis-coverability under English law did not stand in the way of a
litigant in English proceedings seeking assistance in theUnited States under $ 1782).

13 When the foreign tribunal

would readily accept relevant information discovered in theUnited States, application of a foreign-discoverability rule

would be senseless. The rule in that situation would serveonly to thwart $ 1782(a)'s objective to assist foreign tribunals
in obtaining relevant information that the tribunals may finduseful but, for reasons having no bearing on international
comity, they cannot obtain under their own laws.Concerns about maintaining parity among adversaries in
litigation likewise do not provide a sound basis for a cross-the-board foreign-discoverability rule. When information is
sought by an "interested person," a district court could con-dition relief upon that person's reciprocal exchange of information. See Euromepa, S. A. v. R. Esmerian, Inc., 51 F. 3d1095, 1102 (CA2 1995); Smit, Recent Developments 237.
Moreover, the foreign tribunal can place conditions on itsacceptance of the information to maintain whatever measure
of parity it concludes is appropriate. See Euromepa, 51F. 3d, at 1101.

Opinion of the Court
We also reject Intel's suggestion that a $ 1782(a) applicant
must show that United States law would allow discovery

in domestic litigation analogous to the foreign proceeding.
Brief for Petitioner 19-20 ("[I]f AMD were pursuing this
matter in the United States, U. S. law would preclude it from
obtaining discovery of Intel's documents."). Section 1782 is
a provision for assistance to tribunals abroad. It does not
direct United States courts to engage in comparative analysis to determine whether analogous proceedings exist here.
Comparisons of that order can be fraught with danger.15
For example, we have in the United States no close analogue
to the European Commission regime under which AMD is
not free to mount its own case in the Court of First Instance
or the European Court of Justice, but can participate only as
complainant, an "interested person," in Commission-steered
proceedings. See L. Ritter, W. Braun, & F. Rawlinson, European Competition Law: A Practitioner's Guide 824-826
(2d ed. 2000) (describing a complaint as a potentially "more
certain (and cheaper) alternative to private enforcement
through the [European Union's member states'] courts").16

upon only in its decision on the merits." Smit, Recent Developments 235-
236, n. 94.

15 Among its proposed rules, the dissent would exclude from $ 1782(a)'s

reach discovery not available "under foreign law" and "under domestic
law in analogous circumstances." Post, at 270. Because comparison of
systems is slippery business, the dissent's rule is infinitely easier to state
than to apply. As the dissent's examples tellingly reveal, see post, at 267-
268, a foreign proceeding may have no direct analogue in our legal system.
In light of the variety of foreign proceedings resistant to ready classification in domestic terms, Congress left unbounded by categorical rules the
determination whether a matter is proceeding "in a foreign or international tribunal." While we reject the rules the dissent would inject into
the statute, see post, at 269-273, we do suggest guides for the exercise of
district-court discretion, see infra, at 264-266.

we could have brought a private action in the district court for these very
same violations. In Europe, our only Europe-wide remedy was to go to

Opinion of the Court

IV
As earlier emphasized, see supra, at 260-261, a districtcourt is not required to grant a $ 1782(a) discovery application simply because it has the authority to do so. See
United Kingdom v. United States, 238 F. 3d 1312, 1319 (CA112001) ("a district court's compliance with a $ 1782 request is

not mandatory"). We note below factors that bear consider-ation in ruling on a $ 1782(a) request.

First, when the person from whom discovery is sought isa participant in the foreign proceeding (as Intel is here), the
need for $ 1782(a) aid generally is not as apparent as it ordi-narily is when evidence is sought from a nonparticipant in
the matter arising abroad. A foreign tribunal has jurisdic-tion over those appearing before it, and can itself order them
to produce evidence. App. to Reply Brief 4a ("When th[e]person [who is to produce the evidence] is a party to the
foreign proceedings, the foreign or international tribunal canexercise its own jurisdiction to order production of the evidence." (quoting declaration of H. Smit in In re: Application
of Ishihara Chemical Co., Ltd., For order to take discoveryof Shipley Company, L. L. C., Pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 1782,

Misc. 99-232 (FB) (EDNY, May 18, 2000))). In contrast,nonparticipants in the foreign proceeding may be outside the
foreign tribunal's jurisdictional reach; hence, their evidence,available in the United States, may be unobtainable absent

$ 1782(a) aid. See App. to Reply Brief 4a.Second, as the 1964 Senate Report suggests, a court presented with a $ 1782(a) request may take into account thenature of the foreign tribunal, the character of the proceedings underway abroad, and the receptivity of the foreigngovernment or the court or agency abroad to U. S. federalcourt judicial assistance. See S. Rep. No. 1580, at 7. Fur-ther, the grounds Intel urged for categorical limitations on

$ 1782(a)'s scope may be relevant in determining whether adiscovery order should be granted in a particular case. See
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23. Specifically,

542US1 Unit: $U67 [10-31-06 13:57:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN

265Cite as: 542 U. S. 241 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
a district court could consider whether the $ 1782(a) requestconceals an attempt to circumvent foreign proof-gathering

restrictions or other policies of a foreign country or theUnited States. See id., at 27. Also, unduly intrusive or
burdensome requests may be rejected or trimmed. SeeBayer, 146 F. 3d, at 196 (remanding for district-court consideration of "appropriate measures, if needed, to protect theconfidentiality of materials");

In re Application of Esses, 101F. 3d 873, 876 (CA2 1996) (affirming limited discovery that is

neither "burdensome [n]or duplicative").Intel maintains that, if we do not accept the categorical
limitations it proposes, then, at least, we should exercise oursupervisory authority to adopt rules barring $ 1782(a) discovery here. Brief for Petitioner 34-36; cf. Thomas v. Arn, 474U. S. 140, 146-147 (1985) (this Court can establish rules of
"sound judicial practice" (internal quotation marks omitted)).We decline, at this juncture, to adopt supervisory rules.
Any such endeavor at least should await further experiencewith $ 1782(a) applications in the lower courts.

17 The European Commission has stated in amicus curiae briefs to thisCourt that it does not need or want the District Court's assistance. See European Commission Amicus Curiae 11-16;Brief for European Commission as

Amicus Curiae in Sup17 The dissent sees a need for "categorical limits" to ward off "expensive,
time-consuming battles about discovery." Post, at 268. That concern
seems more imaginary than real. There is no evidence whatsoever, in the
40 years since $ 1782(a)'s adoption, see supra, at 248, of the costs, delays,
and forced settlements the dissent hypothesizes. See Smit, American Assistance 1, 19-20 ("The revised section 1782 . . . has been applied in scores
of cases. . . . All in all, Section 1782 has largely served the purposes for
which it was enacted. . . . [T]here appears to be no reason for seriously
considering, at this time, any statutory amendments.").

The Commission, we note, is not obliged to respond to a discovery request of the kind AMD has made. The party targeted in the complaint
and in the $ 1782(a) application would no doubt wield the laboring oar in
opposing discovery, as Intel did here. Not only was there no "need for
the Commission to respond," post, at 271, the Commission in fact made no
submission at all in the instant matter before it reached this Court.

port of Pet. for Cert. 4-8. It is not altogether clear, however, whether the Commission, which may itself invoke

$ 1782(a) aid, means to say "never" or "hardly ever" to judicial assistance from United States courts. Nor do we know
whether the European Commission's views on $ 1782(a)'s utility are widely shared in the international community by entities with similarly blended adjudicative and prosecutorial
functions.

Several facets of this case remain largely unexplored.
Intel and its amici have expressed concerns that AMD's application, if granted in any part, may yield disclosure of confidential information, encourage "fishing expeditions," and

Curiae 11-16.18 Yet no one has suggested that AMD's complaint to the Commission is pretextual. Nor has it been
shown that $ 1782(a)'s preservation of legally applicable privileges, see supra, at 260, and the controls on discovery available to the District Court, see, e. g., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.
26(b)(2) and (c), would be ineffective to prevent discovery of
Intel's business secrets and other confidential information.

On the merits, this case bears closer scrutiny than it has
received to date. Having held that $ 1782(a) authorizes, but
does not require, discovery assistance, we leave it to the
courts below to ensure an airing adequate to determine
what, if any, assistance is appropriate.19

Breyer, J., dissenting

* * *
For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Ap-peals for the Ninth Circuit is

Affirmed.
Justice O'Connor took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.

Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment.
As today's opinion shows, the Court's disposition is re-quired by the text of the statute. None of the limitations

urged by petitioner finds support in the categorical languageof 28 U. S. C. $ 1782(a). That being so, it is not only (as I
think) improper but also quite unnecessary to seek repeatedsupport in the words of a Senate Committee Report--which,
as far as we know, not even the full committee, much lessthe full Senate, much much less the House, and much much
much less the President who signed the bill, agreed with.Since, moreover, I have not read the entire so-called legislative history, and have no need or desire to do so, so far as Iknow the statements of the Senate Report may be contradicted elsewhere.

Accordingly, because the statute--the only sure expres-sion of the will of Congress--says what the Court says it

says, I join in the judgment.

Justice Breyer, dissenting.
The Court reads the scope of 28 U. S. C. $ 1782 to extend
beyond what I believe Congress might reasonably have in-tended. Some countries allow a private citizen to ask a

court to review a criminal prosecutor's decision not to prose-cute. On the majority's reading, that foreign private citizen
could ask an American court to help the citizen obtain infor-mation, even if the foreign prosecutor were indifferent or
unreceptive. See, e. g., Mann, Criminal Procedure, in Introduction to the Law of Israel 267, 278 (A. Shapira & K.

DeWitt-Arar eds. 1995). Many countries allow court reviewof decisions made by any of a wide variety of nonprosecutorial, nonadjudicative bodies. On the majority's reading, aBritish developer, hoping to persuade the British Housing
Corporation to grant it funding to build a low-income housingdevelopment, could ask an American court to demand that
an American firm produce information designed to help the
developer obtain the British grant. Cf., e. g., Mayer, TheHousing Corporation: Multiple Lines of Accountability, in

Quangos, Accountability and Reform: The Politics of Quasi-Government 111, 114 (M. Flinders & M. Smith eds. 1999).
This case itself suggests that an American firm, hoping to
obtain information from a competitor, might file an antitrust
complaint with the European antitrust authorities, thereby
opening up the possibility of broad American discovery--
contrary to the antitrust authorities' desires.

One might ask why it is wrong to read the statute as permitting the use of America's court processes to obtain information in such circumstances. One might also ask why
American courts should not deal case by case with any problems of the sort mentioned. The answer to both of these
questions is that discovery and discovery-related judicial
proceedings take time, they are expensive, and cost and
delay, or threats of cost and delay, can themselves force parties to settle underlying disputes. See The Brookings Institution, Justice For All: Reducing Costs and Delay in Civil
Litigation, Report of a Task Force 6-7 (1989) (lawyers surveyed estimated that 60% of litigation costs in a typical federal case are attributable to discovery and agreed that high
litigation costs are often attributable to abuse of the discovery process); Federal Judicial Center, T. Willging, J. Shapard,
D. Stienstra, & D. Miletich, Discovery and Disclosure Practice, Problems, and Proposals for Change 1-2, 4, 8, 14-16 (Tables 3-5) (1997) (study outlining costs of discovery). To the
extent that expensive, time-consuming battles about discovery proliferate, they deflect the attention of foreign authori542US1 Unit: $U67 [10-31-06 13:57:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
ties from other matters those authorities consider more im-portant; they can lead to results contrary to those that

foreign authorities desire; and they can promote disharmonyamong national and international authorities, rather than the
harmony that $ 1782 seeks to achieve. They also use up do-mestic judicial resources and crowd our dockets.

That is why I believe the statute, while granting district
courts broad authority to order discovery, nonetheless mustbe read as subject to some categorical limits, at least at the

outer bounds--a matter that today's decision makes evenmore important. Those limits should rule out instances in
which it is virtually certain that discovery (if considered case
by case) would prove unjustified.

This case does not require us to find a comprehensive set
of limits. But it does suggest two categorical limitations,
which I would adopt. First, when a foreign entity possesses
few tribunal-like characteristics, so that the applicability of
the statute's word "tribunal" is in serious doubt, then a court
should pay close attention to the foreign entity's own view of
its "tribunal"-like or non-"tribunal"-like status. By paying
particular attention to the views of the very foreign nations
that Congress sought to help, courts would better achieve
Congress' basic cooperative objectives in enacting the statute. See Act of Sept. 2, 1958, Pub. L. 85-906, $ 2, 72 Stat.
1743 (creating Commission on International Rules of Judicial
Procedure to investigate and improve judicial "cooperation"
between the United States and other countries).

The concept of paying special attention to administrative
views is well established in American law. Cf. Chevron
U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467
U. S. 837, 843 (1984); Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134,
140 (1944). Like American administrators, foreign administrators are likely to understand better than American courts
their own job and, for example, how discovery rights might
affect their ability to carry out their responsibilities. I can
think of no reason why Congress would have intended a

270 INTEL CORP. v. ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.

Breyer, J., dissenting
court to pay less attention to the foreign entity's view ofthe matter than courts ordinarily pay to a domestic agency's

understanding of the workings of its own statute.Second, a court should not permit discovery where both of
the following are true: (1) A private person seeking discov-ery would not be entitled to that discovery under foreign
law, and (2) the discovery would not be available under domestic law in analogous circumstances. The Federal Rulesof Civil Procedure, for example, make only limited provisions

for nonlitigants to obtain certain discovery. See Fed. RuleCiv. Proc. 27. The limitations contained in the Rules help
to avoid discovery battles launched by firms simply seeking
information from competitors. Where there is benefit in
permitting such discovery, and the benefit outweighs the cost
of allowing it, one would expect either domestic law or foreign law to authorize it. If, notwithstanding the fact that it
would not be allowed under either domestic or foreign law,
there is some special need for the discovery in a particular
instance, one would expect to find foreign governmental or
intergovernmental authorities making the case for that need.
Where none of these circumstances is present, what benefit
could offset the obvious costs to the competitor and to our
courts? I cannot think of any.

Application of either of these limiting principles would require dismissal of this discovery proceeding. First, the
Commission of the European Communities' (Commission) antitrust authority's status as a "tribunal" is questionable. In
many respects, the Commission more closely resembles a
prosecuting authority, say, the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division, than an administrative agency that adjudicates cases, say, the Federal Trade Commission. To my
knowledge, those who decide whether to bring an antitrust
prosecution on the Commission's behalf are not judges. See

Prosecutorial Function and the Adjudicative Function in EC

Ibid. Nor, as the majority appears to recognize, does thelater availability of a reviewing court matter where "review

whether the Commission is a "tribunal" is unclear. See
Wils, supra, at 207-209 (noting the scholarly and legal debate
as to whether the Commission's antitrust investigation and
enforcement activities qualify it as an " `independent and impartial tribunal' " for purposes of the European Convention
on Human Rights).

At the same time, the Commission has told this Court that
it is not a "tribunal" under the Act. It has added that,
should it be considered, against its will, a "tribunal," its
"ability to carry out its governmental responsibilities" will
be seriously threatened. Brief for Commission of the European Communities as Amicus Curiae 2. Given the potential
need for the Commission to respond when a private firm (including an American company) files a complaint with the
Commission and seeks discovery in an American court (say,
from a competitor), its concerns are understandable.

The Commission's characterization of its own functions is,
in my view, entitled to deference. The majority disregards
the Commission's opinion and states categorically that "the
Commission is a $ 1782(a) `tribunal' when it acts as a firstinstance decisionmaker." Ante, at 246-247. In so ignoring

respect to Europe, the Commission has told us that any per-son in the world is free to file a complaint with the Commission, but it is the Commission that then investigates. The
private complainant lacks any authority to obtain discovery
of business secrets and commercial information. See Brief
for Commission of the European Communities as Amicus
Curiae 13, and n. 15. In respect to the United States, AMD
is a nonlitigant, apart from this discovery proceeding. Conditions under which a nonlitigant may obtain discovery are
limited. AMD does not suggest that it meets those conditions, or that it is comparable in any other way to one who
might obtain discovery under roughly analogous circumstances. In addition, the material it seeks is under a protective order. See ante, at 251, n. 4.

What is the legal source of these limiting principles? In
my view, they, and perhaps others, are implicit in the statute
itself, given its purpose and use of the terms "tribunal" and
"interested person." $ 1782(a). But even if they are not,
this Court's "supervisory powers . . . permit, at the least, the

TENNARD v. DRETKE, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPART-MENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, CORRECTIONAL

INSTITUTIONS DIVISION
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 02-10038. Argued March 22, 2004--Decided June 24, 2004
During his capital murder trial's penalty phase, petitioner Tennard presented evidence that he had an IQ of 67. The jury was instructed to
determine the appropriate punishment by considering two "special issues," which inquired into whether the crime was committed deliberately and whether the defendant posed a risk of future dangerousness.
These were materially identical to two special issues found insufficient
in Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, for the jury to give effect to Penry's
mitigating mental retardation and childhood abuse evidence. Tennard's
jury answered both special issues affirmatively, and Tennard was sentenced to death. The Federal District Court denied Tennard's federal
habeas petition in which he claimed that his death sentence violated the
Eighth Amendment as interpreted in Penry, and denied a certificate of
appealability (COA). The Fifth Circuit agreed that Tennard was not
entitled to a COA. It applied a threshold test to Tennard's mitigating
evidence, asking whether it met the Fifth Circuit's standard of "constitutional relevance" in Penry cases--that is, whether it was evidence of
a "uniquely severe permanent handicap" that bore a "nexus" to the
crime. The court concluded that (1) low IQ evidence alone does not
constitute a uniquely severe condition, and no evidence tied Tennard's
IQ to retardation, and (2) even if his low IQ amounted to mental retardation evidence, Tennard did not show that his crime was attributable to
it. After this Court vacated the judgment and remanded for further
consideration in light of Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304, the Fifth
Circuit reinstated its prior opinion.

Held: Because "reasonable jurists would find the district court's assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong," Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 484, a COA should have issued. Pp. 282-289.

(a) A COA should issue if an applicant has "made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right," 28 U. S. C. $ 2253(c)(2), by
demonstrating "that reasonable jurists would find the district court's
assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong," 529 U. S.,

"was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly

Syllabus
established Federal law, as determined by" this Court. $ 2254(d)(1).
Pp. 282-283.

(b) The Fifth Circuit assessed Tennard's Penry claim under an improper standard. Its threshold "constitutional relevance" screening
test has no foundation in this Court's decisions. Relevance was not at
issue in Penry. And this Court spoke in the most expansive terms
when addressing the relevance standard directly in McKoy v. North
Carolina, 494 U. S. 433, 440-441, finding applicable the general evidentiary standard that " ` "any tendency to make the existence of any fact
that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable
or less probable than it would be without the evidence," ' " id., at 440.
Once this low relevance threshold is met, the "Eighth Amendment requires that the jury be able to consider and give effect to" a capital
defendant's mitigating evidence. Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370,
377-378. The Fifth Circuit's test is inconsistent with these principles.
Thus, neither the "uniquely severe" nor the "nexus" element of the Fifth
Circuit's test was a proper reason not to reach the substance of Tennard's Penry claims. Pp. 283-288.

(c) Turning to the analysis that the Fifth Circuit should have conducted, reasonable jurists could conclude that Tennard's low IQ evidence
was relevant mitigating evidence, and that the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals' application of Penry was unreasonable, since the relationship
between the special issues and Tennard's low IQ evidence has the same
essential features as that between those issues and Penry's mental retardation evidence. Impaired intellectual functioning has mitigating dimension beyond the impact it has on the ability to act deliberately. A
reasonable jurist could conclude that the jury might have given the low
IQ evidence aggravating effect in considering Tennard's future dangerousness. Indeed, the prosecutor pressed exactly the most problematic
interpretation of the special issues, suggesting that Tennard's low IQ
was irrelevant in mitigation, but relevant to future dangerousness.
Pp. 288-289.

Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
In Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302 (1989) (Penry I), we
held that the Texas capital sentencing scheme provided a
constitutionally inadequate vehicle for jurors to consider and
give effect to the mitigating evidence of mental retardation
and childhood abuse the petitioner had presented. The petitioner in this case argues that the same scheme was inadequate for jurors to give effect to his evidence of low intelligence. The Texas courts rejected his claim, and a Federal
District Court denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
We conclude that "reasonable jurists would find the district
court's assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or
wrong," Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 484 (2000), and
therefore hold that a certificate of appealability should have
issued.

I

Petitioner Robert Tennard was convicted by a jury of capital murder in October 1986. The evidence presented at trial
indicated that Tennard and two accomplices killed two of his
neighbors and robbed their house. Tennard himself stabbed
one of the victims to death, and one of the accomplices killed
the other victim with a hatchet.

Opinion of the Court
During the penalty phase of the trial, defense counselcalled only one witness--Tennard's parole officer--who testified that Tennard's Department of Corrections record from aprior incarceration indicated that he had an IQ of 67. App.
28-29. He testified that the IQ test would have been admin-istered as a matter of course. Ibid. The report, which indicated that Tennard was 17 years old at the time it was pre-pared, was admitted into evidence. On cross-examination,
the parole officer testified that he did not know who hadadministered the test.

Id., at 30. The government intro-duced evidence in the penalty phase regarding a prior conviction for rape, committed when Tennard was 16. The rapevictim testified that she had escaped through a window after
Tennard permitted her to go to the bathroom to take a bath,promising him she would not run away. Id., at 16-17.

The jury was instructed to consider the appropriate pun-ishment by answering the two "special issues" used at the
time in Texas to establish whether a sentence of life impris-onment or death would be imposed:

"Was the conduct of the defendant, Robert James Ten-nard, that caused the death of the deceased committed
deliberately and with the reasonable expectation thatthe death of the deceased or another would result?"
Id., at 69 (the "deliberateness special issue")."Is there a probability that the defendant, Robert
James Tennard, would commit criminal acts of violencethat would constitute a continuing threat to society?"
Id., at 70 (the "future dangerousness special issue").
In his penalty phase closing argument, defense counsel re-lied on both the IQ score and the rape victim's testimony to

suggest that Tennard's limited mental faculties and gulliblenature mitigated his culpability:

"Tennard has got a 67 IQ. The same guy that told thispoor unfortunate woman [the rape victim] that was trying to work that day, `Well, if I let you in there, will you

Opinion of the Court
leave?' And he believed her. This guy with the 67 IQ,and she goes in and, sure enough, she escapes, just like

she should have. That is uncontroverted testimony be-fore you, that we have got a man before us that has got
an intelligence quotient . . . that is that low." Id., at 51.
In rebuttal, the prosecution suggested that the low IQevidence was simply irrelevant to the question of mitigation:

"But whether he has a low IQ or not is not really theissue. Because the legislature, in asking you to address
that question [the future dangerousness special issue],the reasons why he became a danger are not really relevant. The fact that he is a danger, that the evidenceshows he's a danger, is the criteria to use in answering
that question." Id., at 60.
The jury answered both special issues in the affirmative,and Tennard was accordingly sentenced to death.

Unsuccessful on direct appeal, Tennard sought state post-conviction relief. He argued that, in light of the instructions
given to the jury, his death sentence had been obtained inviolation of the Eighth Amendment as interpreted by this
Court in Penry I. In that case, we had held that "it is notenough simply to allow the defendant to present mitigating
evidence to the sentencer. The sentencer must also be ableto consider and give effect to that evidence in imposing sentence." Penry I, supra, at 319; see also Penry v. Johnson,532 U. S. 782, 797 (2001)

(Penry II) (describing " `give effectto' " language of Penry I as "the key" to that decision). We

concluded that the same two special issues that were pre-sented to Tennard's jury (plus a third immaterial to the questions now before us) were insufficient for the jury in Penry'scase to consider and give effect to Penry's evidence of mental
retardation and childhood abuse, and therefore ran afoul ofthe Eighth Amendment. Penry I, 492 U. S., at 319-328.
His mental retardation evidence, we held, " `had relevance to[his] moral culpability beyond the scope of the [deliberate542US2 Unit: $U68 [11-01-06 18:17:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ness] special verdict questio[n]' " because "[p]ersonal culpa-bility is not solely a function of a defendant's capacity to

act `deliberately.' " Id., at 322 (some brackets in original).Moreover, because the "evidence concerning Penry's mental
retardation indicated that one effect of his retardation is hisinability to learn from his mistakes," his retardation was relevant to the future dangerousness special issue "only as an
aggravating factor." Id., at 323. As to the evidence ofchildhood abuse, we held that the two special issues simply

failed to "provide a vehicle for the jury to give [it] mitigatingeffect."

Id., at 322-324.
The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejected Tennard's
Penry claim. Ex parte Tennard, 960 S. W. 2d 57 (1997) (en
banc). Writing for a plurality of four, Presiding Judge McCormick observed that the definition of mental retardation
adopted in Texas involves three components ("(1) subaverage
general intellectual functioning, (2) concurrent deficits in
adaptive behavior, and (3) onset during the early development period," id., at 60), and concluded: "[Tennard's] evidence of a low IQ score, standing alone, does not meet this
definition. Qualitatively and quantitatively [Tennard's] low
IQ evidence does not approach the level of Johnny Paul Penry's evidence of mental retardation. . . . [W]e find no evidence
in this record that applicant is mentally retarded." Id.,
at 61.

The plurality went on to consider whether Tennard would
be entitled to relief under Penry even if his low IQ fell
"within Penry's definition of mental retardation." 960 S. W.
2d, at 61. It held that he would not. The court explained
that, unlike the evidence presented in Penry's case, "there is
no evidence [that Tennard's] low IQ rendered him unable to
appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct when he committed the offense, or that his low IQ rendered him unable
to learn from his mistakes or . . . control his impulses . . . ."
Id., at 62. It found there was "no danger" that the jury
would have given the evidence "only aggravating effect in

Opinion of the Court
answering" the future dangerousness special issue, and thatthe low IQ and gullibility evidence was not beyond the jury's

effective reach because the jury "could have used this evi-dence for a `no' answer" to the deliberateness special issue.
Ibid.Two judges concurred separately, and wrote that "this
Court has sustained a Penry claim only when there is evidence of mental retardation. But even in those cases, theevidence of mental retardation was always something more

than what was presented in this case." 960 S. W. 2d, at 64(opinion of Meyers, J.) (citations omitted). Taking a more
permissive view of evidence of impaired intellectual functioning than did the plurality ("[F]or Penry purposes, courts
should not distinguish between mental retardation and dementia," even though the onset of the latter "may occur after
age eighteen," id., at 65), the concurring judges nevertheless
concluded that "the record does not contain sufficient evidence to support" Tennard's Penry claim. 960 S. W. 2d,
at 63. The concurring judges also rejected Tennard's contention that "evidence of an IQ of below 70 alone requires a
`Penry instruction' " because published opinions of the Texas
courts had uniformly required more. Id., at 67.

Judge Baird dissented, maintaining that the Court of
Criminal Appeals had "consistent[ly]" held, in the wake of
Penry I, that "evidence of mental retardation cannot be adequately considered within the statutory" special issues. 960
S. W. 2d, at 67. The court had strayed from its precedent,
Judge Baird wrote, and instead of asking simply whether the
jury had a vehicle for considering the mitigating evidence,
had "weigh[ed] the sufficiency of [Tennard's] mitigating evidence." Id., at 70. Judges Overstreet and Womack dissented without opinion. Id., at 63.

Tennard sought federal habeas corpus relief. The District
Court denied his petition. Tennard v. Johnson, Civ. Action
No. H-98-4238 (SD Tex., July 25, 2000), App. 121. The
court began by observing that "[e]vidence of a single low

Opinion of the Court
score on an unidentified intelligence test is not evidence thatTennard was mentally retarded."

Id., at 128. It then considered whether the 67 IQ score was "within `the effectivereach' of the jury."

Ibid. Noting that "Tennard's low IQ
score was not concealed from the jury; it was in evidence,and both sides argued its significance for punishment," the

court concluded that the jury had adequate means, in the
two special issues, by which to give effect to that mitigat-ing evidence.

Id., at 129. The court subsequently denied
Tennard a certificate of appealability (COA). Civ. ActionNo. H-98-4238 (SD Tex., Oct. 17, 2000), see App. 2.

The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, after full
briefing and oral argument, issued an opinion holding that
Tennard was not entitled to a COA because his Penry claim
was not debatable among jurists of reason. Tennard v.
Cockrell, 284 F. 3d 591 (2002). The court began by stating
the test applied in the Fifth Circuit to Penry claims, which
involves a threshold inquiry into whether the petitioner presented "constitutionally relevant" mitigating evidence, that
is, evidence of a " `uniquely severe permanent handicap with
which the defendant was burdened through no fault of his
own,' " and evidence that " `the criminal act was attributable
to this severe permanent condition.' " 284 F. 3d, at 595.

The court then held that Tennard was not entitled to a
COA, for two reasons: First, it held that evidence of low IQ
alone does not constitute a uniquely severe condition, and
rejected Tennard's claim that his evidence was of mental retardation, not just low IQ, because no evidence had been introduced tying his IQ score to retardation. Id., at 596.
Second, it held that even if Tennard's evidence was mental
retardation evidence, his claim must fail because he did not
show that the crime he committed was attributable to his
low IQ. Id., at 596-597. Judge Dennis dissented, concluding that the Texas court's application of Penry was unreasonable and that Tennard was entitled to habeas relief. 284
F. 3d, at 597-604.

282 TENNARD v. DRETKE

Opinion of the Court
Tennard filed a petition for certiorari, and this Court
granted the writ, vacated the judgment, and remanded for
further consideration in light of Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S.
304 (2002). Tennard v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 802 (2002). The
Fifth Circuit took the remand to be for consideration of a
substantive Atkins claim. It observed that "Tennard has
never argued that the Eighth Amendment prohibits his execution" and reinstated its prior panel opinion. Tennard v.
Cockrell, 317 F. 3d 476, 477 (2003). We again granted certiorari. 540 U. S. 945 (2003).

A

A COA should issue if the applicant has "made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right," 28
U. S. C. $ 2253(c)(2), which we have interpreted to require
that the "petitioner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court's assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong." Slack v. McDaniel,
529 U. S., at 484; see also Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322,
336 (2003) ("Under the controlling standard, a petitioner
must `sho[w] that reasonable jurists could debate whether
(or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been
resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented
were "adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further" ' "). The petitioner's arguments ultimately must be
assessed under the deferential standard required by 28
U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1): Relief may not be granted unless the
state court adjudication "resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly
established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme
Court of the United States."

The State has never disputed that Tennard's Penry claim
was properly preserved for federal habeas review. Not only
did the state court consider the question on the merits, we
note that the issue was also raised by defense counsel prior

Opinion of the Court
to trial in a motion to set aside the indictment on the ground,among others, that the "Texas capital murder statutes do not

explicitly allow the consideration of any specific mitigatingcircumstances at the punishment phase of the prosecution
and, consequently, are violative of the accused's right to befree from cruel and unusual punishment and are also void
for vagueness." Defendant's Motion to Set Aside the In-dictment in Cause No. 431127 (248th Jud. Dist. Ct. Harris
County, Tex., May 28, 1986), p. 4.

B
Despite paying lipservice to the principles guiding issu-ance of a COA, Tennard v. Cockrell, 284 F. 3d, at 594, the

Fifth Circuit's analysis proceeded along a distinctly differenttrack. Rather than examining the District Court's analysis
of the Texas court decision, it invoked its own restrictivegloss on Penry I:

"In reviewing a Penry claim, we must determinewhether the mitigating evidence introduced at trial was
constitutionally relevant and beyond the effective reachof the jury. . . . To be constitutionally relevant, `the evidence must show (1) a uniquely severe permanent handi-cap with which the defendant was burdened through no
fault of his own, . . . and (2) that the criminal act wasattributable to this severe permanent condition.' " Id.,
at 595 (quoting Davis v. Scott, 51 F. 3d 457, 460-461(CA5 1995)).

This test for "constitutional relevance," characterized bythe State at oral argument as a threshold "screening test,"
Tr. of Oral Arg. 10, 28, appears to be applied uniformly inthe Fifth Circuit to Penry claims. See, e. g., Bigby v. Cockrell, 340 F. 3d 259, 273 (2003); Robertson v. Cockrell, 325 F. 3d243, 251 (2003) (en banc); Smith v. Cockrell, 311 F. 3d 661,
680 (2002); Blue v. Cockrell, 298 F. 3d 318, 320-321 (2002);
Davis, supra, at 460-461. Only after the court finds that

284 TENNARD v. DRETKE

Opinion of the Court
certain mitigating evidence is "constitutionally relevant" willit consider whether that evidence was within " `the "effective

reach" of the jur[y].' " E. g., Smith, supra, at 680 (court askswhether evidence was constitutionally relevant and, " `if so,' "
will consider whether it was within jury's effective reach).In

Tennard v. Cockrell, the Fifth Circuit concluded that Tennard was "precluded from establishing a Penry claim" because his low IQ evidence bore no nexus to the crime, andso did not move on to the "effective reach" question. 284

F. 3d, at 597.The Fifth Circuit's test has no foundation in the decisions
of this Court. Neither Penry I nor its progeny screened
mitigating evidence for "constitutional relevance" before considering whether the jury instructions comported with the
Eighth Amendment. Indeed, the mitigating evidence presented in Penry I was concededly relevant, see Tr. of Oral
Arg., O. T. 1988, No. 87-6177, pp. 34-36, so even if limiting
principles regarding relevance were suggested in our opinion--and we do not think they were--they could not have
been material to the holding.

When we addressed directly the relevance standard applicable to mitigating evidence in capital cases in McKoy v.
North Carolina, 494 U. S. 433, 440-441 (1990), we spoke in
the most expansive terms. We established that the "meaning of relevance is no different in the context of mitigating
evidence introduced in a capital sentencing proceeding" than
in any other context, and thus the general evidentiary standard--" ` "any tendency to make the existence of any fact that
is of consequence to the determination of the action more
probable or less probable than it would be without the
evidence" ' "--applies. Id., at 440 (quoting New Jersey v.
T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325, 345 (1985)). We quoted approvingly
from a dissenting opinion in the state court: " `Relevant mitigating evidence is evidence which tends logically to prove or
disprove some fact or circumstance which a fact-finder could
reasonably deem to have mitigating value.' " 494 U. S., at

Opinion of the Court
440 (quoting State v. McKoy, 323 N. C. 1, 55-56, 372 S. E. 2d12, 45 (1988) (opinion of Exum, C. J.)). Thus, a State cannot

bar "the consideration of . . . evidence if the sentencer couldreasonably find that it warrants a sentence less than death."
494 U. S., at 441.Once this low threshold for relevance is met, the "Eighth
Amendment requires that the jury be able to consider and
give effect to" a capital defendant's mitigating evidence.
Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370, 377-378 (1990) (citing
Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978); Eddings v. Oklahoma,455 U. S. 104 (1982);

Penry I, 492 U. S. 302 (1989)); see also
Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 822 (1991) ("We have held
that a State cannot preclude the sentencer from considering
`any relevant mitigating evidence' that the defendant proffers in support of a sentence less than death. . . . [V]irtually
no limits are placed on the relevant mitigating evidence a
capital defendant may introduce concerning his own circumstances" (quoting Eddings, supra, at 114)).

The Fifth Circuit's test is inconsistent with these principles. Most obviously, the test will screen out any positive
aspect of a defendant's character, because good character
traits are neither "handicap[s]" nor typically traits to which
criminal activity is "attributable." In Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1, 5 (1986), however, we made clear that
good character evidence can be evidence that, "[u]nder
Eddings, . . . may not be excluded from the sentencer's consideration." We observed that even though the petitioner's
evidence of good conduct in jail did "not relate specifically to
petitioner's culpability for the crime he committed, there is
no question but that such [evidence] would be `mitigating' in
the sense that [it] might serve `as a basis for a sentence less
than death.' Lockett, supra, at 604." Id., at 4-5 (citation
omitted). Such evidence, we said, of "a defendant's disposition to make a well-behaved and peaceful adjustment to life
in prison is . . . by its nature relevant to the sentencing determination." Id., at 7. Of course, the Texas courts might

542US2 Unit: $U68 [11-01-06 18:17:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN
286 TENNARD v. DRETKE

Opinion of the Court
reasonably conclude that evidence of good conduct in jail was
within the jury's effective reach via the future dangerousness special issue. See Franklin v. Lynaugh, 487 U. S. 164,
177-178 (1988) (plurality opinion); id., at 185-186 (O'Connor,
J., concurring in judgment). But under the Fifth Circuit's
test, the evidence would have been screened out before the
time came to consider that question.

In Tennard's case, the Fifth Circuit invoked both the
"uniquely severe" and the "nexus" elements of its test to
deny him relief under Penry I. Tennard v. Cockrell, 284
F. 3d, at 596 (contrasting Tennard's low IQ evidence, which
did "not constitute a uniquely severe condition," with mental
retardation, a "severe permanent condition"); id., at 596-597
(concluding that Penry claims "must fail because [Tennard]
made no showing at trial that the criminal act was attributable" to his condition).* Neither ground provided an adequate reason to fail to reach the heart of Tennard's Penry
claims.

We have never denied that gravity has a place in the relevance analysis, insofar as evidence of a trivial feature of the
defendant's character or the circumstances of the crime is
unlikely to have any tendency to mitigate the defendant's
culpability. See Skipper, supra, at 7, n. 2 ("We do not hold
that all facets of the defendant's ability to adjust to prison
life must be treated as relevant and potentially mitigating.
For example, we have no quarrel with the statement . . . that
`how often [the defendant] will take a shower' is irrelevant
to the sentencing determination" (quoting State v. Plath, 281

*The Fifth Circuit stated that "a majority of the Court of Criminal
Appeals found `no evidence in this record that [Tennard] is mentally retarded.' " 284 F. 3d, at 596-597. As described above, however, that was
the conclusion of a four-judge plurality; the narrowest and thus controlling
opinion on this point, correctly described by the Fifth Circuit as "conclud[ing] that there was not enough evidence of mental retardation in the
record to support Tennard's claim," id., at 596, n. 5 (emphasis added), is
Judge Meyers' concurring opinion.

542US2 Unit: $U68 [11-01-06 18:17:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
S. C. 1, 15, 313 S. E. 2d 619, 627 (1984))). However, to say
that only those features and circumstances that a panel of
federal appellate judges deems to be "severe" (let alone
"uniquely severe") could have such a tendency is incorrect.
Rather, the question is simply whether the evidence is of
such a character that it "might serve `as a basis for a sentence less than death,' " Skipper, supra, at 5.

The Fifth Circuit was likewise wrong to have refused
to consider the debatability of the Penry question on the
ground that Tennard had not adduced evidence that his
crime was attributable to his low IQ. In Atkins v. Virginia,
536 U. S., at 316, we explained that impaired intellectual
functioning is inherently mitigating: "[T]oday our society
views mentally retarded offenders as categorically less culpable than the average criminal." Nothing in our opinion
suggested that a mentally retarded individual must establish
a nexus between her mental capacity and her crime before
the Eighth Amendment prohibition on executing her is triggered. Equally, we cannot countenance the suggestion that
low IQ evidence is not relevant mitigating evidence--and
thus that the Penry question need not even be asked--unless
the defendant also establishes a nexus to the crime.

The State claims that "the Fifth Circuit's Penry I jurisprudence is not at issue" in this case. Brief for Respondent
35, n. 21; Tr. of Oral Arg. 33. To the contrary, that jurisprudence is directly at issue because the Fifth Circuit denied
Tennard relief on the ground that he did not satisfy the requirements imposed by its "constitutional relevance" test.
As we have explained, the Fifth Circuit's screening test has
no basis in our precedents and, indeed, is inconsistent with
the standard we have adopted for relevance in the capital
sentencing context. We therefore hold that the Fifth Circuit assessed Tennard's Penry claim under an improper legal
standard. Cf. Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S., at 341 (holding, on certiorari review of the denial of a COA, that the

Fifth Circuit had applied an incorrect standard by improp-erly merging the requirements of two statutory sections).

C
We turn to the analysis the Fifth Circuit should have con-ducted: Has Tennard "demonstrate[d] that reasonable jurists

would find the district court's assessment of the constitu-tional claims debatable or wrong"? Slack v. McDaniel, 529
U. S., at 484. We conclude that he has.Reasonable jurists could conclude that the low IQ evidence
Tennard presented was relevant mitigating evidence. Evi-dence of significantly impaired intellectual functioning is obviously evidence that "might serve `as a basis for a sentenceless than death,' "

Skipper, 476 U. S., at 5; see also, e. g., Wig-gins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 535 (2003) (observing, with respect to individual with IQ of 79, that "Wiggins['] . . . dimin-ished mental capacitie[s] further augment his mitigation
case"); Burger v. Kemp, 483 U. S. 776, 779, 789, n. 7 (1987)(noting that petitioner "had an IQ of 82 and functioned at
the level of a 12-year-old child," and later that "[i]n light ofpetitioner's youth at the time of the offense, . . . testimony
that his `mental and emotional development were at a levelseveral years below his chronological age' could not have
been excluded by the state court" (quoting Eddings, 455U. S., at 116)).

Reasonable jurists also could conclude that the TexasCourt of Criminal Appeals' application of

Penry to the factsof Tennard's case was unreasonable. The relationship between the special issues and Tennard's low IQ evidence hasthe same essential features as the relationship between the
special issues and Penry's mental retardation evidence. Im-paired intellectual functioning has mitigating dimension beyond the impact it has on the individual's ability to act delib-erately. See Penry I, 492 U. S., at 322. A reasonable jurist
could conclude that the jury might well have given Tennard'slow IQ evidence aggravating effect in considering his future

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
dangerousness, not only as a matter of probable inference
from the evidence but also because the prosecutor told them
to do so: "[W]hether he has a low IQ or not is not really the
issue. Because the legislature, in asking you to address that
question, the reasons why he became a danger are not really
relevant. The fact that he is a danger, that the evidence
shows he's a danger, is the criteria to use in answering that
question." App. 60. Indeed, the prosecutor's comments
pressed exactly the most problematic interpretation of the
special issues, suggesting that Tennard's low IQ was irrelevant in mitigation, but relevant to the question whether he
posed a future danger.

* * *
We hold that the Fifth Circuit's "uniquely severe permanent handicap" and "nexus" tests are incorrect, and we
reject them. We hold that reasonable jurists would find
debatable or wrong the District Court's disposition of
Tennard's low-IQ-based Penry claim, and that Tennard is
therefore entitled to a COA. The judgment of the United
States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is reversed,
and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, dissenting.
A certificate of appealability may only issue if the applicant has "made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right," 28 U. S. C. $ 2253(c)(2). "Where a district

rists would not find the District Court's assessment of theconstitutional claims debatable or wrong, I dissent.

The District Court conducted the proper inquiry by exam-ining whether Tennard's evidence of low intelligence was
"within `the effective reach' " of the jury. App. 128 (quoting
Johnson v. Texas, 509 U. S. 350, 368 (1993)). And the District Court came to the correct result; that is, the special
issues allowed the jury to give some mitigating effect to Ten-nard's evidence of low intelligence.

Id., at 369; Graham v.
Collins, 506 U. S. 461, 475 (1993).In

Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S. 262 (1976), this Court held
that the Texas special issues system, as a general matter, isconstitutional. The special issues system guides the jury's

consideration of mitigating evidence at sentencing. Wehave stated:

"Although Lockett [v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978),] and
Eddings [v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982),] prevent a
State from placing relevant mitigating evidence `beyondthe effective reach of the sentencer,'

Graham, supra, at
475, those cases and others in that decisional line do notbar a State from guiding the sentencer's consideration

of mitigating evidence. Indeed, we have held that`there is no . . . constitutional requirement of unfettered
sentencing discretion in the jury, and States are free to
structure and shape consideration of mitigating evidence"in an effort to achieve a more rational and equitable

administration of the death penalty." ' Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370, 377 (1990) (quoting Franklin v.
Lynaugh, 487 U. S. 164, 181 (1988) (plurality opinion))."
Johnson, supra, at 362.

In Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302 (1989) (Penry I), the
Court concluded that the Texas special issues were too limited to give effect to Penry's mitigating evidence of his mental retardation and severe childhood abuse. But we have
noted that Penry I did not "effec[t] a sea change in this

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
Court's view of the constitutionality of the former Texasdeath penalty statute,"

Graham, supra, at 474. Tennard's
evidence of low intelligence simply does not present the samedifficulty that Penry's evidence did.

There is no dispute that Tennard's low intelligence is arelevant mitigating circumstance, and that the sentencing
jury must be allowed to consider that mitigating evidence.
See, e. g., Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 110 (1982)(" `[T]he sentencer . . . [may] not be precluded from considering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant's charac-ter or record and any of the circumstances of the offense' "
(emphasis deleted) (quoting Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586,
604 (1978))). But the Constitution does not require that
"a jury be able to give effect to mitigating evidence in every
conceivable manner in which the evidence [may] be relevant."
Johnson, supra, at 372. The only question in this case is
whether reasonable jurists would find the District Court's
assessment that Tennard's evidence of low intelligence was
within the effective reach of the jury via the Texas special
issues debatable or wrong.

The Court concludes that "[t]he relationship between the
special issues and Tennard's low IQ evidence has the same
essential features as the relationship between the special issues and Penry's mental retardation evidence." Ante, at
288. I disagree. The first special issue asked whether Tennard had caused the death of the victim " `deliberately and
with the reasonable expectation that the death of the deceased or another would result.' " Ante, at 277. As the
Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas noted and the District
Court agreed, the mitigating evidence of Tennard's low intelligence could be given effect by the jury through this deliberateness special issue. It does not follow from the Court's
conclusion in Penry I that mental retardation had relevance
to Penry's moral culpability beyond the scope of the deliberateness special issue that evidence of low intelligence has the
same relevance. And, after Johnson and Graham, it is clear

292 TENNARD v. DRETKE

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
that the question is simply whether the jury could give some
effect to the mitigating evidence through the special issues.
Johnson, supra, at 369 (rejecting the petitioner's claim that
a special instruction was necessary because his evidence of
youth had relevance outside the special issue framework);
Graham, supra, at 476-477 ("[R]eading Penry [I] as petitioner urges--and thereby holding that a defendant is entitled to special instructions whenever he can offer mitigating
evidence that has some arguable relevance beyond the special issues--would be to require in all cases that a fourth
`special issue' be put to the jury: ` "Does any mitigating evidence before you, whether or not relevant to the [other special issues], lead you to believe that the death penalty should
not be imposed?" ' The Franklin [v. Lynaugh, 487 U. S. 164
(1988),] plurality rejected precisely this contention, finding it
irreconcilable with the Court's holding in Jurek, see Franklin, supra, at 180, n. 10, and we affirm that conclusion
today").

The second special issue asked " `[i]s there a probability
that the defendant . . . would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society?' "
Ante, at 277. Here, too, this case is very different from
Penry I, where there was expert medical testimony that
Penry's condition prevented him from learning from experience. 492 U. S., at 308-309. Here, no such evidence was
presented. Given the evidence, the jury could have concluded that low intelligence meant that Tennard is a slow
learner, but with the proper instruction, he could conform
his behavior to social norms. It also could have concluded,
as the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas noted, that Tennard was a " `follower' " rather than a " `leader,' " App. 91,
and that he again could conform his behavior in the proper
environment. In either case--contrary to Penry I--the evidence could be given mitigating effect in the second special
issue. In short, low intelligence is not the same as mental

retardation and does not necessarily create the Penry I"two-edged sword." 492 U. S., at 324. The two should not

be summarily bracketed together.Because I do not think that reasonable jurists would disagree with the District Court's conclusion that the jury in
this case had the ability to give mitigating effect to Tennard's
evidence of low intelligence through the first and second special issues, I dissent.

Justice Scalia, dissenting.
Petitioner argues that Texas's statutory special issues
framework unconstitutionally constrained the jury's discretion to give effect to his mitigating evidence of a low IQ
score, violating the requirement that " ` "a sentencer must be
allowed to give full consideration and full effect to mitigating circumstances." ' " Reply Brief for Petitioner 4 (quoting
Penry v. Johnson, 532 U. S. 782, 797 (2001) (Penry II), in
turn quoting Johnson v. Texas, 509 U. S. 350, 381 (1993)
(O'Connor, J., dissenting)). This claim relies on Penry v.
Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302 (1989) (Penry I), a case that applied
principles earlier limned in Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S.
104 (1982), and Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978).

I have previously expressed my view that this "right" to
unchanneled sentencer discretion has no basis in the Constitution. See Penry I, supra, at 356-360 (opinion concurring
in part and dissenting in part). I have also said that the
Court's decisions establishing this right do not deserve stare
decisis effect, because requiring unchanneled discretion to
say no to death cannot rationally be reconciled with our prior

Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 662 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).The Court returned greater rationality to our

Penry jurisprudence by cutting it back in Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S.461 (1993), and

Johnson v. Texas, supra. I joined the Court
in this pruning effort, noting that "the essence of today's
holding (to the effect that discretion may constitutionally bechanneled) was set forth in my dissent in

Penry." Id., at
374 (concurring opinion). As The Chief Justice notes, thelower courts' disposition of petitioner's

Penry claim in the
present case was entirely appropriate under these cases.
Ante, at 290-293 (dissenting opinion). Yet the opinion for
the Court does not even acknowledge their existence. It
finds failings in the Fifth Circuit's framework for analyzing
Penry claims as if this Court's own jurisprudence were not
the root of the problem. "The simultaneous pursuit of contradictory objectives necessarily produces confusion." Walton, supra, at 667.

Although the present case involves only a certificate of appealability (COA) ruling, rather than a ruling directly on the
merits of petitioner's claim, I cannot require the issuance of
a COA when the insubstantial right at issue derives from
case law in which this Court has long left the Constitution
behind and embraced contradiction. I respectfully dissent.

Justice Thomas, dissenting.
Petitioner must rely on Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302
(1989), to argue that Texas' special issues framework unconstitutionally limited the discretion of his sentencing jury.
I have long maintained, however, that Penry did "so much
violence to so many of this Court's settled precedents in an
area of fundamental constitutional law, [that] it cannot command the force of stare decisis." Graham v. Collins, 506

BLAKELY v. WASHINGTON
certiorari to the court of appeals of washington

No. 02-1632. Argued March 23, 2004--Decided June 24, 2004
Petitioner pleaded guilty to kidnaping his estranged wife. The facts admitted in his plea, standing alone, supported a maximum sentence of 53
months, but the judge imposed a 90-month sentence after finding that
petitioner had acted with deliberate cruelty, a statutorily enumerated
ground for departing from the standard range. The Washington Court
of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioner's argument that the sentencing
procedure deprived him of his federal constitutional right to have a jury
determine beyond a reasonable doubt all facts legally essential to his
sentence.

Held: Because the facts supporting petitioner's exceptional sentence were

neither admitted by petitioner nor found by a jury, the sentence violated
his Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury. Pp. 301-314.

(a) This case requires the Court to apply the rule of Apprendi v. New
Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490, that, "[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved
beyond a reasonable doubt." The relevant statutory maximum for Apprendi purposes is the maximum a judge may impose based solely on
the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.
Here, the judge could not have imposed the 90-month sentence based
solely on the facts admitted in the guilty plea, because Washington law
requires an exceptional sentence to be based on factors other than those
used in computing the standard-range sentence. Petitioner's sentence
is not analogous to those upheld in McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S.
79, and Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241, which were not greater
than what state law authorized based on the verdict alone. Regardless
of whether the judge's authority to impose the enhanced sentence depends on a judge's finding a specified fact, one of several specified facts,
or any aggravating fact, it remains the case that the jury's verdict alone
does not authorize the sentence. Pp. 301-305.

(b) This Court's commitment to Apprendi in this context reflects not
just respect for longstanding precedent, but the need to give intelligible content to the fundamental constitutional right of jury trial.
Pp. 305-308.

(c) This case is not about the constitutionality of determinate sentencing, but only about how it can be implemented in a way that respects

the Sixth Amendment. The Framers' paradigm for criminal justice is
the common-law ideal of limited state power accomplished by strict division of authority between judge and jury. That can be preserved without abandoning determinate sentencing and at no sacrifice of fairness to

298 BLAKELY v. WASHINGTON

Opinion of the Court

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
Petitioner Ralph Howard Blakely, Jr., pleaded guilty to thekidnaping of his estranged wife. The facts admitted in his

plea, standing alone, supported a maximum sentence of 53months. Pursuant to state law, the court imposed an "exceptional" sentence of 90 months after making a judicial de-termination that he had acted with "deliberate cruelty."
App. 40, 49. We consider whether this violated petitioner'sSixth Amendment right to trial by jury.

I
Petitioner married his wife Yolanda in 1973. He was evi-dently a difficult man to live with, having been diagnosed at

various times with psychological and personality disordersincluding paranoid schizophrenia. His wife ultimately filed
for divorce. In 1998, he abducted her from their orchardhome in Grant County, Washington, binding her with duct
tape and forcing her at knifepoint into a wooden box in thebed of his pickup truck. In the process, he implored her to
dismiss the divorce suit and related trust proceedings.When the couple's 13-year-old son Ralphy returned home
from school, petitioner ordered him to follow in another car,
threatening to harm Yolanda with a shotgun if he did not doso. Ralphy escaped and sought help when they stopped at

a gas station, but petitioner continued on with Yolanda to afriend's house in Montana. He was finally arrested after the
friend called the police.The State charged petitioner with first-degree kidnaping,
Wash. Rev. Code Ann. $ 9A.40.020(1) (2000).1 Upon reach-ing a plea agreement, however, it reduced the charge to
second-degree kidnaping involving domestic violence and use

of a firearm, see $$ 9A.40.030(1), 10.99.020(3)(p), 9.94A.125.2Petitioner entered a guilty plea admitting the elements of

second-degree kidnaping and the domestic-violence andfirearm allegations, but no other relevant facts.

The case then proceeded to sentencing. In Washington,second-degree kidnaping is a class B felony. $ 9A.40.030(3).
State law provides that "[n]o person convicted of a [class B]
felony shall be punished by confinement . . . exceeding . . . aterm of ten years." $ 9A.20.021(1)(b). Other provisions of

state law, however, further limit the range of sentences ajudge may impose. Washington's Sentencing Reform Act
specifies, for petitioner's offense of second-degree kidnap-ing with a firearm, a "standard range" of 49 to 53 months.
See $ 9.94A.320 (seriousness level V for second-degree kid-naping); App. 27 (offender score 2 based on $ 9.94A.360);

$ 9.94A.310(1), box 2-V (standard range of 13-17 months);$ 9.94A.310(3)(b) (36-month firearm enhancement).

3 A judge

may impose a sentence above the standard range if he finds
"substantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptional
sentence." $ 9.94A.120(2). The Act lists aggravating factors that justify such a departure, which it recites to be illustrative rather than exhaustive. $ 9.94A.390. Nevertheless,
"[a] reason offered to justify an exceptional sentence can be
considered only if it takes into account factors other than
those which are used in computing the standard range sentence for the offense." State v. Gore, 143 Wash. 2d 288, 315-
316, 21 P. 3d 262, 277 (2001). When a judge imposes an exceptional sentence, he must set forth findings of fact and
conclusions of law supporting it. $ 9.94A.120(3). A review2 Petitioner further agreed to an additional charge of second-degree assault involving domestic violence, Wash. Rev. Code Ann. $$ 9A.36.021(1)(c),
10.99.020(3)(b) (2000). The 14-month sentence on that count ran concurrently and is not relevant here.

3 The domestic-violence stipulation subjected petitioner to such measures as a "no-contact" order, see $ 10.99.040, but did not increase the standard range of his sentence.

Opinion of the Court
ing court will reverse the sentence if it finds that "under
a clearly erroneous standard there is insufficient evidence
in the record to support the reasons for imposing an exceptional sentence." Id., at 315, 21 P. 3d, at 277 (citing

$ 9.94A.210(4)).

Pursuant to the plea agreement, the State recommended
a sentence within the standard range of 49 to 53 months.
After hearing Yolanda's description of the kidnaping, however, the judge rejected the State's recommendation and
imposed an exceptional sentence of 90 months--37 months
beyond the standard maximum. He justified the sentence
on the ground that petitioner had acted with "deliberate
cruelty," a statutorily enumerated ground for departure in
domestic-violence cases. $ 9.94A.390(2)(h)(iii).4

Faced with an unexpected increase of more than three
years in his sentence, petitioner objected. The judge accordingly conducted a 3-day bench hearing featuring testimony from petitioner, Yolanda, Ralphy, a police officer, and
medical experts. After the hearing, he issued 32 findings of
fact, concluding:

"The defendant's motivation to commit kidnapping
was complex, contributed to by his mental condition and
personality disorders, the pressures of the divorce litigation, the impending trust litigation trial and anger over
his troubled interpersonal relationships with his spouse
and children. While he misguidedly intended to forcefully reunite his family, his attempt to do so was subservient to his desire to terminate lawsuits and modify title
ownerships to his benefit.

4 The judge found other aggravating factors, but the Court of Appeals
questioned their validity under state law and their independent sufficiency
to support the extent of the departure. See 111 Wash. App. 851, 868-870,
and n. 3, 47 P. 3d 149, 158-159, and n. 3 (2002). It affirmed the sentence
solely on the finding of domestic violence with deliberate cruelty. Ibid.
We therefore focus only on that factor.

Opinion of the Court
"The defendant's methods were more homogeneousthan his motive. He used stealth and surprise, and took

advantage of the victim's isolation. He immediatelyemployed physical violence, restrained the victim with
tape, and threatened her with injury and death to her-self and others. He immediately coerced the victim into
providing information by the threatening application ofa knife. He violated a subsisting restraining order."
App. 48-49.
The judge adhered to his initial determination of deliberatecruelty.

Petitioner appealed, arguing that this sentencing proce-dure deprived him of his federal constitutional right to have
a jury determine beyond a reasonable doubt all facts legallyessential to his sentence. The State Court of Appeals affirmed, 111 Wash. App. 851, 870-871, 47 P. 3d 149, 159 (2002),relying on the Washington Supreme Court's rejection of a
similar challenge in Gore, supra, at 311-315, 21 P. 3d, at 275-277. The Washington Supreme Court denied discretionary
review. 148 Wash. 2d 1010, 62 P. 3d 889 (2003). We grantedcertiorari. 540 U. S. 965 (2003).

This case requires us to apply the rule we expressed in
Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490 (2000): "Otherthan the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases

the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory max-imum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt." This rule reflects two longstanding tenetsof common-law criminal jurisprudence: that the "truth of
every accusation" against a defendant "should afterwards beconfirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of his equals
and neighbours," 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on theLaws of England 343 (1769), and that "an accusation which
lacks any particular fact which the law makes essential tothe punishment is . . . no accusation within the requirements

Opinion of the Court
of the common law, and it is no accusation in reason," 1 J.
Bishop, Criminal Procedure $ 87, p. 55 (2d ed. 1872).5 These
principles have been acknowledged by courts and treatises
since the earliest days of graduated sentencing; we compiled
the relevant authorities in Apprendi, see 530 U. S., at 476-
483, 489-490, n. 15; id., at 501-518 (Thomas, J., concurring),
and need not repeat them here.6

5 Justice Breyer cites Justice O'Connor's Apprendi dissent for the
point that this Bishop quotation means only that indictments must charge
facts that trigger statutory aggravation of a common-law offense. Post,
at 340-341 (dissenting opinion). Of course, as he notes, Justice O'Connor was referring to an entirely different quotation, from Archbold's treatise. See 530 U. S., at 526 (citing J. Archbold, Pleading and Evidence in
Criminal Cases 51, 188 (15th ed. 1862)). Justice Breyer claims the two
are "similar," post, at 341, but they are as similar as chalk and cheese.
Bishop was not "addressing" the "problem" of statutes that aggravate
common-law offenses. Ibid. Rather, the entire chapter of his treatise
is devoted to the point that "every fact which is legally essential to the
punishment," 1 Criminal Procedure $ 81, at 51, must be charged in the
indictment and proved to a jury, id., ch. 6, at 50-56. As one "example" of
this principle (appearing several pages before the language we quote in
text above), he notes a statute aggravating common-law assault. Id., $ 82,
at 51-52. But nowhere is there the slightest indication that his general
principle was limited to that example. Even Justice Breyer's academic
supporters do not make that claim. See Bibas, Judicial Fact-Finding and
Sentence Enhancements in a World of Guilty Pleas, 110 Yale L. J. 1097,
1131-1132 (2001) (conceding that Bishop's treatise supports Apprendi,
while criticizing its "natural-law theorizing").

6 As to Justice O'Connor's criticism of the quantity of historical support for the Apprendi rule, post, at 323 (dissenting opinion): It bears repeating that the issue between us is not whether the Constitution limits
States' authority to reclassify elements as sentencing factors (we all agree
that it does); it is only which line, ours or hers, the Constitution draws.
Criticism of the quantity of evidence favoring our alternative would have
some force if it were accompanied by any evidence favoring hers. Justice O'Connor does not even provide a coherent alternative meaning for
the jury-trial guarantee, unless one considers "whatever the legislature
chooses to leave to the jury, so long as it does not go too far" coherent.

Opinion of the Court
Apprendi involved a New Jersey hate-crime statute that
authorized a 20-year sentence, despite the usual 10-year
maximum, if the judge found the crime to have been committed " `with a purpose to intimidate . . . because of race,
color, gender, handicap, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity.' " Id., at 468-469 (quoting N. J. Stat. Ann. $ 2C:44-3(e)
(West Supp. 1999-2000)). In Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584,
592-593, and n. 1 (2002), we applied Apprendi to an Arizona
law that authorized the death penalty if the judge found 1 of
10 aggravating factors. In each case, we concluded that the
defendant's constitutional rights had been violated because
the judge had imposed a sentence greater than the maximum
he could have imposed under state law without the challenged factual finding. Apprendi, supra, at 491-497; Ring,
supra, at 603-609.

In this case, petitioner was sentenced to more than three
years above the 53-month statutory maximum of the standard range because he had acted with "deliberate cruelty."
The facts supporting that finding were neither admitted by
petitioner nor found by a jury. The State nevertheless contends that there was no Apprendi violation because the relevant "statutory maximum" is not 53 months, but the 10-year
maximum for class B felonies in $ 9A.20.021(1)(b). It observes that no exceptional sentence may exceed that limit.
See $ 9.94A.420. Our precedents make clear, however, that
the "statutory maximum" for Apprendi purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the
facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant. See Ring, supra, at 602 (" `the maximum he would receive if punished according to the facts reflected in the jury
verdict alone' " (quoting Apprendi, supra, at 483)); Harris v.
United States, 536 U. S. 545, 563 (2002) (plurality opinion)
(same); cf. Apprendi, supra, at 488 (facts admitted by the
defendant). In other words, the relevant "statutory maximum" is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose

542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN
304 BLAKELY v. WASHINGTON

Opinion of the Court
after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may im-pose without any additional findings. When a judge inflicts

punishment that the jury's verdict alone does not allow, thejury has not found all the facts "which the law makes essential to the punishment," Bishop, supra, $ 87, at 55, and thejudge exceeds his proper authority.

The judge in this case could not have imposed the excep-tional 90-month sentence solely on the basis of the facts
admitted in the guilty plea. Those facts alone were in-sufficient because, as the Washington Supreme Court has
explained, "[a] reason offered to justify an exceptional sen-tence can be considered only if it takes into account factors
other than those which are used in computing the standardrange sentence for the offense,"

Gore, 143 Wash. 2d, at 315-316, 21 P. 3d, at 277, which in this case included the elements

of second-degree kidnaping and the use of a firearm, see$$ 9.94A.320, 9.94A.310(3)(b).

7 Had the judge imposed the

90-month sentence solely on the basis of the plea, he wouldhave been reversed. See $ 9.94A.210(4). The "maximum

sentence" is no more 10 years here than it was 20 years in
Apprendi (because that is what the judge could have im-posed upon finding a hate crime) or death in Ring (because

that is what the judge could have imposed upon finding anaggravator).

The State defends the sentence by drawing an analogyto those we upheld in McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S.
79 (1986), and Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241 (1949).Neither case is on point. McMillan involved a sentencing
scheme that imposed a statutory minimum if a judge founda particular fact. 477 U. S., at 81. We specifically noted
that the statute "does not authorize a sentence in excessof that otherwise allowed for [the underlying] offense."

Id.,

7 The State does not contend that the domestic-violence stipulation alone
supports the departure. That the statute lists domestic violence as
grounds for departure only when combined with some other aggravating
factor suggests it could not. See $$ 9.94A.390(2)(h)(i)-(iii).

542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

305Cite as: 542 U. S. 296 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
at 82; cf. Harris, supra, at 567. Williams involved anindeterminate-sentencing regime that allowed a judge (but

did not compel him) to rely on facts outside the trial recordin determining whether to sentence a defendant to death.
337 U. S., at 242-243, and n. 2. The judge could have "sen-tenced [the defendant] to death giving no reason at all." Id.,
at 252. Thus, neither case involved a sentence greater thanwhat state law authorized on the basis of the verdict alone.

Finally, the State tries to distinguish Apprendi and Ringby pointing out that the enumerated grounds for departure
in its regime are illustrative rather than exhaustive. Thisdistinction is immaterial. Whether the judge's authority to
impose an enhanced sentence depends on finding a specifiedfact (as in

Apprendi), one of several specified facts (as inRing), or any aggravating fact (as here), it remains the case

that the jury's verdict alone does not authorize the sentence.The judge acquires that authority only upon finding some
additional fact.8Because the State's sentencing procedure did not comply
with the Sixth Amendment, petitioner's sentence is invalid.9

III
Our commitment to Apprendi in this context reflects notjust respect for longstanding precedent, but the need to give

intelligible content to the right of jury trial. That right is

8 Nor does it matter that the judge must, after finding aggravating facts,
make a judgment that they present a compelling ground for departure.
He cannot make that judgment without finding some facts to support it
beyond the bare elements of the offense. Whether the judicially determined facts require a sentence enhancement or merely allow it, the verdict alone does not authorize the sentence.

9 The United States, as amicus curiae, urges us to affirm. It notes

differences between Washington's sentencing regime and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines but questions whether those differences are constitutionally significant. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25-30.
The Federal Guidelines are not before us, and we express no opinion on
them.

306 BLAKELY v. WASHINGTON

Opinion of the Court
no mere procedural formality, but a fundamental reservationof power in our constitutional structure. Just as suffrage

ensures the people's ultimate control in the legislative andexecutive branches, jury trial is meant to ensure their control in the judiciary. See Letter XV by the Federal Farmer(Jan. 18, 1788), reprinted in 2 The Complete Anti-Federalist
315, 320 (H. Storing ed. 1981) (describing the jury as "secur[ing] to the people at large, their just and rightful controulin the judicial department"); John Adams, Diary Entry (Feb.

12, 1771), reprinted in 2 Works of John Adams 252, 253 (C.Adams ed. 1850) ("[T]he common people, should have as complete a control . . . in every judgment of a court of judicature"
as in the legislature); Letter from Thomas Jefferson to the
Abbe' Arnoux (July 19, 1789), reprinted in 15 Papers of
Thomas Jefferson 282, 283 (J. Boyd ed. 1958) ("Were I called
upon to decide whether the people had best be omitted in
the Legislative or Judiciary department, I would say it is
better to leave them out of the Legislative"); Jones v. United
States, 526 U. S. 227, 244-248 (1999). Apprendi carries out
this design by ensuring that the judge's authority to sentence derives wholly from the jury's verdict. Without that
restriction, the jury would not exercise the control that the
Framers intended.

Those who would reject Apprendi are resigned to one of
two alternatives. The first is that the jury need only find
whatever facts the legislature chooses to label elements of
the crime, and that those it labels sentencing factors--no
matter how much they may increase the punishment--may
be found by the judge. This would mean, for example, that
a judge could sentence a man for committing murder even if
the jury convicted him only of illegally possessing the firearm used to commit it--or of making an illegal lane change
while fleeing the death scene. Not even Apprendi's critics
would advocate this absurd result. Cf. 530 U. S., at 552-553
(O'Connor, J., dissenting). The jury could not function as
circuitbreaker in the State's machinery of justice if it were

Opinion of the Court
relegated to making a determination that the defendant atsome point did something wrong, a mere preliminary to a

judicial inquisition into the facts of the crime the State actu-ally seeks to punish.

10

The second alternative is that legislatures may establishlegally essential sentencing factors within limits--limits

crossed when, perhaps, the sentencing factor is a "tail whichwags the dog of the substantive offense."

McMillan, 477U. S., at 88. What this means in operation is that the law

must not go too far--it must not exceed the judicial estima-tion of the proper role of the judge.

The subjectivity of this standard is obvious. Petitionerargued below that second-degree kidnaping with deliberate
cruelty was essentially the same as first-degree kidnaping,the very charge he had avoided by pleading to a lesser offense. The court conceded this might be so but held it irrel-evant. See 111 Wash. App., at 869, 47 P. 3d, at 158.

11 Petitioner's 90-month sentence exceeded the 53-month standardmaximum by almost 70%; the Washington Supreme Court in

other cases has upheld exceptional sentences 15 times thestandard maximum. See

State v. Oxborrow, 106 Wash. 2d525, 528, 533, 723 P. 2d 1123, 1125, 1128 (1986) (en banc) (15-

at 322. But the many immediate practical advantages of judicial factfinding, see post, at 318-320, suggest that political forces would, if anything,
pull in the opposite direction. In any case, the Framers' decision to entrench the jury-trial right in the Constitution shows that they did not
trust government to make political decisions in this area.

11 Another example of conversion from separate crime to sentence enhancement that Justice O'Connor evidently does not consider going "too
far" is the obstruction-of-justice enhancement, see post, at 319. Why perjury during trial should be grounds for a judicial sentence enhancement
on the underlying offense, rather than an entirely separate offense to be
found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt (as it has been for centuries, see
4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 136-138 (1769)), is
unclear.

standard maximum sentence). Did the court go too far inany of these cases? There is no answer that legal analysis
can provide. With too far as the yardstick, it is always pos-sible to disagree with such judgments and never to refute
them.Whether the Sixth Amendment incorporates this manipulable standard rather than Apprendi's bright-line rule de-pends on the plausibility of the claim that the Framers would
have left definition of the scope of jury power up to judges'intuitive sense of how far is

too far. We think that claimnot plausible at all, because the very reason the Framers put

a jury-trial guarantee in the Constitution is that they wereunwilling to trust government to mark out the role of the
jury. IV

By reversing the judgment below, we are not, as the Statewould have it, "find[ing] determinate sentencing schemes unconstitutional." Brief for Respondent 34. This case is notabout whether determinate sentencing is constitutional, only
about how it can be implemented in a way that respectsthe Sixth Amendment. Several policies prompted Washington's adoption of determinate sentencing, including propor-tionality to the gravity of the offense and parity among
defendants. See Wash. Rev. Code Ann. $ 9.94A.010 (2000).Nothing we have said impugns those salutary objectives.

Justice O'Connor argues that, because determinate-sentencing schemes involving judicial factfinding entail less
judicial discretion than indeterminate schemes, the constitu-tionality of the latter implies the constitutionality of the
former. Post, at 314-323. This argument is flawed on anumber of levels. First, the Sixth Amendment by its terms
is not a limitation on judicial power, but a reservation of jurypower. It limits judicial power only to the extent that the
claimed judicial power infringes on the province of the jury.

Opinion of the Court
Indeterminate sentencing does not do so. It increases judi-cial discretion, to be sure, but not at the expense of the jury's

traditional function of finding the facts essential to lawfulimposition of the penalty. Of course indeterminate schemes
involve judicial factfinding, in that a judge (like a paroleboard) may implicitly rule on those facts he deems important
to the exercise of his sentencing discretion. But the facts
do not pertain to whether the defendant has a legal right toa lesser sentence--and that makes all the difference insofar

as judicial impingement upon the traditional role of the juryis concerned. In a system that says the judge may punish
burglary with 10 to 40 years, every burglar knows he is risking 40 years in jail. In a system that punishes burglary with
a 10-year sentence, with another 30 added for use of a gun,
the burglar who enters a home unarmed is entitled to no
more than a 10-year sentence--and by reason of the Sixth
Amendment the facts bearing upon that entitlement must be
found by a jury.

But even assuming that restraint of judicial power unrelated to the jury's role is a Sixth Amendment objective, it is
far from clear that Apprendi disserves that goal. Determinate judicial-factfinding schemes entail less judicial power
than indeterminate schemes, but more judicial power than
determinate jury-factfinding schemes. Whether Apprendi
increases judicial power overall depends on what States with
determinate judicial-factfinding schemes would do, given the
choice between the two alternatives. Justice O'Connor
simply assumes that the net effect will favor judges, but she
has no empirical basis for that prediction. Indeed, what evidence we have points exactly the other way: When the Kansas Supreme Court found Apprendi infirmities in that State's
determinate-sentencing regime in State v. Gould, 271 Kan.
394, 404-414, 23 P. 3d 801, 809-814 (2001), the legislature
responded not by reestablishing indeterminate sentencing
but by applying Apprendi's requirements to its current regime. See Act of May 29, 2002, ch. 170, 2002 Kan. Sess.

(2003 Cum. Supp.)); Brief for Kansas Appellate Defender Office as Amicus Curiae 3-7. The result was less, not more,
judicial power.

Justice Breyer argues that Apprendi works to the detriment of criminal defendants who plead guilty by depriving
them of the opportunity to argue sentencing factors to a
judge. Post, at 331. But nothing prevents a defendant
from waiving his Apprendi rights. When a defendant
pleads guilty, the State is free to seek judicial sentence enhancements so long as the defendant either stipulates to the
relevant facts or consents to judicial factfinding. See Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 488; Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145,
158 (1968). If appropriate waivers are procured, States may
continue to offer judicial factfinding as a matter of course to
all defendants who plead guilty. Even a defendant who
stands trial may consent to judicial factfinding as to sentence
enhancements, which may well be in his interest if relevant
evidence would prejudice him at trial. We do not understand how Apprendi can possibly work to the detriment of
those who are free, if they think its costs outweigh its benefits, to render it inapplicable.12

12 Justice Breyer responds that States are not required to give defendants the option of waiving jury trial on some elements but not others.
Post, at 335-336. True enough. But why would the States that he asserts we are coercing into hardheartedness--that is, States that want
judge-pronounced determinate sentencing to be the norm but we won't let
them--want to prevent a defendant from choosing that regime? Justice
Breyer claims this alternative may prove "too expensive and unwieldy
for States to provide," post, at 336, but there is no obvious reason why
forcing defendants to choose between contesting all elements of his hypothetical 17-element robbery crime and contesting none of them is less
expensive than also giving them the third option of pleading guilty to
some elements and submitting the rest to judicial factfinding. Justice
Breyer's argument rests entirely on a speculative prediction about the
number of defendants likely to choose the first (rather than the second)
option if denied the third.

Opinion of the Court
Nor do we see any merit to Justice Breyer's contentionthat Apprendi is unfair to criminal defendants because, if

States respond by enacting "17-element robbery crime[s],"prosecutors will have more elements with which to bargain.
Post, at 331, 335-336 (citing Bibas, Judicial Fact-Finding andSentence Enhancements in a World of Guilty Pleas, 110 Yale
L. J. 1097 (2001)). Bargaining already exists with regard tosentencing factors because defendants can either stipulate or
contest the facts that make them applicable. If there is anydifference between bargaining over sentencing factors and
bargaining over elements, the latter probably favors the de-fendant. Every new element that a prosecutor can threaten
to charge is also an element that a defendant can threatento contest at trial and make the prosecutor prove beyond
a reasonable doubt. Moreover, given the sprawling scopeof most criminal codes, and the power to affect sentences
by making (even nonbinding) sentencing recommendations,there is already no shortage of

in terrorem tools at prosecu-tors' disposal. See King & Klein,

Apprendi and Plea Bar-gaining, 54 Stan. L. Rev. 295, 296 (2001) ("Every prosecutorial bargaining chip mentioned by Professor Bibas existedpre-Apprendi exactly as it does post-Apprendi").

Any evaluation of Apprendi's "fairness" to criminal de-fendants must compare it with the regime it replaced, in
which a defendant, with no warning in either his indictmentor plea, would routinely see his maximum potential sentence
balloon from as little as five years to as much as life impris-onment, see 21 U. S. C. $$ 841(b)(1)(A), (D),

13 To be sure, Justice Breyer and the other dissenters would forbid
those increases of sentence that violate the constitutional principle that
tail shall not wag dog. The source of this principle is entirely unclear.
Its precise effect, if precise effect it has, is presumably to require that the
ratio of sentencing-factor add-on to basic criminal sentence be no greater
than the ratio of caudal vertebrae to body in the breed of canine with the
longest tail. Or perhaps no greater than the average such ratio for all
breeds. Or perhaps the median. Regrettably, Apprendi has prevented
full development of this line of jurisprudence.

Opinion of the Court
facts proved to his peers beyond a reasonable doubt, but onfacts extracted after trial from a report compiled by a probation officer who the judge thinks more likely got it right thangot it wrong. We can conceive of no measure of fairness
that would find more fault in the utterly speculative bargain-ing effects

Justice Breyer identifies than in the regime he
champions. Suffice it to say that, if such a measure exists,
it is not the one the Framers left us with.The implausibility of

Justice Breyer's contention that
Apprendi is unfair to criminal defendants is exposed by thelineup of

amici in this case. It is hard to believe that the
National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers was
somehow duped into arguing for the wrong side. Justice
Breyer's only authority asking that defendants be protected from Apprendi is an article written not by a criminal
defense lawyer but by a law professor and former prosecutor.
See post, at 331 (citing Bibas, supra); Association of American Law Schools Directory of Law Teachers 2003-2004,
p. 319.

Justice Breyer also claims that Apprendi will attenuate
the connection between "real criminal conduct and real punishment" by encouraging plea bargaining and by restricting
alternatives to adversarial factfinding. Post, at 334, 338-
339. The short answer to the former point (even assuming
the questionable premise that Apprendi does encourage plea
bargaining, but see supra, at 310, n. 12) is that the Sixth
Amendment was not written for the benefit of those who
choose to forgo its protection. It guarantees the right to
jury trial. It does not guarantee that a particular number
of jury trials will actually take place. That more defendants
elect to waive that right (because, for example, government
at the moment is not particularly oppressive) does not prove
that a constitutional provision guaranteeing availability of
that option is disserved.

Justice Breyer's more general argument--that Apprendi undermines alternatives to adversarial factfinding--

542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

313Cite as: 542 U. S. 296 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
is not so much a criticism of Apprendi as an assault on jury
trial generally. His esteem for "nonadversarial" truthseeking processes, post, at 339, supports just as well an argument against either. Our Constitution and the common-law
traditions it entrenches, however, do not admit the contention that facts are better discovered by judicial inquisition
than by adversarial testing before a jury. See 3 Blackstone,
Commentaries, at 373-374, 379-381. Justice Breyer may
be convinced of the equity of the regime he favors, but his
views are not the ones we are bound to uphold.

Ultimately, our decision cannot turn on whether or to what
degree trial by jury impairs the efficiency or fairness of criminal justice. One can certainly argue that both these values
would be better served by leaving justice entirely in the
hands of professionals; many nations of the world, particularly those following civil-law traditions, take just that
course. There is not one shred of doubt, however, about the
Framers' paradigm for criminal justice: not the civil-law
ideal of administrative perfection, but the common-law ideal
of limited state power accomplished by strict division of authority between judge and jury. As Apprendi held, every
defendant has the right to insist that the prosecutor prove
to a jury all facts legally essential to the punishment.
Under the dissenters' alternative, he has no such right.
That should be the end of the matter.

The judgment of the Washington Court of Appeals is re-versed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.

Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Breyer joins,and with whom

The Chief Justice and Justice Kennedyjoin as to all but Part IV-B, dissenting.

The legacy of today's opinion, whether intended or not,will be the consolidation of sentencing power in the State
and Federal Judiciaries. The Court says to Congress andstate legislatures: If you want to constrain the sentencing
discretion of judges and bring some uniformity to sentencing,it will cost you--dearly. Congress and States, faced with
the burdens imposed by the extension of Apprendi v. New
Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), to the present context, willeither trim or eliminate altogether their sentencing guidelines schemes and, with them, 20 years of sentencing reform.It is thus of little moment that the majority does not expressly declare guidelines schemes unconstitutional, ante, at308; for, as residents of "

Apprendi-land" are fond of saying,"the relevant inquiry is one not of form, but of effect." Apprendi, supra, at 494; Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 613(2002) (

Scalia, J., concurring). The "effect" of today's deci-sion will be greater judicial discretion and less uniformity in

sentencing. Because I find it implausible that the Framerswould have considered such a result to be required by the
Due Process Clause or the Sixth Amendment, and becausethe practical consequences of today's decision may be disastrous, I respectfully dissent.

scheme to appreciate the damage that today's decision willcause. Prior to 1981, Washington, like most other States

and the Federal Government, employed an indeterminatesentencing scheme. Washington's criminal code separated
all felonies into three broad categories: "class A," carryinga sentence of 20 years to life; "class B," carrying a sentence
of 0 to 10 years; and "class C," carrying a sentence of 0 to
5 years. Wash. Rev. Code Ann. $ 9A.20.020 (2000); seealso Sentencing Reform Act of 1981, 1981 Wash. Laws

ch. 137, p. 534. Sentencing judges, in conjunction with pa-role boards, had virtually unfettered discretion to sentence
defendants to prison terms falling anywhere within the statutory range, including probation--i. e., no jail sentence at all.
Wash. Rev. Code Ann. $$ 9.95.010-9.95.011; Boerner & Lieb,
Sentencing Reform in the Other Washington, 28 Crime and
Justice 71, 73 (M. Tonry ed. 2001) (hereinafter Boerner &
Lieb) ("Judges were authorized to choose between prison and
probation with few exceptions, subject only to review for
abuse of discretion"). See also D. Boerner, Sentencing in
Washington $ 2.4, pp. 2-27 to 2-28 (1985).

This system of unguided discretion inevitably resulted in
severe disparities in sentences received and served by defendants committing the same offense and having similar
criminal histories. Boerner & Lieb 126-127; cf. S. Rep.
No. 98-225, p. 38 (1983) (Senate Report on precursor to federal Sentencing Reform Act of 1984) ("[E]very day Federal
judges mete out an unjustifiably wide range of sentences to
offenders with similar histories, convicted of similar crimes,
committed under similar circumstances. . . . These disparities, whether they occur at the time of the initial sentencing
or at the parole stage, can be traced directly to the unfettered discretion the law confers on those judges and parole
authorities responsible for imposing and implementing the
sentence"). Indeed, rather than reflect legally relevant criteria, these disparities too often were correlated with constitutionally suspect variables such as race. Boerner & Lieb

126-128. See also Breyer, The Federal Sentencing Guide-lines and the Key Compromises Upon Which They Rest, 17

Hofstra L. Rev. 1, 5 (1988) (elimination of racial disparity onereason behind Congress' creation of the Federal Sentencing
Commission).To counteract these trends, the state legislature passed
the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981. The Act had thelaudable purposes of "mak[ing] the criminal justice system
accountable to the public," and "[e]nsur[ing] that the punish-ment for a criminal offense is proportionate to the seriousness of the offense . . . [and] commensurate with the pun-ishment imposed on others committing similar offenses."
Wash. Rev. Code Ann. $ 9.94A.010 (2000). The Act neitherincreased any of the statutory sentencing ranges for the
three types of felonies (though it did eliminate the statutorymandatory minimum for class A felonies), nor reclassified
any substantive offenses. 1981 Wash. Laws ch. 137, p. 534.It merely placed meaningful constraints on discretion to sentence offenders within the statutory ranges, and eliminatedparole. There is thus no evidence that the legislature was
attempting to manipulate the statutory elements of criminaloffenses or to circumvent the procedural protections of the
Bill of Rights. Rather, lawmakers were trying to bringsome much-needed uniformity, transparency, and accountability to an otherwise " `labyrinthine' sentencing and correc-tions system that `lack[ed] any principle except unguided discretion.'

Far from disregarding principles of due process and thejury trial right, as the majority today suggests, Washington's

reform has served them. Before passage of the Act, a de-fendant charged with second degree kidnaping, like petitioner, had no idea whether he would receive a 10-year sen542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

O'Connor, J., dissenting
tence or probation. The ultimate sentencing determinationcould turn as much on the idiosyncracies of a particular judge

as on the specifics of the defendant's crime or background.A defendant did not know what facts, if any, about his offense
or his history would be considered relevant by the sentenc-ing judge or by the parole board. After passage of the Act,
a defendant charged with second degree kidnaping knows
what his presumptive sentence will be; he has a good idea ofthe types of factors that a sentencing judge can and will consider when deciding whether to sentence him outside thatrange; he is guaranteed meaningful appellate review to protect against an arbitrary sentence. Boerner & Lieb 93 ("By
consulting one sheet, practitioners could identify the applicable scoring rules for criminal history, the sentencing range,
and the available sentencing options for each case"). Criminal defendants still face the same statutory maximum sentences, but they now at least know, much more than before,
the real consequences of their actions.

Washington's move to a system of guided discretion has
served equal protection principles as well. Over the past 20
years, there has been a substantial reduction in racial disparity in sentencing across the State. Id., at 126 (Racial disparities that do exist "are accounted for by differences in legally
relevant variables--the offense of conviction and prior
criminal record"); id., at 127 ("[J]udicial authority to impose
exceptional sentences under the court's departure authority
shows little evidence of disparity correlated with race").
The reduction is directly traceable to the constraining effects of the guidelines--namely, their "presumptive range[s]"
and limits on the imposition of "exceptional sentences" outside of those ranges. Id., at 128. For instance, sentencing
judges still retain unreviewable discretion in first-time
offender cases and in certain sex offender cases to impose
alternative sentences that are far more lenient than those
contemplated by the guidelines. To the extent that unjustifiable racial disparities have persisted in Washington, it

has been in the imposition of such alternative sentences:"The lesson is powerful: racial disparity is correlated with

unstructured and unreviewed discretion." Ibid.; see alsoWashington State Minority and Justice Commission,
R. Crutchfield, J. Weis, R. Engen, & R. Gainey, Racial/EthnicDisparities and Exceptional Sentences in Washington State,
Final Report 51-53 (Sept. 1993) ("[E]xceptional sentences
are not a major source of racial disparities in sentencing").The majority does not, because it cannot, disagree that determinate sentencing schemes, like Washington's, serve im-portant constitutional values.

Ante, at 308. Thus, the majority says: "This case is not about whether determinate
sentencing is constitutional, only about how it can be implemented in a way that respects the Sixth Amendment."
Ibid. But extension of Apprendi to the present context will
impose significant costs on a legislature's determination that
a particular fact, not historically an element, warrants a
higher sentence. While not a constitutional prohibition on
guidelines schemes, the majority's decision today exacts a
substantial constitutional tax.

The costs are substantial and real. Under the majority's
approach, any fact that increases the upper bound on a
judge's sentencing discretion is an element of the offense.
Thus, facts that historically have been taken into account by
sentencing judges to assess a sentence within a broad
range--such as drug quantity, role in the offense, risk of
bodily harm--all must now be charged in an indictment and
submitted to a jury, In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970), simply because it is the legislature, rather than the judge, that
constrains the extent to which such facts may be used to
impose a sentence within a pre-existing statutory range.

While that alone is enough to threaten the continued use
of sentencing guidelines schemes, there are additional costs.
For example, a legislature might rightly think that some factors bearing on sentencing, such as prior bad acts or criminal
history, should not be considered in a jury's determination of

O'Connor, J., dissenting
a defendant's guilt--such "character evidence" has tradition-ally been off limits during the guilt phase of criminal proceedings because of its tendency to inflame the passions ofthe jury. See,

e. g., Fed. Rule Evid. 404; 1 E. Imwinkelried,
P. Giannelli, F. Gilligan, & F. Lederer, Courtroom CriminalEvidence 285 (3d ed. 1998). If a legislature desires uniform

consideration of such factors at sentencing, but does not want
them to impact a jury's initial determination of guilt, theState may have to bear the additional expense of a separate,

full-blown jury trial during the penalty phase proceeding.Some facts that bear on sentencing either will not be discovered, or are not discoverable, prior to trial. For instance, a legislature might desire that defendants who act in
an obstructive manner during trial or post-trial proceedings
receive a greater sentence than defendants who do not.
See, e. g., United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines
Manual $ 3C1.1 (Nov. 2003) (hereinafter USSG) (2-point increase in offense level for obstruction of justice). In such
cases, the violation arises too late for the State to provide
notice to the defendant or to argue the facts to the jury. A
State wanting to make such facts relevant at sentencing
must now either vest sufficient discretion in the judge to
account for them or bring a separate criminal prosecution
for obstruction of justice or perjury. And, the latter option
is available only to the extent that a defendant's obstructive
behavior is so severe as to constitute an already-existing separate offense, unless the legislature is willing to undertake
the unlikely expense of criminalizing relatively minor obstructive behavior.

Likewise, not all facts that historically have been relevant
to sentencing always will be known prior to trial. For instance, trial or sentencing proceedings of a drug distribution
defendant might reveal that he sold primarily to children.
Under the majority's approach, a State wishing such a revelation to result in a higher sentence within a pre-existing
statutory range either must vest judges with sufficient dis542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

cretion to account for it (and trust that they exercise thatdiscretion) or bring a separate criminal prosecution. Indeed, the latter choice might not be available--a separateprosecution, if it is for an aggravated offense, likely would
be barred altogether by the Double Jeopardy Clause.Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299 (1932) (government cannot prosecute for separate offenses unless each of-fense has at least one element that the other does not).

The majority may be correct that States and the FederalGovernment will be willing to bear some of these costs.
Ante, at 309-310. But simple economics dictate that theywill not, and cannot, bear them all. To the extent that they
do not, there will be an inevitable increase in judicial discre-tion with all of its attendant failings.

Pawling, 23 Wash. App. 226, 228-229, 597 P. 2d 1367, 1369
(1979) (citing second degree kidnaping provision as existedin 1977). Petitioner was informed in the charging document, his plea agreement, and during his plea hearing thathe faced a potential statutory maximum of 10 years in prison.
App. 63, 66, 76. As discussed above, the guidelines served
due process by providing notice to petitioner of the conse-quences of his acts; they vindicated his jury trial right by

informing him of the stakes of risking trial; they servedequal protection by ensuring petitioner that invidious characteristics such as race would not impact his sentence.

Given these observations, it is difficult for me to discern
what principle besides doctrinaire formalism actually motivates today's decision. The majority chides the Apprendi
dissenters for preferring a nuanced interpretation of the Due
Process Clause and Sixth Amendment jury trial guarantee
that would generally defer to legislative labels while acknowledging the existence of constitutional constraints--
what the majority calls "the law must not go too far" approach. Ante, at 307 (emphasis deleted). If indeed the
choice is between adopting a balanced case-by-case approach
that takes into consideration the values underlying the Bill
of Rights, as well as the history of a particular sentencing
reform law, and adopting a rigid rule that destroys everything in its path, I will choose the former. See Apprendi,
530 U. S., at 552-554 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) ("Because I
do not believe that the Court's `increase in the maximum
penalty' rule is required by the Constitution, I would evaluate New Jersey's sentence-enhancement statute by analyzing the factors we have examined in past cases" (citation
omitted)).

But even were one to accept formalism as a principle
worth vindicating for its own sake, it would not explain Apprendi's, or today's, result. A rule of deferring to legislative labels has no less formal pedigree. It would be more

(fact of prior conviction not an element of aggravated recidi-vist offense);

United States v. Watts, 519 U. S. 148 (1997) (per
curiam) (acquittal of offense no bar to consideration of un-derlying conduct for purposes of guidelines enhancement);

not necessarily elements); and it would vest primary authority for defining crimes in the political branches, where it
belongs. Apprendi, supra, at 523-554 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). It also would be easier to administer than the
majority's rule, inasmuch as courts would not be forced to
look behind statutes and regulations to determine whether
a particular fact does or does not increase the penalty to
which a defendant was exposed.

The majority is correct that rigid adherence to such an
approach could conceivably produce absurd results, ante, at
306; but, as today's decision demonstrates, rigid adherence
to the majority's approach does and will continue to produce
results that disserve the very principles the majority purports to vindicate. The pre-Apprendi rule of deference to
the legislature retains a built-in political check to prevent
lawmakers from shifting the prosecution for crimes to the
penalty phase proceedings of lesser included and easier-toprove offenses--e. g., the majority's hypothesized prosecution of murder in the guise of a traffic offense sentencing
proceeding. Ante, at 306. There is no similar check, however, on application of the majority's "any fact that increases the upper bound of judicial discretion" by courts.

O'Connor, J., dissenting
The majority claims the mantle of history and original intent. But as I have explained elsewhere, a handful of state
decisions in the mid-19th century and a criminal procedure
treatise have little if any persuasive value as evidence of
what the Framers of the Federal Constitution intended in
the late 18th century. See Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 525-528
(O'Connor, J., dissenting). Because broad judicial sentencing discretion was foreign to the Framers, id., at 478-479
(citing J. Archbold, Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases
44 (15th ed. 1862)), they were never faced with the constitutional choice between submitting every fact that increases a
sentence to the jury or vesting the sentencing judge with
broad discretionary authority to account for differences in
offenses and offenders.

IV

A

The consequences of today's decision will be as far reaching as they are disturbing. Washington's sentencing system
is by no means unique. Numerous other States have
enacted guidelines systems, as has the Federal Government.
See, e. g., Alaska Stat. $ 12.55.155 (2002); Ark. Code Ann.

$ 16-90-804 (2003 Supp.); Fla. Stat. $ 921.0016 (2003); Kan.
Stat. Ann. $ 21-4701 et seq. (2003); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann.

$ 769.34 (West Supp. 2004); Minn. Stat. $ 244.10 (2002); N. C.
Gen. Stat. $ 15A-1340.16 (Lexis 2003); Ore. Admin. Rule

$ 213-008-0001 (2003); 204 Pa. Code $ 303 et seq. (2004), reproduced following 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. $ 9721 (Purdon
Supp. 2004); 18 U. S. C. $ 3553; 28 U. S. C. $ 991 et seq. Today's decision casts constitutional doubt over them all and, in
so doing, threatens an untold number of criminal judgments.
Every sentence imposed under such guidelines in cases currently pending on direct appeal is in jeopardy. And, despite
the fact that we hold in Schriro v. Summerlin, post, p. 348,
that Ring (and a fortiori Apprendi) does not apply retroactively on habeas review, all criminal sentences imposed

O'Connor, J., dissenting
under the federal and state guidelines since Apprendi wasdecided in 2000 arguably remain open to collateral attack.

See Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 301 (1989) (plurality opin-ion) ("[A] case announces a new rule if the result was not
dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant'sconviction became final").

2

The practical consequences for trial courts, starting today,will be equally unsettling: How are courts to mete out guidelines sentences? Do courts apply the guidelines as to miti-gating factors, but not as to aggravating factors? Do they
jettison the guidelines altogether? The Court ignores thehavoc it is about to wreak on trial courts across the country.

B
It is no answer to say that today's opinion impacts onlyWashington's scheme and not others, such as, for example,

the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. See ante, at 305, n. 9("The Federal Guidelines are not before us, and we express
no opinion on them"); cf. Apprendi, supra, at 496-497 (claim-ing not to overrule Walton, supra, soon thereafter overruled
in Ring); Apprendi, supra, at 497, n. 21 (reserving questionof Federal Sentencing Guidelines). The fact that the Federal Sentencing Guidelines are promulgated by an adminis-trative agency nominally located in the Judicial Branch is
irrelevant to the majority's reasoning. The Guidelines havethe force of law, see Stinson v. United States, 508 U. S.
36 (1993); and Congress has unfettered control to reject or

2 The numbers available from the federal system alone are staggering.
On March 31, 2004, there were 8,320 federal criminal appeals pending in
which the defendant's sentence was at issue. Memorandum from Steven
Schlesinger, Administrative Office of the United States Courts, to Supreme Court Library (June 1, 2004) (available in Clerk of Court's case file).
Between June 27, 2000, when Apprendi was decided, and March 31, 2004,
there have been 272,191 defendants sentenced in federal court. Memorandum, supra. Given that nearly all federal sentences are governed by
the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, the vast majority of these cases are
Guidelines cases.

accept any particular guideline, Mistretta, 488 U. S., at393-394.

The structure of the Federal Guidelines likewise does not,as the Government halfheartedly suggests, provide any
grounds for distinction. Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 27-29. Washington's scheme is almost identical to
the upward departure regime established by 18 U. S. C.

$ 3553(b) and implemented in USSG $ 5K2.0. If anything,the structural differences that do exist make the Federal

Guidelines more vulnerable to attack. The provision struckdown here provides for an increase in the upper bound of the
presumptive sentencing range if the sentencing court finds,
"considering the purpose of [the Act], that there are substantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptional sentence." Wash. Rev. Code Ann. $ 9.94A.120 (2000). The Act
elsewhere provides a nonexhaustive list of aggravating factors that satisfy the definition. $ 9.94A.390. The Court
flatly rejects respondent's argument that such soft constraints, which still allow Washington judges to exercise a
substantial amount of discretion, survive Apprendi. Ante,
at 305. This suggests that the hard constraints found
throughout chapters 2 and 3 of the Federal Sentencing
Guidelines, which require an increase in the sentencing
range upon specified factual findings, will meet the same fate.
See, e. g., USSG $ 2K2.1 (increases in offense level for firearms offenses based on number of firearms involved,
whether possession was in connection with another offense,
whether the firearm was stolen); $ 2B1.1 (increase in offense
level for financial crimes based on amount of money involved,
number of victims, possession of weapon); $ 3C1.1 (general
increase in offense level for obstruction of justice).

Indeed, the "extraordinary sentence" provision struck
down today is as inoffensive to the holding of Apprendi as a
regime of guided discretion could possibly be. The list of
facts that justify an increase in the range is nonexhaustive.
The State's "real facts" doctrine precludes reliance by sen542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tencing courts upon facts that would constitute the elementsof a different or aggravated offense. See Wash. Rev. Code

Ann. $ 9.94A.370(2) (2000) (codifying "real facts" doctrine).If the Washington scheme does not comport with the Constitution, it is hard to imagine a guidelines scheme that would.

What I have feared most has now come to pass: Over20 years of sentencing reform are all but lost, and tens of

thousands of criminal judgments are in jeopardy. Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 549-559 (O'Connor, J., dissenting);

Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice Breyer joins,dissenting.
The majority opinion does considerable damage to ourlaws and to the administration of the criminal justice system
for all the reasons well stated in Justice O'Connor's dis-sent, plus one more: The Court, in my respectful submission,
disregards the fundamental principle under our constitu-tional system that different branches of government "converse with each other on matters of vital common interest."
Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 408 (1989). Asthe Court in

Mistretta explained, the Constitution estab-lishes a system of government that presupposes, not just

" `autonomy' " and " `separateness,' " but also " `interdepend-ence' " and " `reciprocity.' " Id., at 381 (quoting Youngstown
Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 635 (1952) (Jack-son, J., concurring)). Constant, constructive discourse between our courts and our legislatures is an integral andadmirable part of the constitutional design. Case-by-case
judicial determinations often yield intelligible patterns thatcan be refined by legislatures and codified into statutes or
rules as general standards. As these legislative enactmentsare followed by incremental judicial interpretation, the legis542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
latures may respond again, and the cycle repeats. This re-curring dialogue, an essential source for the elaboration and

the evolution of the law, is basic constitutional theory inaction.

Sentencing guidelines are a prime example of this collabo-rative process. Dissatisfied with the wide disparity in sentencing, participants in the criminal justice system, including
judges, pressed for legislative reforms. In response, legisla-tors drew from these participants' shared experiences and

enacted measures to correct the problems, which, as Justice
O'Connor explains, could sometimes rise to the level of a
constitutional injury. As Mistretta recognized, this interchange among different actors in the constitutional scheme
is consistent with the Constitution's structural protections.

To be sure, this case concerns the work of a state legislature, and not of Congress. If anything, however, this
distinction counsels even greater judicial caution. Unlike
Mistretta, the case here implicates not just the collective
wisdom of legislators on the other side of the continuing dialogue over fair sentencing, but also the interest of the States
to serve as laboratories for innovation and experiment. See
New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 311 (1932)
(Brandeis, J., dissenting). With no apparent sense of irony
that the effect of today's decision is the destruction of a sentencing scheme devised by democratically elected legislators,
the majority shuts down alternative, nonjudicial, sources of
ideas and experience. It does so under a faintly disguised
distrust of judges and their purported usurpation of the
jury's function in criminal trials. It tells not only trial
judges who have spent years studying the problem but also
legislators who have devoted valuable time and resources
"calling upon the accumulated wisdom and experience of the
Judicial Branch . . . on a matter uniquely within the ken
of judges," Mistretta, supra, at 412, that their efforts and
judgments were all for naught. Numerous States that have
enacted sentencing guidelines similar to the one in Washing542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
ton State are now commanded to scrap everything andstart over.

If the Constitution required this result, the majority's de-cision, while unfortunate, would at least be understandable
and defensible. As Justice O'Connor's dissent demon-strates, however, this is simply not the case. For that reason, and because the Constitution does not prohibit the
dynamic and fruitful dialogue between the judicial and legis-lative branches of government that has marked sentencing

reform on both the state and the federal levels for more than20 years, I dissent.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice O'Connor joins,
dissenting.

The Court makes clear that it means what it said in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000). In its view, the
Sixth Amendment says that " `any fact that increases the
penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury.' " Ante, at 301 (quoting
Apprendi, supra, at 490). " `[P]rescribed statutory maximum' " means the penalty that the relevant statute authorizes "solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury
verdict." Ante, at 301, 303 (emphasis deleted). Thus, a
jury must find, not only the facts that make up the crime of
which the offender is charged, but also all (punishmentincreasing) facts about the way in which the offender carried
out that crime.

It is not difficult to understand the impulse that produced
this holding. Imagine a classic example--a statute (or mandatory sentencing guideline) that provides a 10-year sentence for ordinary bank robbery, but a 15-year sentence for
bank robbery committed with a gun. One might ask why it
should matter for jury trial purposes whether the statute (or
guideline) labels the gun's presence (a) a sentencing fact
about the way in which the offender carried out the lesser
crime of ordinary bank robbery, or (b) a factual element of

542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

329Cite as: 542 U. S. 296 (2004)
Breyer, J., dissenting
the greater crime of bank robbery with a gun? If the SixthAmendment requires a jury finding about the gun in the latter circumstance, why should it not also require a jury tofind the same fact in the former circumstance? The two sets
of circumstances are functionally identical. In both in-stances, identical punishment follows from identical factual
findings (related to, e. g., a bank, a taking, a thing-of-value,
force or threat of force, and a gun). The only difference be-tween the two circumstances concerns a legislative (or Sentencing Commission) decision about which label ("sentencingfact" or "element of a greater crime") to affix to one of the
facts, namely, the presence of the gun, that will lead to the
greater sentence. Given the identity of circumstances apart
from the label, the jury's traditional factfinding role, and the
law's insistence upon treating like cases alike, why should
the legislature's labeling choice make an important Sixth
Amendment difference?

The Court in Apprendi, and now here, concludes that it
should not make a difference. The Sixth Amendment's jury
trial guarantee applies similarly to both. I agree with the
majority's analysis, but not with its conclusion. That is to
say, I agree that, classically speaking, the difference between
a traditional sentencing factor and an element of a greater
offense often comes down to a legislative choice about which
label to affix. But I cannot jump from there to the conclusion that the Sixth Amendment always requires identical
treatment of the two scenarios. That jump is fraught with
consequences that threaten the fairness of our traditional
criminal justice system; it distorts historical sentencing or
criminal trial practices; and it upsets settled law on which
legislatures have relied in designing punishment systems.

The Justices who have dissented from Apprendi have written about many of these matters in other opinions. See 530
U. S., at 523-554 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); id., at 555-566
(Breyer, J., dissenting); Harris v. United States, 536 U. S.

risk of some repetition, I shall set forth several of the most
important considerations here. They lead me to conclude
that I must again dissent.

I

The majority ignores the adverse consequences inherent
in its conclusion. As a result of the majority's rule, sentencing must now take one of three forms, each of which risks
either impracticality, unfairness, or harm to the jury trial
right the majority purports to strengthen. This circumstance shows that the majority's Sixth Amendment interpretation cannot be right.

A

A first option for legislators is to create a simple, pure
or nearly pure "charge offense" or "determinate" sentencing
system. See Breyer, The Federal Sentencing Guidelines
and the Key Compromises upon Which They Rest, 17 Hofstra L. Rev. 1, 8-9 (1988). In such a system, an indictment
would charge a few facts which, taken together, constitute a
crime, such as robbery. Robbery would carry a single sentence, say, five years' imprisonment. And every person convicted of robbery would receive that sentence--just as, centuries ago, everyone convicted of almost any serious crime
was sentenced to death. See, e. g., Lillquist, The Puzzling
Return of Jury Sentencing: Misgivings About Apprendi, 82
N. C. L. Rev. 621, 630 (2004).

Such a system assures uniformity, but at intolerable costs.
First, simple determinate sentencing systems impose identical punishments on people who committed their crimes in
very different ways. When dramatically different conduct

542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

331Cite as: 542 U. S. 296 (2004)
Breyer, J., dissenting
ends up being punished the same way, an injustice has taken
place. Simple determinate sentencing has the virtue of
treating like cases alike, but it simultaneously fails to treat
different cases differently. Some commentators have leveled this charge at sentencing guidelines systems themselves. See, e. g., Schulhofer, Assessing the Federal Sentencing Process: The Problem Is Uniformity, Not Disparity,
29 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 833, 847 (1992) (arguing that the "most
important problem under the Guidelines system is not too
much disparity, but rather excessive uniformity" and arguing
for adjustments, including elimination of mandatory minimums, to make the Guidelines system more responsive to
relevant differences). The charge is doubly applicable to
simple "pure charge" systems that permit no departures
from the prescribed sentences, even in extraordinary cases.

Second, in a world of statutorily fixed mandatory sentences for many crimes, determinate sentencing gives tremendous power to prosecutors to manipulate sentences
through their choice of charges. Prosecutors can simply
charge, or threaten to charge, defendants with crimes bearing higher mandatory sentences. Defendants, knowing that
they will not have a chance to argue for a lower sentence in
front of a judge, may plead to charges that they might otherwise contest. Considering that most criminal cases do not
go to trial and resolution by plea bargaining is the norm,
the rule of Apprendi, to the extent it results in a return to
determinate sentencing, threatens serious unfairness. See
Bibas, Judicial Fact-Finding and Sentence Enhancements in
a World of Guilty Pleas, 110 Yale L. J. 1097, 1100-1101 (2001)
(explaining that the rule of Apprendi hurts defendants by
depriving them of sentencing hearings, "the only hearings
they were likely to have"; forcing defendants to surrender
sentencing issues like drug quantity when they agree to the
plea; and transferring power to prosecutors).

Breyer, J., dissenting

B
A second option for legislators is to return to a system ofindeterminate sentencing, such as California had before the

recent sentencing reform movement. See Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 820 (1991) ("With the increasing impor-tance of probation, as opposed to imprisonment, as a part

of the penological process, some States such as Californiadeveloped the `indeterminate sentence,' where the time of
incarceration was left almost entirely to the penological au-thorities rather than to the courts"); Thompson, Navigating
the Hidden Obstacles to Ex-Offender Reentry, 45 BostonCollege L. Rev. 255, 267 (2004) ("In the late 1970s, California
switched from an indeterminate criminal sentencing schemeto determinate sentencing"). Under indeterminate systems, the length of the sentence is entirely or almost entirelywithin the discretion of the judge or of the parole board,
which typically has broad power to decide when to releasea prisoner.

When such systems were in vogue, they were criticized,and rightly so, for producing unfair disparities, including
race-based disparities, in the punishment of similarly situ-ated defendants. See,

e. g., ante, at 315-316 (O'Connor, J.,dissenting) (citing sources). The length of time a person

spent in prison appeared to depend on "what the judge atefor breakfast" on the day of sentencing, on which judge
you got, or on other factors that should not have madea difference to the length of the sentence. See Breyer,
supra, at 4-5 (citing congressional and expert studies indi-cating that, before the United States Sentencing Commission
Guidelines were promulgated, punishments for identicalcrimes in the Second Circuit ranged from 3 to 20 years' imprisonment and that sentences varied depending upon re-gion, gender of the defendant, and race of the defendant).
And under such a system, the judge could vary the sentencegreatly based upon his findings about how the defendant had
committed the crime--findings that might not have been

made by a "preponderance of the evidence," much less "be-yond a reasonable doubt." See McMillan, 477 U. S., at 91

("Sentencing courts have traditionally heard evidence andfound facts without any prescribed burden of proof at all"
(citing Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241 (1949))).Returning to such a system would diminish the " `reason' "
the majority claims it is trying to uphold. Ante, at 302(quoting 1 J. Bishop, Criminal Procedure $ 87, p. 55 (2d ed.
1872)). It also would do little to "ensur[e] [the] control" ofwhat the majority calls "the peopl[e,]"

i. e., the jury, "in thejudiciary," ante, at 306, since "the peopl[e]" would only decide the defendant's guilt, a finding with no effect on theduration of the sentence. While "the judge's authority to
sentence" would formally derive from the jury's verdict, thejury would exercise little or no control over the sentence
itself. Ibid. It is difficult to see how such an outcome pro-tects the structural safeguards the majority claims to be
defending. C

A third option is that which the Court seems to believelegislators will in fact take. That is the option of retaining
structured schemes that attempt to punish similar conductsimilarly and different conduct differently, but modifying
them to conform to Apprendi's dictates. Judges would beable to depart

downward from presumptive sentences uponfinding that mitigating factors were present, but would not

be able to depart upward unless the prosecutor charged theaggravating fact to a jury and proved it beyond a reasonable
doubt. The majority argues, based on the single example ofKansas, that most legislatures will enact amendments along
these lines in the face of the oncoming Apprendi train. Seeante, at 309-310 (citing State v. Gould, 271 Kan. 394, 404-414,

worth exploring how this option could work in practice, aswell as the assumptions on which it depends.

1
This option can be implemented in one of two ways. Thefirst way would be for legislatures to subdivide each crime

into a list of complex crimes, each of which would be definedto include commonly found sentencing factors such as drug
quantity, type of victim, presence of violence, degree of in-jury, use of gun, and so on. A legislature, for example,
might enact a robbery statute, modeled on robbery sentenc-ing guidelines, that increases punishment depending upon
(1) the nature of the institution robbed, (2) the (a) presenceof, (b) brandishing of, (c) other use of, a firearm, (3) making
of a death threat, (4) presence of (a) ordinary, (b) serious,(c) permanent or life threatening, bodily injury, (5) abduction,
(6) physical restraint, (7) taking of a firearm, (8) taking ofdrugs, (9) value of property loss, etc. Cf. United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 2B3.1 (Nov. 2003)(hereinafter USSG).

This possibility is, of course, merely a highly calibratedform of the "pure charge" system discussed in Part I-A,
supra. And it suffers from some of the same defects. Theprosecutor, through control of the precise charge, controls
the punishment, thereby marching the sentencing system di-rectly away from, not toward, one important guideline goal:
rough uniformity of punishment for those who engage inroughly the same real criminal conduct. The artificial (and
consequently unfair) nature of the resulting sentence is ag-gravated by the fact that prosecutors must charge all relevant facts about the way the crime was committed beforea presentence investigation examines the criminal conduct,
perhaps before the trial itself, i. e., before many of the factsrelevant to punishment are known.

This "complex charge offense" system also prejudices de-fendants who seek trial, for it can put them in the untenable

position of contesting material aggravating facts in the guiltphases of their trials. Consider a defendant who is charged,

not with mere possession of cocaine, but with the specificoffense of possession of more than 500 grams of cocaine. Or
consider a defendant charged, not with murder, but with thenew crime of murder using a machete. Or consider a defendant who the prosecution wants to claim was a "supervisor," rather than an ordinary gang member. How can aConstitution that guarantees due process put these defendants, as a matter of course, in the position of arguing, "I didnot sell drugs, and if I did, I did not sell more than 500
grams," or "I did not kill him, and if I did, I did not use a
machete," or "I did not engage in gang activity, and certainly
not as a supervisor" to a single jury? See Apprendi, 530
U. S., at 557-558 (Breyer, J., dissenting); Monge, 524 U. S.,
at 729. The system can tolerate this kind of problem up
to a point (consider the defendant who wants to argue innocence, and, in the alternative, second-degree, not firstdegree, murder). But a rereading of the many distinctions
made in a typical robbery guideline, see supra, at 334, suggests that an effort to incorporate any real set of guidelines
in a complex statute would reach well beyond that point.

The majority announces that there really is no problem
here because "States may continue to offer judicial factfinding as a matter of course to all defendants who plead guilty"
and defendants may "stipulat[e] to the relevant facts or consen[t] to judicial factfinding." Ante, at 310. The problem,
of course, concerns defendants who do not want to plead
guilty to those elements that, until recently, were commonly
thought of as sentencing factors. As to those defendants,
the fairness problem arises because States may very well
decide that they will not permit defendants to carve subsets
of facts out of the new, Apprendi-required 17-element robbery crime, seeking a judicial determination as to some of
those facts and a jury determination as to others. Instead,
States may simply require defendants to plead guilty to all

336 BLAKELY v. WASHINGTON

Breyer, J., dissenting
17 elements or proceed with a (likely prejudicial) trial on all
17 elements.

The majority does not deny that States may make this
choice; it simply fails to understand why any State would
want to exercise it. Ante, at 310, n. 12. The answer is, as
I shall explain in a moment, that the alternative may prove
too expensive and unwieldy for States to provide. States
that offer defendants the option of judicial factfinding as to
some facts (i. e., sentencing facts), say, because of fairness
concerns, will also have to offer the defendant a second sentencing jury--just as Kansas has done. I therefore turn to
that alternative.

The second way to make sentencing guidelines Apprendicompliant would be to require at least two juries for each
defendant whenever aggravating facts are present: one jury
to determine guilt of the crime charged, and an additional
jury to try the disputed facts that, if found, would aggravate
the sentence. Our experience with bifurcated trials in the
capital punishment context suggests that requiring them for
run-of-the-mill sentences would be costly, both in money and
in judicial time and resources. Cf. Kozinski & Gallagher,
Death: The Ultimate Run-On Sentence, 46 Case W. Res.
L. Rev. 1, 13-15, and n. 64 (1995) (estimating the costs of each
capital case at around $1 million more than each noncapital
case); Tabak, How Empirical Studies Can Affect Positively
the Politics of the Death Penalty, 83 Cornell L. Rev. 1431,
1439-1440 (1998) (attributing the greater cost of death penalty cases in part to bifurcated proceedings). In the context
of noncapital crimes, the potential need for a second indictment alleging aggravating facts, the likely need for formal
evidentiary rules to prevent prejudice, and the increased difficulty of obtaining relevant sentencing information, all will
mean greater complexity, added cost, and further delay. See
Part V, infra. Indeed, cost and delay could lead legislatures

to revert to the complex charge offense system described inPart I-C-1,

supra.
The majority refers to an amicus curiae brief filed by theKansas Appellate Defender Office, which suggests that a

two-jury system has proved workable in Kansas. Ante, at309-310. And that may be so. But in all likelihood, any
such workability reflects an uncomfortable fact, a fact at
which the majority hints, ante, at 310, but whose constitu-tional implications it does not seem to grasp. The uncomfortable fact that could make the system seem workable--even desirable in the minds of some, including defense
attorneys--is called "plea bargaining." See Bibas, 110 Yale
L. J., at 1150, and n. 330 (reporting that in 1996, fewer than
4% of adjudicated state felony defendants have jury trials,
5% have bench trials, and 91% plead guilty). See also ante,
at 310 (making clear that plea bargaining applies). The
Court can announce that the Constitution requires at least
two jury trials for each criminal defendant--one for guilt,
another for sentencing--but only because it knows full well
that more than 90% of defendants will not go to trial even
once, much less insist on two or more trials.

What will be the consequences of the Court's holding for
the 90% of defendants who do not go to trial? The truthful
answer is that we do not know. Some defendants may receive bargaining advantages if the increased cost of the "double jury trial" guarantee makes prosecutors more willing to
cede certain sentencing issues to the defense. Other defendants may be hurt if a "single-jury-decides-all" approach
makes them more reluctant to risk a trial--perhaps because
they want to argue that they did not know what was in the
cocaine bag, that it was a small amount regardless, that they
were unaware a confederate had a gun, etc. See Bibas, 110
Yale L. J., at 1100 ("Because for many defendants going to
trial is not a desirable option, they are left without any real
hearings at all"); id., at 1151 ("The trial right does little good
when most defendants do not go to trial").

Breyer, J., dissenting
At the least, the greater expense attached to trials andtheir greater complexity, taken together in the context of an

overworked criminal justice system, will likely mean, otherthings being equal, fewer trials and a greater reliance upon
plea bargaining--a system in which punishment is set not byjudges or juries but by advocates acting under bargaining
constraints. At the same time, the greater power of the
prosecutor to control the punishment through the chargewould likely weaken the relation between real conduct and

real punishment as well. See, e. g., Schulhofer, 29 Am. Crim.L. Rev., at 845 (estimating that evasion of the proper sentence under the Federal Guidelines may now occur in 20%-
35% of all guilty plea cases). Even if the Court's holding
does not further embed plea-bargaining practices (as I fear
it will), its success depends upon the existence of present
practice. I do not understand how the Sixth Amendment
could require a sentencing system that will work in practice
only if no more than a handful of defendants exercise their
right to a jury trial.

The majority's only response is to state that "bargaining
over elements . . . probably favors the defendant," ante,
at 311, adding that many criminal defense lawyers favor its
position, ante, at 312. But the basic problem is not one of
"fairness" to defendants or, for that matter, "fairness" to
prosecutors. Rather, it concerns the greater fairness of a
sentencing system that a more uniform correspondence between real criminal conduct and real punishment helps to
create. At a minimum, a two-jury system, by preventing a
judge from taking account of an aggravating fact without
the prosecutor's acquiescence, would undercut, if not nullify,
legislative efforts to ensure through guidelines that punishments reflect a convicted offender's real criminal conduct,
rather than that portion of the offender's conduct that a
prosecutor decides to charge and prove.

Efforts to tie real punishment to real conduct are not new.
They are embodied in well-established preguidelines sen542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
tencing practices--practices under which a judge, looking ata presentence report, would seek to tailor the sentence in

significant part to fit the criminal conduct in which the of-fender actually engaged. For more than a century, questions of punishment (not those of guilt or innocence) havereflected determinations made, not only by juries, but also
by judges, probation officers, and executive parole boards.Such truthseeking determinations have rested upon both
adversarial and nonadversarial processes. The Court'sholding undermines efforts to reform these processes, for it
means that legislatures cannot both permit judges to basesentencing upon real conduct

and seek, through guidelines,to make the results more uniform.

In these and other ways, the two-jury system would worka radical change in pre-existing criminal law. It is not surprising that this Court has never previously suggested thatthe Constitution--outside the unique context of the death
penalty--might require bifurcated jury-based sentencing.And it is the impediment the Court's holding poses to legislative efforts to achieve that greater systematic fairness thatcasts doubt on its constitutional validity.

D
Is there a fourth option? Perhaps. Congress and statelegislatures might, for example, rewrite their criminal codes,

attaching astronomically high sentences to each crime, fol-lowed by long lists of mitigating facts, which, for the most
part, would consist of the absence of aggravating facts. Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 541-542 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (ex-plaining how legislatures can evade the majority's rule by

making yet another labeling choice). But political impedi-ments to legislative action make such rewrites difficult to
achieve; and it is difficult to see why the Sixth Amendmentwould require legislatures to undertake them.

It may also prove possible to find combinations of, or varia-tions upon, my first three options. But I am unaware of any

variation that does not involve (a) the shift of power to theprosecutor (weakening the connection between real conduct

and real punishment) inherent in any charge offense system,(b) the lack of uniformity inherent in any system of pure
judicial discretion, or (c) the complexity, expense, and in-creased reliance on plea bargains involved in a "two-jury"
system. The simple fact is that the design of any fair sen-tencing system must involve efforts to make practical compromises among competing goals. The majority's reading ofthe Sixth Amendment makes the effort to find those compromises--already difficult--virtually impossible.

II
The majority rests its conclusion in significant part upon aclaimed historical (and therefore constitutional) imperative.

According to the majority, the rule it applies in this case isrooted in "longstanding tenets of common-law criminal jurisprudence," ante, at 301: that every accusation against a de-fendant must be proved to a jury and that " `an accusation
which lacks any particular fact which the law makes essen-tial to the punishment is . . . no accusation within the requirements of the common law, and it is no accusation in reason,' "ante, at 301-302 (quoting Bishop, Criminal Procedure $ 87, at
55). The historical sources upon which the majority relies,however, do not compel the result it reaches. See

ante, at323 (O'C
onnor, J., dissenting); Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 525-528 (O'C
onnor, J., dissenting). The quotation from Bishop,to which the majority attributes great weight, stands for

nothing more than the "unremarkable proposition" thatwhere a legislature passes a statute setting forth heavier
penalties than were available for committing a common-lawoffense and specifying those facts that triggered the statutory penalty, "a defendant could receive the greater statu-tory punishment only if the indictment expressly charged
and the prosecutor proved the facts that made up the statu-tory offense, as opposed to simply those facts that made up

the common-law offense." Id., at 526 (O'Connor, J., dissent-ing) (characterizing a similar statement of the law in J. Archbold, Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases 51, 188 (15thed. 1862)).

This is obvious when one considers the problem thatBishop was addressing. He provides as an example "statutes whereby, when [a common-law crime] is committed with
a particular intent, or with a particular weapon, or the like,it is subjected to a particular corresponding punishment,

heavier than that for" the simple common-law offense(though, of course, his concerns were not "

limited to that
example," ante, at 302, n. 5). Bishop, supra, $ 82, at 51-52
(discussing the example of common assault and enhancedassault statutes, e. g., "assaults committed with the intent to
rob"). That indictments historically had to charge all of the
statutorily labeled elements of the offense is a proposition
on which all can agree. See Apprendi, supra, at 526-527
(O'Connor, J., dissenting). See also J. Archbold, Pleading
and Evidence in Criminal Cases 44 (11th ed. 1849) ("[E]very
fact or circumstance which is a necessary ingredient in the
offence must be set forth in the indictment" so that "there
may be no doubt as to the judgment which should be given,
if the defendant be convicted"); 1 T. Starkie, Criminal Pleading 68 (2d ed. 1822) (the indictment must state "the criminal
nature and degree of the offence, which are conclusions of
law from the facts; and also the particular facts and circumstances which render the defendant guilty of that offence").

Neither Bishop nor any other historical treatise writer,
however, disputes the proposition that judges historically
had discretion to vary the sentence, within the range provided by the statute, based on facts not proved at the trial.
See Bishop, supra, $ 85, at 54 ("[W]ithin the limits of any
discretion as to the punishment which the law may have allowed, the judge, when he pronounces sentence, may suffer
his discretion to be influenced by matter shown in aggravation or mitigation, not covered by the allegations of the in542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

dictment"); K. Stith & J. Cabranes, Fear of Judging: Sentenc-ing Guidelines in the Federal Courts 9 (1998). The modern

history of preguidelines sentencing likewise indicates thatjudges had broad discretion to set sentences within a statutory range based on uncharged conduct. Usually, the judgebased his or her sentencing decision on facts gleaned from a
presentence report, which the defendant could dispute at a
sentencing hearing. In the federal system, for example,Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 provided that probation officers, who are employees of the Judicial Branch, pre-pared a presentence report for the judge, a copy of which
was generally given to the prosecution and defense before
the sentencing hearing. See Stith & Cabranes, supra, at
79-80, 221, n. 5. See also ante, at 315 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (describing the State of Washington's former indeterminate sentencing law).

In this case, the statute provides that kidnaping may be
punished by up to 10 years' imprisonment. Wash. Rev. Code
Ann. $$ 9A.40.030(3), 9A.20.021(1)(b) (2000). Modern structured sentencing schemes like Washington's do not change
the statutorily fixed maximum penalty, nor do they purport
to establish new elements for the crime. Instead, they undertake to structure the previously unfettered discretion of
the sentencing judge, channeling and limiting his or her discretion even within the statutory range. (Thus, contrary to
the majority's arguments, ante, at 308-309, kidnapers in the
State of Washington know that they risk up to 10 years' imprisonment, but they also have the benefit of additional information about how long--within the 10-year maximum--their
sentences are likely to be, based on how the kidnaping was
committed.)

Historical treatises do not speak to such a practice because
it was not done in the 19th century. Cf. Jones, 526 U. S., at
244 ("[T]he scholarship of which we are aware does not show
that a question exactly like this one was ever raised and
resolved in the period before the framing"). This makes

Breyer, J., dissenting
sense when one considers that, prior to the 19th century, the
prescribed penalty for felonies was often death, which the
judge had limited, and sometimes no, power to vary. See
Lillquist, 82 N. C. L. Rev., at 628-630. The 19th century
saw a movement to a rehabilitative mode of punishment in
which prison terms became a norm, shifting power to the
judge to impose a longer or shorter term within the statutory maximum. See ibid. The ability of legislatures to
guide the judge's discretion by designating presumptive
ranges, while allowing the judge to impose a more or less
severe penalty in unusual cases, was therefore never considered. To argue otherwise, the majority must ignore the significant differences between modern structured sentencing
schemes and the history on which it relies to strike them
down. And while the majority insists that the historical
sources, particularly Bishop, should not be "limited" to the
context in which they were written, ante, at 302, n. 5, it has
never explained why the Court must transplant those discussions to the very different context of sentencing schemes
designed to structure judges' discretion within a statutory
sentencing range.

Given history's silence on the question of laws that structure a judge's discretion within the range provided by the
legislatively labeled maximum term, it is not surprising that
our modern, pre-Apprendi cases made clear that legislatures
could, within broad limits, distinguish between "sentencing
facts" and "elements of crimes." See McMillan, 477 U. S.,
at 85-88. By their choice of label, legislatures could indicate
whether a judge or a jury must make the relevant factual
determination. History does not preclude legislatures from
making this decision. And, as I argued in Part I, supra,
allowing legislatures to structure sentencing in this way has
the dual effect of enhancing and giving meaning to the Sixth
Amendment's jury trial right as to core crimes, while affording additional due process to defendants in the form of sen542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN
344 BLAKELY v. WASHINGTON

Breyer, J., dissenting
tencing hearings before judges--hearings the majority's rulewill eliminate for many.

Is there a risk of unfairness involved in permitting Con-gress to make this labeling decision? Of course. As we
have recognized, the "tail" of the sentencing fact might"wa[g] the dog of the substantive offense." McMillan,
supra, at 88. Congress might permit a judge to sentence anindividual for murder though convicted only of making an
illegal lane change. See ante, at 306 (majority opinion).But that is the kind of problem that the Due Process Clause
is well suited to cure. McMillan foresaw the possibilitythat judges would have to use their own judgment in dealing
with such a problem; but that is what judges are there for.And, as Part I,

supra, makes clear, the alternatives areworse--not only practically, but, although the majority refuses to admit it, constitutionally as well.Historic practice, then, does not compel the result the
majority reaches. And constitutional concerns counsel theopposite.

III
The majority also overlooks important institutional consid-erations. Congress and the States relied upon what they

believed was their constitutional power to decide, withinbroad limits, whether to make a particular fact (a) a sentencing factor or (b) an element in a greater crime. They reliedupon McMillan as guaranteeing the constitutional validity
of that proposition. They created sentencing reform, an ef-fort to change the criminal justice system so that it reflects
systematically not simply upon guilt or innocence but alsoupon what should be done about this now-guilty offender.
Those efforts have spanned a generation. They have led tostate sentencing guidelines and the Federal Sentencing
Guidelines system. E. g., ante, at 314-318 (O'Connor, J.,dissenting) (describing sentencing reform in the State of
Washington). These systems are imperfect and they yieldfar from perfect results, but I cannot believe the Constitu542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
tion forbids the state legislatures and Congress to adopt suchsystems and to try to improve them over time. Nor can I

believe that the Constitution hamstrings legislatures in theway that

Justice O'Connor and I have discussed.

IV
Now, let us return to the question I posed at the outset.Why does the Sixth Amendment permit a jury trial right (in

respect to a particular fact) to depend upon a legislative la-beling decision, namely, the legislative decision to label the
fact a sentencing fact, instead of an element of the crime?The answer is that the fairness and effectiveness of a sentencing system, and the related fairness and effectiveness ofthe criminal justice system itself, depend upon the legislature's possessing the constitutional authority (within dueprocess limits) to make that labeling decision. To restrict
radically the legislature's power in this respect, as the major-ity interprets the Sixth Amendment to do, prevents the legislature from seeking sentencing systems that are consistentwith, and indeed may help to advance, the Constitution's
greater fairness goals.To say this is not simply to express concerns about fairness
to defendants. It is also to express concerns about the seri-ous practical (or impractical) changes that the Court's decision seems likely to impose upon the criminal process; aboutthe tendency of the Court's decision to embed further plea
bargaining processes that lack transparency and too oftenmean nonuniform, sometimes arbitrary, sentencing practices;
about the obstacles the Court's decision poses to legislativeefforts to bring about greater uniformity between real criminal conduct and real punishment; and ultimately about thelimitations that the Court imposes upon legislatures' ability
to make democratic legislative decisions. Whatever thefaults of guidelines systems--and there are many--they are
more likely to find their cure in legislation emerging fromthe experience of, and discussion among, all elements of the

Breyer, J., dissenting
criminal justice community, than in a virtually unchangeableconstitutional decision of this Court.

V
Taken together these three sets of considerations, concern-ing consequences, concerning history, concerning institutional reliance, leave me where I was in Apprendi, i. e., con-vinced that the Court is wrong. Until now, I would have
thought the Court might have limited Apprendi so that itsunderlying principle would not undo sentencing reform efforts. Today's case dispels that illusion. At a minimum,the case sets aside numerous state efforts in that direction.
Perhaps the Court will distinguish the Federal SentencingGuidelines, but I am uncertain how. As a result of today's
decision, federal prosecutors, like state prosecutors, must de-cide what to do next, how to handle tomorrow's case.

Consider some of the matters that federal prosecutorsmust know about, or guess about, when they prosecute their
next case: (1) Does today's decision apply in full force to theFederal Sentencing Guidelines? (2) If so, must the initial
indictment contain all sentencing factors, charged as "ele-ments" of the crime? (3) What, then, are the evidentiary
rules? Can the prosecution continue to use, say, presen-tence reports, with their conclusions reflecting layers of
hearsay? Cf. Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 63, 68(2004) (clarifying the Sixth Amendment's requirement of confrontation with respect to testimonial hearsay). Are the nu-merous cases of this Court holding that a sentencing judge
may consider virtually any reliable information still good lawwhen juries, not judges, are required to determine the matter? See, e. g., United States v. Watts, 519 U. S. 148, 153-157(1997) (per curiam) (evidence of conduct of which the defendant has been acquitted may be considered at sentencing).Cf. Witte v. United States, 515 U. S. 389, 399-401 (1995) (evidence of uncharged criminal conduct used in determiningsentence). (4) How are juries to deal with highly complex

542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

347Cite as: 542 U. S. 296 (2004)

or open-ended Sentencing Guidelines obviously written forapplication by an experienced trial judge? See, e. g., USSG

$ 3B1.1 (requiring a greater sentence when the defendantwas a leader of a criminal activity that involved four or more
participants or was "otherwise extensive" (emphasis added));$$ 3D1.1- 3D1.2 (highly complex "multiple count" rules);

$ 1B1.3 (relevant conduct rules).Ordinarily, this Court simply waits for cases to arise in
which it can answer such questions. But this case affectstens of thousands of criminal prosecutions, including federal
prosecutions. Federal prosecutors will proceed with thoseprosecutions subject to the risk that all defendants in those
cases will have to be sentenced, perhaps tried, anew. Giventhis consequence and the need for certainty, I would not proceed further piecemeal; rather, I would call for further argu-ment on the ramifications of the concerns I have raised. But
that is not the Court's view.For the reasons given, I dissent.

SCHRIRO, DIRECTOR, ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OFCORRECTIONS

v. SUMMERLIN

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 03-526. Argued April 19, 2004--Decided June 24, 2004
Respondent was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death

under Arizona's capital sentencing scheme then in effect, which authorized the trial judge, rather than the jury, to determine the presence of
aggravating circumstances that make the defendant eligible for the
death sentence. The State Supreme Court affirmed on direct review.
While respondent's subsequent federal habeas case was pending in the
Ninth Circuit, this Court decided that Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S.
466, 490, required the existence of an aggravating factor to be proved
to a jury rather than a judge under Arizona's scheme. Ring v. Arizona,
536 U. S. 584, 603-609. The Ninth Circuit invalidated respondent's
death sentence, rejecting the argument that Ring did not apply because
respondent's conviction and sentence had become final on direct review
before Ring was decided.

Held: Ring does not apply retroactively to cases already final on direct

review. Pp. 351-358.

(a) A "new rule" resulting from a decision of this Court applies to
convictions that are already final only in limited circumstances. New
substantive rules generally apply retroactively, but new procedural
rules generally do not--only " `watershed rules of criminal procedure'
implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding" are given retroactive effect. Saffle v. Parks, 494 U. S. 484,
495. Such a rule must be one "without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished." Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288,
313. Pp. 351-353.

(b) Ring's holding is properly classified as procedural. It did not
alter the range of conduct or the class of persons subject to the death
penalty in Arizona, but only the method of determining whether the
defendant engaged in that conduct. Pp. 353-355.

(c) Ring did not announce a watershed rule of criminal procedure.
This Court cannot confidently say that judicial factfinding seriously diminishes accuracy. Pp. 355-358.

350 SCHRIRO v. SUMMERLIN

Opinion of the Court

I
In April 1981, Finance America employee Brenna Baileydisappeared while on a house call to discuss an outstanding

debt with respondent Warren Summerlin's wife. That eve-ning, an anonymous woman (later identified as respondent's
mother-in-law) called the police and accused respondent ofmurdering Bailey. Bailey's partially nude body, her skull
crushed, was found the next morning in the trunk of her car,wrapped in a bedspread from respondent's home. Police arrested respondent and later overheard him make incriminat-ing remarks to his wife.

Respondent was convicted of first-degree murder and sex-ual assault. Arizona's capital sentencing provisions in effect
at the time authorized the death penalty if one of severalenumerated aggravating factors was present. See Ariz.
Rev. Stat. Ann. $$ 13-703(E), (F) (West 1978), as amended byAct of May 1, 1979 Ariz. Sess. Laws ch. 144. Whether those
aggravating factors existed, however, was determined by thetrial judge rather than by a jury. $ 13-703(B). In this case
the judge, after a hearing, found two aggravating factors: aprior felony conviction involving use or threatened use of
violence, $ 13-703(F)(2), and commission of the offense in anespecially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner, $ 13-703(F)(6).
Finding no mitigating factors, the judge imposed the deathsentence. The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed on direct
review. State v. Summerlin, 138 Ariz. 426, 675 P. 2d 686(1983).

Protracted state and federal habeas proceedings followed.While respondent's case was pending in the Ninth Circuit,
we decided Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), and
Ring v. Arizona, supra. In Apprendi, we interpreted theconstitutional due-process and jury-trial guarantees to require that, "[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, anyfact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, andproved beyond a reasonable doubt." 530 U. S., at 490. In

Opinion of the Court
Ring, we applied this principle to a death sentence imposedunder the Arizona sentencing scheme at issue here. We

concluded that, because Arizona law authorized the deathpenalty only if an aggravating factor was present, Apprendi
required the existence of such a factor to be proved to a juryrather than to a judge. 536 U. S., at 603-609.

1 We specifically overruled our earlier decision in Walton v. Arizona,497 U. S. 639 (1990), which had upheld an Arizona death sentence against a similar challenge. 536 U. S., at 609.The Ninth Circuit, relying on

Ring, invalidated respond-ent's death sentence. Summerlin v. Stewart, 341 F. 3d 1082,

1121 (2003) (en banc).2 It rejected the argument that Ringdid not apply because respondent's conviction and sentence
had become final on direct review before Ring was decided.We granted certiorari. 540 U. S. 1045 (2003).

II
When a decision of this Court results in a "new rule," thatrule applies to all criminal cases still pending on direct review. Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, 328 (1987). As toconvictions that are already final, however, the rule applies
only in limited circumstances. New substantive rules gen-erally apply retroactively. This includes decisions that narrow the scope of a criminal statute by interpreting its terms,

1 Because Arizona law already required aggravating factors to be proved
beyond a reasonable doubt, see State v. Jordan, 126 Ariz. 283, 286, 614
P. 2d 825, 828, cert. denied, 449 U. S. 986 (1980), that aspect of Apprendi
was not at issue.

2 Because respondent filed his habeas petition before the effective date

of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat.
1214, the provisions of that Act do not apply. See Lindh v. Murphy, 521
U. S. 320, 336-337 (1997).

3 The State also sought certiorari on the ground that there was no Apprendi violation because the prior-conviction aggravator, exempt from Apprendi under Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998),
was sufficient standing alone to authorize the death penalty. We denied
certiorari on that issue, 540 U. S. 1045 (2003), and express no opinion on it.

352 SCHRIRO v. SUMMERLIN

Opinion of the Court
see Bousley v. United States, 523 U. S. 614, 620-621 (1998),as well as constitutional determinations that place particular

conduct or persons covered by the statute beyond the State'spower to punish, see Saffle v. Parks, 494 U. S. 484, 494-495
(1990); Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 311 (1989) (pluralityopinion).

4 Such rules apply retroactively because they "necessarily carry a significant risk that a defendant stands con-victed of `an act that the law does not make criminal' " or

faces a punishment that the law cannot impose upon him.
Bousley, supra, at 620 (quoting Davis v. United States, 417U. S. 333, 346 (1974)).

New rules of procedure, on the other hand, generally donot apply retroactively. They do not produce a class of persons convicted of conduct the law does not make criminal,but merely raise the possibility that someone convicted with
use of the invalidated procedure might have been acquittedotherwise. Because of this more speculative connection to
innocence, we give retroactive effect to only a small set of" `watershed rules of criminal procedure' implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding."
Saffle, supra, at 495 (quoting Teague, 489 U. S., at 311 (plural-ity opinion)). That a new procedural rule is "fundamental"

in some abstract sense is not enough; the rule must be one"without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished." Id., at 313 (emphasis added). Thisclass of rules is extremely narrow, and "it is unlikely that
any . . . `ha[s] yet to emerge.' " Tyler v. Cain, 533 U. S. 656,667, n. 7 (2001) (quoting Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 243
(1990)).The Ninth Circuit agreed with the State that Ring announced a new rule. 341 F. 3d, at 1108-1109. It neverthe4 We have sometimes referred to rules of this latter type as falling under
an exception to Teague's bar on retroactive application of procedural rules,
see, e. g., Horn v. Banks, 536 U. S. 266, 271, and n. 5 (2002) (per curiam);
they are more accurately characterized as substantive rules not subject
to the bar.

Opinion of the Court
less applied the rule retroactively to respondent's case, relying on two alternative theories: first, that it was substantive
rather than procedural; and second, that it was a "watershed" procedural rule entitled to retroactive effect. We consider each theory in turn.

A

A rule is substantive rather than procedural if it alters the
range of conduct or the class of persons that the law punishes. See Bousley, supra, at 620-621 (rule "hold[s] that
a . . . statute does not reach certain conduct" or "make[s]
conduct criminal"); Saffle, supra, at 495 (rule "decriminalize[s] a class of conduct [or] prohibit[s] the imposition of . . .
punishment on a particular class of persons"). In contrast,
rules that regulate only the manner of determining the defendant's culpability are procedural. See Bousley, supra,
at 620.

Judged by this standard, Ring's holding is properly classified as procedural. Ring held that "a sentencing judge, sitting without a jury, [may not] find an aggravating circumstance necessary for imposition of the death penalty." 536
U. S., at 609. Rather, "the Sixth Amendment requires that
[those circumstances] be found by a jury." Ibid. This holding did not alter the range of conduct Arizona law subjected
to the death penalty. It could not have; it rested entirely on
the Sixth Amendment's jury-trial guarantee, a provision that
has nothing to do with the range of conduct a State may
criminalize. Instead, Ring altered the range of permissible
methods for determining whether a defendant's conduct is
punishable by death, requiring that a jury rather than a
judge find the essential facts bearing on punishment. Rules
that allocate decisionmaking authority in this fashion are
prototypical procedural rules, a conclusion we have reached
in numerous other contexts. See Gasperini v. Center for
Humanities, Inc., 518 U. S. 415, 426 (1996) (Erie doctrine);
Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 280-281

Opinion of the Court
(1994) (antiretroactivity presumption); Dobbert v. Florida,
432 U. S. 282, 293-294 (1977) (Ex Post Facto Clause).

Respondent nevertheless argues that Ring is substantive
because it modified the elements of the offense for which he
was convicted. He relies on our statement in Ring that,
"[b]ecause Arizona's enumerated aggravating factors operate
as `the functional equivalent of an element of a greater offense,' the Sixth Amendment requires that they be found by
a jury." 536 U. S., at 609 (citation omitted); see also Sattazahn v. Pennsylvania, 537 U. S. 101, 111 (2003) (plurality
opinion). The Ninth Circuit agreed, concluding that Ring
"reposition[ed] Arizona's aggravating factors as elements of
the separate offense of capital murder and reshap[ed] the
structure of Arizona murder law." 341 F. 3d, at 1105.

A decision that modifies the elements of an offense is normally substantive rather than procedural. New elements
alter the range of conduct the statute punishes, rendering
some formerly unlawful conduct lawful or vice versa. See
Bousley, 523 U. S., at 620-621. But that is not what Ring
did; the range of conduct punished by death in Arizona was
the same before Ring as after. Ring held that, because Arizona's statutory aggravators restricted (as a matter of state
law) the class of death-eligible defendants, those aggravators
effectively were elements for federal constitutional purposes,
and so were subject to the procedural requirements the Constitution attaches to trial of elements. 536 U. S., at 609.
This Court's holding that, because Arizona has made a certain fact essential to the death penalty, that fact must be
found by a jury, is not the same as this Court's making a
certain fact essential to the death penalty. The former was
a procedural holding; the latter would be substantive. The
Ninth Circuit's conclusion that Ring nonetheless "reshap[ed]
the structure of Arizona murder law," 341 F. 3d, at 1105, is
particularly remarkable in the face of the Arizona Supreme
Court's previous conclusion to the contrary. See State v.

Respondent argues in the alternative that Ring falls underthe retroactivity exception for " `watershed rules of criminal

procedure' implicating the fundamental fairness and accu-racy of the criminal proceeding." Saffle, 494 U. S., at 495
(quoting Teague, 489 U. S., at 311). He offers several rea-sons why juries are more accurate factfinders, including the
tendency of group deliberation to suppress individual eccen-tricities; the jury's protection from exposure to inadmissible
evidence; and its better representation of the common senseof the community. The Ninth Circuit majority added others,
including the claim that a judge might be too acclimated tocapital sentencing and that he might be swayed by political
pressure. 341 F. 3d, at 1109-1116. Respondent furthernotes that common-law authorities praised the jury's factfinding ability. See, e. g., 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries onthe Laws of England 380 (1768);

Georgia v. Brailsford, 3Dall. 1, 4 (1794) ( jury charge of Jay, C. J.).

The question here is not, however, whether the Framersbelieved that juries are more accurate factfinders than
judges (perhaps so--they certainly thought juries were moreindependent, see

Blakely v. Washington, ante, at 305-308).Nor is the question whether juries actually are more accurate factfinders than judges (again, perhaps so). Rather, thequestion is whether judicial factfinding so "seriously dimin5 Respondent also argues that Ring was substantive because our understanding of Arizona law changed. Compare Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S.
584, 602-603 (2002), with Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 496-497
(2000). Even if our understanding of state law changed, however, the
actual content of state law did not. See State v. Ring, 200 Ariz. 267, 279,

Opinion of the Court
ishe[s]" accuracy that there is an " `impermissibly largerisk' " of punishing conduct the law does not reach.

Teague,
supra, at 312-313 (quoting Desist v. United States, 394 U. S.244, 262 (1969) (Harlan, J., dissenting)) (emphasis added).

The evidence is simply too equivocal to support thatconclusion.

First, for every argument why juries are more accurate
factfinders, there is another why they are less accurate.The Ninth Circuit dissent noted several, including juries'

tendency to become confused over legal standards and to beinfluenced by emotion or philosophical predisposition. 341
F. 3d, at 1129-1131 (opinion of Rawlinson, J.) (citing, inter
alia, Eisenberg & Wells, Deadly Confusion: Juror Instructions in Capital Cases, 79 Cornell L. Rev. 1 (1993); Garvey,
The Emotional Economy of Capital Sentencing, 75 N. Y. U.
L. Rev. 26 (2000); and Bowers, Sandys, & Steiner, Foreclosed
Impartiality in Capital Sentencing: Jurors' Predispositions,
Guilt-Trial Experience, and Premature Decision Making, 83
Cornell L. Rev. 1476 (1998)). Members of this Court have
opined that judicial sentencing may yield more consistent results because of judges' greater experience. See Proffitt v.
Florida, 428 U. S. 242, 252 (1976) ( joint opinion of Stewart,
Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). Finally, the mixed reception
that the right to jury trial has been given in other countries,
see Vidmar, The Jury Elsewhere in the World, in World Jury
Systems 421-447 (N. Vidmar ed. 2000), though irrelevant to
the meaning and continued existence of that right under our
Constitution, surely makes it implausible that judicial factfinding so "seriously diminishe[s]" accuracy as to produce
an " `impermissibly large risk' " of injustice. When so many
presumably reasonable minds continue to disagree over
whether juries are better factfinders at all, we cannot confidently say that judicial factfinding seriously diminishes
accuracy.

Our decision in DeStefano v. Woods, 392 U. S. 631 (1968)
(per curiam), is on point. There we refused to give retroac542US2 Unit: $U70 [10-25-06 15:08:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tive effect to Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145 (1968),which applied the Sixth Amendment's jury-trial guarantee

to the States. While DeStefano was decided under our preTeague retroactivity framework, its reasoning is germane.
We noted that, although "the right to jury trial generallytends to prevent arbitrariness and repression[,] . . . `[w]e

would not assert . . . that every criminal trial--or any particular trial--held before a judge alone is unfair or that a de-fendant may never be as fairly treated by a judge as he

would be by a jury.' " 392 U. S., at 633-634 (quoting Duncan, supra, at 158). We concluded that "[t]he values implemented by the right to jury trial would not measurably be
served by requiring retrial of all persons convicted in the
past by procedures not consistent with the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial." 392 U. S., at 634. If under DeStefano a trial held entirely without a jury was not impermissibly inaccurate, it is hard to see how a trial in which a
judge finds only aggravating factors could be.

The dissent contends that juries are more accurate because they better reflect community standards in deciding
whether, for example, a murder was heinous, cruel, or depraved. Post, at 361-362 (opinion of Breyer, J.). But the
statute here does not condition death eligibility on whether
the offense is heinous, cruel, or depraved as determined
by community standards. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 13-
703(F)(6) (West 1978). It is easy to find enhanced accuracy
in jury determination when one redefines the statute's substantive scope in such manner as to ensure that result. The
dissent also advances several variations on the theme that
death is different (or rather, "dramatically different," post,
at 363). Much of this analysis is not an application of
Teague, but a rejection of it, in favor of a broader endeavor
to "balance competing considerations," post, at 362. Even
were we inclined to revisit Teague in this fashion, we would
not agree with the dissent's conclusions. Finally, the dissent
notes that, in DeStefano, we considered factors other than

Breyer, J., dissenting
enhanced accuracy that are no longer relevant after Teague.See post, at 365. But we held in that case that "[a]ll three

factors favor only prospective application of the rule." 392U. S., at 633 (emphasis added). Thus, the result would have
been the same even if enhanced accuracy were the sole crite-rion for retroactivity.

* * *
The right to jury trial is fundamental to our system ofcriminal procedure, and States are bound to enforce the

Sixth Amendment's guarantees as we interpret them. Butit does not follow that, when a criminal defendant has had a
full trial and one round of appeals in which the State faith-fully applied the Constitution as we understood it at the
time, he may nevertheless continue to litigate his claims in-definitely in hopes that we will one day have a change of
heart. Ring announced a new procedural rule that does notapply retroactively to cases already final on direct review.
The contrary judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed, andthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion. It is so ordered.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice
Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

In Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584 (2002), this Court heldthat a jury, not a judge, must make the findings necessary to

6 The dissent distinguishes DeStefano on the ground that "this case involves only a small subclass of defendants deprived of jury trial rights,
the relevant harm within that subclass is more widespread, the administration of justice problem is far less serious, and the reliance interest less
weighty." Post, at 366. But the first, third, and fourth of these points
are irrelevant under Teague, and the second, insofar as it relates to accuracy, is an unsubstantiated assertion. If jury trial significantly enhances
accuracy, we would not have been able to hold as we did in DeStefano that
the first factor--"prevent[ing] arbitrariness and repression," 392 U. S., at
633--did not favor retroactivity.

qualify a person for punishment by death. In my view, thatholding amounts to a "watershed" procedural ruling that a

federal habeas court must apply when considering a constitu-tional challenge to a "final" death sentence--

i. e., a sentence
that was already final on direct review when Ring wasdecided

.
Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989) (plurality opinion),
sets forth the relevant retroactivity criteria. A new proce-dural rule applies retroactively in habeas proceedings if the

new procedure is (1) "implicit in the concept of ordered lib-erty," implicating "fundamental fairness," and (2) "central to
an accurate determination of innocence or guilt," such that
its absence "creates an impermissibly large risk that the innocent will be convicted." Id., at 311-313 (plurality opinion)
(internal quotation marks omitted). In the context of a
death sentence, where the matter is not one of "innocence or
guilt," the second criterion asks whether the new procedure
is "central to an accurate determination" that death is a
legally appropriate punishment. Id., at 313 (emphasis
added). See Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 244 (1990);
O'Dell v. Netherland, 521 U. S. 151, 171, n. 3 (1997) (Stevens, J., dissenting).

The majority does not deny that Ring meets the first criterion, that its holding is "implicit in the concept of ordered
liberty." Cf. Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 499
(2000) (Scalia, J., concurring) (absent Apprendi's rule jury
trial right "has no intelligible content"); Ring, supra, at 610
(Scalia, J., concurring) (Apprendi involves the fundamental
meaning of the jury trial guarantee); Blakely v. Washington,
ante, at 301-302 (tracing Apprendi's conception of the jury
trial right back to Blackstone); Duncan v. Louisiana, 391
U. S. 145, 157-158 (1968) (Sixth Amendment jury trial guarantee is a "fundamental right"). Rather, the majority focuses on whether Ring meets the second criterion: Is its rule
"central to an accurate determination" that death is a legally
appropriate punishment? Teague, supra, at 313.

Breyer, J., dissenting
As I explained in my separate concurrence in Ring, Ibelieve the Eighth Amendment demands the use of a jury

in capital sentencing because a death sentence must reflecta community-based judgment that the sentence constitutes
proper retribution. See 536 U. S., at 614 (opinion concurringin judgment); see also

Harris v. Alabama, 513 U. S. 504, 515-
526 (1995) (Stevens, J., dissenting); Spaziano v. Florida, 468
U. S. 447, 467-490 (1984) (Stevens, J., concurring in part anddissenting in part). And a jury is significantly more likely

than a judge to "express the conscience of the communityon the ultimate question of life or death."

Witherspoon v.
Illinois, 391 U. S. 510, 519 (1968). As Justice Stevens haspointed out:

"Juries--comprised as they are of a fair cross sectionof the community--are more representative institutions
than is the judiciary; they reflect more accurately thecomposition and experiences of the community as a
whole, and inevitably make decisions based on commu-nity values more reliably, than can that segment of the
community that is selected for service on the bench."
Spaziano, supra, at 486-487 (footnote omitted).

On this view of the matter, the right to have jury sentencingin the capital context is both a fundamental aspect of constitutional liberty and also significantly more likely to producean accurate assessment of whether death is the appropriate
punishment.But my view is not the

Ring majority's view. The majority held only that the jury must decide whether the specialaggravating factors that make the offender

eligible for death
are present. 536 U. S., at 603-609. And it rested its decision that a jury, not a judge, must make that determination
upon the Court's Sixth Amendment holding in Apprendi that
"any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the
prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,
and proved beyond a reasonable doubt," 530 U. S., at 490.

Breyer, J., dissenting
In this case, the majority says that Ring's Apprendi-related rule cannot satisfy

Teague's accuracy-enhancing requirement, for two reasons. First, it points out that for"every argument why juries are more accurate factfinders,

there is another why they are less accurate." Ante, at 356.Hence, one cannot say "confidently" that "judicial factfinding
seriously diminishes accuracy." Ibid. (emphasis in original).
Second, it relies on DeStefano v. Woods, 392 U. S. 631 (1968)
(per curiam), the case in which this Court considered
whether Duncan v. Louisiana, supra, which extended theSixth Amendment jury trial guarantee to the States, should

apply retroactively. The Court decided that Duncan should
not have retroactive effect. "If," the majority concludes,
"a trial held entirely without a jury was not impermissibly
inaccurate, it is hard to see how a trial in which a judge finds
only aggravating factors could be." Ante, at 357.

The majority, however, overlooks three additional considerations that lead me to the opposite conclusion.

First, the factfinder's role in determining the applicability
of aggravating factors in a death case is a special role that
can involve, not simply the finding of brute facts, but also the
making of death-related, community-based value judgments.
The leading single aggravator charged in Arizona, for example, requires the factfinder to decide whether the crime was
committed in an "especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner." Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 13-703(F)(6) (West Supp.
2003); see Office of Attorney General, State of Arizona, Capital Case Commission Final Report (2002). Three of the
other four Ring-affected States use a similar aggravator.
See Colo. Rev. Stat. $ 18-1.3-1201(5)( j) (Lexis 2003); Idaho
Code $ 19-2515(9)(e) (Lexis Supp. 2003); Neb. Rev. Stat.

$ 29-2523(1)(d) (1995). Words like "especially heinous, "
"cruel," or "depraved"--particularly when asked in the context of a death sentence proceeding--require reference to
community-based standards, standards that incorporate values. (Indeed, Nebraska's standard explicitly asks the fact542US2 Unit: $U70 [10-25-06 15:08:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
finder to assess the defendant's conduct in light of "ordinary
standards of morality and intelligence." Ibid.) A jury is
better equipped than a judge to identify and to apply those
standards accurately. See supra, at 360.

Second, Teague's basic purpose strongly favors retroactive
application of Ring 's rule. Teague's retroactivity principles
reflect the Court's effort to balance competing considerations. See 489 U. S., at 309-313; Mackey v. United States,
401 U. S. 667, 675 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring in two judgments and dissenting in one); Desist v. United States, 394
U. S. 244, 256 (1969) (Harlan, J., dissenting). On the one
hand, interests related to certain of the Great Writ's basic
objectives--protecting the innocent against erroneous conviction or punishment and assuring fundamentally fair procedures--favor applying a new procedural rule retroactively.
Teague, supra, at 312-313; Mackey, 401 U. S., at 693-694.
So too does the legal system's commitment to "equal justice"--i. e., to "assur[ing] a uniformity of ultimate treatment
among prisoners." Id., at 689.

Where death-sentence-related factfinding is at issue, these
considerations have unusually strong force. This Court has
made clear that in a capital case "the Eighth Amendment
requires a greater degree of accuracy . . . than would be
true in a noncapital case." Gilmore v. Taylor, 508 U. S. 333,
342 (1993). Hence, the risk of error that the law can tolerate is correspondingly diminished. At the same time,
the "qualitative difference of death from all other punishments"--namely, its severity and irrevocability--"requires a
correspondingly greater degree of scrutiny of the capital
sentencing determination" than of other criminal judgments.
California v. Ramos, 463 U. S. 992, 998-999 (1983); see also
Spaziano, 468 U. S., at 468 (Stevens, J., concurring in part
and dissenting in part) (the Eighth Amendment mandates
special safeguards to ensure that death is "a justified response to a given offense"); Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68,

Breyer, J., dissenting
87 (1985) (Burger, C. J., concurring in judgment) ("In capitalcases the finality of the sentence imposed warrants protections that may or may not be required in other cases").Consider, too, the law's commitment to uniformity.
Mackey, supra, at 689. Is treatment "uniform" when twooffenders each have been sentenced to death through the use
of procedures that we now know violate the Constitution--
but one is allowed to go to his death while the other receivesa new, constitutionally proper sentencing proceeding? Outside the capital sentencing context, one might understandthe nature of the difference that the word "finality" implies:
One prisoner is already serving a final sentence, the other's
has not yet begun. But a death sentence is different in that
it seems to be, and it is, an entirely future event--an event
not yet undergone by either prisoner. And in respect to
that event, both prisoners are, in every important respect, in
the same position. I understand there is a "finality-based"
difference. But given the dramatically different nature of
death, that difference diminishes in importance.

Certainly the ordinary citizen will not understand the difference. That citizen will simply witness two individuals,
both sentenced through the use of unconstitutional procedures, one individual going to his death, the other saved, all
through an accident of timing. How can the Court square
this spectacle with what it has called the "vital importance
to the defendant and to the community that any decision to
impose the death sentence be, and appear to be, based on
reason"? Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625, 637-638 (1980)
(internal quotation marks omitted).

Justice Scalia's observation, in his concurring opinion
in Ring, underscores the point. He wrote there that "the
repeated spectacle of a man's going to his death because
a judge found that an aggravating factor existed" would
undermine "our people's traditional . . . veneration for the
protection of the jury in criminal cases." 536 U. S., at 612
(emphasis in original). If that is so, it is equally so whether

364 SCHRIRO v. SUMMERLIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
the judge found that aggravating factor before or after
Ring.

On the other hand, Teague recognizes that important in-terests argue against, and indeed generally forbid, retroactive application of new procedural rules. These interests in-clude the "interest in insuring that there will at some point
be the certainty that comes with an end to litigation"; the
desirability of assuring that "attention will ultimately be fo-cused not on whether a conviction was free from error but

rather on whether the prisoner can be restored to a usefulplace in the community"; and the fact that society does not
have endless resources to spend upon retrials, which (where
witnesses have become unavailable and other evidence stale)
may well produce unreliable results. Mackey, supra, at
690-691 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Teague,
489 U. S., at 308-310. Comity interests and respect for
state autonomy point in the same direction. See id., at 308;
Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 128, n. 33 (1982).

Certain of these interests are unusually weak where capital sentencing proceedings are at issue. Retroactivity here,
for example, would not require inordinate expenditure of
state resources. A decision making Ring retroactive would
affect approximately 110 individuals on death row. Court
Hears Arguments in Latest Death Case, N. Y. L. J., Apr. 20,
2004, p. 5. This number, however large in absolute terms,
is small compared with the approximately 1.2 million individuals presently confined in state prisons. U. S. Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics Bulletin, Prisoner and Jail
Inmates at Midyear 2003, p. 2 (May 2004). Consequently,
the impact on resources is likely to be much less than if
a rule affecting the ordinary criminal process were made
retroactive.

Further, where the issue is "life or death," the concern
that "attention . . . ultimately" should be focused "on whether
the prisoner can be restored to a useful place in the community" is barely relevant. Mackey, 401 U. S., at 690 (internal

542US2 Unit: $U70 [10-25-06 15:08:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
quotation marks omitted). Finally, I believe we should discount ordinary finality interests in a death case, for those
interests are comparative in nature and death-related collateral proceedings, in any event, may stretch on for many
years regardless. Cf. Teague, supra, at 321, n. 3 (Stevens,
J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ("A major
reason that Justice Harlan espoused limited retroactivity in
collateral proceedings was the interest in making convictions
final, an interest that is wholly inapplicable to the capital
sentencing context").

Third, DeStefano v. Woods, 392 U. S. 631 (1968) (per curiam), fails to give the majority the support for which it
hopes. DeStefano did decide that Duncan's holding--that
the Sixth Amendment jury trial right applies to the States--
should not have retroactive effect. But the Court decided
DeStefano before Teague. And it explicitly took into account "(a) the purpose to be served by the new standards,
(b) the extent of the reliance by law enforcement authorities
on the old standards, and (c) the effect on the administration
of justice of a retroactive application of the new standards."
392 U. S., at 633 (internal quotation marks omitted).

The latter two factors, "reliance" and "effect on the administration of justice," argued strongly against retroactivity.
Retroactivity there, unlike here, would have thrown the
prison doors open wide--at least in Louisiana and possibly
in other States as well. Id., at 634. The Court believed
that the first factor--"the purpose to be served by the new
standards"--also favored prospective application only. But
the Court described that purpose broadly, as "prevent[ing] arbitrariness and repression"; it recognized that some
judge-only trials might have been fair; and it concluded that
the values served by the jury trial guarantee "would not
measurably be served by requiring retrial of all persons convicted in the past" without a jury. Id., at 633-634 (emphasis added).

366 SCHRIRO v. SUMMERLIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
By contrast, this case involves only a small subclass of de-fendants deprived of jury trial rights, the relevant harm

within that subclass is more widespread, the administrationof justice problem is far less serious, and the reliance interest
less weighty. For these reasons, I believe the DeStefanoCourt would have come out differently had it been considering Ring 's rule. Insofar as DeStefano has any relevancehere, it highlights the importance, when making retroactivity decisions, of taking account of the considerations that un-derlie

Teague's categorical rules. And, as shown above,those considerations argue in favor of retroactivity in this

case. See supra, at 362-365.As I have pointed out, the majority does not deny that
Ring's rule makes some contribution to greater accuracy. Itsimply is unable to say "confidently" that the absence of
Ring's rule creates an " ` "impermissibly large risk" ' " thatthe death penalty was improperly imposed. Ante, at 356.
For the reasons stated, I believe that the risk is one that thelaw need not and should not tolerate. Judged in light of
Teague's basic purpose, Ring's requirement that a jury, andnot a judge, must apply the death sentence aggravators announces a watershed rule of criminal procedure that shouldbe applied retroactively in habeas proceedings.

I respectfully dissent.

367OCTOBER TERM, 2003
Syllabus

CHENEY, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITEDSTATES,

et al. v. UNITED STATES DISTRICTCOURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF

COLUMBIA et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuit

No. 03-475. Argued April 27, 2004--Decided June 24, 2004
The President established the National Energy Policy Development Group

(Group) to give him advice and make recommendations on energy policy,
assigning a number of federal agency heads and assistants to serve as
Group members and authorizing the Vice President, as Group chairman,
to include other federal officers as appropriate. After the Group issued
a final report and, according to the Government, terminated all operations, respondents filed these separate actions, later consolidated in the
District Court, alleging that the Group had not complied with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), which, inter alia, imposes a variety of open-meeting and disclosure requirements on entities meeting the
definition of "advisory committee." As relevant here, such a committee
is an entity or "subgroup . . . , which is . . . established or utilized by
the President, . . . exclud[ing] . . . any committee . . . composed wholly
of full-time, or permanent part-time, [federal] officers or employees." 5
U. S. C. App. $ 2(B)(i). The complaint alleged that, because nonfederal
employees and private lobbyists regularly attended and fully participated in the Group's nonpublic meetings as de facto Group members,
the Group could not benefit from the $ 2(B) exemption and was therefore
subject to FACA's requirements. The suit sought declaratory relief and
an injunction requiring the defendants--including the Vice President
and the Government officials serving on the Group--to produce all materials allegedly subject to FACA's requirements.

Among its rulings, the District Court granted the defendants' motion
to dismiss as to some of them, but denied it as to others. The Court
held that FACA's substantive requirements could be enforced against
the Vice President and the other Government participants under the
Mandamus Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1361, and against the agency defendants
under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. $ 706. It deferred
ruling on whether the FACA disclosure duty was sufficiently clear and
nondiscretionary for mandamus to issue. It also deferred ruling on the
Government's contention that to disregard the $ 2(B) exemption and
apply FACA to the Group would violate separation-of-powers principles

Syllabus
and interfere with the President's and Vice President's constitutional
prerogatives. Instead, the court allowed respondents to conduct a
"tightly-reined" discovery to ascertain the Group's structure and membership, and thus to determine whether the de facto membership doctrine applied. While acknowledging that discovery itself might raise
serious constitutional questions, the court explained that the Government could assert executive privilege to protect sensitive materials
from disclosure. The court noted that if, after discovery, respondents
had no evidentiary support for their allegations about de facto members
in the Group, the Government could prevail on statutory grounds.
Even were it appropriate to address constitutional issues, the court explained, its discovery orders would provide the factual development necessary to determine the extent of the alleged intrusion into the Executive's constitutional authority. The court then ordered respondents to
submit a discovery plan, approved that plan in due course, entered
orders allowing discovery to proceed, and denied the Government's
motion for certification under 28 U. S. C. $ 1292(b) with respect to the
discovery orders.

Petitioners sought a writ of mandamus in the Court of Appeals to
vacate the discovery orders and for other relief, but the court dismissed
the mandamus petition on the ground that alternative avenues of relief
remained available. Citing United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, the
court held that petitioners, in order to guard against intrusion into the
President's prerogatives, must first assert executive privilege with particularity in the District Court. If the lower court sustained the privilege, the appeals court observed, petitioners would be able to obtain
all the relief they sought; but if the District Court rejected the claim,
mandamus might well be appropriate. So long as the separation-ofpowers conflict remained hypothetical, the court held, it had no authority to exercise the extraordinary remedy of mandamus. Although acknowledging that the scope of respondents' discovery requests was
overly broad, the appeals court nonetheless agreed with the District
Court that petitioners should bear the burden of invoking executive
privilege and of objecting to the discovery orders with detailed
precision.

Held:

1. Respondents' preliminary argument that the mandamus petition
was jurisdictionally out of time is rejected. Respondents assert that,
because the Government's basic argument was one of discovery immunity--i. e., it need not invoke executive privilege or make particular objections to the discovery requests--the mandamus petition should have
been filed within 60 days after the District Court denied the motion to

542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
dismiss under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(B). On this
theory, the last day for any filing in the appeals court was September 9,
2002, whereas the mandamus petition and notice of appeal were not filed
until November 7. However, Rule 4(a), by its plain terms, applies only
to the filing of a notice of appeal. It is inapplicable to the mandamus
petition under the All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1651. Respondents' alternative argument that the mandamus petition was barred by the equitable doctrine of laches also fails. Laches might be a bar where the petitioner slept on his rights and especially if the delay was prejudicial.
Chapman v. County of Douglas, 107 U. S. 348, 355. Here, however, the
flurry of motions the Government filed after the District Court denied
the dismissal motion overcomes respondents' argument. Nor does the
Court accept their argument that laches should apply because those
Government motions amounted to little more than dilatory tactics.
Given the drastic nature of mandamus and this Court's holdings that the
writ may not issue while alternative avenues of relief remain available,
the Government cannot be faulted for attempting to resolve the dispute
through less drastic means. Pp. 378-380.

2. The Court of Appeals erred in concluding it lacked authority to
issue mandamus because the Government could protect its rights by
asserting executive privilege in the District Court. Pp. 380-392.

(a) Mandamus is a "drastic and extraordinary" remedy "reserved
for really extraordinary causes." Ex parte Fahey, 332 U. S. 258, 259-
260. While the conditions for obtaining it may be demanding, they are
not insuperable. This Court has issued mandamus to, inter alia, restrain a lower court whose actions would threaten the separation of
powers by embarrassing the Executive Branch. Ex parte Peru, 318
U. S. 578, 588. Were the Vice President not a party, the argument that
the Court of Appeals should have entertained a mandamus action might
present different considerations. Here, however, the Vice President
and his Group comembers are the subjects of the discovery orders. The
mandamus petition alleges that the orders threaten substantial intrusions on the process by which those closest to the President advise him.
These facts and allegations remove this case from the category of ordinary discovery orders where interlocutory appellate review is unavailable, through mandamus or otherwise. A President's communications
and activities encompass a vastly wider range of sensitive material than
would be true of any ordinary individual. Nixon, 418 U. S., at 715.
While the President is not above the law, the Judiciary must afford
Presidential confidentiality the greatest possible protection, ibid., recognizing the paramount necessity of protecting the Executive Branch from
vexatious litigation that might distract it from the energetic performance of its constitutional duties. These separation-of-powers consid542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN
370 CHENEY v. UNITED STATES DIST. COURT FOR D. C.

erations should inform a court of appeals' evaluation of a mandamus
petition involving the President or the Vice President. Accepted mandamus standards are broad enough to allow a court to prevent a lower
court from interfering with a coequal branch's ability to discharge its
constitutional responsibilities. See Ex parte Peru, supra, at 587.
Pp. 380-382.

(b) The Court of Appeals labored under the mistaken assumption
that the assertion of executive privilege is a necessary precondition to
the Government's separation-of-powers objections. In its view, the requirement that the Vice President and his Group colleagues bear the
burden of invoking executive privilege with narrow specificity and objecting to the discovery requests with detailed precision was mandated
by Nixon's rejection of an "absolute, unqualified Presidential privilege
of immunity from judicial process under all circumstances," 418 U. S.,
at 706. The appeals court's analysis overlooks fundamental differences
between this case and Nixon, which cannot bear the weight the court
put on it. Unlike this case, which concerns requests for information
for use in a civil suit, Nixon involved the proper balance between the
Executive's interest in the confidentiality of its communications and the
"constitutional need for production of relevant evidence in a criminal
proceeding." Id., at 713. The distinction between criminal and civil
proceedings is not just a matter of formalism in this context. The right
to production of relevant evidence in civil proceedings does not have the
same "constitutional dimensions" as it does in the criminal context. Id.,
at 711. Withholding necessary materials in an ongoing criminal case
constitutes an impermissible impairment of another branch's "essential
functions." Ibid. Withholding the information in this case does not
hamper such "essential functions" in quite the same way. The District
Court ordered discovery here, not to remedy known statutory violations, but to ascertain whether FACA's disclosure requirements apply
to the Group at all. This situation cannot, in fairness, be compared to
Nixon, where a court's ability to fulfill its constitutional responsibility
to resolve cases and controversies within its jurisdiction hinged on the
availability of certain indispensable information. Another important
factor here is the burden imposed by the discovery orders. This is not
a routine discovery dispute. The discovery requests are directed to the
Vice President and other senior Government officials who served on
the Group to give advice and make recommendations to the President.
Special considerations control when the Executive's interests in maintaining its autonomy and safeguarding its communications' confidentiality are implicated. See, e. g., Clinton v. Jones, 520 U. S. 681, 707. Even
when compared against Nixon's criminal subpoenas involving the President, the civil discovery here militates against respondents' position.

Syllabus
There are no checks in civil discovery analogous to the constraints imposed in the criminal justice system to filter out insubstantial legal
claims. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 sanctions and private attorneys' obligation of candor to the judicial tribunal have proved insufficient to discourage the filing of meritless claims against the Executive
Branch. Finally, the narrowly tailored subpoena orders in Nixon,
which "precisely identified" and "specific[ally] . . . enumerated" the relevant materials, 418 U. S., at 688, and n. 5, stand in marked contrast to
the overly broad discovery requests approved by the District Court.
Given that disparity, this Court's precedents provide no support for the
appeals court's requirement that the Executive Branch bear the burden
of invoking executive privilege with sufficient specificity and of making
particularized objections. Indeed, those precedents suggest just the
opposite. See, e. g., Clinton, supra, at 705. Contrary to their conclusions, Nixon did not leave the lower courts the sole option of inviting
the Executive Branch to invoke executive privilege. Rather, they could
have narrowed the scope of the discovery orders on their own. In deciding whether to issue mandamus, the Court of Appeals must not only
determine whether there are exceptional circumstances amounting to a
judicial usurpation of power, Will v. United States, 389 U. S. 90, 95, or a
"clear abuse of discretion," Bankers Life & Casualty Co. v. Holland,
346 U. S. 379, 383, but must also ask whether the District Court's actions
constituted an unwarranted impairment of another branch in the performance of its constitutional duties. Pp. 383-391.

(c) Absent overriding concerns such as the need to avoid piecemeal
litigation, see Schlagenhauf v. Holder, 379 U. S. 104, 111, the Court
declines to direct the Court of Appeals to issue mandamus against the
District Court. This is not a case where, having considered the issues,
the appeals court abused its discretion by failing to issue the writ. Instead, it relied on its mistaken reading of Nixon and prematurely terminated its inquiry without even reaching the weighty separation-ofpowers objections raised in the case or exercising its discretion to
determine whether mandamus is appropriate under the circumstances.
Because issuance of the writ is vested in the discretion of the court to
which the petition is made, this Court leaves it to the Court of Appeals
to address the parties' arguments and other matters bearing on whether
mandamus should issue, bearing in mind the burdens imposed on the
Executive Branch in any future proceedings. Special considerations
applicable to the President and the Vice President suggest that the
lower courts should be sensitive to Government requests for interlocutory appeals to reexamine, e. g., whether the statute embodies the de
facto membership doctrine. Pp. 391-392.

A few days after assuming office, President George W.Bush issued a memorandum establishing the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG or Group). TheGroup was directed to "develo[p] . . . a national energy policy
designed to help the private sector, and government at alllevels, promote dependable, affordable, and environmentally
sound production and distribution of energy for the future."App. 156-157. The President assigned a number of agency
heads and assistants--all employees of the Federal Govern-ment--to serve as members of the committee. He authorized the Vice President, as chairman of the Group, to invite"other officers of the Federal Government" to participate "as
appropriate." Id., at 157. Five months later, the NEPDGissued a final report and, according to the Government, terminated all operations.Following publication of the report, respondents Judicial
Watch, Inc., and the Sierra Club filed these separate actions,which were later consolidated in the District Court. Respondents alleged the NEPDG had failed to comply with theprocedural and disclosure requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA or Act), 5 U. S. C. App. $ 2, p. 1.FACA was enacted to monitor the "numerous committees,
boards, commissions, councils, and similar groups [that] havebeen established to advise officers and agencies in the executive branch of the Federal Government," $ 2(a), and to pre-vent the "wasteful expenditure of public funds" that may
result from their proliferation, Public Citizen v. Departmentof Justice, 491 U. S. 440, 453 (1989). Subject to specific exemptions, FACA imposes a variety of open-meeting and dis-closure requirements on groups that meet the definition of
an "advisory committee." As relevant here, an "advisorycommittee" means

Respondents do not dispute the President appointed onlyFederal Government officials to the NEPDG. They agree

that the NEPDG, as established by the President in hismemorandum, was "composed wholly of full-time, or permanent part-time, officers or employees of the Federal Govern-ment." Ibid. The complaint alleges, however, that "nonfederal employees," including "private lobbyists," "regularlyattended and fully participated in non-public meetings."
App. 21 (Judicial Watch Complaint || 25). Relying on Asso-ciation of American Physicians & Surgeons, Inc. v. Clinton, 997 F. 2d 898 (CADC 1993) (AAPS), respondents con-tend that the regular participation of the non-Government
individuals made them de facto members of the committee.According to the complaint, their "involvement and role are
functionally indistinguishable from those of the other [for-mal] members."

Id., at 915. As a result, respondentsargue, the NEPDG cannot benefit from the Act's exemption

under subsection B and is subject to FACA's requirements.Vice President Cheney, the NEPDG, the Government officials who served on the committee, and the alleged de factomembers were named as defendants. The suit seeks declaratory relief and an injunction requiring them to produce allmaterials allegedly subject to FACA's requirements.

All defendants moved to dismiss. The District Courtgranted the motion in part and denied it in part. The court
acknowledged FACA does not create a private cause of ac-tion. On this basis, it dismissed respondents' claims against

Opinion of the Court
the non-Government defendants. Because the NEPDG hadbeen dissolved, it could not be sued as a defendant; and the

claims against it were dismissed as well. The District Courtheld, however, that FACA's substantive requirements could
be enforced against the Vice President and other Govern-ment participants on the NEPDG under the Mandamus Act,
28 U. S. C. $ 1361, and against the agency defendants under
the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. $ 706.The District Court recognized the disclosure duty must be

clear and nondiscretionary for mandamus to issue, and theremust be, among other things, "final agency actions" for the
APA to apply. According to the District Court, it was premature to decide these questions. It held only that respondents had alleged sufficient facts to keep the Vice President
and the other defendants in the case.

The District Court deferred ruling on the Government's
contention that to disregard the exemption and apply FACA
to the NEPDG would violate principles of separation of powers and interfere with the constitutional prerogatives of the
President and the Vice President. Instead, the court allowed respondents to conduct a "tightly-reined" discovery to
ascertain the NEPDG's structure and membership, and thus
to determine whether the de facto membership doctrine applies. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. National Energy Policy Dev.
Group, 219 F. Supp. 2d 20, 54 (DC 2002). While acknowledging that discovery itself might raise serious constitutional
questions, the District Court explained that the Government
could assert executive privilege to protect sensitive materials from disclosure. In the District Court's view, these "issues of executive privilege will be much more limited in
scope than the broad constitutional challenge raised by the
government." Id., at 55. The District Court adopted this
approach in an attempt to avoid constitutional questions, noting that if, after discovery, respondents have no evidentiary
support for the allegations about the regular participation
by lobbyists and industry executives on the NEPDG, the

Opinion of the Court
Government can prevail on statutory grounds. Further-more, the District Court explained, even were it appropriate

to address constitutional issues, some factual development isnecessary to determine the extent of the alleged intrusion
into the Executive's constitutional authority. The court de-nied in part the motion to dismiss and ordered respondents
to submit a discovery plan.

In due course the District Court approved respondents'discovery plan, entered a series of orders allowing discovery

to proceed, see CADC App. 238, 263, 364 (reproducing ordersentered on Sept. 9, Oct. 17, and Nov. 1, 2002), and denied
the Government's motion for certification under 28 U. S. C.

$ 1292(b) with respect to the discovery orders. Petitioners
sought a writ of mandamus in the Court of Appeals to vacate
the discovery orders, to direct the District Court to rule on
the basis of the administrative record, and to dismiss the
Vice President from the suit. The Vice President also filed
a notice of appeal from the same orders. See Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541 (1949); United
States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683 (1974).

A divided panel of the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition for a writ of mandamus and the Vice President's attempted interlocutory appeal. In re Cheney, 334 F. 3d 1096
(CADC 2003). With respect to mandamus, the majority declined to issue the writ on the ground that alternative avenues of relief remained available. Citing United States v.
Nixon, supra, the majority held that petitioners, to guard
against intrusion into the President's prerogatives, must first
assert privilege. Under its reading of Nixon, moreover,
privilege claims must be made " `with particularity.' " 334
F. 3d, at 1104. In the majority's view, if the District Court
sustains the privilege, petitioners will be able to obtain all
the relief they seek. If the District Court rejects the claim
of executive privilege and creates "an imminent risk of disclosure of allegedly protected presidential communications,"
"mandamus might well be appropriate to avoid letting `the

Opinion of the Court
cat . . . out of the bag.' " Id., at 1104-1105. "But so long as
the separation of powers conflict that petitioners anticipate
remains hypothetical," the panel held, "we have no authority
to exercise the extraordinary remedy of mandamus." Id., at
1105. The majority acknowledged the scope of respondents'
requests is overly broad, because it seeks far more than the
"limited items" to which respondents would be entitled if
"the district court ultimately determines that the NEPDG
is subject to FACA." Id., at 1105-1106; id., at 1106 ("The
requests to produce also go well beyond FACA's requirements"); ibid. ("[Respondents'] discovery also goes well beyond what they need to prove"). It nonetheless agreed with
the District Court that petitioners " `shall bear the burden' "
of invoking executive privilege and filing objections to the
discovery orders with " `detailed precision.' " Id., at 1105
(quoting Aug. 2, 2002, Order).

For similar reasons, the majority rejected the Vice President's interlocutory appeal. In United States v. Nixon, the
Court held that the President could appeal an interlocutory
subpoena order without having "to place himself in the posture of disobeying an order of a court merely to trigger the
procedural mechanism for review." 418 U. S., at 691. The
majority, however, found the case inapplicable because Vice
President Cheney, unlike then-President Nixon, had not yet
asserted privilege. In the majority's view, the Vice President was not forced to choose between disclosure and suffering contempt for failure to obey a court order. The majority
held that to require the Vice President to assert privilege
does not create the unnecessary confrontation between two
branches of Government described in Nixon.

Judge Randolph filed a dissenting opinion. In his view
AAPS ' de facto membership doctrine is mistaken, and the
Constitution bars its application to the NEPDG. Allowing
discovery to determine the applicability of the de facto membership doctrine, he concluded, is inappropriate. He would

have issued the writ of mandamus directing dismissal of the
complaints. 334 F. 3d, at 1119.

We granted certiorari. 540 U. S. 1088 (2003). We now
vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the
case for further proceedings to reconsider the Government's
mandamus petition.

II

As a preliminary matter, we address respondents' argument that the Government's petition for a writ of mandamus
was jurisdictionally out of time or, alternatively, barred by
the equitable doctrine of laches. According to respondents,
because the Government's basic argument was one of discovery immunity--that is, it need not invoke executive privilege
or make particular objections to the discovery requests--the
mandamus petition should have been filed with the Court of
Appeals within 60 days after the District Court denied the
Government's motion to dismiss. See Fed. Rule App. Proc.
4(a)(1)(B) ("When the United States or its officer or agency
is a party, the notice of appeal may be filed by any party
within 60 days after the judgment or order appealed from is
entered"). On this theory, the last day for making any filing
to the Court of Appeals was September 9, 2002. The Government, however, did not file the mandamus petition and
the notice of appeal until November 7, four months after the
District Court issued the order that, under respondents'
view, commenced the time for appeal.

As even respondents acknowledge, however, Rule 4(a), by
its plain terms, applies only to the filing of a notice of appeal.
Brief for Respondent Sierra Club 23. Rule 4(a) is inapplicable to the Government's mandamus petition under the All
Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1651. Because we vacate the Court
of Appeals' judgment and remand the case for further proceedings for the court to consider whether a writ of mandamus should have issued, we need not decide whether the Vice
President also could have appealed the District Court's or542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

379Cite as: 542 U. S. 367 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
ders under Nixon and the collateral order doctrine. We ex-press no opinion on whether the Vice President's notice of

appeal was timely filed.Respondents' argument that the mandamus petition was
barred by laches does not withstand scrutiny. Laches mightbar a petition for a writ of mandamus if the petitioner "slept
upon his rights . . . , and especially if the delay has been
prejudicial to the [other party], or to the rights of other per-sons."

Chapman v. County of Douglas, 107 U. S. 348, 355
(1883). Here, the flurry of activity following the DistrictCourt's denial of the motion to dismiss overcomes respondents' argument that the Government neglected to assert its
rights. The Government filed, among other papers, a motion for a protective order on September 3; a motion to stay
pending appeal on October 21; and a motion for leave to
appeal pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 1292(b) on October 23. Even
were we to agree that the baseline for measuring the timeliness of the Government's mandamus petition was the
District Court's order denying the motion to dismiss, the
Government's active litigation posture was far from the neglect or delay that would make the application of laches
appropriate.

We do not accept, furthermore, respondents' argument
that laches should apply because the motions filed by the
Government following the District Court's denial of its motion to dismiss amounted to little more than dilatory tactics
to "delay and obstruct the proceedings." Brief for Respondent Sierra Club 23. In light of the drastic nature of mandamus and our precedents holding that mandamus may not
issue so long as alternative avenues of relief remain available, the Government cannot be faulted for attempting to
resolve the dispute through less drastic means. The law
does not put litigants in the impossible position of having to
exhaust alternative remedies before petitioning for mandamus, on the one hand, and having to file the mandamus petition at the earliest possible moment to avoid laches, on the

other. The petition was properly before the Court of Ap-peals for its consideration.

III
We now come to the central issue in the case--whetherthe Court of Appeals was correct to conclude it "ha[d] no

authority to exercise the extraordinary remedy of manda-mus," 334 F. 3d, at 1105, on the ground that the Government
could protect its rights by asserting executive privilege inthe District Court.

The common-law writ of mandamus against a lower courtis codified at 28 U. S. C. $ 1651(a): "The Supreme Court and
all courts established by Act of Congress may issue all writsnecessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law."This is a "drastic and extraordinary" remedy "reserved for
really extraordinary causes." Ex parte Fahey, 332 U. S.258, 259-260 (1947). "The traditional use of the writ in aid
of appellate jurisdiction both at common law and in the fed-eral courts has been to confine [the court against which mandamus is sought] to a lawful exercise of its prescribed juris-diction." Roche v. Evaporated Milk Assn., 319 U. S. 21, 26
(1943). Although courts have not "confined themselves toan arbitrary and technical definition of `jurisdiction,' " Will
v. United States, 389 U. S. 90, 95 (1967), "only exceptionalcircumstances amounting to a judicial `usurpation of power,' "
ibid., or a "clear abuse of discretion," Bankers Life & Casualty Co. v. Holland, 346 U. S. 379, 383 (1953), "will jus-tify the invocation of this extraordinary remedy," Will, 389

U. S., at 95.As the writ is one of "the most potent weapons in the
judicial arsenal," id., at 107, three conditions must be satis-fied before it may issue. Kerr v. United States Dist. Court
for Northern Dist. of Cal., 426 U. S. 394, 403 (1976). First,"the party seeking issuance of the writ [must] have no other
adequate means to attain the relief he desires," ibid.--a con-dition designed to ensure that the writ will not be used as a

542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
substitute for the regular appeals process, Fahey, supra, at260. Second, the petitioner must satisfy " `the burden of

showing that [his] right to issuance of the writ is "clear andindisputable." ' "

Kerr, supra, at 403 (quoting Bankers
Life & Casualty Co., supra, at 384). Third, even if the firsttwo prerequisites have been met, the issuing court, in the

exercise of its discretion, must be satisfied that the writ is
appropriate under the circumstances. Kerr, supra, at 403(citing

Schlagenhauf v. Holder, 379 U. S. 104, 112, n. 8 (1964)).
These hurdles, however demanding, are not insuperable.This Court has issued the writ to restrain a lower court when

its actions would threaten the separation of powers by "embarrass[ing] the executive arm of the Government," Ex parte
Peru, 318 U. S. 578, 588 (1943), or result in the "intrusion
by the federal judiciary on a delicate area of federal-state
relations," Will, supra, at 95 (citing Maryland v. Soper
(No. 1), 270 U. S. 9 (1926)).

Were the Vice President not a party in the case, the argument that the Court of Appeals should have entertained an
action in mandamus, notwithstanding the District Court's
denial of the motion for certification, might present different
considerations. Here, however, the Vice President and his
comembers on the NEPDG are the subjects of the discovery
orders. The mandamus petition alleges that the orders
threaten "substantial intrusions on the process by which
those in closest operational proximity to the President advise
the President." App. 343. These facts and allegations remove this case from the category of ordinary discovery orders where interlocutory appellate review is unavailable,
through mandamus or otherwise. It is well established that
"a President's communications and activities encompass a
vastly wider range of sensitive material than would be true
of any `ordinary individual.' " United States v. Nixon, 418
U. S., at 715. Chief Justice Marshall, sitting as a trial judge,
recognized the unique position of the Executive Branch when
he stated that "[i]n no case . . . would a court be required to

Opinion of the Court
proceed against the president as against an ordinary individual." United States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 187, 192 (No. 14,694)
(CC Va. 1807). See also Clinton v. Jones, 520 U. S. 681, 698-
699 (1997) ("We have, in short, long recognized the `unique
position in the constitutional scheme' that [the Office of the
President] occupies" (quoting Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S.
731, 749 (1982))); 520 U. S., at 710-724 (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment). As United States v. Nixon explained,
these principles do not mean that the "President is above the
law." 418 U. S., at 715. Rather, they simply acknowledge
that the public interest requires that a coequal branch of
Government "afford Presidential confidentiality the greatest
protection consistent with the fair administration of justice,"
ibid., and give recognition to the paramount necessity of protecting the Executive Branch from vexatious litigation that
might distract it from the energetic performance of its constitutional duties.

These separation-of-powers considerations should inform a
court of appeals' evaluation of a mandamus petition involving
the President or the Vice President. Accepted mandamus
standards are broad enough to allow a court of appeals to
prevent a lower court from interfering with a coequal
branch's ability to discharge its constitutional responsibilities. See Ex parte Peru, supra, at 587 (recognizing jurisdiction to issue the writ because "the action of the political
arm of the Government taken within its appropriate sphere
[must] be promptly recognized, and . . . delay and inconvenience of a prolonged litigation [must] be avoided by prompt
termination of the proceedings in the district court"); see
also Clinton v. Jones, supra, at 701 ("We have recognized
that `[e]ven when a branch does not arrogate power to itself . . . the separation-of-powers doctrine requires that a
branch not impair another in the performance of its constitutional duties' " (quoting Loving v. United States, 517 U. S.
748, 757 (1996))).

Opinion of the Court

IV
The Court of Appeals dismissed these separati on-of-powers concerns. Relying on

United States v. Nixon, itheld that even though respondents' discovery requests are

overbroad and "go well beyond FACA's requirements," theVice President and his former colleagues on the NEPDG
" `shall bear the burden' " of invoking privilege with narrowspecificity and objecting to the discovery requests with " `detailed precision.' " 334 F. 3d, at 1105-1106. In its view, thisresult was required by Nixon's rejection of an "absolute, unqualified Presidential privilege of immunity from judicialprocess under all circumstances." 418 U. S., at 706. If
Nixon refused to recognize broad claims of confidentialitywhere the President had asserted executive privilege, the
majority reasoned, Nixon must have rejected, a fortiori,petitioners' claim of discovery immunity where the privilege
has not even been invoked. According to the majority, be-cause the Executive Branch can invoke executive privilege
to maintain the separation of powers, mandamus relief ispremature.

This analysis, however, overlooks fundamental differencesin the two cases.

Nixon cannot bear the weight the Courtof Appeals puts upon it. First, unlike this case, which concerns respondents' requests for information for use in a civilsuit,

Nixon involves the proper balance between the Execu-tive's interest in the confidentiality of its communications and

the "constitutional need for production of relevant evidencein a criminal proceeding."

Id., at 713. The Court's decision
was explicit that it was "not . . . concerned with the balancebetween the President's generalized interest in confidentiality and the need for relevant evidence in civil litigation . . . .We address only the conflict between the President's assertion of a generalized privilege of confidentiality and the con-stitutional need for relevant evidence in criminal trials."
Id., at 712, n. 19.

542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN
384 CHENEY v. UNITED STATES DIST. COURT FOR D. C.

Opinion of the Court
The distinction Nixon drew between criminal and civilproceedings is not just a matter of formalism. As the Court

explained, the need for information in the criminal contextis much weightier because "our historic[al] commitment to
the rule of law . . . is nowhere more profoundly manifest thanin our view that `the twofold aim [of criminal justice] is that
guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer.' " Id., at 708-709
(quoting Berger v. United States, 295 U. S. 78, 88 (1935)). Inlight of the "fundamental" and "comprehensive" need for

"every man's evidence" in the criminal justice system, 418U. S., at 709, 710, not only must the Executive Branch first
assert privilege to resist disclosure, but privilege claims that
shield information from a grand jury proceeding or a criminal trial are not to be "expansively construed, for they are
in derogation of the search for truth," id., at 710. The need
for information for use in civil cases, while far from negligible, does not share the urgency or significance of the criminal
subpoena requests in Nixon. As Nixon recognized, the
right to production of relevant evidence in civil proceedings
does not have the same "constitutional dimensions." Id.,
at 711.

The Court also observed in Nixon that a "primary constitutional duty of the Judicial Branch [is] to do justice in criminal prosecutions." Id., at 707. Withholding materials from
a tribunal in an ongoing criminal case when the information
is necessary to the court in carrying out its tasks "conflict[s]
with the function of the courts under Art. III." Ibid. Such
an impairment of the "essential functions of [another]
branch," ibid., is impermissible. Withholding the information in this case, however, does not hamper another branch's
ability to perform its "essential functions" in quite the same
way. Ibid. The District Court ordered discovery here, not
to remedy known statutory violations, but to ascertain
whether FACA's disclosure requirements even apply to the
NEPDG in the first place. Even if FACA embodies important congressional objectives, the only consequence from re542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

385Cite as: 542 U. S. 367 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
spondents' inability to obtain the discovery they seek is thatit would be more difficult for private complainants to vindicate Congress' policy objectives under FACA. And even if,for argument's sake, the reasoning in Judge Randolph's dissenting opinion in the end is rejected and FACA's statutoryobjectives would be to some extent frustrated, it does not
follow that a court's Article III authority or Congress' central Article I powers would be impaired. The situation herecannot, in fairness, be compared to

Nixon, where a court's
ability to fulfill its constitutional responsibility to resolvecases and controversies within its jurisdiction hinges on the

availability of certain indispensable information.

A party's need for information is only one facet of the
problem. An important factor weighing in the opposite direction is the burden imposed by the discovery orders. This
is not a routine discovery dispute. The discovery requests
are directed to the Vice President and other senior Government officials who served on the NEPDG to give advice and
make recommendations to the President. The Executive
Branch, at its highest level, is seeking the aid of the courts to
protect its constitutional prerogatives. As we have already
noted, special considerations control when the Executive
Branch's interests in maintaining the autonomy of its office
and safeguarding the confidentiality of its communications
are implicated. This Court has held, on more than one occasion, that "[t]he high respect that is owed to the office of the
Chief Executive . . . is a matter that should inform the conduct of the entire proceeding, including the timing and scope
of discovery," Clinton, 520 U. S., at 707, and that the Executive's "constitutional responsibilities and status [are] factors
counseling judicial deference and restraint" in the conduct of
litigation against it, Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 753.
Respondents' reliance on cases that do not involve senior
members of the Executive Branch, see, e. g., Kerr v. United
States Dist. Court for Northern Dist. of Cal., 426 U. S. 394
(1976), is altogether misplaced.

386 CHENEY v. UNITED STATES DIST. COURT FOR D. C.

Opinion of the Court
Even when compared against United States v. Nixon'scriminal subpoenas, which did involve the President, the civil

discovery here militates against respondents' position. Theobservation in

Nixon that production of confidential information would not disrupt the functioning of the ExecutiveBranch cannot be applied in a mechanistic fashion to civil

litigation. In the criminal justice system, there are various
constraints, albeit imperfect, to filter out insubstantial legalclaims. The decision to prosecute a criminal case, for example, is made by a publicly accountable prosecutor subject tobudgetary considerations and under an ethical obligation, not
only to win and zealously to advocate for his client but also
to serve the cause of justice. The rigors of the penal system
are also mitigated by the responsible exercise of prosecutorial discretion. In contrast, there are no analogous checks
in the civil discovery process here. Although under Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 11, sanctions are available, and private attorneys also owe an obligation of candor to the judicial
tribunal, these safeguards have proved insufficient to discourage the filing of meritless claims against the Executive
Branch. "In view of the visibility of " the Offices of the
President and the Vice President and "the effect of [their]
actions on countless people," they are "easily identifiable target[s] for suits for civil damages." Nixon v. Fitzgerald,
supra, at 753.

Finally, the narrow subpoena orders in United States v.
Nixon stand on an altogether different footing from the
overly broad discovery requests approved by the District
Court in this case. The criminal subpoenas in Nixon were
required to satisfy exacting standards of "(1) relevancy;
(2) admissibility; (3) specificity." 418 U. S., at 700 (interpreting Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 17(c)). They were "not intended
to provide a means of discovery." 418 U. S., at 698. The
burden of showing these standards were met, moreover, fell
on the party requesting the information. Id., at 699 ("[I]n
order to require production prior to trial, the moving party

542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

387Cite as: 542 U. S. 367 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
must show [that the applicable standards are met]"). InNixon, the Court addressed the issue of executive privilege

only after having satisfied itself that the special prosecutorhad surmounted these demanding requirements. Id., at 698
("If we sustained this [Rule 17(c)] challenge, there would beno occasion to reach the claim of privilege asserted with respect to the subpoenaed material"). The very specificity ofthe subpoena requests serves as an important safeguard
against unnecessary intrusion into the operation of the Officeof the President.

In contrast to Nixon's subpoena orders that "preciselyidentified" and "specific[ally] . . . enumerated" the relevant
materials, id., at 688, and n. 5, the discovery requests here,as the panel majority acknowledged, ask for everything
under the sky:

"1. All documents identifying or referring to any staff,personnel, contractors, consultants or employees of the

Task Force.
"2. All documents establishing or referring to anySub-Group.

"3. All documents identifying or referring to any staff,personnel, contractors, consultants or employees of any
Sub-Group.
"4. All documents identifying or referring to any otherpersons participating in the preparation of the Report

or in the activities of the Task Force or any Sub-Group.
"5. All documents concerning any communication relat-ing to the activities of the Task Force, the activities of

any Sub-Groups, or the preparation of the Report . . . .
"6. All documents concerning any communication relat-ing to the activities of the Task Force, the activities of

Sub-Groups, or the preparation of the Report betweenany person . . . and [a list of agencies]." App. 220-221.

Opinion of the Court
is only the beginning. Respondents' "First Set of Interrog-atories" are similarly unbounded in scope.

Id., at 224.
Given the breadth of the discovery requests in this case com-pared to the narrow subpoena orders in

United States v.
Nixon, our precedent provides no support for the propositionthat the Executive Branch "shall bear the burden" of invoking executive privilege with sufficient specificity and of making particularized objections. 334 F. 3d, at 1105. To besure,

Nixon held that the President cannot, through the assertion of a "broad [and] undifferentiated" need for confiden-tiality and the invocation of an "absolute, unqualified" executive privilege, withhold information in the face of subpoena
orders. 418 U. S., at 706, 707. It did so, however, only after
the party requesting the information--the special prosecutor--had satisfied his burden of showing the propriety of the
requests. Here, as the Court of Appeals acknowledged, the
discovery requests are anything but appropriate. They provide respondents all the disclosure to which they would be
entitled in the event they prevail on the merits, and much
more besides. In these circumstances, Nixon does not require the Executive Branch to bear the onus of critiquing
the unacceptable discovery requests line by line. Our precedents suggest just the opposite. See, e. g., Clinton v. Jones,
520 U. S. 681 (1997); id., at 705 (holding that the Judiciary
may direct "appropriate process" to the Executive); Nixon
v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 753.

The Government, however, did in fact object to the scope
of discovery and asked the District Court to narrow it in
some way. Its arguments were ignored. See App. 167,
181-183 (arguing "this case can be resolved far short of the
wide-ranging inquiries plaintiffs have proposed" and suggesting alternatives to "limi[t]" discovery); id., at 232 ("Defendants object to the scope of plaintiffs' discovery requests
and to the undue burden imposed by them. The scope of
plaintiffs' requests is broader than that reasonably calculated
to lead to admissible evidence"); id., at 232, n. 10 ("We state

In addition, the Government objected to the burden that would arise from the District Court's insistence thatthe Vice President winnow the discovery orders by asserting
specific claims of privilege and making more particular objections. Id., at 201 (Tr. of Status Hearing (Aug. 2, 2002)) (not-ing "concerns with disrupting the effective functioning of the

presidency and the vice-presidency"); id., at 274 ("[C]ompli-ance with the order of the court imposes a burden on the
Office of the Vice President. That is a real burden. If we
had completed and done everything that Your Honor has
asked us to do today that burden would be gone, but it would
have been realized"). These arguments, too, were rejected.
See id., at 327, 329 (Nov. 1, 2002, Order) (noting that the
court had, "on numerous occasions," rejected the Government's assertion "that court orders requiring [it] to respond
in any fashion to [the] discovery requests creates an `unconstitutional burden' on the Executive Branch").

Contrary to the District Court's and the Court of Appeals'
conclusions, Nixon does not leave them the sole option of
inviting the Executive Branch to invoke executive privilege
while remaining otherwise powerless to modify a party's
overly broad discovery requests. Executive privilege is an
extraordinary assertion of power "not to be lightly invoked."
United States v. Reynolds, 345 U. S. 1, 7 (1953). Once executive privilege is asserted, coequal branches of the Government are set on a collision course. The Judiciary is forced
into the difficult task of balancing the need for information
in a judicial proceeding and the Executive's Article II prerogatives. This inquiry places courts in the awkward position of evaluating the Executive's claims of confidentiality
and autonomy, and pushes to the fore difficult questions of
separation of powers and checks and balances. These "occasion[s] for constitutional confrontation between the two

branches" should be avoided whenever possible. United
States v. Nixon, supra, at 692.

In recognition of these concerns, there is sound precedentin the District of Columbia itself for district courts to explore

other avenues, short of forcing the Executive to invoke privi-lege, when they are asked to enforce against the Executive
Branch unnecessarily broad subpoenas. In United States v.
Poindexter, 727 F. Supp. 1501 (1989), defendant Poindexter,on trial for criminal charges, sought to have the District

Court enforce subpoena orders against President Reagan toobtain allegedly exculpatory materials. The Executive considered the subpoenas "unreasonable and oppressive." Id.,
at 1503. Rejecting defendant's argument that the Executive must first assert executive privilege to narrow the subpoenas, the District Court agreed with the President that "it
is undesirable as a matter of constitutional and public policy
to compel a President to make his decision on privilege with
respect to a large array of documents." Ibid. The court
decided to narrow, on its own, the scope of the subpoenas to
allow the Executive "to consider whether to invoke executive privilege with respect to . . . a possibly smaller number
of documents following the narrowing of the subpoenas."
Id., at 1504. This is but one example of the choices available
to the District Court and the Court of Appeals in this case.

As we discussed at the outset, under principles of mandamus jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals may exercise its
power to issue the writ only upon a finding of "exceptional
circumstances amounting to a judicial `usurpation of power,' "
Will, 389 U. S., at 95, or a "clear abuse of discretion," Bankers Life, 346 U. S., at 383. As this case implicates the separation of powers, the Court of Appeals must also ask, as part
of this inquiry, whether the District Court's actions constituted an unwarranted impairment of another branch in the
performance of its constitutional duties. This is especially
so here because the District Court's analysis of whether
mandamus relief is appropriate should itself be constrained

by principles similar to those we have outlined, supra, at380-382, that limit the Court of Appeals' use of the remedy.

The panel majority, however, failed to ask this question. In-stead, it labored under the mistaken assumption that the assertion of executive privilege is a necessary precondition tothe Government's separation-of-powers objections.

V
In the absence of overriding concerns of the sort discussedin Schlagenhauf, 379 U. S., at 111 (discussing, among other

things, the need to avoid "piecemeal litigation" and to settleimportant issues of first impression in areas where this
Court bears special responsibility), we decline petitioners'invitation to direct the Court of Appeals to issue the writ
against the District Court. Moreover, this is not a casewhere, after having considered the issues, the Court of Appeals abused its discretion by failing to issue the writ. In-stead, the Court of Appeals, relying on its mistaken reading
of United States v. Nixon, prematurely terminated its in-quiry after the Government refused to assert privilege and
did so without even reaching the weighty separation-of-powers objections raised in the case, much less exercised its
discretion to determine whether "the writ is appropriateunder the circumstances."

Supra, at 381. Because the is-suance of the writ is a matter vested in the discretion of the

court to which the petition is made, and because this Courtis not presented with an original writ of mandamus, see,

e. g.,Ex parte Peru, 318 U. S., at 586, we leave to the Court of

Appeals to address the parties' arguments with respect tothe challenge to AAPS and the discovery orders. Other
matters bearing on whether the writ of mandamus shouldissue should also be addressed, in the first instance, by the
Court of Appeals after considering any additional briefs andarguments as it deems appropriate. We note only that all
courts should be mindful of the burdens imposed on the Ex-ecutive Branch in any future proceedings. Special consider542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ations applicable to the President and the Vice Presidentsuggest that the courts should be sensitive to requests by

the Government for interlocutory appeals to reexamine, forexample, whether the statute embodies the

de facto membership doctrine.The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District of

Columbia is vacated, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, concurring.
Broad discovery should be encouraged when it serves thesalutary purpose of facilitating the prompt and fair resolution of concrete disputes. In the normal case, it is entirelyappropriate to require the responding party to make particularized objections to discovery requests. In some circumstances, however, the requesting party should be required to
assume a heavy burden of persuasion before any discovery
is allowed. Two interrelated considerations support taking
that approach in this case: the nature of the remedy respondents requested from the District Court, and the nature of
the statute they sought to enforce.

As relevant here, respondents, Judicial Watch, Inc., and
Sierra Club, sought a writ of mandamus under 28 U. S. C.

$ 1361. Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy, available to
"a plaintiff only if . . . the defendant owes him a clear nondiscretionary duty." Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U. S. 602, 616
(1984). Thus, to persuade the District Court that they were
entitled to mandamus relief, respondents had to establish
that petitioners had a nondiscretionary duty to comply with
the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), 5 U. S. C. App.

$ 1 et seq., p. 1, and in particular with FACA's requirement
that "records related to the advisory committee's work be
made public"--the only requirement still enforceable if, as
respondent Sierra Club concedes, the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG) no longer exists. See Ju542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Thomas, J.
dicial Watch, Inc. v. National Energy Policy Dev. Group,219 F. Supp. 2d 20, 42 (DC 2002). Relying on the Court of

Appeals' novel de facto member doctrine, ante, at 374, re-spondents sought to make that showing by obtaining the
very records to which they will be entitled if they win theirlawsuit. In other words, respondents sought to obtain,
through discovery, information about the NEPDG's work inorder to establish their entitlement

to the same information.Thus, granting broad discovery in this case effectively prejudged the merits of respondents' claim for mandamus re-lief--an outcome entirely inconsistent with the extraordinary nature of the writ. Under these circumstances, insteadof requiring petitioners to object to particular discovery requests, the District Court should have required respondentsto demonstrate that particular requests would tend to establish their theory of the case.* I therefore think it wouldhave been appropriate for the Court of Appeals to vacate
the District Court's discovery order. I nevertheless join theCourt's opinion and judgment because, as the architect of
the de facto member doctrine, the Court of Appeals is the
appropriate forum to direct future proceedings in the case.

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins, con-curring in part and dissenting in part.

I agree that "[t]he remedy of mandamus is a drastic one,to be invoked only in extraordinary situations."

Kerr v.
United States Dist. Court for Northern Dist. of Cal., 426U. S. 394, 402 (1976). In framing our review of the Court of

Appeals' judgment, the Court recognizes this hurdle, observ-ing that "the petitioner must satisfy `the burden of showing

*A few interrogatories or depositions might have determined, for example, whether any non-Government employees voted on NEPDG recommendations or drafted portions of the committee's report. In my view,
only substantive participation of this nature would even arguably be sufficient to warrant classifying a non-Government employee as a de facto committee member.

Opinion of Thomas, J.
that [his] right to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable.' " Ante, at 381 (quoting Kerr, supra, at 403 (internal
quotation marks omitted)). But in reaching its disposition,
the Court barely mentions the fact that respondents, Judicial
Watch, Inc., and Sierra Club, face precisely the same burden
to obtain relief from the District Court. The proper question presented to the Court of Appeals was not only whether
it is clear and indisputable that petitioners have a right to an
order " `vacat[ing] the discovery orders issued by the district
court, direct[ing] the court to decide the case on the basis of
the administrative record and such supplemental affidavits
as it may require, and direct[ing] that the Vice President be
dismissed as a defendant.' " 334 F. 3d 1096, 1101 (CADC
2003) (quoting Emergency Pet. for Writ of Mandamus in
In re Cheney, in No. 02-5354 (CADC)). The question with
which the Court of Appeals was faced also necessarily had
to account for the fact that respondents sought mandamus
relief in the District Court. Because they proceeded by
mandamus, respondents had to demonstrate in the District
Court a clear and indisputable right to the Federal Advisory
Committee Act (FACA) materials. If respondents' right to
the materials was not clear and indisputable, then petitioners' right to relief in the Court of Appeals was clear.

One need look no further than the District Court's opinion
to conclude respondents' right to relief in the District Court
was unclear and hence that mandamus would be unavailable.
Indeed, the District Court acknowledged this Court's recognition "that applying FACA to meetings among Presidential
advisors `present[s] formidable constitutional difficulties.' "
Judicial Watch, Inc. v. National Energy Policy Dev. Group,
219 F. Supp. 2d 20, 47 (DC 2002) (quoting Public Citizen v.
Department of Justice, 491 U. S. 440, 466 (1989)).

Putting aside the serious constitutional questions raised
by respondents' challenge, the District Court could not even

Opinion of Thomas, J.
determine whether FACA applies to the National EnergyPolicy Development Group (NEPDG) as a statutory matter.

219 F. Supp. 2d, at 54-55 (noting the possibility that, afterdiscovery, petitioners might prevail on summary judgment
on statutory grounds). I acknowledge that under the Court
of Appeals' de facto member doctrine, see Association of
American Physicians & Surgeons, Inc. v. Clinton, 997 F. 2d
898, 915 (CADC 1993), a district court is authorized to undertake broad discovery to determine whether FACA's Government employees exception, 5 U. S. C. App. $ 3(2)(C)(i), p. 2,
applies. But, application of the de facto member doctrine
to authorize broad discovery into the inner workings of the
NEPDG has the same potential to offend the Constitution's
separation of powers as the actual application of FACA to
the NEPDG itself. 334 F. 3d, at 1114-1115 (Randolph, J.,
dissenting). Thus, the existence of this doctrine cannot support the District Court's actions here. If respondents must
conduct wide-ranging discovery in order to prove that they
have any right to relief--much less that they have a clear
and indisputable right to relief--mandamus is unwarranted,
and the writ should not issue.

Although the District Court might later conclude that
FACA applies to the NEPDG as a statutory matter and that
such application is constitutional, the mere fact that the District Court might rule in respondents' favor cannot establish
the clear right to relief necessary for mandamus. Otherwise, the writ of mandamus could turn into a freestanding
cause of action for plaintiffs seeking to enforce virtually any
statute, even those that provide no such private remedy.

Because the District Court clearly exceeded its authority
in this case, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of
Appeals and remand the case with instruction to issue the
writ.*

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Souter joins,dissenting.

The Government, in seeking a writ of mandamus from theCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and on brief
to this Court, urged that this case should be resolved withoutany discovery. See App. 183-184, 339; Brief for Petitioners
45; Reply Brief 18. In vacating the judgment of the Courtof Appeals, however, this Court remands for consideration
whether mandamus is appropriate due to the overbreadth ofthe District Court's discovery orders. See

ante, at 372-373,387-390. But, as the Court of Appeals observed, it appeared that the Government "never asked the district courtto narrow discovery." In re Cheney, 334 F. 3d 1096, 1106
(CADC 2003) (emphasis in original). Given the Govern-ment's decision to resist all discovery, mandamus relief based
on the exorbitance of the discovery orders is at least "prema-ture," id., at 1104. I would therefore affirm the judgment
of the Court of Appeals denying the writ,1 and allow theDistrict Court, in the first instance, to pursue its expressed
intention "tightly [to] rei[n] [in] discovery," 219 F. Supp. 2d20, 54 (DC 2002), should the Government so request.

A
The discovery at issue here was sought in a civil actionfiled by respondents Judicial Watch, Inc., and Sierra Club.

1 The Court of Appeals also concluded, altogether correctly in my view,
that it lacked ordinary appellate jurisdiction over the Vice President's appeal. See 334 F. 3d, at 1109; cf. ante, at 378-379 (leaving appellatejurisdiction question undecided). In its order addressing the petitioners'
motions to dismiss, the District Court stated "it would be premature and
inappropriate to determine whether" any relief could be obtained from
the Vice President. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. National Energy Policy Dev.
Group, 219 F. Supp. 2d 20, 44 (DC 2002). Immediate review of an interlocutory ruling, allowed in rare cases under the collateral-order doctrine, is
inappropriate when an order is, as in this case, "inherently tentative" and
not "the final word on the subject." Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., 485 U. S. 271, 277 (1988) (internal quotation marks omitted).

To gain information concerning the membership and opera-tions of an energy-policy task force, the National Energy

Policy Development Group (NEPDG), respondents filed suitunder the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), 5
U. S. C. App. $ 1 et seq., p. 1; respondents named among thedefendants the Vice President and senior Executive Branch
officials. See App. 16-40, 139-154; ante, at 373-374. After
granting in part and denying in part the Government's motions to dismiss, see 219 F. Supp. 2d 20, the District Court
approved respondents' extensive discovery plan, which included detailed and far-ranging interrogatories and sweeping requests for production of documents, see App. to Pet.
for Cert. 51a; App. 215-230. In a later order, the District
Court directed the Government to "produce non-privileged
documents and a privilege log." App. to Pet. for Cert. 47a.

The discovery plan drawn by Judicial Watch and Sierra
Club was indeed "unbounded in scope." Ante, at 388; accord
334 F. 3d, at 1106. Initial approval of that plan by the District Court, however, was not given in stunning disregard of
separation-of-powers concerns. Cf. ante, at 387-391. In
the order itself, the District Court invited "detailed and precise object[ions]" to any of the discovery requests, and instructed the Government to "identify and explain . . . invocations of privilege with particularity." App. to Pet. for Cert.
51a. To avoid duplication, the District Court provided that
the Government could identify "documents or information
[responsive to the discovery requests] that [it] ha[d] already
released to [Judicial Watch or the Sierra Club] in different
fora." Ibid.2 Anticipating further proceedings concerning
discovery, the District Court suggested that the Government
could "submit [any privileged documents] under seal for the
court's consideration," or that "the court [could] appoint the
equivalent of a Special Master, maybe a retired judge," to
review allegedly privileged documents. App. 247.

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
The Government did not file specific objections; nor did itsupply particulars to support assertions of privilege. Instead, the Government urged the District Court to rule thatJudicial Watch and the Sierra Club could have no discovery
at all. See id., at 192 ("the governmen[t] position is that . . .no discovery is appropriate"); id., at 205 (same); 334 F. 3d, at
1106 ("As far as we can tell, petitioners never asked the dis-trict court to

narrow discovery to those matters [respond-ents] need to support their allegation that FACA applies to

the NEPDG." (emphasis in original)). In the Government'sview, "the resolution of the case ha[d] to flow from the administrative record" sans discovery. App. 192. Withouttaking up the District Court's suggestion of that court's
readiness to rein in discovery, see 219 F. Supp. 2d, at 54, theGovernment, on behalf of the Vice President, moved, unsuccessfully, for a protective order and for certification of aninterlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 1292(b). See
334 F. 3d, at 1100; see App. to Pet. for Cert. 47a (DistrictCourt denial of protective order); 233 F. Supp. 2d 16 (DC
2002) (District Court denial of $ 1292(b) certification).3 At
the District Court's hearing on the Government's motion fora stay pending interlocutory appeal, the Government argued

that "the injury is submitting to discovery in the absence ofa compelling showing of need by the [respondents]." App.
316; see 230 F. Supp. 2d 12 (DC 2002) (District Court orderdenying stay).

Despite the absence from this "flurry of activity," ante, at379, of any Government motion contesting the terms of the
discovery plan or proposing a scaled-down substitute plan,see 334 F. 3d, at 1106, this Court states that the Government

3 Section 1292(b) of Title 28 allows a court of appeals, "in its discretion," to entertain an appeal from an interlocutory order "[w]hen a district

opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation."

"did in fact object to the scope of discovery and asked the
District Court to narrow it in some way," ante, at 388. In
support of this statement, the Court points to the Government's objections to the proposed discovery plan, its response to the interrogatories and production requests, and
its contention that discovery would be unduly burdensome.
See ante, at 388-389; App. 166-184, 201, 231-234, 274.

True, the Government disputed the definition of the term
"meeting" in respondents' interrogatories, and stated, in
passing, that "discovery should be [both] limited to written
interrogatories" and "limited in scope to the issue of membership." Id., at 179, 181, 233.4 But as the Court of Appeals noted, the Government mentioned "excessive discovery" in support of its plea to be shielded from any discovery.
334 F. 3d, at 1106. The Government argument that "the
burden of doing a document production is an unconstitutional
burden," App. 274, was similarly anchored. The Government so urged at a District Court hearing in which its underlying "position [was] that it's not going to produce anything,"
id., at 249.5

4 On limiting discovery to the issue of membership, the Court of Appeals
indicated its agreement. See 334 F. 3d, at 1106 ("[Respondents] have no
need for the names of all persons who participated in [NEPDG]'s activities, nor a description of each person's role in the activities of [NEPDG].
They must discover only whether non-federal officials participated, and if
so, to what extent." (internal quotation marks, ellipsis, and brackets
omitted)).

5 According to the Government, "24 boxes of materials [are] potentially

responsive to [respondents'] discovery requests. . . . The documents identified as likely to be responsive from those boxes . . . are contained in approximately twelve boxes." App. 282-283. Each box "requires one to
two attorney days to review and prepare a rough privilege log. Following
that review, privilege logs must be finalized. Further, once the responsive emails are identified, printed, and numbered, [petitioners] expect that
the privilege review and logging process [will] be equally, if not more,
time-consuming, due to the expected quantity of individual emails." Id.,

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
The Government's bottom line was firmly and consistentlythat "review, limited to the administrative record, should

frame the resolution of this case." Id., at 181; accord id., at179, 233. That administrative record would "consist of the
Presidential Memorandum establishing NEPDG, NEPDG'spublic report, and the Office of the Vice President's response
to . . . Judicial Watch's request for permission to attendNEPDG meetings"; it would not include anything respondents could gain through discovery. Id., at 183. Indeed, theGovernment acknowledged before the District Court that its
litigation strategy involved opposition to the discovery planas a whole in lieu of focused objections. See

id., at 205 (Gov-ernment stated: "We did not choose to offer written objections to [the discovery plan] . . . .").Further sounding the Government's leitmotif, in a hearing
on the proposed discovery plan, the District Court statedthat the Government "didn't file objections" to rein in discovery "because [in the Government's view] no discovery isappropriate."

Id., at 192; id., at 205 (same). Without en-deavoring to correct any misunderstanding on the District

Court's part, the Government underscored its resistance toany and all discovery. Id., at 192-194; id., at 201 (asserting
that respondents are "not entitled to discovery to supple-ment [the administrative record]"). And in its motion for a
protective order, the Government similarly declared its un-qualified opposition to discovery. See Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion for a Protective Order and forReconsideration, C. A. Nos. 01-1530 (EGS), 02-631 (EGS),
p. 21 (D. D. C., Sept. 3, 2002) ("[Petitioners] respectfully re-quest that the Court enter a protective order relieving them
of any obligation to respond to [respondents'] discovery [re-quests]." (emphasis added)); see 334 F. 3d, at 1106 (same).

The District Court, in short, "ignored" no concrete pleasto "narrow" discovery. But see ante, at 388-390. That

court did, however, voice its concern about the Government'sfailure to heed the court's instructions:

"I told the government, if you have precise constitu-tional objections, let me know what they are so I can
determine whether or not this [discovery] plan is appro-priate, and . . . you said, well, it's unconstitutional, without elaborating. You said, because Plaintiffs' proposeddiscovery plan has not been approved by the court, the
Defendants are not submitting specific objections toPlaintiffs' proposed request. . . . My rule was, if you have
objections, let me know what the objections are, and youchose not to do so." App. 205.

B
Denied $ 1292(b) certification by the District Court, theGovernment sought a writ of mandamus from the Court of

Appeals. See id., at 339-365. In its mandamus petition,the Government asked the appellate court to "vacate the discovery orders issued by the district court, direct the courtto decide the case on the basis of the administrative record
and such supplemental affidavits as it may require, and di-rect that the Vice President be dismissed as a defendant."
Id., at 364-365. In support of those requests, the Govern-ment again argued that the case should be adjudicated without discovery: "The Constitution and principles of comitypreclude discovery of the President or Vice President, especially without a demonstration of compelling and focusedcountervailing interest." Id., at 360.

The Court of Appeals acknowledged that the discoveryplan presented by respondents and approved by the District

Court "goes well beyond what [respondents] need." 334F. 3d, at 1106. The appellate court nevertheless denied

the mandamus petition, concluding that the Government'sseparation-of-powers concern "remain[ed] hypothetical. "
Id., at 1105. Far from ordering immediate "disclosure ofcommunications between senior executive branch officials
and those with information relevant to advice that was being
formulated for the President," the Court of Appeals ob-served, the District Court had directed the Government initially to produce only "non-privileged documents and a privi-lege log."

Id., at 1104 (citation and internal quotation marks

could accommodate separation-of-powers concerns short ofdenying all discovery or compelling the invocation of executive privilege. See 334 F. 3d, at 1105-1106. Principally, theCourt of Appeals stated, discovery could be narrowed,
should the Government so move, to encompass only
"whether non-federal officials participated [in NEPDG], and
if so, to what extent." Id., at 1106. The Government could

as "hypothetical," not merely because no executive privilege had been
asserted, but also in light of measures the District Court could take to
"narrow" and "carefully focu[s]" discovery. See 334 F. 3d, at 1105, 1107.

"This Court repeatedly has observed that the writ of man-damus is an extraordinary remedy, to be reserved for extraordinary situations." Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v.
Mayacamas Corp., 485 U. S. 271, 289 (1988) (citing Kerr v.United States Dist. Court for Northern Dist. of Cal., 426

U. S. 394, 402 (1976)); see ante, at 380-381 (same). As theCourt reiterates, "the party seeking issuance of the writ
[must] have no other adequate means to attain the relief hedesires."

Kerr, 426 U. S., at 403 (citing Roche v. EvaporatedMilk Assn., 319 U. S. 21, 26 (1943)); ante, at 380-381.

Throughout this litigation, the Government has declinedto move for reduction of the District Court's discovery order
to accommodate separation-of-powers concerns. See supra,at 398-402. The Court now remands this case so the Court
of Appeals can consider whether a mandamus writ shouldissue ordering the District Court to "explore other avenues,
short of forcing the Executive to invoke privilege," and, inparticular, to "narrow, on its own, the scope of [discovery]."
Ante, at 390. Nothing in the District Court's orders or theCourt of Appeals' opinion, however, suggests that either
of those courts would refuse reasonably to accommodateseparation-of-powers concerns. See

supra, at 397, 398, 401-402, and this page. When parties seeking a mandamus writ

decline to avail themselves of opportunities to obtain relieffrom the District Court, a writ of mandamus ordering the
same relief--i. e., here, reined-in discovery--is surely adoubtful proposition.

The District Court, moreover, did not err in failing to nar-row discovery on its own initiative. Although the Court
cites United States v. Poindexter, 727 F. Supp. 1501 (DC1989), as "sound precedent" for district-court narrowing of

discovery, see ante, at 390, the target of the subpoena in
that case, former President Reagan, unlike petitioners in this
case, affirmatively requested such narrowing, 727 F. Supp.,
at 1503. A district court is not subject to criticism if it
awaits a party's motion before tightening the scope of discovery; certainly, that court makes no "clear and indisputable"
error in adhering to the principle of party initiation, Kerr,
426 U. S., at 403 (internal quotation marks omitted).8

8 The Court also questions the District Court's invocation of the federal
mandamus statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 1361, which provides that "[t]he district
courts shall have original jurisdiction of any action in the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency
thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff." See ante, at 390-391;
219 F. Supp. 2d, at 41-44. See also Chandler v. Judicial Council of Tenth
Circuit, 398 U. S. 74, 87-89, and n. 8 (1970) (holding mandamus under the
All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1651, improper, but expressing no opinion on
relief under the federal mandamus statute, $ 1361). On the question
whether $ 1361 allows enforcement of the FACA against the Vice President, the District Court concluded it "would be premature and inappropriate to determine whether the relief of mandamus will or will not issue."
219 F. Supp. 2d, at 44. The Government, moreover, contested the propriety of $ 1361 relief only in passing in its petition to the appeals court for

$ 1651 mandamus relief. See App. 363-364 (Government asserted in its
mandamus petition: "The more general writ of mandamus cannot be used
to circumvent . . . limits on the provision directly providing for review of
administrative action."). A question not decided by the District Court,
and barely raised in a petition for mandamus, hardly qualifies as grounds
for "drastic and extraordinary" mandamus relief, Ex parte Fahey, 332 U. S.
258, 259-260 (1947).

Justice Thomas urges that respondents cannot obtain $ 1361 relief if
"wide-ranging discovery [is needed] to prove that they have any right to
relief." Ante, at 395 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part)
(emphasis in original). First, as the Court of Appeals recognized, see
supra, at 402-403; infra, at 405, should the Government so move, the
District Court could contain discovery so that it would not be "wideranging." Second, all agree that an applicant seeking a $ 1361 mandamus
writ must show that "the [federal] defendant owes him a clear nondiscretionary duty." Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U. S. 602, 616 (1984) (emphasis
added). No $ 1361 writ may issue, in other words, when federal law
grants discretion to the federal officer, rather than imposing a duty on
him. When federal law imposes an obligation, however, suit under $ 1361

Review by mandamus at this stage of the proceedingswould be at least comprehensible as a means to test the Government's position that no discovery is appropriate in thislitigation. See Brief for Petitioners 45 ("[P]etitioners'
separation-of-powers arguments are . . . in the nature of aclaim of immunity from discovery."). But in remanding for

consideration of discovery-tailoring measures, the Court ap-parently rejects that no-discovery position. Otherwise, a
remand based on the overbreadth of the discovery requestswould make no sense. Nothing in the record, however, intimates lower court refusal to reduce discovery. Indeed, theappeals court has already suggested tailored discovery that
would avoid "effectively prejudg[ing] the merits of respond-ents' claim," ante, at 393 (

Stevens, J., concurring). See 334F. 3d, at 1106 (respondents "need only documents referring

to the involvement of non-federal officials"). See also ante,at 393, n. (

Stevens, J., concurring) ("A few interrogatoriesor depositions might have determined . . . whether any nonGovernment employees voted on NEPDG recommendationsor drafted portions of the committee's report"). In accord
with the Court of Appeals, I am "confident that [were itmoved to do so] the district court here [would] protect petitioners' legitimate interests and keep discovery within ap-propriate limits." 334 F. 3d, at 1107.

affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

is not precluded simply because facts must be developed to ascertain
whether a federal command has been dishonored. Congress enacted

$ 1361 to "mak[e] it more convenient for aggrieved persons to file actions
in the nature of mandamus," Stafford v. Briggs, 444 U. S. 527, 535 (1980),
not to address the rare instance in which a federal defendant, upon whom
the law unequivocally places an obligation, concedes his failure to measure
up to that obligation.

9 While I agree with the Court that an interlocutory appeal may become

appropriate at some later juncture in this litigation, see ante, at 391, I note
that the decision whether to allow such an appeal lies in the first instance
in the District Court's sound discretion, see 28 U. S. C. $ 1292(b); supra, at
398, n. 3.

BEARD, SECRETARY, PENNSYLVANIA DEPART-MENT OF CORRECTIONS,

et al. v. BANKS

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 02-1603. Argued February 24, 2004--Decided June 24, 2004
After respondent's murder conviction and death sentence were upheld by

the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, this Court decided Mills v. Maryland,
486 U. S. 367, and McKoy v. North Carolina, 494 U. S. 433, in which it
held invalid capital sentencing schemes requiring juries to disregard
mitigating factors not found unanimously. After respondent's state
postconviction Mills claim was rejected by the State Supreme Court on
the merits, he turned to the federal courts. Ultimately, the Third Circuit applied the analytical framework set forth in Teague v. Lane, 489
U. S. 288, under which federal habeas petitioners may not avail themselves of new rules of constitutional criminal procedure outside two narrow exceptions; concluded that Mills did not announce a new rule and
therefore could be applied retroactively; and granted respondent relief.

Held: Because Mills announced a new rule of constitutional criminal procedure that does not fall within either Teague exception, its rule cannot
be applied retroactively. Pp. 411-420.

(a) Teague analysis involves a three-step process requiring a court to
determine when a defendant's conviction became final; whether, given
the legal landscape at the time the conviction became final, the rule
sought to be applied is actually new; and, if so, whether it falls within
either of two exceptions to nonretroactivity. P. 411.

(b) Respondent's conviction became final before Mills was decided.
The normal rule for determining a state conviction's finality for retroactivity review--when the availability of direct appeal to the state courts
has been exhausted and the time for filing a certiorari petition has
elapsed or a timely petition has been finally denied--applies here. That
the Pennsylvania Supreme Court considered the merits of respondent's
Mills claim on collateral review does not change his conviction's finality
to a date subsequent to Mills. Pp. 411-413.

(c) Mills announced a new rule. In reaching its conclusion in Mills
and McKoy, this Court relied on a line of cases beginning with Lockett
v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586. Lockett's general rule that the sentencer must
be allowed to consider any mitigating evidence could be thought to support the conclusion in Mills and McKoy that capital sentencing schemes
cannot require juries to disregard mitigating factors not found unanimously, but it did not mandate the Mills rule. Each of the cases relied

Syllabus
on by Mills (and McKoy) considered only obstructions to the sentencer's
ability to consider mitigating evidence. Mills' innovation rests with its
shift in focus to individual jurors. Moreover, there is no need to guess
whether reasonable jurists could have differed as to whether the Lockett
line of cases compelled Mills. Four dissenting Justices in Mills reasoned that because nothing prevented the jury from hearing the mitigating evidence, Lockett did not control; and three dissenting Justices in
McKoy concluded that Lockett did not remotely support the new focus
on individual jurors. Because the Mills rule broke new ground, it applies to respondent on collateral review only if it falls under a Teague
exception. Pp. 413-416.

(d) The Mills rule does not fall within either exception. There is no
argument that the first exception applies here. And this Court has
repeatedly emphasized the limited scope of the second exception--for
" `watershed rules of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental
fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding,' " O'Dell v. Netherland,
521 U. S. 151, 157--which " `is clearly meant to apply only to a small core
of rules requiring observance of those procedures that . . . are implicit
in the concept of ordered liberty,' " ibid. This Court has yet to find a
new rule that falls under this exception. In providing guidance as to
what might do so, the Court has repeatedly, and only, referred to the
right-to-counsel rule of Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, which "alter[ed] [the Court's] understanding of the bedrock procedural elements
essential to the fairness of a proceeding," Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S.
227, 242. The Court has not hesitated to hold less sweeping and fundamental rules outside the exception. See, e. g., O'Dell v. Netherland,
supra. While Mills and McKoy were decided to avoid potentially arbitrary impositions of the death sentence, the Mills rule has "none of the
primacy and centrality of the rule adopted in Gideon," Saffle v. Parks,
494 U. S. 484, 495. It applies narrowly and works no fundamental shift
in the Court's " `understanding of the bedrock procedural elements' "
essential to fundamental fairness, O'Dell, supra, at 167. Pp. 416-420.

Opinion of the Court

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
In Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367 (1988), and McKoy v.
North Carolina, 494 U. S. 433 (1990), this Court held invalidcapital sentencing schemes that require juries to disregard

mitigating factors not found unanimously. In this case, wemust determine whether the rule announced in

Mills andMcKoy can be applied on federal habeas corpus review to a

defendant whose conviction became final in 1987. Under ourretroactivity analysis as set forth in Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S.
288 (1989), federal habeas corpus petitioners may not availthemselves of new rules of criminal procedure outside two
narrow exceptions. We conclude that Mills announceda new rule that does not fall within either of Teague's
exceptions. I

More than 20 years ago, a jury convicted respondent,George Banks, of 12 counts of first-degree murder, and the
trial court sentenced him to death. The facts of this caseare set forth in detail in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's
decision affirming respondent's conviction and sentence ondirect review. See

Commonwealth v. Banks, 513 Pa. 318,521 A. 2d 1 (1987). Direct review ended when this Court

denied certiorari on October 5, 1987. Banks v. Pennsylva-nia, 484 U. S. 873. Approximately eight months later, this
Court handed down its decision in Mills, supra, which an-nounced that the Constitution forbids States from imposing

Opinion of the Court
a requirement that the jury find a potential mitigating factorunanimously before that factor may be considered in the sentencing decision.Respondent pursued state postconviction relief on the theory that the instructions and verdict form given to the juryin his case violated the

Mills principle, but the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court rejected this claim on the merits. See Commonwealth v. Banks, 540 Pa. 143, 656 A. 2d 467 (1995). Re-spondent then turned to the federal courts. Although the

District Court denied relief, Banks v. Horn, 63 F. Supp. 2d525 (MD Pa. 1999), the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit
reversed respondent's death sentence, Banks v. Horn, 271
F. 3d 527 (2001). In reaching its decision, the Court of Appeals declined to apply the retroactivity analysis set forth in
Teague v. Lane, supra, to the question whether Mills applied
retroactively to respondent. This was not necessary, in the
Court of Appeals' view, because the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court had itself applied Mills. 271 F. 3d, at 543. We summarily reversed, holding that "in addition to performing any
analysis required by AEDPA [the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996], a federal court considering
a habeas petition must conduct a threshold Teague analysis
when the issue is properly raised by the state." Horn v.
Banks, 536 U. S. 266, 272 (2002) (per curiam) (Banks I).

On remand, the Court of Appeals considered the retroactive application of Mills. Banks v. Horn, 316 F. 3d 228 (CA3
2003). The court recognized that its primary task was to
determine whether Mills announced a new rule, and that
this, in turn, required it to ascertain whether the precedent
existing at the time respondent's conviction became final dictated or compelled the rule in Mills. 316 F. 3d, at 233-235.
From this Court's decisions in Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586
(1978), Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982), and their
direct progeny, the Court of Appeals distilled the rule that
the "Eighth Amendment prohibits any barrier to the sentencer's consideration of mitigating evidence." 316 F. 3d, at

410 BEARD v. BANKS

Opinion of the Court
239. The Court of Appeals characterized this Court's decision in Mills as "merely recogniz[ing] that the perceived
need for unanimity could constitute one such unconstitutional barrier," and concluded that the existing legal landscape compelled the decision in Mills. 316 F. 3d, at 240.
Accordingly, the court held that Mills applied retroactively
to respondent and reinstated the remainder of its previous
opinion, again granting respondent relief from his death
sentence.1

We granted the Commonwealth's second petition for certiorari in this case to decide whether Mills applies retroactively to respondent and, if so, whether the Pennsylvania Supreme Court unreasonably applied federal law in holding
that there was no Mills error in respondent's case. 539 U. S.
987 (2003). Although the Lockett/Eddings line of cases supports the Court's decision in Mills, it does not compel that
decision. Mills therefore announced a new rule. We are
also unable to conclude that the Mills rule falls under either
Teague exception. In particular, Mills did not announce a
"watershed rul[e] of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding."
Saffle v. Parks, 494 U. S. 484, 495 (1990) (internal quotation
marks omitted). Accordingly, we again reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.2

1 Judge Sloviter wrote separately to express her view that Mills v.
Maryland, 486 U. S. 367 (1988), established a new rule that qualified for
neither Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), exception. 316 F. 3d 228,
253-254 (CA3 2003) (opinion concurring in judgment). Judge Sloviter
nevertheless posited that Mills could be applied to respondent because of
Pennsylvania's "unique relaxed waiver doctrine in capital cases." 316 F.
3d, at 256.

2 Given our determination that the Court of Appeals erred in holding

that Mills applied retroactively to respondent, we do not reach the question whether the Court of Appeals also erred in concluding that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court unreasonably applied Mills.

Opinion of the Court

II
Under Teague, the determination whether a constitutionalrule of criminal procedure applies to a case on collateral review involves a three-step process. See, e. g., Lambrix v.
Singletary, 520 U. S. 518, 527 (1997). First, the court mustdetermine when the defendant's conviction became final.

Second, it must ascertain the "legal landscape as it then ex-isted," Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S. 461, 468 (1993), and ask
whether the Constitution, as interpreted by the precedentthen existing, compels the rule, Saffle, supra, at 488. That
is, the court must decide whether the rule is actually "new."Finally, if the rule is new, the court must consider whether it
falls within either of the two exceptions to nonretroactivity.
Lambrix, supra, at 527.3 A

Ordinarily, ascertaining the date on which a defendant'sconviction becomes final poses no difficulties: State convictions are final "for purposes of retroactivity analysis whenthe availability of direct appeal to the state courts has been
exhausted and the time for filing a petition for a writ of cer-tiorari has elapsed or a timely filed petition has been finally
denied." Caspari v. Bohlen, 510 U. S. 383, 390 (1994). Seealso Clay v. United States, 537 U. S. 522, 527 (2003). Respondent, however, urges a different rule. He argues that,in view of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's unique "relaxed
waiver rule"--pursuant to which that court considered hisMills claim on the merits--his conviction became final for
Teague purposes in 1995 when the State Supreme Court de-cided the

Mills claim against him. Brief for Respondent 25-31. Because of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's practice

3 Rules that fall within what we have referred to as Teague's first exception "are more accurately characterized as substantive rules not subject
to [Teague's] bar." Schriro v. Summerlin, ante, at 352, n. 4. See also
infra, at 416, and n. 7.

412 BEARD v. BANKS

Opinion of the Court
of considering forfeited claims in capital cases, respondentinsists, "conventional notions of `finality' " do not apply.

Id., at 27.In the past, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court did, in fact,
apply a "relaxed waiver rule" in death penalty cases. See,
e. g., Commonwealth v. DeHart, 539 Pa. 5, 25, 650 A. 2d 38,
48 (1994); Commonwealth v. Billa, 521 Pa. 168, 181, 555 A. 2d
835, 842 (1989). But this practice, which the court has aban-doned, see

Commonwealth v. Albrecht, 554 Pa. 31, 44-46, 720
A. 2d 693, 700 (1998), "was not absolute, but discretionary,"
Commonwealth v. Freeman, 573 Pa. 532, 557, n. 9, 827 A. 2d
385, 400, n. 9 (2003) (describing past practice). Notably, the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court has expressly stated, in a capital case, that it would decline to apply Mills retroactively.
Commonwealth v. Peterkin, 538 Pa. 455, 465, n. 4, 649 A. 2d
121, 126, n. 4 (1994).

A state court's past discretionary " `practice' [of] declin[ing] to apply ordinary waiver principles in capital cases,"
Albrecht, supra, at 44, 720 A. 2d, at 700, does not render
convictions and sentences that are no longer subject to direct
review nonfinal for Teague purposes. Such a judgment is
"final" despite the possibility that a state court might, in its
discretion, decline to enforce an available procedural bar and
choose to apply a new rule of law. Cf. Wainwright v. Sykes,
433 U. S. 72, 81-91 (1977).

Respondent's argument reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of Teague. Teague's nonretroactivity principle acts
as a limitation on the power of federal courts to grant "habeas corpus relief to . . . state prisoner[s]." Caspari, 510
U. S., at 389. That is why federal habeas corpus courts
"must apply Teague before considering the merits of [a]
claim," ibid., whenever the State raises the question, a point
we explained in Banks I, see 536 U. S., at 271. See also id.,
at 271-272 (explaining that the Court of Appeals had erred
by focusing only on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's treatment of respondent's Mills claim).

413Cite as: 542 U. S. 406 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
This should make clear that the Teague principle protectsnot only the reasonable judgments of state courts but also

the States' interest in finality quite apart from their courts.As Teague explained:

"In many ways the application of new rules to cases oncollateral review may be more intrusive than the enjoining of criminal prosecutions, cf. Younger v. Harris, 401U. S. 37, 43-54 (1971), for it continually forces the
States to marshal resources in order to keep in prisondefendants whose trials and appeals conformed to thenexisting constitutional standards." 489 U. S., at 310.
In short, our rule for determining when a state convictionbecomes final applies to this case without modification, and

we agree with the Court of Appeals that respondent's convic-tion became final in 1987. See 316 F. 3d, at 235.

B
We must therefore assay the legal landscape as of 1987 andask "whether the rule later announced in

[Mills] was dictated by then-existing precedent--whether, that is, the un-lawfulness of [respondent's] conviction was apparent to all

reasonable jurists." Lambrix, supra, at 527-528. In Mills,the Court held that the Constitution prohibits States from
requiring jurors to find mitigating factors unanimously.McKoy, 494 U. S., at 444; Mills, 486 U. S., at 374-375; id., at
384 (vacating death sentence because the jury instructionsgave rise to a "substantial probability that reasonable jurors
. . . may have thought they were precluded from consideringany mitigating evidence" not found unanimously).

4

In reaching its conclusion, the Court in Mills and McKoyrelied on a line of cases beginning with

Lockett v. Ohio, 438

4 Although nothing in this case turns on it, we note that it is arguable
that the "Mills rule" did not fully emerge until the Court issued McKoy
v. North Carolina, 494 U. S. 433 (1990). See id., at 459-463 (Scalia, J.,
dissenting).

414 BEARD v. BANKS

Opinion of the Court
U. S. 586 (1978) (plurality opinion), and Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982). In Lockett, a plurality of the
Court struck down Ohio's death penalty statute because itprevented the sentencer from "considering,

as a mitigating
factor," certain "aspect[s] of a defendant's character or rec-ord and [certain] circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffer[ed] as a basis for a sentence less than death."
438 U. S., at 604. A majority of the Court first embracedthis principle in

Eddings. There, the Court confronted a situation in which the sentencer had found, "as a matter of law[that it] was unable even to consider [potentially mitigating]

evidence." 455 U. S., at 113. The Court held that this limitation violated the Lockett rule. 455 U. S., at 113-115. See
also Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1, 4, 8-9 (1986)
(holding that States cannot, through evidentiary rules, exclude relevant mitigating evidence from the sentencer's
consideration).

In Mills, the Court noted that its previous cases did not
depend on the source of the potential barrier to the sentencer's ability to consider mitigating evidence. 486 U. S.,
at 375. The Court then asserted that "[t]he same [rule must
apply] with respect to a single juror's holdout vote against
finding the presence of a mitigating circumstance." Ibid.
See also McKoy, supra, at 441-443 (quoting Mills and performing the same analysis).

The generalized Lockett rule (that the sentencer must
be allowed to consider any mitigating evidence) could be
thought to support the Court's conclusion in Mills and
McKoy. But what is essential here is that it does not mandate the Mills rule. Each of the cases relied on by Mills
(and McKoy) specifically considered only obstructions to the
sentencer's ability to consider mitigating evidence. Mills'
innovation rests with its shift in focus to individual jurors.
We think it clear that reasonable jurists could have differed
as to whether the Lockett principle compelled Mills. See
Lambrix, 520 U. S., at 527-528.

Opinion of the Court
But there is no need to guess. In Mills, four Justices dis-sented, reasoning that because nothing prevented the jurors

from hearing any mitigating evidence that the defendantproffered, the Lockett principle did not control. 486 U. S., at
394 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.). In McKoy, three Justicesdissented, explaining that " `the principle established in
Lockett' does not remotely support" the new focus on indi-vidual jurors. 494 U. S., at 464 (opinion of

Scalia, J.); seeid., at 466 ("In short, Lockett and Eddings are quite simply

irrelevant to the question before us . . ."); see also id., at452-453 (

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (noting thatthe Court "stretche[d]" the

Lockett cases "beyond theirproper bounds"). The dissent in McKoy stressed the

Court's move from jury to juror. See 494 U. S., at 465-466(opinion of

Scalia, J.). Indeed, prior to Mills, none of theCourt's relevant cases addressed individual jurors, see,

e. g.,Hitchcock v. Dugger, 481 U. S. 393 (1987), a trend that continued even after Mills, see, e. g., Saffle v. Parks, 494 U. S. 484(1990);

Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302 (1989); Franklin v.Lynaugh, 487 U. S. 164 (1988).

The McKoy dissent also explained that the Mills rule gov-erns how the sentencer considers evidence, not what evidence it considers. In the dissent's view, the Lockett linegoverned the latter but not the former. See 494 U. S., at
465-466 (opinion of Scalia, J.). For this distinction, the dis-sent relied on Saffle v. Parks, supra, decided the same day.
There, the Court held that the Lockett line of cases did notcompel (assuming it informed) the sought-for rule that States
may not "instruct the sentencer to render its decision on theevidence without sympathy." 494 U. S., at 490. The Court
observed:

"Parks asks us to create a rule relating, not to whatmitigating evidence the jury must be permitted to consider in making its sentencing decision, but to how itmust consider the mitigating evidence. There is a simple and logical difference between rules that govern

416 BEARD v. BANKS

Opinion of the Court
what factors the jury must be permitted to consider in
making its sentencing decision and rules that govern
how the State may guide the jury in considering and
weighing those factors in reaching a decision." Ibid.

Thus, although the Lockett principle--conceived of at a high
level of generality--could be thought to support the Mills
rule, reasonable jurists differed even as to this point. It
follows a fortiori that reasonable jurists could have concluded that the Lockett line of cases did not compel Mills.5
Given the brand new attention Mills paid to individual jurors and the relevance of the what/how distinction drawn in
Saffle (which again distinguishes Mills from the Lockett
line), we must conclude that the Mills rule "br[o]k[e] new
ground," Teague, 489 U. S., at 301.6 Accordingly, Mills announced a new rule, which does not apply to respondent on
collateral review, unless, of course, it falls under one of
Teague's exceptions.

C

Teague's bar on retroactive application of new rules of constitutional criminal procedure has two exceptions. First,
the bar does not apply to rules forbidding punishment "of
certain primary conduct [or to] rules prohibiting a certain
category of punishment for a class of defendants because of
their status or offense." Penry, supra, at 330; see also

5 Because the focus of the inquiry is whether reasonable jurists could
differ as to whether precedent compels the sought-for rule, we do not
suggest that the mere existence of a dissent suffices to show that the
rule is new.

6 The Court of Appeals erred by drawing from Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S.

586 (1978), and Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982), the general rule
that "the Constitution prohibited any barrier to the jury's consideration of
mitigating evidence," 316 F. 3d, at 241-243 (emphasis added), without also
acknowledging that the rule, for purposes of the Teague analysis, did not
automatically extend to arguably analogous contexts. It is with respect
to this last point that reasonable jurists did in fact differ.

Opinion of the Court
O'Dell v. Netherland, 521 U. S. 151, 157 (1997).7 There isno argument that this exception applies here. The second

exception is for " `watershed rules of criminal procedure im-plicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.' " Ibid. (quoting Graham, 506 U. S., at 478).We have repeatedly emphasized the limited scope of the
second Teague exception, explaining that " `it is clearlymeant to apply only to a small core of rules requiring observance of those procedures that . . . are implicit in the conceptof ordered liberty.' "

O'Dell, supra, at 157 (quoting Graham,supra, at 478). And, because any qualifying rule " `would

be so central to an accurate determination of innocence orguilt [that it is] unlikely that many such components of basic
due process have yet to emerge,' " Graham, supra, at 478(quoting Teague, supra, at 313), it should come as no surprise
that we have yet to find a new rule that falls under the sec-ond Teague exception. Perhaps for this reason, respondent
does not even attempt to argue that Mills qualifies or torebut petitioners' argument that it does not, Brief for Petitioners 23-26.In providing guidance as to what might fall within this
exception, we have repeatedly referred to the rule of Gideonv.

Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963) (right to counsel), andonly to this rule. See,

e. g., Saffle, supra, at 495; cf. Gilmore
v. Taylor, 508 U. S. 333, 364 (1993) (Blackmun, J., dissenting).
Gideon overruled Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455 (1942), noting
that Betts itself had "made an abrupt break with [theCourt's] well-considered precedents." 372 U. S., at 344.

The Court continued:

"Lawyers to prosecute are everywhere deemed essential
to protect the public's interest in an orderly society.Similarly, there are few defendants charged with crime,

few indeed, who fail to hire the best lawyers they can
7 As noted above, these rules are more properly viewed as substantive
and therefore not subject to Teague's bar. See n. 3, supra.

Opinion of the Court
get to prepare and present their defenses. That gov-ernment hires lawyers to prosecute and defendants who

have the money hire lawyers to defend are the strongestindications of the widespread belief that lawyers in
criminal courts are necessities, not luxuries. The rightof one charged with crime to counsel may not be deemed
fundamental and essential to fair trials in some countries, but it is in ours. From the very beginning, ourstate and national constitutions and laws have laid

great emphasis on procedural and substantive safe-guards designed to assure fair trials before impartial
tribunals in which every defendant stands equal beforethe law. This noble ideal cannot be realized if the poor
man charged with crime has to face his accusers with-out a lawyer to assist him." Ibid. (emphasis added).

See also id., at 344-345 (quoting Powell v. Alabama, 287U. S. 45, 68-69 (1932)). Gideon, it is fair to say, "alter[ed]
our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements essen-tial to the fairness of a proceeding." Sawyer v. Smith, 497
U. S. 227, 242 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted).By contrast, we have not hesitated to hold that less sweeping and fundamental rules do not fall within Teague's secondexception. In O'Dell v. Netherland, supra, for example, we
considered the retroactivity of the rule announced in Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U. S. 154 (1994). Simmonsheld that a capital defendant must be allowed to inform the

sentencer that he would be ineligible for parole if the pros-ecution argues future dangerousness. We rejected the petitioner's argument that the Simmons rule was " `on par'with Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963)," emphasizing "the sweeping [nature] of Gideon, which established anaffirmative right to counsel in all felony cases." O'Dell,
supra, at 167.And, in Sawyer v. Smith, supra, we considered whether a
habeas petitioner could make use of the rule announced in
Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320, 323 (1985) (holding

Opinion of the Court
that the Eighth Amendment bars imposition of the deathpenalty by a jury that had been led to believe that responsibility for the ultimate decision rested elsewhere). There toowe declined to give retroactive effect to a rule that effectively withheld relevant information from the sentencer.See

Sawyer, supra, at 242-245. We acknowledged that the
Caldwell rule was intended to enhance "the accuracy of capital sentencing." 497 U. S., at 244. But because it effectedan incremental change, we could not conclude that "this systemic rule enhancing reliability is an `absolute prerequisiteto fundamental fairness.' "

Ibid. (quoting Teague, 489 U. S.,
at 314). See also Graham, supra, at 478 (concluding that
the rule announced in Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302
(1989), does not fall within the second Teague exception).

We recognize that avoidance of potentially arbitrary impositions of the death sentence motivated the Court in Mills
and McKoy. Mills described two troubling situations that
could theoretically occur absent the Mills rule. Eleven of
twelve jurors, could, for example, agree that six mitigating
circumstances existed, but one holdout juror could nevertheless force the death sentence. Similarly, all 12 jurors could
agree that some mitigating circumstances existed and that
these outweighed any aggravators, but because they did not
agree on which mitigating circumstances were present, they
would again have to return a death sentence. See Mills,
486 U. S., at 373-374; see also McKoy, 494 U. S., at 439-440
(describing these examples). Imposition of the death penalty in these circumstances, the Court reasoned, "would be
the `height of arbitrariness.' " Id., at 440 (quoting Mills,
supra, at 374). See also McKoy, supra, at 454 (Kennedy,
J., concurring in judgment).

Quite obviously, the Court decided Mills and McKoy as it
did to avoid this possibility. But because "[a]ll of our Eighth
Amendment jurisprudence concerning capital sentencing is
directed toward the enhancement of reliability and accuracy
in some sense," the fact that a new rule removes some re542US2 Unit: $U72 [10-25-06 15:39:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Stevens, J., dissenting
mote possibility of arbitrary infliction of the death sentencedoes not suffice to bring it within Teague's second exception.

Sawyer, supra, at 243.However laudable the Mills rule might be, "it has none of
the primacy and centrality of the rule adopted in Gideon."Saffle, 494 U. S., at 495. The Mills rule applies fairly narrowly and works no fundamental shift in "our understandingof the

bedrock procedural elements" essential to fundamen-tal fairness. O'Dell, 521 U. S., at 167 (internal quotation

marks omitted). We therefore conclude that the Mills ruledoes not fall within the second Teague exception.

III
We hold that Mills announced a new rule of constitutionalcriminal procedure that falls within neither Teague exception. Accordingly, that rule cannot be applied retroactivelyto respondent. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

A capital sentencing procedure that required the jury toreturn a death sentence if even a single juror supported that

outcome would be the " ` "height of arbitrariness." ' " Ante,at 419. The use of such a procedure is unquestionably unconstitutional today, and I believe it was equally so in 1987when respondent's death sentence became final. The Court
reaches a different conclusion because it reads Mills v.
Maryland, 486 U. S. 367 (1988), to announce a "new rule" ofcriminal procedure that may not be applied on federal habeas

review to defendants whose convictions became final beforeMills was decided. Ante, at 408. In my opinion, however,
Mills simply represented a straightforward application ofour longstanding view that "the Eighth and Fourteenth

concurring).The dispute in Mills concerned jury instructions and a
verdict form that the majority read to create a "substantialprobability that reasonable jurors . . . well may have thought
they were precluded from considering any mitigating evi-dence unless all 12 jurors agreed on the existence of a particular such circumstance." 486 U. S., at 384. The resultingunanimity requirement, the majority concluded, violated the
Constitution in that it "allow[ed] a `holdout' juror to preventthe other jurors from considering mitigating evidence."
McKoy v. North Carolina, 494 U. S. 433, 438 (1990) (quoting
Mills, 486 U. S., at 375). When Mills was decided, therewas nothing novel about acknowledging that permitting one

death-prone juror to control the entire jury's sentencing deci-sion would be arbitrary. That acknowledgment was a natural outgrowth of our cases condemning mandatory impositionof the death penalty,

Roberts v. Louisiana, 431 U. S. 633(1977) (per curiam); Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S.

280 (1976) (plurality opinion), recognizing that arbitrary im-position of that penalty violates the Eighth Amendment,

e. g., Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 874 (1983); Gregg v.Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 189 (1976); Furman, supra, and mandating procedures that guarantee full consideration of miti1 Justice Kennedy made precisely this point in his concurrence in
McKoy v. North Carolina, 494 U. S. 433, 454 (1990):

"Application of the death penalty on the basis of a single juror's vote is
`intuitively disturbing.' . . . More important, it represents imposition of
capital punishment through a system that can be described as arbitrary
or capricious. The Court in Mills described such a result as the `height
of arbitrariness.' . . . Given this description, it is apparent that the result
in Mills fits within our line of cases forbidding the imposition of capital
punishment on the basis of `caprice,' in `an arbitrary and unpredictable
fashion,' or through `arbitrary' or `freakish' means."

gating evidence, e. g., Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104
(1982); Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978) (plurality opinion). Indeed, in my judgment, the kind of arbitrariness that
would enable 1 vote in favor of death to outweigh 11 in favor
of forbearance would violate the bedrock fairness principles
that have governed our trial proceedings for centuries. Rejecting such a manifestly unfair procedural innovation does
not announce a "new rule" covered by Teague v. Lane, 489
U. S. 288, 301-302 (1989), but simply affirms that our fairness
principles do not permit blatant exceptions.2

This leaves only the question whether reasonable jurors
could have read Pennsylvania's jury instructions and verdict

2 Supporting this reading, even the dissenting Justices in Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367 (1988), did not challenge the majority's assumption that
instructions unambiguously requiring unanimity on the existence of any
mitigating factor would be unconstitutional; they argued only that reasonable jurors would have understood that in order "to mark `no' to each
mitigating factor on the sentencing form, all 12 jurors [had to] agree."
Id., at 394 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting) (emphasis added). I recognize
that some Justices believe the Mills Court had no occasion to consider the
constitutionality of a unanimity requirement because the State had conceded the point. See McKoy, 494 U. S., at 459 (Scalia, J., dissenting)
("Although there is language in Mills . . . suggesting that a unanimity
requirement would contravene this Court's decisions . . . , that issue plainly
was not presented in Mills, and can therefore not have been decided").
Mills' author, Justice Blackmun, disagreed with this view, however: "[T]he
Maryland instructions [at issue in Mills] were held to be invalid because
they were susceptible of two plausible interpretations, and under one of
those interpretations the instructions were unconstitutional." McKoy,
494 U. S., at 445 (concurring opinion) (emphasis in original).

I think Justice Blackmun had the better of this argument, but even
if one assumes the Mills dissenters failed to defend the constitutionality of unanimity requirements because they did not think the issue properly before the Court rather than because they, too, condemned such requirements, my overall point remains the same: executing a defendant
when only 1 of his 12 jurors believes that to be the appropriate penalty
would be "so wanto[n] and so freakis[h]" as to violate the Eighth and
Fourteenth Amendments, Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, 310 (1972)
(Stewart, J., concurring), and that violation would have been as clear in
1987 as today.

I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,dissenting.

I join Justice Stevens's dissenting opinion in this case.I add this word about the way I see its relation to

Justice
Breyer's dissenting opinion in Schriro v. Summerlin, ante,p. 358, and to other cases in the line that began with

Teague
v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989).In determining whether

Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367
(1988), states a new rule of constitutional law for purpose of
Teague's general bar to applying such rules on collateral review, the Court invokes the perspective of " `all reasonable
jurists,' " ante, at 413 (quoting Lambrix v. Singletary, 520U. S. 518, 528 (1997)); see also

ante, at 414-416. It acknowledges, however, that this standard is objective, so that thepresence of actual disagreement among jurists and even

among Members of this Court does not conclusively establisha rule's novelty.

Ante, at 416, n. 5; cf. Wright v. West, 505
U. S. 277, 304 (1992) (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).
This objectively reasonable jurist is a cousin to the common
law's reasonable person, whose job is to impose a judicially
determined standard of conduct on litigants who come before
the court. Similarly, the function of Teague's reasonablejurist standard is to distinguish those developments in this
Court's jurisprudence that state judges should have anticipated from those they could not have been expected to
foresee.

In applying Teague, this Court engages in an ongoing process of defining the characteristics of a reasonable jurist,

542US2 Unit: $U72 [10-25-06 15:39:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN
424 BEARD v. BANKS

Souter, J., dissenting
by identifying arguments that reasonable jurists would orwould not accept. The particular characteristic at stake

here is the degree to which a reasonable jurist would avoidthe risk of a certain kind of erroneous outcome in a capital
case. Mills's rule protects against essentially the same kindof error that

Justice Breyer discusses in Summerlin: a
death sentence that is arbitrary because it is inaccurate as a
putative expression of " `the conscience of the community onthe ultimate question of life or death,' "

ante, at 360 (dissenting opinion) (quoting Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510,519 (1968)).

Justice Breyer has explained in his Summerlin opinion why some new rules demanding that kind of accuracy should be applied through a Teague exception, and our
longstanding espousal of accurate expression of community
conscience should also inform our judgment, in any debatable
case, about the newness of a rule.

As Justice Stevens says, a death sentence based upon a
verdict by 11 jurors who would have relied on a given mitigating circumstance to spare a defendant's life, and a single
holdout who blocked them from doing so, would surely be an
egregious failure to express the public conscience accurately.
Ante, at 420-421 (dissenting opinion). The question presented by this case is ultimately whether the Court should
deem reasonable, and thus immunize from collateral attack,
at least at the first Teague stage, a reading of its pre-Mills
precedents that accepts the risk of such errors that Maryland's or Pennsylvania's jury instructions and verdict form
would have produced.

The Court concludes that, as compared with Eddings v.
Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982), Mills "shift[ed] . . . focus"
from "obstructions to the sentencer's ability to consider mitigating evidence" to the abilities of "individual jurors" to do
so, and that a reasonable jurist could have drawn a distinction on this basis. Ante, at 414. This approach gives considerable weight to a reasonable jurist's analytical capacity
to pick out arguably material differences between sets of

facts, and relatively less to the jurist's understanding of thesubstance of the principles underlying our Eighth Amendment cases that follow Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238(1972) (per curiam). Although the Court's view of the
reasonable jurist is not inconsistent with some of Teague'sprogeny,* for the reasons given in

Justice Breyer's dissentin
Summerlin, ante, at 362-365, 365-366, I am now con-vinced that this reading of

Teague gives too much impor-tance to the finality of capital sentences and not enough to

their accuracy. I would affirm the judgment of the Court ofAppeals, and respectfully dissent.

*See, e. g., O'Dell v. Netherland, 521 U. S. 151, 157-166 (1997) (holding

RUMSFELD, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE v. PADILLA

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 03-1027. Argued April 28, 2004--Decided June 28, 2004
Respondent Padilla, a United States citizen, was brought to New York for

detention in federal criminal custody after federal agents apprehended
him while executing a material witness warrant issued by the District
Court for the Southern District of New York (Southern District) in connection with its grand jury investigation into the September 11, 2001,
al Qaeda terrorist attacks. While his motion to vacate the warrant was
pending, the President issued an order to Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld designating Padilla an "enemy combatant" and directing that he be
detained in military custody. Padilla was later moved to a Navy brig
in Charleston, S. C., where he has been held ever since. His counsel
then filed in the Southern District a habeas petition under 28 U. S. C.

$ 2241, which, as amended, alleged that Padilla's military detention violates the Constitution, and named as respondents the President, the Secretary, and Melanie Marr, the brig's commander. The Government
moved to dismiss, arguing, inter alia, that Commander Marr, as Padilla's immediate custodian, was the only proper respondent, and that the
District Court lacked jurisdiction over her because she is located outside
the Southern District. That court held that the Secretary's personal
involvement in Padilla's military custody rendered him a proper respondent, and that it could assert jurisdiction over the Secretary under
New York's long-arm statute, notwithstanding his absence from the District. On the merits, the court accepted the Government's contention
that the President has authority as Commander in Chief to detain as
enemy combatants citizens captured on American soil during a time of
war. The Second Circuit agreed that the Secretary was a proper respondent and that the Southern District had jurisdiction over the Secretary under New York's long-arm statute. The appeals court reversed
on the merits, however, holding that the President lacks authority to
detain Padilla militarily.

Held:

1. Because this Court answers the jurisdictional question in the negative, it does not reach the question whether the President has authority
to detain Padilla militarily. P. 430.

2. The Southern District lacks jurisdiction over Padilla's habeas petition. Pp. 434-451.

(a) Commander Marr is the only proper respondent to Padilla's petition because she, not Secretary Rumsfeld, is Padilla's custodian. The
federal habeas statute straightforwardly provides that the proper respondent is "the person" having custody over the petitioner. $$ 2242,
2243. Its consistent use of the definite article indicates that there is
generally only one proper respondent, and the custodian is "the person"
with the ability to produce the prisoner's body before the habeas court,
see Wales v. Whitney, 114 U. S. 564, 574. In accord with the statutory
language and Wales' immediate custodian rule, longstanding federalcourt practice confirms that, in "core" habeas challenges to present
physical confinement, the default rule is that the proper respondent is
the warden of the facility where the prisoner is being held, not the
Attorney General or some other remote supervisory official. No exceptions to this rule, either recognized or proposed, apply here. Padilla
does not deny the immediate custodian rule's general applicability, but
argues that the rule is flexible and should not apply on the unique facts
of this case. The Court disagrees. That the Court's understanding of
custody has broadened over the years to include restraints short of
physical confinement does nothing to undermine the rationale or statutory foundation of the Wales rule where, in core proceedings such as
the present, physical custody is at issue. Indeed, that rule has consistently been applied in this core context. The Second Circuit erred in
taking the view that this Court has relaxed the immediate custodian
rule with respect to prisoners detained for other than federal criminal
violations, and in holding that the proper respondent is the person exercising the "legal reality of control" over the petitioner. The statute
itself makes no such distinction, nor does the Court's case law support
a deviation from the immediate custodian rule here. Rather, the cases
Padilla cites stand for the simple proposition that the immediate physical custodian rule, by its terms, does not apply when a habeas petitioner
challenges something other than his present physical confinement. See,
e. g., Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky., 410 U. S. 484; Strait
v. Laird, 406 U. S. 341. That is not the case here: Marr exercises dayto-day control over Padilla's physical custody. The petitioner cannot
name someone else just because Padilla's physical confinement stems
from a military order by the President. Identification of the party exercising legal control over the detainee only comes into play when there
is no immediate physical custodian. Ex parte Endo, 323 U. S. 283, 304-
305, distinguished. Although Padilla's detention is unique in many respects, it is at bottom a simple challenge to physical custody imposed
by the Executive. His detention is thus not unique in any way that

would provide arguable basis for a departure from the immediate custodian rule. Pp. 434-442.

(b) The Southern District does not have jurisdiction over Commander Marr. Section 2241(a)'s language limiting district courts to
granting habeas relief "within their respective jurisdictions" requires
"that the court issuing the writ have jurisdiction over the custodian,"
Braden, supra, at 495. Because Congress added the "respective jurisdictions" clause to prevent judges anywhere from issuing the Great Writ
on behalf of applicants far distantly removed, Carbo v. United States,
364 U. S. 611, 617, the traditional rule has always been that habeas relief
is issuable only in the district of confinement, id., at 618. This commonsense reading is supported by other portions of the habeas statute, e. g.,

$ 2242, and by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 22(a). Congress
has also legislated against the background of the "district of confinement" rule by fashioning explicit exceptions: E. g., when a petitioner is
serving a state criminal sentence in a State containing more than one
federal district, "the district . . . wherein [he] is in custody" and "the
district . . . within which the State court was held which convicted and
sentenced him" have "concurrent jurisdiction," $ 2241(d). Such exceptions would have been unnecessary if, as the Second Circuit believed,

$ 2241 permits a prisoner to file outside the district of confinement. Despite this ample statutory and historical pedigree, Padilla urges that,
under Braden and Strait, jurisdiction lies in any district in which the
respondent is amenable to service of process. The Court disagrees, distinguishing those two cases. Padilla seeks to challenge his present
physical custody in South Carolina. Because the immediate custodian
rule applies, the proper respondent is Commander Marr, who is present
in South Carolina. There is thus no occasion to designate a "nominal"
custodian and determine whether he or she is "present" in the same
district as petitioner. The habeas statute's "respective jurisdictions"
proviso forms an important corollary to the immediate custodian rule
in challenges to present physical custody under $ 2241. Together they
compose a simple rule that has been consistently applied in the lower
courts, including in the context of military detentions: Whenever a

$ 2241 habeas petitioner seeks to challenge his present physical custody
within the United States, he should name his warden as respondent and
file the petition in the district of confinement. This rule serves the
important purpose of preventing forum shopping by habeas petitioners. The District of South Carolina, not the Southern District of New
York, was where Padilla should have brought his habeas petition.

Opinion of the Court
Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.

Respondent Jose Padilla is a United States citizen de-tained by the Department of Defense pursuant to the President's determination that he is an "enemy combatant" whoconspired with al Qaeda to carry out terrorist attacks in the
United States. We confront two questions: First, did Padillaproperly file his habeas petition in the Southern District of
New York; and second, did the President possess authorityto detain Padilla militarily. We answer the threshold question in the negative and thus do not reach the second ques-tion presented.

Because we do not decide the merits, we only briefly recount the relevant facts. On May 8, 2002, Padilla flew fromPakistan to Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. As he

stepped off the plane, Padilla was apprehended by federalagents executing a material witness warrant issued by the

Opinion of the Court
New York (Southern District) in connection with its grand
jury investigation into the September 11th terrorist attacks.
Padilla was then transported to New York, where he was
held in federal criminal custody. On May 22, acting through
appointed counsel, Padilla moved to vacate the material witness warrant.

Padilla's motion was still pending when, on June 9, the
President issued an order to Secretary of Defense Donald
H. Rumsfeld designating Padilla an "enemy combatant" and
directing the Secretary to detain him in military custody.
App. D to Brief for Petitioner 5a (June 9 Order). In support
of this action, the President invoked his authority as "Commander in Chief of the U. S. armed forces" and the Authorization for Use of Military Force Joint Resolution, Pub. L.
107-40, 115 Stat. 224 (AUMF),1 enacted by Congress on
September 18, 2001. June 9 Order 5a. The President

also made several factual findings explaining his decision to
designate Padilla an enemy combatant.2 Based on these
findings, the President concluded that it is "consistent with
U. S. law and the laws of war for the Secretary of Defense
to detain Mr. Padilla as an enemy combatant." Id., at 6a.

1 The AUMF provides in relevant part: "[T]he President is authorized
to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided
the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored
such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons." 115 Stat. 224.

2 In short, the President "[d]etermine[d]" that Padilla (1) "is closely associated with al Qaeda, an international terrorist organization with which
the United States is at war;" (2) that he "engaged in . . . hostile and
war-like acts, including . . . preparation for acts of international terrorism"
against the United States; (3) that he "possesses intelligence" about al
Qaeda that "would aid U. S. efforts to prevent attacks by al Qaeda on the
United States"; and finally, (4) that he "represents a continuing, present
and grave danger to the national security of the United States," such that
his military detention "is necessary to prevent him from aiding al Qaeda
in its efforts to attack the United States." June 9 Order 5a-6a.

432 RUMSFELD v. PADILLA

Opinion of the Court
That same day, Padilla was taken into custody by Department of Defense officials and transported to the Consolidated
Naval Brig in Charleston, South Carolina.3 He has been
held there ever since.

On June 11, Padilla's counsel, claiming to act as his next
friend, filed in the Southern District a habeas corpus petition
under 28 U. S. C. $ 2241. The petition, as amended, alleged
that Padilla's military detention violates the Fourth, Fifth,
and Sixth Amendments and the Suspension Clause, Art. I,

$ 9, cl. 2, of the United States Constitution. The amended
petition named as respondents President Bush, Secretary
Rumsfeld, and Melanie A. Marr, Commander of the Consolidated Naval Brig.

The Government moved to dismiss, arguing that Commander Marr, as Padilla's immediate custodian, is the only
proper respondent to his habeas petition, and that the District Court lacks jurisdiction over Commander Marr because
she is located outside the Southern District. On the merits,
the Government contended that the President has authority
to detain Padilla militarily pursuant to the Commander in
Chief Clause of the Constitution, Art. II, $ 2, cl. 1, the congressional AUMF, and this Court's decision in Ex parte
Quirin, 317 U. S. 1 (1942).

The District Court issued its decision in December 2002.
Padilla ex rel. Newman v. Bush, 233 F. Supp. 2d 564. The
court held that the Secretary's "personal involvement" in
Padilla's military custody renders him a proper respondent
to Padilla's habeas petition, and that it can assert jurisdiction
over the Secretary under New York's long-arm statute, not3 Also on June 9, the Government notified the District Court ex parte of
the President's order; informed the court that it was transferring Padilla
into military custody in South Carolina and that it was consequently withdrawing its grand jury subpoena of Padilla; and asked the court to vacate
the material witness warrant. Padilla ex rel. Newman v. Bush, 233
F. Supp. 2d 564, 571 (SDNY 2002). The court vacated the warrant. Ibid.

Opinion of the Court
withstanding his absence from the Southern District.4 Id.,
at 581-587. On the merits, however, the court accepted the
Government's contention that the President has authority to
detain as enemy combatants citizens captured on American
soil during a time of war. Id., at 587-599.5

The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed.
352 F. 3d 695 (2003). The court agreed with the District
Court that Secretary Rumsfeld is a proper respondent, reasoning that in cases where the habeas petitioner is detained
for "other than federal criminal violations, the Supreme
Court has recognized exceptions to the general practice of
naming the immediate physical custodian as respondent."
Id., at 704-708. The Court of Appeals concluded that on
these "unique" facts Secretary Rumsfeld is Padilla's custodian because he exercises "the legal reality of control" over
Padilla and because he was personally involved in Padilla's
military detention. Id., at 707-708. The Court of Appeals
also affirmed the District Court's holding that it has jurisdiction over the Secretary under New York's long-arm statute.
Id., at 708-710.

Reaching the merits, the Court of Appeals held that the
President lacks authority to detain Padilla militarily. Id., at
710-724. The court concluded that neither the President's

4 The court dismissed Commander Marr, Padilla's immediate custodian,
reasoning that she would be obliged to obey any order the court directed
to the Secretary. Id., at 583. The court also dismissed President Bush
as a respondent, a ruling Padilla does not challenge. Id., at 582-583.

5 Although the District Court upheld the President's authority to detain

domestically captured enemy combatants, it rejected the Government's
contentions that Padilla has no right to challenge the factual basis for his
detention and that he should be denied access to counsel. Instead, the
court held that the habeas statute affords Padilla the right to controvert
alleged facts, and granted him monitored access to counsel to effectuate
that right. Id., at 599-605. Finally, the court announced that after it
received Padilla's factual proffer, it would apply a deferential "some evidence" standard to determine whether the record supports the President's
designation of Padilla as an enemy combatant. Id., at 605-608.

Opinion of the Court
Commander in Chief power nor the AUMF authorizes mili-tary detentions of American citizens captured on American

soil. Id., at 712-718, 722-723. To the contrary, the Courtof Appeals found in both our case law and in the NonDetention Act, 18 U. S. C. $ 4001(a),6 a strong presumptionagainst domestic military detention of citizens absent explicit
congressional authorization. 352 F. 3d, at 710-722. Ac-cordingly, the court granted the writ of habeas corpus and
directed the Secretary to release Padilla from military cus-tody within 30 days.

Id., at 724.We granted the Government's petition for certiorari to review the Court of Appeals' rulings with respect to the juris-dictional and the merits issues, both of which raise important
questions of federal law. 540 U. S. 1173 (2004).7The question whether the Southern District has jurisdiction over Padilla's habeas petition breaks down into two re-lated subquestions. First, who is the proper respondent to
that petition? And second, does the Southern District havejurisdiction over him or her? We address these questions
in turn. I

The federal habeas statute straightforwardly providesthat the proper respondent to a habeas petition is "the
person who has custody over [the petitioner]." 28 U. S. C.$ 2242; see also $ 2243 ("The writ, or order to show cause
shall be directed to the person having custody of the persondetained"). The consistent use of the definite article in reference to the custodian indicates that there is generally onlyone proper respondent to a given prisoner's habeas petition.

6 Section 4001(a) provides that "[n]o citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of
Congress."

7 The word "jurisdiction," of course, is capable of different interpretations. We use it in the sense that it is used in the habeas statute, 28
U. S. C. $ 2241(a), and not in the sense of subject-matter jurisdiction of the
District Court.

Opinion of the Court
This custodian, moreover, is "the person" with the ability toproduce the prisoner's body before the habeas court. Ibid.

We summed up the plain language of the habeas statute over100 years ago in this way: "[T]hese provisions contemplate a
proceeding against some person who has the immediate cus-tody of the party detained, with the power to produce the
body of such party before the court or judge, that he may beliberated if no sufficient reason is shown to the contrary."
Wales v. Whitney, 114 U. S. 564, 574 (1885) (emphasis added);see also

Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky., 410U. S. 484, 494-495 (1973) ("The writ of habeas corpus" acts

upon "the person who holds [the detainee] in what is allegedto be unlawful custody," citing

In re Jackson, 15 Mich. 417, 439-440 (1867)).
In accord with the statutory language and Wales' immedi-ate custodian rule, longstanding practice confirms that in habeas challenges to present physical confinement--"core chal-lenges"--the default rule is that the proper respondent is the
warden of the facility where the prisoner is being held, not
the Attorney General or some other remote supervisory of-ficial. See,

e. g., Hogan v. Hanks, 97 F. 3d 189, 190 (CA7
1996); Brittingham v. United States, 982 F. 2d 378, 379 (CA91992);

8 No exceptions to this rule, either recog8 In Ahrens v. Clark, 335 U. S. 188 (1948), we left open the question
whether the Attorney General is a proper respondent to a habeas petition
filed by an alien detained pending deportation. Id., at 189, 193. The
lower courts have divided on this question, with the majority applying the
immediate custodian rule and holding that the Attorney General is not a
proper respondent. Compare Robledo-Gonzales v. Ashcroft, 342 F. 3d 667

If the Wales immediate custodian rule applies in this case,Commander Marr--the equivalent of the warden at the military brig--is the proper respondent, not Secretary Rums-feld. See Al-Marri v. Rumsfeld, 360 F. 3d 707, 708-709
(CA7 2004) (holding in the case of an alleged enemy combat-ant detained at the Consolidated Naval Brig, the proper
respondent is Commander Marr, not Secretary Rumsfeld);
Monk v. Secretary of the Navy, 793 F. 2d 364, 369 (CADC1986) (holding that the proper respondent in a habeas action

U. S. C. $ 951(c) (providing that the commanding officer of amilitary correctional facility "shall have custody and control"
of the prisoners confined therein). Neither Padilla, nor thecourts below, nor

Justice Stevens' dissent deny the gen-eral applicability of the immediate custodian rule to habeas

petitions challenging physical custody. Post, at 458. Theyargue instead that the rule is flexible and should not apply
on the "unique facts" of this case. Brief for Respondents 44.We disagree.

Opinion of the Court
First, Padilla notes that the substantive holding of
Wales--that a person released on his own recognizance is
not "in custody" for habeas purposes--was disapproved in
Hensley v. Municipal Court, San Jose-Milpitas Judicial
Dist., Santa Clara Cty., 411 U. S. 345, 350, n. 8 (1973), as
part of this Court's expanding definition of "custody" under
the habeas statute.10 Padilla seems to contend, and the dissent agrees, post, at 461-462, that because we no longer require physical detention as a prerequisite to habeas relief,
the immediate custodian rule, too, must no longer bind us,
even in challenges to physical custody. That argument, as
the Seventh Circuit aptly concluded, is a "non sequitur."
Al-Marri, supra, at 711. That our understanding of custody
has broadened to include restraints short of physical confinement does nothing to undermine the rationale or statutory foundation of Wales' immediate custodian rule where
physical custody is at issue. Indeed, as the cases cited
above attest, it has consistently been applied in this core
habeas context within the United States.11

The Court of Appeals' view that we have relaxed the immediate custodian rule in cases involving prisoners detained
for "other than federal criminal violations," and that in such
cases the proper respondent is the person exercising the
"legal reality of control" over the petitioner, suffers from the
same logical flaw. 352 F. 3d, at 705, 707. Certainly the
statute itself makes no such distinction based on the source
of the physical detention. Nor does our case law support a
deviation from the immediate custodian rule here. Rather,

10 For other landmark cases addressing the meaning of "in custody"
under the habeas statute, see Garlotte v. Fordice, 515 U. S. 39 (1995); Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U. S. 234 (1968); Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54 (1968);
Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U. S. 236 (1963).

11 Furthermore, Congress has not substantively amended in more than

130 years the relevant portions of the habeas statute on which Wales
based its immediate custodian rule, despite uniform case law embracing
the Wales rule in challenges to physical custody.

542US2 Unit: $U73 [11-01-06 18:21:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN
438 RUMSFELD v. PADILLA

Opinion of the Court
the cases cited by Padilla stand for the simple propositionthat the immediate physical custodian rule, by its terms,

does not apply when a habeas petitioner challenges some-thing other than his present physical confinement.

In Braden, for example, an Alabama prisoner filed a ha-beas petition in the Western District of Kentucky. He did
not contest the validity of the Alabama conviction for which
he was confined, but instead challenged a detainer lodgedagainst him in Kentucky state court. Noting that petitioner

sought to challenge a "confinement that would be imposedin the future," we held that petitioner was "in custody" in
Kentucky by virtue of the detainer. 410 U. S., at 488-489.
In these circumstances, the Court held that the proper respondent was not the prisoner's immediate physical custodian (the Alabama warden), but was instead the Kentucky
court in which the detainer was lodged. This made sense
because the Alabama warden was not "the person who [held]
him in what [was] alleged to be unlawful custody." Id., at
494-495 (citing Wales, 114 U. S., at 574); Hensley, supra, at
351, n. 9 (observing that the petitioner in Braden "was in the
custody of Kentucky officials for purposes of his habeas corpus action"). Under Braden, then, a habeas petitioner who
challenges a form of "custody" other than present physical
confinement may name as respondent the entity or person
who exercises legal control with respect to the challenged
"custody." But nothing in Braden supports departing from
the immediate custodian rule in the traditional context of
challenges to present physical confinement. See Al-Marri,
supra, at 711-712; Monk, supra, at 369. To the contrary,
Braden cited Wales favorably and reiterated the traditional
rule that a prisoner seeking release from confinement must
sue his "jailer." 410 U. S., at 495 (internal quotation marks
omitted).

For the same reason, Strait v. Laird, 406 U. S. 341 (1972),
does not aid Padilla. Strait involved an inactive reservist
domiciled in California who filed a $ 2241 petition seeking

542US2 Unit: $U73 [11-01-06 18:21:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
relief from his military obligations. We noted that the reservist's "nominal" custodian was a commanding officer in
Indiana who had charge of petitioner's Army records. Id.,
at 344. As in Braden, the immediate custodian rule had no
application because petitioner was not challenging any present physical confinement.

In Braden and Strait, the immediate custodian rule did not
apply because there was no immediate physical custodian
with respect to the "custody" being challenged. That is not
the case here: Commander Marr exercises day-to-day control
over Padilla's physical custody. We have never intimated
that a habeas petitioner could name someone other than his
immediate physical custodian as respondent simply because
the challenged physical custody does not arise out of a criminal conviction. Nor can we do so here just because Padilla's
physical confinement stems from a military order by the
President.

It follows that neither Braden nor Strait supports the
Court of Appeals' conclusion that Secretary Rumsfeld is the
proper respondent because he exercises the "legal reality of
control" over Padilla.12 As we have explained, identification
of the party exercising legal control only comes into play
when there is no immediate physical custodian with respect
to the challenged "custody." In challenges to present physical confinement, we reaffirm that the immediate custodian,
not a supervisory official who exercises legal control, is
the proper respondent. If the "legal control" test applied
to physical-custody challenges, a convicted prisoner would
be able to name the State or the Attorney General as a respondent to a $ 2241 petition. As the statutory language,

established practice, and our precedent demonstrate, that isnot the case.

At first blush Ex parte Endo, 323 U. S. 283 (1944), mightseem to lend support to Padilla's "legal control" argument.

There, a Japanese-American citizen interned in California bythe War Relocation Authority (WRA) sought relief by filing
a $ 2241 petition in the Northern District of California, nam-ing as a respondent her immediate custodian. After she
filed the petition, however, the Government moved her toUtah. Thus, the prisoner's immediate physical custodian
was no longer within the jurisdiction of the District Court.We held, nonetheless, that the Northern District "acquired
jurisdiction in this case and that [Endo's] removal . . . did notcause it to lose jurisdiction where a person in whose custody
she is remains within the district." Id., at 306. We held
that, under these circumstances, the assistant director of theWRA, who resided in the Northern District, would be an

"appropriate respondent" to whom the District Court could
direct the writ. Id., at 304-305.While

Endo did involve a petitioner challenging her present physical confinement, it did not, as Padilla and Justice
Stevens contend, hold that such a petitioner may properly
name as respondent someone other than the immediate phys-ical custodian.

Post, at 461-462 (citing Endo as supporting
a "more functional approach" that allows habeas petitioners

13 Even less persuasive is the Court of Appeals' and the dissent's belief
that Secretary Rumsfeld's "unique" and "pervasive" personal involvement
in authorizing Padilla's detention justifies naming him as the respondent.
352 F. 3d, at 707-708 (noting that the Secretary "was charged by the President in the June 9 Order with detaining Padilla" and that the Secretary
"determined that Padilla would be sent to the brig in South Carolina");
post, at 462. If personal involvement were the standard, "then the prosecutor, the trial judge, or the governor would be named as respondents" in
criminal habeas cases. Al-Marri v. Rumsfeld, 360 F. 3d 707, 711 (CA7
2004). As the Seventh Circuit correctly held, the proper respondent is
the person responsible for maintaining--not authorizing--the custody of
the prisoner. Ibid.

Opinion of the Court
to name as respondent an individual with "control" over thepetitioner). Rather, the Court's holding that the writ could

be directed to a supervisory official came not in our holdingthat the District Court initially acquired jurisdiction--it did
so because Endo properly named her immediate custodianand filed in the district of confinement--but in our holding
that the District Court could effectively grant habeas reliefdespite the Government-procured absence of petitioner from
the Northern District.14 Thus, Endo stands for the impor-tant but limited proposition that when the Government
moves a habeas petitioner after she properly files a petitionnaming her immediate custodian, the District Court retains
jurisdiction and may direct the writ to any respondentwithin its jurisdiction who has legal authority to effectuate
the prisoner's release.

Endo's holding does not help respondents here. Padillawas moved from New York to South Carolina before his lawyer filed a habeas petition on his behalf. Unlike the DistrictCourt in

Endo, therefore, the Southern District never ac-quired jurisdiction over Padilla's petition.

Padilla's argument reduces to a request for a new excep-tion to the immediate custodian rule based upon the "unique
facts" of this case. While Padilla's detention is undeniablyunique in many respects, it is at bottom a simple challenge
to physical custody imposed by the Executive--the tradi-tional core of the Great Writ. There is no indication that
there was any attempt to manipulate behind Padilla's trans-fer--he was taken to the same facility where other al Qaeda
members were already being held, and the Government didnot attempt to hide from Padilla's lawyer where it had taken
him. Infra, at 449-450, and n. 17; post, at 454 (Kennedy,

impaired or defeated by the removal of the prisoner from the territorial
jurisdiction of the District Court. That end may be served and the decree
of the court made effective if a respondent who has custody of the [petitioner] is within reach of the court's process." 323 U. S., at 307.

Opinion of the Court
J., concurring). His detention is thus not unique in any waythat would provide arguable basis for a departure from the

immediate custodian rule. Accordingly, we hold that Com-mander Marr, not Secretary Rumsfeld, is Padilla's custodian
and the proper respondent to his habeas petition.

II
We turn now to the second subquestion. District courtsare limited to granting habeas relief "within their respective

jurisdictions." 28 U. S. C. $ 2241(a). We have interpretedthis language to require "nothing more than that the court
issuing the writ have jurisdiction over the custodian." Bra-den, 410 U. S., at 495. Thus, jurisdiction over Padilla's habeas petition lies in the Southern District only if it has ju-risdiction over Commander Marr. We conclude it does not.

Congress added the limiting clause--"within their respec-tive jurisdictions"--to the habeas statute in 1867 to avert
the "inconvenient [and] potentially embarrassing" possibilitythat "every judge anywhere [could] issue the Great Writ on
behalf of applicants far distantly removed from the courtswhereon they sat." Carbo v. United States, 364 U. S. 611,
617 (1961). Accordingly, with respect to habeas petitions"designed to relieve an individual from oppressive confinement," the traditional rule has always been that the GreatWrit is "issuable only in the district of confinement."

Id.,at 618.

Other portions of the habeas statute support this common-sense reading of $ 2241(a). For example, if a petitioner
seeks habeas relief in the court of appeals, or from this Courtor a Justice thereof, the petition must "state the reasons for
not making application to the district court of the district inwhich the applicant is held." 28 U. S. C. $ 2242 (emphases
added). Moreover, the court of appeals, this Court, or a Jus-tice thereof "may decline to entertain an application for a
writ of habeas corpus and may transfer the application . . .to

the district court having jurisdiction to entertain it."

Opinion of the Court

$ 2241(b) (emphasis added). The Federal Rules similarly
provide that an "application for a writ of habeas corpus must
be made to the appropriate district court." Fed. Rule App.
Proc. 22(a) (emphasis added).

Congress has also legislated against the background of the
"district of confinement" rule by fashioning explicit exceptions to the rule in certain circumstances. For instance,

$ 2241(d) provides that when a petitioner is serving a state
criminal sentence in a State that contains more than one federal district, he may file a habeas petition not only "in the
district court for the district wherein [he] is in custody," but
also "in the district court for the district within which the
State court was held which convicted and sentenced him";
and "each of such district courts shall have concurrent jurisdiction to entertain the application." Similarly, until Congress directed federal criminal prisoners to file certain postconviction petitions in the sentencing courts by adding $ 2255
to the habeas statute, federal prisoners could litigate such
collateral attacks only in the district of confinement. See
United States v. Hayman, 342 U. S. 205, 212-219 (1952).
Both of these provisions would have been unnecessary if,
as the Court of Appeals believed, $ 2241's general habeas
provisions permit a prisoner to file outside the district of
confinement.

The plain language of the habeas statute thus confirms the
general rule that for core habeas petitions challenging present physical confinement, jurisdiction lies in only one district:
the district of confinement. Despite this ample statutory
and historical pedigree, Padilla contends, and the Court of
Appeals held, that the district of confinement rule no longer
applies to core habeas challenges. Rather, Padilla, as well
as today's dissenters, post, at 462-464, urge that our decisions in Braden and Strait stand for the proposition that jurisdiction will lie in any district in which the respondent is
amenable to service of process. We disagree.

444 RUMSFELD v. PADILLA

Opinion of the Court
Prior to Braden, we had held that habeas jurisdiction de-pended on the presence of both the petitioner and his custodian within the territorial confines of the district court. See
Ahrens v. Clark, 335 U. S. 188, 190-192 (1948). By allowing
an Alabama prisoner to challenge a Kentucky detainer in theWestern District of Kentucky,

Braden changed course and
held that habeas jurisdiction requires only "that the court
issuing the writ have jurisdiction over the custodian." 410U. S., at 495.

But we fail to see how Braden's requirement of jurisdictionover the respondent alters the district of confinement rule
for challenges to present physical custody. Braden itself did
not involve such a challenge; rather, Braden challenged his
future confinement in Kentucky by suing his Kentucky custodian. We reasoned that "[u]nder these circumstances it
would serve no useful purpose to apply the Ahrens rule and
require that the action be brought in Alabama." Id., at 499.
In habeas challenges to present physical confinement, by contrast, the district of confinement is synonymous with the
district court that has territorial jurisdiction over the proper
respondent. This is because, as we have held, the immediate custodian rule applies to core habeas challenges to present physical custody. By definition, the immediate custodian and the prisoner reside in the same district.

Rather than focusing on the holding and historical context
of Braden, Justice Stevens, post, at 462, like the Court of
Appeals, seizes on dicta in which we referred to "service of
process" to contend that the Southern District could assert
jurisdiction over Secretary Rumsfeld under New York's
long-arm statute. See Braden, 410 U. S., at 495 ("So long as
the custodian can be reached by service of process, the court
can issue a writ `within its jurisdiction' . . . even if the prisoner himself is confined outside the court's territorial jurisdiction"). But that dicta did not indicate that a custodian
may be served with process outside of the district court's
territorial jurisdiction. To the contrary, the facts and hold542US2 Unit: $U73 [11-01-06 18:21:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

445Cite as: 542 U. S. 426 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
ing of Braden dictate the opposite inference. Braden servedhis Kentucky custodian in Kentucky. Accordingly, we concluded that the Western District of Kentucky had jurisdic-tion over the petition "since the respondent was properly
served in that district." Id., at 500 (emphasis added); seealso

Endo, 323 U. S., at 304-305 (noting that the court could
issue the writ to a WRA official "whose office is at San Francisco, which is in the jurisdiction of the [Northern District ofCalifornia]"). Thus,

Braden in no way authorizes district
courts to employ long-arm statutes to gain jurisdiction overcustodians who are outside of their territorial jurisdiction.

See Al-Marri, 360 F. 3d, at 711; Guerra, 786 F. 2d, at
417. Indeed, in stating its holding, Braden favorably cites
Schlanger v. Seamans, 401 U. S. 487 (1971), a case squarely
holding that the custodian's absence from the territorial jurisdiction of the district court is fatal to habeas jurisdiction.
410 U. S., at 500. Thus, Braden does not derogate from the
traditional district of confinement rule for core habeas petitions challenging present physical custody.

The Court of Appeals also thought Strait supported its
long-arm approach to habeas jurisdiction. But Strait offers
even less help than Braden. In Strait, we held that the
Northern District of California had jurisdiction over Strait's
"nominal" custodian--the commanding officer of the Army
records center--even though he was physically located in Indiana. We reasoned that the custodian was "present" in
California "through the officers in the hierarchy of the command who processed [Strait's] application for discharge."
406 U. S., at 345. The Strait Court contrasted its broad
view of "presence" in the case of a nominal custodian with a
" `commanding officer who is responsible for the day to day
control of his subordinates,' " who would be subject to habeas
jurisdiction only in the district where he physically resides.
Ibid. (quoting Arlen v. Laird, 451 F. 2d 684, 687 (CA2 1971)).

The Court of Appeals, much like Justice Stevens' dissent, reasoned that Secretary Rumsfeld, in the same way as

542US2 Unit: $U73 [11-01-06 18:21:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN
446 RUMSFELD v. PADILLA

Opinion of the Court
Strait's commanding officer, was "present" in the SouthernDistrict through his subordinates who took Padilla into military custody. 352 F. 3d, at 709-710; post, at 462. Wethink not.

Strait simply has no application to the present case.Strait predated Braden, so the then-applicable Ahrens rule
required that both the petitioner and his custodian be pres-ent in California. Thus, the only question was whether
Strait's commanding officer was present in California not-withstanding his physical absence from the district. Distinguishing Schlanger, supra, we held that it would "exalt fic-tion over reality" to require Strait to sue his "nominal
custodian" in Indiana when Strait had always resided in Cali-fornia and had his only meaningful contacts with the Army
there. 406 U. S., at 344-346. Only under these limited cir-cumstances did we invoke concepts of personal jurisdiction
to hold that the custodian was "present" in Californiathrough the actions of his agents.

Id., at 345.Here, by contrast, Padilla seeks to challenge his present physical custody in South Carolina. Because the im-mediate custodian rule applies to such habeas challenges,
the proper respondent is Commander Marr, who is also pres-ent in South Carolina. There is thus no occasion to designate a "nominal" custodian and determine whether he or sheis "present" in the same district as petitioner.

15 Under Braden and the district of confinement rule, as we have ex-plained, Padilla must file his habeas action in South Carolina.

Were we to extend Strait's limited exception to the territo-rial nature of habeas jurisdiction to the context of physicalcustody challenges, we would undermine, if not negate, thepurpose of Congress in amending the habeas statute in 1867.

The proviso that district courts may issue the writ only"within their respective jurisdictions" forms an important

15 In other words, Commander Marr is the equivalent of the "commanding officer [with] day to day control" that we distinguished in Strait. 406

Opinion of the Court
corollary to the immediate custodian rule in challenges topresent physical custody under $ 2241. Together they compose a simple rule that has been consistently applied in thelower courts, including in the context of military detentions:
Whenever a $ 2241 habeas petitioner seeks to challenge hispresent physical custody within the United States, he should
name his warden as respondent and file the petition in thedistrict of confinement. See

Al-Marri, supra, at 710, 712(alleged enemy combatant detained at Consolidated Naval

Brig must file petition in the District of South Carolina; col-lecting cases dismissing $ 2241 petitions filed outside the district of confinement); Monk, 793 F. 2d, at 369 (court-martialconvict must file in district of confinement).

16

This rule, derived from the terms of the habeas statute,serves the important purpose of preventing forum shopping

by habeas petitioners. Without it, a prisoner could name ahigh-level supervisory official as respondent and then sue
that person wherever he is amenable to long-arm jurisdic-tion. The result would be rampant forum shopping, district
courts with overlapping jurisdiction, and the very inconven-ience, expense, and embarrassment Congress sought to avoid
when it added the jurisdictional limitation 137 years ago.

III
Justice Stevens' dissent, not unlike the Court of Ap-peals' decision, rests on the mistaken belief that we have

custodian rule, n. 8, supra, we have similarly relaxed the district of confinement rule when "American citizens confined overseas (and thus outside
the territory of any district court) have sought relief in habeas corpus."

the petitioner to name as respondent a supervisory official and file the

made various exceptions to the immediate custodian and dis-trict of confinement rules whenever "exceptional," " `special,' " or "unusual" cases have arisen. Post, at 455, 458, 462,n. 5. We have addressed most of his contentions in the foregoing discussion, but we briefly touch on a few additionalpoints.

Apparently drawing a loose analogy to Endo, Justice
Stevens asks us to pretend that Padilla and his immediatecustodian were present in the Southern District at the time

counsel filed the instant habeas petition, thus rendering ju-risdiction proper.

Post, at 458-459. The dissent asserts
that the Government "depart[ed] from the time-honored
practice of giving one's adversary fair notice of an intent to
present an important motion to the court," when on June 9
it moved ex parte to vacate the material witness warrant and
allegedly failed to immediately inform counsel of its intent to
transfer Padilla to military custody in South Carolina. Post,
at 459; cf. n. 3, supra. Constructing a hypothetical "scenario," the dissent contends that if counsel had been immediately informed, she "would have filed the habeas application
then and there," while Padilla remained in the Southern District, "rather than waiting two days." Post, at 458. Therefore, Justice Stevens concludes, the Government's alleged
misconduct "justifies treating the habeas application as the
functional equivalent of one filed two days earlier." Post,
at 459 ("[W]e should not permit the Government to obtain a tactical advantage as a consequence of an ex parte
proceeding").

The dissent cites no authority whatsoever for its extraordinary proposition that a district court can exercise statutory
jurisdiction based on a series of events that did not occur, or
that jurisdiction might be premised on "punishing" alleged
Government misconduct. The lower courts--unlike the dissent--did not perceive any hint of Government misconduct
or bad faith that would warrant extending Endo to a case
where both the petitioner and his immediate custodian were

Opinion of the Court
outside of the district at the time of filing. Not surprisingly,then, neither Padilla nor the lower courts relied on the dissent's counterfactual theory to argue that habeas jurisdictionwas proper. Finding it contrary to our well-established
precedent, we are not persuaded either.17The dissent contends that even if we do not indulge its
hypothetical scenario, the Court has made "numerous exceptions" to the immediate custodian and district of confinementrules, rendering our bright-line rule "far from bright."

Post, at 460. Yet the dissent cannot cite a single case inwhich we have deviated from the longstanding rule we reaffirm today--that is, a case in which we allowed a habeaspetitioner challenging his present physical custody within
the United States to name as respondent someone other than

17 On a related note, the dissent argues that the facts as they actually
existed at the time of filing should not matter, because "what matters for
present purposes are the facts available to [counsel] at the time of filing."
Post, at 459, n. 3. According to the dissent, because the Government
"shrouded . . . in secrecy" the location of Padilla's military custody, counsel
was entitled to file in the district where Padilla's presence was "last officially confirmed." Ibid. As with the argument addressed above, neither
Padilla nor the District Court--which was much closer to the facts of
the case than we are--or the Court of Appeals ever suggested that the
Government concealed Padilla's whereabouts from counsel, much less contended that such concealment was the basis for habeas jurisdiction in the
Southern District. And even if this were a valid legal argument, the record simply does not support the dissent's inference of Government secrecy.
The dissent relies solely on a letter written by Padilla's counsel. In that
same letter, however, counsel states that she "was informed [on June 10]"
that her client had been taken into custody by the Department of Defense
and "detain[ed] at a naval military prison." App. 66. When counsel filed
Padilla's habeas petition on June 11, she averred that "Padilla is being held
in segregation at the high-security Consolidated Naval Brig in Charleston,
South Carolina." Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus in No. 02 Civ. 4445
(SDNY), p. 2, Record, Doc. 1. The only reasonable inference, particularly
in light of Padilla's failure to argue to the contrary, is that counsel was
well aware of Padilla's presence in South Carolina when she filed the habeas petition, not that the Government "shrouded" Padilla's whereabouts
in secrecy.

18 If Justice Stevens' view

were accepted, district courts would be consigned to makingad hoc determinations as to whether the circumstances of a

given case are "exceptional," "special," or "unusual" enoughto require departure from the jurisdictional rules this Court
has consistently applied. We do not think Congress in-tended such a result.

Finally, the dissent urges us to bend the jurisdictionalrules because the merits of this case are indisputably of "profound importance," post, at 455, 460-461. But it is surely

18 Instead, Justice Stevens, like the Court of Appeals, relies heavily
on Braden, Strait, and other cases involving challenges to something other
than present physical custody. Post, at 461-464, and n. 4; post, at 461, n. 4
(citing Garlotte v. Fordice, 515 U. S. 39 (1995) (habeas petitioner challenging expired sentence named Governor as respondent; immediate custodian
issue not addressed); Middendorf v. Henry, 425 U. S. 25 (1976) (putative
habeas class action challenging court-martial procedures throughout the
military; immediate custodian issue not addressed)); post, at 463 (citing
Eisel v. Secretary of the Army, 477 F. 2d 1251 (CADC 1973) (allowing an
inactive reservist challenging his military status to name the Secretary of
the Army as respondent)). Demjanjuk v. Meese, 784 F. 2d 1114 (CADC
1986), on which the dissent relies, post, at 458, is similarly unhelpful:
When, as in that case, a prisoner is held in an undisclosed location by an
unknown custodian, it is impossible to apply the immediate custodian and
district of confinement rules. That is not the case here, where the identity of the immediate custodian and the location of the appropriate district
court are clear.

The dissent also cites two cases in which a state prisoner proceeding
under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 named as respondent the State's officer in charge
of penal institutions. Post, at 461, n. 4 (citing California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales, 514 U. S. 499 (1995); Wainwright v. Greenfield, 474 U. S.
284 (1986)). But such cases do not support Padilla's cause. First of all,
the respondents did not challenge their designation as inconsistent with
the immediate custodian rule. More to the point, Congress has authorized $ 2254 petitioners challenging present physical custody to name either
the warden or the chief state penal officer as a respondent. Rule 2(a) of
the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in the United States District
Courts; Advisory Committee's Note on Rule 2(a), 28 U. S. C., pp. 469-470
(adopted in 1976). Congress has made no such provision for $ 2241 petitioners like Padilla.

just as necessary in important cases as in unimportant ones
that courts take care not to exceed their "respective jurisdictions" established by Congress.

The District of South Carolina, not the Southern District
of New York, was the district court in which Padilla should
have brought his habeas petition. We therefore reverse the
judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for
entry of an order of dismissal without prejudice.

It is so ordered.

Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice O'Connor joins,
concurring.

Though I join the opinion of the Court, this separate opinion is added to state my understanding of how the statute
should be interpreted in light of the Court's holding. The
Court's analysis relies on two rules. First, the habeas action must be brought against the immediate custodian. Second, when an action is brought in the district court, it must
be filed in the district court whose territorial jurisdiction
includes the place where the custodian is located.

These rules, however, are not jurisdictional in the sense
of a limitation on subject-matter jurisdiction. Ante, at 434,
n. 7. That much is clear from the many cases in which petitions have been heard on the merits despite their noncompliance with either one or both of the rules. See, e. g., Braden
v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky., 410 U. S. 484, 495
(1973); Strait v. Laird, 406 U. S. 341, 345 (1972); United
States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S. 11 (1955); Burns v.
Wilson, 346 U. S. 137 (1953); Ex parte Endo, 323 U. S. 283
(1944).

In my view, the question of the proper location for a habeas petition is best understood as a question of personal
jurisdiction or venue. This view is more in keeping with
the opinion in Braden, and its discussion explaining the rules
for the proper forum for habeas petitions. 410 U. S., at 493,

Moore v. Olson, 368 F. 3d 757, 759-760 (CA7 2004)
(suggesting that the territorial-jurisdiction rule is a venuerule, and the immediate-custodian rule is a personaljurisdiction rule). This approach is consistent with the ref-erence in the statute to the "respective jurisdictions" of the
district court. 28 U. S. C. $ 2241. As we have noted twice
this Term, the word "jurisdiction" is susceptible of differentmeanings, not all of which refer to the power of a federal

court to hear a certain class of cases. Kontrick v. Ryan, 540U. S. 443 (2004);

Scarborough v. Principi, 541 U. S. 401
(2004). The phrase "respective jurisdictions" does establish
a territorial restriction on the proper forum for habeas petitions, but does not of necessity establish that the limitation
goes to the power of the court to hear the case.

Because the immediate-custodian and territorialjurisdiction rules are like personal-jurisdiction or venue
rules, objections to the filing of petitions based on those
grounds can be waived by the Government. Moore, supra,
at 759; cf. Endo, supra, at 305 ("The fact that no respondent

is not important. The United States resists the issuance of
a writ. A cause exists in that state of the proceedings and
an appeal lies from denial of a writ without the appearance
of a respondent"). For the same reason, the immediatecustodian and territorial rules are subject to exceptions, as
acknowledged in the Court's opinion. Ante, at 436, n. 9,
438-442, 444-446. This does not mean that habeas petitions
are governed by venue rules and venue considerations that
apply to other sorts of civil lawsuits. Although habeas actions are civil cases, they are not automatically subject to all
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Fed. Rule Civ.
Proc. 81(a)(2) ("These rules are applicable to proceedings
for . . . habeas corpus . . . to the extent that the practice in
such proceedings is not set forth in statutes of the United
States, the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases, or the

Kennedy, J., concurring
Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings"). Instead,these forum-location rules for habeas petitions are based on

the habeas statutes and the cases interpreting them. Fur-thermore, the fact that these habeas rules are subject to exceptions does not mean that, in the exceptional case, a peti-tion may be properly filed in any one of the federal district
courts. When an exception applies, see, e. g., Rasul v. Bush,
post, p. 466, courts must still take into account the considera-tions that in the ordinary case are served by the immediatecustodian rule, and, in a similar fashion, limit the availableforum to the one with the most immediate connection to the
named custodian.

I would not decide today whether these habeas rules function more like rules of personal jurisdiction or rules of venue.
It is difficult to describe the precise nature of these restrictions on the filing of habeas petitions, as an examination of
the Court's own opinions in this area makes clear. Compare,
e. g., Ahrens v. Clark, 335 U. S. 188 (1948), with Schlanger v.
Seamans, 401 U. S. 487, 491 (1971), and Braden, supra, at
495. The precise question of how best to characterize the
statutory direction respecting where the action must be filed
need not be resolved with finality in this case. Here there
has been no waiver by the Government; there is no established exception to the immediate-custodian rule or to the
rule that the action must be brought in the district court
with authority over the territory in question; and there is no
need to consider some further exception to protect the integrity of the writ or the rights of the person detained.

For the purposes of this case, it is enough to note that,
even under the most permissive interpretation of the habeas
statute as a venue provision, the Southern District of New
York was not the proper place for this petition. As the
Court concludes, in the ordinary case of a single physical
custody within the borders of the United States, where the
objection has not been waived by the Government, the
immediate-custodian and territorial-jurisdiction rules must

apply. Ante, at 451. I also agree with the arguments from
statutory text and case law that the Court marshals in support of these two rules. Ante, at 434-435, 442-443. Only
in an exceptional case may a court deviate from those basic
rules to hear a habeas petition filed against some person
other than the immediate custodian of the prisoner, or in
some court other than the one in whose territory the custodian may be found.

The Court has made exceptions in the cases of nonphysical
custody, see, e. g., Strait, 406 U. S., at 345, of dual custody,
see, e. g., Braden, 410 U. S., at 500, and of removal of the
prisoner from the territory of a district after a petition has
been filed, see, e. g., Endo, 323 U. S., at 306; see also ante, at
440-441, 444. In addition, I would acknowledge an exception if there is an indication that the Government's purpose
in removing a prisoner were to make it difficult for his lawyer to know where the habeas petition should be filed, or
where the Government was not forthcoming with respect to
the identity of the custodian and the place of detention. In
cases of that sort, habeas jurisdiction would be in the district
court from whose territory the petitioner had been removed.
In this case, if the Government had removed Padilla from
the Southern District of New York but refused to tell his
lawyer where he had been taken, the District Court would
have had jurisdiction over the petition. Or, if the Government did inform the lawyer where a prisoner was being
taken but kept moving him so a filing could not catch up to
the prisoner, again, in my view, habeas jurisdiction would lie
in the district or districts from which he had been removed.

None of the exceptions apply here. There is no indication
that the Government refused to tell Padilla's lawyer where
he had been taken. The original petition demonstrates that
the lawyer knew where Padilla was being held at that time.
Ante, at 449, n. 17. In these circumstances, the basic rules
apply, and the District of South Carolina was the proper

forum. The present case demonstrates the wisdom of thoserules.

Both Padilla's change in location and his change of custo-dian reflected a change in the Government's rationale for detaining him. He ceased to be held under the authority ofthe criminal justice system, see 18 U. S. C. $ 3144, and began
to be held under that of the military detention system.
Rather than being designed to play games with forums, theGovernment's removal of Padilla reflected the change in the

theory on which it was holding him. Whether that theoryis a permissible one, of course, is a question the Court does
not reach today.The change in custody, and the underlying change in rationale, should be challenged in the place the Government
has brought them to bear and against the person who is the
immediate representative of the military authority that is
detaining him. That place is the District of South Carolina,
and that person is Commander Marr. The Second Circuit
erred in holding that the Southern District of New York was
a proper forum for Padilla's petition. With these further observations, I join the opinion and judgment of the Court.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

The petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed in this case
raises questions of profound importance to the Nation. The
arguments set forth by the Court do not justify avoidance of
our duty to answer those questions. It is quite wrong to
characterize the proceeding as a "simple challenge to physical custody," ante, at 441, that should be resolved by slavish
application of a "bright-line rule," ante, at 449, designed to
prevent "rampant forum shopping" by litigious prison inmates, ante, at 447. As the Court's opinion itself demonstrates, that rule is riddled with exceptions fashioned to protect the high office of the Great Writ. This is an exceptional
case that we clearly have jurisdiction to decide.

456 RUMSFELD v. PADILLA

Stevens, J., dissenting

I
In May 2002, a grand jury convened in the Southern District of New York was conducting an investigation into theSeptember 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In response to an application by the Department of Justice, the Chief Judge ofthe District issued a material witness warrant authorizing
Padilla's arrest when his plane landed in Chicago on May8.

1 Pursuant to that warrant, agents of the Department of

Justice took Padilla (hereinafter respondent) into custodyand transported him to New York City, where he was detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. On May 15,
the court appointed Donna R. Newman, a member of the
New York bar, to represent him. She conferred with respondent in person and filed motions on his behalf, seeking
his release on the ground that his incarceration was unauthorized and unconstitutional. The District Court scheduled a hearing on those motions for Tuesday, June 11, 2002.

On Sunday, June 9, 2002, before that hearing could occur,
the President issued a written command to the Secretary of
Defense concerning respondent. "Based on the information
available to [him] from all sources," the President determined that respondent is an "enemy combatant," that he is
"closely associated with al Qaeda, an international terrorist
organization with which the United States is at war," and
that he possesses intelligence that, "if communicated to the
U. S., would aid U. S. efforts to prevent attacks by al Qaeda"

1 As its authority for detaining respondent as a material witness, the
Government relied on a federal statute that provides: "If it appears from
an affidavit filed by a party that the testimony of a person is material in
a criminal proceeding, and if it is shown that it may become impracticable
to secure the presence of the person by subpoena, a judicial officer may
order the arrest of the person and treat the person in accordance with the
provisions of section 3142 . . . . Release of a material witness may be
delayed for a reasonable period of time until the deposition of the witness
can be taken pursuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure." 18
U. S. C. $ 3144.

on U. S. targets. App. A to Pet. for Cert. 57a. The com-mand stated that "it is in the interest of the United States"

and "consistent with U. S. law and the laws of war for theSecretary of Defense to detain Mr. Padilla as an enemy combatant." Id., at 58a. The President's order concluded: "Ac-cordingly, you are directed to receive Mr. Padilla from the
Department of Justice and to detain him as an enemy com-batant."

Ibid.On the same Sunday that the President issued his order,

the Government notified the District Court in an ex parteproceeding that it was withdrawing its grand jury subpoena,
and it asked the court to enter an order vacating the materialwitness warrant. Padilla ex rel. Newman v. Bush, 233
F. Supp. 2d 564, 571 (SDNY 2002). In that proceeding, inwhich respondent was not represented, the Government informed the court that the President had designated respond-ent an enemy combatant and had directed the Secretary of
Defense, petitioner Donald Rumsfeld, to detain respondent.
Ibid. The Government also disclosed that the Departmentof Defense would take custody of respondent and immediately transfer him to South Carolina. The District Courtcomplied with the Government's request and vacated the
warrant.2On Monday, June 10, 2002, the Attorney General publicly
announced respondent's detention and transfer "to the cus-tody of the Defense Department," which he called "a significant step forward in the War on Terrorism." Amended Pet.

2 The order vacating the material witness warrant that the District
Court entered in the ex parte proceeding on June 9 terminated the Government's lawful custody of respondent. After that order was entered,
Secretary Rumsfeld's agents took custody of respondent. The authority
for that action was based entirely on the President's command to the Secretary--a document that, needless to say, would not even arguably qualify
as a valid warrant. Thus, whereas respondent's custody during the period between May 8 and June 9, 2002, was pursuant to a judicially authorized seizure, he has been held ever since--for two years--pursuant to a
warrantless arrest.

response to that announcement, Newman commenced thisproceeding by filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in
the Southern District of New York. 233 F. Supp. 2d, at 571.At a conference on that date, which had been originally
scheduled to address Newman's motion to vacate the mate-rial witness warrant, the Government conceded that Defense
Department personnel had taken custody of respondent inthe Southern District of New York.

Id., at 571-572.

All Members of this Court agree that the immediate custo-dian rule should control in the ordinary case and that habeas

petitioners should not be permitted to engage in forum shop-ping. But we also all agree with Judge Bork that "special
circumstances" can justify exceptions from the general rule.

of the Secretary of Defense. Surely at that time SecretaryRumsfeld, rather than the lesser official who placed the handcuffs on petitioner, would have been the proper person toname as a respondent to that petition.

The difference between that scenario and the secret trans-fer that actually occurred should not affect our decision, for
we should not permit the Government to obtain a tacticaladvantage as a consequence of an

ex parte proceeding. Thedeparture from the time-honored practice of giving one's adversary fair notice of an intent to present an important mo-tion to the court justifies treating the habeas application as
the functional equivalent of one filed two days earlier. SeeBaldwin v. Hale, 1 Wall. 223, 233 (1864) ("Common justice

Counsel of the Department of Defense, June 17, 2002 ("I understand from

while it is true, as the Court observes, that "Padilla was moved from New
York to South Carolina before his lawyer filed a habeas petition on his
behalf," ante, at 441, what matters for present purposes are the facts available to Newman at the time of filing. When the Government shrouded
those facts in secrecy, Newman had no option but to file immediately in
the district where respondent's presence was last officially confirmed.

Moreover, Newman was appointed to represent respondent by the District Court for the Southern District of New York. Once the Government
removed her client, it did not permit her to counsel him until February
11, 2004. Consultation thereafter has been allowed as a matter of the
Government's grace, not as a matter of right stemming from the Southern
District of New York appointment. Further, it is not apparent why the
District of South Carolina, rather than the Southern District of New York,
should be regarded as the proper forum to determine the validity of the
"change in the Government's rationale for detaining" respondent. Ante,
at 455. If the Government's theory is not "a permissible one," ibid., then
the New York federal court would remain the proper forum in this case.
Why should the New York court not have the authority to determine the
legitimacy of the Government's removal of respondent beyond that
court's borders?

insure that miscarriages of justice within its reach are sur-faced and corrected."

Harris v. Nelson, 394 U. S. 286, 291
(1969). But even if we treat respondent's habeas petition as
having been filed in the Southern District after the Govern-ment removed him to South Carolina, there is ample precedent for affording special treatment to this exceptional case,both by recognizing Secretary Rumsfeld as the proper respondent and by treating the Southern District as the mostappropriate venue.

Although the Court purports to be enforcing a "bright-linerule" governing district courts' jurisdiction,

ante, at 449, an
examination of its opinion reveals that the line is far frombright. Faced with a series of precedents emphasizing the

writ's "scope and flexibility," Harris, 394 U. S., at 291, theCourt is forced to acknowledge the numerous exceptions we
have made to the immediate custodian rule. The rule does
not apply, the Court admits, when physical custody is not atissue,

ante, at 437-438, or when American citizens are confined overseas, ante, at 447, n. 16, or when the petitioner
has been transferred after filing, ante, at 441, or when the
custodian is " `present' " in the district through his agents'
conduct, ante, at 445. In recognizing exception upon exception and corollaries to corollaries, the Court itself persuasively demonstrates that the rule is not ironclad. It is, instead, a workable general rule that frequently gives way
outside the context of " `core challenges' " to executive confinement. Ante, at 435.

In the Court's view, respondent's detention falls within the
category of " `core challenges' " because it is "not unique in
any way that would provide arguable basis for a departure
from the immediate custodian rule." Ante, at 442. It is,
however, disingenuous at best to classify respondent's petition with run-of-the-mill collateral attacks on federal crimi542US2 Unit: $U73 [11-01-06 18:21:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

fense with control over respondent. To that end, the Secretary deployed Defense Department personnel to the Southern District with instructions to transfer respondent to
South Carolina. Under the President's order, only the Secretary--not a judge, not a prosecutor, not a warden--has had
a say in determining respondent's location. As the District
Court observed, Secretary Rumsfeld has publicly shown
"both his familiarity with the circumstances of Padilla's detention, and his personal involvement in the handling of Padilla's case." 233 F. Supp. 2d, at 574. Having "emphasized
and jealously guarded" the Great Writ's "ability to cut
through barriers of form and procedural mazes," Harris, 394
U. S., at 291, surely we should acknowledge that the writ
reaches the Secretary as the relevant custodian in this case.

Since the Secretary is a proper custodian, the question
whether the petition was appropriately filed in the Southern District is easily answered. "So long as the custodian
can be reached by service of process, the court can issue a
writ `within its jurisdiction' requiring that the prisoner be
brought before the court for a hearing on his claim . . . even if
the prisoner himself is confined outside the court's territorial
jurisdiction." Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky.,
410 U. S. 484, 495 (1973).5 See also Endo, 323 U. S., at 306
("[T]he court may act if there is a respondent within reach
of its process who has custody of the petitioner"). In this
case, Secretary Rumsfeld no doubt has sufficient contacts
with the Southern District properly to be served with process there. The Secretary, after all, ordered military personnel to that forum to seize and remove respondent.

5 Although, as the Court points out, ante, at 445, the custodian in Braden
was served within the territorial jurisdiction of the District Court, the
salient point is that Endo and Braden decoupled the District Court's jurisdiction from the detainee's place of confinement and adopted for unusual
cases a functional analysis that does not depend on the physical location
of any single party.

It bears emphasis that the question of the proper forum todetermine the legality of Padilla's incarceration is not one of

federal subject-matter jurisdiction. See ante, at 434, n. 7;ante, at 451 (

principles, it is evident that the Southern District of NewYork, not South Carolina, is the more appropriate place to
litigate respondent's petition. The Government sought amaterial witness warrant for respondent's detention in the
Southern District, indicating that it would be convenient forits attorneys to litigate in that forum. As a result of the
Government's initial forum selection, the District Judge andcounsel in the Southern District were familiar with the legal
and factual issues surrounding respondent's detention bothbefore and after he was transferred to the Defense Department's custody. Accordingly, fairness and efficiency counselin favor of preserving venue in the Southern District. In
sum, respondent properly filed his petition against SecretaryRumsfeld in the Southern District of New York.

Whether respondent is entitled to immediate release is aquestion that reasonable jurists may answer in different

ways.8 There is, however, only one possible answer to thequestion whether he is entitled to a hearing on the justification for his detention.9

8 Consistent with the judgment of the Court of Appeals, I believe that
the Non-Detention Act, 18 U. S. C. $ 4001(a), prohibits--and the Authorization for Use of Military Force Joint Resolution, 115 Stat. 224, adopted on
September 18, 2001, does not authorize--the protracted, incommunicado
detention of American citizens arrested in the United States.

working with the terrorists. Our interest at the moment is to try and

At stake in this case is nothing less than the essence of afree society. Even more important than the method of selecting the people's rulers and their successors is the charac-ter of the constraints imposed on the Executive by the rule

hallmark of the Star Chamber.10 Access to counsel for thepurpose of protecting the citizen from official mistakes and
mistreatment is the hallmark of due process.Executive detention of subversive citizens, like detention
of enemy soldiers to keep them off the battlefield, may some-times be justified to prevent persons from launching or becoming missiles of destruction. It may not, however, be jus-tified by the naked interest in using unlawful procedures to
extract information. Incommunicado detention for monthson end is such a procedure. Whether the information so

RASUL et al. v. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THEUNITED STATES,

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuit

No. 03-334. Argued April 20, 2004--Decided June 28, 2004*
Pursuant to Congress' joint resolution authorizing the use of necessary

and appropriate force against nations, organizations, or persons that
planned, authorized, committed, or aided in the September 11, 2001, al
Qaeda terrorist attacks, the President sent Armed Forces into Afghanistan to wage a military campaign against al Qaeda and the Taliban regime that had supported it. Petitioners, 2 Australians and 12 Kuwaitis
captured abroad during the hostilities, are being held in military custody
at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Naval Base, which the United States
occupies under a lease and treaty recognizing Cuba's ultimate sovereignty, but giving this country complete jurisdiction and control for so
long as it does not abandon the leased areas. Petitioners filed suits
under federal law challenging the legality of their detention, alleging
that they had never been combatants against the United States or engaged in terrorist acts, and that they have never been charged with
wrongdoing, permitted to consult counsel, or provided access to courts
or other tribunals. The District Court construed the suits as habeas
petitions and dismissed them for want of jurisdiction, holding that,
under Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763, aliens detained outside
United States sovereign territory may not invoke habeas relief. The
Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: United States courts have jurisdiction to consider challenges to the

legality of the detention of foreign nationals captured abroad in connection with hostilities and incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay. Pp. 473-485.

(a) The District Court has jurisdiction to hear petitioners' habeas
challenges under 28 U. S. C. $ 2241, which authorizes district courts,
"within their respective jurisdictions," to entertain habeas applications
by persons claiming to be held "in custody in violation of the . . . laws . . .
of the United States," $$ 2241(a), (c)(3). Such jurisdiction extends to
aliens held in a territory over which the United States exercises plenary
and exclusive jurisdiction, but not "ultimate sovereignty." Pp. 473-484.

(1) The Court rejects respondents' primary submission that these
cases are controlled by Eisentrager's holding that a District Court

*Together with No. 03-343, Al Odah et al. v. United States et al., also
on certiorari to the same court.

lacked authority to grant habeas relief to German citizens captured by
U. S. forces in China, tried and convicted of war crimes by an American
military commission headquartered in Nanking, and incarcerated in occupied Germany. Reversing a Court of Appeals judgment finding jurisdiction, the Eisentrager Court found six critical facts: The German prisoners were (a) enemy aliens who (b) had never been or resided in the
United States, (c) were captured outside U. S. territory and there held
in military custody, (d) were there tried and convicted by the military
(e) for offenses committed there, and (f) were imprisoned there at all
times. 339 U. S., at 777. Petitioners here differ from the Eisentrager
detainees in important respects: They are not nationals of countries at
war with the United States, and they deny that they have engaged in
or plotted acts of aggression against this country; they have never been
afforded access to any tribunal, much less charged with and convicted
of wrongdoing; and for more than two years they have been imprisoned
in territory over which the United States exercises exclusive jurisdiction and control. The Eisentrager Court also made clear that all six of
the noted critical facts were relevant only to the question of the prisoners' constitutional entitlement to habeas review. Ibid. The Court's
only statement on their statutory entitlement was a passing reference
to its absence. Id., at 768. This cursory treatment is explained by the
Court's then-recent decision in Ahrens v. Clark, 335 U. S. 188, in which
it held that the District Court for the District of Columbia lacked jurisdiction to entertain the habeas claims of aliens detained at Ellis Island
because the habeas statute's phrase "within their respective jurisdictions" required the petitioners' presence within the court's territorial
jurisdiction, id., at 192. However, the Court later held, in Braden v.
30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky., 410 U. S. 484, 494-495, that such
presence is not "an invariable prerequisite" to the exercise of $ 2241
jurisdiction because habeas acts upon the person holding the prisoner,
not the prisoner himself, so that the court acts "within [its] respective
jurisdiction" if the custodian can be reached by service of process. Because Braden overruled the statutory predicate to Eisentrager's holding, Eisentrager does not preclude the exercise of $ 2241 jurisdiction
over petitioners' claims. Pp. 475-479.

(2) Also rejected is respondents' contention that $ 2241 is limited
by the principle that legislation is presumed not to have extraterritorial
application unless Congress clearly manifests such an intent, EEOC v.
Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 248. That presumption has
no application to the operation of the habeas statute with respect to
persons detained within "the [United States'] territorial jurisdiction."
Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S. 281, 285. By the express terms
of its agreements with Cuba, the United States exercises complete jurisdiction and control over the Guantanamo Base, and may continue to

do so permanently if it chooses. Respondents concede that the habeas
statute would create federal-court jurisdiction over the claims of an
American citizen held at the base. Considering that $ 2241 draws no
distinction between Americans and aliens held in federal custody, there
is little reason to think that Congress intended the statute's geographical coverage to vary depending on the detainee's citizenship. Aliens
held at the base, like American citizens, are entitled to invoke the federal courts' $ 2241 authority. Pp. 480-482.

(3) Petitioners contend that they are being held in federal custody
in violation of United States laws, and the District Court's jurisdiction
over petitioners' custodians is unquestioned, cf. Braden, 410 U. S., at 495.
Section 2241 requires nothing more and therefore confers jurisdiction on
the District Court. Pp. 483-484.

(b) The District Court also has jurisdiction to hear the Al Odah petitioners' complaint invoking 28 U. S. C. $ 1331, the federal-question statute, and $ 1350, the Alien Tort Statute. The Court of Appeals, again
relying on Eisentrager, held that the District Court correctly dismissed
these claims for want of jurisdiction because the petitioners lacked the
privilege of litigation in U. S. courts. Nothing in Eisentrager or any
other of the Court's cases categorically excludes aliens detained in military custody outside the United States from that privilege. United
States courts have traditionally been open to nonresident aliens.
Cf. Disconto Gesellschaft v. Umbreit, 208 U. S. 570, 578. And indeed,

$ 1350 explicitly confers the privilege of suing for an actionable "tort . . .
committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United
States" on aliens alone. The fact that petitioners are being held in military custody is immaterial. Pp. 484-485.

(c) Whether and what further proceedings may become necessary
after respondents respond to the merits of petitioners' claims are not
here addressed. P. 485.

470 RASUL v. BUSH

Opinion of the Court
Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
These two cases present the narrow but important ques-tion whether United States courts lack jurisdiction to consider challenges to the legality of the detention of foreignnationals captured abroad in connection with hostilities and
incarcerated at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba.

I
On September 11, 2001, agents of the al Qaeda terroristnetwork hijacked four commercial airliners and used them

as missiles to attack American targets. While one of thefour attacks was foiled by the heroism of the plane's passengers, the other three killed approximately 3,000 innocent ci-vilians, destroyed hundreds of millions of dollars of property,
and severely damaged the U. S. economy. In response to theattacks, Congress passed a joint resolution authorizing the
President to use "all necessary and appropriate force againstthose nations, organizations, or persons he determines
planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist at-tacks . . . or harbored such organizations or persons." Authorization for Use of Military Force, Pub. L. 107-40, $$ 1-2,115 Stat. 224. Acting pursuant to that authorization, the
President sent U. S. Armed Forces into Afghanistan to wagea military campaign against al Qaeda and the Taliban regime
that had supported it.Petitioners in these cases are 2 Australian citizens and 12
Kuwaiti citizens who were captured abroad during hostilities

Opinion of the Court
between the United States and the Taliban.1 Since early2002, the U. S. military has held them--along with, according

to the Government's estimate, approximately 640 other non-Americans captured abroad--at the naval base at Guantanamo Bay. Brief for Respondents 6. The United States oc-cupies the base, which comprises 45 square miles of land and
water along the southeast coast of Cuba, pursuant to a 1903Lease Agreement executed with the newly independent Republic of Cuba in the aftermath of the Spanish-AmericanWar. Under the agreement, "the United States recognizes
the continuance of the ultimate sovereignty of the Republicof Cuba over the [leased areas]," while "the Republic of Cuba
consents that during the period of the occupation by theUnited States . . . the United States shall exercise complete
jurisdiction and control over and within said areas." 2 In
1934, the parties entered into a treaty providing that, ab-sent an agreement to modify or abrogate the lease, the

lease would remain in effect "[s]o long as the United States
of America shall not abandon the . . . naval station ofGuantanamo."

In 2002, petitioners, through relatives acting as their nextfriends, filed various actions in the U. S. District Court for

the District of Columbia challenging the legality of their de-tention at the base. All alleged that none of the petitioners
has ever been a combatant against the United States or has

The two Australians, Mamdouh Habib and David Hicks,each filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, seeking release from custody, access to counsel, freedom from interro-gations, and other relief.

Id., at 98-99, 124-126. FawziKhalid Abdullah Fahad Al Odah and the 11 other Kuwaiti

detainees filed a complaint seeking to be informed of thecharges against them, to be allowed to meet with their families and with counsel, and to have access to the courts orsome other impartial tribunal. Id., at 34. They claimed
that denial of these rights violates the Constitution, interna-tional law, and treaties of the United States. Invoking the
court's jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. $$ 1331 and 1350, amongother statutory bases, they asserted causes of action under
the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. $$ 555, 702, 706;
the Alien Tort Statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 1350; and the generalfederal habeas corpus statute, $$ 2241-2243. App. 19.

Construing all three actions as petitions for writs of ha-beas corpus, the District Court dismissed them for want of
jurisdiction. The court held, in reliance on our opinion in
Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763 (1950), that "aliens detained outside the sovereign territory of the United States

by the Northern Alliance, a coalition of Afghan groups opposed to the
Taliban, before he was turned over to the United States. Id., at 84. The

transferred him to U. S. custody. Id., at 110-111.

[may not] invok[e] a petition for a writ of habeas corpus."215 F. Supp. 2d 55, 68 (DC 2002). The Court of Appeals

affirmed. Reading Eisentrager to hold that " `the privilegeof litigation' does not extend to aliens in military custody
who have no presence in `any territory over which theUnited States is sovereign,' " 321 F. 3d 1134, 1144 (CADC
2003) (quoting Eisentrager, 339 U. S., at 777-778), it held thatthe District Court lacked jurisdiction over petitioners' habeas actions, as well as their remaining federal statutoryclaims that do not sound in habeas. We granted certiorari,
540 U. S. 1003 (2003), and now reverse.

II
Congress has granted federal district courts, "within theirrespective jurisdictions," the authority to hear applications

for habeas corpus by any person who claims to be held "incustody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of
the United States." 28 U. S. C. $$ 2241(a), (c)(3). The stat-ute traces its ancestry to the first grant of federal-court jurisdiction: Section 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 authorizedfederal courts to issue the writ of habeas corpus to prisoners
who are "in custody, under or by colour of the authority ofthe United States, or are committed for trial before some
court of the same." Act of Sept. 24, 1789, ch. 20, $ 14, 1 Stat.82. In 1867, Congress extended the protections of the writ
to "all cases where any person may be restrained of his orher liberty in violation of the constitution, or of any treaty
or law of the United States." Act of Feb. 5, 1867, ch. 28, 14Stat. 385. See

Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 659-660(1996).

Habeas corpus is, however, "a writ antecedent tostatute, . . . throwing its root deep into the genius of our
common law." Williams v. Kaiser, 323 U. S. 471, 484, n. 2(1945) (internal quotation marks omitted). The writ appeared in English law several centuries ago, became "anintegral part of our common-law heritage" by the time the

Opinion of the Court
Colonies achieved independence, Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411U. S. 475, 485 (1973), and received explicit recognition in the

Constitution, which forbids suspension of "[t]he Privilege ofthe Writ of Habeas Corpus . . . unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it," Art. I,$ 9, cl. 2.

As it has evolved over the past two centuries, the habeas
statute clearly has expanded habeas corpus "beyond the lim-its that obtained during the 17th and 18th centuries."

Swain v. Pressley, 430 U. S. 372, 380, n. 13 (1977). But "[a]tits historical core, the writ of habeas corpus has served as a
means of reviewing the legality of Executive detention, andit is in that context that its protections have been strongest."
INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 301 (2001). See also Brown v.
Allen, 344 U. S. 443, 533 (1953) (Jackson, J., concurring in
result) ("The historic purpose of the writ has been to relievedetention by executive authorities without judicial trial").

As Justice Jackson wrote in an opinion respecting the avail-ability of habeas corpus to aliens held in U. S. custody:

"Executive imprisonment has been considered oppres-sive and lawless since John, at Runnymede, pledged that
no free man should be imprisoned, dispossessed, out-lawed, or exiled save by the judgment of his peers or by
the law of the land. The judges of England developed
the writ of habeas corpus largely to preserve these im-munities from executive restraint."

Shaughnessy v.
United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U. S. 206, 218-219 (1953)(dissenting opinion).

Consistent with the historic purpose of the writ, this
Court has recognized the federal courts' power to review
applications for habeas relief in a wide variety of cases involving executive detention, in wartime as well as in times
of peace. The Court has, for example, entertained the habeas petitions of an American citizen who plotted an attack
on military installations during the Civil War, Ex parte

Milligan, 4 Wall. 2 (1866), and of admitted enemy aliens con-victed of war crimes during a declared war and held in the

United States, Ex parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1 (1942), and itsinsular possessions, In re Yamashita, 327 U. S. 1 (1946).

The question now before us is whether the habeas statuteconfers a right to judicial review of the legality of executive
detention of aliens in a territory over which the UnitedStates exercises plenary and exclusive jurisdiction, but not
"ultimate sovereignty." 6 III

Respondents' primary submission is that the answer to thejurisdictional question is controlled by our decision in

Eisen-trager. In that case, we held that a Federal District Court

lacked authority to issue a writ of habeas corpus to 21 Ger-man citizens who had been captured by U. S. forces in China,
tried and convicted of war crimes by an American militarycommission headquartered in Nanking, and incarcerated in
the Landsberg Prison in occupied Germany. The Court ofAppeals in Eisentrager had found jurisdiction, reasoning
that "any person who is deprived of his liberty by officials ofthe United States, acting under purported authority of that
Government, and who can show that his confinement is inviolation of a prohibition of the Constitution, has a right to
the writ." Eisentrager v. Forrestal, 174 F. 2d 961, 963(CADC 1949). In reversing that determination, this Court
summarized the six critical facts in the case:

"We are here confronted with a decision whose basicpremise is that these prisoners are entitled, as a constitutional right, to sue in some court of the United Statesfor a writ of habeas corpus. To support that assumption we must hold that a prisoner of our military author-ities is constitutionally entitled to the writ, even though
he (a) is an enemy alien; (b) has never been or residedin the United States; (c) was captured outside of our ter6 1903 Lease Agreement, Art. III.

ritory and there held in military custody as a prisonerof war; (d) was tried and convicted by a Military Commission sitting outside the United States; (e) for offensesagainst laws of war committed outside the United
States; (f) and is at all times imprisoned outside theUnited States." 339 U. S., at 777.

On this set of facts, the Court concluded, "no right to thewrit of habeas corpus appears." Id., at 781.

Petitioners in these cases differ from the Eisentrager de-tainees in important respects: They are not nationals of
countries at war with the United States, and they deny thatthey have engaged in or plotted acts of aggression against
the United States; they have never been afforded access toany tribunal, much less charged with and convicted of wrongdoing; and for more than two years they have been im-prisoned in territory over which the United States exercises
exclusive jurisdiction and control.Not only are petitioners differently situated from the

Ei-sentrager detainees, but the Court in Eisentrager made

quite clear that all six of the facts critical to its dispositionwere relevant only to the question of the prisoners' constitutional entitlement to habeas corpus. Id., at 777. TheCourt had far less to say on the question of the petitioners'
statutory entitlement to habeas review. Its only statementon the subject was a passing reference to the absence of statutory authorization: "Nothing in the text of the Constitutionextends such a right, nor does anything in our statutes."
Id., at 768.Reference to the historical context in which

Eisentragerwas decided explains why the opinion devoted so little attention to the question of statutory jurisdiction. In 1948, justtwo months after the Eisentrager petitioners filed their petition for habeas corpus in the U. S. District Court for theDistrict of Columbia, this Court issued its decision in Ahrens
v. Clark, 335 U. S. 188, a case concerning the application ofthe habeas statute to the petitions of 120 Germans who were

542US2 Unit: $U74 [10-26-06 12:25:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
then being detained at Ellis Island, New York, for deporta-tion to Germany. The

Ahrens detainees had also filed their
petitions in the U. S. District Court for the District ofColumbia, naming the Attorney General as the respondent.

Reading the phrase "within their respective jurisdictions" asused in the habeas statute to require the petitioners' presence within the district court's territorial jurisdiction, the
Court held that the District of Columbia court lacked ju-risdiction to entertain the detainees' claims.

Id., at 192.
Ahrens expressly reserved the question "of what process, ifany, a person confined in an area not subject to the jurisdiction of any district court may employ to assert federalrights."

Id., at 192, n. 4. But as the dissent noted, if the
presence of the petitioner in the territorial jurisdiction of afederal district court were truly a jurisdictional requirement, there could be only one response to that question.
Id., at 209 (opinion of Rutledge, J.).7

When the District Court for the District of Columbia reviewed the German prisoners' habeas application in Eisentrager, it thus dismissed their action on the authority of
Ahrens. See Eisentrager, 339 U. S., at 767, 790. Although
the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court, it implicitly conceded that the District Court lacked jurisdiction
under the habeas statute as it had been interpreted in
Ahrens. The Court of Appeals instead held that petitioners
had a constitutional right to habeas corpus secured by the
Suspension Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 9, cl. 2, reasoning
that "if a person has a right to a writ of habeas corpus, he
cannot be deprived of the privilege by an omission in a fed7 Justice Rutledge wrote:
"[I]f absence of the body detained from the territorial jurisdiction of the
court having jurisdiction of the jailer creates a total and irremediable void
in the court's capacity to act, . . . then it is hard to see how that gap can
be filled by such extraneous considerations as whether there is no other
court in the place of detention from which remedy might be had . . . ."

eral jurisdictional statute." Eisentrager v. Forrestal, 174F. 2d, at 965. In essence, the Court of Appeals concluded

that the habeas statute, as construed in Ahrens, had createdan unconstitutional gap that had to be filled by reference to
"fundamentals." 174 F. 2d, at 963. In its review of thatdecision, this Court, like the Court of Appeals, proceeded
from the premise that "nothing in our statutes" conferredfederal-court jurisdiction, and accordingly evaluated the
Court of Appeals' resort to "fundamentals" on its own terms.339 U. S., at 768.

Because subsequent decisions of this Court have filled thestatutory gap that had occasioned

Eisentrager's resort to"fundamentals," persons detained outside the territorial jurisdiction of any federal district court no longer need rely onthe Constitution as the source of their right to federal habeas
review. In Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky.,410 U. S. 484, 495 (1973), this Court held, contrary to Ahrens,
that the prisoner's presence within the territorial jurisdic-tion of the district court is not "an invariable prerequisite"
to the exercise of district court jurisdiction under the federalhabeas statute. Rather, because "the writ of habeas corpus
does not act upon the prisoner who seeks relief, but upon theperson who holds him in what is alleged to be unlawful custody," a district court acts "within [its] respective jurisdic-tion" within the meaning of $ 2241 as long as "the custodian

8 Although Justice Scalia disputes the basis for the Court of Appeals'
holding, post, at 491 (dissenting opinion), what is most pertinent for present purposes is that this Court clearly understood the Court of Appeals'
decision to rest on constitutional and not statutory grounds. Eisentrager,
339 U. S., at 767 ("[The Court of Appeals] concluded that any person, including an enemy alien, deprived of his liberty anywhere under any purported authority of the United States is entitled to the writ if he can show
that extension to his case of any constitutional rights or limitations would
show his imprisonment illegal; [and] that, although no statutory jurisdiction of such cases is given, courts must be held to possess it as part of
the judicial power of the United States . . ." (emphasis added)).

can be reached by service of process." 410 U. S., at 494-495.
Braden reasoned that its departure from the rule of Ahrens
was warranted in light of developments that "had a profound
impact on the continuing vitality of that decision." 410
U. S., at 497. These developments included, notably, decisions of this Court in cases involving habeas petitioners "confined overseas (and thus outside the territory of any district
court)," in which the Court "held, if only implicitly, that the
petitioners' absence from the district does not present a jurisdictional obstacle to the consideration of the claim." Id.,
at 498 (citing Burns v. Wilson, 346 U. S. 137 (1953), rehearing
denied, 346 U. S. 844, 851-852 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.);
United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S. 11 (1955);
Hirota v. MacArthur, 338 U. S. 197, 199 (1948) (Douglas, J.,
concurring (1949))). Braden thus established that Ahrens
can no longer be viewed as establishing "an inflexible jurisdictional rule," and is strictly relevant only to the question
of the appropriate forum, not to whether the claim can be
heard at all. 410 U. S., at 499-500.

Because Braden overruled the statutory predicate to Eisentrager's holding, Eisentrager plainly does not preclude
the exercise of $ 2241 jurisdiction over petitioners' claims.9

9 The dissent argues that Braden did not overrule Ahrens' jurisdictional
holding, but simply distinguished it. Post, at 494-495. Of course, Braden
itself indicated otherwise, 410 U. S., at 495-500, and a long line of judicial
and scholarly interpretations, beginning with then-Justice Rehnquist's
dissenting opinion, have so understood the decision. See, e. g., id., at 502
("Today the Court overrules Ahrens"); Moore v. Olson, 368 F. 3d 757, 758

IV
Putting Eisentrager and Ahrens to one side, respondentscontend that we can discern a limit on $ 2241 through application of the "longstanding principle of American law" thatcongressional legislation is presumed not to have extraterritorial application unless such intent is clearly manifested.
EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 248(1991). Whatever traction the presumption against extraterritoriality might have in other contexts, it certainly hasno application to the operation of the habeas statute with
respect to persons detained within "the territorial jurisdic-tion" of the United States.

Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336U. S. 281, 285 (1949). By the express terms of its agreements with Cuba, the United States exercises "complete ju-risdiction and control" over the Guantanamo Bay Naval

617, 618 (1988) (per curiam); Eskridge, Overruling Statutory Precedents,
76 Geo. L. J. 1361, App. A (1988).

The dissent also disingenuously contends that the continuing vitality of
Ahrens' jurisdictional holding is irrelevant to the question presented in
these cases, "inasmuch as Ahrens did not pass upon any of the statutory
issues decided by Eisentrager." Post, at 494. But what Justice Scalia
describes as Eisentrager's statutory holding--"that, unaided by the canon
of constitutional avoidance, the statute did not confer jurisdiction over an
alien detained outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts of the
United States," post, at 493--is little more than the rule of Ahrens cloaked
in the garb of Eisentrager's facts. To contend plausibly that this holding
survived Braden, Justice Scalia at a minimum must find a textual basis
for the rule other than the phrase "within their respective jurisdictions"--
a phrase which, after Braden, can no longer be read to require the habeas
petitioner's physical presence within the territorial jurisdiction of a federal district court. Two references to the district of confinement in provisions relating to recordkeeping and pleading requirements in proceedings
before circuit judges hardly suffice in that regard. See post, at 489-490
(citing 28 U. S. C. $$ 2241(a), 2242).

Opinion of the Court
Treaty, Art. III. Respondents themselves concede that thehabeas statute would create federal-court jurisdiction over

the claims of an American citizen held at the base. Tr. ofOral Arg. 27. Considering that the statute draws no distinction between Americans and aliens held in federal custody,there is little reason to think that Congress intended the
geographical coverage of the statute to vary depending onthe detainee's citizenship.

10 Aliens held at the base, no less

than American citizens, are entitled to invoke the federalcourts' authority under $ 2241.

Application of the habeas statute to persons detained atthe base is consistent with the historical reach of the writ
of habeas corpus. At common law, courts exercised habeasjurisdiction over the claims of aliens detained within sovereign territory of the realm,11 as well as the claims of persons

10 Justice Scalia appears to agree that neither the plain text of the
statute nor his interpretation of that text provides a basis for treating
American citizens differently from aliens. Post, at 497. But resisting the
practical consequences of his position, he suggests that he might nevertheless recognize an "atextual exception" to his statutory rule for citizens held beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the federal district courts.

even if a territory was "no part of the realm," there was "no
doubt" as to the court's power to issue writs of habeas corpus
if the territory was "under the subjection of the Crown."
King v. Cowle, 2 Burr. 834, 854-855, 97 Eng. Rep. 587, 598-

Opinion of the Court
In the end, the answer to the question presented is clear.Petitioners contend that they are being held in federal custody in violation of the laws of the United States.15 Noparty questions the District Court's jurisdiction over petitioners' custodians. Cf. Braden, 410 U. S., at 495. Section
(Parker, C. J.) (internal quotation marks omitted). See also King v. The
Earl of Crewe ex parte Sekgome, [1910] 2 K. B. 576, 606 (C. A.) (Williams,
L. J.) (concluding that the writ would run to such a territory); id., at 618
(Farwell, L. J.) (same). As Lord Justice Sellers explained:

"Lord Mansfield gave the writ the greatest breadth of application which
in the then circumstances could well be conceived. . . . `Subjection' is fully
appropriate to the powers exercised or exercisable by this country irrespective of territorial sovereignty or dominion, and it embraces in outlook
the power of the Crown in the place concerned." 1 Q. B., at 310.

Justice Scalia cites In re Ning Yi-Ching, 56 T. L. R. 3 (K. B. Vac. Ct.
1939), for the broad proposition that habeas corpus has been categorically
unavailable to aliens held outside sovereign territory. Post, at 504.
Ex parte Mwenya, however, casts considerable doubt on this narrow view
of the territorial reach of the writ. 1 Q. B., at 295 (Lord Evershed, M. R.)
(noting that In re Ning Yi-Ching relied on Lord Justice Kennedy's opinion
in Ex parte Sekgome concerning the territorial reach of the writ, despite
the opinions of two members of the court who "took a different view upon
this matter"). And In re Ning Yi-Ching itself made quite clear that "the
remedy of habeas corpus was not confined to British subjects," but would
extend to "any person . . . detained" within reach of the writ. 56 T. L. R.,
at 5 (citing Ex parte Sekgome, 2 K. B., at 620 (Kennedy, L. J.)). Moreover,
the result in that case can be explained by the peculiar nature of British
control over the area where the petitioners, four Chinese nationals accused
of various criminal offenses, were being held pending transfer to the local
district court. Although the treaties governing the British Concession at
Tientsin did confer on Britain "certain rights of administration and control," "the right to administer justice" to Chinese nationals was not among
them. 56 T. L. R., at 4-6.

15 Petitioners' allegations--that, although they have engaged neither in

combat nor in acts of terrorism against the United States, they have been
held in executive detention for more than two years in territory subject
to the long-term, exclusive jurisdiction and control of the United States,
without access to counsel and without being charged with any wrongdoing--unquestionably describe "custody in violation of the Constitution
or laws or treaties of the United States." 28 U. S. C. $ 2241(c)(3).

Opinion of the Court
2241, by its terms, requires nothing more. We thereforehold that $ 2241 confers on the District Court jurisdiction to

hear petitioners' habeas corpus challenges to the legality oftheir detention at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base.

V
In addition to invoking the District Court's jurisdictionunder $ 2241, the Al Odah petitioners' complaint invoked the

court's jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. $ 1331, the federal-question statute, as well as $ 1350, the Alien Tort Statute.
The Court of Appeals, again relying on Eisentrager, heldthat the District Court correctly dismissed the claims
founded on $ 1331 and $ 1350 for lack of jurisdiction, even tothe extent that these claims "deal only with conditions of
confinement and do not sound in habeas," because petitionerslack the "privilege of litigation" in U. S. courts. 321 F. 3d,
at 1144 (internal quotation marks omitted). Specifically, thecourt held that because petitioners' $ 1331 and $ 1350 claims
"necessarily rest on alleged violations of the same categoryof laws listed in the habeas corpus statute," they, like claims
founded on the habeas statute itself, must be "beyond thejurisdiction of the federal courts."

Id., at 1144-1145.As explained above, Eisentrager itself erects no bar to the

exercise of federal-court jurisdiction over the petitioners' ha-beas corpus claims. It therefore certainly does not bar the
exercise of federal-court jurisdiction over claims that merelyimplicate the "same category of laws listed in the habeas
corpus statute." But in any event, nothing in Eisentrageror in any of our other cases categorically excludes aliens detained in military custody outside the United States from the" `privilege of litigation' " in U. S. courts. 321 F. 3d, at 1139.
The courts of the United States have traditionally been opento nonresident aliens. Cf.

Disconto Gesellschaft v. Umbreit,208 U. S. 570, 578 (1908) ("Alien citizens, by the policy and

practice of the courts of this country, are ordinarily permit-ted to resort to the courts for the redress of wrongs and the

protection of their rights"). And indeed, 28 U. S. C. $ 1350explicitly confers the privilege of suing for an actionable

"tort . . . committed in violation of the law of nations or atreaty of the United States" on aliens alone. The fact that
petitioners in these cases are being held in military custodyis immaterial to the question of the District Court's jurisdiction over their nonhabeas statutory claims.

VI
Whether and what further proceedings may become neces-sary after respondents make their response to the merits of

petitioners' claims are matters that we need not address now.What is presently at stake is only whether the federal courts
have jurisdiction to determine the legality of the Executive'spotentially indefinite detention of individuals who claim to
be wholly innocent of wrongdoing. Answering that questionin the affirmative, we reverse the judgment of the Court of
Appeals and remand these cases for the District Court toconsider in the first instance the merits of petitioners' claims.

It is so ordered.
Justice Kennedy, concurring in the judgment.
The Court is correct, in my view, to conclude that federalcourts have jurisdiction to consider challenges to the legality

of the detention of foreign nationals held at the GuantanamoBay Naval Base in Cuba. While I reach the same conclusion, my analysis follows a different course. Justice
Scalia exposes the weakness in the Court's conclusion that
Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky., 410 U. S. 484(1973), "overruled the statutory predicate to Eisentrager's

holding," ante, at 479. As he explains, the Court's ap-proach is not a plausible reading of Braden or Johnson v.
Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763 (1950). In my view, the correctcourse is to follow the framework of Eisentrager.

Eisentrager considered the scope of the right to petitionfor a writ of habeas corpus against the backdrop of the con542US2 Unit: $U74 [10-26-06 12:25:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN
486 RASUL v. BUSH

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
stitutional command of the separation of powers. The issuebefore the Court was whether the Judiciary could exercise

jurisdiction over the claims of German prisoners held in theLandsberg prison in Germany following the cessation of hostilities in Europe. The Court concluded the petition couldnot be entertained. The petition was not within the proper
realm of the judicial power. It concerned matters within
the exclusive province of the Executive, or the Executiveand Congress, to determine.

The Court began by noting the "ascending scale of rights"that courts have recognized for individuals depending on
their connection to the United States. Id., at 770. Citizenship provides a longstanding basis for jurisdiction, the Court
noted, and among aliens physical presence within the United
States also "gave the Judiciary power to act." Id., at 769,
771. This contrasted with the "essential pattern for seasonable Executive constraint of enemy aliens." Id., at 773.
The place of the detention was also important to the jurisdictional question, the Court noted. Physical presence in the
United States "implied protection," id., at 777-778, whereas
in Eisentrager "th[e] prisoners at no relevant time were
within any territory over which the United States is sovereign," id., at 778. The Court next noted that the prisoners
in Eisentrager "were actual enemies" of the United States,
proven to be so at trial, and thus could not justify "a limited
opening of our courts" to distinguish the "many [aliens] of
friendly personal disposition to whom the status of enemy"
was unproven. Ibid. Finally, the Court considered the extent to which jurisdiction would "hamper the war effort and
bring aid and comfort to the enemy." Id., at 779. Because
the prisoners in Eisentrager were proven enemy aliens
found and detained outside the United States, and because
the existence of jurisdiction would have had a clear harmful
effect on the Nation's military affairs, the matter was appropriately left to the Executive Branch and there was no jurisdiction for the courts to hear the prisoner's claims.

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
The decision in Eisentrager indicates that there is a realmof political authority over military affairs where the judicial

power may not enter. The existence of this realm acknowl-edges the power of the President as Commander in Chief,
and the joint role of the President and the Congress, in theconduct of military affairs. A faithful application of

Eisentrager, then, requires an initial inquiry into the general circumstances of the detention to determine whether the Courthas the authority to entertain the petition and to grant relief

after considering all of the facts presented. A necessarycorollary of

Eisentrager is that there are circumstances in
which the courts maintain the power and the responsibility
to protect persons from unlawful detention even where military affairs are implicated. See also Ex parte Milligan,
4 Wall. 2 (1866).

The facts here are distinguishable from those in Eisentrager in two critical ways, leading to the conclusion that a
federal court may entertain the petitions. First, Guantanamo Bay is in every practical respect a United States territory, and it is one far removed from any hostilities. The
opinion of the Court well explains the history of its possession by the United States. In a formal sense, the United
States leases the Bay; the 1903 lease agreement states that
Cuba retains "ultimate sovereignty" over it. Lease of
Lands for Coaling and Naval Stations, Feb. 23, 1903, U. S.-
Cuba, Art. III, T. S. No. 418. At the same time, this lease
is no ordinary lease. Its term is indefinite and at the discretion of the United States. What matters is the unchallenged
and indefinite control that the United States has long exercised over Guantanamo Bay. From a practical perspective,
the indefinite lease of Guantanamo Bay has produced a place
that belongs to the United States, extending the "implied
protection" of the United States to it. Eisentrager, supra,
at 777-778.

The second critical set of facts is that the detainees at
Guantanamo Bay are being held indefinitely, and without

Scalia, J., dissenting
benefit of any legal proceeding to determine their status. In
Eisentrager, the prisoners were tried and convicted by a military commission of violating the laws of war and were sen-tenced to prison terms. Having already been subject to

procedures establishing their status, they could not justify"a limited opening of our courts" to show that they were
"of friendly personal disposition" and not enemy aliens. 339
U. S., at 778. Indefinite detention without trial or other pro-ceeding presents altogether different considerations. It

allows friends and foes alike to remain in detention. It sug-gests a weaker case of military necessity and much greater
alignment with the traditional function of habeas corpus.Perhaps, where detainees are taken from a zone of hostilities,
detention without proceedings or trial would be justified by
military necessity for a matter of weeks; but as the period
of detention stretches from months to years, the case for
continued detention to meet military exigencies becomes
weaker.

In light of the status of Guantanamo Bay and the indefinite
pretrial detention of the detainees, I would hold that
federal-court jurisdiction is permitted in these cases. This
approach would avoid creating automatic statutory authority
to adjudicate the claims of persons located outside the United
States, and remains true to the reasoning of Eisentrager.
For these reasons, I concur in the judgment of the Court.

Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

The Court today holds that the habeas statute, 28 U. S. C.

$ 2241, extends to aliens detained by the United States military overseas, outside the sovereign borders of the United
States and beyond the territorial jurisdictions of all its
courts. This is not only a novel holding; it contradicts a
half-century-old precedent on which the military undoubtedly relied, Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763 (1950).
The Court's contention that Eisentrager was somehow ne542US2 Unit: $U74 [10-26-06 12:25:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
gated by Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky., 410U. S. 484 (1973)--a decision that dealt with a different issue

and did not so much as mention Eisentrager--is implausiblein the extreme. This is an irresponsible overturning of settled law in a matter of extreme importance to our forcescurrently in the field. I would leave it to Congress to
change $ 2241, and dissent from the Court's unprecedentedholding.

I
As we have repeatedly said: "Federal courts are courts oflimited jurisdiction. They possess only that power authorized by Constitution and statute, which is not to be expandedby judicial decree. It is to be presumed that a cause lies
outside this limited jurisdiction . . . ." Kokkonen v. Guard-ian Life Ins. Co. of America, 511 U. S. 375, 377 (1994) (citations omitted). The petitioners do not argue that theConstitution independently requires jurisdiction here.

1 Accordingly, these cases turn on the words of $ 2241, a text theCourt today largely ignores. Even a cursory reading of the

habeas statute shows that it presupposes a federal districtcourt with territorial jurisdiction over the detainee. Section 2241(a) states:

"Writs of habeas corpus may be granted by the SupremeCourt, any justice thereof, the district courts and any

circuit judge within their respective jurisdictions."(Emphasis added.)

It further requires that "[t]he order of a circuit judge shallbe entered in the records of

the district court of the districtwherein the restraint complained of is had." (Emphases

added.) And $ 2242 provides that a petition "addressed tothe Supreme Court, a justice thereof or a circuit judge . . .

shall state the reasons for not making application to the dis-trict court of

the district in which the applicant is held."
(Emphases added.) No matter to whom the writ is directed,custodian or detainee, the statute could not be clearer that a

necessary requirement for issuing the writ is that some fed-eral district court have territorial jurisdiction over the detainee. Here, as the Court allows, see ante, at 478, the
Guantanamo Bay detainees are not located within the terri-torial jurisdiction of any federal district court. One would

think that is the end of these cases.The Court asserts, however, that the decisions of this
Court have placed a gloss on the phrase "within their respective jurisdictions" in $ 2241 which allows jurisdiction in these
cases. That is not so. In fact, the only case in point holds
just the opposite (and just what the statute plainly says).
That case is Eisentrager, but to fully understand its implications for the present dispute, I must also discuss our decisions in the earlier case of Ahrens v. Clark, 335 U. S. 188
(1948), and the later case of Braden.

In Ahrens, the Court considered "whether the presence
within the territorial jurisdiction of the District Court of the
person detained is prerequisite to filing a petition for a writ
of habeas corpus." 335 U. S., at 189 (construing 28 U. S. C.

$ 452, the statutory precursor to $ 2241). The Ahrens detainees were held at Ellis Island, New York, but brought
their petitions in the District Court for the District of
Columbia. Interpreting "within their respective jurisdictions," the Court held that a district court has jurisdiction
to issue the writ only on behalf of petitioners detained within
its territorial jurisdiction. It was "not sufficient . . . that
the jailer or custodian alone be found in the jurisdiction."
335 U. S., at 190.

Ahrens explicitly reserved "the question of what process,
if any, a person confined in an area not subject to the jurisdiction of any district court may employ to assert federal
rights." Id., at 192, n. 4. That question, the same question

presented to this Court today, was shortly thereafter re-solved in Eisentrager insofar as noncitizens are concerned.

Eisentrager involved petitions for writs of habeas corpusfiled in the District Court for the District of Columbia by
German nationals imprisoned in Landsberg Prison, Ger-many. The District Court, relying on Ahrens, dismissed the
petitions because the petitioners were not located within itsterritorial jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals reversed.
According to the Court today, the Court of Appeals "implic-itly conceded that the District Court lacked jurisdiction
under the habeas statute as it had been interpreted in Ahrens," and "[i]n essence . . . concluded that the habeas stat-ute, as construed in Ahrens, had created an unconstitutional

gap that had to be filled by reference to `fundamentals.' "Ante, at 477, 478. That is not so. The Court of Appeals concluded that there was statutory jurisdiction. It arrived atthat conclusion by applying the canon of constitutional avoidance: "[I]f the existing jurisdictional act be construed to denythe writ to a person entitled to it as a substantive right, the act
would be unconstitutional. It should be construed, if possi-ble, to avoid that result."

Eisentrager v. Forrestal, 174F. 2d 961, 966 (CADC 1949). In cases where there was no

territorial jurisdiction over the detainee, the Court of Ap-peals held, the writ would lie at the place of a respondent
with directive power over the detainee. "It is not too vio-lent an interpretation of `custody' to construe it as including
those who have directive custody, as well as those who haveimmediate custody, where such interpretation is necessary
to comply with constitutional requirements. . . . The statutemust be so construed, lest it be invalid as constituting a suspension of the writ in violation of the constitutional provi-sion."

This Court's judgment in Eisentrager reversed the Courtof Appeals. The opinion was largely devoted to rejecting

the lower court's constitutional analysis, since the doctrineof constitutional avoidance underlay its statutory conclusion.
But the opinion had to pass judgment on whether the statutegranted jurisdiction, since that was the basis for the judgments of both lower courts. A conclusion of no constitution-ally conferred right would obviously not support reversal of
a judgment that rested upon a statutorily conferred right.3

mainly devoted to the question whether there was statutory jurisdiction.
See, e. g., Brief for Petitioner, O. T. 1949, No. 306, pp. 15-59; Brief for
Respondent, O. T. 1949, No. 306, at 9-27, 38-49.

3 The Court does not seriously dispute my analysis of the Court of Appeals' holding in Eisentrager. Instead, it argues that this Court in Eisentrager "understood the Court of Appeals' decision to rest on constitutional
and not statutory grounds." Ante, at 478, n. 8. That is inherently implausible, given that the Court of Appeals' opinion clearly reached a statutory
holding, and that both parties argued the case to this Court on that basis,
see n. 2, supra. The only evidence of misunderstanding the Court adduces today is the Eisentrager Court's description of the Court of Appeals'
reasoning as "that, although no statutory jurisdiction of such cases is
given, courts must be held to possess it as part of the judicial power of

the United States . . . ." 339 U. S., at 767. That is no misunderstanding,
but an entirely accurate description of the Court of Appeals' reasoning--
the penultimate step of that reasoning rather than its conclusion. The
Court of Appeals went on to hold that, in light of the constitutional imperative, the statute should be interpreted as supplying jurisdiction. See
Eisentrager v. Forrestal, 174 F. 2d 961, 965-967 (CADC 1949). This
Court in Eisentrager undoubtedly understood that, which is why it immediately followed the foregoing description with a description of the
Court of Appeals' conclusion tied to the language of the habeas statute:

Scalia, J., dissenting
And absence of a right to the writ under the clear wordingof the habeas statute is what the Eisentrager opinion held:

"Nothing in the text of the Constitution extends such a right,nor does anything in our statutes." 339 U. S., at 768 (emphasis added). "[T]hese prisoners at no relevant time werewithin any territory over which the United States is sovereign, and the scenes of their offense, their capture, their trialand their punishment

were all beyond the territorial juris-diction of any court of the United States." Id., at 777-778.

See also id., at 781 (concluding that "no right to the writ ofhabeas corpus appears"); id., at 790 (finding "no basis for
invoking federal judicial power in any district"). The brev-ity of the Court's statutory analysis signifies nothing more
than that the Court considered it obvious (as indeed it is)that, unaided by the canon of constitutional avoidance, the
statute did not confer jurisdiction over an alien detained out-side the territorial jurisdiction of the courts of the United
States.

Eisentrager's directly-on-point statutory holding makes itexceedingly difficult for the Court to reach the result it desires today. To do so neatly and cleanly, it must either arguethat our decision in Braden overruled Eisentrager, or admit
that it is overruling Eisentrager. The former course wouldnot pass the laugh test, inasmuch as Braden dealt with a
detainee held within the territorial jurisdiction of a districtcourt, and never mentioned Eisentrager. And the latter
course would require the Court to explain why our almostcategorical rule of stare decisis in statutory cases should be
set aside in order to complicate the present war, and, havingset it aside, to explain why the habeas statute does not mean
what it plainly says. So instead the Court tries an obliquecourse:

"Braden," it claims, "overruled the statutory predi"[W]here deprivation of liberty by an official act occurs outside the territorial jurisdiction of any District Court, the petition will lie in the District
Court which has territorial jurisdiction over officials who have directive

cate to Eisentrager's holding," ante, at 479 (emphasis added),by which it means the statutory analysis of Ahrens. Even

assuming, for the moment, that Braden overruled some as-pect of Ahrens, inasmuch as Ahrens did not pass upon any
of the statutory issues decided by Eisentrager, it is hard tosee how any of that case's "statutory predicate" could have
been impaired.But in fact

Braden did not overrule Ahrens; it distin-guished Ahrens. Braden dealt with a habeas petitioner incarcerated in Alabama. The petitioner filed an applicationfor a writ of habeas corpus in Kentucky, challenging an indictment that had been filed against him in that Common-wealth and naming as respondent the Kentucky court in
which the proceedings were pending. This Court held thatBraden was in custody because a detainer had been issued
against him by Kentucky, and was being executed by Ala-bama, serving as an agent for Kentucky. We found that jurisdiction existed in Kentucky for Braden's petition challeng-ing the Kentucky detainer, notwithstanding his physical
confinement in Alabama. Braden was careful to distinguishthat situation from the general rule established in

Ahrens.

"A further, critical development since our decision inAhrens is the emergence of new classes of prisoners

who are able to petition for habeas corpus because of theadoption of a more expansive definition of the `custody'
requirement of the habeas statute. The overruling of
McNally v. Hill, 293 U. S. 131 (1934), made it possiblefor prisoners in custody under one sentence to attack a

sentence which they had not yet begun to serve. Andit also enabled a petitioner held in one State to attack a
detainer lodged against him by another State. In sucha case, the State holding the prisoner in immediate confinement acts as agent for the demanding State, and thecustodian State is presumably indifferent to the resolution of the prisoner's attack on the detainer. Here, forexample, the petitioner is confined in Alabama, but his

serve no useful purpose to apply the Ahrens rule andrequire that the action be brought in Alabama." 410
U. S., at 498-499 (citations and footnotes omitted; em-phases added).

This cannot conceivably be construed as an overturning ofthe Ahrens rule in other circumstances. See also Braden,
supra, at 499-500 (noting that Ahrens does not establish "aninflexible jurisdictional rule dictating the choice of an inconvenient forum even in a class of cases which could not havebeen foreseen at the time of that decision" (emphasis added)).
Thus, Braden stands for the proposition, and only the propo-sition, that where a petitioner is in custody in multiple jurisdictions within the United States, he may seek a writ of ha-beas corpus in a jurisdiction in which he suffers legal
confinement, though not physical confinement, if his chal-lenge is to that legal confinement. Outside that class of
cases, Braden did not question the general rule of Ahrens(much less that of

Eisentrager). Where, as here, presentphysical custody is at issue, Braden is inapposite, and Eisentrager unquestionably controls.4

4 The Court points to Court of Appeals cases that have described Braden
as "overruling" Ahrens. See ante, at 479-480, n. 9. Even if that description (rather than what I think the correct one, "distinguishing") is accepted, it would not support the Court's view that Ahrens was overruled
with regard to the point on which Eisentrager relied. The ratio decidendi of Braden does not call into question the principle of Ahrens applied
in Eisentrager: that habeas challenge to present physical confinement
must be made in the district where the physical confinement exists. The
Court is unable to produce a single authority that agrees with its conclusion that Braden overruled Eisentrager.

Justice Kennedy recognizes that Eisentrager controls, ante, at 485
(opinion concurring in judgment), but misconstrues that opinion. He
thinks it makes jurisdiction under the habeas statute turn on the circumstances of the detainees' confinement--including, apparently, the availability of legal proceedings and the length of detention, see ante, at 487-

542US2 Unit: $U74 [10-26-06 12:25:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN
496 RASUL v. BUSH

Scalia, J., dissenting
The considerations of forum convenience that drove theanalysis in Braden do not call into question Eisentrager's

holding. The Braden opinion is littered with venue reason-ing of the following sort: "The expense and risk of transporting the petitioner to the Western District of Kentucky,should his presence at a hearing prove necessary, would in
all likelihood be outweighed by the difficulties of transport-ing records and witnesses from Kentucky to the district
where petitioner is confined." 410 U. S., at 494. Of coursenothing could be

more inconvenient than what the Court (onthe alleged authority of Braden) prescribes today: a domestic

hearing for persons held abroad, dealing with events thattranspired abroad.

Attempting to paint Braden as a refutation of Ahrens (andthereby, it is suggested, Eisentrager), today's Court imprecisely describes Braden as citing with approval post-Ahrenscases in which "habeas petitioners" located overseas were
allowed to proceed (without consideration of the jurisdic-tional issue) in the District Court for the District of Columbia. Ante, at 479. In fact, what Braden said is that"[w]here

American citizens confined overseas (and thus out-side the territory of any district court) have sought relief

in habeas corpus, we have held, if only implicitly, that the
488. The Eisentrager Court mentioned those circumstances, however,
only in the course of its constitutional analysis, and not in its application
of the statute. It is quite impossible to read $ 2241 as conditioning its
geographic scope upon them. Among the consequences of making jurisdiction turn upon circumstances of confinement are (1) that courts would
always have authority to inquire into circumstances of confinement, and
(2) that the Executive would be unable to know with certainty that any
given prisoner-of-war camp is immune from writs of habeas corpus. And
among the questions this approach raises: When does definite detention
become indefinite? How much process will suffice to stave off jurisdiction? If there is a terrorist attack at Guantanamo Bay, will the area suddenly fall outside the habeas statute because it is no longer "far removed
from any hostilities," ante, at 487? Justice Kennedy's approach provides enticing law-school-exam imponderables in an area where certainty
is called for.

petitioners' absence from the district does not present a ju-risdictional obstacle to the consideration of the claim." 410

U. S., at 498 (emphasis added). Of course "the existence ofunaddressed jurisdictional defects has no precedential effect," Lewis v. Casey, 518 U. S. 343, 352, n. 2 (1996) (citingcases), but we need not "overrule" those implicit holdings to
decide these cases. Since Eisentrager itself made an exception for such cases, they in no way impugn its holding."With the citizen,"

Eisentrager said, "we are now little concerned, except to set his case apart as untouched by this
decision and to take measure of the difference between his
status and that of all categories of aliens." 339 U. S., at 769.
The constitutional doubt that the Court of Appeals in Eisentrager had erroneously attributed to the lack of habeas for
an alien abroad might indeed exist with regard to a citizen
abroad--justifying a strained construction of the habeas
statute, or (more honestly) a determination of constitutional
right to habeas. Neither party to the present case challenges the atextual extension of the habeas statute to United
States citizens held beyond the territorial jurisdictions of the
United States courts; but the possibility of one atextual exception thought to be required by the Constitution is no justification for abandoning the clear application of the text to
a situation in which it raises no constitutional doubt.

The reality is this: Today's opinion, and today's opinion
alone, overrules Eisentrager; today's opinion, and today's
opinion alone, extends the habeas statute, for the first time,
to aliens held beyond the sovereign territory of the United
States and beyond the territorial jurisdiction of its courts.
No reasons are given for this result; no acknowledgment of
its consequences made. By spurious reliance on Braden the
Court evades explaining why stare decisis can be disregarded, and why Eisentrager was wrong. Normally, we
consider the interests of those who have relied on our decisions. Today, the Court springs a trap on the Executive,
subjecting Guantanamo Bay to the oversight of the federal

Scalia, J., dissenting
courts even though it has never before been thought to bewithin their jurisdiction--and thus making it a foolish place

to have housed alien wartime detainees.

II
In abandoning the venerable statutory line drawn in Eisentrager, the Court boldly extends the scope of the habeasstatute to the four corners of the earth. Part III of its opinion asserts that Braden stands for the proposition that "adistrict court acts `within [its] respective jurisdiction' within
the meaning of $ 2241 as long as `the custodian can bereached by service of process.' "

Ante, at 478-479. En-dorsement of that proposition is repeated in Part IV. Ante,

at 483-484 ("Section 2241, by its terms, requires nothingmore [than the District Court's jurisdiction over petitioners' custodians]").The consequence of this holding, as applied to aliens outside the country, is breathtaking. It permits an alien cap-tured in a foreign theater of active combat to bring a $ 2241
petition against the Secretary of Defense. Over the courseof the last century, the United States has held millions of
alien prisoners abroad. See, e. g., Department of Army, G.Lewis & J. Mewha, History of Prisoner of War Utilization by
the United States Army 1776-1945, Pamphlet No. 20-213,p. 244 (1955) (noting that, "[b]y the end of hostilities [in
World War II], U. S. forces had in custody approximately twomillion enemy soldiers"). A great many of these prisoners
would no doubt have complained about the circumstances oftheir capture and the terms of their confinement. The military is currently detaining over 600 prisoners at GuantanamoBay alone; each detainee undoubtedly has complaints--real
or contrived--about those terms and circumstances. TheCourt's unheralded expansion of federal-court jurisdiction is
not even mitigated by a comforting assurance that the le-gion of ensuing claims will be easily resolved on the merits.
To the contrary, the Court says that the "[p]etitioners'allegations . . . unquestionably describe `custody in violation

542US2 Unit: $U74 [10-26-06 12:25:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.' "
Ante, at 483, n. 15 (citing United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez,
494 U. S. 259, 277-278 (1990) (Kennedy, J., concurring)).
From this point forward, federal courts will entertain petitions from these prisoners, and others like them around the
world, challenging actions and events far away, and forcing
the courts to oversee one aspect of the Executive's conduct
of a foreign war.

Today's carefree Court disregards, without a word of acknowledgment, the dire warning of a more circumspect
Court in Eisentrager:

"To grant the writ to these prisoners might mean that
our army must transport them across the seas for hearing. This would require allocation for shipping space,
guarding personnel, billeting and rations. It might also
require transportation for whatever witnesses the prisoners desired to call as well as transportation for those
necessary to defend legality of the sentence. The writ,
since it is held to be a matter of right, would be equally
available to enemies during active hostilities as in the
present twilight between war and peace. Such trials
would hamper the war effort and bring aid and comfort
to the enemy. They would diminish the prestige of our
commanders, not only with enemies but with wavering
neutrals. It would be difficult to devise more effective
fettering of a field commander than to allow the very
enemies he is ordered to reduce to submission to call
him to account in his own civil courts and divert his
efforts and attention from the military offensive abroad
to the legal defensive at home. Nor is it unlikely that
the result of such enemy litigiousness would be a conflict
between judicial and military opinion highly comforting
to enemies of the United States." 339 U. S., at 778-779.

These results should not be brought about lightly, and certainly not without a textual basis in the statute and on the

Scalia, J., dissenting
strength of nothing more than a decision dealing with anAlabama prisoner's ability to seek habeas in Kentucky.

III
Part IV of the Court's opinion, dealing with the status ofGuantanamo Bay, is a puzzlement. The Court might have

made an effort (a vain one, as I shall discuss) to distinguishEisentrager on the basis of a difference between the status
of Landsberg Prison in Germany and Guantanamo BayNaval Base. But Part III flatly rejected such an approach,
holding that the place of detention of an alien has no bearingon the statutory availability of habeas relief, but "is strictly
relevant only to the question of the appropriate forum."
Ante, at 479. That rejection is repeated at the end of PartIV: "In the end, the answer to the question presented is

clear. . . . No party questions the District Court's jurisdictionover petitioners' custodians. . . . Section 2241, by its terms,
requires nothing more." Ante, at 483-484. Once that hasbeen said, the status of Guantanamo Bay is entirely irrelevant to the issue here. The habeas statute is (according tothe Court) being applied domestically, to "petitioners' custodians," and the doctrine that statutes are presumed to haveno extraterritorial effect simply has no application.

Nevertheless, the Court spends most of Part IV rejectingrespondents' invocation of that doctrine on the peculiar
ground that it has no application to Guantanamo Bay. Ofcourse if the Court is right about that, not only $ 2241 but
presumably all United States law applies there--including,for example, the federal cause of action recognized in

Bivensv. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971),

which would allow prisoners to sue their captors for dam-ages. Fortunately, however, the Court's irrelevant discussion also happens to be wrong.The Court gives only two reasons why the presumption
against extraterritorial effect does not apply to GuantanamoBay. First, the Court says (without any further elaboration)

542US2 Unit: $U74 [10-26-06 12:25:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

501Cite as: 542 U. S. 466 (2004)
Scalia, J., dissenting
that "the United States exercises `complete jurisdiction andcontrol' over the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base [under the

terms of a 1903 lease agreement], and may continue to exer-cise such control permanently if it so chooses [under the
terms of a 1934 Treaty]." Ante, at 480; see ante, at 471.But that lease agreement explicitly recognized "the continuance of the ultimate sovereignty of the Republic of Cuba
over the [leased areas]," Lease of Lands for Coaling andNaval Stations, Feb. 23, 1903, U. S.-Cuba, Art. III, T. S.

No. 418, and the Executive Branch--whose head is "exclu-sively responsible" for the "conduct of diplomatic and foreign
affairs," Eisentrager, supra, at 789--affirms that the lease
and treaty do not render Guantanamo Bay the sovereign territory of the United States, see Brief for Respondents 21.

The Court does not explain how "complete jurisdiction and
control" without sovereignty causes an enclave to be part of
the United States for purposes of its domestic laws. Since
"jurisdiction and control" obtained through a lease is no different in effect from "jurisdiction and control" acquired by
lawful force of arms, parts of Afghanistan and Iraq should
logically be regarded as subject to our domestic laws. Indeed, if "jurisdiction and control" rather than sovereignty
were the test, so should the Landsberg Prison in Germany,
where the United States held the Eisentrager detainees.

The second and last reason the Court gives for the proposition that domestic law applies to Guantanamo Bay is the Solicitor General's concession that there would be habeas jurisdiction over a United States citizen in Guantanamo Bay.
"Considering that the statute draws no distinction between
Americans and aliens held in federal custody, there is little
reason to think that Congress intended the geographical coverage of the statute to vary depending on the detainee's citizenship." Ante, at 481. But the reason the Solicitor General conceded there would be jurisdiction over a detainee
who was a United States citizen had nothing to do with the
special status of Guantanamo Bay: "Our answer to that ques542US2 Unit: $U74 [10-26-06 12:25:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tion, Justice Souter, is that citizens of the United States, be-cause of their constitutional circumstances, may have greater

rights with respect to the scope and reach of the HabeasStatute as the Court has or would interpret it." Tr. of Oral
Arg. 40. See also id., at 27-28. And that position--the po-sition that United States citizens throughout the world may
be entitled to habeas corpus rights--is precisely the position
that this Court adopted in Eisentrager, see 339 U. S., at 769-770, even while holding that aliens abroad

did not have
habeas corpus rights. Quite obviously, the Court's secondreason has no force whatever.

The last part of the Court's Part IV analysis digresses
from the point that the presumption against extraterritorial
application does not apply to Guantanamo Bay. Rather, it
is directed to the contention that the Court's approach to
habeas jurisdiction--applying it to aliens abroad--is "consistent with the historical reach of the writ." Ante, at 481.
None of the authorities it cites comes close to supporting that
claim. Its first set of authorities involves claims by aliens
detained in what is indisputably domestic territory. Ante,
at 481-482, n. 11. Those cases are irrelevant because they
do not purport to address the territorial reach of the writ.
The remaining cases involve issuance of the writ to " `exempt
jurisdictions' " and "other dominions under the sovereign's
control." Ante, at 482, and nn. 12-13. These cases are inapposite for two reasons: Guantanamo Bay is not a sovereign
dominion, and even if it were, jurisdiction would be limited
to subjects.

"Exempt jurisdictions"--the Cinque Ports and Counties
Palatine (located in modern-day England)--were local franchises granted by the Crown. See 1 W. Holdsworth, History
of English Law 108, 532 (7th ed. rev. 1956); 3 W. Blackstone,
Commentaries on the Laws of England 78-79 (1768) (hereinafter Blackstone). These jurisdictions were "exempt" in the
sense that the Crown had ceded management of municipal
affairs to local authorities, whose courts had exclusive juris542US2 Unit: $U74 [10-26-06 12:25:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

diction over private disputes among residents (although re-view was still available in the royal courts by writ of error).

See id., at 79. Habeas jurisdiction nevertheless extendedto those regions on the theory that the delegation of the
King's authority did not include his own prerogative writs.
Ibid.; R. Sharpe, Law of Habeas Corpus 188-189 (2d
ed. 1989) (hereinafter Sharpe). Guantanamo Bay involves
no comparable local delegation of pre-existing sovereignauthority.

The cases involving "other dominions under the sover-eign's control" fare no better. These cases stand only for
the proposition that the writ extended to dominions of the
Crown outside England proper. The authorities relating to
Jersey and the other Channel Islands, for example, see ante,
at 482, n. 13, involve territories that are "dominions of the
crown of Great Britain" even though not "part of the kingdom of England," 1 Blackstone 102-105 (1765), much as were
the colonies in America, id., at 104-105, and Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, id., at 93. See also King v. Cowle, 2 Burr.
834, 853-854, 97 Eng. Rep. 587, 598 (K. B. 1759) (even if Berwick was "no part of the realm of England," it was still a
"dominion of the Crown"). All of the dominions in the cases
the Court cites--and all of the territories Blackstone lists
as dominions, see 1 Blackstone 93-106--are the sovereign
territory of the Crown: colonies, acquisitions and conquests,
and so on. It is an enormous extension of the term to apply
it to installations merely leased for a particular use from
another nation that still retains ultimate sovereignty.

The Court's historical analysis fails for yet another reason:
To the extent the writ's "extraordinary territorial ambit" did
extend to exempt jurisdictions, outlying dominions, and the
like, that extension applied only to British subjects. The
very sources the majority relies on say so: Sharpe explains
the "broader ambit" of the writ on the ground that it is "said

all her subjects." Sharpe 188 (emphasis added). Likewise,
Blackstone explained that the writ "run[s] into all parts of
the king's dominions" because "the king is at all times
entitled to have an account why the liberty of any of his
subjects is restrained." 3 Blackstone 131 (emphasis added).
Ex parte Mwenya, [1960] 1 Q. B. 241 (C. A.), which can
hardly be viewed as evidence of the historic scope of the
writ, only confirms the ongoing relevance of the sovereignsubject relationship to the scope of the writ. There, the
question was whether "the Court of Queen's Bench [can] be
debarred from making an order in favour of a British citizen
unlawfully or arbitrarily detained" in Northern Rhodesia,
which was at the time a protectorate of the Crown. Id., at
300 (Lord Evershed, M. R.). Each judge made clear that the
detainee's status as a subject was material to the resolution
of the case. See id., at 300, 302 (Lord Evershed, M. R.); id.,
at 305 (Romer, L. J.) ("[I]t is difficult to see why the sovereign should be deprived of her right to be informed through
her High Court as to the validity of the detention of her
subjects in that territory"); id., at 311 (Sellers, L. J.) ("I am
not prepared to say, as we are solely asked to say on this
appeal, that the English courts have no jurisdiction in any
circumstances to entertain an application for a writ of habeas
corpus ad subjiciendum in respect of an unlawful detention
of a British subject in a British protectorate"). None of the
exempt-jurisdiction or dominion cases the Court cites involves someone not a subject of the Crown.

The rule against issuing the writ to aliens in foreign lands
was still the law when, in In re Ning Yi-Ching, 56 T. L. R. 3
(K. B. Vac. Ct. 1939), an English court considered the habeas
claims of four Chinese subjects detained on criminal charges
in Tientsin, China, an area over which Britain had by treaty
acquired a lease and "therewith exercised certain rights of
administration and control." Id., at 4. The court held that
Tientsin was a foreign territory, and that the writ would not

issue to a foreigner detained there. The Solicitor-Generalhad argued that "[t]here was no case on record in which a

writ of habeas corpus had been obtained on behalf of a for-eign subject on foreign territory," id., at 5, and the court
"listened in vain for a case in which the writ of habeas cor-pus had issued in respect of a foreigner detained in a part of
the world which was not a part of the King's dominions orrealm,"

id., at 6.5In sum, the Court's treatment of Guantanamo Bay, like

its treatment of $ 2241, is a wrenching departure fromprecedent.

5 The Court argues at some length that Ex parte Mwenya, [1960] 1 Q. B.
241 (C. A.), calls into question my reliance on In re Ning Yi-Ching. See
ante, at 15, n. 14. But as I have explained, see supra, at 504, Mwenya
dealt with a British subject and the court went out of its way to explain
that its expansive description of the scope of the writ was premised on
that fact. The Court cites not a single case holding that aliens held outside the territory of the sovereign were within reach of the writ.

6 The Court grasps at two other bases for jurisdiction: the Alien Tort

Statute (ATS), 28 U. S. C. $ 1350, and the federal-question statute, $ 1331.
The former is not presented to us. The ATS, while invoked below, was
repudiated as a basis for jurisdiction by all petitioners, either in their
petition for certiorari, in their briefing before this Court, or at oral argument. See Pet. for Cert. in No. 03-334, p. 2, n. 1 ("Petitioners withdraw
any reliance on the Alien Tort Claims Act . . ."); Brief for Petitioners in
No. 03-343, p. 13; Tr. of Oral Arg. 6.

With respect to $ 1331, petitioners assert a variety of claims arising
under the Constitution, treaties, and laws of the United States. In Eisentrager, though the Court's holding focused on $ 2241, its analysis spoke
more broadly: "We have pointed out that the privilege of litigation has
been extended to aliens, whether friendly or enemy, only because permitting their presence in the country implied protection. No such basis can
be invoked here, for these prisoners at no relevant time were within any
territory over which the United States is sovereign, and the scenes of their
offense, their capture, their trial and their punishment were all beyond the
territorial jurisdiction of any court of the United States." 339 U. S., at
777-778. That reasoning dooms petitioners' claims under $ 1331, at least
where Congress has erected a jurisdictional bar to their raising such
claims in habeas.

* * *
Departure from our rule of stare decisis in statutory casesis always extraordinary; it ought to be unthinkable when the

departure has a potentially harmful effect upon the Nation'sconduct of a war. The Commander in Chief and his subordinates had every reason to expect that the internment of com-batants at Guantanamo Bay would not have the consequence
of bringing the cumbersome machinery of our domesticcourts into military affairs. Congress is in session. If it
wished to change federal judges' habeas jurisdiction fromwhat this Court had previously held that to be, it could have
done so. And it could have done so by intelligent revisionof the statute,

7 instead of by today's clumsy, countertextual reinterpretation that confers upon wartime prisonersgreater habeas rights than domestic detainees. The latter

must challenge their present physical confinement in the dis-trict of their confinement, see Rumsfeld v. Padilla, ante,
p. 426, whereas under today's strange holding GuantanamoBay detainees can petition in any of the 94 federal judicial
districts. The fact that extraterritorially located detaineeslack the district of detention that the statute requires has
been converted from a factor that precludes their ability tobring a petition at all into a factor that frees them to petition
wherever they wish--and, as a result, to forum-shop. Forthis Court to create such a monstrous scheme in time of war,
and in frustration of our military commanders' reliance uponclearly stated prior law, is judicial adventurism of the worst
sort. I dissent.

7 It could, for example, provide for jurisdiction by placing Guantanamo
Bay within the territory of an existing district court; or by creating a
district court for Guantanamo Bay, as it did for the Panama Canal Zone,
see 22 U. S. C. $ 3841(a) (repealed 1979).

HAMDI et al. v. RUMSFELD, SECRETARY OF

DEFENSE, et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 03-6696. Argued April 28, 2004--Decided June 28, 2004
After Congress passed a resolution--the Authorization for Use of Military

Force (AUMF)--empowering the President to "use all necessary and
appropriate force" against "nations, organizations, or persons" that he
determines "planned, authorized, committed, or aided" in the September
11, 2001, al Qaeda terrorist attacks, the President ordered the Armed
Forces to Afghanistan to subdue al Qaeda and quell the supporting Taliban regime. Petitioner Yaser Hamdi, an American citizen whom the
Government has classified as an "enemy combatant" for allegedly taking
up arms with the Taliban during the conflict, was captured in Afghanistan and presently is detained at a naval brig in Charleston, S. C.
Hamdi's father filed this habeas petition on his behalf under 28 U. S. C.

$ 2241, alleging, among other things, that the Government holds his son
in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Although the
petition did not elaborate on the factual circumstances of Hamdi's capture and detention, his father has asserted in other documents in the
record that Hamdi went to Afghanistan to do "relief work" less than
two months before September 11 and could not have received military
training. The Government attached to its response to the petition a
declaration from Michael Mobbs (Mobbs Declaration), a Defense Department official. The Mobbs Declaration alleges various details regarding
Hamdi's trip to Afghanistan, his affiliation there with a Taliban unit
during a time when the Taliban was battling U. S. allies, and his subsequent surrender of an assault rifle. The District Court found that the
Mobbs Declaration, standing alone, did not support Hamdi's detention
and ordered the Government to turn over numerous materials for in
camera review. The Fourth Circuit reversed, stressing that, because it
was undisputed that Hamdi was captured in an active combat zone, no
factual inquiry or evidentiary hearing allowing Hamdi to be heard or to
rebut the Government's assertions was necessary or proper. Concluding that the factual averments in the Mobbs Declaration, if accurate,
provided a sufficient basis upon which to conclude that the President had
constitutionally detained Hamdi, the court ordered the habeas petition
dismissed. The appeals court held that, assuming that express congressional authorization of the detention was required by 18 U. S. C.

$ 4001(a)--which provides that "[n]o citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress"--the AUMF's "necessary and appropriate force" language provided the authorization for Hamdi's detention. It also concluded that
Hamdi is entitled only to a limited judicial inquiry into his detention's
legality under the war powers of the political branches, and not to a
searching review of the factual determinations underlying his seizure.

510 HAMDI v. RUMSFELD

Opinion of O'Connor, J.

I
On September 11, 2001, the al Qaeda terrorist networkused hijacked commercial airliners to attack prominent targets in the United States. Approximately 3,000 people werekilled in those attacks. One week later, in response to these
"acts of treacherous violence," Congress passed a resolutionauthorizing the President to "use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or personshe determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the
terrorist attacks" or "harbored such organizations or per-sons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organiza-tions or persons." Authorization for Use of Military Force
(AUMF), 115 Stat. 224. Soon thereafter, the President or-dered United States Armed Forces to Afghanistan, with a
mission to subdue al Qaeda and quell the Taliban regime thatwas known to support it.

This case arises out of the detention of a man whom theGovernment alleges took up arms with the Taliban during
this conflict. His name is Yaser Esam Hamdi. Born inLouisiana in 1980, Hamdi moved with his family to Saudi
Arabia as a child. By 2001, the parties agree, he residedin Afghanistan. At some point that year, he was seized by
members of the Northern Alliance, a coalition of militarygroups opposed to the Taliban government, and eventually
was turned over to the United States military. The Govern-ment asserts that it initially detained and interrogated
Hamdi in Afghanistan before transferring him to the UnitedStates Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay in January 2002. In
April 2002, upon learning that Hamdi is an American citizen,authorities transferred him to a naval brig in Norfolk, Virginia, where he remained until a recent transfer to a brig inCharleston, South Carolina. The Government contends that
Hamdi is an "enemy combatant," and that this status justifiesholding him in the United States indefinitely--without formal charges or proceedings--unless and until it makes the

511Cite as: 542 U. S. 507 (2004)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
determination that access to counsel or further process is
warranted.

In June 2002, Hamdi's father, Esam Fouad Hamdi, filed the
present petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U. S. C.

$ 2241 in the Eastern District of Virginia, naming as petitioners his son and himself as next friend. The elder Hamdi
alleges in the petition that he has had no contact with his
son since the Government took custody of him in 2001, and
that the Government has held his son "without access to
legal counsel or notice of any charges pending against him."
App. 103, 104. The petition contends that Hamdi's detention
was not legally authorized. Id., at 105. It argues that, "[a]s
an American citizen, . . . Hamdi enjoys the full protections of
the Constitution," and that Hamdi's detention in the United
States without charges, access to an impartial tribunal, or
assistance of counsel "violated and continue[s] to violate the
Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States
Constitution." Id., at 107. The habeas petition asks that
the court, among other things, (1) appoint counsel for Hamdi;
(2) order respondents to cease interrogating him; (3) declare
that he is being held in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth
Amendments; (4) "[t]o the extent Respondents contest any
material factual allegations in this Petition, schedule an evidentiary hearing, at which Petitioners may adduce proof in
support of their allegations"; and (5) order that Hamdi be
released from his "unlawful custody." Id., at 108-109. Although his habeas petition provides no details with regard
to the factual circumstances surrounding his son's capture
and detention, Hamdi's father has asserted in documents
found elsewhere in the record that his son went to Afghanistan to do "relief work," and that he had been in that country
less than two months before September 11, 2001, and could
not have received military training. Id., at 188-189. The
20-year-old was traveling on his own for the first time, his
father says, and "[b]ecause of his lack of experience, he was

trapped in Afghanistan once the military campaign began."
Ibid.

The District Court found that Hamdi's father was a propernext friend, appointed the federal public defender as counsel

for the petitioners, and ordered that counsel be given accessto Hamdi.

Id., at 113-116. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed that order, holding that
the District Court had failed to extend appropriate deferenceto the Government's security and intelligence interests. 296

F. 3d 278, 279, 283 (2002). It directed the District Court toconsider "the most cautious procedures first,"

id., at 284, and
to conduct a deferential inquiry into Hamdi's status, id., at
283. It opined that "if Hamdi is indeed an `enemy combatant' who was captured during hostilities in Afghanistan, the
government's present detention of him is a lawful one."
Ibid.

On remand, the Government filed a response and a motion
to dismiss the petition. It attached to its response a declaration from one Michael Mobbs (hereinafter Mobbs Declaration), who identified himself as Special Advisor to the Under
Secretary of Defense for Policy. Mobbs indicated that in
this position, he has been "substantially involved with matters related to the detention of enemy combatants in the current war against the al Qaeda terrorists and those who support and harbor them (including the Taliban)." App. 148.
He expressed his "familiar[ity]" with Department of Defense
and United States military policies and procedures applicable
to the detention, control, and transfer of al Qaeda and Taliban personnel, and declared that "[b]ased upon my review of
relevant records and reports, I am also familiar with the
facts and circumstances related to the capture of . . . Hamdi
and his detention by U. S. military forces." Ibid.

Mobbs then set forth what remains the sole evidentiary
support that the Government has provided to the courts
for Hamdi's detention. The declaration states that Hamdi
"traveled to Afghanistan" in July or August 2001, and that

542US2 Unit: $U75 [11-01-06 18:26:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

513Cite as: 542 U. S. 507 (2004)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
he thereafter "affiliated with a Taliban military unit andreceived weapons training."

Ibid. It asserts that Hamdi
"remained with his Taliban unit following the attacks ofSeptember 11" and that, during the time when Northern

Alliance forces were "engaged in battle with the Taliban,""Hamdi's Taliban unit surrendered" to those forces, after
which he "surrender[ed] his Kalishnikov assault rifle" to
them. Id., at 148-149. The Mobbs Declaration also statesthat, because al Qaeda and the Taliban "were and are hostile forces engaged in armed conflict with the armed forcesof the United States," "individuals associated with" those
groups "were and continue to be enemy combatants." Id.,
at 149. Mobbs states that Hamdi was labeled an enemy
combatant "[b]ased upon his interviews and in light of his
association with the Taliban." Ibid. According to the declaration, a series of "U. S. military screening team[s]" determined that Hamdi met "the criteria for enemy combatants,"
and "[a] subsequent interview of Hamdi has confirmed the
fact that he surrendered and gave his firearm to Northern
Alliance forces, which supports his classification as an enemy
combatant." Id., at 149-150.

After the Government submitted this declaration, the
Fourth Circuit directed the District Court to proceed in accordance with its earlier ruling and, specifically, to " `consider
the sufficiency of the Mobbs declaration as an independent
matter before proceeding further.' " 316 F. 3d 450, 462
(2003). The District Court found that the Mobbs Declaration fell "far short" of supporting Hamdi's detention. App.
292. It criticized the generic and hearsay nature of the affidavit, calling it "little more than the government's `sayso.' " Id., at 298. It ordered the Government to turn over
numerous materials for in camera review, including copies
of all of Hamdi's statements and the notes taken from interviews with him that related to his reasons for going to Afghanistan and his activities therein; a list of all interrogators
who had questioned Hamdi and their names and addresses;

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
statements by members of the Northern Alliance regardingHamdi's surrender and capture; a list of the dates and locations of his capture and subsequent detentions; and thenames and titles of the United States Government officials
who made the determinations that Hamdi was an enemycombatant and that he should be moved to a naval brig.

Id.,
at 185-186. The court indicated that all of these materials
were necessary for "meaningful judicial review" of whetherHamdi's detention was legally authorized and whether

Hamdi had received sufficient process to satisfy the DueProcess Clause of the Constitution and relevant treaties or
military regulations. Id., at 291-292.

The Government sought to appeal the production order,
and the District Court certified the question of whether the
Mobbs Declaration, " `standing alone, is sufficient as a matter
of law to allow a meaningful judicial review of [Hamdi's] classification as an enemy combatant.' " 316 F. 3d, at 462. The
Fourth Circuit reversed, but did not squarely answer the certified question. It instead stressed that, because it was "undisputed that Hamdi was captured in a zone of active combat
in a foreign theater of conflict," no factual inquiry or evidentiary hearing allowing Hamdi to be heard or to rebut the
Government's assertions was necessary or proper. Id., at
459. Concluding that the factual averments in the Mobbs
Declaration, "if accurate," provided a sufficient basis upon
which to conclude that the President had constitutionally detained Hamdi pursuant to the President's war powers, it
ordered the habeas petition dismissed. Id., at 473. The
Fourth Circuit emphasized that the "vital purposes" of the
detention of uncharged enemy combatants--preventing

those combatants from rejoining the enemy while relieving
the military of the burden of litigating the circumstances of
wartime captures halfway around the globe--were interests
"directly derived from the war powers of Articles I and II."
Id., at 465-466. In that court's view, because "Article III
contains nothing analogous to the specific powers of war so

542US2 Unit: $U75 [11-01-06 18:26:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
carefully enumerated in Articles I and II," id., at 463, sepa-ration of powers principles prohibited a federal court from

"delv[ing] further into Hamdi's status and capture," id., at473. Accordingly, the District Court's more vigorous inquiry "went far beyond the acceptable scope of review."
Ibid.

On the more global question of whether legal authorization
exists for the detention of citizen enemy combatants at all,the Fourth Circuit rejected Hamdi's arguments that 18

U. S. C. $ 4001(a) and Article 5 of the Geneva Convention ren-dered any such detentions unlawful. The court expressed
doubt as to Hamdi's argument that $ 4001(a), which provides
that "[n]o citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained
by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress,"
required express congressional authorization of detentions of
this sort. But it held that, in any event, such authorization
was found in the post-September 11 AUMF. 316 F. 3d, at
467. Because "capturing and detaining enemy combatants
is an inherent part of warfare," the court held, "the `necessary and appropriate force' referenced in the congressional
resolution necessarily includes the capture and detention of
any and all hostile forces arrayed against our troops." Ibid.;
see also id., at 467-468 (noting that Congress, in 10 U. S. C.

$ 956(5), had specifically authorized the expenditure of funds
for keeping prisoners of war and persons whose status was
determined "to be similar to prisoners of war," and concluding that this appropriation measure also demonstrated that
Congress had "authoriz[ed these individuals'] detention in
the first instance"). The court likewise rejected Hamdi's
Geneva Convention claim, concluding that the convention is
not self-executing and that, even if it were, it would not preclude the Executive from detaining Hamdi until the cessation
of hostilities. 316 F. 3d, at 468-469.

Finally, the Fourth Circuit rejected Hamdi's contention
that its legal analyses with regard to the authorization for
the detention scheme and the process to which he was consti542US2 Unit: $U75 [11-01-06 18:26:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tutionally entitled should be altered by the fact that he isan American citizen detained on American soil. Relying on

Ex parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1 (1942), the court emphasizedthat "[o]ne who takes up arms against the United States in
a foreign theater of war, regardless of his citizenship, mayproperly be designated an enemy combatant and treated as
such." 316 F. 3d, at 475. "The privilege of citizenship," thecourt held, "entitles Hamdi to a limited judicial inquiry into
his detention, but only to determine its legality under thewar powers of the political branches. At least where it is
undisputed that he was present in a zone of active combatoperations, we are satisfied that the Constitution does not
entitle him to a searching review of the factual determina-tions underlying his seizure there."

Ibid.The Fourth Circuit denied rehearing en banc, 337 F. 3d 335

(2003), and we granted certiorari, 540 U. S. 1099 (2004). Wenow vacate the judgment below and remand.

II
The threshold question before us is whether the Executivehas the authority to detain citizens who qualify as "enemy

combatants." There is some debate as to the proper scopeof this term, and the Government has never provided any
court with the full criteria that it uses in classifying individu-als as such. It has made clear, however, that, for purposes
of this case, the "enemy combatant" that it is seeking to de-tain is an individual who, it alleges, was " `part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners' "in Afghanistan and who " `engaged in an armed conflict
against the United States' " there. Brief for Respondents3. We therefore answer only the narrow question before us:
whether the detention of citizens falling within that defini-tion is authorized.

The Government maintains that no explicit congressionalauthorization is required, because the Executive possesses
plenary authority to detain pursuant to Article II of the Con542US2 Unit: $U75 [11-01-06 18:26:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

517Cite as: 542 U. S. 507 (2004)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
stitution. We do not reach the question whether Article IIprovides such authority, however, because we agree with the

Government's alternative position, that Congress has in factauthorized Hamdi's detention, through the AUMF.

Our analysis on that point, set forth below, substantiallyoverlaps with our analysis of Hamdi's principal argument for
the illegality of his detention. He posits that his detention
is forbidden by 18 U. S. C. $ 4001(a). Section 4001(a) statesthat "[n]o citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained

by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress."Congress passed $ 4001(a) in 1971 as part of a bill to repeal
the Emergency Detention Act of 1950, 50 U. S. C. $ 811
et seq., which provided procedures for executive detention,
during times of emergency, of individuals deemed likely to
engage in espionage or sabotage. Congress was particularly concerned about the possibility that the Act could be
used to reprise the Japanese-American internment camps of
World War II. H. R. Rep. No. 92-116 (1971); id., at 4 ("The
concentration camp implications of the legislation render it
abhorrent"). The Government again presses two alternative positions. First, it argues that $ 4001(a), in light of its
legislative history and its location in Title 18, applies only to
"the control of civilian prisons and related detentions," not
to military detentions. Brief for Respondents 21. Second,
it maintains that $ 4001(a) is satisfied, because Hamdi is being
detained "pursuant to an Act of Congress"--the AUMF.
Id., at 21-22. Again, because we conclude that the Government's second assertion is correct, we do not address the
first. In other words, for the reasons that follow, we conclude that the AUMF is explicit congressional authorization
for the detention of individuals in the narrow category we
describe (assuming, without deciding, that such authorization
is required), and that the AUMF satisfied $ 4001(a)'s requirement that a detention be "pursuant to an Act of Congress"
(assuming, without deciding, that $ 4001(a) applies to military detentions).

518 HAMDI v. RUMSFELD

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
The AUMF authorizes the President to use "all necessaryand appropriate force" against "nations, organizations, or

persons" associated with the September 11, 2001, terroristattacks. 115 Stat. 224. There can be no doubt that individuals who fought against the United States in Afghanistan aspart of the Taliban, an organization known to have supported
the al Qaeda terrorist network responsible for those attacks,
are individuals Congress sought to target in passing theAUMF. We conclude that detention of individuals falling

into the limited category we are considering, for the durationof the particular conflict in which they were captured, is so
fundamental and accepted an incident to war as to be an
exercise of the "necessary and appropriate force" Congress
has authorized the President to use.

The capture and detention of lawful combatants and the
capture, detention, and trial of unlawful combatants, by
"universal agreement and practice," are "important incident[s] of war." Ex parte Quirin, supra, at 28, 30. The
purpose of detention is to prevent captured individuals from
returning to the field of battle and taking up arms once
again. Naqvi, Doubtful Prisoner-of-War Status, 84 Int'l

must be removed as completely as practicable from the front,treated humanely and in time exchanged, repatriated or otherwise released" (footnotes omitted)).There is no bar to this Nation's holding one of its own
citizens as an enemy combatant. In Quirin, one of the de-tainees, Haupt, alleged that he was a naturalized United
States citizen. 317 U. S., at 20. We held that "[c]itizens
who associate themselves with the military arm of the enemygovernment, and with its aid, guidance and direction enter

this country bent on hostile acts, are enemy belligerentswithin the meaning of . . . the law of war."

Id., at 37-38.
While Haupt was tried for violations of the law of war, nothing in Quirin suggests that his citizenship would have precluded his mere detention for the duration of the relevant
hostilities. See id., at 30-31. See also Lieber Code || 153,
Instructions for the Government of Armies of the United
States in the Field, Gen. Order No. 100 (1863), reprinted in
2 F. Lieber, Miscellaneous Writings, p. 273, || 153 (1880) (contemplating, in code binding the Union Army during the Civil
War, that "captured rebels" would be treated "as prisoners
of war"). Nor can we see any reason for drawing such a
line here. A citizen, no less than an alien, can be "part of or
supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition
partners" and "engaged in an armed conflict against the
United States," Brief for Respondents 3; such a citizen, if
released, would pose the same threat of returning to the
front during the ongoing conflict.

In light of these principles, it is of no moment that the
AUMF does not use specific language of detention. Because
detention to prevent a combatant's return to the battlefield
is a fundamental incident of waging war, in permitting the
use of "necessary and appropriate force," Congress has
clearly and unmistakably authorized detention in the narrow
circumstances considered here.

Hamdi objects, nevertheless, that Congress has not authorized the indefinite detention to which he is now subject.

520 HAMDI v. RUMSFELD

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
The Government responds that "the detention of enemycombatants during World War II was just as `indefinite'

while that war was being fought." Id., at 16. We takeHamdi's objection to be not to the lack of certainty regarding
the date on which the conflict will end, but to the substantialprospect of perpetual detention. We recognize that the national security underpinnings of the "war on terror," although crucially important, are broad and malleable. As theGovernment concedes, "given its unconventional nature, the

current conflict is unlikely to end with a formal cease-fireagreement."

Ibid. The prospect Hamdi raises is therefore
not farfetched. If the Government does not consider this
unconventional war won for two generations, and if it maintains during that time that Hamdi might, if released, rejoin
forces fighting against the United States, then the position
it has taken throughout the litigation of this case suggests
that Hamdi's detention could last for the rest of his life.

It is a clearly established principle of the law of war that
detention may last no longer than active hostilities. See Article 118 of the Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the
Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, [1955] 6
U. S. T. 3316, 3406, T. I. A. S. No. 3364 ("Prisoners of war
shall be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities"). See also Article 20 of the
Hague Convention (II) on Laws and Customs of War on
Land, July 29, 1899, 32 Stat. 1817 (as soon as possible after
"conclusion of peace"); Hague Convention (IV), supra, Oct.
18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2301 ("conclusion of peace" (Art. 20)); Geneva Convention, supra, July 27, 1929, 47 Stat. 2055 (repatriation should be accomplished with the least possible delay

119, 129, Geneva Convention (III), 6 U. S. T., at 3384, 3392,3406, 3418)).

Hamdi contends that the AUMF does not authorize in-definite or perpetual detention. Certainly, we agree that
indefinite detention for the purpose of interrogation is not
authorized. Further, we understand Congress' grant ofauthority for the use of "necessary and appropriate force" to

include the authority to detain for the duration of the rele-vant conflict, and our understanding is based on longstanding
law-of-war principles. If the practical circumstances of a
given conflict are entirely unlike those of the conflicts that
informed the development of the law of war, that understanding may unravel. But that is not the situation we face
as of this date. Active combat operations against Taliban
fighters apparently are ongoing in Afghanistan. See, e. g.,
Constable, U. S. Launches New Operation in Afghanistan,
Washington Post, Mar. 14, 2004, p. A22 (reporting that 13,500
United States troops remain in Afghanistan, including several thousand new arrivals); Dept. of Defense, News Transcript, Gen. J. Abizaid Central Command Operations Update Briefing, Apr. 30, 2004, http://www.defenselink.mil/
transcripts/2004/tr20040430-1402.html (as visited June 8,
2004, and available in Clerk of Court's case file) (media
briefing describing ongoing operations in Afghanistan involving 20,000 United States troops). The United States may
detain, for the duration of these hostilities, individuals legitimately determined to be Taliban combatants who "engaged
in an armed conflict against the United States." If the record establishes that United States troops are still involved
in active combat in Afghanistan, those detentions are part of
the exercise of "necessary and appropriate force," and therefore are authorized by the AUMF.

Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, 125 (1866), does not undermine our holding about the Government's authority to seize

522 HAMDI v. RUMSFELD

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
enemy combatants, as we define that term today. In thatcase, the Court made repeated reference to the fact that its

inquiry into whether the military tribunal had jurisdiction totry and punish Milligan turned in large part on the fact that
Milligan was not a prisoner of war, but a resident of Indianaarrested while at home there. Id., at 118, 131. That fact
was central to its conclusion. Had Milligan been capturedwhile he was assisting Confederate soldiers by carrying a
rifle against Union troops on a Confederate battlefield, theholding of the Court might well have been different. The
Court's repeated explanations that Milligan was not a prisoner of war suggest that had these different circumstancesbeen present he could have been detained under military authority for the duration of the conflict, whether or not he wasa citizen.

1

Moreover, as Justice Scalia acknowledges, the Court in
Ex parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1 (1942), dismissed the language
of Milligan that the petitioners had suggested prevented
them from being subject to military process. Post, at 570(dissenting opinion). Clear in this rejection was a disavowal

of the New York State cases cited in Milligan, 4 Wall., at128-129, on which

Justice Scalia relies. See ibid. Both
Smith v. Shaw, 12 Johns. *257 (N. Y. 1815), and M'Connell v.
Hampton, 12 Johns. *234 (N. Y. 1815), were civil suits for
false imprisonment. Even accepting that these cases oncecould have been viewed as standing for the sweeping proposition for which Justice Scalia cites them--that the mili-tary does not have authority to try an American citizen accused of spying against his country during wartime--Quirinmakes undeniably clear that this is not the law today.

1 Here the basis asserted for detention by the military is that Hamdi
was carrying a weapon against American troops on a foreign battlefield;
that is, that he was an enemy combatant. The legal category of enemy
combatant has not been elaborated upon in great detail. The permissible
bounds of the category will be defined by the lower courts as subsequent
cases are presented to them.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Haupt, like the citizens in Smith and M'Connell, was accusedof being a spy. The Court in

Quirin found him "subject to
trial and punishment by [a] military tribuna[l]" for thoseacts, and held that his citizenship did not change this result.

317 U. S., at 31, 37-38.

Quirin was a unanimous opinion. It both postdates and
clarifies Milligan, providing us with the most apposite precedent that we have on the question of whether citizens maybe detained in such circumstances. Brushing aside such

precedent--particularly when doing so gives rise to a hostof new questions never dealt with by this Court--is unjustified and unwise.

To the extent that Justice Scalia accepts the precedential value of Quirin, he argues that it cannot guide our inquiry here because "[i]n Quirin it was uncontested that the
petitioners were members of enemy forces," while Hamdi
challenges his classification as an enemy combatant. Post,
at 571. But it is unclear why, in the paradigm outlined by
Justice Scalia, such a concession should have any relevance. Justice Scalia envisions a system in which the
only options are congressional suspension of the writ of habeas corpus or prosecution for treason or some other crime.
Post, at 554. He does not explain how his historical analysis
supports the addition of a third option--detention under
some other process after concession of enemy-combatant status--or why a concession should carry any different effect
than proof of enemy-combatant status in a proceeding that
comports with due process. To be clear, our opinion only
finds legislative authority to detain under the AUMF once it
is sufficiently clear that the individual is, in fact, an enemy
combatant; whether that is established by concession or by
some other process that verifies this fact with sufficient certainty seems beside the point.

Further, Justice Scalia largely ignores the context of
this case: a United States citizen captured in a foreign combat zone. Justice Scalia refers to only one case involv542US2 Unit: $U75 [11-01-06 18:26:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN
524 HAMDI v. RUMSFELD

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
ing this factual scenario--a case in which a United Statescitizen-prisoner of war (a member of the Italian army) from

World War II was seized on the battlefield in Sicily and thenheld in the United States. The court in that case held that
the military detention of that United States citizen was law-ful. See In re Territo, 156 F. 2d, at 148.

Justice Scalia's treatment of that case--in a footnote--suffers from the same defect as does his treatment of

Quirin:Because
Justice Scalia finds the fact of battlefield captureirrelevant, his distinction based on the fact that the petitioner "conceded" enemy-combatant status is beside thepoint. See

supra, at 523. Justice Scalia can point to nocase or other authority for the proposition that those captured on a foreign battlefield (whether detained there orin U. S. territory) cannot be detained outside the criminal
process.Moreover,

Justice Scalia presumably would come to adifferent result if Hamdi had been kept in Afghanistan or

even Guantanamo Bay. See post, at 577. This creates aperverse incentive. Military authorities faced with the
stark choice of submitting to the full-blown criminal processor releasing a suspected enemy combatant captured on the
battlefield will simply keep citizen-detainees abroad. In-deed, the Government transferred Hamdi from Guantanamo
Bay to the United States naval brig only after it learned thathe might be an American citizen. It is not at all clear why
that should make a determinative constitutional difference.

III
Even in cases in which the detention of enemy combatantsis legally authorized, there remains the question of what

process is constitutionally due to a citizen who disputes hisenemy-combatant status. Hamdi argues that he is owed a
meaningful and timely hearing and that "extra-judicial de-tention [that] begins and ends with the submission of an affidavit based on third-hand hearsay" does not comport with

the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Brief for Petition-ers 16. The Government counters that any more process

than was provided below would be both unworkable and"constitutionally intolerable." Brief for Respondents 46.
Our resolution of this dispute requires a careful examinationboth of the writ of habeas corpus, which Hamdi now seeks
to employ as a mechanism of judicial review, and of the DueProcess Clause, which informs the procedural contours of
that mechanism in this instance.

A
Though they reach radically different conclusions on theprocess that ought to attend the present proceeding, the parties begin on common ground. All agree that, absent sus-pension, the writ of habeas corpus remains available to every
individual detained within the United States. U. S. Const.,Art. I, $ 9, cl. 2 ("The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus
shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion orInvasion the public Safety may require it"). Only in the rarest of circumstances has Congress seen fit to suspend thewrit. See, e. g., Act of Mar. 3, 1863, ch. 81, $ 1, 12 Stat. 755;
Act of Apr. 20, 1871, ch. 22, $ 4, 17 Stat. 14. At all othertimes, it has remained a critical check on the Executive, ensuring that it does not detain individuals except in accord-ance with law. See

INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 301 (2001).All agree suspension of the writ has not occurred here.

Thus, it is undisputed that Hamdi was properly before anArticle III court to challenge his detention under 28 U. S. C.

$ 2241. Brief for Respondents 12. Further, all agree that$ 2241 and its companion provisions provide at least a skeletal outline of the procedures to be afforded a petitioner infederal habeas review. Most notably, $ 2243 provides that
"the person detained may, under oath, deny any of the factsset forth in the return or allege any other material facts,"
and $ 2246 allows the taking of evidence in habeas proceed-ings by deposition, affidavit, or interrogatories.

526 HAMDI v. RUMSFELD

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
The simple outline of $ 2241 makes clear both that Con-gress envisioned that habeas petitioners would have some

opportunity to present and rebut facts and that courts incases like this retain some ability to vary the ways in which
they do so as mandated by due process. The Governmentrecognizes the basic procedural protections required by the
habeas statute, id., at 37-38, but asks us to hold that, givenboth the flexibility of the habeas mechanism and the circumstances presented in this case, the presentation of the MobbsDeclaration to the habeas court completed the required factual development. It suggests two separate reasons for itsposition that no further process is due.

B
First, the Government urges the adoption of the FourthCircuit's holding below--that because it is "undisputed" that

Hamdi's seizure took place in a combat zone, the habeas de-termination can be made purely as a matter of law, with no
further hearing or factfinding necessary. This argument iseasily rejected. As the dissenters from the denial of rehearing en banc noted, the circumstances surrounding Hamdi'sseizure cannot in any way be characterized as "undisputed,"
as "those circumstances are neither conceded in fact, nor sus-ceptible to concession in law, because Hamdi has not been
permitted to speak for himself or even through counsel as tothose circumstances." 337 F. 3d, at 357 (opinion of Luttig,
J.); see also id., at 371-372 (opinion of Motz, J.). Further,the "facts" that constitute the alleged concession are insufficient to support Hamdi's detention. Under the definition ofenemy combatant that we accept today as falling within the
scope of Congress' authorization, Hamdi would need to be"part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or
coalition partners" and "engaged in an armed conflict againstthe United States" to justify his detention in the United
States for the duration of the relevant conflict. Brieffor Respondents 3. The habeas petition states only that

542US2 Unit: $U75 [11-01-06 18:26:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

527Cite as: 542 U. S. 507 (2004)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
"[w]hen seized by the United States Government, Mr. Hamdiresided in Afghanistan." App. 104. An assertion that one

resided in a country in which combat operations are takingplace is not a concession that one was "captured in a zone of
active combat" operations in a foreign theater of war, 316F. 3d, at 459 (emphasis added), and certainly is not a concession that one was "part of or supporting forces hostile to theUnited States or coalition partners" and "engaged in an
armed conflict against the United States." Accordingly, wereject any argument that Hamdi has made concessions that
eliminate any right to further process.

C
The Government's second argument requires closer consid-eration. This is the argument that further factual exploration is unwarranted and inappropriate in light of the ex-traordinary constitutional interests at stake. Under the
Government's most extreme rendition of this argument,"[r]espect for separation of powers and the limited institutional capabilities of courts in matters of military decision-making in connection with an ongoing conflict" ought to eliminate entirely any individual process, restricting the courtsto investigating only whether legal authorization exists for
the broader detention scheme. Brief for Respondents 26.At most, the Government argues, courts should review its
determination that a citizen is an enemy combatant undera very deferential "some evidence" standard.

Id., at 34("Under the some evidence standard, the focus is exclusively

on the factual basis supplied by the Executive to support itsown determination" (citing Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Institution at Walpole v. Hill, 472 U. S. 445, 455-457(1985) (explaining that the some evidence standard "does not
require" a "weighing of the evidence," but rather calls forassessing "whether there is any evidence in the record that
could support the conclusion"))). Under this review, a courtwould assume the accuracy of the Government's articulated

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
basis for Hamdi's detention, as set forth in the Mobbs Decla-ration, and assess only whether that articulated basis was a

legitimate one. Brief for Respondents 36; see also 316 F. 3d,at 473-474 (declining to address whether the "some evidence" standard should govern the adjudication of suchclaims, but noting that "[t]he factual averments in the
[Mobbs] affidavit, if accurate, are sufficient to confirm" the
legality of Hamdi's detention).In response, Hamdi emphasizes that this Court consistently has recognized that an individual challenging his de-tention may not be held at the will of the Executive without
recourse to some proceeding before a neutral tribunal to determine whether the Executive's asserted justifications for
that detention have basis in fact and warrant in law. See,
e. g., Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678, 690 (2001); Addington
v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418, 425-427 (1979). He argues that the
Fourth Circuit inappropriately "ceded power to the Executive during wartime to define the conduct for which a citizen
may be detained, judge whether that citizen has engaged in
the proscribed conduct, and imprison that citizen indefinitely," Brief for Petitioners 21, and that due process demands that he receive a hearing in which he may challenge
the Mobbs Declaration and adduce his own counterevidence.
The District Court, agreeing with Hamdi, apparently believed that the appropriate process would approach the process that accompanies a criminal trial. It therefore disapproved of the hearsay nature of the Mobbs Declaration and
anticipated quite extensive discovery of various military affairs. Anything less, it concluded, would not be "meaningful
judicial review." App. 291.

Both of these positions highlight legitimate concerns.
And both emphasize the tension that often exists between
the autonomy that the Government asserts is necessary in
order to pursue effectively a particular goal and the process
that a citizen contends he is due before he is deprived of a
constitutional right. The ordinary mechanism that we use

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
for balancing such serious competing interests, and for deter-mining the procedures that are necessary to ensure that a

citizen is not "deprived of life, liberty, or property, withoutdue process of law," U. S. Const., Amdt. 5, is the test that we
articulated in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319 (1976).See, e. g., Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 330-331 (1993); Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U. S. 113, 127-128 (1990); United States v.
Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 746 (1987); Schall v. Martin, 467 U. S.253, 274-275 (1984); Addington v. Texas, supra, at 425. Mathews dictates that the process due in any given instance isdetermined by weighing "the private interest that will be
affected by the official action" against the Government's as-serted interest, "including the function involved" and the
burdens the Government would face in providing greaterprocess. 424 U. S., at 335. The Mathews calculus then contemplates a judicious balancing of these concerns, throughan analysis of "the risk of an erroneous deprivation" of the
private interest if the process were reduced and the "proba-ble value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards." Ibid. We take each of these steps in turn.

1
It is beyond question that substantial interests lie on bothsides of the scale in this case. Hamdi's "private interest . . .

affected by the official action," ibid., is the most elementalof liberty interests--the interest in being free from physical
detention by one's own government. Foucha v. Louisiana,504 U. S. 71, 80 (1992) ("Freedom from bodily restraint has
always been at the core of the liberty protected by the DueProcess Clause from arbitrary governmental action"); see
also Parham v. J. R., 442 U. S. 584, 600 (1979) (noting the"substantial liberty interest in not being confined unnecessarily"). "In our society liberty is the norm," and detentionwithout trial "is the carefully limited exception." Salerno,
supra, at 755. "We have always been careful not to `mini-mize the importance and fundamental nature' of the individu542US2 Unit: $U75 [11-01-06 18:26:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
al's right to liberty," Foucha, supra, at 80 (quoting Salerno,
supra, at 750), and we will not do so today.

Nor is the weight on this side of the Mathews scale offsetby the circumstances of war or the accusation of treasonous

behavior, for "[i]t is clear that commitment for any purposeconstitutes a significant deprivation of liberty that requires
due process protection," Jones v. United States, 463 U. S.
354, 361 (1983) (emphasis added; internal quotation marksomitted), and at this stage in the

Mathews calculus, we consider the interest of the erroneously detained individual.
Carey v. Piphus, 435 U. S. 247, 259 (1978) ("Procedural due
process rules are meant to protect persons not from the deprivation, but from the mistaken or unjustified deprivation of
life, liberty, or property"); see also id., at 266 (noting "the
importance to organized society that procedural due process
be observed," and emphasizing that "the right to procedural
due process is `absolute' in the sense that it does not depend
upon the merits of a claimant's substantive assertions"). Indeed, as amicus briefs from media and relief organizations
emphasize, the risk of erroneous deprivation of a citizen's
liberty in the absence of sufficient process here is very real.
See Brief for AmeriCares et al. as Amici Curiae 13-22 (noting ways in which "[t]he nature of humanitarian relief work
and journalism present a significant risk of mistaken military
detentions"). Moreover, as critical as the Government's interest may be in detaining those who actually pose an immediate threat to the national security of the United States
during ongoing international conflict, history and common
sense teach us that an unchecked system of detention carries
the potential to become a means for oppression and abuse of
others who do not present that sort of threat. See Ex parte

cannot constitutionally justify the deprivation of a person'sphysical liberty," O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U. S. 563, 575
(1975), our starting point for the Mathews v. Eldridge analy-sis is unaltered by the allegations surrounding the particular
detainee or the organizations with which he is alleged tohave associated. We reaffirm today the fundamental nature
of a citizen's right to be free from involuntary confinementby his own government without due process of law, and we
weigh the opposing governmental interests against the cur-tailment of liberty that such confinement entails.

On the other side of the scale are the weighty and sensitivegovernmental interests in ensuring that those who have in

fact fought with the enemy during a war do not returnto battle against the United States. As discussed above,
supra, at 518, the law of war and the realities of combat mayrender such detentions both necessary and appropriate, and
our due process analysis need not blink at those realities.Without doubt, our Constitution recognizes that core strategic matters of warmaking belong in the hands of those whoare best positioned and most politically accountable for making them. Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U. S. 518, 530(1988) (noting the reluctance of the courts "to intrude upon
the authority of the Executive in military and national secu-rity affairs"); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343
U. S. 579, 587 (1952) (acknowledging "broad powers in mili-tary commanders engaged in day-to-day fighting in a theater
of war").The Government also argues at some length that its interests in reducing the process available to alleged enemy com-batants are heightened by the practical difficulties that
would accompany a system of trial-like process. In its view,military officers who are engaged in the serious work of wag542US2 Unit: $U75 [11-01-06 18:26:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

operations would both intrude on the sensitive secrets of na-tional defense and result in a futile search for evidence buried under the rubble of war. Brief for Respondents 46-49.To the extent that these burdens are triggered by heightened procedures, they are properly taken into account in ourdue process analysis.

Striking the proper constitutional balance here is of greatimportance to the Nation during this period of ongoing combat. But it is equally vital that our calculus not give shortshrift to the values that this country holds dear or to the
privilege that is American citizenship. It is during our mostchallenging and uncertain moments that our Nation's commitment to due process is most severely tested; and it is inthose times that we must preserve our commitment at home
to the principles for which we fight abroad. See Kennedy v.Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 164-165 (1963) ("The imperative necessity for safeguarding these rights to proce-dural due process under the gravest of emergencies has existed throughout our constitutional history, for it is then,under the pressing exigencies of crisis, that there is the
greatest temptation to dispense with fundamental constitu-tional guarantees which, it is feared, will inhibit governmental action"); see also United States v. Robel, 389 U. S. 258,264 (1967) ("It would indeed be ironic if, in the name of national defense, we would sanction the subversion of one ofthose liberties . . . which makes the defense of the Nation
worthwhile").With due recognition of these competing concerns, we believe that neither the process proposed by the Governmentnor the process apparently envisioned by the District Court
below strikes the proper constitutional balance when aUnited States citizen is detained in the United States as an
enemy combatant. That is, "the risk of an erroneous depri542US2 Unit: $U75 [11-01-06 18:26:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

vation" of a detainee's liberty interest is unacceptably highunder the Government's proposed rule, while some of the

"additional or substitute procedural safeguards" suggestedby the District Court are unwarranted in light of their limited "probable value" and the burdens they may impose onthe military in such cases.

Mathews, 424 U. S., at 335.
We therefore hold that a citizen-detainee seeking to challenge his classification as an enemy combatant must receivenotice of the factual basis for his classification, and a fair

opportunity to rebut the Government's factual assertions be-fore a neutral decisionmaker. See

Cleveland Bd. of Ed. v.
Loudermill, 470 U. S. 532, 542 (1985) ("An essential principle
of due process is that a deprivation of life, liberty, or property `be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case' " (quoting Mullane v.
Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U. S. 306, 313
(1950))); Concrete Pipe & Products of Cal., Inc. v. Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern Cal., 508 U. S.
602, 617 (1993) ("due process requires a `neutral and detached
judge in the first instance' " (quoting Ward v. Monroeville,
409 U. S. 57, 61-62 (1972))). "For more than a century the
central meaning of procedural due process has been clear:
`Parties whose rights are to be affected are entitled to be
heard; and in order that they may enjoy that right they must
first be notified.' It is equally fundamental that the right to
notice and an opportunity to be heard `must be granted at a
meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.' " Fuentes v.
Shevin, 407 U. S. 67, 80 (1972) (quoting Baldwin v. Hale, 1
Wall. 223, 233 (1864); Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U. S. 545, 552
(1965) (other citations omitted)). These essential constitutional promises may not be eroded.

At the same time, the exigencies of the circumstances may
demand that, aside from these core elements, enemycombatant proceedings may be tailored to alleviate their uncommon potential to burden the Executive at a time of ongoing military conflict. Hearsay, for example, may need to be

accepted as the most reliable available evidence from theGovernment in such a proceeding. Likewise, the Constitution would not be offended by a presumption in favor of theGovernment's evidence, so long as that presumption remained a rebuttable one and fair opportunity for rebuttalwere provided. Thus, once the Government puts forth credible evidence that the habeas petitioner meets the enemy-combatant criteria, the onus could shift to the petitioner to
rebut that evidence with more persuasive evidence that hefalls outside the criteria. A burden-shifting scheme of this
sort would meet the goal of ensuring that the errant tourist,embedded journalist, or local aid worker has a chance to
prove military error while giving due regard to the Execu-tive once it has put forth meaningful support for its conclusion that the detainee is in fact an enemy combatant. Inthe words of

Mathews, process of this sort would sufficientlyaddress the "risk of an erroneous deprivation" of a detainee's

liberty interest while eliminating certain procedures thathave questionable additional value in light of the burden on
the Government. 424 U. S., at 335.2We think it unlikely that this basic process will have the
dire impact on the central functions of warmaking that theGovernment forecasts. The parties agree that initial captures on the battlefield need not receive the process we havediscussed here; that process is due only when the determination is made to continue to hold those who have been seized.The Government has made clear in its briefing that documentation regarding battlefield detainees already is kept in theordinary course of military affairs.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
that military officers ought not have to wage war under thethreat of litigation lose much of their steam when factual

disputes at enemy-combatant hearings are limited to the al-leged combatant's acts. This focus meddles little, if at all,
in the strategy or conduct of war, inquiring only into theappropriateness of continuing to detain an individual claimed
to have taken up arms against the United States. While weaccord the greatest respect and consideration to the judgments of military authorities in matters relating to the actualprosecution of a war, and recognize that the scope of that
discretion necessarily is wide, it does not infringe on the corerole of the military for the courts to exercise their own timehonored and constitutionally mandated roles of reviewingand resolving claims like those presented here. Cf.

Kore-matsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214, 233-234 (1944) (Murphy, J., dissenting) ("[L]ike other claims conflicting with theasserted constitutional rights of the individual, the military
claim must subject itself to the judicial process of havingits reasonableness determined and its conflicts with other
interests reconciled"); Sterling v. Constantin, 287 U. S. 378,401 (1932) ("What are the allowable limits of military discretion, and whether or not they have been overstepped in aparticular case, are judicial questions").

In sum, while the full protections that accompany chal-lenges to detentions in other settings may prove unworkable and inappropriate in the enemy-combatant setting, thethreats to military operations posed by a basic system of
independent review are not so weighty as to trump a citizen'score rights to challenge meaningfully the Government's case
and to be heard by an impartial adjudicator.

D
In so holding, we necessarily reject the Government's as-sertion that separation of powers principles mandate a heavily circumscribed role for the courts in such circumstances.Indeed, the position that the courts must forgo any examina542US2 Unit: $U75 [11-01-06 18:26:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tion of the individual case and focus exclusively on the legal-ity of the broader detention scheme cannot be mandated by

any reasonable view of separation of powers, as this ap-proach serves only to

condense power into a single branch
of government. We have long since made clear that a stateof war is not a blank check for the President when it comes

to the rights of the Nation's citizens. Youngstown Sheet &
Tube, 343 U. S., at 587. Whatever power the United StatesConstitution envisions for the Executive in its exchanges

with other nations or with enemy organizations in times ofconflict, it most assuredly envisions a role for all three
branches when individual liberties are at stake. Mistretta
v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 380 (1989) (it was "the central
judgment of the Framers of the Constitution that, within our
political scheme, the separation of governmental powers into
three coordinate Branches is essential to the preservation of
liberty"); Home Building & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290
U. S. 398, 426 (1934) (The war power "is a power to wage
war successfully, and thus it permits the harnessing of the
entire energies of the people in a supreme cooperative effort
to preserve the nation. But even the war power does not
remove constitutional limitations safeguarding essential liberties"). Likewise, we have made clear that, unless Congress acts to suspend it, the Great Writ of habeas corpus
allows the Judicial Branch to play a necessary role in maintaining this delicate balance of governance, serving as an
important judicial check on the Executive's discretion in the
realm of detentions. See St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 301 ("At its
historical core, the writ of habeas corpus has served as a
means of reviewing the legality of Executive detention, and
it is in that context that its protections have been strongest"). Thus, while we do not question that our due process
assessment must pay keen attention to the particular burdens faced by the Executive in the context of military action,
it would turn our system of checks and balances on its head
to suggest that a citizen could not make his way to court

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
with a challenge to the factual basis for his detention by hisGovernment, simply because the Executive opposes making

available such a challenge. Absent suspension of the writby Congress, a citizen detained as an enemy combatant is
entitled to this process.Because we conclude that due process demands some system for a citizen-detainee to refute his classification, the proposed "some evidence" standard is inadequate. Any processin which the Executive's factual assertions go wholly unchallenged or are simply presumed correct without any opportu-nity for the alleged combatant to demonstrate otherwise falls
constitutionally short. As the Government itself has recognized, we have utilized the "some evidence" standard in the
past as a standard of review, not as a standard of proof.
Brief for Respondents 35. That is, it primarily has been employed by courts in examining an administrative record developed after an adversarial proceeding--one with process
at least of the sort that we today hold is constitutionally
mandated in the citizen enemy-combatant setting. See, e. g.,
St. Cyr, supra; Hill, 472 U. S., at 455-457. This standard
therefore is ill suited to the situation in which a habeas petitioner has received no prior proceedings before any tribunal
and had no prior opportunity to rebut the Executive's factual
assertions before a neutral decisionmaker.

Today we are faced only with such a case. Aside from
unspecified "screening" processes, Brief for Respondents
3-4, and military interrogations in which the Government
suggests Hamdi could have contested his classification, Tr. of
Oral Arg. 40, 42, Hamdi has received no process. An interrogation by one's captor, however effective an intelligencegathering tool, hardly constitutes a constitutionally adequate
factfinding before a neutral decisionmaker. Compare Brief

environment," and noting that military interrogations require a controlled "interrogation dynamic" and "a relationship of trust and dependency" and are "a critical source" of

"timely and effective intelligence") with Concrete Pipe, 508U. S., at 617-618 ("[O]ne is entitled as a matter of due process

of law to an adjudicator who is not in a situation which wouldoffer a possible temptation to the average man as a judge . . .

in the controversy to be decided is, of course, the generalrule."

Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510, 522 (1927). Plainly,
the "process" Hamdi has received is not that to which he isentitled under the Due Process Clause.

There remains the possibility that the standards we have
articulated could be met by an appropriately authorized and
properly constituted military tribunal. Indeed, it is notable
that military regulations already provide for such process in
related instances, dictating that tribunals be made available
to determine the status of enemy detainees who assert
prisoner-of-war status under the Geneva Convention. See
Headquarters Depts. of Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine
Corps, Enemy Prisoners of War, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees and Other Detainees, Army Regulation 190-8,
ch. 1, $ 1-6 (1997). In the absence of such process, however,
a court that receives a petition for a writ of habeas corpus
from an alleged enemy combatant must itself ensure that the
minimum requirements of due process are achieved. Both
courts below recognized as much, focusing their energies on
the question of whether Hamdi was due an opportunity to
rebut the Government's case against him. The Government,
too, proceeded on this assumption, presenting its affidavit
and then seeking that it be evaluated under a deferential
standard of review based on burdens that it alleged would
accompany any greater process. As we have discussed, a
habeas court in a case such as this may accept affidavit evidence like that contained in the Mobbs Declaration, so long
as it also permits the alleged combatant to present his own
factual case to rebut the Government's return. We antici542US2 Unit: $U75 [11-01-06 18:26:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

pate that a District Court would proceed with the cautionthat we have indicated is necessary in this setting, engaging

in a factfinding process that is both prudent and incremental.We have no reason to doubt that courts faced with these
sensitive matters will pay proper heed both to the mattersof national security that might arise in an individual case
and to the constitutional limitations safeguarding essentialliberties that remain vibrant even in times of security

Hamdi asks us to hold that the Fourth Circuit also erredby denying him immediate access to counsel upon his detention and by disposing of the case without permitting him tomeet with an attorney. Brief for Petitioners 19. Since our
grant of certiorari in this case, Hamdi has been appointedcounsel, with whom he has met for consultation purposes on
several occasions, and with whom he is now being grantedunmonitored meetings. He unquestionably has the right to
access to counsel in connection with the proceedings on re-mand. No further consideration of this issue is necessary at
this stage of the case. * * *

further proceedings. It is so ordered.

judgment.

According to Yaser Hamdi's petition for writ of habeas cor-pus, brought on his behalf by his father, the Government of

the United States is detaining him, an American citizen onAmerican soil, with the explanation that he was seized on
the field of battle in Afghanistan, having been on the enemyside. It is undisputed that the Government has not charged

him with espionage, treason, or any other crime under do-mestic law. It is likewise undisputed that for one year and

nine months, on the basis of an Executive designation ofHamdi as an "enemy combatant," the Government denied
him the right to send or receive any communication beyondthe prison where he was held and, in particular, denied him
access to counsel to represent him.1 The Government as-serts a right to hold Hamdi under these conditions indefinitely, that is, until the Government determines that theUnited States is no longer threatened by the terrorism exemplified in the attacks of September 11, 2001.In these proceedings on Hamdi's petition, he seeks to challenge the facts claimed by the Government as the basis forholding him as an enemy combatant. And in this Court he
presses the distinct argument that the Government's claim,even if true, would not implicate any authority for holding
him that would satisfy 18 U. S. C. $ 4001(a) (Non-DetentionAct), which bars imprisonment or detention of a citizen "except pursuant to an Act of Congress."The Government responds that Hamdi's incommunicado
imprisonment as an enemy combatant seized on the field ofbattle falls within the President's power as Commander in
Chief under the laws and usages of war, and is in any eventauthorized by two statutes. Accordingly, the Government
contends that Hamdi has no basis for any challenge by peti-tion for habeas except to his own status as an enemy combatant; and even that challenge may go no further thanto enquire whether "some evidence" supports Hamdi's
designation, see Brief for Respondents 34-36; if there is"some evidence," Hamdi should remain locked up at the discretion of the Executive. At the argument of this case, infact, the Government went further and suggested that as
long as a prisoner could challenge his enemy combatant des1 The Government has since February 2004 permitted Hamdi to consult
with counsel as a matter of policy, but does not concede that it has an
obligation to allow this. Brief for Respondents 9, 39-46.

ignation when responding to interrogation during incommu-nicado detention he was accorded sufficient process to support his designation as an enemy combatant. See Tr. ofOral Arg. 40; id., at 42 ("[H]e has an opportunity to explain it
in his own words" "[d]uring interrogation"). Since on eitherview judicial enquiry so limited would be virtually worthless
as a way to contest detention, the Government's concessionof jurisdiction to hear Hamdi's habeas claim is more theoretical than practical, leaving the assertion of Executive author-ity close to unconditional.

The plurality rejects any such limit on the exercise of ha-beas jurisdiction and so far I agree with its opinion. The
plurality does, however, accept the Government's positionthat if Hamdi's designation as an enemy combatant is correct, his detention (at least as to some period) is authorizedby an Act of Congress as required by $ 4001(a), that is, by
the Authorization for Use of Military Force, 115 Stat. 224(hereinafter Force Resolution).

Ante, at 517-521. Here,I disagree and respectfully dissent. The Government has

failed to demonstrate that the Force Resolution authorizesthe detention complained of here even on the facts the Government claims. If the Government raises nothing furtherthan the record now shows, the Non-Detention Act entitles
Hamdi to be released. I

The Government's first response to Hamdi's claim thatholding him violates $ 4001(a), prohibiting detention of citizens "except pursuant to an Act of Congress," is that thestatute does not even apply to military wartime detentions,
being beyond the sphere of domestic criminal law. Next,the Government says that even if that statute does apply,
two Acts of Congress provide the authority $ 4001(a) de-mands: a general authorization to the Department of Defense
to pay for detaining "prisoners of war" and "similar" per-sons, 10 U. S. C. $ 956(5), and the Force Resolution, passed
after the attacks of 2001. At the same time, the Govern542US2 Unit: $U75 [11-01-06 18:26:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ment argues that in detaining Hamdi in the manner de-scribed, the President is in any event acting as Commander

in Chief under Article II of the Constitution, which bringswith it the right to invoke authority under the accepted customary rules for waging war. On the record in front of us,the Government has not made out a case on any theory.

II
The threshold issue is how broadly or narrowly to read theNon-Detention Act, the tone of which is severe: "No citizen

shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the UnitedStates except pursuant to an Act of Congress." 18 U. S. C.

$ 4001(a). Should the severity of the Act be relieved whenthe Government's stated factual justification for incommunicado detention is a war on terrorism, so that the Governmentmay be said to act "pursuant" to congressional terms that
fall short of explicit authority to imprison individuals?With one possible though important qualification, see

infra,at 548-549, the answer has to be no. For a number of reasons, the prohibition within $ 4001(a) has to be read broadlyto accord the statute a long reach and to impose a burden of
justification on the Government.First, the circumstances in which the Act was adopted
point the way to this interpretation. The provision super-seded a cold-war statute, the Emergency Detention Act of
1950 (formerly 50 U. S. C. $ 811 et seq. (1970 ed.)), which hadauthorized the Attorney General, in time of emergency, to
detain anyone reasonably thought likely to engage in espio-nage or sabotage. That statute was repealed in 1971 out of
fear that it could authorize a repetition of the World War IIinternment of citizens of Japanese ancestry; Congress meant
to preclude another episode like the one described in Korematsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214 (1944). See H. R. Rep.No. 92-116, pp. 2, 4-5 (1971). While Congress might simply

have struck the 1950 statute, in considering the repealer thepoint was made that the existing statute provided some ex542US2 Unit: $U75 [11-01-06 18:26:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

543Cite as: 542 U. S. 507 (2004)
Opinion of Souter, J.
press procedural protection, without which the Executivewould seem to be subject to no statutory limits protecting

individual liberty. See id., at 5 (mere repeal "might leavecitizens subject to arbitrary executive action, with no clear
demarcation of the limits of executive authority"); 117 Cong.Rec. 31544 (1971) (Emergency Detention Act "remains as the
only existing barrier against the future exercise of executive
power which resulted in" the Japanese internment); cf. id.,at 31548 (in the absence of further procedural provisions,

even $ 4001(a) "will virtually leave us stripped naked againstthe great power . . . which the President has"). It was in
these circumstances that a proposed limit on Executive action was expanded to the inclusive scope of $ 4001(a) as
enacted.

The fact that Congress intended to guard against a repetition of the World War II internments when it repealed the
1950 statute and gave us $ 4001(a) provides a powerful reason
to think that $ 4001(a) was meant to require clear congressional authorization before any citizen can be placed in a cell.
It is not merely that the legislative history shows that

$ 4001(a) was thought necessary in anticipation of times just
like the present, in which the safety of the country is threatened. To appreciate what is most significant, one must only
recall that the internments of the 1940s were accomplished
by Executive action. Although an Act of Congress ratified
and confirmed an Executive order authorizing the military
to exclude individuals from defined areas and to accommodate those it might remove, see Ex parte Endo, 323 U. S.
283, 285-288 (1944), the statute said nothing whatever about
the detention of those who might be removed, id., at 300-301;
internment camps were creatures of the Executive, and confinement in them rested on assertion of Executive authority,
see id., at 287-293. When, therefore, Congress repealed the
1950 Act and adopted $ 4001(a) for the purpose of avoiding another Korematsu, it intended to preclude reliance on
vague congressional authority (for example, providing "ac542US2 Unit: $U75 [11-01-06 18:26:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN
544 HAMDI v. RUMSFELD

Opinion of Souter, J.
commodations" for those subject to removal) as authority fordetention or imprisonment at the discretion of the Executive

(maintaining detention camps of American citizens, for exam-ple). In requiring that any Executive detention be "pursuant to an Act of Congress," then, Congress necessarily meantto require a congressional enactment that clearly authorized
detention or imprisonment.

Second, when Congress passed $ 4001(a) it was acting inlight of an interpretive regime that subjected enactments

limiting liberty in wartime to the requirement of a clearstatement and it presumably intended $ 4001(a) to be read
accordingly. This need for clarity was unmistakably ex-pressed in

Ex parte Endo, supra, decided the same day as
Korematsu. Endo began with a petition for habeas corpusby an interned citizen claiming to be loyal and law-abiding

and thus "unlawfully detained." 323 U. S., at 294. Thepetitioner was held entitled to habeas relief in an opinion
that set out this principle for scrutinizing wartime statutesin derogation of customary liberty:

"In interpreting a wartime measure we must assumethat [its] purpose was to allow for the greatest possible
accommodation between . . . liberties and the exigenciesof war. We must assume, when asked to find implied
powers in a grant of legislative or executive authority,
that the law makers intended to place no greater re-straint on the citizen than was clearly and unmistakably

indicated by the language they used." Id., at 300.
Congress's understanding of the need for clear authority be-fore citizens are kept detained is itself therefore clear, and

$ 4001(a) must be read to have teeth in its demand for congressional authorization.

Finally, even if history had spared us the cautionary example of the internments in World War II, even if there had
been no Korematsu, and Endo had set out no principle of
statutory interpretation, there would be a compelling reason

545Cite as: 542 U. S. 507 (2004)
Opinion of Souter, J.
to read $ 4001(a) to demand manifest authority to detain be-fore detention is authorized. The defining character of

American constitutional government is its constant tensionbetween security and liberty, serving both by partial helpings of each. In a government of separated powers, decid-ing finally on what is a reasonable degree of guaranteed liberty whether in peace or war (or some condition in between)is not well entrusted to the Executive Branch of Government, whose particular responsibility is to maintain security.For reasons of inescapable human nature, the branch of the
Government asked to counter a serious threat is not thebranch on which to rest the Nation's entire reliance in striking the balance between the will to win and the cost in lib-erty on the way to victory; the responsibility for security
will naturally amplify the claim that security legitimatelyraises. A reasonable balance is more likely to be reached on
the judgment of a different branch, just as Madison said inremarking that "the constant aim is to divide and arrange
the several offices in such a manner as that each may be acheck on the other--that the private interest of every individual may be a sentinel over the public rights." The Fed-eralist No. 51, p. 349 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). Hence the need
for an assessment by Congress before citizens are subject tolockup, and likewise the need for a clearly expressed congressional resolution of the competing claims.

III
Under this principle of reading $ 4001(a) robustly to re-quire a clear statement of authorization to detain, none

of the Government's arguments suffices to justify Hamdi'sdetention.

A
First, there is the argument that $ 4001(a) does not evenapply to wartime military detentions, a position resting on

the placement of $ 4001(a) in Title 18 of the United StatesCode, the gathering of federal criminal law. The text of the

Opinion of Souter, J.
statute does not, however, so limit its reach, and the legisla-tive history of the provision shows its placement in Title 18

was not meant to render the statute more restricted than itsterms. The draft of what is now $ 4001(a) as contained in
the original bill prohibited only imprisonment unauthorizedby Title 18. See H. R. Rep. No. 92-116, at 4. In response
to the Department of Justice's objection that the original
draft seemed to assume wrongly that all provisions for thedetention of convicted persons would be contained in Title

18, the provision was amended by replacing a reference tothat title with the reference to an "Act of Congress."

Id.,
at 3. The Committee on the Judiciary, discussing this
change, stated that "[limiting] detention of citizens . . . to
situations in which . . . an Act of Congres[s] exists" would
"assure that no detention camps can be established without at least the acquiescence of the Congress." Id., at 5.
See also supra, at 542-544. This understanding, that the
amended bill would sweep beyond imprisonment for crime
and apply to Executive detention in furtherance of wartime
security, was emphasized in an extended debate. Representative Ichord, chairman of the House Internal Security
Committee and an opponent of the bill, feared that the redrafted statute would "deprive the President of his emergency powers and his most effective means of coping with
sabotage and espionage agents in war-related crises." 117
Cong. Rec., at 31542. Representative Railsback, the bill's
sponsor, spoke of the bill in absolute terms: "[I]n order to
prohibit arbitrary executive action, [the bill] assures that no
detention of citizens can be undertaken by the Executive
without the prior consent of the Congress." Id., at 31551.
This legislative history indicates that Congress was aware
that $ 4001(a) would limit the Executive's power to detain
citizens in wartime to protect national security, and it is fair
to say that the prohibition was thus intended to extend not
only to the exercise of power to vindicate the interests underlying domestic criminal law, but to statutorily unauthor542US2 Unit: $U75 [11-01-06 18:26:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ized detention by the Executive for reasons of security inwartime, just as Hamdi claims.

Next, there is the Government's claim, accepted by theplurality, that the terms of the Force Resolution are adequate to authorize detention of an enemy combatant underthe circumstances described,

3 a claim the Government fails

to support sufficiently to satisfy $ 4001(a) as read to requirea clear statement of authority to detain. Since the Force

Resolution was adopted one week after the attacks of Sep-tember 11, 2001, it naturally speaks with some generality,
but its focus is clear, and that is on the use of military power.It is fairly read to authorize the use of armies and weapons,
whether against other armies or individual terrorists. But,like the statute discussed in

Endo, it never so much as usesthe word detention, and there is no reason to think Congress

might have perceived any need to augment Executive powerto deal with dangerous citizens within the United States,
given the well-stocked statutory arsenal of defined criminaloffenses covering the gamut of actions that a citizen sympathetic to terrorists might commit. See, e. g., 18 U. S. C.

2 Nor is it possible to distinguish between civilian and military authority
to detain based on the congressional object of avoiding another Korematsu
v. United States, 323 U. S. 214 (1944). See Brief for Respondents 21 (arguing that military detentions are exempt). Although a civilian agency
authorized by Executive order ran the detention camps, the relocation and
detention of American citizens was ordered by the military under authority of the President as Commander in Chief. See Ex parte Endo, 323
U. S. 283, 285-288 (1944). The World War II internment was thus ordered
under the same Presidential power invoked here and the intent to bar a
repetition goes to the action taken and authority claimed here.

3 As noted, supra, at 541, the Government argues that a required Act

of Congress is to be found in a statutory authorization to spend money
appropriated for the care of prisoners of war and of other, similar prisoners, 10 U. S. C. $ 956(5). It is enough to say that this statute is an authorization to spend money if there are prisoners, not an authorization to imprison anyone to provide the occasion for spending money.

C
Even so, there is one argument for treating the Force Res-olution as sufficiently clear to authorize detention of a citizen

consistently with $ 4001(a). Assuming the argument to besound, however, the Government is in no position to claim
its advantage.Because the Force Resolution authorizes the use of military force in acts of war by the United States, the argumentgoes, it is reasonably clear that the military and its Commander in Chief are authorized to deal with enemy belliger-ents according to the treaties and customs known collectively
as the laws of war. Brief for Respondents 20- 22; see ante,at 517-521 (accepting this argument). Accordingly, the
United States may detain captured enemies, and Ex parte
Quirin, 317 U. S. 1 (1942), may perhaps be claimed for theproposition that the American citizenship of such a captive

does not as such limit the Government's power to deal with

4 Even a brief examination of the reported cases in which the Government has chosen to proceed criminally against those who aided the Taliban
shows the Government has found no shortage of offenses to allege. See
United States v. Lindh, 212 F. Supp. 2d 541, 547 (ED Va. 2002); United
States v. Khan, 309 F. Supp. 2d 789, 796 (ED Va. 2004).

him under the usages of war. Id., at 31, 37-38. Thus, theGovernment here repeatedly argues that Hamdi's detention

amounts to nothing more than customary detention of a cap-tive taken on the field of battle: if the usages of war are fairly
authorized by the Force Resolution, Hamdi's detention is au-thorized for purposes of $ 4001(a).

There is no need, however, to address the merits of such
an argument in all possible circumstances. For now it isenough to recognize that the Government's stated legal position in its campaign against the Taliban (among whom Hamdiwas allegedly captured) is apparently at odds with its claim
here to be acting in accordance with customary law of war
and hence to be within the terms of the Force Resolution in
its detention of Hamdi. In a statement of its legal position
cited in its brief, the Government says that "the Geneva Convention applies to the Taliban detainees." Office of the
White House Press Secretary, Fact Sheet, Status of Detainees at Guantanamo (Feb. 7, 2002), www.whitehouse.gov/
news/releases/2002/02/20020207-13.html (as visited June 18,
2004, and available in Clerk of Court's case file) (hereinafter
White House Press Release) (cited in Brief for Respondents
24, n. 9). Hamdi presumably is such a detainee, since according to the Government's own account, he was taken
bearing arms on the Taliban side of a field of battle in Afghanistan. He would therefore seem to qualify for treatment as a prisoner of war under the Third Geneva Convention, to which the United States is a party. Article 4 of the
Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, [1955] 6 U. S. T. 3316, 3320,
T. I. A. S. No. 3364.

By holding him incommunicado, however, the Government
obviously has not been treating him as a prisoner of war, and
in fact the Government claims that no Taliban detainee is
entitled to prisoner of war status. See Brief for Respondents 24; White House Press Release. This treatment appears to be a violation of the Geneva Convention provision

542US2 Unit: $U75 [11-01-06 18:26:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN
550 HAMDI v. RUMSFELD

Opinion of Souter, J.
that even in cases of doubt, captives are entitled to betreated as prisoners of war "until such time as their status

has been determined by a competent tribunal." Art. 5, 6U. S. T., at 3324. The Government answers that the President's determination that Taliban detainees do not qualify asprisoners of war is conclusive as to Hamdi's status and removes any doubt that would trigger application of the Convention's tribunal requirement. See Brief for Respondents24. But reliance on this categorical pronouncement to settle

doubt is apparently at odds with the military regulation,Enemy Prisoners of War, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees and Other Detainees, Army Regulation 190-8, ch. 1,

$$ 1-5, 1-6 (1997), adopted to implement the Geneva Convention, and setting out a detailed procedure for a military tribunal to determine an individual's status. See, e. g., id.,

$ 1-6 ("A competent tribunal shall be composed of three commissioned officers"; a "written record shall be made of proceedings"; "[p]roceedings shall be open" with certain exceptions; "[p]ersons whose status is to be determined shall be
advised of their rights at the beginning of their hearings,"
"allowed to attend all open sessions," "allowed to call
witnesses if reasonably available, and to question those
witnesses called by the Tribunal," and to "have a right
to testify"; and a tribunal shall determine status by a
"[p]reponderance of evidence"). One of the types of doubt
these tribunals are meant to settle is whether a given individual may be, as Hamdi says he is, an "[i]nnocent civilian
who should be immediately returned to his home or released." Id., $ 1-6e(10)(c). The regulation, jointly promulgated by the Headquarters of the Departments of the Army,
Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, provides that "[p]ersons
who have been determined by a competent tribunal not to
be entitled to prisoner of war status may not be executed,
imprisoned, or otherwise penalized without further proceedings to determine what acts they have committed and what
penalty should be imposed." Id., $ 1-6g. The regulation

Opinion of Souter, J.
also incorporates the Geneva Convention's presumption thatin cases of doubt, "persons shall enjoy the protection of

the . . . Convention until such time as their status has beendetermined by a competent tribunal." Id., $ 1-6a. Thus,
there is reason to question whether the United States is act-ing in accordance with the laws of war it claims as authority.

Whether, or to what degree, the Government is in factviolating the Geneva Convention and is thus acting outside
the customary usages of war are not matters I can resolveat this point. What I can say, though, is that the Government has not made out its claim that in detaining Hamdi inthe manner described, it is acting in accord with the laws of
war authorized to be applied against citizens by the ForceResolution. I conclude accordingly that the Government
has failed to support the position that the Force Resolutionauthorizes the described detention of Hamdi for purposes
of $ 4001(a).It is worth adding a further reason for requiring the Government to bear the burden of clearly justifying its claimto be exercising recognized war powers before declaring

$ 4001(a) satisfied. Thirty-eight days after adopting theForce Resolution, Congress passed the statute entitled Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing AppropriateTools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of
2001 (USA PATRIOT ACT), 115 Stat. 272; that Act author-ized the detention of alien terrorists for no more than seven
days in the absence of criminal charges or deportation pro-ceedings, 8 U. S. C. $ 1226a(a)(5) (2000 ed., Supp. I). It is
very difficult to believe that the same Congress that care-fully circumscribed Executive power over alien terrorists on
home soil would not have meant to require the Governmentto justify clearly its detention of an American citizen held on
home soil incommunicado. D

Since the Government has given no reason either to deflectthe application of $ 4001(a) or to hold it to be satisfied, I need

542US2 Unit: $U75 [11-01-06 18:26:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN
552 HAMDI v. RUMSFELD

Opinion of Souter, J.
to go no further; the Government hints of a constitutional
challenge to the statute, but it presents none here. I will,
however, stray across the line between statutory and constitutional territory just far enough to note the weakness of the
Government's mixed claim of inherent, extrastatutory authority under a combination of Article II of the Constitution
and the usages of war. It is in fact in this connection that
the Government developed its argument that the exercise
of war powers justifies the detention, and what I have just
said about its inadequacy applies here as well. Beyond
that, it is instructive to recall Justice Jackson's observation
that the President is not Commander in Chief of the country, only of the military. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v.
Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 643-644 (1952) (concurring opinion);
see also id., at 637-638 (Presidential authority is "at its lowest ebb" where the President acts contrary to congressional
will).

There may be room for one qualification to Justice Jackson's statement, however: in a moment of genuine emergency, when the Government must act with no time for deliberation, the Executive may be able to detain a citizen if there
is reason to fear he is an imminent threat to the safety of
the Nation and its people (though I doubt there is any want
of statutory authority, see supra, at 547-548). This case,
however, does not present that question, because an emergency power of necessity must at least be limited by the
emergency; Hamdi has been locked up for over two years.
Cf. Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, 127 (1866) (martial law justified only by "actual and present" necessity as in a genuine
invasion that closes civilian courts).

Whether insisting on the careful scrutiny of emergency
claims or on a vigorous reading of $ 4001(a), we are heirs to
a tradition given voice 800 years ago by Magna Carta, which,
on the barons' insistence, confined executive power by "the
law of the land."

Because I find Hamdi's detention forbidden by $ 4001(a)and unauthorized by the Force Resolution, I would not reach

any questions of what process he may be due in litigatingdisputed issues in a proceeding under the habeas statute or
prior to the habeas enquiry itself. For me, it suffices thatthe Government has failed to justify holding him in the absence of a further Act of Congress, criminal charges, a show-ing that the detention conforms to the laws of war, or a
demonstration that $ 4001(a) is unconstitutional. I wouldtherefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and
remand for proceedings consistent with this view.Since this disposition does not command a majority of the
Court, however, the need to give practical effect to the con-clusions of eight Members of the Court rejecting the Government's position calls for me to join with the plurality in or-dering remand on terms closest to those I would impose.
See Screws v. United States, 325 U. S. 91, 134 (1945) (Rut-ledge, J., concurring in result). Although I think litigation
of Hamdi's status as an enemy combatant is unnecessary, theterms of the plurality's remand will allow Hamdi to offer
evidence that he is not an enemy combatant, and he shouldat the least have the benefit of that opportunity.

It should go without saying that in joining with the plural-ity to produce a judgment, I do not adopt the plurality's resolution of constitutional issues that I would not reach. It isnot that I could disagree with the plurality's determinations
(given the plurality's view of the Force Resolution) thatsomeone in Hamdi's position is entitled at a minimum to notice of the Government's claimed factual basis for holdinghim, and to a fair chance to rebut it before a neutral
decisionmaker, see ante, at 533; nor, of course, could I dis-agree with the plurality's affirmation of Hamdi's right to
counsel, see ante, at 539. On the other hand, I do not meanto imply agreement that the Government could claim an evidentiary presumption casting the burden of rebuttal on

Petitioner Yaser Hamdi, a presumed American citizen, hasbeen imprisoned without charge or hearing in the Norfolk
and Charleston Naval Brigs for more than two years, on theallegation that he is an enemy combatant who bore arms
against his country for the Taliban. His father claims to thecontrary, that he is an inexperienced aid worker caught in
the wrong place at the wrong time. This case brings intoconflict the competing demands of national security and our
citizens' constitutional right to personal liberty. Although Ishare the plurality's evident unease as it seeks to reconcile
the two, I do not agree with its resolution.Where the Government accuses a citizen of waging war
against it, our constitutional tradition has been to prose-cute him in federal court for treason or some other crime.
Where the exigencies of war prevent that, the Constitution'sSuspension Clause, Art. I, $ 9, cl. 2, allows Congress to relax
the usual protections temporarily. Absent suspension, how-ever, the Executive's assertion of military exigency has not
been thought sufficient to permit detention without charge.No one contends that the congressional Authorization for
Use of Military Force, on which the Government relies tojustify its actions here, is an implementation of the Suspension Clause. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgmentbelow.

imprisonment at the will of the Executive. Blackstonestated this principle clearly:

"Of great importance to the public is the preservationof this personal liberty: for if once it were left in the
power of any, the highest, magistrate to imprison arbi-trarily whomever he or his officers thought proper . . .
there would soon be an end of all other rights andimmunities. . . . To bereave a man of life, or by violence
to confiscate his estate, without accusation or trial,would be so gross and notorious an act of despotism, as
must at once convey the alarm of tyranny throughoutthe whole kingdom. But confinement of the person, by
secretly hurrying him to gaol, where his sufferings are
unknown or forgotten; is a less public, a less striking,and therefore a more dangerous engine of arbitrary

government. . . ."To make imprisonment lawful, it must either be, by
process from the courts of judicature, or by warrantfrom some legal officer, having authority to commit to
prison; which warrant must be in writing, under thehand and seal of the magistrate, and express the causes
of the commitment, in order to be examined into (if nec-essary) upon a

habeas corpus. If there be no cause expressed, the gaoler is not bound to detain the prisoner.
For the law judges in this respect, . . . that it is unrea-sonable to send a prisoner, and not to signify withal the

crimes alleged against him." 1 W. Blackstone, Com-mentaries on the Laws of England 131-133 (1765) (hereinafter Blackstone).
These words were well known to the Founders. Hamilton
quoted from this very passage in The Federalist No. 84,
p. 444 (G. Carey & J. McClellan eds. 2001). The two ideas
central to Blackstone's understanding--due process as the
right secured, and habeas corpus as the instrument by which
due process could be insisted upon by a citizen illegally im542US2 Unit: $U75 [11-01-06 18:26:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

prisoned--found expression in the Constitution's Due Proc-ess and Suspension Clauses. See Amdt. 5; Art. I, $ 9, cl. 2.

The gist of the Due Process Clause, as understood at thefounding and since, was to force the Government to follow
those common-law procedures traditionally deemed neces-sary before depriving a person of life, liberty, or property.
When a citizen was deprived of liberty because of alleged
criminal conduct, those procedures typically required com-mittal by a magistrate followed by indictment and trial.

See, e. g., 2 & 3 Philip & Mary, ch. 10 (1555); 3 J. Story, Com-mentaries on the Constitution of the United States $ 1783,
p. 661 (1833) (hereinafter Story) (equating "due process of
law" with "due presentment or indictment, and being
brought in to answer thereto by due process of the common
law"). The Due Process Clause "in effect affirms the right
of trial according to the process and proceedings of the common law." Ibid. See also T. Cooley, General Principles of
Constitutional Law 224 (1880) ("When life and liberty are in
question, there must in every instance be judicial proceedings; and that requirement implies an accusation, a hearing
before an impartial tribunal, with proper jurisdiction, and a
conviction and judgment before the punishment can be inflicted" (internal quotation marks omitted)).

To be sure, certain types of permissible noncriminal detention--that is, those not dependent upon the contention
that the citizen had committed a criminal act--did not require the protections of criminal procedure. However, these
fell into a limited number of well-recognized exceptions--
civil commitment of the mentally ill, for example, and temporary detention in quarantine of the infectious. See Opinion
on the Writ of Habeas Corpus, Wilm. 77, 88-92, 97 Eng.
Rep. 29, 36-37 (H. L. 1758) (Wilmot, J.). It is unthinkable
that the Executive could render otherwise criminal grounds
for detention noncriminal merely by disclaiming an intent
to prosecute, or by asserting that it was incapacitating
dangerous offenders rather than punishing wrongdoing.

Scalia, J., dissenting
Cf. Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346, 358 (1997) ("A findingof dangerousness, standing alone, is ordinarily not a sufficient ground upon which to justify indefinite involuntarycommitment").

These due process rights have historically been vindicatedby the writ of habeas corpus. In England before the founding, the writ developed into a tool for challenging executive
confinement. It was not always effective. For example, in
Darnel's Case, 3 How. St. Tr. 1 (K. B. 1627), King Charles I
detained without charge several individuals for failing to as-sist England's war against France and Spain. The prisoners

sought writs of habeas corpus, arguing that without specific
charges, "imprisonment shall not continue on for a time, but
for ever; and the subjects of this kingdom may be restrained
of their liberties perpetually." Id., at 8. The Attorney
General replied that the Crown's interest in protecting the
realm justified imprisonment in "a matter of state . . . not
ripe nor timely" for the ordinary process of accusation and
trial. Id., at 37. The court denied relief, producing widespread outrage, and Parliament responded with the Petition
of Right, accepted by the King in 1628, which expressly prohibited imprisonment without formal charges, see 3 Car. 1,
ch. 1, $$ 5, 10.

The struggle between subject and Crown continued, and
culminated in the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, 31 Car. 2, ch. 2,
described by Blackstone as a "second magna carta, and stable bulwark of our liberties." 1 Blackstone 133. The Act
governed all persons "committed or detained . . . for any
crime." $ 3. In cases other than felony or treason plainly
expressed in the warrant of commitment, the Act required
release upon appropriate sureties (unless the commitment
was for a nonbailable offense). Ibid. Where the commitment was for felony or high treason, the Act did not require
immediate release, but instead required the Crown to commence criminal proceedings within a specified time. $ 7. If
the prisoner was not "indicted some Time in the next Term,"

Scalia, J., dissenting
the judge was "required . . . to set at Liberty the Prisonerupon Bail" unless the King was unable to produce his witnesses. Ibid. Able or no, if the prisoner was not broughtto trial by the next succeeding term, the Act provided that
"he shall be discharged from his Imprisonment." Ibid.English courts sat four terms per year, see 3 Blackstone 275-
277, so the practical effect of this provision was that impris-onment without indictment or trial for felony or high treason under $ 7 would not exceed approximately three to sixmonths.

The writ of habeas corpus was preserved in the Constitu-tion--the only common-law writ to be explicitly mentioned.
See Art. I, $ 9, cl. 2. Hamilton lauded "the establishment ofthe writ of

habeas corpus" in his Federalist defense as ameans to protect against "the practice of arbitrary imprisonments . . . in all ages, [one of] the favourite and mostformidable instruments of tyranny." The Federalist No. 84,
at 444. Indeed, availability of the writ under the new Con-stitution (along with the requirement of trial by jury in criminal cases, see Art. III, $ 2, cl. 3) was his basis for arguingthat additional, explicit procedural protections were unnecessary. See The Federalist No. 83, at 433.

II
The allegations here, of course, are no ordinary accusationsof criminal activity. Yaser Esam Hamdi has been imprisoned because the Government believes he participated in thewaging of war against the United States. The relevant
question, then, is whether there is a different, special proce-dure for imprisonment of a citizen accused of wrongdoing by
aiding the enemy in wartime.

A

suspected of war crimes) have traditionally been detained

until the cessation of hostilities and then released. Ante, at518-519. That is probably an accurate description of wartime practice with respect to enemy aliens. The traditionwith respect to American citizens, however, has been quite
different. Citizens aiding the enemy have been treated astraitors subject to the criminal process.

As early as 1350, England's Statute of Treasons made it acrime to "levy War against our Lord the King in his Realm,
or be adherent to the King's Enemies in his Realm, givingto them Aid and Comfort, in the Realm, or elsewhere." 25
Edw. 3, Stat. 5, c. 2. In his 1762 Discourse on High Treason,Sir Michael Foster explained:

"With regard to Natural-born Subjects there can beno Doubt. They owe Allegiance to the Crown at all
Times and in all Places.. . . . .

"The joining with Rebels in an Act of Rebellion, orwith Enemies in Acts of Hostility, will make a Man a
Traitor: in the one Case within the Clause of LevyingWar, in the other within that of Adhering to the King's

"States in Actual Hostility with Us, though no War besolemnly Declared, are Enemies within the meaning of

E. g., Harding's Case, 2 Ventris 315, 86 Eng. Rep. 461 (K. B. 1690); Trial of Parkyns, 13How. St. Tr. 63 (K. B. 1696);

Trial of Vaughan, 13 How.
St. Tr. 485 (K. B. 1696); Trial of Downie, 24 How. St. Tr.1 (1794). The Founders inherited the understanding that

a citizen's levying war against the Government was to be
punished criminally. The Constitution provides: "Treasonagainst the United States, shall consist only in levying War

against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving themAid and Comfort"; and establishes a heightened proof requirement (two witnesses) in order to "convic[t]" of that offense. Art. III, $ 3, cl. 1.

In more recent times, too, citizens have been charged and
tried in Article III courts for acts of war against the United
States, even when their noncitizen co-conspirators were not.
For example, two American citizens alleged to have participated during World War I in a spying conspiracy on behalf
of Germany were tried in federal court. See United States
v. Fricke, 259 F. 673 (SDNY 1919); United States v. Robinson, 259 F. 685 (SDNY 1919). A German member of the
same conspiracy was subjected to military process. See
United States ex rel. Wessels v. McDonald, 265 F. 754
(EDNY 1920). During World War II, the famous German
saboteurs of Ex parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1 (1942), received
military process, but the citizens who associated with them
(with the exception of one citizen-saboteur, discussed below)
were punished under the criminal process. See Haupt v.
United States, 330 U. S. 631 (1947); L. Fisher, Nazi Saboteurs
on Trial 80-84 (2003); see also Cramer v. United States, 325
U. S. 1 (1945).

The modern treason statute is 18 U. S. C. $ 2381; it basically tracks the language of the constitutional provision.
Other provisions of Title 18 criminalize various acts of warmaking and adherence to the enemy. See, e. g., $ 32 (destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities), $ 2332a (use of

only citizen other than Hamdi known to be imprisoned in
connection with military hostilities in Afghanistan against
the United States was subjected to criminal process and convicted upon a guilty plea. See United States v. Lindh, 212

There are times when military exigency renders resort to
the traditional criminal process impracticable. English law
accommodated such exigencies by allowing legislative suspension of the writ of habeas corpus for brief periods.
Blackstone explained:

"And yet sometimes, when the state is in real danger,
even this [i. e., executive detention] may be a necessary
measure. But the happiness of our constitution is, that
it is not left to the executive power to determine when
the danger of the state is so great, as to render this
measure expedient. For the parliament only, or legislative power, whenever it sees proper, can authorize the
crown, by suspending the habeas corpus act for a short
and limited time, to imprison suspected persons without
giving any reason for so doing. . . . In like manner this
experiment ought only to be tried in cases of extreme
emergency; and in these the nation parts with it[s] lib542US2 Unit: $U75 [11-01-06 18:26:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

erty for a while, in order to preserve it for ever." 1Blackstone 132.

Where the Executive has not pursued the usual course ofcharge, committal, and conviction, it has historically secured
the Legislature's explicit approval of a suspension. In Eng-land, Parliament on numerous occasions passed temporary
suspensions in times of threatened invasion or rebellion.E. g., 1 W. & M., c. 7 (1688) (threatened return of James II);
7 & 8 Will. 3, c. 11 (1696) (same); 17 Geo. 2, c. 6 (1744) (threat-ened French invasion); 19 Geo. 2, c. 1 (1746) (threatened rebellion in Scotland); 17 Geo. 3, c. 9 (1777) (the American Rev-olution). Not long after Massachusetts had adopted a clause
in its constitution explicitly providing for habeas corpus, seeMass. Const. pt. 2, ch. 6, art. VII (1780), reprinted in 3 Federal and State Constitutions, Colonial Charters and OtherOrganic Laws 1888, 1910 (F. Thorpe ed. 1909), it suspended
the writ in order to deal with Shay's Rebellion, see Act forSuspending the Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus,
ch. 10, 1786 Mass. Acts p. 510.Our Federal Constitution contains a provision explicitly
permitting suspension, but limiting the situations in which itmay be invoked: "The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebel-lion or Invasion the public Safety may require it." Art. I,

$ 9, cl. 2. Although this provision does not state that sus-pension must be effected by, or authorized by, a legislative
act, it has been so understood, consistent with English prac-tice and the Clause's placement in Article I. See Ex parte
Bollman, 4 Cranch 75, 101 (1807); Ex parte Merryman, 17F. Cas. 144, 151-152 (CD Md. 1861) (Taney, C. J., rejecting Lincoln's unauthorized suspension); 3 Story $ 1336, at208-209.

The Suspension Clause was by design a safety valve, theConstitution's only "express provision for exercise of extraordinary authority because of a crisis," Youngstown
Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 650 (1952) (Jack542US2 Unit: $U75 [11-01-06 18:26:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

son, J., concurring). Very early in the Nation's history,President Jefferson unsuccessfully sought a suspension of habeas corpus to deal with Aaron Burr's conspiracy to over-throw the Government. See 16 Annals of Congress 402-425
(1807). During the Civil War, Congress passed its first Actauthorizing executive suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, see Act of Mar. 3, 1863, 12 Stat. 755, to the relief ofthose many who thought President Lincoln's unauthorized
proclamations of suspension (e. g., Proclamation No. 1, 13Stat. 730) unconstitutional. Later Presidential proclamations of suspension relied upon the congressional authoriza-tion,

e. g., Proclamation No. 7, 13 Stat. 734. During Recon-struction, Congress passed the Ku Klux Klan Act, which

included a provision authorizing suspension of the writ, in-voked by President Grant in quelling a rebellion in nine
South Carolina counties. See Act of Apr. 20, 1871, ch. 22,$ 4, 17 Stat. 14; A Proclamation [of Oct. 17, 1871], 7 Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents 136-138(J. Richardson ed. 1899) (hereinafter Messages and Papers);
id., at 138-139.Two later Acts of Congress provided broad suspension authority to governors of U. S. possessions. The PhilippineCivil Government Act of 1902 provided that the Governor of
the Philippines could suspend the writ in case of rebellion,insurrection, or invasion. Act of July 1, 1902, ch. 1369, $ 5,
32 Stat. 692. In 1905 the writ was suspended for ninemonths by proclamation of the Governor. See

Fisher v.Baker, 203 U. S. 174, 179-181 (1906). The Hawaiian Organic

Act of 1900 likewise provided that the Governor of Hawaiicould suspend the writ in case of rebellion or invasion (or
threat thereof). Ch. 339, $ 67, 31 Stat. 153.

III
Of course the extensive historical evidence of criminal con-victions and habeas suspensions does not

necessarily refutethe Government's position in this case. When the writ is

542US2 Unit: $U75 [11-01-06 18:26:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN
564 HAMDI v. RUMSFELD

Scalia, J., dissenting
suspended, the Government is entirely free from judicialoversight. It does not claim such total liberation here, but

argues that it need only produce what it calls "some evi-dence" to satisfy a habeas court that a detained individual is
an enemy combatant. See Brief for Respondents 34. Evenif suspension of the writ on the one hand, and committal for
criminal charges on the other hand, have been the only traditional means of dealing with citizens who levied war againsttheir own country, it is theoretically possible that the Constitution does not require a choice between these alternatives.I believe, however, that substantial evidence does refute
that possibility. First, the text of the 1679 Habeas Corpus
Act makes clear that indefinite imprisonment on reasonable
suspicion is not an available option of treatment for those
accused of aiding the enemy, absent a suspension of the writ.
In the United States, this Act was read as "enforc[ing] the
common law," Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 193, 202 (1830), and
shaped the early understanding of the scope of the writ. As
noted above, see supra, at 557-558, $ 7 of the Act specifically
addressed those committed for high treason, and provided a
remedy if they were not indicted and tried by the second
succeeding court term. That remedy was not a bobtailed
judicial inquiry into whether there were reasonable grounds
to believe the prisoner had taken up arms against the King.
Rather, if the prisoner was not indicted and tried within the
prescribed time, "he shall be discharged from his Imprisonment." 31 Car. 2, c. 2, $ 7. The Act does not contain any
exception for wartime. That omission is conspicuous, since

$ 7 explicitly addresses the offense of "High Treason," which
often involved offenses of a military nature. See cases cited
supra, at 560.

Writings from the founding generation also suggest that,
without exception, the only constitutional alternatives are
to charge the crime or suspend the writ. In 1788, Thomas
Jefferson wrote to James Madison questioning the need for
a Suspension Clause in cases of rebellion in the proposed

Scalia, J., dissenting
Constitution. His letter illustrates the constraints underwhich the Founders understood themselves to operate:

"Why suspend the Hab. corp. in insurrections and re-bellions? The parties who may be arrested may be
charged instantly with a well defined crime. Of coursethe judge will remand them. If the publick safety requires that the government should have a man impris-oned on less probable testimony in those than in other
emergencies; let him be taken and tried, retaken andretried, while the necessity continues, only giving him
redress against the government for damages." 13 Pa-pers of Thomas Jefferson 442 (July 31, 1788) (J. Boyd
ed. 1956).
A similar view was reflected in the 1807 House debates oversuspension during the armed uprising that came to be known

as Burr's conspiracy:

"With regard to those persons who may be implicatedin the conspiracy, if the writ of habeas corpus be not

suspended, what will be the consequence? When ap-prehended, they will be brought before a court of justice, who will decide whether there is any evidence thatwill justify their commitment for farther prosecution.
From the communication of the Executive, it appearedthere was sufficient evidence to authorize their commitment. Several months would elapse before their finaltrial, which would give time to collect evidence, and if
this shall be sufficient, they will not fail to receive thepunishment merited by their crimes, and inflicted by the
laws of their country." 16 Annals of Congress, at 405(remarks of Rep. Burwell).

The absence of military authority to imprison citizens in-definitely in wartime--whether or not a probability of treason had been established by means less than jury trial--wasconfirmed by three cases decided during and immediately
after the War of 1812. In the first, In re Stacy, 10 Johns.

Scalia, J., dissenting
*328 (N. Y. 1813), a citizen was taken into military custody
on suspicion that he was "carrying provisions and giving information to the enemy." Id., at *330 (emphasis deleted).
Stacy petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, and, after the
defendant custodian attempted to avoid complying, Chief
Justice Kent ordered attachment against him. Kent noted
that the military was "without any color of authority in any
military tribunal to try a citizen for that crime" and that it
was "holding him in the closest confinement, and contemning
the civil authority of the state." Id., at *333-*334.

Two other cases, later cited with approval by this Court
in Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, 128-129 (1866), upheld verdicts for false imprisonment against military officers. In
Smith v. Shaw, 12 Johns. *257 (N. Y. 1815), the court affirmed
an award of damages for detention of a citizen on suspicion
that he was, among other things, "an enemy's spy in time of
war." Id., at *265. The court held that "[n]one of the offences charged against Shaw were cognizable by a courtmartial, except that which related to his being a spy; and if
he was an American citizen, he could not be charged with
such an offence. He might be amenable to the civil authority for treason; but could not be punished, under martial law,
as a spy." Ibid. "If the defendant was justifiable in doing
what he did, every citizen of the United States would, in time
of war, be equally exposed to a like exercise of military
power and authority." Id., at *266. Finally, in M'Connell
v. Hampton, 12 Johns. *234 (N. Y. 1815), a jury awarded
$9,000 for false imprisonment after a military officer confined
a citizen on charges of treason; the judges on appeal did not
question the verdict but found the damages excessive, in
part because "it does not appear that [the defendant] . . .
knew [the plaintiff] was a citizen." Id., at *238 (Spencer,

President Lincoln, when he purported to suspend habeascorpus without congressional authorization during the Civil

War, apparently did not doubt that suspension was requiredif the prisoner was to be held without criminal trial. In his
famous message to Congress on July 4, 1861, he argued onlythat he could suspend the writ, not that even without suspension, his imprisonment of citizens without criminal trial waspermitted. See Special Session Message, 6 Messages and
Papers 20-31.Further evidence comes from this Court's decision in
Ex parte Milligan, supra. There, the Court issued the writto an American citizen who had been tried by military commission for offenses that included conspiring to overthrowthe Government, seize munitions, and liberate prisoners of
war. Id., at 6-7. The Court rejected in no uncertain termsthe Government's assertion that military jurisdiction was
proper "under the `laws and usages of war,' " id., at 121:

"It can serve no useful purpose to inquire what thoselaws and usages are, whence they originated, where

found, and on whom they operate; they can never beapplied to citizens in states which have upheld the authority of the government, and where the courts areopen and their process unobstructed," ibid.

Milligan is not exactly this case, of course, since the peti-tioner was threatened with death, not merely imprisonment.
But the reasoning and conclusion of Milligan logically coverthe present case. The Government justifies imprisonment
of Hamdi on principles of the law of war and admits that,absent the war, it would have no such authority. But if the

1 As I shall discuss presently, see infra, at 570-572, the Court purported
to limit this language in Ex parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1, 45 (1942). Whatever Quirin's effect on Milligan's precedential value, however, it cannot
undermine its value as an indicator of original meaning. Cf. Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, 30 (1957) (plurality opinion) (Milligan remains "one of
the great landmarks in this Court's history").

Scalia, J., dissenting
law of war cannot be applied to citizens where courts areopen, then Hamdi's imprisonment without criminal trial is no

less unlawful than Milligan's trial by military tribunal.

Milligan responded to the argument, repeated by the
Government in this case, that it is dangerous to leave sus-pected traitors at large in time of war:

"If it was dangerous, in the distracted condition of af-fairs, to leave Milligan unrestrained of his liberty, because he `conspired against the government, afforded aidand comfort to rebels, and incited the people to insurrection,' the law said arrest him, confine him closely, renderhim powerless to do further mischief; and then present
his case to the grand jury of the district, with proofs of
his guilt, and, if indicted, try him according to the courseof the common law. If this had been done, the Constitution would have been vindicated, the law of 1863 en-forced, and the securities for personal liberty preserved
and defended." Id., at 122.
Thus, criminal process was viewed as the primary means--and the only means absent congressional action suspending

the writ--not only to punish traitors, but to incapacitate
them.The proposition that the Executive lacks indefinite wartime detention authority over citizens is consistent with theFounders' general mistrust of military power permanently
at the Executive's disposal. In the Founders' view, the"blessings of liberty" were threatened by "those military establishments which must gradually poison its very fountain."The Federalist No. 45, p. 238 (J. Madison). No fewer than
10 issues of the Federalist were devoted in whole or part to
allaying fears of oppression from the proposed Constitution's
authorization of standing armies in peacetime. Many safeguards in the Constitution reflect these concerns. Congress's authority "[t]o raise and support Armies" was hedged
with the proviso that "no Appropriation of Money to that

Scalia, J., dissenting
Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years." U. S.Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 12. Except for the actual command of

military forces, all authorization for their maintenance andall explicit authorization for their use is placed in the control
of Congress under Article I, rather than the President underArticle II. As Hamilton explained, the President's military
authority would be "much inferior" to that of the BritishKing:

"It would amount to nothing more than the supremecommand and direction of the military and naval forces,
as first general and admiral of the confederacy: whilethat of the British king extends to the

declaring of war,and to the raising and regulating of fleets and armies;

all which, by the constitution under consideration, wouldappertain to the legislature." The Federalist No. 69,
p. 357.
A view of the Constitution that gives the Executive author-ity to use military force rather than the force of law against

citizens on American soil flies in the face of the mistrust thatengendered these provisions.

IV
The Government argues that our more recent jurispru-dence ratifies its indefinite imprisonment of a citizen within

the territorial jurisdiction of federal courts. It places pri-mary reliance upon Ex parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1 (1942), a
World War II case upholding the trial by military commis-sion of eight German saboteurs, one of whom, Herbert
Haupt, was a U. S. citizen. The case was not this Court'sfinest hour. The Court upheld the commission and denied
relief in a brief per curiam issued the day after oral argu-ment concluded, see id., at 18-19, unnumbered note; a week
later the Government carried out the commission's deathsentence upon six saboteurs, including Haupt. The Court
eventually explained its reasoning in a written opinion issuedseveral months later.

570 HAMDI v. RUMSFELD

Scalia, J., dissenting
Only three paragraphs of the Court's lengthy opinion dealtwith the particular circumstances of Haupt's case. See

id.,
at 37-38, 45-46. The Government argued that Haupt, likethe other petitioners, could be tried by military commission

under the laws of war. In agreeing with that contention,
Quirin purported to interpret the language of Milligan
quoted above (the law of war "can never be applied to citizens in states which have upheld the authority of the govern-ment, and where the courts are open and their process unobstructed") in the following manner:

"Elsewhere in its opinion . . . the Court was at pains topoint out that Milligan, a citizen twenty years resident

in Indiana, who had never been a resident of any of the
states in rebellion, was not an enemy belligerent eitherentitled to the status of a prisoner of war or subject to

the penalties imposed upon unlawful belligerents. Weconstrue the Court's statement as to the inapplicability
of the law of war to Milligan's case as having particularreference to the facts before it. From them the Court
concluded that Milligan, not being a part of or associ-ated with the armed forces of the enemy, was a nonbelligerent, not subject to the law of war . . . ." 317U. S., at 45.

In my view this seeks to revise Milligan rather than de-scribe it.

Milligan had involved (among other issues) two
separate questions: (1) whether the military trial of Milliganwas justified by the laws of war, and if not (2) whether the

President's suspension of the writ, pursuant to congressionalauthorization, prevented the issuance of habeas corpus. The
Court's categorical language about the law of war's inapplicability to citizens where the courts are open (with no exception mentioned for citizens who were prisoners of war) was
contained in its discussion of the first point. See 4 Wall., at
121. The factors pertaining to whether Milligan could reasonably be considered a belligerent and prisoner of war,

542US2 Unit: $U75 [11-01-06 18:26:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
while mentioned earlier in the opinion, see id., at 118, weremade relevant and brought to bear in the Court's later discussion, see id., at 131, of whether Milligan came within thestatutory provision that effectively made an exception to
Congress's authorized suspension of the writ for (as theCourt described it) "all parties, not prisoners of war, resident
in their respective jurisdictions, . . . who were citizens ofstates in which the administration of the laws in the Federal
tribunals was unimpaired," id., at 116. Milligan thus un-derstood was in accord with the traditional law of habeas
corpus I have described: Though treason often occurred inwartime, there was, absent provision for special treatment
in a congressional suspension of the writ, no exception tothe right to trial by jury for citizens who could be called
"belligerents" or "prisoners of war." 2But even if

Quirin gave a correct description of Milligan,or made an irrevocable revision of it, Quirin would still not

justify denial of the writ here. In Quirin it was uncontestedthat the petitioners were members of enemy forces. They
were "admitted enemy invaders," 317 U. S., at 47 (emphasisadded), and it was "undisputed" that they had landed in the
United States in service of German forces, id., at 20. Thespecific holding of the Court was only that, "upon the

con-ceded facts," the petitioners were "plainly within [the]

boundaries" of military jurisdiction, id., at 46 (emphasisadded).

3 But where those jurisdictional facts are not con2 Without bothering to respond to this analysis, the plurality states that
Milligan "turned in large part" upon the defendant's lack of prisoner-ofwar status, and that the Milligan Court explicitly and repeatedly said so.
Ante, at 522. Neither is true. To the extent, however, that prisoner-ofwar status was relevant in Milligan, it was only because prisoners of war
received different statutory treatment under the conditional suspension
then in effect.

3 The only two Court of Appeals cases from World War II cited by the

Government in which citizens were detained without trial likewise involved petitioners who were conceded to have been members of enemy
forces. See In re Territo, 156 F. 2d 142, 143-145 (CA9 1946); Colepaugh

Scalia, J., dissenting
ceded--where the petitioner insists that he is not a belliger-ent--Quirin left the pre-existing law in place: Absent suspension of the writ, a citizen held where the courts are openis entitled either to criminal trial or to a judicial decree requiring his release.4
v. Looney, 235 F. 2d 429, 432 (CA10 1956). The plurality complains that
Territo is the only case I have identified in which "a United States citizen
[was] captured in a foreign combat zone," ante, at 523. Indeed it is; such
cases must surely be rare. But given the constitutional tradition I have
described, the burden is not upon me to find cases in which the writ was
granted to citizens in this country who had been captured on foreign battlefields; it is upon those who would carve out an exception for such citizens (as the plurality's complaint suggests it would) to find a single case
(other than one where enemy status was admitted) in which habeas was
denied.

4 The plurality's assertion that Quirin somehow "clarifies" Milligan,

ante, at 523, is simply false. As I discuss supra, at 570-571 and this page,
the Quirin Court propounded a mistaken understanding of Milligan; but
nonetheless its holding was limited to "the case presented by the present
record," and to "the conceded facts," and thus avoided conflict with the
earlier case. See 317 U. S., at 45-46 (emphasis added). The plurality,
ignoring this expressed limitation, thinks it "beside the point" whether
belligerency is conceded or found "by some other process" (not necessarily
a jury trial) "that verifies this fact with sufficient certainty." Ante, at
523. But the whole point of the procedural guarantees in the Bill of
Rights is to limit the methods by which the Government can determine
facts that the citizen disputes and on which the citizen's liberty depends.
The plurality's claim that Quirin's one-paragraph discussion of Milligan
provides a "[c]lear . . . disavowal" of two false imprisonment cases from
the War of 1812, ante, at 522, thus defies logic; unlike the plaintiffs in those
cases, Haupt was concededly a member of an enemy force.

The Government also cites Moyer v. Peabody, 212 U. S. 78 (1909), a suit
for damages against the Governor of Colorado, for violation of due process
in detaining the alleged ringleader of a rebellion quelled by the state militia after the Governor's declaration of a state of insurrection and (he contended) suspension of the writ "as incident thereto." Ex parte Moyer, 35
Colo. 154, 157, 91 P. 738, 740 (1905). But the holding of Moyer v. Peabody
(even assuming it is transferable from state-militia detention after state
suspension to federal standing-army detention without suspension) is simply that "[s]o long as such arrests [were] made in good faith and in the
honest belief that they [were] needed in order to head the insurrection

V
It follows from what I have said that Hamdi is entitled
to a habeas decree requiring his release unless (1) criminal
proceedings are promptly brought, or (2) Congress has suspended the writ of habeas corpus. A suspension of the writ
could, of course, lay down conditions for continued detention,
similar to those that today's opinion prescribes under the
Due Process Clause. Cf. Act of Mar. 3, 1863, 12 Stat. 755.
But there is a world of difference between the people's representatives' determining the need for that suspension (and
prescribing the conditions for it), and this Court's doing so.

The plurality finds justification for Hamdi's imprisonment
in the Authorization for Use of Military Force, 115 Stat. 224,
which provides:

analysis is a forebear of our modern doctrine of qualified immunity.
Cf. Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232, 247-248 (1974) (understanding Moyer
in this way). Moreover, the detention at issue in Moyer lasted about 21/2
months, see 212 U. S., at 85, roughly the length of time permissible under
the 1679 Habeas Corpus Act, see supra, at 557-558.

In addition to Moyer v. Peabody, Justice Thomas relies upon Luther
v. Borden, 7 How. 1 (1849), a case in which the state legislature had imposed martial law--a step even more drastic than suspension of the writ.
See post, at 590-591 (dissenting opinion). But martial law has not been
imposed here, and in any case is limited to "the theatre of active military
operations, where war really prevails," and where therefore the courts are
closed. Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, 127 (1866); see also id., at 129-130

Scalia, J., dissenting
This is not remotely a congressional suspension of the writ,and no one claims that it is. Contrary to the plurality's

view, I do not think this statute even authorizes detention ofa citizen with the clarity necessary to satisfy the interpretive
canon that statutes should be construed so as to avoid graveconstitutional concerns, see Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v.
Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485U. S. 568, 575 (1988); with the clarity necessary to comport
with cases such as Ex parte Endo, 323 U. S. 283, 300 (1944),and

Duncan v. Kahanamoku, 327 U. S. 304, 314-316, 324(1946); or with the clarity necessary to overcome the statutory prescription that "[n]o citizen shall be imprisoned orotherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to
an Act of Congress" 18 U. S. C. $ 4001(a).5 But even if it

5 The plurality rejects any need for "specific language of detention" on
the ground that detention of alleged combatants is a "fundamental incident
of waging war." Ante, at 519. Its authorities do not support that holding in the context of the present case. Some are irrelevant because they
do not address the detention of American citizens. E. g., Naqvi, Doubtful
Prisoner-of-War Status, 84 Int'l Rev. Red Cross 571, 572 (2002). The plurality's assertion that detentions of citizen and alien combatants are
equally authorized has no basis in law or common sense. Citizens and
noncitizens, even if equally dangerous, are not similarly situated. See,
e. g., Milligan, supra; Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763 (1950); Rev.
Stat. 4067, 50 U. S. C. $ 21 (Alien Enemy Act). That captivity may be
consistent with the principles of international law does not prove that
it also complies with the restrictions that the Constitution places on the
American Government's treatment of its own citizens. Of the authorities
cited by the plurality that do deal with detention of citizens, Quirin,
supra, and Territo, 156 F. 2d 142, have already been discussed and rejected.
See supra, at 571-572, and n. 3. The remaining authorities pertain to U. S.
detention of citizens during the Civil War, and are irrelevant for two reasons: (1) the Lieber Code was issued following a congressional authorization of suspension of the writ, see Instructions for the Government of
Armies of the United States in the Field, Gen. Order No. 100 (1863), reprinted in 2 F. Lieber, Miscellaneous Writings, p. 246; Act of Mar. 3, 1863,
12 Stat. 755, $$ 1, 2; and (2) citizens of the Confederacy, while citizens of
the United States, were also regarded as citizens of a hostile power.

did, I would not permit it to overcome Hamdi's entitlement
to habeas corpus relief. The Suspension Clause of the Constitution, which carefully circumscribes the conditions under
which the writ can be withheld, would be a sham if it could
be evaded by congressional prescription of requirements
other than the common-law requirement of committal for
criminal prosecution that render the writ, though available,
unavailing. If the Suspension Clause does not guarantee
the citizen that he will either be tried or released, unless the
conditions for suspending the writ exist and the grave action
of suspending the writ has been taken; if it merely guarantees the citizen that he will not be detained unless Congress
by ordinary legislation says he can be detained; it guarantees
him very little indeed.

It should not be thought, however, that the plurality's evisceration of the Suspension Clause augments, principally, the
power of Congress. As usual, the major effect of its constitutional improvisation is to increase the power of the Court.
Having found a congressional authorization for detention of
citizens where none clearly exists; and having discarded the
categorical procedural protection of the Suspension Clause;
the plurality then proceeds, under the guise of the Due Process Clause, to prescribe what procedural protections it
thinks appropriate. It "weigh[s] the private interest . . .
against the Government's asserted interest," ante, at 529 (internal quotation marks omitted), and--just as though writing a new Constitution--comes up with an unheard-of system in which the citizen rather than the Government bears
the burden of proof, testimony is by hearsay rather than live
witnesses, and the presiding officer may well be a "neutral"
military officer rather than judge and jury. See ante, at
533-534. It claims authority to engage in this sort of "judicious balancing" from Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319
(1976), a case involving . . . the withdrawal of disability benefits! Whatever the merits of this technique when newly

Scalia, J., dissenting
recognized property rights are at issue (and even there theyare questionable), it has no place where the Constitution and

the common law already supply an answer.Having distorted the Suspension Clause, the plurality
finishes up by transmogrifying the Great Writ--disposingof the present habeas petition by remanding for the District Court to "engag[e] in a factfinding process that is
both prudent and incremental," ante, at 539. "In the ab-sence of [the Executive's prior provision of procedures that

satisfy due process], . . . a court that receives a petition for awrit of habeas corpus from an alleged enemy combatant
must itself ensure that the minimum requirements of dueprocess are achieved."

Ante, at 538. This judicial remediation of executive default is unheard of. The role of habeascorpus is to determine the legality of executive detention,

not to supply the omitted process necessary to make it legal.See

Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475, 484 (1973) ("[T]he
essence of habeas corpus is an attack by a person in custodyupon the legality of that custody, and . . . the traditional

function of the writ is to secure release from illegal custody"); 1 Blackstone 132-133. It is not the habeas court'sfunction to make illegal detention legal by supplying a process that the Government could have provided, but chose
not to. If Hamdi is being imprisoned in violation of the Constitution (because without due process of law), then his habeas petition should be granted; the Executive may then
hand him over to the criminal authorities, whose detention
for the purpose of prosecution will be lawful, or else must
release him.

There is a certain harmony of approach in the plurality's
making up for Congress's failure to invoke the Suspension
Clause and its making up for the Executive's failure to apply
what it says are needed procedures--an approach that reflects what might be called a Mr. Fix-it Mentality. The plurality seems to view it as its mission to Make Everything
Come Out Right, rather than merely to decree the consequences, as far as individual rights are concerned, of the

other two branches' actions and omissions. Has the Legisla-ture failed to suspend the writ in the current dire emergency? Well, we will remedy that failure by prescribing thereasonable conditions that a suspension should have included. And has the Executive failed to live up to thosereasonable conditions? Well, we will ourselves make that
failure good, so that this dangerous fellow (if he is danger-ous) need not be set free. The problem with this approach
is not only that it steps out of the courts' modest and limitedrole in a democratic society; but that by repeatedly doing
what it thinks the political branches ought to do it encour-ages their lassitude and saps the vitality of government by
the people. VI

Several limitations give my views in this matter a rela-tively narrow compass. They apply only to citizens, accused
of being enemy combatants, who are detained within the ter-ritorial jurisdiction of a federal court. This is not likely to
be a numerous group; currently we know of only two, Hamdiand Jose Padilla. Where the citizen is captured outside and
held outside the United States, the constitutional require-ments may be different. Cf.

Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339U. S. 763, 769-771 (1950);
Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, 74-75(1957) (Harlan, J., concurring in result); Rasul v. Bush, ante,

at 502-504 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Moreover, even withinthe United States, the accused citizen-enemy combatant may
lawfully be detained once prosecution is in progress or incontemplation. See, e. g., County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44 (1991) (brief detention pending judicial de-termination after warrantless arrest); United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739 (1987) (pretrial detention under the BailReform Act). The Government has been notably successful
in securing conviction, and hence long-term custody or exe-cution, of those who have waged war against the state.

I frankly do not know whether these tools are sufficient tomeet the Government's security needs, including the need to
obtain intelligence through interrogation. It is far beyond

Scalia, J., dissenting
my competence, or the Court's competence, to determinethat. But it is not beyond Congress's. If the situation demands it, the Executive can ask Congress to authorize sus-pension of the writ--which can be made subject to whatever
conditions Congress deems appropriate, including even theprocedural novelties invented by the plurality today. To be
sure, suspension is limited by the Constitution to cases ofrebellion or invasion. But whether the attacks of September 11, 2001, constitute an "invasion," and whether those at-tacks still justify suspension several years later, are questions for Congress rather than this Court. See 3 Story$ 1336, at 208-209.

6 If civil rights are to be curtailed during

wartime, it must be done openly and democratically, as theConstitution requires, rather than by silent erosion through

an opinion of this Court.

* * *
The Founders well understood the difficult tradeoff be-tween safety and freedom. "Safety from external danger,"

Hamilton declared,

"is the most powerful director of national conduct.Even the ardent love of liberty will, after a time, give

way to its dictates. The violent destruction of life andproperty incident to war; the continual effort and alarm
attendant on a state of continual danger, will compel na-tions the most attached to liberty, to resort for repose
and security to institutions which have a tendency todestroy their civil and political rights. To be more safe,
they, at length, become willing to run the risk of beingless free." The Federalist No. 8, p. 33.

6 Justice Thomas worries that the constitutional conditions for suspension of the writ will not exist "during many . . . emergencies during
which . . . detention authority might be necessary," post, at 594. It is
difficult to imagine situations in which security is so seriously threatened
as to justify indefinite imprisonment without trial, and yet the constitutional conditions of rebellion or invasion are not met.

The Founders warned us about the risk, and equipped uswith a Constitution designed to deal with it.

Many think it not only inevitable but entirely proper thatliberty give way to security in times of national crisis--that,
at the extremes of military exigency, inter arma silent leges.Whatever the general merits of the view that war silences
law or modulates its voice, that view has no place in the
interpretation and application of a Constitution designedprecisely to confront war and, in a manner that accords with

democratic principles, to accommodate it. Because theCourt has proceeded to meet the current emergency in a
manner the Constitution does not envision, I respectfullydissent.

Justice Thomas, dissenting.
The Executive Branch, acting pursuant to the powers
vested in the President by the Constitution and with explicit
congressional approval, has determined that Yaser Hamdi is
an enemy combatant and should be detained. This detention falls squarely within the Federal Government's war
powers, and we lack the expertise and capacity to secondguess that decision. As such, petitioners' habeas challenge
should fail, and there is no reason to remand the case. The
plurality reaches a contrary conclusion by failing adequately
to consider basic principles of the constitutional structure as
it relates to national security and foreign affairs and by using
the balancing scheme of Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319
(1976). I do not think that the Federal Government's war
powers can be balanced away by this Court. Arguably,
Congress could provide for additional procedural protections, but until it does, we have no right to insist upon them.
But even if I were to agree with the general approach the
plurality takes, I could not accept the particulars. The plurality utterly fails to account for the Government's compelling interests and for our own institutional inability to weigh
competing concerns correctly. I respectfully dissent.

"It is `obvious and unarguable' that no governmental inter-est is more compelling than the security of the Nation."

Haig v. Agee, 453 U. S. 280, 307 (1981) (quoting Aptheker v.
Secretary of State, 378 U. S. 500, 509 (1964)). The nationalsecurity, after all, is the primary responsibility and purpose

of the Federal Government. See, e. g., Youngstown Sheet &Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 662 (1952) (Clark, J., concurring in judgment); The Federalist No. 23, pp. 146-147 (J.Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) ("The principle purposes to
be answered by Union are these--The common defence ofthe members--the preservation of the public peace as well
against internal convulsions as external attacks"). But be-cause the Founders understood that they could not foresee
the myriad potential threats to national security that mightlater arise, they chose to create a Federal Government that
necessarily possesses sufficient power to handle any threat tothe security of the Nation. The power to protect the Nation

"ought to exist without limitation . . . [b]ecause it is
impossible to foresee or define the extent and varietyof national exigencies, or the correspondent extent &

variety of the means which may be necessary to satisfythem. The circumstances that endanger the safety of
nations are infinite; and for this reason no constitutionalshackles can wisely be imposed on the power to which
the care of it is committed." Id., at 147.
See also id., Nos. 34 and 41.The Founders intended that the President have primary

responsibility--along with the necessary power--to protectthe national security and to conduct the Nation's foreign
relations. They did so principally because the structuraladvantages of a unitary Executive are essential in these
domains. "Energy in the executive is a leading characterin the definition of good government. It is essential to the
protection of the community against foreign attacks." Id.,

No. 70, at 471 (A. Hamilton). The principle "ingredien[t]"for "energy in the executive" is "unity."

Id., at 472. This
is because "[d]ecision, activity, secrecy, and dispatch will gen-erally characterise the proceedings of one man, in a much

more eminent degree, than the proceedings of any greaternumber."

Ibid.
These structural advantages are most important in the
national-security and foreign-affairs contexts. "Of all thecares or concerns of government, the direction of war most

peculiarly demands those qualities which distinguish the ex-ercise of power by a single hand."

Id., No. 74, at 500 (A.
Hamilton). Also for these reasons, John Marshall explainedthat "[t]he President is the sole organ of the nation in its

external relations, and its sole representative with foreignnations." 10 Annals of Cong. 613 (1800); see

id., at 613-614.
To this end, the Constitution vests in the President "[t]heexecutive Power," Art. II, $ 1, provides that he "shall be

Commander in Chief of the" Armed Forces, $ 2, and placesin him the power to recognize foreign governments, $ 3.

This Court has long recognized these features and has accordingly held that the President has constitutional author-ity to protect the national security and that this authority

carries with it broad discretion.

"If a war be made by invasion of a foreign nation, the
President is not only authorized but bound to resistforce by force. He does not initiate the war, but is

bound to accept the challenge without waiting for anyspecial legislative authority. . . . Whether the President
in fulfilling his duties, as Commander in-chief, in suppressing an insurrection, has met with such armed hostile resistance . . . is a question to be decided by him."

subdue the enemy." Fleming v. Page, 9 How. 603, 615(1850). With respect to foreign affairs as well, the Court

has recognized the President's independent authority andneed to be free from interference. See, e. g., United States
v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S. 304, 320 (1936) (ex-plaining that the President "has his confidential sources of
information. He has his agents in the form of diplomatic,consular and other officials. Secrecy in respect of information gathered by them may be highly necessary, and the pre-mature disclosure of it productive of harmful results");

Chi-cago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S. S. Corp.,

333 U. S. 103, 111 (1948).Congress, to be sure, has a substantial and essential role
in both foreign affairs and national security. But it is cru-cial to recognize that judicial interference in these domains
destroys the purpose of vesting primary responsibility in aunitary Executive. I cannot improve on Justice Jackson's
words, speaking for the Court:

"The President, both as Commander-in-Chief and as theNation's organ for foreign affairs, has available intelligence services whose reports are not and ought not tobe published to the world. It would be intolerable that
courts, without the relevant information, should reviewand perhaps nullify actions of the Executive taken on
information properly held secret. Nor can courts sit incamera in order to be taken into executive confidences.
But even if courts could require full disclosure, the verynature of executive decisions as to foreign policy is political, not judicial. Such decisions are wholly confided byour Constitution to the political departments of the government, Executive and Legislative. They are delicate,complex, and involve large elements of prophecy. They
are and should be undertaken only by those directly re-sponsible to the people whose welfare they advance or
imperil. They are decisions of a kind for which the Ju-diciary has neither aptitude, facilities nor responsibility

and which has long been held to belong in the domain ofpolitical power not subject to judicial intrusion or inquiry." Ibid.
Several points, made forcefully by Justice Jackson, are worthemphasizing. First, with respect to certain decisions relating to national security and foreign affairs, the courts simplylack the relevant information and expertise to second-guess
determinations made by the President based on informationproperly withheld. Second, even if the courts could compel
the Executive to produce the necessary information, such de-cisions are simply not amenable to judicial determination because "[t]hey are delicate, complex, and involve large ele-ments of prophecy." Ibid. Third, the Court in Chicago &
Southern Air Lines and elsewhere has correctly recognizedthe primacy of the political branches in the foreign-affairs
and national-security contexts.For these institutional reasons and because "Congress cannot anticipate and legislate with regard to every possible ac-tion the President may find it necessary to take or every
possible situation in which he might act," it should come asno surprise that "[s]uch failure of Congress . . . does not,
`especially . . . in the areas of foreign policy and nationalsecurity,' imply `congressional disapproval' of action taken
by the Executive." Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U. S. 654,678 (1981) (quoting

Agee, 453 U. S., at 291). Rather, in thesedomains, the fact that Congress has provided the President

with broad authorities does not imply--and the JudicialBranch should not infer--that Congress intended to deprive
him of particular powers not specifically enumerated. SeeDames & Moore, 453 U. S., at 678. As far as the courts are
concerned, "the enactment of legislation closely related tothe question of the President's authority in a particular case
which evinces legislative intent to accord the Presidentbroad discretion may be considered to `invite' `measures on
independent presidential responsibility.' " Ibid. (quoting
Youngstown, 343 U. S., at 637 (Jackson, J., concurring)).

584 HAMDI v. RUMSFELD

Thomas, J., dissenting
Finally, and again for the same reasons, where "the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization
from Congress, he exercises not only his powers but also
those delegated by Congress[, and i]n such a case the executive action `would be supported by the strongest of presumptions and the widest latitude of judicial interpretation, and
the burden of persuasion would rest heavily upon any who
might attack it.' " Dames & Moore, supra, at 668 (quoting
Youngstown, supra, at 637 (Jackson, J., concurring)). That
is why the Court has explained, in a case analogous to this
one, that "the detention[,] ordered by the President in the
declared exercise of his powers as Commander in Chief of
the Army in time of war and of grave public danger[, is] not
to be set aside by the courts without the clear conviction that
[it is] in conflict with the Constitution or laws of Congress
constitutionally enacted." Ex parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1, 25
(1942). See also Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, 133 (1866)
(Chase, C. J., concurring in judgment) (stating that a sentence imposed by a military commission "must not be set
aside except upon the clearest conviction that it cannot be
reconciled with the Constitution and the constitutional legislation of Congress"). This deference extends to the President's determination of all the factual predicates necessary
to conclude that a given action is appropriate. See Quirin,
supra, at 25 ("We are not here concerned with any question
of the guilt or innocence of petitioners"). See also Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U. S. 81, 93 (1943); Prize Cases, 2
Black, at 670; Martin v. Mott, 12 Wheat. 19, 29-30 (1827).

To be sure, the Court has at times held, in specific circumstances, that the military acted beyond its warmaking authority. But these cases are distinguishable in important
ways. In Ex parte Endo, 323 U. S. 283 (1944), the Court
held unlawful the detention of an admittedly law-abiding and
loyal American of Japanese ancestry. It did so because the

542US2 Unit: $U75 [11-01-06 18:26:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Thomas, J., dissenting
Government's asserted reason for the detention had nothing
to do with the congressional and executive authorities upon
which the Government relied. Those authorities permitted
detention for the purpose of preventing espionage and sabotage and thus could not be pressed into service for detaining
a loyal citizen. See id., at 301-302. Further, the Court
"stress[ed] the silence . . . of the [relevant] Act and the Executive Orders." Id., at 301 (emphasis added); see also id.,
at 301-304. The Court sensibly held that the Government
could not detain a loyal citizen pursuant to executive and
congressional authorities that could not conceivably be implicated given the Government's factual allegations. And
in Youngstown, Justice Jackson emphasized that "Congress
ha[d] not left seizure of private property an open field but
ha[d] covered it by three statutory policies inconsistent with
th[e] seizure." 343 U. S., at 639 (concurring opinion). See
also Milligan, supra, at 134 (Chase, C. J., concurring in judgment) (noting that the Government failed to comply with
statute directly on point).

I acknowledge that the question whether Hamdi's executive detention is lawful is a question properly resolved by
the Judicial Branch, though the question comes to the Court
with the strongest presumptions in favor of the Government.
The plurality agrees that Hamdi's detention is lawful if he is
an enemy combatant. But the question whether Hamdi is
actually an enemy combatant is "of a kind for which the Judiciary has neither aptitude, facilities nor responsibility and
which has long been held to belong in the domain of political
power not subject to judicial intrusion or inquiry." Chicago & Southern Air Lines, 333 U. S., at 111. That is, although it is appropriate for the Court to determine the judicial question whether the President has the asserted
authority, see, e. g., Ex parte Endo, supra, we lack the information and expertise to question whether Hamdi is actually
an enemy combatant, a question the resolution of which is

committed to other branches.1 In the words of then-Judge
Scalia:

"In Old Testament days, when judges ruled the people
of Israel and led them into battle, a court professing the
belief that it could order a halt to a military operation
in foreign lands might not have been a startling phenomenon. But in modern times, and in a country where
such governmental functions have been committed to
elected delegates of the people, such an assertion of
jurisdiction is extraordinary. The [C]ourt's decision
today reflects a willingness to extend judicial power into
areas where we do not know, and have no way of finding
out, what serious harm we may be doing." Ramirez
de Arellano v. Weinberger, 745 F. 2d 1500, 1550-1551
(CADC 1984) (dissenting opinion) (footnote omitted).

See also id., at 1551, n. 1 (noting that "[e]ven the ancient
Israelites eventually realized the shortcomings of judicial
commanders-in-chief "). The decision whether someone is
an enemy combatant is, no doubt, "delicate, complex, and involv[es] large elements of prophecy," Chicago & Southern
Air Lines, supra, at 111, which, incidentally might in part
explain why "the Government has never provided any court
with the full criteria that it uses in classifying individuals as
such," ante, at 516. See also infra, at 597-598 (discussing
other military decisions).

e. g., Quirin, 317 U. S., at
28-29, 30-31; id., at 37-39; Duncan v. Kahanamoku, 327U. S. 304, 313-314 (1946); W. Winthrop, Military Law and

Precedents 788 (rev. 2d ed. 1920); W. Whiting, War Powers
Under the Constitution of the United States 167 (43d ed.
1871); id., at 44-46 (noting that Civil War "rebels" may be
treated as foreign belligerents); see also ante, at 518-519.

Although the President very well may have inherent authority to detain those arrayed against our troops, I agree
with the plurality that we need not decide that question because Congress has authorized the President to do so. See
ante, at 517. The Authorization for Use of Military Force
(AUMF), 115 Stat. 224, authorizes the President to "use all
necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized,
committed, or aided the terrorist attacks" of September 11,
2001. Indeed, the Court has previously concluded that language materially identical to the AUMF authorizes the Executive to "make the ordinary use of the soldiers . . . ; that
he may kill persons who resist and, of course, that he may
use the milder measure of seizing [and detaining] the bodies
of those whom he considers to stand in the way of restoring
peace." Moyer v. Peabody, 212 U. S. 78, 84 (1909).

The plurality, however, qualifies its recognition of the
President's authority to detain enemy combatants in the war
on terrorism in ways that are at odds with our precedent.
Thus, the plurality relies primarily on Article 118 of the Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners

No. 3364, for the proposition that "[i]t is a clearly established
principle of the law of war that detention may last no longer
than active hostilities." Ante, at 520. It then appears to
limit the President's authority to detain by requiring that
"the record establis[h] that United States troops are still involved in active combat in Afghanistan" because, in that
case, detention would be "part of the exercise of `necessary
and appropriate force.' " Ante, at 521. But I do not believe
that we may diminish the Federal Government's war powers
by reference to a treaty and certainly not to a treaty that
does not apply. See n. 6, infra. Further, we are bound by
the political branches' determination that the United States
is at war. See, e. g., Ludecke v. Watkins, 335 U. S. 160, 167-
170 (1948); Prize Cases, 2 Black, at 670; Mott, 12 Wheat., at
30. And, in any case, the power to detain does not end with
the cessation of formal hostilities. See, e. g., Madsen v.
Kinsella, 343 U. S. 341, 360 (1952); Johnson v. Eisentrager,
339 U. S. 763, 786 (1950); cf. Moyer, supra, at 85.

Accordingly, the President's action here is "supported by
the strongest of presumptions and the widest latitude of judicial interpretation." Dames & Moore, 453 U. S., at 668 (internal quotation marks omitted).2 The question becomes
whether the Federal Government (rather than the President
acting alone) has power to detain Hamdi as an enemy combatant. More precisely, we must determine whether the
Government may detain Hamdi given the procedures that
were used.

2 It could be argued that the habeas statutes are evidence of congressional intent that enemy combatants are entitled to challenge the factual
basis for the Government's determination. See, e. g., 28 U. S. C. $$ 2243,
2246. But factual development is needed only to the extent necessary to
resolve the legal challenge to the detention. See, e. g., Walker v. Johnston, 312 U. S. 275, 284 (1941).

III
I agree with the plurality that the Federal Government
has power to detain those that the Executive Branch determines to be enemy combatants. See ante, at 518. But I
do not think that the plurality has adequately explained the
breadth of the President's authority to detain enemy combatants, an authority that includes making virtually conclusive
factual findings. In my view, the structural considerations
discussed above, as recognized in our precedent, demonstrate that we lack the capacity and responsibility to secondguess this determination.

This makes complete sense once the process that is due
Hamdi is made clear. As an initial matter, it is possible that
the Due Process Clause requires only "that our Government
must proceed according to the `law of the land'--that is, according to written constitutional and statutory provisions."
In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 382 (1970) (Black, J., dissenting).
I need not go this far today because the Court has already
explained the nature of due process in this context.

In a case strikingly similar to this one, the Court addressed a Governor's authority to detain for an extended period a person the executive believed to be responsible, in
part, for a local insurrection. Justice Holmes wrote for a
unanimous Court:

"When it comes to a decision by the head of the State
upon a matter involving its life, the ordinary rights of
individuals must yield to what he deems the necessities
of the moment. Public danger warrants the substitution of executive process for judicial process. This was
admitted with regard to killing men in the actual clash
of arms, and we think it obvious, although it was disputed, that the same is true of temporary detention to
prevent apprehended harm." Moyer, 212 U. S., at 85
(citation omitted; emphasis added).

590 HAMDI v. RUMSFELD

Thomas, J., dissenting
The Court answered Moyer's claim that he had been denied
due process by emphasizing:

"[I]t is familiar that what is due process of law depends
on circumstances. It varies with the subject-matter
and the necessities of the situation. Thus summary
proceedings suffice for taxes, and executive decisions for
exclusion from the country. . . . Such arrests are not necessarily for punishment, but are by way of precaution to
prevent the exercise of hostile power." Id., at 84-85
(citations omitted).

In this context, due process requires nothing more than a
good-faith executive determination.3 To be clear: The Court
has held that an Executive, acting pursuant to statutory and
constitutional authority, may, consistent with the Due Process Clause, unilaterally decide to detain an individual if the
Executive deems this necessary for the public safety even if
he is mistaken.

Moyer is not an exceptional case. In Luther v. Borden, 7
How. 1 (1849), the Court discussed the President's constitutional and statutory authority, in response to a request from
a state legislature or executive, " `to call forth such number
of the militia of any other State or States, as may be applied
for, as he may judge sufficient to suppress [an] insurrection.' "
Id., at 43 (quoting Act of Feb. 28, 1795). The Court explained that courts could not review the President's decision
to recognize one of the competing legislatures or executives.
See 7 How., at 43. If a court could second-guess this determination, "it would become the duty of the court (provided
it came to the conclusion that the President had decided incorrectly) to discharge those who were arrested or detained

3 Indeed, it is not even clear that the Court required good faith. See
Moyer, 212 U. S., at 85 ("It is not alleged that [the Governor's] judgment
was not honest, if that be material, or that [Moyer] was detained after
fears of the insurrection were at an end").

by the troops in the service of the United States." Ibid.
"If the judicial power extends so far," the Court concluded,
"the guarantee contained in the Constitution of the United
States [referring to Art. IV, $ 4] is a guarantee of anarchy,
and not of order." Ibid. The Court clearly contemplated
that the President had authority to detain as he deemed necessary, and such detentions evidently comported with the
Due Process Clause as long as the President correctly decided to call forth the militia, a question the Court said it
could not review.

The Court also addressed the natural concern that placing
"this power in the President is dangerous to liberty, and may
be abused." Id., at 44. The Court noted that "[a]ll power
may be abused if placed in unworthy hands," and explained
that "it would be difficult . . . to point out any other hands
in which this power would be more safe, and at the same
time equally effectual. " Ibid. Putting that aside, the
Court emphasized that this power "is conferred upon him by
the Constitution and laws of the United States, and must
therefore be respected and enforced in its judicial tribunals."
Ibid. Finally, the Court explained that if the President
abused this power "it would be in the power of Congress to
apply the proper remedy. But the courts must administer
the law as they find it." Id., at 45.

Almost 140 years later, in United States v. Salerno, 481
U. S. 739, 748 (1987), the Court explained that the Due Process Clause "lays down [no] categorical imperative." The
Court continued:

"We have repeatedly held that the Government's regulatory interest in community safety can, in appropriate
circumstances, outweigh an individual's liberty interest.
For example, in times of war or insurrection, when society's interest is at its peak, the Government may detain
individuals whom the Government believes to be dangerous." Ibid.

592 HAMDI v. RUMSFELD

Thomas, J., dissenting
The Court cited Ludecke v. Watkins, 335 U. S. 160 (1948), for
this latter proposition even though Ludecke actually involved
detention of enemy aliens. See also Selective Draft Law
Cases, 245 U. S. 366 (1918); Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197
U. S. 11, 27-29 (1905) (upholding legislated mass vaccinations
and approving of forced quarantines of Americans even if
they show no signs of illness); cf. Kansas v. Hendricks, 521
U. S. 346 (1997); Juragua Iron Co. v. United States, 212 U. S.
297 (1909).

The Government's asserted authority to detain an individual that the President has determined to be an enemy combatant, at least while hostilities continue, comports with the
Due Process Clause. As these cases also show, the Executive's decision that a detention is necessary to protect the
public need not and should not be subjected to judicial
second-guessing. Indeed, at least in the context of enemycombatant determinations, this would defeat the unity, secrecy, and dispatch that the Founders believed to be so important to the warmaking function. See Part I, supra.

I therefore cannot agree with Justice Scalia's conclusion
that the Government must choose between using standard
criminal processes and suspending the writ. See ante, at
578 (dissenting opinion). Justice Scalia relies heavily
upon Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2 (1866), see ante, at 567-
568, 570-572, and three cases decided by New York state
courts in the wake of the War of 1812, see ante, at 565-566.
I admit that Milligan supports his position. But because
the Executive Branch there, unlike here, did not follow a
specific statutory mechanism provided by Congress, the
Court did not need to reach the broader question of Congress' power, and its discussion on this point was arguably
dicta, see 4 Wall., at 122, as four Justices believed, see id., at
132, 134-136 (Chase, C. J., joined by Wayne, Swayne, and
Miller, JJ., concurring in judgment).

More importantly, the Court referred frequently and pervasively to the criminal nature of the proceedings instituted

542US2 Unit: $U75 [11-01-06 18:26:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

593Cite as: 542 U. S. 507 (2004)
Thomas, J., dissenting
against Milligan. In fact, this feature serves to distinguishthe state cases as well. See

In re Stacy, 10 Johns. *328,
*334 (N. Y. 1813) ("A military commander is here assum-ing

criminal jurisdiction over a private citizen" (emphasis
added)); Smith v. Shaw, 12 Johns. *257, *265 (N. Y. 1815)(Shaw "might be amenable to the civil authority for treason;

but could not be punished, under martial law, as a spy" (emphasis added)); M'Connell v. Hampton, 12 Johns. *234 (N. Y.1815) (same for treason).

Although I do acknowledge that the reasoning of thesecases might apply beyond criminal punishment, the
punishment-nonpunishment distinction harmonizes all of theprecedent. And, subsequent cases have at least implicitly
distinguished Milligan in just this way. See, e. g., Moyer,212 U. S., at 84-85 ("Such arrests are not necessarily for punishment, but are by way of precaution"). Finally, Quirinoverruled

Milligan to the extent that those cases are inconsistent. See Quirin, 317 U. S., at 45 (limiting Milligan toits facts). Because the Government does not detain Hamdi

in order to punish him, as the plurality acknowledges, see
ante, at 518-519, Milligan and the New York cases do notcontrol.

Justice Scalia also finds support in a letter Thomas Jefferson wrote to James Madison. See ante, at 564. I agree
that this provides some evidence for his position. But I
think this plainly insufficient to rebut the authorities upon
which I have relied. In any event, I do not believe that
Justice Scalia's evidence leads to the necessary "clear conviction that [the detention is] in conflict with the Constitution
or laws of Congress constitutionally enacted," Quirin, supra,
at 25, to justify nullifying the President's wartime action.

Finally, Justice Scalia's position raises an additional concern. Justice Scalia apparently does not disagree that
the Federal Government has all power necessary to protect
the Nation. If criminal processes do not suffice, however,
Justice Scalia would require Congress to suspend the
writ. See ante, at 577-578. But the fact that the writ may

Thomas, J., dissenting
not be suspended "unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Inva-sion the public Safety may require it," Art. I, $ 9, cl. 2, poses

two related problems. First, this condition might not obtainhere or during many other emergencies during which this
detention authority might be necessary. Congress wouldthen have to choose between acting unconstitutionally

4 and

depriving the President of the tools he needs to protect theNation. Second, I do not see how suspension would make

constitutional otherwise unconstitutional detentions orderedby the President. It simply removes a remedy.

Justice
Scalia's position might therefore require one or both of thepolitical branches to act unconstitutionally in order to protect the Nation. But the power to protect the Nation mustbe the power to do so lawfully.

Accordingly, I conclude that the Government's detentionof Hamdi as an enemy combatant does not violate the Constitution. By detaining Hamdi, the President, in the prosecu-tion of a war and authorized by Congress, has acted well
within his authority. Hamdi thereby received all the proc-ess to which he was due under the circumstances. I therefore believe that this is no occasion to balance the competinginterests, as the plurality unconvincingly attempts to do.

IV
Although I do not agree with the plurality that the balanc-ing approach of Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319 (1976), is

the appropriate analytical tool with which to analyze thiscase,

5 I cannot help but explain that the plurality misapplies

its chosen framework, one that if applied correctly wouldprobably lead to the result I have reached. The plurality

devotes two paragraphs to its discussion of the Government'sinterest, though much of those two paragraphs explain why
the Government's concerns are misplaced. See ante, at 531-

4 I agree with Justice Scalia that this Court could not review Congress' decision to suspend the writ. See ante, at 577-578.

532. But: "It is `obvious and unarguable' that no govern-mental interest is more compelling than the security of the

Nation." Agee, 453 U. S., at 307 (quoting Aptheker, 378U. S., at 509). In

Moyer, the Court recognized the paramount importance of the Governor's interest in the tran-quility of a Colorado town. At issue here is the far more

significant interest of the security of the Nation. The Government seeks to further that interest by detaining an enemysoldier not only to prevent him from rejoining the ongoing

fight. Rather, as the Government explains, detention canserve to gather critical intelligence regarding the intentions
and capabilities of our adversaries, a function that the Government avers has become all the more important in the war
on terrorism. See Brief for Respondents 15; App. 347-351.

Additional process, the Government explains, will destroy
the intelligence gathering function. Brief for Respondents
43-45. It also does seem quite likely that, under the process
envisioned by the plurality, various military officials will
have to take time to litigate this matter. And though the
plurality does not say so, a meaningful ability to challenge
the Government's factual allegations will probably require
the Government to divulge highly classified information to
the purported enemy combatant, who might then upon release return to the fight armed with our most closely held
secrets.

The plurality manages to avoid these problems by discounting or entirely ignoring them. After spending a few
sentences putatively describing the Government's interests,
the plurality simply assures the Government that the alleged
burdens "are properly taken into account in our due process
analysis." Ante, at 532. The plurality also announces that
"the risk of an erroneous deprivation of a detainee's liberty
interest is unacceptably high under the Government's proposed rule." Ante, at 532-533 (internal quotation marks
omitted). But there is no particular reason to believe that
the federal courts have the relevant information and exper542US2 Unit: $U75 [11-01-06 18:26:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tise to make this judgment. And for the reasons discussedin Part I, supra, there is every reason to think that courts

cannot and should not make these decisions.The plurality next opines that "[w]e think it unlikely that
this basic process will have the dire impact on the centralfunctions of warmaking that the Government forecasts."
Ante, at 534. Apparently by limiting hearings "to the al-leged combatant's acts," such hearings "meddl[e] little, if at
all, in the strategy or conduct of war." Ante, at 535. Ofcourse, the meaning of the combatant's acts may become
clear only after quite invasive and extensive inquiry. Andagain, the federal courts are simply not situated to make
these judgments.Ultimately, the plurality's dismissive treatment of the Government's asserted interests arises from its apparent beliefthat enemy-combatant determinations are not part of "the
actual prosecution of a war," ibid., or one of the "centralfunctions of warmaking,"

ante, at 534. This seems wrong:Taking
and holding enemy combatants is a quintessentialaspect of the prosecution of war. See, e. g., ante, at 518-519;

Quirin, 317 U. S., at 28. Moreover, this highlights seriousdifficulties in applying the plurality's balancing approach
here. First, in the war context, we know neither thestrength of the Government's interests nor the costs of imposing additional process.Second, it is at least difficult to explain why the result
should be different for other military operations that the plu-rality would ostensibly recognize as "central functions of
warmaking." As the plurality recounts:

"Parties whose rights are to be affected are entitled tobe heard; and in order that they may enjoy that right

they must first be notified. It is equally fundamentalthat the right to notice and an opportunity to be heard
must be granted at a meaningful time and in a meaning-ful manner."

Thomas, J., dissenting
See also ibid. ("notice" of the Government's factual asser-tions and "a fair opportunity to rebut [those] assertions before a neutral decisionmaker" are essential elements of dueprocess). Because a decision to bomb a particular target
might extinguish life interests, the plurality's analysis seemsto require notice to potential targets. To take one more example, in November 2002, a Central Intelligence Agency(CIA) Predator drone fired a Hellfire missile at a vehicle in
Yemen carrying an al Qaeda leader, a citizen of the UnitedStates, and four others. See Priest, CIA Killed U. S. Citizen
In Yemen Missile Strike, Washington Post, Nov. 8, 2002,p. A1. It is not clear whether the CIA knew that an American was in the vehicle. But the plurality's due processwould seem to require notice and opportunity to respond
here as well. Cf. Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U. S. 1 (1985). Ioffer these examples not because I think the plurality would
demand additional process in these situations but because itclearly would not. The result here should be the same.

I realize that many military operations are, in some sense,necessary. But many, if not most, are merely expedient, and
I see no principled distinction between the military opera-tion the plurality condemns today (the holding of an enemy
combatant based on the process given Hamdi) from a varietyof other military operations. In truth, I doubt that there is
any sensible, bright-line distinction. It could be argued thatbombings and missile strikes are an inherent part of war,
and as long as our forces do not violate the laws of war, it isof no constitutional moment that civilians might be killed.
But this does not serve to distinguish this case because it isalso consistent with the laws of war to detain enemy combatants exactly as the Government has detained Hamdi.6 This,in fact, bolsters my argument in Part III to the extent that

6 Hamdi's detention comports with the laws of war, including the Geneva
Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12,
1949, [1955] 6 U. S. T. 3406, T. I. A. S. No. 3364. See Brief for Respondents 22-24.

Thomas, J., dissenting
the laws of war show that the power to detain is part of asovereign's war powers.

Undeniably, Hamdi has been deprived of a serious interest,one actually protected by the Due Process Clause. Against
this, however, is the Government's overriding interest inprotecting the Nation. If a deprivation of liberty can be
justified by the need to protect a town, the protection of theNation,

a fortiori, justifies it.I acknowledge that under the plurality's approach, it

might, at times, be appropriate to give detainees access tocounsel and notice of the factual basis for the Government's
determination. See ante, at 532-533. But properly ac-counting for the Government's interests also requires concluding that access to counsel and to the factual basis wouldnot always be warranted. Though common sense suffices,
the Government thoroughly explains that counsel wouldoften destroy the intelligence gathering function. See Brief
for Respondents 42-43. See also App. 347-351 (affidavit ofCol. D. Woolfolk). Equally obvious is the Government's interest in not fighting the war in its own courts, see, e. g.,
Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S., at 779, and protecting clas-sified information, see,

e. g., Department of Navy v. Egan,
484 U. S. 518, 527 (1988) (President's "authority to classifyand control access to information bearing on national security and to determine" who gets access "flows primarily from[the Commander in Chief Clause] and exists quite apart from
any explicit congressional grant"); Agee, 453 U. S., at 307 (up-holding revocation of former CIA employee's passport in
large part by reference to the Government's need "to protectthe secrecy of [its] foreign intelligence operations").

7 These observations cast still more doubt on the appropriateness and
usefulness of Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319 (1976), in this context.
It is, for example, difficult to see how the plurality can insist that Hamdi
unquestionably has the right to access to counsel in connection with the
proceedings on remand, when new information could become available to
the Government showing that such access would pose a grave risk to na542US2 Unit: $U75 [11-01-06 18:26:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

that hearing would itself pose a grave threat?

MISSOURI v. SEIBERT
certiorari to the supreme court of missouri
No. 02-1371. Argued December 9, 2003--Decided June 28, 2004
Respondent Seibert feared charges of neglect when her son, afflicted with

cerebral palsy, died in his sleep. She was present when two of her sons
and their friends discussed burning her family's mobile home to conceal
the circumstances of her son's death. Donald, an unrelated mentally ill
18-year-old living with the family, was left to die in the fire, in order to
avoid the appearance that Seibert's son had been unattended. Five
days later, the police arrested Seibert, but did not read her her rights
under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436. At the police station, Officer
Hanrahan questioned her for 30 to 40 minutes, obtaining a confession
that the plan was for Donald to die in the fire. He then gave her a
20-minute break, returned to give her Miranda warnings, and obtained
a signed waiver. He resumed questioning, confronting Seibert with her
prewarning statements and getting her to repeat the information.
Seibert moved to suppress both her prewarning and postwarning statements. Hanrahan testified that he made a conscious decision to withhold Miranda warnings, question first, then give the warnings, and then
repeat the question until he got the answer previously given. The District Court suppressed the prewarning statement but admitted the postwarning one, and Seibert was convicted of second-degree murder. The
Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed, finding the case indistinguishable
from Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298, in which this Court held that a
suspect's unwarned inculpatory statement made during a brief exchange
at his house did not make a later, fully warned inculpatory statement
inadmissible. In reversing, the State Supreme Court held that, because
the interrogation was nearly continuous, the second statement, which
was clearly the product of the invalid first statement, should be suppressed; and distinguished Elstad on the ground that the warnings had
not intentionally been withheld there.

Held: The judgment is affirmed.
93 S. W. 3d 700, affirmed.

Justice Souter, joined by Justice Stevens, Justice Ginsburg,
and Justice Breyer, concluded that, because the midstream recitation
of warnings after interrogation and unwarned confession in this case
could not comply with Miranda's constitutional warning requirement,
Seibert's postwarning statements are inadmissible. Pp. 607-617.

(a) Failure to give Miranda warnings and obtain a waiver of rights
before custodial questioning generally requires exclusion of any statements obtained. Conversely, giving the warnings and getting a waiver
generally produces a virtual ticket of admissibility, with most litigation
over voluntariness ending with valid waiver finding. This common consequence would not be at all common unless Miranda warnings were
customarily given under circumstances that reasonably suggest a real
choice between talking and not talking. Pp. 607-609.

(b) Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, reaffirmed Miranda,
holding that Miranda's constitutional character prevailed against a federal statute that sought to restore the old regime of giving no warnings
and litigating most statements' voluntariness. The technique of interrogating in successive, unwarned and warned phases raises a new challenge to Miranda. Pp. 609-611.

(c) When a confession so obtained is offered and challenged, attention
must be paid to the conflicting objects of Miranda and the question-first
strategy. Miranda addressed "interrogation practices . . . likely . . . to
disable [an individual] from making a free and rational choice" about
speaking, 384 U. S., at 464-465, and held that a suspect must be "adequately and effectively" advised of the choice the Constitution guarantees, id., at 467. Question-first's object, however, is to render Miranda
warnings ineffective by waiting to give them until after the suspect has
already confessed. The threshold question in this situation is whether
it would be reasonable to find that the warnings could function "effectively" as Miranda requires. There is no doubt about the answer. By
any objective measure, it is likely that warnings withheld until after
interrogation and confession will be ineffective in preparing a suspect
for successive interrogation, close in time and similar in content. The
manifest purpose of question-first is to get a confession the suspect
would not make if he understood his rights at the outset. When the
warnings are inserted in the midst of coordinated and continuing interrogation, they are likely to mislead and "deprive a defendant of knowledge essential to his ability to understand the nature of his rights and
the consequences of abandoning them." Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S.
412, 424. And it would be unrealistic to treat two spates of integrated
and proximately conducted questioning as independent interrogations
subject to independent evaluation simply because Miranda warnings
formally punctuate them in the middle. Pp. 611-614.

(d) Elstad does not authorize admission of a confession repeated
under the question-first strategy. The contrast between Elstad and
this case reveals relevant facts bearing on whether midstream Miranda
warnings could be effective to accomplish their object: the completeness
and detail of the questions and answers to the first round of questioning,

602 MISSOURI v. SEIBERT

Syllabus
the two statements' overlapping content, the timing and setting of the
first and second rounds, the continuity of police personnel, and the degree to which the interrogator's questions treated the second round as
continuous with the first. In Elstad, the station house questioning
could sensibly be seen as a distinct experience from a short conversation
at home, and thus the Miranda warnings could have made sense as
presenting a genuine choice whether to follow up on the earlier admission. Here, however, the unwarned interrogation was conducted in the
station house, and the questioning was systematic, exhaustive, and managed with psychological skill. The warned phase proceeded after only
a 15-to-20 minute pause, in the same place and with the same officer,
who did not advise Seibert that her prior statement could not be used
against her. These circumstances challenge the comprehensibility and
efficacy of the Miranda warnings to the point that a reasonable person
in the suspect's shoes could not have understood them to convey a message that she retained a choice about continuing to talk. Pp. 614-617.

Justice Kennedy concluded that when a two-step interrogation
technique is used, postwarning statements related to prewarning statements must be excluded unless curative measures are taken before the
postwarning statement is made. Not every violation of Miranda v.
Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, requires suppression of the evidence obtained.
Admission may be proper when it would further important objectives
without compromising Miranda's central concerns. See, e. g., Harris v.
New York, 401 U. S. 222. Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298, reflects a
balanced and pragmatic approach to enforcing the Miranda warning.
An officer may not realize that a suspect is in custody and warnings are
required, and may not plan to question the suspect or may be waiting
for a more appropriate time. Suppressing postwarning statements
under such circumstances would serve "neither the general goal of deterring improper police conduct nor the Fifth Amendment goal of assuring trustworthy evidence." Elstad, supra, at 308. In contrast, the
technique used in this case distorts Miranda's meaning and furthers no
legitimate countervailing interest. The warning was withheld to obscure both the practical and legal significance of the admonition when
finally given. That the interrogating officer relied on respondent's prewarning statement to obtain the postwarning one used at trial shows
the temptations for abuse inherent in the two-step technique. Reference to the prewarning statement was an implicit, and false, suggestion
that the mere repetition of the earlier statement was not independently
incriminating. The Miranda rule would be frustrated were the police
permitted to undermine its meaning and effect. However, the plurality's test--that whenever a two-stage interview occurs, the postwarning
statement's admissibility depends on whether the midstream warnings

could have been effective enough to accomplish their object given the
case's specific facts--cuts too broadly. The admissibility of postwarning
statements should continue to be governed by Elstad's principles unless
the deliberate two-step strategy is employed. Then, the postwarning
statements must be excluded unless curative measures are taken before
they were made. Such measures should be designed to ensure that a
reasonable person in the suspect's situation would understand the import and effect of the Miranda warning and waiver. For example, a
substantial break in time and circumstances between the prewarning
statement and the warning may suffice in most instances, as may an
additional warning explaining the likely inadmissibility of the prewarning statement. Because no curative steps were taken in this case,
the postwarning statements are inadmissible and the conviction cannot
stand. Pp. 618-622.

604 MISSOURI v. SEIBERT

Opinion of Souter, J.
Justice Souter announced the judgment of the Courtand delivered an opinion, in which

Justice Stevens, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join.

This case tests a police protocol for custodial interrogationthat calls for giving no warnings of the rights to silence and

counsel until interrogation has produced a confession. Al-though such a statement is generally inadmissible, since
taken in violation of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436(1966), the interrogating officer follows it with

Mirandawarnings and then leads the suspect to cover the same

ground a second time. The question here is the admissi-bility of the repeated statement. Because this midstream
recitation of warnings after interrogation and unwarned con-fession could not effectively comply with

Miranda's constitu-tional requirement, we hold that a statement repeated after

a warning in such circumstances is inadmissible.

I
Respondent Patrice Seibert's 12-year-old son Jonathan hadcerebral palsy, and when he died in his sleep she feared

charges of neglect because of bedsores on his body. In herpresence, two of her teenage sons and two of their friends
devised a plan to conceal the facts surrounding Jonathan'sdeath by incinerating his body in the course of burning the
family's mobile home, in which they planned to leave DonaldRector, a mentally ill teenager living with the family, to
avoid any appearance that Jonathan had been unattended.Seibert's son Darian and a friend set the fire, and Donald
died.Five days later, the police awakened Seibert at 3 a.m. at
a hospital where Darian was being treated for burns. Inarresting her, Officer Kevin Clinton followed instructions
from Rolla, Missouri, Officer Richard Hanrahan that he re-frain from giving Miranda warnings. After Seibert had
been taken to the police station and left alone in an interviewroom for 15 to 20 minutes, Officer Hanrahan questioned her

Opinion of Souter, J.
without Miranda warnings for 30 to 40 minutes, squeezingher arm and repeating "Donald was also to die in his sleep."

App. 59 (internal quotation marks omitted). After Seibertfinally admitted she knew Donald was meant to die in the
fire, she was given a 20-minute coffee and cigarette break.Officer Hanrahan then turned on a tape recorder, gave
Seibert the Miranda warnings, and obtained a signed waiverof rights from her. He resumed the questioning with "Ok,
'trice, we've been talking for a little while about what hap-pened on Wednesday the twelfth, haven't we?" App. 66, and
confronted her with her prewarning statements:

Hanrahan: "Now, in discussion you told us, you told usthat there was a[n] understanding about Donald."

Seibert: "Yes."
Hanrahan: "Did that take place earlier that morning?"
Seibert: "Yes."
Hanrahan: "And what was the understanding aboutDonald?"

Seibert: "If they could get him out of the trailer, to takehim out of the trailer."
Hanrahan: "And if they couldn't?"
Seibert: "I, I never even thought about it. I just fig-ured they would."

Hanrahan: " 'Trice, didn't you tell me that he was sup-posed to die in his sleep?"
Seibert: "If that would happen, 'cause he was on thatnew medicine, you know . . . ."
Hanrahan: "The Prozac? And it makes him sleepy. Sohe was supposed to die in his sleep?"
Seibert: "Yes." Id., at 70.
After being charged with first-degree murder for her rolein Donald's death, Seibert sought to exclude both her prewarning and postwarning statements. At the suppressionhearing, Officer Hanrahan testified that he made a "conscious

decision" to withhold Miranda warnings, thus resorting toan interrogation technique he had been taught: question first,

then give the warnings, and then repeat the question "untilI get the answer that she's already provided once." App.
31-34. He acknowledged that Seibert's ultimate statementwas "largely a repeat of information . . . obtained" prior to
the warning. Id., at 30.

The trial court suppressed the prewarning statement butadmitted the responses given after the

Miranda recitation.
A jury convicted Seibert of second-degree murder. On ap-peal, the Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed, treating this

case as indistinguishable from Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S.
298 (1985). No. 23729, 2002 WL 114804 (Jan. 30, 2002) (not
released for publication).

The Supreme Court of Missouri reversed, holding that
"[i]n the circumstances here, where the interrogation was
nearly continuous, . . . the second statement, clearly the
product of the invalid first statement, should have been suppressed." 93 S. W. 3d 700, 701 (2002) (en banc). The court
distinguished Elstad on the ground that warnings had not
intentionally been withheld there, 93 S. W. 3d, at 704, and
reasoned that "Officer Hanrahan's intentional omission of a
Miranda warning was intended to deprive Seibert of the opportunity knowingly and intelligently to waive her Miranda
rights," id., at 706. Since there were "no circumstances that
would seem to dispel the effect of the Miranda violation,"
the court held that the postwarning confession was involuntary and therefore inadmissible. Ibid. To allow the police
to achieve an "end run" around Miranda, the court explained, would encourage Miranda violations and diminish
Miranda's role in protecting the privilege against selfincrimination. 93 S. W. 3d, at 706-707. Three judges dissented, taking the view that Elstad applied even though the
police intentionally withheld Miranda warnings before the
initial statement, and believing that "Seibert's unwarned responses to Officer Hanrahan's questioning did not prevent

We granted certiorari, 538 U. S. 1031 (2003), to resolve asplit in the Courts of Appeals. Compare United States v.
Gale, 952 F. 2d 1412, 1418 (CADC 1992) (while "deliberate`end run' around Miranda" would provide cause for suppression, case involved no conduct of that order); United Statesv.

Carter, 884 F. 2d 368, 373 (CA8 1989) ("Elstad did not goso far as to fashion a rule permitting this sort of end run

that "tainted fruit" analysis applies because deliberate with-holding of Miranda warnings constitutes an "improper tactic"); United States v. Esquilin, 208 F. 3d 315, 319-321 (CA12000) (similar). We now affirm.

"In criminal trials, in the courts of the United States,wherever a question arises whether a confession is incompetent because not voluntary, the issue is controlled by thatportion of the Fifth Amendment . . . commanding that no
person `shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a wit-ness against himself.' " Bram v. United States, 168 U. S.
532, 542 (1897). A parallel rule governing the admissibilityof confessions in state courts emerged from the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, see, e. g., Brown v.
Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278 (1936), which governed state casesuntil we concluded in Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 8 (1964),

that "[t]he Fourteenth Amendment secures against state in-vasion the same privilege that the Fifth Amendment guarantees against federal infringement--the right of a person toremain silent unless he chooses to speak in the unfettered
exercise of his own will, and to suffer no penalty . . . for suchsilence." In unifying the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment
voluntariness tests, Malloy "made clear what had alreadybecome apparent--that the substantive and procedural safe542US2 Unit: $U76 [10-30-06 07:06:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

guards surrounding admissibility of confessions in statecases had become exceedingly exacting, reflecting all the policies embedded in the privilege" against self-incrimination.Miranda, 384 U. S., at 464.

In Miranda, we explained that the "voluntariness doctrinein the state cases . . . encompasses all interrogation practices
which are likely to exert such pressure upon an individual asto disable him from making a free and rational choice,"

id.,at 464-465. We appreciated the difficulty of judicial enquiry

post hoc into the circumstances of a police interrogation,Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 444 (2000), and
recognized that "the coercion inherent in custodial interroga-tion blurs the line between voluntary and involuntary statements, and thus heightens the risk" that the privilegeagainst self-incrimination will not be observed, id., at 435.
Hence our concern that the "traditional totality-of-the-circumstances" test posed an "unacceptably great" risk that
involuntary custodial confessions would escape detection.
Id., at 442.Accordingly, "to reduce the risk of a coerced confession

and to implement the Self-Incrimination Clause," Chavez v.Martinez, 538 U. S. 760, 790 (2003) (K

ennedy, J., concurringin part and dissenting in part), this Court in

Miranda con-cluded that "the accused must be adequately and effectively

apprised of his rights and the exercise of those rights mustbe fully honored," 384 U. S., at 467. Miranda conditioned
the admissibility at trial of any custodial confession on warn-ing a suspect of his rights: failure to give the prescribed
warnings and obtain a waiver of rights before custodial ques-tioning generally requires exclusion of any statements obtained.1 Conversely, giving the warnings and getting a

the burden of proving, at least by a preponderance of the evidence, the
Miranda waiver, Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U. S. 157, 169 (1986), and the
voluntariness of the confession, Lego v. Twomey, 404 U. S. 477, 489 (1972).

waiver has generally produced a virtual ticket of admissibil-ity; maintaining that a statement is involuntary even though

given after warnings and voluntary waiver of rights requiresunusual stamina, and litigation over voluntariness tends
to end with the finding of a valid waiver. See Berkemer v.McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 433, n. 20 (1984) ("[C]ases in which
a defendant can make a colorable argument that a self-incriminating statement was `compelled' despite the fact that
the law enforcement authorities adhered to the dictates of
Miranda are rare"). To point out the obvious, this commonconsequence would not be common at all were it not that

Miranda warnings are customarily given under circum-stances allowing for a real choice between talking and remaining silent. III

There are those, of course, who preferred the old way ofdoing things, giving no warnings and litigating the voluntariness of any statement in nearly every instance. In theaftermath of Miranda, Congress even passed a statute seeking to restore that old regime, 18 U. S. C. $ 3501, althoughthe Act lay dormant for years until finally invoked and challenged in Dickerson v. United States, supra. Dickerson re-affirmed Miranda and held that its constitutional character
prevailed against the statute.The technique of interrogating in successive, unwarned
and warned phases raises a new challenge to Miranda. Al-though we have no statistics on the frequency of this practice, it is not confined to Rolla, Missouri. An officer of thatpolice department testified that the strategy of withholding
Miranda warnings until after interrogating and drawing outa confession was promoted not only by his own department,
but by a national police training organization and other de-partments in which he had worked. App. 31-32. Consistently with the officer's testimony, the Police Law Institute,for example, instructs that "officers may conduct a two-stage
interrogation. . . . At any point during the pre-Miranda in542US2 Unit: $U76 [10-30-06 07:06:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

terrogation, usually after arrestees have confessed, officersmay then read the Miranda warnings and ask for a waiver.

If the arrestees waive their Miranda rights, officers will beable to repeat any subsequent incriminating statements later
in court." Police Law Institute, Illinois Police Law Manual83 (Jan. 2001-Dec. 2003) (available in Clerk of Court's case
file) (hereinafter Police Law Manual) (emphasis in original).2

2 Emphasizing the impeachment exception to the Miranda rule approved by this Court, Harris v. New York, 401 U. S. 222 (1971), some training programs advise officers to omit Miranda warnings altogether or to
continue questioning after the suspect invokes his rights. See, e. g., Police Law Manual 83 ("There is no need to give a Miranda warning before
asking questions if . . . the answers given . . . will not be required by the
prosecutor during the prosecution's case-in-chief "); California Commission
on Peace Officer Standards and Training, Video Training Programs for
California Law Enforcement, Miranda: Post-Invocation Questioning
(broadcast July 11, 1996) ("We . . . have been encouraging you to continue
to question a suspect after they've invoked their Miranda rights");
D. Zulawski & D. Wicklander, Practical Aspects of Interview and Interrogation 50-51 (2d ed. 2002) (describing the practice of "[b]eachheading" as
useful for impeachment purpose (emphasis deleted)); see also Weisselberg,
Saving Miranda, 84 Cornell L. Rev. 109, 110, 132-139 (1998) (collecting
California training materials encouraging questioning "outside Miranda").
This training is reflected in the reported cases involving deliberate questioning after invocation of Miranda rights. See, e. g., California Attorneys for Criminal Justice v. Butts, 195 F. 3d 1039, 1042-1044 (CA9 1999);
Henry v. Kernan, 197 F. 3d 1021, 1026 (CA9 1999); People v. Neal, 31 Cal.
4th 63, 68, 72 P. 3d 280, 282 (2003); People v. Peevy, 17 Cal. 4th 1184, 1189,
953 P. 2d 1212, 1215 (1998). Scholars have noted the growing trend of
such practices. See, e. g., Leo, Questioning the Relevance of Miranda in
the Twenty-First Century, 99 Mich. L. Rev. 1000, 1010 (2001); Weisselberg,
In the Stationhouse After Dickerson, 99 Mich. L. Rev. 1121, 1123-1154
(2001).

It is not the case, of course, that law enforcement educators en masse
are urging that Miranda be honored only in the breach. See, e. g., C.
O'Hara & G. O'Hara, Fundamentals of Criminal Investigation 133 (7th ed.
2003) (instructing police to give Miranda warnings before conducting custodial interrogation); F. Inbau, J. Reid, & J. Buckley, Criminal Interrogation and Confessions 221 (3d ed. 1986) (hereinafter Inbau, Reid, & Buckley) (same); J. Reid & Assoc., Interviewing & Interrogation: The Reid
Technique 61 (1991) (same). Most police manuals do not advocate
the question-first tactic, because they understand that Oregon v. Elstad,

Opinion of Souter, J.
The upshot of all this advice is a question-first practice ofsome popularity, as one can see from the reported cases describing its use, sometimes in obedience to departmentalpolicy.

IV
When a confession so obtained is offered and challenged,attention must be paid to the conflicting objects of

Mirandaand question-first. Miranda addressed "interrogation practices . . . likely . . . to disable [an individual] from making afree and rational choice" about speaking, 384 U. S., at 464-
465, and held that a suspect must be "adequately and effec-tively" advised of the choice the Constitution guarantees,

id.,at 467. The object of question-first is to render Miranda

warnings ineffective by waiting for a particularly opportunetime to give them, after the suspect has already confessed.

Just as "no talismanic incantation [is] required to satisfy[Miranda's] strictures," California v. Prysock, 453 U. S. 355,
359 (1981) (per curiam), it would be absurd to think thatmere recitation of the litany suffices to satisfy Miranda in
every conceivable circumstance. "The inquiry is simplywhether the warnings reasonably `conve[y] to [a suspect] his
rights as required by Miranda.' " Duckworth v. Eagan, 492U. S. 195, 203 (1989) (quoting

Prysock, supra, at 361). Thethreshold issue when interrogators question first and warn

later is thus whether it would be reasonable to find thatin these circumstances the warnings could function "effec470 U. S. 298 (1985), involved an officer's good-faith failure to warn. See,
e. g., Inbau, Reid, & Buckley 241 (Elstad's "facts as well as [its] specific
holding" instruct that "where an interrogator has failed to administer the
Miranda warnings in the mistaken belief that, under the circumstances
of the particular case, the warnings were not required, . . . corrective
measures . . . salvage an interrogation opportunity").

tively" as Miranda requires. Could the warnings effectively advise the suspect that he had a real choice about giving an admissible statement at that juncture? Could they
reasonably convey that he could choose to stop talking even
if he had talked earlier? For unless the warnings could
place a suspect who has just been interrogated in a position
to make such an informed choice, there is no practical justification for accepting the formal warnings as compliance with
Miranda, or for treating the second stage of interrogation as
distinct from the first, unwarned and inadmissible segment.4

There is no doubt about the answer that proponents of
question-first give to this question about the effectiveness of

4 Respondent Seibert argues that her second confession should be excluded from evidence under the doctrine known by the metaphor of the
"fruit of the poisonous tree," developed in the Fourth Amendment context
in Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U. S. 471 (1963): evidence otherwise
admissible but discovered as a result of an earlier violation is excluded as
tainted, lest the law encourage future violations. But the Court in Elstad
rejected the Wong Sun fruits doctrine for analyzing the admissibility of a
subsequent warned confession following "an initial failure . . . to administer the warnings required by Miranda." Elstad, 470 U. S., at 300. In
Elstad, "a simple failure to administer the warnings, unaccompanied by
any actual coercion or other circumstances calculated to undermine the
suspect's ability to exercise his free will," did not "so tain[t] the investigatory process that a subsequent voluntary and informed waiver is ineffective for some indeterminate period. Though Miranda requires that the
unwarned admission must be suppressed, the admissibility of any subsequent statement should turn in these circumstances solely on whether it
is knowingly and voluntarily made." Id., at 309. Elstad held that "a
suspect who has once responded to unwarned yet uncoercive questioning
is not thereby disabled from waiving his rights and confessing after he
has been given the requisite Miranda warnings." Id., at 318. In a sequential confession case, clarity is served if the later confession is approached by asking whether in the circumstances the Miranda warnings
given could reasonably be found effective. If yes, a court can take up the
standard issues of voluntary waiver and voluntary statement; if no, the
subsequent statement is inadmissible for want of adequate Miranda warnings, because the earlier and later statements are realistically seen as
parts of a single, unwarned sequence of questioning.

warnings given only after successful interrogation, and wethink their answer is correct. By any objective measure,

applied to circumstances exemplified here, it is likely that ifthe interrogators employ the technique of withholding warnings until after interrogation succeeds in eliciting a confes-sion, the warnings will be ineffective in preparing the suspect for successive interrogation, close in time and similar incontent. After all, the reason that question-first is catching
on is as obvious as its manifest purpose, which is to get aconfession the suspect would not make if he understood his
rights at the outset; the sensible underlying assumption isthat with one confession in hand before the warnings, the
interrogator can count on getting its duplicate, with triflingadditional trouble. Upon hearing warnings only in the aftermath of interrogation and just after making a confession,a suspect would hardly think he had a genuine right to remain silent, let alone persist in so believing once the policebegan to lead him over the same ground again.

5 A more

likely reaction on a suspect's part would be perplexity aboutthe reason for discussing rights at that point, bewilderment

being an unpromising frame of mind for knowledgeable deci-sion. What is worse, telling a suspect that "anything you
say can and will be used against you," without expressly ex-cepting the statement just given, could lead to an entirely
reasonable inference that what he has just said will be used,with subsequent silence being of no avail. Thus, when Miranda warnings are inserted in the midst of coordinated andcontinuing interrogation, they are likely to mislead and "de5 It bears emphasizing that the effectiveness Miranda assumes the
warnings can have must potentially extend through the repeated interrogation, since a suspect has a right to stop at any time. It seems highly
unlikely that a suspect could retain any such understanding when the interrogator leads him a second time through a line of questioning the suspect has already answered fully. The point is not that a later unknowing
or involuntary confession cancels out an earlier, adequate warning; the
point is that the warning is unlikely to be effective in the question-first
sequence we have described.

priv[e] a defendant of knowledge essential to his ability tounderstand the nature of his rights and the consequences of

abandoning them." Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 424(1986). By the same token, it would ordinarily be unrealistic to treat two spates of integrated and proximately con-ducted questioning as independent interrogations subject to
independent evaluation simply because Miranda warningsformally punctuate them in the middle.

V
Missouri argues that a confession repeated at the end ofan interrogation sequence envisioned in a question-first

strategy is admissible on the authority of Oregon v. Elstad,470 U. S. 298 (1985), but the argument disfigures that case.
In Elstad, the police went to the young suspect's house totake him into custody on a charge of burglary. Before the
arrest, one officer spoke with the suspect's mother, while theother one joined the suspect in a "brief stop in the living
room," id., at 315, where the officer said he "felt" the youngman was involved in a burglary,

id., at 301 (internal quota-tion marks omitted). The suspect acknowledged he had

been at the scene. Ibid. This Court noted that the pausein the living room "was not to interrogate the suspect but to
notify his mother of the reason for his arrest," id., at 315,and described the incident as having "none of the earmarks
of coercion," id., at 316. The Court, indeed, took care tomention that the officer's initial failure to warn was an "oversight" that "may have been the result of confusion as towhether the brief exchange qualified as `custodial interrogation' or . . . may simply have reflected . . . reluctance toinitiate an alarming police procedure before [an officer] had
spoken with respondent's mother." Id., at 315-316. At theoutset of a later and systematic station house interrogation
going well beyond the scope of the laconic prior admission,the suspect was given

Miranda warnings and made a fullconfession.
Elstad, supra, at 301, 314-315. In holding the

Opinion of Souter, J.
second statement admissible and voluntary, Elstad rejectedthe "cat out of the bag" theory that any short, earlier admission, obtained in arguably innocent neglect of Miranda, de-termined the character of the later, warned confession,

Elstad, 470 U. S., at 311-314; on the facts of that case, the Courtthought any causal connection between the first and second

responses to the police was "speculative and attenuated," id.,
at 313. Although the Elstad Court expressed no explicitconclusion about either officer's state of mind, it is fair to

read Elstad as treating the living room conversation as agood-faith

Miranda mistake, not only open to correction by
careful warnings before systematic questioning in that particular case, but posing no threat to warn-first practice generally. See Elstad, supra, at 309 (characterizing the officers'
omission of Miranda warnings as "a simple failure to administer the warnings, unaccompanied by any actual coercion or
other circumstances calculated to undermine the suspect's
ability to exercise his free will"); 470 U. S., at 318, n. 5 (Justice Brennan's concern in dissent that Elstad would invite
question-first practice "distorts the reasoning and holding of
our decision, but, worse, invites trial courts and prosecutors
to do the same").

The contrast between Elstad and this case reveals a series
of relevant facts that bear on whether Miranda warnings
delivered midstream could be effective enough to accomplish
their object: the completeness and detail of the questions and
answers in the first round of interrogation, the overlapping
content of the two statements, the timing and setting of the
first and the second, the continuity of police personnel, and
the degree to which the interrogator's questions treated the
second round as continuous with the first. In Elstad, it was
not unreasonable to see the occasion for questioning at the
station house as presenting a markedly different experience
from the short conversation at home; since a reasonable person in the suspect's shoes could have seen the station house
questioning as a new and distinct experience, the Miranda

Opinion of Souter, J.
warnings could have made sense as presenting a genuinechoice whether to follow up on the earlier admission.

At the opposite extreme are the facts here, which by anyobjective measure reveal a police strategy adapted to undermine the Miranda warnings.6 The unwarned interrogationwas conducted in the station house, and the questioning was
systematic, exhaustive, and managed with psychologicalskill. When the police were finished there was little, if anything, of incriminating potential left unsaid. The warnedphase of questioning proceeded after a pause of only 15 to 20
minutes, in the same place as the unwarned segment. Whenthe same officer who had conducted the first phase recited
the Miranda warnings, he said nothing to counter the proba-ble misimpression that the advice that anything Seibert said
could be used against her also applied to the details of theinculpatory statement previously elicited. In particular, the
police did not advise that her prior statement could not beused.

7 Nothing was said or done to dispel the oddity of

warning about legal rights to silence and counsel right afterthe police had led her through a systematic interrogation,

and any uncertainty on her part about a right to stop talkingabout matters previously discussed would only have been aggravated by the way Officer Hanrahan set the scene by say-ing "we've been talking for a little while about what happened on Wednesday the twelfth, haven't we?" App. 66.The impression that the further questioning was a mere continuation of the earlier questions and responses was fosteredby references back to the confession already given. It

6 Because the intent of the officer will rarely be as candidly admitted as
it was here (even as it is likely to determine the conduct of the interrogation), the focus is on facts apart from intent that show the question-first
tactic at work.

7 We do not hold that a formal addendum warning that a previous statement could not be used would be sufficient to change the character of the
question-first procedure to the point of rendering an ensuing statement
admissible, but its absence is clearly a factor that blunts the efficacy of the
warnings and points to a continuing, not a new, interrogation.

would have been reasonable to regard the two sessions asparts of a continuum, in which it would have been unnatural

to refuse to repeat at the second stage what had been saidbefore. These circumstances must be seen as challenging
the comprehensibility and efficacy of the Miranda warningsto the point that a reasonable person in the suspect's shoes
would not have understood them to convey a message thatshe retained a choice about continuing to talk.

VI
Strategists dedicated to draining the substance out of
Miranda cannot accomplish by training instructions whatDickerson held Congress could not do by statute. Because

the question-first tactic effectively threatens to thwart Mi-randa's purpose of reducing the risk that a coerced confession would be admitted, and because the facts here do notreasonably support a conclusion that the warnings given
could have served their purpose, Seibert's postwarningstatements are inadmissible. The judgment of the Supreme
Court of Missouri is affirmed. It is so ordered.

Justice Breyer, concurring.
In my view, the following simple rule should apply to thetwo-stage interrogation technique: Courts should exclude

the "fruits" of the initial unwarned questioning unless thefailure to warn was in good faith. Cf.

Oregon v. Elstad, 470U. S. 298, 309, 318, n. 5 (1985); United States v. Leon, 468

U. S. 897 (1984). I believe this is a sound and workable ap-proach to the problem this case presents. Prosecutors and
judges have long understood how to apply the "fruits" ap-proach, which they use in other areas of law. See Wong Sun
v. United States, 371 U. S. 471 (1963). And in the workaday

8 Because we find that the warnings were inadequate, there is no need
to assess the actual voluntariness of the statement.

world of criminal law enforcement the administrative sim-plicity of the familiar has significant advantages over a more

complex exclusionary rule. Cf. post, at 628-629 (O'Connor,J., dissenting).

I believe the plurality's approach in practice will function
as a "fruits" test. The truly "effective" Miranda warnings
on which the plurality insists, ante, at 615, will occur only
when certain circumstances--a lapse in time, a change in location or interrogating officer, or a shift in the focus of the
questioning--intervene between the unwarned questioning
and any postwarning statement. Cf. Taylor v. Alabama,
457 U. S. 687, 690 (1982) (evidence obtained subsequent to a
constitutional violation must be suppressed as "fruit of the
poisonous tree" unless "intervening events break the causal
connection").

I consequently join the plurality's opinion in full. I also
agree with Justice Kennedy's opinion insofar as it is consistent with this approach and makes clear that a good-faith
exception applies. See post, at 622 (opinion concurring in
judgment).

Justice Kennedy, concurring in the judgment.
The interrogation technique used in this case is designed
to circumvent Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). It
undermines the Miranda warning and obscures its meaning.
The plurality opinion is correct to conclude that statements
obtained through the use of this technique are inadmissible.
Although I agree with much in the careful and convincing
opinion for the plurality, my approach does differ in some
respects, requiring this separate statement.

The Miranda rule has become an important and accepted
element of the criminal justice system. See Dickerson v.
United States, 530 U. S. 428 (2000). At the same time, not
every violation of the rule requires suppression of the evidence obtained. Evidence is admissible when the central

542US2 Unit: $U76 [10-30-06 07:06:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

619Cite as: 542 U. S. 600 (2004)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
concerns of Miranda are not likely to be implicated and when
other objectives of the criminal justice system are best
served by its introduction. Thus, we have held that statements obtained in violation of the rule can be used for impeachment, so that the truth-finding function of the trial is
not distorted by the defense, see Harris v. New York, 401
U. S. 222 (1971); that there is an exception to protect countervailing concerns of public safety, see New York v. Quarles,
467 U. S. 649 (1984); and that physical evidence obtained in
reliance on statements taken in violation of the rule is admissible, see United States v. Patane, post, p. 630. These cases,
in my view, are correct. They recognize that admission of
evidence is proper when it would further important objectives without compromising Miranda's central concerns.
Under these precedents, the scope of the Miranda suppression remedy depends on a consideration of those legitimate
interests and on whether admission of the evidence under
the circumstances would frustrate Miranda's central concerns and objectives.

Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298 (1985), reflects this approach. In Elstad, a suspect made an initial incriminating
statement at his home. The suspect had not received a
Miranda warning before making the statement, apparently
because it was not clear whether the suspect was in custody
at the time. The suspect was taken to the station house,
where he received a proper warning, waived his Miranda
rights, and made a second statement. He later argued that
the postwarning statement should be suppressed because
it was related to the unwarned first statement, and likely
induced or caused by it. The Court held that, although a
Miranda violation made the first statement inadmissible, the
postwarning statements could be introduced against the accused because "neither the general goal of deterring improper police conduct nor the Fifth Amendment goal of
assuring trustworthy evidence would be served by suppres542US2 Unit: $U76 [10-30-06 07:06:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN
620 MISSOURI v. SEIBERT

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
sion" given the facts of that case. Elstad, supra, at 308 (citing Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U. S. 433, 445 (1974)).

In my view, Elstad was correct in its reasoning and its
result. Elstad reflects a balanced and pragmatic approach
to enforcement of the Miranda warning. An officer may not
realize that a suspect is in custody and warnings are required. The officer may not plan to question the suspect or
may be waiting for a more appropriate time. Skilled investigators often interview suspects multiple times, and good
police work may involve referring to prior statements to test
their veracity or to refresh recollection. In light of these
realities it would be extravagant to treat the presence of
one statement that cannot be admitted under Miranda as
sufficient reason to prohibit subsequent statements preceded
by a proper warning. See Elstad, 470 U. S., at 309 ("It is an
unwarranted extension of Miranda to hold that a simple failure to administer the warnings . . . so taints the investigatory
process that a subsequent voluntary and informed waiver is
ineffective for some indeterminate period"). That approach
would serve "neither the general goal of deterring improper
police conduct nor the Fifth Amendment goal of assuring
trustworthy evidence would be served by suppression of
the . . . testimony." Id., at 308.

This case presents different considerations. The police
used a two-step questioning technique based on a deliberate
violation of Miranda. The Miranda warning was withheld
to obscure both the practical and legal significance of the
admonition when finally given. As Justice Souter points
out, the two-step technique permits the accused to conclude
that the right not to respond did not exist when the earlier
incriminating statements were made. The strategy is based
on the assumption that Miranda warnings will tend to mean
less when recited midinterrogation, after inculpatory statements have already been obtained. This tactic relies on
an intentional misrepresentation of the protection that Mi542US2 Unit: $U76 [10-30-06 07:06:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

621Cite as: 542 U. S. 600 (2004)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
randa offers and does not serve any legitimate objectives
that might otherwise justify its use.

Further, the interrogating officer here relied on the defendant's prewarning statement to obtain the postwarning
statement used against her at trial. The postwarning interview resembled a cross-examination. The officer confronted
the defendant with her inadmissible prewarning statements
and pushed her to acknowledge them. See App. 70 (" 'Trice,
didn't you tell me that he was supposed to die in his sleep?").
This shows the temptations for abuse inherent in the twostep technique. Reference to the prewarning statement
was an implicit suggestion that the mere repetition of
the earlier statement was not independently incriminating.
The implicit suggestion was false.

The technique used in this case distorts the meaning of
Miranda and furthers no legitimate countervailing interest.
The Miranda rule would be frustrated were we to allow police to undermine its meaning and effect. The technique
simply creates too high a risk that postwarning statements
will be obtained when a suspect was deprived of "knowledge
essential to his ability to understand the nature of his rights
and the consequences of abandoning them." Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 423-424 (1986). When an interrogator
uses this deliberate, two-step strategy, predicated upon violating Miranda during an extended interview, postwarning
statements that are related to the substance of prewarning
statements must be excluded absent specific, curative steps.

The plurality concludes that whenever a two-stage interview occurs, admissibility of the postwarning statement
should depend on "whether [the] Miranda warnings delivered midstream could have been effective enough to accomplish their object" given the specific facts of the case. Ante,
at 615. This test envisions an objective inquiry from the
perspective of the suspect, and applies in the case of both
intentional and unintentional two-stage interrogations.

622 MISSOURI v. SEIBERT

O'Connor, J., dissenting
Ante, at 615-617. In my view, this test cuts too broadly.
Miranda's clarity is one of its strengths, and a multifactor
test that applies to every two-stage interrogation may serveto undermine that clarity. Cf.

Berkemer v. McCarty, 468
U. S. 420, 430 (1984). I would apply a narrower test applica-ble only in the infrequent case, such as we have here, in

which the two-step interrogation technique was used in a
calculated way to undermine the Miranda warning.The admissibility of postwarning statements should continue to be governed by the principles of Elstad unless thedeliberate two-step strategy was employed. If the deliberate two-step strategy has been used, postwarning state-ments that are related to the substance of prewarning statements must be excluded unless curative measures are taken
before the postwarning statement is made. Curative measures should be designed to ensure that a reasonable person
in the suspect's situation would understand the import and
effect of the Miranda warning and of the Miranda waiver.
For example, a substantial break in time and circumstances
between the prewarning statement and the Miranda warning may suffice in most circumstances, as it allows the
accused to distinguish the two contexts and appreciate that
the interrogation has taken a new turn. Cf. Westover v.
United States, decided with Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S.
436 (1966). Alternatively, an additional warning that explains the likely inadmissibility of the prewarning custodial
statement may be sufficient. No curative steps were taken
in this case, however, so the postwarning statements are inadmissible and the conviction cannot stand.

For these reasons, I concur in the judgment of the Court.

Justice O'Connor, with whom The Chief Justice,
Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

The plurality devours Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298

are bound by Elstad to reach a different result, and I wouldvacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri.

I
On two preliminary questions I am in full agreement withthe plurality. First, the plurality appropriately follows

Elstad in concluding that Seibert's statement cannot be held
inadmissible under a "fruit of the poisonous tree" theory.
Ante, at 612, n. 4 (internal quotation marks omitted). Second, the plurality correctly declines to focus its analysis on
the subjective intent of the interrogating officer.

A
This Court has made clear that there simply is no place
for a robust deterrence doctrine with regard to violations of
Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). See Dickerson
v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 441 (2000) ("Our decision in
[Elstad]--refusing to apply the traditional `fruits' doctrine
developed in Fourth Amendment cases--. . . simply recognizes the fact that unreasonable searches under the Fourth
Amendment are different from unwarned interrogation
under the Fifth Amendment"); Elstad, supra, at 306 (unlike
the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule, the "Miranda exclusionary rule . . . serves the Fifth Amendment and sweeps
more broadly than the Fifth Amendment itself "); see also
United States v. Patane, post, at 644-645 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (refusal to suppress evidence obtained
following an unwarned confession in Elstad, New York v.
Quarles, 467 U. S. 649 (1984), and Harris v. New York, 401
U. S. 222 (1971), was based on "our recognition that the concerns underlying the Miranda . . . rule must be accommodated to other objectives of the criminal justice system").
Consistent with that view, the Court today refuses to apply
the traditional "fruits" analysis to the physical fruit of a
claimed Miranda violation. Patane, post, p. 630. The plu542US2 Unit: $U76 [10-30-06 07:06:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN
624 MISSOURI v. SEIBERT

O'Connor, J., dissenting
rality correctly refuses to apply a similar analysis to testimo-nial fruits.

Although the analysis the plurality ultimately espouses ex-amines the same facts and circumstances that a "fruits" analysis would consider (such as the lapse of time between thetwo interrogations and change of questioner or location), it
does so for entirely different reasons. The fruits analysiswould examine those factors because they are relevant to
the balance of deterrence value versus the "drastic and so-cially costly course" of excluding reliable evidence.

Nix v.Williams, 467 U. S. 431, 442-443 (1984). The plurality, by

contrast, looks to those factors to inform the psychologicaljudgment regarding whether the suspect has been informed
effectively of her right to remain silent. The analytical un-derpinnings of the two approaches are thus entirely distinct,
and they should not be conflated just because they functionsimilarly in practice. Cf. ante, at 617-618 (

Breyer, J.,concurring).

B
The plurality's rejection of an intent-based test is also, inmy view, correct. Freedom from compulsion lies at the

heart of the Fifth Amendment, and requires us to assesswhether a suspect's decision to speak truly was voluntary.
Because voluntariness is a matter of the suspect's state ofmind, we focus our analysis on the way in which suspects
experience interrogation. See generally Miranda, 384U. S., at 455 (summarizing psychological tactics used by police that "undermin[e]" the suspect's "will to resist," and not-ing that "the very fact of custodial interrogation . . . trades
on the weakness of individuals"); id., at 467 ("[I]n-custodyinterrogation of persons suspected or accused of crime contains inherently compelling pressures which work to under-mine the individual's will to resist and to compel him to
speak where he would not otherwise do so freely").Thoughts kept inside a police officer's head cannot affect
that experience. See Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 422

542US2 Unit: $U76 [10-30-06 07:06:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

625Cite as: 542 U. S. 600 (2004)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
(1986) ("Events occurring outside of the presence of the sus-pect and entirely unknown to him surely can have no bearing

on the capacity to comprehend and knowingly relinquish aconstitutional right"). In

Moran, an attorney hired by the
suspect's sister had been trying to contact the suspect andwas told by the police, falsely, that they would not begin an

interrogation that night. Id., at 416-418. The suspect was
not aware that an attorney had been hired for him. Id., at417. We rejected an analysis under which a different result

would obtain for "the same defendant, armed with the sameinformation and confronted with precisely the same police
conduct" if something not known to the defendant--such as
the fact that an attorney was attempting to contact him--
had been different. Id., at 422. The same principle applies
here. A suspect who experienced exactly the same interrogation as Seibert, save for a difference in the undivulged,
subjective intent of the interrogating officer when he failed
to give Miranda warnings, would not experience the interrogation any differently. "[W]hether intentional or inadvertent, the state of mind of the police is irrelevant to the question of the intelligence and voluntariness of respondent's
election to abandon his rights. Although highly inappropriate, even deliberate deception of an attorney could not possibly affect a suspect's decision to waive his Miranda rights
unless he were at least aware of the incident." 475 U. S., at
423. Cf. Stansbury v. California, 511 U. S. 318, 324-325
(1994) (per curiam) (police officer's subjective intent is irrelevant to whether suspect is in custody for Miranda purposes; "one cannot expect the person under interrogation to
probe the officer's innermost thoughts").

Because the isolated fact of Officer Hanrahan's intent could
not have had any bearing on Seibert's "capacity to comprehend and knowingly relinquish" her right to remain silent,
Moran, supra, at 422, it could not by itself affect the voluntariness of her confession. Moreover, recognizing an exception to Elstad for intentional violations would require focus542US2 Unit: $U76 [10-30-06 07:06:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN
626 MISSOURI v. SEIBERT

O'Connor, J., dissenting
ing constitutional analysis on a police officer's subjectiveintent, an unattractive proposition that we all but uniformly

avoid. In general, "we believe that `sending state and fed-eral courts on an expedition into the minds of police officers
would produce a grave and fruitless misallocation of judicialresources.' "

United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 922, n. 23
(1984) (quoting Massachusetts v. Painten, 389 U. S. 560, 565
(1968) (White, J., dissenting)). This case presents the un-commonly straightforward circumstance of an officer openly

admitting that the violation was intentional. But the in-quiry will be complicated in other situations probably more
likely to occur. For example, different officers involved in
an interrogation might claim different states of mind regarding the failure to give Miranda warnings. Even in the simple case of a single officer who claims that a failure to give
Miranda warnings was inadvertent, the likelihood of error
will be high. See W. LaFave, Search and Seizure $ 1.4(e),
p. 124 (3d ed. 1996) ("[T]here is no reason to believe that
courts can with any degree of success determine in which
instances the police had an ulterior motive").

These evidentiary difficulties have led us to reject an
intent-based test in several criminal procedure contexts.
For example, in New York v. Quarles, one of the factors that
led us to reject an inquiry into the subjective intent of the
police officer in crafting a test for the "public safety" exception to Miranda was that officers' motives will be "largely
unverifiable." 467 U. S., at 656. Similarly, our opinion in
Whren v. United States, 517 U. S. 806, 813-814 (1996), made
clear that "the evidentiary difficulty of establishing subjective intent" was one of the reasons (albeit not the principal
one) for refusing to consider intent in Fourth Amendment
challenges generally.

For these reasons, I believe that the approach espoused by
Justice Kennedy is ill advised. Justice Kennedy would
extend Miranda's exclusionary rule to any case in which the
use of the "two-step interrogation technique" was "deliber542US2 Unit: $U76 [10-30-06 07:06:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ate" or "calculated." Ante, at 622 (opinion concurring injudgment). This approach untethers the analysis from facts

knowable to, and therefore having any potential directly toaffect, the suspect. Far from promoting "clarity," ibid., the
approach will add a third step to the suppression inquiry.In virtually every two-stage interrogation case, in addition
to addressing the standard Miranda and voluntariness ques-tions, courts will be forced to conduct the kind of difficult,
state-of-mind inquiry that we normally take pains to avoid.

II
The plurality's adherence to Elstad, and mine to the plu-rality, end there. Our decision in Elstad rejected two lines

of argument advanced in favor of suppression. The first wasbased on the "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine, discussed
above. The second was the argument that the "lingeringcompulsion" inherent in a defendant's having let the "cat out
of the bag " required suppression. 470 U. S., at 311. TheCourt of Appeals of Oregon, in accepting the latter argument, had endorsed a theory indistinguishable from the onetoday's plurality adopts: "[T]he coercive impact of the unconstitutionally obtained statement remains, because in a de-fendant's mind it has sealed his fate. It is this impact that
must be dissipated in order to make a subsequent confessionadmissible."

State v. Elstad, 61 Ore. App. 673, 677, 658 P. 2d552, 554 (1983).

We rejected this theory outright. We did so not becausewe refused to recognize the "psychological impact of the suspect's conviction that he has let the cat out of the bag," butbecause we refused to "endo[w]" those "psychological effects" with "constitutional implications." 470 U. S., at 311.To do so, we said, would "effectively immuniz[e] a suspect
who responds to pre-Miranda warning questions from theconsequences of his subsequent informed waiver," an immunity that "comes at a high cost to legitimate law enforcementactivity, while adding little desirable protection to the indi542US2 Unit: $U76 [10-30-06 07:06:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

vidual's interest in not being compelled to testify againsthimself."

Id., at 312. The plurality might very well think
that we struck the balance between Fifth Amendment rightsand law enforcement interests incorrectly in

Elstad; but that
is not normally a sufficient reason for ignoring the dictatesof

stare decisis.
I would analyze the two-step interrogation procedure
under the voluntariness standards central to the FifthAmendment and reiterated in

Elstad. Elstad commands
that if Seibert's first statement is shown to have been invol-untary, the court must examine whether the taint dissipated

through the passing of time or a change in circumstances:
"When a prior statement is actually coerced, the time that
passes between confessions, the change in place of interrogations, and the change in identity of the interrogators all bear
on whether that coercion has carried over into the second
confession." Id., at 310 (citing Westover v. United States,
decided with Miranda, 384 U. S., at 494). In addition, Seibert's second statement should be suppressed if she showed
that it was involuntary despite the Miranda warnings. Elstad, supra, at 318 ("The relevant inquiry is whether, in fact,
the second statement was also voluntarily made. As in any
such inquiry, the finder of fact must examine the surrounding
circumstances and the entire course of police conduct with
respect to the suspect in evaluating the voluntariness of his
statements"). Although I would leave this analysis for the
Missouri courts to conduct on remand, I note that, unlike
the officers in Elstad, Officer Hanrahan referred to Seibert's
unwarned statement during the second part of the interrogation when she made a statement at odds with her unwarned
confession. App. 70 (" 'Trice, didn't you tell me that he was
supposed to die in his sleep?"); cf. Elstad, supra, at 316 (officers did not "exploit the unwarned admission to pressure
respondent into waiving his right to remain silent"). Such
a tactic may bear on the voluntariness inquiry. Cf. Frazier

UNITED STATES v. PATANE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 02-1183. Argued December 9, 2003--Decided June 28, 2004
After Officer Fox began to investigate respondent's apparent violation of

a temporary restraining order, a federal agent told Fox's colleague, Detective Benner, that respondent, a convicted felon, illegally possessed a
pistol. Officer Fox and Detective Benner proceeded to respondent's
home, where Fox arrested him for violating the restraining order. Benner attempted to advise respondent of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, but respondent interrupted, asserting that he knew
his rights. Benner then asked about the pistol and retrieved and seized
it. Respondent was indicted for possession of a firearm by a convicted
felon, 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g)(1). The District Court granted his motion to
suppress the pistol, reasoning that the officers lacked probable cause to
arrest him, and declining to rule on his alternative argument that the
gun should be suppressed as the fruit of an unwarned statement. The
Tenth Circuit reversed the probable-cause ruling, but affirmed the suppression order on respondent's alternative theory. Rejecting the Government's argument that Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298, and Michigan
v. Tucker, 417 U. S. 433, foreclosed application of the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine of Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U. S. 471, 488, to
the present context, the appeals court reasoned that Elstad and Tucker,
which were based on the view that Miranda announced a prophylactic
rule, were incompatible with Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428,
444, in which this Court held that Miranda announced a constitutional
rule. The appeals court thus equated Dickerson's ruling with the proposition that a failure to warn pursuant to Miranda is itself a violation
of the suspect's Fifth Amendment rights.

Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
304 F. 3d 1013, reversed and remanded.

Justice Thomas, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia,
concluded that a failure to give a suspect Miranda warnings does not
require suppression of the physical fruits of the suspect's unwarned but
voluntary statements. Pp. 637-644.

(a) The Miranda rule is a prophylactic employed to protect against
violations of the Self-Incrimination Clause, U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. That
Clause's core protection is a prohibition on compelling a criminal defendant to testify against himself at trial. See, e. g., Chavez v. Martinez,

542US2 Unit: $U77 [10-26-06 13:21:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
538 U. S. 760, 764-768. It cannot be violated by the introduction of
nontestimonial evidence obtained as a result of voluntary statements.
See, e. g., United States v. Hubbell, 530 U. S. 27, 34. The Court has
recognized and applied several prophylactic rules designed to protect
the core privilege against self-incrimination. For example, the Miranda rule creates a presumption of coercion in custodial interrogations,
in the absence of specific warnings, that is generally irrebuttable for
purposes of the prosecution's case in chief. E. g., 384 U. S., at 467. But
because such prophylactic rules necessarily sweep beyond the SelfIncrimination Clause's actual protections, see, e. g., Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S. 680, 690-691, any further extension of one of them must
be justified by its necessity for the protection of the actual right against
compelled self-incrimination, e. g., Chavez, supra, at 778. Thus, uncompelled statements taken without Miranda warnings can be used to impeach a defendant's testimony at trial, see Elstad, supra, at 307-308,
though the fruits of actually compelled testimony cannot, see New Jersey v. Portash, 440 U. S. 450, 458-459. A blanket rule requiring suppression of statements noncompliant with the Miranda rule could not
be justified by reference to the "Fifth Amendment goal of assuring
trustworthy evidence" or by any deterrence rationale, e. g., Elstad, 470
U. S., at 308, and would therefore fail the Court's requirement that the
closest possible fit be maintained between the Self-Incrimination Clause
and any rule designed to protect it. Furthermore, the Clause contains
its own exclusionary rule that automatically protects those subjected to
coercive police interrogations from the use of their involuntary statements (or evidence derived from their statements) in any subsequent
criminal trial. E. g., id., at 307-308. This explicit textual protection
supports a strong presumption against expanding the Miranda rule any
further. Cf. Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386. Finally, nothing in
Dickerson calls into question the Court's continued insistence on its
close-fit requirement. Pp. 637-641.

(b) That a mere failure to give Miranda warnings does not, by itself,
violate a suspect's constitutional rights or even the Miranda rule was
evident in many of the Court's pre-Dickerson cases, see, e. g., Elstad,
supra, at 308, and the Court has adhered to that view since Dickerson,
see Chavez, supra, at 772-773. This follows from the nature of the
"fundamental trial right" protected by the Self-Incrimination Clause,
e. g., Withrow, supra, at 691, which the Miranda rule, in turn, protects.
Thus, the police do not violate a suspect's constitutional rights (or the
Miranda rule) by negligent or even deliberate failures to provide full
Miranda warnings. Potential violations occur, if at all, only upon the
admission of unwarned statements into evidence. And, at that point,
the exclusion of such statements is a complete and sufficient remedy for
any perceived Miranda violation. Chavez, supra, at 790. Unlike ac542US2 Unit: $U77 [10-26-06 13:21:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN
632 UNITED STATES v. PATANE

Syllabus
tual violations of the Self-Incrimination Clause, there is, with respect to
mere failures to warn, nothing to deter and therefore no reason to apply
Wong Sun's "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine. It is not for this
Court to impose its preferred police practices on either federal or state
officials. Pp. 641-642.

(c) The Tenth Circuit erred in ruling that the taking of unwarned
statements violates a suspect's constitutional rights. Dickerson's characterization of Miranda as a constitutional rule does not lessen the need
to maintain the close-fit requirement. There is no such fit here. Introduction of the nontestimonial fruit of a voluntary statement, such as
respondent's pistol, does not implicate the Clause. It presents no risk
that a defendant's coerced statements (however defined) will be used
against him at a criminal trial. In any case, the exclusion of unwarned
statements is a complete and sufficient remedy for any perceived
Miranda violation. E. g., Chavez, supra, at 790. Similarly, because police cannot violate the Clause by taking unwarned though voluntary
statements, an exclusionary rule cannot be justified by reference to a
deterrence effect on law enforcement, as the court below believed. The
word "witness" in the constitutional text limits the Self-Incrimination
Clause's scope to testimonial evidence. Hubbell, supra, at 34-35. And
although the Court requires the exclusion of the physical fruit of actually coerced statements, statements taken without sufficient Miranda
warnings are presumed to have been coerced only for certain purposes
and then only when necessary to protect the privilege against selfincrimination. This Court declines to extend that presumption further. Pp. 642-644.

Justice Kennedy, joined by Justice O'Connor, concluded that it is
unnecessary to decide whether the detective's failure to give Patane full
Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, warnings should be characterized as
a violation of the Miranda rule itself, or whether there is anything to
deter so long as the unwarned statements are not later introduced at
trial. In Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298, New York v. Quarles, 467 U. S.
649, and Harris v. New York, 401 U. S. 222, evidence obtained following
unwarned interrogations was held admissible based in large part on the
Court's recognition that the concerns underlying the Miranda rule must
be accommodated to other objectives of the criminal justice system.
Here, it is sufficient to note that the Government presents an even
stronger case for admitting the evidence obtained as the result of
Patane's unwarned statement than was presented in Elstad and Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U. S. 433. Admission of nontestimonial physical
fruits (the pistol here) does not run the risk of admitting into trial an
accused's coerced incriminating statements against himself. In light of
reliable physical evidence's important probative value, it is doubtful that
exclusion can be justified by a deterrence rationale sensitive to both

634 UNITED STATES v. PATANE

Opinion of Thomas, J.
384 U. S. 436 (1966), requires suppression of the physicalfruits of the suspect's unwarned but voluntary statements.

The Court has previously addressed this question but hasnot reached a definitive conclusion. See Massachusetts v.
White, 439 U. S. 280 (1978) (per curiam) (dividing evenly onthe question); see also Patterson v. United States, 485 U. S.
922 (1988) (White, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).Although we believe that the Court's decisions in

Oregon v.Elstad, 470 U. S. 298 (1985), and Michigan v. Tucker, 417

U. S. 433 (1974), are instructive, the Courts of Appeals havesplit on the question after our decision in Dickerson v.
United States, 530 U. S. 428 (2000). See, e. g., United Statesv. Villalba-Alvarado, 345 F. 3d 1007 (CA8 2003) (holding admissible the physical fruits of a Miranda violation); UnitedStates v. Sterling, 283 F. 3d 216 (CA4 2002) (same); United
States v. DeSumma, 272 F. 3d 176 (CA3 2001) (same); UnitedStates v. Faulkingham, 295 F. 3d 85 (CA1 2002) (holding admissible the physical fruits of a negligent Miranda violation).Because the

Miranda rule protects against violations of theSelf-Incrimination Clause, which, in turn, is not implicated

by the introduction at trial of physical evidence resultingfrom voluntary statements, we answer the question presented in the negative. I

In June 2001, respondent, Samuel Francis Patane, was ar-rested for harassing his ex-girlfriend, Linda O'Donnell. He
was released on bond, subject to a temporary restrainingorder that prohibited him from contacting O'Donnell. Respondent apparently violated the restraining order by at-tempting to telephone O'Donnell. On June 6, 2001, Officer
Tracy Fox of the Colorado Springs Police Department beganto investigate the matter. On the same day, a county probation officer informed an agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, To-bacco and Firearms (ATF), that respondent, a convicted
felon, illegally possessed a .40 Glock pistol. The ATF re-layed this information to Detective Josh Benner, who worked

closely with the ATF. Together, Detective Benner and Of-ficer Fox proceeded to respondent's residence.

After reaching the residence and inquiring into respond-ent's attempts to contact O'Donnell, Officer Fox arrested
respondent for violating the restraining order. DetectiveBenner attempted to advise respondent of his Miranda
rights but got no further than the right to remain silent. Atthat point, respondent interrupted, asserting that he knew
his rights, and neither officer attempted to complete thewarning.

1 App. 40.

Detective Benner then asked respondent about the Glock.Respondent was initially reluctant to discuss the matter,

stating: "I am not sure I should tell you anything about theGlock because I don't want you to take it away from me."
Id., at 41. Detective Benner persisted, and respondent toldhim that the pistol was in his bedroom. Respondent then
gave Detective Benner permission to retrieve the pistol.Detective Benner found the pistol and seized it.

A grand jury indicted respondent for possession of a fire-arm by a convicted felon, in vi olation of 18 U. S. C.

$ 922(g)(1). The District Court granted respondent's motionto suppress the firearm, reasoning that the officers lacked
probable cause to arrest respondent for violating the re-straining order. It therefore declined to rule on respondent's alternative argument that the gun should be sup-pressed as the fruit of an unwarned statement.

The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's rulingwith respect to probable cause but affirmed the suppression
order on respondent's alternative theory. The court re-jected the Government's argument that this Court's decisions in Elstad, supra, and Tucker, supra, foreclosed applica-tion of the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine of

Wong Sun

1 The Government concedes that respondent's answers to subsequent
on-the-scene questioning are inadmissible at trial under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), despite the partial warning and respondent's
assertions that he knew his rights.

636 UNITED STATES v. PATANE

Opinion of Thomas, J.
v. United States, 371 U. S. 471 (1963), to the present context.304 F. 3d 1013, 1019 (CA10 2002). These holdings were, the

Court of Appeals reasoned, based on the view that Mirandaannounced a prophylactic rule, a position that it found to be
incompatible with this Court's decision in Dickerson, supra,at 444 ("Miranda announced a constitutional rule that Congress may not supersede legislatively").2 The Court of Ap-peals thus equated

Dickerson's announcement that Mirandais a constitutional rule with the proposition that a failure to

warn pursuant to Miranda is itself a violation of the Consti-tution (and, more particularly, of the suspect's Fifth Amendment rights). Based on its understanding of Dickerson, theCourt of Appeals rejected the post-Dickerson views of the
Third and Fourth Circuits that the fruits doctrine does notapply to Miranda violations. 304 F. 3d, at 1023-1027 (discussing United States v. Sterling, 283 F. 3d 216 (CA4 2002),and United States v. DeSumma, 272 F. 3d 176 (CA3 2001)).
It also disagreed with the First Circuit's conclusion that sup-pression is not generally required in the case of negligent
failures to warn, 304 F. 3d, at 1027-1029 (discussing United
States v. Faulkingham, 295 F. 3d 85 (CA1 2002)), explainingthat "[d]eterrence is necessary not merely to deter intentional wrongdoing, but also to ensure that officers diligently(non-negligently) protect--and properly are trained to
protect--the constitutional rights of citizens," 304 F. 3d,at 1028-1029. We granted certiorari. 538 U. S. 976 (2003).

As we explain below, the Miranda rule is a prophylac-tic employed to protect against violations of the SelfIncrimination Clause. The Self-Incrimination Clause, how-ever, is not implicated by the admission into evidence of the
physical fruit of a voluntary statement. Accordingly, thereis no justification for extending the

Miranda rule to this con2 The Court of Appeals also distinguished Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S.
298 (1985), on the ground that the second (and warned) confession at issue
there was the product of the defendant's volition. 304 F. 3d, at 1019, 1021.
For the reasons discussed below, we do not find this distinction relevant.

Opinion of Thomas, J.
text. And just as the Self-Incrimination Clause primarilyfocuses on the criminal trial, so too does the Miranda rule.

The Miranda rule is not a code of police conduct, and policedo not violate the Constitution (or even the Miranda rule,
for that matter) by mere failures to warn. For this reason,the exclusionary rule articulated in cases such as Wong Sun
does not apply. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment ofthe Court of Appeals and remand the case for further
proceedings. II

The Self-Incrimination Clause provides: "No person . . .shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness
against himself." U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. We need not de-cide here the precise boundaries of the Clause's protection.
For present purposes, it suffices to note that the core protec-tion afforded by the Self-Incrimination Clause is a prohibition on compelling a criminal defendant to testify againsthimself at trial. See,

e. g., Chavez v. Martinez, 538 U. S. 760,764-768 (2003) (plurality opinion); id., at 777-779 (

Souter,J., concurring in judgment); 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence $ 2263,

p. 378 (J. McNaughton rev. ed. 1961) (explaining that theClause "was directed at the employment of legal process to
extract from the person's own lips an admission of guilt,which would thus take the place of other evidence"); see also
United States v. Hubbell, 530 U. S. 27, 49-56 (2000) (Thomas,J., concurring) (explaining that the privilege might extend to
bar the compelled production of any incriminating evidence,testimonial or otherwise). The Clause cannot be violated
by the introduction of nontestimonial evidence obtained as aresult of voluntary statements. See, e. g., id., at 34 (noting
that the word " `witness' " in the Self-Incrimination Clause"limits the relevant category of compelled incriminating
communications to those that are `testimonial' in character");id., at 35 (discussing why compelled blood samples do not
violate the Clause; cataloging other examples and citingcases);

Elstad, 470 U. S., at 304 ("The Fifth Amendment, of

course, is not concerned with nontestimonial evidence"); id.,
at 306-307 ("The Fifth Amendment prohibits use by the
prosecution in its case in chief only of compelled testimony");
Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S. 680, 705 (1993) (O'Connor,
J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (describing
"true Fifth Amendment claims [as] the extraction and use of
compelled testimony"); New York v. Quarles, 467 U. S. 649,
665-672, and n. 4 (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (explaining that the
physical fruit of a Miranda violation need not be suppressed
for these reasons).

To be sure, the Court has recognized and applied several
prophylactic rules designed to protect the core privilege
against self-incrimination. See, e. g., Chavez, supra, at 770-
772 (plurality opinion). For example, although the text of
the Self-Incrimination Clause at least suggests that "its coverage [is limited to] compelled testimony that is used against
the defendant in the trial itself," Hubbell, supra, at 37, potential suspects may, at times, assert the privilege in proceedings in which answers might be used to incriminate
them in a subsequent criminal case. See, e. g., United States
v. Balsys, 524 U. S. 666, 671-672 (1998); Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U. S. 420, 426 (1984); cf. Kastigar v. United States,
406 U. S. 441 (1972) (holding that the Government may compel grand jury testimony from witnesses over Fifth Amendment objections if the witnesses receive "use and derivative
use immunity"); Uniformed Sanitation Men Assn., Inc. v.
Commissioner of Sanitation of City of New York, 392 U. S.
280, 284 (1968) (allowing the Government to use economic
compulsion to secure statements but only if the Government
grants appropriate immunity). We have explained that
"[t]he natural concern which underlies [these] decisions is
that an inability to protect the right at one stage of a proceeding may make its invocation useless at a later stage."
Tucker, 417 U. S., at 440-441.

Opinion of Thomas, J.
Similarly, in Miranda, the Court concluded that the possibility of coercion inherent in custodial interrogations unacceptably raises the risk that a suspect's privilege against
self-incrimination might be violated. See Dickerson, 530
U. S., at 434-435; Miranda, 384 U. S., at 467. To protect
against this danger, the Miranda rule creates a presumption
of coercion, in the absence of specific warnings, that is generally irrebuttable for purposes of the prosecution's case in
chief.

But because these prophylactic rules (including the Miranda rule) necessarily sweep beyond the actual protections
of the Self-Incrimination Clause, see, e. g., Withrow, supra,
at 690-691; Elstad, supra, at 306, any further extension of
these rules must be justified by its necessity for the protection of the actual right against compelled self-incrimination,
Chavez, supra, at 778 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment)
(requiring a " `powerful showing' " before "expand[ing] . . .
the privilege against compelled self-incrimination"). Indeed, at times the Court has declined to extend Miranda
even where it has perceived a need to protect the privilege
against self-incrimination. See, e. g., Quarles, supra, at 657
(concluding "that the need for answers to questions in a situation posing a threat to the public safety outweighs the need
for the prophylactic rule protecting the Fifth Amendment's
privilege against self-incrimination").

It is for these reasons that statements taken without Miranda warnings (though not actually compelled) can be used
to impeach a defendant's testimony at trial, see Elstad,
supra, at 307-308; Harris v. New York, 401 U. S. 222 (1971),
though the fruits of actually compelled testimony cannot, see
New Jersey v. Portash, 440 U. S. 450, 458-459 (1979). More
generally, the Miranda rule "does not require that the
statements [taken without complying with the rule] and their
fruits be discarded as inherently tainted," Elstad, 470 U. S.,
at 307. Such a blanket suppression rule could not be justi542US2 Unit: $U77 [10-26-06 13:21:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

fied by reference to the "Fifth Amendment goal of assuring
trustworthy evidence" or by any deterrence rationale, id.,
at 308; see Tucker, supra, at 446-449; Harris, supra, at
225-226, and n. 2, and would therefore fail our close-fit
requirement.

Furthermore, the Self-Incrimination Clause contains its
own exclusionary rule. It provides that "[n]o person . . .
shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness
against himself." Amdt. 5. Unlike the Fourth Amendment's bar on unreasonable searches, the Self-Incrimination
Clause is self-executing. We have repeatedly explained
"that those subjected to coercive police interrogations have
an automatic protection from the use of their involuntary
statements (or evidence derived from their statements) in
any subsequent criminal trial." Chavez, 538 U. S., at 769
(plurality opinion) (citing, for example, Elstad, supra, at 307-
308). This explicit textual protection supports a strong presumption against expanding the Miranda rule any further.
Cf. Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386 (1989).

Finally, nothing in Dickerson, including its characterization of Miranda as announcing a constitutional rule, 530
U. S., at 444, changes any of these observations. Indeed, in
Dickerson, the Court specifically noted that the Court's
"subsequent cases have reduced the impact of the Miranda
rule on legitimate law enforcement while reaffirming [Miranda]'s core ruling that unwarned statements may not be
used as evidence in the prosecution's case in chief." Id., at
443-444. This description of Miranda, especially the emphasis on the use of "unwarned statements . . . in the prosecution's case in chief," makes clear our continued focus on the
protections of the Self-Incrimination Clause. The Court's
reliance on our Miranda precedents, including both Tucker
and Elstad, see, e. g., Dickerson, supra, at 438, 441, further
demonstrates the continuing validity of those decisions. In
short, nothing in Dickerson calls into question our continued

Opinion of Thomas, J.
insistence that the closest possible fit be maintained between
the Self-Incrimination Clause and any rule designed to protect it.

III

Our cases also make clear the related point that a mere
failure to give Miranda warnings does not, by itself, violate
a suspect's constitutional rights or even the Miranda rule.
So much was evident in many of our pre-Dickerson cases,
and we have adhered to this view since Dickerson. See
Chavez, 538 U. S., at 772-773 (plurality opinion) (holding that
a failure to read Miranda warnings did not violate the respondent's constitutional rights); 538 U. S., at 789 (Kennedy,
J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (agreeing "that
failure to give a Miranda warning does not, without more,
establish a completed violation when the unwarned interrogation ensues"); Elstad, supra, at 308; Quarles, 467 U. S., at
654; cf. Chavez, supra, at 777-779 (Souter, J., concurring in
judgment). This, of course, follows from the nature of the
right protected by the Self-Incrimination Clause, which the
Miranda rule, in turn, protects. It is " `a fundamental trial
right.' " Withrow, 507 U. S., at 691 (quoting United States
v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U. S. 259, 264 (1990)). See also
Chavez, 538 U. S., at 766-768 (plurality opinion); id., at 790
(Kennedy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)
("The identification of a Miranda violation and its consequences, then, ought to be determined at trial").

It follows that police do not violate a suspect's constitutional rights (or the Miranda rule) by negligent or even deliberate failures to provide the suspect with the full panoply
of warnings prescribed by Miranda. Potential violations
occur, if at all, only upon the admission of unwarned statements into evidence at trial. And, at that point, "[t]he exclusion of unwarned statements . . . is a complete and sufficient

remedy" for any perceived Miranda violation. Chavez,supra, at 790.

Thus, unlike unreasonable searches under the FourthAmendment or actual violations of the Due Process Clause

or the Self-Incrimination Clause, there is, with respect tomere failures to warn, nothing to deter. There is therefore
no reason to apply the "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrineof

Wong Sun, 371 U. S., at 488.4 See also Nix v. Williams,467 U. S. 431, 441 (1984) (discussing the exclusionary rule in

the Sixth Amendment context and noting that it applies to"illegally obtained evidence [and] other incriminating evidence derived from [it]" (emphasis added)). It is not for thisCourt to impose its preferred police practices on either federal law enforcement officials or their state counterparts.

IV
In the present case, the Court of Appeals, relying on Dick-erson, wholly adopted the position that the taking of unwarned statements violates a suspect's constitutional rights.304 F. 3d, at 1028-1029.

5 And, of course, if this were so, a

3 We acknowledge that there is language in some of the Court's postMiranda decisions that might suggest that the Miranda rule operates as
a direct constraint on police. See, e. g., Stansbury v. California, 511 U. S.
318, 322 (1994) (per curiam); Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 420 (1986)
(stating that "Miranda imposed on the police an obligation to follow certain procedures"); cf. Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, 485 (1981). But
Miranda itself made clear that its focus was the admissibility of statements, see, e. g., 384 U. S., at 439, 467, a view the Court reaffirmed in
Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 443-444 (2000) (equating the
Miranda rule with the proposition that "unwarned statements may not be
used as evidence in the prosecution's case in chief" (emphasis added)).

4 We reject respondent's invitation to apply the balancing test of Nardone v. United States, 308 U. S. 338 (1939). Brief for Respondent 15-33.
At issue in Nardone was the violation of a federal wiretap statute, and
the Court employed an exclusionary rule to deter those violations. But,
once again, there are no violations (statutory or constitutional) to deter
here.

5 It is worth mentioning that the Court of Appeals did not have the

benefit of our decision in Chavez v. Martinez, 538 U. S. 760 (2003).

Opinion of Thomas, J.
strong deterrence-based argument could be made for sup-pression of the fruits. See,

e. g., Nix, supra, at 441-444;
Wong Sun, supra, at 484-486; cf. Nardone v. United States,308 U. S. 338, 341 (1939).

But Dickerson's characterization of Miranda as a constitu-tional rule does not lessen the need to maintain the closest
possible fit between the Self-Incrimination Clause and any
judge-made rule designed to protect it. And there is nosuch fit here. Introduction of the nontestimonial fruit of a

voluntary statement, such as respondent's Glock, does notimplicate the Self-Incrimination Clause. The admission of
such fruit presents no risk that a defendant's coerced statements (however defined) will be used against him at a criminal trial. In any case, "[t]he exclusion of unwarned statements . . . is a complete and sufficient remedy" for any
perceived Miranda violation. Chavez, supra, at 790 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). See
also H. Friendly, Benchmarks 280-281 (1967). There is simply no need to extend (and therefore no justification for extending) the prophylactic rule of Miranda to this context.

Similarly, because police cannot vi olate the SelfIncrimination Clause by taking unwarned though voluntary
statements, an exclusionary rule cannot be justified by reference to a deterrence effect on law enforcement, as the Court
of Appeals believed, 304 F. 3d, at 1028-1029. Our decision
not to apply Wong Sun to mere failures to give Miranda
warnings was sound at the time Tucker and Elstad were
decided, and we decline to apply Wong Sun to such failures now.

The Court of Appeals ascribed significance to the fact that,
in this case, there might be "little [practical] difference between [respondent's] confessional statement" and the actual
physical evidence. 304 F. 3d, at 1027. The distinction, the
court said, "appears to make little sense as a matter of policy." Ibid. But, putting policy aside, we have held that
"[t]he word `witness' in the constitutional text limits the"

scope of the Self-Incrimination Clause to testimonial evi-dence. Hubbell, 530 U. S., at 34-35. The Constitution itself

makes the distinction.6 And although it is true that theCourt requires the exclusion of the physical fruit of actually
coerced statements, it must be remembered that statementstaken without sufficient Miranda warnings are presumed
to have been coerced only for certain purposes and thenonly when necessary to protect the privilege against
self-incrimination. See Part II, supra. For the reasonsdiscussed above, we decline to extend that presumption
further.7Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings.

It is so ordered.
Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice O'Connor joins,concurring in the judgment.

In Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298 (1985), New York v.Quarles, 467 U. S. 649 (1984), and Harris v. New York, 401
U. S. 222 (1971), evidence obtained following an unwarnedinterrogation was held admissible. This result was based in
large part on our recognition that the concerns underlyingthe Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), rule must be
accommodated to other objectives of the criminal justice sys6 While Fourth Amendment protections extend to "persons, houses, papers, and effects," the Self-Incrimination Clause prohibits only compelling
a defendant to be "a witness against himself," Amdt. 5.

7 It is not clear whether the Government could have used legal processes

actually to compel respondent to produce the Glock, though there is a
reasonable argument that it could have. See, e. g., United States v. Hubbell, 530 U. S. 27, 42-45 (2000); Baltimore City Dept. of Social Servs. v.
Bouknight, 493 U. S. 549, 554-556 (1990); Fisher v. United States, 425 U. S.
391 (1976); Warden, Md. Penitentiary v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294, 302-303
(1967); Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, 761 (1966). But see Commonwealth v. Hughes, 380 Mass. 583, 404 N. E. 2d 1239 (1980); Goldsmith
v. Superior Court, 152 Cal. App. 3d 76, 199 Cal. Rptr. 366 (1984). In light
of this, it would be especially odd to exclude the Glock here.

tem. I agree with the plurality that Dickerson v. United
States, 530 U. S. 428 (2000), did not undermine these precedents and, in fact, cited them in support. Here, it is sufficient to note that the Government presents an even stronger
case for admitting the evidence obtained as the result of Patane's unwarned statement. Admission of nontestimonial
physical fruits (the Glock in this case), even more so than the
postwarning statements to the police in Elstad and Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U. S. 433 (1974), does not run the risk of
admitting into trial an accused's coerced incriminating statements against himself. In light of the important probative
value of reliable physical evidence, it is doubtful that exclusion can be justified by a deterrence rationale sensitive to
both law enforcement interests and a suspect's rights during
an in-custody interrogation. Unlike the plurality, however,
I find it unnecessary to decide whether the detective's failure
to give Patane the full Miranda warnings should be characterized as a violation of the Miranda rule itself, or whether
there is "[any]thing to deter" so long as the unwarned statements are not later introduced at trial. Ante, at 641-642.

With these observations, I concur in the judgment of the
Court.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

The plurality repeatedly says that the Fifth Amendment
does not address the admissibility of nontestimonial evidence, an overstatement that is beside the point. The issue
actually presented today is whether courts should apply the
fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine lest we create an incentive for the police to omit Miranda warnings, see Miranda v.
Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), before custodial interrogation.1

1 In so saying, we are taking the legal issue as it comes to us, even
though the facts give off the scent of a made-up case. If there was a
Miranda failure, the most immediate reason was that Patane told the po542US2 Unit: $U77 [10-26-06 13:21:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN
646 UNITED STATES v. PATANE

Souter, J., dissenting
In closing their eyes to the consequences of giving an eviden-tiary advantage to those who ignore Miranda, the plurality

adds an important inducement for interrogators to ignorethe rule in that case.

Miranda rested on insight into the inherently coercivecharacter of custodial interrogation and the inherently difficult exercise of assessing the voluntariness of any confessionresulting from it. Unless the police give the prescribed
warnings meant to counter the coercive atmosphere, a custo-dial confession is inadmissible, there being no need for the
previous time-consuming and difficult enquiry into volun-tariness. That inducement to forestall involuntary statements and troublesome issues of fact can only atrophy if weturn around and recognize an evidentiary benefit when an
unwarned statement leads investigators to tangible evi-dence. There is, of course, a price for excluding evidence,
but the Fifth Amendment is worth a price, and in the ab-sence of a very good reason, the logic of

Miranda should befollowed: a
Miranda violation raises a presumption of coer-cion, Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298, 306-307, and n. 1 (1985),

and the Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination extends to the exclusion of derivative evidence, see United States v. Hubbell, 530 U. S. 27, 37-38 (2000)(recognizing "the Fifth Amendment's protection against the
prosecutor's use of incriminating information derived di-rectly or indirectly from . . . [actually] compelled testimony");
Kastigar v. United States, 406 U. S. 441, 453 (1972). Thatshould be the end of this case.

The fact that the books contain some exceptions to theMiranda exclusionary rule carries no weight here. In Harris v. New York, 401 U. S. 222 (1971), it was respect for theintegrity of the judicial process that justified the admission

lice to stop giving the warnings because he already knew his rights.
There could easily be an analogy in this case to the bumbling mistake the
police committed in Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298 (1985). See Missouri
v. Seibert, ante, at 614-615 (plurality opinion).

of unwarned statements as impeachment evidence. But Pa-tane's suppression motion can hardly be described as seeking

to "perver[t]" Miranda "into a license to use perjury" or oth-erwise handicap the "traditional truth-testing devices of the
adversary process." 401 U. S., at 225-226. Nor is thereany suggestion that the officers' failure to warn Patane was
justified or mitigated by a public emergency or other exigentcircumstance, as in

New York v. Quarles, 467 U. S. 649 (1984).And of course the premise of Oregon v. Elstad, supra, is not

on point; although a failure to give Miranda warnings beforeone individual statement does not necessarily bar the admission of a subsequent statement given after adequate warn-ings, 470 U. S. 298; cf. Missouri v. Seibert, ante, at 614-615
(plurality opinion), that rule obviously does not apply tophysical evidence seized once and for all.

There is no way to read this case except as an unjustifiableinvitation to law enforcement officers to flout Miranda when

there may be physical evidence to be gained. The incentiveis an odd one, coming from the Court on the same day it
decides Missouri v. Seibert, ante, p. 600. I respectfullydissent.

Justice Breyer, dissenting.
For reasons similar to those set forth in Justice Souter'sdissent and in my concurring opinion in

Missouri v. Seibert,ante, at 617, I would extend to this context the "fruit of the

poisonous tree" approach, which I believe the Court hascome close to adopting in Seibert. Under that approach,

2 To the extent that Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U. S. 433 (1974) (admitting
the testimony of a witness who was discovered because of an unwarned
custodial interrogation), created another exception to Miranda, it is off
the point here. In Tucker, we explicitly declined to lay down a broad
rule about the fruits of unwarned statements. Instead, we "place[d] our
holding on a narrower ground," relying principally on the fact that the
interrogation occurred before Miranda was decided and was conducted in
good faith according to constitutional standards governing at that time.

HOLLAND, WARDEN v. JACKSON
on petition for writ of certiorari to the unitedstates court of appeals for the sixth circuit

No. 03-1200. Decided June 28, 2004
Tennessee's principal evidence at respondent's murder trial was Jonathan

Hughes' eyewitness testimony that he was at the scene with Melissa
Gooch, who did not testify. Respondent was convicted and sentenced
to life imprisonment. After unsuccessfully moving for a new trial, he
sought state postconviction relief, alleging, inter alia, that his trial
counsel had been ineffective in failing to conduct an adequate investigation. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668. The trial court denied relief after an evidentiary hearing, finding that counsel's performance was not deficient and that, in any event, respondent suffered no
prejudice. Respondent then moved for a new trial, claiming for the
first time--after seven years--that Gooch would testify that she was
not with Hughes on the night in question. The trial court denied the
motion. In affirming that denial, the State Court of Criminal Appeals
found that respondent had filed an earlier such motion and given no
satisfactory reason for failing to locate Gooch in seven years, and that
Gooch's testimony would only impeach Hughes' memory. In affirming
the denial of postconviction relief, the court noted that there had been
no showing on the record of favorable evidence that counsel could have
elicited from Gooch and that respondent's pleading did not contradict
what Hughes claimed to have seen. The Federal District Court
granted the State summary judgment on respondent's subsequent federal habeas claim, finding the state court's application of Strickland
erroneous but not unreasonable within the meaning of 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254(d)(1). The Sixth Circuit reversed, concluding that the state court
had unreasonably applied Strickland, given that Gooch's statement undermined Hughes' credibility, and finding that the state court's opinion was contrary to Strickland because it assessed prejudice under
a preponderance-of-the-evidence, rather than a reasonable-probability,
standard.

Held: The Sixth Circuit erred in granting relief under $ 2254(d)(1). First,

it found the state court's application of Strickland unreasonable on the
basis of evidence not properly before the state court. Although the
state court ventured that it would deny relief on the merits taking
Gooch's statement into account, its judgment also rested on the holding
that her statement was not properly before it. Granting relief in disre542US2 Unit: $U78 [10-26-06 13:23:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN

gard of this independent basis for decision was error, for the question
whether a state court's decision was unreasonable must be assessed in
light of the record before that court, see, e. g., Yarborough v. Gentry,
540 U. S. 1, 6. Second, the Sixth Circuit erred in holding that the state
court required proof by a preponderance of the evidence. The state
court recited the correct reasonable-probability standard, but the Sixth
Circuit inferred from three subsequent passages in the state court's
opinion that the state court had actually applied a preponderance standard. In doing so, the Sixth Circuit ignored $ 2254(d)'s requirements that
"state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt," Woodford v.
Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 24, and that "readiness to attribute error is inconsistent with the presumption that state courts know and follow the
law," ibid.

Certiorari granted; 80 Fed. Appx. 392, reversed and remanded.

Per Curiam.

I

Respondent Jessie Jackson was tried in 1987 by the State
of Tennessee for the murder of James Crawley. The State
asserted that he had shot Crawley after an argument over
drugs. Its principal evidence at trial was the eyewitness
testimony of Jonathan Hughes, who claimed to have been at
the scene with his girlfriend Melissa Gooch when the shooting occurred. Gooch did not testify. The jury convicted,
and respondent was sentenced to life imprisonment.

After unsuccessfully moving for a new trial, respondent
sought state postconviction relief, alleging, inter alia, that
his trial counsel had been ineffective in failing to conduct an
adequate investigation. See Strickland v. Washington, 466
U. S. 668 (1984). The state court held an evidentiary hearing and then denied the petition, finding that counsel's performance was not deficient and that, in any event, respondent
suffered no prejudice. Respondent then filed a "Motion for
Hearing in Nature of Motion for New Trial," alleging newly
discovered evidence. He claimed for the first time--seven
years after his conviction--that Gooch would now testify
that, contrary to Hughes' trial testimony, she was not with

Per Curiam
Hughes on the night of the shooting. The state court deniedthis motion, and respondent appealed both rulings to the

Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals.That court affirmed. It upheld the denial of new trial,
observing that respondent had already filed an earlier suchmotion, that there was "no satisfactory reason given for the
defendant's failure to locate this witness" during the seven
years that had elapsed, and that the proposed testimony"would serve merely to impeach Hughes' memory about having seen [Gooch] that night." App. to Pet. for Cert. 88. Italso affirmed the denial of postconviction relief, noting that
there had never "been any showing on the record of favorable testimony that would have been elicited" from Gooch
had counsel interviewed her, and that even crediting respondent's "unsubstantiated pleading," "it in no way rises
to the level of contradicting what Hughes claims to have
seen" respecting the shooting itself. Id., at 96-97 (emphasis added).

Respondent then sought federal habeas relief, and the District Court granted the State's motion for summary judgment. It found that there had been ineffective assistance of
counsel, noting several shortcomings and opining that there
was a reasonable probability of prejudice. It observed,
however, that it could grant relief only if the state court's
adjudication of respondent's claim was "contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established
Federal law." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1). It concluded that the
state court's application of Strickland, while erroneous, was
not unreasonable.

The Sixth Circuit reversed. 80 Fed. Appx. 392 (2003).
Although it found a number of flaws in counsel's performance, its grant of relief under $ 2254(d)(1) was based on only
two specific grounds: first, that the state court had unreasonably applied Strickland, given that Gooch's statement undermined the credibility of Hughes' testimony; and second, that
the state court's opinion was contrary to Strickland because

it assessed prejudice under a preponderance-of-the-evidence
standard rather than a reasonable-probability standard.

We now grant the State's petition for a writ of certiorari
and respondent's motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, and reverse.

A

The Sixth Circuit erred in finding the state court's application of Strickland unreasonable on the basis of evidence not
properly before the state court. Although the state court
had ventured that it would deny relief on the merits even
taking Gooch's statement into account, its judgment also
rested on the holding that the statement was not properly
before it. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 86-89, 95-98. Granting relief in disregard of this independent basis for decision
was error.

The "unreasonable application" clause of $ 2254(d)(1) applies when the "state court identifies the correct governing
legal principle from this Court's decisions but unreasonably
applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner's case."
Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 413 (2000). In this and
related contexts we have made clear that whether a state
court's decision was unreasonable must be assessed in light
of the record the court had before it. See Yarborough v.
Gentry, 540 U. S. 1, 6 (2003) (per curiam) (denying relief
where state court's application of federal law was "supported
by the record"); Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 348
(2003) (reasonableness of state court's factual finding assessed "in light of the record before the court"); cf. Bell v.
Cone, 535 U. S. 685, 697, n. 4 (2002) (declining to consider
evidence not presented to state court in determining
whether its decision was contrary to federal law).

Under the habeas statute, Gooch's statement could have
been the subject of an evidentiary hearing by the District
Court, but only if respondent was not at fault in failing to

542US2 Unit: $U78 [10-26-06 13:23:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Per Curiam
develop that evidence in state court, or (if he was at fault)
if the conditions prescribed by $ 2254(e)(2) were met. See
Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, 431-437 (2000). Those
same restrictions apply a fortiori when a prisoner seeks relief based on new evidence without an evidentiary hearing.
See, e. g., Cargle v. Mullin, 317 F. 3d 1196, 1209 (CA10 2003),
and cases cited. Where new evidence is admitted, some
Courts of Appeals have conducted de novo review on the
theory that there is no relevant state-court determination to
which one could defer. See, e. g., Monroe v. Angelone, 323
F. 3d 286, 297-299, and n. 19 (CA4 2003). Assuming, arguendo, that this analysis is correct and that it applies where,
as here, the evidence does not support a new claim but
merely buttresses a previously rejected one, it cannot support the Sixth Circuit's action.

The District Court made no finding that respondent had
been diligent in pursuing Gooch's testimony (and thus that

$ 2254(e)(2) was inapplicable) or that the limitations set forth
in $ 2254(e)(2) were met. Nor did the Sixth Circuit independently inquire into these matters; it simply ignored entirely the state court's independent ground for its decision,
that Gooch's statement was not properly before it. It is difficult to see, moreover, how respondent could claim due diligence given the 7-year delay. He complains that his state
postconviction counsel did not heed his pleas for assistance.
See App. to Pet. for Cert. 65. Attorney negligence, however, is chargeable to the client and precludes relief unless
the conditions of $ 2254(e)(2) are satisfied. See Williams,
supra, at 439-440; cf. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722,
753-754 (1991).

The Sixth Circuit therefore erred in finding the state
court's decision an unreasonable application of Strickland.*

*We reject respondent's contention that the State failed adequately to
preserve this error. See, e. g., Final Brief for Appellee in No. 01-5720
(CA6), p. 18, and n. 3.

The Sixth Circuit also erred in holding that the state courtacted contrary to federal law by requiring proof of prejudice

by a preponderance of the evidence rather than by a reason-able probability. The state court began by reciting the correct Strickland standard:

" `[T]he defendant must show that there is a reasonableprobability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors,

the result of the proceeding would have been different.A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.' " App. to Pet. forCert. 95 (quoting Strickland, 466 U. S., at 694).

The Sixth Circuit nevertheless concluded that the state courthad actually applied a preponderance standard, based on
three subsequent passages from its opinion.First was the statement that "[i]n a post-conviction proceeding, the defendant has the burden of proving his allega-tions by a preponderance of the evidence." App. to Pet. for
Cert. 95. In context, however, this statement is reasonablyread as addressing the general burden of proof in postconviction proceedings with regard to factual contentions--for ex-ample, those relating to whether defense counsel's performance was deficient. Although it is possible to read it asreferring also to the question whether the deficiency was
prejudicial, thereby supplanting Strickland, such a readingwould needlessly create internal inconsistency in the opinion.

Second was the statement that "it is asking too much thatwe draw the inference that the jury would not have believed
Hughes at all had Melissa Gooch testified." App. to Pet. forCert. 96. Although the Court of Appeals evidently thought
that this passage intimated a preponderance standard, it isdifficult to see why. The quoted language does not imply
any particular standard of probability.Last was the statement that respondent had "failed to
carry his burden of proving that the outcome of the trial

ASHCROFT, ATTORNEY GENERAL v. AMERICANCIVIL LIBERTIES UNION

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 03-218. Argued March 2, 2004--Decided June 29, 2004
To protect minors from exposure to sexually explicit materials on the Internet, Congress enacted the Child Online Protection Act (COPA), 47
U. S. C. $ 231, which, among other things, imposes a $50,000 fine and six
months in prison for the knowing posting, for "commercial purposes,"

$ 231(a)(1), of World Wide Web content that is "harmful to minors," but
provides an affirmative defense to commercial Web speakers who restrict access to prohibited materials by "requiring use of a credit card"
or "any other reasonable measures that are feasible under available
technology," $ 231(c)(1). COPA was enacted in response to Reno v.
American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, in which this Court held
that the Communications Decency Act of 1996, Congress' first attempt
to make the Internet safe for minors by criminalizing certain Internet
speech, was unconstitutional because it was not narrowly tailored to
serve a compelling governmental interest and because less restrictive
alternatives were available. Respondents, Web speakers and others
concerned with protecting the freedom of speech, filed suit for a preliminary injunction against COPA's enforcement. After considering testimony presented by both respondents and the Government, the District
Court granted the preliminary injunction, concluding that respondents
were likely to prevail on their argument that there were less restrictive
alternatives to COPA, particularly blocking or filtering technology.
The Third Circuit affirmed on different grounds, but this Court reversed, Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union, 535 U. S. 564. On
remand, the Third Circuit again affirmed, concluding, inter alia, that
COPA was not the least restrictive means available for the Government
to serve the interest of preventing minors from using the Internet to
gain access to harmful materials.

Held: The Third Circuit was correct to affirm the District Court's ruling

that enforcement of COPA should be enjoined because the statute likely
violates the First Amendment. Pp. 664-673.

(a) The District Court did not abuse its discretion when it entered
the preliminary injunction. The abuse-of-discretion standard applies
on review of such an injunction. Because 28 U. S. C. $ 1254(1)'s grant
of appellate jurisdiction does not give this Court license to depart from

Syllabus
an established review standard, Walters v. National Assn. of Radiation
Survivors, 473 U. S. 305, 336, the injunction must be upheld and the case
remanded for trial on the merits if the underlying constitutional question is close. There is therefore no need to consider the broader constructions of the statute adopted by the Court of Appeals. The District
Court concentrated primarily on the argument that there are plausible,
less restrictive alternatives to COPA. See Reno, 521 U. S., at 874.
When plaintiffs challenge a content-based speech restriction, the Government has the burden to prove that the proposed alternatives will not
be as effective as the challenged statute. Ibid. The purpose of the
test is to ensure that speech is restricted no further than is necessary
to accomplish Congress' goal. The District Court's conclusion that respondents were likely to prevail was not an abuse of discretion, because,
on the record, the Government has not met its burden. Most importantly, respondents propose that blocking and filtering software is a less
restrictive alternative, and the Government had not shown it would be
likely to disprove that contention at trial. Filters impose selective restrictions on speech at the receiving end, not universal restrictions at
the source. Under a filtering regime, childless adults may gain access
to speech they have a right to see without having to identify themselves
or provide their credit card information. Even adults with children
may obtain access to the same speech on the same terms simply by
turning off the filter on their home computers. Promoting filter use
does not condemn as criminal any category of speech, and so the potential chilling effect is eliminated, or at least much diminished. Filters,
moreover, may well be more effective than COPA. First, the record
demonstrates that a filter can prevent minors from seeing all pornography, not just pornography posted to the Web from America. That
COPA does not prevent minors from accessing foreign harmful materials alone makes it possible that filtering software might be more effective in serving Congress' goals. COPA's effectiveness is likely to diminish even further if it is upheld, because providers of the materials
covered by the statute simply can move their operations overseas. In
addition, the District Court found that verification systems may be subject to evasion and circumvention, e. g., by minors who have their own
credit cards. Finally, filters also may be more effective because they
can be applied to all forms of Internet communication, including e-mail,
not just the World Wide Web. Filtering's superiority to COPA is confirmed by the explicit findings of the Commission on Child Online Protection, which Congress created to evaluate the relative merits of different means of restricting minors' ability to gain access to harmful
materials on the Internet. 47 U. S. C. $ 231, note. Although filtering
software is not a perfect solution because it may block some materials

Syllabus
not harmful to minors and fail to catch some that are, the Government
has not satisfied its burden to introduce specific evidence proving that
filters are less effective. The argument that filtering software is not
an available alternative because Congress may not require its use carries little weight, since Congress may act to encourage such use by
giving strong incentives to schools and libraries, United States v. American Library Assn., Inc., 539 U. S. 194, and by promoting the development of filters by industry and their use by parents. The closest precedent is United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S.
803, which, like this case, involved a content-based restriction designed
to protect minors from viewing harmful materials. The Court there
concluded that, absent a showing that a less restrictive technological
alternative already available to parents would not be as effective as
a blanket speech restriction, the more restrictive option preferred by
Congress could not survive strict scrutiny. Id., at 826. The reasoning
of Playboy Entertainment Group, and the holdings and force of this
Court's precedents, compel the Court to affirm the preliminary injunction here. To do otherwise would be to do less than the First Amendment commands. Id., at 830. Pp. 664-670.

(b) Important practical reasons also support letting the injunction
stand pending a full trial on the merits. First, the potential harms from
reversal outweigh those of leaving the injunction in place by mistake.
Extraordinary harm and a serious chill upon protected speech may result where, as here, a prosecution is a likely possibility but only an affirmative defense is available, so that speakers may self-censor rather
than risk the perils of trial. Cf. Playboy Entertainment Group, supra,
at 817. The harm done from letting the injunction stand pending a trial
on the merits, in contrast, will not be extensive. Second, there are
substantial factual disputes remaining in the case, including a serious
gap in the evidence as to the filtering software's effectiveness. By
allowing the preliminary injunction to stand and remanding for trial,
the Court requires the Government to shoulder its full constitutional
burden of proof respecting the less restrictive alternative argument,
rather than excuse it from doing so. Third, the factual record does not
reflect current technological reality--a serious flaw in any case involving the Internet, which evolves at a rapid pace. It is reasonable to
assume that technological developments important to the First Amendment analysis have occurred in the five years since the District Court
made its factfindings. By affirming the preliminary injunction and remanding for trial, the Court allows the parties to update and supplement
the factual record to reflect current technology. Remand will also permit the District Court to take account of a changed legal landscape:
Since that court made its factfindings, Congress has passed at least two

(COPA), 112 Stat. 2681-736, codified at 47 U. S. C. $ 231. Wemust decide whether the Court of Appeals was correct to

affirm a ruling by the District Court that enforcement ofCOPA should be enjoined because the statute likely violates
the First Amendment.In enacting COPA, Congress gave consideration to our
earlier decisions on this subject, in particular the decision in
Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844(1997). For that reason, "the Judiciary must proceed with

caution and . . . with care before invalidating the Act." Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union, 535 U. S. 564, 592
(2002) (Ashcroft I) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).
The imperative of according respect to the Congress, however, does not permit us to depart from well-established
First Amendment principles. Instead, we must hold the
Government to its constitutional burden of proof.

Content-based prohibitions, enforced by severe criminal
penalties, have the constant potential to be a repressive force
in the lives and thoughts of a free people. To guard against
that threat the Constitution demands that content-based restrictions on speech be presumed invalid, R. A. V. v. St. Paul,
505 U. S. 377, 382 (1992), and that the Government bear the
burden of showing their constitutionality, United States v.
Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 817
(2000). This is true even when Congress twice has attempted to find a constitutional means to restrict, and punish, the speech in question.

This case comes to the Court on certiorari review of an
appeal from the decision of the District Court granting a
preliminary injunction. The Court of Appeals reviewed the
decision of the District Court for abuse of discretion. Under
that standard, the Court of Appeals was correct to conclude
that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction. The Government has failed,
at this point, to rebut the plaintiffs' contention that there are
plausible, less restrictive alternatives to the statute. Sub542US2 Unit: $U79 [10-30-06 07:07:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

stantial practical considerations, furthermore, argue in favor
of upholding the injunction and allowing the case to proceed
to trial. For those reasons, we affirm the decision of the
Court of Appeals upholding the preliminary injunction, and
we remand the case so that it may be returned to the District
Court for trial on the issues presented.

I
A

COPA is the second attempt by Congress to make the Internet safe for minors by criminalizing certain Internet
speech. The first attempt was the Communications Decency
Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-104, $ 502, 110 Stat. 133, 47 U. S. C.

$ 223 (1994 ed., Supp. II). The Court held the CDA unconstitutional because it was not narrowly tailored to serve a
compelling governmental interest and because less restrictive alternatives were available. Reno, supra.

In response to the Court's decision in Reno, Congress
passed COPA. COPA imposes cr iminal pena lties of a
$50,000 fine and six months in prison for the knowing posting, for "commercial purposes," of World Wide Web content
that is "harmful to minors." $ 231(a)(1). Material that is
"harmful to minors" is defined as:

"any communication, picture, image, graphic image file,
article, recording, writing, or other matter of any kind
that is obscene or that--

"(A) the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find, taking the material as a
whole and with respect to minors, is designed to appeal
to, or is designed to pander to, the prurient interest;

"(B) depicts, describes, or represents, in a manner patently offensive with respect to minors, an actual or
simulated sexual act or sexual contact, an actual or
simulated normal or perverted sexual act, or a lewd

Opinion of the Court
exhibition of the genitals or post-pubescent female
breast; and

"(C) taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors." $ 231(e)(6).

"Minor[s]" are defined as "any person under 17 years of
age." $ 231(e)(7). A person acts for "commercial purposes
only if such person is engaged in the business of making such
communications." "Engaged in the business," in turn,

"means that the person who makes a communication, or
offers to make a communication, by means of the World
Wide Web, that includes any material that is harmful to
minors, devotes time, attention, or labor to such activities, as a regular course of such person's trade or business, with the objective of earning a profit as a result of
such activities (although it is not necessary that the person make a profit or that the making or offering to make
such communications be the person's sole or principal
business or source of income)." $ 231(e)(2).

While the statute labels all speech that falls within these
definitions as criminal speech, it also provides an affirmative
defense to those who employ specified means to prevent minors from gaining access to the prohibited materials on their
Web site. A person may escape conviction under the statute
by demonstrating that he

"has restricted access by minors to material that is
harmful to minors--

"(A) by requiring use of a credit card, debit account,
adult access code, or adult personal identification
number;

"(B) by accepting a digital certificate that verifies age;
or

"(C) by any other reasonable measures that are feasible
under available technology." $ 231(c)(1).

Opinion of the Court
Since the passage of COPA, Congress has enacted addi-tional laws regulating the Internet in an attempt to protect

minors. For example, it has enacted a prohibition on mis-leading Internet domain names, 18 U. S. C. $ 2252B (2000 ed.,
Supp. III), in order to prevent Web site owners from disguis-ing pornographic Web sites in a way likely to cause uninterested persons to visit them. See Brief for Petitioner 7 (giv-ing, as an example, the Web site "whitehouse.com"). It has
also passed a statute creating a "Dot Kids" second-level In-ternet domain, the content of which is restricted to that
which is fit for minors under the age of 13. 47 U. S. C. $ 941(2000 ed., Supp. II).

B
Respondents, Internet content providers and others con-cerned with protecting the freedom of speech, filed suit in

the United States District Court for the Eastern Districtof Pennsylvania. They sought a preliminary injunction
against enforcement of the statute. After considering testi-mony from witnesses presented by both respondents and the
Government, the District Court issued an order granting thepreliminary injunction. The court first noted that the statute would place a burden on some protected speech. Amer-ican Civil Liberties Union v. Reno, 31 F. Supp. 2d 473, 495
(1999). The court then concluded that respondents werelikely to prevail on their argument that there were less restrictive alternatives to the statute: "On the record to date,it is not apparent . . . that [petitioner] can meet its burden to
prove that COPA is the least restrictive means available toachieve the goal of restricting the access of minors" to harmful material. Id., at 497. In particular, it noted that "[t]herecord before the Court reveals that blocking or filtering
technology may be at least as successful as COPA would bein restricting minors' access to harmful material online without imposing the burden on constitutionally protected speechthat COPA imposes on adult users or Web site operators."

Opinion of the Court
The Government appealed the District Court's decision to
the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
The Court of Appeals affirmed the preliminary injunction,
but on a different ground. American Civil Liberties Union
v. Reno, 217 F. 3d 162, 166 (2000). The court concluded that
the "community standards" language in COPA by itself
rendered the statute unconstitutionally overbroad. Ibid.
We granted certiorari and reversed, holding that the
community-standards language did not, standing alone, make
the statute unconstitutionally overbroad. Ashcroft I, 535
U. S., at 585. We emphasized, however, that our decision
was limited to that narrow issue. Ibid. We remanded the
case to the Court of Appeals to reconsider whether the District Court had been correct to grant the preliminary injunction. On remand, the Court of Appeals again affirmed the
District Court. 322 F. 3d 240 (2003). The Court of Appeals
concluded that the statute was not narrowly tailored to serve
a compelling Government interest, was overbroad, and was
not the least restrictive means available for the Government
to serve the interest of preventing minors from using the
Internet to gain access to materials that are harmful to
them. Id., at 266-271. The Government once again sought
review from this Court, and we again granted certiorari.

"This Court, like other appellate courts, has always applied the abuse of discretion standard on review of a preliminary injunction." Walters v. National Assn. of Radiation
Survivors, 473 U. S. 305, 336 (1985) (O'Connor, J., concurring) (internal quotation marks omitted). "The grant of appellate jurisdiction under [28 U. S. C.] $ 1252 does not give
the Court license to depart from established standards of

question is close, therefore, we should uphold the injunction

Opinion of the Court
and remand for trial on the merits. Applying this mode of
inquiry, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the District
Court did not abuse its discretion in entering the preliminary
injunction. Our reasoning in support of this conclusion,
however, is based on narrower, more specific grounds than
the rationale the Court of Appeals adopted. The Court of
Appeals, in its opinion affirming the decision of the District
Court, construed a number of terms in the statute, and held
that COPA, so construed, was unconstitutional. None of
those constructions of statutory terminology, however, were
relied on by or necessary to the conclusions of the District
Court. Instead, the District Court concluded only that the
statute was likely to burden some speech that is protected
for adults, 31 F. Supp. 2d, at 495, which petitioner does not
dispute. As to the definitional disputes, the District Court
concluded only that respondents' interpretation was "not unreasonable," and relied on their interpretation only to conclude that respondents had standing to challenge the statute,
id., at 481, which, again, petitioner does not dispute. Because we affirm the District Court's decision to grant the
preliminary injunction for the reasons relied on by the District Court, we decline to consider the correctness of the
other arguments relied on by the Court of Appeals.

The District Court, in deciding to grant the preliminary
injunction, concentrated primarily on the argument that
there are plausible, less restrictive alternatives to COPA.
A statute that "effectively suppresses a large amount of
speech that adults have a constitutional right to receive and
to address to one another . . . is unacceptable if less restrictive alternatives would be at least as effective in achieving
the legitimate purpose that the statute was enacted to
serve." Reno, 521 U. S., at 874. When plaintiffs challenge
a content-based speech restriction, the burden is on the Government to prove that the proposed alternatives will not be
as effective as the challenged statute. Ibid.

542US2 Unit: $U79 [10-30-06 07:07:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
666 ASHCROFT v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION

Opinion of the Court
In considering this question, a court assumes that certainprotected speech may be regulated, and then asks what is

the least restrictive alternative that can be used to achievethat goal. The purpose of the test is not to consider
whether the challenged restriction has some effect in achiev-ing Congress' goal, regardless of the restriction it imposes.
The purpose of the test is to ensure that speech is restricted
no further than necessary to achieve the goal, for it is impor-tant to ensure that legitimate speech is not chilled or punished. For that reason, the test does not begin with thestatus quo of existing regulations, then ask whether the challenged restriction has some additional ability to achieve Congress' legitimate interest. Any restriction on speech could
be justified under that analysis. Instead, the court should
ask whether the challenged regulation is the least restrictive
means among available, effective alternatives.

In deciding whether to grant a preliminary injunction, a
district court must consider whether the plaintiffs have demonstrated that they are likely to prevail on the merits. See,
e. g., Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422 U. S. 922, 931 (1975).
(The court also considers whether the plaintiff has shown
irreparable injury, see ibid., but the parties in this case
do not contest the correctness of the District Court's conclusion that a likelihood of irreparable injury had been established. See 31 F. Supp. 2d, at 497-498.) As the Government bears the burden of proof on the ultimate question of
COPA's constitutionality, respondents must be deemed likely
to prevail unless the Government has shown that respondents' proposed less restrictive alternatives are less effective
than COPA. Applying that analysis, the District Court concluded that respondents were likely to prevail. Id., at 496-
497. That conclusion was not an abuse of discretion, because
on this record there are a number of plausible, less restrictive alternatives to the statute.

The primary alternative considered by the District Court
was blocking and filtering software. Blocking and filtering

542US2 Unit: $U79 [10-30-06 07:07:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

667Cite as: 542 U. S. 656 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
software is an alternative that is less restrictive than COPA,and, in addition, likely more effective as a means of restricting children's access to materials harmful to them. The Dis-trict Court, in granting the preliminary injunction, did so
primarily because the plaintiffs had proposed that filters area less restrictive alternative to COPA and the Government
had not shown it would be likely to disprove the plaintiffs'
contention at trial. Ibid.Filters are less restrictive than COPA. They impose selective restrictions on speech at the receiving end, not uni-versal restrictions at the source. Under a filtering regime,
adults without children may gain access to speech they have
a right to see without having to identify themselves or provide their credit card information. Even adults with children may obtain access to the same speech on the same
terms simply by turning off the filter on their home computers. Above all, promoting the use of filters does not condemn as criminal any category of speech, and so the potential
chilling effect is eliminated, or at least much diminished.
All of these things are true, moreover, regardless of how
broadly or narrowly the definitions in COPA are construed.

Filters also may well be more effective than COPA.
First, a filter can prevent minors from seeing all pornography, not just pornography posted to the Web from America.
The District Court noted in its factfindings that one witness
estimated that 40% of harmful-to-minors content comes from
overseas. Id., at 484. COPA does not prevent minors from
having access to those foreign harmful materials. That
alone makes it possible that filtering software might be more
effective in serving Congress' goals. Effectiveness is likely
to diminish even further if COPA is upheld, because the providers of the materials that would be covered by the statute
simply can move their operations overseas. It is not an answer to say that COPA reaches some amount of materials
that are harmful to minors; the question is whether it would
reach more of them than less restrictive alternatives. In

542US2 Unit: $U79 [10-30-06 07:07:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
668 ASHCROFT v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION

Opinion of the Court
addition, the District Court found that verification systemsmay be subject to evasion and circumvention, for example,

by minors who have their own credit cards. See id., at 484,496-497. Finally, filters also may be more effective because
they can be applied to all forms of Internet communication,including e-mail, not just communications available via the
World Wide Web.

That filtering software may well be more effective thanCOPA is confirmed by the findings of the Commission on

Child Online Protection, a blue-ribbon Commission createdby Congress in COPA itself. Congress directed the Commission to evaluate the relative merits of different means of
restricting minors' ability to gain access to harmful materials
on the Internet. Note following 47 U. S. C. $ 231. It unambiguously found that filters are more effective than ageverification requirements. See Commission on Child Online
Protection (COPA), Report to Congress 19-21, 23-25, 27
(Oct. 20, 2000) (assigning a score for "Effectiveness" of 7.4
for server-based filters and 6.5 for client-based filters, as
compared to 5.9 for independent adult-ID verification, and
5.5 for credit card verification). Thus, not only has the Government failed to carry its burden of showing the District
Court that the proposed alternative is less effective, but also
a Government Commission appointed to consider the question has concluded just the opposite. That finding supports
our conclusion that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in enjoining the statute.

Filtering software, of course, is not a perfect solution to
the problem of children gaining access to harmful-to-minors
materials. It may block some materials that are not harmful to minors and fail to catch some that are. See 31 F. Supp.
2d, at 492. Whatever the deficiencies of filters, however, the
Government failed to introduce specific evidence proving
that existing technologies are less effective than the restrictions in COPA. The District Court made a specific factfinding that "[n]o evidence was presented to the Court as to the

542US2 Unit: $U79 [10-30-06 07:07:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

669Cite as: 542 U. S. 656 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
percentage of time that blocking and filtering technology isover- or underinclusive."

Ibid. In the absence of a showing as to the relative effectiveness of COPA and the al-ternatives proposed by respondents, it was not an abuse of

discretion for the District Court to grant the preliminaryinjunction. The Government's burden is not merely to show
that a proposed less restrictive alternative has some flaws;
its burden is to show that it is less effective. Reno, 521U. S., at 874. It is not enough for the Government to show

that COPA has some effect. Nor do respondents bear a bur-den to introduce, or offer to introduce, evidence that their
proposed alternatives are more effective. The Government
has the burden to show they are less so. The Government
having failed to carry its burden, it was not an abuse of
discretion for the District Court to grant the preliminary
injunction.

One argument to the contrary is worth mentioning--the
argument that filtering software is not an available alternative because Congress may not require it to be used. That
argument carries little weight, because Congress undoubtedly may act to encourage the use of filters. We have held
that Congress can give strong incentives to schools and libraries to use them. United States v. American Library
Assn., Inc., 539 U. S. 194 (2003). It could also take steps
to promote their development by industry, and their use by
parents. It is incorrect, for that reason, to say that filters
are part of the current regulatory status quo. The need for
parental cooperation does not automatically disqualify a proposed less restrictive alternative. Playboy Entertainment
Group, 529 U. S., at 824 ("A court should not assume a plausible, less restrictive alternative would be ineffective; and a
court should not presume parents, given full information,
will fail to act"). In enacting COPA, Congress said its goal
was to prevent the "widespread availability of the Internet"
from providing "opportunities for minors to access materials
through the World Wide Web in a manner that can frustrate

parental supervision or control." Congressional Findings,note following 47 U. S. C. $ 231 (quoting Pub. L. 105-277, Tit.

XIV, $ 1402(1), 112 Stat. 2681-736). COPA presumes thatparents lack the ability, not the will, to monitor what their
children see. By enacting programs to promote use of fil-tering software, Congress could give parents that ability
without subjecting protected speech to severe penalties.The closest precedent on the general point is our decision
in Playboy Entertainment Group. Playboy Entertainment
Group, like this case, involved a content-based restrictiondesigned to protect minors from viewing harmful materials.

The choice was between a blanket speech restriction and amore specific technological solution that was available to parents who chose to implement it. 529 U. S., at 825. Absenta showing that the proposed less restrictive alternative
would not be as effective, we concluded, the more restrictiveoption preferred by Congress could not survive strict scrutiny. Id., at 826 (reversing because "[t]he record is silent asto the comparative effectiveness of the two alternatives").
In the instant case, too, the Government has failed to show,at this point, that the proposed less restrictive alternative
will be less effective. The reasoning of Playboy Entertainment Group and the holdings and force of our precedentsrequire us to affirm the preliminary injunction. To do otherwise would be to do less than the First Amendment com-mands. "The `starch' in our constitutional standards cannot
be sacrificed to accommodate the enforcement choices of theGovernment." Id., at 830 (

Thomas, J., concurring).

B
There are also important practical reasons to let the in-junction stand pending a full trial on the merits. First, the

potential harms from reversing the injunction outweighthose of leaving it in place by mistake. Where a prosecution
is a likely possibility, yet only an affirmative defense is avail-able, speakers may self-censor rather than risk the perils of

Opinion of the Court
trial. There is a potential for extraordinary harm and a se-rious chill upon protected speech. Cf.

id., at 817 ("Error in
marking that line exacts an extraordinary cost"). The harmdone from letting the injunction stand pending a trial on the

merits, in contrast, will not be extensive. No prosecutionshave yet been undertaken under the law, so none will be
disrupted if the injunction stands. Further, if the injunction is upheld, the Government in the interim can enforceobscenity laws already on the books.

Second, there are substantial factual disputes remaining inthe case. As mentioned above, there is a serious gap in the
evidence as to the effectiveness of filtering software. See
supra, at 668. For us to assume, without proof, that filters
are less effective than COPA would usurp the District
Court's factfinding role. By allowing the preliminary injunction to stand and remanding for trial, we require the
Government to shoulder its full constitutional burden of
proof respecting the less restrictive alternative argument,
rather than excuse it from doing so.

Third, and on a related point, the factual record does not
reflect current technological reality--a serious flaw in any
case involving the Internet. The technology of the Internet
evolves at a rapid pace. Yet the factfindings of the District
Court were entered in February 1999, over five years ago.
Since then, certain facts about the Internet are known to
have changed. Compare, e. g., 31 F. Supp. 2d, at 481 (36.7
million Internet hosts as of July 1998), with Internet Systems Consortium, Internet Domain Survey, Jan. 2004, http://
www.isc.org/index.pl?/ops/ds (as visited June 22, 2004, and
available in Clerk of Court's case file) (233.1 million hosts as
of Jan. 2004). It is reasonable to assume that other technological developments important to the First Amendment
analysis have also occurred during that time. More and better filtering alternatives may exist than when the District
Court entered its findings. Indeed, we know that after the
District Court entered its factfindings, a congressionally ap542US2 Unit: $U79 [10-30-06 07:07:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
672 ASHCROFT v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION

Opinion of the Court
pointed commission issued a report that found that filters are
more effective than verification screens. See supra, at 668.

Delay between the time that a district court makes factfindings and the time that a case reaches this Court is inevitable, with the necessary consequence that there will be
some discrepancy between the facts as found and the facts
at the time the appellate court takes up the question. See,
e. g., Benjamin, Stepping into the Same River Twice: Rapidly
Changing Facts and the Appellate Process, 78 Texas L. Rev.
269, 290-296 (1999) (noting the problems presented for appellate courts by changing facts in the context of cases involving
the Internet, and giving as a specific example the Court's
decision in Reno, 521 U. S. 844). We do not mean, therefore,
to set up an insuperable obstacle to fair review. Here, however, the usual gap has doubled because the case has been
through the Court of Appeals twice. The additional two
years might make a difference. By affirming the preliminary injunction and remanding for trial, we allow the parties
to update and supplement the factual record to reflect current technological realities.

Remand will also permit the District Court to take account of a changed legal landscape. Since the District Court
made its factfindings, Congress has passed at least two further statutes that might qualify as less restrictive alternatives to COPA--a prohibition on misleading domain names,
and a statute creating a minors-safe "Dot Kids" domain.
See supra, at 663. Remanding for trial will allow the District Court to take into account those additional potential
alternatives.

On a final point, it is important to note that this opinion
does not hold that Congress is incapable of enacting any regulation of the Internet designed to prevent minors from gaining access to harmful materials. The parties, because of the
conclusion of the Court of Appeals that the statute's definitions rendered it unconstitutional, did not devote their atten542US2 Unit: $U79 [10-30-06 07:07:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Stevens, J., concurring
tion to the question whether further evidence might be intro-duced on the relative restrictiveness and effectiveness of alternatives to the statute. On remand, however, the partieswill be able to introduce further evidence on this point.
This opinion does not foreclose the District Court from con-cluding, upon a proper showing by the Government that
meets the Government's constitutional burden as defined inthis opinion, that COPA is the least restrictive alternative
available to accomplish Congress' goal.

* * *
On this record, the Government has not shown that theless restrictive alternatives proposed by respondents should

be disregarded. Those alternatives, indeed, may be moreeffective than the provisions of COPA. The District Court
did not abuse its discretion when it entered the preliminaryinjunction. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,concurring.

When it first reviewed the constitutionality of the ChildOnline Protection Act (COPA), the Court of Appeals held
that the statute's use of "contemporary community stand-ards" to identify materials that are "harmful to minors" was
a serious, and likely fatal, defect. American Civil Liberties
Union v. Reno, 217 F. 3d 162 (CA3 2000). I have alreadyexplained at some length why I agree with that holding.

See Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union, 535 U. S.564, 603 (2002) (dissenting opinion) ("In the context of the
Internet, . . . community standards become a sword, ratherthan a shield. If a prurient appeal is offensive in a puritan
village, it may be a crime to post it on the World Wide Web").

I continue to believe that the Government may not penalizespeakers for making available to the general World Wide

Web audience that which the least tolerant communities inAmerica deem unfit for their children's consumption, cf.

Reno
v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 878 (1997),and consider that principle a sufficient basis for deciding

this case.

But COPA's use of community standards is not the stat-ute's only constitutional defect. Today's decision points to

another: that, as far as the record reveals, encouraging de-ployment of user-based controls, such as filtering software,
would serve Congress' interest in protecting minors from
sexually explicit Internet materials as well or better than
attempting to regulate the vast content of the World Wide
Web at its source, and at a far less significant cost to First
Amendment values.

In reg istering my agreement with the Court's lessrestrictive-means analysis, I wish to underscore just how restrictive COPA is. COPA is a content-based restraint on
the dissemination of constitutionally protected speech. It
enforces its prohibitions by way of the criminal law, threatening noncompliant Web speakers with a fine of as much as
$50,000, and a term of imprisonment as long as six months,
for each offense. 47 U. S. C. $ 231(a). Speakers who "intentionally" violate COPA are punishable by a fine of up to
$50,000 for each day of the violation. Ibid. And because
implementation of the various adult-verification mechanisms
described in the statute provides only an affirmative defense,

$ 231(c)(1), even full compliance with COPA cannot guarantee
freedom from prosecution. Speakers who dutifully place
their content behind age screens may nevertheless find
themselves in court, forced to prove the lawfulness of their
speech on pain of criminal conviction. Cf. Ashcroft v. Free
Speech Coalition, 535 U. S. 234, 255 (2002).

Criminal prosecutions are, in my view, an inappropriate
means to regulate the universe of materials classified as "ob542US2 Unit: $U79 [10-30-06 07:07:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

675Cite as: 542 U. S. 656 (2004)

scene," since "the line between communications which `of-fend' and those which do not is too blurred to identify criminal conduct." Smith v. United States, 431 U. S. 291, 316(1977) (

Stevens, J., dissenting). See also Marks v. United
States, 430 U. S. 188, 198 (1977) (Stevens, J., concurring inpart and dissenting in part). COPA's creation of a new category of criminally punishable speech that is "harmful to
minors" only compounds the problem. It may be, as Justice Breyer contends, that the statute's coverage extends
"only slightly" beyond the legally obscene, and therefore in-trudes little into the realm of protected expression.

Post, at
679 (dissenting opinion). But even with Justice Breyer's
guidance, I find it impossible to identify just how far past
the already ill-defined territory of "obscenity" he thinks the
statute extends. Attaching criminal sanctions to a mistaken
judgment about the contours of the novel and nebulous category of "harmful to minors" speech clearly imposes a heavy
burden on the exercise of First Amendment freedoms.

COPA's criminal penalties are, moreover, strong medicine
for the ill that the statute seeks to remedy. To be sure,
our cases have recognized a compelling interest in protecting
minors from exposure to sexually explicit materials. See,
e. g., Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629, 640 (1968). As a
parent, grandparent, and great-grandparent, I endorse that
goal without reservation. As a judge, however, I must confess to a growing sense of unease when the interest in
protecting children from prurient materials is invoked as a
justification for using criminal regulation of speech as a substitute for, or a simple backup to, adult oversight of children's
viewing habits.

In view of the gravity of the burdens COPA imposes on
Web speech, the possibility that Congress might have accomplished the goal of protecting children from harmful materials by other, less drastic means is a matter to be considered
with special care. With that observation, I join the opinion
of the Court.

Breyer, J., dissenting
Justice Scalia, dissenting.
I agree with Justice Breyer's conclusion that the ChildOnline Protection Act (COPA), 47 U. S. C. $ 231, is constitutional. See post, at 689 (dissenting opinion). Both theCourt and

Justice Breyer err, however, in subjectingCOPA to strict scrutiny. Nothing in the First Amendment

entitles the type of material covered by COPA to that exact-ing standard of review. "We have recognized that commercial entities which engage in `the sordid business of pander-ing' by `deliberately emphasiz[ing] the sexually provocative
aspects of [their nonobscene products], in order to catch thesalaciously disposed,' engage in constitutionally unprotected
behavior." United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group,
Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 831 (2000) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (quotingGinzburg v. United States, 383 U. S. 463, 467, 472 (1966)).

See also Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., 535 U. S. 425,443-444 (2002) (

Scalia, J., concurring); FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U. S. 215, 256-261 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring inpart and dissenting in part).

There is no doubt that the commercial pornography cov-ered by COPA fits this description. The statute applies only
to a person who, "as a regular course of such person's tradeor business, with the objective of earning a profit," 47
U. S. C. $ 231(e)(2)(B), and "with knowledge of the characterof the material," $ 231(a)(1), communicates material that depicts certain specified sexual acts and that "is designed to
appeal to, or is designed to pander to, the prurient interest,"$ 231(e)(6)(A). Since this business could, consistent with the

First Amendment, be banned entirely, COPA's lesser restric-tions raise no constitutional concern.

Justice Breyer, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice O'Connor join, dissenting.

The Child Online Protection Act (Act), 47 U. S. C. $ 231,
seeks to protect children from exposure to commercial pornography placed on the Internet. It does so by requiring

Breyer, J., dissenting
commercial providers to place pornographic material behindInternet "screens" readily accessible to adults who produce

age verification. The Court recognizes that we should" `proceed . . . with care before invalidating the Act,' " while
pointing out that the "imperative of according respect tothe Congress . . . does not permit us to depart from wellestablished First Amendment principles." Ante, at 660. Iagree with these generalities. Like the Court, I would
subject the Act to "the most exacting scrutiny," Turner
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 642 (1994),requiring the Government to show that any restriction of

nonobscene expression is "narrowly drawn" to further a"compelling interest" and that the restriction amounts to the
"least restrictive means" available to further that interest,Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115,
126 (1989). See also Denver Area Ed. TelecommunicationsConsortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U. S. 727, 755-756 (1996).

Nonetheless, my examination of (1) the burdens the Actimposes on protected expression, (2) the Act's ability to further a compelling interest, and (3) the proposed "less restric-tive alternatives" convinces me that the Court is wrong. I
cannot accept its conclusion that Congress could have accom-plished its statutory objective--protecting children from
commercial pornography on the Internet--in other, less re-strictive ways.

I
Although the Court rests its conclusion upon the existenceof less restrictive alternatives, I must first examine the burdens that the Act imposes upon protected speech. That isbecause the term "less restrictive alternative" is a comparative term. An "alternative" is "less restrictive" only if itwill work less First Amendment harm than the statute itself,
while at the same time similarly furthering the "compelling"interest that prompted Congress to enact the statute. Unlike the majority, I do not see how it is possible to makethis comparative determination without examining both the

Breyer, J., dissenting
extent to which the Act regulates protected expression andthe nature of the burdens it imposes on that expression.

That examination suggests that the Act, properly inter-preted, imposes a burden on protected speech that is no more
than modest. A

The Act's definitions limit the material it regulates to ma-terial that does not enjoy First Amendment protection,
namely, legally obscene material, and very little more. Acomparison of this Court's definition of unprotected, "legally
obscene," material with the Act's definitions makes this clear.Material is legally obscene if

"(a) . . . `the average person, applying contemporarycommunity standards' would find that the work, taken
as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest . . . ; (b) . . .the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive
way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicablestate law; and (c) . . . the work, taken as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value."
Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, 24 (1973).

The present statute defines the material that it regulates asmaterial that meets all of the following criteria:

"(A) the average person, applying contemporary com-munity standards, would find, taking the material as a
whole and with respect to minors, [that the material] isdesigned to appeal to, or is designed to pander to, the
prurient interest;
"(B) [the material] depicts, describes, or represents, ina manner patently offensive with respect to minors, an

actual or simulated sexual act or sexual contact, an ac-tual or simulated normal or perverted sexual act, or a
lewd exhibition of the genitals or post-pubescent femalebreast; and
"(C) [the material] taken as a whole, lacks serious liter-ary, artistic, political, or scientific value

for minors." 47U. S. C. $ 231(e)(6) (emphasis added).

Breyer, J., dissenting
Both definitions define the relevant material through useof the critical terms "prurient interest" and "lacks serious

literary, artistic, political, or scientific value." Insofar asmaterial appeals to, or panders to, "the prurient interest," it
simply seeks a sexual response. Insofar as "patently offen-sive" material with "no serious value" simply seeks that response, it does not seek to educate, it does not seek to elucidate views about sex, it is not artistic, and it is not literary.Compare,

e. g., Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205, 213
(1975) (invalidating an ordinance regulating nudity in films,where the ban was not confined to "sexually explicit nudity"

or otherwise limited), with Ginzburg v. United States, 383U. S. 463, 471 (1966) (finding unprotected material that was
"created, represented and sold solely as a claimed instrumentof the sexual stimulation it would bring"). That is why this
Court, in Miller, held that the First Amendment did not pro-tect material that fit its definition.

The only significant difference between the present statuteand

Miller's definition consists of the addition of the words
"with respect to minors," $ 231(e)(6)(A), and "for minors,"

$ 231(e)(6)(C). But the addition of these words to a defini-tion that would otherwise cover only obscenity expands the

statute's scope only slightly. That is because the material
in question (while potentially harmful to young children)
must, first, appeal to the "prurient interest" of, i. e., seek a
sexual response from, some group of adolescents or postadolescents (since young children normally do not so respond).
And material that appeals to the "prurient interest[s]" of
some group of adolescents or postadolescents will almost inevitably appeal to the "prurient interest[s]" of some group of
adults as well.

The "lack of serious value" requirement narrows the statute yet further--despite the presence of the qualification
"for minors." That is because one cannot easily imagine material that has serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific
value for a significant group of adults, but lacks such value
for any significant group of minors. Thus, the statute, read

Breyer, J., dissenting
literally, insofar as it extends beyond the legally obscene,could reach only borderline cases. And to take the words

of the statute literally is consistent with Congress' avowedobjective in enacting this law; namely, putting material
produced by professional pornographers behind screens thatwill verify the age of the viewer. See S. Rep. No. 105-225,
p. 3 (1998) (hereinafter S. Rep.) ("The bill seeks to restrict
access to commercial pornography on the Web by requiringthose engaged in the business of the commercial distribution of material that is harmful to minors to take certainprescribed steps to restrict access to such material by
minors . . ."); H. R. Rep. No. 105-775, pp. 5, 14 (1998) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.) (explaining that the bill is aimed at the
sale of pornographic materials and provides a defense for the
"commercial purveyors of pornography" that the bill seeks
to regulate).

These limitations on the statute's scope answer many of
the concerns raised by those who attack its constitutionality.
Respondents fear prosecution for the Internet posting of material that does not fall within the statute's ambit as limited
by the "prurient interest" and "no serious value" requirements; for example: an essay about a young man's experience
with masturbation and sexual shame; "a serious discussion
about birth control practices, homosexuality, . . . or the consequences of prison rape"; an account by a 15-year-old, written
for therapeutic purposes, of being raped when she was 13;
a guide to self-examination for testicular cancer; a graphic
illustration of how to use a condom; or any of the other postings of modern literary or artistic works or discussions of
sexual identity, homosexuality, sexually transmitted diseases, sex education, or safe sex, let alone Aldous Huxley's

I have found nothing elsewhere in the statute's language
that broadens its scope. Other qualifying phrases, such as
"taking the material as a whole," $$ 231(e)(6)(A), (C), and "for
commercial purposes," $ 231(a)(1), limit the statute's scope
still more, requiring, for example, that individual images be
considered in context. See Roth v. United States, 354 U. S.
476, 490 (1957). In sum, the Act's definitions limit the statute's scope to commercial pornography. It affects unprotected obscene material. Given the inevitable uncertainty
about how to characterize close-to-obscene material, it could
apply to (or chill the production of) a limited class of border542US2 Unit: $U79 [10-30-06 07:07:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

line material that courts might ultimately find is protected.But the examples I have just given fall outside that class.

B
The Act does not censor the material it covers. Rather,it requires providers of the "harmful to minors" material to

restrict minors' access to it by verifying age. They can doso by inserting screens that verify age using a credit card,
adult personal identification number, or other similar tech-nology. See $ 231(c)(1). In this way, the Act requires creation of an Internet screen that minors, but not adults, willfind difficult to bypass.

I recognize that the screening requirement imposes someburden on adults who seek access to the regulated material,
as well as on its providers. The cost is, in part, monetary.The parties agreed that a Web site could store card numbers
or passwords at between 15 and 20 cents per number.
American Civil Liberties Union v. Reno, 31 F. Supp. 2d 473,488-489, |||| 45-47 (ED Pa. 1999). And verification services

provide free verification to Web site operators, while charg-ing users less than $20 per year. Id., at 489-490, |||| 48-53.
According to the trade association for the commercial por-nographers who are the statute's target, use of such verification procedures is "standard practice" in their online oper-ations. See S. Rep., at 7; Legislative Proposals to Protect
Children from Inappropriate Materials on the Internet:Hearing on H. R. 3783 et al. before the House Subcommittee

the proposed child-protecting mechanisms "effective andappropriate")).

ments inherent in age screening may lead some users to fearembarrassment. See 31 F. Supp. 2d, at 495. Both monetary costs and potential embarrassment can deter potentialviewers and, in that sense, the statute's requirements may
restrict access to a site. But this Court has held that in thecontext of congressional efforts to protect children, restrictions of this kind do not automatically violate the Constitu-tion. And the Court has approved their use. See,

e. g.,United States v. American Library Assn., Inc., 539 U. S. 194,

209 (2003) (plurality opinion) ("[T]he Constitution does notguarantee the right to acquire information at a public library
without any risk of embarrassment"). Cf. Reno, 521 U. S.,at 890 (O'C

onnor, J., concurring in judgment in part anddissenting in part) (calling the age-verification requirement

similar to "a bouncer [who] checks a person's driver's licensebefore admitting him to a nightclub").

In sum, the Act at most imposes a modest additionalburden on adult access to legally obscene material, perhaps
imposing a similar burden on access to some protectedborderline obscene material as well.

I turn next to the question of "compelling interest," thatof protecting minors from exposure to commercial pornography. No one denies that such an interest is "compelling."See Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium,
Inc., 518 U. S., at 743 (opinion of Breyer, J.) (interest inprotecting minors is "compelling"); Sable Communications,
492 U. S., at 126 (same); Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629,639-640 (1968). Rather, the question here is whether the
Act, given its restrictions on adult access, significantly ad-vances that interest. In other words, is the game worth
the candle?The majority argues that it is not, because of the existence
of "blocking and filtering software." Ante, at 666-670.The majority refers to the presence of that software as a

Breyer, J., dissenting
"less restrictive alternative." But that is a misnomer--amisnomer that may lead the reader to believe that all we

need do is look to see if the blocking and filtering softwareis less restrictive; and to believe that, because in one sense
it is (one can turn off the software), that is the end of theconstitutional matter.

But such reasoning has no place here. Conceptually
speaking, the presence of filtering software is not an alternative legislative approach to the problem of protecting children from exposure to commercial pornography. Rather, itis part of the status quo,

i. e., the backdrop against which
Congress enacted the present statute. It is always true, by
definition, that the status quo is less restrictive than a new
regulatory law. It is always less restrictive to do nothing
than to do something. But "doing nothing" does not address the problem Congress sought to address--namely, that,
despite the availability of filtering software, children were
still being exposed to harmful material on the Internet.

Thus, the relevant constitutional question is not the question the Court asks: Would it be less restrictive to do nothing? Of course it would be. Rather, the relevant question
posits a comparison of (a) a status quo that includes filtering
software with (b) a change in that status quo that adds to it
an age-verification screen requirement. Given the existence
of filtering software, does the problem Congress identified
remain significant? Does the Act help to address it? These
are questions about the relation of the Act to the compelling
interest. Does the Act, compared to the status quo, significantly advance the ball? (An affirmative answer to these
questions will not justify "[a]ny restriction on speech," as the
Court claims, ante, at 666, for a final answer in respect to
constitutionality must take account of burdens and alternatives as well.)

The answers to these intermediate questions are clear: Filtering software, as presently available, does not solve the
"child protection" problem. It suffers from four serious in542US2 Unit: $U79 [10-30-06 07:07:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
adequacies that prompted Congress to pass legislation in-stead of relying on its voluntary use. First, its filtering is

faulty, allowing some pornographic material to pass throughwithout hindrance. Just last year, in

American Library
Assn., Justice Stevens described "fundamental defects inthe filtering software that is now available or that will be

available in the foreseeable future." 539 U. S., at 221 (dissenting opinion). He pointed to the problem of under-blocking: "Because the software relies on key words or

phrases to block undesirable sites, it does not have the capac-ity to exclude a precisely defined category of images."

Ibid.
That is to say, in the absence of words, the software alone
cannot distinguish between the most obscene pictorial image
and the Venus de Milo. No Member of this Court disagreed.

Second, filtering software costs money. Not every family
has the $40 or so necessary to install it. See 31 F. Supp. 2d,
at 492, || 65. By way of contrast, age screening costs less.
See supra, at 682 (citing costs of up to 20 cents per password
or $20 per user for an identification number).

Third, filtering software depends upon parents willing to
decide where their children will surf the Web and able to
enforce that decision. As to millions of American families,
that is not a reasonable possibility. More than 28 million
school age children have both parents or their sole parent in
the work force, at least 5 million children are left alone at
home without supervision each week, and many of those children will spend afternoons and evenings with friends who
may well have access to computers and more lenient parents.
See United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc.,
529 U. S. 803, 842 (2000) (Breyer, J., dissenting).

Fourth, software blocking lacks precision, with the result
that those who wish to use it to screen out pornography find
that it blocks a great deal of material that is valuable. As
Justice Stevens pointed out, "the software's reliance on
words to identify undesirable sites necessarily results in the
blocking of thousands of pages that contain content that is

completely innocuous for both adults and minors, and that no
rational person could conclude matches the filtering companies' category definitions, such as pornography or sex."
American Library Assn., supra, at 222 (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU), one of the respondents here, told Congress
that filtering software "block[s] out valuable and protected
information, such as information about the Quaker religion,
and web sites including those of the American Association of
University Women, the AIDS Quilt, the Town Hall Political
Site (run by the Family Resource Center, Christian Coalition
and other conservative groups)." Hearing on Internet Indecency before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science,
and Transportation, 105th Cong., 2d Sess., 64 (1998). The
software "is simply incapable of discerning between constitutionally protected and unprotected speech." Id., at 65. It
"inappropriately blocks valuable, protected speech, and does
not effectively block the sites [it is] intended to block." Id.,
at 66 (citing reports documenting overblocking).

Nothing in the District Court record suggests the contrary. No respondent has offered to produce evidence at
trial to the contrary. No party has suggested, for example,
that technology allowing filters to interpret and discern
among images has suddenly become, or is about to become,
widely available. Indeed, the Court concedes that "[f]iltering software, of course, is not a perfect solution to the problem." Ante, at 668.

In sum, a "filtering software status quo" means filtering
that underblocks, imposes a cost upon each family that uses
it, fails to screen outside the home, and lacks precision.
Thus, Congress could reasonably conclude that a system that
relies entirely upon the use of such software is not an effective system. And a law that adds to that system an ageverification screen requirement significantly increases the
system's efficacy. That is to say, at a modest additional cost

542US2 Unit: $U79 [10-30-06 07:07:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

687Cite as: 542 U. S. 656 (2004)
Breyer, J., dissenting
to those adults who wish to obtain access to a screened program, that law will bring about better, more precise blocking, both inside and outside the home.

The Court's response--that 40% of all pornographic material may be of foreign origin--is beside the point. Ante, at
667 (citing the District Court's findings). Even assuming (I
believe unrealistically) that all foreign originators will refuse to use screening, the Act would make a difference in
respect to 60% of the Internet's commercial pornography. I
cannot call that difference insignificant.

The upshot is that Congress could reasonably conclude
that, despite the current availability of filtering software, a
child protection problem exists. It also could conclude that
a precisely targeted regulatory statute, adding an ageverification requirement for a narrow range of material,
would more effectively shield children from commercial
pornography.

Is this justification sufficient? The lower courts thought
not. But that is because those courts interpreted the Act
as imposing far more than a modest burden. They assumed
an interpretation of the statute in which it reached far beyond legally obscene and borderline obscene material, affecting material that, given the interpretation set forth above,
would fall well outside the Act's scope. But we must interpret the Act to save it, not to destroy it. NLRB v. Jones &
Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1, 30 (1937). So interpreted,
see supra, at 678-682, the Act imposes a far lesser burden
on access to protected material. Given the modest nature of
that burden and the likelihood that the Act will significantly
further Congress' compelling objective, the Act may well satisfy the First Amendment's stringent tests. Cf. Sable Communications, 492 U. S., at 130. Indeed, it does satisfy the
First Amendment unless, of course, there is a genuine alternative, "less restrictive" way similarly to further that
objective.

III
I turn, then, to the actual "less restrictive alternatives"that the Court proposes. The Court proposes two real alternatives, i. e., two potentially less restrictive ways inwhich Congress might alter the status quo in order to
achieve its "compelling" objective.First, the Government might "act to encourage" the use of
blocking and filtering software. Ante, at 669. The problemis that any argument that rests upon this alternative proves
too much. If one imagines enough Government resourcesdevoted to the problem and perhaps additional scientific advances, then, of course, the use of software might becomeas effective and less restrictive. Obviously, the Government
could give all parents, schools, and Internet cafes free com-puters with filtering programs already installed, hire federal employees to train parents and teachers on their use,and devote millions of dollars to the development of better
software. The result might be an alternative that is ex-tremely effective.

But the Constitution does not, because it cannot, requirethe Government to disprove the existence of magic solutions,
i. e., solutions that, put in general terms, will solve any prob-lem less restrictively but with equal effectiveness. Otherwise, "the undoubted ability of lawyers and judges," who arenot constrained by the budgetary worries and other practical
parameters within which Congress must operate, "to imag-ine

some kind of slightly less drastic or restrictive an ap-proach would make it impossible to write laws that deal with

the harm that called the statute into being." Playboy En-tertainment Group, 529 U. S., at 841 (B

reyer, J., dissenting).As Justice Blackmun recognized, a "judge would be unimaginative indeed if he could not come up with something a littleless `drastic' or a little less `restrictive' in almost any situation, and thereby enable himself to vote to strike legisla-tion down."

Illinois Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers
Party, 440 U. S. 173, 188-189 (1979) (concurring opinion).

Breyer, J., dissenting
Perhaps that is why no party has argued seriously that addi-tional expenditure of government funds to encourage the use

of screening is a "less restrictive alternative."Second, the majority suggests decriminalizing the statute,
noting the "chilling effect" of criminalizing a category ofspeech. Ante, at 667. To remove a major sanction, however,
would make the statute less effective, virtually by definition.

IV
My conclusion is that the Act, as properly interpreted,risks imposition of minor burdens on some protected material--burdens that adults wishing to view the material mayovercome at modest cost. At the same time, it significantly
helps to achieve a compelling congressional goal, protectingchildren from exposure to commercial pornography. There
is no serious, practically available "less restrictive" way sim-ilarly to further this compelling interest. Hence the Act is
constitutional. V

The Court's holding raises two more general questions.First, what has happened to the "constructive discourse between our courts and our legislatures" that "is an integraland admirable part of the constitutional design"? Blakely
v. Washington, ante, at 326 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).After eight years of legislative effort, two statutes, and three
Supreme Court cases the Court sends this case back to theDistrict Court for further proceedings. What proceedings?
I have found no offer by either party to present more rele-vant evidence. What remains to be litigated? I know the
Court says that the parties may "introduce further evidence"as to the "relative restrictiveness and effectiveness of alternatives to the statute." Ante, at 673. But I do not under-stand what that new evidence might consist of.

Moreover, Congress passed the current statute "[i]n re-sponse to the Court's decision in

Reno" striking down anearlier statutory effort to deal with the same problem.

542US2 Unit: $U79 [10-30-06 07:07:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN
690 ASHCROFT v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION

Breyer, J., dissenting
Ante, at 661. Congress read Reno with care. It dedicated
itself to the task of drafting a statute that would meet each
and every criticism of the predecessor statute that this Court
set forth in Reno. It incorporated language from the
Court's precedents, particularly the Miller standard, virtually verbatim. Compare 413 U. S., at 24, with $ 231(e)(6).
And it created what it believed was a statute that would
protect children from exposure to obscene professional pornography without obstructing adult access to material that
the First Amendment protects. See H. R. Rep., at 5 (explaining that the bill was "carefully drafted to respond to the
Supreme Court's decision in Reno"); S. Rep., at 2 (same).
What else was Congress supposed to do?

I recognize that some Members of the Court, now or in
the past, have taken the view that the First Amendment
simply does not permit Congress to legislate in this area.
See, e. g., Ginzburg, 383 U. S., at 476 (Black, J., dissenting)
("[T]he Federal Government is without any power whatever
under the Constitution to put any type of burden on speech
and expression of ideas of any kind"). Others believe that
the Amendment does not permit Congress to legislate in certain ways, e. g., through the imposition of criminal penalties
for obscenity. See, e. g., ante, at 674-675 (Stevens, J., concurring). There are strong constitutional arguments favoring these views. But the Court itself does not adopt those
views. Instead, it finds that the Government has not proved
the nonexistence of "less restrictive alternatives." That
finding, if appropriate here, is universally appropriate. And
if universally appropriate, it denies to Congress, in practice,
the legislative leeway that the Court's language seems to
promise. If this statute does not pass the Court's "less restrictive alternative" test, what does? If nothing does, then
the Court should say so clearly.

As I have explained, I believe the First Amendment permits an alternative holding. We could construe the statute

542US2 Unit: $U79 [10-30-06 07:07:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

narrowly--as I have tried to do--removing nearly all pro-tected material from its scope. By doing so, we could reconcile its language with the First Amendment's demands. Wewould "save" the statute, "not . . . destroy" it.

NLRB,
301 U. S., at 30. Accord, McConnell v. Federal Election
Comm'n, 540 U. S. 93, 180 (2003) (where a saving construction of the statute's language " `is fairly possible,' " we must
adopt it (quoting Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 62 (1932))).And in the process, we would permit Congress to achieve its

basic child-protecting objectives.Second, w ill the majority's holding in practice mean
greater or lesser protection for expression? I do not find
the answer to this question obvious. The Court's decision
removes an important weapon from the prosecutorial arsenal. That weapon would have given the Government a
choice--a choice other than "ban totally or do nothing at all."
The Act tells the Government that, instead of prosecuting
bans on obscenity to the maximum extent possible (as respondents have urged as yet another "alternative"), it can
insist that those who make available material that is obscene
or close to obscene keep that material under wraps, making it readily available to adults who wish to see it, while
restricting access to children. By providing this third
option--a "middle way"--the Act avoids the need for potentially speech-suppressing prosecutions.

That matters in a world where the obscene and the nonobscene do not come tied neatly into separate, easily distinguishable, packages. In that real world, this middle way
might well have furthered First Amendment interests by
tempering the prosecutorial instinct in borderline cases. At
least, Congress might have so believed. And this likelihood,
from a First Amendment perspective, might ultimately have
proved more protective of the rights of viewers to retain
access to expression than the all-or-nothing choice available
to prosecutors in the wake of the majority's opinion.

For these reasons, I dissent.

SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAIN et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 03-339. Argued March 30, 2004--Decided June 29, 2004*
The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) approved using petitioner

Sosa and other Mexican nationals to abduct respondent AlvarezMachain (Alvarez), also a Mexican national, from Mexico to stand trial
in the United States for a DEA agent's torture and murder. As relevant here, after his acquittal, Alvarez sued the United States for false
arrest under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), which waives sovereign immunity in suits "for . . . personal injury . . . caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any [Government] employee while
acting within the scope of his office or employment," 28 U. S. C.

$ 1346(b)(1); and sued Sosa for violating the law of nations under the
Alien Tort Statute (ATS), a 1789 law giving district courts "original
jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in
violation of the law of nations . . . ," $ 1350. The District Court dismissed the FTCA claim, but awarded Alvarez summary judgment and
damages on the ATS claim. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the ATS judgment, but reversed the FTCA claim's dismissal.

Held:

1. The FTCA's exception to waiver of sovereign immunity for claims
"arising in a foreign country," 28 U. S. C. $ 2680(k), bars claims based on
any injury suffered in a foreign country, regardless of where the tortious
act or omission occurred. Pp. 699-712.

(a) The exception on its face seems plainly applicable to the facts
of this action. Alvarez's arrest was said to be "false," and thus tortious,
only because, and only to the extent that, it took place and endured in
Mexico. Nonetheless, the Ninth Circuit allowed the action to proceed
under what is known as the "headquarters doctrine," concluding that,
because Alvarez's abduction was the direct result of wrongful planning
and direction by DEA agents in California, his claim did not "aris[e] in"
a foreign country. Because it will virtually always be possible to assert
negligent activity occurring in the United States, such analysis must
be viewed with skepticism. Two considerations confirm this Court's
skepticism and lead it to reject the headquarters doctrine. Pp. 700-703.

*Together with No. 03-485, United States v. Alvarez-Machain et al.,
also on certiorari to the same court.

Syllabus
(b) The first consideration applies to cases like this one, where
harm was arguably caused both by action in the foreign country and
planning in the United States. Proximate cause is necessary to connect
the domestic breach of duty with the action in the foreign country, for
the headquarters' behavior must be sufficiently close to the ultimate
injury, and sufficiently important in producing it, to make it reasonable
to follow liability back to that behavior. A proximate cause connection
is not itself sufficient to bar the foreign country exception's application,
since a given proximate cause may not be the harm's exclusive proximate cause. Here, for example, assuming the DEA officials' direction
was a proximate cause of the abduction, so were the actions of Sosa
and others in Mexico. Thus, at most, recognition of additional domestic
causation leaves an open question whether the exception applies to Alvarez's claim. Pp. 703-704.

(c) The second consideration is rooted in the fact that the harm
occurred on foreign soil. There is good reason to think that Congress
understood a claim "arising in" a foreign country to be a claim for injury
or harm occurring in that country. This was the common usage of "arising under" in contemporary state borrowing statutes used to determine
which State's limitations statute applied in cases with transjurisdictional facts. And such language was interpreted in tort cases in just
the same way that the Court reads the FTCA today. Moreover, there
is specific reason to believe that using "arising in" to refer to place of
harm was central to the foreign country exception's object. When the
FTCA was passed, courts generally applied the law of the place where
the injury occurred in tort cases, which would have been foreign law for
a plaintiff injured in a foreign country. However, application of foreign
substantive law was what Congress intended to avoid by the foreign
country exception. Applying the headquarters doctrine would thus
have thwarted the exception's object by recasting foreign injury claims
as claims not arising in a foreign country because of some domestic
planning or negligence. Nor has the headquarters doctrine outgrown
its tension with the exception. The traditional approach to choice of
substantive tort law has lost favor, but many States still use that analysis. And, in at least some cases the Ninth Circuit's approach would
treat as arising at headquarters, even the later methodologies of choice
point to the application of foreign law. There is also no merit to an
argument that the headquarters doctrine should be permitted when a
State's choice-of-law approach would not apply the foreign law of the
place of injury. Congress did not write the exception to apply when
foreign law would be applied. Rather, the exception was written at
a time when "arising in" meant where the harm occurred; and the

odds are that Congress meant simply that when it used the phrase.
Pp. 704-712.

2. Alvarez is not entitled to recover damages from Sosa under the
ATS. Pp. 712-738.

(a) The limited, implicit sanction to entertain the handful of international law cum common law claims understood in 1789 is not authority
to recognize the ATS right of action Alvarez asserts here. Contrary to
Alvarez's claim, the ATS is a jurisdictional statute creating no new
causes of action. This does not mean, as Sosa contends, that the ATS
was stillborn because any claim for relief required a further statute
expressly authorizing adoption of causes of action. Rather, the reasonable inference from history and practice is that the ATS was intended
to have practical effect the moment it became law, on the understanding
that the common law would provide a cause of action for the modest
number of international law violations thought to carry personal liability
at the time: offenses against ambassadors, violation of safe conducts, and
piracy. Sosa's objections to this view are unpersuasive. Pp. 712-724.

(b) While it is correct to assume that the First Congress understood that district courts would recognize private causes of action for
certain torts in violation of the law of nations and that no development
of law in the last two centuries has categorically precluded federal
courts from recognizing a claim under the law of nations as an element
of common law, there are good reasons for a restrained conception of
the discretion a federal court should exercise in considering such a new
cause of action. In deriving a standard for assessing Alvarez's particular claim, it suffices to look to the historical antecedents, which persuade
this Court that federal courts should not recognize claims under federal
common law for violations of any international law norm with less definite content and acceptance among civilized nations than the 18thcentury paradigms familiar when $ 1350 was enacted. Pp. 724-738.

(i) Several reasons argue for great caution in adapting the law of
nations to private rights. First, the prevailing conception of the common law has changed since 1790. When $ 1350 was enacted, the accepted conception was that the common law was found or discovered,
but now it is understood, in most cases where a court is asked to state or
formulate a common law principle in a new context, as made or created.
Hence, a judge deciding in reliance on an international norm will find a
substantial element of discretionary judgment in the decision. Second,
along with, and in part driven by, this conceptual development has come
an equally significant rethinking of the federal courts' role in making
common law. In Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, 78, this Court
denied the existence of any federal "general" common law, which largely
withdrew to havens of specialty, with the general practice being to look

Syllabus
for legislative guidance before exercising innovative authority over substantive law. Third, a decision to create a private right of action is
better left to legislative judgment in most cases. E. g., Correctional
Services Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U. S. 61, 68. Fourth, the potential implications for the foreign relations of the United States of recognizing private causes of action for violating international law should make courts
particularly wary of impinging on the discretion of the Legislative and
Executive Branches in managing foreign affairs. Fifth, this Court has
no congressional mandate to seek out and define new and debatable
violations of the law of nations, and modern indications of congressional
understanding of the judicial role in the field have not affirmatively encouraged greater judicial creativity. Pp. 725-731.

(ii) The limit on judicial recognition adopted here is fatal to Alvarez's claim. Alvarez contends that prohibition of arbitrary arrest has
attained the status of binding customary international law and that his
arrest was arbitrary because no applicable law authorized it. He thus
invokes a general prohibition of arbitrary detention defined as officially
sanctioned action exceeding positive authorization to detain under the
domestic law of some government. However, he cites little authority
that a rule so broad has the status of a binding customary norm today.
He certainly cites nothing to justify the federal courts in taking his
rule as the predicate for a federal lawsuit, for its implications would be
breathtaking. It would create a cause of action for any seizure of an
alien in violation of the Fourth Amendment, supplanting the actions
under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 and Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics
Agents, 403 U. S. 388, that now provide damages for such violations.
And it would create a federal action for arrests by state officers who
simply exceed their authority under state law. Alvarez's failure to marshal support for his rule is underscored by the Restatement (Third) of
Foreign Relations Law of the United States, which refers to prolonged
arbitrary detention, not relatively brief detention in excess of positive
authority. Whatever may be said for his broad principle, it expresses
an aspiration exceeding any binding customary rule with the specificity
this Court requires. Pp. 731-738.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
The two issues are whether respondent Alvarez-Machain'sallegation that the Drug Enforcement Administration instigated his abduction from Mexico for criminal trial in theUnited States supports a claim against the Government
under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA or Act), 28U. S. C. $$ 1346(b)(1), 2671-2680, and whether he may recover
under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), 28 U. S. C. $ 1350. Wehold that he is not entitled to a remedy under either statute.

I
We have considered the underlying facts before, UnitedStates v. Alvarez-Machain, 504 U. S. 655 (1992). In 1985,

an agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA),Enrique Camarena-Salazar, was captured on assignment in
Mexico and taken to a house in Guadalajara, where he wastortured over the course of a 2-day interrogation, then murdered. Based in part on eyewitness testimony, DEA offi-cials in the United States came to believe that respondent
Humberto Alvarez-Machain (Alvarez), a Mexican physician,was present at the house and acted to prolong the agent's
life in order to extend the interrogation and torture. Id.,at 657.

In 1990, a federal grand jury indicted Alvarez for the tor-ture and murder of Camarena-Salazar, and the United States
District Court for the Central District of California issued a
Bill Lann Lee, Stanley M. Chesley, Paul De Marco, Burt Neuborne, and
Michael D. Hausfeld; for Wendy A. Adams et al. by William J. Aceves
and David S. Weissbrodt; and for Mary Robinson et al. by Harold Hongju
Koh, John M. Townsend, and William R. Stein.

Opinion of the Court
warrant for his arrest. 331 F. 3d 604, 609 (CA9 2003) (en
banc). The DEA asked the Mexican Government for help
in getting Alvarez into the United States, but when the requests and negotiations proved fruitless, the DEA approved
a plan to hire Mexican nationals to seize Alvarez and bring
him to the United States for trial. As so planned, a group of
Mexicans, including petitioner Jose Francisco Sosa, abducted
Alvarez from his house, held him overnight in a motel, and
brought him by private plane to El Paso, Texas, where he
was arrested by federal officers. Ibid.

Once in American custody, Alvarez moved to dismiss the
indictment on the ground that his seizure was "outrageous
governmental conduct," Alvarez-Machain, 504 U. S., at 658,
and violated the extradition treaty between the United
States and Mexico. The District Court agreed, the Ninth
Circuit affirmed, and we reversed, id., at 670, holding that
the fact of Alvarez's forcible seizure did not affect the jurisdiction of a federal court. The case was tried in 1992, and
ended at the close of the Government's case, when the District Court granted Alvarez's motion for a judgment of
acquittal.

In 1993, after returning to Mexico, Alvarez began the civil
action before us here. He sued Sosa, Mexican citizen and
DEA operative Antonio Garate-Bustamante, five unnamed
Mexican civilians, the United States, and four DEA agents.
331 F. 3d, at 610. So far as it matters here, Alvarez sought
damages from the United States under the FTCA, alleging
false arrest, and from Sosa under the ATS, for a violation of
the law of nations. The former statute authorizes suit
"for . . . personal injury . . . caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while
acting within the scope of his office or employment." 28
U. S. C. $ 1346(b)(1). The latter provides in its entirety that
"[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any
civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation

Opinion of the Court
of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States."$ 1350.

The District Court granted the Government's motion todismiss the FTCA claim, but awarded summary judgment
and $25,000 in damages to Alvarez on the ATS claim. Athree-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit then affirmed the ATS
judgment, but reversed the dismissal of the FTCA claim.266 F. 3d 1045 (2001).

A divided en banc court came to the same conclusion. 331F. 3d, at 641. As for the ATS claim, the court called on its
own precedent, "that [the ATS] not only provides federalcourts with subject matter jurisdiction, but also creates a
cause of action for an alleged violation of the law of nations."
Id., at 612. The Circuit then relied upon what it called the"clear and universally recognized norm prohibiting arbitrary

arrest and detention," id., at 620, to support the conclusionthat Alvarez's arrest amounted to a tort in violation of international law. On the FTCA claim, the Ninth Circuit heldthat, because "the DEA had no authority to effect Alvarez's
arrest and detention in Mexico," id., at 608, the UnitedStates was liable to him under California law for the tort of
false arrest, id., at 640-641.We granted certiorari in these companion cases to clarify
the scope of both the FTCA and the ATS. 540 U. S. 1045(2003). We now reverse in each.

II
The Government seeks reversal of the judgment of liabil-ity under the FTCA on two principal grounds. It argues

that the arrest could not have been tortious, because it wasauthorized by 21 U. S. C. $ 878, setting out the arrest authority of the DEA, and it says that in any event the liabilityasserted here falls within the FTCA exception to waiver of
sovereign immunity for claims "arising in a foreign country,"28 U. S. C. $ 2680(k). We think the exception applies and decide on that ground.

700 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAIN

Opinion of the Court

A
The FTCA "was designed primarily to remove the sover-eign immunity of the United States from suits in tort and,

with certain specific exceptions, to render the Governmentliable in tort as a private individual would be under like circumstances." Richards v. United States, 369 U. S. 1, 6(1962); see also 28 U. S. C. $ 2674. The Act accordingly gives
federal district courts jurisdiction over claims against theUnited States for injury "caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government whileacting within the scope of his office or employment, under
circumstances where the United States, if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of
the place where the act or omission occurred." $ 1346(b)(1).But the Act also limits its waiver of sovereign immunity in
a number of ways. See $ 2680 (no waiver as to, e. g., "[a]nyclaim arising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter," "[a]ny claim for damagescaused by the imposition or establishment of a quarantine by
the United States," or "[a]ny claim arising from the activitiesof the Panama Canal Company").

Here the significant limitation on the waiver of immunityis the Act's exception for "[a]ny claim arising in a foreign
country," $ 2680(k), a provision that on its face seems plainlyapplicable to the facts of this action. In the Ninth Circuit's
view, once Alvarez was within the borders of the UnitedStates, his detention was not tortious, see 331 F. 3d, at 636-
637; the appellate court suggested that the Government's lia-bility to Alvarez rested solely upon a false arrest claim.

Id.,at 640-641. Alvarez's arrest, however, was said to be

"false," and thus tortious, only because, and only to the ex-tent that, it took place and endured in Mexico.

1 The actions

1 In the Ninth Circuit's view, it was critical that "DEA agents had no
authority under federal law to execute an extraterritorial arrest of a suspect indicted in federal court in Los Angeles." 331 F. 3d, at 640. Once
Alvarez arrived in the United States, "the actions of domestic law enforce542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
in Mexico are thus most naturally understood as the kernelof a "claim arising in a foreign country," and barred from suit

under the exception to the waiver of immunity.Notwithstanding the straightforward language of the foreign country exception, the Ninth Circuit allowed the actionto proceed under what has come to be known as the "headquarters doctrine." Some Courts of Appeals, reasoning that"[t]he entire scheme of the FTCA focuses on the place where
the negligent or wrongful act or omission of the governmentemployee occurred,"

Sami v. United States, 617 F. 2d 755,761 (CADC 1979), have concluded that the foreign country

exception does not exempt the United States from suit "foracts or omissions occurring here which have their operative
effect in another country," id., at 762 (refusing to apply$ 2680(k) where a communique sent from the United States
by a federal law enforcement officer resulted in plaintiff 'swrongful detention in Germany).

2 Headquarters claims

"typically involve allegations of negligent guidance in an of-fice within the United States of employees who cause damage while in a foreign country, or of activities which takeplace within a foreign country."

Cominotto v. UnitedStates, 802 F. 2d 1127, 1130 (CA9 1986). In such instances,

these courts have concluded that $ 2680(k) does not bar suit.

of the procedural requisites of federal due process." Id., at 637.

702 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAIN

Opinion of the Court
The reasoning of the Ninth Circuit here was that, sinceAlvarez's abduction in Mexico was the direct result of wrongful acts of planning and direction by DEA agents located inCalifornia, "Alvarez's abduction fits the headquarters doctrine like a glove." 331 F. 3d, at 638.

"Working out of DEA offices in Los Angeles, [DEA
agents] made the decision to kidnap Alvarez and . . .gave [their Mexican intermediary] precise instructions

on whom to recruit, how to seize Alvarez, and how heshould be treated during the trip to the United States.
DEA officials in Washington, D. C., approved the detailsof the operation. After Alvarez was abducted according to plan, DEA agents supervised his transportation
into the United States, telling the arrest team where toland the plane and obtaining clearance in El Paso for

landing. The United States, and California in particu-lar, served as command central for the operation carried
out in Mexico." Id., at 638-639.
Thus, the Ninth Circuit held that Alvarez's claim did not"aris[e] in" a foreign country.

The potential effect of this sort of headquarters analysis
flashes the yellow caution light. "[I]t will virtually alwaysbe possible to assert that the negligent activity that injured

the plaintiff [abroad] was the consequence of faulty training,selection or supervision--or even less than that, lack of careful training, selection or supervision--in the United States."
Beattie v. United States, 756 F. 2d 91, 119 (CADC 1984)

United States, 817 F. Supp. 680, 691-693 (SD Ohio 1993), allegations of negligent medical care, Newborn v. United States,
238 F. Supp. 2d 145, 148-149 (DC 2002), and even slip-and-fall
cases, Eaglin v. United States, Dept. of Army, 794 F. 2d 981,
983-984 (CA5 1986), can all be repackaged as headquarters
claims based on a failure to train, a failure to warn, the offering of bad advice, or the adoption of a negligent policy. If

Opinion of the Court
we were to approve the headquarters exception to the for-eign country exception, the " `headquarters claim' [would]

become a standard part of FTCA litigation" in cases poten-tially implicating the foreign country exception. Beattie,
supra, at 119 (Scalia, J., dissenting). The headquarters doc-trine threatens to swallow the foreign country exception
whole, certainly at the pleadings stage.The need for skepticism is borne out by two considerations. One of them is pertinent to cases like this one, whereharm was arguably caused both by individual action in a foreign country as well as by planning in the United States;the other is suggested simply because the harm occurred on
foreign soil. B

Although not every headquarters case is rested on an ex-plicit analysis of proximate causation, this notion of cause is
necessary to connect the domestic breach of duty (at head-quarters) with the action in the foreign country (in a case
like this) producing the foreign harm or injury. It is neces-sary, in other words, to conclude that the act or omission at
home headquarters was sufficiently close to the ultimate in-jury, and sufficiently important in producing it, to make it
reasonable to follow liability back to the headquarters behav-ior. Only in this way could the behavior at headquarters
properly be seen as the act or omission on which all FTCAliability must rest under $ 2675. See, e. g., Cominotto,
supra, at 1130 ("[A] headquarters claim exists where negli-gent acts in the United States proximately cause harm in a
foreign country"); Eaglin, supra, at 983 (noting that head-quarters cases require "a plausible proximate nexus or connection between acts or omissions in the United States andthe resulting damage or injury in a foreign country").

Recognizing this connection of proximate cause betweendomestic behavior and foreign harm or injury is not, however, sufficient of itself to bar application of the foreign coun-try exception to a claim resting on that same foreign conse542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN
704 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAIN

Opinion of the Court
quence. Proximate cause is causation substantial enoughand close enough to the harm to be recognized by law, but a

given proximate cause need not be, and frequently is not, theexclusive proximate cause of harm. See, e. g., 57A Am. Jur.
2d $ 529 (2004) (discussing proper jury instructions in casesinvolving multiple proximate causes); Beattie, supra, at 121
(Scalia, J., dissenting) ("[I]n the ordinary case there may be
several points along the chain of causality" pertinent to theenquiry). Here, for example, assuming that the direction by

DEA officials in California was a proximate cause of the ab-duction, the actions of Sosa and others in Mexico were just
as surely proximate causes, as well. Thus, understandingthat California planning was a legal cause of the harm in no
way eliminates the conclusion that the claim here arose fromharm proximately caused by acts in Mexico. At most, recognition of additional domestic causation under the headquar-ters doctrine leaves an open question whether the exception
applies to the claim. C

Not only does domestic proximate causation under theheadquarters doctrine fail to eliminate application of the foreign country exception, but there is good reason to think thatCongress understood a claim "arising in" a foreign country in
such a way as to bar application of the headquarters doc-trine. There is good reason, that is, to conclude that Congress understood a claim "arising in a foreign country" to bea claim for injury or harm occurring in a foreign country.
28 U. S. C. $ 2680(k). This sense of "arising in" was the com-mon usage in state borrowing statutes contemporary with
the Act, which operated to determine which State's statuteof limitations should apply in cases involving transjurisdictional facts. When the FTCA was passed, the general rule,as set out in various state statutes, was that "a cause of
action arising in another jurisdiction, which is barred by thelaws of that jurisdiction, will [also] be barred in the domestic
courts." 41 A. L. R. 4th 1025, 1029, $ 2 (1985). These bor542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

705Cite as: 542 U. S. 692 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
rowing statutes were typically restricted by express termsto situations where a cause of action was time barred in the

State "where [the] cause of action arose, or accrued, or orig-inated." 75 A. L. R. 203, 211 (1931) (emphasis in original).
Critically for present purposes, these variations on thetheme of "arising in" were interpreted in tort cases in just
the same way that we read the FTCA today. A commenta-tor noted in 1962 that, for the purposes of these borrowing
statutes, "[t]he courts unanimously hold that a cause of actionsounding in tort arises in the jurisdiction where the last act
necessary to establish liability occurred"; i. e., "the jurisdic-tion in which injury was received." Ester, Borrowing Statutes of Limitation and Conflict of Laws, 15 U. Fla. L. Rev.33, 47.

There is, moreover, specific reason to believe that using"arising in" as referring to place of harm was central to the
object of the foreign country exception. Any tort action in acourt of the United States based on the acts of a Government
employee causing harm outside the State of the district courtin which the action is filed requires a determination of the
source of the substantive law that will govern liability.When the FTCA was passed, the dominant principle in
choice-of-law analysis for tort cases was lex loci delicti:courts generally applied the law of the place where the injury occurred. See Richards v. United States, 369 U. S., at11-12 ("The general conflict-of-laws rule, followed by a vast
majority of the States, is to apply the law of the place ofinjury to the substantive rights of the parties" (footnote
omitted)); see also Restatement (First) of Conflict of Laws$ 379 (1934) (defendant's liability determined by "the law of

torts involving bodily harm is "the place where the harmful
force takes effect upon the body" (emphasis in original)); ibid.
(same principle for torts of fraud and torts involving harmto property).

4 For a plaintiff injured in a foreign country,

then, the presumptive choice in American courts underthe traditional rule would have been to apply foreign law to

determine the tortfeasor's liability. See, e. g., Day & Zimmermann, Inc. v. Challoner, 423 U. S. 3 (1975) (per curiam)(noting that Texas would apply Cambodian law to wrongfuldeath action involving explosion in Cambodia of an artilleryround manufactured in United States);

Thomas v. FMC
Corp., 610 F. Supp. 912 (MD Ala. 1985) (applying Germanlaw to determine American manufacturer's liability for

negligently designing and manufacturing a Howitzer thatkilled decedent in Germany);

Quandt v. Beech Aircraft
Corp., 317 F. Supp. 1009 (Del. 1970) (noting that Italian lawapplies to allegations of negligent manufacture in Kansas

that resulted in an airplane crash in Italy); Manos v. Trans
World Airlines, 295 F. Supp. 1170 (ND Ill. 1969) (applying
Italian law to determine American corporation's liability for
negligent manufacture of a plane that crashed in Italy); see
also, e. g., Dallas v. Whitney, 118 W. Va. 106, 188 S. E. 766
(1936) (Ohio law applied where blasting operations on a West
Virginia highway caused property damage in Ohio); Camactor liable for an alleged tort takes place.' Since a tort is the product of
wrongful conduct and of resulting injury and since the injury follows the
conduct, the state of the `last event' is the state where the injury
occurred").

4 The FTCA was passed with precisely these kinds of garden-variety

torts in mind. See S. Rep. No. 1400, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 31 (1946)
("With the expansion of governmental activities in recent years, it becomes especially important to grant to private individuals the right to sue
the Government in respect to such torts as negligence in the operation of
vehicles"); see generally Feres v. United States, 340 U. S. 135, 139-140
(1950) (Congress was principally concerned with making the Government
liable for ordinary torts that "would have been actionable if inflicted by
an individual or a corporation").

eron v. Vandegriff, 53 Ark. 381, 13 S. W. 1092 (1890) (Arkan-sas law applied where a blasting of a rock in Indian territory

inflicted injury on plaintiff in Arkansas).The application of foreign substantive law exemplified in
these cases was, however, what Congress intended to avoidby the foreign country exception. In 1942, the House Committee on the Judiciary considered an early draft of the
FTCA that would have exempted all claims "arising in a for-eign country in behalf of an alien." H. R. 5373, 77th Cong.,

2d Sess., $ 303(12). The bill was then revised, at the sugges-tion of the Attorney General, to omit the last five words. In
explaining the amendment to the House Committee on theJudiciary, Assistant Attorney General Shea said that

"[c]laims arising in a foreign country have been ex-empted from this bill, H. R. 6463, whether or not the
claimant is an alien. Since liability is to be determinedby the law of the situs of the wrongful act or omission
it is wise to restrict the bill to claims arising in thiscountry. This seems desirable because the law of the
particular State is being applied. Otherwise, it willlead I think to a good deal of difficulty." Hearings on
H. R. 5373 et al. before the House Committee on theJudiciary, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 35 (1942).

The amended version, which was enacted into law and consti-tutes the current text of the foreign country exception, 28
U. S. C. $ 2680(k), thus codified Congress's "unwilling[ness] tosubject the United States to liabilities depending upon the
laws of a foreign power." United States v. Spelar, 338 U. S.217, 221 (1949). See also

Sami v. United States, 617 F. 2d,
at 762 (noting Spelar's explanation but attempting to recast
the object behind the foreign country exception); Leaf v.
United States, 588 F. 2d 733, 736, n. 3 (CA9 1978).

The object being to avoid application of substantive foreign law, Congress evidently used the modifier "arising in a
foreign country" to refer to claims based on foreign harm or

Opinion of the Court
injury, the fact that would trigger application of foreign lawto determine liability. That object, addressed by the quoted

phrase, would obviously have been thwarted, however, byapplying the headquarters doctrine, for that doctrine would
have displaced the exception by recasting claims of foreigninjury as claims not arising in a foreign country because
some planning or negligence at domestic headquarters wastheir cause.

5 And that, in turn, would have resulted in

applying foreign law of the place of injury, in accordance withthe choice-of-law rule of the headquarters jurisdiction.

Nor, as a practical matter, can it be said that the headquar-ters doctrine has outgrown its tension with the exception.
It is true that the traditional approach to choice of substan-tive tort law has lost favor, Simson, The Choice-of-Law Revolution in the United States: Notes on Rereading VonMehren, 36 Cornell Int'l L. J. 125 (2002) ("The traditional
methodology of place of wrong . . . has receded in importance,and new approaches and concepts such as governmental interest analysis, most significant relationship, and better ruleof law have taken over center stage" (footnotes omitted)).

5 The application of foreign law might nonetheless have been avoided in
headquarters cases if courts had been instructed to apply the substantive
tort law of the State where the federal act or omission occurred, regardless of where the ultimate harm transpired. But in Richards v. United
States, 369 U. S. 1 (1962), we held that the Act requires "the whole law
(including choice-of-law rules) . . . of the State where the [allegedly tortious federal] act or omission occurred," id., at 3, 11. Given the dominant
American choice-of-law approach at the time the Act was passed, that
would have resulted in the application of foreign law in virtually any case
where the plaintiff suffered injury overseas.

Opinion of the Court
But a good many States still employ essentially the samechoice-of-law analysis in tort cases that the First Restatement exemplified. Symeonides, Choice of Law in the Amer-ican Courts, 51 Am. J. Comp. L. 1, 4-5 (2003) ("Ten states
continue to adhere to the traditional method in tort con-flicts"); see, e. g., Raskin v. Allison, 30 Kan. App. 2d 1240,
1242, 1241, 57 P. 3d 30, 32 (2002) (under "traditional choice oflaw principles largely reflected in the original Restatement,"
Mexican law applied to boating accident in Mexican watersbecause "the injuries were sustained in Mexican waters").

Equally to the point is that in at least some cases thatthe Court of Appeals's approach would treat as arising at
headquarters, not the foreign country, even the later method-ologies of choice point to the application of foreign law. The
Second Restatement itself, encouraging the general shift to-ward using flexible balancing analysis to inform choice of
law,7 includes a default rule for tort cases rooted in the tradi-tional approach: "[i]n an action for a personal injury, the local
law of the state where the injury occurred determines therights and liabilities of the parties, unless . . . some other
state has a more significant relationship . . . to the occurrenceand the parties." Restatement 2d $ 146; see also id., Comment e ("On occasion, conduct and personal injury will occurin different states. In such instances, the local law of the
state of injury will usually be applied to determine most is-sues involving the tort"). In practice, then, the new dispensation frequently leads to the traditional application of the
cate how, as a positive matter, transjurisdictional cases are likely to be
treated today.

7 Under the Second Restatement, tort liability is determined "by the

local law of the state which . . . has the most significant relationship to the
occurrence and the parties," taking into account "the place where the injury occurred," "the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred,"
"the domicil, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of
business of the parties," and "the place where the relationship, if any,
between the parties is centered." Restatement 2d $ 145.

law of the jurisdiction of injury. See, e. g., Dorman v. Emer-son Elec. Co., 23 F. 3d 1354 (CA8 1994) (applying Canadian

law where negligent saw design in Missouri caused injury inCanada); Bing v. Halstead, 495 F. Supp. 517 (SDNY 1980)
(applying Costa Rican law where letter written and mailedin Arizona caused mental distress in Costa Rica); McKinnon
v. F. H. Morgan & Co., 170 Vt. 422, 750 A. 2d 1026 (2000)(applying Canadian law where a defective bicycle sold in Vermont caused injuries in Quebec).In sum, current flexibility in choice-of-law methodology
gives no assurance against applying foreign substantive lawif federal courts follow headquarters doctrine to assume jurisdiction over tort claims against the Government for for-eign harm. Based on the experience just noted, the expectation is that application of the headquarters doctrine wouldin fact result in a substantial number of cases applying the
very foreign law the foreign country exception was meantto avoid.

Before concluding that headquarters analysis should haveno part in applying the foreign country exception, however,

8 The courts that have applied the headquarters doctrine, believing it to
be intimated by our emphasis, in Richards v. United States, supra, on
the place of the occurrence of the negligent act, have acknowledged the
possibility that foreign law may govern FTCA claims as a function of
Richards's further holding that the whole law of the pertinent State (including its choice-of-law provisions) is to be applied. See, e. g., Leaf, 588
F. 2d, at 736, n. 3. Some courts have attempted to defuse the resulting
tension with the object behind the foreign country exception. See, e. g.,
Sami v. United States, 617 F. 2d 755, 763 (CADC 1979) (believing that
norm against application of foreign law when contrary to forum policy is
sufficient to overcome possible conflict). We think that these attempts to
resolve the tension give short shrift to the clear congressional mandate
embodied by the foreign country exception. Cf. Shapiro, Choice of Law
Under the Federal Tort Claims Act: Richards and Renvoi Revisited, 70
N. C. L. Rev. 641, 659-660 (1992) (noting that the Richards rule that the
totality of a State's law is to be consulted may undermine the object behind the foreign country exception).

Opinion of the Court
a word is needed to answer an argument for selective application of headquarters doctrine, that it ought to be permitted
when a State's choice-of-law approach would not apply the
foreign law of place of injury. See In re "Agent Orange"
Product Liability Litigation, 580 F. Supp. 1242, 1254
(EDNY 1984) (noting that the purpose of the exception did
not apply to the litigation at hand because foreign law was
not implicated). The point would be well taken, of course,
if Congress had written the exception to apply when foreign
law would be applied. But that is not what Congress said.
Its provision of an exception when a claim arises in a foreign
country was written at a time when the phrase "arising in"
was used in state statutes to express the position that a
claim arises where the harm occurs; and the odds are that
Congress meant simply this when it used the "arising in"
language.9 Finally, even if it were not a stretch to equate
"arising in a foreign country" with "implicating foreign law,"
the result of accepting headquarters analysis for foreign injury cases in which no application of foreign law would ensue
would be a scheme of federal jurisdiction that would vary
from State to State, benefiting or penalizing plaintiffs accordingly. The idea that Congress would have intended any

9 It is difficult to reconcile the Government's contrary reading with the
fact that two of the Act's other exceptions specifically reference an "act or
omission." See 28 U. S. C. $ 2680(a) (exempting United States from liability for "[a]ny claim based upon an act or omission of an employee of the
Government, exercising due care, in the execution of a statute or regulation"); $ 2680(e) ("Any claim arising out of an act or omission of any employee of the Government in administering [certain portions of the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917]"). The Government's request that we
read that phrase into the foreign country exception, when it is clear that
Congress knew how to specify "act or omission" when it wanted to, runs
afoul of the usual rule that "when the legislature uses certain language in
one part of the statute and different language in another, the court assumes different meanings were intended." 2A N. Singer, Statutes and
Statutory Construction $ 46:06, p. 194 (6th rev. ed. 2000).

712 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAIN

Opinion of the Court
such jurisdictional variety is too implausible to drive the
analysis to the point of grafting even a selective headquarters exception onto the foreign country exception itself. We
therefore hold that the FTCA's foreign country exception
bars all claims based on any injury suffered in a foreign
country, regardless of where the tortious act or omission
occurred.

III

Alvarez has also brought an action under the ATS against
petitioner Sosa, who argues (as does the United States supporting him) that there is no relief under the ATS because
the statute does no more than vest federal courts with jurisdiction, neither creating nor authorizing the courts to recognize any particular right of action without further congressional action. Although we agree the statute is in terms
only jurisdictional, we think that at the time of enactment
the jurisdiction enabled federal courts to hear claims in a
very limited category defined by the law of nations and recognized at common law. We do not believe, however, that
the limited, implicit sanction to entertain the handful of international law cum common law claims understood in 1789
should be taken as authority to recognize the right of action
asserted by Alvarez here.

A

Judge Friendly called the ATS a "legal Lohengrin," IIT
v. Vencap, Ltd., 519 F. 2d 1001, 1015 (CA2 1975); "no one
seems to know whence it came," ibid., and for over 170 years
after its enactment it provided jurisdiction in only one case.
The first Congress passed it as part of the Judiciary Act of
1789, in providing that the new federal district courts "shall
also have cognizance, concurrent with the courts of the several States, or the circuit courts, as the case may be, of all
causes where an alien sues for a tort only in violation of the

law of nations or a treaty of the United States." Act ofSept. 24, 1789, ch. 20, $ 9, 1 Stat. 77.

10

The parties and amici here advance radically different his-torical interpretations of this terse provision. Alvarez says

that the ATS was intended not simply as a jurisdictionalgrant, but as authority for the creation of a new cause of
action for torts in violation of international law. We thinkthat reading is implausible. As enacted in 1789, the ATS
gave the district courts "cognizance" of certain causes of ac-tion, and the term bespoke a grant of jurisdiction, not power
to mold substantive law. See, e. g., The Federalist No. 81,pp. 447, 451 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) (using "jurisdiction" interchangeably with "cognizance"). The fact that theATS was placed in $ 9 of the Judiciary Act, a statute otherwise exclusively concerned with federal-court jurisdiction,is itself support for its strictly jurisdictional nature. Nor
would the distinction between jurisdiction and cause of ac-tion have been elided by the drafters of the Act or those who
voted on it. As Fisher Ames put it, "there is a substantialdifference between the jurisdiction of the courts and the
rules of decision." 1 Annals of Cong. 807 (Gales ed. 1834).It is unsurprising, then, that an authority on the historical
origins of the ATS has written that "section 1350 clearly doesnot create a statutory cause of action," and that the contrary suggestion is "simply frivolous." Casto, The FederalCourts' Protective Jurisdiction over Torts Committed in Violation of the Law of Nations, 18 Conn. L. Rev. 467, 479, 480(1986) (hereinafter Casto, Law of Nations); cf. Dodge, The
Constitutionality of the Alien Tort Statute: Some Observa-tions on Text and Context, 42 Va. J. Int'l L. 687, 689 (2002).

10 The statute has been slightly modified on a number of occasions since
its original enactment. It now reads in its entirety: "The district courts
shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort
only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United
States." 28 U. S. C. $ 1350.

714 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAIN

Opinion of the Court
In sum, we think the statute was intended as jurisdictionalin the sense of addressing the power of the courts to entertain cases concerned with a certain subject.But holding the ATS jurisdictional raises a new question,
this one about the interaction between the ATS at the timeof its enactment and the ambient law of the era. Sosa would
have it that the ATS was stillborn because there could be noclaim for relief without a further statute expressly authorizing adoption of causes of action. Amici professors of federaljurisdiction and legal history take a different tack, that federal courts could entertain claims once the jurisdictionalgrant was on the books, because torts in violation of the law
of nations would have been recognized within the commonlaw of the time. Brief for Vikram Amar et al. as

Amici Cu-riae. We think history and practice give the edge to this

latter position. 1

"When the United States declared their independence,they were bound to receive the law of nations, in its modern
state of purity and refinement." Ware v. Hylton, 3 Dall.199, 281 (1796) (Wilson, J.). In the years of the early Republic, this law of nations comprised two principal elements, thefirst covering the general norms governing the behavior of
national states with each other: "the science which teaches
the rights subsisting between nations or states, and the obli-gations correspondent to those rights," E. de Vattel, Law of

Nations, Preliminaries $ 3 (J. Chitty et al. transl. and ed.1883) (hereinafter Vattel) (footnote omitted), or "that code of
public instruction which defines the rights and prescribes theduties of nations, in their intercourse with each other," 1
J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *1. This aspect ofthe law of nations thus occupied the executive and legislative
domains, not the judicial. See 4 W. Blackstone, Commentar-ies on the Laws of England 68 (1769) (hereinafter Commentaries) ("[O]ffences against" the law of nations are "princi-pally incident to whole states or nations").

Opinion of the Court
The law of nations included a second, more pedestrian ele-ment, however, that did fall within the judicial sphere, as a

body of judge-made law regulating the conduct of individualssituated outside domestic boundaries and consequently carrying an international savor. To Blackstone, the law of na-tions in this sense was implicated "in mercantile questions,
such as bills of exchange and the like; in all marine causes,relating to freight, average, demurrage, insurances, bottomry . . . ; [and] in all disputes relating to prizes, to ship-wrecks, to hostages, and ransom bills."

Id., at 67. The lawmerchant emerged from the customary practices of international traders and admiralty required its own transnationalregulation. And it was the law of nations in this sense that
our precursors spoke about when the Court explained thestatus of coast fishing vessels in wartime grew from "ancient
usage among civilized nations, beginning centuries ago, andgradually ripening into a rule of international law . . . ."
The Paquete Habana, 175 U. S. 677, 686 (1900).There was, finally, a sphere in which these rules binding
individuals for the benefit of other individuals overlappedwith the norms of state relationships. Blackstone referred
to it when he mentioned three specific offenses against thelaw of nations addressed by the criminal law of England:
violation of safe conducts, infringement of the rights of am-bassadors, and piracy. 4 Commentaries 68. An assault
against an ambassador, for example, impinged upon the sov-ereignty of the foreign nation and if not adequately redressed could rise to an issue of war. See Vattel 463-464.It was this narrow set of violations of the law of nations,
admitting of a judicial remedy and at the same time threat-ening serious consequences in international affairs, that was
probably on minds of the men who drafted the ATS with itsreference to tort.

Before there was any ATS, a distinctly American preoccu-pation with these hybrid international norms had taken

Opinion of the Court
shape owing to the distribution of political power from independence through the period of confederation. The Continental Congress was hamstrung by its inability to "cause
infractions of treaties, or of the law of nations to be punished," J. Madison, Journal of the Constitutional Convention
60 (E. Scott ed. 1893), and in 1781 the Congress implored the
States to vindicate rights under the law of nations. In
words that echo Blackstone, the congressional resolution
called upon state legislatures to "provide expeditious, exemplary and adequate punishment" for "the violation of safe
conducts or passports, . . . of hostility against such as are in
amity . . . with the United States, . . . infractions of the
immunities of ambassadors and other public ministers . . .
[and] infractions of treaties and conventions to which the
United States are a party." 21 Journals of the Continental
Congress 1136-1137 (G. Hunt ed. 1912) (hereinafter Journals
of the Continental Congress). The resolution recommended
that the States "authorise suits . . . for damages by the party
injured, and for compensation to the United States for damage sustained by them from an injury done to a foreign
power by a citizen." Id., at 1137; cf. Vattel 463-464 ("Whoever offends . . . a public minister . . . should be punished . . . ,
and . . . the state should, at the expense of the delinquent,
give full satisfaction to the sovereign who has been offended
in the person of his minister"). Apparently only one State
acted upon the recommendation, see Public Records of the
State of Connecticut, 1782, pp. 82, 83 (L. Larabee ed. 1982)
(1942 compilation, exact date of Act unknown), but Congress
had done what it could to signal a commitment to enforce
the law of nations.

Appreciation of the Continental Congress's incapacity to
deal with this class of cases was intensified by the so-called
Marbois incident of May 1784, in which a French adventurer,
De Longchamps, verbally and physically assaulted the Secretary of the French Legion in Philadelphia. See Respublica

v. De Longchamps, 1 Dall. 111 (O. T. Phila. 1784).11 Congress called again for state legislation addressing such matters, and concern over the inadequate vindication of the law
of nations persisted through the time of the Constitutional
Convention. See 1 Records of the Federal Convention of
1787, p. 25 (M. Farrand ed. 1911) (speech of J. Randolph).
During the Convention itself, in fact, a New York City constable produced a reprise of the Marbois affair and Secretary
Jay reported to Congress on the Dutch Ambassador's protest, with the explanation that " `the federal government
does not appear . . . to be vested with any judicial Powers
competent to the Cognizance and Judgment of such Cases.' "
Casto, Law of Nations 494, and n. 152.

The Framers responded by vesting the Supreme Court
with original jurisdiction over "all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public ministers and Consuls." U. S. Const.,
Art. III, $ 2, and the First Congress followed through. The
Judiciary Act reinforced this Court's original jurisdiction
over suits brought by diplomats, see 1 Stat. 80, ch. 20, $ 13,
created alienage jurisdiction, $ 11, and, of course, included
the ATS, $ 9. See generally Randall, Federal Jurisdiction
over International Law Claims: Inquiries into the Alien Tort
Statute, 18 N. Y. U. J. Int'l L. & Pol. 1, 15-21 (1985) (herein11 The French minister plenipotentiary lodged a formal protest with the

in state court.

The Congress could only pass resolutions, one approving the state-court

Judiciary Act); W. Casto, The Supreme Court in the Early
Republic 27-53 (1995).

Although Congress modified the draft of what became the
Judiciary Act, see generally Warren, New Light on the History of the Federal Judiciary Act of 1789, 37 Harv. L. Rev.
49 (1923), it made hardly any changes to the provisions on
aliens, including what became the ATS, see Casto, Law of
Nations 498. There is no record of congressional discussion
about private actions that might be subject to the jurisdictional provision, or about any need for further legislation to
create private remedies; there is no record even of debate on
the section. Given the poverty of drafting history, modern
commentators have necessarily concentrated on the text, remarking on the innovative use of the word "tort," see, e. g.,
Sweeney, A Tort only in Violation of the Law of Nations, 18
Hastings Int'l & Comp. L. Rev. 445 (1995) (arguing that
"tort" refers to the law of prize), and the statute's mixture
of terms expansive ("all suits"), see, e. g., Casto, Law of Nations 500, and restrictive ("for a tort only"), see, e. g., Randall
28-31 (limiting suits to torts, as opposed to commercial
actions, especially by British plaintiffs).12 The historical
scholarship has also placed the ATS within the competition
between federalist and antifederalist forces over the national
role in foreign relations. Id., at 22-23 (nonexclusiveness of
federal jurisdiction under the ATS may reflect compromise).
But despite considerable scholarly attention, it is fair to say

12 The restriction may have served the different purpose of putting foreigners on notice that they would no longer be able to prosecute their
own criminal cases in federal court. Compare, e. g., 3 Commentaries 160
(victims could start prosecutions) with the Judiciary Act $ 35 (creating the
office of the district attorney). Cf. 1 Op. Atty. Gen. 41, 42 (1794) (British
consul could not himself initiate criminal prosecution, but could provide
evidence to the grand jury).

719Cite as: 542 U. S. 692 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
that a consensus understanding of what Congress intended
has proven elusive.

Still, the history does tend to support two propositions.
First, there is every reason to suppose that the First Congress did not pass the ATS as a jurisdictional convenience to
be placed on the shelf for use by a future Congress or state
legislature that might, someday, authorize the creation of
causes of action or itself decide to make some element of the
law of nations actionable for the benefit of foreigners. The
anxieties of the preconstitutional period cannot be ignored
easily enough to think that the statute was not meant to
have a practical effect. Consider that the principal draftsman of the ATS was apparently Oliver Ellsworth,13 previously a member of the Continental Congress that had
passed the 1781 resolution and a member of the Connecticut
Legislature that made good on that congressional request.
See generally W. Brown, The Life of Oliver Ellsworth (1905).
Consider, too, that the First Congress was attentive enough
to the law of nations to recognize certain offenses expressly
as criminal, including the three mentioned by Blackstone.
See An Act for the Punishment of Certain Crimes Against
the United States, $ 8, 1 Stat. 113-114 (murder or robbery,
or other capital crimes, punishable as piracy if committed on
the high seas), and $ 28, id., at 118 (violation of safe conducts
and assaults against ambassadors punished by imprisonment
and fines described as "infract[ions of] the law of nations").
It would have been passing strange for Ellsworth and this
very Congress to vest federal courts expressly with jurisdiction to entertain civil causes brought by aliens alleging violations of the law of nations, but to no effect whatever until
the Congress should take further action. There is too much
in the historical record to believe that Congress would have
enacted the ATS only to leave it lying fallow indefinitely.

13 The ATS appears in Ellsworth's handwriting in the original version of
the bill in the National Archives. Casto, Law of Nations 498, n. 169.

542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN
720 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAIN

Opinion of the Court
The second inference to be drawn from the history is that
Congress intended the ATS to furnish jurisdiction for a relatively modest set of actions alleging violations of the law of
nations. Uppermost in the legislative mind appears to have
been offenses against ambassadors, see id., at 118; violations
of safe conduct were probably understood to be actionable,
ibid., and individual actions arising out of prize captures and
piracy may well have also been contemplated, id., at 113-114.
But the common law appears to have understood only those
three of the hybrid variety as definite and actionable, or at
any rate, to have assumed only a very limited set of claims.
As Blackstone had put it, "offences against this law [of nations] are principally incident to whole states or nations,"
and not individuals seeking relief in court. 4 Commentaries 68.

4

The sparse contemporaneous cases and legal materials referring to the ATS tend to confirm both inferences, that
some, but few, torts in violation of the law of nations were
understood to be within the common law. In Bolchos v.
Darrel, 3 F. Cas. 810 (No. 1,607) (SC 1795), the District
Court's doubt about admiralty jurisdiction over a suit for
damages brought by a French privateer against the mortgagee of a British slave ship was assuaged by assuming that
the ATS was a jurisdictional basis for the court's action.
Nor is Moxon v. The Fanny, 17 F. Cas. 942 (No. 9,895) (Pa.
1793), to the contrary, a case in which the owners of a British
ship sought damages for its seizure in United States waters
by a French privateer. The District Court said in dictum
that the ATS was not the proper vehicle for suit because "[i]t
cannot be called a suit for a tort only, when the property, as
well as damages for the supposed trespass, are sought for."
Id., at 948. But the judge gave no intimation that further
legislation would have been needed to give the District
Court jurisdiction over a suit limited to damages.

721Cite as: 542 U. S. 692 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
Then there was the 1795 opinion of Attorney General William Bradford, who was asked whether criminal prosecution
was available against Americans who had taken part in the
French plunder of a British slave colony in Sierra Leone. 1
Op. Atty. Gen. 57. Bradford was uncertain, but he made it
clear that a federal court was open for the prosecution of a
tort action growing out of the episode:

"But there can be no doubt that the company or individuals who have been injured by these acts of hostility
have a remedy by a civil suit in the courts of the United
States; jurisdiction being expressly given to these
courts in all cases where an alien sues for a tort only, in
violation of the laws of nations, or a treaty of the United
States . . . ." Id., at 59.

Although it is conceivable that Bradford (who had prosecuted in the Marbois incident, see Casto, Law of Nations 503,
n. 201) assumed that there had been a violation of a treaty,
1 Op. Atty. Gen., at 58, that is certainly not obvious, and it
appears likely that Bradford understood the ATS to provide
jurisdiction over what must have amounted to common law
causes of action.

B

Against these indications that the ATS was meant to underwrite litigation of a narrow set of common law actions
derived from the law of nations, Sosa raises two main objections. First, he claims that this conclusion makes no sense
in view of the Continental Congress's 1781 recommendation
to state legislatures to pass laws authorizing such suits.
Sosa thinks state legislation would have been "absurd,"
Reply Brief for Petitioner Sosa 5, if common law remedies
had been available. Second, Sosa juxtaposes Blackstone's
treatise mentioning violations of the law of nations as occasions for criminal remedies, against the statute's innovative
reference to "tort," as evidence that there was no familiar

Opinion of the Court
set of legal actions for exercise of jurisdiction under the ATS.Neither argument is convincing.

The notion that it would have been absurd for the Conti-nental Congress to recommend that States pass positive law
to duplicate remedies already available at common law restson a misunderstanding of the relationship between common
law and positive law in the late 18th century, when positive
law was frequently relied upon to reinforce and give stand-ard expression to the "brooding omnipresence"

14 of the common law then thought discoverable by reason. As Black-stone clarified the relation between positive law and the law

of nations, "those acts of parliament, which have from timeto time been made to enforce this universal law, or to facilitate the execution of [its] decisions, are not to be consideredas introductive of any new rule, but merely as declaratory of
the old fundamental constitutions of the kingdom; withoutwhich it must cease to be a part of the civilized world." 4
Commentaries 67. Indeed, Sosa's argument is underminedby the 1781 resolution on which he principally relies. Notwithstanding the undisputed fact (per Blackstone) that the
common law afforded criminal law remedies for violations ofthe law of nations, the Continental Congress encouraged

state legislatures to pass criminal statutes to the same effect,and the first Congress did the same,

supra, at 719.15

14 See Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, 244 U. S. 205, 222 (1917) (Holmes,
J., dissenting).

15 Being consistent with the prevailing understanding of international

law, the 1781 resolution is sensibly understood as an act of international
politics, for the recommendation was part of a program to assure the world
that the new Republic would observe the law of nations. On the same
day it made its recommendation to state legislatures, the Continental Congress received a confidential report, detailing negotiations between American representatives and Versailles. 21 Journals of the Continental Congress 1137-1140. The King was concerned about the British capture of
the ship Marquis de la Fayette on its way to Boston, id., at 1139, and he

Opinion of the Court
Nor are we convinced by Sosa's argument that legislationconferring a right of action is needed because Blackstone

treated international law offenses under the rubric of "publicwrongs," whereas the ATS uses a word, "tort," that was relatively uncommon in the legal vernacular of the day. It istrue that Blackstone did refer to what he deemed the three
principal offenses against the law of nations in the course ofdiscussing criminal sanctions, observing that it was in the
interest of sovereigns "to animadvert upon them with a be-coming severity, that the peace of the world may be maintained," 4 Commentaries 68.16 But Vattel explicitly linked
be digested and adopted, as the Court of France wished to make it the
basis of some commercial arrangements between France and the United
States," id., at 1140. The congressional resolution would not have been
all that Louis XVI wished for, but it was calculated to assure foreign
powers that Congress at least intended their concerns to be addressed in
the way they would have chosen. As a French legal treatise well known
to early American lawyers, see Helmholz, Use of the Civil Law in PostRevolutionary American Jurisprudence, 66 Tulane L. Rev. 1649 (1992), put
it, "the laws ought to be written, to the end that the writing may fix the
sense of the law, and determine the mind to conceive a just idea of that
which is established by the law, and that it not [be] left free for every one
to frame the law as he himself is pleased to understand it . . . ." 1 J.
Domat, The Civil Law in its Natural Order 108 (W. Strahan transl. and L.
Cushing ed. 1861). A congressional statement that common law was up
to the task at hand might well have fallen short of impressing a continental readership.

16 Petitioner says animadversion is "an archaic reference to the imposition of punishment." Reply Brief for Petitioner Sosa 4 (emphasis in original). That claim is somewhat exaggerated, however. To animadvert
carried the broader implication of "turn[ing] the attention officially or
judicially, tak[ing] legal cognizance of anything deserving of chastisement
or censure; hence, to proceed by way of punishment or censure." 1 Oxford English Dictionary 474 (2d ed. 1989). Blackstone in fact used the
term in the context of property rights and damages. Of a man who is
disturbed in his enjoyment of "qualified property" "the law will animadvert hereon as an injury." 2 Commentaries 395. See also 9 Papers of
James Madison 349 (R. Rutland ed. 1975) ("As yet foreign powers have not
been rigorous in animadverting on us" for violations of the law of nations).

the criminal sanction for offenses against ambassadors withthe requirement that the state, "at the expense of the delinquent, give full satisfaction to the sovereign who has beenoffended in the person of his minister." Vattel 463-464.
Cf. Stephens, Individuals Enforcing International Law: TheComparative and Historical Context, 52 DePaul L. Rev. 433,
444 (2002) (observing that a "mixed approach to internationallaw violations, encompassing both criminal prosecution . . .
and compensation to those injured through a civil suit, wouldhave been familiar to the founding generation"). The 1781
resolution goes a step further in showing that a private rem-edy was thought necessary for diplomatic offenses under the
law of nations. And the Attorney General's Letter of 1795,as well as the two early federal precedents discussing the
ATS, point to a prevalent assumption that Congress did notintend the ATS to sit on the shelf until some future time
when it might enact further legislation.In sum, although the ATS is a jurisdictional statute creating no new causes of action, the reasonable inference fromthe historical materials is that the statute was intended to
have practical effect the moment it became law. The juris-dictional grant is best read as having been enacted on the
understanding that the common law would provide a causeof action for the modest number of international law violations with a potential for personal liability at the time.

IV
We think it is correct, then, to assume that the First Con-gress understood that the district courts would recognize

private causes of action for certain torts in violation of thelaw of nations, though we have found no basis to suspect
Congress had any examples in mind beyond those torts cor-responding to Blackstone's three primary offenses: violation
of safe conducts, infringement of the rights of ambassadors,and piracy. We assume, too, that no development in the two
centuries from the enactment of $ 1350 to the birth of the

Opinion of the Court
modern line of cases beginning with Filartiga v. Pena-Irala,630 F. 2d 876 (CA2 1980), has categorically precluded federal

courts from recognizing a claim under the law of nations asan element of common law; Congress has not in any relevant
way amended $ 1350 or limited civil common law power byanother statute. Still, there are good reasons for a restrained conception of the discretion a federal court shouldexercise in considering a new cause of action of this kind.
Accordingly, we think courts should require any claim basedon the present-day law of nations to rest on a norm of international character accepted by the civilized world and de-fined with a specificity comparable to the features of the
18th-century paradigms we have recognized. This require-ment is fatal to Alvarez's claim.

A
A series of reasons argue for judicial caution when consid-ering the kinds of individual claims that might implement

the jurisdiction conferred by the early statute. First, theprevailing conception of the common law has changed since
1789 in a way that counsels restraint in judicially applyinginternationally generated norms. When $ 1350 was enacted,
the accepted conception was of the common law as "a tran-scendental body of law outside of any particular State but
obligatory within it unless and until changed by statute."Black and White Taxicab & Transfer Co. v. Brown and Yellow Taxicab & Transfer Co., 276 U. S. 518, 533 (1928)(Holmes, J., dissenting). Now, however, in most cases where
a court is asked to state or formulate a common law principlein a new context, there is a general understanding that the
law is not so much found or discovered as it is either madeor created. Holmes explained famously in 1881 that

"in substance the growth of the law is legislative . . .[because t]he very considerations which judges most
rarely mention, and always with an apology, are the se-cret root from which the law draws all the juices of life.

542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN
726 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAIN

Opinion of the Court
I mean, of course, considerations of what is expedient forthe community concerned." The Common Law 31-32

(Howe ed. 1963).
One need not accept the Holmesian view as far as its ultimateimplications to acknowledge that a judge deciding in reliance

on an international norm will find a substantial element ofdiscretionary judgment in the decision.

Second, along with, and in part driven by, that conceptualdevelopment in understanding common law has come an
equally significant rethinking of the role of the federal courtsin making it.

Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938),was the watershed in which we denied the existence of any

federal "general" common law, id., at 78, which largely with-drew to havens of specialty, some of them defined by express
congressional authorization to devise a body of law directly,
e. g., Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., 353 U. S. 448(1957) (interpretation of collective-bargaining agreements);

Fed. Rule Evid. 501 (evidentiary privileges in federal-question cases). Elsewhere, this Court has thought it was
in order to create federal common law rules in interstitialareas of particular federal interest.

E. g., United States v.
Kimbell Foods, Inc., 440 U. S. 715, 726-727 (1979).17 Andalthough we have even assumed competence to make judicial

rules of decision of particular importance to foreign rela-tions, such as the act of state doctrine, see

Banco Nacional
de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U. S. 398, 427 (1964), the general
practice has been to look for legislative guidance before exer-cising innovative authority over substantive law. It would

be remarkable to take a more aggressive role in exercisinga jurisdiction that remained largely in shadow for much of
the prior two centuries.

Opinion of the Court
Third, this Court has recently and repeatedly said that adecision to create a private right of action is one better left

to legislative judgment in the great majority of cases. Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U. S. 61, 68 (2001);
Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U. S. 275, 286-287 (2001). Thecreation of a private right of action raises issues beyond the

mere consideration whether underlying primary conduct
should be allowed or not, entailing, for example, a decisionto permit enforcement without the check imposed by prosecutorial discretion. Accordingly, even when Congress hasmade it clear by statute that a rule applies to purely domestic conduct, we are reluctant to infer intent to provide a private cause of action where the statute does not supply one
expressly. While the absence of congressional action addressing private rights of action under an international norm
is more equivocal than its failure to provide such a right
when it creates a statute, the possible collateral consequences of making international rules privately actionable
argue for judicial caution.

Fourth, the subject of those collateral consequences is itself a reason for a high bar to new private causes of action
for violating international law, for the potential implications
for the foreign relations of the United States of recognizing
such causes should make courts particularly wary of impinging on the discretion of the Legislative and Executive
Branches in managing foreign affairs. It is one thing for
American courts to enforce constitutional limits on our own
State and Federal Governments' power, but quite another to
consider suits under rules that would go so far as to claim a
limit on the power of foreign governments over their own
citizens, and to hold that a foreign government or its agent
has transgressed those limits. Cf. Sabbatino, supra, at 431-
432. Yet modern international law is very much concerned
with just such questions, and apt to stimulate calls for vindicating private interests in $ 1350 cases. Since many attempts by federal courts to craft remedies for the violation

542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN
728 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAIN

Opinion of the Court
of new norms of international law would raise risks of ad-verse foreign policy consequences, they should be undertaken, if at all, with great caution. Cf. Tel-Oren v. LibyanArab Republic, 726 F. 2d 774, 813 (CADC 1984) (Bork, J.,
concurring) (expressing doubt that $ 1350 should be read torequire "our courts [to] sit in judgment of the conduct of
foreign officials in their own countries with respect to theirown citizens").

The fifth reason is particularly important in light of thefirst four. We have no congressional mandate to seek out
and define new and debatable violations of the law of nations,and modern indications of congressional understanding of
the judicial role in the field have not affirmatively encour-aged greater judicial creativity. It is true that a clear mandate appears in the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991,106 Stat. 73, providing authority that "establish[es] an unambiguous and modern basis for" federal claims of torture andextrajudicial killing, H. R. Rep. No. 102-367, pt. 1, p. 3 (1991).
But that affirmative authority is confined to specific subjectmatter, and although the legislative history includes the remark that $ 1350 should "remain intact to permit suits basedon other norms that already exist or may ripen in the future
into rules of customary international law," id., at 4, Congressas a body has done nothing to promote such suits. Several
times, indeed, the Senate has expressly declined to give thefederal courts the task of interpreting and applying international human rights law, as when its ratification of the Inter-national Covenant on Civil and Political Rights declared that
the substantive provisions of the document were not self-executing. 138 Cong. Rec. 8071 (1992).

B
These reasons argue for great caution in adapting the lawof nations to private rights.

Justice Scalia, post, p. 739(opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment), concludes that caution is too hospitable, and a word is in order

542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

729Cite as: 542 U. S. 692 (2004)
Opinion of the Court
to summarize where we have come so far and to focus ourdifference with him on whether some norms of today's law

of nations may ever be recognized legitimately by federalcourts in the absence of congressional action beyond $ 1350.
All Members of the Court agree that $ 1350 is only jurisdic-tional. We also agree, or at least

Justice Scalia does not
dispute, post, at 739, 744, that the jurisdiction was originally
understood to be available to enforce a small number of in-ternational norms that a federal court could properly recognize as within the common law enforceable without furtherstatutory authority.

Justice Scalia concludes, however,
that two subsequent developments should be understood to
preclude federal courts from recognizing any further international norms as judicially enforceable today, absent further
congressional action. As described before, we now tend to
understand common law not as a discoverable reflection of
universal reason but, in a positivistic way, as a product of
human choice. And we now adhere to a conception of limited judicial power first expressed in reorienting federal diversity jurisdiction, see Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S.
64 (1938), that federal courts have no authority to derive
"general" common law.

Whereas Justice Scalia sees these developments as sufficient to close the door to further independent judicial recognition of actionable international norms, other considerations
persuade us that the judicial power should be exercised on
the understanding that the door is still ajar subject to vigilant doorkeeping, and thus open to a narrow class of international norms today. Erie did not in terms bar any judicial
recognition of new substantive rules, no matter what the circumstances, and post-Erie understanding has identified limited enclaves in which federal courts may derive some substantive law in a common law way. For two centuries we
have affirmed that the domestic law of the United States
recognizes the law of nations. See, e. g., Sabbatino, 376
U. S., at 423 ("[I]t is, of course, true that United States

courts apply international law as a part of our own in appro-priate circumstances");

18 The Paquete Habana, 175 U. S., at

700 ("International law is part of our law, and must be ascer-tained and administered by the courts of justice of appropriate jurisdiction, as often as questions of right dependingupon it are duly presented for their determination");

The
Nereide, 9 Cranch 388, 423 (1815) (Marshall, C. J.) ("[T]he
Court is bound by the law of nations which is a part of thelaw of the land"); see also

Texas Industries, Inc. v. Radcliff
Materials, Inc., 451 U. S. 630, 641 (1981) (recognizing that"international disputes implicating . . . our relations with foreign nations" are one of the "narrow areas" in which "federalcommon law" continues to exist). It would take some explaining to say now that federal courts must avert their gazeentirely from any international norm intended to protect
individuals.We think an attempt to justify such a position would be
particularly unconvincing in light of what we know about
congressional understanding bearing on this issue lying at
the intersection of the judicial and legislative powers. The
First Congress, which reflected the understanding of the
framing generation and included some of the Framers, assumed that federal courts could properly identify some international norms as enforceable in the exercise of $ 1350 jurisdiction. We think it would be unreasonable to assume that
the First Congress would have expected federal courts to
lose all capacity to recognize enforceable international norms
simply because the common law might lose some metaphysical cachet on the road to modern realism. Later Congresses

18 Sabbatino itself did not directly apply international law, see 376 U. S.,
at 421-423, but neither did it question the application of that law in appropriate cases, and it further endorsed the reasoning of a noted commentator
who had argued that Erie should not preclude the continued application
of international law in federal courts, 376 U. S., at 425 (citing Jessup, The
Doctrine of Erie Railroad v. Tompkins Applied to International Law, 33
Am. J. Int'l L. 740 (1939)).

Opinion of the Court
seem to have shared our view. The position we take todayhas been assumed by some federal courts for 24 years, ever

since the Second Circuit decided Filartiga v. Pena-Irala, 630F. 2d 876 (CA2 1980), and for practical purposes the point of
today's disagreement has been focused since the exchangebetween Judge Edwards and Judge Bork in Tel-Oren v. Libyan Arab Republic, 726 F. 2d 774 (CADC 1984). Congress,however, has not only expressed no disagreement with our
view of the proper exercise of the judicial power, but hasresponded to its most notable instance by enacting legislation supplementing the judicial determination in some detail.See

supra, at 728 (discussing the Torture Victim ProtectionAct).

While we agree with Justice Scalia to the point thatwe would welcome any congressional guidance in exercising
jurisdiction with such obvious potential to affect foreign rela-tions, nothing Congress has done is a reason for us to shut
the door to the law of nations entirely. It is enough to saythat Congress may do that at any time (explicitly, or implicitly by treaties or statutes that occupy the field), just as itmay modify or cancel any judicial decision so far as it rests
on recognizing an international norm as such.19

C
We must still, however, derive a standard or set of stand-ards for assessing the particular claim Alvarez raises, and

19 Our position does not, as Justice Scalia suggests, imply that every
grant of jurisdiction to a federal court carries with it an opportunity to
develop common law (so that the grant of federal-question jurisdiction
would be equally as good for our purposes as $ 1350), see post, at 745, n.
Section 1350 was enacted on the congressional understanding that courts
would exercise jurisdiction by entertaining some common law claims derived from the law of nations; and we know of no reason to think that
federal-question jurisdiction was extended subject to any comparable congressional assumption. Further, our holding today is consistent with the
division of responsibilities between federal and state courts after Erie,
see supra, at 726, 729-730, as a more expansive common law power related
to 28 U. S. C. $ 1331 might not be.

732 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAIN

Opinion of the Court
for this action it suffices to look to the historical antecedents.
Whatever the ultimate criteria for accepting a cause of action subject to jurisdiction under $ 1350, we are persuaded
that federal courts should not recognize private claims under
federal common law for violations of any international law
norm with less definite content and acceptance among civilized nations than the historical paradigms familiar when

$ 1350 was enacted. See, e. g., United States v. Smith, 5
Wheat. 153, 163-180, n. a (1820) (illustrating the specificity
with which the law of nations defined piracy). This limit
upon judicial recognition is generally consistent with the reasoning of many of the courts and judges who faced the issue
before it reached this Court. See Filartiga, supra, at 890
("[F]or purposes of civil liability, the torturer has become--
like the pirate and slave trader before him--hostis humani
generis, an enemy of all mankind"); Tel-Oren, supra, at 781
(Edwards, J., concurring) (suggesting that the "limits of section 1350's reach" be defined by "a handful of heinous actions--each of which violates definable, universal and obligatory norms"); see also In re Estate of Marcos Human Rights
Litigation, 25 F. 3d 1467, 1475 (CA9 1994) ("Actionable violations of international law must be of a norm that is specific, universal, and obligatory"). And the determination
whether a norm is sufficiently definite to support a cause
of action 20 should (and, indeed, inevitably must) involve an
element of judgment about the practical consequences of

20 A related consideration is whether international law extends the scope
of liability for a violation of a given norm to the perpetrator being sued,
if the defendant is a private actor such as a corporation or individual.
Compare Tel-Oren v. Libyan Arab Republic, 726 F. 2d 774, 791-795 (CADC
1984) (Edwards, J., concurring) (insufficient consensus in 1984 that torture
by private actors violates international law), with Kadic v. Karadz*ic', 70

by private actors violates international law).

making that cause available to litigants in the federalcourts.

21

Thus, Alvarez's detention claim must be gauged againstthe current state of international law, looking to those

sources we have long, albeit cautiously, recognized.

21 This requirement of clear definition is not meant to be the only principle limiting the availability of relief in the federal courts for violations of
customary international law, though it disposes of this action. For example, the European Commission argues as amicus curiae that basic principles of international law require that before asserting a claim in a foreign
forum, the claimant must have exhausted any remedies available in the
domestic legal system, and perhaps in other forums such as international
claims tribunals. See Brief for European Commission as Amicus Curiae
24, n. 54 (citing I. Brownlie, Principles of Public International Law 472-481
(6th ed. 2003)); cf. Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991, $ 2(b), 106 Stat.
73 (exhaustion requirement). We would certainly consider this requirement in an appropriate case.

Another possible limitation that we need not apply here is a policy of
case-specific deference to the political branches. For example, there are
now pending in Federal District Court several class actions seeking damages from various corporations alleged to have participated in, or abetted,
the regime of apartheid that formerly controlled South Africa. See In re
South African Apartheid Litigation, 238 F. Supp. 2d 1379 (JPML 2002)
(granting a motion to transfer the cases to the Southern District of New
York). The Government of South Africa has said that these cases interfere with the policy embodied by its Truth and Reconciliation Commission,
which "deliberately avoided a `victors' justice' approach to the crimes of
apartheid and chose instead one based on confession and absolution, informed by the principles of reconciliation, reconstruction, reparation and
goodwill." Declaration of Penuell Mpapa Maduna, Minister of Justice and
Constitutional Development, Republic of South Africa, reprinted in App.
to Brief for Government of Commonwealth of Australia et al. as Amici
Curiae 7a, || 3.2.1 (emphasis deleted). The United States has agreed.
See Letter of William H. Taft IV, Legal Adviser, Dept. of State, to Shannen W. Coffin, Deputy Asst. Atty. Gen., Oct. 27, 2003, reprinted in id., at
2a. In such cases, there is a strong argument that federal courts should
give serious weight to the Executive Branch's view of the case's impact
on foreign policy. Cf. Republic of Austria v. Altmann, 541 U. S. 677,
701-702 (2004) (discussing the State Department's use of statements of
interest in cases involving the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976,

Opinion of the Court
"[W]here there is no treaty, and no controlling executiveor legislative act or judicial decision, resort must be had

to the customs and usages of civilized nations; and, asevidence of these, to the works of jurists and commentators, who by years of labor, research and experience,have made themselves peculiarly well acquainted with
the subjects of which they treat. Such works are re-sorted to by judicial tribunals, not for the speculations
of their authors concerning what the law ought to be,but for trustworthy evidence of what the law really is."
The Paquete Habana, 175 U. S., at 700.
To begin with, Alvarez cites two well-known internationalagreements that, despite their moral authority, have little

utility under the standard set out in this opinion. He saysthat his abduction by Sosa was an "arbitrary arrest" within
the meaning of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights(Declaration), G. A. Res. 217A (III), U. N. Doc. A/810 (1948).
And he traces the rule against arbitrary arrest not only tothe Declaration, but also to article nine of the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Covenant), Dec. 16,1966, 999 U. N. T. S. 171,

22 to which the United States is a

party, and to various other conventions to which it is not.But the Declaration does not of its own force impose obligations as a matter of international law. See Humphrey, TheUN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
in The International Protection of Human Rights 39, 50(E. Luard ed. 1967) (quoting Eleanor Roosevelt calling the
Declaration " `a statement of principles . . . setting up a com-mon standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations' "

22 Article nine provides that "[n]o one shall be subjected to arbitrary
arrest or detention," that "[n]o one shall be deprived of his liberty except
on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established
by law," and that "[a]nyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest
or detention shall have an enforceable right to compensation." 999

Opinion of the Court
and " `not a treaty or international agreement . . . impos[ing]legal obligations' ").

23 And, although the Covenant does

bind the United States as a matter of international law, theUnited States ratified the Covenant on the express understanding that it was not self-executing and so did not itselfcreate obligations enforceable in the federal courts. See
supra, at 728. Accordingly, Alvarez cannot say that theDeclaration and Covenant themselves establish the relevant
and applicable rule of international law. He instead at-tempts to show that prohibition of arbitrary arrest has attained the status of binding customary international law.Here, it is useful to examine Alvarez's complaint in greater
detail. As he presently argues it, the claim does not rest onthe cross-border feature of his abduction.

24 Although the

District Court granted relief in part on finding a violation ofinternational law in taking Alvarez across the border from

Mexico to the United States, the Court of Appeals rejectedthat ground of liability for failure to identify a norm of requisite force prohibiting a forcible abduction across a border.Instead, it relied on the conclusion that the law of the United
States did not authorize Alvarez's arrest, because the DEAlacked extraterritorial authority under 21 U. S. C. $ 878, and
because Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 4(d)(2) limitedthe warrant for Alvarez's arrest to "the jurisdiction of the
United States." 25 It is this position that Alvarez takes now:

23 It has nevertheless had substantial indirect effect on international law.
See Brownlie, supra, at 535 (calling the Declaration a "good example of an
informal prescription given legal significance by the actions of authoritative decision-makers").

24 Alvarez's brief contains one footnote seeking to incorporate by reference his arguments on cross-border abductions before the Court of Appeals. Brief for Respondent Alvarez-Machain 47, n. 46. That is not
enough to raise the question fairly, and we do not consider it.

25 The Rule has since been moved and amended and now provides that

a warrant may also be executed "anywhere else a federal statute authorizes an arrest." Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 4(c)(2).

736 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAIN

Opinion of the Court
that his arrest was arbitrary and as such forbidden by international law not because it infringed the prerogatives of
Mexico, but because no applicable law authorized it.26

Alvarez thus invokes a general prohibition of "arbitrary"
detention defined as officially sanctioned action exceeding positive authorization to detain under the domestic law
of some government, regardless of the circumstances.
Whether or not this is an accurate reading of the Covenant,
Alvarez cites little authority that a rule so broad has the
status of a binding customary norm today.27 He certainly
cites nothing to justify the federal courts in taking his broad
rule as the predicate for a federal lawsuit, for its implications
would be breathtaking. His rule would support a cause of
action in federal court for any arrest, anywhere in the world,
unauthorized by the law of the jurisdiction in which it took
place, and would create a cause of action for any seizure of
an alien in violation of the Fourth Amendment, supplanting
the actions under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, and

26 We have no occasion to decide whether Alvarez is right that 21 U. S. C.

$ 878 did not authorize the arrest.

27 Specifically, he relies on a survey of national constitutions, Bassiouni,

Human Rights in the Context of Criminal Justice: Identifying International Procedural Protections and Equivalent Protections in National Constitutions, 3 Duke J. Comp. & Int'l L. 235, 260-261 (1993); a case from the
International Court of Justice, United States v. Iran, 1980 I. C. J. 3, 42; and
some authority drawn from the federal courts, see Brief for Respondent
Alvarez-Machain 49, n. 50. None of these suffice. The Bassiouni survey
does show that many nations recognize a norm against arbitrary detention, but that consensus is at a high level of generality. The Iran case, in
which the United States sought relief for the taking of its diplomatic and
consular staff as hostages, involved a different set of international norms
and mentioned the problem of arbitrary detention only in passing; the
detention in that case was, moreover, far longer and harsher than Alvarez's. See 1980 I. C. J., at 42, || 91 ("detention of [United States] staff by a
group of armed militants" lasted "many months"). And the authority
from the federal courts, to the extent it supports Alvarez's position, reflects a more assertive view of federal judicial discretion over claims based
on customary international law than the position we take today.

Opinion of the Court
Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388(1971), that now provide damages remedies for such violations. It would create an action in federal court for arrestsby state officers who simply exceed their authority; and for
the violation of any limit that the law of any country mightplace on the authority of its own officers to arrest. And all
of this assumes that Alvarez could establish that Sosa wasacting on behalf of a government when he made the arrest,
for otherwise he would need a rule broader still.Alvarez's failure to marshal support for his proposed rule
is underscored by the Restatement (Third) of Foreign Rela-tions Law of the United States (1986), which says in its discussion of customary international human rights law that a"state violates international law if, as a matter of state policy, it practices, encourages, or condones . . . prolonged arbi-trary detention." 2

id., $ 702. Although the Restatementdoes not explain its requirements of a "state policy" and of

"prolonged" detention, the implication is clear. Any credi-ble invocation of a principle against arbitrary detention that
the civilized world accepts as binding customary interna-tional law requires a factual basis beyond relatively brief detention in excess of positive authority. Even the Restate-ment's limits are only the beginning of the enquiry, because
although it is easy to say that some policies of prolongedarbitrary detentions are so bad that those who enforce them
become enemies of the human race, it may be harder to saywhich policies cross that line with the certainty afforded by
Blackstone's three common law offenses. In any event, thelabel would never fit the reckless policeman who botches his
warrant, even though that same officer might pay damagesunder municipal law.

E. g., Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U. S. 551(2004).

28 In this action, Sosa might well have been liable under Mexican law.
Alvarez asserted such a claim, but the District Court concluded that the
applicable law was the law of California, and that under California law
Sosa had been privileged to make a citizen's arrest in Mexico. Whether

Opinion of the Court
Whatever may be said for the broad principle Alvarez advances, in the present, imperfect world, it expresses an aspiration that exceeds any binding customary rule having the
specificity we require.29 Creating a private cause of action
to further that aspiration would go beyond any residual common law discretion we think it appropriate to exercise.30 It
is enough to hold that a single illegal detention of less than
a day, followed by the transfer of custody to lawful authorities and a prompt arraignment, violates no norm of customary international law so well defined as to support the creation of a federal remedy.

* * *
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Reversed.

this was correct is not now before us, though we discern tension between
the court's simultaneous conclusions that the detention so lacked any legal
basis as to violate international law, yet was privileged by state law
against ordinary tort recovery.

29 It is not that violations of a rule logically foreclose the existence of

that rule as international law. Cf. Filartiga v. Pena-Irala, 630 F. 2d 876,
884, n. 15 (CA2 1980) ("The fact that the prohibition of torture is often
honored in the breach does not diminish its binding effect as a norm of
international law"). Nevertheless, that a rule as stated is as far from full
realization as the one Alvarez urges is evidence against its status as binding law; and an even clearer point against the creation by judges of a
private cause of action to enforce the aspiration behind the rule claimed.

30 Alvarez also cites, Brief for Respondent Alvarez-Machain 49-50, a

finding by a United Nations working group that his detention was arbitrary under the Declaration, the Covenant, and customary international
law. See Report of the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, U. N. Doc. E/CN.4/1994/27, pp. 139-140 (Dec. 17, 1993). That
finding is not addressed, however, to our demanding standard of definition,
which must be met to raise even the possibility of a private cause of action.
If Alvarez wishes to seek compensation on the basis of the working group's
finding, he must address his request to Congress.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Thomas join, concurring in part and concurring in thejudgment.

There is not much that I would add to the Court's detailedopinion, and only one thing that I would subtract: its reservation of a discretionary power in the Federal Judiciary tocreate causes of action for the enforcement of internationallaw-based norms. Accordingly, I join Parts I, II, and III ofthe Court's opinion in these consolidated cases. Although I
agree with much in Part IV, I cannot join it because thejudicial lawmaking role it invites would commit the Federal
Judiciary to a task it is neither authorized nor suited toperform.

The question at hand is whether the Alien Tort Statute(ATS), 28 U. S. C. $ 1350, provides respondent AlvarezMachain (hereinafter respondent) a cause of action to sue infederal court to recover money damages for violation of what
is claimed to be a customary international law norm againstarbitrary arrest and detention. The ATS provides that
"[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of anycivil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation
of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States." Ibid.The challenge posed by this action is to ascertain (in the
Court's felicitous phrase) "the interaction between the ATSat the time of its enactment and the ambient law of the era."
Ante, at 714. I begin by describing the general principlesthat must guide our analysis.

At the time of its enactment, the ATS provided a federalforum in which aliens could bring suit to recover for torts
committed in "violation of the law of nations." The law ofnations that would have been applied in this federal forum
was at the time part of the so-called general common law.See Young, Sorting out the Debate Over Customary International Law, 42 Va. J. Int'l L. 365, 374 (2002); Bradley & Gold542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

815, 824 (1997); Brief for Vikram Amar et al. as Amici Curiae 12-13.

General common law was not federal law under the Su-premacy Clause, which gave that effect only to the Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties. U. S.
Const., Art. VI, cl. 2. Federal and state courts adjudicatingquestions of general common law were not adjudicating

questions of federal or state law, respectively--the generalcommon law was neither. See generally Clark, Federal
Common Law: A Structural Reinterpretation, 144 U. Pa.
L. Rev. 1245, 1279-1285 (1996). The nonfederal nature of
the law of nations explains this Court's holding that it lacked
jurisdiction in New York Life Ins. Co. v. Hendren, 92 U. S.
286 (1876), where it was asked to review a state-court decision regarding "the effect, under the general public law, of a
state of sectional civil war upon [a] contract of life insurance." Ibid. Although the case involved "the general laws
of war, as recognized by the law of nations applicable to this
case," ibid., it involved no federal question. The Court concluded: "The case, . . . having been presented to the court
below for decision upon principles of general law alone, and
it nowhere appearing that the constitution, laws, treaties, or
executive proclamations, of the United States were necessarily involved in the decision, we have no jurisdiction." Id.,
at 287.

This Court's decision in Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S.
64 (1938), signaled the end of federal-court elaboration and
application of the general common law. Erie repudiated the
holding of Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1 (1842), that federal courts
were free to "express our own opinion" upon "the principles
established in the general commercial law." Id., at 19, 18.
After canvassing the many problems resulting from "the
broad province accorded to the so-called `general law' as to
which federal courts exercised an independent judgment,"

542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

741Cite as: 542 U. S. 692 (2004)
Opinion of Scalia, J.
304 U. S., at 75, the Erie Court extirpated that law with itsfamous declaration that "[t]here is no federal general common law." Id., at 78. Erie affected the status of the law ofnations in federal courts not merely by the implication of its
holding but quite directly, since the question decided in Swiftturned on the "law merchant," then a subset of the law of
nations. See Clark, supra, at 1280-1281.

After the death of the old general common law in Eriecame the birth of a new and different common law pronounced by federal courts. There developed a specificallyfederal common law (in the sense of judicially pronounced
law) for a "few and restricted" areas in which "a federal rule
of decision is necessary to protect uniquely federal interests,
and those in which Congress has given the courts the power
to develop substantive law." Texas Industries, Inc. v. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U. S. 630, 640 (1981) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Unlike the general common law that preceded it, however, federal common law was
self-consciously "made" rather than "discovered," by judges
who sought to avoid falling under the sway of (in Holmes's
hyperbolic language) "[t]he fallacy and illusion" that there
exists "a transcendental body of law outside of any particular
State but obligatory within it unless and until changed by
statute." Black and White Taxicab & Transfer Co. v.
Brown and Yellow Taxicab & Transfer Co., 276 U. S. 518,
533 (1928) (dissenting opinion).

Because post-Erie federal common law is made, not discovered, federal courts must possess some federal-commonlaw-making authority before undertaking to craft it. "Federal courts, unlike state courts, are not general common-law
courts and do not possess a general power to develop and
apply their own rules of decision." Milwaukee v. Illinois,
451 U. S. 304, 312 (1981).

The general rule as formulated in Texas Industries, 451
U. S., at 640-641, is that "[t]he vesting of jurisdiction in the
federal courts does not in and of itself give rise to authority

542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN
742 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAIN

Opinion of Scalia, J.
to formulate federal common law." This rule applies notonly to applications of federal common law that would displace a state rule, but also to applications that simply createa private cause of action under a federal statute. Indeed,
Texas Industries itself involved the petitioner's unsuccessfulrequest for an application of the latter sort--creation of a
right of contribution to damages assessed under the antitrust
laws. See id., at 639-646. See also Northwest Airlines,
Inc. v. Transport Workers, 451 U. S. 77, 99 (1981) (declining
to create a federal-common-law right of contribution to dam-ages assessed under the Equal Pay Act and Title VII).

The rule against finding a delegation of substantive lawmaking power in a grant of jurisdiction is subject to exceptions, some better established than others. The most firmly
entrenched is admiralty law, derived from the grant of admiralty jurisdiction in Article III, $ 2, cl. 3, of the Constitution.
In the exercise of that jurisdiction federal courts develop and
apply a body of general maritime law, "the well-known and
well-developed venerable law of the sea which arose from
the custom among seafaring men." R. M. S. Titanic, Inc. v.
Haver, 171 F. 3d 943, 960 (CA4 1999) (Niemeyer, J.) (internal
quotation marks omitted). At the other extreme is Bivens
v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971),
which created a private damages cause of action against federal officials for violation of the Fourth Amendment. We
have said that the authority to create this cause of action
was derived from "our general jurisdiction to decide all cases
`arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the
United States.' " Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko,
534 U. S. 61, 66 (2001) (quoting 28 U. S. C. $ 1331). While
Bivens stands, the ground supporting it has eroded. For
the past 25 years, "we have consistently refused to extend
Bivens liability to any new context." Correctional Services
Corp., supra, at 68. Bivens is "a relic of the heady days in
which this Court assumed common-law powers to create
causes of action." 534 U. S., at 75 (Scalia, J., concurring).

Opinion of Scalia, J.

II
With these general principles in mind, I turn to the question presented. The Court's detailed exegesis of the ATS
conclusively establishes that it is "a jurisdictional statute
creating no new causes of action." Ante, at 724. The Court
provides a persuasive explanation of why respondent's contrary interpretation, that "the ATS was intended not simply
as a jurisdictional grant, but as authority for the creation of
a new cause of action for torts in violation of international
law," is wrong. Ante, at 713. Indeed, the Court properly
endorses the views of one scholar that this interpretation
is " `simply frivolous.' " Ibid. (quoting Casto, The Federal
Courts' Protective Jurisdiction over Torts Committed in
Violation of the Law of Nations, 18 Conn. L. Rev. 467, 479,
480 (1986)).

These conclusions are alone enough to dispose of the present case in favor of petitioner Sosa. None of the exceptions
to the general rule against finding substantive lawmaking
power in a jurisdictional grant apply. Bivens provides perhaps the closest analogy. That is shaky authority at best,
but at least it can be said that Bivens sought to enforce a
command of our own law--the United States Constitution.
In modern international human rights litigation of the sort
that has proliferated since Filartiga v. Pena-Irala, 630 F. 2d
876 (CA2 1980), a federal court must first create the underlying federal command. But "the fact that a rule has been
recognized as [customary international law], by itself, is not
an adequate basis for viewing that rule as part of federal
common law." Meltzer, Customary International Law, Foreign Affairs, and Federal Common Law, 42 Va. J. Int'l L. 513,
519 (2002). In Benthamite terms, creating a federal command (federal common law) out of "international norms," and
then constructing a cause of action to enforce that command
through the purely jurisdictional grant of the ATS, is nonsense upon stilts.

Opinion of Scalia, J.

III
The analysis in the Court's opinion departs from my ownin this respect: After concluding in Part III that "the ATS

is a jurisdictional statute creating no new causes of action,"
ante, at 724, the Court addresses at length in Part IV the"good reasons for a restrained conception of the discretion a

federal court should exercise in considering a new cause ofaction" under the ATS. Ante, at 725 (emphasis added). By
framing the issue as one of "discretion," the Court skips overthe antecedent question of authority. This neglects the
"lesson of Erie," that "grants of jurisdiction alone" (whichthe Court has acknowledged the ATS to be) "are not themselves grants of lawmaking authority." Meltzer, supra, at541. On this point, the Court observes only that no development between the enactment of the ATS (in 1789) and thebirth of modern international human rights litigation under
that statute (in 1980) "has categorically precluded federalcourts from recognizing a claim under the law of nations as
an element of common law." Ante, at 725 (emphasis added).This turns our jurisprudence regarding federal common law
on its head. The question is not what case or congressionalaction

prevents federal courts from applying the law of na-tions as part of the general common law; it is what

author-izes that peculiar exception from Erie's fundamental holding

that a general common law does not exist.The Court would apparently find authorization in the understanding of the Congress that enacted the ATS, that "dis-trict courts would recognize private causes of action for certain torts in violation of the law of nations." Ante, at 724.But as discussed above, that understanding rested upon a
notion of general common law that has been repudiated byErie.

The Court recognizes that Erie was a "watershed" deci-sion heralding an avulsive change, wrought by "conceptual
development in understanding common law . . . [and accom-panied by an] equally significant rethinking of the role of
the federal courts in making it." Ante, at 726. The Court's

542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

745Cite as: 542 U. S. 692 (2004)
Opinion of Scalia, J.
analysis, however, does not follow through on this insight,interchangeably using the unadorned phrase "common law"

in Parts III and IV to refer to pre-Erie general commonlaw and postErie federal common law. This lapse is crucial,
because the creation of post-Erie federal common law isrooted in a positivist mindset utterly foreign to the American

common-law tradition of the late 18th century. Post-Erie
federal common lawmaking (all that is left to the federal
courts) is so far removed from that general-common-law adjudication which applied the "law of nations" that it would
be anachronistic to find authorization to do the former in a
statutory grant of jurisdiction that was thought to enable
the latter.* Yet that is precisely what the discretion-only
analysis in Part IV suggests.

*The Court conjures the illusion of common-law-making continuity between 1789 and the present by ignoring fundamental differences. The
Court's approach places the law of nations on a federal-law footing unknown to the First Congress. At the time of the ATS's enactment, the
law of nations, being part of general common law, was not supreme federal
law that could displace state law. Supra, at 739-740. By contrast, a judicially created federal rule based on international norms would be supreme
federal law. Moreover, a federal-common-law cause of action of the sort
the Court reserves discretion to create would "arise under" the laws of the
United States, not only for purposes of Article III but also for purposes of
statutory federal-question jurisdiction. See Illinois v. Milwaukee, 406
U. S. 91, 99-100 (1972).

The lack of genuine continuity is thus demonstrated by the fact that
today's opinion renders the ATS unnecessary for federal jurisdiction over
(so-called) law-of-nations claims. If the law of nations can be transformed
into federal law on the basis of (1) a provision that merely grants jurisdiction, combined with (2) some residual judicial power (from whence nobody
knows) to create federal causes of action in cases implicating foreign relations, then a grant of federal-question jurisdiction would give rise to a
power to create international-law-based federal common law just as effectively as would the ATS. This would mean that the ATS became largely
superfluous as of 1875, when Congress granted general federal-question
jurisdiction subject to a $500 amount-in-controversy requirement, Act of
Mar. 3, 1875, $ 1, 18 Stat. 470, and entirely superfluous as of 1980, when
Congress eliminated the amount-in-controversy requirement, Pub. L. 96-
486, 94 Stat. 2369.

746 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAIN

Opinion of Scalia, J.
Because today's federal common law is not our Framers'
general common law, the question presented by the suggestion of discretionary authority to enforce the law of nations
is not whether to extend old-school general-common-law adjudication. Rather, it is whether to create new federal common law. The Court masks the novelty of its approach when
it suggests that the difference between us is that I would
"close the door to further independent judicial recognition of
actionable international norms," whereas the Court would
permit the exercise of judicial power "on the understanding
that the door is still ajar subject to vigilant doorkeeping."
Ante, at 729. The general common law was the old door.
We do not close that door today, for the deed was done in
Erie. Supra, at 740-741. Federal common law is a new
door. The question is not whether that door will be left ajar,
but whether this Court will open it.

Although I fundamentally disagree with the discretionbased framework employed by the Court, we seem to be
in accord that creating a new federal common law of international human rights is a questionable enterprise. We
agree that:

A* "[T]he general practice has been to look for legislative

guidance before exercising innovative authority over
substantive law [in the area of foreign relations]. It
would be remarkable to take a more aggressive role in
exercising a jurisdiction that remained largely in shadow
for much of the prior two centuries." Ante, at 726.

A* "[T]he possible collateral consequences of making international rules privately actionable argue for judicial caution." Ante, at 727.

A* "It is one thing for American courts to enforce constitutional limits on our own State and Federal Governments'
power, but quite another to consider suits under rules
that would go so far as to claim a limit on the power of
foreign governments over their own citizens, and to hold

542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

747Cite as: 542 U. S. 692 (2004)
Opinion of Scalia, J.
that a foreign government or its agent has transgressedthose limits."

Ibid.

A* "[M]any attempts by federal courts to craft remedies forthe violation of new norms of international law would

raise risks of adverse foreign policy consequences. "
Ante, at 727-728.

A* "Several times, indeed, the Senate has expressly declinedto give the federal courts the task of interpreting and

applying international human rights law." Ante, at 728.
These considerations are not, as the Court thinks them, reasons why courts must be circumspect in use of their extantgeneral-common-law-making powers. They are reasons

why courts cannot possibly be thought to have been given,and should not be thought to possess, federal-common-lawmaking powers with regard to the creation of private federalcauses of action for violations of customary international law.

To be sure, today's opinion does not itself precipitate adirect confrontation with Congress by creating a cause of
action that Congress has not. But it invites precisely thataction by the lower courts, even while recognizing (1) that
Congress understood the difference between granting jurisdiction and creating a federal cause of action in 1789, ante,at 713, (2) that Congress understands that difference today,

ante, at 728, and (3) that the ATS itself supplies only juris-diction,

ante, at 724. In holding open the possibility that
judges may create rights where Congress has not authorizedthem to do so, the Court countenances judicial occupation of

a domain that belongs to the people's representatives. Onedoes not need a crystal ball to predict that this occupation
will not be long in coming, since the Court endorses the reasoning of "many of the courts and judges who faced the issue
before it reached this Court," including the Second and
Ninth Circuits. Ante, at 732.

The Ninth Circuit brought us the judgment that the Court
reverses today. Perhaps its decision in this particular case,

542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN
748 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAIN

Opinion of Scalia, J.
like the decisions of other lower federal courts that receivepassing attention in the Court's opinion, "reflects a more assertive view of federal judicial discretion over claims basedon customary international law than the position we take
today." Ante, at 736, n. 27. But the verbal formula it ap-plied is the same verbal formula that the Court explicitly
endorses. Compare ante, at 732 (quoting In re Estate of
Marcos Human Rights Litigation, 25 F. 3d 1467, 1475 (CA91994), for the proposition that actionable norms must be

" `specific, universal, and obligatory' "), with 331 F. 3d 604,621 (CA9 2003) (en banc) (finding the norm against arbitrary
arrest and detention in this action to be "universal, obligatory, and specific"); id., at 619 ("[A]n actionable claim under
the [ATS] requires the showing of a violation of the law of
nations that is specific, universal, and obligatory" (internal
quotation marks omitted)). Endorsing the very formula
that led the Ninth Circuit to its result in this action hardly
seems to be a recipe for restraint in the future.

The Second Circuit, which started the Judiciary down the
path the Court today tries to hedge in, is a good indicator of
where that path leads us: directly into confrontation with the
political branches. Kadic v. Karadz*ic', 70 F. 3d 232 (CA2
1995), provides a case in point. One of the norms at issue
in that case was a norm against genocide set forth in the
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime
of Genocide, Dec. 9, 1948, 78 U. N. T. S. 278. The Second
Circuit held that the norm was actionable under the ATS
after applying Circuit case law that the Court today endorses. 70 F. 3d, at 238-239, 241-242. The Court of Appeals then did something that is perfectly logical and yet
truly remarkable: It dismissed the determination by Congress and the Executive that this norm should not give rise
to a private cause of action. We know that Congress and
the Executive made this determination, because Congress
inscribed it into the Genocide Convention Implementation
Act of 1987, 18 U. S. C. $ 1091 et seq., a law signed by the

542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

749Cite as: 542 U. S. 692 (2004)
Opinion of Scalia, J.
President attaching criminal penalties to the norm againstgenocide. The Act, Congress said, shall not "be construed

as creating any substantive or procedural right enforceableby law by any party in any proceeding." $ 1092. Undeterred, the Second Circuit reasoned that this "decision notto create a

new private remedy" could hardly be construed
as repealing by implication the cause of action supplied by
the ATS. 70 F. 3d, at 242 (emphasis added). Does thisCourt truly wish to encourage the use of a jurisdictiongranting statute with respect to which there is "no record ofcongressional discussion about private actions that might be
subject to the jurisdictional provision, or about any need for
further legislation to create private remedies; [and] no record even of debate on the section," ante, at 718, to override
a clear indication from the political branches that a "specific,
universal, and obligatory" norm against genocide is not to be
enforced through a private damages action? Today's opinion leads the lower courts right down that perilous path.

Though it is not necessary to resolution of the present action, one further consideration deserves mention: Despite the
avulsive change of Erie, the Framers who included reference
to "the Law of Nations" in Article I, $ 8, cl. 10, of the Constitution would be entirely content with the post-Erie system
I have described, and quite terrified by the "discretion" endorsed by the Court. That portion of the general common
law known as the law of nations was understood to refer to
the accepted practices of nations in their dealings with one
another (treatment of ambassadors, immunity of foreign sovereigns from suit, etc.) and with actors on the high seas hostile to all nations and beyond all their territorial jurisdictions
(pirates). Those accepted practices have for the most part,
if not in their entirety, been enacted into United States statutory law, so that insofar as they are concerned the demise
of the general common law is inconsequential. The notion
that a law of nations, redefined to mean the consensus of
states on any subject, can be used by a private citizen to

control a sovereign's treatment of its own citizens within itsown territory is a 20th-century invention of internationalist

law professors and human rights advocates. See generallyBradley & Goldsmith, Critique of the Modern Position, 110
Harv. L. Rev., at 831-837. The Framers would, I am confi-dent, be appalled by the proposition that, for example, the
American peoples' democratic adoption of the death penalty,see,

e. g., Tex. Penal Code Ann. $ 12.31 (West 2003), couldbe judicially nullified because of the disapproving views of

foreigners. * * *

We Americans have a method for making the laws that areover us. We elect representatives to two Houses of Congress, each of which must enact the new law and present itfor the approval of a President, whom we also elect. For
over two decades now, unelected federal judges have beenusurping this lawmaking power by converting what they
regard as norms of international law into American law. To-day's opinion approves that process in principle, though urging the lower courts to be more restrained.This Court seems incapable of admitting that some matters--any matters--are none of its business. See, e. g.,Rasul v. Bush, ante, p. 466; INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289
(2001). In today's latest victory for its Never Say NeverJurisprudence, the Court ignores its own conclusion that the
ATS provides only jurisdiction, wags a finger at the lowercourts for going too far, and then--repeating the same formula the ambitious lower courts themselves have used--in-vites them to try again.

It would be bad enough if there were some assurance thatfuture conversions of perceived international norms into
American law would be approved by this Court itself.(Though we know ourselves to be eminently reasonable,
self-awareness of eminent reasonableness is not really a sub-stitute for democratic election.) But in this illegitimate lawmaking endeavor, the lower federal courts will be the princi542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

pal actors; we review but a tiny fraction of their decisions.And no one thinks that all of them are eminently reasonable.

American law--the law made by the people's democrati-cally elected representatives--does not recognize a category
of activity that is so universally disapproved by other nationsthat it is automatically unlawful here, and automatically
gives rise to a private action for money damages in federalcourt. That simple principle is what today's decision should
have announced.

I join in full the Court's disposition of Alvarez's claim pur-suant to 28 U. S. C. $ 1350. See

ante, at 712-738. As toAlvarez's Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA or Act) claim, see

ante, at 699-712, although I agree with the Court's resultand much of its reasoning, I take a different path and would
adopt a different construction of 28 U. S. C. $ 2680(k). Al-varez's case against the Government does not call for any
comparison of old versus newer choice-of-law methodologies.See

ante, at 708-710. See generally Kay, Theory into Prac-tice: Choice of Law in the Courts, 34 Mercer L. Rev. 521,

525-584 (1983). In particular, the Court's discussion of de-velopments in choice of law after the FTCA's enactment
hardly illuminates the meaning of that statute, and risks giv-ing undue prominence to a jurisdiction-selecting approach
the vast majority of States have long abandoned. See Sy-meonides, Choice of Law in the American Courts in 2002:

Congress included in the FTCA a series of exceptions to that
sovereign-immunity waiver. Relevant to this litigation, the
Act expressly excepts "[a]ny claim arising in a foreign country." $ 2680(k). I agree with the Court, see ante, at 699-
712, that this provision, the foreign-country exception, applies here, and bars Alvarez's tort claim against the United
States. But I would read the words "arising in," as they
appear in $ 2680(k), to signal "place where the act or omission
occurred," $ 1346(b)(1), not "place of injury," ante, at 707-708,
711, and n. 9.1

1 In common with $ 2680(k), most of the exceptions listed in $ 2680 use
the "claim arising" formulation. See $$ 2680(b), (c), (e), (h), (j), (l), (m),
and (n). Only two use the "act or omission" terminology. See $ 2680(a)
(exception for "[a]ny claim based upon an act or omission of an employee
of the Government, exercising due care, in the execution of a statute or
regulation . . . or based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to
exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty . . ."); $ 2680(e) (no
liability for "[a]ny claim arising out of an act or omission of any employee
of the Government in administering [certain provisions concerning war
and national defense]"). It is hardly apparent, however, that Congress
intended only $$ 2680(a) and (e) to be interpreted in accord with $ 1346(b).
Congress used the phrase "arising out of" for $ 2680 exceptions that focus
on a governmental act or omission. See $ 2680(b) (exception for "[a]ny
claim arising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter"); $ 2680(h) (no liability for "[a]ny claim arising out
of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution,
abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference
with contractual rights"). Given that usage, and in light of the legislative

On its face, the foreign-country exception appears to cover
this litigation. See ante, at 700. Alvarez's suit is predicated on an arrest in Mexico alleged to be "false" only because it occurred there. Sosa's conduct in Mexico, implicating questions of Mexican law, is, as the Court notes, "the
kernel" of Alvarez's claim. Ante, at 701. Once Alvarez was
inside United States borders, the Ninth Circuit observed, no
activity regarding his detention was tortious. See 331 F. 3d
604, 636-637 (2003). Government liability to Alvarez, as analyzed by the Court of Appeals, rested solely upon a falsearrest claim. Id., at 640-641. Just as Alvarez's arrest was
"false," and thus tortious, only because, and only to the extent that, it took place and endured in Mexico, so damages
accrued only while the alleged wrongful conduct continued
abroad. Id., at 636-637.

Critical in the Ninth Circuit's view, "DEA agents had no
authority under federal law to execute an extraterritorial
arrest of a suspect indicted in federal court in Los Angeles."
Id., at 640; see ante, at 700-701, n. 1. See also Fermino v.
Fedco, Inc., 7 Cal. 4th 701, 715, 872 P. 2d 559, 567 (1994)

the least complex statutory language feasible. Cf. Sami v. United States,

specific reference to acts or omissions in $ 2680(k) was meaningful or that
the focus of that exemption shifted from acts or omissions to resultant
injuries.").

tion a supervening prosecutorial mechanism which met all ofthe procedural requisites of federal due process." 331 F. 3d,

at 637; see ante, at 700-701, n. 1.Accepting, as the Ninth Circuit did, that no tortious act
occurred once Alvarez was within United States borders, theGovernment's liability on Alvarez's claim for false arrest necessarily depended on the foreign location of the arrest andimplicated foreign law. While the Court of Appeals focused
on whether United States law furnished authority to seizeAlvarez in Mexican territory, see 331 F. 3d, at 626-631, Mexican law equally could have provided--or denied--authorityfor such an arrest. Had Sosa and the arrest team been Mexican law enforcement officers, authorized by Mexican law toarrest Alvarez and to hand him over to United States authorities, for example, no false-arrest claim would have been ten-able. Similarly, there would have been no viable falsearrest claim if Mexican law authorized a citizen's arrest inthe circumstances presented here. Indeed, Mexican and
Honduran agents seized other suspects indicted along withAlvarez, respectively in Mexico and Honduras; "Alvarez's abduction was unique in that it involved neither the coopera-tion of local police nor the consent of a foreign government."
Id., at 623, n. 23.The interpretation of the FTCA adopted by the Ninth Circuit, in short, yielded liability based on acts occurring inMexico that entangled questions of foreign law. Subjecting
the United States to liability depending upon the law of aforeign sovereign, however, was the very result $ 2680(k)'s
foreign-country exception aimed to exclude. See UnitedStates v. Spelar, 338 U. S. 217, 221 (1949).

id., at
46 ("the foreign country exception must be viewed togetherwith [$ ]1346," which points to "the law of the place where

the [allegedly wrongful] act or omission occurred" (inter-nal quotation marks and citations omitted and emphasis
deleted)).

Interpretation of $ 2680(k) in the light of $ 1346, as theGovernment maintains, is grounded in this Court's precedent. In construing $ 2680(k)'s reference to a "foreign coun-try," this Court has "draw[n] support from the language of

$ 1346(b), the principal provision of the [FTCA]." Smith v.
United States, 507 U. S. 197, 201 (1993) (internal quotation
marks omitted). In Smith, the Court held that a wrongfuldeath action "based exclusively on acts or omissions occurring in Antarctica" was barred by the foreign-country exception. Id., at 198-199. Were it not, the Court noted,
"$ 1346(b) would instruct courts to look to the law of a place
that has no law [i. e., Antarctica] in order to determine the
liability of the United States--surely a bizarre result." Id.,
at 201-202. Thus, in Smith, the Court presumed that the
place "where the act or omission occurred" for purposes of
the sovereign-immunity waiver, $ 1346(b)(1), coincided with
the place where the "claim ar[ose]" for purposes of the
foreign-country exception, $ 2680(k). See also Beattie v.
United States, 756 F. 2d 91, 122 (CADC 1984) (Scalia, J., dissenting) ("[A] claim `arises' for purposes of $ 2680(k) where
there occurs the alleged [standard-of-care] violation . . . (attributable to government action or inaction) nearest to the
injury . . . ."); Sami v. United States, 617 F. 2d 755, 761-762
(CADC 1979) (looking to where "the act or omission complained of occurred" in applying $ 2680(k)).

Harmonious construction of $$ 1346(b) and 2680(k) accords
with Congress' intent in enacting the foreign-country exception. Congress was "unwilling to subject the United States
to liabilities depending upon the laws of a foreign power."

756 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAIN

Opinion of Ginsburg, J.
Spelar, 338 U. S., at 221. The legislative history of theFTCA suggests that Congress viewed cases in which the

relevant act or omission occurred in a foreign country asentailing too great a risk of foreign-law application. Thus,
Assistant Attorney General Francis M. Shea, in explainingthe finally enacted version of the foreign-country exception
to the House Committee on the Judiciary, emphasized that,when an

act or omission occurred in a foreign country,$ 1346(b) would direct a court toward the law of that country:

"Since liability is to be determined by the law of the situs ofthe wrongful act or omission it is wise to restrict the bill to
claims arising in this country." Hearings on H. R. 5373et al. before the House Committee on the Judiciary, 77th
Cong., 2d Sess., 35 (1942) (emphasis added); see ante, at 707.2In the enacting Congress' view, it thus appears, $$ 1346(b)
and 2680(k) were aligned so as to block the United States'waiver of sovereign immunity when the relevant act or omission took place overseas. See supra, at 752-753, n. 1.

True, the Court has read renvoi into $ 1346(b)(1)'s words"in accordance with the law of." See

Richards v. United
States, 369 U. S. 1, 11 (1962) ("the [FTCA] . . . requires appli-cation of the

whole law of the State where the act or omission
occurred" (emphasis added)).3 That, however, is no reasonto resist defining the place where a claim arises for $ 2680(k)

purposes to mean the place where the liability-creating act

2 The foreign-country exception's focus on the location of the tortious act
or omission is borne out by a further colloquy during the hearing before
the House Committee on the Judiciary. A member of that Committee
asked whether he understood correctly that "any representative of the
United States who committed a tort in England or some other country
could not be reached under [the FTCA]." Hearings on H. R. 5373 et al.,
at 35 (emphasis added). Assistant Attorney General Shea said yes to that
understanding of $ 2680(k). Ibid.

3 Renvoi is "[t]he doctrine under which a court in resorting to foreign

law adopts as well the foreign law's conflict-of-laws principles, which may
in turn refer the court back to the law of the forum." Black's Law Dictionary 1300 (7th ed. 1999).

or omission occurred, with no renvoi elsewhere. It is one
thing to apply renvoi to determine which State, within the
United States, supplies the governing law, quite another to
suppose that Congress meant United States courts to explore what choice of law a foreign court would make.4

In 1948, when the FTCA was enacted, it is also true, Congress reasonably might have anticipated that the then
prevailing choice-of-law methodology, reflected in the Restatement (First) of Conflicts, would lead mechanically to the
law of the place of injury. See Restatement (First) of Conflicts $ 377 (1934) ("The place of wrong is in the state where
the last event necessary to make an actor liable for an alleged tort takes place."); Richards, 369 U. S., at 11-12 ("The
general conflict-of-laws rule, followed by a vast majority of
the States, [wa]s to apply the law of the place of injury to
the substantive rights of the parties." (footnote omitted));
ante, at 705-707, 708, n. 5 (same). Generally, albeit not always, the place where the negligent or intentional act or
omission takes place coincides with the place of injury.5
Looking to the whole law of the State where the wrongful
"act or omission occurred" would therefore ordinarily lead to
application of that State's own law. But cf. ante, at 707-708,
711-712 (adopting a place-of-injury rule for $ 2680(k)).

4 Reading renvoi into $ 1346(b)(1), even to determine which State supplies the governing law, moreover, is questionable. See Shapiro, Choice
of Law Under the Federal Tort Claims Act: Richards and Renvoi Revisited, 70 N. C. L. Rev. 641, 679 (1992) ("It is only fair that federal liability
be determined by the law where the federal employee's negligence took
place, as Congress intended. The simplicity of the internal law approach
is preferable to the complexity and opportunity for manipulation of [Richards'] whole law construction.").

5 Enacting the FTCA, Congress was concerned with quotidian "wrongs

which would have been actionable if inflicted by an individual or a corporation," Feres v. United States, 340 U. S. 135, 139-140 (1950), such as vehicular accidents, see S. Rep. No. 1400, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 31 (1946). See
also ante, at 706, n. 4. The place of injury in such torts almost inevitably
would be the place the act or omission occurred as well.

758 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAIN

Opinion of Ginsburg, J.

II
The Ninth Circuit concluded that the foreign-country ex-ception did not bar Alvarez's false-arrest claim because that

claim "involve[d] federal employees working from offices inthe United States to guide and supervise actions in other
countries." 331 F. 3d, at 638. In so holding, the Courtof Appeals applied a " `headquarters doctrine,' " whereby
"a claim can still proceed . . . if harm occurring in a for-eign country was proximately caused by acts in the United
States." Ibid.There is good reason to resist the headquarters doctrine
described and relied upon by the Ninth Circuit. The Courtof Appeals' employment of that doctrine renders the FTCA's
foreign-country exception inapplicable whenever some au-thorization, support, or planning takes place in the United
States. But "it will virtually always be possible to assertthat the negligent [or intentional] activity that injured the
plaintiff was the consequence of faulty training, selection orsupervision--or even less than that, lack of careful training,
selection or supervision--in the United States." Beattie,756 F. 2d, at 119 (Scalia, J., dissenting); see ante, at 702-703
(same). Hence the headquarters doctrine, which considerswhether steps toward the commission of the tort occurred
within the United States, risks swallowing up the foreign-country exception.

Furthermore, the Court of Appeals failed to address thechoice-of-law question implicated by both $$ 1346(b) and
2680(k) whenever tortious acts are committed in multiplestates. Both those provisions direct federal courts "in
multistate tort actions, to look in the first instance to the lawof the place where the acts of negligence [or the intentional
tort] took place." Richards, 369 U. S., at 10. In cases in-volving acts or omissions in several states, the question is
which acts count. "Neither the text of the FTCA nor Richards provides any guidance . . . when the alleged acts oromissions occur in more than one state. Moreover, the leg542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

islative history of the FTCA sheds no light on this problem."
Gould Electronics Inc. v. United States, 220 F. 3d 169, 181
(CA3 2000); see Raflo v. United States, 157 F. Supp. 2d 1, 9
(DC 2001) (same).

Courts of appeals have adopted varying approaches to this
question. See Simon v. United States, 341 F. 3d 193, 202
(CA3 2003) (listing five different choice-of-law methodologies
for $ 1346(b)(1)); Gould Electronics, 220 F. 3d, at 181-183
(same).6 Having canvassed those different approaches,
Third Circuit Judge Becker concluded that "clarity is the
most important virtue in crafting a rule by which [a federal
court would] choose a jurisdiction." Simon, 341 F. 3d, at
204. Eschewing "vague and overlapping" approaches that
yielded "indeterminate" results, Judge Becker "appl[ied]
[under $ 1346(b)(1)] the choice-of-law regime of the jurisdiction in which the last significant act or omission occurred.
This has the salutary effect of avoiding the selection of a
jurisdiction based on a completely incidental `last contact,'

6 As cataloged by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, these are:
"(1) applying different rules to different theories of liability; (2) choosing
the place of the last allegedly-wrongful act or omission; (3) determining
which asserted act of wrongdoing had the most significant effect on the
injury; (4) choosing the state in which the United States' physical actions
could have prevented injury; and (5) determining where the `relevant' act
or omission occurred." Simon, 341 F. 3d, at 202. For cases applying and
discussing one or another of those five approaches, see Ducey v. United
States, 713 F. 2d 504, 508, n. 2 (CA9 1983) (considering where "physical
acts" that could have prevented the harm would have occurred); Hitchcock
v. United States, 665 F. 2d 354, 359 (CADC 1981) (looking for the "relevant" act or omission); Bowen v. United States, 570 F. 2d 1311, 1318 (CA7
1978) (noting "the alternatives of the place of the last act or omission
having a causal effect, or the place of the act or omission having the most
significant causal effect," but finding that both rules would lead to the
same place); Raflo v. United States, 157 F. Supp. 2d 1, 10 (DC 2001) (applying Hitchcock's relevance test by looking for the place where the "most
substantial portion of the acts or omissions occurred"); Kohn v. United
States, 591 F. Supp. 568, 572 (EDNY 1984) (applying different States'
choice-of-law rules on an act-by-act basis).

while also avoiding the conjecture that [alternative] inquiresoften entail."

Ibid. I agree.
A "last significant act or omission" rule applied under$ 2680(k) would close the door to the headquarters doctrine

as applied by the Ninth Circuit in this litigation. By direct-ing attention to the place where the last significant act or
omission occurred, rather than to a United States location
where some authorization, support, or planning may havetaken place, the clear rule advanced by Judge Becker preserves $ 2680(k) as the genuine limitation Congress intendedit to be.

The "last significant act or omission" rule works in thislitigation to identify Mexico, not California, as the place
where the instant controversy arose. I would apply that
rule here to hold that Alvarez's tort claim for false arrest under the FTCA is barred under the foreign-country
exception.

Accordingly, I concur in the Court's judgment and concur
in Parts I, III, and IV of its opinion.

Justice Breyer, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.

I join Justice Ginsburg 's concurrence and join the
Court's opinion in respect to the Alien Tort Statute (ATS)
claim. The Court says that to qualify for recognition under
the ATS a norm of international law must have a content as
definite as, and an acceptance as widespread as, those that
characterized 18th-century international norms prohibiting
piracy. Ante, at 732. The norm must extend liability to the
type of perpetrator (e. g., a private actor) the plaintiff seeks
to sue. Ante, at 732, n. 20. And Congress can make clear
that courts should not recognize any such norm, through a
direct or indirect command or by occupying the field. See
ante, at 731. The Court also suggests that principles of exhaustion might apply, and that courts should give "serious
weight" to the Executive Branch's view of the impact on for542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

761Cite as: 542 U. S. 692 (2004)
Opinion of Breyer, J.
eign policy that permitting an ATS suit will likely have in agiven case or type of case.

Ante, at 733, n. 21. I believe
all of these conditions are important.I would add one further consideration. Since enforcement

of an international norm by one nation's courts implies thatother nations' courts may do the same, I would ask whether
the exercise of jurisdiction under the ATS is consistent with
those notions of comity that lead each nation to respect thesovereign rights of other nations by limiting the reach of its

laws and their enforcement. In applying those principles,courts help ensure that "the potentially conflicting laws of
different nations" will "work together in harmony," a matter
of increasing importance in an ever more interdependent
world. F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd v. Empagran S. A.,
ante, at 164; cf. Murray v. Schooner Charming Betsy, 2
Cranch 64, 118 (1804). Such consideration is necessary to
ensure that ATS litigation does not undermine the very harmony that it was intended to promote. See ante, at 715-718.

These comity concerns normally do not arise (or at least
are mitigated) if the conduct in question takes place in the
country that provides the cause of action or if that conduct
involves that country's own national--where, say, an American assaults a foreign diplomat and the diplomat brings suit
in an American court. See Restatement (Third) of Foreign
Relations Law of the United States $$ 402(1), (2) (1986)
(hereinafter Restatement) (describing traditional bases of
territorial and nationality jurisdiction). They do arise, however, when foreign persons injured abroad bring suit in the
United States under the ATS, asking the courts to recognize
a claim that a certain kind of foreign conduct violates an
international norm.

Since different courts in different nations will not necessarily apply even similar substantive laws similarly, workable harmony, in practice, depends upon more than substantive uniformity among the laws of those nations. That is to
say, substantive uniformity does not automatically mean

542US2 Unit: $U80 [11-02-06 13:35:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN
762 SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAIN

Opinion of Breyer, J.
that universal jurisdiction is appropriate. Thus, in the 18thcentury, nations reached consensus not only on the substantive principle that acts of piracy were universally wrong butalso on the jurisdictional principle that any nation that found
a pirate could prosecute him. See, e. g., United States v.
Smith, 5 Wheat. 153, 162 (1820) (referring to "the general
practice of all nations in punishing all persons, whether natives or foreigners, who have committed [piracy] against anypersons whatsoever, with whom they are in amity").

Today international law will sometimes similarly reflectnot only substantive agreement as to certain universally condemned behavior but also procedural agreement that universal jurisdiction exists to prosecute a subset of that behavior.
See Restatement $ 404, and Comment a; International Law
Association, Final Report on the Exercise of Universal Jurisdiction in Respect of Gross Human Rights Offences 2 (2000).
That subset includes torture, genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. See id., at 5-8; see also, e. g.,
Prosecutor v. Furundzija, Case No. IT-95-17/1-T, |||| 155-
156 (International Tribunal for Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in Territory of Former Yugoslavia Since
1991, Dec. 10, 1998); Attorney Gen. of Israel v. Eichmann,
36 I. L. R. 277 (Sup. Ct. Israel 1962).

The fact that this procedural consensus exists suggests
that recognition of universal jurisdiction in respect to a limited set of norms is consistent with principles of international
comity. That is, allowing every nation's courts to adjudicate
foreign conduct involving foreign parties in such cases will
not significantly threaten the practical harmony that comity
principles seek to protect. That consensus concerns criminal jurisdiction, but consensus as to universal criminal jurisdiction itself suggests that universal tort jurisdiction would
be no more threatening. Cf. Restatement $ 404, Comment
b. That is because the criminal courts of many nations combine civil and criminal proceedings, allowing those injured

by criminal conduct to be represented, and to recover dam-ages, in the criminal proceeding itself. Brief for European

Commission as Amicus Curiae 21, n. 48 (citing 3 Y. Donzal-laz, La Convention de Lugano du 16 septembre 1988 concernant la compe' tence judiciaire et l'exe' cution des de' cisions enmatie` re civile et commerciale, |||| 5203-5272 (1998); EC
Council Regulation Art. 5, $ 4, No. 44/2001, 2001 O. J. (L 12/1) (Jan. 16, 2001)). Thus, universal criminal jurisdiction necessarily contemplates a significant degree of civil tort recov-ery as well.

Taking these matters into account, as I believe courtsshould, I can find no similar procedural consensus supporting
the exercise of jurisdiction in these cases. That lack of con-sensus provides additional support for the Court's conclusion
that the ATS does not recognize the claim at issue here--where the underlying substantive claim concerns arbitrary
arrest, outside the United States, of a citizen of one foreigncountry by another.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Breyer joins,concurring.

Today we affirm the District Court's judgment that Georgia'slegislative reapportionment plans for the State House of Representatives and Senate violate the one-person, one-vote principleof the Equal Protection Clause. The District Court's findings
disclose two reasons for the unconstitutional population deviationsin the state legislative reapportionment plans. The first was
"a deliberate and systematic policy of favoring rural and inner-city interests at the expense of suburban areas north, east, and
west of Atlanta." 300 F. Supp. 2d 1320, 1327 (ND Ga. 2004). Thesecond was "an intentional effort to allow incumbent Democrats to
maintain or increase their delegation, primarily by systematicallyunderpopulating the districts held by incumbent Democrats, by
overpopulating those of Republicans, and by deliberately pairingnumerous Republican incumbents against one another." Id., at
1329. The court found that Democratic incumbents "attemptedto draw districts that would enhance their own prospects at re542ORD Unit: $PT2 [10-05-06 14:20:26] PGT: ORDBV (Bound Volume)

election and further their other political ends (such as building upa support base for a future run for Congress)" and also "targeted
particular Republicans to prevent their re-election." Id., at 1330.As a result,

"[w]hile Democratic incumbents who supported the planswere generally protected, Republican incumbents were regularly pitted against one another in an obviously purposefulattempt to unseat as many of them as possible. In the House
Plan, forty-seven incumbents were paired, including thirty-seven Republicans, which was 50% of the Republican caucus,
but only nine Democrats, comprising less than 9% of thatcaucus (as well as one Independent). Because six of the
twenty-one districts involved were multi-member districts,the end result was that a maximum of twenty-eight of the
paired incumbents could be re-elected, and the remainingnineteen would be unseated. Similarly, the 2002 Senate Plan
included six incumbent pairings: four Republican-Republicanpairings and two Republican-Democrat pairings. In the 2002
general election, eighteen Republican incumbents in theHouse and four Republican incumbents in the Senate lost
their seats due to the pairings, while only three Democraticincumbents in the House and no Democratic incumbents in
the Senate lost seats this way." Id., at 1329-1330 (citationsand footnote omitted).

Although "[t]he numbers largely speak for themselves," the Dis-trict Court found that the shapes of many of the newly created
districts supplied further evidence that the plans' drafters "in-ten[ded] not only to aid Democratic incumbents in getting reelected but also to oust many of their Republican incumbent coun-terparts." Id., at 1330. The court noted, for example, that a
Republican senator had been "drawn into a district with a Demo-cratic incumbent who ultimately won the 2002 general election,
while an open district was drawn within two blocks of her resi-dence," that two of the most senior Republican senators had been
drawn into the same district, and that a Republican House mem-ber "who was generally disliked by several of the Democratic
incumbent[s] was paired with another representative in an at-tempt to unseat him." Ibid. Moreover, many of the districts
that paired Republicans were both oddly shaped and overpopu-lated, "suggesting that the districts were drawn to force Republi542ORD Unit: $PT2 [10-05-06 14:20:26] PGT: ORDBV (Bound Volume)

can incumbents to run against each other and to draw in as manyRepublican voters as possible in the process." Ibid.

The drafters' efforts at selective incumbent protection "led toa significant overall partisan advantage for Democrats in the electoral maps," with "Republican-leaning districts . . . vastly moreoverpopulated as a whole than Democratic-leaning districts," and
with many of the large positive population deviations in districtsthat paired Republican incumbents against each other. Id., at
1331. The District Court found that the population deviationsdid not result from any attempt to create districts that were
compact or contiguous, or to keep counties whole, or to preservethe cores of prior districts. Id., at 1331-1334. Rather, the court
concluded, "the population deviations were designed to allowDemocrats to maintain or increase their representation in the
House and Senate through the underpopulation of districts inDemocratic-leaning rural and inner-city areas of the state and
through the protection of Democratic incumbents and the impair-ment of the Republican incumbents' reelection prospects." Id.,
at 1334. The District Court correctly held that the drafters' de-sire to give an electoral advantage to certain regions of the State
and to certain incumbents (but not incumbents as such) did notjustify the conceded deviations from the principle of one person,
one vote. See Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 565-566 (1964)(regionalism is an impermissible basis for population deviations);
Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U. S. 735, 754 (1973) ("[M]ultimemberdistricts may be vulnerabl[e] if racial or political groups have
been fenced out of the political process and their voting strengthinvidiously minimized"). See also Reynolds, 377 U. S., at 579 (explaining that the "overriding objective" of districting "must besubstantial equality of population among the various districts"
and that deviations from the equal-population principle are per-missible only if "incident to the effectuation of a rational state
policy").In challenging the District Court's judgment, appellant invites
us to weaken the one-person, one-vote standard by creating a safeharbor for population deviations of less than 10 percent, within
which districting decisions could be made for any reason whatso-ever. The Court properly rejects that invitation. After our recent decision in Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U. S. 267 (2004), the equal-population principle remains the only clear limitation on improper
districting practices, and we must be careful not to dilute its

Stevens, J., concurring 542 U. S.
strength. It bears emphasis, however, that had the Court inVieth adopted a standard for adjudicating partisan gerrymandering claims, the standard likely would have been satisfied in thiscase. Appellees alleged that the House and Senate plans were
the result of an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. The Dis-trict Court rejected that claim because it considered itself bound
by the plurality opinion in Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109(1986), and appellees could not show that they had been " `essentially shut out of the political process.' " App. to Juris. Statement86a (quoting Bandemer, 478 U. S., at 139). Appellees do not challenge that ruling, and it is not before us. But the District Court'sdetailed factual findings regarding appellees' equal protection
claim confirm that an impermissible partisan gerrymander is visi-ble to the judicial eye and subject to judicially manageable standards. Indeed, the District Court's findings make clear that appel-lees could satisfy either the standard endorsed by the Court in its
racial gerrymandering cases or that advocated in Justice Powell'sdissent in Bandemer, 478 U. S., at 173-185.*

Drawing district lines that have no neutral justification in orderto place two incumbents of the opposite party in the same district
is probative of the same impermissible intent as the "uncouthtwenty-eight-sided figure" that defined the boundary of Tuskegee,
Alabama, in Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339, 340 (1960),or the "dragon descending on Philadelphia from the west" that
defined Pennsylvania's District 6 in Vieth, 541 U. S., at 340(Stevens, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted).
The record in this case, like the allegations in Gomillion and inVieth, reinforce my conclusion that "the unavailability of judicially

elections/election_results/2002_1105/senate.htm (as visited June 23, 2004, andavailable in Clerk of Court's case file). Thus, it appears that appellees also
could state a partisan gerrymandering claim under Justice Breyer's indiciaof unjustified entrenchment. See Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U. S. 267, 366 (2004)
(dissenting opinion) ("[a] the boundary-drawing criteria depart radically fromprevious or traditional criteria; [b] the departure cannot be justified or explained other than by reference to an effort to obtain partisan political ad-vantage; and [c] a majority party [i. e., party receiving majority of total

manageable standards" cannot justify a refusal "to condemn eventhe most blatant violations of a state legislature's fundamental
duty to govern impartially." Vieth, 541 U. S., at 341. I remainconvinced that in time the present "failure of judicial will," ibid.,
will be replaced by stern condemnation of partisan gerryman-dering that does not even pretend to be justified by neutral
principles.

Justice Scalia, dissenting.
When reviewing States' redistricting of their own legislativeboundaries, we have been appropriately deferential. See Mahan

v. Howell, 410 U. S. 315, 327 (1973). A series of our cases estab-lished the principle that "minor deviations" among districts--deviations of less than 10%--are " `insufficient to make out a primafacie case of invidious discrimination under the Fourteenth
Amendment so as to require justification by the State.' " Brownv. Thomson, 462 U. S. 835, 842 (1983) (quoting Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U. S. 735, 745 (1973)); see also Voinovich v. Quil-ter, 507 U. S. 146, 160-162 (1993). This case presents a question
that Brown, Gaffney, and Voinovich did not squarely confront--whether a districting plan that satisfies this 10% criterion may
nevertheless be invalidated on the basis of circumstantial evidenceof partisan political motivation.

The state officials who drafted Georgia's redistricting plan be-lieved the answer to that question was "no," reading our cases to
establish a 10% "safe harbor" with which they meticulously com-plied. The court below disagreed. No party here contends that,
beyond grand generalities in cases such as Reynolds v. Sims, 377U. S. 533, 577 (1964), this Court has addressed the question. The
opinion below is consistent with others to have addressed theissue; there is no obvious conflict among the lower courts. This
is not a petition for certiorari, however, but an appeal, and weshould not summarily affirm unless it is clear that the disposition
of this case is correct.In my view, that is not clear. A substantial case can be made
that Georgia's redistricting plan did comply with the Constitution.Appellees do not contend that the population deviations--all less
than 5% from the mean--were based on race or some othersuspect classification. They claim only impermissible political
bias--that state legislators tried to improve the electoral chancesof Democrats over Republicans by underpopulating inner-city and

rural districts and by selectively protecting incumbents, whileignoring "traditional" redistricting criteria. The District Court
agreed. See App. to Juris. Statement 8a-25a.The problem with this analysis is that it assumes "politics as
usual" is not itself a "traditional" redistricting criterion. In therecent decision in Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U. S. 267 (2004), all but
one of the Justices agreed that it is a traditional criterion, and aconstitutional one, so long as it does not go too far. See id., at
285-286 (plurality opinion); id., at 307 (Kennedy, J., concurringin judgment); id., at 344 (Souter, J., dissenting); id., at 355
(Breyer, J., dissenting). It is not obvious to me that a legisla-ture goes too far when it stays within the 10% disparity in population our cases allow. To say that it does is to invite allegationsof political motivation whenever there is population disparity, and
thus to destroy the 10% safe harbor our cases provide. Ferretingout political motives in minute population deviations seems to me
more likely to encourage politically motivated litigation than tovindicate political rights.

I would set the case for argument.

ASSOCIATED PRESS et al. v. DISTRICT COURT FOR

THE FIFTH JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF COLORADO

on application for stay
No. 04A73. Decided July 26, 2004
An application to stay orders of a Colorado trial court and the Colorado

Supreme Court restricting publication of transcripts of in camera pretrial proceedings in a sexual assault prosecution held to determine the
relevance and admissibility of certain evidence pursuant to Colorado's
rape shield law is denied without prejudice to its being filed again subsequent to July 28, 2004. After applicants, newspaper publishers and
media outlets, were mistakenly e-mailed the transcripts, the trial court
prohibited their publication and required their deletion from the applicants' computers. The applicants challenged the order before the State
Supreme Court, which agreed that it was a prior restraint on speech,
but found that a more narrowly tailored order would pass constitutional
muster. After this application was filed, the state trial court found
some of the evidence admissible under the state statute, but has not
determined whether the transcripts at issue should be made public.
The trial court's determination as to the rape shield material's relevancy
will significantly change the circumstances leading to this application.
That court may decide to release the transcripts in their entirety or in
part. Release may be imminent. Though the constitutional interests
are important, a brief delay will permit the state courts to clarify, perhaps avoid, the controversy at issue.

Justice Breyer, Circuit Justice.
This is an application for a stay of orders of the Colorado
State District Court for Eagle County and the Supreme
Court of Colorado restricting publication of the contents of
transcripts of in camera pretrial proceedings held in a criminal prosecution for sexual assault. The applicants are several major newspaper publishers and media outlets that have

Opinion in Chambers

been covering the prosecution. They filed their applicationin this Court on July 21, 2004. Due to a change in circumstances following the submission of their application, I denythe application without prejudice to its being filed again in
two days' time (or thereafter), i. e., subsequent to July 28,2004.

At issue are the transcripts of trial court hearings, held
in camera on June 21 and June 22, 2004, to determine therelevance and admissibility of certain evidence pursuant to

Colorado's rape shield statute, Colo. Rev. Stat. $ 18-3-407(2)(Lexis 2003). The transcripts were mistakenly e-mailed to
the applicants by a court reporter of the trial court. Uponrealizing its mistake, the trial court issued an order prohibiting publication of the contents of the transcripts and re-quiring their deletion from the applicants' computers. See
Order in People v. Bryant, No. 03-CR-204 (Dist. Ct., EagleCty., June 24, 2004). The applicants challenged the order
before the Colorado Supreme Court, which agreed with themthat the order imposed a prior restraint on speech, but concluded that a more narrowly tailored version of the orderwould pass constitutional muster. See

People v. Bryant, 94P. 3d 624 (2004).

Accordingly, the Colorado Supreme Court ordered thetrial court to:

"(1) make its rape shield rulings as expeditiously as pos-sible and promptly enter its findings of facts and conclusions of law thereon; (2) determine if some or all por-tions of the June 21 and June 22 transcripts are relevant
and material and, therefore, admissible under the rapeshield statute at trial; and (3) enter an appropriate
order, which may include releasing to the [applicants]and the public a redacted version of the June 21 and
June 22 transcripts that contains those portions that arerelevant and material in the case, if any, and maintains
the ongoing confidentiality of portions that are irrele-vant and immaterial, if any."

Id., at 626-627.

1303Cite as: 542 U. S. 1301 (2004)
Opinion in Chambers
In evaluating the validity of the prior restraint, the Colo-rado Supreme Court made clear that the government's "interest of the highest order" in preventing publication appliedonly to those portions of "the

in camera transcripts that are
not relevant and material under the rape shield statute."
Id., at 626. Two days after the Colorado Supreme Court
issued its opinion, the applicants submitted their application
for a stay of the trial court's and the Colorado SupremeCourt's orders, directing it to me as Circuit Justice.

On July 23, the same day that responses to the applicationwere filed in this Court, the Colorado trial court issued its
ruling on the admissibility of evidence under the Coloradorape shield statute. See Order re: Defendant's Motion to
Admit Evidence Pursuant to C. R. S. $ 18-3-407 and Peo-ple's Motions

in Limine #5 and #7 in People v. Bryant,
No. 03-CR-204 (Dist. Ct., Eagle Cty., July 23, 2004). Ac-cording to this ruling (which affects all of the hearings held

in camera pursuant to the rape shield statute, not just thoseat issue in this application) the trial court

"determines that certain evidence . . . is relevant to amaterial issue(s) in this case . . . and will permit the
evidence to be offered at the trial of this matter. TheCourt determines that certain other evidence . . . is not
relevant to any material issue in this case, and therefore
may not be offered at the trial of this matter, unlesscircumstances later warrant."

Id., at 5-6.

The ruling goes on to specify the evidence that is relevant
and material. To my knowledge, the trial court has not yetmade its determination as to whether the transcripts of June

21 and 22, in whole or in part, shall be made public.

My reading of the transcripts leads me to believe that the
trial court's determination as to the relevancy of the rape
shield material will significantly change the circumstances
that have led to this application. As a result of that determination, the trial court may decide to release the tran542US2IC1Q 10-26-06 09:12:55 PAGES IC1301PGT
1304 ASSOCIATED PRESS v. DISTRICT COURT FOR

FIFTH JUDICIAL DIST. OF COLO.

Opinion in Chambers

scripts at issue here in their entirety, or to release some por-tions while redacting others. Their release, I believe, is

imminent. I recognize the importance of the constitutionalinterests at issue. See, e. g., Capital Cities Media, Inc. v.
Toole, 463 U. S. 1303, 1304 (1983) (Brennan, J., in chambers);Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart, 423 U. S. 1327, 1329 (1975)
(Blackmun, J., in chambers). But a brief delay will permitthe state courts to clarify, perhaps avoid, the controversy at
issue here. See Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart, 423 U. S.1319, 1325 (1975) (same).

Consequently, the application is denied without prejudiceto the applicants' filing again in two days' time. Should they
do so, the respondent shall file a response one day subse-quent indicating: (1) (if the trial court has acted) why any
redacted portions of the transcripts must remain confiden-tial; or (2) (if the trial court has not acted) which portions of
the transcripts it believes, in light of the trial court's admissi-bility determinations, should remain confidential and why.
The applicants shall file their reply, if they wish to file one,one further day later.

The application is denied without prejudice.

Opinion in Chambers

WISCONSIN RIGHT TO LIFE, INC. v. FEDERAL

ELECTION COMMISSION

on application for injunction
No. 04A194. Decided September 14, 2004
Applicant's request for an injunction pending appeal barring the enforcement of $ 203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA)
is denied. Applicant contends that $ 203--which bans corporations
from using general treasury funds to finance certain electioneering communications--violates the First Amendment as applied to its political
advertisements. An injunction pending appeal would be an extraordinary remedy, particularly when this Court recently held BCRA facially
constitutional, McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n, 540 U. S. 93,
189-210, and when a three-judge District Court unanimously rejected
applicant's request for a preliminary injunction. The All Writs Act, the
only source of this Court's authority to issue the instant injunction, is
to be used " ` "sparingly and only in the most critical and exigent circumstances." ' " Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy, Inc. v. NRC, 479
U. S. 1312, 1313, (Scalia, J., in chambers). Applicant has not established that this extraordinary remedy is appropriate here.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, Circuit Justice.
Applicant Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., has requested I
grant an injunction pending appeal barring the enforcementof $ 203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002

(BCRA), 116 Stat. 91, 2 U. S. C. $ 441b (2000 ed. and Supp.II), which bars corporations from using general treasury
funds to finance electioneering communications as defined inBCRA $ 201. Applicant contends that $ 203 violates the
First Amendment as applied to its political advertisements.A three-judge District Court, convened pursuant to BCRA

$ 403(a)(1), denied applicant's motion for a preliminary in-junction and denied applicant's motion for an injunction
pending appeal. I herewith deny the application for an injunction pending appeal.An injunction pending appeal barring the enforcement of

an Act of Congress would be an extraordinary remedy, par542US2IC2H 10-26-06 09:14:30 PAGES IC13PGT

ticularly when this Court recently held BCRA facially consti-tutional, McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n, 540 U. S.

93, 189-210 (2003), and when a unanimous three-judge Dis-trict Court rejected applicant's request for a preliminary
injunction. See Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC,507 U. S. 1301, 1302-1303 (1993) (

Rehnquist, C. J., in cham-bers). The All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1651(a), is the only

source of this Court's authority to issue such an injunction.That authority is to be used " ` "sparingly and only in the
most critical and exigent circumstances." ' " Ohio Citizensfor Responsible Energy, Inc. v. NRC, 479 U. S. 1312, 1313
(1986) (Scalia, J., in chambers) (quoting Fishman v. Schaf-fer, 429 U. S. 1325, 1326 (1976) (Marshall, J., in chambers)).
It is only appropriately exercised where (1) "necessary orappropriate in aid of [our] jurisdictio[n]," 28 U. S. C. $ 1651(a),
and (2) the legal rights at issue are "indisputably clear,"Brown v. Gilmore, 533 U. S. 1301, 1303 (2001) (

Rehnquist,C. J., in chambers). Applicant has failed to establish that

this extraordinary remedy is appropriate. Therefore, I de-cline to issue an injunction pending appeal in this case.

employer may defend by showing both (1) that it had a readily accessible
and effective policy for reporting and resolving sexual harassment complaints, and (2) that plaintiff unreasonably failed to avail herself of that
apparatus; but this affirmative defense will not be available if plaintiff
quit in reasonable response to an adverse action officially changing her

1. Certificate of appealability--Texas capital sentencing scheme--Mitigating IQ evidence.--Because "reasonable jurists would find the district
court's assessment of [petitioner's] constitutional claims debatable or
wrong," Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 484, a certificate of appealability
should have issued on petitioner's habeas claim that Texas capital sentencing scheme violated Eighth Amendment by not giving full effect to his
low IQ evidence. Tennard v. Dretke, p. 274.

2. Citizen captured abroad--Detention as enemy combatant.--Fourth
Circuit's decision ordering dismissal of habeas petition of Hamdi--a citizen
captured in Afghanistan challenging his detention as an enemy combatant--is vacated, and case is remanded. Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, p. 507.

3. Ineffective assistance of counsel claim--Unreasonable application
of state law--Standard of proof.--Sixth Circuit erred in finding state
court's application of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668--which requires a defendant to show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's
errors, proceeding's result would have been different--unreasonable on

basis of evidence not properly before state court, and in holding that state
court acted contrary to federal law by requiring proof of prejudice by a
preponderance of evidence rather than by a reasonable probability. Holland v. Jackson, p. 649.

4. Pro se petitioner--Dismissal--Required warnings.--District Court
did not err in dismissing, pursuant to Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509, a pro se
petitioner's mixed habeas petitions--i. e., petitions with both exhausted
and unexhausted claims--without giving him certain warnings directed
by Ninth Circuit. Pliler v. Ford, p. 225.

5. Retroactivity--Capital sentencing scheme--Disregarding mitigating factors.--Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367--in which this Court invalidated a capital sentencing scheme requiring juries to disregard mitigating
factors not found unanimously--announced a new rule of constitutional
criminal procedure that does not apply retroactively to cases already final
on direct review. Beard v. Banks, p. 406.

6. Retroactivity--Capital sentencing scheme--Proving aggravating
factors to a jury.--Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584--in which this Court
held that aggravating factors have to be proved to a jury rather than to
a judge--announced a new criminal procedure rule that does not apply
retroactively to cases already final on direct review. Schriro v. Summerlin, p. 348.

JURISDICTION--Continued.

2. Habeas corpus--Proper respondent--Citizen's detention as an
enemy combatant.--Federal District Court for Southern District of New
York lacks jurisdiction over Padilla's habeas petition because person having custody over Padilla is outside that court's jurisdiction; thus, this
Court does not reach question whether President has authority to detain
Padilla, a United States citizen, militarily as an enemy combatant. Rumsfeld v. Padilla, p. 426.
