CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 1991

NORDLINGER v. HAHN, in his capacity as TAX
ASSESSOR FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY, et al.

certiorari to the court of appeal of california,second appellate district

No. 90-1912. Argued February 25, 1992--Decided June 18, 1992
In response to rapidly rising real property taxes, California voters approved a statewide ballot initiative, Proposition 13, which added Article
XIIIA to the State Constitution. Among other things, Article XIIIA
embodies an "acquisition value" system of taxation, whereby property
is reassessed up to current appraised value upon new construction or a
change in ownership. Exemptions from this reassessment provision
exist for two types of transfers: exchanges of principal residences by
persons over the age of 55 and transfers between parents and children.
Over time, the acquisition-value system has created dramatic disparities
in the taxes paid by persons owning similar pieces of property. Longer
term owners pay lower taxes reflecting historic property values, while
newer owners pay higher taxes reflecting more recent values. Faced
with such a disparity, petitioner, a former Los Angeles apartment renter
who had recently purchased a house in Los Angeles County, filed suit
against respondents, the county and its tax assessor, claiming that Article XIIIA's reassessment scheme violates the Equal Protection Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment. The County Superior Court dismissed
the complaint without leave to amend, and the State Court of Appeal
affirmed.

Held: Article XIIIA's acquisition-value assessment scheme does not violate the Equal Protection Clause. Pp. 10-18.

2 NORDLINGER v. HAHN

Syllabus
(a) Unless a state-imposed classification warrants some form of
heightened review because it jeopardizes exercise of a fundamental
right or categorizes on the basis of an inherently suspect characteristic,
the Equal Protection Clause requires only that the classification rationally further a legitimate state interest. P. 10.

(b) Petitioner may not assert the constitutional right to travel as a
basis for heightened review of Article XIIIA. Her complaint does not
allege that she herself has been impeded from traveling or from settling
in California because, before purchasing her home, she already lived
in Los Angeles. Prudential standing principles prohibiting a litigant's
raising another person's legal rights may not be overlooked in this case,
since petitioner has not identified any obstacle preventing others who
wish to travel or settle in California from asserting claims on their own,
nor shown any special relationship with those whose rights she seeks to
assert. Pp. 10-11.

(c) In permitting longer term owners to pay less in taxes than newer
owners of comparable property, Article XIIIA's assessment scheme rationally furthers at least two legitimate state interests. First, because
the State has a legitimate interest in local neighborhood preservation,
continuity, and stability, it legitimately can decide to structure its tax
system to discourage rapid turnover in ownership of homes and businesses. Second, the State legitimately can conclude that a new owner,
at the point of purchasing his property, does not have the same reliance
interest warranting protection against higher taxes as does an existing
owner, who is already saddled with his purchase and does not have the
option of deciding not to buy his home if taxes become prohibitively
high. Pp. 11-14.

(d) Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. County Comm'n of Webster Cty.,
488 U. S. 336, is not controlling here, since the facts of that case precluded any plausible inference that the purpose of the tax assessment
practice there invalidated was to achieve the benefits of an acquisitionvalue tax scheme. Pp. 14-16.

(e) Article XIIIA's two reassessment exemptions rationally further
legitimate purposes. The people of California reasonably could have
concluded that older persons in general should not be discouraged from
exchanging their residences for ones more suitable to their changing
family sizes or incomes, and that the interests of family and neighborhood continuity and stability are furthered by and warrant an exemption for transfers between parents and children. Pp. 16-17.

(f) Because Article XIIIA is not palpably arbitrary, this Court must
decline petitioner's request to invalidate it, even if it may appear to be

Opinion of the Court
initiative known as Proposition 13. The adoption of Proposi-tion 13 served to amend the California Constitution to impose strict limits on the rate at which real property is taxedand on the rate at which real property assessments are increased from year to year. In this litigation, we consider achallenge under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the manner in which real propertynow is assessed under the California Constitution.

I
A

Proposition 13 followed many years of rapidly rising realproperty taxes in California. From fiscal years 1967-1968

to 1971-1972, revenues from these taxes increased on an av-erage of 11.5% per year. See Report of the Senate Commission on Property Tax Equity and Revenue to the CaliforniaState Senate 23 (1991) (Senate Commission Report). In response, the California Legislature enacted several propertytax relief measures, including a cap on tax rates in 1972.
Id., at 23-24. The boom in the State's real estate marketpersevered, however, and the median price of an existing
home doubled from $31,530 in 1973 to $62,430 in 1977. As aresult, tax levies continued to rise because of sharply increasing assessment values. Id., at 23. Some homeownerssaw their tax bills double or triple during this period, well
outpacing any growth in their income and ability to pay. Id.,at 25. See also Oakland, Proposition 13--Genesis and Consequences, 32 Nat. Tax J. 387, 392 (Supp. June 1979).By 1978, property tax relief had emerged as a major political issue in California. In only one month's time, tax reliefadvocates collected over 1.2 million signatures to qualify
Proposition 13 for the June 1978 ballot. See Lefcoe & Alli-son, The Legal Aspects of Proposition 13: The

Amador Val-ley Case, 53 S. Cal. L. Rev. 173, 174 (1978). On election day,

Proposition 13 received a favorable vote of 64.8% and carried55 of the State's 58 counties. California Secretary of State,

5Cite as: 505 U. S. 1 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
Statement of Vote and Supplement, Primary Election, June
6, 1978, p. 39. California thus had a novel constitutional
amendment that led to a property tax cut of approximately
$7 billion in the first year. Senate Commission Report 28.
A California homeowner with a $50,000 home enjoyed an immediate reduction of about $750 per year in property taxes.
Id., at 26.

As enacted by Proposition 13, Article XIIIA of the California Constitution caps real property taxes at 1% of a property's "full cash value." $ 1(a). "Full cash value" is defined
as the assessed valuation as of the 1975-1976 tax year or,
"thereafter, the appraised value of real property when purchased, newly constructed, or a change in ownership has occurred after the 1975 assessment." $ 2(a). The assessment
"may reflect from year to year the inflationary rate not to
exceed 2 percent for any given year." $ 2(b).

Article XIIIA also contains several exemptions from this
reassessment provision. One exemption authorizes the legislature to allow homeowners over the age of 55 who sell
their principal residences to carry their previous base-year
assessments with them to replacement residences of equal
or lesser value. $ 2(a). A second exemption applies to
transfers of a principal residence (and up to $1 million of
other real property) between parents and children. $ 2(h).

In short, Article XIIIA combines a 1% ceiling on the property tax rate with a 2% cap on annual increases in assessed
valuations. The assessment limitation, however, is subject
to the exception that new construction or a change of ownership triggers a reassessment up to current appraised value.
Thus, the assessment provisions of Article XIIIA essentially
embody an "acquisition value" system of taxation rather than
the more commonplace "current value" taxation. Real property is assessed at values related to the value of the property
at the time it is acquired by the taxpayer rather than to the
value it has in the current real estate market.

6 NORDLINGER v. HAHN

Opinion of the Court
Over time, this acquisition-value system has created dra-matic disparities in the taxes paid by persons owning similar

pieces of property. Property values in California have in-flated far in excess of the allowed 2% cap on increases in
assessments for property that is not newly constructed orthat has not changed hands. See Senate Commission Report 31-32. As a result, longer term property owners paylower property taxes reflecting historic property values,
while newer owners pay higher property taxes reflectingmore recent values. For that reason, Proposition 13 has
been labeled by some as a "welcome stranger" system--thenewcomer to an established community is "welcome" in
anticipation that he will contribute a larger percentage ofsupport for local government than his settled neighbor who
owns a comparable home. Indeed, in dollar terms, the dif-ferences in tax burdens are staggering. By 1989, the 44%
of California homeowners who have owned their homes sinceenactment of Proposition 13 in 1978 shouldered only 25% of
the more than $4 billion in residential property taxes paidby homeowners statewide.

Id., at 33. If property valuescontinue to rise more than the annual 2% inflationary cap,

this disparity will continue to grow.

B
According to her amended complaint, petitioner StephanieNordlinger in November 1988 purchased a house in the Baldwin Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles County for $170,000.App. 5. The prior owners bought the home just two years
before for $121,500. Id., at 6. Before her purchase, peti-tioner had lived in a rented apartment in Los Angeles and
had not owned any real property in California. Id., at 5; Tr.of Oral Arg. 12.

In early 1989, petitioner received a notice from the LosAngeles County Tax Assessor, who is a respondent here, informing her that her home had been reassessed upward to$170,100 on account of its change in ownership. App. 7.

Opinion of the Court
She learned that the reassessment resulted in a property taxincrease of $453.60, up 36% to $1,701, for the 1988-1989 fiscal

year. Ibid.Petitioner later discovered she was paying about five
times more in taxes than some of her neighbors who ownedcomparable homes since 1975 within the same residential development. For example, one block away, a house of identi-cal size on a lot slightly larger than petitioner's was subject
to a general tax levy of only $358.20 (based on an assessedvaluation of $35,820, which reflected the home's value in 1975
plus the up-to-2% per year inflation factor). Id., at 9-10.2According to petitioner, her total property taxes over the
first 10 years in her home will approach $19,000, while anyneighbor who bought a comparable home in 1975 stands to
pay just $4,100. Brief for Petitioner 3. The general taxlevied against her modest home is only a few dollars short of
that paid by a pre-1976 owner of a $2.1 million Malibu beach-front home. App. 24.

After exhausting administrative remedies, petitionerbrought suit against respondents in Los Angeles County Superior Court. She sought a tax refund and a declarationthat her tax was unconstitutional.

3 In her amended com2 Petitioner proffered to the trial court additional evidence suggesting
that the disparities in residential tax burdens were greater in other Los
Angeles County neighborhoods. For example, a small two-bedroom house
in Santa Monica that was previously assessed at $27,000 and that was sold
for $465,000 in 1989 would be subject to a tax levy of $4,650, a bill 17 times
more than the $270 paid the year before by the previous owner. App.
76-77. Petitioner also proffered evidence suggesting that similar disparities obtained with respect to apartment buildings and commercial and industrial income-producing properties. Id., at 68-69, 82-85.

3 California by statute grants a cause of action to a taxpayer "where the

alleged illegal or unconstitutional assessment or collection occurs as the
direct result of a change in administrative regulations or statutory or constitutional law that became effective not more than 12 months prior to the
date the action is initiated by the taxpayer." Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code Ann.

$ 4808 (West 1987). Although Proposition 13 was enacted 11 years before
she filed her complaint, petitioner contended that the relevant change in

Opinion of the Court
plaint, she alleged: "Article XIIIA has created an arbitrarysystem which assigns disparate real property tax burdens on

owners of generally comparable and similarly situated prop-erties without regard to the use of the real property taxed,
the burden the property places on government, the actualvalue of the property or the financial capability of the property owner." Id., at 12. Respondents demurred. Id., at14. By minute order, the Superior Court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the complaint without leave to amend.App. to Pet. for Cert. D2.

The California Court of Appeal affirmed. Nordlinger v.
Lynch, 225 Cal. App. 3d 1259, 275 Cal. Rptr. 684 (1990). Itnoted that the Supreme Court of California already had rejected a constitutional challenge to the disparities in taxationresulting from Article XIIIA. See

Amador Valley JointUnion High School Dist. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 22

Cal. 3d 208, 583 P. 2d 1281 (1978). Characterizing ArticleXIIIA as an "acquisition value" system, the Court of Appeal
found it survived equal protection review, because it wassupported by at least two rational bases: First, it prevented
property taxes from reflecting unduly inflated and unfore-seen current values, and, second, it allowed property owners
to estimate future liability with substantial certainty. 225Cal. App. 3d, at 1273, 275 Cal. Rptr., at 691-692 (citing

Ama-dor, 22 Cal. 3d, at 235, 583 P. 2d, at 1293).

The Court of Appeal also concluded that this Court's morerecent decision in

Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. CountyComm'n of Webster Cty., 488 U. S. 336 (1989), did not warrant a different result. At issue in Allegheny Pittsburghwas the practice of a West Virginia county tax assessor of
assessing recently purchased property on the basis of its purlaw was this Court's decision in Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. County
Comm'n of Webster Cty., 488 U. S. 336 (1989), decided 9 months before
petitioner filed her amended complaint. Because the California courts did
not discuss whether petitioner's action was timely under $ 4808, we do not
do so.

Opinion of the Court
chase price, while making only minor modifications in the
assessments of property that had not recently been sold.
Properties that had been sold recently were reassessed and
taxed at values between 8 and 35 times that of properties
that had not been sold. Id., at 341. This Court determined
that the unequal assessment practice violated the Equal Protection Clause.

The Court of Appeal distinguished Allegheny Pittsburgh
on the grounds that "California has opted for an assessment
method based on each individual owner's acquisition cost,"
while, "[i]n marked contrast, the West Virginia Constitution
requires property to be taxed at a uniform rate statewide
according to its estimated current market value" (emphasis
in original). 225 Cal. App. 3d, at 1277-1278, 275 Cal. Rptr.,
at 695. Thus, the Court of Appeal found: "Allegheny does
not prohibit the states from adopting an acquisition value
assessment method. That decision merely prohibits the arbitrary enforcement of a current value assessment method"
(emphasis omitted). Id., at 1265, 275 Cal. Rptr., at 686.

The Court of Appeal also rejected petitioner's argument
that the effect of Article XIIIA on the constitutional right to
travel warranted heightened equal protection review. The
court determined that the right to travel was not infringed,
because Article XIIIA "bases each property owner's assessment on acquisition value, irrespective of the owner's status
as a California resident or the owner's length of residence in
the state." Id., at 1281, 275 Cal. Rptr., at 697. Any benefit
to longtime California residents was deemed "incidental" to
an acquisition-value approach. Finally, the Court of Appeal
found its conclusion was unchanged by the exemptions in Article XIIIA. Ibid.

The Supreme Court of California denied review. App. to

Opinion of the Court

II
The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-ment, $ 1, commands that no State shall "deny to any person

within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." Ofcourse, most laws differentiate in some fashion between
classes of persons. The Equal Protection Clause does notforbid classifications. It simply keeps governmental decisionmakers from treating differently persons who are in allrelevant respects alike. F. S. Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, 253 U. S. 412, 415 (1920).As a general rule, "legislatures are presumed to have
acted within their constitutional power despite the fact that,in practice, their laws result in some inequality." McGowan
v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420, 425-426 (1961). Accordingly,this Court's cases are clear that, unless a classification warrants some form of heightened review because it jeopardizesexercise of a fundamental right or categorizes on the basis
of an inherently suspect characteristic, the Equal ProtectionClause requires only that the classification rationally further
a legitimate state interest. See, e. g., Cleburne v. Cleburne
Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S. 432, 439-441 (1985); New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U. S. 297, 303 (1976).

A
At the outset, petitioner suggests that Article XIIIA qual-ifies for heightened scrutiny because it infringes upon the

constitutional right to travel. See, e. g., Zobel v. Williams,457 U. S. 55, 60, n. 6 (1982);

Memorial Hospital v. MaricopaCounty, 415 U. S. 250, 254-256 (1974). In particular, petitioner alleges that the exemptions to reassessment for trans-fers by owners over the age of 55 and for transfers between
parents and children run afoul of the right to travel, becausethey classify directly on the basis of California residency.
But the complaint does not allege that petitioner herself hasbeen impeded from traveling or from settling in California
because, as has been noted, prior to purchasing her home,

Opinion of the Court
petitioner lived in an apartment in Los Angeles. ThisCourt's prudential standing principles impose a "general prohibition on a litigant's raising another person's legal rights."Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751 (1984). See also Moose
Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U. S. 163, 166 (1972). Petitionerhas not identified any obstacle preventing others who wish
to travel or settle in California from asserting claims on theirown behalf, nor has she shown any special relationship with
those whose rights she seeks to assert, such that we mightoverlook this prudential limitation.

Caplin & Drysdale,Chartered v. United States, 491 U. S. 617, 623, n. 3 (1989).

Accordingly, petitioner may not assert the constitutionalright to travel as a basis for heightened review.

B
The appropriate standard of review is whether the differ-ence in treatment between newer and older owners rationally furthers a legitimate state interest. In general, theEqual Protection Clause is satisfied so long as there is a plausible policy reason for the classification, see United States
Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U. S. 166, 174, 179(1980), the legislative facts on which the classification is apparently based rationally may have been considered to betrue by the governmental decisionmaker, see

Minnesota v.Clover Leaf Creamery Co., 449 U. S. 456, 464 (1981), and the

relationship of the classification to its goal is not so attenu-ated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational, see
Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S., at 446.This standard is especially deferential in the context of classifications made by complex tax laws. "[I]n structuring in-ternal taxation schemes `the States have large leeway in
making classifications and drawing lines which in their judg-ment produce reasonable systems of taxation.' "

Williamsv. Vermont, 472 U. S. 14, 22 (1985), quoting Lehnhausen v.

Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., 410 U. S. 356, 359 (1973). Seealso Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Wash., 461

505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:55 PAGES OPINPGT
12 NORDLINGER v. HAHN

Opinion of the Court
U. S. 540, 547 (1983) ("Legislatures have especially broadlatitude in creating classifications and distinctions in tax

statutes").As between newer and older owners, Article XIIIA does
not discriminate with respect to either the tax rate or the
annual rate of adjustment in assessments. Newer and olderowners alike benefit in both the short and long run from the

protections of a 1% tax rate ceiling and no more than a 2%increase in assessment value per year. New owners and old
owners are treated differently with respect to one factoronly--the basis on which their property is initially assessed.
Petitioner's true complaint is that the State has denied her--
a new owner--the benefit of the same assessment value that
her neighbors--older owners--enjoy.

We have no difficulty in ascertaining at least two rational
or reasonable considerations of difference or policy that justify denying petitioner the benefits of her neighbors' lower
assessments. First, the State has a legitimate interest in
local neighborhood preservation, continuity, and stability.
Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365 (1926).
The State therefore legitimately can decide to structure its
tax system to discourage rapid turnover in ownership of
homes and businesses, for example, in order to inhibit displacement of lower income families by the forces of gentrification or of established, "mom-and-pop" businesses by newer
chain operations. By permitting older owners to pay progressively less in taxes than new owners of comparable property, the Article XIIIA assessment scheme rationally furthers this interest.

Second, the State legitimately can conclude that a new
owner at the time of acquiring his property does not have the
same reliance interest warranting protection against higher
taxes as does an existing owner. The State may deny a new
owner at the point of purchase the right to "lock in" to the
same assessed value as is enjoyed by an existing owner of
comparable property, because an existing owner rationally

Opinion of the Court
may be thought to have vested expectations in his propertyor home that are more deserving of protection than the anticipatory expectations of a new owner at the point of purchase.A new owner has full information about the scope of future
tax liability before acquiring the property, and if he thinks
the future tax burden is too demanding, he can decide not tocomplete the purchase at all. By contrast, the existing

owner, already saddled with his purchase, does not have theoption of deciding not to buy his home if taxes become prohibitively high. To meet his tax obligations, he might beforced to sell his home or to divert his income away from the
purchase of food, clothing, and other necessities. In short,the State may decide that it is worse to have owned and lost,
than never to have owned at all.

This Court previously has acknowledged that classifica-tions serving to protect legitimate expectation and reliance

interests do not deny equal protection of the laws.4 "The
protection of reasonable reliance interests is not only a legitimate governmental objective: it provides an exceedingly
persuasive justification . . . ." Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U. S.
728, 746 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted). For example, in Kadrmas v. Dickinson Public Schools, 487 U. S.

hesitated to recognize the legitimacy of protecting reliance and expectational interests. See, e. g., Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U. S. 128, 143 (1978)
("[P]rotection of the Fourth Amendment depends . . . upon whether the
person who claims the protection of the Amendment has a legitimate expectation of privacy in the invaded place"); Penn Central Transportation
Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104, 124 (1978) (whether regulation of
property constitutes a "taking" depends in part on "the extent to which
the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations"); Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U. S. 593, 601 (1972) (state-law "property" interest for purpose of federal due process denotes "interests that
are secured by existing rules or understandings") (internal quotation

of those residing in districts with free busing arrangementsimposed by reorganization plans."

Id., at 465. Similarly, inUnited States Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, the Court

determined that a denial of dual "windfall" retirement ben-efits to some railroad workers, but not others, did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, because "Congress couldproperly conclude that persons who had actually acquired
statutory entitlement to windfall benefits while still employed in the railroad industry had a greater equitable claimto those benefits than the members of appellee's class who

were no longer in railroad employment when they becameeligible for dual benefits." 449 U. S., at 178. Finally, in
New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U. S. 297 (1976), the Court deter-mined that an ordinance banning certain street-vendor operations, but grandfathering existing vendors who had been inoperation for more than eight years, did not violate the
Equal Protection Clause because the "city could reasonably
decide that newer businesses were less likely to have builtup substantial reliance interests in continued operation."

Id., at 305.5Petitioner argues that Article XIIIA cannot be distinguished from the tax assessment practice found to violate
the Equal Protection Clause in Allegheny Pittsburgh. LikeArticle XIIIA, the practice at issue in

Allegheny Pittsburgh
resulted in dramatic disparities in taxation of properties of
comparable value. But an obvious and critical factual differ5 Because we conclude that Article XIIIA rationally furthers the State's
interests in neighborhood stability and the protection of property owners'
reliance interests, we need not consider whether it permissibly serves
other interests discussed by the parties, including whether it taxes real
property according to the taxpayers' ability to pay or whether it taxes
real property in such a way as to promote stability of local tax revenues.

ence between this case and Allegheny Pittsburgh is the ab-sence of any indication in Allegheny Pittsburgh that the policies underlying an acquisition-value taxation scheme couldconceivably have been the purpose for the Webster County
tax assessor's unequal assessment scheme. In the firstplace, Webster County argued that "its assessment scheme
is rationally related to its purpose of assessing properties
at true current value" (emphasis added). 488 U. S., at 343.6Moreover, the West Virginia "Constitution and laws provide

that all property of the kind held by petitioners shall betaxed at a rate uniform throughout the State according to
its estimated market value," and the Court found "no sug-gestion" that "the State may have adopted a different system in practice from that specified by statute." Id., at 345.To be sure, the Equal Protection Clause does not demand
for purposes of rational-basis review that a legislature orgoverning decisionmaker actually articulate at any time the
purpose or rationale supporting its classification. United
States Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U. S., at 179.See also McDonald v. Board of Election Comm'rs of Chicago, 394 U. S. 802, 809 (1969) (legitimate state purpose maybe ascertained even when the legislative or administrative
history is silent). Nevertheless, this Court's review does re-quire that a purpose may conceivably or "may reasonably
have been the purpose and policy" of the relevant govern-mental decisionmaker.

Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc. v. Bow6 Webster County argued that the outdated assessments it used were
consistent with current-value taxation, because periodic upward adjustments were made for inflation and it was not feasible to reassess individually each piece of property every year. Although the county obliquely
referred in a footnote to the advantages of historical cost accounting, Brief
for Respondent in Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. County Comm'n of
Webster Cty., O. T. 1988, No. 87-1303, p. 30, n. 23, this was not an assertion
of the general policies supporting acquisition-value taxation. Even if
acquisition-value policies had been asserted, the assertion would have
been nonsensical given its inherent inconsistency with the county's principal argument that it was in fact trying to promote current-value taxation.

Wilson, 450 U. S. 221, 235 (1981) (classificatory scheme must
"rationally advanc[e] a reasonable and identifiable governmental objective" (emphasis added)). Allegheny Pittsburgh
was the rare case where the facts precluded any plausible
inference that the reason for the unequal assessment practice
was to achieve the benefits of an acquisition-value tax
scheme.7 By contrast, Article XIIIA was enacted precisely
to achieve the benefits of an acquisition-value system. Allegheny Pittsburgh is not controlling here.8

Finally, petitioner contends that the unfairness of Article
XIIIA is made worse by its exemptions from reassessment
for two special classes of new owners: persons aged 55 and
older, who exchange principal residences, and children who
acquire property from their parents. This Court previously
has declined to hold that narrow exemptions from a general
scheme of taxation necessarily render the overall scheme in7 In Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc. v. Bowers, 358 U. S. 522 (1959), the Court
distinguished on similar grounds its decision in Wheeling Steel Corp. v.
Glander, 337 U. S. 562 (1949), which invalidated a state statutory scheme
exempting from taxation certain notes and accounts receivable owned by
residents of the State but not notes and accounts receivable owned by
nonresidents. 358 U. S., at 529. After the Court in Wheeling Steel determined that the statutory scheme's stated purpose was not legitimate, the
other purposes did not need to be considered because "[h]aving themselves
specifically declared their purpose, the Ohio statutes left no room to conceive of any other purpose for their existence." 358 U. S., at 530.

8 In finding Allegheny Pittsburgh distinguishable, we do not suggest

that the protections of the Equal Protection Clause are any less when
the classification is drawn by legislative mandate, as in this case, than by
administrative action, as in Allegheny Pittsburgh. See Sunday Lake
Iron Co. v. Township of Wakefield, 247 U. S. 350, 352 (1918). Nor do we
suggest that the Equal Protection Clause constrains administrators, as in
Allegheny Pittsburgh, from violating state law requiring uniformity of
taxation of property. See Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Browning, 310
U. S. 362, 368-370 (1940); Puget Sound Power & Light Co. v. County of
King, 264 U. S. 22, 27-28 (1924). See generally Snowden v. Hughes, 321

vidiously discriminatory. See, e. g., Regan v. Taxation withRepresentation of Wash., 461 U. S., at 550-551 (denial of tax

exemption to nonprofit lobbying organizations, but with anexception for veterans' groups, does not violate equal protection). For purposes of rational-basis review, the "latitude ofdiscretion is notably wide in . . . the granting of partial or
total exemptions upon grounds of policy." F. S. Royster
Guano Co. v. Virginia, 253 U. S., at 415.The two exemptions at issue here rationally further legitimate purposes. The people of California reasonably couldhave concluded that older persons in general should not be
discouraged from moving to a residence more suitable totheir changing family size or income. Similarly, the people
of California reasonably could have concluded that the in-terests of family and neighborhood continuity and stability
are furthered by and warrant an exemption for transfersbetween parents and children. Petitioner has not demonstrated that no rational bases lie for either of theseexemptions.

III
Petitioner and amici argue with some appeal that ArticleXIIIA frustrates the "American dream" of home ownership

for many younger and poorer California families. Theyargue that Article XIIIA places startup businesses that depend on ownership of property at a severe disadvantage incompeting with established businesses. They argue that
Article XIIIA dampens demand for and construction of newhousing and buildings. And they argue that Article XIIIA
constricts local tax revenues at the expense of public educa-tion and vital services.

Time and again, however, this Court has made clear in therational-basis context that the "Constitution presumes that,
absent some reason to infer antipathy, even improvident de-cisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic process
and that judicial intervention is generally unwarranted nomatter how unwisely we may think a political branch has

vest benefits in a broad, powerful, and entrenched segmentof society, and, as the Court of Appeal surmised, ordinary
democratic processes may be unlikely to prompt its reconsid-eration or repeal. See 225 Cal. App. 3d, at 1282, n. 11,
275 Cal. Rptr., at 698, n. 11. Yet many wise and well-intentioned laws suffer from the same malady. Article
XIIIA is not palpably arbitrary, and we must decline peti-tioner's request to upset the will of the people of California.

The judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Thomas, concurring in part and concurring inthe judgment.

In Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. County Comm'n ofWebster Cty., 488 U. S. 336 (1989), this Court struck down an
assessment method used in Webster County, West Virginia,that operated precisely the same way as the California
scheme being challenged today. I agree with the Court thatProposition 13 is constitutional. But I also agree with

Justice Stevens that Allegheny Pittsburgh cannot be distin-guished. See

post, at 31-32. To me Allegheny Pittsburghrepresents a "needlessly intrusive judicial infringement on

the State's legislative powers," New Orleans v. Dukes, 427U. S. 297, 306 (1976)

(per curiam), and I write separatelybecause I see no benefit, and much risk, in refusing to confront it directly. I

Allegheny Pittsburgh involved a county assessmentscheme indistinguishable in relevant respects from Proposition 13. As the Court explains, California taxes real prop-erty at 1% of "full cash value," which means the "assessed
value" as of 1975 (under the previous method) and after1975-1976 the "appraised value of real property when pur505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:56 PAGES OPINPGT

chased, newly constructed, or a change in value has occurredafter the 1975 assessment." The assessed value may be increased for inflation, but only at a maximum rate of 2% eachyear. See California Const., Art. XIIIA, $$ 1(a), 2(a);

ante,
at 5. The property tax system worked much the same way
in Webster County, West Virginia. The tax assessor as-signed real property an "appraised value," set the "assessed

value" at half of the appraised value, then collected taxes bymultiplying the assessed value by the relevant tax rate.
For property that had been sold recently, the assessor setthe appraised value at the most recent price of purchase.
For property that had not been sold recently, she increased
the appraised price by 10%, first in 1976, then again in 1981
and 1983.

The assessor's methods resulted in "dramatic differences
in valuation between . . . recently transferred property and
otherwise comparable surrounding land." 488 U. S., at 341;
cf. Glennon, Taxation and Equal Protection, 58 Geo. Wash.
L. Rev. 261, 269-270 (1990) (discussing the effects of Proposition 13); Cohen, State Law in Equality Clothing: A Comment
on Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Company v. County Commission, 38 UCLA L. Rev. 87, 91, and n. 29 (1990); Hellerstein &
Peters, Recent Supreme Court Decisions Have Far-Reaching
Implications, 70 J. Taxation 306, 308-310 (1989). Several
coal companies that owned property in Webster County sued
the county assessor, alleging violations of both the West Virginia and the United States Constitutions. The Supreme
Court of Appeals of West Virginia upheld the assessment
against the companies, but this Court reversed.

The Allegheny Pittsburgh Court asserted that with respect to taxation, the Equal Protection Clause constrains the
States as follows. Although "[t]he use of a general adjustment as a transitional substitute for an individual reappraisal
violates no constitutional command," the Clause requires
that "general adjustments [be] accurate enough over a short
period of time to equalize the differences in proportion be505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:56 PAGES OPINPGT

U. S., at 343. "[T]he constitutional requirement is the seasonable attainment of a rough equality in tax treatment of
similarly situated property owners." Ibid. (citing Allied
Stores of Ohio, Inc. v. Bowers, 358 U. S. 522, 526-527 (1959)).
Moreover, the Court stated, the Constitution and laws of
West Virginia "provide that all property of the kind held by
petitioners shall be taxed at a rate uniform throughout the
State according to its estimated market value," and "[t]here
[was] no suggestion . . . that the State may have adopted a
different system in practice from that specified by statute."
488 U. S., at 345. "Indeed, [the assessor's] practice seems
contrary to that of the guide published by the West Virginia
Tax Commission as an aid to local assessors in the assessment of real property." Ibid.; see also ibid. ("We are not
advised of any West Virginia statute or practice which authorizes individual counties of the State to fashion their own
substantive assessment policies independently of state statute"). The Court refused to decide "whether the Webster
County assessment method would stand on a different footing if it were the law of a State, generally applied, instead
of the aberrational enforcement policy it appears to be."
Id., at 344, n. 4. Finally, the Court declared: " `[I]ntentional
systematic undervaluation by state officials of other taxable
property in the same class contravenes the constitutional
right of one taxed upon the full value of his property.' " Id.,
at 345 (quoting Sunday Lake Iron Co. v. Township of
Wakefield, 247 U. S. 350, 352-353 (1918), and citing Sioux
City Bridge Co. v. Dakota County, 260 U. S. 441 (1923); Cumberland Coal Co. v. Board of Revision of Tax Assessments
in Greene County, 284 U. S. 23 (1931)). The Court concluded that the assessments for the coal companies' properties had failed these requisites of the Equal Protection
Clause.

II
As the Court accurately states today, " this Court'scases"--

Allegheny Pittsburgh aside--"are clear that, unlessa classification warrants some form of heightened review

because it jeopardizes [the] exercise of a fundamental rightor categorizes on the basis of an inherently suspect characteristic, the Equal Protection Clause requires only that theclassification rationally further a legitimate state interest."
Ante, at 10; see also Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Ford, 504U. S. 648, 651 (1992);

Lehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto PartsCo., 410 U. S. 356, 359 (1973). The California tax system,

like most, does not involve either suspect classes or funda-mental rights, and the Court properly reviews California's
classification for a rational basis. Today's review, however,differs from the review in Allegheny Pittsburgh.

The Court's analysis in Allegheny Pittsburgh is suscepti-ble, I think, to at least three interpretations. The first is the
one offered by petitioner. Under her reading of the case,properties are "similarly situated" or within the same "class"
for the purposes of the Equal Protection Clause when theyare located in roughly the same types of neighborhoods, for
example, are roughly the same size, and are roughly thesame in other, unspecified ways. According to petitioner,
the Webster County assessor's plan violated the Equal Pro-tection Clause because she had failed to achieve a "seasonable attainment of a rough equality in tax treatment" of allthe objectively comparable properties in Webster County,
presumably those with about the same acreage and aboutthe same amount of coal. Petitioner contends that Proposition 13 suffers from similar flaws. In 1989, she points out,"the long-time owner of a stately 7,800-square-foot, sevenbedroom mansion on a huge lot in Beverly Hills (among themost luxurious homes in one of the most expensive neighborhoods in Los Angeles County) . . . paid less property taxannually than the new homeowner of a tiny 980-square-foot
home on a small lot in an extremely modest Venice neighbor505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:56 PAGES OPINPGT

hood." Brief for Petitioner 5; see also id., at 7 (Petitioner's
"1988 property tax assessment on her unpretentious Baldwin
Hills tract home is almost identical to that of a pre-1976
owner of a fabulous beach-front Malibu residential property
worth $2.1 million, even though her property is worth only
1/12th as much as his"). Because California not only has not
tried to repair this systematic, intentional, and gross disparity in taxation, but has enacted it into positive law, petitioner
argues, Proposition 13 violates the Equal Protection Clause.

This argument rests, in my view, on a basic misunderstanding of Allegheny Pittsburgh. The Court there proceeded on the assumption of law (assumed because the parties did not contest it) that the initial classification, by the
State, was constitutional, and the assumption of fact (assumed because the parties had so stipulated) that the properties were comparable under the State's classification. But
cf. Glennon, 58 Geo. Wash. L. Rev., at 271-272 (noting that
some of the properties contained coal and others did not).
In referring to the tax treatment of a "class of property holders," or "similarly situated property owners," 488 U. S., at
343, the Court did not purport to review the constitutionality
of the initial classification, by market value, drawn by the
State, as opposed to the further subclassification within the
initial class, by acquisition value, drawn by the assessor. Instead, Allegheny Pittsburgh assumed that whether properties or persons are similarly situated depended on state law,
and not, as petitioner argues, on some neutral criteria such
as size or location that serve as proxies for market value.
Under that theory, market value would be the only rational
basis for classifying property. But the Equal Protection
Clause does not prescribe a single method of taxation. We
have consistently rejected petitioner's theory, see, e. g., Ohio
Oil Co. v. Conway, 281 U. S. 146 (1930); Bell's Gap R. Co. v.
Pennsylvania, 134 U. S. 232 (1890), and the Court properly
rejects it today.

Opinion of Thomas, J.
Allegheny Pittsburgh, then, does not prevent the State ofCalifornia from classifying properties on the basis of their

value at acquisition, so long as the classification is supportedby a rational basis. I agree with the Court that it is, both
for the reasons given by this Court, see ante, at 11-14, and
for the reasons given by the Supreme Court of California in
Amador Valley Joint Union High School Dist. v. State Bd.
of Equalization, 22 Cal. 3d 208, 583 P. 2d 1281 (1978). Butthe classification employed by the Webster County assessor,

indistinguishable from California's, was rational for all thosereasons as well. In answering petitioner's argument that
Allegheny Pittsburgh controls here, respondents offer a second explanation for that case. Justice Stevens gives
much the same explanation, see post, at 31-32, though he
concludes in the end that Proposition 13, after Allegheny
Pittsburgh, is unconstitutional.

According to respondents, the Equal Protection Clause
permits a State itself to determine which properties are similarly situated, as the State of California did here (classifying
properties by acquisition value) and as the State of West
Virginia did in Allegheny Pittsburgh (classifying properties
by market value). But once a State does so, respondents
suggest, the Equal Protection Clause requires after Allegheny Pittsburgh that properties in the same class be accorded seasonably equal treatment and not be intentionally
and systematically undervalued. Proposition 13 provides
for the assessment of properties in the same statedetermined class regularly and at roughly full value; this
contrasts with the tax scheme in Webster County, where by
dividing property in the same class (by market value) into a
subclass (by acquisition value), the assessor regularly undervalued the property similarly situated. This, according to
respondents, made the Webster County scheme unconstitutional, and distinguishes Proposition 13.

Respondents' reading of Allegheny Pittsburgh is, in my
view, as misplaced as petitioner's; their test, for starters,

comes with a dubious pedigree. In one of the cases cited in
Allegheny Pittsburgh, Allied Stores, we upheld against an
equal protection challenge a statute that exempted some cor-porations from ad valorem taxes imposed on others. Not

only does Allied Stores not even hint that the Constitution
"require[s] . . . the seasonable attainment of a rough equalityin tax treatment of similarly situated property owners," 488

U. S., at 343, we took pains there to stress a very differentproposition:

"The States have very wide discretion in the laying of
their taxes. . . . Of course, the States, in the exercise of
their taxing power, are subject to the requirements ofthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. But that clause imposes no iron rule of equality,prohibiting the flexibility and variety that are appropriate to reasonable schemes of state taxation. TheState . . . is not required to resort to close distinctions
or to maintain a precise, scientific uniformity with reference to composition, use or value." Allied Stores, 358U. S., at 526-527.

Two of the other cases cited in Allegheny Pittsburgh, Sunday Lake Iron and Sioux City Bridge, also rejected equalprotection challenges, see also

Charleston Fed. Sav. & Loan
Assn. v. Alderson, 324 U. S. 182 (1945), and the case in which
the words intentional, systematic, and undervaluation firstappeared,

Coulter v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 196 U. S.
599, 609 (1905), did not explain where the test came fromor why.

It is true that we applied the rule of Coulter to strike
down a tax system in Cumberland Coal, also cited in Allegheny Pittsburgh. Cumberland Coal, however, reflects the
most serious of the problems with respondents' reading of
Allegheny Pittsburgh. As respondents understand these
two cases, their rule is categorical: A tax scheme violates
the Equal Protection Clause unless it provides for "the sea505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:56 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Thomas, J.
sonable attainment of a rough equality in tax treatment" orif it results in " `intentional systematic undervaluation' " of

properties similarly situated by state law. 488 U. S., at 343,345. This would be so regardless of whether the inequality
or the undervaluation, which may result (as in Webster
County) from further classifications of properties within aclass, is supported by a rational basis. But not since the

coming of modern equal protection jurisprudence has thisCourt supplanted the rational judgments of state representatives with its own notions of "rough equality," "undervalua-tion," or "fairness."

Cumberland Coal, which fails even to
mention rational-basis review, conflicts with our current case
law. Allegheny Pittsburgh did not, in my view, mean to
return us to the era when this Court sometimes secondguessed state tax officials. In rejecting today respondents'
reading of Allegheny Pittsburgh, the Court, as I understand
it, agrees.

This brings me to the third explanation for Allegheny
Pittsburgh, the one offered today by the Court. The Court
proceeds in what purports to be our standard equal protection framework, though it reapplies an old, and to my mind
discredited, gloss to rational-basis review. The Court concedes that the "Equal Protection Clause does not demand for
purposes of rational-basis review that a legislature or governing decisionmaker actually articulate at any time the purpose or rationale supporting its classification." Ante, at 15
(citing United States Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449
U. S. 166, 179 (1980)). This principle applies, the Court
acknowledges, not only to an initial classification but to
all further classifications within a class. "Nevertheless, this
Court's review does require that a purpose may conceivably
or `may reasonably have been the purpose and policy' of the
relevant governmental decisionmaker," the Court says, ante,
at 15 (quoting Allied Stores, supra, at 528-529), and "Allegheny Pittsburgh was the rare case where the facts precluded any plausible inference that the reason for the un505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:56 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Thomas, J.
equal assessment practice was to achieve the benefits of anacquisition-value tax scheme," ante, at 16. Rather than

obeying the "law of a State, generally applied," the countyassessor had administered an "aberrational enforcement policy." 488 U. S., at 344, n. 4. See ante, at 15. According tothe Court, therefore, the problem in

Allegheny Pittsburghwas that the Webster County scheme, though otherwise rational, was irrational because it was contrary to state law.Any rational bases underlying the acquisition-value scheme
were "implausible" (or "unreasonable") because they weremade so by the Constitution and laws of the State of West
Virginia.That explanation, like petitioner's and respondents', is in
tension with settled case law. Even if the assessor did vio-late West Virginia law (and that she did is open to question,
see In re 1975 Tax Assessments Against Oneida Coal Co.,178 W. Va. 485, 489, 360 S. E. 2d 560, 564 (1987)), she would
not have violated the Equal Protection Clause. A violationof state law does not by itself constitute a violation of the
Federal Constitution. We made that clear in Snowden v.Hughes, 321 U. S. 1 (1944), for instance, where a candidate
for state office complained that members of the local canvass-ing board had refused to certify his name as a nominee to
the Secretary of State, thus violating an Illinois statute. Be-cause the plaintiff had not alleged, say, that the defendants
had meant to discriminate against him on racial grounds, butmerely that they had failed to comply with a statute, we
rejected the argument that the defendants had thereby vio-lated the Equal Protection Clause.

The Court today promises not to have overruled Snowden,see ante, at 16, n. 8, but its disclaimer, I think, is in vain.
For if, as the Court suggests, what made the assessor'smethod unreasonable was her supposed violation of state
law, the Court's interpretation of Allegheny Pittsburgh re-casts in this case the proposition that we had earlier rejected. See Glennon, 58 Geo. Wash. L. Rev., at 268-269;Cohen, 38 UCLA L. Rev., at 93-94; Ely, Another Spin on
Allegheny Pittsburgh, 38 UCLA L. Rev. 107, 108-109 (1990).In repudiating

Snowden, moreover, the Court threatens set-tled principles not only of the Fourteenth Amendment but of

the Eleventh. We have held that the Eleventh Amendmentbars federal courts from ordering state actors to conform
to the dictates of state law. Pennhurst State School and
Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89 (1984). After today,however, a plaintiff might be able to invoke federal jurisdiction to have state actors obey state law, for a claim that thestate actor has violated state law appears to have become a
claim that he has violated the Constitution. See Cohen,

(as most do) in the treatment of some people better thanothers--are theoretically convertible into violations of the
Equal Protection Clause").I understand that the Court prefers to distinguish Allegheny Pittsburgh, but in doing so, I think, the Court has leftour equal protection jurisprudence in disarray. The analysis appropriate to this case is straightforward. Unless aclassification involves suspect classes or fundamental rights,
judicial scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause demandsonly a conceivable rational basis for the challenged state distinction. See Fritz, supra; Kassel v. Consolidated Freight505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:56 PAGES OPINPGT

I concur in the judgment of the Court and join Part II-Aof its opinion.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
During the two past decades, California property ownershave enjoyed extraordinary prosperity. As the State's population has mushroomed, so has the value of its real estate.Between 1976 and 1986 alone, the total assessed value of
California property subject to property taxation increasedtenfold.

1 Simply put, those who invested in California real

estate in the 1970's are among the most fortunate capitalistsin the world.

Proposition 13 has provided these successful investorswith a tremendous windfall and, in doing so, has created se1 Glennon, Taxation and Equal Protection, 58 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 261,
270, n. 49 (1990). "For the same period, [property values in] Hawaii rose

York approximately 125%." Ibid. (citing 2 U. S. Dept. of Commerce,

vere inequities in California's property tax scheme.2 Theseproperty owners (hereinafter Squires) are guaranteed that,

so long as they retain their property and do not improve it,their taxes will not increase more than 2% in any given year.
As a direct result of this windfall for the Squires, later pur-chasers must pay far more than their fair share of property
taxes.The specific disparity that prompted petitioner to challenge the constitutionality of Proposition 13 is the fact thather annual property tax bill is almost five times as large as
that of her neighbors who own comparable homes: While herneighbors' 1989 taxes averaged less than $400, petitioner was
taxed $1,700. App. 18-20. This disparity is not unusualunder Proposition 13. Indeed, some homeowners pay 17
times as much in taxes as their neighbors with comparableproperty. See id., at 76-77. For vacant land, the disparities may be as great as 500 to 1. App. to Pet. for Cert. A7.Moreover, as Proposition 13 controls the taxation of commercial property as well as residential property, the regimegreatly favors the commercial enterprises of the Squires,
placing new businesses at a substantial disadvantage.As a result of Proposition 13, the Squires, who own 44%
of the owner-occupied residences, paid only 25% of the totaltaxes collected from homeowners in 1989. Report of Senate
Commission on Property Tax Equity and Revenue to theCalifornia State Senate 33 (1991) (Commission Report).
These disparities are aggravated by $ 2 of Proposition 13,which exempts from reappraisal a property owner's home
and up to $1 million of other real property when that prop-erty is transferred to a child of the owner. This exemption
can be invoked repeatedly and indefinitely, allowing theProposition 13 windfall to be passed from generation to generation. As the California Senate Commission on PropertyTax Equity and Revenue observed:

2 Proposition 13 was codified as Article XIIIA of the California Constitution; for convenience sake, however, I refer to it by its colloquial name.

Stevens, J., dissenting
"The inequity is clear. One young family buys a newhome and is assessed at full market value. Another

young family inherits its home, but pays taxes basedon their parents' date of acquisition even though both
homes are of identical value. Not only does this consti-tutional provision offend a policy of equal tax treatment
for taxpayers in similar situations, it appears to favorthe housing needs of children with homeowner-parents
over children with non-homeowner-parents. With therepeal of the state's gift and inheritance tax in 1982, the
rationale for this exemption is negligible." CommissionReport 9-10.

The commission was too generous. To my mind, the rationalefor such disparity is not merely "negligible," it is nonexistent. Such a law establishes a privilege of a medieval char-acter: Two families with equal needs and equal resources are
treated differently solely because of their different heritage.In my opinion, such disparate treatment of similarly situated taxpayers is arbitrary and unreasonable. Although theCourt today recognizes these gross inequities, see ante, at 7,
n. 2, its analysis of the justification for those inequities con-sists largely of a restatement of the benefits that accrue
to long-time property owners. That a law benefits thoseit benefits cannot be an adequate justification for severe
inequalities such as those created by Proposition 13.

The standard by which we review equal protection chal-lenges to state tax regimes is well established and properly

deferential. "Where taxation is concerned and no specificfederal right, apart from equal protection, is imperiled, the
States have large leeway in making classifications and draw-ing lines which in their judgment produce reasonable systems of taxation." Lehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts
Co., 410 U. S. 356, 359 (1973). Thus, as the Court todaynotes, the issue in this case is "whether the difference in

treatment between newer and older owners rationally fur-thers a legitimate state interest."

Ante, at 11.3
But deference is not abdication and "rational-basis scru-tiny" is still scrutiny. Thus we have, on several recent occasions, invalidated tax schemes under such a standard of re-view. See,

e. g., Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. County
Comm'n of Webster Cty., 488 U. S. 336 (1989); Hooper v. Bernalillo County Assessor, 472 U. S. 612, 618 (1985); Williamsv.

Vermont, 472 U. S. 14 (1985); Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v.
Ward, 470 U. S. 869 (1985); cf. Zobel v. Williams, 457 U. S.55, 60-61 (1982).

Just three Terms ago, this Court unanimously invalidatedWebster County, West Virginia's assessment scheme under
rational-basis scrutiny. Webster County employed a de
facto Proposition 13 assessment system: The county assessedrecently purchased property on the basis of its purchase

price but made only occasional adjustments (averaging 3-4%
per year) to the assessments of other properties. Just as in
this case, "[t]his approach systematically produced dramatic
differences in valuation between . . . recently transferred
property and otherwise comparable surrounding land." Allegheny Pittsburgh, 488 U. S., at 341.

The " `[i]ntentional systematic undervaluation,' " id., at
345, found constitutionally infirm in Allegheny Pittsburgh
has been codified in California by Proposition 13. That the
discrimination in Allegheny Pittsburgh was de facto and the
discrimination in this case de jure makes little difference.

13 infringes on the constitutional right to travel and that, accordingly, a
more searching standard of review is appropriate. There is no need to
address that issue because the gross disparities created by Proposition 13
do not pass even the most deferential standard of review. Cf. Hooper v.

State's jurisdiction against intentional and arbitrary discrim-ination,

whether occasioned by express terms of a statute or
by its improper execution through duly constituted agents."
Sunday Lake Iron Co. v. Township of Wakefield, 247 U. S.
350, 352-353 (1918) (emphasis added). If anything, the inequality created by Proposition 13 is constitutionally moreproblematic because it is the product of a statewide policy

rather than the result of an individual assessor's mal-administration.

Nor can Allegheny Pittsburgh be distinguished becauseWest Virginia law established a market-value assessment regime. Webster County's scheme was constitutionally invalid not because it was a departure from state law, but because it involved the relative " `systematic undervaluation . . .
[of] property in the same class' " (as that class was defined
by state law). Allegheny Pittsburgh, 488 U. S., at 345 (emphasis added). Our decisions have established that the
Equal Protection Clause is offended as much by the arbitrary
delineation of classes of property (as in this case) as by the
arbitrary treatment of properties within the same class (as
in Allegheny Pittsburgh). See Brown-Forman Co. v. Kentucky, 217 U. S. 563, 573 (1910); Cumberland Coal Co. v.
Board of Revision of Tax Assessments of Greene County,
284 U. S. 23, 28-30 (1931). Thus, if our unanimous holding
in Allegheny Pittsburgh was sound--and I remain convinced
that it was--it follows inexorably that Proposition 13, like
Webster County's assessment scheme, violates the Equal
Protection Clause. Indeed, in my opinion, statewide discrimination is far more invidious than a local aberration that
creates a tax disparity.

The States, of course, have broad power to classify property in their taxing schemes and if the "classification is neither capricious nor arbitrary, and rests upon some reasonable
consideration of difference or policy, there is no denial of the
equal protection of the law." Brown-Forman Co. v. Kentucky, 217 U. S., at 573. As we stated in Allegheny Pitts505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:56 PAGES OPINPGT

burgh, a "State may divide different kinds of property into
classes and assign to each class a different tax burden so long
as those divisions and burdens are reasonable." 488 U. S.,
at 344.

Consistent with this standard, the Court has long upheld
tax classes based on the taxpayer's ability to pay, see, e. g.,
Fox v. Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey, 294 U. S. 87, 101
(1935); the nature (tangible or intangible) of the property,
see, e. g., Klein v. Board of Tax Supervisors of Jefferson
County, 282 U. S. 19, 23-24 (1930); the use of the property,
see, e. g., Clark v. Kansas City, 176 U. S. 114 (1900); and the
status (corporate or individual) of the property owner, see,
e. g., Lehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., 410 U. S.
356 (1973). Proposition 13 employs none of these familiar
classifications. Instead, it classifies property based on its
nominal purchase price: All property purchased for the same
price is taxed the same amount (leaving aside the 2% annual
adjustment). That this scheme can be named (an "acquisition value" system) does not render it any less arbitrary or
unreasonable. Under Proposition 13, a majestic estate purchased for $150,000 in 1975 (and now worth more than $2
million) is placed in the same tax class as a humble cottage
purchased today for $150,000. The only feature those two
properties have in common is that somewhere, sometime a
sale contract for each was executed that contained the price
"$150,000." Particularly in an environment of phenomenal
real property appreciation, to classify property based on its
purchase price is "palpably arbitrary." Allied Stores of
Ohio, Inc. v. Bowers, 358 U. S. 522, 530 (1959).

The adjectives and adverbs in this standard are more impor-tant than the nouns and verbs.

A legitimate state interest must encompass the interestsof members of the disadvantaged class and the community
at large, as well as the direct interests of the members of the
favored class. It must have a purpose or goal independentof the direct effect of the legislation and one " `that we may

reasonably presume to have motivated an impartial legisla-ture.' "

Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S.
432, 452, n. 4 (1985) (Stevens, J., concurring) (quoting
United States Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U. S.
166, 180-181 (1980) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment)).That a classification must find justification outside itself

saves judicial review of such classifications from becoming an
exercise in tautological reasoning.

"A State cannot deflect an equal protection challenge byobserving that in light of the statutory classification all

those within the burdened class are similarly situated.
The classification must reflect pre-existing differences;it cannot create new ones that are supported by only

their own bootstraps. `The Equal Protection Clauserequires more of a state law than nondiscriminatory
application within the class it establishes.' Rinaldi v.
Yeager, 384 U. S. 305, 308 (1966)." Williams v. Vermont, 472 U. S., at 27.

If the goal of the discriminatory classification is not independent from the policy itself, "each choice [of classification]will import its own goal, each goal will count as acceptable,

and the requirement of a `rational' choice-goal relation will
be satisfied by the very making of the choice." Ely, Legislative and Administrative Motivation in Constitutional Law, 79
Yale L. J. 1205, 1247 (1970).

A classification rationally furthers a state interest when
there is some fit between the disparate treatment and the
legislative purpose. As noted above, in the review of tax

statutes we have allowed such fit to be generous and approx-imate, recognizing that "rational distinctions may be made

with substantially less than mathematical exactitude." New
Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U. S. 297, 303 (1976). Nonetheless, in
some cases the underinclusiveness or the overinclusiveness
of a classification will be so severe that it cannot be said thatthe legislative distinction "rationally furthers" the posited

state interest.4 See, e. g., Jimenez v. Weinberger, 417 U. S.628, 636-638 (1974).

The Court's cursory analysis of Proposition 13 pays littleattention to either of these aspects of the controlling standard of review. The first state interest identified by theCourt is California's "interest in local neighborhood preservation, continuity, and stability." Ante, at 12 (citing Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365 (1926)).
It is beyond question that "inhibit[ing the] displacement of
lower income families by the forces of gentrification," ante,
at 12, is a legitimate state interest; the central issue is
whether the disparate treatment of earlier and later purchasers rationally furthers this goal. Here the Court offers not
an analysis, but only a conclusion: "By permitting older owners to pay progressively less in taxes than new owners of
comparable property, [Proposition 13] rationally furthers
this interest." Ibid.

I disagree. In my opinion, Proposition 13 sweeps too
broadly and operates too indiscriminately to "rationally further" the State's interest in neighborhood preservation. No
doubt there are some early purchasers living on fixed or limited incomes who could not afford to pay higher taxes and

still maintain their homes. California has enacted speciallegislation to respond to their plight.

5 Those concerns cannot provide an adequate justification for Proposition 13. Astatewide, across-the-board tax windfall for

all property
owners and their descendants is no more a "rational" means
for protecting this small subgroup than a blanket tax exemp-tion for all taxpayers named Smith would be a rational

means to protect a particular taxpayer named Smith whodemonstrated difficulty paying her tax bill.

Even within densely populated Los Angeles County, resi-dential property comprises less than half of the market value
of the property tax roll. App. 45. It cannot be said thatthe legitimate state interest in preserving neighborhood
character is "rationally furthered" by tax benefits for owners
of commercial, industrial, vacant, and other nonresidential
properties.6 It is just short of absurd to conclude that the
legitimate state interest in protecting a relatively small

5 As pointed out in the Commission Report, California has addressed
this specific problem with specific legislation. The State has established
two programs:

"Senior Citizens Property Tax Assistance. Provides refunds of up to
ninety-six percent of property taxes to low income homeowners over age
62. . . . . .

"Senior Citizens Property Tax Postponement. Allows senior citizens
with incomes under $20,000 to postpone all or part of the taxes on their
homes until an ownership change occurs." Commission Report 23.

6 The Court's rationale for upholding Proposition 13 does not even arguably apply to vacant property. That, as the Court recognizes, Proposition
13 discourages changes of ownership means that the law creates an impediment to the transfer and development of such property no matter how
socially desirable its improvement might be. It is equally plain that the
competitive advantage enjoyed by the Squires who own commercial property is wholly unjustified. There is no rational state interest in providing
those entrepreneurs with a special privilege that tends to discourage otherwise desirable transfers of income-producing property. In a free economy, the entry of new competitors should be encouraged, not arbitrarily
hampered by unfavorable tax treatment.

number of economically vulnerable families is "rationally furthered" by a tax windfall for all 9,787,887 property owners 7
in California.

The Court's conclusion is unsound not only because of the
lack of numerical fit between the posited state interest and
Proposition 13's inequities but also because of the lack of logical fit between ends and means. Although the State may
have a valid interest in preserving some neighborhoods,8
Proposition 13 not only "inhibit[s the] displacement" of settled families, it also inhibits the transfer of unimproved land,
abandoned buildings, and substandard uses. Thus, contrary
to the Court's suggestion, Proposition 13 is not like a zoning
system. A zoning system functions by recognizing different
uses of property and treating those different uses differently.
See Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S., at 388-390. Proposition 13 treats all property alike, giving all owners tax
breaks, and discouraging the transfer or improvement of all
property--the developed and the dilapidated, the neighborly
and the nuisance.

In short, although I agree with the Court that "neighborhood preservation" is a legitimate state interest, I cannot
agree that a tax windfall for all persons who purchased property before 1978 rationally furthers that interest. To my
mind, Proposition 13 is too blunt a tool to accomplish such a

7 Brief for California Assessors' Association as Amicus Curiae 2.
8 The ambiguous character of this interest is illustrated by the options

faced by a married couple that owns a three- or four-bedroom home that
suited their family needs while their children lived at home. After the
children have moved out, increased taxes and maintenance expenses
would--absent Proposition 13--tend to motivate the sale of the home to a
younger family needing a home of that size, or perhaps the rental of a
room or two to generate the income necessary to pay taxes. Proposition
13, however, subsidizes the wasteful retention of unused housing capacity,
making the sale of the home unwise and the rental of the extra space
unnecessary.

specialized goal. The severe inequalities created by Proposition 13 cannot be justified by such an interest.9

The second state interest identified by the Court is the
"reliance interests" of the earlier purchasers. Here I find
the Court's reasoning difficult to follow. Although the protection of reasonable reliance interests is a legitimate governmental purpose, see Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U. S. 728,
746 (1984), this case does not implicate such interests. A
reliance interest is created when an individual justifiably
acts under the assumption that an existing legal condition
will persist; thus reliance interests are most often implicated
when the government provides some benefit and then acts
to eliminate the benefit. See, e. g., New Orleans v. Dukes,
427 U. S. 297 (1976). In this case, those who purchased
property before Proposition 13 was enacted received no assurances that assessments would only increase at a limited
rate; indeed, to the contrary, many purchased property in
the hope that property values (and assessments) would appreciate substantially and quickly. It cannot be said, therefore, that the earlier purchasers of property somehow have
a reliance interest in limited tax increases.

Perhaps what the Court means is that post-Proposition 13
purchasers have less reliance interests than pre-Proposition

9 Respondents contend that the inequities created by Proposition 13 are
justified by the State's interest in protecting property owners from taxation on unrealized appreciation. The California Supreme Court relied on
a similar state interest. See Amador Valley Joint Union High School
Dist. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 22 Cal. 3d 208, 236-238, 583 P. 2d 1281,
1309-1311 (1978). This argument is closely related to the Court's reasoning concerning "neighborhood preservation"; respondents claim the State
has an interest in preventing the situation in which "skyrocketing real
estate prices . . . driv[e] property taxes beyond some taxpayers' ability to
pay." Brief for Respondents 19. As demonstrated above, whatever the
connection between acquisition price and "ability to pay," a blanket tax
windfall for all early purchasers of property (and their descendants) is
simply too overinclusive to "rationally further" the State's posited interest
in protecting vulnerable taxpayers.

13 purchasers. The Court reasons that the State may taxearlier and later purchasers differently because

"an existing owner rationally may be thought to havevested expectations in his property or home that are
more deserving of protection than the anticipatory ex-pectations of a new owner at the point of purchase. A
new owner has full information about the scope of futuretax liability before acquiring the property, and if he
thinks the future tax burden is too demanding, he candecide not to complete the purchase at all. By contrast,
the existing owner, already saddled with his purchase,does not have the option of deciding not to buy his home
if taxes become prohibitively high." Ante, at 12-13.10
This simply restates the effects of Proposition 13. A pre-Proposition 13 owner has "vested expectations" in reduced

taxes only because Proposition 13 gave her such expecta-tions; a later purchaser has no such expectations because
Proposition 13 does not provide her such expectations. Butthe same can be said of any arbitrary protection for an existing class of taxpayers. Consider a law that establishes thathomes with even street numbers would be taxed at twice the
rate of homes with odd street numbers. It is certainly truethat the even-numbered homeowners could not decide to "unpurchase" their homes and that those considering buying aneven-numbered home would know that it came with an extra
tax burden, but certainly that would not justify the arbitraryimposition of disparate tax burdens based on house numbers.
So it is in this case. Proposition 13 provides a benefit forearlier purchasers and imposes a burden on later purchasers.
To say that the later purchasers know what they are gettinginto does not answer the critical question: Is it reasonable

10 The Court's sympathetic reference to "existing owner[s] already saddled" with their property should not obscure the fact that these early
purchasers have already seen their property increase in value more than
tenfold.

and constitutional to tax early purchasers less than late pur-chasers when at the time of taxation their properties are

comparable? This question the Court does not answer.Distilled to its essence, the Court seems to be saying that
earlier purchasers can benefit under Proposition 13 because
earlier purchasers benefit under Proposition 13. If, how-ever, a law creates a disparity, the State's interest preserving that disparity cannot be a "legitimate state interest" jus-tifying that inequity. As noted above, a statute's disparate
treatment must be justified by a purpose distinct from thevery effects created by that statute. Thus, I disagree with
the Court that the severe inequities wrought by Proposition
13 can be justified by what the Court calls the "reliance interests" of those who benefit from that scheme.11

In my opinion, it is irrational to treat similarly situated
persons differently on the basis of the date they joined the
class of property owners. Until today, I would have thought
this proposition far from controversial. In Zobel v. Williams, 457 U. S. 55 (1982), we ruled that Alaska's program of
distributing cash dividends on the basis of the recipient's
years of residency in the State violated the Equal Protection

Court, contend that the inequities created by Proposition 13 are also justified by the State's interest in "permitting the taxpayer to make more
careful and accurate predictions of future tax liability." Amador Valley,
22 Cal. 3d, at 239, 583 P. 2d, at 1312. This analysis suffers from the same
infirmity as the Court's "reliance" analysis. I agree that Proposition 13
permits greater predictability of tax liability; the relevant question, however, is whether the inequities between earlier and later purchasers created by Proposition 13 can be justified by something other than the benefit
to the early purchasers. I do not believe that they can.

lic facilities, eligibility for student loans, for civil servicejobs, or for government contracts by length of domicile?

Could states impose different taxes based on length ofresidence? Alaska's reasoning could open the door to
state apportionment of other rights, benefits, and serv-ices according to length of residency. It would permit
the states to divide citizens into expanding numbersof permanent classes. Such a result would be clearly
impermissible." Id., at 64 (emphasis added) (footnotesomitted).

Similarly, the Court invalidated on equal protectiongrounds New Mexico's policy of providing a permanent tax
exemption for Vietnam veterans who had been state resi-dents before May 8, 1976, but not to more recent arrivals.
Hooper v. Bernalillo County Assessor, 472 U. S. 612 (1985).The Court expressly rejected the State's claim that it had a
legitimate interest in providing special rewards to veteranswho lived in the State before 1976 and concluded that "[n]either the Equal Protection Clause, nor this Court's prece-dents, permit the State to prefer established resident veterans over newcomers in the retroactive apportionment of aneconomic benefit." Id., at 623.

As these decisions demonstrate, the selective provision ofbenefits based on the timing of one's membership in a class
(whether that class be the class of residents or the classof property owners) is rarely a "legitimate state interest."
Similarly situated neighbors have an equal right to sharein the benefits of local government. It would obviously be
unconstitutional to provide one with more or better fire orpolice protection than the other; it is just as plainly unconstitutional to require one to pay five times as much in propertytaxes as the other for the same government services. In my
opinion, the severe inequalities created by Proposition 13 arearbitrary and unreasonable and do not rationally further a
legitimate state interest.Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

GEORGIA v. McCOLLUM et al.
certiorari to the supreme court of georgia
No. 91-372. Argued February 26, 1992--Decided June 18, 1992
Respondents, who are white, were charged with assaulting two AfricanAmericans. Before jury selection began, the trial judge denied the
prosecution's motion to prohibit respondents from exercising peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner. The Georgia Supreme Court affirmed, distinguishing Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete
Co., 500 U. S. 614--in which this Court held that private litigants cannot
exercise peremptory strikes in a racially discriminatory manner--on the
ground that it involved civil litigants rather than criminal defendants.

Held: The Constitution prohibits a criminal defendant from engaging in

purposeful discrimination on the ground of race in the exercise of peremptory challenges. Pp. 46-59.

(a) The exercise of racially discriminatory peremptory challenges offends the Equal Protection Clause when the offending challenges are
made by the State, Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79; Powers v. Ohio, 499
U. S. 400, and, in civil cases, when they are made by private litigants,
Edmonson, supra. Whether the prohibition should be extended to discriminatory challenges made by a criminal defendant turns upon the
following four-factor analysis. Pp. 46-48.

(b) A criminal defendant's racially discriminatory exercise of peremptory challenges inflicts the harms addressed by Batson. Regardless of
whether it is the State or the defense who invokes them, discriminatory
challenges harm the individual juror by subjecting him to open and public racial discrimination and harm the community by undermining public
confidence in this country's system of justice. Pp. 48-50.

(c) A criminal defendant's exercise of peremptory challenges constitutes state action for purposes of the Equal Protection Clause under the
analytical framework summarized in Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457
U. S. 922. Respondents' argument that the adversarial relationship between the defendant and the prosecution negates a peremptory challenge's governmental character is rejected. Unlike other actions taken
in support of a defendant's defense, the exercise of a peremptory challenge determines the composition of a governmental body. The fact
that a defendant exercises a peremptory challenge to further his interest in acquittal does not conflict with a finding of state action, since

43Cite as: 505 U. S. 42 (1992)
Syllabus
whenever a private actor's conduct is deemed fairly attributable to the
government, it is likely that private motives will have animated the
actor's decision. Pp. 50-55.

(d) The State has third-party standing to challenge a defendant's discriminatory use of peremptory challenges, since it suffers a concrete
injury when the fairness and the integrity of its own judicial process is
undermined; since, as the representative of all its citizens, it has a close
relation to potential jurors; and since the barriers to suit by an excluded
juror are daunting. See Powers, 499 U. S., at 411, 413, 414. Pp. 55-56.

(e) A prohibition against the discriminatory exercise of peremptory
challenges does not violate a criminal defendant's constitutional rights.
It is an affront to justice to argue that the right to a fair trial includes
the right to discriminate against a group of citizens based upon their
race. Nor does the prohibition violate the Sixth Amendment right to
the effective assistance of counsel, since counsel can normally explain
the reasons for peremptory challenges without revealing strategy or
confidential communication, and since neither the Sixth Amendment nor
the attorney-client privilege gives a defendant the right to carry out
through counsel an unlawful course of conduct. In addition, the prohibition does not violate the Sixth Amendment right to a trial by a jury
that is impartial with respect to both parties. Removing a juror whom
the defendant believes harbors racial prejudice is different from exercising a peremptory challenge to discriminate invidiously against jurors on
account of race. Pp. 57-59.

Justice Blackmun delivered the opinion of the Court.
For more than a century, this Court consistently and re-peatedly has reaffirmed that racial discrimination by the

State in jury selection offends the Equal Protection Clause.See,

e. g., Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303 (1880).Last Term this Court held that racial discrimination in a civil

litigant's exercise of peremptory challenges also violates theEqual Protection Clause. See Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U. S. 614 (1991). Today, we are asked to decidewhether the Constitution prohibits a

criminal defendantfrom engaging in purposeful racial discrimination in the

exercise of peremptory challenges.

I
On August 10, 1990, a grand jury sitting in DoughertyCounty, Ga., returned a six-count indictment charging respondents with aggravated assault and simple battery. SeeApp. 2. The indictment alleged that respondents beat and
assaulted Jerry and Myra Collins. Respondents are white;the alleged victims are African-Americans. Shortly after
the events, a leaflet was widely distributed in the localAfrican-American community reporting the assault and
urging community residents not to patronize respondents'business.

Before jury selection began, the prosecution moved to pro-hibit respondents from exercising peremptory challenges in

a racially discriminatory manner. The State explained thatit expected to show that the victims' race was a factor in the

alleged assault. According to the State, counsel for re-spondents had indicated a clear intention to use peremptory
strikes in a racially discriminatory manner, arguing that thecircumstances of their case gave them the right to exclude
African-American citizens from participating as jurors in thetrial. Observing that 43 percent of the county's population
is African-American, the State contended that, if a statis-tically representative panel is assembled for jury selection,
18 of the potential 42 jurors would be African-American.1With 20 peremptory challenges, respondents therefore would
be able to remove all the African-American potential jurors.2Relying on

Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986), the SixthAmendment, and the Georgia Constitution, the State sought

an order providing that, if it succeeded in making out a primafacie case of racial discrimination by respondents, the latter
would be required to articulate a racially neutral explanationfor peremptory challenges.

The trial judge denied the State's motion, holding that"[n]either Georgia nor federal law prohibits criminal defendants from exercising peremptory strikes in a racially dis-criminatory manner." App. 14. The issue was certified for
immediate appeal. Id., at 15 and 18.The Supreme Court of Georgia, by a 4-to-3 vote, affirmed
the trial court's ruling. 261 Ga. 473, 405 S. E. 2d 688 (1991).The court acknowledged that in Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U. S. 614 (1991), this Court had found that theexercise of a peremptory challenge in a racially discriminatory manner "would constitute an impermissible injury" tothe excluded juror. 261 Ga., at 473, 405 S.

Opinion of the Court
The court noted, however, that Edmonson involved privatecivil litigants, not criminal defendants. "Bearing in mind

the long history of jury trials as an essential element of theprotection of human rights," the court "decline[d] to diminish
the free exercise of peremptory strikes by a criminal defend-ant." 261 Ga., at 473, 405 S. E. 2d, at 689. Three justices
dissented, arguing that Edmonson and other decisions ofthis Court establish that racially based peremptory challenges by a criminal defendant violate the Constitution. 261Ga., at 473, 405 S. E. 2d, at 689 (Hunt, J.);

We granted certiorari to resolve a question left open byour prior cases--whether the Constitution prohibits a criminal defendant from engaging in purposeful racial discrimina-tion in the exercise of peremptory challenges.

3 502 U. S.

937 (1991). II

Over the last century, in an almost unbroken chain of deci-sions, this Court gradually has abolished race as a consideration for jury service. In Strauder v. West Virginia, 100U. S. 303 (1880), the Court invalidated a state statute providing that only white men could serve as jurors. While stat-ing that a defendant has no right to a "petit jury composed
in whole or in part of persons of his own race," id., at 305,the Court held that a defendant does have the right to be
tried by a jury whose members are selected by nondiscrimi-natory criteria. See also Neal v. Delaware, 103 U. S. 370,

3 The Ninth Circuit recently has prohibited criminal defendants from
exercising peremptory challenges on the basis of gender. United States
v. De Gross, 960 F. 2d 1433 (1992) (en banc). Although the panel decision
now has been vacated by the granting of rehearing en banc, a Fifth Circuit
panel has held that criminal defendants may not exercise peremptory
strikes in a racially discriminatory manner. See United States v. Greer,
939 F. 2d 1076, rehearing granted, 948 F. 2d 934 (1991).

397 (1881); Norris v. Alabama, 294 U. S. 587, 599 (1935)
(State cannot exclude African-Americans from jury venire
on false assumption that they, as a group, are not qualified
to serve as jurors).

In Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202 (1965), the Court was
confronted with the question whether an African-American
defendant was denied equal protection by the State's exercise of peremptory challenges to exclude members of his race
from the petit jury. Id., at 209-210. Although the Court
rejected the defendant's attempt to establish an equal protection claim premised solely on the pattern of jury strikes
in his own case, it acknowledged that proof of systematic
exclusion of African-Americans through the use of peremptories over a period of time might establish such a violation.
Id., at 224-228.

In Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986), the Court discarded Swain's evidentiary formulation. The Batson Court
held that a defendant may establish a prima facie case of
purposeful discrimination in selection of the petit jury based
solely on the prosecutor's exercise of peremptory challenges
at the defendant's trial. Id., at 87. "Once the defendant
makes a prima facie showing, the burden shifts to the State
to come forward with a neutral explanation for challenging
black jurors." Id., at 97.4

Last Term this Court applied the Batson framework in
two other contexts. In Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400 (1991),
it held that in the trial of a white criminal defendant, a prosecutor is prohibited from excluding African-American jurors

4 The Batson majority specifically reserved the issue before us today.
476 U. S., at 89, n. 12. The two Batson dissenters, however, argued that
the "clear and inescapable import" was that Batson would similarly limit
defendants. Id., at 125-126. Justice Marshall agreed, stating: "[O]ur
criminal justice system `requires not only freedom from any bias against
the accused, but also from any prejudice against his prosecution. Between him and the state the scales are to be evenly held.' Hayes v. Missouri, 120 U. S. 68, 70 (1887)." Id., at 107 (concurring opinion).

Opinion of the Court
on the basis of race. In Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co.,500 U. S. 614 (1991), the Court decided that in a civil case,

private litigants cannot exercise their peremptory strikes ina racially discriminatory manner.

5

In deciding whether the Constitution prohibits criminaldefendants from exercising racially discriminatory peremptory challenges, we must answer four questions. First,whether a criminal defendant's exercise of peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner inflicts the harmsaddressed by

Batson. Second, whether the exercise ofperemptory challenges by a criminal defendant constitutes

state action. Third, whether prosecutors have standing toraise this constitutional challenge. And fourth, whether the
constitutional rights of a criminal defendant nonetheless pre-clude the extension of our precedents to this case.

III

A

The majority in Powers recognized that "Batson `was de-signed "to serve multiple ends," ' only one of which was to

protect individual defendants from discrimination in the se-lection of jurors." 499 U. S., at 406. As in Powers and Edmonson, the extension of Batson in this context is designedto remedy the harm done to the "dignity of persons" and to
the "integrity of the courts." Powers, 499 U. S., at 402.As long ago as

Strauder, this Court recognized that deny-ing a person participation in jury service on account of his

race unconstitutionally discriminates against the excludedjuror. 100 U. S., at 308. See also Batson, 476 U. S., at 87.
While "[a]n individual juror does not have a right to sit onany particular petit jury, . . . he or she does possess the right
not to be excluded from one on account of race." Powers,

that decision logically must apply to defendants in criminal prosecutions.

Opinion of the Court
499 U. S., at 409. Regardless of who invokes the discrimina-tory challenge, there can be no doubt that the harm is the

same--in all cases, the juror is subjected to open and publicracial discrimination.

But "[t]he harm from discriminatory jury selection extends
beyond that inflicted on the defendant and the excluded jurorto touch the entire community."

Batson, 476 U. S., at 87.
One of the goals of our jury system is "to impress upon thecriminal defendant and the community as a whole that a verdict of conviction or acquittal is given in accordance withthe law by persons who are fair."

Powers, 499 U. S., at 413.
Selection procedures that purposefully exclude AfricanAmericans from juries undermine that public confidence--as
well they should. "The overt wrong, often apparent to the
entire jury panel, casts doubt over the obligation of the parties, the jury, and indeed the court to adhere to the law
throughout the trial of the cause." Id., at 412. See generally Underwood, Ending Race Discrimination in Jury Selection: Whose Right Is It, Anyway?, 92 Colum. L. Rev. 725,
748-750 (1992).

The need for public confidence is especially high in cases
involving race-related crimes. In such cases, emotions in
the affected community will inevitably be heated and volatile. Public confidence in the integrity of the criminal justice system is essential for preserving community peace in
trials involving race-related crimes. See Alschuler, The Supreme Court and the Jury: Voir Dire, Peremptory Challenges, and the Review of Jury Verdicts, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev.
153, 195-196 (1989) (describing two trials in Miami, Fla., in
which all African-American jurors were peremptorily struck
by white defendants accused of racial beating, and the public
outrage and riots that followed the defendants' acquittal).

"[B]e it at the hands of the State or the defense," if a court
allows jurors to be excluded because of group bias, "[it] is [a]
willing participant in a scheme that could only undermine
the very foundation of our system of justice--our citizens'

confidence in it." State v. Alvarado, 221 N. J. Super. 324,
328, 534 A. 2d 440, 442 (1987). Just as public confidence in
criminal justice is undermined by a conviction in a trial
where racial discrimination has occurred in jury selection, so
is public confidence undermined where a defendant, assisted
by racially discriminatory peremptory strikes, obtains an
acquittal.6

B

The fact that a defendant's use of discriminatory peremptory challenges harms the jurors and the community does
not end our equal protection inquiry. Racial discrimination,
although repugnant in all contexts, violates the Constitution
only when it is attributable to state action. See Moose
Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U. S. 163, 172 (1972). Thus, the
second question that must be answered is whether a criminal
defendant's exercise of a peremptory challenge constitutes
state action for purposes of the Equal Protection Clause.

Until Edmonson, the cases decided by this Court that presented the problem of racially discriminatory peremptory
challenges involved assertions of discrimination by a prosecutor, a quintessential state actor. In Edmonson, by contrast, the contested peremptory challenges were exercised
by a private defendant in a civil action. In order to determine whether state action was present in that setting, the

6 The experience of many state jurisdictions has led to the recognition
that a race-based peremptory challenge, regardless of who exercises it,
harms not only the challenged juror, but the entire community. Acting
pursuant to their state constitutions, state courts have ruled that criminal
defendants have no greater license to violate the equal protection rights
of prospective jurors than have prosecutors. See, e. g., State v. Levinson,
71 Haw. 492, 795 P. 2d 845 (1990); People v. Kern, 149 App. Div. 2d 187,
545 N. Y. S. 2d 4 (1989), aff'd, 75 N. Y. 2d 638, 555 N. Y. S. 2d 647 (1990);
State v. Alvarado, 221 N. J. Super. 324, 534 A. 2d 440 (1987); State v. Neil,
457 So. 2d 481 (Fla. 1984); Commonwealth v. Soares, 377 Mass. 461, 387

Opinion of the Court
Court in Edmonson used the analytical framework summa-rized in Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922 (1982).

7

The first inquiry is "whether the claimed [constitutional]deprivation has resulted from the exercise of a right or privilege having its source in state authority." Id., at 939."There can be no question" that peremptory challenges satisfy this first requirement, as they "are permitted only whenthe government, by statute or decisional law, deems it appropriate to allow parties to exclude a given number of personswho otherwise would satisfy the requirements for service on
the petit jury." Edmonson, 500 U. S., at 620. As in Edmonson, a Georgia defendant's right to exercise peremptorychallenges and the scope of that right are established by a

provision of state law. Ga. Code Ann. $ 15-12-165 (1990).The second inquiry is whether the private party charged
with the deprivation can be described as a state actor. See
Lugar, 457 U. S., at 941-942. In resolving that issue, theCourt in Edmonson found it useful to apply three principles:

(1) "the extent to which the actor relies on governmentalassistance and benefits"; (2) "whether the actor is performing
a traditional governmental function"; and (3) "whether theinjury caused is aggravated in a unique way by the incidents
of governmental authority." 500 U. S., at 621-622.As to the first principle, the

Edmonson Court found thatthe peremptory challenge system, as well as the jury system as a whole, "simply could not exist" without the "overt,significant participation of the government."

Id., at 622.Georgia provides for the compilation of jury lists by the

board of jury commissioners in each county and establishesthe general criteria for service and the sources for creating
a pool of qualified jurors representing a fair cross section ofthe community. Ga. Code Ann. $ 15-12-40. State law fur7 The Court in Lugar held that a private litigant is appropriately characterized as a state actor when he "jointly participates" with state officials
in securing the seizure of property in which the private party claims to
have rights. 457 U. S., at 932-933, 941-942.

52 GEORGIA v. McCOLLUM

Opinion of the Court
ther provides that jurors are to be selected by a specified
process, $ 15-12-42; they are to be summoned to court under
the authority of the State, $ 15-12-120; and they are to be
paid an expense allowance by the State whether or not they
serve on a jury, $ 15-12-9. At court, potential jurors are
placed in panels in order to facilitate examination by counsel,

$ 15-12-131; they are administered an oath, $ 15-12-132; they
are questioned on voir dire to determine whether they are
impartial, $ 15-12-164; and they are subject to challenge for
cause, $ 15-12-163.

In light of these procedures, the defendant in a Georgia
criminal case relies on "governmental assistance and benefits" that are equivalent to those found in the civil context
in Edmonson. "By enforcing a discriminatory peremptory
challenge, the Court `has . . . elected to place its power,
property and prestige behind the [alleged] discrimination.' "
Edmonson, 500 U. S., at 624 (citation omitted).

In regard to the second principle, the Court in Edmonson
found that peremptory challenges perform a traditional function of the government: "Their sole purpose is to permit
litigants to assist the government in the selection of an impartial trier of fact." Id., at 620. And, as the Edmonson
Court recognized, the jury system in turn "performs the critical governmental functions of guarding the rights of litigants and `ensur[ing] continued acceptance of the laws by all
of the people' " Id., at 624 (citation omitted). These same
conclusions apply with even greater force in the criminal context because the selection of a jury in a criminal case fulfills
a unique and constitutionally compelled governmental function. Compare Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145 (1968)
(making Sixth Amendment applicable to States through
Fourteenth Amendment), with Minneapolis & St. Louis R.
Co. v. Bombolis, 241 U. S. 211 (1916) (States do not have a
constitutional obligation to provide a jury trial in civil cases).
Cf. West v. Atkins, 487 U. S. 42, 53, n. 10, 57 (1988) (private

Opinion of the Court
physician hired by State to provide medical care to prisonerswas state actor because doctor was hired to fulfill State's

constitutional obligation to attend to necessary medical careof prison inmates). The State cannot avoid its constitutional
responsibilities by delegating a public function to privateparties. Cf.

Terry v. Adams, 345 U. S. 461 (1953) (privatepolitical party's determination of qualifications for primary

voters held to constitute state action).Finally, the Edmonson Court indicated that the courtroom
setting in which the peremptory challenge is exercised inten-sifies the harmful effects of the private litigant's discriminatory act and contributes to its characterization as state ac-tion. These concerns are equally present in the context of
a criminal trial. Regardless of who precipitated the jurors'removal, the perception and the reality in a criminal trial
will be that the court has excused jurors based on race, anoutcome that will be attributed to the State.

8

Respondents nonetheless contend that the adversarial re-lationship between the defendant and the prosecution negates the governmental character of the peremptory chal-lenge. Respondents rely on

Polk County v. Dodson, 454U. S. 312 (1981), in which a defendant sued, under 42 U. S. C.

$ 1983, the public defender who represented him. The de-fendant claimed that the public defender had violated his
constitutional rights in failing to provide adequate represen-tation. This Court determined that a public defender does
not qualify as a state actor when engaged in his general rep-resentation of a criminal defendant.

9

8 Indeed, it is common practice not to reveal the identity of the challenging party to the jurors and potential jurors, thus enhancing the perception
that it is the court that has rejected them. See Underwood, Ending Race
Discrimination in Jury Selection: Whose Right Is It, Anyway?, 92 Colum.
L. Rev. 725, 751, n. 117 (1992).

9 Although Polk County determined whether or not the public defender's actions were under color of state law, as opposed to whether or not
they constituted state action, this Court subsequently has held that the

54 GEORGIA v. McCOLLUM

Opinion of the Court
Polk County did not hold that the adversarial relationshipof a public defender with the State precludes a finding

of state action--it held that this adversarial relationshipprevented the attorney's public employment from alone
being sufficient to support a finding of state action. In-stead, the determination whether a public defender is a state
actor for a particular purpose depends on the nature andcontext of the function he is performing. For example, in
Branti v. Finkel, 445 U. S. 507 (1980), this Court held thata public defender, in making personnel decisions on behalf
of the State, is a state actor who must comply with consti-tutional requirements. And the

Polk County Court itselfnoted, without deciding, that a public defender may act

under color of state law while performing certain administra-tive, and possibly investigative, functions. See 454 U. S., at
325.The exercise of a peremptory challenge differs significantly from other actions taken in support of a defendant'sdefense. In exercising a peremptory challenge, a criminal
defendant is wielding the power to choose a quintessentialgovernmental body--indeed, the institution of government
on which our judicial system depends. Thus, as we held inEdmonson, when "a government confers on a private body
the power to choose the government's employees or officials,the private body will be bound by the constitutional mandate
of race neutrality." 500 U. S., at 625.Lastly, the fact that a defendant exercises a peremptory
challenge to further his interest in acquittal does not conflictwith a finding of state action. Whenever a private actor's
conduct is deemed "fairly attributable" to the government, itis likely that private motives will have animated the actor's
decision. Indeed, in Edmonson, the Court recognized thatthe private party's exercise of peremptory challenges constitwo inquiries are the same, see, e. g., Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U. S. 830,
838 (1982), and has specifically extended Polk County's reasoning to stateaction cases, see Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U. S. 991, 1009, n. 20 (1982).

tuted state action, even though the motive underlying theexercise of the peremptory challenge may be to protect a

private interest. See id., at 626.10

C
Having held that a defendant's discriminatory exercise ofa peremptory challenge is a violation of equal protection, we

move to the question whether the State has standing to chal-lenge a defendant's discriminatory use of peremptory challenges. In Powers, 499 U. S., at 416, this Court held thata white criminal defendant has standing to raise the equal
protection rights of black jurors wrongfully excluded fromjury service. While third-party standing is a limited exception, the Powers Court recognized that a litigant may raisea claim on behalf of a third party if the litigant can demonstrate that he has suffered a concrete injury, that he has aclose relation to the third party, and that there exists some
hindrance to the third party's ability to protect its own in-terests.

Id., at 411. In Edmonson, the Court applied thesame analysis in deciding that civil litigants had standing to

raise the equal protection rights of jurors excluded on thebasis of their race.

In applying the first prong of its standing analysis, the
Powers Court found that a criminal defendant suffered cog10 Numerous commentators similarly have concluded that a defendant's
exercise of peremptory challenges constitutes state action. See generally
Alschuler, The Supreme Court and the Jury: Voir Dire, Peremptory Challenges, and the Review of Jury Verdicts, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 153, 197-198

Opinion of the Court
nizable injury "because racial discrimination in the selection
of jurors `casts doubt on the integrity of the judicial process,'
and places the fairness of a criminal proceeding in doubt."
499 U. S., at 411 (citation omitted). In Edmonson, this
Court found that these harms were not limited to the criminal sphere. 500 U. S., at 630. Surely, a State suffers a similar injury when the fairness and integrity of its own judicial
process is undermined.

In applying the second prong of its standing analysis, the
Powers Court held that voir dire permits a defendant to
"establish a relation, if not a bond of trust, with the jurors,"
a relation that "continues throughout the entire trial." 499
U. S., at 413. "Exclusion of a juror on the basis of race
severs that relation in an invidious way." Edmonson, 500
U. S., at 629.

The State's relation to potential jurors in this case is closer
than the relationships approved in Powers and Edmonson.
As the representative of all its citizens, the State is the logical and proper party to assert the invasion of the constitutional rights of the excluded jurors in a criminal trial. Indeed, the Fourteenth Amendment forbids the State to deny
persons within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the
laws.

In applying the final prong of its standing analysis, the
Powers Court recognized that, although individuals excluded
from jury service on the basis of race have a right to bring
suit on their own behalf, the "barriers to a suit by an excluded juror are daunting." 499 U. S., at 414. See also
Edmonson, 500 U. S., at 629. The barriers are no less formidable in this context. See Note, Discrimination by the Defense: Peremptory Challenges after Batson v. Kentucky, 88
Colum. L. Rev. 355, 367 (1988); Underwood, 92 Colum. L.
Rev., at 757 (summarizing barriers to suit by excluded juror).
Accordingly, we hold that the State has standing to assert
the excluded jurors' rights.

Opinion of the Court

D
The final question is whether the interests served by Batson must give way to the rights of a criminal defendant. As
a preliminary matter, it is important to recall that peremptory challenges are not constitutionally protected fundamental rights; rather, they are but one state-created means to
the constitutional end of an impartial jury and a fair trial.
This Court repeatedly has stated that the right to a peremptory challenge may be withheld altogether without impairing
the constitutional guarantee of an impartial jury and a fair
trial. See Frazier v. United States, 335 U. S. 497, 505, n. 11
(1948); United States v. Wood, 299 U. S. 123, 145 (1936); Stilson v. United States, 250 U. S. 583, 586 (1919); see also Swain,
380 U. S., at 219.

Yet in Swain, the Court reviewed the "very old credentials," id., at 212, of the peremptory challenge and noted the
"long and widely held belief that the peremptory challenge
is a necessary part of trial by jury," id., at 219; see id., at
212-219. This Court likewise has recognized that "the role
of litigants in determining the jury's composition provides
one reason for wide acceptance of the jury system and of its
verdicts." Edmonson, 500 U. S., at 630.

We do not believe that this decision will undermine the
contribution of the peremptory challenge to the administration of justice. Nonetheless, "if race stereotypes are the
price for acceptance of a jury panel as fair," we reaffirm
today that such a "price is too high to meet the standard of
the Constitution." Id., at 630. Defense counsel is limited
to "legitimate, lawful conduct." Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U. S.
157, 166 (1986) (defense counsel does not render ineffective
assistance when he informs his client that he would disclose
the client's perjury to the court and move to withdraw from
representation). It is an affront to justice to argue that a
fair trial includes the right to discriminate against a group
of citizens based upon their race.

58 GEORGIA v. McCOLLUM

Opinion of the Court
Nor does a prohibition of the exercise of discriminatoryperemptory challenges violate a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel. Counselcan ordinarily explain the reasons for peremptory challenges
without revealing anything about trial strategy or any confidential client communications. In the rare case in whichthe explanation for a challenge would entail confidential communications or reveal trial strategy, an in camera discussioncan be arranged. See

United States v. Zolin, 491 U. S. 554
(1989); cf. Batson, 476 U. S., at 97 (expressing confidence thattrial judges can develop procedures to implement the Court's

holding). In any event, neither the Sixth Amendment right
nor the attorney-client privilege gives a criminal defendant
the right to carry out through counsel an unlawful course of
conduct. See Nix, 475 U. S., at 166; Zolin, 491 U. S., at 562-
563. See Swift, Defendants, Racism and the Peremptory
Challenge, 22 Colum. Hum. Rights L. Rev. 177, 207-208
(1991).

Lastly, a prohibition of the discriminatory exercise of
peremptory challenges does not violate a defendant's Sixth
Amendment right to a trial by an impartial jury. The goal
of the Sixth Amendment is "jury impartiality with respect
to both contestants." Holland v. Illinois, 493 U. S. 474, 483
(1990). See also Hayes v. Missouri, 120 U. S. 68 (1887).

We recognize, of course, that a defendant has the right to
an impartial jury that can view him without racial animus,
which so long has distorted our system of criminal justice.
We have, accordingly, held that there should be a mechanism
for removing those on the venire whom the defendant has
specific reason to believe would be incapable of confronting
and suppressing their racism. See Ham v. South Carolina,
409 U. S. 524, 526-527 (1973); Rosales-Lopez v. United States,
451 U. S. 182, 189-190 (1981) (plurality opinion of White, J.).
Cf. Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U. S. 719 (1992) (exclusion of juror
in capital trial is permissible upon showing that juror is incapable of considering sentences other than death).

Rehnquist, C. J., concurring
But there is a distinction between exercising a peremptory
challenge to discriminate invidiously against jurors on account of race and exercising a peremptory challenge to remove an individual juror who harbors racial prejudice. This
Court firmly has rejected the view that assumptions of partiality based on race provide a legitimate basis for disqualifying a person as an impartial juror. As this Court stated just
last Term in Powers, "[w]e may not accept as a defense to
racial discrimination the very stereotype the law condemns."
499 U. S., at 410. "In our heterogeneous society policy as
well as constitutional considerations militate against the divisive assumption--as a per se rule--that justice in a court
of law may turn upon the pigmentation of skin, the accident
of birth, or the choice of religion." Ristaino v. Ross, 424
U. S. 589, 596, n. 8 (1976). We therefore reaffirm today that
the exercise of a peremptory challenge must not be based on
either the race of the juror or the racial stereotypes held by
the party.

IV

We hold that the Constitution prohibits a criminal defendant from engaging in purposeful discrimination on the
ground of race in the exercise of peremptory challenges.
Accordingly, if the State demonstrates a prima facie case of
racial discrimination by the defendants, the defendants must
articulate a racially neutral explanation for peremptory challenges. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia is
reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, concurring.
I was in dissent in Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co.,
500 U. S. 614 (1991), and continue to believe that case to have

Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.
As a matter of first impression, I think that I would haveshared the view of the dissenting opinions: A criminal defendant's use of peremptory strikes cannot violate the Fourteenth Amendment because it does not involve state action.Yet, I agree with the Court and

The Chief Justice that
our decision last Term in Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete
Co., 500 U. S. 614 (1991), governs this case and requires the
opposite conclusion. Because the respondents do not ques-tion

Edmonson, I believe that we must accept its consequences. I therefore concur in the judgment reversing theGeorgia Supreme Court.

I write separately to express my general dissatisfaction
with our continuing attempts to use the Constitution to regulate peremptory challenges. See, e. g., Batson v. Kentucky,
476 U. S. 79 (1986); Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400 (1991); Edmonson, supra. In my view, by restricting a criminal defendant's use of such challenges, this case takes us further
from the reasoning and the result of Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303 (1880). I doubt that this departure will
produce favorable consequences. On the contrary, I am certain that black criminal defendants will rue the day that this
Court ventured down this road that inexorably will lead to
the elimination of peremptory strikes.

In Strauder, as the Court notes, we invalidated a state law
that prohibited blacks from serving on juries. In the course
of the decision, we observed that the racial composition of a
jury may affect the outcome of a criminal case. We explained: "It is well known that prejudices often exist against
particular classes in the community, which sway the judgment of jurors, and which, therefore, operate in some cases
to deny to persons of those classes the full enjoyment of that
protection which others enjoy." Id., at 309. We thus recog505us1$95H 07-15-96 22:54:55 PAGES OPINPGT

nized, over a century ago, the precise point that Justice
O'Connor makes today. Simply stated, securing represen-tation of the defendant's race on the jury may help to overcome racial bias and provide the defendant with a betterchance of having a fair trial.

Post, at 68-69.I do not think that this basic premise of

Strauder has be-come obsolete. The public, in general, continues to believe

that the makeup of juries can matter in certain instances.Consider, for example, how the press reports criminal trials.
Major newspapers regularly note the number of whites andblacks that sit on juries in important cases.

1 Their editors

and readers apparently recognize that conscious and uncon-scious prejudice persists in our society and that it may influence some juries. Common experience and common senseconfirm this understanding.

In Batson, however, this Court began to depart from
Strauder by holding that, without some actual showing, sup-positions about the possibility that jurors may harbor prejudice have no legitimacy. We said, in particular, that a prose-cutor could not justify peremptory strikes "by stating
merely that he challenged jurors of the defendant's race onthe assumption--or his intuitive judgment--that they would
be partial to the defendant because of their shared race."476 U. S., at 97. As noted, however, our decision in

Strauderrested on precisely such an "assumption" or "intuition." We

reasonably surmised, without direct evidence in any particu-lar case, that all-white juries might judge black defendants
unfairly.Our departure from Strauder has two negative consequences. First, it produces a serious misordering of ourpriorities. In

Strauder, we put the rights of defendantsforemost. Today's decision, while protecting jurors, leaves

defendants with less means of protecting themselves. Un1 A computer search, for instance, reveals that the phrase "all white
jury" has appeared over 200 times in the past five years in the New York
Times, Chicago Tribune, and Los Angeles Times.

O'Connor, J., dissenting
less jurors actually admit prejudice during voir dire, defend-ants generally must allow them to sit and run the risk that

racial animus will affect the verdict. Cf. Fed. Rule Evid.606(b) (generally excluding juror testimony after trial to impeach the verdict). In effect, we have exalted the right ofcitizens to sit on juries over the rights of the criminal defendant, even though it is the defendant, not the jurors, who facesimprisonment or even death. At a minimum, I think that
this inversion of priorities should give us pause.Second, our departure from

Strauder has taken us down aslope of inquiry that had no clear stopping point. Today,

we decide only that white defendants may not strike blackveniremen on the basis of race. Eventually, we will have to
decide whether black defendants may strike white venire-men.

2 See, e. g., State v. Carr, 261 Ga. 845, 413 S. E. 2d 192

(1992). Next will come the question whether defendantsmay exercise peremptories on the basis of sex. See,

e. g.,United States v. De Gross, 960 F. 2d 1433 (CA9 1992). The

consequences for defendants of our decision and of these fu-ture cases remain to be seen. But whatever the benefits
were that this Court perceived in a criminal defendant's hav-ing members of his class on the jury, see Strauder, 100 U. S.,
at 309-310, they have evaporated.

Justice O'Connor, dissenting.
The Court reaches the remarkable conclusion that criminaldefendants being prosecuted by the State act on behalf of

their adversary when they exercise peremptory challengesduring jury selection. The Court purports merely to follow

2 The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., has submitted
a brief arguing, in all sincerity, that "whether white defendants can use
peremptory challenges to purge minority jurors presents quite different
issues from whether a minority defendant can strike majority group jurors." Brief for NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., as
Amicus Curiae 3-4. Although I suppose that this issue technically remains open, it is difficult to see how the result could be different if the
defendants here were black.

precedents, but our cases do not compel this perverse result.To the contrary, our decisions specifically establish that criminal defendants and their lawyers are not government actorswhen they perform traditional trial functions.

I
It is well and properly settled that the Constitution's equalprotection guarantee forbids prosecutors to exercise peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory fashion. See
Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986); Powers v. Ohio, 499U. S. 400, 409 (1991). The Constitution, however, affords

no similar protection against private action. "Embedded inour Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence is a dichotomy
between state action, which is subject to scrutiny under theAmendmen[t] . . . , and private conduct, against which the
Amendment affords no shield, no matter how unfair that con-duct may be."

National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Tar-kanian, 488 U. S. 179, 191 (1988) (footnote omitted). This

distinction appears on the face of the Fourteenth Amend-ment, which provides that "No State shall . . . deny to any
person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of thelaws." U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, $ 1 (emphasis added). The
critical but straightforward question this case presents iswhether criminal defendants and their lawyers, when exercising peremptory challenges as part of a defense, are stateactors.

In Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922 (1982), theCourt developed a two-step approach to identifying state
action in cases such as this. First, the Court will ask"whether the claimed deprivation has resulted from the exercise of a right or privilege having its source in state au-thority." Id., at 939. Next, it will decide whether, on the
particular facts at issue, the parties who allegedly caused thedeprivation of a federal right can "appropriately" and "in all
fairness" be characterized as state actors. Ibid.; Edmonsonv. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U. S. 614, 620 (1991). The

O'Connor, J., dissenting
Court's determination in this case that the peremptory chal-lenge is a creation of state authority,

ante, at 51, breaks no
new ground. See Edmonson, supra, at 620-621. But dis-posing of this threshold matter leaves the Court with the

task of showing that criminal defendants who exercise peremptories should be deemed governmental actors. Whatour cases require, and what the Court neglects, is a realistic

appraisal of the relationship between defendants and thegovernment that has brought them to trial.

We discussed that relationship in Polk County v. Dodson,454 U. S. 312 (1981), which held that a public defender does
not act "under color of state law" for purposes of 42 U. S. C.

$ 1983 "when performing a lawyer's traditional functions as
counsel to a defendant in a criminal proceeding." 454 U. S.,
at 325. We began our analysis by explaining that a public
defender's obligations toward her client are no different than
the obligations of any other defense attorney. Id., at 318.
These obligations preclude attributing the acts of defense
lawyers to the State: "[T]he duties of a defense lawyer are
those of a personal counselor and advocate. It is often said
that lawyers are `officers of the court.' But the Courts of
Appeals are agreed that a lawyer representing a client is
not, by virtue of being an officer of the court, a state
actor . . . ." Ibid.

We went on to stress the inconsistency between our adversarial system of justice and theories that would make defense lawyers state actors. "In our system," we said, "a
defense lawyer characteristically opposes the designated
representatives of the State." Ibid. This adversarial posture rests on the assumption that a defense lawyer best
serves the public "not by acting on behalf of the State or in
concert with it, but rather by advancing `the undivided interests of his client.' " Id., at 318-319 (quoting Ferri v. Ackerman, 444 U. S. 193, 204 (1979)). Moreover, we pointed out
that the independence of defense attorneys from state control has a constitutional dimension. Gideon v. Wainwright,

505us1$95H 07-15-96 22:54:55 PAGES OPINPGT

65Cite as: 505 U. S. 42 (1992)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
372 U. S. 335 (1963), "established the right of state criminaldefendants to the guiding hand of counsel at every step in

the proceedings against [them]." 454 U. S., at 322 (internalquotation marks omitted). Implicit in this right "is the assumption that counsel will be free of state control. There
can be no fair trial unless the accused receives the servicesof an effective and independent advocate."

Ibid. Thus, the
defense's freedom from state authority is not just empiricallytrue, but is a constitutionally mandated attribute of our adversarial system.Because this Court deems the "under color of state law"
requirement that was not satisfied in Dodson identical to
the Fourteenth Amendment's state action requirement, see
Lugar, supra, at 929, the holding of Dodson simply cannot
be squared with today's decision. In particular, Dodson
cannot be explained away as a case concerned exclusively
with the employment status of public defenders. See ante,
at 54. The Dodson Court reasoned that public defenders
performing traditional defense functions are not state actors
because they occupy the same position as other defense attorneys in relevant respects. 454 U. S., at 319-325. This
reasoning followed on the heels of a critical determination:
Defending an accused "is essentially a private function," not
state action. Id., at 319. The Court's refusal to acknowledge Dodson's initial holding, on which the entire opinion
turned, will not make that holding go away.

The Court also seeks to evade Dodson's logic by spinning
out a theory that defendants and their lawyers transmogrify
from government adversaries into state actors when they
exercise a peremptory challenge, and then change back to
perform other defense functions. See ante, at 54. Dodson,
however, established that even though public defenders
might act under color of state law when carrying out administrative or investigative functions outside a courtroom, they
are not vested with state authority "when performing a lawyer's traditional functions as counsel to a defendant in a

criminal proceeding." 454 U. S., at 325. Since making pe-remptory challenges plainly qualifies as a "traditional function" of criminal defense lawyers, see Swain v. Alabama, 380U. S. 202, 212-219 (1965);

Lewis v. United States, 146 U. S.
370, 376 (1892), Dodson forecloses the Court's functional
analysis.Even aside from our prior rejection of it, the Court's functional theory fails. "[A] State normally can be held respon-sible for a private decision only when it has exercised coercive power or has provided such significant encouragement. . . that the choice must in law be deemed to be that of the
State." Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U. S. 991, 1004 (1982). Thus,
a private party's exercise of choice allowed by state law does
not amount to state action for purposes of the Fourteenth
Amendment so long as "the initiative comes from [the private party] and not from the State." Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U. S. 345, 357 (1974). See Flagg Bros.,
Inc. v. Brooks, 436 U. S. 149, 165 (1978) (State not responsible
for a decision it "permits but does not compel"). The government in no way influences the defense's decision to use a
peremptory challenge to strike a particular juror. Our adversarial system of criminal justice and the traditions of the
peremptory challenge vest the decision to strike a juror entirely with the accused. A defendant "may, if he chooses,
peremptorily challenge `on his own dislike, without showing
any cause;' he may exercise that right without reason or for
no reason, arbitrarily and capriciously." Pointer v. United
States, 151 U. S. 396, 408 (1894) (quoting 1 E. Coke, Institutes
156b (19th ed. 1832)). "The essential nature of the peremptory challenge is that it is one exercised without a reason
stated, without inquiry and without being subject to the
court's control." Swain, supra, at 220. See Dodson, supra,
at 321-322; Lewis, supra, at 376, 378.

Certainly, Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co. did not render Dodson and its realistic approach to the state action inquiry dead letters. The Edmonson Court distinguished

O'Connor, J., dissenting
Dodson by saying: "In the ordinary context of civil litigationin which the government is not a party, an adversarial relation does not exist between the government and a privatelitigant. In the jury selection process, the government and
private litigants work for the same end." Edmonson, 500
U. S., at 627. While the nonpartisan administrative inter-ests of the State and the partisan interests of private litigants may not be at odds during civil jury selection, the samecannot be said of the partisan interests of the State and the
defendant during jury selection in a criminal trial. A pri-vate civil litigant opposes a private counterpart, but a criminal defendant is by design in an adversarial relationship with
the government. Simply put, the defendant seeks to strike
jurors predisposed to convict, while the State seeks to strike
jurors predisposed to acquit. The Edmonson Court clearly
recognized this point when it limited the statement that "an
adversarial relation does not exist between the government
and a private litigant" to "the ordinary context of civil litigation in which the government is not a party." Ibid. (emphasis added).

From arrest, to trial, to possible sentencing and punishment, the antagonistic relationship between government and
the accused is clear for all to see. Rather than squarely facing this fact, the Court, as in Edmonson, rests its finding of
governmental action on the points that defendants exercise
peremptory challenges in a courtroom and judges alter the
composition of the jury in response to defendants' choices.
I found this approach wanting in the context of civil controversies between private litigants, for reasons that need not
be repeated here. See id., at 632 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).
But even if I thought Edmonson was correctly decided, I
could not accept today's simplistic extension of it. Dodson
makes clear that the unique relationship between criminal
defendants and the State precludes attributing defendants'
actions to the State, whatever is the case in civil trials.
How could it be otherwise when the underlying question is

O'Connor, J., dissenting
whether the accused "c[an] be described in all fairness as astate actor"? 500 U. S., at 620. As Dodson accords with

our state action jurisprudence and with common sense, Iwould honor it.

II
What really seems to bother the Court is the prospect thatleaving criminal defendants and their attorneys free to make

racially motivated peremptory challenges will undermine theideal of nondiscriminatory jury selection we espoused in
Batson, 476 U. S., at 85-88. The concept that the govern-ment alone must honor constitutional dictates, however, is a
fundamental tenet of our legal order, not an obstacle to becircumvented. This is particularly so in the context of criminal trials, where we have held the prosecution to uniquelyhigh standards of conduct. See Brady v. Maryland, 373
U. S. 83 (1963) (disclosure of evidence favorable to the ac-cused);

Berger v. United States, 295 U. S. 78, 88 (1935) ("The[prosecutor] is the representative not of an ordinary party to

a controversy, but of a sovereignty . . . whose interest . . . ina criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that
justice shall be done").Considered in purely pragmatic terms, moreover, the
Court's holding may fail to advance nondiscriminatory crimi-nal justice. It is by now clear that conscious and unconscious racism can affect the way white jurors perceive minor-ity defendants and the facts presented at their trials,
perhaps determining the verdict of guilt or innocence. SeeDevelopments in the Law--Race and the Criminal Process,
101 Harv. L. Rev. 1472, 1559-1560 (1988); Colbert, Challeng-ing the Challenge: Thirteenth Amendment as a Prohibition
against the Racial Use of Peremptory Challenges, 76 CornellL. Rev. 1, 110-112 (1990). Using peremptory challenges to
secure minority representation on the jury may help to over-come such racial bias, for there is substantial reason to believe that the distorting influence of race is minimized on aracially mixed jury. See id., at 112-115; Developments in

minority defendant's trial may turn on the misconceptions orbiases of white jurors, there is cause to question the implications of this Court's good intentions.That the Constitution does not give federal judges the
reach to wipe all marks of racism from every courtroom inthe land is frustrating, to be sure. But such limitations are
the necessary and intended consequence of the Fourteenth
Amendment's state action requirement. Because I cannotaccept the Court's conclusion that government is responsible

for decisions criminal defendants make while fighting stateprosecution, I respectfully dissent.

Syllabus

KRAFT GENERAL FOODS, INC. v. IOWA DEPART-MENT OF REVENUE AND FINANCE

certiorari to the supreme court of iowa
No. 90-1918. Argued April 22, 1992--Decided June 18, 1992
The Iowa statute that imposes a business tax on corporations uses the

federal tax code's definition of "net income" with certain adjustments.
Like the federal scheme, Iowa allows corporations to take a deduction
for dividends received from domestic, but not foreign, subsidiaries. However, unlike the federal scheme, Iowa does not allow a credit for taxes
paid to foreign countries. Petitioner Kraft General Foods, Inc., a unitary business with operations in the United States and several foreign
countries, deducted its foreign subsidiary dividends from its taxable income on its 1981 Iowa return, notwithstanding the contrary provisions
of Iowa law. Respondent Iowa Department of Revenue and Finance
(Iowa) assessed a deficiency, which Kraft challenged in administrative
proceedings and subsequently in Iowa courts. The Iowa Supreme
Court rejected Kraft's argument that the disparate treatment of domestic and foreign subsidiary dividends violated the Commerce Clause of
the Federal Constitution, holding that Kraft failed to demonstrate that
the taxing scheme gave Iowa businesses a commercial advantage over
foreign commerce.

Held: The Iowa statute facially discriminates against foreign commerce in

violation of the Foreign Commerce Clause. It is indisputable that the
statute treats dividends received from foreign subsidiaries less favorably than those received from domestic subsidiaries by including the
former, but not the latter, in taxable income. None of the several arguments made by Iowa and its amici--that, since a corporation's domicile
does not necessarily establish that it is engaged in either foreign or
domestic commerce, the disparate treatment is not discrimination based
on the business activity's location or nature; that a taxpayer can avoid
the discrimination by changing a subsidiary's domicile from a foreign to
a domestic location; that the statute does not treat Iowa subsidiaries
more favorably than those located elsewhere; that the benefit to domestic subsidiaries might be offset by the taxes imposed on them by other
States and the Federal Government; and that the statute is intended
to promote administrative convenience rather than economic protectionism--justifies Iowa's differential treatment of foreign commerce.

Opinion of the Court
the dividends that a corporation receives from its foreignsubsidiaries, Iowa does not tax dividends received from domestic subsidiaries. The question presented is whether thedisparate treatment of dividends from foreign and from domestic subsidiaries violates the Foreign Commerce Clause.3

I
The Iowa statute uses the federal definition of "net income" with certain adjustments.4 For federal tax purposes,corporations are generally allowed a deduction for dividends

received from domestic subsidiaries.5 As the earnings ofthe domestic subsidiaries, themselves, are subject to federal
taxation, this deduction avoids a second federal tax on those
earnings.6 The Federal Government generally does not taxthe earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and the dividends paid

by foreign subsidiaries are not deductible. The parent corporation, however, does receive a credit for the foreign taxes
paid on the dividends and on the underlying foreign earnings.7 Like the deduction for domestic subsidiary dividends,
the foreign tax credit is intended to mitigate multiple taxation of corporate earnings.8

74 KRAFT GEN. FOODS, INC. v. IOWA DEPT. OF

REVENUE AND FINANCE

Opinion of the Court

In following the federal scheme for the calculation of taxable income, Iowa allows a deduction for dividends received
from domestic subsidiaries, but not for those received from
foreign subsidiaries. Iowa does not directly tax the income
of a subsidiary unless the subsidiary, itself, does business
in Iowa.9 Thus, if a domestic subsidiary transacts business
in Iowa, its income is taxed, but if it does not do business in
Iowa, neither its income nor the dividends paid to its parent
are taxed. In the case of the foreign subsidiary doing business abroad, Iowa does not tax the corporate income, but
does tax the dividends paid to the parent.10 Unlike the
Federal Government, Iowa does not allow a credit for taxes
paid to foreign countries. See 465 N. W. 2d 664, 665 (Iowa
1991).11

In computing its taxable income on its 1981 Iowa return,
Kraft deducted foreign subsidiary dividends, notwithstanding contrary provisions of Iowa law.12 Respondent Iowa
Department of Revenue and Finance (Iowa) assessed a defi9 Iowa is not a State that taxes an apportioned share of the entire income
of a unitary business, without regard for formal corporate lines. See Tr.
of Oral Arg. 37; cf. Container Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax Bd., 463
U. S. 159, 164-169 (1983).

10 At oral argument, counsel for Kraft offered the following illustration:

"If an Iowa parent company had a Kentucky subsidiary, [that] did all its
business in Kentucky, and another subsidiary that did all its business in
Germany, Iowa would not tax the income of either of those subsidiaries.
If each paid a dividend to the Iowa parent, Iowa would tax the German
dividends and would not tax the Kentucky dividends." Tr. of Oral Arg.
47-48.

11 If in calculating its federal tax liability, a taxpayer elects to deduct

foreign tax withheld on foreign subsidiary dividends, a taxpayer may also
deduct these tax payments in calculating its Iowa taxes. Electing the
deduction, then, allows the taxpayer to reduce, but not eliminate, the Iowa
tax on foreign subsidiary dividends. In the relevant year, Kraft elected
to take the foreign tax credit, see 465 N. W. 2d, at 666, and thus could not
deduct the foreign taxes in computing its federal or Iowa taxable income,
see n. 7, supra.

Opinion of the Court
ciency. After its administrative protest was denied,13 Kraftchallenged the assessment in Iowa courts, alleging that the

disparate treatment of domestic and foreign subsidiary divi-dends violated the Commerce Clause and the Equal Protection Clause 14 of the Federal Constitution. The Iowa Su-preme Court rejected the Commerce Clause claim because
petitioner failed to demonstrate "that Iowa businesses receive a commercial advantage over foreign commerce due toIowa's taxing scheme."

Id., at 668. In considering Kraft's
challenge under the Equal Protection Clause, the court foundthat Iowa's use of the federal formula for calculation of taxable income was convenient both for the taxpayer and forthe State. Concluding that the Iowa statute was rationally
related to the goal of administrative efficiency, the IowaSupreme Court held that the statute did not violate equal
protection. Id., at 669. We granted certiorari. 502 U. S.
1056 (1992). II

The principal dispute between the parties concerns
whether, on its face, the Iowa statute discriminates against
foreign commerce. It is indisputable that the Iowa statutetreats dividends received from foreign subsidiaries less favorably than dividends received from domestic subsidiaries.Iowa includes the former, but not the latter, in the calculation of taxable income. While admitting that the two kindsof dividends are treated differently, Iowa and its

amici advance several arguments in support of the proposition thatthis differential treatment does not constitute prohibited discrimination against foreign commerce.

Amicus United States notes that a subsidiary's place ofincorporation does not necessarily correspond to the locus of

its business operations. A domestic corporation might do

Opinion of the Court

business abroad, and its dividends might reflect earningsfrom its foreign activity. Conversely, a foreign corporation

might do business in the United States, with its dividendpayments reflecting domestic business operations. On this
basis, the United States contends that the disparate treat-ment of dividends from foreign and domestic subsidiaries
does not translate into discrimination based on the locationor nature of business activity and is thus not prohibited by
the Commerce Clause.We recognize that the domicile of a corporation does not
necessarily establish that it is engaged in either foreign ordomestic commerce. In this case, however, it is stipulated
that the foreign subsidiaries did, in fact, operate in foreigncommerce and, further, that the decision to do business
abroad through foreign subsidiaries is typically supported bylegitimate business reasons.

15 By its nature, a unitary business is characterized by a flow of value among its compo-nents. See

Container Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax
Bd., 463 U. S. 159, 178 (1983). The flow of value betweenKraft and its foreign subsidiaries clearly constitutes foreign

commerce; this flow includes the foreign subsidiary divi-dends, which, as Iowa acknowledges, themselves constitute
foreign commerce.16Moreover, through the interplay of the federal and Iowa

tax statutes, the applicability of the Iowa tax necessarily de-pends not only on the domicile of the subsidiary, but also
on the location of the subsidiary's business activities. The

15 The parties stipulated as follows:
"Domestic Corporations typically do business in foreign countries through
corporations organized in the country in which they are doing business for
a variety of reasons. Reasons include, but are not limited to, the requirements of the local country, a better ability to limit their liability in that
country, the marketing advantage of being perceived by customers as a
local company, greater ease in repatriating funds, greater ease in borrowing funds locally, and ability to own property and manufacture in that
country." App. to Pet. for Cert. 30a-31a.

77Cite as: 505 U. S. 71 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
Federal Government generally taxes the income that a for-eign corporation earns in the United States.

17 To avoid multiple taxation, the Government allows a deduction for foreignsubsidiary dividends that reflect such domestic earnings.

18

In adopting the federal pattern, Iowa also allows a deductionfor dividends received from a foreign subsidiary if the dividends reflect business activity in the United States. Accord-ingly, while the dividends of all domestic subsidiaries are
excluded from the Iowa tax base, the dividends of foreignsubsidiaries are excluded only to the extent they reflect domestic earnings.19 In sum, the only subsidiary dividend pay-ments taxed by Iowa are those reflecting the foreign business activity of foreign subsidiaries. We do not think thatthis discriminatory treatment can be justified on the ground
that some of the (untaxed) dividend payments from domesticsubsidiaries also reflect foreign earnings.

In a related argument, Iowa and amicus United Statesassert that Kraft could conduct its foreign business through
domestic subsidiaries instead of foreign subsidiaries or, alter-natively, could set up a domestic company to hold the stock
of the foreign subsidiaries and receive the foreign dividendpayments. In either case, Kraft, itself, would receive no
dividends from foreign subsidiaries and would thus avoidpaying Iowa tax on income attributable to the foreign operations. Iowa and the United States contend that these alter-natives further demonstrate that it is not foreign commerce,

17 See 26 U. S. C. $ 882.
18 See $ 245.
19 The dissent presents the example of a subsidiary incorporated in a

foreign country, but engaged in business exclusively in the United States.
The dissent doubts whether a dividend payment from such a subsidiary
is properly characterized as "foreign commerce." Post, at 85. As discussed above, however, a dividend payment from such a subsidiary would
not be taxed by Iowa. Iowa taxes foreign subsidiary dividends only to
the extent that they reflect foreign earnings. The dissent does not dispute that this kind of dividend payment does constitute "foreign commerce." Post, at 84.

but, at most, a particular form of corporate organization thatis burdened.

This argument is not persuasive. Whether or not the sug-gested methods of tax avoidance would be practical as a
business matter, and whether or not they might generateadverse tax consequences in other jurisdictions, we do not
think that a State can force a taxpayer to conduct its foreignbusiness through a domestic subsidiary in order to avoid discriminatory taxation of foreign commerce. Cf. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Ward, 470 U. S. 869, 878-879 (1985). Wehave previously found that the Commerce Clause is not violated when the differential tax treatment of two categoriesof companies "results solely from differences between the
nature of their businesses, not from the location of their ac-tivities."

Amerada Hess Corp. v. Director, Div. of Taxation,N. J. Dept. of Treasury, 490 U. S. 66, 78 (1989).

20 We find no

authority for the different proposition advanced here that atax that does discriminate against foreign commerce may be

upheld if a taxpayer could avoid that discrimination bychanging the domicile of the corporations through which it
conducts its business. Our cases suggest the contrary. SeeWestinghouse Electric Corp. v. Tully, 466 U. S. 388, 406
(1984); Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co. v. Reily, 373U. S. 64, 72 (1963).

Repeating the argument that prevailed in the Iowa Su-preme Court, Iowa next insists that its tax system does not
violate the Commerce Clause because it does not favor localinterests. To the extent corporations do business in Iowa,
an apportioned share of their entire corporate income is sub-ject to Iowa tax. In the case of a foreign subsidiary doing
business abroad, Iowa would tax the dividends paid to thedomestic parent, but would not tax the subsidiary's earnings.

20 In Amerada Hess, we rejected the contention that a New Jersey tax
violated the Commerce Clause because it "discriminate[d] against oil producers who market their oil in favor of independent retailers who do not
produce oil." 490 U. S., at 78.

79Cite as: 505 U. S. 71 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
Summarizing this analysis, Iowa asserts: "More earnings ofthe domestic subsidiary, which has income producing activities in Iowa, than earnings of the foreign subsidiary, whichhas no Iowa activities, are included in the preapportioned
net income base for the unitary business as a whole." Brieffor Respondent 19. Far from favoring local commerce, Iowa
argues, the tax system places additional burdens on Iowabusinesses.

We agree that the statute does not treat Iowa subsidiariesmore favorably than subsidiaries located elsewhere. We are
not persuaded, however, that such favoritism is an essentialelement of a violation of the Foreign Commerce Clause. In
Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434(1979), we concluded that the constitutional prohibition
against state taxation of foreign commerce is broader thanthe protection afforded to interstate commerce, id., at 445-
446, in part because matters of concern to the entire Nationare implicated, id., at 448-451. Like the Import-Export
Clause,21 the Foreign Commerce Clause recognizes that dis-criminatory treatment of foreign commerce may create problems, such as the potential for international retaliation, thatconcern the Nation as a whole. Id., at 450. So here, we
think that a State's preference for domestic commerce overforeign commerce is inconsistent with the Commerce Clause
even if the State's own economy is not a direct beneficiary ofthe discrimination. As the absence of local benefit does not
eliminate the international implications of the discrimina-tion, it cannot exempt such discrimination from Commerce
Clause prohibitions.Iowa and

amicus United States also assert the strongerclaim that Iowa's tax system does not favor business activity

in the United States generally over business activity abroad.If true, this would indeed suggest that the statute does not

Opinion of the Court

discriminate against foreign commerce. We are not convinced, however, that this description adequately characterizes the relevant features of the Iowa statute. It is true
that if a subsidiary were located in another State, its earnings would be subject to taxation by the Federal Government and by the other State (assuming that the State was
one of the great majority that impose a corporate income
tax).22 This state and federal tax burden might exceed the
sum of the foreign tax that a foreign subsidiary would pay
and the tax that Iowa collects on dividends received from a
foreign subsidiary. But whatever the tax burdens imposed
by the Federal Government or by other States, the fact remains that Iowa imposes a burden on foreign subsidiaries
that it does not impose on domestic subsidiaries.23 We have
no reason to doubt the assertion of the United States that
"[i]n evaluating the alleged facial discrimination effected by
the Iowa tax, it is not proper to ignore the operation of other

22 Corporate income is taxed by 45 States and by the District of Columbia. See 1 J. Hellerstein, State Taxation: Corporate Income and Franchise Taxes || 1.6 (1983).

23 If one were to compare the aggregate tax imposed by Iowa on a unitary business which included a subsidiary doing business throughout the
United States (including Iowa) with the aggregate tax imposed by Iowa
on a unitary business which included a foreign subsidiary doing business
abroad, it would be difficult to say that Iowa discriminates against the
business with the foreign subsidiary. Iowa would tax an apportioned
share of the domestic subsidiary's entire earnings, but would tax only the
amount of the foreign subsidiary's earnings paid as a dividend to the
parent.

In considering claims of discriminatory taxation under the Commerce
Clause, however, it is necessary to compare the taxpayers who are "most
similarly situated." Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co. v. Reily, 373
U. S. 64, 71 (1963). A corporation with a subsidiary doing business in
Iowa is not situated similarly to a corporation with a subsidiary doing
business abroad. In the former case, the Iowa operations of the subsidiary provide an independent basis for taxation not present in the case of
the foreign subsidiary. A more appropriate comparison is between corporations whose subsidiaries do not do business in Iowa.

provisions of the same statute." Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 14, n. 19 (emphasis added). We find no authority, however, for the principle that discrimination againstforeign commerce can be justified if the benefit to domestic

subsidiaries might happen to be offset by other taxes imposed not by Iowa, but by other States and by the FederalGovernment.

Finally, Iowa insists that even if discrimination againstforeign commerce does result, the statute is valid because it
is intended to promote administrative convenience ratherthan economic protectionism. Iowa contends that the adoption of the federal definition of "taxable income," whichincludes foreign subsidiary dividends, provides significant
advantages both to the taxpayers and to the taxing authorities. Taxpayers may compute their Iowa tax easily basedon their federal calculations, and the Iowa authorities may

rely on federal regulations and interpretations and may take
advantage of federal efforts to monitor taxpayer compliance.
See 465 N. W. 2d, at 669.

We do not minimize the value of having state forms and
auditing procedures replicate federal practice. Absent a
compelling justification, however, a State may not advance
its legitimate goals by means that facially discriminate
against foreign commerce. See Philadelphia v. New Jersey,
437 U. S. 617, 626-628 (1978); Maine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131,
148, n. 19 (1986). In this instance, Iowa could enjoy substantially the same administrative benefits by utilizing the federal definition of taxable income, while making adjustments
that avoid the discriminatory treatment of foreign subsidiary
dividends. Many other States have adopted this approach.24

It is apparent, then, that this is not a case in which the
State's goals "cannot be adequately served by reasonable
nondiscriminatory alternatives." New Energy Co. of Indiana v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269, 278 (1988). Even if such

adjustments would diminish the administrative benefits ofadopting federal definitions, this marginal loss in convenience would not constitute the kind of serious health andsafety concern that we have sometimes found sufficient to

Iowa need not adopt the federal definition of taxable in-come. Nor, having chosen to follow the federal system in

part, must Iowa duplicate that scheme in all respects. Theadoption of the federal system in whole or in part, however,
cannot shield a state tax statute from Commerce Clausescrutiny. The Iowa statute cannot withstand this scrutiny,
for it facially discriminates against foreign commerce andtherefore violates the Foreign Commerce Clause.

The judgment of the Supreme Court of Iowa is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Blackmun joins, dissenting.

Petitioner in this case limits its Commerce Clause chal-lenge to a single argument--that Iowa's taxing scheme unconstitutionally discriminates against foreign commerce. Ithas brought a

facial challenge to the Iowa taxing scheme.The burden on one making a facial challenge to the constitutionality of a statute is heavy; the litigant must show that"no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would
be valid. The fact that [the tax] might operate unconsti-tutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is

25 Having concluded that the Iowa statute violates the Foreign Commerce Clause, we do not reach Kraft's challenge to the statute under the
Equal Protection Clause.

insufficient to render it wholly invalid." United States v.
Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987).

The only case dealing with the Foreign Commerce Clausesubstantially relied on by the Court in its opinion upholding

petitioner's challenge to the Iowa statute is Japan Line, Ltd.
v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434 (1979). It is impor-tant, therefore, to note how different are the facts in that

case from those in the present one. In Japan Line, Califor-nia had levied a nondiscriminatory ad valorem property tax
on cargo containers which were owned by Japanese shippingcompanies based in Japan, had their home ports in Japan,
and were used exclusively in foreign commerce. The containers were physically present in California for a fractional
part of the year, but only as a necessary incident of their
employment in foreign commerce. Japan levied no tax on
similar ly situated proper ty of United States shippi ng
companies.

In Container Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax Bd., 463
U. S. 159 (1983), where we upheld a California franchise tax
against a claim of violation of the Foreign Commerce Clause,
we noted at least two distinctions between that case and our
earlier decision in Japan Line. First, the tax there imposed
was not on a foreign entity, but on a domestic corporation.
Second, the United States did not file a brief urging that the
tax be struck down. 463 U. S., at 196. In the present case,
like Container Corporation, the Iowa tax is imposed on a
domestic corporation, not on a foreign entity. And in the
present case, the Executive Branch has not merely remained
neutral, as it did in Container Corporation, but has filed a
brief urging that the tax be sustained against the Foreign
Commerce Clause challenge.

The Court agrees that the Iowa tax involved here does not
favor subsidiaries incorporated in Iowa over foreign subsidiaries, but points out that the tax does favor subsidiaries incorporated in other States over foreign subsidiaries. Iowa
obviously has no selfish motive to accomplish such a result,

and the absence of such a motive is strong indication thatnone of the local advantage which has so often characterized

our Commerce Clause decisions is sought here. See, e. g.,
Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263, 268 (1984). Indeed, petitioner carries on operations in Iowa, where the
"State's own political processes [can] serve as a check againstunduly burdensome regulations."

Kassel v. Consolidated
Freightways Corp. of Del., 450 U. S. 662, 675 (1981).But assuming that it is sufficient to show simply that nonIowa domestic "commerce" enjoys a benefit not enjoyed byforeign "commerce," the Court surely errs in concluding that
such a showing has been made in the present case. Because
petitioner has chosen to make a facial challenge to the Iowa
statute, the record is largely devoid of any evidence to suggest that Iowa's taxing scheme systematically works to discourage foreign commerce to the advantage of its domestic
counterpart.

Petitioner's failures in this respect are severalfold. First,
it is unclear on the present record what amount of foreign
commerce is affected by the Iowa statute. The difficulty
flows from our inability to make any useful generalizations
about a corporation's business activity based solely on the
corporation's country of incorporation. The Court recognizes that, in this era of substantial international trade, it is
simple-minded to assume that a corporation's foreign domicile necessarily reflects that it is principally, or even substantially, engaged in foreign commerce. Ante, at 76. To the
contrary, foreign domiciled corporations may engage in little
or even zero foreign activity. In such cases, the suggestion
that Iowa's tax has any real effect on foreign commerce is
absurd; petitioner certainly has not demonstrated "by `clear
and cogent evidence' that [the state tax] results in extraterritorial values being taxed" in all cases. Franchise Tax
Bd., supra, at 175. In turn, Iowa's tax can hardly be found
to always unconstitutionally discriminate against foreign
commerce. Given that petitioner's burden is to demonstrate

85Cite as: 505 U. S. 71 (1992)
Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
that there are no circumstances in which Iowa's statute couldbe constitutionally applied, the existence of such a possibility

should be fatal to petitioner's chances of success in this case.The Court suggests that, even if foreign domiciled corporations are involved in no foreign trade, the dividend payments
from subsidiary to parent are themselves "foreign com-merce."

Ante, at 76. Again, this may be true in certain
circumstances, as the payment of a dividend may representa real flow of capital across international boundaries. But

certainly there are other situations where the "foreign" as-pects of a transaction are extraordinarily attenuated, and
any burdening of such transactions concomitantly would not
raise Foreign Commerce Clause concerns. Consider, for
example, the case of a "foreign" subsidiary--i. e., one that
is incorporated in a foreign country--but with operations
exclusively in the United States. It has no assets in the
foreign country, no operations, nothing of value whatsoever.
The corporation declares a dividend payable to its United
States parent. The payment in such circumstance may well
be accomplished simply by debiting one New York bank account and crediting another. To characterize this as "foreign commerce" seems to me to stretch that term beyond all
recognition. And again, the existence of such a possibility
is sufficient to undermine petitioner's facial challenge.

The Court appears to think these problems are surmounted by the parties' stipulation that petitioner's subsidiaries operated in "foreign commerce" and that foreign
subsidiaries are often established for legitimate business
reasons. Ibid. Of course, a stipulation between parties
cannot bind this Court on a question of law. Moreover, even
the facts that the stipulation establishes are sparse. It tells
us nothing about the ratio in modern commerce of "real"
foreign subsidiaries to their domestically oriented cousins.
Indeed, on the present record it is impossible even to establish the scope of operation of Kraft's subsidiaries. Compare
App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a-53a (reporting foreign tax pay505us1$96I 07-22-96 16:30:34 PAGES OPINPGT

ments by 6 of petitioner's subsidiaries) with id., at 76a-79a
(listing petitioner's 86 nonwholly owned subsidiaries). Without some greater detail, I think it is impossible to conclude
that the Iowa taxing scheme would have such real and substantial effects that it could never survive constitutional
muster.

Finally, I cannot agree that, even if the dividend payments
made taxable by the Iowa scheme are foreign commerce, that
Iowa impermissibly discriminates against such payments.
To be sure, two Iowa corporations, one with a foreign subsidiary and one with a domestic non-Iowa subsidiary will in
some cases pay a different total tax. But this does not constitute unconstitutional discrimination because, as far as the
record demonstrates, Iowa's taxing scheme does not result
in foreign commerce being systematically subject to higher
tax burdens than domestic commerce. Given that 45 of 50
States tax corporations on their net income, ante, at 80, n. 22,
in deciding to tax only a foreign subsidiary's dividend payments, rather than the subsidiary's total income, Iowa assures that the subsidiary's tax burden is less than that faced
by its domestic counterpart. The deduction that Iowa extends to domestically based dividend payments simply helps
to avoid what would otherwise be the near certainty that the
domestic income would be doubly taxed--once when earned
as income by the subsidiary and a second time when paid to
the parent corporation.

But Iowa's attempt to take account of this near certainty
with respect to domestic earnings does not in turn require it
to make a similar assumption with respect to income earned
by foreign sources. As amicus United States correctly
points out, "[t]he record in this case fails to indicate even the
existence, much less the nature, of such local-level foreign
taxes . . . . Nor is there any evidence to reflect the credits
or reductions that foreign local governments would apply or
allow." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 15, n. 21.

Finally, as I would reject petitioner's Foreign CommerceClause claim, I must go on to consider whether its Equal

Protection Claim fares any better. It does not. In defend-ing a tax classification such as this, a State need only demonstrate that the classification is rationally related to le-gitimate state purposes.

Exxon Corp. v. Eagerton, 462U. S. 176, 195 (1983). The statute will be upheld if it could

reasonably be concluded "that the challenged classificationwould promote a legitimate state purpose." Id., at 196.
Administrative efficiency is certainly a legitimate state in-terest and Iowa's reliance on the federal taxing scheme obviously furthers its achievement. Petitioner's claim, there-fore, must fail.

I would uphold the Iowa tax statute against this facialchallenge.

GADE, DIRECTOR, ILLINOIS ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION AGENCY v. NATIONAL SOLID

WASTES MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 90-1676. Argued March 23, 1992--Decided June 18, 1992
Pursuant to authority contained in the Occupational Safety and Health

Act of 1970 (OSH Act or Act), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) promulgated regulations implementing a requirement of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986
(SARA) that standards be set for the initial and routine training of
workers who handle hazardous wastes. Subsequently, Illinois enacted
two acts requiring the licensing of workers at certain hazardous waste
facilities. Each state act has the dual purpose of protecting workers
and the general public and requires workers to meet specified training
and examination requirements. Claiming, among other things, that the
acts were pre-empted by the OSH Act and OSHA regulations, respondent, an association of businesses involved in, inter alia, hazardous waste
management, sought injunctive relief against petitioner Gade's predecessor as director of the state environmental protection agency to prevent enforcement of the state acts. The District Court held that the
state acts were not pre-empted because they protected public safety in
addition to promoting job safety, but it invalidated some provisions of
the acts. The Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part,
holding that the OSH Act pre-empts all state law that "constitutes, in
a direct, clear and substantial way, regulation of worker health and
safety," unless the Secretary of Labor has explicitly approved the law
pursuant to $ 18 of the OSH Act. In remanding, the court did not consider which, if any, of the provisions would be pre-empted.

Held: The judgment is affirmed.
918 F. 2d 671, affirmed.

Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court with respect
to Parts I, III, and IV, concluding that:

1. A state law requirement that directly, substantially, and specifically
regulates occupational safety and health is an occupational safety and
health standard within the meaning of the OSH Act regardless of
whether it has another, nonoccupational purpose. In assessing a state
law's impact on the federal scheme, this Court has refused to rely solely

89Cite as: 505 U. S. 88 (1992)
Syllabus
on the legislature's professed purpose and has looked as well to the law's
effects. See, e. g., Perez v. Campbell, 402 U. S. 637, 651-652. State
laws of general applicability, such as traffic and fire safety laws, would
generally not be pre-empted, because they regulate workers simply as
members of the general public. Pp. 104-108.

2. The state licensing acts are pre-empted by the OSH Act to the
extent that they establish occupational safety and health standards for
training those who work with hazardous wastes. The Act's saving provisions are not implicated and Illinois does not have an approved plan.
Illinois' interest in establishing standards for licensing various occupations, cf., e. g., Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U. S. 773, 792, cannot
save from OSH Act pre-emption those provisions that directly and substantially affect workplace safety, since any state law, however clearly
within a State's acknowledged power, must yield if it interferes with or
is contrary to federal law, Felder v. Casey, 487 U. S. 131, 138. Nor can
the acts be saved from pre-emption by Gade's argument that they regulate a "pre-condition" to employment rather than occupational safety
and health, since SARA makes clear that the training of employees engaged in hazardous waste operations is an occupational safety and health
issue and that certification requirements before an employee may engage in such work are occupational safety and health standards. This
Court does not specifically consider which of the licensing acts' provisions will be pre-empted under the foregoing analysis. Pp. 108-109.

Justice O'Connor, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice White,
and Justice Scalia, concluded in Part II that the OSH Act impliedly
pre-empts any state regulation of an occupational safety or health issue
with respect to which a federal standard has been established, unless a
state plan has been submitted and approved pursuant to $ 18(b) of the
Act. The Act as a whole demonstrates that Congress intended to promote occupational safety and health while avoiding subjecting workers
and employers to duplicative regulation. Thus, it established a system
of uniform federal standards, but gave States the option of pre-empting
the federal regulations entirely pursuant to an approved state plan that
displaces the federal standards. This intent is indicated principally in

$ 18(b)'s statement that a State "shall" submit a plan if it wishes to
"assume responsibility" for developing and enforcing health and safety
standards. Gade's interpretation of $ 18(b)--that the Secretary's approval is required only if a State wishes to replace, not merely supplement, the federal regulations--would be inconsistent with the federal
scheme and is untenable in light of the surrounding provisions. The
language and purposes of $$ 18(a), (c), (f), and (h) all confirm the view
that the States cannot assume an enforcement role without the Secretary's approval, unless no federal standard is in effect. Also unaccept505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:25 PAGES OPINPGT

able is Gade's argument that the OSH Act does not pre-empt nonconflicting state laws because those laws, like the Act, are designed to
promote worker safety. Even where such laws share a common goal, a
state law will be pre-empted if it interferes with the methods by which
a federal statute was intended to reach that goal. International Paper
Co. v. Ouellette, 479 U. S. 481, 494. Here, the Act does not foreclose a
State from enacting its own laws, but it does restrict the ways in which
it can do so. Pp. 96-104.

Justice Kennedy, agreeing that the state laws are pre-empted, concluded that the result is mandated by the express terms of $ 18(b) of the
OSH Act and that the scope of pre-emption is also defined by the statutory text. Such a finding is not contrary to the longstanding rule that
this Court will not infer pre-emption of the States' historic police powers absent a clear statement of intent by Congress. Unartful though

$ 18(b)'s language may be, its structure and language, in conjunction
with subsections (a), (c), and (f), leave little doubt that in the OSH Act
Congress intended to pre-empt supplementary state regulation of an
occupational safety and health issue with respect to which a federal
standard exists. Pp. 109, 111-113.

92 GADE v. NATIONAL SOLID WASTES MANAGEMENT ASSN.

Opinion of the Court

I
The OSH Act authorizes the Secretary of Labor to promul-gate federal occupational safety and health standards. 29

U. S. C. $ 655. In the Superfund Amendments and Reau-thorization Act of 1986 (SARA), Congress directed the Secretary of Labor to "promulgate standards for the health andsafety protection of employees engaged in hazardous waste
operations" pursuant to her authority under the OSH Act.SARA, Pub. L. 99-499, Title I, $ 126, 100 Stat. 1690-1692,
codified at note following 29 U. S. C. $ 655. In relevant part,SARA requires the Secretary to establish standards for the
initial and routine training of workers who handle hazard-ous wastes.

In response to this congressional directive, OSHA, towhich the Secretary has delegated certain of her statutory
responsibilities, see Martin v. Occupational Safety and
Health Review Comm'n, 499 U. S. 144, 147, n. 1 (1991), pro-mulgated regulations on "Hazardous Waste Operations and

Emergency Response," including detailed regulations onworker training requirements. 51 Fed. Reg. 45654, 45665-
45666 (1986) (interim regulations); 54 Fed. Reg. 9294, 9320-9321 (1989) (final regulations), codified at 29 CFR $ 1910.120
(1991). The OSHA regulations require, among other things,that workers engaged in an activity that may expose them
to hazardous wastes receive a minimum of 40 hours of in-struction off the site, and a minimum of three days actual
field experience under the supervision of a trained supervi-sor. $ 1910.120(e)(3)(i). Workers who are on the site only
occasionally or who are working in areas that have been de-termined to be under the permissible exposure limits must
complete at least 24 hours of off-site instruction and one dayof actual field experience. $$ 1910.120(e)(3)(ii) and (iii).
On-site managers and supervisors directly responsible forhazardous waste operations must receive the same initial
training as general employees, plus at least eight additionalhours of specialized training on various health and safety

programs. $ 1910.120(e)(4). Employees and supervisors arerequired to receive eight hours of refresher training annually. $ 1910.120(e)(8). Those who have satisfied the train-ing and field experience requirement receive a written certification; uncertified workers are prohibited from engaging in
hazardous waste operations. $ 1910.120(e)(6).In 1988, while OSHA's interim hazardous waste regulations were in effect, the State of Illinois enacted the licensingacts at issue here. The laws are designated as acts "in relation to environmental protection," and their stated aim is toprotect both employees and the general public by licensing
hazardous waste equipment operators and laborers working
at certain facilities. Both licensing acts require a license
applicant to provide a certified record of at least 40 hours
of training under an approved program conducted within
Illinois, to pass a written examination, and to complete an
annual refresher course of at least eight hours of instruction. Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 111, |||| 7705(c) and (e), 7706(c) and
(d), 7707(b), 7805(c) and (e), 7806(b). In addition, applicants
for a hazardous waste crane operator's license must submit
"a certified record showing operation of equipment used in
hazardous waste handling for a minimum of 4,000 hours."
|| 7705(d). Employees who work without the proper license,
and employers who knowingly permit an unlicensed employee to work, are subject to escalating fines for each
offense. |||| 7715, 7716, 7814.

The respondent in this case, National Solid Wastes Management Association (Association), is a national trade association of businesses that remove, transport, dispose, and
handle waste material, including hazardous waste. The Association's members are subject to the OSH Act and OSHA
regulations, and are therefore required to train, qualify, and
certify their hazardous waste remediation workers. 29
CFR $ 1910.120 (1991). For hazardous waste operations
conducted in Illinois, certain of the workers employed by the
Association's members are also required to obtain licenses

94 GADE v. NATIONAL SOLID WASTES MANAGEMENT ASSN.

Opinion of the Court
pursuant to the Illinois licensing acts. Thus, for example,some of the Association's members must ensure that their

employees receive not only the 3 days of field experiencerequired for certification under the OSHA regulations, but
also the 500 days of experience (4,000 hours) required for
licensing under the state statutes.Shortly before the state licensing acts were due to go into

effect, the Association brought a declaratory judgment ac-tion in United States District Court against Bernard Killian,
the former Director of the Illinois Environmental ProtectionAgency (IEPA); petitioner Mary Gade is Killian's successor
in office and has been substituted as a party pursuant to this
Court's Rule 35.3. The Association sought to enjoin IEPA
from enforcing the Illinois licensing acts, claiming that the
acts were pre-empted by the OSH Act and OSHA regulations and that they violated the Commerce Clause of the
United States Constitution. The District Court held that
state laws that attempt to regulate workplace safety and
health are not pre-empted by the OSH Act when the laws
have a "legitimate and substantial purpose apart from promoting job safety." App. to Pet. for Cert. 54. Applying
this standard, the District Court held that the Illinois licensing acts were not pre-empted because each protected public
safety in addition to promoting job safety. Id., at 56-57.
The court indicated that it would uphold a state regulation
implementing the 4,000-hour experience requirement, as long
as it did not conflict with federal regulations, because it was
reasonable to conclude that workers who satisfy the requirement "will be better skilled than those who do not; and better skilled means fewer accidents, which equals less risk to
public safety and the environment." Id., at 59. At the
same time, the District Court invalidated the requirement
that applicants for a hazardous waste license be trained
"within Illinois" on the ground that the provision did not
contribute to Illinois' stated purpose of protecting public
safety. Id., at 57-58. The court declined to consider the

Opinion of the Court
Association's Commerce Clause challenge for lack of ripeness. Id., at 61-62.

On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the
Seventh Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. National Solid Wastes Management Assn. v. Killian, 918 F. 2d
671 (1990). The Court of Appeals held that the OSH Act
pre-empts all state law that "constitutes, in a direct, clear
and substantial way, regulation of worker health and safety,"
unless the Secretary has explicitly approved the state law.
Id., at 679. Because many of the regulations mandated by
the Illinois licensing acts had not yet reached their final
form, the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the District
Court without considering which, if any, of the Illinois provisions would be pre-empted. Id., at 684. The court made
clear, however, its view that Illinois "cannot regulate worker
health and safety under the guise of environmental regulation," and it rejected the District Court's conclusion that the
State's 4,000-hour experience requirement could survive preemption simply because the rule might also enhance public
health and safety. Ibid. Writing separately, Judge Easterbrook expressed doubt that the OSH Act pre-empts nonconflicting state laws. Id., at 685-688. He concluded, however, that if the OSH Act does pre-empt state law, the
majority had employed an appropriate test for determining
whether the Illinois licensing acts were superseded. Id.,
at 688.

We granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 1012 (1991), to resolve a
conflict between the decision below and decisions in which
other Courts of Appeals have found the OSH Act to have
a much narrower pre-emptive effect on "dual impact" state
regulations. See Associated Industries of Massachusetts v.

II
Before addressing the scope of the OSH Act's pre-emptionof dual impact state regulations, we consider petitioner's

threshold argument, drawn from Judge Easterbrook's sepa-rate opinion below, that the Act does not pre-empt nonconflicting state regulations at all. "[T]he question whether acertain state action is pre-empted by federal law is one of
congressional intent. ` "The purpose of Congress is the ul-timate touchstone." ' " Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, 471
U. S. 202, 208 (1985) (quoting Malone v. White Motor Corp.,435 U. S. 497, 504 (1978)). "To discern Congress' intent we
examine the explicit statutory language and the structureand purpose of the statute." Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U. S. 133, 138 (1990); see also FMC Corp. v. Holliday, 498 U. S. 52, 56-57 (1990).In the OSH Act, Congress endeavored "to assure so far as

possible every working man and woman in the Nation safeand healthful working conditions." 29 U. S. C. $ 651(b). To
that end, Congress authorized the Secretary of Labor to setmandatory occupational safety and health standards applicable to all businesses affecting interstate commerce, 29U. S. C. $ 651(b)(3), and thereby brought the Federal Government into a field that traditionally had been occupied by theStates. Federal regulation of the workplace was not intended to be all encompassing, however. First, Congressexpressly saved two areas from federal pre-emption. Section 4(b)(4) of the OSH Act states that the Act does not "su-persede or in any manner affect any workmen's compensation law or . . . enlarge or diminish or affect in any othermanner the common law or statutory rights, duties, or liabilities of employers and employees under any law with respectto injuries, diseases, or death of employees arising out of, or
in the course of, employment." 29 U. S. C. $ 653(b)(4). Sec-tion 18(a) provides that the Act does not "prevent any State

agency or court from asserting jurisdiction under State lawover any occupational safety or health issue with respect to

which no [federal] standard is in effect." 29 U. S. C. $ 667(a).Congress not only reserved certain areas to state regulation, but it also, in $ 18(b) of the Act, gave the States theoption of pre-empting federal regulation entirely. That section provides:

"Submission of State plan for development and enforce-ment of State standards to preempt applicable Federal

standards."Any State which, at any time, desires to assume responsibility for development and enforcement therein ofoccupational safety and health standards relating to any
occupational safety or health issue with respect to whicha Federal standard has been promulgated [by the Secretary under the OSH Act] shall submit a State plan forthe development of such standards and their enforcement." 29 U. S. C. $ 667(b).
About half the States have received the Secretary's approvalfor their own state plans as described in this provision. 29

CFR pts. 1952, 1956 (1991). Illinois is not among them.In the decision below, the Court of Appeals held that

$ 18(b) "unquestionably" pre-empts any state law or reg-ulation that establishes an occupational health and safety
standard on an issue for which OSHA has already pro-mulgated a standard, unless the State has obtained the
Secretary's approval for its own plan. 918 F. 2d, at 677.Every other federal and state court confronted with an OSH

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Pre-emption may be either expressed or implied, and "iscompelled whether Congress' command is explicitly stated in

the statute's language or implicitly contained in its structureand purpose." Jones v. Rath Packing Co., 430 U. S. 519, 525

we have recognized at least two types of implied pre-emption: field pre-emption, where the scheme of federal regulation is " `so pervasive as to make reasonable the inferencethat Congress left no room for the States to supplement it,' "
id., at 153 (quoting Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S.218, 230 (1947)), and conflict pre-emption, where "compliance
with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossi-bility,"

Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373U. S. 132, 142-143 (1963), or where state law "stands as an

Perez v. Campbell, 402 U. S. 637, 649 (1971).Our ultimate task in any pre-emption case is to determine

whether state regulation is consistent with the structure andpurpose of the statute as a whole. Looking to "the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy," PilotLife Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41, 51 (1987) (internal

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
sues for which a federal standard is in effect is impliedly pre-empted as in conflict with the full purposes and objectives of

the OSH Act, Hines v. Davidowitz, supra. The design ofthe statute persuades us that Congress intended to subject
employers and employees to only one set of regulations, be
it federal or state, and that the only way a State may regu-late an OSHA-regulated occupational safety and health issue

is pursuant to an approved state plan that displaces the fed-eral standards.

The principal indication that Congress intended to pre-empt state law is $ 18(b)'s statement that a State "shall" submit a plan if it wishes to "assume responsibility" for "development and enforcement . . . of occupational safety and
health standards relating to any occupational safety or
health issue with respect to which a Federal standard has
been promulgated." The unavoidable implication of this
provision is that a State may not enforce its own occupational
safety and health standards without obtaining the Secretary's approval, and petitioner concedes that $ 18(b) would
require an approved plan if Illinois wanted to "assume responsibility" for the regulation of occupational safety and
health within the State. Petitioner contends, however, that
an approved plan is necessary only if the State wishes completely to replace the federal regulations, not merely to supplement them. She argues that the correct interpretation
of $ 18(b) is that posited by Judge Easterbrook below: i. e., a
State may either "oust" the federal standard by submitting
a state plan to the Secretary for approval or "add to" the
federal standard without seeking the Secretary's approval.
918 F. 2d, at 685 (Easterbrook, J., dubitante).

Petitioner's interpretation of $ 18(b) might be plausible
were we to interpret that provision in isolation, but it simply
is not tenable in light of the OSH Act's surrounding provisions. "[W]e must not be guided by a single sentence or
member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole
law." Dedeaux, supra, at 51 (internal quotation marks and

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
citations omitted). The OSH Act as a whole evidences Con-gress' intent to avoid subjecting workers and employers to

duplicative regulation; a State may develop an occupationalsafety and health program tailored to its own needs, but only
if it is willing completely to displace the applicable federal
regulations.Cutting against petitioner's interpretation of $ 18(b) is the

language of $ 18(a), which saves from pre-emption any statelaw regulating an occupational safety and health issue with
respect to which no federal standard is in effect. 29 U. S. C.$ 667(a). Although this is a saving clause, not a pre-emption
clause, the natural implication of this provision is that state
laws regulating the same issue as federal laws are not saved,
even if they merely supplement the federal standard. Moreover, if petitioner's reading of $ 18(b) were correct, and if
a State were free to enact nonconflicting safety and health
regulations, then $ 18(a) would be superfluous: There is no
possibility of conflict where there is no federal regulation.
Because "[i]t is our duty `to give effect, if possible, to every
clause and word of a statute,' " United States v. Menasche,
348 U. S. 528, 538-539 (1955) (quoting Montclair v. Ramsdell,
107 U. S. 147, 152 (1883)), we conclude that $ 18(a)'s preservation of state authority in the absence of a federal standard
presupposes a background pre-emption of all state occupational safety and health standards whenever a federal standard governing the same issue is in effect.

Our understanding of the implications of $ 18(b) is likewise
bolstered by $ 18(c) of the Act, 29 U. S. C. $ 667(c), which sets
forth the conditions that must be satisfied before the Secretary can approve a plan submitted by a State under subsection (b). State standards that affect interstate commerce
will be approved only if they "are required by compelling
local conditions" and "do not unduly burden interstate commerce." $ 667(c)(2). If a State could supplement federal
regulations without undergoing the $ 18(b) approval process,
then the protections that $ 18(c) offers to interstate com505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT

101Cite as: 505 U. S. 88 (1992)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
merce would easily be undercut. It would make little senseto impose such a condition on state programs intended to

supplant federal regulation and not those that merely supple-ment it: The burden on interstate commerce remains the
same.

Section 18(f ) also confirms our view that States are notpermitted to assume an enforcement role without the Secretary's approval, unless no federal standard is in effect. Thatprovision gives the Secretary the authority to withdraw her
approval of a state plan. 29 U. S. C. $ 667(f ). Once ap-proval is withdrawn, the plan "cease[s] to be in effect" and
the State is permitted to assert jurisdiction under its occupational health and safety law only for those cases "commenced
before the withdrawal of the plan." Ibid. Under petitioner's reading of $ 18(b), $ 18(f) should permit the continued
exercise of state jurisdiction over purely "supplemental" and
nonconflicting standards. Instead, $ 18(f) assumes that the
State loses the power to enforce all of its occupational safety
and health standards once approval is withdrawn.

The same assumption of exclusive federal jurisdiction in
the absence of an approved state plan is apparent in the
transitional provisions contained in $ 18(h) of the Act. 29
U. S. C. $ 667(h). Section 18(h) authorized the Secretary of
Labor, during the first two years after passage of the Act,
to enter into an agreement with a State by which the State
would be permitted to continue to enforce its own occupational health and safety standards for two years or until final
action was taken by the Secretary pursuant to $ 18(b), whichever was earlier. Significantly, $ 18(h) does not say that
such an agreement is only necessary when the State wishes
fully to supplant federal standards. Indeed, the original
Senate version of the provision would have allowed a State
to enter into such an agreement only when it wished to enforce standards "not in conflict with Federal occupational
health and safety standards," a category which included "any
State occupational health and safety standard which pro505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
vides for more stringent health and safety regulations thando the Federal standards." S. 2193, $ 17(h), reprinted in 116

Cong. Rec. 37637 (1970). Although that provision was elimi-nated from the final draft of the bill, thereby allowing agreements for the temporary enforcement of less stringent state
standards, it is indicative of the congressional understandingthat a State was required to enter into a transitional agreement even when its standards were stricter than federalstandards. The Secretary's contemporaneous interpretation of $ 18(h) also expresses that understanding. See 29CFR $ 1901.2 (1972) ("Section 18(h) permits the Secretary to
provide an alternative to the exclusive Federal jurisdiction
[over] occupational safety and health issue[s]. This alternative is temporary and may be considered a step toward the
more permanent alternative to exclusive Federal jurisdiction provided by sections 18(b) and (c) following submission
and approval of a plan submitted by a State for the development and enforcement of occupational safety and health
standards") (emphases added).

Looking at the provisions of $ 18 as a whole, we conclude
that the OSH Act precludes any state regulation of an occupational safety or health issue with respect to which a federal standard has been established, unless a state plan has
been submitted and approved pursuant to $ 18(b). Our review of the Act persuades us that Congress sought to promote occupational safety and health while at the same time
avoiding duplicative, and possibly counterproductive, regulation. It thus established a system of uniform federal occupational health and safety standards, but gave States the
option of pre-empting federal regulations by developing their
own occupational safety and health programs. In addition,
Congress offered the States substantial federal grant moneys
to assist them in developing their own programs. See OSH
Act $ 23, 29 U. S. C. $$ 672(a), (b), and (f) (for three years
following enactment, the Secretary may award up to 90% of
the costs to a State of developing a state occupational safety

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
and health plan); 29 U. S. C. $ 672(g) (States that develop approved plans may receive funding for up to 50% of the costs
of operating their occupational health and safety programs).
To allow a State selectively to "supplement" certain federal
regulations with ostensibly nonconflicting standards would
be inconsistent with this federal scheme of establishing uniform federal standards, on the one hand, and encouraging
States to assume full responsibility for development and enforcement of their own OSH programs, on the other.

We cannot accept petitioner's argument that the OSH Act
does not pre-empt nonconflicting state laws because those
laws, like the Act, are designed to promote worker safety.
In determining whether state law "stands as an obstacle" to
the full implementation of a federal law, Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S., at 67, "it is not enough to say that the ultimate goal of both federal and state law" is the same, International Paper Co. v. Ouellette, 479 U. S. 481, 494 (1987).
"A state law also is pre-empted if it interferes with the methods by which the federal statute was designed to reach th[at]
goal." Ibid.; see also Michigan Canners & Freezers Assn.,
Inc. v. Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Bd., 467
U. S. 461, 477 (1984) (state statute establishing association to
represent agricultural producers pre-empted even though it
and the federal Agricultural Fair Practices Act "share the
goal of augmenting the producer's bargaining power"); Wisconsin Dept. of Industry v. Gould Inc., 475 U. S. 282, 286-287
(1986) (state statute preventing three-time violators of the
National Labor Relations Act from doing business with the
State is pre-empted even though state law was designed to
reinforce requirements of federal Act). The OSH Act does
not foreclose a State from enacting its own laws to advance
the goal of worker safety, but it does restrict the ways in
which it can do so. If a State wishes to regulate an issue of
worker safety for which a federal standard is in effect, its

only option is to obtain the prior approval of the Secretaryof Labor, as described in $ 18 of the Act.

Petitioner next argues that, even if Congress intended topre-empt all nonapproved state occupational safety and

health regulations whenever a federal standard is in effect,the OSH Act's pre-emptive effect should not be extended to
state laws that address public safety as well as occupationalsafety concerns. As we explained in Part II, we understand

2 Justice Kennedy, while agreeing on the pre-emptive scope of the
OSH Act, finds that its pre-emption is express rather than implied. Post,
at 112 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
The Court's previous observation that our pre-emption categories are not
"rigidly distinct," English v. General Electric Co., 496 U. S. 72, 79, n. 5
(1990), is proved true by this case. We, too, are persuaded that the text
of the Act provides the strongest indication that Congress intended the
promulgation of a federal safety and health standard to pre-empt all nonapproved state regulation of the same issue, but we cannot say that it
rises to the level of express pre-emption. In the end, even Justice Kennedy finds express pre-emption by relying on the negative "inference" of

$ 18(b), which governs when state law will pre-empt federal law. Post, at
112. We cannot agree that the negative implications of the text, although
ultimately dispositive to our own analysis, expressly address the issue of
federal pre-emption of state law. We therefore prefer to place this case
in the category of implied pre-emption. Supra, at 98-99. Although we
have chosen to use the term "conflict" pre-emption, we could as easily
have stated that the promulgation of a federal safety and health standard
"pre-empts the field" for any nonapproved state law regulating the same
safety and health issue. See English, supra, at 79-80, n. 5 ("[F]ield preemption may be understood as a species of conflict pre-emption: A state
law that falls within a pre-empted field conflicts with Congress' intent
(either express or plainly implied) to exclude state regulation"); post,
at 116 (Souter, J., dissenting). Frequently, the pre-emptive "label" we
choose will carry with it substantive implications for the scope of preemption. In this case, however, it does not. Our disagreement with Justice Kennedy as to whether the OSH Act's pre-emptive effect is labeled
"express" or "implied" is less important than our agreement that the implications of the text of the statute evince a congressional intent to preempt nonapproved state regulations when a federal standard is in effect.

$ 18(b) to mean that the OSH Act pre-empts all state "occu-pational safety and health standards relating to any occupational safety or health issue with respect to which a Federalstandard has been promulgated." 29 U. S. C. $ 667(b). We
now consider whether a dual impact law can be an "occupa-tional safety and health standard" subject to pre-emption
under the Act.The OSH Act defines an "occupational safety and health
standard" as "a standard which requires conditions, or theadoption or use of one or more practices, means, methods,
operations, or processes, reasonably necessary or appro-priate to provide safe or healthful employment and places of
employment." 29 U. S. C. $ 652(8). Any state law require-ment designed to promote health and safety in the workplace
falls neatly within the Act's definition of an "occupationalsafety and health standard." Clearly, under this definition,
a state law that expressly declares a legislative purpose ofregulating occupational health and safety would, in the absence of an approved state plan, be pre-empted by an OSHAstandard regulating the same subject matter. But petitioner asserts that if the state legislature articulates a pur-pose other than (or in addition to) workplace health and
safety, then the OSH Act loses its pre-emptive force. Wedisagree.

Although "part of the pre-empted field is defined by refer-ence to the purpose of the state law in question, . . . another
part of the field is defined by the state law's actual effect."English v. General Electric Co., 496 U. S. 72, 84 (1990) (citing
Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Resources Conser-vation and Development Comm'n, 461 U. S. 190, 212-213
(1983)). In assessing the impact of a state law on the federalscheme, we have refused to rely solely on the legislature's
professed purpose and have looked as well to the effects ofthe law. As we explained over two decades ago:

"We can no longer adhere to the aberrational doctrine. . . that state law may frustrate the operation of federal

Opinion of the Court
law as long as the state legislature in passing its lawhad some purpose in mind other than one of frustration.

Apart from the fact that it is at odds with the approachtaken in nearly all our Supremacy Clause cases, such a
doctrine would enable state legislatures to nullify nearlyall unwanted federal legislation by simply publishing a
legislative committee report articulating some state in-terest or policy--other than frustration of the federal
objective--that would be tangentially furthered by theproposed state law. . . . [A]ny state legislation which
frustrates the full effectiveness of federal law is ren-dered invalid by the Supremacy Clause."

Perez v.
Campbell, 402 U. S., at 651-652.

See also Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373U. S., at 141-142 (focus on "whether the purposes of the two

laws are parallel or divergent" tends to "obscure more thanaid" in determining whether state law is pre-empted by federal law) (emphasis deleted); Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U. S.322, 336 (1979) ("[W]hen considering the purpose of a challenged statute, this Court is not bound by `[t]he name, de-scription or characterization given it by the legislature or
the courts of the State,' but will determine for itself the prac-tical impact of the law") (quoting

Lacoste v. Department of
Conservation of Louisiana, 263 U. S. 545, 550 (1924)); Na-pier v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 272 U. S. 605, 612 (1926)

(pre-emption analysis turns not on whether federal and statelaws "are aimed at distinct and different evils" but whether
they "operate upon the same object").Our precedents leave no doubt that a dual impact state
regulation cannot avoid OSH Act pre-emption simply be-cause the regulation serves several objectives rather than
one. As the Court of Appeals observed, "[i]t would defeatthe purpose of section 18 if a state could enact measures
stricter than OSHA's and largely accomplished through regu-lation of worker health and safety simply by asserting a nonoccupational purpose for the legislation." 918 F. 2d, at 679.

107Cite as: 505 U. S. 88 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
Whatever the purpose or purposes of the state law, pre-emption analysis cannot ignore the effect of the challenged

state action on the pre-empted field. The key question isthus at what point the state regulation sufficiently interferes
with federal regulation that it should be deemed pre-empted
under the Act.In

English v. General Electric Co., supra, we held that a
state tort claim brought by an employee of a nuclear-fuelsproduction facility against her employer was not pre-empted

by a federal whistle-blower provision because the state lawdid not have a "direct and substantial effect" on the federal
scheme. Id., at 85. In the decision below, the Court of Appeals relied on English to hold that, in the absence of the
approval of the Secretary, the OSH Act pre-empts all state
law that "constitutes, in a direct, clear and substantial way,
regulation of worker health and safety." 918 F. 2d, at 679.
We agree that this is the appropriate standard for determining OSH Act pre-emption. On the other hand, state laws of
general applicability (such as laws regarding traffic safety or
fire safety) that do not conflict with OSHA standards and
that regulate the conduct of workers and nonworkers alike
would generally not be pre-empted. Although some laws of
general applicability may have a "direct and substantial" effect on worker safety, they cannot fairly be characterized
as "occupational" standards, because they regulate workers
simply as members of the general public. In this case, we
agree with the court below that a law directed at workplace
safety is not saved from pre-emption simply because the
State can demonstrate some additional effect outside of the
workplace.

In sum, a state law requirement that directly, substantially, and specifically regulates occupational safety and
health is an occupational safety and health standard within
the meaning of the Act. That such a law may also have a
nonoccupational impact does not render it any less of an occupational standard for purposes of pre-emption analysis.

Opinion of the Court
If the State wishes to enact a dual impact law that regulatesan occupational safety or health issue for which a federal

standard is in effect, $ 18 of the Act requires that the Statesubmit a plan for the approval of the Secretary.

IV
We recognize that "the States have a compelling interestin the practice of professions within their boundaries, and

that as part of their power to protect the public health,safety, and other valid interests they have broad power to
establish standards for licensing practitioners and regulatingthe practice of professions."

Goldfarb v. Virginia StateBar, 421 U. S. 773, 792 (1975); see also Ferguson v. Skrupa,

372 U. S. 726, 731 (1963); Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U. S.114, 122 (1889). But under the Supremacy Clause, from
which our pre-emption doctrine is derived, " `any state law,however clearly within a State's acknowledged power, which
interferes with or is contrary to federal law, must yield.' "
Felder v. Casey, 487 U. S., at 138 (quoting Free v. Bland, 369U. S. 663, 666 (1962)); see also De Canas v. Bica, 424 U. S.

351, 357 (1976) ("[E]ven state regulation designed to protectvital state interests must give way to paramount federal legislation"). We therefore reject petitioner's argument thatthe State's interest in licensing various occupations can save
from OSH Act pre-emption those provisions that directly andsubstantially affect workplace safety.

We also reject petitioner's argument that the Illinois li-censing acts do not regulate occupational safety and health
at all, but are instead a "pre-condition" to employment. Bythat reasoning, the OSHA regulations themselves would
not be considered occupational standards. SARA, how-ever, makes clear that the training of employees engaged in
hazardous waste operations is an occupational safety andhealth issue, and that certification requirements before an
employee may engage in such work are occupational safetyand health standards. See supra, at 92. Because nei505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT

ther of the OSH Act's saving provisions are implicated, andbecause Illinois does not have an approved state plan under

health standards for training those who work with hazardouswastes. Like the Court of Appeals, we do not specifically
consider which of the licensing acts' provisions will stand orfall under the pre-emption analysis set forth above.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is hereby

Affirmed.
Justice Kennedy, concurring in part and concurring inthe judgment.

Though I concur in the Court's judgment and with the ulti-mate conclusion that the state law is pre-empted, I would
find express pre-emption from the terms of the federal stat-ute. I cannot agree that we should denominate this case as
one of implied pre-emption. The contrary view of the plu-rality is based on an undue expansion of our implied preemption jurisprudence which, in my view, is neither wisenor necessary.

As both the majority and dissent acknowledge, we haveidentified three circumstances in which a federal statute preempts state law: First, Congress can adopt express languagedefining the existence and scope of pre-emption. Second,
state law is pre-empted where Congress creates a schemeof federal regulation so pervasive as to leave no room for
supplementary state regulation. And third, "state law ispre-empted to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law." English v. General Electric Co., 496 U. S. 72,78-79 (1990);

ante, at 98; post, at 115. This third form ofpre-emption, so-called actual conflict pre-emption, occurs

either "where it is impossible for a private party to complywith both state and federal requirements . . . or where state
law `stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execu-tion of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.' " Eng505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT

lish, supra, at 79 (quoting Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52,67 (1941)). The plurality would hold today that state occupational safety and health standards regulating an issue onwhich a federal standard exists conflict with Congress' purpose to "subject employers and employees to only one set of
regulations." Ante, at 99. This is not an application of ourpre-emption standards, it is but a conclusory statement of

pre-emption, as it assumes that Congress intended exclusivefederal jurisdiction. I do not see how such a mode of analysis advances our consideration of the case.Our decisions establish that a high threshold must be met
if a state law is to be pre-empted for conflicting with the
purposes of a federal Act. Any conflict must be "irreconcilable . . . . The existence of a hypothetical or potential conflict is insufficient to warrant the pre-emption of the state
statute." Rice v. Norman Williams Co., 458 U. S. 654, 659
(1982); see also English, supra, at 90 ("The `teaching of this
Court's decisions . . . enjoin[s] seeking out conflicts between
state and federal regulation where none clearly exists' "
(quoting Huron Portland Cement Co. v. Detroit, 362 U. S.
440, 446 (1960)); Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Comm'n, 461 U. S.
190, 222-223 (1983). In my view, this type of pre-emption
should be limited to state laws which impose prohibitions
or obligations which are in direct contradiction to Congress'
primary objectives, as conveyed with clarity in the federal
legislation.

I do not believe that supplementary state regulation of an
occupational safety and health issue can be said to create the
sort of actual conflict required by our decisions. The purpose of state supplementary regulation, like the federal
standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA), is to protect worker safety
and health. Any potential tension between a scheme of federal regulation of the workplace and a concurrent, supplementary state scheme would not, in my view, rise to the level

of "actual conflict" described in our pre-emption cases. Ab-sent the express provisions of $ 18 of the Occupational Safety

and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act), 29 U. S. C. $ 667, I wouldnot say that state supplementary regulation conflicts with
the purposes of the OSH Act, or that it " `interferes with the
methods by which the federal statute was designed to reach[its] goal.' "

Ante, at 103 (quoting International Paper Co.
v. Ouellette, 479 U. S. 481, 494 (1987)).The plurality's broad view of actual conflict pre-emption is

contrary to two basic principles of our pre-emption jurispru-dence. First, we begin "with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States [are] not to be superseded
. . . unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress." Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230
(1947); see also ante, at 96. Second, " `[t]he purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone' " in all pre-emption cases.
Malone v. White Motor Corp., 435 U. S. 497, 504 (1978) (quoting Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 375 U. S. 96, 103 (1963)).
A freewheeling judicial inquiry into whether a state statute
is in tension with federal objectives would undercut the principle that it is Congress rather than the courts that preempts state law.

Nonetheless, I agree with the Court that "the OSH Act
pre-empts all state `occupational safety and health standards
relating to any occupational safety or health issue with respect to which a Federal standard has been promulgated.' "
Ante, at 105 (quoting 29 U. S. C. $ 667(b)). I believe, however, that this result is mandated by the express terms of

$ 18(b) of the OSH Act. It follows from this that the preemptive scope of the Act is also limited to the language of
the statute. When the existence of pre-emption is evident
from the statutory text, our inquiry must begin and end with
the statutory framework itself.

A finding of express pre-emption in this case is not contrary to our longstanding rule that we will not infer preemption of the States' historic police powers absent a clear

statement of intent by Congress. Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator
Corp., supra, at 230; Jones v. Rath Packing Co., 430 U. S. 519,
525 (1977); English, 496 U. S., at 79. Though most statutescreating express pre-emption contain an explicit statement

to that effect, a statement admittedly lacking in $ 18(b), we
have never required any particular magic words in our ex-press pre-emption cases. Our task in all pre-emption cases

is to enforce the "clear and manifest purpose of Congress."
Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., supra, at 230. We have
held, in express pre-emption cases, that Congress' intentmust be divined from the language, structure, and purposes

of the statute as a whole. Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U. S. 133, 138 (1990); Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux,
481 U. S. 41, 51 (1987). The language of the OSH statute
sets forth a scheme in light of which the provisions of $ 18must be interpreted, and from which the express preemption that displaces state law follows.As the plurality's analysis amply demonstrates,

ante,
at 98-103, Congress has addressed the issue of pre-emptionin the OSH Act. The dissent's position that the Act does

not pre-empt supplementary state regulation becomes mostimplausible when the language of $ 18(b) is considered in
conjunction with the other provisions of $ 18. Section 18(b)
provides as follows:

"Any State which . . . desires to assume responsibilityfor development and enforcement therein of occupational safety and health standards relating to any occupational safety or health issue with respect to which aFederal standard has been promulgated . . .

shall submit
a State plan . . . ." 29 U. S. C. $ 667(b) (emphasis added).

The statute is clear: When a State desires to assume responsibility for an occupational safety and health issue already
addressed by the Federal Government, it must submit a
state plan. The most reasonable inference from this language is that when a State does not submit and secure ap505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
proval of a state plan, it may not enforce occupational safetyand health standards in that area. Any doubt that this is

what Congress intended disappears when subsection (b) isconsidered in conjunction with subsections (a), (c), and (f ).
Ante, at 100-101. I will not reiterate the plurality's persuasive discussion on this point. Unartful though the languageof $ 18(b) may be, the structure and language of $ 18 leave

little doubt that in the OSH statute Congress intended topre-empt supplementary state regulation of an occupational
safety and health issue with respect to which a federal stand-ard exists.

In this regard I disagree with the dissent, see post, p. 114,
and find unconvincing its conclusion that Congress intended
to allow concurrent state and federal jurisdiction over occupational safety and health issues. The dissent would give
the States, rather than the Federal Government, the power
to decide whether as to any particular occupational safety
and health issue there will exist a single or dual regulatory
scheme. Under this theory the State may choose exclusive
federal jurisdiction by not regulating; or exclusive state
jurisdiction by submitting a state plan; or dual regulation
by adopting supplementary rules, as Illinois did here. That
position undermines the authority of OSHA in many respects. For example, $ 18(c)(2) of the OSH Act allows
OSHA to disapprove state plans which "unduly burden interstate commerce." The dissent would eviscerate this important administrative mechanism by allowing the States to
sidestep OSHA's authority through the mechanism of supplementary regulation. See post, at 118-121. Furthermore,
concurrent state and federal jurisdiction might interfere
with the enforcement of the federal regulations without creating a situation where compliance with both schemes is a
physical impossibility, which the dissent would require for
pre-emption. Post, at 121; see also Brief for Respondent
32-33. I would not attribute to Congress the intent to create such a hodgepodge scheme of authority. My views in

Souter, J., dissenting
this regard are confirmed by the fact that OSHA has asa consistent matter, since the enactment of the OSH Act,

viewed $ 18 as providing it with exclusive jurisdiction inareas where it issues a standard. 29 CFR $ 1901.2 (1991);
36 Fed. Reg. 7006 (1971); Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 12-21. Therefore, while the dissent may be correctthat as a theoretical matter the separate provisions of $ 18

may be reconciled with allowing concurrent jurisdiction, itis neither a natural nor a sound reading of the statutory
scheme.The necessary implication of finding express pre-emption
in this case is that the pre-emptive scope of the OSH Act isdefined by the language of $ 18(b). Because this provision
requires federal approval of state occupational safety and
health standards alone, only state laws fitting within that
description are pre-empted. For that reason I agree with
the Court that state laws of general applicability are not preempted. Ante, at 107. I also agree that "a state law requirement that directly, substantially, and specifically regulates occupational safety and health is an occupational safety
and health standard within the meaning of the Act," ibid.,
and therefore falls within the scope of pre-emption. Socalled "dual impact" state regulations which meet this standard are pre-empted by the OSH Act, regardless of any additional purpose the law may serve, or effect the law may have,
outside the workplace. As a final matter, I agree that the
Illinois Acts are not saved because they operate through a
licensing mechanism rather than through direct regulation of
the workplace. I therefore join all but Part II of the Court's
opinion, and concur in the judgment of the Court.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Blackmun, Justice Stevens, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

The Court holds today that $ 18 of the Occupational Safety
and Health Act of 1970 (Act), 29 U. S. C. $ 667, pre-empts
state regulation of any occupational safety or health issue as

to which there is a federal standard, whether or not the stateregulation conflicts with the federal standard in the sense

that enforcement of one would preclude application of theother. With respect, I dissent. In light of our rule that
federal pre-emption of state law is only to be found in a clearcongressional purpose to supplant exercises of the States'
traditional police powers, the text of the Act fails to supportthe Court's conclusion.

I
Our cases recognize federal pre-emption of state law inthree variants: express pre-emption, field pre-emption, and

conflict pre-emption. Express pre-emption requires "ex-plicit pre-emptive language." See Pacific Gas & Elec. Co.
v. State Energy Resources Conservation and DevelopmentComm'n, 461 U. S. 190, 203 (1983), citing Jones v. Rath Packing Co., 430 U. S. 519, 525 (1977). Field pre-emption iswrought by a manifestation of congressional intent to occupy
an entire field such that even without a federal rule on someparticular matter within the field, state regulation on that
matter is pre-empted, leaving it untouched by either state orfederal law. 461 U. S., at 204. Finally, there is conflict preemption in either of two senses. The first is found whencompliance with both state and federal law is impossible,
ibid., the second when a state law "stands as an obstacle tothe accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and
objectives of Congress," Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52,67 (1941).

The plurality today finds pre-emption of this last sort, dis-cerning a conflict between any state legislation on a given
issue as to which a federal standard is in effect, and a con-gressional purpose "to subject employers and employees to
only one set of regulations." Ante, at 99. Thus, under theplurality's reading, any regulation on an issue as to which a
federal standard has been promulgated has been pre-empted.As one commentator has observed, this kind of purposeconflict pre-emption, which occurs when state law is held to

116 GADE v. NATIONAL SOLID WASTES MANAGEMENT ASSN.

Souter, J., dissenting
"undermin[e] a congressional decision in favor of nationaluniformity of standards," presents "a situation similar in

practical effect to that of federal occupation of a field." L.Tribe, American Constitutional Law 486 (2d ed. 1988). Still,
whether the pre-emption at issue is described as occupationof each narrow field in which a federal standard has been
promulgated, as pre-emption of those regulations that con-flict with the federal objective of single regulation, or, as
Justice Kennedy describes it, as express pre-emption, see
ante, at 111 (opinion concurring in part and concurring injudgment), the key is congressional intent, and I find the

language of the statute insufficient to demonstrate an intentto pre-empt state law in this way.

II
Analysis begins with the presumption that "Congress didnot intend to displace state law."

Maryland v. Louisiana,451 U. S. 725, 746 (1981). "Where, as here, the field which

Congress is said to have pre-empted has been traditionallyoccupied by the States, see, e. g., U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 10;
Patapsco Guano Co. v. North Carolina, 171 U. S. 345, 358(1898), `we start with the assumption that the historic police
powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Fed-eral Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of
Congress.' Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218,230 (1947). This assumption provides assurance that the
`federal-state balance,' United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336,349 (1971), will not be disturbed unintentionally by Congress
or unnecessarily by the courts. But when Congress has `un-mistakably . . . ordained,'

Florida Lime & Avocado Growers,
Inc. v. Paul, 373 U. S. 132, 142 (1963), that its enactmentsalone are to regulate a part of commerce, state laws regulating that aspect of commerce must fall." Jones, supra, at525. Subject to this principle, the enquiry into the possibly
pre-emptive effect of federal legislation is an exercise of stat-utory construction. If the statute's terms can be read sensi505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT

117Cite as: 505 U. S. 88 (1992)
Souter, J., dissenting
bly not to have a pre-emptive effect, the presumption con-trols and no pre-emption may be inferred.

III
At first blush, respondent's strongest argument mightseem to rest on $ 18(a) of the Act, 29 U. S. C. $ 667(a), the full

text of which is this:

"(a) Assertion of State standards in absence of applica-ble Federal standards

"Nothing in this chapter shall prevent any Stateagency or court from asserting jurisdiction under State
law over any occupational safety or health issue withrespect to which no standard is in effect under section
655 of this title."
That is to say, where there is no federal standard in effect,there is no pre-emption. The plurality reasons that there

must be pre-emption, however, when there is a federal stand-ard in effect, else $ 18(a) would be rendered superfluous because "[t]here is no possibility of conflict where there is nofederal regulation."

Ante, at 100.The plurality errs doubly. First, its premise is incorrect.

In the sense in which the plurality uses the term, there isthe possibility of "conflict" even absent federal regulation
since the mere enactment of a federal law like the Act mayamount to an occupation of an entire field, preventing state
regulation. Second, the necessary implication of $ 18(a) isnot that every federal regulation pre-empts all state law on
the issue in question, but only that some federal regulationsmay pre-empt some state law. The plurality ignores the
possibility that the provision simply rules out field pre-emption and is otherwise entirely compatible with the possibility that pre-emption will occur only when actual conflictbetween a federal regulation and a state rule renders compliance with both impossible. Indeed, if Congress had meantto say that any state rule should be pre-empted if it deals

505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT
118 GADE v. NATIONAL SOLID WASTES MANAGEMENT ASSN.

Souter, J., dissenting
with an issue as to which there is a federal regulation ineffect, the text of subsection (a) would have been a very

inept way of trying to make the point. It was not, however,an inept way to make the different point that Congress intended no field pre-emption of the sphere of health and safety
subject to regulation, but not necessarily regulated, underthe Act. Unlike the case where field pre-emption occurs,

the provision tells us, absence of a federal standard leaves aState free to do as it will on the issue. Beyond this, subsection (a) does not necessarily mean anything, and the provi-sion is perfectly consistent with the conclusion that as long
as compliance with both a federal standard and a state regu-lation is not physically impossible, see

Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U. S. 132, 142-143 (1963),
each standard shall be enforceable. If, indeed, the presump-tion against pre-emption means anything, $ 18(a) must be

read in just this way.Respondent also relies on $ 18(b), 29 U. S. C. $ 667(b):

"(b) Submission of State plan for development and en-forcement of State standards to preempt applicable Federal standards"Any State which, at any time, desires to assume responsibility for development and enforcement therein ofoccupational safety and health standards relating to any
occupational safety or health issue with respect to whicha Federal standard has been promulgated under section
655 of this title shall submit a State plan for the development of such standards and their enforcement."

Respondent argues that the necessary implication of this
provision is clear: the only way that a state rule on a particular occupational safety and health issue may be enforced once
a federal standard on the issue is also in place is by incorporating the state rule in a plan approved by the Secretary.

As both the plurality and Justice Kennedy acknowledge,
however, that is not the necessary implication of $ 18(b).

Souter, J., dissenting
See ante, at 99 (plurality opinion); ante, at 112-113 (opinionconcurring in part and concurring in judgment). The subsection simply does not say that unless a plan is approved,state law on an issue is pre-empted by the promulgation of
a federal standard. In fact it tugs the other way, and in
actually providing a mechanism for a State to "assume re-sponsibility" for an issue with respect to which a federal

standard has been promulgated (that is, to pre-empt federallaw), $ 18(b) is far from pre-emptive of anything adopted by
the States. Its heading, enacted as part of the statute andproperly considered under our canons of construction for
whatever light it may shed, see, e. g., Strathearn S. S. Co. v.
Dillon, 252 U. S. 348, 354 (1920); FTC v. Mandel Brothers,
Inc., 359 U. S. 385 (1959), speaks expressly of the "development and enforcement of State standards to preempt applicable Federal standards." The provision does not in any way
provide that absent such state pre-emption of federal rules,
the State may not even supplement the federal standards
with consistent regulations of its own. Once again, nothing
in the provision's language speaks one way or the other to
the question whether promulgation of a federal standard preempts state regulation, or whether, in the absence of a plan,
consistent federal and state regulations may coexist. The
provision thus makes perfect sense on the assumption that a
dual regulatory scheme is permissible but subject to state
pre-emption if the State wishes to shoulder enough of the
federal mandate to gain approval of a plan.

Nor does the provision setting out conditions for the Secretary's approval of a plan indicate that a state regulation
on an issue federally addressed is never enforceable unless
incorporated in a plan so approved. Subsection (c)(2) requires the Secretary to approve a plan when in her judgment, among other things, it will not "unduly burden
interstate commerce." 29 U. S. C. $ 667(c)(2). Respondent
argues, and the plurality concludes, that if state regulations
were not pre-empted, this provision would somehow suggest

120 GADE v. NATIONAL SOLID WASTES MANAGEMENT ASSN.

Souter, J., dissenting
that States acting independently could enforce regulationsthat did burden interstate commerce unduly. Brief for Respondent 17; see ante, at 100-101. But this simply does notfollow. The subsection puts a limit on the Secretary's authority to approve a plan that burdens interstate commerce,
thus capping the discretion that might otherwise have beenread into the congressional delegation of authority to the

Secretary to approve state plans. From this restrictionapplying only to the Secretary's federal authority it is clearly
a non sequitur to conclude that pre-emption must have beenintended to avoid the equally objectionable undue burden
that independent state regulation might otherwise impose.Quite the contrary; the dormant Commerce Clause can take
care of that, without any need to assume pre-emption.

The final provision that arguably suggests pre-emptionmerely by promulgation of a federal standard is $ 18(h), 29

U. S. C. $ 667(h):

"(h) Temporary enforcement of State standards

"The Secretary may enter into an agreement with aState under which the State will be permitted to continue to enforce one or more occupational health andsafety standards in effect in such State until final action
is taken by the Secretary with respect to a plan sub-mitted by a State under subsection (b) of this section,
or two years from December 29, 1970, whichever isearlier."

This provision of course expired in 1972, but its languagemay suggest something about the way Congress understood
the rest of $ 18. Since, all are agreed, a State would not
have had reason to file a plan unless a federal standard was
in place, $ 18(h) necessarily refers to a situation in which
there is a federal standard. Respondent argues that the
provision for agreements authorizing continued enforcement
of a state standard following adoption of a federal standard
on the issue it addresses implies that, absent such agree505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT

121Cite as: 505 U. S. 88 (1992)
Souter, J., dissenting
ment, a State would have been barred from enforcing anystandard of its own.

Once again, however, that is not the necessary implicationof the text. A purely permissive provision for enforcement
of state regulations does not imply that all state regulationsare otherwise unenforceable. All it necessarily means is
that the Secretary could agree to permit the State for a lim-ited time to enforce whatever state regulations would otherwise have been pre-empted, as would have been true whenthey actually so conflicted with the federal standard that an
employer could not comply with them and still comply withfederal law as well. Thus, in the case of a State wishing to
submit a plan, the provision as I read it would have allowedfor the possibility of just one transition, from the pre-Act
state law to the post-Act state plan. Read as the Courtreads it, however, employers and employees in such a State
would have been subjected first to state law on a given issue;then, after promulgation of a federal standard, to that standard; and then, after approval of the plan, to a new state re-gime. One enforced readjustment would have been better
than two, and the statute is better read accordingly.*

IV
In sum, our rule is that the traditional police powers ofthe State survive unless Congress has made a purpose to

*The plurality also relies on $ 18(f), 29 U. S. C. $ 667(f), which deals with
withdrawal of approval of a state plan. See ante, at 101. The section
provides that "the State may retain jurisdiction in any case commenced
before the withdrawal of the plan in order to enforce standards under the
plan whenever the issues involved do not relate to the reasons for the
withdrawal of the plan." The plurality is mistaken in concluding that

$ 18(f) "assumes that the State loses the power to enforce all of its occupational safety and health standards once approval is withdrawn." Ibid.
At most it assumes that the State loses its capacity to enforce the plan
(except for pending cases). It says nothing about state law that may remain on the books exclusive of the plan's authority, or about new law enacted after withdrawal of the Secretary's approval.

pre-empt them clear. See Rice, 331 U. S., at 230. The Actdoes not, in so many words, pre-empt all state regulation of

issues on which federal standards have been promulgated,and respondent's contention at oral argument that reading
subsections (a), (b), and (h) could leave no other "logical"conclusion but one of pre-emption is wrong. Each provision
can be read consistently with the others without any implica-tion of pre-emptive intent. See

National Solid WastesManagement Assn. v. Killian, 918 F. 2d 671, 685-688 (CA7

1990) (Easterbrook, J., dubitante). They are in fact just asconsistent with a purpose and objective to permit overlapping state and federal regulation as with one to guaranteethat employers and employees would be subjected to only
one regulatory regime. Restriction to one such regime byprecluding supplemental state regulation might or might not
be desirable. But in the absence of any clear expression ofcongressional intent to pre-empt, I can only conclude that, as
long as compliance with federally promulgated standardsdoes not render obedience to Illinois' regulations impossible,
the enforcement of the state law is not prohibited by theSupremacy Clause. I respectfully dissent.

123OCTOBER TERM, 1991
Syllabus

FORSYTH COUNTY, GEORGIA v. NATIONALISTMOVEMENT
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 91-538. Argued March 31, 1992--Decided June 19, 1992
Petitioner county's Ordinance 34 mandates permits for private demonstrations and other uses of public property; declares that the cost of protecting participants in such activities exceeds the usual and normal cost of
law enforcement and should be borne by the participants; requires every
permit applicant to pay a fee of not more than $1,000; and empowers the
county administrator to adjust the fee's amount to meet the expense
incident to the ordinance's administration and to the maintenance of
public order. After the county attempted to impose such a fee for respondent's proposed demonstration in opposition to the Martin Luther
King, Jr., federal holiday, respondent filed this suit, claiming that the
ordinance violates the free speech guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court denied relief, ruling that the
ordinance was not unconstitutional as applied in this case. The Court
of Appeals reversed, holding that an ordinance which charges more than
a nominal fee for using public forums for public issue speech is facially
unconstitutional.

Held: The ordinance is facially invalid. Pp. 129-137.

(a) In order to regulate competing uses of public forums, government
may impose a permit requirement on those wishing to hold a march,
parade, or rally, if, inter alia, the permit scheme does not delegate
overly broad licensing discretion to a government official, Freedman v.
Maryland, 380 U. S. 51, 56, and is not based on the content of the message, see United States v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 177. Pp. 129-130.

(b) An examination of the county's implementation and authoritative
constructions of the ordinance demonstrates the absence of the constitutionally required "narrowly drawn, reasonable and definite standards,"
Niemotko v. Maryland, 340 U. S. 268, 271, to guide the county administrator's hand when he sets a permit fee. The decision how much to
charge for police protection or administrative time--or even whether to
charge at all--is left to the unbridled discretion of the administrator,
who is not required to rely on objective standards or provide any explanation for his decision. Pp. 130-133.

"nominal" cap, could save the ordinance. Murdock v. Pennsylvania,

this context, because no limit on the fee's size can remedy the ordinance's constitutional infirmities. Pp. 136-137.

had a troubled racial history. In 1912, in one month, its en-tire African-American population, over 1,000 citizens, was

driven systematically from the county in the wake of therape and murder of a white woman and the lynching of her
accused assailant.1 Seventy-five years later, in 1987, thecounty population remained 99% white.

Spurred by this history, Hosea Williams, an Atlanta citycouncilman and civil rights personality, proposed a Forsyth

County "March Against Fear and Intimidation" for Janu-ary 17, 1987. Approximately 90 civil rights demonstrators
attempted to parade in Cumming, the county seat. Themarchers were met by members of the Forsyth County
Defense League (an independent affiliate of respondent,The Nationalist Movement), of the Ku Klux Klan, and other
Cumming residents. In all, some 400 counterdemonstratorslined the parade route, shouting racial slurs. Eventually,
the counterdemonstrators, dramatically outnumbering policeofficers, forced the parade to a premature halt by throwing
rocks and beer bottles.Williams planned a return march the following weekend.
It developed into the largest civil rights demonstration inthe South since the 1960's. On January 24, approximately
20,000 marchers joined civil rights leaders, United StatesSenators, Presidential candidates, and an Assistant United
States Attorney General in a parade and rally.3 The 1,000counterdemonstrators on the parade route were contained

by more than 3,000 state and local police and NationalGuardsmen. Although there was sporadic rock throwing

and 60 counterdemonstrators were arrested, the parade wasnot interrupted. The demonstration cost over $670,000 in
police protection, of which Forsyth County apparently paid
a small portion.4 See App. to Pet. for Cert. 75-94; LosAngeles Times, Jan. 28, 1987, Metro section, p. 5, col. 1.

"As a direct result" of these two demonstrations, the For-syth County Board of Commissioners enacted Ordinance 34
on January 27, 1987. See Brief for Petitioner 6. The ordi-nance recites that it is "to provide for the issuance of permits
for parades, assemblies, demonstrations, road closings, andother uses of public property and roads by private organizations and groups of private persons for private purposes."See App. to Pet. for Cert. 98. The board of commissioners
justified the ordinance by explaining that "the cost of necessary and reasonable protection of persons participating in
or observing said parades, assemblies, demonstrations, road
closings and other related activities exceeds the usual and
normal cost of law enforcement for which those participating
should be held accountable and responsible." Id., at 100.
The ordinance required the permit applicant to defray these
costs by paying a fee, the amount of which was to be fixed
"from time to time" by the Board. Id., at 105.

Ordinance 34 was amended on June 8, 1987, to provide that
every permit applicant " `shall pay in advance for such permit, for the use of the County, a sum not more than $1,000.00
for each day such parade, procession, or open air public meeting shall take place.' " Id., at 119.5 In addition, the county

4 Petitioner Forsyth County does not indicate what portion of these costs
it paid. Newspaper articles reported that the State of Georgia paid
an estimated $579,148. Other government entities paid an additional
$29,759. Figures were not available for the portion paid by the city of
Atlanta for the police it sent. See id., at 95-97.

5 The ordinance was amended at other times, too, but those amendments

are not under challenge here.

In January 1989, respondent The Nationalist Movement
proposed to demonstrate in opposition to the federal holidaycommemorating the birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr. In

Forsyth County, the Movement sought to "conduct a rallyand speeches for one and a half to two hours" on the courthouse steps on a Saturday afternoon. Nationalist Movement v. City of Cumming, 913 F. 2d 885, 887 (CA11 1990).6
The county imposed a $100 fee. The fee did not include anycalculation for expenses incurred by law enforcement authorities, but was based on 10 hours of the county administrator'stime in issuing the permit. The county administrator testified that the cost of his time was deliberately undervaluedand that he did not charge for the clerical support involved
in processing the application. Tr. 135-139.

The Movement did not pay the fee and did not hold the
rally. Instead, it instituted this action on January 19, 1989,
in the United States District Court for the Northern District
of Georgia, requesting a temporary restraining order and
permanent injunction prohibiting Forsyth County from interfering with the Movement's plans.

The District Court denied the temporary restraining order
and injunction. It found that, although "the instant ordinance vests much discretion in the County Administrator in
determining an appropriate fee," the determination of the
fee was "based solely upon content-neutral criteria; namely,

the courthouse square, and there conducting a rally. Only the rally was

County Board of Education. Their permit schemes are not challenged

incident to maintaining public order, the District Courtfound that "the county ordinance, as applied in this case, is
not unconstitutional." Id., at 14.The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed this aspect of the District Court's judgment.
Nationalist Movement v. City of Cumming, 913 F. 2d 885(1990). Relying on its prior opinion in Central Florida Nuclear Freeze Campaign v. Walsh, 774 F. 2d 1515, 1521 (CA111985), cert. denied, 475 U. S. 1120 (1986), the Court of Appeals held: "An ordinance which charges more than a nominalfee for using public forums for public issue speech, violates
the First Amendment." 913 F. 2d, at 891 (internal quotationmarks omitted). The court determined that a permit fee
of up to $1,000 a day exceeded this constitutional threshold.
Ibid. One judge concurred specially, calling for Central
Florida to be overruled. 913 F. 2d, at 896.The Court of Appeals then voted to vacate the panel's

opinion and to rehear the case en banc. 921 F. 2d 1125(1990). After further briefing, the court issued a per curiam opinion reinstating the panel opinion in its entirety.934 F. 2d 1482, 1483 (1991). Two judges, concurring in part
and dissenting in part, agreed that any fee imposed on theexercise of First Amendment rights in a traditional public
forum must be nominal if it is to survive constitutional scru-tiny. Those judges, however, did not believe that the county
ordinance swept so broadly that it was facially invalid, andwould have remanded the case for the District Court to determine whether the fee was nominal.7 Ibid. Three judges

II
Respondent mounts a facial challenge to the Forsyth
County ordinance. It is well established that in the area offreedom of expression an overbroad regulation may be subject to facial review and invalidation, even though its application in the case under consideration may be constitutionally
unobjectionable. See, e. g., City Council of Los Angeles v.
Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U. S. 789, 798-799, and n. 15
(1984); Board of Airport Comm'rs of Los Angeles v. Jews for
Jesus, Inc., 482 U. S. 569, 574 (1987). This exception from
general standing rules is based on an appreciation that the
very existence of some broadly written laws has the potential to chill the expressive activity of others not before the
court. See, e. g., New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 772
(1982); Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U. S. 491, 503
(1985). Thus, the Court has permitted a party to challenge
an ordinance under the overbreadth doctrine in cases where
every application creates an impermissible risk of suppression of ideas, such as an ordinance that delegates overly
broad discretion to the decisionmaker, see Thornhill v. Ala8 Compare the Eleventh Circuit's opinions in this litigation, 913 F. 2d
885, 891 (1990), and 934 F. 2d 1482, 1483 (1991), with Stonewall Union v.
Columbus, 931 F. 2d 1130, 1136 (CA6) (permitting greater than nominal
fees that are reasonably related to expenses incident to the preservation of

150-151 (1969); Niemotko v. Maryland, 340 U. S. 268, 271(1951). Although there is a "heavy presumption" against
the validity of a prior restraint, Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U. S. 58, 70 (1963), the Court has recognized thatgovernment, in order to regulate competing uses of public

forums, may impose a permit requirement on those wishingto hold a march, parade, or rally, see Cox v. New Hampshire,
312 U. S. 569, 574-576 (1941). Such a scheme, however,must meet certain constitutional requirements. It may not
delegate overly broad licensing discretion to a governmentofficial. See

Freedman v. Maryland, supra. Further, anypermit scheme controlling the time, place, and manner of

speech must not be based on the content of the message,must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and must leave open ample alternatives for com-munication. See

United States v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 177(1983).

A
Respondent contends that the county ordinance is faciallyinvalid because it does not prescribe adequate standards for

the administrator to apply when he sets a permit fee. Agovernment regulation that allows arbitrary application is
"inherently inconsistent with a valid time, place, and mannerregulation because such discretion has the potential for becoming a means of suppressing a particular point of view."

Opinion of the Court
Heffron v. International Society for Krishna Conscious-ness, Inc., 452 U. S. 640, 649 (1981). To curtail that risk, "a

law subjecting the exercise of First Amendment freedoms tothe prior restraint of a license" must contain "narrow, objective, and definite standards to guide the licensing authority."
Shuttlesworth, 394 U. S., at 150-151; see also Niemotko, 340U. S., at 271. The reasoning is simple: If the permit scheme

"involves appraisal of facts, the exercise of judgment, andthe formation of an opinion," Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310
U. S. 296, 305 (1940), by the licensing authority, "the dangerof censorship and of abridgment of our precious First
Amendment freedoms is too great" to be permitted, Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U. S. 546, 553 (1975).In evaluating respondent's facial challenge, we must consider the county's authoritative constructions of the ordi-nance, including its own implementation and interpretation
of it. See Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 795-796 (1989); Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co., 486
U. S. 750, 770, n. 11 (1988); Gooding v. Wilson, 405 U. S. 518,524-528 (1972). In the present litigation, the county has
made clear how it interprets and implements the ordinance.The ordinance can apply to any activity on public property--
from parades, to street corner speeches, to bike races--andthe fee assessed may reflect the county's police and administrative costs. Whether or not, in any given instance, the feewould include any or all of the county's administrative and
security expenses is decided by the county administrator.9

9 In pertinent part, the ordinance, as amended, states that the administrator "shall adjust the amount to be paid in order to meet the expense
incident to the administration of the Ordinance and to the maintenance of
public order." $ 3(6) (emphasis added), App. to Pet. for Cert. 119. This
could suggest that the administrator has no authority to reduce or waive
these expenses. It has not been so understood, however, by the county.
See 934 F. 2d, at 1488, n. 12 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in
part). In its February 23, 1987, amendments to the ordinance, the board
of commissioners changed the permit form from "Have you paid the application fee?" to "Have you paid any application fee?," see App. to

132 FORSYTH COUNTY v. NATIONALIST MOVEMENT

Opinion of the Court
In this case, according to testimony at the District Courthearing, the administrator based the fee on his own judgment of what would be reasonable. Although the countypaid for clerical support and staff as an "expense incident to
the administration" of the permit, the administrator testifiedthat he chose in this instance not to include that expense in
the fee. The administrator also attested that he had delib-erately kept the fee low by undervaluing the cost of the time
he spent processing the application. Even if he had spentmore time on the project, he claimed, he would not have
charged more. He further testified that, in this instance, hechose not to include any charge for expected security expense. Tr. 135-139.The administrator also explained that the county had imposed a fee pursuant to a permit on two prior occasions.The year before, the administrator had assessed a fee of $100
for a permit for the Movement. The administrator testifiedthat he charged the same fee the following year (the year in
question here), although he did not state that the Movementwas seeking the same use of county property or that it required the same amount of administrative time to process.
Id., at 138. The administrator also once charged bike-raceorganizers $25 to hold a race on county roads, but he did

not explain why processing a bike-race permit demanded lessadministrative time than processing a parade permit or why
he had chosen to assess $25 in that instance. Id., at 143-144.At oral argument in this Court, counsel for Forsyth County
stated that the administrator had levied a $5 fee on the GirlScouts for an activity on county property. Tr. of Oral Arg.
26. Finally, the administrator testified that in other casesthe county required neither a permit nor a fee for activities
in other county facilities or on county land. Tr. 146.Based on the county's implementation and construction of
the ordinance, it simply cannot be said that there are any
Pet. for Cert. 115 (emphasis added), thus acknowledging the administrator's authority to charge no fee.

Opinion of the Court
"narrowly drawn, reasonable and definite standards," Nie-motko, 340 U. S., at 271, guiding the hand of the Forsyth

County administrator. The decision how much to charge forpolice protection or administrative time--or even whether

to charge at all--is left to the whim of the administrator.There are no articulated standards either in the ordinance
or in the county's established practice. The administrator isnot required to rely on any objective factors. He need not
provide any explanation for his decision, and that decision isunreviewable. Nothing in the law or its application prevents the official from encouraging some views and discour-aging others through the arbitrary application of fees.

10

The First Amendment prohibits the vesting of such unbri-dled discretion in a government official.

11

B
The Forsyth County ordinance contains more than the pos-sibility of censorship through uncontrolled discretion. As

10 The District Court's finding that in this instance the Forsyth County
administrator applied legitimate, content-neutral criteria, even if correct,
is irrelevant to this facial challenge. Facial attacks on the discretion
granted a decisionmaker are not dependent on the facts surrounding any
particular permit decision. See Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publishing
Co., 486 U. S. 750, 770 (1988). "It is not merely the sporadic abuse of
power by the censor but the pervasive threat inherent in its very existence
that constitutes the danger to freedom of discussion." Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S. 88, 97 (1940). Accordingly, the success of a facial challenge on the grounds that an ordinance delegates overly broad discretion
to the decisionmaker rests not on whether the administrator has exercised
his discretion in a content-based manner, but whether there is anything
in the ordinance preventing him from doing so.

11 Petitioner also claims that Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U. S. 569 (1941),

excuses the administrator's discretion in setting the fee. Reliance on Cox
is misplaced. Although the discretion granted to the administrator under
the language in this ordinance is the same as in the statute at issue in
Cox, the interpretation and application of that language are different. Unlike this case, there was in Cox no testimony or evidence that the statute
granted unfettered discretion to the licensing authority. Id., at 576-577.

Opinion of the Court
construed by the county, the ordinance often requires thatthe fee be based on the content of the speech.

The county envisions that the administrator, in appro-priate instances, will assess a fee to cover "the cost of necessary and reasonable protection of persons participating in or
observing said . . . activit[y]." See App. to Pet. for Cert.100. In order to assess accurately the cost of security for

parade participants, the administrator " `must necessarily ex-amine the content of the message that is conveyed,' "

Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U. S. 221, 230(1987), quoting

FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468
U. S. 364, 383 (1984), estimate the response of others to that
content, and judge the number of police necessary to meet
that response. The fee assessed will depend on the administrator's measure of the amount of hostility likely to be created by the speech based on its content. Those wishing to
express views unpopular with bottle throwers, for example,
may have to pay more for their permit.

Although petitioner agrees that the cost of policing relates
to content, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 15 and 24, it contends that
the ordinance is content neutral because it is aimed only at
a secondary effect--the cost of maintaining public order. It
is clear, however, that, in this case, it cannot be said that
the fee's justification " `ha[s] nothing to do with content.' "
Ward, 491 U. S., at 792, quoting Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312,
320 (1988) (opinion of O'Connor, J.).

The costs to which petitioner refers are those associated
with the public's reaction to the speech. Listeners' reaction
to speech is not a content-neutral basis for regulation. See
id., at 321 (opinion of O'Connor, J.); id., at 334 (opinion of
Brennan, J.); Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U. S. 46,

12 The dissent prefers a remand because there are no lower court findings on the question whether the county plans to base parade fees on
hostile crowds. See post, at 142. We disagree. A remand is unnecessary because there is no question that petitioner intends the ordinance to
recoup costs that are related to listeners' reaction to the speech. Petitioner readily admits it did not charge for police protection for the 4th of
July parades, although they were substantial parades, which required the
closing of streets and drew large crowds. Petitioner imposed a fee only
when it became necessary to provide security for parade participants from
angry crowds opposing their message. Brief for Petitioner 6. The ordinance itself makes plain that the costs at issue are those needed for "necessary and reasonable protection of persons participating in or observing"
the speech. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 100. Repayment for police protection is the "[m]ost importan[t]" purpose underlying the ordinance. Brief
for Petitioner 6-7.

In this Court, petitioner specifically urges reversal because the lower
court has "taken away the right of local government to obtain reimbursement for administration and policing costs which are incurred in protecting those using government property for expression." Id., at 17 (emphasis added). When directly faced with the Court of Appeals' concern about
"the enhanced cost associated with policing expressive activity which
would generate potentially violent reactions," id., at 36, petitioner responded not by arguing that it did not intend to charge for police protection, but that such a charge was permissible because the ordinance provided a cap. See id., at 36-37; Tr. of Oral Arg. 24. At no point, in any
level of proceedings, has petitioner intimated that it did not construe the
ordinance consistent with its language permitting fees to be charged for
the cost of police protection from hostile crowds. We find no disputed
interpretation of the ordinance necessitating a remand.

issue in Cox to authorize the municipality to charge a permitfee for the "maintenance of public order," no fee was actually
assessed. See id., at 577. Nothing in this Court's opinionsuggests that the statute, as interpreted by the New Hampshire Supreme Court, called for charging a premium in thecase of a controversial political message delivered before a
hostile audience. In light of the Court's subsequent FirstAmendment jurisprudence, we do not read

Cox to permitsuch a premium.

C
Petitioner, as well as the Court of Appeals and the DistrictCourt, all rely on the maximum allowable fee as the touchstone of constitutionality. Petitioner contends that the$1,000 cap on the fee ensures that the ordinance will not
result in content-based discrimination. The ordinance wasfound unconstitutional by the Court of Appeals because the
$1,000 cap was not sufficiently low to be "nominal." Neitherthe $1,000 cap on the fee charged, nor even some lower nominal cap, could save the ordinance because in this context, thelevel of the fee is irrelevant. A tax based on the content of
speech does not become more constitutional because it is asmall tax.

The lower courts derived their requirement that the per-mit fee be "nominal" from a sentence in the opinion in

Mur-dock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U. S. 105 (1943). In Murdock, the

Court invalidated a flat license fee levied on distributors ofreligious literature. In distinguishing the case from Cox,

where the Court upheld a permit fee, the Court stated: "Andthe fee is not a nominal one, imposed as a regulatory measure

and calculated to defray the expense of protecting those onthe streets and at home against the abuses of solicitors."
319 U. S., at 116. This sentence does not mean that an in-valid fee can be saved if it is nominal, or that only nominal
charges are constitutionally permissible. It reflects merelyone distinction between the facts in

Murdock and those inCox.

The tax at issue in Murdock was invalid because it wasunrelated to any legitimate state interest, not because it was
of a particular size. Similarly, the provision of the ForsythCounty ordinance relating to fees is invalid because it unconstitutionally ties the amount of the fee to the content of thespeech and lacks adequate procedural safeguards; no limit on
such a fee can remedy these constitutional violations.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice White,
Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

We granted certiorari in this case to consider the follow-ing question:

"Whether the provisions of the First Amendment tothe United States Constitution limit the amount of a license fee assessed pursuant to the provisions of a countyparade ordinance to a nominal sum or whether the
amount of the license fee may take into account the ac-tual expense incident to the administration of the ordinance and the maintenance of public order in the matterlicensed, up to the sum of $1,000.00 per day of the activity." Pet. for Cert. i.

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
takes up and decides other perceived unconstitutional de-fects in the Forsyth County ordinance. None of these claims

were passed upon by the Court of Appeals; that court de-cided only that the First Amendment forbade the charging
of more than a nominal fee for a permit to parade on publicstreets. Since that was the question decided by the Court
of Appeals below, the question which divides the Courts ofAppeals, and the question presented in the petition for certiorari, one would have thought that the Court would at leastauthoritatively decide, if not limit itself to, that question.

I
The answer to this question seems to me quite simple, be-cause it was authoritatively decided by this Court more than

half a century ago in Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U. S. 569(1941). There we confronted a state statute which required
payment of a license fee of up to $300 to local governmentsfor the right to parade in the public streets. The Supreme
Court of New Hampshire had construed the provision as re-quiring that the amount of the fee be adjusted based on the
size of the parade, as the fee "for a circus parade or a celebra-tion procession of length, each drawing crowds of observers,
would take into account the greater public expense of polic-ing the spectacle, compared with the slight expense of a less
expansive and attractive parade or procession." Id., at 577(internal quotation marks omitted). Under the state court's
construction, the fee provision was "not a revenue tax, butone to meet the expense incident to the administration of the
Act and to the maintenance of public order in the matterlicensed." Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). This
Court, in a unanimous opinion by Chief Justice Hughes, up-held the statute, saying:

"There is nothing contrary to the Constitution in thecharge of a fee limited to the purpose stated. The suggestion that a flat fee should have been charged fails totake account of the difficulty of framing a fair schedule

139Cite as: 505 U. S. 123 (1992)
Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
to meet all circumstances, and we perceive no constitu-tional ground for denying to local governments that

flexibility of adjustment of fees which in the light ofvarying conditions would tend to conserve rather than
impair the liberty sought."There is no evidence that the statute has been administered otherwise than in the fair and non-discriminatory manner which the state court has construed it to require." Ibid.
Two years later, in Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U. S.105 (1943), this Court confronted a municipal ordinance that

required payment of a flat license fee for the privilege ofcanvassing door-to-door to sell one's wares. Pursuant to
that ordinance, the city had levied the flat fee on a group ofJehovah's Witnesses who sought to distribute religious literature door-to-door for a small price. Id., at 106-107. TheCourt held that the flat license tax, as applied against the
hand distribution of religious tracts, was unconstitutional onthe ground that it was "a flat tax imposed on the exercise of
a privilege granted by the Bill of Rights." Id., at 113. Inmaking this ruling, the Court distinguished

Cox by statingthat "the fee is not a nominal one, imposed as a regulatory

measure and calculated to defray the expense of protectingthose on the streets and at home against the abuses of solicitors." 319 U. S., at 116. This language, which suggestedthat the fee involved in

Cox was only nominal, led the Courtof Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in the present case to

conclude that a city is prohibited from charging any morethan a nominal fee for a parade permit. 913 F. 2d 885, 890-
891, and n. 6 (1990). But the clear holding of Cox is to thecontrary. In that case, the Court expressly recognized that
the New Hampshire state statute allowed a city to levy muchmore than a nominal parade fee, as it stated that the fee
provision "had a permissible range from $300 to a nominalamount."

Cox v. New Hampshire, supra, at 576. The useof the word "nominal" in Murdock was thus unfortunate, as

505US1$98F 07-12-96 11:08:08 PAGES OPINPGT
140 FORSYTH COUNTY v. NATIONALIST MOVEMENT

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
it represented a mistaken characterization of the fee statutein Cox. But a mistaken allusion in a later case to the facts

of an earlier case does not by itself undermine the holding ofthe earlier case. The situations in Cox and Murdock were
clearly different; the first involved a sliding fee to accountfor administrative and security costs incurred as a result of
a parade on public property, while the second involved a flattax on protected religious expression. I believe that the decision in Cox squarely controls the disposition of the questionpresented in this case, and I therefore would explicitly hold
that the Constitution does not limit a parade license fee to anominal amount.

II
Instead of deciding the particular question on which wegranted certiorari, the Court concludes that the county ordinance is facially unconstitutional because it places too muchdiscretion in the hands of the county administrator and
forces parade participants to pay for the cost of controllingthose who might oppose their speech.

Ante, at 130-137.But, because the lower courts did not pass on these issues,

the Court is forced to rely on its own interpretation of theordinance in making these rulings. The Court unnecessarily reaches out to interpret the ordinance on its own at thisstage, even though there are no lower court factual findings
on the scope or administration of the ordinance. Becausethere are no such factual findings, I would not decide at this
point whether the ordinance fails for lack of adequate stand-ards to guide discretion or for incorporation of a "heckler's
veto," but would instead remand the case to the lower courtsto initially consider these issues.

The Court first finds fault with the alleged standardlessdiscretion possessed by the county administrator. The ordinance provides that the administrator "shall adjust theamount to be paid in order to meet the expense incident to
the administration of the Ordinance and to the maintenanceof public order in the matter licensed." App. to Pet. for

141Cite as: 505 U. S. 123 (1992)
Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
Cert. 119. In this regard, the ordinance clearly parallels theconstruction of the statute we upheld in

Cox. 312 U. S., at
577 (statute did not impose "a revenue tax, but one to meetthe expense incident to the administration of the Act and to

the maintenance of public order in the matter licensed" (internal quotation marks omitted)). The Court worries, how-ever, about the possibility that the administrator has the discretion to set fees based upon his approval of the messagesought to be conveyed, and concludes that "the county's authoritative constructio[n] of the ordinance" allows for such apossibility.

Ante, at 131. The Court apparently envisions
a situation where the administrator would impose a $1,000
parade fee on a group whose message he opposed, but would
waive the fee entirely for a similarly situated group with
whom he agreed. But the county has never rendered any
"authoritative construction" indicating that officials have
"unbridled discretion," ante, at 133, in setting parade fees,
nor has any lower court so found. In making its own factual
finding that the ordinance does allow for standardless fee
setting, this Court simply cites four situations in which the
administrator set permit fees--two fees of $100, one of $25,
and one of $5. Ante, at 132. On the basis of this evidence,

the Court finds that the administrator has unbridled discretion to set permit fees. The mere fact that the permit fees
differed in amount does not invalidate the ordinance, however, as our decision in Cox clearly allows a governmental
entity to adopt an adjustable permit fee scheme. See Cox
v. New Hampshire, supra, at 577 ("[W]e perceive no constitutional ground for denying to local governments th[e] flexibility of adjustment of fees"). It is true that the Constitution
does not permit a system in which the county administrator
may vary fees at his pleasure, but there has been no lower
court finding that that is what this fledgling ordinance creates. And, given the opportunity, the District Court might
find that the county has a policy that precludes the administrator from arbitrarily imposing fees. Of course, the District

142 FORSYTH COUNTY v. NATIONALIST MOVEMENT

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
Court might find that the administrator does possess toomuch discretion. In either case, I believe findings by the

District Court on the issue would be preferable.The Court relies on Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491
U. S. 781, 795-796 (1989), for the proposition that the county'sinterpretation of the ordinance must be considered. In that
case, however, we relied upon District Court findings con-cerning New York City's limiting interpretation of a noise
regulation. Id., at 795. I would prefer to remand this caseso that the Court might rely on such express findings here
as well.The Court's second reason for invalidating the ordinance
is its belief that any fee imposed will be based in part on thecost of security necessary to control those who oppose the
message endorsed by those marching in a parade. Assum-ing 100 people march in a parade and 10,000 line the route
in protest, for example, the Court worries that, under thisordinance, the county will charge a premium to control the
hostile crowd of 10,000, resulting in the kind of "heckler'sveto" we have previously condemned.

Ante, at 133-136.But there have been no lower court findings on the question

whether or not the county plans to base parade fees on antici-pated hostile crowds. It has not done so in any of the instances where it has so far imposed fees. Ante, at 132.And it most certainly did not do so in this case. The District
Court below noted that:

"[T]he instant ordinance alternatively permits fees to beassessed based upon `the expense incident to . . . the

maintenance of public order.' If the county had appliedthis portion of the statute, the phrase might run afoul
of . . . constitutional concerns. . . ."However, in the instant case, plaintiff did not base
their [sic] argument upon this phrase, but contendedthat the mere fact that a $100 fee was imposed is unconstitutional, especially in light of the organization's fi-nancial circumstances. The evidence was clear that the

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
fee was based solely upon the costs of processing theapplication and plaintiff produced no evidence to the

contrary." App. to Pet. for Cert. 14 (emphasis added).
The Court's analysis on this issue rests on an assumptionthat the county will interpret the phrase "maintenance of

public order" to support the imposition of fees based on op-position crowds. There is nothing in the record to support
this assumption, however, and I would remand for a hearingon this question.

For the foregoing reasons, I dissent.

NEW YORK v. UNITED STATES et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 91-543. Argued March 30, 1992--Decided June 19, 1992*
Faced with a looming shortage of disposal sites for low level radioactive

waste in 31 States, Congress enacted the Low-Level Radioactive Waste
Policy Amendments Act of 1985, which, among other things, imposes
upon States, either alone or in "regional compacts" with other States,
the obligation to provide for the disposal of waste generated within their
borders, and contains three provisions setting forth "incentives" to
States to comply with that obligation. The first set of incentives--the
monetary incentives--works in three steps: (1) States with disposal
sites are authorized to impose a surcharge on radioactive waste received
from other States; (2) the Secretary of Energy collects a portion of this
surcharge and places it in an escrow account; and (3) States achieving a
series of milestones in developing sites receive portions of this fund.
The second set of incentives--the access incentives--authorizes sited
States and regional compacts gradually to increase the cost of access to
their sites, and then to deny access altogether, to waste generated in
States that do not meet federal deadlines. The so-called third "incentive"--the take title provision--specifies that a State or regional compact that fails to provide for the disposal of all internally generated
waste by a particular date must, upon the request of the waste's generator or owner, take title to and possession of the waste and become liable
for all damages suffered by the generator or owner as a result of the
State's failure to promptly take possession. Petitioners, New York
State and two of its counties, filed this suit against the United States,
seeking a declaratory judgment that, inter alia, the three incentives
provisions are inconsistent with the Tenth Amendment--which declares
that "powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution,
nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States"--and with
the Guarantee Clause of Article IV, $ 4--which directs the United States
to "guarantee to every State . . . a Republican Form of Government."
The District Court dismissed the complaint, and the Court of Appeals
affirmed.

*Together with No. 91-558, County of Allegany, New York v. United
States et al., and No. 91-563, County of Cortland, New York v. United
States et al., also on certiorari to the same court.

Held:

1. The Act's monetary incentives and access incentives provisions
are consistent with the Constitution's allocation of power between the
Federal and State Governments, but the take title provision is not.
Pp. 155-183.

(a) In ascertaining whether any of the challenged provisions oversteps the boundary between federal and state power, the Court must
determine whether it is authorized by the affirmative grants to Congress contained in Article I's Commerce and Spending Clauses or
whether it invades the province of state sovereignty reserved by the
Tenth Amendment. Pp. 155-159.

(b) Although regulation of the interstate market in the disposal of
low level radioactive waste is well within Congress' Commerce Clause
authority, cf. Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 621-623, and
Congress could, if it wished, pre-empt entirely state regulation in this
area, a review of this Court's decisions, see, e. g., Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 288, and the history of the Constitutional Convention, demonstrates that Congress may
not commandeer the States' legislative processes by directly compelling
them to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program, but must exercise legislative authority directly upon individuals. Pp. 159-166.

(c) Nevertheless, there are a variety of methods, short of outright
coercion, by which Congress may urge a State to adopt a legislative
program consistent with federal interests. As relevant here, Congress
may, under its spending power, attach conditions on the receipt of federal funds, so long as such conditions meet four requirements. See,
e. g., South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 206-208, and n. 3. Moreover,
where Congress has the authority to regulate private activity under the
Commerce Clause, it may, as part of a program of "cooperative federalism," offer States the choice of regulating that activity according to
federal standards or having state law pre-empted by federal regulation.
See, e. g., Hodel, supra, at 288, 289. Pp. 166-169.

(d) This Court declines petitioners' invitation to construe the Act's
provision obligating the States to dispose of their radioactive wastes as
a separate mandate to regulate according to Congress' instructions.
That would upset the usual constitutional balance of federal and state
powers, whereas the constitutional problem is avoided by construing the
Act as a whole to comprise three sets of incentives to the States.
Pp. 169-170.

(e) The Act's monetary incentives are well within Congress' Commerce and Spending Clause authority and thus are not inconsistent with
the Tenth Amendment. The authorization to sited States to impose
surcharges is an unexceptionable exercise of Congress' power to enable

505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT
146 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATES

Syllabus
the States to burden interstate commerce. The Secretary's collection
of a percentage of the surcharge is no more than a federal tax on interstate commerce, which petitioners do not claim to be an invalid exercise
of either Congress' commerce or taxing power. Finally, in conditioning
the States' receipt of federal funds upon their achieving specified milestones, Congress has not exceeded its Spending Clause authority in any
of the four respects identified by this Court in Dole, supra, at 207-208.
Petitioners' objection to the form of the expenditures as nonfederal
is unavailing, since the Spending Clause has never been construed
to deprive Congress of the power to collect money in a segregated trust
fund and spend it for a particular purpose, and since the States'
ability largely to control whether they will pay into the escrow account or receive a share was expressly provided by Congress as a
method of encouraging them to regulate according to the federal plan.
Pp. 171-173.

(f) The Act's access incentives constitute a conditional exercise of
Congress' commerce power along the lines of that approved in Hodel,
supra, at 288, and thus do not intrude on the States' Tenth Amendment
sovereignty. These incentives present nonsited States with the choice
either of regulating waste disposal according to federal standards or
having their waste-producing residents denied access to disposal sites.
They are not compelled to regulate, expend any funds, or participate in
any federal program, and they may continue to regulate waste in their
own way if they do not accede to federal direction. Pp. 173-174.

(g) Because the Act's take title provision offers the States a
"choice" between the two unconstitutionally coercive alternatives--
either accepting ownership of waste or regulating according to Congress' instructions--the provision lies outside Congress' enumerated
powers and is inconsistent with the Tenth Amendment. On the one
hand, either forcing the transfer of waste from generators to the States
or requiring the States to become liable for the generators' damages
would "commandeer" States into the service of federal regulatory purposes. On the other hand, requiring the States to regulate pursuant to
Congress' direction would present a simple unconstitutional command
to implement legislation enacted by Congress. Thus, the States'
"choice" is no choice at all. Pp. 174-177.

(h) The United States' alternative arguments purporting to find
limited circumstances in which congressional compulsion of state regulation is constitutionally permissible--that such compulsion is justified
where the federal interest is sufficiently important; that the Constitution does, in some circumstances, permit federal directives to state governments; and that the Constitution endows Congress with the power

147Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)
Syllabus
to arbitrate disputes between States in interstate commerce--are rejected. Pp. 177-180.

(i) Also rejected is the sited state respondents' argument that the
Act cannot be ruled an unconstitutional infringement of New York sovereignty because officials of that State lent their support, and consented,
to the Act's passage. A departure from the Constitution's plan for the
intergovernmental allocation of authority cannot be ratified by the "consent" of state officials, since the Constitution protects state sovereignty
for the benefit of individuals, not States or their governments, and since
the officials' interests may not coincide with the Constitution's allocation. Nor does New York's prior support estop it from asserting the
Act's unconstitutionality. Pp. 180-183.

(j) Even assuming that the Guarantee Clause provides a basis upon
which a State or its subdivisions may sue to enjoin the enforcement of
a federal statute, petitioners have not made out a claim that the Act's
money incentives and access incentives provisions are inconsistent with
that Clause. Neither the threat of loss of federal funds nor the possibility that the State's waste producers may find themselves excluded from
other States' disposal sites can reasonably be said to deny New York a
republican form of government. Pp. 183-186.

2. The take title provision is severable from the rest of the Act, since
severance will not prevent the operation of the rest of the Act or defeat
its purpose of encouraging the States to attain local or regional selfsufficiency in low level radioactive waste disposal; since the Act still
includes two incentives to encourage States along this road; since
a State whose waste generators are unable to gain access to out-ofstate disposal sites may encounter considerable internal pressure to provide for disposal, even without the prospect of taking title; and since
any burden caused by New York's failure to secure a site will not be
borne by other States' residents because the sited regional compacts
need not accept New York's waste after the final transition period.
Pp. 186-187.

Opinion of the Court
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
These cases implicate one of our Nation's newest problemsof public policy and perhaps our oldest question of constitutional law. The public policy issue involves the disposal ofradioactive waste: In these cases, we address the constitutionality of three provisions of the Low-Level RadioactiveWaste Policy Amendments Act of 1985, Pub. L. 99-240, 99
Stat. 1842, 42 U. S. C. $ 2021b et seq. The constitutionalquestion is as old as the Constitution: It consists of discerning the proper division of authority between the FederalGovernment and the States. We conclude that while Congress has substantial power under the Constitution to en-courage the States to provide for the disposal of the radioactive waste generated within their borders, the Constitutiondoes not confer upon Congress the ability simply to compel
the States to do so. We therefore find that only two of theAct's three provisions at issue are consistent with the Constitution's allocation of power to the Federal Government.

I
We live in a world full of low level radioactive waste. Ra-dioactive material is present in luminous watch dials, smoke

alarms, measurement devices, medical fluids, research mate-rials, and the protective gear and construction materials
used by workers at nuclear power plants. Low level radio-active waste is generated by the Government, by hospitals,
by research institutions, and by various industries. Thewaste must be isolated from humans for long periods of time,

often for hundreds of years. Millions of cubic feet of lowlevel radioactive waste must be disposed of each year. See

App. 110a-111a; Berkovitz, Waste Wars: Did Congress"Nuke" State Sovereignty in the Low-Level Radioactive
Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985?, 11 Harv. Envtl. L.
Rev. 437, 439-440 (1987).Our Nation's first site for the land disposal of commercial

low level radioactive waste opened in 1962 in Beatty, Nevada.Five more sites opened in the following decade: Maxey Flats,
Kentucky (1963), West Valley, New York (1963), Hanford,Washington (1965), Sheffield, Illinois (1967), and Barnwell,
South Carolina (1971). Between 1975 and 1978, the Illinois
site closed because it was full, and water management problems caused the closure of the sites in Kentucky and New
York. As a result, since 1979 only three disposal sites--
those in Nevada, Washington, and South Carolina--have
been in operation. Waste generated in the rest of the
country must be shipped to one of these three sites for disposal. See Low-Level Radioactive Waste Regulation 39-40
(M. Burns ed. 1988).

In 1979, both the Washington and Nevada sites were
forced to shut down temporarily, leaving South Carolina to
shoulder the responsibility of storing low level radioactive
waste produced in every part of the country. The Governor
of South Carolina, understandably perturbed, ordered a 50%
reduction in the quantity of waste accepted at the Barnwell
site. The Governors of Washington and Nevada announced
plans to shut their sites permanently. App. 142a, 152a.

Faced with the possibility that the Nation would be left
with no disposal sites for low level radioactive waste, Congress responded by enacting the Low-Level Radioactive
Waste Policy Act, Pub. L. 96-573, 94 Stat. 3347. Relying
largely on a report submitted by the National Governors'
Association, see App. 105a-141a, Congress declared a federal
policy of holding each State "responsible for providing for
the availability of capacity either within or outside the State

Opinion of the Court
for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste generatedwithin its borders," and found that such waste could be disposed of "most safely and efficiently . . . on a regional basis."$ 4(a)(1), 94 Stat. 3348. The 1980 Act authorized States to
enter into regional compacts that, once ratified by Congress,
would have the authority beginning in 1986 to restrict theuse of their disposal facilities to waste generated within

member States. $ 4(a)(2)(B), 94 Stat. 3348. The 1980 Actincluded no penalties for States that failed to participate in
this plan.By 1985, only three approved regional compacts had operational disposal facilities; not surprisingly, these were the
compacts formed around South Carolina, Nevada, and Washington, the three sited States. The following year, the 1980
Act would have given these three compacts the ability to
exclude waste from nonmembers, and the remaining 31
States would have had no assured outlet for their low level
radioactive waste. With this prospect looming, Congress
once again took up the issue of waste disposal. The result
was the legislation challenged here, the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985.

The 1985 Act was again based largely on a proposal submitted by the National Governors' Association. In broad
outline, the Act embodies a compromise among the sited and
unsited States. The sited States agreed to extend for seven
years the period in which they would accept low level radioactive waste from other States. In exchange, the unsited
States agreed to end their reliance on the sited States by
1992.

The mechanics of this compromise are intricate. The Act
directs: "Each State shall be responsible for providing, either
by itself or in cooperation with other States, for the disposal
of . . . low-level radioactive waste generated within the
State," 42 U. S. C. $ 2021c(a)(1)(A), with the exception of
certain waste generated by the Federal Government,

$$ 2021c(a)(1)(B), 2021c(b). The Act authorizes States to

152 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
"enter into such [interstate] compacts as may be neces-sary to provide for the establishment and operation of

regional disposal facilities for low-level radioactive waste."$ 2021d(a)(2). For an additional seven years beyond the period contemplated by the 1980 Act, from the beginning of
1986 through the end of 1992, the three existing disposalsites "shall make disposal capacity available for low-level

radioactive waste generated by any source," with certainexceptions not relevant here. $ 2021e(a)(2). But the three
States in which the disposal sites are located are permittedto exact a graduated surcharge for waste arriving from outside the regional compact--in 1986-1987, $10 per cubic foot;
in 1988-1989, $20 per cubic foot; and in 1990-1992, $40 per
cubic foot. $ 2021e(d)(1). After the 7-year transition period
expires, approved regional compacts may exclude radioactive waste generated outside the region. $ 2021d(c).

The Act provides three types of incentives to encourage
the States to comply with their statutory obligation to provide for the disposal of waste generated within their borders.

1. Monetary incentives. One quarter of the surcharges
collected by the sited States must be transferred to an
escrow account held by the Secretary of Energy. $ 2021e
(d)(2)(A). The Secretary then makes payments from this
account to each State that has complied with a series of deadlines. By July 1, 1986, each State was to have ratified legislation either joining a regional compact or indicating an intent to develop a disposal facility within the State. $$ 2021e
(e)(1)(A), 2021e(d)(2)(B)(i). By January 1, 1988, each unsited
compact was to have identified the State in which its facility
would be located, and each compact or stand-alone State was
to have developed a siting plan and taken other identified
steps. $$ 2021e(e)(1)(B), 2021e(d)(2)(B)(ii). By January 1,
1990, each State or compact was to have filed a complete
application for a license to operate a disposal facility, or the
Governor of any State that had not filed an application was
to have certified that the State would be capable of disposing

153Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
of all waste generated in the State after 1992. $$ 2021e(e)(1)(C), 2021e(d)(2)(B)(iii). The rest of the account is to

be paid out to those States or compacts able to dispose ofall low level radioactive waste generated within their borders by January 1, 1993. $ 2021e(d)(2)(B)(iv). Each Statethat has not met the 1993 deadline must either take title
to the waste generated within its borders or forfeit to thewaste generators the incentive payments it has received.

$ 2021e(d)(2)(C).2.

Access incentives. The second type of incentive in-volves the denial of access to disposal sites. States that fail

to meet the July 1986 deadline may be charged twice theordinary surcharge for the remainder of 1986 and may be
denied access to disposal facilities thereafter. $ 2021e(e)(2)(A). States that fail to meet the 1988 deadline may be
charged double surcharges for the first half of 1988 and quad-ruple surcharges for the second half of 1988, and may be
denied access thereafter. $ 2021e(e)(2)(B). States that failto meet the 1990 deadline may be denied access. $ 2021e
(e)(2)(C). Finally, States that have not filed complete ap-plications by January 1, 1992, for a license to operate a disposal facility, or States belonging to compacts that have notfiled such applications, may be charged triple surcharges.

$$ 2021e(e)(1)(D), 2021e(e)(2)(D).3. The take title provision. The third type of incentive
is the most severe. The Act provides:

"If a State (or, where applicable, a compact region) inwhich low-level radioactive waste is generated is unable

to provide for the disposal of all such waste generatedwithin such State or compact region by January 1, 1996,
each State in which such waste is generated, upon therequest of the generator or owner of the waste, shall
take title to the waste, be obligated to take possessionof the waste, and shall be liable for all damages directly
or indirectly incurred by such generator or owner as aconsequence of the failure of the State to take possession

Opinion of the Court
of the waste as soon after January 1, 1996, as the generator or owner notifies the State that the waste is available
for shipment." $ 2021e(d)(2)(C).

These three incentives are the focus of petitioners' constitutional challenge.

In the seven years since the Act took effect, Congress has
approved nine regional compacts, encompassing 42 of the
States. All six unsited compacts and four of the unaffiliated
States have met the first three statutory milestones. Brief
for United States 10, n. 19; id., at 13, n. 25.

New York, a State whose residents generate a relatively
large share of the Nation's low level radioactive waste, did
not join a regional compact. Instead, the State complied
with the Act's requirements by enacting legislation providing for the siting and financing of a disposal facility in New
York. The State has identified five potential sites, three in
Allegany County and two in Cortland County. Residents of
the two counties oppose the State's choice of location. App.
29a-30a, 66a-68a.

Petitioners--the State of New York and the two counties--filed this suit against the United States in 1990. They
sought a declaratory judgment that the Act is inconsistent
with the Tenth and Eleventh Amendments to the Constitution, with the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment,
and with the Guarantee Clause of Article IV of the Constitution. The States of Washington, Nevada, and South Carolina intervened as defendants. The District Court dismissed the complaint. 757 F. Supp. 10 (NDNY 1990). The
Court of Appeals affirmed. 942 F. 2d 114 (CA2 1991). Petitioners have abandoned their due process and Eleventh
Amendment claims on their way up the appellate ladder; as
the cases stand before us, petitioners claim only that the Act
is inconsistent with the Tenth Amendment and the Guarantee Clause.

Opinion of the Court

II

A

In 1788, in the course of explaining to the citizens of New
York why the recently drafted Constitution provided for federal courts, Alexander Hamilton observed: "The erection of
a new government, whatever care or wisdom may distinguish the work, cannot fail to originate questions of intricacy
and nicety; and these may, in a particular manner, be expected to flow from the the establishment of a constitution
founded upon the total or partial incorporation of a number
of distinct sovereignties." The Federalist No. 82, p. 491 (C.
Rossiter ed. 1961). Hamilton's prediction has proved quite
accurate. While no one disputes the proposition that "[t]he
Constitution created a Federal Government of limited powers," Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 457 (1991); and while
the Tenth Amendment makes explicit that "[t]he powers not
delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people"; the task of ascertaining the constitutional line between federal and state power has given rise to
many of the Court's most difficult and celebrated cases. At
least as far back as Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304,
324 (1816), the Court has resolved questions "of great importance and delicacy" in determining whether particular sovereign powers have been granted by the Constitution to the
Federal Government or have been retained by the States.

These questions can be viewed in either of two ways. In
some cases the Court has inquired whether an Act of Congress is authorized by one of the powers delegated to Congress in Article I of the Constitution. See, e. g., Perez v.
United States, 402 U. S. 146 (1971); McCulloch v. Maryland,
4 Wheat. 316 (1819). In other cases the Court has sought to
determine whether an Act of Congress invades the province
of state sovereignty reserved by the Tenth Amendment.
See, e. g., Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Au505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT
156 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
thority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985); Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall.71 (1869). In a case like these, involving the division of

authority between federal and state governments, the twoinquiries are mirror images of each other. If a power is delegated to Congress in the Constitution, the Tenth Amendment expressly disclaims any reservation of that power tothe States; if a power is an attribute of state sovereignty

reserved by the Tenth Amendment, it is necessarily a powerthe Constitution has not conferred on Congress. See

United
States v. Oregon, 366 U. S. 643, 649 (1961); Case v. Bowles,327 U. S. 92, 102 (1946);

Oklahoma ex rel. Phillips v. Guy F.
Atkinson Co., 313 U. S. 508, 534 (1941).

It is in this sense that the Tenth Amendment "states but a
truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered."
United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 124 (1941). As Justice
Story put it, "[t]his amendment is a mere affirmation of what,
upon any just reasoning, is a necessary rule of interpreting
the constitution. Being an instrument of limited and enumerated powers, it follows irresistibly, that what is not conferred, is withheld, and belongs to the state authorities." 3
J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United
States 752 (1833). This has been the Court's consistent understanding: "The States unquestionably do retai[n] a significant measure of sovereign authority . . . to the extent
that the Constitution has not divested them of their original
powers and transferred those powers to the Federal Government." Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, supra, at 549 (internal quotation marks omitted).

Congress exercises its conferred powers subject to the limitations contained in the Constitution. Thus, for example,
under the Commerce Clause Congress may regulate publishers engaged in interstate commerce, but Congress is constrained in the exercise of that power by the First Amendment. The Tenth Amendment likewise restrains the power
of Congress, but this limit is not derived from the text of
the Tenth Amendment itself, which, as we have discussed,

505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT

157Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
is essentially a tautology. Instead, the Tenth Amendmentconfirms that the power of the Federal Government is subject to limits that may, in a given instance, reserve power tothe States. The Tenth Amendment thus directs us to determine, as in this case, whether an incident of state sovereignty is protected by a limitation on an Article I power.The benefits of this federal structure have been extensively cataloged elsewhere, see, e. g., Gregory v. Ashcroft,
supra, at 457-460; Merritt, The Guarantee Clause and State
Autonomy: Federalism for a Third Century, 88 Colum. L.Rev. 1, 3-10 (1988); McConnell, Federalism: Evaluating the

Founders' Design, 54 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1484, 1491-1511 (1987),
but they need not concern us here. Our task would be the
same even if one could prove that federalism secured no advantages to anyone. It consists not of devising our preferred system of government, but of understanding and
applying the framework set forth in the Constitution. "The
question is not what power the Federal Government ought
to have but what powers in fact have been given by the people." United States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1, 63 (1936).

This framework has been sufficiently flexible over the past
two centuries to allow for enormous changes in the nature
of government. The Federal Government undertakes activities today that would have been unimaginable to the Framers in two senses; first, because the Framers would not have
conceived that any government would conduct such activities; and second, because the Framers would not have believed that the Federal Government, rather than the States,
would assume such responsibilities. Yet the powers conferred upon the Federal Government by the Constitution
were phrased in language broad enough to allow for the
expansion of the Federal Government's role. Among the
provisions of the Constitution that have been particularly
important in this regard, three concern us here.

First, the Constitution allocates to Congress the power
"[t]o regulate Commerce . . . among the several States."

505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT
158 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3. Interstate commerce was an establishedfeature of life in the late 18th century. See,

e. g., The Federalist No. 42, p. 267 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) ("The defect ofpower in the existing Confederacy to regulate the commerce

between its several members [has] been clearly pointed out
by experience"). The volume of interstate commerce andthe range of commonly accepted objects of government regulation have, however, expanded considerably in the last 200years, and the regulatory authority of Congress has expanded along with them. As interstate commerce has be-come ubiquitous, activities once considered purely local have
come to have effects on the national economy, and have
accordingly come within the scope of Congress' commerce
power. See, e. g., Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294
(1964); Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942).

Second, the Constitution authorizes Congress "to pay the
Debts and provide for the . . . general Welfare of the United
States." Art. I, $ 8, cl. 1. As conventional notions of the
proper objects of government spending have changed over
the years, so has the ability of Congress to "fix the terms on
which it shall disburse federal money to the States." Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1,
17 (1981). Compare, e. g., United States v. Butler, supra, at
72-75 (spending power does not authorize Congress to subsidize farmers), with South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203
(1987) (spending power permits Congress to condition highway funds on States' adoption of minimum drinking age).
While the spending power is "subject to several general restrictions articulated in our cases," id., at 207, these restrictions have not been so severe as to prevent the regulatory
authority of Congress from generally keeping up with the
growth of the federal budget.

The Court's broad construction of Congress' power under
the Commerce and Spending Clauses has of course been
guided, as it has with respect to Congress' power generally,
by the Constitution's Necessary and Proper Clause, which

159Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
authorizes Congress "[t]o make all Laws which shall be nec-essary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing

Powers." U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 18. See, e. g., LegalTender Case, 110 U. S. 421, 449-450 (1884); McCulloch v.
Maryland, 4 Wheat., at 411-421.Finally, the Constitution provides that "the Laws of the
United States . . . shall be the supreme Law of the Land . . .any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the
Contrary notwithstanding." U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2. Asthe Federal Government's willingness to exercise power
within the confines of the Constitution has grown, the au-thority of the States has correspondingly diminished to the
extent that federal and state policies have conflicted. See,e. g., Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S. 85 (1983). We
have observed that the Supremacy Clause gives the FederalGovernment "a decided advantage in th[e] delicate balance"
the Constitution strikes between state and federal power.Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S., at 460.

The actual scope of the Federal Government's authoritywith respect to the States has changed over the years, therefore, but the constitutional structure underlying and limitingthat authority has not. In the end, just as a cup may be half
empty or half full, it makes no difference whether one viewsthe question at issue in these cases as one of ascertaining
the limits of the power delegated to the Federal Governmentunder the affirmative provisions of the Constitution or one
of discerning the core of sovereignty retained by the Statesunder the Tenth Amendment. Either way, we must determine whether any of the three challenged provisions ofthe Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act
of 1985 oversteps the boundary between federal and stateauthority.

B
Petitioners do not contend that Congress lacks the powerto regulate the disposal of low level radioactive waste.

Space in radioactive waste disposal sites is frequently sold

Opinion of the Court
by residents of one State to residents of another. Regula-tion of the resulting interstate market in waste disposal is

therefore well within Congress' authority under the Com-merce Clause. Cf.

Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S.
617, 621-623 (1978); Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v.
Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources, 504 U. S. 353, 359(1992). Petitioners likewise do not dispute that under the

Supremacy Clause Congress could, if it wished, pre-emptstate radioactive waste regulation. Petitioners contend
only that the Tenth Amendment limits the power of Con-gress to regulate in the way it has chosen. Rather than addressing the problem of waste disposal by directly regulating
the generators and disposers of waste, petitioners argue,
Congress has impermissibly directed the States to regulate
in this field.

Most of our recent cases interpreting the Tenth Amendment have concerned the authority of Congress to subject
state governments to generally applicable laws. The
Court's jurisprudence in this area has traveled an unsteady
path. See Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183 (1968) (state
schools and hospitals are subject to Fair Labor Standards
Act); National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833 (1976)
(overruling Wirtz) (state employers are not subject to Fair
Labor Standards Act); Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan
Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985) (overruling National
League of Cities) (state employers are once again subject to
Fair Labor Standards Act). See also New York v. United
States, 326 U. S. 572 (1946); Fry v. United States, 421 U. S.
542 (1975); Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., 455
U. S. 678 (1982); EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226 (1983);
South Carolina v. Baker, 485 U. S. 505 (1988); Gregory v.
Ashcroft, supra. This litigation presents no occasion to
apply or revisit the holdings of any of these cases, as this is
not a case in which Congress has subjected a State to the
same legislation applicable to private parties. Cf. FERC v.
Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 758-759 (1982).

Opinion of the Court
This litigation instead concerns the circumstances underwhich Congress may use the States as implements of regulation; that is, whether Congress may direct or otherwise moti-vate the States to regulate in a particular field or a particular
way. Our cases have established a few principles that guideour resolution of the issue.

1
As an initial matter, Congress may not simply "comman-dee[r] the legislative processes of the States by directly compelling them to enact and enforce a federal regulatory pro-gram." Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation
Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 288 (1981). In Hodel, the Courtupheld the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of
1977 precisely because it did not "commandeer" the Statesinto regulating mining. The Court found that "the States
are not compelled to enforce the steep-slope standards, toexpend any state funds, or to participate in the federal regulatory program in any manner whatsoever. If a State doesnot wish to submit a proposed permanent program that complies with the Act and implementing regulations, the full reg-ulatory burden will be borne by the Federal Government."
Ibid.The Court reached the same conclusion the following year
in FERC v. Mississippi, supra. At issue in FERC was thePublic Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, a federal statute encouraging the States in various ways to develop pro-grams to combat the Nation's energy crisis. We observed
that "this Court never has sanctioned explicitly a federalcommand to the States to promulgate and enforce laws and
regulations." Id., at 761-762. As in Hodel, the Court up-held the statute at issue because it did not view the statute
as such a command. The Court emphasized: "Titles I andIII of [the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978
(PURPA)] require only consideration of federal standards.And if a State has no utilities commission, or simply stops
regulating in the field, it need not even entertain the federal

505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT
162 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
proposals." 456 U. S., at 764 (emphasis in original). Be-cause "[t]here [wa]s nothing in PURPA `directly compelling'

the States to enact a legislative program," the statute wasnot inconsistent with the Constitution's division of authority
between the Federal Government and the States. Id., at
765 (quoting Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., supra, at 288). See also South Carolina v.
Baker, supra, at 513 (noting "the possibility that the TenthAmendment might set some limits on Congress' power to

compel States to regulate on behalf of federal interests");
Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,
supra, at 556 (same).

These statements in FERC and Hodel were not innovations. While Congress has substantial powers to govern the
Nation directly, including in areas of intimate concern to the
States, the Constitution has never been understood to confer
upon Congress the ability to require the States to govern
according to Congress' instructions. See Coyle v. Smith,
221 U. S. 559, 565 (1911). The Court has been explicit about
this distinction. "Both the States and the United States existed before the Constitution. The people, through that instrument, established a more perfect union by substituting
a national government, acting, with ample power, directly
upon the citizens, instead of the Confederate government,
which acted with powers, greatly restricted, only upon the
States." Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall., at 76 (emphasis
added). The Court has made the same point with more rhetorical flourish, although perhaps with less precision, on a
number of occasions. In Chief Justice Chase's much-quoted
words, "the preservation of the States, and the maintenance
of their governments, are as much within the design and care
of the Constitution as the preservation of the Union and the
maintenance of the National government. The Constitution, in all its provisions, looks to an indestructible Union,
composed of indestructible States." Texas v. White, 7 Wall.
700, 725 (1869). See also Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, 269

Opinion of the Court
U. S. 514, 523 (1926) ("[N]either government may destroy theother nor curtail in any substantial manner the exercise of

its powers"); Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U. S. 455, 458 (1990)("[U]nder our federal system, the States possess sovereignty
concurrent with that of the Federal Government"); Gregory
v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S., at 461 ("[T]he States retain substantialsovereign powers under our constitutional scheme, powers

with which Congress does not readily interfere").Indeed, the question whether the Constitution should permit Congress to employ state governments as regulatoryagencies was a topic of lively debate among the Framers.
Under the Articles of Confederation, Congress lacked the
authority in most respects to govern the people directly. In
practice, Congress "could not directly tax or legislate upon
individuals; it had no explicit `legislative' or `governmental'
power to make binding `law' enforceable as such." Amar, Of
Sovereignty and Federalism, 96 Yale L. J. 1425, 1447 (1987).

The inadequacy of this governmental structure was responsible in part for the Constitutional Convention. Alexander Hamilton observed: "The great and radical vice in the
construction of the existing Confederation is in the principle
of legislation for states or governments, in their corporate or collective capacities, and as contradistinguished from the individuals of whom they consist." The
Federalist No. 15, p. 108 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). As Hamilton
saw it, "we must resolve to incorporate into our plan those
ingredients which may be considered as forming the characteristic difference between a league and a government; we
must extend the authority of the Union to the persons of the
citizens--the only proper objects of government." Id., at
109. The new National Government "must carry its agency
to the persons of the citizens. It must stand in need of
no intermediate legislations . . . . The government of

the Union, like that of each State, must be able to address
itself immediately to the hopes and fears of individuals."
Id., No. 16, at 116.

164 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
The Convention generated a great number of proposals forthe structure of the new Government, but two quickly took

center stage. Under the Virginia Plan, as first introducedby Edmund Randolph, Congress would exercise legislative
authority directly upon individuals, without employing the
States as intermediaries. 1 Records of the Federal Conven-tion of 1787, p. 21 (M. Farrand ed. 1911). Under the New

Jersey Plan, as first introduced by William Paterson, Con-gress would continue to require the approval of the States
before legislating, as it had under the Articles of Confedera-tion. 1

id., at 243-244. These two plans underwent various
revisions as the Convention progressed, but they remained
the two primary options discussed by the delegates. One
frequently expressed objection to the New Jersey Plan was
that it might require the Federal Government to coerce the
States into implementing legislation. As Randolph explained the distinction, "[t]he true question is whether we
shall adhere to the federal plan [i. e., the New Jersey Plan],
or introduce the national plan. The insufficiency of the former has been fully displayed . . . . There are but two modes,
by which the end of a Gen[eral] Gov[ernment] can be attained: the 1st is by coercion as proposed by Mr. P[aterson's]
plan[, the 2nd] by real legislation as prop[osed] by the other
plan. Coercion [is] impracticable, expensive, cruel to individuals. . . . We must resort therefore to a national Legislation over individuals." 1 id., at 255-256 (emphasis in
original). Madison echoed this view: "The practicability of
making laws, with coercive sanctions, for the States as political bodies, had been exploded on all hands." 2 id., at 9.

Under one preliminary draft of what would become the
New Jersey Plan, state governments would occupy a position
relative to Congress similar to that contemplated by the Act
at issue in these cases: "[T]he laws of the United States ought,
as far as may be consistent with the common interests of

the Union, to be carried into execution by the judiciary and
executive officers of the respective states, wherein the exe505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
cution thereof is required." 3 id., at 616. This idea appar-ently never even progressed so far as to be debated by the

delegates, as contemporary accounts of the Convention donot mention any such discussion. The delegates' many descriptions of the Virginia and New Jersey Plans speak only
in general terms about whether Congress was to derive itsauthority from the people or from the States, and whether it

was to issue directives to individuals or to States. See 1 id.,at 260-280.

In the end, the Convention opted for a Constitution inwhich Congress would exercise its legislative authority directly over individuals rather than over States; for a variety
of reasons, it rejected the New Jersey Plan in favor of the
Virginia Plan. 1 id., at 313. This choice was made clear to
the subsequent state ratifying conventions. Oliver Ellsworth, a member of the Connecticut delegation in Philadelphia, explained the distinction to his State's convention:
"This Constitution does not attempt to coerce sovereign bodies, states, in their political capacity. . . . But this legal coercion singles out the . . . individual." 2 J. Elliot, Debates on
the Federal Constitution 197 (2d ed. 1863). Charles Pinckney, another delegate at the Constitutional Convention, emphasized to the South Carolina House of Representatives
that in Philadelphia "the necessity of having a government
which should at once operate upon the people, and not upon
the states, was conceived to be indispensable by every delegation present." 4 id., at 256. Rufus King, one of Massachusetts' delegates, returned home to support ratification by
recalling the Commonwealth's unhappy experience under the
Articles of Confederation and arguing: "Laws, to be effective, therefore, must not be laid on states, but upon individuals." 2 id., at 56. At New York's convention, Hamilton (another delegate in Philadelphia) exclaimed: "But can we
believe that one state will ever suffer itself to be used as an
instrument of coercion? The thing is a dream; it is impossible. Then we are brought to this dilemma--either a federal

standing army is to enforce the requisitions, or the federal
treasury is left without supplies, and the government without support. What, sir, is the cure for this great evil?
Nothing, but to enable the national laws to operate on individuals, in the same manner as those of the states do." 2
id., at 233. At North Carolina's convention, Samuel Spencer
recognized that "all the laws of the Confederation were binding on the states in their political capacities, . . . but now
the thing is entirely different. The laws of Congress will be
binding on individuals." 4 id., at 153.

In providing for a stronger central government, therefore,
the Framers explicitly chose a Constitution that confers upon
Congress the power to regulate individuals, not States. As
we have seen, the Court has consistently respected this
choice. We have always understood that even where Congress has the authority under the Constitution to pass laws
requiring or prohibiting certain acts, it lacks the power directly to compel the States to require or prohibit those acts.
E. g., FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S., at 762-766; Hodel v.
Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452
U. S., at 288-289; Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall., at 76.
The allocation of power contained in the Commerce Clause,
for example, authorizes Congress to regulate interstate commerce directly; it does not authorize Congress to regulate
state governments' regulation of interstate commerce.

2
This is not to say that Congress lacks the ability to encourage a State to regulate in a particular way, or that Congress
may not hold out incentives to the States as a method of
influencing a State's policy choices. Our cases have identified a variety of methods, short of outright coercion, by
which Congress may urge a State to adopt a legislative
program consistent with federal interests. Two of these
methods are of particular relevance here.

167Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
First, under Congress' spending power, "Congress may at-tach conditions on the receipt of federal funds."

South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S., at 206. Such conditions must (amongother requirements) bear some relationship to the purpose

of the federal spending, id., at 207-208, and n. 3; otherwise,
of course, the spending power could render academic theConstitution's other grants and limits of federal authority.

Where the recipient of federal funds is a State, as is notunusual today, the conditions attached to the funds by
Congress may influence a State's legislative choices. SeeKaden, Politics, Money, and State Sovereignty: The Judicial
Role, 79 Colum. L. Rev. 847, 874-881 (1979). Dole was one
such case: The Court found no constitutional flaw in a federal
statute directing the Secretary of Transportation to withhold federal highway funds from States failing to adopt Congress' choice of a minimum drinking age. Similar examples
abound. See, e. g., Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448,
478-480 (1980); Massachusetts v. United States, 435 U. S.
444, 461-462 (1978); Lau v. Nichols, 414 U. S. 563, 568-569
(1974); Oklahoma v. United States Civil Service Comm'n,
330 U. S. 127, 142-144 (1947).

Second, where Congress has the authority to regulate private activity under the Commerce Clause, we have recognized Congress' power to offer States the choice of regulating that activity according to federal standards or having
state law pre-empted by federal regulation. Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., supra, at
288. See also FERC v. Mississippi, supra, at 764-765.
This arrangement, which has been termed "a program of cooperative federalism," Hodel, supra, at 289, is replicated in
numerous federal statutory schemes. These include the
Clean Water Act, 86 Stat. 816, as amended, 33 U. S. C. $ 1251
et seq., see Arkansas v. Oklahoma, 503 U. S. 91, 101 (1992)
(Clean Water Act "anticipates a partnership between the
States and the Federal Government, animated by a shared
objective"); the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970,

et seq., see Kenaitze Indian Tribe v. Alaska,
860 F. 2d 312, 314 (CA9 1988), cert. denied, 491 U. S. 905(1989).

By either of these methods, as by any other permissiblemethod of encouraging a State to conform to federal policy
choices, the residents of the State retain the ultimate decision as to whether or not the State will comply. If a State's
citizens view federal policy as sufficiently contrary to local
interests, they may elect to decline a federal grant. If state
residents would prefer their government to devote its attention and resources to problems other than those deemed important by Congress, they may choose to have the Federal
Government rather than the State bear the expense of a federally mandated regulatory program, and they may continue
to supplement that program to the extent state law is not
pre-empted. Where Congress encourages state regulation
rather than compelling it, state governments remain responsive to the local electorate's preferences; state officials remain accountable to the people.

By contrast, where the Federal Government compels
States to regulate, the accountability of both state and federal officials is diminished. If the citizens of New York, for
example, do not consider that making provision for the disposal of radioactive waste is in their best interest, they may
elect state officials who share their view. That view can always be pre-empted under the Supremacy Clause if it is contrary to the national view, but in such a case it is the Federal
Government that makes the decision in full view of the public, and it will be federal officials that suffer the consequences
if the decision turns out to be detrimental or unpopular.

Opinion of the Court
But where the Federal Government directs the States toregulate, it may be state officials who will bear the brunt of

public disapproval, while the federal officials who devised theregulatory program may remain insulated from the electoral
ramifications of their decision. Accountability is thus dimin-ished when, due to federal coercion, elected state officials
cannot regulate in accordance with the views of the localelectorate in matters not pre-empted by federal regulation.
See Merritt, 88 Colum. L. Rev., at 61-62; La Pierre, PoliticalAccountability in the National Political Process--The Alternative to Judicial Review of Federalism Issues, 80 Nw. U. L.Rev. 577, 639-665 (1985).

With these principles in mind, we turn to the three chal-lenged provisions of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985.

III
The parties in these cases advance two quite different viewsof the Act. As petitioners see it, the Act imposes a requirement directly upon the States that they regulate in the fieldof radioactive waste disposal in order to meet Congress'
mandate that "[e]ach State shall be responsible for providing. . . for the disposal of . . . low-level radioactive waste." 42
U. S. C. $ 2021c(a)(1)(A). Petitioners understand this provi-sion as a direct command from Congress, enforceable independent of the three sets of incentives provided by the Act.Respondents, on the other hand, read this provision together
with the incentives, and see the Act as affording the Statesthree sets of choices. According to respondents, the Act
permits a State to choose first between regulating pursuantto federal standards and losing the right to a share of the
Secretary of Energy's escrow account; to choose second be-tween regulating pursuant to federal standards and progressively losing access to disposal sites in other States; and tochoose third between regulating pursuant to federal standards and taking title to the waste generated within the State.

505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT
170 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Respondents thus interpret $ 2021c(a)(1)(A), despite the statute's use of the word "shall," to provide no more than an
option which a State may elect or eschew.

The Act could plausibly be understood either as a mandate
to regulate or as a series of incentives. Under petitioners'
view, however, $ 2021c(a)(1)(A) of the Act would clearly
"commandee[r] the legislative processes of the States by directly compelling them to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program." Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S., at 288. We must reject this
interpretation of the provision for two reasons. First, such
an outcome would, to say the least, "upset the usual constitutional balance of federal and state powers." Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S., at 460. "[I]t is incumbent upon the federal
courts to be certain of Congress' intent before finding that
federal law overrides this balance," ibid. (internal quotation
marks omitted), but the Act's amenability to an equally plausible alternative construction prevents us from possessing
such certainty. Second, "where an otherwise acceptable
construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional
problems, the Court will construe the statute to avoid such
problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the
intent of Congress." Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida
Gulf Coast Building & Construction Trades Council, 485
U. S. 568, 575 (1988). This rule of statutory construction
pushes us away from petitioners' understanding of $ 2021c
(a)(1)(A) of the Act, under which it compels the States to
regulate according to Congress' instructions.

We therefore decline petitioners' invitation to construe

$ 2021c(a)(1)(A), alone and in isolation, as a command to the
States independent of the remainder of the Act. Construed
as a whole, the Act comprises three sets of "incentives" for
the States to provide for the disposal of low level radioactive
waste generated within their borders. We consider each in
turn.

Opinion of the Court

A
The first set of incentives works in three steps. First,Congress has authorized States with disposal sites to impose

a surcharge on radioactive waste received from other States.Second, the Secretary of Energy collects a portion of this
surcharge and places the money in an escrow account.Third, States achieving a series of milestones receive portions of this fund.The first of these steps is an unexceptionable exercise of
Congress' power to authorize the States to burden interstatecommerce. While the Commerce Clause has long been understood to limit the States' ability to discriminate againstinterstate commerce, see, e. g., Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502
U. S. 437, 454-455 (1992); Cooley v. Board of Wardens of Portof Philadelphia ex rel. Society for Relief of Distressed Pilots, 12 How. 299 (1852), that limit may be lifted, as it hasbeen here, by an expression of the "unambiguous intent" of
Congress. Wyoming, supra, at 458; Prudential Ins. Co. v.
Benjamin, 328 U. S. 408, 427-431 (1946). Whether or notthe States would be permitted to burden the interstate

transport of low level radioactive waste in the absence ofCongress' approval, the States can clearly do so with Congress' approval, which is what the Act gives them.The second step, the Secretary's collection of a percentage
of the surcharge, is no more than a federal tax on interstatecommerce, which petitioners do not claim to be an invalid
exercise of either Congress' commerce or taxing power. Cf.
United States v. Sanchez, 340 U. S. 42, 44-45 (1950); StewardMachine Co. v. Davis, 301 U. S. 548, 581-583 (1937).

The third step is a conditional exercise of Congress' au-thority under the Spending Clause: Congress has placed conditions--the achievement of the milestones--on the receiptof federal funds. Petitioners do not contend that Congress
has exceeded its authority in any of the four respects ourcases have identified. See generally

South Dakota v. Dole,483 U. S., at 207-208. The expenditure is for the general

Opinion of the Court
welfare, Helvering v. Davis, 301 U. S. 619, 640-641 (1937);the States are required to use the money they receive for

the purpose of assuring the safe disposal of radioactivewaste. 42 U. S. C. $ 2021e(d)(2)(E). The conditions imposed
are unambiguous, Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.
Halderman, 451 U. S., at 17; the Act informs the States ex-actly what they must do and by when they must do it in

order to obtain a share of the escrow account. The condi-tions imposed are reasonably related to the purpose of the
expenditure, Massachusetts v. United States, 435 U. S., at461; both the conditions and the payments embody Congress'
efforts to address the pressing problem of radioactive waste
disposal. Finally, petitioners do not claim that the conditions imposed by the Act violate any independent constitutional prohibition. Lawrence County v. Lead-Deadwood
School Dist. No. 40-1, 469 U. S. 256, 269-270 (1985).

Petitioners contend nevertheless that the form of these
expenditures removes them from the scope of Congress'
spending power. Petitioners emphasize the Act's instruction to the Secretary of Energy to "deposit all funds received
in a special escrow account. The funds so deposited shall
not be the property of the United States." 42 U. S. C.

$ 2021e(d)(2)(A). Petitioners argue that because the money
collected and redisbursed to the States is kept in an account
separate from the general treasury, because the Secretary
holds the funds only as a trustee, and because the States
themselves are largely able to control whether they will pay
into the escrow account or receive a share, the Act "in no
manner calls for the spending of federal funds." Reply
Brief for Petitioner State of New York 6.

The Constitution's grant to Congress of the authority to
"pay the Debts and provide for the . . . general Welfare" has
never, however, been thought to mandate a particular form
of accounting. A great deal of federal spending comes from
segregated trust funds collected and spent for a particular
purpose. See, e. g., 23 U. S. C. $ 118 (Highway Trust Fund);

505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT

173Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
42 U. S. C. $ 401(a) (Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insur-ance Trust Fund); 42 U. S. C. $ 401(b) (Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund); 42 U. S. C. $ 1395t (Federal Supplemen-tary Medical Insurance Trust Fund). The Spending Clause
has never been construed to deprive Congress of the powerto structure federal spending in this manner. Petitioners'
argument regarding the States' ability to determine the es-crow account's income and disbursements ignores the fact
that Congress specifically provided the States with this abil-ity as a method of encouraging the States to regulate according to the federal plan. That the States are able to choosewhether they will receive federal funds does not make the
resulting expenditures any less federal; indeed, the locationof such choice in the States is an inherent element in any
conditional exercise of Congress' spending power.The Act's first set of incentives, in which Congress has
conditioned grants to the States upon the States' attainmentof a series of milestones, is thus well within the authority of
Congress under the Commerce and Spending Clauses. Be-cause the first set of incentives is supported by affirmative
constitutional grants of power to Congress, it is not incon-sistent with the Tenth Amendment.

B
In the second set of incentives, Congress has authorizedStates and regional compacts with disposal sites gradually

to increase the cost of access to the sites, and then to denyaccess altogether, to radioactive waste generated in States
that do not meet federal deadlines. As a simple regulation,this provision would be within the power of Congress to authorize the States to discriminate against interstate com-merce. See Northeast Bancorp, Inc. v. Board of Governors,
FRS, 472 U. S. 159, 174-175 (1985). Where federal regula-tion of private activity is within the scope of the Commerce
Clause, we have recognized the ability of Congress to offerStates the choice of regulating that activity according to fed505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT
174 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
eral standards or having state law pre-empted by federalregulation. See Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S., at 288; FERC v. Mississippi,456 U. S., at 764-765.

This is the choice presented to nonsited States by the Act'ssecond set of incentives: States may either regulate the disposal of radioactive waste according to federal standards byattaining local or regional self-sufficiency, or their residents
who produce radioactive waste will be subject to federal reg-ulation authorizing sited States and regions to deny access
to their disposal sites. The affected States are not com-pelled by Congress to regulate, because any burden caused
by a State's refusal to regulate will fall on those who gener-ate waste and find no outlet for its disposal, rather than on
the State as a sovereign. A State whose citizens do notwish it to attain the Act's milestones may devote its attention
and its resources to issues its citizens deem more worthy;the choice remains at all times with the residents of the
State, not with Congress. The State need not expend anyfunds, or participate in any federal program, if local residents
do not view such expenditures or participation as worth-while. Cf.

Hodel, supra, at 288. Nor must the State aban-don the field if it does not accede to federal direction; the

State may continue to regulate the generation and disposalof radioactive waste in any manner its citizens see fit.

The Act's second set of incentives thus represents a con-ditional exercise of Congress' commerce power, along the
lines of those we have held to be within Congress' author-ity. As a result, the second set of incentives does not intrude on the sovereignty reserved to the States by theTenth Amendment.

C
The take title provision is of a different character. Thisthird so-called "incentive" offers States, as an alternative to

regulating pursuant to Congress' direction, the option of tak-ing title to and possession of the low level radioactive waste

505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT

175Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
generated within their borders and becoming liable for alldamages waste generators suffer as a result of the States'

failure to do so promptly. In this provision, Congress hascrossed the line distinguishing encouragement from coercion.

We must initially reject respondents' suggestion that, because the take title provision will not take effect until Janu-ary 1, 1996, petitioners' challenge thereto is unripe. It takes

many years to develop a new disposal site. All parties agreethat New York must take action now in order to avoid the
take title provision's consequences, and no party suggeststhat the State's waste generators will have ceased producing
waste by 1996. The issue is thus ripe for review. Cf. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Comm'n, 461 U. S. 190, 201 (1983);
Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U. S. 102, 144-
145 (1974).

The take title provision offers state governments a
"choice" of either accepting ownership of waste or regulating
according to the instructions of Congress. Respondents do
not claim that the Constitution would authorize Congress to
impose either option as a freestanding requirement. On one
hand, the Constitution would not permit Congress simply to
transfer radioactive waste from generators to state governments. Such a forced transfer, standing alone, would in
principle be no different than a congressionally compelled
subsidy from state governments to radioactive waste producers. The same is true of the provision requiring the States
to become liable for the generators' damages. Standing
alone, this provision would be indistinguishable from an Act
of Congress directing the States to assume the liabilities of
certain state residents. Either type of federal action would
"commandeer" state governments into the service of federal
regulatory purposes, and would for this reason be inconsistent with the Constitution's division of authority between federal and state governments. On the other hand, the second
alternative held out to state governments--regulating pur505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT
176 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
suant to Congress' direction--would, standing alone, presenta simple command to state governments to implement legislation enacted by Congress. As we have seen, the Constitu-tion does not empower Congress to subject state governments to this type of instruction.

Because an instruction to state governments to take titleto waste, standing alone, would be beyond the authority of

Congress, and because a direct order to regulate, standingalone, would also be beyond the authority of Congress, it
follows that Congress lacks the power to offer the States achoice between the two. Unlike the first two sets of incentives, the take title incentive does not represent the conditional exercise of any congressional power enumerated in the
Constitution. In this provision, Congress has not held out
the threat of exercising its spending power or its commerce
power; it has instead held out the threat, should the States
not regulate according to one federal instruction, of simply
forcing the States to submit to another federal instruction.
A choice between two unconstitutionally coercive regulatory
techniques is no choice at all. Either way, "the Act commandeers the legislative processes of the States by directly
compelling them to enact and enforce a federal regulatory
program," Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation
Assn., Inc., supra, at 288, an outcome that has never been
understood to lie within the authority conferred upon Congress by the Constitution.

Respondents emphasize the latitude given to the States to
implement Congress' plan. The Act enables the States to
regulate pursuant to Congress' instructions in any number
of different ways. States may avoid taking title by contracting with sited regional compacts, by building a disposal
site alone or as part of a compact, or by permitting private
parties to build a disposal site. States that host sites may
employ a wide range of designs and disposal methods, subject only to broad federal regulatory limits. This line of reasoning, however, only underscores the critical alternative a

177Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
State lacks: A State may not decline to administer the fed-eral program. No matter which path the State chooses, it

must follow the direction of Congress.The take title provision appears to be unique. No other
federal statute has been cited which offers a state govern-ment no option other than that of implementing legislation
enacted by Congress. Whether one views the take title pro-vision as lying outside Congress' enumerated powers, or as
infringing upon the core of state sovereignty reserved bythe Tenth Amendment, the provision is inconsistent with the
federal structure of our Government established by theConstitution.

IV
Respondents raise a number of objections to this under-standing of the limits of Congress' power.

A
The United States proposes three alternative views of theconstitutional line separating state and federal authority.

While each view concedes that Congress generally may notcompel state governments to regulate pursuant to federal
direction, each purports to find a limited domain in whichsuch coercion is permitted by the Constitution.

First, the United States argues that the Constitution'sprohibition of congressional directives to state governments
can be overcome where the federal interest is sufficientlyimportant to justify state submission. This argument contains a kernel of truth: In determining whether the TenthAmendment limits the ability of Congress to subject state
governments to generally applicable laws, the Court has insome cases stated that it will evaluate the strength of federal
interests in light of the degree to which such laws wouldprevent the State from functioning as a sovereign; that is,
the extent to which such generally applicable laws would im-pede a state government's responsibility to represent and be
accountable to the citizens of the State. See, e. g., EEOC v.

505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT
178 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Wyoming, 460 U. S., at 242, n. 17; Transportation Union v.
Long Island R. Co., 455 U. S., at 684, n. 9; National League
of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S., at 853. The Court has morerecently departed from this approach. See,

e. g., South Carolina v. Baker, 485 U. S., at 512-513; Garcia v. San Antonio
Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S., at 556-557. Butwhether or not a particularly strong federal interest enables

Congress to bring state governments within the orbit of gen-erally applicable

federal regulation, no Member of the Court
has ever suggested that such a federal interest would enableCongress to command a state government to enact

state regulation. No matter how powerful the federal interest involved, the Constitution simply does not give Congress the
authority to require the States to regulate. The Constitution instead gives Congress the authority to regulate matters directly and to pre-empt contrary state regulation.
Where a federal interest is sufficiently strong to cause Congress to legislate, it must do so directly; it may not conscript
state governments as its agents.

Second, the United States argues that the Constitution
does, in some circumstances, permit federal directives to
state governments. Various cases are cited for this proposition, but none support it. Some of these cases discuss the
well established power of Congress to pass laws enforceable
in state courts. See Testa v. Katt, 330 U. S. 386 (1947);
Palmore v. United States, 411 U. S. 389, 402 (1973); see also
Second Employers' Liability Cases, 223 U. S. 1, 57 (1912);
Claflin v. Houseman, 93 U. S. 130, 136-137 (1876). These
cases involve no more than an application of the Supremacy
Clause's provision that federal law "shall be the supreme
Law of the Land," enforceable in every State. More to the
point, all involve congressional regulation of individuals, not
congressional requirements that States regulate. Federal
statutes enforceable in state courts do, in a sense, direct
state judges to enforce them, but this sort of federal "direction" of state judges is mandated by the text of the Suprem505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT

acy Clause. No comparable constitutional provision author-izes Congress to command state legislatures to legislate.

Additional cases cited by the United States discuss thepower of federal

courts to order state officials to comply with
federal law. See Puerto Rico v. Branstad, 483 U. S. 219, 228
(1987); Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U. S. 658, 695 (1979); Illinois v. City of Milwaukee, 406 U. S. 91, 106-108 (1972); seealso

Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U. S. 1, 18-19 (1958); Brown v.
Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294, 300 (1955); Ex parte
Young, 209 U. S. 123, 155-156 (1908). Again, however, the
text of the Constitution plainly confers this authority on the
federal courts, the "judicial Power" of which "shall extend
to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, [and] the Laws of the United States . . . ; [and] to Controversies between two or more States; [and] between a
State and Citizens of another State." U. S. Const., Art. III,

$ 2. The Constitution contains no analogous grant of authority to Congress. Moreover, the Supremacy Clause makes
federal law paramount over the contrary positions of state
officials; the power of federal courts to enforce federal law
thus presupposes some authority to order state officials to
comply. See Puerto Rico v. Branstad, supra, at 227-228
(overruling Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66 (1861)).

In sum, the cases relied upon by the United States hold
only that federal law is enforceable in state courts and that
federal courts may in proper circumstances order state officials to comply with federal law, propositions that by no
means imply any authority on the part of Congress to mandate state regulation.

Third, the United States, supported by the three sited regional compacts as amici, argues that the Constitution envisions a role for Congress as an arbiter of interstate disputes.
The United States observes that federal courts, and this
Court in particular, have frequently resolved conflicts among
States. See, e. g., Arkansas v. Oklahoma, 503 U. S. 91

180 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
(1992); Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U. S. 437 (1992). Manyof these disputes have involved the allocation of shared resources among the States, a category perhaps broad enoughto encompass the allocation of scarce disposal space for radioactive waste. See, e. g., Colorado v. New Mexico, 459 U. S.176 (1982);

Arizona v. California, 373 U. S. 546 (1963). TheUnited States suggests that if the Court may resolve such

interstate disputes, Congress can surely do the same underthe Commerce Clause. The regional compacts support this
argument with a series of quotations from The Federalistand other contemporaneous documents, which the compacts
contend demonstrate that the Framers established a strongNational Legislature for the purpose of resolving trade disputes among the States. Brief for Rocky Mountain Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact et al. as

Amici Curiae 17,and n. 16.

While the Framers no doubt endowed Congress with thepower to regulate interstate commerce in order to avoid further instances of the interstate trade disputes that werecommon under the Articles of Confederation, the Framers
did not intend that Congress should exercise that powerthrough the mechanism of mandating state regulation. The
Constitution established Congress as "a superintending au-thority over the reciprocal trade" among the States, The
Federalist No. 42, p. 268 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961), by empower-ing Congress to regulate that trade directly, not by authorizing Congress to issue trade-related orders to state govern-ments. As Madison and Hamilton explained, "a sovereignty
over sovereigns, a government over governments, a legisla-tion for communities, as contradistinguished from individuals, as it is a solecism in theory, so in practice it is subversiveof the order and ends of civil polity." Id., No. 20, at 138.

observe that public officials representing the State of New
York lent their support to the Act's enactment. A Deputy
Commissioner of the State's Energy Office testified in favor
of the Act. See Low-Level Waste Legislation: Hearings on
H. R. 862, H. R. 1046, H. R. 1083, and H. R. 1267 before the
Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment of the House
Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, 99th Cong., 1st
Sess., 97-98, 190-199 (1985) (testimony of Charles Guinn).
Senator Moynihan of New York spoke in support of the Act
on the floor of the Senate. 131 Cong. Rec. 38423 (1985).
Respondents note that the Act embodies a bargain among
the sited and unsited States, a compromise to which New
York was a willing participant and from which New York
has reaped much benefit. Respondents then pose what appears at first to be a troubling question: How can a federal
statute be found an unconstitutional infringement of state
sovereignty when state officials consented to the statute's
enactment?

The answer follows from an understanding of the fundamental purpose served by our Government's federal structure. The Constitution does not protect the sovereignty of
States for the benefit of the States or state governments as
abstract political entities, or even for the benefit of the public
officials governing the States. To the contrary, the Constitution divides authority between federal and state governments for the protection of individuals. State sovereignty
is not just an end in itself: "Rather, federalism secures to
citizens the liberties that derive from the diffusion of sovereign power." Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 759
(1991) (Blackmun, J., dissenting). "Just as the separation
and independence of the coordinate branches of the Federal
Government serve to prevent the accumulation of excessive
power in any one branch, a healthy balance of power between
the States and the Federal Government will reduce the risk
of tyranny and abuse from either front." Gregory v. Ash505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
croft, 501 U. S., at 458. See The Federalist No. 51, p. 323(C. Rossiter ed. 1961).

Where Congress exceeds its authority relative to theStates, therefore, the departure from the constitutional plan
cannot be ratified by the "consent" of state officials. An
analogy to the separation of powers among the branches ofthe Federal Government clarifies this point. The Constitution's division of power among the three branches is violatedwhere one branch invades the territory of another, whether
or not the encroached-upon branch approves the encroach-ment. In

Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 118-137 (1976), for
instance, the Court held that Congress had infringed the
President's appointment power, despite the fact that the
President himself had manifested his consent to the statute
that caused the infringement by signing it into law. See National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S., at 842, n. 12. In
INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 944-959 (1983), we held that
the legislative veto violated the constitutional requirement
that legislation be presented to the President, despite Presidents' approval of hundreds of statutes containing a legislative veto provision. See id., at 944-945. The constitutional
authority of Congress cannot be expanded by the "consent"
of the governmental unit whose domain is thereby narrowed,
whether that unit is the Executive Branch or the States.

State officials thus cannot consent to the enlargement of
the powers of Congress beyond those enumerated in the
Constitution. Indeed, the facts of these cases raise the possibility that powerful incentives might lead both federal and
state officials to view departures from the federal structure
to be in their personal interests. Most citizens recognize
the need for radioactive waste disposal sites, but few want
sites near their homes. As a result, while it would be well
within the authority of either federal or state officials to
choose where the disposal sites will be, it is likely to be in
the political interest of each individual official to avoid being
held accountable to the voters for the choice of location. If

505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT

183Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
a federal official is faced with the alternatives of choosing alocation or directing the States to do it, the official may well

prefer the latter, as a means of shifting responsibility for theeventual decision. If a state official is faced with the same
set of alternatives--choosing a location or having Congressdirect the choice of a location--the state official may also
prefer the latter, as it may permit the avoidance of personalresponsibility. The interests of public officials thus may not
coincide with the Constitution's intergovernmental allocationof authority. Where state officials purport to submit to the
direction of Congress in this manner, federalism is hardlybeing advanced.

Nor does the State's prior support for the Act estop it fromasserting the Act's unconstitutionality. While New York
has received the benefit of the Act in the form of a few moreyears of access to disposal sites in other States, New York
has never joined a regional radioactive waste compact. Anyestoppel implications that might flow from membership in a
compact, see West Virginia ex rel. Dyer v. Sims, 341 U. S.22, 35-36 (1951) (Jackson, J., concurring), thus do not concern
us here. The fact that the Act, like much federal legislation,embodies a compromise among the States does not elevate
the Act (or the antecedent discussions among representa-tives of the States) to the status of an interstate agreement
requiring Congress' approval under the Compact Clause.Cf.

Holmes v. Jennison, 14 Pet. 540, 572 (1840) (pluralityopinion). That a party collaborated with others in seeking

legislation has never been understood to estop the partyfrom challenging that legislation in subsequent litigation.

Petitioners also contend that the Act is inconsistent withthe Constitution's Guarantee Clause, which directs the

United States to "guarantee to every State in this Union aRepublican Form of Government." U. S. Const., Art. IV, $ 4.
Because we have found the take title provision of the Act

505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT
184 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
irreconcilable with the powers delegated to Congress by theConstitution and hence with the Tenth Amendment's reservation to the States of those powers not delegated to theFederal Government, we need only address the applicability
of the Guarantee Clause to the Act's other two challenged
provisions.We approach the issue with some trepidation, because the

Guarantee Clause has been an infrequent basis for litigationthroughout our history. In most of the cases in which the
Court has been asked to apply the Clause, the Court hasfound the claims presented to be nonjusticiable under the
"political question" doctrine. See, e. g., City of Rome v.
United States, 446 U. S. 156, 182, n. 17 (1980) (challenge to
the preclearance requirements of the Voting Rights Act);
Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 218-229 (1962) (challenge to
apportionment of state legislative districts); Pacific States
Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Oregon, 223 U. S. 118, 140-151
(1912) (challenge to initiative and referendum provisions of
state constitution).

The view that the Guarantee Clause implicates only nonjusticiable political questions has its origin in Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1 (1849), in which the Court was asked to decide,
in the wake of Dorr's Rebellion, which of two rival governments was the legitimate government of Rhode Island. The
Court held that "it rests with Congress," not the judiciary,
"to decide what government is the established one in a
State." Id., at 42. Over the following century, this limited
holding metamorphosed into the sweeping assertion that
"[v]iolation of the great guaranty of a republican form of government in States cannot be challenged in the courts." Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549, 556 (1946) (plurality opinion).

This view has not always been accepted. In a group of
cases decided before the holding of Luther was elevated into
a general rule of nonjusticiability, the Court addressed the
merits of claims founded on the Guarantee Clause without
any suggestion that the claims were not justiciable. See At505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT

of government").More recently, the Court has suggested that perhaps not
all claims under the Guarantee Clause present nonjusticiablepolitical questions. See

Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 582
(1964) ("[S]ome questions raised under the Guarantee Clause
are nonjusticiable"). Contemporary commentators have likewise suggested that courts should address the merits of such
claims, at least in some circumstances. See, e. g., L. Tribe,
American Constitutional Law 398 (2d ed. 1988); J. Ely,
Democracy and Distrust: A Theory of Judicial Review 118,
n., and 122-123 (1980); W. Wiecek, The Guarantee Clause of

IV, Section 4: A Study in Constitutional Desuetude, 46 Minn.
L. Rev. 513, 560-565 (1962).

We need not resolve this difficult question today. Even if
we assume that petitioners' claim is justiciable, neither the
monetary incentives provided by the Act nor the possibility
that a State's waste producers may find themselves excluded
from the disposal sites of another State can reasonably be
said to deny any State a republican form of government. As
we have seen, these two incentives represent permissible
conditional exercises of Congress' authority under the
Spending and Commerce Clauses respectively, in forms that
have now grown commonplace. Under each, Congress offers the States a legitimate choice rather than issuing an
unavoidable command. The States thereby retain the ability to set their legislative agendas; state government officials
remain accountable to the local electorate. The twin threats

186 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
imposed by the first two challenged provisions of the Act--that New York may miss out on a share of federal spending or

that those generating radioactive waste within New York maylose out-of-state disposal outlets--do not pose any realistic
risk of altering the form or the method of functioning ofNew York's government. Thus even indulging the assumption that the Guarantee Clause provides a basis upon whicha State or its subdivisions may sue to enjoin the enforcement
of a federal statute, petitioners have not made out such aclaim in these cases.

VI
Having determined that the take title provision exceedsthe powers of Congress, we must consider whether it is severable from the rest of the Act."The standard for determining the severability of an unconstitutional provision is well established: Unless it is evi-dent that the Legislature would not have enacted those provisions which are within its power, independently of thatwhich is not, the invalid part may be dropped if what is left
is fully operative as a law." Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock,480 U. S. 678, 684 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted).
While the Act itself contains no statement of whether itsprovisions are severable, "[i]n the absence of a severability
clause, . . . Congress' silence is just that--silence--and doesnot raise a presumption against severability." Id., at 686.
Common sense suggests that where Congress has enacted astatutory scheme for an obvious purpose, and where Congress has included a series of provisions operating as incen-tives to achieve that purpose, the invalidation of one of the
incentives should not ordinarily cause Congress' overall in-tent to be frustrated. As the Court has observed, "it is not
to be presumed that the legislature was legislating for themere sake of imposing penalties, but the penalties . . . were
simply in aid of the main purpose of the statute. They mayfail, and still the great body of the statute have operative
force, and the force contemplated by the legislature in its

enactment." Reagan v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 154
U. S. 362, 396 (1894). See also United States v. Jackson, 390
U. S. 570, 585-586 (1968).

It is apparent in light of these principles that the take title
provision may be severed without doing violence to the rest
of the Act. The Act is still operative and it still serves Congress' objective of encouraging the States to attain local or
regional self-sufficiency in the disposal of low level radioactive waste. It still includes two incentives that coax the
States along this road. A State whose radioactive waste
generators are unable to gain access to disposal sites in other
States may encounter considerable internal pressure to provide for the disposal of waste, even without the prospect of
taking title. The sited regional compacts need not accept
New York's waste after the 7-year transition period expires,
so any burden caused by New York's failure to secure a disposal site will not be borne by the residents of other States.
The purpose of the Act is not defeated by the invalidation of
the take title provision, so we may leave the remainder of
the Act in force.

VII

Some truths are so basic that, like the air around us, they
are easily overlooked. Much of the Constitution is concerned with setting forth the form of our government, and
the courts have traditionally invalidated measures deviating
from that form. The result may appear "formalistic" in a
given case to partisans of the measure at issue, because such
measures are typically the product of the era's perceived necessity. But the Constitution protects us from our own best
intentions: It divides power among sovereigns and among
branches of government precisely so that we may resist the
temptation to concentrate power in one location as an expedient solution to the crisis of the day. The shortage of
disposal sites for radioactive waste is a pressing national
problem, but a judiciary that licensed extraconstitutional

Opinion of White, J.
government with each issue of comparable gravity would, inthe long run, be far worse.

States are not mere political subdivisions of the UnitedStates. State governments are neither regional offices nor
administrative agencies of the Federal Government. The
positions occupied by state officials appear nowhere on theFederal Government's most detailed organizational chart.

The Constitution instead "leaves to the several States a re-siduary and inviolable sovereignty," The Federalist No. 39,
p. 245 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961), reserved explicitly to the Statesby the Tenth Amendment.

Whatever the outer limits of that sovereignty may be, onething is clear: The Federal Government may not compel the
States to enact or administer a federal regulatory program.
The Constitution permits both the Federal Government and
the States to enact legislation regarding the disposal of low
level radioactive waste. The Constitution enables the Federal Government to pre-empt state regulation contrary to
federal interests, and it permits the Federal Government to
hold out incentives to the States as a means of encouraging
them to adopt suggested regulatory schemes. It does not,
however, authorize Congress simply to direct the States to
provide for the disposal of the radioactive waste generated
within their borders. While there may be many constitutional methods of achieving regional self-sufficiency in radioactive waste disposal, the method Congress has chosen is
not one of them. The judgment of the Court of Appeals
is accordingly

Affirmed in part and reversed in part.

centives from surcharges collected by States with low-levelradioactive waste storage sites and rebated by the Secretary of Energy to States in compliance with the 1985 Act'sdeadlines for achieving regional or in-state disposal, see

$$ 2021e(d)(2)(A) and 2021e(d)(2)(B)(iv), and the "access in-centives," which deny access to disposal sites for States that
fail to meet certain deadlines for low-level radioactive wastedisposal management, $ 2021e(e)(2). The Court strikes
down and severs a third component of the 1985 Act, the "taketitle" provision, which requires a noncomplying State to take
title to or to assume liability for its low-level radioactivewaste if it fails to provide for the disposal of such waste
by January 1, 1996. $ 2021e(d)(2)(C). The Court deems thislast provision unconstitutional under principles of federalism. Because I believe the Court has mischaracterized theessential inquiry, misanalyzed the inquiry it has chosen to
undertake, and undervalued the effect the seriousness of thispublic policy problem should have on the constitutionality of
the take title provision, I can only join Parts III-A andIII-B, and I respectfully dissent from the rest of its opinion
and the judgment reversing in part the judgment of theCourt of Appeals.

I
My disagreement with the Court's analysis begins at thebasic descriptive level of how the legislation at issue in these

cases came to be enacted. The Court goes some way towardsetting out the bare facts, but its omissions cast the statutory
context of the take title provision in the wrong light. Toread the Court's version of events, see ante, at 150-151, one
would think that Congress was the sole proponent of a solu-tion to the Nation's low-level radioactive waste problem.
Not so. The Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of1980 (1980 Act), Pub. L. 96-573, 94 Stat. 3347, and its amendatory 1985 Act, resulted from the efforts of state leaders toachieve a state-based set of remedies to the waste problem.
They sought not federal pre-emption or intervention, but

rather congressional sanction of interstate compromises theyhad reached.

The two signal events in 1979 that precipitated move-ment toward legislation were the temporary closing of the
Nevada disposal site in July 1979, after several serious
transportation-related incidents, and the temporary shuttingof the Washington disposal site because of similar transportation and packaging problems in October 1979. At thattime the facility in Barnwell, South Carolina, received approximately three-quarters of the Nation's low-level radioac-tive waste, and the Governor ordered a 50 percent reduction
in the amount his State's plant would accept for disposal.
National Governors' Association Task Force on Low-Level
Radioactive Waste Disposal, Low-Level Waste: A Program
for Action 3 (Nov. 1980) (lodged with the Clerk of this Court)
(hereinaf ter A Program for Action). The Governor of
Washington threatened to shut down the Hanford, Washington, facility entirely by 1982 unless "some meaningful progress occurs toward" development of regional solutions to the
waste disposal problem. Id., at 4, n. Only three sites existed in the country for the disposal of low-level radioactive
waste, and the "sited" States confronted the undesirable alternatives either of continuing to be the dumping grounds
for the entire Nation's low-level waste or of eliminating or
reducing in a constitutional manner the amount of waste
accepted for disposal.

The imminence of a crisis in low-level radioactive waste
management cannot be overstated. In December 1979, the
National Governors' Association convened an eight-member
task force to coordinate policy proposals on behalf of the
States. See Status of Interstate Compacts for the Disposal
of Low-Level Radioactive Waste: Hearing before the Senate
Committee on the Judiciary, 98th Cong., 1st Sess., 8 (1983).
In May 1980, the State Planning Council on Radioactive
Waste Management submitted the following unanimous recommendation to President Carter:

191Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)
Opinion of White, J.
"The national policy of the United States on low-levelradioactive waste shall be that every State is responsible for the disposal of the low-level radioactive wastegenerated by nondefense related activities within its
boundaries and that States are authorized to enter into
interstate compacts, as necessary, for the purpose ofcarrying out this responsibility." 126 Cong. Rec. 20135

(1980).
This recommendation was adopted by the National Gover-nors' Association a few months later. See A Program for

Action 6-7; H. R. Rep. No. 99-314, pt. 2, p. 18 (1985). TheGovernors recognized that the Federal Government could assert its preeminence in achieving a solution to this problem,
but requested instead that Congress oversee state-developedregional solutions. Accordingly, the Governors' Task Force

urged that "each state should accept primary responsibilityfor the safe disposal of low-level radioactive waste generated
within its borders" and that "the states should pursue a re-gional approach to the low-level waste disposal problem."
A Program for Action 6.The Governors went further, however, in recommending
that "Congress should authorize the states to enter into interstate compacts to establish regional disposal sites" andthat "[s]uch authorization should include the power to exclude waste generated outside the region from the regionaldisposal site."

Id., at 7. The Governors had an obvious incentive in urging Congress not to add more coercive meas-ures to the legislation should the States fail to comply, but

they nevertheless anticipated that Congress might eventually have to take stronger steps to ensure compliance with
long-range planning deadlines for low-level radioactive waste
management. Accordingly, the Governors' Task Force

"recommend[ed] that Congress defer consideration of
sanctions to compel the establishment of new disposal
sites until at least two years after the enactment of com505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT

pact consent legislation. States are already confrontingthe diminishing capacity of present sites and an unequivocal political warning from those states' Governors. Ifat the end of the two-year period states have not responded effectively, or if problems still exist, strongerfederal action may be necessary. But until that time,
Congress should confine its role to removing obstaclesand allow the states a reasonable chance to solve the
problem themselves." Id., at 8-9.
Such concerns would have been mooted had Congress en-acted a "federal" solution, which the Senate considered in

July 1980. See S. 2189, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. (1980); S. Rep.No. 96-548 (1980) (detailing legislation calling for federal
study, oversight, and management of radioactive waste).This "federal" solution, however, was opposed by one of the
sited State's Senators, who introduced an amendment toadopt and implement the recommendations of the State Planning Council on Radioactive Waste Management. See 126Cong. Rec. 20136 (1980) (statement of Sen. Thurmond). The
"state-based" solution carried the day, and as enacted, the1980 Act announced the "policy of the Federal Government
that . . . each State is responsible for providing for the avail-ability of capacity either within or outside the State for the
disposal of low-level radioactive waste generated within itsborders." Pub. L. 96-573, $ 4(a)(1), 94 Stat. 3348. The 1980
Act further authorized States to "enter into such compactsas may be necessary to provide for the establishment and
operation of regional disposal facilities for low-level radioac-tive waste," $ 4(a)(2)(A), compacts to which Congress would
have to give its consent. $ 4(a)(2)(B). The 1980 Act alsoprovided that, beginning on January 1, 1986, an approved
compact could reserve access to its disposal facilities forthose States which had joined that particular regional compact. Ibid.As well described by one of the

proval sparked a new round of political squabbling between
elected officials from unsited States, who generally opposed
ratification of the compacts that were being formed, and
their counterparts from the sited States, who insisted that
the promises made in the 1980 Act be honored. See Brief
for American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial
Organizations as Amicus Curiae 12-14. In its effort to
keep the States at the forefront of the policy amendment
process, the National Governors' Association organized more
than a dozen meetings to achieve a state consensus. See H.
Brown, The Low-Level Waste Handbook: A User's Guide to
the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act
of 1985, p. iv (Nov. 1986) (describing "the states' desire to
influence any revisions of the 1980 Act").

These discussions were not merely academic. The sited
States grew increasingly and justifiably frustrated by the
seeming inaction of unsited States in meeting the projected
actions called for in the 1980 Act. Thus, as the end of 1985
approached, the sited States viewed the January 1, 1986,
deadline established in the 1980 Act as a "drop-dead" date,
on which the regional compacts could begin excluding the
entry of out-of-region waste. See 131 Cong. Rec. 35203
(1985). Since by this time the three disposal facilities operating in 1980 were still the only such plants accepting lowlevel radioactive waste, the unsited States perceived a very
serious danger if the three existing facilities actually carried
out their threat to restrict access to the waste generated
solely within their respective compact regions.

A movement thus arose to achieve a compromise between
the sited and the unsited States, in which the sited States
agreed to continue accepting waste in exchange for the imposition of stronger measures to guarantee compliance with
the unsited States' assurances that they would develop alternative disposal facilities. As Representative Derrick
explained, the compromise 1985 legislation "gives nonsited

States more time to develop disposal sites, but also estab-lishes a very firm timetable and sanctions for failure to live

up [to] the agreement." Id., at 35207. Representative Mar-key added that "[t]his compromise became the basis for our
amendments to the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Actof 1980. In the process of drafting such amendments, various concessions have been made by all sides in an effort toarrive at a bill which all parties could accept."

Id., at 35205.The bill that in large measure became the 1985 Act "represent[ed] the diligent negotiating undertaken by" the Na-tional Governors' Association and "embodied" the "fundamentals of their settlement." Id., at 35204 (statement ofRep. Udall). In sum, the 1985 Act was very much the product of cooperative federalism, in which the States bargainedamong themselves to achieve compromises for Congress to
sanction.There is no need to resummarize the essentials of the 1985
legislation, which the Court does ante, at 151-154. It does,however, seem critical to emphasize what is accurately described in one amicus brief as the assumption by Congressof "the role of arbiter of disputes among the several States."
Brief for Rocky Mountain Low-Level Radioactive WasteCompact et al. as Amici Curiae 9. Unlike legislation that
directs action from the Federal Government to the States,the 1980 and 1985 Acts reflected hard-fought agreements
among States as refereed by Congress. The distinction is
key, and the Court's failure properly to characterize this leg-islation ultimately affects its analysis of the take title provision's constitutionality. II

To justify its holding that the take title provision contra-venes the Constitution, the Court posits that "[i]n this provision, Congress has crossed the line distinguishing encourage-ment from coercion."

interstate bargaining process, the Court isolates the measure
analytically and proceeds to dissect it in a syllogistic fashion.
The Court candidly begins with an argument respondents do
not make: that "the Constitution would not permit Congress
simply to transfer radioactive waste from generators to state
governments." Ibid. "Such a forced transfer," it continues, "standing alone, would in principle be no different than
a congressionally compelled subsidy from state governments
to radioactive waste producers." Ibid. Since this is not an
argument respondents make, one naturally wonders why the
Court builds its analysis that the take title provision is unconstitutional around this opening premise. But having
carefully built its straw man, the Court proceeds impressively to knock him down. "As we have seen," the Court
teaches, "the Constitution does not empower Congress to
subject state governments to this type of instruction."
Ante, at 176.

Curiously absent from the Court's analysis is any effort to
place the take title provision within the overall context of
the legislation. As the discussion in Part I of this opinion
suggests, the 1980 and 1985 statutes were enacted against a
backdrop of national concern over the availability of additional low-level radioactive waste disposal facilities. Congress could have pre-empted the field by directly regulating
the disposal of this waste pursuant to its powers under the
Commerce and Spending Clauses, but instead it unanimously assented to the States' request for congressional ratification of agreements to which they had acceded. See 131
Cong. Rec. 35252 (1985); id., at 38425. As the floor statements of Members of Congress reveal, see supra, at 193-194,
the States wished to take the lead in achieving a solution to
this problem and agreed among themselves to the various
incentives and penalties implemented by Congress to ensure

adherence to the various deadlines and goals.1 The chiefexecutives of the States proposed this approach, and I am

unmoved by the Court's vehemence in taking away Con-gress' authority to sanction a recalcitrant unsited State now
that New York has reaped the benefits of the sited States'concessions.

A
In my view, New York's actions subsequent to enactmentof the 1980 and 1985 Acts fairly indicate its approval of the

interstate agreement process embodied in those laws withinthe meaning of Art. I, $ 10, cl. 3, of the Constitution, which
provides that "[n]o State shall, without the Consent ofCongress, . . . enter into any Agreement or Compact with
another State." First, the States--including New York--worked through their Governors to petition Congress for the
1980 and 1985 Acts. As I have attempted to demonstrate,these statutes are best understood as the products of collective state action, rather than as impositions placed on Statesby the Federal Government. Second, New York acted in
compliance with the requisites of both statutes in key re-spects, thus signifying its assent to the agreement achieved
among the States as codified in these laws. After enact-ment of the 1980 Act and pursuant to its provision in $ 4(a)(2),
94 Stat. 3348, New York entered into compact negotiationswith several other northeastern States before withdrawing
from them to "go it alone." Indeed, in 1985, as the January1, 1986, deadline crisis approached and Congress considered
the 1985 legislation that is the subject of this lawsuit, theDeputy Commissioner for Policy and Planning of the New

staffs and principals have produced a[n] agreement that does have some
real teeth in it at some points." 131 Cong. Rec. 38415 (1985).

York State Energy Office testified before Congress that"New York State supports the efforts of Mr. Udall and the

members of this Subcommittee to resolve the current im-passe over Congressional consent to the proposed LLRW
compacts and provide interim access for states and regions
without sites. New York State has been participating with
the National Governors' Association and the other large
states and compact commissions in an effort to further
refine the recommended approach in HR 1083 and reach a
consensus between all groups." See Low-Level Waste Leg-islation: Hearings on H. R. 862, H. R. 1046, H. R. 1083, and

H. R. 1267 before the Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment of the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, 99th Cong., 1st Sess., 197 (1985) (testimony of
Charles Guinn) (emphasis added).

Based on the assumption that "other states will [not] continue indefinitely to provide access to facilities adequate for
the permanent disposal of low-level radioactive waste generated in New York," 1986 N. Y. Laws, ch. 673, $ 2, the state
legislature enacted a law providing for a waste disposal facility to be sited in the State. Ibid. This measure comported
with the 1985 Act's proviso that States which did not join
a regional compact by July 1, 1986, would have to establish
an in-state waste disposal facility. See 42 U. S. C. $ 2021e
(e)(1)(A). New York also complied with another provision
of the 1985 Act, $ 2021e(e)(1)(B), which provided that by January 1, 1988, each compact or independent State would identify a facility location and develop a siting plan, or contract
with a sited compact for access to that region's facility. By
1988, New York had identified five potential sites in Cortland
and Allegany Counties, but public opposition there caused
the State to reconsider where to locate its waste disposal
facility. See Office of Environmental Restoration and Waste

198 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of White, J.
(1991) (lodged with the Clerk of this Court). As it was un-dertaking these initial steps to honor the interstate compromise embodied in the 1985 Act, New York continued to takefull advantage of the import concession made by the sited
States, by exporting its low-level radioactive waste for the
full 7-year extension period provided in the 1985 Act. Bygaining these benefits and complying with certain of the 1985

Act's deadlines, therefore, New York fairly evidenced itsacceptance of the federal-state arrangement--including the
take title provision.Although unlike the 42 States that compose the nine existing and approved regional compacts, see Brief for United
States 10, n. 19, New York has never formalized its assent
to the 1980 and 1985 statutes, our cases support the view
that New York's actions signify assent to a constitutional
interstate "agreement" for purposes of Art. I, $ 10, cl. 3. In
Holmes v. Jennison, 14 Pet. 540 (1840), Chief Justice Taney
stated that "[t]he word `agreement,' does not necessarily import any direct and express stipulation; nor is it necessary
that it should be in writing. If there is a verbal understanding to which both parties have assented, and upon which
both are acting, it is an `agreement.' And the use of all of
these terms, `treaty,' `agreement,' `compact,' show that it
was the intention of the framers of the Constitution to use
the broadest and most comprehensive terms; . . . and we shall
fail to execute that evident intention, unless we give to the
word `agreement' its most extended signification; and so
apply it as to prohibit every agreement, written or verbal,
formal or informal, positive or implied, by the mutual understanding of the parties." Id., at 572. (emphasis added). In
my view, New York acted in a manner to signify its assent
to the 1985 Act's take title provision as part of the elaborate
compromise reached among the States.

The State should be estopped from asserting the unconstitutionality of a provision that seeks merely to ensure that,
after deriving substantial advantages from the 1985 Act,

199Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)
Opinion of White, J.
New York in fact must live up to its bargain by establishing
an in-state low-level radioactive waste facility or assuming
liability for its failure to act. Cf. West Virginia ex rel. Dyer
v. Sims, 341 U. S. 22, 35-36 (1951), Jackson, J., concurring:
"West Virginia officials induced sister States to contract with
her and Congress to consent to the Compact. She now attempts to read herself out of this interstate Compact . . . .
Estoppel is not often to be invoked against a government.
But West Virginia assumed a contractual obligation with
equals by permission of another government that is sovereign in the field. After Congress and sister States had been
induced to alter their positions and bind themselves to
terms of a covenant, West Virginia should be estopped from
repudiating her act." (Emphasis added.)

B
Even were New York not to be estopped from challenging
the take title provision's constitutionality, I am convinced
that, seen as a term of an agreement entered into between
the several States, this measure proves to be less constitutionally odious than the Court opines. First, the practical
effect of New York's position is that because it is unwilling
to honor its obligations to provide in-state storage facilities
for its low-level radioactive waste, other States with such
plants must accept New York's waste, whether they wish
to or not. Otherwise, the many economically and socially
beneficial producers of such waste in the State would have
to cease their operations. The Court's refusal to force New
York to accept responsibility for its own problem inevitably
means that some other State's sovereignty will be impinged
by it being forced, for public health reasons, to accept New
York's low-level radioactive waste. I do not understand the
principle of federalism to impede the National Government
from acting as referee among the States to prohibit one from
bullying another.

200 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of White, J.
Moreover, it is utterly reasonable that, in crafting a delicate compromise between the three overburdened States
that provided low-level radioactive waste disposal facilities
and the rest of the States, Congress would have to ratify
some punitive measure as the ultimate sanction for noncompliance. The take title provision, though surely onerous,
does not take effect if the generator of the waste does not
request such action, or if the State lives up to its bargain of
providing a waste disposal facility either within the State or
in another State pursuant to a regional compact arrangement or a separate contract. See 42 U. S. C. $ 2021e(d)(2)(C).

Finally, to say, as the Court does, that the incursion on
state sovereignty "cannot be ratified by the `consent' of state
officials," ante, at 182, is flatly wrong. In a case involving a
congressional ratification statute to an interstate compact,
the Court upheld a provision that Tennessee and Missouri
had waived their immunity from suit. Over their objection,
the Court held that "[t]he States who are parties to the
compact by accepting it and acting under it assume the
conditions that Congress under the Constitution attached."
Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm'n, 359 U. S. 275,
281-282 (1959) (emphasis added). In so holding, the Court
determined that a State may be found to have waived a fundamental aspect of its sovereignty--the right to be immune
from suit--in the formation of an interstate compact even
when in subsequent litigation it expressly denied its waiver.
I fail to understand the reasoning behind the Court's selective distinctions among the various aspects of sovereignty
that may and may not be waived and do not believe these
distinctions will survive close analysis in future cases. Hard
public policy choices sometimes require strong measures, and
the Court's holding, while not irremediable, essentially misunderstands that the 1985 take title provision was part of a
complex interstate agreement about which New York should
not now be permitted to complain.

The Court announces that it has no occasion to revisit suchdecisions as

Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452 (1991); SouthCarolina v. Baker, 485 U. S. 505 (1988); Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985);EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226 (1983); and National
League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833 (1976); see ante, at160, because "this is not a case in which Congress has subjected a State to the same legislation applicable to privateparties."

Ibid. Although this statement sends the wel-come signal that the Court does not intend to cut a wide

swath through our recent Tenth Amendment precedents,it nevertheless is unpersuasive. I have several difficulties
with the Court's analysis in this respect: It builds its rulearound an insupportable and illogical distinction in the types
of alleged incursions on state sovereignty; it derives its rulefrom cases that do not support its analysis; it fails to apply
the appropriate tests from the cases on which it purports tobase its rule; and it omits any discussion of the most recent
and pertinent test for determining the take title provision'sconstitutionality.

The Court's distinction between a federal statute's regula-tion of States and private parties for general purposes, as
opposed to a regulation solely on the activities of States, isunsupported by our recent Tenth Amendment cases. In no
case has the Court rested its holding on such a distinction.Moreover, the Court makes no effort to explain why this purported distinction should affect the analysis of Congress'power under general principles of federalism and the Tenth
Amendment. The distinction, facilely thrown out, is notbased on any defensible theory. Certainly one would be
hard pressed to read the spirited exchanges between theCourt and dissenting Justices in

National League of Cities,supra, and in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit

Authority, supra, as having been based on the distinctionnow drawn by the Court. An incursion on state sovereignty

Opinion of White, J.
hardly seems more constitutionally acceptable if the federal
statute that "commands" specific action also applies to private parties. The alleged diminution in state authority over
its own affairs is not any less because the federal mandate
restricts the activities of private parties.

Even were such a distinction to be logically sound, the
Court's "anticommandeering" principle cannot persuasively
be read as springing from the two cases cited for the proposition, Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation
Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 288 (1981), and FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 761-762 (1982). The Court purports to
draw support for its rule against Congress "commandeer[ing]" state legislative processes from a solitary statement
in dictum in Hodel. See ante, at 161: "As an initial matter,
Congress may not simply `commandee[r] the legislative processes of the States by directly compelling them to enact

and enforce a federal regulatory program' " (quoting Hodel,
supra, at 288). That statement was not necessary to the
decision in Hodel, which involved the question whether the
Tenth Amendment interfered with Congress' authority to
pre-empt a field of activity that could also be subject to state
regulation and not whether a federal statute could dictate
certain actions by States; the language about "commandeer[ing]" States was classic dicta. In holding that a federal
statute regulating the activities of private coal mine operators was constitutional, the Court observed that "[i]t would
. . . be a radical departure from long-established precedent
for this Court to hold that the Tenth Amendment prohibits
Congress from displacing state police power laws regulating
private activity." 452 U. S., at 292.

The Court also claims support for its rule from our decision in FERC, and quotes a passage from that case in which
we stated that " `this Court never has sanctioned explicitly
a federal command to the States to promulgate and enforce
laws and regulations.' " Ante, at 161 (quoting 456 U. S., at

505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of White, J.
761-762). In so reciting, the Court extracts from the rele-vant passage in a manner that subtly alters the Court's

meaning. In full, the passage reads: "While this Courtnever has sanctioned explicitly a federal command to the
States to promulgate and enforce laws and regulations, cf.
EPA v. Brown, 431 U. S. 99 (1977), there are instances wherethe Court has upheld federal statutory structures that in

effect directed state decisionmakers to take or to refrainfrom taking certain actions." Ibid. (citing Fry v. United
States, 421 U. S. 542 (1975) (emphasis added)).2 The phrasehighlighted by the Court merely means that we have not had

the occasion to address whether Congress may "command"the States to enact a certain law, and as I have argued in
Parts I and II of this opinion, these cases do not raise thatissue. Moreover, it should go without saying that the absence of any on-point precedent from this Court has no bear-ing on the question whether Congress has properly exercised
its constitutional authority under Article I. Silence by thisCourt on a subject is not authority for anything.

The Court can scarcely rest on a distinction between fed-eral laws of general applicability and those ostensibly directed solely at the activities of States, therefore, when thedecisions from which it derives the rule not only made no
such distinction, but validated federal statutes that con-stricted state sovereignty in ways greater than or similar to

2 It is true that under the majority's approach, Fry is distinguishable
because it involved a statute generally applicable to both state governments and private parties. The law at issue in that case was the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, which imposed wage and salary limitations
on private and state workers alike. In Fry, the Court upheld this statute's application to the States over a Tenth Amendment challenge. In my
view, Fry perfectly captures the weakness of the majority's distinction,
because the law upheld in that case involved a far more pervasive intrusion on state sovereignty--the authority of state governments to pay salaries and wages to its employees below the federal minimum--than the
take title provision at issue here.

Opinion of White, J.
the take title provision at issue in these cases. As Fry,
Hodel, and FERC make clear, our precedents prior to Garcia
upheld provisions in federal statutes that directed States to
undertake certain actions. "[I]t cannot be constitutionally
determinative that the federal regulation is likely to move
the States to act in a given way," we stated in FERC, "or
even to `coerc[e] the States' into assuming a regulatory role
by affecting their `freedom to make decisions in areas of "integral governmental functions." ' " 456 U. S., at 766. I thus
am unconvinced that either Hodel or FERC supports the
rule announced by the Court.

And if those cases do stand for the proposition that in certain circumstances Congress may not dictate that the States
take specific actions, it would seem appropriate to apply the
test stated in FERC for determining those circumstances.
The crucial threshold inquiry in that case was whether the
subject matter was pre-emptible by Congress. See 456
U. S., at 765. "If Congress can require a state administrative body to consider proposed regulations as a condition to
its continued involvement in a pre-emptible field--and we
hold today that it can--there is nothing unconstitutional
about Congress' requiring certain procedural minima as that
body goes about undertaking its tasks." Id., at 771 (emphasis added). The FERC Court went on to explain that if
Congress is legislating in a pre-emptible field--as the Court
concedes it was doing here, see ante, at 173-174--the proper
test before our decision in Garcia was to assess whether the
alleged intrusions on state sovereignty "do not threaten the
States' `separate and independent existence,' Lane County
v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 76 (1869); Coyle v. Smith, 221 U. S. 559,
580 (1911), and do not impair the ability of the States `to
function effectively in a federal system.' Fry v. United
States, 421 U. S., at 547, n. 7; National League of Cities v.
Usery, 426 U. S., at 852." FERC, supra, at 765-766. On

Opinion of White, J.
neither score does the take title provision raise constitutional
problems. It certainly does not threaten New York's independent existence nor impair its ability to function effectively in the system, all the more so since the provision was
enacted pursuant to compromises reached among state leaders and then ratified by Congress.

It is clear, therefore, that even under the precedents selectively chosen by the Court, its analysis of the take title provision's constitutionality in these cases falls far short of being
persuasive. I would also submit, in this connection, that the
Court's attempt to carve out a doctrinal distinction for statutes that purport solely to regulate state activities is especially unpersuasive after Garcia. It is true that in that case
we considered whether a federal statute of general applicability--the Fair Labor Standards Act--applied to state
transportation entities but our most recent statements have
explained the appropriate analysis in a more general manner.
Just last Term, for instance, Justice O'Connor wrote for
the Court that "[w]e are constrained in our ability to consider
the limits that the state-federal balance places on Congress'
powers under the Commerce Clause. See Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985)
(declining to review limitations placed on Congress' Commerce Clause powers by our federal system)." Gregory v.
Ashcroft, 501 U. S., at 464. Indeed, her opinion went on to
state that "this Court in Garcia has left primarily to the
political process the protection of the States against intrusive exercises of Congress' Commerce Clause powers."
Ibid. (emphasis added).

Rather than seek guidance from FERC and Hodel, therefore, the more appropriate analysis should flow from Garcia,
even if these cases do not involve a congressional law generally applicable to both States and private parties. In Garcia, we stated the proper inquiry: "[W]e are convinced that

Opinion of White, J.
the fundamental limitation that the constitutional scheme
imposes on the Commerce Clause to protect the `States as
States' is one of process rather than one of result. Any substantive restraint on the exercise of Commerce Clause powers must find its justification in the procedural nature of this
basic limitation, and it must be tailored to compensate for
possible failings in the national political process rather than
to dictate a `sacred province of state autonomy.' " 469 U. S.,
at 554 (quoting EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S., at 236).
Where it addresses this aspect of respondents' argument, see
ante, at 180-183, the Court tacitly concedes that a failing of
the political process cannot be shown in these cases because
it refuses to rebut the unassailable arguments that the
States were well able to look after themselves in the legislative process that culminated in the 1985 Act's passage.
Indeed, New York acknowledges that its "congressional delegation participated in the drafting and enactment of both the
1980 and the 1985 Acts." Pet. for Cert. in No. 91-543, p. 7.
The Court rejects this process-based argument by resorting
to generalities and platitudes about the purpose of federalism being to protect individual rights.

Ultimately, I suppose, the entire structure of our federal
constitutional government can be traced to an interest in establishing checks and balances to prevent the exercise of tyranny against individuals. But these fears seem extremely
far distant to me in a situation such as this. We face a crisis
of national proportions in the disposal of low-level radioactive waste, and Congress has acceded to the wishes of the
States by permitting local decisionmaking rather than imposing a solution from Washington. New York itself participated and supported passage of this legislation at both the
gubernatorial and federal representative levels, and then enacted state laws specifically to comply with the deadlines and
timetables agreed upon by the States in the 1985 Act. For

me, the Court's civics lecture has a decidedly hollow ring at
a time when action, rather than rhetoric, is needed to solve
a national problem.3

3 With selective quotations from the era in which the Constitution was
adopted, the majority attempts to bolster its holding that the take title
provision is tantamount to federal "commandeering" of the States. In
view of the many Tenth Amendment cases decided over the past two decades in which resort to the kind of historical analysis generated in the
majority opinion was not deemed necessary, I do not read the majority's
many invocations of history to be anything other than elaborate window
dressing. Certainly nowhere does the majority announce that its rule is
compelled by an understanding of what the Framers may have thought
about statutes of the type at issue here. Moreover, I would observe that,
while its quotations add a certain flavor to the opinion, the majority's
historical analysis has a distinctly wooden quality. One would not know
from reading the majority's account, for instance, that the nature of
federal-state relations changed fundamentally after the Civil War. That
conflict produced in its wake a tremendous expansion in the scope of the
Federal Government's law-making authority, so much so that the persons
who helped to found the Republic would scarcely have recognized the
many added roles the National Government assumed for itself. Moreover,
the majority fails to mention the New Deal era, in which the Court recognized the enormous growth in Congress' power under the Commerce
Clause. See generally F. Frankfurter & J. Landis, The Business of the

when the history not mentioned by the majority fully supports a more
expansive understanding of the legislature's authority than may have existed in the late 18th century.

Given the scanty textual support for the majority's position, it would be
far more sensible to defer to a coordinate branch of government in its
decision to devise a solution to a national problem of this kind. Certainly
in other contexts, principles of federalism have not insulated States from
mandates by the National Government. The Court has upheld congres505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of White, J.

Though I disagree with the Court's conclusion that thetake title provision is unconstitutional, I do not read its opinion to preclude Congress from adopting a similar measurethrough its powers under the Spending or Commerce
Clauses. The Court makes clear that its objection is to thealleged "commandeer[ing]" quality of the take title provision. See ante, at 175. As its discussion of the surchargeand rebate incentives reveals, see ante, at 171-172, the
spending power offers a means of enacting a take title provi-sion under the Court's standards. Congress could, in other
words, condition the payment of funds on the State's willing-ness to take title if it has not already provided a waste disposal facility. Under the scheme upheld in these cases, forexample, moneys collected in the surcharge provision might
be withheld or disbursed depending on a State's willingnessto take title to or otherwise accept responsibility for the lowlevel radioactive waste generated in state after the statutorydeadline for establishing its own waste disposal facility has
passed. See ibid.; South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 208-209 (1987);

Massachusetts v. United States, 435 U. S. 444,461 (1978).

Similarly, should a State fail to establish a waste disposalfacility by the appointed deadline (under the statute as presently drafted, January 1, 1996, $ 2021e(d)(2)(C)), Congresshas the power pursuant to the Commerce Clause to regulate
directly the producers of the waste. See ante, at 174.Thus, as I read it, Congress could amend the statute to say
that if a State fails to meet the January 1, 1996, deadline for
sional statutes that impose clear directives on state officials, including
those enacted pursuant to the Extradition Clause, see, e. g., Puerto Rico
v. Branstad, 483 U. S. 219, 227-228 (1987), the post-Civil War Amendments, see, e. g., South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 319-320,
334-335 (1966), as well as congressional statutes that require state courts
to hear certain actions, see, e. g., Testa v. Katt, 330 U. S. 386, 392-394
(1947).

achieving a means of waste disposal, and has not taken titleto the waste, no low-level radioactive waste may be shipped

out of the State of New York. See, e. g., Hodel, 452 U. S., at288. As the legislative history of the 1980 and 1985 Acts
indicates, faced with the choice of federal pre-emptive regulation and self-regulation pursuant to interstate agreementwith congressional consent and ratification, the States decisively chose the latter. This background suggests that thethreat of federal pre-emption may suffice to induce States to
accept responsibility for failing to meet critical time dead-lines for solving their low-level radioactive waste disposal
problems, especially if that federal intervention also would
strip state and local authorities of any input in locating
sites for low-level radioactive waste disposal facilities. And
should Congress amend the statute to meet the Court's objection and a State refuse to act, the National Legislature
will have ensured at least a federal solution to the waste
management problem.

Finally, our precedents leave open the possibility that Congress may create federal rights of action in the generators
of low-level radioactive waste against persons acting under
color of state law for their failure to meet certain functions
designated in federal-state programs. Thus, we have upheld 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 suits to enforce certain rights created
by statutes enacted pursuant to the Spending Clause, see,
e. g., Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Assn., 496 U. S. 498 (1990);
Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority,
479 U. S. 418 (1987), although Congress must be cautious in
spelling out the federal right clearly and distinctly, see, e. g.,
Suter v. Artist M., 503 U. S. 347 (1992) (not permitting a

$ 1983 suit under a Spending Clause statute when the ostensible federal right created was too vague and amorphous).
In addition to compensating injured parties for the State's
failure to act, the exposure to liability established by such
suits also potentially serves as an inducement to compliance
with the program mandate.

210 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of Stevens, J.

V
The ultimate irony of the decision today is that in its formalistically rigid obeisance to "federalism," the Court gives
Congress fewer incentives to defer to the wishes of state
officials in achieving local solutions to local problems. This
legislation was a classic example of Congress acting as arbiter among the States in their attempts to accept responsibility for managing a problem of grave import. The States
urged the National Legislature not to impose from Washington a solution to the country's low-level radioactive waste
management problems. Instead, they sought a reasonable
level of local and regional autonomy consistent with Art. I,

$ 10, cl. 3, of the Constitution. By invalidating the measure
designed to ensure compliance for recalcitrant States, such
as New York, the Court upsets the delicate compromise
achieved among the States and forces Congress to erect several additional formalistic hurdles to clear before achieving
exactly the same objective. Because the Court's justifications for undertaking this step are unpersuasive to me, I
respectfully dissent.

Justice Stevens, concurring in part and dissenting in
part.

Under the Articles of Confederation, the Federal Government had the power to issue commands to the States. See
Arts. VIII, IX. Because that indirect exercise of federal
power proved ineffective, the Framers of the Constitution
empowered the Federal Government to exercise legislative
authority directly over individuals within the States, even
though that direct authority constituted a greater intrusion
on state sovereignty. Nothing in that history suggests that
the Federal Government may not also impose its will upon
the several States as it did under the Articles. The Constitution enhanced, rather than diminished, the power of the
Federal Government.

211Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)
Opinion of Stevens, J.
The notion that Congress does not have the power to issue"a simple command to state governments to implement legislation enacted by Congress," ante, at 176, is incorrect andunsound. There is no such limitation in the Constitution.
The Tenth Amendment 1 surely does not impose any limit onCongress' exercise of the powers delegated to it by Article
I.2 Nor does the structure of the constitutional order or thevalues of federalism mandate such a formal rule. To the
contrary, the Federal Government directs state governmentsin many realms. The Government regulates state-operated
railroads, state school systems, state prisons, state elections,and a host of other state functions. Similarly, there can be
no doubt that, in time of war, Congress could either draftsoldiers itself or command the States to supply their quotas
of troops. I see no reason why Congress may not also com-mand the States to enforce federal water and air quality
standards or federal standards for the disposition of low-levelradioactive wastes.

The Constitution gives this Court the power to resolvecontroversies between the States. Long before Congress

1 The Tenth Amendment provides: "The powers not delegated to the
United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are
reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."

2 In United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100 (1941), we explained:

"The amendment states but a truism that all is retained which has not
been surrendered. There is nothing in the history of its adoption to suggest that it was more than declaratory of the relationship between the
national and state governments as it had been established by the Constitution before the amendment or that its purpose was other than to allay
fears that the new national government might seek to exercise powers not
granted, and that the states might not be able to exercise fully their reserved powers. See e. g., II Elliot's Debates, 123, 131, III id. 450, 464,
600; IV id. 140, 149; I Annals of Congress, 432, 761, 767-768; Story, Commentaries on the Constitution, $$ 1907-1908.

"From the beginning and for many years the amendment has been construed as not depriving the national government of authority to resort to
all means for the exercise of a granted power which are appropriate and
plainly adapted to the permitted end." Id., at 124; see also ante, at 155-157.

enacted pollution-control legislation, this Court crafted abody of " `interstate common law,' " Illinois v. City of Milwaukee, 406 U. S. 91, 106 (1972), to govern disputes betweenStates involving interstate waters. See Arkansas v. Oklahoma, 503 U. S. 91, 98-99 (1992). In such contexts, we havenot hesitated to direct States to undertake specific actions.
For example, we have "impose[d] on States an affirmativeduty to take reasonable steps to conserve and augment the
water supply of an interstate stream." Colorado v. New
Mexico, 459 U. S. 176, 185 (1982) (citing Wyoming v. Colo-rado, 259 U. S. 419 (1922)). Thus, we unquestionably have

the power to command an upstream State that is pollutingthe waters of a downstream State to adopt appropriate regulations to implement a federal statutory command.With respect to the problem presented by the cases at hand,
if litigation should develop between States that have joineda compact, we would surely have the power to grant relief in
the form of specific enforcement of the take title provision.3Indeed, even if the statute had never been passed, if one
State's radioactive waste created a nuisance that harmed itsneighbors, it seems clear that we would have had the power

3 Even if $ 2021e(d)(2)(C) is "invalidated" insofar as it applies to the State
of New York, it remains enforceable against the 44 States that have joined
interstate compacts approved by Congress because the compacting States
have, in their agreements, embraced that provision and given it independent effect. Congress' consent to the compacts was "granted subject to
the provisions of the [Act] . . . and only for so long as the [entities] established in the compact comply with all the provisions of [the] Act." Appalachian States Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact Consent Act, Pub. L.
100-319, 102 Stat. 471. Thus the compacts incorporated the provisions of
the Act, including the take title provision. These compacts, the product
of voluntary interstate cooperation, unquestionably survive the "invalidation" of $ 2021e(d)(2)(C) as it applies to New York. Congress did not "direc[t]" the States to enter into these compacts and the decision of each
compacting State to enter into a compact was not influenced by the existence of the take title provision: Whether a State went its own way or
joined a compact, it was still subject to the take title provision.

WISCONSIN DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE v.WILLIAM WRIGLEY, JR., CO.
certiorari to the supreme court of wisconsin

No. 91-119. Argued January 22, 1992--Decided June 19, 1992
During 1973-1978, respondent chewing gum manufacturer, which is based

in Chicago, sold its products in Wisconsin through a sales force consisting of a regional manager and various "field" representatives, all of
whom engaged in various activities in addition to requesting orders
from customers. Wisconsin orders were sent to Chicago for acceptance,
and were filled by shipment through common carrier from outside the
State. In 1980, petitioner Wisconsin Department of Revenue concluded
that respondent's in-state business activities during the years in question had been sufficient to support imposition of a franchise tax. Respondent objected to the assessment of that tax, maintaining that it was
immune under 15 U. S. C. $ 381(a), which prohibits a State from taxing
the income of a corporation whose only business activities within the
State consist of "solicitation of orders" for tangible goods, provided that
the orders are sent outside the State for approval and the goods are
delivered from out of state. Ultimately, the State Supreme Court disallowed the imposition of the tax.

Held: Respondent's activities in Wisconsin fell outside the protection of

$ 381(a). Pp. 220-235.

(a) In addition to any speech or conduct that explicitly or implicitly
proposes a sale, "solicitation of orders" as used in $ 381(a) covers those
activities that are entirely ancillary to requests for purchases--those
that serve no independent business function apart from their connection
to the soliciting of orders. The statutory phrase should not be interpreted narrowly to cover only actual requests for purchases or the actions that are absolutely essential to making those requests, but includes
the entire process associated with inviting an order. Thus, providing a
car and a stock of free samples to salesmen is part of the "solicitation of
orders," because the only reason to do it is to facilitate requests for
purchases. On the other hand, the statutory phrase should not be interpreted broadly to include all activities that are routinely, or even
closely, associated with solicitation or customarily performed by salesmen. Those activities that the company would have reason to engage
in anyway but chooses to allocate to its in-state sales force are not covered. For example, employing salesmen to repair or service the company's products is not part of the "solicitation of orders," since there is

good reason to get that done whether or not the company has a sales
force. Pp. 223-231.

(b) There is a de minimis exception to the activities that forfeit $ 381
immunity. Whether a particular activity is sufficiently de minimis
to avoid loss of $ 381 immunity depends upon whether that activity establishes a nontrivial additional connection with the taxing State.
Pp. 231-232.

(c) Respondent's Wisconsin business activities were not limited to
those specified in $ 381. Although the regional manager's recruitment,
training, and evaluation of employees and intervention in credit disputes, as well as the company's use of hotels and homes for sales-related
meetings, must be viewed as ancillary to requesting purchases, the sales
representatives' practices of replacing retailers' stale gum without cost,
of occasionally using "agency stock checks" to sell gum to retailers who
had agreed to install new display racks, and of storing gum for these
purposes at home or in rented space cannot be so viewed, since those
activities constituted independent business functions quite separate
from the requesting of orders and respondent had a business purpose
for engaging in them whether or not it employed a sales force. Moreover, the nonimmune activities, when considered together, are not de
minimis. While their relative magnitude was not large compared to
respondent's other Wisconsin operations, they constituted a nontrivial
additional connection with the State. Pp. 232-235.

Opinion of the Court

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
Section 101(a) of Public Law 86-272, 73 Stat. 555, 15U. S. C. $ 381, prohibits a State from taxing the income of a

corporation whose only business activities within the Stateconsist of "solicitation of orders" for tangible goods, provided
that the orders are sent outside the State for approval andthe goods are delivered from out of state. The issue in this
case is whether respondent's activities in Wisconsin fell out-side the protection of this provision.

Respondent William Wrigley, Jr., Co., is the world's largestmanufacturer of chewing gum. Based in Chicago, it sells

gum nationwide through a marketing system that dividesthe country into districts, regions, and territories. During

parts of other States, which was subdivided into severalgeographic territories.

The district manager for the midwestern district had hisresidence and company office in Illinois, and visited Wisconsin only six to nine days each year, usually for a sales
meeting or to call on a particularly important account. Theregional manager of the Milwaukee region resided in Wisconsin, but Wrigley did not provide him with a company of-fice. He had general responsibility for sales activities in the
region, and would typically spend 80-to-95% of his timeworking with the sales representatives in the field or contacting certain "key" accounts. The remainder of his time
was devoted to administrative activities, including writing
and reviewing company reports, recruiting new sales representatives, making recommendations to the district manager
concerning the hiring, firing, and compensation of sales representatives, and evaluating their performance. He would
preside at full-day sales strategy meetings for all regional
sales representatives once or twice a year. The manager
from 1973 to 1976, John Kroyer, generally held these meetings in the "office" he maintained in the basement of his
home, whereas his successor, Gary Hecht, usually held them
at a hotel or motel. (Kroyer claimed income tax deductions
for this office, but Wrigley did not reimburse him for it,
though it provided a filing cabinet.) Mr. Kroyer also intervened two or three times a year to help arrange a solution
to credit disputes between the Chicago office and important
local accounts. Mr. Hecht testified that he never engaged in
such activities, although Wrigley's formal position description for regional sales manager continued to list as one of
the assigned duties "[r]epresent[ing] the company on credit
problems as necessary."

The sales or "field" representatives in the Milwaukee region, each of whom was assigned his own territory, resided
in Wisconsin. They were provided with company cars, but
not with offices. They were also furnished a stock of gum

(with an average wholesale value of about $1,000), a supply ofdisplay racks, and promotional literature. These materials

were kept at home, except that one salesman, whose apart-ment was too small, rented storage space at about $25 per
month, for which he was reimbursed by Wrigley.

On a typical day, the sales representative would load upthe company car with a supply of display racks and several

cases of gum, and would visit accounts within his territory.In addition to handing out promotional materials and free
samples, and directly requesting orders of Wrigley products,he would engage in a number of other activities which Wrigley asserts were designed to promote sales of its products.
He would, for example, provide free display racks to retailers
(perhaps several on any given day), and would seek to have
these new racks, as well as pre-existing ones, prominently
located. The new racks were usually filled from the retailer's existing stock of Wrigley gum, but it would sometimes
happen--perhaps once a month--that the retailer had no
Wrigley products on hand and did not want to wait until they
could be ordered from the wholesaler. In that event, the
rack would be filled from the stock of gum in the salesman's
car. This gum, which would have a retail value of $15 to
$20, was not provided without charge. The representative
would issue an "agency stock check" to the retailer, indicating the quantity supplied; he would send a copy of this to
the Chicago office or to the wholesaler, and the retailer
would ultimately be billed (by the wholesaler) in the proper
amount.

When visiting a retail account, Wrigley's sales representative would also check the retailer's stock of gum for freshness, and would replace stale gum at no cost to the retailer.
This was a regular part of a representative's duties, and at
any given time up to 40% of the stock of gum in his possession would be stale gum that had been removed from retail
stores. After accumulating a sufficient amount of stale
product, the representative either would ship it back to

Wrigley's Chicago office or would dispose of it at a local
Wisconsin landfill.

Wrigley did not own or lease real property in Wisconsin,
did not operate any manufacturing, training, or warehouse
facility, and did not have a telephone listing or bank account.
All Wisconsin orders were sent to Chicago for acceptance,
and were filled by shipment through common carrier from
outside the State. Credit and collection activities were similarly handled by the Chicago office. Although Wrigley engaged in print, radio, and television advertising in Wisconsin,
the purchase and placement of that advertising was managed
by an independent advertising agency located in Chicago.

Wrigley had never filed tax returns or paid taxes in Wisconsin; indeed, it was not licensed to do business in that
State. In 1980, petitioner Wisconsin Department of Revenue concluded that the company's in-state business activities
during the years 1973-1978 had been sufficient to support
imposition of a franchise tax, and issued a tax assessment on
a percentage of the company's apportionable income for
those years. Wrigley objected to the assessment, maintaining that its Wisconsin activities were limited to "solicitation
of orders" within the meaning of 15 U. S. C. $ 381, and that
it was therefore immune from Wisconsin franchise taxes.
After an evidentiary hearing, the Wisconsin Tax Appeals
Commission unanimously upheld the imposition of the tax.

this decision, with one commissioner dissenting, after the
County Circuit Court vacated the original order on procedural grounds. CCH Wis. Tax Rep. || 202-926 (1987). The
County Circuit Court then reversed on the merits, CCH Wis.

dissenting. 153 Wis. 2d 559, 451 N. W. 2d 444 (1989). The
Wisconsin Supreme Court, in a unanimous opinion, reversed
yet once again, thus finally disallowing the Wisconsin tax.

II
In Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minne-sota, 358 U. S. 450, 454 (1959), we considered Minnesota's imposition of a properly apportioned tax on the net income ofan Iowa cement corporation whose "activities in Minnesota
consisted of a regular and systematic course of solicitation oforders for the sale of its products, each order being subject
to acceptance, filling and delivery by it from its plant [inIowa]." The company's salesmen, operating out of a threeroom office in Minneapolis rented by their employer, solicitedpurchases by cement dealers and by customers of cement
dealers. They also received complaints about goods thathad been lost or damaged in shipment, and forwarded these
back to Iowa for further instructions. Id., at 454-455. Thecement company's contacts with Minnesota were otherwise
very limited; it had no bank account, real property, or ware-housed merchandise in the State. We nonetheless rejected
Commerce Clause and due process challenges to the tax:

"We conclude that net income from the interstate opera-tions of a foreign corporation may be subjected to state

taxation provided the levy is not discriminatory and isproperly apportioned to local activities within the taxing
State forming sufficient nexus to support the same."Id., at 452.

The opinion in Northwestern States was handed down inFebruary 1959. Less than a week later, we granted a motion to dismiss (apparently on mootness grounds) the appealof a Louisiana Supreme Court decision that had rejected due
process and Commerce Clause challenges to the impositionof state net-income taxes based on local solicitation of orders
that were sent out of state for approval and shipping.Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. Collector of Revenue, 234

Opinion of the Court
La. 651, 101 So. 2d 70 (1958), appeal dism'd, 359 U. S. 28
(1959). That decision was particularly significant because,
unlike the Iowa cement company in Northwestern States, the
Kentucky liquor company in Brown-Forman did not lease
(or own) any real estate in the taxing State. Rather, its
activities were limited to

"the presence of `missionary men' who call upon wholesale dealers [in Louisiana] and who, on occasion, accompany the salesmen of these wholesalers to assist them in
obtaining a suitable display of appellant's merchandise
at the business establishments of said retailers . . . ."
234 La., at 653-654, 101 So. 2d, at 70.

Two months later, we denied certiorari in another Louisiana
case upholding the imposition of state tax on the income of an
out-of-state corporation that neither leased nor owned real
property in Louisiana and whose only activities in that State
"consist[ed] of the regular and systematic solicitation of orders for its product by fifteen salesmen." International
Shoe Co. v. Fontenot, 236 La. 279, 280, 107 So. 2d 640 (1958),
cert. denied, 359 U. S. 984 (1959).

Although our refusals to disturb the Louisiana Supreme
Court's decisions in Brown-Forman and International Shoe

did not themselves have any legal significance, see Hopfmann v. Connolly, 471 U. S. 459, 460-461 (1985); United
States v. Carver, 260 U. S. 482, 490 (1923), our actions in
those cases raised concerns that the broad language of
Northwestern States might ultimately be read to suggest
that a company whose only contacts with a State consisted
of sending "drummers" or salesmen into that State could
lawfully be subjected to (properly apportioned) income taxation based on the interstate sales those representatives generated. In Heublein, Inc. v. South Carolina Tax Comm'n,
409 U. S. 275 (1972), we reviewed the history of $ 381 and
noted that the complaints of the business community over

the uncertainty created by these cases were the drivingforce behind the enactment of $ 381:

" `Persons engaged in interstate commerce are in doubtas to the amount of local activities within a State that
will be regarded as forming a sufficient . . . connectio[n]with the State to support the imposition of a tax on net
income from interstate operations and `properly appor-tioned' to the State.' "

Within months after our actions in these three cases, Con-gress responded to the concerns that had been expressed
by enacting Public Law 86-272, which established what therelevant section heading referred to as a "minimum standard" for imposition of a state net-income tax based on solici-tation of interstate sales:

"No State . . . shall have power to impose, for anytaxable year . . . , a net income tax on the income derived
within such State by any person from interstate com-merce if the only business activities within such State
by or on behalf of such person during such taxable yearare either, or both, of the following:

"(1) the solicitation of orders by such person, or hisrepresentative, in such State for sales of tangible personal property, which orders are sent outside the Statefor approval or rejection, and, if approved, are filled by
shipment or delivery from a point outside the State; and"(2) the solicitation of orders by such person, or his
representative, in such State in the name of or for the

is true that the denial of certiorari is not a decision on the merits, and
although grounds other than the preceden[t] of the Northwestern [States]
cas[e] were advanced as a basis for sustaining the Brown-Forman and

in those cases has given strength to the apprehensions which had already
been generated among small and moderate size businesses").

U. S. C. $ 381(a).
Although we have stated that $ 381 was "designed to de-fine clearly a lower limit" for the exercise of state taxing

power, and that "Congress' primary goal" was to provide"[c]larity that would remove [the] uncertainty" created by
Northwestern States, see Heublein, supra, at 280, experiencehas proved $ 381's "minimum standard" to be somewhat less
than entirely clear. The primary sources of confusion, inthis case as in others, have been two questions: (1) what is
the scope of the crucial term "solicitation of orders"; and(2) whether there is a de minimis exception to the activity
(beyond "solicitation of orders") that forfeits $ 381 immunity.We address these issues in turn.

A
Section 381(a)(1) confers immunity from state incometaxes on any company whose "only business activities" in

that State consist of "solicitation of orders" for interstatesales. "Solicitation," commonly understood, means "[a]sking" for, or "enticing" to, something, see Black's Law Dic-tionary 1393 (6th ed. 1990); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2169 (1981) ("solicit" means "to approachwith a request or plea (as in selling or begging)"). We think
it evident that in this statute the term includes, not just ex-plicit verbal requests for orders, but also any speech or conduct that implicitly invites an order. Thus, for example, asalesman who extols the virtues of his company's product to
the retailer of a competitive brand is engaged in "solicita-tion" even if he does not come right out and ask the retailer
to buy some. The key question in this case is whether, andto what extent, "solicitation of orders" covers activities that
neither explicitly nor implicitly propose a sale.

Opinion of the Court

In seeking the answer to that question, we reject the prop-osition put forward by Wisconsin and its amici that we must

construe $ 381 narrowly because we said in Heublein that" `unless Congress conveys its purpose clearly, it will not be
deemed to have significantly changed the Federal-State bal-ance,' " 409 U. S., at 281-282 (citation omitted). That principle--which we applied in Heublein to reject a suggested in-ference from $ 381 that States cannot regulate solicitation in
a manner that might cause an out-of-state company to forfeitits tax immunity--has no application in the present case. Because $ 381 unquestionably does limit the power of States totax companies whose only in-state activity is "the solicitation
of orders," our task is simply to ascertain the fair meaningof that term. FMC Corp. v. Holliday, 498 U. S. 52, 57 (1990).

Wisconsin views some courts as having adopted the posi-tion that an out-of-state company forfeits its $ 381 immunity
if it engages in "any activity other than requesting the cus-tomer to purchase the product." Brief for Petitioner 21; see
also id., at 19, n. 8 (citing Hervey v. AMF Beaird, Inc., 250Ark. 147, 464 S. W. 2d 557 (1971);

Clairol, Inc. v. Kingsley,109 N. J. Super. 22, 262 A. 2d 213, aff 'd, 57 N. J. 199, 270 A.

2d 702 (1970), appeal dism'd, 402 U. S. 902 (1971)).2 Argu-ably supporting this interpretation is subsection (c) of $ 381,

2 Amici New Jersey et al. contend that our summary disposition of
Clairol binds us to this narrow construction of $ 381(a). Though Clairol
is frequently cited for this construction, the opinion in the case does not
in fact recite it. In any event, our summary disposition affirmed only the
judgment below, and cannot be taken as adopting the reasoning of the
lower court. Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 784, n. 5 (1983); Fusari v. Steinberg, 419 U. S. 379, 391-392 (1975) (Burger, C. J., concurring).
The judgment in Clairol would have been the same even under a broader
construction of "solicitation of orders," since the company's in-state activities included sending nonsales representatives to provide customers technical assistance in the use of Clairol products. 109 N. J. Super., at 29-30,

which expands the immunity of subsection (a) when the out-of-state seller does its marketing through independent contractors, to include not only solicitation of orders for sales,but also actual sales, and in addition "the maintenance . . . of
an office . . . by one or more independent contractors whoseactivities . . . consist solely of making sales, or soliciting orders for sales . . . ." 3 The plain implication of this is thatwithout that separate indulgence the maintenance of an office for the exclusive purpose of conducting the exemptedsolicitation and sales would have provided a basis for taxation--i. e., that the phrase "solicitation of orders" does notembrace the maintenance of an office for the exclusive purpose of soliciting orders. Of course the phrase "solicitationof orders" ought to be accorded a consistent meaning within
the section, see Sorenson v. Secretary of Treasury, 475 U. S.851, 860 (1986), and if it does not embrace maintaining an
office for soliciting in subsection (c), it does not do so in sub-section (a) either. One might argue that the necessity of
special permission for an office establishes that the phrase"solicitation of orders" covers only the actual requests for
purchases or, at most, the actions absolutely essential tomaking those requests.

We think, however, that would be an unreasonable readingof the text. That the statutory phrase uses the term "solicitation" in a more general sense that includes not merely theultimate act of inviting an order but the entire process associated with the invitation is suggested by the fact that $ 381

3 Title 15 U. S. C. $ 381(c) reads in its entirety as follows:
"For purposes of subsection (a) of this section, a person shall not be
considered to have engaged in business activities within a State during
any taxable year merely by reason of sales in such State, or the solicitation
of orders for sales in such State, of tangible personal property on behalf
of such person by one or more independent contractors, or by reason of
the maintenance, of an office in such State by one or more independent
contractors whose activities on behalf of such person in such State consist
solely of making sales, or soliciting orders for sales, or [sic] tangible personal property."

Opinion of the Court

describes "the solicitation of orders" as a subcategory, not ofin-state

acts, but rather of in-state "business activities"--a
term that more naturally connotes courses of conduct. SeeWebster's Third New International Dictionary 22 (1981) (defining "activity" as "an occupation, pursuit, or recreation in
which a person is active--often used in pl. <business activities>"). Moreover, limiting "solicitation of orders" to actual
requests for purchases would reduce $ 381(a)(1) to a nullity.(It is obviously impossible to make a request without some

accompanying action, such as placing a phone call or drivinga car to the customer's location.) And limiting it to acts
"essential" for making requests would engender endless uncertainty, contrary to the whole purpose of the statute. (Is
it "essential" to use a company car, or to take a taxi, in order
to conduct in-person solicitation? For that matter, is it "essential" to solicit in person?) It seems to us evident that
"solicitation of orders" embraces request-related activity
that is not even, strictly speaking, essential, or else it would
not cover salesmen's driving on the State's roads, spending
the night in the State's hotels, or displaying within the State
samples of their product. We hardly think the statute had
in mind only day-trips into the taxing jurisdiction by emptyhanded drummers on foot. See United States Tobacco Co.
v. Commonwealth, 478 Pa. 125, 140, 386 A. 2d 471, 478 ("Congress could hardly have intended to exempt only walking
solicitors"), cert. denied, 439 U. S. 880 (1978). And finally,
this extremely narrow interpretation of "solicitation" would
cause $ 381 to leave virtually unchanged the law that existed
before its enactment. Both Brown-Forman (where the
salesman assisted wholesalers in obtaining suitable displays
for whiskey at retail stores) and International Shoe (where
hotel rooms were used to display shoes) would be decided as
they were before, upholding the taxation.

At the other extreme, Wrigley urges that we adopt a broad
interpretation of "solicitation" which it describes as having
been adopted by the Wisconsin Supreme Court based on that

court's reading of cases in Pennsylvania and New York, see160 Wis. 2d, at 82, 465 N. W. 2d, at 811-812 (citing United

States Tobacco Co. v. Commonwealth, supra; Gillette Co. v.State Tax Comm'n, 56 App. Div. 2d 475, 393 N. Y. S. 2d 186

Indiana Dept. of Revenue v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 275Ind. 378, 384, 416 N. E. 2d 1264, 1268 (1981). According to

Wrigley, this would treat as "solicitation of orders" any ac-tivities that are "ordinary and necessary `business activities'
accompanying the solicitation process" or are "routinelyassociated with deploying a sales force to conduct the solicitation, so long as there is no office, plant, warehouse orinventory in the State." Brief for Respondent 9, 19-20; see
also J. Hellerstein, State Taxation || 6.11[2], p. 245 (1983)("[S]olicitation ought to be held to embrace other normal
incidents of activities of salesmen" or the "customary func-tions of sales representatives of out-of-state merchants").
We reject this "routinely-associated-with-solicitation" or"customarily-performed-by-salesmen" approach, since it converts a standard embracing only a particular activity ("solici-tation") into a standard embracing all activities routinely
conducted by those who engage in that particular activity("salesmen"). If, moreover, the approach were to be applied
(as respondent apparently intends) on an industry-by-industry basis, it would render the limitations of $ 381(a)
toothless, permitting "solicitation of orders" to be whatevera particular industry wants its salesmen to do.

4 The dissent explicitly agrees with our rejection of the "ordinary and
necessary" standard advocated by Wrigley. Post, at 236. It then proceeds, however, to adopt that very standard. It states that the test
should be whether a given activity is one that "reasonable buyers would
consider . . . to be a part of the solicitation itself and not a significant and
independent service or component of value." Post, at 237. It is obvious
that those activities that a reasonable buyer would consider "part of the
solicitation itself" rather than an "independent service" are those that are
customarily performed in connection with solicitation. Any doubt that
this is what the dissent intends is removed by its later elaboration of its

228 WISCONSIN DEPT. OF REVENUE v.

WILLIAM WRIGLEY, JR., CO.

Opinion of the Court

In any case, we do not regard respondent's proposed ap-proach to be an accurate characterization of the Wisconsin

Supreme Court's opinion. The Wisconsin court construed"solicitation of orders" to reach only those activities that are
"closely associated" with solicitation, industry practice beingonly one factor to be considered in judging the "close[ness]"
of the connection between the challenged activity and theactual requests for orders. 160 Wis. 2d, at 82, 465 N. W. 2d,
at 811-812. The problem with that standard, it seems tous, is that it merely reformulates rather than answers the
crucial question. "What constitutes the `solicitation of or-ders'?" becomes "What is `closely related' to a solicitation
request?" This fails to provide the "[c]larity that would re-move uncertainty" which we identified as the primary goal
of $ 381. Heublein, 409 U. S., at 280.We proceed, therefore, to describe what we think the
proper standard to be. Once it is acknowledged, as we haveconcluded it must be, that "solicitation of orders" covers
more than what is strictly essential to making requests forpurchases, the next (and perhaps the only other) clear line is
the one between those activities that are entirely ancillaryto requests for purchases--those that serve no independent

test in the context of the facts of this case. The dissent repeatedly inquires whether an activity is a "normal ac[t] of courtesy from seller to
buyer," post, at 242 (emphasis added); whether it is a "common solicitation practic[e]," post, at 244 (emphasis added); and whether Wrigley "exceed[ed] the normal scope of solicitation," post, at 242 (emphasis added).
Of course, given Wrigley's significant share of the Wisconsin chewing gum
market, most activities it chooses to "conduc[t] in the course of solicitation," post, at 246, will be viewed as a normal part of the solicitation process itself. Had Wrigley's sales representatives routinely approved orders
on the spot; or accepted payments on past-due accounts; or even made
outright sales of gum, it is difficult to see how a reasonable buyer would
have thought that was not "part of the solicitation itself"--it certainly has
no "independent value" to him. Nothing in the text of the statute suggests that it was intended to confer tax immunity on whatever activities
are engaged in by sales agents in a particular industry.

business function apart from their connection to the solicit-ing of orders--and those activities that the company would

have reason to engage in anyway but chooses to allocate toits in-state sales force.

5 Cf. National Tires, Inc. v. Lindley,

68 Ohio App. 2d 71, 78-79, 426 N. E. 2d 793, 798 (1980) (company's activities went beyond solicitation to "functions more
commonly related to maintaining an on-going business").
Providing a car and a stock of free samples to salesmen is
part of the "solicitation of orders," because the only reason
to do it is to facilitate requests for purchases. Contrariwise,
employing salesmen to repair or service the company's products is not part of the "solicitation of orders," since there is
good reason to get that done whether or not the company
has a sales force. Repair and servicing may help to increase
purchases; but it is not ancillary to requesting purchases,
and cannot be converted into "solicitation" by merely being
assigned to salesmen. See, e. g., Herff Jones Co. v. State
Tax Comm'n, 247 Ore. 404, 412, 430 P. 2d 998, 1001-1002

5 The dissent states that ancillarity should be judged, not from the perspective of the seller, but from the persective of the buyer. Post, at 237
(test is whether "reasonable buyers would consider [the activities] to be a
part of the solicitation itself") (emphasis added); post, at 243 ("The test I
propose . . . requires an objective assessment from the vantage point of a
reasonable buyer") (emphasis added); post, at 246 (question is whether the
activities "possess independent value to the customer") (emphasis added).
As explained earlier, see n. 4, supra, this rule inevitably results in a
whatever-the-industry-wants standard, despite the dissent's unequivocal
disavowal of such a test.

The dissent also suggests that ancillarity should be judged by asking
whether a particular challenged activity is "related to a particular sales
call or to a particular sales solicitation," post, at 244 (emphasis added).
This standard, besides being amorphous, cannot be correct. Those activities that are most clearly not immunized by the statute--e. g., actual sales,
collection of funds--would seem to be the ones most closely "related" to
particular acts of actual solicitation. And activities the dissent finds immunized in the present case--maintenance of a storage facility and use of
a home office--are extremely remote.

(1967) (no $ 381 immunity for sales representatives' collec-tion activities).

As we have discussed earlier, the text of the statute (the"office" exception in subsection (c)) requires one exception

to this principle: Even if engaged in exclusively to facilitaterequests for purchases, the maintenance of an office within
the State, by the company or on its behalf, would go beyondthe "solicitation of orders." We would not make any more
generalized exception to our immunity standard on the basisof the "office" provision. It seemingly represents a judgment that a company office within a State is such a signifi-cant manifestation of company "presence" that, absent a specific exemption, income taxation should always be allowed.Jantzen, Inc. v. District of Columbia, 395 A. 2d 29, 32 (D. C.
1978); see generally Hellerstein, State Taxation || 6.4.Wisconsin urges us to hold that no postsale activities can
be included within the scope of covered "solicitation." Wedecline to do so. Activities that take place after a sale will
ordinarily not be entirely ancillary in the sense we have de-scribed, see,

e. g., Miles Laboratories v. Department of Reve-nue, 274 Ore. 395, 400, 546 P. 2d 1081, 1083 (1976) (replacing

damaged goods), but we are not prepared to say that willinvariably be true. Moreover, the presale/postsale distinction is hopelessly unworkable. Even if one disregards theconfusion that may exist concerning when a sale takes place,
cf. Uniform Commercial Code $ 2-401, 1A U. L. A. 675 (1989),manufacturers and distributors ordinarily have ongoing relationships that involve continuous sales, making it often im6 Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, post, at 242, 246, both BrownForman Distillers Corp. v.

70 (1958), and International Shoe Co. v. Fontenot, 236 La. 279, 107 So. 2d
640 (1958), would have been decided differently under these principles.
The various activities at issue in those cases (renting a room for temporary
display of sample products; assisting wholesalers in obtaining suitable
product display in retail shops) would be considered merely ancillary
to either wholesale solicitation or downstream (consumer or retailer)
solicitation.

possible to determine whether a particular incidental activ-ity was related to the sale that preceded it or the sale that

followed it. B

The Wisconsin Supreme Court also held that a companydoes not necessarily forfeit its tax immunity under $ 381 by
performing some in-state business activities that go beyond"solicitation of orders"; rather, it said, "[c]ourts should also
analyze" whether these additional activities were " `devia-tions from the norm' " or "

de minimis activities." 160Wis. 2d, at 82, 465 N. W. 2d, at 811 (citation omitted). Wisconsin asserts that the plain language of the statute bars thisrecognition of a de minimis exception, because the immunity
is limited to situations where "the only business activitieswithin [the] State" are those described, 15 U. S. C. $ 381 (emphasis added). This ignores the fact that the venerablemaxim

de minimis non curat lex ("the law cares not fortrifles") is part of the established background of legal principles against which all enactments are adopted, and which allenactments (absent contrary indication) are deemed to accept. See, e. g., Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504U. S. 607, 618 (1992); Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U. S. 1, 8-9
(1992); Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651, 674 (1977); Abbott
Laboratories v. Portland Retail Druggists Assn., Inc., 425U. S. 1, 18 (1976); Industrial Assn. of San Francisco v.

United States, 268 U. S. 64, 84 (1925). It would be especiallyunreasonable to abandon normal application of the de minimis principle in construing $ 381, which operates in suchstark, all-or-nothing fashion: A company either has complete
net-income tax immunity or it has none at all, even for itssolicitation activities. Wisconsin's reading of the statute
renders a company liable for hundreds of thousands of dollarsin taxes if one of its salesmen sells a 10-cent item in state.
Finally, Wisconsin is wrong in asserting that application ofthe

de minimis principle "excise[s] the word `only' from thestatute." Brief for Petitioner 27. The word "only" places

a strict limit upon the categories of activities that are cov-ered by $ 381, not upon their substantiality. See, e. g.,

Drackett Prods. Co. v. Conrad, 370 N. W. 2d 723, 726 (N. D.1985); Kimberly Clark, 275 Ind., at 383-384, 416 N. E. 2d,
at 1268.Whether a particular activity is a

de minimis deviationfrom a prescribed standard must, of course, be determined

with reference to the purpose of the standard. Section 381was designed to increase--beyond what Northwestern States
suggested was required by the Constitution--the connectionthat a company could have with a State before subjecting
itself to tax. Accordingly, whether in-state activity otherthan "solicitation of orders" is sufficiently

de minimis toavoid loss of the tax immunity conferred by $ 381 depends

upon whether that activity establishes a nontrivial additionalconnection with the taxing State.

III
Wisconsin asserts that at least six activities performed byWrigley within its borders went beyond the "solicitation of

orders": the replacement of stale gum by sales representa-tives; the supplying of gum through "agency stock checks";
the storage of gum, racks, and promotional materials; therental of space for storage; the regional managers' recruitment, training, and evaluation of employees; and the regionalmanagers' intervention in credit disputes.

7 Since none of

7 Wisconsin has also argued that the scope of the regional managers'
activities caused their residences to be, "[in] economic reality," Wrigley
offices in the State. Brief for Petitioner 32. If this means that having
resident salesmen without offices can sometimes be as commercially effective as having nonresident salesmen with offices, perhaps it is true. But
it does not establish that Wrigley "maintained an office" in the sense necessary to come within the exception to the "entirely ancillary" standard
we have announced. See supra, at 230. Nor does the regional managers'
occasional use of their homes for meetings with salesmen, or Kroyer's
uncompensated dedication of a portion of his home basement to his own
office. The maintenance of an office necessary to trigger the exception

Opinion of the Court
these activities can reasonably be viewed as requests for or-ders covered by $ 381, Wrigley was subject to tax unless they

were either ancillary to requesting orders or de minimis.We conclude that the replacement of stale gum, the supplying of gum through "agency stock checks," and the storageof gum were not ancillary. As to the first: Wrigley would
wish to attend to the replacement of spoiled product whetheror not it employed a sales force. Because that activity
serves an independent business function quite separate fromrequesting orders, it does not qualify for $ 381 immunity.
Miles Laboratories, 274 Ore., at 400, 546 P. 2d, at 1083. Al-though Wrigley argues that gum replacement was a "promotional necessity" designed to ensure continued sales, Brieffor Respondent 31, it is not enough that the activity facilitate
sales; it must facilitate the requesting of sales, which thisdid not.

8

The provision of gum through "agency stock checks" presents a somewhat more complicated question. It appears
from the record that this activity occurred only in connectionwith the furnishing of display racks to retailers, so that it

was arguably ancillary to a form of consumer solicitation.Section 381(a)(2) shields a manufacturer's "missionary" request that an indirect customer (such as a consumer) placean order, if a successful request would ultimately result in
an order's being filled by a $ 381 "customer" of the manufacmust be more formally attributed to the out-of-state company itself, or to
the agents of that company in their agency capacity--as was, for example,
the rented office in Northwestern States.

8 The dissent argues that this activity must be considered part of "solicitation" because, inter alia, it was "minimal," and not "significant." Post,
at 243. We disagree. It was not, as the dissent suggests, a practice that
involved simple "acts of courtesy" that occurred only because a salesman
happened to be on the scene and did not wish to "harm the company."
Post, at 242, 244. Wrigley deliberately chose to use its sales force to engage in regular and systematic replacement of stale product on a level
that amounted to several thousand dollars per year, which is a lot of chewing gum.

turer, i. e., by the wholesaler who fills the orders of the re-tailer with goods shipped to the wholesaler from out of state.

Cf. Gillette, 56 App. Div. 2d, at 482, 393 N. Y. S. 2d, at 191("Advice to retailers on the art of displaying goods to the
public can hardly be more thoroughly solicitation . . ."). Itmight seem, therefore, that setting up gum-filled display
racks, like Wrigley's general advertising in Wisconsin, wouldbe immunized by $ 381(a)(2). What destroys this analysis,
however, is the fact that Wrigley made the retailers pay for
the gum, thereby providing a business purpose for supplyingthe gum quite independent from the purpose of soliciting

consumers. Since providing the gum was not entirely ancil-lary to requesting purchases, it was not within the scope of
"solicitation of orders." 9 And because the vast majority ofthe gum stored by Wrigley in Wisconsin was used in connection with stale gum swaps and agency stock checks, thatstorage (and the indirect rental of space for that storage)
was in no sense ancillary to "solicitation."By contrast, Wrigley's in-state recruitment, training, and
evaluation of sales representatives and its use of hotels andhomes for sales-related meetings served no purpose apart
from their role in facilitating solicitation. The same mustbe said of the instances in which Wrigley's regional sales
manager contacted the Chicago office about "rather nasty"credit disputes involving important accounts in order to "get
the account and [Wrigley's] credit department communicat9 The dissent speculates, without any basis in the record, that Wrigley
might have chosen to charge for the gum, not for the profit, but because
giving it away would "lower the per unit cost of all goods purchased,"
which "could create either the fact or the perception that retailers were
not receiving the same price." Post, at 245. Though Wrigley's motive
for choosing to make a profit on these items seems to us irrelevant in any
event, we cannot avoid observing how unlikely it is that this was the reason Wrigley did not include free gum in its (per-unit-cost-distorting) free
racks, although it did, as the record shows, regularly give away other
(presumably per-unit-cost-distorting) free gum. Wrigley itself did not
have the temerity to make this argument.

ing." App. 71, 72. It hardly appears likely that this mediating function between the customer and the central office
would have been performed by some other employee--some
company ombudsman, so to speak--if the on-location sales
staff did not exist. The purpose of the activity, in other
words, was to ingratiate the salesman with the customer,
thereby facilitating requests for purchases.

Finally, Wrigley argues that the various nonimmune activities, considered singly or together, are de minimis. In
particular, Wrigley emphasizes that the gum sales through
"agency stock checks" accounted for only 0.00007% of Wrigley's annual Wisconsin sales, and in absolute terms amounted
to only several hundred dollars a year. We need not decide
whether any of the nonimmune activities was de minimis
in isolation; taken together, they clearly are not. Wrigley's
sales representatives exchanged stale gum, as a matter of
regular company policy, on a continuing basis, and Wrigley
maintained a stock of gum worth several thousand dollars in
the State for this purpose, as well as for the less frequently
pursued (but equally unprotected) purpose of selling gum
through "agency stock checks." Although the relative magnitude of these activities was not large compared to Wrigley's other operations in Wisconsin, we have little difficulty
concluding that they constituted a nontrivial additional connection with the State. Because Wrigley's business activities within Wisconsin were not limited to those specified in

$ 381, the prohibition on net-income taxation contained in
that provision was inapplicable.

Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Kennedy, J., dissenting

Justice O'Connor, concurring in Parts I and II, and
concurring in the judgment.

I join Parts I and II of the Court's opinion. I do not
agree, however, that the replacement of stale gum served
an independent business function. The replacement of stale
gum by the sales representatives was part of ensuring the
product was available to the public in a form that may be
purchased. Making sure that one's product is available and
properly displayed serves no independent business function
apart from requesting purchases; one cannot offer a product
for sale if it is not available. I agree, however, that the storage of gum in the State and the use of agency stock checks
were not ancillary to solicitation and were not de minimis.
On that basis, I would hold that Wrigley's income is subject
to taxation by Wisconsin.

Justice Kennedy, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Blackmun join, dissenting.

Congress prohibits the States from imposing taxes on income derived from "business activities" in interstate commerce and limited to the "solicitation of orders" under certain conditions. 15 U. S. C. $ 381(a). The question we face
is whether Wrigley has this important tax immunity for its
business activities in the State of Wisconsin. I agree with
the Court that the statutory phrase "solicitation of orders"
is but a subset of the phrase "business activities." Ibid.;
ante, at 225-226. I submit with all respect, though, that the
Court does not allow its own analysis to take the proper
course. The Court instead devises a test that excludes business activities with a close relation to the solicitation of orders, activities that advance the purpose of the statute and
its immunity.

The Court is correct, in my view, to reject the two polar
arguments urged upon us: one, that ordinary and necessary
business activities surrounding the solicitation of orders are

part of the exempt solicitation itself; and the other, that the
only exempt activities are those essential to the sale. Ante,
at 225, 227. Having done so, however, the Court exits a
promising avenue of analysis and adopts a test with little
relation to the practicalities of solicitation. The Court's rule
will yield results most difficult to justify or explain. My
submission is that the two polarities suggest the proper analysis and that the controlling standard lies between. It is
difficult to formulate a complete test in one case, but the
general rule ought to be that the statute exempts business
activities performed in connection with solicitation if reasonable buyers would consider them to be a part of the solicitation itself and not a significant and independent service or
component of value.

I begin with the statute. Section 381(a) provides as
follows:

"No State, or political subdivision thereof, shall have
power to impose, for any taxable year ending after September 14, 1959, a net income tax on the income derived
within such State by any person from interstate commerce if the only business activities within such State
by or on behalf of such person during such taxable year
are either, or both, of the following:

"(1) the solicitation of orders by such person, or his
representative, in such State for sales of tangible personal property, which orders are sent outside the State
for approval or rejection, and, if approved, are filled by
shipment or delivery from a point outside the State; and

"(2) the solicitation of orders by such person, or his
representative, in such State in the name of or for the
benefit of a prospective customer of such person, if orders by such customer to such person to enable such
customer to fill orders resulting from such solicitation
are orders described in paragraph (1)." 15 U. S. C.

Kennedy, J., dissenting

The key phrases, as recognized by the Court, are "businessactivities" and "solicitation of orders." Ante, at 225-226.

By using "solicitation of orders" to define a subset of "busi-ness activities," the text suggests that the immunity to be
conferred encompasses more than a specific request for apurchase; it includes the process of solicitation, as distinguished from manufacturing, warehousing, or distribution.Congress could have written $ 381(a) to exempt "acts" of
"solicitation" or "solicitation of orders," but it did not. Thedecision to use the phrase "business activities," while not
unambiguous, suggests that the statute must be read toaccord with the practical realities of interstate sales solicitations, which, after all, Congress acted to protect.The textual implication I find draws support from legal
and historical context. Even those who approach legislativehistory with much trepidation must acknowledge that the
statute was a response to three specific court decisions:Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota, 358
U. S. 450 (1959), International Shoe Co. v. Fontenot, 236 La.279, 107 So. 2d 640 (1958), cert. denied, 359 U. S. 984 (1959),
and Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. Collector of Revenue,234 La. 651, 101 So. 2d 70 (1958), appeal dism'd, 359 U. S. 28
(1959). S. Rep. No. 658, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 2-3 (1959)(hereinafter S. Rep.); H. R. Rep. No. 936, 86th Cong., 1st
Sess., 1-2 (1959) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.). See ante, at 220-223, and n. 1. These decisions departed from what had been
perceived as a well-settled rule, stated in Norton Co. v. De-partment of Revenue of Ill., 340 U. S. 534 (1951), that solicitation in interstate commerce was protected from taxationin the State where the solicitation took place.

"Where a corporation chooses to stay at home in allrespects except to send abroad advertising or drummers
to solicit orders which are sent directly to the home of-fice for acceptance, filling, and delivery back to the
buyer, it is obvious that the State of the buyer has nolocal grip on the seller. Unless some local incident oc505us1100L 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT

curs sufficient to bring the transaction within its taxingpower, the vendor is not taxable." Id., at 537.

Firm expectations within the business community were builtupon the rule as restated in Norton. Companies engaging
in interstate commerce conformed their activities to the lim-its our cases seemed to have endorsed. To be sure, the decision to stay at home might have derived in some respectsfrom independent business concerns. The expense and commitment of an in-state sales office, for example, might haveinformed a decision to send salesmen into a State without
further staff support. Some interstate operations, though,carried the unmistakable mark of a legal, rather than business, justification. The technical requirement that ordersbe approved at the home office, unless approval required
judgment or expertise (for example, if the order dependedon an ancillary decision to give credit or to name an official
retailer), was no doubt the product of the legal rule.These settled expectations were upset in 1959, their
continuing vitality put in doubt by Northwestern States,International Shoe, and Brown-Forman. In Northwestern
States, the Court upheld state income taxation against twocompanies whose in-state operations included a sales staff
and sales office. 358 U. S., at 454-455. Our disposition wasconsistent with prior law, since both companies maintained
offices within the taxing State. Ibid. But the Court's opin-ion was broader than the holding itself and marked a departure from prior law.

"We conclude that net income from the interstate opera-tions of a foreign corporation may be subjected to state

taxation provided the levy is not discriminatory and isproperly apportioned to local activities within the taxing
State forming sufficient nexus to support the same."
Id., at 452.

In the absence of case law giving meaning to "sufficientnexus," the Court's use of this indeterminate phrase cre505us1100L 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT

ated concern and apprehension in the business community.
S. Rep., at 2-4; H. R. Rep., at 1. Apprehension increased
after our denial of certiorari in International Shoe and
Brown-Forman, where the Louisiana Supreme Court upheld the taxation of companies whose business activities
within the State were limited to solicitation by salespeople.
S. Rep., at 3; H. R. Rep., at 2. The concern stemmed not
only from the prospect for tax liability in an increasing number of States, but also from the uncertainty of its amount
and apportionment, the burdens of compliance, a lack of uniformity under state law, the withdrawal of small businesses
from States where the cost and complexity of compliance
would be great, and the extent of liability for back taxes.
S. Rep., at 2-4.

As first drafted by the Senate Finance Committee, $ 381(a)
would have addressed the decisions in Northwestern States,
International Shoe, and Brown-Forman. S. Rep., at 2-3;
H. R. Rep., at 3; 105 Cong. Rec. 16378, 16934 (1959). The
Committee recommended a bill defining "business activities"
in three subsections, with one subsection corresponding to
the facts in each of the three cases. S. 2524, 86th Cong.,
1st Sess. (1959). Before the bill was enacted, however, the
Senate rejected the third of these subsections, corresponding
to Northwestern States, which would have extended protection to companies with in-state sales offices. 105 Cong. Rec.
16469-16477 (1959) (Senate debate on an amendment proposed by Sen. Talmadge (Ga.)). But the other two subsections, those dealing with the state-court decisions in International Shoe and Brown-Forman, were retained. 105
Cong. Rec., at 16367, 16376, 16471, 16934; H. R. Rep., at 3.
Thus, while Northwestern States provided the first impetus
for the enactment of $ 381(a), it does not explain the statute
in its final form. By contrast, the history of enactment
makes clear that $ 381(a) exempts from state income taxation
at least those business activities at issue in International

Shoe and Brown-Forman. These cases must inform anyattempt to give meaning to $ 381(a).

International Shoe manufactured shoes in St. Louis, Mis-souri. Its only activity within the State of Louisiana consisted of regular and systematic solicitation by 15 salespeople. No office or warehouse was maintained insideLouisiana, and orders were accepted and shipped from outside the State. The salespeople carried product samples,drove in company-owned automobiles, and rented hotel
rooms or rooms of public buildings in order to make displays.
International Shoe, 236 La., at 280, 107 So. 2d, at 640; Hartman, "Solicitation" and "Delivery" Under Public Law 86-272:
An Uncharted Course, 29 Vand. L. Rev. 353, 358 (1976).

Brown-Forman distilled and packaged whiskey in Louisville, Kentucky, for sale in Louisiana and elsewhere. It solicited orders in Louisiana with the assistance of an in-state
sales staff. All orders were approved and shipped from outside the State. There was no in-state office of any kind.
Brown-Forman salespeople performed two functions: they
solicited orders from wholesalers, who were direct customers
of Brown-Forman; and they accompanied the wholesalers'
own sales force on visits to retailers, who were solicited by
the wholesalers. The Brown-Forman salespeople did not
solicit orders at all when visiting retailers, nor could they
sell direct to them. They did assist in arranging suitable
displays of the distiller's merchandise in the retail establishments. Brown-Forman, 234 La., at 653-654, 101 So.
2d, at 70.

The activities in International Shoe and Brown-Forman
extended beyond specific acts of entreaty; they included merchandising and display, as well as other simple acts of courtesy from buyer to seller, such as arranging product displays
and calling on the customer of a customer. The activities
considered in International Shoe and Brown-Forman are
by no means exceptional. Checking inventories, displaying
products, replacing stale product, and verifying credit are all

normal acts of courtesy from seller to buyer. J. Hellerstein,1 State Taxation: Corporate Income and Franchise Taxes

|| 6.11[2], p. 245 (1983). A salesperson cannot solicit orderswith any degree of effectiveness if he is constrained from
performing small acts of courtesy. Note, State Taxation of
Interstate Commerce: Public Law 86-272, 46 Va. L. Rev. 297,315 (1960).

The business activities of Wrigley within Wisconsin havesubstantial parallels to those considered in

International
Shoe and Brown-Forman. Wrigley has no manufacturingfacility in the State. It maintains no offices or warehouses

there. The only product it owns in the State is the small
amount necessary for its salespeople to call upon their accounts. All orders solicited by its salespeople are approved
or rejected outside of the State. All orders are shipped
from outside of the State. Other activities, such as intervening in credit disputes, hiring salespeople, or holding sales
meetings in hotel rooms, do not exceed the scope of $ 381(a);
I agree with the Court that these too are the business activities of solicitation. Ante, at 234-235; App. 10-13.

The Department of Revenue, in an apparent concession of
the point, does not contend that the business activities of
Wrigley exceed the normal scope of solicitation; instead the
Department relies on a distinction between business activities undertaken before and after the sale. Brief for Petitioner 18, 21. Under the Department's submission, acts
leading to the sale are within the statutory safe harbor,
while any act following the sale is beyond it. Ibid. I agree
with the Court, as well as with the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, that this distinction is unworkable in the context of
a continuing business relation with many repeat sales.
Ante, at 230-231; App. to Pet. for Cert. A-41.

As the Court indicates, the case really turns upon our assessment of two practices: replacing stale product and providing gum in display racks. Ante, at 233. If the retailers
relied on the Wrigley sales force to replace all stale product

243Cite as: 505 U. S. 214 (1992)
Kennedy, J., dissenting
and that service was itself significant, say on the magnitudeof routine deliveries of fresh bread, then a separate service

would seem to be involved. But my understanding of therecord is that replacement of stale gum took place only during the course of regular solicitation. App. 27-28, 41, 58,
117-118. There was no contract to perform this service.There is no indication in the record that this was the only

method dealers relied upon to remove stale product. It isnot plausible to believe that by enacting $ 381(a) Congress
insisted that every sales representative in every industrywould be prohibited from doing just what Wrigley did.

Acceptance of the stale gum replacement does not allow
industry practices to replace objective statutory inquiry.
The existence of a contract to perform this service, or an
indication in the record that this service provided an independent component of significant value, would alter the
case's disposition, regardless of the seller's intentions. The
test I propose does not depend on the sellers' intentions or
motives whatsoever; rather it requires an objective assessment from the vantage point of a reasonable buyer. If a
reasonable buyer would consider the replacement of stale
gum to provide significant independent value, then this service would subject Wrigley to taxation. The majority appears to concede the point in part when it observes Wrigley
replaced stale gum free of charge, ante, at 234, n. 9, which
provides a strong indication that the replacement of stale
gum is valuable to Wrigley, not its customers, as an assurance of quality given in the course of an ongoing solicitation.

I agree with the Court's approach, which is to provide
guidance by some general rule that is faithful to the precise
language of the statute. But it ought not to do so without
recognition of some of the most essential aspects of solicitation techniques. No responsible company would expect its
sales force to decline giving minimal assistance to a retailer
in replacing damaged or stale product. In enacting $ 381(a),
Congress recognized the importance of interstate solicitation

to the strength of our national economy. The statute mustnot to be interpreted to repeal the rules of good sales techniques or to forbid common solicitation practices under thethreat of forfeiting this important tax exemption. Congress
acted to protect interstate solicitation, not to mandate
inefficiency.Even accepting the majority's test on its own terms, the

business activities which the Court finds to be within thesafe harbor of the federal statute are less ancillary to a real
sales solicitation than are the activities it condemns. Thecredit adjustment techniques and the training sessions the
Court approves are not related to a particular sales call or
to a particular sales solicitation, but the condemned display
and replacement practices are. I do not understand why the
Court thinks that a credit dispute over an old transaction,
handled by telephone weeks or months later is exempt because it "ingratiate[s] the salesman with the customer,
thereby facilitating requests for purchases," ante, at 235, but
that this same process of ingratiation does not occur when a
salesperson who is on the spot to solicit an order refuses to
harm the company by leaving the customer with bad product
on the shelf. If there were any distinction between the two,
I should think we would approve the replacement and condemn the credit adjustment. The majority fails to address
this anomaly under its test, responding instead that my observation of it suggests ambiguity in my own. Ante, at 229,
n. 5. In my view, both the gum replacement and credit adjustment are within the scope of solicitation.

I would agree with the Court that the furnishing of racks
with gum that is sold to the customer presents a problem
of a different order, ante, at 233, but here too I think it adds
no independent value apart from the solicitation itself. To
begin with, I think it rather well accepted that the setting
up of display racks and the giving of advice on sales presentation is central to the salesperson's role in cultivating customers. There are dangers for the manufacturer, however,

if the salesperson spends the time to set up a display andthen stocks it with free goods, because this could create

either the fact or the perception that retailers were not re-ceiving the same price. Free goods lower the per unit cost
of all goods purchased. The simplest policy to avoid thisproblem is to charge for the goods displayed, and that is what
occurred here. Moreover, I cannot ignore, as the Court ap-pears to do, that a minuscule amount of gum, no more than
0.00007% (seven one-hundred thousands of one percent) ofWrigley's in-state sales, was stocked into display racks in
this fashion. Brief for Respondent 5; App. to Pet. for Cert.A-43. Indeed, the testimony is that Wrigley salespeople
would stock these display racks out of their own supply ofsamples only as a matter of last resort, in instances where
the retailer possessed an inadequate supply of gum and couldnot await delivery in the normal course.

"Q Well, I take it that if you put in the stand and itwas a new stand, you took the gum out of your vehicle
and transferred it to him there; is that correct?"A No, I would not say that's correct.

"Q Well, did you ever stock new stands from yourvehicle?

your tenure as a field representative in 1978?"A Boy. I would just be guessing. Maybe a dozen
times."Q And just what would--what all happened in that
circumstance that you wound up putting in a new standand taking the gum out of your vehicle and transferring
it to the retailer?"A Well, like I said, primarily I wanted to get a stand
in and then he wanted to get that order through hiswholesaler; but if he couldn't wait, if he said my wholesaler was just in yesterday or something or he wasnot going to be in for a week, he didn't want a stand

sitting around, so we would then fill it and then bill thewholesaler. . . ." App. 37-38.

Under the circumstances described here, I fail to see whythe stocking of a gum display does not "ingratiate the salesman with the customer, thereby facilitating requests for pur-chases," ante, at 235, as is required under the rule formulated by the Court. The small amount of gum involved instocking a display rack, no more than $15-$20 worth, belies
any speculation, ante, at 234, n. 9, that Wrigley was drivenby a profit motive in charging customers for this gum.
App. 38.The Court pursues a laudable effort to state a workable
rule, but in the attempt condemns business activities thatare bound to solicitation and do not possess independent
value to the customer apart from what often accompanies asuccessful solicitation. The business activities of Wrigley in
Wisconsin, just as those considered in International Shoeand Brown-Forman, are the solicitation of orders. The
swapping of stale gum and the infrequent stocking of freshgum into new displays are not services that Wrigley was
under contract to perform; they are not activities that canbe said to have provided their own component of significant
value; rather they are activities conducted in the course ofsolicitation and whose legal effect should be the same. My
examination of the language of the statute, considered in thecontext of its enactment, demonstrates that the concerns to
which $ 381(a) was directed, and for which its language wasdrafted, are misapprehended by the Court's decision today.

I would affirm the judgment of the Wisconsin SupremeCourt.

AMERICAN NATIONAL RED CROSS v. S. G. et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe first circuit

No. 91-594. Argued March 3, 1992--Decided June 19, 1992
In a state-court tort action, respondents alleged that one of them had

contracted AIDS from a transfusion of contaminated blood supplied by
petitioner American National Red Cross. The Red Cross removed the
suit to the Federal District Court, claiming federal jurisdiction based
on, inter alia, the provision in its federal charter authorizing it "to sue
and be sued in courts of law and equity, State or Federal, within the
jurisdiction of the United States." The court rejected respondents' motion to remand the case to state court, holding that the charter provision
conferred original federal jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals reversed.

Held: The charter's "sue and be sued" provision confers original federalcourt jurisdiction. Pp. 250-265.

(a) A congressional charter's "sue and be sued" provision may be read
to confer federal-court jurisdiction if, but only if, it specifically mentions
the federal courts. The charter must contain an express authorization,
such as "in all state courts . . . and in any circuit court of the United
States," Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 818, or " `in any
court of law or equity, State or Federal,' " D'Oench, Duhme & Co. v.
FDIC, 315 U. S. 447, 455-456, rather than a mere grant of general corporate capacity to sue, such as " `in courts of record, or any other place
whatsoever,' " Bank of the United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61, 85-
86, or "in all courts of law and equity within the United States," Bankers Trust Co. v. Texas & Pacific R. Co., 241 U. S. 295, 304-305. The Red
Cross Charter provision has an express authorization and thus should be
read to confer jurisdiction. Pp. 250-257.

(b) Respondents' several arguments against this conclusion--that the
well-pleaded complaint rule bars the removal; that language in congressional charters enacted closely in time to the 1947 amendment of the
Red Cross Charter incorporating the provision in dispute show a coherent drafting pattern that casts doubt on congressional intent to confer
federal jurisdiction over Red Cross cases; and that the 1947 amendment
was meant not to confer jurisdiction, but to clarify the Red Cross' capacity to sue in federal courts where an independent jurisdictional basis
exists--are all unavailing. Pp. 257-263.

(c) The holding in this case leaves the jurisdiction of the federal
courts well within Article III's limits. This Court has consistently held

that Article III's "arising under" jurisdiction is broad enough to authorize Congress to confer federal-court jurisdiction over actions involving

and equity, State or Federal, within the jurisdiction of theUnited States." 33 Stat. 600, as amended, 36 U. S. C. $ 2.
In this case we consider whether that "sue and be sued" pro-vision confers original jurisdiction on federal courts over all
cases to which the Red Cross is a party, with the conse-quence that the organization is thereby authorized to remove
from state to federal court any state-law action it is defend-ing. We hold that the clause does confer such jurisdiction.

surgeon and the manufacturer of a piece of medical equip-ment used during the procedure. After discovering that the
Red Cross had supplied the tainted blood, respondents sued
it, too, again in state court, and moved to consolidate the twoactions. Before the state court decided that motion, the

Red Cross invoked the federal removal statute, 28 U. S. C.$ 1441, to remove the latter suit to the United States District
Court for the District of New Hampshire. The Red Crossclaimed federal jurisdiction based both on the diversity of
the parties and on the "sue and be sued" provision of its
charter, which it argued conferred original federal jurisdiction over suits involving the organization. The District
Court rejected respondents' motion to remand the case to
state court, holding that the charter provision conferred
original federal jurisdiction. See District Court order of
May 24, 1990, reprinted at App. to Pet. for Cert. 18a-25a.

On interlocutory appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed. 938 F. 2d 1494 (1991).
The Court of Appeals compared the Red Cross Charter's
"sue and be sued" provision with analogous provisions in federal corporate charters previously examined by this Court,
and concluded that the relevant language in the Red Cross
Charter was similar to its cognates in the charter of the first
Bank of the United States, construed in Bank of the United
States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61 (1809), and in that of the
federally chartered railroad construed in Bankers Trust Co.
v. Texas & Pacific R. Co., 241 U. S. 295 (1916), in neither of
which cases did we find a grant of federal jurisdiction. The
Court of Appeals distinguished Osborn v. Bank of United
States, 9 Wheat. 738 (1824), where we reached the opposite
result under the charter of the second Bank of the United
States, the Court of Appeals finding it significant that the
second Bank's authorization to sue and be sued spoke of a
particular federal court and of state courts already possessed

of jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals also discounted theRed Cross's reliance on our opinion in D'Oench, Duhme &

Co. v. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., 315 U. S. 447 (1942),concluding that in that case we had "not[ed] only incidentally" that federal jurisdiction was based on the "sue and besued" clause in the FDIC's charter. See 938 F. 2d, at 1497-
1499. The Court of Appeals found support for its conclu-sion in the location of the Red Cross Charter's "sue and be
sued" provision in the section "denominat[ing] standard cor-porate powers,"

id., at 1499, as well as in legislative historyof the amendment to the Red Cross Charter adding the current "sue and be sued" language, and in the different formof analogous language in other federal corporate charters
enacted contemporaneously with that amendment, see id.,at 1499-1500.

We granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 976 (1991), to answer thisdifficult and recurring question.

Since its founding in 1881 as part of an international effortto ameliorate soldiers' wartime suffering, the American Red

Cross has expanded its activities to include, among others,the civilian blood-supply services here at issue. The organization was reincorporated in 1893, and in 1900 received itsfirst federal charter, which was revised in 1905. See American National Red Cross, Report of the Advisory Committeeon Organization 4 (1946) (hereinafter Advisory Report), reprinted at App. to Brief for Appellants in No. 90-1873 (CA1),pp. 94, 101.

1 Although more than 40 District Court cases have considered this issue,
no result clearly predominates. Compare Pet. for Cert. 10, n. 4 (listing
cases finding jurisdictional grant in Red Cross Charter's "sue and be sued"
provision), with id., at 11, n. 5 (listing cases reaching opposite conclusion).
Reflecting this confusion, the only other Court of Appeals to consider this
issue decided differently from the First Circuit. See Kaiser v. Memorial
Blood Center of Minneapolis, Inc., 938 F. 2d 90 (CA8 1991).

Opinion of the Court
The 1905 charter empowered the Red Cross "to sue and
be sued in courts of law and equity within the jurisdiction of
the United States." Act of Jan. 5, 1905, ch. 23, $ 2, 33 Stat.
600. At that time the provision would not have had the
jurisdictional significance of its modern counterpart, since
the law of the day held the involvement of a federally chartered corporation sufficient to render any case one "arising
under" federal law for purposes of general statutory federalquestion jurisdiction. See Pacific Railroad Removal Cases,
115 U. S. 1, 14 (1885). In 1925, however, Congress restricted
the reach of this jurisdictional theory to federally chartered
corporations in which the United States owned more than
one-half of the capital stock. Act of Feb. 13, 1925, ch. 229,

$ 12, 43 Stat. 941; codified as amended at 28 U. S. C. $ 1349.2
Since the effect of the 1925 law on nonstock corporations like
the Red Cross is unclear, see, e. g., C. H. v. American Red
Cross, 684 F. Supp. 1018, 1020-1022 (ED Mo. 1987) (noting
split in authority over whether $ 1349 applies to nonstock
corporations),3 its enactment invested the charter's "sue and
be sued" clause with a potential jurisdiction significance previously unknown to it.

Its text, nevertheless, was left undisturbed for more than
20 years further, until its current form, authorizing the Red
Cross "to sue and be sued in courts of law and equity, State
or Federal, within the jurisdiction of the United States,"
took shape with the addition of the term "State or Federal"
to the 1905 language, as part of an overall revision of the
organization's charter and bylaws. See Act of May 8, 1947,

2 Congress had previously overruled much of Pacific Railroad Removal
Cases, 115 U. S. 1 (1885), by withdrawing federal jurisdiction over cases
involving federally chartered railroads based solely on the railroad's federal incorporation, see Act of Jan. 28, 1915, ch. 22, $ 5, 38 Stat. 803, 804, a
limitation irrelevant for our purposes.

3 We do not address this question, as we hold that the "sue and be sued"

provision of the Red Cross's Charter suffices to confer federal jurisdiction
independently of the organization's federal incorporation.

A

As indicated earlier, we do not face a clean slate. Begin-ning with Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in 1809, we have

had several occasions to consider whether the "sue and besued" provision of a particular federal corporate charter conferred original federal jurisdiction over cases to which thatcorporation was a party, and our readings of those provisions
not only represented our best efforts at divining congres-sional intent retrospectively, but have also placed Congress
on prospective notice of the language necessary and suffi-cient to confer jurisdiction. See,

e. g., United States v. Merriam, 263 U. S. 179, 186 (1923) (Congress presumed to intendjudicially settled meaning of terms); Cannon v. University

of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 696-698 (1979) (presuming congres-sional knowledge of interpretation of similarly worded earlier statute). Those cases therefore require visitation withcare.

In Deveaux, we considered whether original federal juris-diction over suits by or against the first Bank of the United
States was conferred by its charter. The language in pointauthorized the Bank " `to sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded, answer and be answered, defend and be defended,in courts of record, or any other place whatsoever,' " 5
Cranch, at 85. In the opinion written by Chief Justice Mar-shall, the Court held this language to confer no federal jurisdiction, reading it as a mere grant to the bank of the normalcorporate capacity to sue, id., at 85-86. The Court contrasted the charter's "sue and be sued" provision with oneauthorizing the institution of certain suits against the bank's
officers "in any court of record of the United States, or of

Opinion of the Court
[sic] either of them," a provision the Court described as "expressly authoriz[ing] the bringing of that action in the federal or state courts," id., at 86. The Chief Justice concluded
that this latter provision "evince[d] the opinion of congress,
that the right to sue does not imply a right to sue in the
courts of the union, unless it be expressed," ibid.

The same issue came to us again 15 years later in Osborn.
By this time Congress had established the second Bank of
the United States, by a charter that authorized it "to sue
and be sued, plead and be impleaded, answer and be answered, defend and be defended, in all state courts having
competent jurisdiction, and in any circuit court of the United
States." Act of Apr. 10, 1816, ch. 44, $ 7, 3 Stat. 266, 269.
In its interpretation of this language, the Court, again speaking through Chief Justice Marshall, relied heavily on its
Deveaux analysis, and especially on the contrast developed
there between the first bank charter's "sue and be sued"
provision and its provision authorizing suits against bank officers. See Osborn, 9 Wheat., at 818. Holding that the language of the second bank's charter "could not be plainer by
explanation," ibid., in conferring federal jurisdiction, the Osborn Court distinguished Deveaux as holding that "a general
capacity in the Bank to sue, without mentioning the courts
of the Union, may not give a right to sue in those courts," 9
Wheat., at 818.

With the basic rule thus established, our next occasion to
consider the issue did not arise until Bankers Trust, nearly
a century later. The federal charter considered in that case
authorized a railroad corporation "to sue and be sued, plead
and be impleaded, defend and be defended, in all courts of
law and equity within the United States." Act of Mar. 3,
1871, ch. 122, $ 1, 16 Stat. 573, 574. Testing this language
against that construed in Deveaux and Osborn, we concluded
that it "d[id] not literally follow" its analogues considered in
either of the earlier cases, 241 U. S., at 304, but held, never505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:02 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
theless, that it had "the same generality and natural import"as the clause contained in the first Bank charter. Thus, we

followed Deveaux and found in the failure to authorize fed-eral court litigation expressly no grant of federal jurisdiction. 241 U. S., at 304-305.

Last came D'Oench, Duhme, where we held that theFDIC's charter granted original federal jurisdiction. That

jurisdiction was not, we explained, "based on diversity ofcitizenship. Respondent, a federal corporation, brings this
suit under an Act of Congress authorizing it to sue or besued `in any court of law or equity, State or Federal.' " 315
U. S., at 455-456 (citation and footnote omitted). It is per-fectly true, as respondents stressed in argument, that in an
accompanying footnote we quoted without comment another
part of the same statute, providing that " `[a]ll suits of a civilnature at common law or in equity to which the Corporation

shall be a party shall be deemed to arise under the laws of
the United States: Provided, That any such suit to which the
Corporation is a party in its capacity as receiver of a State
bank and which involves only the rights or obligations of depositors, creditors, stockholders and such State bank under
State law shall not be deemed to arise under the laws of the
United States.' " Id., at 455-456, n. 2.4 The footnote did
not, however, raise any doubt that the Court held federal
jurisdiction to rest on the terms of the "sue and be sued"
clause. Quite the contrary, the footnote's treatment naturally expressed the subordinate importance of the provision
it quoted. While as a state bank's receiver the FDIC might
lose the benefit of the deemer clause as a grant of federal

4 The "sue and be sued" language was originally enacted in the statute
creating the FDIC, see Banking Act of 1933, ch. 89, $ 8, 48 Stat. 162, 172,
and was reenacted in the 1935 amendments to that statute, see Banking
Act of 1935, ch. 614, $ 101, 49 Stat. 684, 692. The 1935 amendments also
enacted for the first time the deemer provision we quoted in footnote 2 of
our opinion in D'Oench, Duhme & Co. v. FDIC, 315 U. S. 447, 455 (1942).

Opinion of the Court
jurisdiction, the "sue and be sued" clause would settle thejurisdictional question conclusively, in any case.

5

B
These cases support the rule that a congressional charter's"sue and be sued" provision may be read to confer federal

court jurisdiction if, but only if, it specifically mentions the fed-eral courts. In Deveaux, the Court found a "conclusive argument" against finding a jurisdictional grant in the "sue and besued" clause in the fact that another provision of the same document authorized suits by and against bank officers "in anycourt of record of the United States, or of

[sic] either ofthem . . . ." See 5 Cranch, at 86. In contrasting these two

provisions the Deveaux Court plainly intended to indicatethe degree of specificity required for a jurisdictional grant.

6

That is certainly how the Osborn Court understood Deveaux,as it described the latter provision as an "express grant of

jurisdiction," 9 Wheat., at 818, in contrast to the first Bankcharter's "sue and be sued" provision, which, "without men5 Respondents argue that the parties in D'Oench, Duhme did not litigate
the jurisdictional issue. See Brief for Respondents 18-22. But the parties' failure to challenge jurisdiction is irrelevant to the force of our holding on that issue. See, e. g., FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U. S. 215, 231
(1990) (federal courts have independent obligation to examine their own
jurisdiction); see also Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75, 100 (1807) (Marshall,
C. J.) (giving controlling weight to previous jurisdictional holding by Court
even though parties to previous case had not raised jurisdictional issue).

6 The dissent reads Deveaux as distinguishing between these two provisions not on this basis, but rather on the ground that the provision authorizing suits against bank officers allowed the bringing of a particular cause
of action. See post, at 270. That reading might be possible if Chief Justice Marshall had not nipped it in the bud. He did not explain the difference between the jurisdictional significance of the two clauses in question
by saying that jurisdiction may be granted only in provisions referring to
courts in which causes of action could be brought. He explained it simply
by inferring, from the drafting contrasts, "the opinion of congress that the
right to sue does not imply the right to sue in the courts of the union
unless it be expressed." Deveaux, 5 Cranch, at 86 (emphasis added).

Opinion of the Court
tioning the courts of the Union," ibid., was held merely to
give the Bank "a general capacity . . . to sue [but not] a right
to sue in those courts," ibid.7 The Osborn Court thus found
a jurisdictional grant sufficiently stated in the second Bank
charter's "sue and be sued" provision, with its express federal reference, remarking that "[t]o infer from [Deveaux]
that words expressly conferring a right to sue in those courts
do not give the right, is surely a conclusion which the premises do not warrant." Ibid.8

Applying the rule thus established, in Bankers Trust we
described the railroad charter's "sue and be sued" provision,
with its want of any reference to federal courts, and, holding
it up against its analogues in Deveaux and Osborn, we found

7 The dissent accuses us of repeating what it announces as Chief Justice
Marshall's misunderstanding, in Osborn, of his own previous opinion in
Deveaux. See post, at 271. We are honored.

8 Contrary to respondents' argument, our cases do not support a requirement that federal jurisdiction under a "sue and be sued" clause requires
mention of the specific federal court on which it is conferred. D'Oench,
Duhme, of course, bars any such reading. Nor would Osborn v. Bank of
United States, 9 Wheat. 738 (1824), require such a specification even if
D'Oench, Duhme were not on the books. When the second Bank was
chartered, two sets of federal courts, the Circuit Courts and the District
Courts, shared overlapping original federal jurisdiction. See, e. g., E.
Surrency, History of the Federal Courts 61 (1987). If (as apparently was
the case) the framers of the second Bank's charter wished to provide that
all suits in federal court involving the Bank be brought in one set of courts,
it would have been necessary for any jurisdictional grant to specify which
set of federal trial courts was being invested with jurisdiction. This need
no longer exists, and the means chosen by the drafters of the early charters to resolve that problem should not be thought significant in resolving
the very different issue before us today. Moreover, the larger part of the
Court's analysis in Osborn speaks only of the charter's mention of federal
courts, not its specification of the Circuit Courts in particular. See 9
Wheat., at 817-818. The charter's specification of those courts would
have made it natural for the Osborn Court to indicate its reliance on that
narrower ground, had it believed such specificity to be required. The fact
that it did not so indicate is strong evidence that the Court thought it
unnecessary.

Opinion of the Court
it closer to the former.9 Finally, in D'Oench, Duhme webased our finding of jurisdiction on the "sue and be sued"

provision of the FDIC charter, which mentioned the federalcourts in general, but not a particular federal court.

The rule established in these cases makes it clear that theRed Cross Charter's "sue and be sued" provision should be
read to confer jurisdiction. In expressly authorizing the or-ganization to sue and be sued in federal courts, using language resulting in a "sue and be sued" provision in all rele-vant respects identical to one on which we based a holding
of federal jurisdiction just five years before, the provisionextends beyond a mere grant of general corporate capacity
to sue, and suffices to confer federal jurisdiction.

IV
Respondents offer several arguments against this conclu-sion, none of which we find availing.

9 The dissent is playful in manufacturing a conflict between our synthesis
of the cases and the opinion in Bankers Trust Co. v. Texas and Pacific R.
Co., 241 U. S. 295 (1916). See post, at 272. The dissent first quotes the
Court's construction in the Bankers Trust opinion, that the clause at issue
there implied no jurisdictional grant, but simply rendered the corporation
" `capable of suing and being sued by its corporate name in any court of law
or equity--Federal, state or territorial--whose jurisdiction as otherwise
competently defined was adequate to the occasion.' " Post, at 272 (emphasis omitted) (quoting 241 U. S., at 303). The dissent then concludes that
"[t]hat paraphrasing of the railroad charter, in terms that would spell jurisdiction under the key the Court adopts today, belies any notion that
Bankers Trust was using the same code book." Post, at 273. The dissent thus attempts to set up a conflict between our analysis and the result
in Bankers Trust, by suggesting that that Court's interpretation of the
provision (i. e., to confer capacity to sue in courts including federal ones)
should itself be subject to a second-order interpretation, which under our
analysis might require a holding of jurisdiction, the conclusion rejected
by the Bankers Trust Court. This "interpretation of an interpretation"
methodology is simply illegitimate, originating not in our opinion but in
the dissent's whimsy. Like our predecessors, we are construing a charter,
not a paraphrase.

258 AMERICAN NAT. RED CROSS v. S. G.

Opinion of the Court

A
First, we can make short work of respondents' argumentthat the charter's conferral of federal jurisdiction is nevertheless subject to the requirements of the "well-pleaded com-plaint" rule (that the federal question must appear on the
face of a well-pleaded complaint) limiting the removal ofcases from state to federal court. See Brief for Respondents 38-46. Respondents erroneously invoke that rule out-side the realm of statutory "arising under" jurisdiction, i. e.,
jurisdiction based on 28 U. S. C. $ 1331, to jurisdiction basedon a separate and independent jurisdictional grant, in this
case, the Red Cross Charter's "sue and be sued" provision.The "well-pleaded complaint" rule applies only to statutory
"arising under" cases, see Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank
of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480, 494 (1983); see also 13B C. Wright,A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure

67, 75, n. 17; it has no applicability here.

B
Respondents also claim that language used in congres-sional charters enacted closely in time to the 1947 amendment casts doubt on congressional intent thereby to conferfederal jurisdiction over cases involving the Red Cross. Respondents argue that the 1948 amendment to the charter ofthe Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), the 1947 amendment to the charter of the Federal Crop Insurance Corpora-tion (FCIC), and the 1935 amendment to the FDIC's charter,
each of which includes explicit grants of federal jurisdiction,together demonstrate "a practice of using clear and explicit
language to confer federal jurisdiction over corporations[Congress] had created." Brief for Respondents 27.

The argument does not hold up. The CCC amendment isirrelevant to this enquiry, as it conferred exclusive, rather
than concurrent, federal jurisdiction. See Act of June 29,

505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:02 PAGES OPINPGT

259Cite as: 505 U. S. 247 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
1948, ch. 704, $ 4, 62 Stat. 1070. There is every reason to
expect Congress to take great care in its use of explicit language when it wishes to confer exclusive jurisdiction, given
our longstanding requirement to that effect.10 Its employment of explicitly jurisdictional language in the CCC's case
thus raises no suggestion that its more laconic Red Cross
amendment was not meant to confer concurrent federal
jurisdiction.

Nor do the other two enactments support respondents' argument. The statutes were passed 12 years apart and employed verbally and doctrinally distinct formulations. Compare Banking Act of 1935, ch. 614, $ 101, 49 Stat. 684, 692
(providing that suits involving FDIC "shall be deemed to
arise under the laws of the United States"), with Act of Aug.
1, 1947, ch. 440, $ 7, 61 Stat. 719 (providing that FCIC "may
sue and be sued in its corporate name in any court of record
of a State having general jurisdiction, or in any United
States district court, and [that] jurisdiction is hereby conferred upon such district court to determine such controversies without regard to the amount in controversy").11 These
differences are not merely semantic: the jurisdictional effect
of the FDIC's provision depends on the 28 U. S. C. $ 1331
grant of general federal-question jurisdiction, while the

10 See Claflin v. Houseman, 93 U. S. 130, 136 (1876) ("[O]ur judgment
[has] been . . . to affirm [concurrent state-court] jurisdiction, where it is
not excluded by express provision, or by incompatibility in its exercise
arising from the nature of the particular case"); see also Charles Dowd
Box Co. v. Courtney, 368 U. S. 502, 508 (1962) (Claflin's analysis of this
question "has remained unmodified through the years").

11 Respondents do not repeat the Court of Appeals's argument that the

original language of the FCIC charter tracked in all relevant respects that
in the Red Cross's post-1947 charter, and that Congress's later amendment
of the FCIC charter to make jurisdiction more explicit thus implicitly suggests that Congress considered that language insufficient to confer jurisdiction. See 938 F. 2d 1494, 1500 (CA1 1991). We note here only that
the Red Cross adequately rebuts that argument. See Brief for Petitioner 42-43.

Opinion of the Court
FCIC's provision functions independently of $ 1331. Thesedifferences of both form and substance belie respondents'

claim of a coherent drafting pattern against which to judgethe ostensible intent behind the Red Cross amendment.

If, indeed, respondents' argument could claim any plausi-bility, it would have to be at the cost of ignoring the 1942
D'Oench, Duhme opinion citing the FDIC charter's "sue andbe sued" provision as the source of federal jurisdiction in
that case. See 315 U. S., at 455. If the "sue and be sued"clause is sufficient for federal jurisdiction when it occurs in
the same charter with the language respondents claim to beat odds with its jurisdictional significance, it is certainly sufficient standing alone. In any event, the fact that our opin-ion in D'Oench, Duhme was handed down before the 1947
amendment to the Red Cross Charter indicates that Con-gress may well have relied on that holding to infer that
amendment of the Red Cross Charter's "sue and be sued"provision to make it identical to the FDIC's would suffice to
confer federal jurisdiction. See, e. g., Cannon, 441 U. S., at696-697. Congress was, in any event, entitled to draw the
inference. C

Respondents would have us look behind the statute to findquite a different purpose when they argue that the 1947
amendment may have been meant not to confer jurisdiction,but to clarify the Red Cross's capacity to sue in federal
courts where an independent jurisdictional basis exists.See Brief for Respondents 23-27. The suggestion is that
Congress may have thought such a clarification necessaryafter passage of the 1925 statute generally bringing an end
to federal incorporation as a jurisdictional basis. See 28U. S. C. $ 1349.

12 But this suggestion misconstrues $ 1349 as

12 See Act of Feb. 13, 1925, ch. 229, $ 12, 43 Stat. 941 (currently codified
at 28 U. S. C. $ 1349). The exception, for federally chartered corporations
over one-half owned by the United States, is irrelevant to our enquiry.

somehow affecting a federally chartered corporation's capacity to sue, when by its own terms it speaks only to jurisdiction. If, then, respondents are correct that the enactment of

$ 1349 motivated the 1947 amendment, that motivation cuts
against them, given that $ 1349 affected only jurisdiction.

The legislative history of the 1947 amendment cuts against
them, as well, to the extent it points in any direction.13 Congress's revision of the charter was prompted by, and followed, the recommendations of a private advisory committee
of the Red Cross. See H. R. Rep. No. 337, 80th Cong., 1st
Sess., 6 (1947) ("[The 1947 amendment] was drafted as the
result of recommendations made by [the Advisory committee] . . . . [They] incorporat[e] the recommendations of th[at]
advisory committee . . ."); S. Rep. No. 38, 80th Cong., 1st
Sess., 1 (1947) ("The present legislation incorporates, in the
main, the recommendations of the [A]dvisory committee").
The Advisory Report had recommended that "[t]he charter
should make it clear that the Red Cross can sue and be sued
in the Federal Courts," reasoning that "[t]he Red Cross has
in several instances sued in the Federal Courts, and its powers in this respect have not been questioned. However, in
view of the limited nature of the jurisdiction of the Federal
Courts, it seems desirable that this right be clearly stated in
the Charter." Advisory Report 35-36, reprinted at App. to
Brief for Appellants in No. 90-1873, at 132-133.

13 The only debate on the 1947 amendment to the charter's "sue and be
sued" provision occurred at a Senate Committee hearing. See Hearings
on S. 591 before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, 80th Cong.,
1st Sess., 10 (1947). The only two relevant comments, both made by Senator George, appear to be mutually contradictory on the matter at issue
here. At one point Senator George said: "I think the purpose of the bill
is very clear, and that is to give the jurisdiction in State courts and Federal courts, and I think we had better leave it there," ibid. Later, however, he stated: "I think there might be some question about the right of
a Federal corporation to be sued in a State court. I thought that was,
and I still think it is, the purpose of this provision," id., at 11.

262 AMERICAN NAT. RED CROSS v. S. G.

Opinion of the Court
The Advisory Report's explicit concern with the limited
jurisdiction of the federal courts indicates that the recommended change, which prompted the amendment to the "sue
and be sued" provision, spoke to jurisdiction rather than
capacity to sue. Against this, respondents argue only that
the Advisory Report's use of the words "can" and "power"
indicate concern with the latter, not the former. See Brief
for Respondents 25. This is fine parsing, too fine to overcome the overall jurisdictional thrust of the Report's
recommendation.

In a final look toward the text, respondents speculate that
the 1947 amendment can be explained as an attempt to clarify the Red Cross's capacity to enter the federal courts under
their diversity jurisdiction. See Brief for Respondents 25-
26, 29. The argument turns on the theory that federally
chartered corporations are not citizens of any particular
State, and thus may not avail themselves of diversity jurisdiction. See id., at 26 (quoting Walton v. Howard University, 683 F. Supp. 826, 829 (DC 1987)). Respondents completely fail, however, to explain how the addition of the
words "State or Federal" to the "sue and be sued" provision
might address this claimed jurisdictional problem. Indeed,
the 1947 amendment, by specifying the particular courts
open to the Red Cross, as opposed to the Red Cross's status
as a party, seems particularly ill-suited to rectifying an asserted party-based jurisdictional deficiency.14

14 At oral argument respondents carried the suggestion a further step
by speculating that the 1947 amendment could be explained as an attempt
to ensure the Red Cross's access to federal courts when diversity jurisdiction existed, due to concern, presumably present until our 1949 decision in
National Mut. Ins. Co. v. Tidewater Transfer Co., 337 U. S. 582, about
the constitutionality of the 1940 statute giving District of Columbiachartered corporations the same rights to sue in diversity as statechartered corporations. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 30-31. But the speculation,
if sound, would prove too much. For on this theory Congress would have
been hedging against a constitutional problem of diversity jurisdiction by
resorting to a special grant of jurisdiction to cover the Red Cross, which is

Opinion of the Court
Perhaps most obviously, respondents' argument violatesthe ordinary sense of the language used, as well as some

basic canons of statutory construction. The 1905 charter,authorizing the Red Cross "to sue and be sued in courts of
law and equity within the jurisdiction of the United States,"simply cannot be read as failing to empower the Red Cross
to sue in federal courts having jurisdiction. That fact, whencombined with the Advisory Report's justification of the 1947
amendment by reference to federal courts' limited jurisdic-tion, see

supra, leaves it extremely doubtful that capacity tosue simpliciter motivated that amendment. Indeed, the

Red Cross's clear preamendment capacity to sue in federalcourts calls into play the canon of statutory construction requiring a change in language to be read, if possible, to havesome effect, see,

e. g., Brewster v. Gage, 280 U. S. 327, 337(1930); 2A N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction

$ 46.06 (5th rev. ed. 1992), a rule which here tugs hard towarda jurisdictional reading of the 1947 amendment.

15

exactly what the Red Cross maintains was intended by following D'Oench,
Duhme and Osborn.

Respondents complain that the Red Cross's theory is of recent vintage,
citing a 1951 case in which the Red Cross removed a suit against it from
state to federal court based not on any independent jurisdictional grant
implicit in the "sue and be sued" provision, but rather on party diversity.
See Brief for Respondents 29 (citing Patterson v. American National Red
Cross, 101 F. Supp. 655 (SD Fla. 1951)). However, the Red Cross's failure
in one 40-year-old case to base its removal petition on the theory it advances today adds nothing to respondents' attack on the Red Cross's current interpretation.

15 The dissent adopts and refines respondents' argument, see Brief for

Respondents 16, that the 1947 amendment's parallel treatment of federal
and state courts counsels against reading that amendment as conferring
jurisdiction, see post, at 267-268. The short answer is that D'Oench,
Duhme forecloses the argument, since the charter language we held to
confer federal jurisdiction in that case made exactly the same parallel
mention of federal and state courts. But going beyond that, the reference
to state as well as federal courts presumably was included lest a mention
of federal courts alone (in order to grant jurisdiction to them) be taken as
motivated by an intent to confer exclusive federal jurisdiction. Moreover,
the Red Cross Charter's "sue and be sued" provision, like its counterparts

Opinion of the Court

V
Our holding leaves the jurisdiction of the federal courtswell within Article III's limits. As long ago as

Osborn, thisCourt held that Article III's "arising under" jurisdiction is

broad enough to authorize Congress to confer federal-courtjurisdiction over actions involving federally chartered corporations. See 9 Wheat., at 823-828.16 We have consistentlyreaffirmed the breadth of that holding. See Pacific R. Removal Cases, 115 U. S., at 11-14; In re Dunn, 212 U. S. 374,383-384 (1909);

Bankers Trust, 241 U. S., at 305-306; Puerto

construed in Osborn and D'Oench, Duhme, confers both capacity to sue
and jurisdiction. While capacity to sue in both federal and state courts
was already clearly established before the 1947 amendment, it may have
been feared that the addition of the word "Federal" to confer federal jurisdiction would be misread to limit the Red Cross's capacity to sue in state
courts, if it were not reaffirmed by explicit inclusion of the word "State."

It is the dissent's conclusion that the 1947 amendment was meant to
"eliminat[e] the possibility that the language `courts of law and equity
within the jurisdiction of the United States' that was contained in the
original charter might be read to limit the grant of capacity to sue in
federal court," post, at 275 (emphasis and citation omitted); that is difficult
to justify. Such a motivation is nowhere even hinted at in the Advisory
Report, the document both Houses of Congress acknowledged as the
source for the amendment, see supra, at 261 (quoting congressional reports); indeed, the relevant part of the Advisory Report does not even
mention state courts, see Advisory Report 35-36, reprinted at App. to
Brief for Appellants in No. 90-1873, at 132-133. It is hardly a "reasonable
construction," post, at 275, of the amendment to view it as granting something the Advisory Report never requested. While the dissent notes one
of Senator George's comments supporting its hypothesis, it ignores the
other, which explicitly notes a federal jurisdiction-conferring motivation
behind the amendment. See supra, at 261, n. 13.

Neither party reads the 1947 amendment to clarify the Red Cross's capacity to sue in state courts, and, as there is no evidence of such an intent,
we do not embrace that reading here.

16 Again, it should be pointed out that statutory jurisdiction in this case

is not based on the Red Cross's federal incorporation, but rather upon
a specific statutory grant. In contrast, the constitutional question asks
whether Article III's provision for federal jurisdiction over cases "arising
under federal law" is sufficiently broad to allow that grant.

Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice
O'Connor, and Justice Kennedy join, dissenting.

The Court today concludes that whenever a statute grant-ing a federally chartered corporation the "power to sue and

be sued" specifically mentions the federal courts (as opposedto merely embracing them within general language), the law
will be deemed not only to confer on the corporation thecapacity to bring and suffer suit (which is all that the words
say), but also to confer on federal district courts jurisdictionover any and all controversies to which that corporation is
a party. This wonderland of linguistic confusion--in whichwords are sometimes read to mean only what they say and
other times read also to mean what they do not say--is basedon the erroneous premise that our cases in this area establish
a "magic words" jurisprudence that departs from ordinaryrules of English usage. In fact, our cases simply reflect the
fact that the natural reading of some "sue and be sued"clauses is that they confer both capacity and jurisdiction.
Since the natural reading of the Red Cross Charter is thatit confers only capacity, I respectfully dissent.

I
Section 2 of the Red Cross Charter, 36 U. S. C. $ 2, setsforth the various powers of the corporation, such as the

power "to have and to hold . . . real and personal estate";"to adopt a seal"; "to ordain and establish bylaws and

regulations"; and to "do all such acts and things as may benecessary to . . . promote [its] purposes."

1 The second

item on this list is "the power to sue and be sued in courtsof law and equity, State or Federal, within the jurisdiction

of the United States." Ibid. The presence of this languageamidst a list of more or less ordinary corporate powers confirms what the words themselves suggest: It merely estab-lishes that the Red Cross is a juridical person which may be
party to a lawsuit in an American court, and that the RedCross--despite its status as a federally chartered corporation--does not share the Government's general immunityfrom suit. Cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 17(b) ("The capacity of a
corporation to sue or be sued shall be determined by the lawunder which it was organized"); 4 Thompson on Corporations

1 Section 2, as amended, provides in its entirety:
"The name of this corporation shall be `The American National Red
Cross', and by that name it shall have perpetual succession, with the
power to sue and be sued in courts of law and equity, State or Federal,
within the jurisdiction of the United States; to have and to hold such real
and personal estate as shall be deemed advisable and to dispose of the
same, to accept gifts, devises, and bequests of real and personal estate for
the purposes of this corporation hereinafter set forth; to adopt a seal and
the same to alter and destroy at pleasure; and to have the right to have
and to use, in carrying out its purposes hereinafter designated, as an emblem and badge, a Greek red cross on a white ground, as the same has
been described in the treaties of Geneva, August twenty-second, eighteen
hundred and sixty-four and July twenty-seventh, nineteen hundred and

of the United States of America or any State thereof, and generally to do
all such acts and things as may be necessary to carry into effect the provisions of sections 1, 2 to 6, 8, and 9 of this title and promote the purposes
of said organization; and the corporation created is designated as the organization which is authorized to act in matters of relief under said treaties.
In accordance with the said treaties, the delivery of the brassard allowed

$ 3161, p. 975 (3d ed. 1927) ("[The power to sue and be sued]is expressly conferred in practically every incorporating

act"); Loeffler v. Frank, 486 U. S. 549, 554-557 (1988) ("sueand be sued" clause waives sovereign immunity).

It is beyond question that nothing in the language of this
provision suggests that it has anything to do with regulatingthe jurisdiction of the federal courts. The grant of corporate power to sue and be sued in no way implies a grant offederal-court jurisdiction; it merely places the corporation on
the same footing as a natural person, who must look else-where to establish grounds for getting his case into court.
Words conferring authority upon a corporation are a most
illogical means of conferring jurisdiction upon a court, and
would not normally be understood that way. Moreover, it
would be extraordinary to confer a new subject-matter jurisdiction upon "federal courts" in general, rather than upon a
particular federal court or courts.

The Court apparently believes, see ante, at 256, n. 8, that
the language of $ 2 is functionally equivalent to a specific
reference to the district courts, since no other court could
reasonably have been intended to be the recipient of the
jurisdictional grant. Perhaps so, but applying that intuition
requires such a random butchering of the text that it is much
more reasonable to assume that no court was the intended
recipient. The Red Cross is clearly granted the capacity to
sue and be sued in all federal courts, so that it could appear,
for example, as a party in a third-party action in the Court
of International Trade, see 28 U. S. C. $ 1583, and in an action
before the United States Claims Court, see Claims Court
Rule 14(a) (Mar. 15, 1991). There is simply no textual basis,
and no legal basis except legal intuition, for saying that it
must in addition establish an independent basis of jurisdiction to proceed in those courts, though it does not in the
district courts.

In fact, the language of this provision not only does not
distinguish among federal courts, it also does not treat fed505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:03 PAGES OPINPGT
268 AMERICAN NAT. RED CROSS v. S. G.

Scalia, J., dissenting
eral courts differently from state courts; the Red Cross isgranted the "power" to sue in both. This parallel treatment

of state and federal courts even further undermines a juris-dictional reading of the statute, since the provision cannot
reasonably be read as allowing the Red Cross to enter astate court without establishing the independent basis of
jurisdiction appropriate under state law. Such a readingwould present serious constitutional questions. Cf.

Brownv. Gerdes, 321 U. S. 178, 188 (1944) (Frankfurter, J., concurring); Howlett v. Rose, 496 U. S. 356, 372 (1990); Herb v. Pit-cairn, 324 U. S. 117, 120-121 (1945); Minneapolis & St. Louis
R. Co. v. Bombolis, 241 U. S. 211, 222-223 (1916); but cf. San-dalow, Henry v. Mississippi and the Adequate State Ground:
Proposals for a Revised Doctrine, 1965 S. Ct. Rev. 187, 207,n. 84. Since the language of the Red Cross Charter cannot
fairly be read to create federal jurisdiction but not state ju-risdiction, we should not construe it as creating either.

Ed-ward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. NLRB, 463 U. S. 147, 157 (1983);

NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U. S. 490, 500-501 (1979).

I therefore conclude--indeed, I do not think it seriouslycontestable--that the natural reading of the "sue and be
sued" clause of 36 U. S. C. $ 2 confers upon the Red Crossonly the

capacity to "sue and be sued" in state and federalcourts; it does not confer jurisdiction upon any court, state

or federal. II

I do not understand the Court to disagree with my analy-sis of the ordinary meaning of the statutory language. Its
theory is that, regardless of ordinary meaning, our caseshave created what might be termed a "phrase of art,"
whereby a "sue and be sued" clause confers federal jurisdic-tion "if, but only if, it specifically mentions the federal
courts." Ante, at 255. Thus, while the uninitiated wouldconsider the phrase "sue and be sued in any court in the
United States" to mean the same thing as "sue and be sued

in any court, state or federal," the Court believes that ourcases have established the latter (but not the former) as a

shorthand for "sue and be sued in any court, state or federal,
and the federal district courts shall have jurisdiction over
any such action." Congress is assumed to have used this
cleverly crafted code in enacting the charter provision atissue here.

Ante, at 251-252. In my view, our cases do
not establish the cryptology the Court attributes to them.Rather, the four prior cases in which we have considered the

jurisdictional implications of "sue and be sued" clauses arebest understood as simply applications of conventional rules
of statutory construction.

In Bank of the United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61
(1809), we held that a provision of the Act establishing the
first Bank of the United States which stated that the Bank
was "made able and capable in law . . . to sue and be sued
. . . in courts of record, or any other place whatsoever,"
1 Stat. 192, did not confer jurisdiction on the federal courts
to adjudicate suits brought by the Bank. Construing the
statutory terms in accordance with their ordinary meaning,
we concluded (as I conclude with respect to the Red Cross
Charter) that the provision merely gave "a capacity to the
corporation to appear, as a corporation, in any court which
would, by law, have cognisance of the cause, if brought by
individuals." 5 Cranch, at 85-86 (emphasis added). We expressly noted (as I have in this case) that the Act's undifferentiated mention of all courts compelled the conclusion that
the provision was not jurisdictional: "If jurisdiction is given
by this clause to the federal courts, it is equally given to all
courts having original jurisdiction, and for all sums however small they may be." Id., at 86 (emphasis added). That
statement is immediately followed by contrasting this provision with another section of the Act which provided that certain actions against the directors of the Bank "may . . . be
brought . . . in any court of record of the United States, or
of either of them." 1 Stat. 194. That provision, we said,

505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:03 PAGES OPINPGT
270 AMERICAN NAT. RED CROSS v. S. G.

Scalia, J., dissenting
"expressly authorizes the bringing of that action in the fed-eral or state courts," which "evinces the opinion of congress,

that the right to sue does not imply a right to sue in thecourts of the union, unless it be expressed." 5 Cranch, at
86. It is clear, I think, that the reason the Court thoughtthe right to have been "expressed" under the directors-suit
provision, but not "expressed" under the provision before it,was

not that the former happened to mention courts "of theUnited States." For that would have provided no contrast

to the argument against jurisdiction (italicized above) thatthe Court had just made. Reference to suits "in any court
of record of the United States, or of either of them," is noless universal in its operative scope than reference to suits
"in courts of record," and hence is subject to the same objec-tion (to which the Court was presumably giving a contrasting example) that jurisdiction was indiscriminately conferredon all courts of original jurisdiction and for any and all
amounts.

Deveaux establishes not, as the Court claims, the weirdprinciple that mention of the federal courts

in a "sue and besued" clause confers jurisdiction; but rather, the quite different (and quite reasonable) proposition that mention of thefederal courts in a provision allowing a particular cause of
action to be brought does so. The contrast between the "sueand be sued" clause and the provision authorizing certain
suits against the directors lay, not in the mere substitutionof one broad phrase for another, but in the fact that the latter
provision, by authorizing particular actions to be brought infederal court, could not reasonably be read

not to confer ju-risdiction. A provision merely conferring a general capacity to bring actions, however, cannot reasonably be read toconfer jurisdiction.

2 The Court believes that Deveaux's statement that "the right to sue
does not imply the right to sue in the courts of the union unless it be
expressed," Bank of United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61, 86 (1809)
(emphasis added), is somehow inconsistent with my analysis. Ante, at

Scalia, J., dissenting
This reading of Deveaux is fully consistent with our subse-quent decision in Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat.

738 (1824), which construed the "sue and be sued" clause ofthe second Bank's charter as conferring jurisdiction on federal circuit courts. The second charter provided that theBank was "made able and capable, in law . . . to sue and be
sued . . . in all state courts having competent jurisdiction,and in any circuit court of the United States," 3 Stat. 269.
By granting the Bank power to sue, not in all courts gener-ally (as in

Deveaux), but in particular federal courts, thissuggested a grant of jurisdiction rather than merely of capacity to sue. And that suggestion was strongly confirmed bythe fact that the Bank was empowered to sue in state courts
"having competent jurisdiction," but in federal circuit courts
simpliciter. If the statute had jurisdiction in mind as to theone, it must as to the other as well. Our opinion in Osborn

did not invoke the "magic words" approach adopted by theCourt today, but concluded that the charter language "admit[ted] of but one interpretation" and could not "be madeplainer by explanation." 9 Wheat., at 817.

In distinguishing Deveaux, Osborn noted, and apparentlymisunderstood as the Court today does, that case's contrast
between the "express grant of jurisdiction to the federalcourts" over suits against directors and the "general words"
of the "sue and be sued" clause, "which [did] not mentionthose courts." 9 Wheat., at 818. All it concluded from that,
however, was that Deveaux established that "a general ca-pacity in the bank to sue, without mentioning the courts of
the Union, may not give a right to sue in those courts." 9Wheat., at 818. There does not logically follow from that
the rule which the Court announces today: that any grant ofa general capacity to sue with mention of federal courts will

255, n. 6. Quite the opposite is true: The Court's simple statement that
the grant of jurisdiction must "be expressed" is obviously a call, not to
reach for the cryptograph, but to discern the plain meaning of the statutory language.

suffice to confer jurisdiction. The Court's reading of thislanguage from Osborn as giving talismanic significance to

any "mention" of federal courts is simply inconsistent withthe fact that Osborn (like Deveaux) did not purport to confer
on the words of the clause any meaning other than that sug-gested by their natural import.

This reading of Deveaux and Osborn is confirmed by ourlater decision in

Bankers Trust Co. v. Texas & Pacific R. Co.,241 U. S. 295 (1916). There we held it to be "plain" that a

railroad charter provision stating that the corporation "shallbe able to sue and be sued . . . in all courts of law and equity
within the United States," 16 Stat. 574, did not confer juris-diction on any court. 241 U. S., at 303. Had our earlier
cases stood for the "magic words" rule adopted by the Courttoday, we could have reached that conclusion simply by noting that the clause at issue did not contain a specific refer-ence to the federal courts. That is not, however, what we
did. Indeed, the absence of such specific reference was not
even mentioned in the opinion. See id., at 303-305. In-stead, as before, we sought to determine the sense of the

provision by considering the ordinary meaning of its lan-guage in context. We concluded that "Congress would have
expressed [a] purpose [to confer jurisdiction] in altogetherdifferent words" than these,

id., at 303, which had "the samegenerality and natural import as did those in the earlier

bank act [in Deveaux]," id., at 304 (emphasis added). Consid-ered in their context of a listing of corporate powers, these
words established that

"Congress was not then concerned with the jurisdictionof courts but with the faculties and powers of the corporation which it was creating; and evidently all that wasintended was to render this corporation capable of suing
and being sued by its corporate name in any court oflaw or equity--Federal, state, or territorial--whose
jurisdiction as otherwise competently defined was ad-equate to the occasion." Id., at 303 (emphasis added).

That paraphrasing of the railroad charter, in terms thatwould spell jurisdiction under the key the Court adopts

today, belies any notion that Bankers Trust was using thesame code book.

The fourth and final case relied upon by the Court isD'Oench, Duhme & Co. v. FDIC, 315 U. S. 447 (1942). In

that case, we granted certiorari to consider whether a fed-eral court in a nondiversity action must apply the conflict-oflaws rules of the forum State. We ultimately did not ad-dress that question (because we concluded that the rule of
decision was provided by federal, rather than state, law, see
id., at 456), but in the course of setting forth the questionpresented, we noted that, as all parties had conceded, the

jurisdiction of the federal district court did not rest ondiversity:

"Respondent, a federal corporation, brings this suitunder an Act of Congress authorizing it to sue or be
sued `in any court of law or equity, State or Federal.'Sec. 12 B, Federal Reserve Act; 12 U. S. C. $ 264( j).

"2 That subdivision of the Act further provides: `All suits of a civil
nature at common law or in equity to which the Corporation shall
be a party shall be deemed to arise under the laws of the United
States . . . .' "

Id., at 455-456.

The Court relies heavily on this case, which it views asholding that a statute granting a corporation the power " `to

sue or be sued "in any court of law or equity, State or Fed-eral" ' " establishes jurisdiction in federal district courts.
Ante, at 254-255. Even if the quoted language did say that,

3 The Court's protest, ante, at 257, n. 9, that its interpretive rule should
not be applied to Bankers Trust's paraphrase of the railroad charter at
issue in that case is a frank confession that that rule has no relation to
ordinary principles for discerning meaning in the English language--i. e.,
it has no relation to the very principles that we have consistently purported to apply in this area.

it would be remarkable to attribute such great significanceto a passing comment on a conceded point. But in my view

it does not say that anyway, since the footnote must be readtogether with the text as explaining the single basis of jurisdiction (rather than, as the Court would have it, explainingtwo separate bases of jurisdiction in a case where even the
explanation of one is obiter). The language quoted in thefootnote is not, as the Court says, from "another part of the

1941, No. 206, p. 3. The language in this case is a thin reedupon which to rest abandonment of the rudimentary principle (followed even in other "sue and be sued" cases) that astatute should be given the meaning suggested by the "natural import" of its terms. Bankers Trust, supra, at 304.

Finally, the Court argues that a jurisdictional reading ofthe Red Cross Charter is required by the canon of construction that an amendment to a statute ordinarily should not beread as having no effect. Ante, at 263. The original "sue
and be sued" clause in the Red Cross Charter did not containthe phrase "State or Federal," and the Court argues that
its reading--which gives decisive weight to that addition--is therefore strongly to be preferred. Ibid. I do not agree.
Even if it were the case that my reading of the clause ren-dered this phrase superfluous, I would consider that a small
price to pay for adhering to the competing (and more impor-tant) canon that statutory language should be construed in
accordance with its ordinary meaning. And it would seemparticularly appropriate to run the risk of surplusage here,
since the amendment in question was one of a number of

technical changes in a comprehensive revision. Ch. 50, $ 3,
61 Stat. 80, 81 (1947).

But in any event, a natural-meaning construction of the
"sue and be sued" clause does not render the 1947 amendment superfluous. The addition of the words "State or Federal" eliminates the possibility that the language "courts of
law and equity within the jurisdiction of the United States"
that was contained in the original charter, see ch. 23, $ 2, 33
Stat. 600 (emphasis added), might be read to limit the grant
of capacity to sue in federal court. State courts are not
within the "jurisdiction" of the United States unless "jurisdiction" is taken in the relatively rare sense of referring to
territory rather than power. The addition of the words
"State or Federal" removes this ambiguity.

The Court rejects this argument on the ground that there
is "no evidence of such an intent." Ante, at 264, n. 15. The
best answer to that assertion is that it is irrelevant: To satisfy the canon the Court has invoked, it is enough that there
be a reasonable construction of the old and amended statutes
that would explain why the amendment is not superfluous.
Another answer to the assertion is that it is wrong. As the
Court notes elsewhere in its opinion, ante, at 261, n. 13, one
of the only comments made by a Member of Congress on
this amendment was Senator George's statement, during the
hearings, that the purpose of the provision was to confirm
the Red Cross' capacity to sue in state court. See Hearings
on S. 591 before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations,
80th Cong., 1st Sess., 11 (1947).4

4 The Court points out that Senator George also stated, in response to a
question whether foreign courts should be covered by the amendment,
that the purpose of the bill was " `to give the jurisdiction in State courts
and Federal courts, and I think we had better leave it there.' " Ante, at
261, n. 13. Rather than concluding (as seems obvious) that Senator George
was speaking with imprecision in using the phrase "give the jurisdiction,"
the Court draws the far less likely conclusion that Senator George was
flatly contradicting himself in what he said only a few minutes later. Ibid.

Because the Red Cross Charter contains no language sug-gesting a grant of jurisdiction, I conclude that it grants only

WRIGHT, WARDEN, et al. v. WEST
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 91-542. Argued March 24, 1992--Decided June 19, 1992
A few weeks after a Virginia home was burglarized, over 15 of the missing

items were recovered from respondent West's home. At his trial on
grand larceny charges, he admitted to a prior felony conviction, but denied having stolen the items, explaining that he frequently bought and
sold merchandise at different flea markets. He offered no explanation
for how he had acquired any of the stolen items until cross-examination,
when he gave vague, evasive, and even contradictory answers; could not
remember how he acquired several major items, including a television
set and a coffee table; and failed to produce any evidence corroborating
his story. West was convicted. The State Supreme Court affirmed the
conviction and denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, both times
rejecting, inter alia, West's contention that the evidence was insufficient
to support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. On federal
habeas, the District Court also rejected that contention. The Court of
Appeals reversed on the ground that the standard of Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 319--that evidence is sufficient to support a conviction as a matter of due process if, "after viewing the evidence in the
light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could
have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable
doubt"--had not been met.

Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
931 F. 2d 262, reversed and remanded.

Justice Thomas, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia,
concluded that regardless of whether a federal habeas court should review state-court applications of law to fact deferentially or de novo,
the trial record contains more than enough evidence to support West's
conviction. Jackson repeatedly emphasizes the deference owed the
trier of fact and the sharply limited nature of constitutional sufficiency
review. The case against West was strong. The jury was entitled
to disbelieve his uncorroborated and confused testimony, discount his
credibility on account of his prior felony conviction, and take his demeanor into account. The jury was also permitted to consider what it
concluded to be perjured testimony as affirmative evidence of guilt.
Pp. 295-297.

Syllabus
Justice White concluded that there was enough evidence to support
West's conviction under the Jackson standard. P. 297.

Justice O'Connor, joined by Justice Blackmun and Justice Stevens, concluded that the evidence supported West's conviction and that
there was no need to decide the standard of review issue to decide this
case. Pp. 297, 305-306.

Justice Kennedy concluded that the evidence was sufficient to convince a rational factfinder of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and that
Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, should not be interpreted as calling into
question the settled principle that mixed questions are subject to de
novo review on federal habeas corpus. Pp. 306-310.

Justice Souter concluded that West sought the benefit of a "new
rule," and thus his claim was barred by Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288.
The Court of Appeals misapplied Teague's commands, since, while the
Jackson rule was "old" enough to have predated the finality of West's
conviction, it was not specific enough to dictate the rule on which the
conviction was held unlawful. Although the State Supreme Court was
not entitled to disregard Jackson, it does not follow from Jackson's rule
that the insufficiency of the evidence to support West's conviction was
apparent. Virginia has long recognized a rule that evidence of falsely
explained possession of recently stolen property is sufficient to sustain
a finding that the possessor took the goods, and the jury's rejection
of West's explanation implies a finding that his explanation was false.
Virginia's rule is reasonable and has been accepted as good law against
the backdrop of a general state sufficiency standard no less stringent
than the Jackson rule. Thus, it is not possible to say that reasonable
jurists could not have considered Virginia's rule compatible with the
Jackson standard. Pp. 310-316.

280 WRIGHT v. WEST

Opinion of Thomas, J.
Justice Thomas announced the judgment of the Courtand delivered an opinion, in which

The Chief Justice and
Justice Scalia joined.

In this case, we must determine whether the Court of Ap-peals for the Fourth Circuit correctly applied our decision in

Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979), in concluding thatthe evidence against respondent Frank West was insufficient,
as a matter of due process, to support his state-court convic-tion for grand larceny.

I
Between December 13 and December 26, 1978, someonebroke into the Westmoreland County, Virginia, home of Angelo Cardova and stole items valued at approximately $3,500.On January 10, 1979, police conducted a lawful search of the
Gloucester County, Virginia, home of West and his wife.They discovered several of the items stolen from the Cardova home, including various electronic equipment (two tele-vision sets and a record player); articles of clothing (an imitation mink coat with the name "Esther" embroidered in it, asilk jacket emblazoned "Korea 1970," and a pair of shoes);
decorations (several wood carvings and a mounted lobster);and miscellaneous household objects (a mirror framed with
seashells, a coffee table, a bar, a sleeping bag, and some sil-verware). These items were valued at approximately $800,
and the police recovered other, unspecified items of Cardo-va's property with an approximate value of $300.

West was charged with grand larceny. Testifying at trialon his own behalf, he admitted to a prior felony conviction,
but denied having taken anything from Cardova's house.

Opinion of Thomas, J.
He explained that he had bought and sold "a lot of . . . merchandise" from "several guys" at "flea bargain places" where,
according to West, "a lot of times you buy things . . . that are
stolen" although "you never know it." App. 21. On crossexamination, West said that he had bought many of the stolen items from a Ronnie Elkins, whom West claimed to have
known for years. West testified that he purchased one of
the wood carvings, the jacket, mounted lobster, mirror, and
bar from Elkins for about $500. West initially guessed, and
then twice positively asserted, that this sale occurred before
January 1, 1979. In addition, West claimed to have purchased the coat from Elkins for $5 around January 1, 1979.
His testimony did not make clear whether he was describing
one transaction or two, whether there were any other transactions between himself and Elkins, where the transactions
occurred, and whether the transactions occurred at flea markets.1 West testified further that he had purchased one of

"Q Are those items that you bought at a flea market?
"A Well, I didn't buy these items at a flea market, no sir.
"Q Whose items are they?
"A They are some items that I got from a Ronnie Elkins.
"Q All of the items you bought from him?
"A I can't say all.
"Q Which ones did you buy from him?
"A I can't say, because I don't have an inventory.
"Q Can you tell me the ones you bought from Ronnie Elkins?
"A Yes, I am sure I can.
"Q Which ones?
"A I would say the platter.
"Q How about the sea shell mirror?
"A Yes, sir, I think so.
"Q Where did you buy that?
"A In Newport News at a flea market." App. 21-22.
"Q I want to know about your business transactions with Ronnie
Elkins.

the television sets in an entirely separate transaction inGoochland County, from an individual whose name he had

forgotten. Finally, West testified that he did not rememberhow he had acquired the second television, the coffee table,
and the silverware.

Under then-applicable Virginia law, grand larceny was de-fined as the wrongful and nonconsensual taking of property

worth at least $100, with the intent to deprive the owner ofit permanently. See Va. Code Ann. $ 18.2-95 (1975);

Skeeter
v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 722, 725, 232 S. E. 2d 756, 758(1977). Virginia law permits an inference that a person who

fails to explain, or falsely explains, his exclusive possessionof recently stolen property is the thief. See,

e. g., Moehring
v. Commonwealth, 223 Va. 564, 568, 290 S. E. 2d 891, 893
(1982); Best v. Commonwealth, 222 Va. 387, 389, 282 S. E. 2d16, 17 (1981). The trial court instructed the jurors about

this permissive inference, but warned that the inference did
not compromise their constitutional obligation to acquit unless they found that the State had established every element

markets.

around January 1, and these items, not the other items.

"Q Tell the jury, if you will, where Ronnie Elkins was on the day that
you bought the items?

News." Id., at 26-27.

of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. See In re Winship,397 U. S. 358 (1970).

2

The jury returned a guilty verdict, and West receiveda 10-year prison sentence. West petitioned for an appeal,

contending (among other things) that the evidence was insuf-ficient to support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt. In May 1980, the Supreme Court of Virginia refused
the petition--a disposition indicating that the court foundthe petition without merit, see

Saunders v. Reynolds, 214
Va. 697, 700, 204 S. E. 2d 421, 424 (1974). Seven years later,West filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the same

court, supported by an affidavit executed by Ronnie Elkinsin April 1987. West renewed his claim that the original trial
record contained insufficient evidence to support the conviction, and he argued in the alternative that Elkins' affidavit,
which tended to corroborate West's trial testimony in certain
respects, constituted new evidence entitling him to a new
trial. The Supreme Court of Virginia again denied relief.
West then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the
District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, which
rejected both claims and denied relief.

The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed.
931 F. 2d 262 (1991). As the court correctly recognized, a

2 The instruction on the permissive inference read:
"If you belie[ve] from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that property of a value of $100.00 or more was stolen from Angelo F. C[a]rdova,
and that it was recently thereafter found in the exclusive and personal
possession of the defendant, and that such possession has been unexplained or falsely denied by the defendant, then such possession is sufficient to raise an inference that the defendant was the thief; and if such
inference, taking into consideration the whole evidence, leads you to believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the theft,
then you shall find the defendant guilty." App. 34.

Several other instructions emphasized that despite the permissive inference, "[t]he burden is upon the Commonwealth to prove by the evidence
beyond a reasonable doubt every material and necessary element of the
offense charged against the defendant." Ibid.

claim that evidence is insufficient to support a conviction asa matter of due process depends on "whether, after viewing

the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,
any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt." Jackson
v. Virginia, 443 U. S., at 319 (emphasis in original). Fiveconsiderations led the court to conclude that this standard

was not met: first, the items were recovered no sooner thantwo weeks after they had been stolen; second, only about a
third of the items stolen from Cardova (measured by value)were recovered from West; third, the items were found in
West's house in plain view, and not hidden away as contraband; fourth, West's explanation of his possession was not so
"inherently implausible," even if it were disbelieved, that it
could "fairly be treated as positive evidence of guilt"; and
fifth, there was no corroborating evidence (such as fingerprints or eyewitness testimony) beyond the fact of mere
possession. See 931 F. 2d, at 268-270. The court viewed
West's testimony as "at most, a neutral factor," id., at 270,
despite noting his "confusion" about the details of his alleged
purchases, id., at 269, and despite conceding that his testimony "at first blush . . . may itself seem incredible," id., at
270, n. 7. In holding that the Jackson standard was not met,
the court did not take into consideration the fact that the
Supreme Court of Virginia had twice previously concluded
otherwise.

After the Fourth Circuit denied rehearing en banc by an
equally divided court, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 34-35, the
warden and the State Attorney General sought review in
this Court on, among other questions, whether the Court
of Appeals had applied Jackson correctly in this case. We
granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 1012 (1991), and requested additional briefing on the question whether a federal habeas
court should afford deference to state-court determinations
applying law to the specific facts of a case, 502 U. S. 1021
(1991). We now reverse.

Opinion of Thomas, J.

II
The habeas corpus statute permits a federal court to entertain a petition from a state prisoner "only on the ground
that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws
or treaties of the United States." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(a). The
court must "dispose of the matter as law and justice require."

$ 2243. For much of our history, we interpreted these bare
guidelines and their predecessors to reflect the common-law
principle that a prisoner seeking a writ of habeas corpus
could challenge only the jurisdiction of the court that had
rendered the judgment under which he was in custody. See,
e. g., In re Wood, 140 U. S. 278, 285-287 (1891) (Harlan, J.);
Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 193, 202 (1830) (Marshall, C. J.).
Gradually, we began to expand the category of claims
deemed to be jurisdictional for habeas purposes. See, e. g.,
Ex parte Siebold, 100 U. S. 371, 377 (1880) (court without
jurisdiction to impose sentence under unconstitutional statute); Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 176 (1874) (court without
jurisdiction to impose sentence not authorized by statute).
Next, we began to recognize federal claims by state prisoners if no state court had provided a full and fair opportunity
to litigate those claims. See, e. g., Moore v. Dempsey, 261
U. S. 86, 91-92 (1923); Frank v. Mangum, 237 U. S. 309, 335-
336 (1915). Before 1953, however, the inverse of this rule
also remained true: Absent an alleged jurisdictional defect,
"habeas corpus would not lie for a [state] prisoner . . . if he
had been given an adequate opportunity to obtain full and
fair consideration of his federal claim in the state courts."
Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 459-460 (1963) (Harlan, J., dissenting). See generally Bator, Finality in Criminal Law and
Federal Habeas Corpus for State Prisoners, 76 Harv. L. Rev.
441, 478-499 (1963). In other words, the state-court judgment was entitled to "absolute respect," Kuhlmann v. Wil505us1102N 04-22-99 17:32:46 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Thomas, J.
son, 477 U. S. 436, 446 (1986) (opinion of Powell, J.) (emphasis
added), and a federal habeas court could not review it even
for reasonableness.3

3 Justice O'Connor offers three criticisms of our summary of the history of habeas corpus before 1953, none of which we find convincing.
First, she contends that the full-and-fair litigation standard in Frank v.
Mangum, 237 U. S. 309 (1915), and Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U. S. 86 (1923),
served no purpose other than to define the scope of the underlying alleged
constitutional violation. See post, at 297-299. Frank and Moore involved claims, rejected by the state appellate courts, that a trial had been
so dominated by a mob as to violate due process. In Frank, we denied
relief not because the state appellate court had decided the federal claim
correctly (the relevant question on direct review), and not even because
the state appellate court had decided the federal claim reasonably, but
only "because Frank's federal claims had been considered by a competent
and unbiased state tribunal," Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 476 (1976).
In Moore, which reaffirmed Frank expressly, see 261 U. S., at 90-91, we
ordered the District Court to consider the mob domination claim on the
merits because the state appellate court's "perfunctory treatment" of it
"was not in fact acceptable corrective process." Noia, 372 U. S., at 458
(Harlan, J., dissenting); see also Bator, 76 Harv. L. Rev., at 488-489. In
both cases, a claim that the habeas petitioner had been denied due process
at trial was not cognizable on habeas unless the petitioner also had been
denied a full and fair opportunity to raise that claim on appeal.

Second, Justice O'Connor states that we mischaracterize the views of
Justice Powell about the history of habeas law between 1915 and 1953.
See post, at 299. In fact, however, Justice Powell has often recounted
exactly the same familiar history that we summarize above. In Rose v.
Mitchell, 443 U. S. 545 (1979), for example, he described Frank as having
"modestly expanded" the "scope of the writ" in order to "encompass those
cases where the defendant's federal constitutional claims had not been considered in the state-court proceeding." 443 U. S., at 580 (opinion concurring in judgment). Similarly, in Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U. S. 218
(1973), he described Frank as having extended "[t]he scope of federal habeas corpus" to permit consideration of "whether the applicant had been
given an adequate opportunity in state court to raise his constitutional
claims." 412 U. S., at 255-256 (concurring opinion). In neither case, nor
in Kuhlmann, did Justice Powell even suggest that federal habeas was
available before 1953 to a prisoner who had received a full and fair opportunity to litigate his federal claim in state court.

Third, Justice O'Connor criticizes our failure to acknowledge Salinger
v. Loisel, 265 U. S. 224 (1924), which she describes as the first case ex505us1102N 04-22-99 17:32:46 PAGES OPINPGT

287Cite as: 505 U. S. 277 (1992)
Opinion of Thomas, J.
We rejected the principle of absolute deference in our
landmark decision in Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443 (1953).
There, we held that a state-court judgment of conviction "is
not res judicata" on federal habeas with respect to federal
constitutional claims, id., at 458, even if the state court has
rejected all such claims after a full and fair hearing. Instead, we held, a district court must determine whether
the state-court adjudication "has resulted in a satisfactory
conclusion." Id., at 463. We had no occasion to explore in
detail the question whether a "satisfactory" conclusion was
one that the habeas court considered correct, as opposed to
merely reasonable, because we concluded that the constitutional claims advanced in Brown itself would fail even if the
state courts' rejection of them were reconsidered de novo.
See id., at 465-476. Nonetheless, we indicated that the federal courts enjoy at least the discretion to take into consideration the fact that a state court has previously rejected the
federal claims asserted on habeas. See id., at 465 ("As the
state and federal courts have the same responsibilities to
protect persons from violation of their constitutional rights,
we conclude that a federal district court may decline, without
a rehearing of the facts, to award a writ of habeas corpus to a
state prisoner where the legality of such detention has been

plicitly to hold that "res judicata is not strictly followed on federal habeas." Post, at 299. Salinger, however, involved the degree of preclusive effect of a habeas judgment upon subsequent habeas petitions filed by
a federal prisoner. This case, of course, involves the degree of preclusive
effect of a criminal conviction upon an initial habeas petition filed by a
state prisoner. We cannot fault ourselves for limiting our focus to the
latter context. But even assuming its relevance, Salinger hardly advances the position advocated by Justice O'Connor that a habeas court
must exercise de novo review with respect to mixed questions of law and
fact. Despite acknowledging that a prior habeas judgment is not entitled
to absolute preclusive effect under the doctrine of res judicata, Salinger
also indicated that the prior habeas judgment "may be considered, and
even given controlling weight." 265 U. S., at 231 (emphasis added).

determined, on the facts presented, by the highest statecourt with jurisdiction").

4

In an influential separate opinion endorsed by a majorityof the Court, Justice Frankfurter also rejected the principle

of absolute deference to fairly litigated state-court judg-ments. He emphasized that a state-court determination of
federal constitutional law is not "binding" on federal habeas,
id., at 506, regardless of whether the determination involvesa pure question of law, ibid., or a "so-called mixed questio[n]"

requiring the application of law to fact, id., at 507. Nonethe-less, he stated quite explicitly that a "prior State determination may guide [the] discretion [of the district court] in decid-ing upon the appropriate course to be followed in disposing of
the application." Id., at 500. Discussing mixed questionsspecifically, he noted further that "there is no need for the
federal judge, if he could, to shut his eyes to the State consid-eration."

Id., at 508.5

4 Justice O'Connor contends that the inclusion of this passage in a
section of our opinion entitled "Right to a Plenary Hearing" makes clear
that we were discussing only the resolution of factual questions. See
post, at 300-301. In our introduction to that section, however, we indicated that both factual and legal questions were at issue. See 344 U. S.,
at 460 (noting contentions "that the District Court committed error when
it took no evidence and heard no argument on the federal constitutional
issues" (emphasis added)). Indeed, if only factual questions were at issue,
we would have authorized a denial of the writ not whenever the statecourt proceeding "has resulted in a satisfactory conclusion" (as we did),
id., at 463 (emphasis added), but only whenever the state-court proceeding
has resulted in satisfactory factfinding.

5 Justice O'Connor quotes Justice Frankfurter for the proposition that

a district judge on habeas " `must exercise his own judgment' " with respect
to mixed questions. Post, at 300 (quoting 344 U. S., at 507). Although
we agree with Justice O'Connor that this passage by itself suggests a
de novo standard, it is not easily reconciled with Justice Frankfurter's
later statement that "there is no need for the federal judge, if he could, to
shut his eyes to the State consideration" of the mixed question, id., at 508.
These statements can be reconciled, of course, on the assumption that the
habeas judge must review the state-court determination for reasonableness. But we need not attempt to defend that conclusion in detail, for

Opinion of Thomas, J.
In subsequent cases, we repeatedly reaffirmed Brown'steaching that mixed constitutional questions are "open to review on collateral attack," Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U. S. 335,342 (1980), without ever explicitly considering whether that
"review" should be de novo or deferential. In some of thesecases, we would have denied habeas relief even under

denovo review, see, e. g., Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S.

668, 698 (1984) (facts make it "clear" that habeas petitionerdid not receive ineffective assistance of counsel); Neil v. Biggers, 409 U. S. 188, 201 (1972) (facts disclose "no substantiallikelihood" that habeas petitioner was subjected to unreliable
pretrial lineup); in others, we would have awarded habeasrelief even under deferential review, see,

e. g., Brewer v. Wil-liams, 430 U. S. 387, 405 (1977) (facts provide "no reasonable

basis" for finding valid waiver of right to counsel); Irvin v.Dowd, 366 U. S. 717, 725 (1961) (facts show "clear and convincing" evidence of biased jury); and in yet others, we re-manded for application of a proper legal rule without addressing that standard of review question, see, e. g., Cuyler,
supra, at 342, 350. Nonetheless, because these cases neverqualified our early citation of Brown for the proposition that

a federal habeas court must reexamine mixed constitutionalquestions "independently," Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293,
318 (1963) (dictum), we have gradually come to treat as set-tled the rule that mixed constitutional questions are "subject
to plenary federal review" on habeas, Miller v. Fenton, 474U. S. 104, 112 (1985).

6

we conclude not that Brown v. Allen establishes deferential review for
reasonableness, but only that Brown does not squarely foreclose it.

6 We have no disagreement with Justice O'Connor that Brown v. Allen

quickly came to be cited for the proposition that a habeas court should
review mixed questions "independently"; that several of our cases since
Brown have applied a de novo standard with respect to pure and mixed
legal questions; and that the de novo standard thus appeared well settled
with respect to both categories by the time the Court decided Miller v.
Fenton in 1985. See post, at 301-302. Despite her extended discussion
of the leading cases from Brown through Miller, however, Justice O'Con505us1102N 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT

Jackson itself contributed to this trend. There, we heldthat a conviction violates due process if supported only by

evidence from which "no rational trier of fact could find guiltbeyond a reasonable doubt." 443 U. S., at 317. We stated
explicitly that a state-court judgment applying the Jacksonrule in a particular case "is of course entitled to deference"
on federal habeas. Id., at 323; see also id., at 336, n. 9 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment) ("State judges are morefamiliar with the elements of state offenses than are federal

judges and should be better able to evaluate sufficiencyclaims"). Notwithstanding these principles, however, we
then indicated that the habeas court itself should apply the
Jackson rule, see id., at 324, rather than merely reviewingthe state courts' application of it for reasonableness. Ultimately, though, we had no occasion to resolve our conflictingstatements on the standard of review question, because we
concluded that the habeas petitioner was not entitled torelief even under our own

de novo application of Jackson.
See id., at 324-326.7

nor offers nothing to refute those of our limited observations with which
she evidently disagrees--that an unadorned citation to Brown should not
have been enough, at least as an original matter, to establish de novo
review with respect to mixed questions; and that in none of our leading
cases was the choice between a de novo and a deferential standard outcome determinative.

7 Justice O'Connor asserts that Jackson "expressly rejected" a "deferential standard of review" that she characterizes as "very much like the
one" urged on us by petitioners. Post, at 303 (citing 443 U. S., at 323).
What Jackson expressly rejected, however, was a proposal that habeas
review "should be foreclosed" if the state courts provide "appellate review
of the sufficiency of the evidence." Ibid. That rule, of course, would permit no habeas review of a state-court sufficiency determination. As we
understand it, however, petitioners' proposal would permit limited review
for reasonableness, a standard surely consistent with our own statement
that that state-court determination "is of course entitled to deference."
Ibid. We agree with Justice O'Connor that Jackson itself applied a
de novo standard. See post, at 303. Nonetheless, given our statement

Opinion of Thomas, J.
Despite our apparent adherence to a standard of de novohabeas review with respect to mixed constitutional questions, we have implicitly questioned that standard, at leastwith respect to pure legal questions, in our recent retroactivity precedents. In Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 313-314
(1989), a majority of this Court endorsed the retroactivityanalysis advanced by

Justice O'Connor for a plurality in
Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989). Under Teague, a ha-beas petitioner generally cannot benefit from a new rule of

criminal procedure announced after his conviction has be-come final on direct appeal. See

id., at 305-310 (opinion of
O'Connor, J.). Teague defined a "new" rule as one that was"not

dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant's conviction became final." Id., at 301 (emphasis in original). In Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407, 415 (1990), weexplained that the definition includes all rules "susceptible

to debate among reasonable minds." Thus, if a state courthas reasonably rejected the legal claim asserted by a habeas
petitioner under existing law, then the claim seeks the bene-fit of a "new" rule under

Butler, and is therefore not cognizable on habeas under Teague. In other words, a federal ha-beas court "must defer to the state court's decision rejecting

the claim unless that decision is patently unreasonable."
Butler, supra, at 422 (Brennan, J., dissenting).8

expressly endorsing a notion of at least limited deference, and given that
the Jackson petitioner would have lost under either a de novo standard
or a reasonableness standard, we cannot agree that the case "expressly
rejected" the latter. Post, at 303.

8 Justice O'Connor suggests that Teague and its progeny "did not establish a standard of review at all." Post, at 303-304. Instead, she contends, these cases merely prohibit the retroactive application of new rules
on habeas, ibid., and establish the criterion for distinguishing new rules
from old ones, ibid. We have no difficulty with describing Teague as a
case about retroactivity, rather than standards of review, although we do
not dispute Justice O'Connor's suggestion that the difference, at least
in practice, might well be "only `a matter of phrasing.' " Post, at 304 (cita505us1102N 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Thomas, J.
Teague was premised on the view that retroactivity ques-tions in habeas corpus proceedings must take account of the

nature and function of the writ, which we described as " `a
collateral remedy . . . not designed as a substitute for direct
review.' " 489 U. S., at 306 (opinion of O'Connor, J.) (quoting Mackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667, 682-683 (1971)(Harlan, J., concurring in judgments in part and dissenting

in part)) (emphasis in Mackey). Justice Stevens reasonedsimilarly in

Jackson, where he stressed that habeas corpus
"is not intended as a substitute for appeal, nor as a devicefor reviewing the merits of guilt determinations at criminal

trials," but only "to guard against extreme malfunctions inthe state criminal justice systems." 443 U. S., at 332, n. 5
(opinion concurring in judgment); see also Greer v. Miller,
483 U. S. 756, 768-769 (1987) (Stevens, J., concurring injudgment). Indeed, the notion that different standards

should apply on direct and collateral review runs throughout
our recent habeas jurisprudence. We have said, for example, that new rules always have retroactive application to

tion omitted). We do disagree, however, with Justice O'Connor's definition of what constitutes a "new rule" for Teague purposes. A rule is new,
she contends, if it "can be meaningfully distinguished from that established by binding precedent at the time [the] state court conviction became
final." Post, at 304. This definition leads her to suggest that a habeas
court must determine whether the state courts have interpreted old precedents "properly." Post, at 305. Our precedents, however, require a different standard. We have held that a rule is "new" for Teague purposes
whenever its validity under existing precedents is subject to debate among
"reasonable minds," Butler, 494 U. S., at 415, or among "reasonable jurists," Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 234 (1990). Indeed, each of our last
four relevant precedents has indicated that Teague insulates on habeas
review the state courts' " `reasonable, good-faith interpretations of existing precedents.' " Ibid. (quoting Butler, supra, at 414); Saffle v. Parks,
494 U. S. 484, 488 (1990) (citing Butler); see Stringer v. Black, 503 U. S.
222, 237 (1992) ("The purpose of the new rule doctrine is to validate reasonable interpretations of existing precedents"). Thus, Teague bars
habeas relief whenever the state courts have interpreted old precedents
reasonably, not only when they have done so "properly." Post, at 305.

criminal cases pending on direct review, see Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, 320-328 (1987), but that they generally
do not have retroactive application to criminal cases pendingon habeas, see

Teague, supra, at 305-310 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). We have held that the Constitution guarantees the
right to counsel on a first direct appeal, see, e. g., Douglas v.
California, 372 U. S. 353, 355-358 (1963), but that it guarantees no right to counsel on habeas, see, e. g., Pennsylvaniav.

Finley, 481 U. S. 551, 555 (1987). On direct review, we
have announced and enforced the rule that state courts mustexclude evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. See, e. g., Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643, 654-660 (1961).
We have also held, however, that claims under Mapp are not
cognizable on habeas as long as the state courts have provided a full and fair opportunity to litigate them at trial or
on direct review. See Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 489-
496 (1976).

These differences simply reflect the fact that habeas review "entails significant costs." Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S.
107, 126 (1982). Among other things, " `[i]t disturbs the
State's significant interest in repose for concluded litigation,
denies society the right to punish some admitted offenders,
and intrudes on state sovereignty to a degree matched by
few exercises of federal judicial authority.' " Duckworth v.
Eagan, 492 U. S. 195, 210 (1989) (O'Connor, J., concurring)
(quoting Harris v. Reed, 489 U. S. 255, 282 (1989) (Kennedy,
J., dissenting)). In various contexts, we have emphasized
that these costs, as well as the countervailing benefits, must
be taken into consideration in defining the scope of the writ.
See, e. g., Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 738-739
(1991) (procedural default); McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467,
490-493 (1991) (abuse of the writ); Teague, supra, at 308-310
(opinion of O'Connor, J.) (retroactivity); Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U. S., at 444-455 (opinion of Powell, J.) (successive
petitions); Stone v. Powell, supra, at 491-492, n. 31 (cognizability of particular claims).

294 WRIGHT v. WEST

Opinion of Thomas, J.
In light of these principles, petitioners ask that we reconsider our statement in Miller v. Fenton that mixed constitutional questions are "subject to plenary federal review" on
habeas, 474 U. S., at 112. By its terms, Teague itself is not
directly controlling, because West sought federal habeas relief under Jackson, which was decided a year before his conviction became final on direct review. Nonetheless, petitioners contend, the logic of Teague makes our statement
in Miller untenable. Petitioners argue that if deferential
review for reasonableness strikes an appropriate balance
with respect to purely legal claims, then it must strike an
appropriate balance with respect to mixed questions as well.
Moreover, they note that under the habeas statute itself, a
state-court determination of a purely factual question must
be "presumed correct," and can be overcome only by "convincing evidence," unless one of eight statutorily enumerated
exceptions is present. 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d). It makes no
sense, petitioners assert, for a habeas court generally to review factual determinations and legal determinations deferentially, but to review applications of law to fact de novo.
Finally, petitioners find the prospect of deferential review
for mixed questions at least implicit in our recent statement
that Teague concerns are fully implicated "by the application of an old rule in a manner that was not dictated by
precedent." Stringer v. Black, 503 U. S. 222, 228 (1992) (emphasis added). For these reasons, petitioners invite us to
reaffirm that a habeas judge need not--and indeed may
not--"shut his eyes" entirely to state-court applications of
law to fact. Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S., at 508 (opinion of
Frankfurter, J.). West develops two principal counterarguments: first, that Congress implicitly codified a de novo
standard with respect to mixed constitutional questions
when it amended the habeas statute in 1966; and second, that

de novo federal review is necessary to vindicate federal con-stitutional rights.

We need not decide such far-reaching issues in this case.As in both Brown and Jackson, the claim advanced by the

habeas petitioner must fail even assuming that the statecourt's re jection of it should be reconsidered

de novo.Whatever the appropriate standard of review, we conclude

that there was more than enough evidence to supportWest's conviction.

The case against West was strong. Two to four weeksafter the Cardova home had been burglarized, over 15 of the
items stolen were recovered from West's home. On directexamination at trial, West said nothing more than that he
frequently bought and sold items at different flea markets.He failed to offer specific information about how he had come
to acquire any of the stolen items, and he did not even men-tion Ronnie Elkins by name. When pressed on crossexamination about the details of his purchases, West contra-dicted himself repeatedly about where he supposedly had
bought the stolen goods, and he gave vague, seemingly eva9 Justice O'Connor criticizes our failure to highlight in text the fact
that Congress has considered, but failed to enact, several bills introduced
during the last 25 years to prohibit de novo review explicitly. See post,
at 305; see also Brief for Senator Biden et al. as Amici Curiae 10-16
(discussing various proposals). Our task, however, is not to construe bills
that Congress has failed to enact, but to construe statutes that Congress
has enacted. The habeas corpus statute was last amended in 1966. See
80 Stat. 1104-1105. We have grave doubts that post-1966 legislative history is of any value in construing its provisions, for we have often observed that " `the views of a subsequent Congress form a hazardous basis
for inferring the intent of an earlier one.' " Consumer Product Safety
Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U. S. 102, 117 (1980), quoting United
States v. Price, 361 U. S. 304, 313 (1960). Compare also Sullivan v. Finkelstein, 496 U. S. 617, 628, n. 8 (1990) (acknowledging "all the usual difficulties inherent in relying on subsequent legislative history"), with id.,
at 632 (Scalia, J., concurring in part) ("Arguments based on subsequent
legislative history, like arguments based on antecedent futurity, should not
be taken seriously").

sive answers to various other questions. See n. 1, supra.He said further that he could not remember how he had acquired such major household items as a television set and acoffee table, and he failed to offer any explanation whatsoever about how he had acquired Cardova's record player,
among other things. Moreover, he testified that he had ac-quired Cardova's second television set from a seller other

than Elkins (who remained unidentified) in an entirely unre-lated (but roughly contemporaneous) transaction. Finally,
he failed to produce any other supporting evidence, such astestimony from Elkins, whom he claimed to have known for
years and done business with on a regular basis.

As the trier of fact, the jury was entitled to disbelieve
West's uncorroborated and confused testimony. In evaluating that testimony, moreover, the jury was entitled to discount West's credibility on account of his prior felony conviction, see Va. Code Ann. $ 19.2-269 (1990); Sadoski v.
Commonwealth, 219 Va. 1069, 254 S. E. 2d 100 (1979), and to
take into account West's demeanor when testifying, which
neither the Court of Appeals nor we may review. And if the
jury did disbelieve West, it was further entitled to consider
whatever it concluded to be perjured testimony as affirmative evidence of guilt, see, e. g., Wilson v. United States, 162
U. S. 613, 620-621 (1896); United States v. Zafiro, 945 F. 2d
881, 888 (CA7 1991) (Posner, J.), cert. granted on other
grounds, 503 U. S. 935 (1992); Dyer v. MacDougall, 201 F. 2d
265, 269 (CA2 1952) (L. Hand, J.).

In Jackson, we emphasized repeatedly the deference owed
to the trier of fact and, correspondingly, the sharply limited
nature of constitutional sufficiency review. We said that
"all of the evidence is to be considered in the light most
favorable to the prosecution," 443 U. S., at 319 (emphasis in
original); that the prosecution need not affirmatively "rule
out every hypothesis except that of guilt," id., at 326; and
that a reviewing court "faced with a record of historical facts
that supports conflicting inferences must presume--even if

it does not affirmatively appear in the record--that the trierof fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the prosecution,

and must defer to that resolution," ibid. Under these stand-ards, we think it clear that the trial record contained sufficient evidence to support West's conviction.

Having granted relief on West's Jackson claim, the Courtof Appeals declined to address West's additional claim that

he was entitled to a new trial, as a matter of due process, onthe basis of newly discovered evidence. See 931 F. 2d, at
271, n. 9. As that claim is not properly before us, we declineto address it here. The judgment of the Court of Appeals
is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice White, concurring in the judgment.
Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979), required the fed-eral courts to deny the requested writ of habeas corpus if,

under the Jackson standard, there was sufficient evidence to
support West's conviction, which, as the principal opinion
amply demonstrates, see ante, at 295-296 and this page,
there certainly was.

Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Blackmun and
Justice Stevens join, concurring in the judgment.

I agree that the evidence sufficiently supported respondent's conviction. I write separately only to express disagreement with certain statements in Justice Thomas'
extended discussion, ante, at 285-295, of this Court's habeas
corpus jurisprudence.

First, Justice Thomas errs in describing the pre-1953 law
of habeas corpus. Ante, at 285. While it is true that a
state prisoner could not obtain the writ if he had been provided a full and fair hearing in the state courts, this rule
governed the merits of a claim under the Due Process
Clause. It was not a threshold bar to the consideration of

505us1102J 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT
298 WRIGHT v. WEST

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
other federal claims, because, with rare exceptions, there
were no other federal claims available at the time. During
the period Justice Thomas discusses, the guarantees of theBill of Rights were not yet understood to apply in state criminal prosecutions. The only protections the Constitution
afforded to state prisoners were those for which the textof the Constitution explicitly limited the authority of the

States, most notably the Due Process Clause of the Four-teenth Amendment. And in the area of criminal procedure,
the Due Process Clause was understood to guarantee nomore than a full and fair hearing in the state courts. See,
e. g., Ponzi v. Fessenden, 258 U. S. 254, 260 (1922) ("One accused of crime has a right to a full and fair trial according to
the law of the government whose sovereignty he is alleged
to have offended, but he has no more than that").

Thus, when the Court stated that a state prisoner who had
been afforded a full and fair hearing could not obtain a writ
of habeas corpus, the Court was propounding a rule of constitutional law, not a threshold requirement of habeas corpus.
This is evident from the fact that the Court did not just apply
this rule on habeas, but also in cases on direct review. See,
e. g., Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97, 107-108 (1934)
("[T]he presence of a defendant is a condition of due process
to the extent that a fair and just hearing would be thwarted
by his absence, and to that extent only"); Twining v. New
Jersey, 211 U. S. 78, 110-111 (1908) ("Due process requires
that the court which assumes to determine the rights of parties shall have jurisdiction, and that there shall be notice and
opportunity for hearing given the parties. Subject to these
two fundamental conditions, . . . this court has up to this
time sustained all state laws, statutory or judicially declared,
regulating procedure, evidence and methods of trial, and held
them to be consistent with due process of law") (citations
omitted). As long as a state criminal prosecution was fairly
conducted by a court of competent jurisdiction according to
state law, no constitutional question was presented, whether

299Cite as: 505 U. S. 277 (1992)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
on direct or habeas review. Caldwell v. Texas, 137 U. S. 692,698 (1891);

Brown v. New Jersey, 175 U. S. 172, 175 (1899).
The cases cited by Justice Thomas--Moore v. Dempsey,261 U. S. 86 (1923), and

Frank v. Mangum, 237 U. S. 309
(1915)--demonstrate that the absence of a full and fair hearing in the state courts was itself the relevant violation of theConstitution; it was not a prerequisite to a federal court's

consideration of some other federal claim. Both cases heldthat a trial dominated by an angry mob was inconsistent
with due process. In both, the Court recognized that theState could nevertheless afford due process if the state appellate courts provided a fair opportunity to correct the
error. The state courts had provided such an opportunity
in Frank; in Moore, they had not. In neither case is the
"full and fair hearing" rule cited as a deferential standard of
review applicable to habeas cases; the rule instead defines
the constitutional claim itself, which was reviewed de novo.
See Moore, supra, at 91-92.

Second, Justice Thomas quotes Justice Powell's opinion
in Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U. S. 436 (1986), out of context.
Ante, at 285-286. Justice Powell said only that the judgment of a committing court of competent jurisdiction was
accorded "absolute respect" on habeas in the 19th century,
when the habeas inquiry was limited to the jurisdiction of
the court. Kuhlmann, supra, at 446 (opinion of Powell, J.).
Justice Powell was not expressing the erroneous view which
Justice Thomas today ascribes to him, that state court
judgments were entitled to complete deference before 1953.

Third, Justice Thomas errs in implying that Brown v.
Allen, 344 U. S. 443 (1953), was the first case in which the
Court held that the doctrine of res judicata is not strictly
followed on federal habeas. Ante, at 287. In fact, the Court
explicitly reached this holding for the first time in Salinger
v. Loisel, 265 U. S. 224, 230 (1924). Even Salinger did not
break new ground: The Salinger Court observed that such
had been the rule at common law, and that the Court had

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
implicitly followed it in Carter v. McClaughry, 183 U. S. 365,378 (1902), and

Ex parte Spencer, 228 U. S. 652, 658 (1913).
Salinger, supra, at 230. The Court reached the same con-clusion in at least two other cases between

Salinger and
Brown. See Waley v. Johnston, 316 U. S. 101, 105 (1942);
Darr v. Burford, 339 U. S. 200, 214 (1950). Darr and Spencer, like this case, involved the initial federal habeas filings
of state prisoners.Fourth,

Justice Thomas understates the certainty with
which Brown v. Allen rejected a deferential standard of re-view of issues of law.

Ante, at 287-288. The passages in
which the Brown Court stated that a district court should
determine whether the state adjudication had resulted in a
"satisfactory conclusion," and that the federal courts had discretion to give some weight to state court determinations,
ante, at 287, were passages in which the Court was discussing
how federal courts should resolve questions of fact, not issues of law. This becomes apparent from a reading of the relevant section of Brown, 344 U. S., at 460-465, a section entitled "Right to a Plenary Hearing." When the Court then
turned to the primary legal question presented--whether the
Fourteenth Amendment permitted the restriction of jury
service to taxpayers--the Court answered that question in the
affirmative without any hint of deference to the state courts.
Id., at 467-474. The proper standard of review of issues of
law was also discussed in Justice Frankfurter's opinion,
which a majority of the Court endorsed. After recognizing
that state court factfinding need not always be repeated in
federal court, Justice Frankfurter turned to the quite different question of determining the law. He wrote: "Where the
ascertainment of the historical facts does not dispose of the
claim but calls for interpretation of the legal significance of
such facts, the District Judge must exercise his own judgment on this blend of facts and their legal values. Thus, socalled mixed questions or the application of constitutional
principles to the facts as found leave the duty of adjudication

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
with the federal judge." Id., at 507 (emphasis added; cita-tion omitted). Justice Frankfurter concluded: "The State

court cannot have the last say when it, though on fair consid-eration and what procedurally may be deemed fairness, may
have misconceived a federal constitutional right." Id., at
508.Fifth,

Justice Thomas incorrectly states that we have
never considered the standard of review to apply to mixedquestions of law and fact raised on federal habeas.

Ante, at
289. On the contrary, we did so in the very cases cited by
Justice Thomas. In Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717 (1961),
we stated quite clearly that " `mixed questions or the application of constitutional principles to the facts as found leave
the duty of adjudication with the federal judge.' It was,
therefore, the duty of the Court of Appeals to independently
evaluate [the issue of jury prejudice]." Id., at 723 (quoting
Brown v. Allen, supra, at 507 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.)).
We then proceeded to employ precisely the same legal analysis as in cases on direct appeal. 366 U. S., at 723-728.

In Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293 (1963), we again said
that "[a]lthough the district judge may, where the state court
has reliably found the relevant facts, defer to the state
court's findings of fact, he may not defer to its findings of
law. It is the district judge's duty to apply the applicable
federal law to the state court fact findings independently."
Id., at 318.

In Neil v. Biggers, 409 U. S. 188 (1972), we addressed
de novo the question whether the state court pretrial identification procedures were unconstitutionally suggestive by
using the same standard used in cases on direct appeal: " `a
very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.' "
Id., at 198 (quoting Simmons v. United States, 390 U. S. 377,
384 (1968)).

In Brewer v. Williams, 430 U. S. 387 (1977), we reviewed
de novo a state court's finding that a defendant had waived
his right to counsel. We held that "the question of waiver

505us1102J 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT
302 WRIGHT v. WEST

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
was not a question of historical fact, but one which, in the
words of Mr. Justice Frankfurter, requires `application of
constitutional principles to the facts as found . . . .' " Id., at
403 (quoting Brown v. Allen, supra, at 507 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.)). We then employed the same legal analysis used
on direct review. 430 U. S., at 404.

In Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U. S. 335 (1980), we explicitly
considered the question whether the Court of Appeals had
exceeded the proper scope of review of the state court's decision. Id., at 341. We concluded that because the issue presented was not one of historical fact entitled to a presumption of correctness under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d), the Court of
Appeals was correct in reconsidering the state court's "application of legal principles to the historical facts of this case."
446 U. S., at 342. Although we held that the Court of Appeals had erred in stating the proper legal principle, we remanded to have it consider the case under the same legal
principles as in cases on direct review. Id., at 345-350.

In Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), we held
that "[t]he principles governing ineffectiveness claims should
apply in federal collateral proceedings as they do on direct
appeal or in motions for a new trial. . . . [N]o special standards ought to apply to ineffectiveness claims made in habeas proceedings." Id., at 697-698. We distinguished state
court determinations of mixed questions of fact and law, to
which federal courts should not defer, from state court findings of historical fact, to which federal courts should defer.
Id., at 698.

Finally, in Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104 (1985), we recognized that "an unbroken line of cases, coming to this Court
both on direct appeal and on review of applications to lower
federal courts for a writ of habeas corpus, forecloses the
Court of Appeals' conclusion that the `voluntariness' of a
confession merits something less than independent federal
consideration." Id., at 112.

To this list of cases cited by Justice Thomas, one couldadd the following, all of which applied a standard of

Eagan, 492 U. S. 195, 201-205 (1989). There have been
many others.

Sixth, Justice Thomas misdescribes Jackson v. Virginia,
443 U. S. 307 (1979). Ante, at 290. In Jackson, the respondents proposed a deferential standard of review, very
much like the one Justice Thomas discusses today, that
they thought appropriate for addressing constitutional
claims of insufficient evidence. 443 U. S., at 323. We expressly rejected this proposal. Ibid. Instead, we adhered
to the general rule of de novo review of constitutional claims
on habeas. Id., at 324.

Seventh, Justice Thomas mischaracterizes Teague v.
Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), and Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S.
302 (1989), as "question[ing] th[e] standard [of de novo review] with respect to pure legal questions." Ante, at 291.
Teague did not establish a "deferential" standard of review
of state court determinations of federal law. It did not es505us1102J 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT
304 WRIGHT v. WEST

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
tablish a standard of review at all. Instead, Teague simplyrequires that a state conviction on federal habeas be judged

according to the law in existence when the conviction be-came final.

Penry, supra, at 314; Teague, supra, at 301. In
Teague, we refused to give state prisoners the retroactive
benefit of new rules of law, but we did not create any defer-ential standard of review with regard to old rules.

To determine what counts as a new rule, Teague requirescourts to ask whether the rule a habeas petitioner seeks can
be meaningfully distinguished from that established by bind-ing precedent at the time his state court conviction became
final. Cf. Mackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667, 695 (1971)
(inquiry is "to determine whether a particular decision has
really announced a `new' rule at all or whether it has simply
applied a well-established constitutional principle to govern
a case which is closely analogous to those which have been
previously considered in the prior case law") (Harlan, J., concurring in judgments in part and dissenting in part) (internal
quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). Even though
we have characterized the new rule inquiry as whether "reasonable jurists" could disagree as to whether a result is dictated by precedent, see Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 234
(1990), the standard for determining when a case establishes
a new rule is "objective," and the mere existence of conflicting authority does not necessarily mean a rule is new.
Stringer v. Black, 503 U. S. 222, 237 (1992). If a proffered
factual distinction between the case under consideration and
pre-existing precedent does not change the force with which
the precedent's underlying principle applies, the distinction
is not meaningful, and any deviation from precedent is not
reasonable.

So, while Justice Thomas says that we "defer" to state
courts' determinations of federal law, the statement is misleading. Although in practice, it may seem only "a matter
of phrasing" whether one calls the Teague inquiry a standard
of review or not, "phrasing mirrors thought, [and] it is impor505us1102J 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT

305Cite as: 505 U. S. 277 (1992)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
tant that the phrasing not obscure the true issue before afederal court."

Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S., at 501 (opinion of
Frankfurter, J.). As Justice Kennedy convincingly dem-onstrates, the duty of the federal court in evaluating whether

a rule is "new" is not the same as deference; federal courts
must make an independent evaluation of the precedent exist-ing at the time the state conviction became final in order to

determine whether the case under consideration is meaning-fully distinguishable.

Teague does not direct federal courts
to spend less time or effort scrutinizing the existing federallaw, on the ground that they can assume the state courts

interpreted it properly.

Eighth, though Justice Thomas suggests otherwise, ante,
at 293, de novo review is not incompatible with the maxim
that federal courts should "give great weight to the considered conclusions of a coequal state judiciary," Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S., at 112, just as they do to persuasive, wellreasoned authority from district or circuit courts in other
jurisdictions. A state court opinion concerning the legal implications of precisely the same set of facts is the closest one
can get to a "case on point," and is especially valuable for
that reason. But this does not mean that we have held in
the past that federal courts must presume the correctness of
a state court's legal conclusions on habeas, or that a state
court's incorrect legal determination has ever been allowed
to stand because it was reasonable. We have always held
that federal courts, even on habeas, have an independent obligation to say what the law is.

Finally, in his one-sentence summary of respondent's arguments, ante, at 294, Justice Thomas fails to mention that
Congress has considered habeas corpus legislation during 27
of the past 37 years, and on 13 occasions has considered
adopting a deferential standard of review along the lines suggested by Justice Thomas. Congress has rejected each
proposal. In light of the case law and Congress' position, a
move away from de novo review of mixed questions of law

505us1102J 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT
306 WRIGHT v. WEST

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
and fact would be a substantial change in our constructionof the authority conferred by the habeas corpus statute. As

Justice Thomas acknowledges, to change the standard ofreview would indeed be "far-reaching,"

ante, at 295, and we
need not decide whether to do so in order to resolve this case.

Justice Kennedy, concurring in the judgment.
I do not enter the debate about the reasons that took usto the point where mixed constitutional questions are subject

to de novo review in federal habeas corpus proceedings.Whatever the answer to that difficult historical inquiry, all
agree that, at least prior to the Court's adoption of the retro-activity analysis of

Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), see
Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 313-314 (1989), the matterwas settled. It seems that the real issue dividing my colleagues is whether the retroactivity analysis of Teague casts
doubt upon the rule of Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 112
(1985). Even petitioner State of Virginia and the United
States as amicus curiae, both seeking a deferential standard
with respect to mixed questions, recognize that this is how
the standard of review question arises. See Brief for Petitioners 11 ("The notion that a state prisoner has a right to
de novo federal collateral review of his constitutional claims
. . . surely has not survived this Court's decisions in Teague"
and its progeny); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae
12 ("Prior to the rule established by Teague [and later cases
applying Teague], this Court often treated mixed questions
of law and fact as subject to independent review in federal
habeas corpus").

If vindication of the principles underlying Teague did require that state-court rulings on mixed questions must be
given deference in a federal habeas proceeding, then indeed
it might be said that the Teague line of cases is on a collision
course with the Miller v. Fenton line. And in the proper
case we would have to select one at the expense of the other.
But in my view neither the purpose for which Teague was

505us1102L 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT

307Cite as: 505 U. S. 277 (1992)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
adopted nor the necessary means for implementing its hold-ing creates any real conflict with the requirement of de novo

review of mixed questions.In my view, it would be a misreading of Teague to interpret it as resting on the necessity to defer to state-court de-terminations.

Teague did not establish a deferential stand-ard of review of state-court decisions of federal law. It

established instead a principle of retroactivity. See Teaguev. Lane, supra, at 310 ("[W]e now adopt Justice Harlan's
view of retroactivity for cases on collateral review"). To besure, the fact that our standard for distinguishing old rules
from new ones turns on the reasonableness of a state court'sinterpretation of then existing precedents suggests that federal courts do in one sense defer to state-court determina-tions. But we should not lose sight of the purpose of the
reasonableness inquiry where a Teague issue is raised: Thepurpose is to determine whether application of a new rule
would upset a conviction that was obtained in accordancewith the constitutional interpretations existing at the time
of the prisoner's conviction.As we explained earlier this Term:

"When a petitioner seeks federal habeas relief basedupon a principle announced after a final judgment,
Teague and our subsequent decisions interpreting it re-quire a federal court to answer an initial question, and
in some cases a second. First, it must be determinedwhether the decision relied upon announced a new rule.
If the answer is yes and neither exception applies, thedecision is not available to the petitioner. If, however,
the decision did not announce a new rule, it is necessaryto inquire whether granting the relief sought would create a new rule because the prior decision is applied ina novel setting, thereby extending the precedent. The
interests in finality, predictability, and comity underly-ing our new rule jurisprudence may be undermined to
an equal degree by the invocation of a rule that was not

505us1102L 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT
308 WRIGHT v. WEST

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
dictated by precedent as by the application of an oldrule in a manner that was not dictated by precedent."

Stringer v. Black, 503 U. S. 222, 227-228 (1992) (citationomitted).

The comity interest is not, however, in saying that since thequestion is close the state-court decision ought to be deemed
correct because we are in no better position to judge. Thatwould be the real thrust of a principle based on deference.
We see that principle at work in the statutory requirementthat, except in limited circumstances, the federal habeas
court must presume the correctness of state-court factualfindings. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d). See also

Rushen v.Spain, 464 U. S. 114, 120 (1983) (per curiam) (noting that

"the state courts were in a far better position than the fed-eral courts to answer" a factual question). Deference of this
kind may be termed a comity interest, but it is not the com-ity interest that underlies

Teague. The comity interestserved by Teague is in not subjecting the States to a regime

in which finality is undermined by our changing a rule oncethought correct but now understood to be deficient on its
own terms. It is in recognition of this principle that we askwhether the decision in question was dictated by precedent.
See, e. g., Saffle v. Parks, 494 U. S. 484, 488 (1990).

Teague does bear on applications of law to fact which re-sult in the announcement of a new rule. Whether the prisoner seeks the application of an old rule in a novel setting,see Stringer, supra, at 228, depends in large part on the nature of the rule. If the rule in question is one which of ne-cessity requires a case-by-case examination of the evidence,
then we can tolerate a number of specific applications with-out saying that those applications themselves create a new
rule. The rule of Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979),is an example. By its very terms it provides a general
standard which calls for some examination of the facts. Thestandard is whether any rational trier of fact could have
found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt after a review of all

505us1102L 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT

309Cite as: 505 U. S. 277 (1992)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
the evidence, so of course there will be variations from caseto case. Where the beginning point is a rule of this general

application, a rule designed for the specific purpose of evalu-ating a myriad of factual contexts, it will be the infrequent
case that yields a result so novel that it forges a new rule,
one not dictated by precedent.Although as a general matter "new rules will not be applied or announced" in habeas proceedings, Penry, 492 U. S.,at 313, there is no requirement that we engage in the threshold Teague inquiry in a case in which it is clear that theprisoner would not be entitled to the relief he seeks even
if his case were pending on direct review. See Collins v.
Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37 (1990). Therefore, it is not necessary to the resolution of this case to consider the oddity that
reversing respondent's conviction because of the quite factspecific determination that there was insufficient evidence
would have the arguable effect of undercutting the wellestablished general principle in Virginia and elsewhere that
the trier of fact may infer theft from unexplained or falsely
denied possession of recently stolen goods. Whether a holding that there was insufficient evidence would constitute one
of those unusual cases in which an application of Jackson
would create a new rule need not be addressed.

On these premises, the existence of Teague provides added
justification for retaining de novo review, not a reason to
abandon it. Teague gives substantial assurance that habeas
proceedings will not use a new rule to upset a state conviction that conformed to rules then existing. With this safeguard in place, recognizing the importance of finality, de
novo review can be exercised within its proper sphere.

For the foregoing reasons, I would not interpret Teague as
calling into question the settled principle that mixed questions are subject to plenary review on federal habeas corpus.
And, for the reasons I have mentioned, I do not think it necessary to consider whether the respondent brings one of
those unusual Jackson claims which is Teague-barred.

I agree that the evidence in this case was sufficient to con-vince a rational factfinder of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt;

and I concur in the judgment of the Court.

Justice Souter, concurring in the judgment.
While I could not disagree with the majority that sufficientevidence supported West's conviction, see, e. g., ante, at 295-

297, I do not think the Court should reach that issue. Wehave often said that when the principles first developed in
Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), pose a threshold ques-tion on federal habeas review, it is only after an answer
favorable to the prisoner that a court should address themerits. See,

e. g., Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37, 40-41(1990); Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 313, 329 (1989);

Teague, supra, at 300 (plurality opinion). This habeas casebegins with a Teague question, and its answer does not favor
West. I would go no further.1

Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 234 (1990) (quoting Teague,
supra, at 301 (plurality opinion)) (emphasis in original). Putdifferently, the new-rule enquiry asks "whether a state court

considering [the prisoner's] claim at the time his convictionbecame final would have felt compelled by existing precedent
to conclude that the rule [the prisoner] seeks was requiredby the Constitution."

(1990). Or, put differently yet again, if "reasonable jurists[might have] disagree[d]" about the steps the law would take

next, its later development will not be grounds for relief.
Sawyer v. Smith, supra, at 234; see also Butler, supra, at
415 ("susceptible to debate among reasonable minds").

The Teague line of cases reflects recognition of important"interests of comity and finality."

Teague, supra, at 308
(plurality opinion). One purpose of federal collateral reviewof judgments rendered by state courts in criminal cases is

to create an incentive for state courts to " ` "conduct theirproceedings in a manner consistent with established constitutional standards," ' " Butler, supra, at 413 (quoting Teague,
supra, at 306 (plurality opinion)), and "[t]he `new rule' principle" recognizes that purpose by "validat[ing] reasonable,
good-faith interpretations of existing precedents made by
state courts even though they are shown to be contrary to
later decisions." Butler, supra, at 414 (citing United States
v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 918-919 (1984)).

The crux of the analysis when Teague is invoked, then, is
identification of the rule on which the claim for habeas relief
depends. To survive Teague, it must be "old" enough to
have predated the finality of the prisoner's conviction, and
specific enough to dictate the rule on which the conviction
may be held to be unlawful. A rule old enough for Teague
may of course be too general, and while identifying the required age of the rule of relief is a simple matter of comparing dates, passing on its requisite specificity calls for analytical care.

The proper response to a prisoner's invocation of a rule at
too high a level of generality is well illustrated by our cases.
In Butler, supra, for example, the prisoner relied on the rule
of Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675 (1988), which we announced after Butler's conviction had become final. We held
in Roberson that the Fifth Amendment forbids police interrogation about a crime after the suspect requests counsel,
even if his request occurs in the course of investigating a

505us1102M 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT
312 WRIGHT v. WEST

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
different, unrelated crime. Id., at 682. Butler argued that
he could invoke Roberson's rule because it was "merely an
application of Edwards [v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477 (1981)]," in
which we held that, if a person is in custody on suspicion of
a crime, the police must stop questioning him about that
crime once he invokes his right to counsel, id., at 484-485,
"to a slightly different set of facts." 494 U. S., at 414. We
rejected this argument, saying that it "would not have been
an illogical or even a grudging application of Edwards to
decide that it did not extend to the facts of Roberson." Id.,
at 415.

Likewise, in Sawyer, supra, the petitioner sought the benefit of Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320 (1985), which

had been announced after Sawyer's conviction was final.
We held in Caldwell that the Eighth Amendment prohibits
resting "a death sentence on a determination made by a sentencer who has been led to believe that the responsibility
for determining the appropriateness of the defendant's death
rests elsewhere." Id., at 328-329. Sawyer argued that he
was entitled to the benefit of Caldwell's rule as having been

Although the principle that Sawyer invoked certainly "lentgeneral support to the conclusion reached in Caldwell," ibid.,

we said that " `it does not follow that [Eddings and Lockett]compel the rule that [petitioner] seeks,' " ibid. (second set of
brackets in original) (quoting Saffle, supra, at 491).In sum, our cases have recognized that "[t]he interests in
finality, predictability, and comity underlying our new rulejurisprudence may be undermined to an equal degree by the
invocation of a rule that was not dictated by precedent as bythe application of an old rule in a manner that was not dictated by precedent." Stringer v. Black, 503 U. S. 222, 228(1992). This does not mean, of course, that a habeas petitioner must be able to point to an old case decided on factsidentical to the facts of his own. But it does mean that,
in light of authority extant when his conviction becamefinal, its unlawfulness must be apparent. Cf. Anderson v.
Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 640 (1987).

II
In this case, the Court of Appeals overruled the Common-wealth's

Teague objection by saying that West merelyclaimed that the evidence had been insufficient to support

his conviction, so that the result he sought was dictated by
Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979), a case announcedbefore petitioner's conviction became final for Teague purposes in 1980. 931 F. 2d 262, 265-267 (CA4 1991). Havingthus surmounted Teague's time hurdle, the court went on to
say that "the evidence here consisted entirely of . . . the . . .facts . . . that about one-third in value of goods stolen between December 13 and December 26, 1978, were found onJanuary 10, 1979, in the exclusive possession of . . . West,
coupled with [West's] own testimony explaining his posses-sion as having come about by purchases in the interval."
931 F. 2d, at 268. Applied in this context, the court held,the unadorned

Jackson norm translated into the more spe-cific rule announced in Cosby v. Jones, 682 F. 2d 1373 (CA11

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
1982), which held that the evidence of unexplained or uncon-vincingly explained possession of recently stolen goods was

not, without more, sufficient to prove theft, but must beweighed more exactly after asking five questions: (1) Was
"the possession . . . recent, relative to the crime"? (2) Wasa large majority of the stolen items found in the defendant's
possession? (3) Did the defendant attempt to conceal thestolen items? (4) Was the defendant's explanation, "even if
discredited by the jury, . . . `so implausible or demonstrablyfalse as to give rise to positive evidence in favor of the
government' "? and (5) Was there corroborating evidencesupporting the conviction? 931 F. 2d, at 268 (quoting
Cosby, supra, at 1383, n. 19).Applying Cosby to the facts of this case, the Court of Appeals found that all five factors were either neutral or advan-tageous to West: (1) Two to four weeks elapsed between the
theft and the possession described in testimony,2 a time pe-riod consistent with West's explanation that he had bought
the goods in the interval; (2) measured by value, a mere thirdof Cardova's belongings surfaced in West's possession; (3) the
stolen items were found in plain view in West's home; (4)while "there was no third person testimony corroborating
[West's] explanation and on cross-examination West exhib-ited confusion about the exact circumstances of some of the
purchases[,] . . . he maintained his general explanation thathe had purchased all the items at flea markets, and there
was nothing inherently implausible about this explanation";and, finally, (5) there was no evidence corroborating theft
by West. 931 F. 2d, at 269-270. The Court of Appealsconcluded that "the evidence here, assessed in its entirety
and in the light most favorable to the prosecution, was notsufficient to persuade any rational trier of fact of [West's]
guilt . . . ." Id., at 270.

2 The Court of Appeals overlooked that West testified that he came into
possession of Cardova's goods around January 1. See App. 25-27. Thus,
a more accurate estimate of the time lapse would be one to three weeks.

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
It is clear that the Court of Appeals misapplied the com-mands of Teague by defining the rule from which West

sought to benefit at an unduly elevated level of generality.There can, of course, be no doubt that, in reviewing West's
conviction, the Supreme Court of Virginia was not entitledto disregard

Jackson, which antedated the finality of West'sconviction. But from Jackson's rule, that sufficiency depends on whether a rational trier, viewing the evidence mostfavorably to the prosecution, could find all elements beyond
a reasonable doubt, it does not follow that the insufficiencyof the evidence to support West's conviction was apparent.
Virginia courts have long recognized a rule that evidence ofunexplained or falsely explained possession of recently stolen
goods is sufficient to sustain a finding that the possessor tookthe goods. See,

e. g., Montgomery v. Commonwealth, 221Va. 188, 190, 269 S. E. 2d 352, 353 (1980); Henderson v. Commonwealth, 215 Va. 811, 812-813, 213 S. E. 2d 782, 783-784(1975); Bazemore v. Commonwealth, 210 Va. 351, 352, 170
S. E. 2d 774, 776 (1969); Bright v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. App.248, 251, 356 S. E. 2d 443, 444 (1987). In this case, we are
concerned only with the Virginia rule's second prong. Westtook the stand and gave an explanation that the jury rejected, thereby implying a finding that the explanation wasfalse.

3 Thus, the portion of the state rule under attack here

is that falsely explained recent possession suffices to identifythe possessor as the thief. The rule has the virtue of much

common sense. It is utterly reasonable to conclude that apossessor of recently stolen goods who lies about where he
got them is the thief who took them, and it should come asno surprise that the rule had been accepted as good law
against the backdrop of a general state sufficiency standardno less stringent than that of

Jackson. See, e. g., Bishop v.Commonwealth, 227 Va. 164, 169, 313 S. E. 2d 390, 393 (1984);

3 The jury's finding must of course be accepted under the Jackson v.
Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979), requirement to judge sufficiency by viewing
the evidence "in the light most favorable to the prosecution." Id., at 319.

therefore, that in the federal courts West sought the benefitof a "new rule," and that his claim was barred by

Teague.On this ground, I respectfully concur in the judgment of

the Court.

317OCTOBER TERM, 1991
Syllabus

UNITED STATES v. SALERNO et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 91-872. Argued April 20, 1992--Decided June 19, 1992
The respondents were indicted on a variety of federal charges, including

fraud and racketeering in connection with the allocation of construction
contracts among a so-called "Club" of companies in exchange for a share
of the proceeds. Witnesses DeMatteis and Bruno, owners of the Cedar
Park Construction Corporation, testified before the grand jury under a
grant of immunity that neither they nor Cedar Park had participated in
the Club. At trial, however, the United States used other evidence to
show that Cedar Park was a Club member. The respondents subpoenaed DeMatteis and Bruno, but they invoked their Fifth Amendment
privilege against self-incrimination and refused to testify. The District
Court denied the respondents' request to admit the transcripts of DeMatteis' and Bruno's grand jury testimony pursuant to Federal Rule of
Evidence 804(b)(1)--which permits admission of an unavailable declarant's testimony from a former hearing if the party against whom it is
now offered had a "similar motive to develop the testimony by direct,
cross, or redirect examination"--reasoning that a prosecutor's motive in
questioning a witness before the grand jury is different from his motive
in conducting the trial. The respondents were convicted, but the Court
of Appeals reversed, holding that the District Court had erred in excluding the grand jury testimony. It ruled that, to maintain "adversarial
fairness," Rule 804(b)(1)'s similar motive element should evaporate
when the Government obtains immunized testimony in a grand jury
proceeding from a witness who refuses to testify at trial.

Held:

1. Former testimony may not be introduced under Rule 804(b)(1)
without a showing of "similar motive." Nothing in Rule 804(b)(1) suggests that a court may admit former testimony absent satisfaction of
each of the Rule's elements. The respondents err in arguing that the
Rule contains an implicit limitation permitting the "similar motive" requirement to be waived in the interest of adversarial fairness. Also
rejected is the respondents' argument that the United States forfeited
its right to object to the testimony's admission when it introduced contradictory evidence about Cedar Park. Here, the United States never
revealed what DeMatteis and Bruno said to the grand jury, but, rather,
attempted to show Cedar Park's involvement using other evidence. In

addition, the respondents mistakenly argue that adversarial fairness

jury proceedings. Dennis v. United States, 384 U. S. 855, distinguished. Pp. 320-324.

2. This case is remanded for consideration of whether the United
States had a "similar motive." Since the Court of Appeals erroneously

motive, it did not consider fully the parties' arguments on this issue.

Opinion of the Court
Genovese Family of La Cosa Nostra (Family) in New YorkCity. In 1987, a federal grand jury in the Southern District

of New York indicted the respondents and four others on thebasis of these activities. The indictment charged the respondents with a variety of federal offenses, including 41
acts constituting a "pattern of illegal activity" in violationof the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act

(RICO), 18 U. S. C. $ 1962(b).Sixteen of the alleged acts involved fraud in the New York
construction industry in the 1980's. According to the indict-ment and evidence later admitted at trial, the Family used
its influence over labor unions and its control over the supply
of concrete to rig bidding on large construction projects in
Manhattan. The Family purportedly allocated contracts for
these projects among a so-called "Club" of six concrete companies in exchange for a share of the proceeds.

Much of the case concerned the affairs of the Cedar Park
Concrete Construction Corporation (Cedar Park). Two of
the owners of this firm, Frederick DeMatteis and Pasquale
Bruno, testified before the grand jury under a grant of immunity. In response to questions by the United States, they
repeatedly stated that neither they nor Cedar Park had participated in the Club. At trial, however, the United States
attempted to show that Cedar Park, in fact, had belonged to
the Club by calling two contractors who had taken part in
the scheme and by presenting intercepted conversations
among the respondents. The United States also introduced
documents indicating that the Family had an ownership interest in Cedar Park.

To counter the United States' evidence, the respondents
subpoenaed DeMatteis and Bruno as witnesses in the hope
that they would provide the same exculpatory testimony
that they had presented to the grand jury. When both witnesses invoked their Fifth Amendment privilege against
self-incrimination and refused to testify, the respondents
asked the District Court to admit the transcripts of their

Opinion of the Court
grand jury testimony. Although this testimony constitutedhearsay, see Rule 801(c), the respondents argued that it fell

within the hearsay exception in Rule 804(b)(1) for formertestimony of unavailable witnesses.

The District Court refused to admit the grand jury testi-mony. It observed that Rule 804(b)(1) permits admission of
former testimony against a party at trial only when thatparty had a "similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination." The District Courtheld that the United States did not have this motive, stating
that the "motive of a prosecutor in questioning a witnessbefore the grand jury in the investigatory stages of a case is
far different from the motive of a prosecutor in conductingthe trial." App. to Pet. for Cert. 51a. A jury subsequently
convicted the respondents of the RICO counts and otherfederal offenses.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuitreversed, holding that the District Court had erred in excluding DeMatteis' and Bruno's grand jury testimony. 937F. 2d 797 (1991). Although the Court of Appeals recognized
that "the government may have had no motive . . . toimpeach . . . Bruno or DeMatteis" before the grand jury, it
concluded that "the government's motive in examining thewitnesses . . . was irrelevant."

Id., at 806. The Court ofAppeals decided that, in order to maintain "adversarial fairness," Rule 804(b)(1)'s similar motive element should "evapo-rat[e]" when the Government obtains immunized testimony
in a grand jury proceeding from a witness who refuses totestify at trial.

Ibid. We granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 1056(1992), and now reverse and remand.

II
The hearsay rule prohibits admission of certain statementsmade by a declarant other than while testifying at trial. See

Rules 801(c) (hearsay definition), 802 (hearsay rule). Theparties acknowledge that the hearsay rule, standing by itself,

Opinion of the Court
would have blocked introduction at trial of DeMatteis' andBruno's grand jury testimony. Rule 804(b)(1), however, establishes an exception to the hearsay rule for former testi-mony. This exception provides:

"The following are not excluded by the hearsay ruleif the declarant is unavailable as a witness:
"(1) Former Testimony.--Testimony given as a wit-ness at another hearing . . . if the party against whom
the testimony is now offered . . . had an opportunity andsimilar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross,
or redirect examination."
We must decide whether the Court of Appeals properly in-terpreted Rule 804(b)(1) in this case.

The parties agree that DeMatteis and Bruno were "un-available" to the defense as witnesses, provided that they
properly invoked the Fifth Amendment privilege and re-fused to testify. See Rule 804(a)(1). They also agree that
DeMatteis' and Bruno's grand jury testimony constituted"testimony given as . . . witness[es] at another hearing."
They disagree, however, about whether the "similar motive"requirement in the final clause of Rule 804(b)(1) should have
prevented admission of the testimony in this case.

A
Nothing in the language of Rule 804(b)(1) suggests that acourt may admit former testimony absent satisfaction of each

of the Rule's elements. The United States thus asserts that,unless it had a "similar motive," we must conclude that the
District Court properly excluded DeMatteis' and Bruno'stestimony as hearsay. The respondents, in contrast, urge us
not to read Rule 804(b)(1) in a "slavishly literal fashion."Brief for Respondents 31. They contend that "adversarial
fairness" prevents the United States from relying on thesimilar motive requirement in this case. We agree with the
United States.

505us1103N 07-12-96 20:08:57 PAGES OPINPGT
322 UNITED STATES v. SALERNO

Opinion of the Court
When Congress enacted the prohibition against admissionof hearsay in Rule 802, it placed 24 exceptions in Rule 803

and 5 additional exceptions in Rule 804. Congress thus pre-sumably made a careful judgment as to what hearsay may
come into evidence and what may not. To respect its determination, we must enforce the words that it enacted. Therespondents, as a result, had no right to introduce DeMatteis'

and Bruno's former testimony under Rule 804(b)(1) withoutshowing a "similar motive." This Court cannot alter evidentiary rules merely because litigants might prefer differentrules in a particular class of cases. See

Green v. Bock Laundry Machine Co., 490 U. S. 504, 524 (1989).

The respondents' argument for a different result takes
several forms. They first assert that adversarial fairness
requires us to infer that Rule 804(b)(1) contains implicit limitations. They observe, for example, that the Advisory Committee Note to Rule 804 makes clear that the former testimony exception applies only to statements made under oath
or affirmation, even though the Rule does not state this
restriction explicitly. See Advisory Committee's Notes on
Fed. Rule Evid. 804, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 788, subd. (b), except.
(1). The respondents maintain that we likewise may hold
that Rule 804(b)(1) does not require a showing of similar
motive in all instances.

The respondents' example does not persuade us to change
our reading of Rule 804(b)(1). If the Rule applies only to
sworn statements, it does so not because adversarial fairness
implies a limitation, but simply because the word "testimony" refers only to statements made under oath or affirmation. See Black's Law Dictionary 1476 (6th ed. 1990).
We see no way to interpret the text of Rule 804(b)(1) to mean
that defendants sometimes do not have to show "similar
motive."

The respondents also assert that courts often depart from
the Rules of Evidence to prevent litigants from presenting
only part of the truth. For example, citing United States v.

323Cite as: 505 U. S. 317 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
Miller, 600 F. 2d 498 (CA5 1979), the respondents maintainthat, although parties may enjoy various testimonial privileges, they can forfeit these privileges by "opening the door"to certain subjects. In the respondents' view, the United
States is attempting to use the hearsay rule like a privilege
to keep DeMatteis' and Bruno's grand jury testimony awayfrom the jury. They contend, however, that adversarial fairness requires us to conclude that the United States forfeitedits right to object to admission of the testimony when it introduced contradictory evidence about Cedar Park.This argument also fails. Even assuming that we should
treat the hearsay rule like the rules governing testimonial
privileges, we would not conclude that a forfeiture occurred
here. Parties may forfeit a privilege by exposing privileged
evidence, but do not forfeit one merely by taking a position
that the evidence might contradict. See 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence $ 2327, p. 636 (McNaughton rev. 1961); M. Larkin, Federal Testimonial Privileges $ 2.06, pp. 2-103, 2-104, 2-120
(1991). In Miller, for example, the court held that a litigant,
"after giving the jury his version of a privileged communication, [could not] prevent the cross-examiner from utilizing the
communication itself to get at the truth." 600 F. 2d, at
501 (emphasis added). In this case, by contrast, the United
States never presented to the jury any version of what DeMatteis and Bruno had said in the grand jury proceedings.
Instead, it attempted to show Cedar Park's participation in
the Club solely through other evidence available to the respondents. The United States never exposed the jury to
anything analogous to a "privileged communication." The
respondents' argument, accordingly, fails on its own terms.

The respondents finally argue that adversarial fairness
may prohibit suppression of exculpatory evidence produced
in grand jury proceedings. They note that, when this Court
required disclosure of a grand jury transcript in Dennis v.
United States, 384 U. S. 855 (1966), it stated that "it is rarely
justifiable for the prosecution to have exclusive access" to

505us1103N 07-12-96 20:08:57 PAGES OPINPGT
324 UNITED STATES v. SALERNO

Opinion of the Court
relevant facts. Id., at 873. They allege that the UnitedStates nevertheless uses the following tactics to develop

evidence in a one-sided manner: If a witness inculpates adefendant during the grand jury proceedings, the United
States immunizes him and calls him at trial; however, if the
witness exculpates the defendant, as Bruno and DeMatteiseach did here, the United States refuses to immunize him

and attempts to exclude the testimony as hearsay.* The re-spondents assert that dispensing with the "similar motive"
requirement would limit these tactics.We again fail to see how we may create an exception to
Rule 804(b)(1). The Dennis case, unlike this one, did notinvolve a question about the admissibility of evidence.
Rather, it concerned only the need to disclose a transcript to
the defendants. See 384 U. S., at 873. Moreover, in Dennis, we did not hold that adversarial fairness required the
United States to make the grand jury transcript available.Instead, we ordered disclosure under the specific language

of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e). See 384 U. S.,at 869-870, 872. In this case, the language of Rule 804(b)(1)
does not support the respondents. Indeed, the respondentsspecifically ask us to ignore it. Neither

Dennis nor anything else that the respondents have cited provides us with
this authority. B

The question remains whether the United States had a
"similar motive" in this case. The United States asserts
that the District Court specifically found that it did not andthat we should not review its factual determinations. It

also argues that a prosecutor generally will not have thesame motive to develop testimony in grand jury proceedings
as he does at trial. A prosecutor, it explains, must maintain

*The respondents also suggest that, in the event that a witness chooses
to testify at trial without immunity, the United States can impeach him
with his grand jury testimony. See Fed. Rules Evid. 607, 801(d)(1)(A).

secrecy during the investigatory stages of the criminal proc-ess and therefore may not desire to confront grand jury witnesses with contradictory evidence. It further states that aprosecutor may not know, prior to indictment, which issues
will have importance at trial and accordingly may fail to develop grand jury testimony effectively.The respondents disagree with both of the United States'

arguments. They characterize the District Court's rulingas one of law, rather than fact, because the District Court
essentially ruled that a prosecutor's motives at trial alwaysdiffer from his motives in grand jury proceedings. The respondents contend further that the grand jury transcripts inthis case actually show that the United States thoroughly
attempted to impeach DeMatteis and Bruno. They add that,
despite the United States' stated concern about maintaining
secrecy, the United States revealed to DeMatteis and Bruno
the identity of the major witnesses who testified against
them at trial.

The Court of Appeals, as noted, erroneously concluded
that the respondents did not have to demonstrate a similar
motive in this case to make use of Rule 804(b)(1). It therefore declined to consider fully the arguments now presented
by the parties about whether the United States had such
a motive. Rather than to address this issue here in the
first instance, we think it prudent to remand the case for
further consideration. Cf. Denton v. Hernandez, 504 U. S.
25, 32-35 (1992).

It is so ordered.

Justice Blackmun, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion with the understanding that it
does not pass upon the weighty concerns, expressed by Justice Stevens, underlying the interpretation of Federal
Rule of Evidence 804(b)(1)'s similar-motive requirement.
The District Court appeared to hold as a matter of law that
"the motive of a prosecutor in questioning a witness before

505us1103N 07-12-96 20:08:57 PAGES OPINPGT
326 UNITED STATES v. SALERNO

Stevens, J., dissenting
the grand jury in the investigatory stages of a case is fardifferent from the motive of a prosecutor in conducting the

trial." App. to Pet. for Cert. 51a. Because "similar mo-tive" does not mean "identical motive," the similar-motive
inquiry, in my view, is inherently a factual inquiry, depending in part on the similarity of the underlying issues and onthe context of the grand jury questioning. It cannot be that

the prosecution either always or never has a similar motivefor questioning a particular witness with respect to a particular issue before the grand jury as at trial. Moreover,like other inquiries involving the admission of evidence, the
similar-motive inquiry appropriately reflects narrow con-cerns of ensuring the reliability of evidence admitted at
trial--not broad policy concerns favoring either the Government in the conduct of grand jury proceedings or the defendant in overcoming the refusal of other witnesses to testify.
Because this case involves factual issues unusual in complexity and in number and because neither the District Court nor
the Court of Appeals apparently engaged in the type of factual inquiry appropriate for resolution of the similar-motive
inquiry, I join the majority in remanding the case for further consideration.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
Because I believe that the Government clearly had an "opportunity and similar motive" to develop by direct or crossexamination the grand jury testimony of Pasquale Bruno and
Frederick DeMatteis, I would affirm the judgment of the
Court of Appeals on the ground that the transcript of their
grand jury testimony was admissible under the plain language of Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(1). As the Court
explains, ante, at 319, the grand jury testimony of Bruno and
DeMatteis was totally inconsistent with the Government's
theory of the alleged RICO conspiracy to rig bids on large
construction projects in Manhattan. Bruno and DeMatteis
were principals in Cedar Park Construction Corporation

(Cedar Park), which, according to the Government, was amember of the so-called "Club" of concrete companies that

submitted rigged bids on construction projects in accordancewith the orders of the Genovese Family of La Cosa Nostra.
But notwithstanding the fact that they had been givengrants of immunity, Bruno and DeMatteis repeatedly testified before the grand jury that they had not participated ineither the Club or the alleged bid-rigging conspiracy. As
the Court of Appeals explained, Cedar Park was "one of thelargest contractors in the metropolitan New York City concrete industry," and it is arguable that without Cedar Park'sparticipation, "there could be no `club' of concrete contractors." 937 F. 2d 797, 808 (CA2 1991). And without the"Club," the allegations of fraud in the construction industry--which "formed the core of the RICO charges"--"simplydissolv[e]." Ibid.

It is therefore clear that before the grand jury the Govern-ment had precisely the same interest in establishing that
Bruno's and DeMatteis' testimony was false as it had at trial.Thus, when the prosecutors doubted Bruno's and DeMatteis'
veracity before the grand jury--as they most assuredly did--they unquestionably had an "opportunity and similar motive
to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect exami-nation" within the meaning of Rule 804(b)(1).

The Government disagrees, asserting that it "typicallydoes not have the same motive to cross-examine hostile witnesses in the grand jury that it has to cross-examine themat trial." Brief for United States 11. This is so, the Gov1 Rule 804(b)(1) provides:
"Hearsay exceptions.--The following are not excluded by the hearsay
rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:

"(1) Former Testimony.--Testimony given as a witness at another hearing of the same or a different proceeding, or in a deposition taken in compliance with law in the course of the same or another proceeding, if the
party against whom the testimony is now offered, or, in a civil action or
proceeding, a predecessor in interest, had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination."

ernment maintains, because (1) cross-examining the witnessmight indirectly undermine the secrecy of the grand jury

proceedings,2 (2) the Government might decide to discreditthe witness through means other than cross-examination,
and (3) the issues before the grand jury are typically quitedifferent from those at trial. See

id., at 11-14; Reply Brief
for United States 9-12. In my view, the first two reasons--
even assuming that they are true--do not justify holdingthat the Government lacks a "similar motive" in the two proceedings. And although the third reason could justify theconclusion that the Government's motives are not "similar,"
it is not present on the facts of this case.Even if one does not completely agree with Wigmore's
assertion that cross-examination is "beyond any doubt the
greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery oftruth,"

3 one must admit that in the Anglo-American legal

system cross-examination is the principal means of undermining the credibility of a witness whose testimony is false
or inaccurate.4 For that reason, a party has a motive to

2 "If the government exposes the extent of its knowledge to an individual who, by his willingness to commit perjury, has shown himself to be
allied with the investigation's targets, the effect may be to provide information to the targets that can be used to threaten witnesses, destroy
evidence, fabricate a defense, or otherwise obstruct the investigation."
Brief for United States 12.

3 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence $ 1367, p. 32 (J. Chadbourn rev. 1974).

4 Indeed, the lack of an opportunity to cross-examine the absent declarant has been the principal justification for the Anglo-American tradition
of excluding hearsay statements. See, e. g., E. Cleary, McCormick on Evidence $ 245, p. 728 (3d ed. 1984); 5 Wigmore, $ 1367, at 32. This concern
is diminished, however, when the party against whom the hearsay statement is offered had an opportunity to cross-examine the absent declarant
at the time the statement was made. Accordingly, the common law developed an exception to the hearsay rule that permitted the introduction of
prior testimony if the opponent had an adequate opportunity to crossexamine the declarant. See, e. g., id., $ 1386, at 90. Rule 804(b)(1) codified, with a few changes, that common-law rule. See Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Evid. 804(b)(1), 28 U. S. C. App., pp. 788-789.

cross-examine any witness who, in her estimation, is givingfalse or inaccurate testimony about a fact that is material to

the legal question at issue in the proceeding.Of course, the party might decide--for tactical reasons or
otherwise--not to engage in a rigorous cross-examination,or even in any cross-examination at all.

5 In such a case,

however, I do not believe that it is accurate to say that theparty lacked a similar motive to cross-examine the witness;

instead, it is more accurate to say that the party had a simi-lar motive to cross-examine the witness (

i. e., to underminethe false or misleading testimony) but chose not to act on

that motive. Although the Rules of Evidence allow a partyto make that choice about whether to engage in crossexamination, they also provide that she must accept the con-sequences of that decision--including the possibility that the
testimony might be introduced against her in a subsequentproceeding.

6

Thus neither the fact that the prosecutors might declineto cross-examine a grand jury witness whom they fear will

talk to the target of the investigation nor the fact that they

5 For example, the party might not want to run the risk of appearing to
harass or upset a vulnerable witness--such as a young child or the victim
of a terrible crime--with rigorous cross-examination if there are other,
less confrontational means of undermining the suspect testimony.

6 As the Advisory Committee explained, the question whether prior testimony should be admitted is, in essence, the question "whether fairness
allows imposing, upon the party against whom now offered, the handling
of a witness on the earlier occasion." Id., at 788. When, as in this case,
the testimony is offered against the party by whom it was previously offered, the party obviously did not have an opportunity to develop the testimony through cross-examination. But, the Advisory Committee recognized, the opportunity to engage in "direct and redirect examination of
one's own witness [is] the equivalent of cross-examining an opponent's
witness." Id., at 789. In either case, as long as the party had a similar
motive to develop the testimony in the prior proceeding, there is no unfairness in requiring the party against whom the testimony is now offered to
accept her prior decision to develop or not develop the testimony fully.

might choose to undermine the witness' credibility otherthan through rigorous cross-examination alters the fact that

they had an opportunity and similar motive to challenge theallegedly false testimony through questioning before the
grand jury. Although those might be reasons for decliningto take advantage of the opportunity to cross-examine a witness, neither undermines the principal motive for engagingin cross-examination,

i. e., to shake the witness' allegedlyfalse or misleading testimony. Indeed, other courts have

found the "opportunity and similar motive" requirement ofRule 804(b)(1) satisfied--and hence the prior testimony admissible in a subsequent trial--in many similar situations.7That leaves the Government's third reason, its contention
that it lacks a similar motive to question grand jury wit7 See, e. g., United States v. Miller, 284 U. S. App. D. C. 245, 258, 904
F. 2d 65, 68 (1990) (prior grand jury testimony admissible against the Government because "as several circuits have recognized, the government had
the same motive and opportunity to question [the witness] when it brought
him before the grand jury as it does at trial. . . . Before the grand jury
and at trial, [the witness'] testimony was to be directed to the same
issue--the guilt or innocence of [the defendants]"); United States v. Pizarro, 717 F. 2d 336, 349-350 (CA7 1983) (initial trial testimony of one
defendant which exculpated the second defendant was admissible during
the retrial of the second defendant even though the Government may have
declined to cross-examine the first defendant about an issue for fear that
it would have resulted in a severance of the trials of the two defendants);
United States v. Poland, 659 F. 2d 884, 895-896 (CA9) (identification testimony of witness at suppression hearing admissible in subsequent trial because defendant would have a similar motive at both proceedings to show

nesses because the issues before the grand jury may not be
the same issues that are important at trial. If that were
true in a particular case, I would agree that the Government
lacked a similar motive for developing the witness' grand
jury testimony. Because the scope of questioning is necessarily limited by the scope of the legal and factual issues in
a given proceeding, a party has little motive, and indeed may
not be permitted, to ask questions about other issues. Thus
if those other issues become important in a subsequent proceeding, the testimony from the prior proceeding may properly be excluded on the ground that the party against whom
it is offered lacked a similar motive for developing the testimony at the prior proceeding.8

That did not occur in this case, however. After reviewing
the sealed transcripts of Bruno's and DeMatteis' grand jury
testimony, the Court of Appeals concluded that "[v]ery generally stated, their grand jury testimony denied any awareness of, let alone participation in," the "Club" of concrete
contractors, the existence of which was crucial to the RICO
counts dealing with fraud in the construction industry. 937

8 As Wigmore explained, the common law required identity of issues as
a means of ensuring that the cross-examination in the two proceedings
would have been directed at the same material points. 5 Wigmore, $ 1386,
at 90. Rule 804(b)(1) slightly modified the prior testimony exception to
the hearsay rule by substituting the "opportunity and similar motive" requirement for the identity-of-issues requirement. The drafters of the
Rule reasoned that "[s]ince identity of issues is significant only in that it
bears on motive and interest in developing fully the testimony of the witness, expressing the matter in the latter terms is preferable." Advisory
Committee's Notes on Rule 804(b)(1), at 789. Nevertheless, for the reasons discussed in the text, "[i]n determining whether a similar motive to
develop the testimony existed at the time of the elicitation of the former
testimony the courts will search for some substantial identity of issues."

F. 2d, at 808.9 Moreover, the transcripts reveal that theprosecutors did challenge some of the witnesses' denials of

knowledge of criminal activity by questioning which includedprobing the basis of their statements and confronting them
with contrary statements from other people.I am therefore satisfied that the Government had an "opportunity and similar motive" to develop the grand jurytestimony of witnesses Bruno and DeMatteis; consequently,
the transcript of that testimony was admissible against theGovernment at respondents' trial under Rule 804(b)(1). For
that reason, I would affirm the judgment of the Court ofAppeals.

9 "Indeed," the Court of Appeals explained, "the central importance of
the `club's' existence is probably why the government felt obligated to
identify Bruno and DeMatteis as sources of exculpatory testimony under
Brady v. Maryland[, 373 U. S. 83 (1963)]." 937 F. 2d, at 808.

SAWYER v. WHITLEY, WARDEN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 91-6382. Argued February 25, 1992--Decided June 22, 1992
A Louisiana jury convicted petitioner Sawyer and sentenced him to death

for a murder in which the victim was beaten, scalded with boiling water,
and set afire. His conviction and sentence were upheld on appeal, and
his petitions for state postconviction relief, as well as his first petition
for federal habeas relief, were denied. In a second federal habeas petition, the District Court barred as abusive or successive Sawyer's claims,
inter alia, that the police failed to produce exculpatory evidence--evidence challenging a prosecution witness' credibility and a child witness'
statements that Sawyer had tried to prevent an accomplice from setting
fire to the victim--in violation of his due process rights under Brady v.
Maryland, 373 U. S. 83; and that his trial counsel's failure to introduce
mental health records as mitigating evidence in his trial's sentencing
phase constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that Sawyer had not shown cause for failure to
raise his claims in his earlier petition, and that it could not otherwise
reach the claims' merits because he had not shown that he was "actually
innocent" of the death penalty under Louisiana law.

Held:

1. To show "actual innocence" one must show by clear and convincing
evidence that but for a constitutional error, no reasonable juror would
have found the petitioner eligible for the death penalty under the applicable state law. Pp. 338-347.

(a) Generally, a habeas petitioner must show cause and prejudice
before a court will reach the merits of a successive, abusive, or defaulted
claim. Even if he cannot meet this standard, a court may hear the
merits of such claims if failure to hear them would result in a miscarriage of justice. See, e. g., Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U. S. 436. The
miscarriage of justice exception applies where a petitioner is "actually
innocent" of the crime of which he was convicted or the penalty which
was imposed. While it is not easy to define what is meant by "actually
innocent" of the death penalty, the exception is very narrow and must
be determined by relatively objective standards. Pp. 338-341.

(b) In order to avoid arbitrary and capricious impositions of the
death sentence, States have adopted narrowing factors to limit the class
of offenders upon which the death penalty may be imposed, as evidenced

505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT
334 SAWYER v. WHITLEY

Syllabus
by Louisiana's definition of capital murder as something more than intentional killing and its requirement that before a jury may recommend
death, it must determine that at least one of a list of statutory aggravating factors exists. Once eligibility for the death penalty is established,
however, the emphasis shifts from narrowing the class of eligible defendants by objective factors to individualized consideration of a particular defendant by the introduction of mitigating evidence. Within this
framework, the Court of Appeals applied the proper standard to determine "actual innocence" when it required Sawyer to base his showing
that no reasonable juror would have found him eligible for the death
penalty under Louisiana law on the elements of the crime itself and the
existence of aggravating circumstances, but not the existence of additional mitigating evidence that was not introduced as a result of a
claimed constitutional error. This standard hones in on the objective
factors that must be shown to exist before a defendant is eligible to
have the death penalty imposed. The adoption of a stricter definition,
which would limit any showing to the elements of the crime, is rejected,
since, by stating in Smith v. Murray, 477 U. S. 527, 537, that actual
innocence could mean innocent of the death penalty, this Court suggested a more expansive meaning than simply innocence of the capital
offense itself. Also rejected is a more lenient definition, which would
allow the showing to extend beyond the elements of the crime and the
aggravating factors, to include mitigating evidence which bears, not on
the defendant's eligibility to receive the death penalty, but only on the
ultimate discretionary decision between that penalty and life imprisonment. Including mitigating factors would make actual innocence mean
little more than what is already required to show prejudice for purposes
of securing habeas relief and would broaden the inquiry beyond what is
a narrow exception to the principle of finality. Pp. 341-347.

2. Sawyer has failed to show that he is actually innocent of the death
penalty to which he has been sentenced. The psychological evidence
allegedly kept from the jury does not relate to his guilt or innocence of
the crime or to the aggravating factors found by the jury--that the
murder was committed in the course of an aggravated arson, and that
it was especially cruel, atrocious, or heinous--which made him eligible
for the death penalty. Nor can it be said that had this evidence been
before the jury a reasonable juror would not have found both of the
aggravating factors. The evidence allegedly kept from the jury due to
an alleged Brady violation also fails to show actual innocence. Latterday impeachment evidence seldom, if ever, makes a clear and convincing
showing that no reasonable juror would have believed the heart of the
witness' account. While the statement that Sawyer did not set fire to
the victim goes to the jury's finding of aggravated arson and, thus, to

Opinion of the Court
his guilt or innocence and the first aggravating circumstance, it fails to
show that no rational juror would find both of the aggravating factors.
The murder was especially cruel, atrocious, and heinous quite apart
from the arson, and, even crediting the hearsay statement, it cannot be
said that no reasonable juror would have found that he was guilty of the
arson for his participation under Louisiana law. Pp. 347-350.

Opinion of the Court
federal habeas petition containing successive and abusiveclaims. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit refused

to examine the merits of Sawyer's claims. It held that Saw-yer had not shown cause for failure to raise these claims in
his earlier petition, and that he had not shown that he was"actually innocent" of the crime of which he was convicted
or the penalty which was imposed. 945 F. 2d 812 (1991).We affirm the Court of Appeals and hold that to show "actual
innocence" one must show by clear and convincing evidencethat, but for a constitutional error, no reasonable juror would
have found the petitioner eligible for the death penalty underthe applicable state law.

In 1979--13 years ago--petitioner and his accomplice,Charles Lane, brutally murdered Frances Arwood, who was
a guest in the home petitioner shared with his girlfriend,Cynthia Shano, and Shano's two young children. As we recounted in our earlier review of this case, Sawyer v. Smith,497 U. S. 227 (1990), petitioner and Lane returned to petitioner's home after a night of drinking and argued with Ar-wood, accusing her of drugging one of the children. Petitioner and Lane then attacked Arwood, beat her with theirfists, kicked her repeatedly, submerged her in the bathtub,
and poured scalding water on her before dragging her backinto the living room, pouring lighter fluid on her body and
igniting it. Arwood lost consciousness sometime during theattack and remained in a coma until she died of her injuries
approximately two months later. Shano and her childrenwere in the home during the attack, and Shano testified that
petitioner prevented them from leaving.1At trial, the jury failed to credit petitioner's "toxic psychosis" defense, and convicted petitioner of first-degree mur-der. At the sentencing phase, petitioner testified that he
was intoxicated at the time of the murder and remembered

petitioner to death.2Sawyer's conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal

offense was committed in an especially cruel, atrocious and heinous manner, and (3) that [Sawyer] had previously been convicted of an unrelated
murder." Id., at 100. The Louisiana Supreme Court held that the last
aggravating circumstance was not supported by the evidence. Id., at 101.

338 SAWYER v. WHITLEY

Opinion of the Court
Petitioner next filed a second motion for state postconviction
relief. The state trial court summarily denied this petition
as repetitive and without merit, and the Louisiana Supreme
Court denied discretionary review. See 945 F. 2d, at 815.

The present petition before this Court arises out of Sawyer's second petition for federal habeas relief. After granting a stay and holding an evidentiary hearing, the District
Court denied one of Sawyer's claims on the merits and held
that the others were barred as either abusive or successive.
772 F. Supp. 297 (ED La. 1991). The Court of Appeals
granted a certificate of probable cause on the issue whether
petitioner had shown that he is actually "innocent of the
death penalty" such that a court should reach the merits of
the claims contained in this successive petition. 945 F. 2d,
at 814. The Court of Appeals held that petitioner had failed
to show that he was actually innocent of the death penalty
because the evidence he argued had been unconstitutionally
kept from the jury failed to show that Sawyer was ineligible
for the death penalty under Louisiana law. For the third
time we granted Sawyer's petition for certiorari, 502 U. S.
965 (1991), and we now affirm.

Unless a habeas petitioner shows cause and prejudice, see
Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72 (1977), a court may not
reach the merits of: (a) successive claims that raise grounds
identical to grounds heard and decided on the merits in a
previous petition, Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U. S. 436 (1986);
(b) new claims, not previously raised, which constitute an
abuse of the writ, McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991);
or (c) procedurally defaulted claims in which the petitioner
failed to follow applicable state procedural rules in raising
the claims, Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478 (1986). These

cases are premised on our concerns for the finality of state
judgments of conviction and the "significant costs of federal
habeas review." McCleskey, supra, at 490-491; see, e. g.,
Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 126-128 (1982).

Opinion of the Court
We have previously held that even if a state prisonercannot meet the cause and prejudice standard, a federal

court may hear the merits of the successive claims if thefailure to hear the claims would constitute a "miscarriage of
justice." In a trio of 1986 decisions, we elaborated on the
miscarriage of justice, or "actual innocence," exception. Aswe explained in

Kuhlmann v. Wilson, supra, the exception
developed from the language of the federal habeas statute,which, prior to 1966, allowed successive claims to be denied

without a hearing if the judge were "satisfied that the ends
of justice will not be served by such inquiry." Id., at 448.
We held that despite the removal of this statutory languagefrom 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(b) in 1966, the miscarriage of justice

exception would allow successive claims to be heard if the
petitioner "establish[es] that under the probative evidencehe has a colorable claim of factual innocence."

Kuhlmann,
supra, at 454.5 In the second of these cases we held that
the actual innocence exception also applies to procedurally
defaulted claims. Murray v. Carrier, supra.6

In Smith v. Murray, 477 U. S. 527 (1986), we found no miscarriage of justice in the failure to examine the merits of
procedurally defaulted claims in the capital sentencing context. We emphasized that the miscarriage of justice exception is concerned with actual as compared to legal innocence,

5 Our standard for determining actual innocence was articulated in
Kuhlmann as: "[T]he prisoner must `show a fair probability that, in light
of all the evidence, including that alleged to have been illegally admitted
(but with due regard to any unreliability of it) and evidence tenably
claimed to have been wrongly excluded or to have become available only
after the trial, the trier of the facts would have entertained a reasonable
doubt of his guilt.' " 477 U. S., at 455, n. 17, quoting Friendly, Is Innocence Irrelevant? Collateral Attack on Criminal Judgments, 38 U. Chi.
L. Rev. 142, 160 (1970).

6 We stated that the merits of a defaulted claim could be reached "in an

extraordinary case, where a constitutional violation has probably resulted
in the conviction of one who is actually innocent . . . ." Murray v. Carrier,
477 U. S., at 496.

340 SAWYER v. WHITLEY

Opinion of the Court
and acknowledged that actual innocence "does not translateeasily into the context of an alleged error at the sentencing

phase of a trial on a capital offense." Id., at 537. We de-cided that the habeas petitioner in that case had failed to
show actual innocence of the death penalty because the "alleged constitutional error neither precluded the developmentof true facts nor resulted in the admission of false ones."

Id., at 538.In subsequent cases, we have emphasized the narrow
scope of the fundamental miscarriage of justice exception.In

Dugger v. Adams, 489 U. S. 401 (1989), we rejected the
petitioner's claim that his procedural default should be excused because he had shown that he was actually innocent.
Without endeavoring to define what it meant to be actually
innocent of the death penalty, we stated that "[d]emonstrating that an error is by its nature the kind of error that might
have affected the accuracy of a death sentence is far from
demonstrating that an individual defendant probably is `actually innocent' of the sentence he or she received." Id., at
412, n. 6. Just last Term in McCleskey v. Zant, supra, at
502, we held that the "narrow exception" for miscarriage of
justice was of no avail to the petitioner because the constitutional violation, if it occurred, "resulted in the admission at
trial of truthful inculpatory evidence which did not affect the
reliability of the guilt determination."

The present case requires us to further amplify the meaning of "actual innocence" in the setting of capital punishment.
A prototypical example of "actual innocence" in a colloquial
sense is the case where the State has convicted the wrong
person of the crime. Such claims are of course regularly
made on motions for new trial after conviction in both state
and federal courts, and quite regularly denied because the
evidence adduced in support of them fails to meet the rigorous standards for granting such motions. But in rare instances it may turn out later, for example, that another
person has credibly confessed to the crime, and it is evident

Opinion of the Court
that the law has made a mistake. In the context of a non-capital case, the concept of "actual innocence" is easy to

grasp.It is more difficult to develop an analogous framework
when dealing with a defendant who has been sentenced todeath. The phrase "innocent of death" is not a natural
usage of those words, but we must strive to construct ananalog to the simpler situation represented by the case of a
noncapital defendant. In defining this analog, we bear inmind that the exception for "actual innocence" is a very narrow exception, and that to make it workable it must be sub-ject to determination by relatively objective standards. In
the every day context of capital penalty proceedings, a fed-eral district judge typically will be presented with a successive or abusive habeas petition a few days before, or even onthe day of, a scheduled execution, and will have only a limited time to determine whether a petitioner has shown thathis case falls within the "actual innocence" exception if such
a claim is made.7Since our decision in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238
(1972), our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence has requiredthose States imposing capital punishment to adopt procedural safeguards protecting against arbitrary and capriciousimpositions of the death sentence. See, e. g., Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153 (1976); Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U. S. 242(1976);

Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S. 262 (1976). In response, theStates have adopted various narrowing factors that limit the

7 While we recognize this as a fact on the basis of our own experience
with applications for stays of execution in capital cases, we regard it as a
regrettable fact. We of course do not in the least condone, but instead
condemn, any efforts on the part of habeas petitioners to delay their filings
until the last minute with a view to obtaining a stay because the district
court will lack time to give them the necessary consideration before the
scheduled execution. A court may resolve against such a petitioner
doubts and uncertainties as to the sufficiency of his submission. See
Gomez v. United States Dist. Court for Northern Dist. of Cal., 503 U. S.
653 (1992) (per curiam).

Opinion of the Court
class of offenders upon which the sentencer is authorized toimpose the death penalty. For example, the Louisiana statute under which petitioner was convicted defines first-degreemurder, a capital offense, as something more than intentional
killing.8 In addition, after a defendant is found guilty inLouisiana of capital murder, the jury must also find at the
sentencing phase beyond a reasonable doubt at least one of
a list of statutory aggravating factors before it may recom-mend that the death penalty be imposed.

9

But once eligibility for the death penalty has been estab-lished to the satisfaction of the jury, its deliberations assume

a different tenor. In a series of cases beginning with Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 604 (1978), we have held that the

8 Louisiana Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 14:30 (West 1986 and Supp. 1992) defines
first-degree murder:
"First degree murder is the killing of a human being:

"(1) When the offender has specific intent to kill or to inflict great bodily
harm and is engaged in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of
aggravated kidnapping, second degree kidnapping, aggravated escape,
aggravated arson, aggravated rape, forcible rape, aggravated burglary,
armed robbery, first degree robbery or simple robbery;

"(2) When the offender has a specific intent to kill or to inflict great
bodily harm upon a fireman or peace officer engaged in the performance
of his lawful duties;

"(3) When the offender has a specific intent to kill or to inflict great
bodily harm upon more than one person; or

"(4) When the offender has specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily
harm and has offered, has been offered, has given, or has received anything of value for the killing.. . . . .

"Whoever commits the crime of first degree murder shall be punished
by death or life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence in accordance with the determination of
the jury."

9 At the time of petitioner's trial La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 905.3

(West 1984), provided: "A sentence of death shall not be imposed unless
the jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt that at least one statutory aggravating circumstance exists and, after consideration of any mitigating circumstances, recommends that the sentence of death be imposed."

Opinion of the Court
defendant must be permitted to introduce a wide variety of
mitigating evidence pertaining to his character and background. The emphasis shifts from narrowing the class of
eligible defendants by objective factors to individualized
consideration of a particular defendant. Consideration of
aggravating factors together with mitigating factors, in various combinations and methods dependent upon state law, results in the jury's or judge's ultimate decision as to what
penalty shall be imposed.

Considering Louisiana law as an example, then, there are
three possible ways in which "actual innocence" might be
defined. The strictest definition would be to limit any showing to the elements of the crime which the State has made a
capital offense. The showing would have to negate an essential element of that offense. The Solicitor General, filing
as amicus curiae in support of respondent, urges the Court
to adopt this standard. We reject this submission as too
narrow, because it is contrary to the statement in Smith that
the concept of "actual innocence" could be applied to mean
"innocent" of the death penalty. 477 U. S., at 537. This
statement suggested a more expansive meaning to the term
of "actual innocence" in a capital case than simply innocence
of the capital offense itself.

The most lenient of the three possibilities would be to
allow the showing of "actual innocence" to extend not only
to the elements of the crime, but also to the existence of
aggravating factors, and to mitigating evidence that bore not
on the defendant's eligibility to receive the death penalty,
but only on the ultimate discretionary decision between the
death penalty and life imprisonment. This, in effect, is what
petitioner urges upon us. He contends that actual innocence
of the death penalty exists where "there is a `fair probability'
that the admission of false evidence, or the preclusion of true
mitigating evidence, [caused by a constitutional error] resulted in a sentence of death." Brief for Petitioner 18 (cita505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT

tion and footnote omitted).10 Although petitioner describeshis standard as narrower than that adopted by the Eighth

and Ninth Circuits,11 in reality it is only more closely relatedto the facts of his case in which he alleges that constitutional
error kept true mitigating evidence from the jury. The cru-cial consideration, according to petitioner, is whether due to
constitutional error the sentencer was presented with " `a
factually inaccurate sentencing profile' " of the petitioner.Brief for Petitioner 15, n. 21, quoting Johnson v. Singletary,

938 F. 2d 1166, 1200 (CA11 1991) (en banc) (Anderson, J.,dissenting).

Insofar as petitioner's standard would include not merelythe elements of the crime itself, but the existence of aggravating circumstances, it broadens the extent of the inquirybut not the type of inquiry. Both the elements of the crime
and statutory aggravating circumstances in Louisiana are

10 Petitioner's standard derives from language in Smith v. Murray, 477
U. S. 527 (1986). Petitioner maintains that Smith holds that if one can
show that the error precludes the development of true mitigating evidence, actual innocence has been shown. Brief for Petitioner 21. By emphasizing that in Smith the fundamental miscarriage of justice exception
had not been met because, inter alia, the constitutional error did not lead
the jury to consider any false evidence, we did not hold its converse, that
an error which leads to the consideration of "false" mitigating evidence
amounts to a miscarriage of justice.

11 In Deutscher v. Whitley, 946 F. 2d 1443 (1991), the Ninth Circuit

phrased its test as follows: "To establish a fundamental miscarriage of
justice at sentencing, a defendant must establish that constitutional error
substantially undermined the accuracy of the capital sentencing determination. This requires a showing that constitutional error infected the
sentencing process to such a degree that it is more probable than not that,
but for constitutional error, the sentence of death would not have been
imposed." Id., at 1446 (citations omitted).

The Eighth Circuit has adopted a similar test: " `In the penalty-phase
context, this exception will be available if the federal constitutional error
alleged probably resulted in a verdict of death against one whom the jury
would otherwise have sentenced to life imprisonment.' " Stokes v. Armontrout, 893 F. 2d 152, 156 (1989), quoting Smith v. Armontrout, 888 F. 2d
530, 545 (1989).

Opinion of the Court
used to narrow the class of defendants eligible for the deathpenalty. And proof or disproof of aggravating circumstances, like proof of the elements of the crime, is confinedby the statutory definitions to a relatively obvious class of
relevant evidence. Sensible meaning is given to the term"innocent of the death penalty" by allowing a showing in
addition to innocence of the capital crime itself a showingthat there was no aggravating circumstance or that some
other condition of eligibility had not been met.12But we reject petitioner's submission that the showing
should extend beyond these elements of the capital sentenceto the existence of additional mitigating evidence. In the
first place, such an extension would mean that "actual inno-cence" amounts to little more than what is already required
to show "prejudice," a necessary showing for habeas relieffor many constitutional errors. See,

e. g., United States v.
Bagley, 473 U. S. 667, 682 (1985); Strickland v. Washington,466 U. S. 668, 694 (1984). If federal habeas review of capital

sentences is to be at all rational, petitioner must show some-thing more in order for a court to reach the merits of his
claims on a successive habeas petition than he would havehad to show to obtain relief on his first habeas petition.

13

But, more importantly, petitioner's standard would sobroaden the inquiry as to make it anything but a "narrow"

exception to the principle of finality that we have previouslydescribed it to be. A federal district judge confronted with

12 Louisiana narrows the class of those eligible for the death penalty by
limiting the type of offense for which it may be imposed, and by requiring
a finding of at least one aggravating circumstance. See supra, at 342.
Statutory provisions for restricting eligibility may, of course, vary from
State to State.

13 If a showing of actual innocence were reduced to actual prejudice, it

would allow the evasion of the cause and prejudice standard which we
have held also acts as an "exception" to a defaulted, abusive, or successive
claim. In practical terms a petitioner would no longer have to show
cause, contrary to our prior cases. McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 494-
495 (1991); Carrier, 477 U. S., at 493.

346 SAWYER v. WHITLEY

Opinion of the Court
a claim of actual innocence may with relative ease determinewhether a submission, for example, that a killing was not

intentional, consists of credible, noncumulative, and admissi-ble evidence negating the element of intent. But it is a far
more difficult task to assess how jurors would have reactedto additional showings of mitigating factors, particularly considering the breadth of those factors that a jury under ourdecisions must be allowed to consider.

14

The Court of Appeals in this case took the middle groundamong these three possibilities for defining "actual innocence" of the death penalty, and adopted this test:

"[W]e must require the petitioner to show, based on theevidence proffered plus all record evidence, a fair probability that a rational trier of fact would have entertaineda reasonable doubt as to the existence of those facts
which are prerequisites under state or federal law forthe imposition of the death penalty." 945 F. 2d, at 820
(footnotes omitted).
14 The "clearly-erroneous" standard suggested by Justice Stevens'
opinion concurring in the judgment suffers from this weakness and others
as well. The term "clearly erroneous" derives from Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 52(a), which provides that "findings of fact [in actions tried
without a jury] shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous." Justice
Stevens wrenches the term out of this context--where it applies to written factual findings made by a trial judge--and would apply it to the imposition of the death sentence by a jury or judge. Not only is the latter
determination different both quantitatively and qualitatively from a finding of fact in a bench trial, but Justice Stevens would not even bring
with the term its established meaning in reviewing factfindings in bench
trials. We held in United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U. S.
364, 395 (1948), and reaffirmed in Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U. S.
564, 573 (1985), that " `[a] finding is "clearly erroneous" when although
there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence
is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.' " But Justice Stevens would apparently equate it with the
standard traditionally used for review of jury verdicts--that no reasonable
sentencer could have imposed the death penalty. Post, at 371. Cf. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 316-318 (1979).

Opinion of the Court
The Court of Appeals standard therefore hones in on theobjective factors or conditions that must be shown to exist

before a defendant is eligible to have the death penalty im-posed. The Eleventh Circuit has adopted a similar "eligibility" test for determining actual innocence. Johnson v. Singletary, 938 F. 2d 1166 (1991), cert. pending, No. 91-6576.15We agree with the Courts of Appeals for the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits that the "actual innocence" requirement mustfocus on those elements that render a defendant eligible for
the death penalty, and not on additional mitigating evidencethat was prevented from being introduced as a result of a
claimed constitutional error.In the present petition, Sawyer advances two claims, arising from two distinct groups of evidentiary facts that werenot considered by the jury that convicted and sentenced
Sawyer. The first group of evidence relates to petitioner'srole in the offense and consists of affidavits attacking the
credibility of Cynthia Shano and an affidavit claiming thatone of Shano's sons told a police officer that Sawyer was not
responsible for pouring lighter fluid on Arwood and lightingit, and that in fact Sawyer tried to prevent Charles Lane
from lighting Arwood on fire. Sawyer claims that the policefailed to produce this exculpatory evidence in violation of his
due process rights under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83(1963). The second group consists of medical records from
Sawyer's stays as a teenager in two different mental health

15 The Eleventh Circuit articulated the following test:
"Thus, a petitioner may make a colorable showing that he is actually innocent of the death penalty by presenting evidence that an alleged constitutional error implicates all of the aggravating factors found to be present
by the sentencing body. That is, but for the alleged constitutional error,
the sentencing body could not have found any aggravating factors and
thus the petitioner was ineligible for the death penalty. In other words,
the petitioner must show that absent the alleged constitutional error, the
jury would have lacked the discretion to impose the death penalty; that is,
that he is ineligible for the death penalty." Johnson v. Singletary, 938
F. 2d, at 1183 (emphasis in original).

institutions. Sawyer alleges ineffective assistance of counsel in trial counsel's failure to introduce these records in the
sentencing phase of his trial.

The Court of Appeals held that petitioner's failure to assert his Brady claim in his first petition constituted an abuse
of the writ, and that he had not shown cause for failing to
raise the claim earlier under McCleskey. 945 F. 2d, at 824.
The ineffective-assistance claim was held by the Court of Appeals to be a successive claim because it was rejected on the
merits in Sawyer's first petition, and petitioner failed to
show cause for not bringing all the evidence in support of
this claim earlier. Id., at 823. Petitioner does not contest
these findings of the Court of Appeals. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7.
Therefore, we must determine if petitioner has shown by
clear and convincing evidence that but for constitutional
error, no reasonable juror would find him eligible for the
death penalty under Louisiana law.

Under Louisiana law, petitioner is eligible for the death
penalty because he was convicted of first-degree murder--
that is, an intentional killing while in the process of committing an aggravated arson--and because at the sentencing
phase the jury found two valid aggravating circumstances:
that the murder was committed in the course of an aggravated arson, and that the murder was especially cruel, atrocious, and heinous. The psychological evidence petitioner
alleges was kept from the jury due to the ineffective assistance of counsel does not relate to petitioner's guilt or innocence of the crime.16 Neither does it relate to either of the
aggravating factors found by the jury that made petitioner
eligible for the death penalty. Even if this evidence had
been before the jury, it cannot be said that a reasonable juror
would not have found both of the aggravating factors that

make petitioner eligible for the death penalty.17 Therefore,as to this evidence, petitioner has not shown that there

would be a fundamental miscarriage of justice for the Courtto fail to reexamine the merits of this successive claim.

We are convinced that the evidence allegedly kept fromthe jury due to an alleged

Brady violation also fails to showthat the petitioner is actually innocent of the death penalty

to which he has been sentenced. Much of the evidence goesto the credibility of Shano, suggesting, e. g., that contrary to
her testimony at trial she knew Charles Lane prior to theday of the murder; that she was drinking the day before the
murder; and that she testified under a grant of immunityfrom the prosecutor. 2 App. 589-608. This sort of latterday evidence brought forward to impeach a prosecution wit-ness will seldom, if ever, make a clear and convincing showing that no reasonable juror would have believed the heartof Shano's account of petitioner's actions.

The final bit of evidence petitioner alleges was unconstitu-tionally kept from the jury due to a

Brady violation was astatement made by Shano's then 4-year-old son, Wayne, to a

police officer the day after the murder. Petitioner has sub-mitted an affidavit from one Diane Thibodeaux stating that
she was present when Wayne told a police detective whoasked who had lit Arwood on fire that "Daddy [Sawyer] tried
to help the lady" and that the "other man" had pushed Saw-yer back into a chair. 2 App. 587. The affidavit also states
that Wayne showed the officer where to find a cigarettelighter and a can of lighter fluid in the trash. Ibid. Because this evidence goes to the jury's finding of aggravatedarson, it goes both to petitioner's guilt or innocence of the
crime of first-degree murder and the aggravating circum-stance of a murder committed in the course of an aggravated
arson. However, we conclude that this affidavit, in view of

17 In the same category are the affidavits from petitioner's family members attesting to the deprivation and abuse suffered by petitioner as a
child. 2 App. 571-584.

all the other evidence in the record, does not show that norational juror would find that petitioner committed both of

the aggravating circumstances found by the jury. The mur-der was especially cruel, atrocious, and heinous based on the
undisputed evidence of torture before the jury quite apartfrom the arson (

e. g., beating, scalding with boiling water).As for the finding of aggravated arson, we agree with the

Court of Appeals that, even crediting the information in thehearsay affidavit,

18 it cannot be said that no reasonable juror

would have found, in light of all the evidence, that petitionerwas guilty of the aggravated arson for his participation

under the Louisiana law of principals.19We therefore hold that petitioner has failed to show by
clear and convincing evidence that but for constitutionalerror at his sentencing hearing, no reasonable juror would
have found him eligible for the death penalty under Louisi-ana law. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore

Affirmed.
Justice Blackmun, concurring in the judgment.
I cannot agree with the majority that a federal court isabsolutely barred from reviewing a capital defendant's abu18 Wayne Shano apparently has no clear memory of the crime today. Id.,
at 602-603. This fact, together with his tender years at the time of the
occurrence, suggests that Wayne himself would not corroborate the affidavit of Diane Thibodeaux, thus suggesting an independent basis for refusing to find that the affidavit showed anything by clear and convincing
evidence.

19 Louisiana Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 14:24 (West 1986) defines principals as: "All

persons concerned in the commission of a crime . . . and whether they
directly commit the act constituting the offense, aid and abet in its commission, or directly or indirectly counsel or procure another to commit the
crime, are principals."

Even considering the affidavit of Wayne Shano, it cannot be said that no
reasonable juror would have found that petitioner committed the aggravated arson, given Cynthia Shano's testimony as to petitioner's statements
to Lane on the day of the murder and petitioner's fingerprints on the can
of lighter fluid.

sive, successive, or procedurally defaulted claim unless thedefendant can show "by clear and convincing evidence that,

but for a constitutional error, no reasonable juror would havefound the petitioner eligible for the death penalty under the
applicable state law." Ante, at 336. For the reasons statedby

Justice Stevens in his separate opinion, post, p. 360,which I join, I believe that the Court today adopts an unduly

cramped view of "actual innocence." I write separately notto discuss the specifics of the Court's standard, but instead
to reemphasize my opposition to an implicit premise underly-ing the Court's decision: that the only "fundamental miscarriage of justice" in a capital proceeding that warrants redressis one where the petitioner can make out a claim of "actual
innocence." I also write separately to express my ever-growing skepticism that, with each new decision from this
Court constricting the ability of the federal courts to remedyconstitutional errors, the death penalty really can be imposed fairly and in accordance with the requirements of theEighth Amendment.

I
The Court repeatedly has recognized that principles offundamental fairness underlie the writ of habeas corpus.

See Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 126 (1982); Sanders v.
United States, 373 U. S. 1, 17-18 (1963). Even as the Courthas erected unprecedented and unwarranted barriers to the

federal judiciary's review of the merits of claims that stateprisoners failed properly to present to the state courts, or
failed to raise in their first federal habeas petitions, or pre-viously presented to the federal courts for resolution, it consistently has acknowledged that exceptions to these rules ofunreviewability must exist to prevent violations of fundamental fairness. See Engle, 456 U. S., at 135 (principles offinality and comity "must yield to the imperative of correcting a fundamentally unjust incarceration"). Thus, the Courthas held, federal courts may review procedurally defaulted,
abusive, or successive claims absent a showing of cause and

prejudice if the failure to do so would thwart the "ends ofjustice," see

Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U. S. 436, 455 (1986)
(plurality opinion), or work a "fundamental miscarriage ofjustice," see

Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 495-496
(1986); Smith v. Murray, 477 U. S. 527, 537-538 (1986); Dugger v. Adams, 489 U. S. 401, 412, n. 6 (1989); McCleskey v.
Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 493-494 (1991).

By the traditional understanding of habeas corpus, a "fun-damental miscarriage of justice" occurs whenever a conviction or sentence is secured in violation of a federal constitu-tional right. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(a) (federal courts "shall
entertain" habeas petitions from state prisoners who allege
that they are "in custody in violation of the Constitution
or laws or treaties of the United States"); Smith, 477 U. S.,
at 543-544 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Justice Holmes explained that the concern of a federal court in reviewing the
validity of a conviction and death sentence on a writ of
habeas corpus is "solely the question whether [the petitioner's] constitutional rights have been preserved." Moore v.
Dempsey, 261 U. S. 86, 88 (1923).

In a trio of 1986 decisions, however, the Court ignored
these traditional teachings and, out of a purported concern
for state sovereignty, for the preservation of state resources,
and for the finality of state-court judgments, shifted the focus of federal habeas review of procedurally defaulted, successive, or abusive claims away from the preservation of constitutional rights to a fact-based inquiry into the petitioner's
innocence or guilt. See Wilson, 477 U. S., at 454 (plurality
opinion) ("[T]he `ends of justice' require federal courts to entertain [successive] petitions only where the prisoner supplements his constitutional claim with a colorable showing of
factual innocence"); Carrier, 477 U. S., at 496 ("[I]n an extraordinary case, where a constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent, a federal habeas court may grant the writ even in the
absence of a showing of cause for the procedural default");

Smith, 477 U. S., at 537 (applying Carrier standard to constitutional error at sentencing phase of capital trial). See also
McCleskey, 499 U. S., at 493 (applying Carrier standard in
"abuse of the writ" context).

The Court itself has acknowledged that "the concept of
`actual,' as distinct from `legal,' innocence does not translate
easily into the context of an alleged error at the sentencing
phase of a trial on a capital offense." Smith, 477 U. S., at
537. Undaunted by its own illogic, however, the Court
adopted just such an approach in Smith. There, the Court
was confronted with a claim that the introduction at sentencing of inculpatory statements made by Smith to a courtappointed psychiatrist violated the Fifth Amendment because Smith had not been informed that his statements
might be used against him or that he had the right to remain
silent and to have counsel present. Although the Court assumed the validity of Smith's Fifth Amendment claim 1 and

recognized the potential impact of the statement on the jury,
which found the aggravating circumstance of "future dangerousness" satisfied, see id., at 538, it nonetheless concluded,
remarkably and summarily, that admission of the statement
did not "pervert the jury's deliberations concerning the ultimate question whether in fact petitioner constituted a continuing threat to society," ibid. (emphasis in original). Because Michael Smith could not demonstrate cause for his
procedural default, and because, in the Court's view, he had
not made a substantial showing that the alleged constitutional violation "undermined the accuracy of the guilt or sentencing determination," id., at 539, his Fifth Amendment
claim went unaddressed and he was executed on July 31,
1986.

1 Justice Stevens explained in his dissenting opinion in Smith, 477
U. S., at 551-553, that the introduction of the inculpatory statement clearly
violated Smith's rights as established in Estelle v. Smith, 451 U. S. 454
(1981).

Eighth Amendment and Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U. S.320 (1985), that their sentencing vote was strictly advisory
in nature (when in fact Florida law permitted the judge tooverturn the jury's sentencing decision only upon a clear and
convincing showing that its choice was erroneous), surely
satisfied the standard articulated in Smith: whether petitioner can make out a "substantial claim that the alleged
error undermined the accuracy of the guilt or sentencing determination." 477 U. S., at 539. In a cryptic discussion relegated to a footnote at the end of its opinion, the Court in
Adams rejected this obvious application of the Smith standard, apparently for no other reason than its belief that
Adams' ability to demonstrate a "fundamental miscarriage of
justice" in this case somehow would convert an "extraordinary" exception into an "ordinary" one. See 489 U. S., at
412, n. 6. In rejecting the Smith standard, the Court did
not even bother to substitute another in its place. See 489
U. S., at 412, n. 6 ("We do not undertake here to define what
it means to be `actually innocent' of a death sentence"). The
Court refused to address Aubrey Adams' claim of constitutional error, and he was executed on May 4, 1989.

Just last Term, in McCleskey v. Zant, the Court again described the "fundamental miscarriage of justice" exception
as a " `safeguard against compelling an innocent man to
suffer an unconstitutional loss of liberty,' " 499 U. S., at 495
(quoting Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 491-492, n. 31 (1976)).
Although the District Court granted relief to McCleskey on
his claim that state authorities deliberately had elicited
inculpatory admissions from him in violation of his Sixth

Amendment right to counsel, see Massiah v. United States,377 U. S. 201 (1964), and excused his failure to present the

claim in his first federal habeas petition because the Statehad withheld documents and information establishing that
claim, see 499 U. S., at 475-476, the Court concluded that
McCleskey lacked cause for failing to raise the claim earlier,
id., at 502. More important for our purposes, the Court concluded that the "narrow exception" by which federal courtsmay "exercise [their] equitable discretion to correct a miscarriage of justice" was of "no avail" to McCleskey: The "Massiah violation, if it be one, resulted in the admission at trial
of truthful inculpatory evidence which did not affect the reliability of the guilt determination." Ibid. The Court refused to address Warren McCleskey's claim of constitutional
error, and he was executed on September 24, 1991.

The Court today takes for granted that the foregoing decisions correctly limited the concept of a "fundamental miscarriage of justice" to "actual innocence," even as it struggles,
by ignoring the "natural usage of those words" and resorting
to "analog[s]," see ante, at 341, to make sense of "actual innocence" in the capital context. I continue to believe, however, that the Court's "exaltation of accuracy as the only
characteristic of `fundamental fairness' is deeply flawed."
Smith, 477 U. S., at 545 (Stevens, J., dissenting).

As an initial matter, the Court's focus on factual innocence
is inconsistent with Congress' grant of habeas corpus jurisdiction, pursuant to which federal courts are instructed to
entertain petitions from state prisoners who allege that they
are held "in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws
or treaties of the United States." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(a). The
jurisdictional grant contains no support for the Court's decision to narrow the reviewing authority and obligation of the
federal courts to claims of factual innocence. See also 28
U. S. C. $ 2243 ("The court shall . . . dispose of the matter as
law and justice require"). In addition, the actual innocence
standard requires a reviewing federal court, unnaturally, to

Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment
"function in much the same capacity as the state trier of
fact"; that is, to "make a rough decision on the question of
guilt or innocence." Wilson, 477 U. S., at 471, n. 7 (Brennan,
J., dissenting).

Most important, however, the focus on innocence assumes,
erroneously, that the only value worth protecting through
federal habeas review is the accuracy and reliability of the
guilt determination. But "[o]ur criminal justice system, and
our Constitution, protect other values in addition to the reliability of the guilt or innocence determination, and the statutory duty to serve `law and justice' should similarly reflect
those values." Smith, 477 U. S., at 545 (Stevens, J., dissenting). The accusatorial system of justice adopted by the
Founders affords a defendant certain process-based protections that do not have accuracy of truth finding as their primary goal. These protections--including the Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination, the Eighth
Amendment right against the imposition of an arbitrary and
capricious sentence, the Fourteenth Amendment right to be
tried by an impartial judge, and the Fourteenth Amendment
right not to be indicted by a grand jury or tried by a petit
jury from which members of the defendant's race have been
systematically excluded--are debased, and indeed, rendered
largely irrelevant, in a system that values the accuracy of
the guilt determination above individual rights.

Nowhere is this single-minded focus on actual innocence
more misguided than in a case where a defendant alleges a
constitutional error in the sentencing phase of a capital trial.
The Court's ongoing struggle to give meaning to "innocence
of death" simply reflects the inappropriateness of the inquiry.
See Smith, 477 U. S., at 537; Adams, 489 U. S., at 412, n. 6;
ante, at 340. "Guilt or innocence is irrelevant in that context; rather, there is only a decision made by representatives
of the community whether the prisoner shall live or die."
Wilson, 477 U. S., at 471-472, n. 7 (Brennan, J., dissenting).

Only by returning to the federal courts' central and tradi-tional function on habeas review, evaluating claims of constitutional error, can the Court ensure that the ends of justiceare served and that fundamental miscarriages of justice do
not go unremedied. The Court would do well to heed Jus-tice Black's admonition: "[I]t is never too late for courts in
habeas corpus proceedings to look straight through proce-dural screens in order to prevent forfeiture of life or liberty
in flagrant defiance of the Constitution." Brown v. Allen,344 U. S. 443, 554 (1953) (dissenting opinion).

A

When I was on the United States Court of Appeals for theEighth Circuit, I once observed, in the course of reviewing a

death sentence on a writ of habeas corpus, that the decisionalprocess in a capital case is "particularly excruciating" for
someone "who is not personally convinced of the rightnessof capital punishment and who questions it as an effective
deterrent." Maxwell v. Bishop, 398 F. 2d 138, 153-154(1968), vacated, 398 U. S. 262 (1970). At the same time, however, I stated my then belief that "the advisability of capitalpunishment is a policy matter ordinarily to be resolved by
the legislature." Id., at 154. Four years later, as a Memberof this Court, I echoed those sentiments in my separate dissenting opinion in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, 405(1972). Although I reiterated my personal distaste for the

2 Notwithstanding my view that the Court has erred in narrowing the
concept of a "fundamental miscarriage of justice" to cases of "actual innocence," I have attempted faithfully to apply the "actual innocence" standard in prior cases. See, e. g., Dugger v. Adams, 489 U. S. 401, 424, n. 15
(1989) (dissenting opinion). I therefore join Justice Stevens' analysis
of the "actual innocence" standard and his application of that standard to
the facts of this case. See post, p. 360.

death penalty and my doubt that it performs any meaningfuldeterrent function, see id., at 405-406, I declined to join my

Brethren in declaring the state statutes at issue in thosecases unconstitutional. See id., at 411 ("We should not allow
our personal preferences as to the wisdom of legislative andcongressional action, or our distaste for such action, to guide
our judicial decision").My ability in

Maxwell, Furman, and the many other capi-tal cases I have reviewed during my tenure on the federal

bench to enforce, notwithstanding my own deep moral res-ervations, a legislature's considered judgment that capital
punishment is an appropriate sanction, has always rested onan understanding that certain procedural safeguards, chief
among them the Federal Judiciary's power to reach and cor-rect claims of constitutional error on federal habeas review,
would ensure that death sentences are fairly imposed.Today, more than 20 years later, I wonder what is left of that
premise underlying my acceptance of the death penalty.

B
Only last Term I had occasion to lament the Court's contin-uing "crusade to erect petty procedural barriers in the path

of any state prisoner seeking review of his federal constitu-tional claims" and its transformation of "the duty to protect
federal rights into a self-fashioned abdication." Coleman v.
Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 759, 761 (1991) (dissenting opinion).This Term has witnessed the continued narrowing of the avenues of relief available to federal habeas petitioners seekingredress of their constitutional claims. See, e. g., Keeney v.
Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U. S. 1 (1992) (overruling in part Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293 (1963)). It has witnessed, as well,the execution of two victims of the "new habeas," Warren

McCleskey and Roger Keith Coleman.Warren McCleskey's case seemed the archetypal "fundamental miscarriage of justice" that the federal courts arecharged with remedying. As noted above, McCleskey dem505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT

359Cite as: 505 U. S. 333 (1992)
Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment
onstrated that state officials deliberately had elicited inculpa-tory admissions from him in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights and had withheld information he needed topresent his claim for relief. In addition, McCleskey argued
convincingly in his final hours that he could not even obtain
an impartial clemency hearing because of threats by stateofficials against the pardons and parole board. That the

Court permitted McCleskey to be executed without everhearing the merits of his claims starkly reveals the Court's
skewed value system, in which finality of judgments, conser-vation of state resources, and expediency of executions seem
to receive greater solicitude than justice and human life.
See McCleskey v. Bowers, 501 U. S. 1281 (1991) (Marshall, J.,
dissenting from denial of stay of execution).

The execution of Roger Keith Coleman is no less an affront
to principles of fundamental fairness. Last Term, the Court
refused to review the merits of Coleman's claims by effectively overruling, at Coleman's expense, precedents holding
that state-court decisions are presumed to be based on the
merits (and therefore, are subject to federal habeas review)
unless they explicitly reveal that they were based on state
procedural grounds. See Coleman, 501 U. S., at 762-764
(dissenting opinion). Moreover, the Court's refusal last
month to grant a temporary stay of execution so that the
lower courts could conduct a hearing into Coleman's wellsupported claim that he was innocent of the underlying offense demonstrates the resounding hollowness of the Court's
professed commitment to employ the "fundamental miscarriage of justice exception" as a "safeguard against compelling
an innocent man to suffer an unconstitutional loss of liberty." McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S., at 495 (internal quotation marks omitted). See Coleman v. Thompson, 504 U. S.
188, 189 (1992) (opinion dissenting from denial of stay of
execution).

As I review the state of this Court's capital jurisprudence,
I thus am left to wonder how the ever-shrinking authority of

505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT
360 SAWYER v. WHITLEY

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
the federal courts to reach and redress constitutional errorsaffects the legitimacy of the death penalty itself. Since

Gregg v. Georgia, the Court has upheld the constitutionalityof the death penalty where sufficient procedural safeguards
exist to ensure that the State's administration of the penalty
is neither arbitrary nor capricious. See 428 U. S. 153, 189,195 (1976) ( joint opinion);

Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 601
(1978). At the time those decisions issued, federal courtspossessed much broader authority than they do today to address claims of constitutional error on habeas review and,therefore, to examine the adequacy of a State's capital
scheme and the fairness and reliability of its decision toimpose the death penalty in a particular case. The more
the Court constrains the federal courts' power to reach the
constitutional claims of those sentenced to death, the morethe Court undermines the very legitimacy of capital punishment itself.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Blackmun and
Justice O'Connor join, concurring in the judgment.

Only 10 years ago, the Court reemphasized that "[t]he writof habeas corpus indisputably holds an honored position in

our jurisprudence. Tracing its roots deep into English com-mon law, it claims a place in Art. I of our Constitution.
Today, as in prior centuries, the writ is a bulwark against
convictions that violate `fundamental fairness.' Wainwrightv.

Sykes, 433 U. S. [72,] 97 [(1977)] (Stevens, J., concurring)."
Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 126 (1982). It is this centrality
of "fundamental fairness" that has led the Court to hold that
habeas review of a defaulted, successive, or abusive claim is
available, even absent a showing of cause, if failure to consider the claim would result in a fundamental miscarriage of
justice. See Sanders v. United States, 373 U. S. 1, 17-18
(1963); Engle, 456 U. S., at 135.

In Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 495, 496 (1986), the
Court ruled that the concept of "fundamental miscarriage of
justice" applies to those cases in which the defendant was

505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT

361Cite as: 505 U. S. 333 (1992)
Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
"probably . . . actually innocent." The Court held that "in
an extraordinary case, where a constitutional violation has
probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually
innocent, a federal habeas court may grant the writ even in
the absence of a showing of cause for the procedural default."
Id., at 496. Having equated the "ends of justice" with "actual innocence," the Court is now confronted with the task
of giving meaning to "actual innocence" in the context of a
capital sentencing proceeding--hence the phrase "innocence
of death."

While the conviction of an innocent person may be the archetypal case of a manifest miscarriage of justice, it is not
the only case. There is no reason why "actual innocence"
must be both an animating and the limiting principle of the
work of federal courts in furthering the "ends of justice."
As Judge Friendly emphasized, there are contexts in which,
irrespective of guilt or innocence, constitutional errors violate fundamental fairness. Friendly, Is Innocence Irrelevant? Collateral Attack on Criminal Judgments, 38 U. Chi.
L. Rev. 142, 151-154 (1970). Fundamental fairness is more
than accuracy at trial; justice is more than guilt or innocence.

Nowhere is this more true than in capital sentencing proceedings. Because the death penalty is qualitatively and
morally different from any other penalty, "[i]t is of vital importance to the defendant and to the community that any
decision to impose the death sentence be, and appear to be,
the consequence of scrupulously fair procedures." Smith v.
Murray, 477 U. S. 527, 545-546 (1986) (Stevens, J., dissenting). Accordingly, the ends of justice dictate that "[w]hen
a condemned prisoner raises a substantial, colorable Eighth
Amendment violation, there is a special obligation . . . to
consider whether the prisoner's claim would render his sentencing proceeding fundamentally unfair." Id., at 546.

Thus the Court's first and most basic error today is that it
asks the wrong question. Charged with averting manifest
miscarriages of justice, the Court instead narrowly recasts

505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT
362 SAWYER v. WHITLEY

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
its duty as redressing cases of "actual innocence." Thiserror aside, under a proper interpretation of the Carrier

analysis, the Court's definition of "innocence of death" isplainly wrong because it disregards well-settled law--both
the law of habeas corpus and the law of capital punishment.

I
The Court today holds that, absent a showing of cause, afederal court may not review a capital defendant's defaulted,

successive, or abusive claims unless the defendant

"show[s] by clear and convincing evidence that, butfor a constitutional error, no reasonable juror would

have found [him] eligible for the death penalty." Ante,at 336.

This definition of "innocence of the death sentence" deviatesfrom our established jurisprudence in two ways. First, the
"clear and convincing evidence" standard departs from a lineof decisions defining the "actual innocence" exception to the
cause-and-prejudice requirement. Second, and more funda-mentally, the Court's focus on

eligibility for the death pen-alty conflicts with the very structure of the constitutional

law of capital punishment.As noted above, in Murray v. Carrier, the Court held that
in those cases in which "a constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually inno-cent, a federal habeas court may grant the writ even in the

absence of a showing of cause for the procedural default."477 U. S., at 496 (emphasis added). The Court has since
frequently confirmed this standard. See, e. g., Coleman v.Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 748 (1991); Dugger v. Adams, 489
U. S. 401, 412, n. 6 (1989); Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 313(1989). In subsequent decisions, both those involving "innocence of the offense" and those involving "innocence of thedeath sentence," the Court has employed the same standard
of proof. For example, in Smith v. Murray, 477 U. S. 527

505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT

363Cite as: 505 U. S. 333 (1992)
Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
(1986), the Court repeated the Carrier standard and appliedit in a capital sentencing proceeding. The Court ruled that

Smith's claim did not present "the risk of a manifest miscar-riage of justice" as it was "devoid of any substantial claim
that the alleged error undermined the accuracy of the guilt
or sentencing determination." 477 U. S., at 538-539. Simi-larly, in

Dugger v. Adams, a case involving "innocence of the
death sentence," the Court stated the controlling standardas whether an "individual defendant

probably is `actually
innocent' of the sentence he or she received." 489 U. S., at412, n. 6 (emphasis added). In sum, in construing both "innocence of the offense" and "innocence of the death sentence," we have consistently required a defendant to show
that the alleged constitutional error has more likely than not
created a fundamental miscarriage of justice.

As we noted in another context, " [t]his outcomedeterminative standard has several strengths. It defines
the relevant inquiry in a way familiar to courts, though the
inquiry, as is inevitable, is anything but precise. The standard also reflects the profound importance of finality in criminal proceedings. Moreover, it comports with the widely
used standard for assessing motions for new trial based on
newly discovered evidence." Strickland v. Washington, 466
U. S. 668, 693-694 (1984).

Equally significant, this "probably resulted" standard is
well calibrated to the manifest miscarriage of justice exception. Not only does the standard respect the competing
demands of finality and fundamental fairness, it also fits
squarely within our habeas jurisprudence. In general, a
federal court may entertain a defaulted, successive, or abusive claim if a prisoner demonstrates cause and prejudice.
See generally McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 493-495
(1991). To show "prejudice," a defendant must demonstrate
"a reasonable probability that, but for [the alleged] erro[r],
the result of the proceeding would have been different."
Strickland, 466 U. S., at 694; see also United States v. Bag505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT
364 SAWYER v. WHITLEY

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
ley, 473 U. S. 667, 682, 685 (1985). The "miscarriage of jus-tice" exception to this general rule requires a more substantial showing: The defendant must not simply demonstrate a
reasonable probability of a different result, he must show
that the alleged error more likely than not created a manifest miscarriage of justice. This regime makes logical sense.If a defendant cannot show cause and can only show a "reasonable probability" of a different outcome, a federal courtshould not hear his defaulted, successive, or abusive claim.
Only in the "exceptional case" in which a defendant can showthat the alleged constitutional error "probably resulted" in
the conviction (or sentencing) of one innocent of the offense
(or the death sentence) should the court hear the defendant's claim.

The Court today repudiates this established standard of
proof and replaces it with a requirement that a defendant
"show by clear and convincing evidence that . . . no reasonable juror would have found [him] eligible for the death penalty." Ante, at 336 (emphasis supplied). I see no reason
to reject the established and well-functioning "probably resulted" standard and impose such a severe burden on the
capital defendant. Although we have frequently recognized
the State's strong interest in finality, we have never suggested that that interest is sufficient to outweigh the individual's claim to innocence. To the contrary, the "actual innocence" exception itself manifests our recognition that the
criminal justice system occasionally errs and that, when it
does, finality must yield to justice.

"The function of a standard of proof . . . is to `instruct
the factfinder concerning the degree of confidence our society
thinks he should have in the correctness of factual conclusions for a particular type of adjudication.'. . . The standard serves to allocate the risk of error between the litigants
and to indicate the relative importance attached to the ultimate decision." Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418, 423
(1979) (citation omitted). Neither of these considerations

505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT

365Cite as: 505 U. S. 333 (1992)
Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
supports the heightened standard of proof the Court im-poses today.

First, there is no basis for requiring a federal court to bevirtually certain that the defendant is actually ineligible for
the death penalty before merely entertaining his claim. We
have required a showing by clear and convincing evidence inseveral contexts: For example, the medical facts underlying

a civil commitment must be established by this standard,
Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418 (1979), as must "actual
malice" in a libel suit brought by a public official. New York
Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 279-280 (1964); see also
Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U. S. 242 (1986). And
we have required a related showing in cases involving deportation, Woodby v. INS, 385 U. S. 276, 285-286 (1966), and denaturalization, Schneiderman v. United States, 320 U. S. 118,
125 (1943). In each of these contexts, the interests of the
nonmoving party were truly substantial: personal liberty
in Addington, freedom of expression in New York Times,
residence in Woodby, and citizenship in Schneiderman. In
my opinion, the State's interest in finality in a capital prosecution is not nearly as great as any of these interests. Indeed, it is important to remember that "innocence of the
death sentence" is not a standard for staying or vacating
a death sentence, but merely a standard for determining
whether or not a court should reach the merits of a defaulted
claim. The State's interest in "finality" in this context
certainly does not warrant a "clear and convincing" evidentiary standard.

Nor is there any justification for allocating the risk of error
to fall so severely upon the capital defendant or attaching
greater importance to the initial sentence than to the issue
of whether that sentence is appropriate. The States themselves have declined to attach such weight to capital sentences: Most States provide plain-error review for defaulted
claims in capital cases. See Smith v. Murray, 477 U. S., at
548-550, n. 20 (collecting authorities). In this regard, the

505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT
366 SAWYER v. WHITLEY

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
Court's requirement that "innocence of death" must be dem-onstrated by "clear and convincing evidence" fails to respect

the uniqueness of death penalty decisions: Nowhere is theneed for accuracy greater than when the State exercises its
ultimate authority and takes the life of one of its citizens.Indeed, the Court's ruling creates a perverse double standard. While a defendant raising defaulted claims in a non-capital case must show that constitutional error "probably
resulted" in a miscarriage of justice, a capital defendant mustpresent "clear and convincing evidence" that no reasonable
juror would find him eligible for the death penalty. It isheartlessly perverse to impose a more stringent standard of
proof to avoid a miscarriage of justice in a capital case thanin a noncapital case.

In sum, I see no reason to depart from settled law, whichclearly requires a defendant pressing a defaulted, successive,
or abusive claim to show that a failure to hear his claim will"probably result" in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.
In my opinion, a corresponding standard governs a de-faulted, successive, or abusive challenge to a capital sentence: The defendant must show that he is probably--thatis, more likely than not--"innocent of the death sentence."

II
The Court recognizes that the proper definition of "inno-cence of the death sentence" must involve a reweighing of

the evidence and must focus on the sentencer's likely evalua-tion of that evidence. Thus, the Court directs federal courts
to look to whether a "reasonable juror would have found thepetitioner eligible for the death penalty."

Ante, at 336 (em-phasis added). Nevertheless, the Court inexplicably limits

this inquiry in two ways. First, the Court holds that courtsshould consider

only evidence concerning aggravating fac-tors. As demonstrated below, this limitation is wholly without foundation and neglects the central role of mitigat-ing evidence in capital sentencing proceedings. Second, the

505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT

367Cite as: 505 U. S. 333 (1992)
Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
Court requires a petitioner to refute his eligibility for the
death penalty. This narrow definition of "innocence of the
death sentence" fails to recognize that, in rare cases, even
though a defendant is eligible for the death penalty, such a
sentence may nonetheless constitute a fundamental miscarriage of justice.

It is well established that, "in capital cases, the sentencer
may not refuse to consider or be precluded from considering
any relevant mitigating evidence." Hitchcock v. Dugger,
481 U. S. 393, 394 (1987) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Yet in ascribing a narrow, eligibility-based
meaning to "innocence of the death sentence" the Court neglects this rudimentary principle.

As the Court recognizes, a single general directive animates and informs our capital-punishment jurisprudence:
"[T]he death penalty [may not] be imposed under sentencing
procedures that creat[e] a substantial risk that [the death
penalty] would be inflicted in an arbitrary and capricious
manner." Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 188 (1976) (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). As applied and
developed over the years, this constitutional requirement has
yielded two central principles. First, a sentencing scheme
must "genuinely narrow the class of persons eligible for the
death penalty." Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 877 (1983).
Second, the sentencer must "not be precluded from considering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant's character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense
that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than
death." Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 604 (1978) (opinion of
Burger, C. J.) (emphasis in original). Although these principles--one narrowing the relevant class, the other broadening
the scope of considered evidence--seemingly point in opposite directions, in fact both serve the same end: ensuring
that a capital sentence is the product of individualized and
reasoned moral decisionmaking.

of the death sentence" concerns only "those elements thatrender a defendant eligible for the death penalty, and not
. . . additional mitigating evidence that [constitutional errorprecluded] from being introduced."

Ante, at 347 (emphasisadded). Stated bluntly, the Court today respects only one

of the two bedrock principles of capital-punishment juris-prudence. As such, the Court's impoverished vision of capital sentencing is at odds with both the doctrine and thetheory developed in our many decisions concerning capital
punishment.First, the Court implicitly repudiates the requirement that
the sentencer be allowed to consider all relevant mitigatingevidence, a constitutive element of our Eighth Amendment
jurisprudence. We have reiterated and applied this princi-ple in more than a dozen cases over the last 14 years. For
example, in Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982), weoverturned a capital sentence because the sentencer refused
to consider certain mitigating evidence. Similarly, in Skip-per v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1 (1986), we ruled that a
State cannot preclude consideration of evidence of postincar-ceration, pretrial good behavior. And in Penry v. Lynaugh,
492 U. S. 302 (1989), we held that Texas' death penaltyscheme impermissibly restricted the jury's consideration of
the defendant's mental retardation as mitigating evidence.1Moreover, the Court's holding also clashes with the theory
underlying our capital-punishment jurisprudence. The non-arbitrariness--and therefore the constitutionality--of the
death penalty rests on individualized sentencing determi-nations. See generally California v. Brown, 479 U. S. 538,
544-546 (1987) (O'Connor, J., concurring). This is the dif1 See also Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370 (1990); McKoy v. North
Carolina, 494 U. S. 433 (1990); Franklin v. Lynaugh, 487 U. S. 164 (1988);
Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367 (1988); Hitchcock v. Dugger, 481 U. S.

ference between the guided-discretion regime upheld in
Gregg v. Georgia and the mandatory death-sentence regime
invalidated in Roberts v. Louisiana, 428 U. S. 325 (1976).
The Roberts scheme was constitutionally infirm because it
left no room for individualized moral judgments, because it
failed to provide the sentencer with a "meaningful opportunity [to] conside[r the] mitigating factors presented by the
circumstances of the particular crime or by the attributes
of the individual offender." Id., at 333-334 (opinion of
Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). The Court's definition
of "innocence of the death sentence" is like the statutory
scheme in Roberts: It focuses solely on whether the defendant is in a class eligible for the death penalty and disregards
the equally important question whether " `death is the appropriate punishment in [the defendant's] specific case.' " Zant
v. Stephens, 462 U. S., at 885 (quoting Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, 305 (1976)).2

The Court's definition of "innocent of the death sentence"
is flawed in a second, related way. The Court's analysis not
only neglects errors that preclude a sentencer's consideration of mitigating factors; it also focuses too narrowly on
eligibility. The Court requires a defendant to call into
question all of the aggravating factors found by the sentencer and thereby show himself ineligible for the death
penalty.

2 The Court rejects the argument that federal courts should also consider mitigating evidence because consideration of such evidence involves
the "far more difficult task [of] assess[ing] how jurors would have reacted
to additional showings." Ante, at 346. I see no such difference between
consideration of aggravating and mitigating circumstances; both require
the federal courts to reconsider and anticipate a sentencer's decision: By
the Court's own standard federal courts must determine whether a "reasonable juror would have found" certain facts. Thus, the Court's reason
for barring federal courts from considering mitigating circumstances applies equally to the standard that it endorses. Its exclusion of mitigating
evidence from consideration is therefore wholly arbitrary.

370 SAWYER v. WHITLEY

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
Contrary to the Court's suggestion, however, there maybe cases in which, although the defendant remains eligible

for the death penalty, imposition of a death sentence wouldconstitute a manifest miscarriage of justice. If, for example,
the sentencer, in assigning a sentence of death, relied heavilyon a finding that the defendant severely tortured the victim,
but later it is discovered that another person was responsiblefor the torture, the elimination of the aggravating circumstance will, in some cases, indicate that the death sen-tence was a miscarriage of justice. By imposing an "all-ornothing" eligibility test, the Court's definition of "innocentof the death sentence" fails to acknowledge this important
possibility.In sum, the Court's "innocent of the death sentence" standard is flawed both in its failure to consider constitutional er-rors implicating mitigating factors and in its unduly harsh
requirement that a defendant's eligibility for the death pen-alty be disproved.

III
In my opinion, the "innocence of the death sentence"standard must take into account several factors. First, such

a standard must reflect both of the basic principles of ourcapital-punishment jurisprudence. The standard must recognize both the need to define narrowly the class of "death-eligible" defendants and the need to define broadly the scope
of mitigating evidence permitted the capital sentencer. Sec-ond, the "innocence of the death sentence" standard should
also recognize the distinctive character of the capital sen-tencing decision. While the question of innocence or guilt
of the offense is essentially a question of fact, the choice between life imprisonment and capital punishment is both aquestion of underlying fact and a matter of reasoned moral

judgment. Thus, there may be some situations in which, al-though the defendant remains technically "eligible" for the
death sentence, nonetheless, in light of all of the evidence,

371Cite as: 505 U. S. 333 (1992)
Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
that sentence constitutes a manifest miscarriage of justice.
Finally, the "innocence of the death sentence" standard must
also respect the "profound importance of finality in criminal
proceedings," Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S., at 693-
694, and the "heavy burden" that successive habeas petitions
place "on scarce federal judicial resources." McCleskey v.
Zant, 499 U. S., at 491.

These requirements are best met by a standard that provides that a defendant is "innocent of the death sentence"
only if his capital sentence is clearly erroneous. This standard encompasses several types of error. A death sentence
is clearly erroneous if, taking into account all of the available
evidence, the sentencer lacked the legal authority to impose
such a sentence because, under state law, the defendant was
not eligible for the death penalty. Similarly, in the case of
a "jury override," a death sentence is clearly erroneous if,
taking into account all of the evidence, the evidentiary prerequisites for that override (as established by state law)
were not met. See, e. g., Johnson v. Singletary, 938 F. 2d
1166, 1194-1195 (CA11 1991) (Tjoflat, C. J., concurring in part
and dissenting in part) (concluding that the sentencing
"judge, as a matter of law, could not have sentenced the petitioner to death" because there was insufficient evidence to
meet the jury-override standard established in Tedder v.
State, 322 So. 2d 908, 910 (Fla. 1975)). A death sentence is
also clearly erroneous under a "balancing" regime if, in view
of all of the evidence, mitigating circumstances so far outweighed aggravating circumstances that no reasonable sentencer would have imposed the death penalty. Cf. Jackson
v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 316-318 (1979). Such a case might
arise if constitutional error either precluded the defendant
from demonstrating that aggravating circumstances did not
obtain or precluded the sentencer's consideration of important mitigating evidence.

372 SAWYER v. WHITLEY

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
Unlike the standard suggested by the Court, this standardacknowledges both the "aggravation" and "mitigation" aspects of capital-punishment law. It recognizes that, in theextraordinary case, constitutional error may have precluded
consideration of mitigating circumstances so substantial as
to warrant a court's review of a defaulted, successive, or abu-sive claim. It also recognizes that, again in the extraordinary case, constitutional error may have inaccurately dem-onstrated aggravating circumstances so substantial as to
warrant review of a defendant's claims.Moreover, the "clearly-erroneous" standard is duly protective of the State's legitimate interests in finality and respectful of the systemic and institutional costs of successive habeas litigation. The standard is stringent: If the sentence
"is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety" it
is not clearly erroneous "even though [the court is] convinced
that had it been sitting as the [sentencer], it would have
weighed the evidence differently." Anderson v. Bessemer
City, 470 U. S. 564, 574 (1985). At the same time, "clearlyerroneous" review allows a federal court to entertain a defaulted claim in the rare case in which the "court on the
entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction
that a mistake has been committed." United States v.
United States Gypsum Co., 333 U. S. 364, 395 (1948).

Finally, the "clearly-erroneous" standard is workable. As
was true of the cause-and-prejudice standard adopted in McCleskey v. Zant, the clear-error standard is "[w]ell-defined in
the case law [and] familiar to federal courts. . . . The standard
is an objective one, and can be applied in a manner that comports with the threshold nature of the abuse of the writ inquiry." 499 U. S., at 496. Federal courts have long applied
the "clearly-erroneous" standard pursuant to Rule 52 of
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and have done so "in
civil contempt actions, condemnation proceedings, copyright
appeals, [and] forfeiture actions for illegal activity." 1

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
(1986) (citing cases).3 This workability supports the applica-tion of the "clearly-erroneous" standard to the "innocence of

the death sentence" inquiry.In my opinion, then, the "clearly-erroneous" standard is
the core of the "innocence of the death sentence" exception.Just as a defendant who presses a defaulted, successive, or
abusive claim and who cannot show cause must demonstratethat it is more likely than not that he is actually innocent of
the offense, so a capital defendant who presses such a claimand cannot show cause must demonstrate that it is more
likely than not that his death sentence was clearly erroneous.Absent such a showing, a federal court may not reach the
merits of the defendant's defaulted, successive, or abusiveclaim.

IV
It remains to apply this standard to the case at hand. Asthe majority indicates, Sawyer alleges two constitutional

errors. First, he contends that the State withheld certainexculpatory evidence, in violation of Sawyer's due process
rights as recognized in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83(1963). Second, Sawyer argues that his trial counsel's failure to uncover and present records from Sawyer's earliertreatments in psychiatric institutions deprived him of effective assistance of counsel as guaranteed by the SixthAmendment.

As Sawyer failed to assert his Brady claim in an earlierhabeas petition and as he cannot show cause for that failure,
the court may only reach the merits of that "abusive" claimif Sawyer demonstrates that he is probably actually innocent
of the offense or that it is more likely than not that his deathsentence was clearly erroneous. As Sawyer's ineffectiveassistance claim was considered and rejected in an earlier

3 Courts have also reviewed nonguilt findings of fact made in criminal
cases pursuant to Rule 23(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure
under this standard. See 2 S. Childress & M. Davis, Standards of Review

505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT
374 SAWYER v. WHITLEY

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
habeas proceeding, the court may only review that "succes-sive" claim upon a similar showing. Upon a review of the

record in its entirety, I conclude that Sawyer has failed tomake such a showing.

Sawyer points to two pieces of exculpatory evidence allegedly withheld by the State. First, he offers the affidavitof a woman (Diane Thibodeaux) who, on occasion, took care

of the small child who witnessed the crime. That accountappears to conflict with contemporaneous police reports.
While police records indicate that the child implicated Saw-yer in the cruel burning of the victim, Thibodeaux avers that
the child stated to her that Sawyer's codefendant, Charles
Lane, set the victim afire. Second, he offers other affidavits
casting doubt on the credibility of Cindy Shano, the State's
principal witness. Sawyer emphasizes that Shano testified
under a grant of immunity and highlights inaccuracies in her
trial testimony. Finally, as part of his Sixth Amendment
claim, Sawyer also offers medical records documenting brain
damage and retarded mental development.

Viewed as a whole, the record does not demonstrate that
failure to reach the merits of Sawyer's claims would constitute a fundamental miscarriage of justice. First, in view of
the other evidence in the record, the Thibodeaux affidavit
and questions concerning Shano's testimony do not establish
that Sawyer is "probably . . . actually innocent" of the crime
of first-degree murder. At most, Thibodeaux's hearsay
statements cast slight doubt on the facts underlying the
burning of the victim. Similarly, although the challenges to
Shano's testimony raise questions, these affidavits do not
demonstrate that Sawyer probably did not commit firstdegree murder. Thus, Sawyer has not met the standard
"actual innocence" exception.

Second, the affidavits and the new medical records do not
convince me that Sawyer's death sentence is clearly erroneous. The jury found two statutory aggravating factors--
that the murder was committed in the course of an aggra505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT

375Cite as: 505 U. S. 333 (1992)
Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
vated arson, and that the murder was especially heinous,atrocious, and cruel. State v. Sawyer, 422 So. 2d 95, 100 (La.

1982). As suggested above, the Thibodeaux affidavit doesnot show that it is "more likely than not" that Sawyer did
not commit aggravated arson. Moreover, Sawyer offers noevidence to undermine the jury's finding that the murder was
especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel. In addition, assum-ing that the new medical evidence would support a finding
of a statutory mitigating factor (diminished capacity due tomental disease or defect),

4 I cannot say that it would be clear

error for a sentencer faced with the two unrefuted aggravat-ing circumstances and that single mitigating circumstance to

sentence Sawyer to death.In sum, in my opinion Sawyer has failed to demonstrate
that it is more likely than not that his death sentence wasclearly erroneous. Accordingly, I conclude that the court
below was correct in declining to reach the merits of Saw-yer's successive and abusive claims.

V
The Court rejects an "innocence of death" standard thatrecognizes constitutional errors affecting mitigating evidence because such a standard "would so broaden the inquiryas to make it anything but a `narrow' exception to the principle of finality." Ante, at 345. As the foregoing analysisindicates, however, the Court's concerns are unfounded.
Indeed, even when federal courts have applied a lessrestrictive standard than the standard I propose, those
courts have rarely found "innocence of death" and reachedthe merits of a defaulted, successive, or abusive claim. See
Deutscher v. Whitley, 946 F. 2d 1443 (CA9 1991); Stokes v.

4 See La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 905.5(e) (West 1984) (defining "mitigating circumstances" to include the fact that "the capacity of the offender to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was impaired as a result of mental disease
or defect" at the time of the offense).

Similarly, I do not share the Court's concern that a stand-ard broader than the eligibility standard creates "a far more
difficult task" for federal courts. Ante, at 346. As notedabove, both the "probably resulted" standard and the
"clearly-erroneous" standard have long been applied by fed-eral courts in a variety of contexts. Moreover, to the extent
that the "clearly-erroneous" standard is more difficult toapply than the Court's "eligibility" test, I believe that that
cost is far outweighed by the importance of making just deci-sions in the few cases that fit within this narrow exception.
To my mind, any added administrative burden is surely justi-fied by the overriding interest in minimizing the risk of error
in implementing the sovereign's decision to take the life ofone of its citizens. As we observed in Gardner v. Florida,
430 U. S. 349, 360 (1977), "if the disputed matter is of criticalimportance, the time invested in ascertaining the truth
would surely be well spent if it makes the difference betweenlife and death."

R. A. V. v. CITY OF ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA
certiorari to the supreme court of minnesota
No. 90-7675. Argued December 4, 1991--Decided June 22, 1992
After allegedly burning a cross on a black family's lawn, petitioner R. A. V.

was charged under, inter alia, the St. Paul, Minnesota, Bias-Motivated
Crime Ordinance, which prohibits the display of a symbol which one
knows or has reason to know "arouses anger, alarm or resentment in
others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender." The trial
court dismissed this charge on the ground that the ordinance was substantially overbroad and impermissibly content based, but the State Supreme Court reversed. It rejected the overbreadth claim because the
phrase "arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others" had been construed in earlier state cases to limit the ordinance's reach to "fighting
words" within the meaning of this Court's decision in Chaplinsky v. New
Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568, 572, a category of expression unprotected by
the First Amendment. The court also concluded that the ordinance
was not impermissibly content based because it was narrowly tailored to
serve a compelling governmental interest in protecting the community
against bias-motivated threats to public safety and order.

Held: The ordinance is facially invalid under the First Amendment.

Pp. 381-396.

(a) This Court is bound by the state court's construction of the
ordinance as reaching only expressions constituting "fighting words."
However, R. A. V.'s request that the scope of the Chaplinsky formulation be modified, thereby invalidating the ordinance as substantially
overbroad, need not be reached, since the ordinance unconstitutionally
prohibits speech on the basis of the subjects the speech addresses.
P. 381.

(b) A few limited categories of speech, such as obscenity, defamation,
and fighting words, may be regulated because of their constitutionally
proscribable content. However, these categories are not entirely invisible to the Constitution, and government may not regulate them based
on hostility, or favoritism, towards a nonproscribable message they contain. Thus the regulation of "fighting words" may not be based on nonproscribable content. It may, however, be underinclusive, addressing
some offensive instances and leaving other, equally offensive, ones alone,
so long as the selective proscription is not based on content, or there is
no realistic possibility that regulation of ideas is afoot. Pp. 382-390.

378 R. A. V. v. ST. PAUL

Syllabus
(c) The ordinance, even as narrowly construed by the State Supreme
Court, is facially unconstitutional because it imposes special prohibitions
on those speakers who express views on the disfavored subjects of "race,
color, creed, religion or gender." At the same time, it permits displays
containing abusive invective if they are not addressed to those topics.
Moreover, in its practical operation the ordinance goes beyond mere
content, to actual viewpoint, discrimination. Displays containing
"fighting words" that do not invoke the disfavored subjects would seemingly be useable ad libitum by those arguing in favor of racial, color,
etc., tolerance and equality, but not by their opponents. St. Paul's desire to communicate to minority groups that it does not condone the
"group hatred" of bias-motivated speech does not justify selectively silencing speech on the basis of its content. Pp. 391-393.

(d) The content-based discrimination reflected in the ordinance does
not rest upon the very reasons why the particular class of speech at
issue is proscribable, it is not aimed only at the "secondary effects" of
speech within the meaning of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475
U. S. 41, and it is not for any other reason the sort that does not threaten
censorship of ideas. In addition, the ordinance's content discrimination
is not justified on the ground that the ordinance is narrowly tailored to
serve a compelling state interest in ensuring the basic human rights of
groups historically discriminated against, since an ordinance not limited
to the favored topics would have precisely the same beneficial effect.
Pp. 393-396.

ished under any of a number of laws,1 one of the two provi-sions under which respondent city of St. Paul chose to charge

petitioner (then a juvenile) was the St. Paul Bias-MotivatedCrime Ordinance, St. Paul, Minn., Legis. Code $ 292.02
(1990), which provides:

"Whoever places on public or private property asymbol, object, appellation, characterization or graffiti,

including, but not limited to, a burning cross or Naziswastika, which one knows or has reasonable grounds to
know arouses anger, alarm or resentment in otherson the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender
commits disorderly conduct and shall be guilty of amisdemeanor."

Petitioner moved to dismiss this count on the ground thatthe St. Paul ordinance was substantially overbroad and
impermissibly content based and therefore facially invalidunder the First Amendment.

2 The trial court granted this

motion, but the Minnesota Supreme Court reversed. Thatcourt rejected petitioner's overbreadth claim because, as

construed in prior Minnesota cases, see, e. g., In re Welfareof S. L. J., 263 N. W. 2d 412 (Minn. 1978), the modifying
phrase "arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others" lim-ited the reach of the ordinance to conduct that amounts to
"fighting words," i. e., "conduct that itself inflicts injury ortends to incite immediate violence . . . ,"

In re Welfare ofR. A. V., 464 N. W. 2d 507, 510 (Minn. 1991) (citing Chaplin1 The conduct might have violated Minnesota statutes carrying significant penalties. See, e. g., Minn. Stat. $ 609.713(1) (1987) (providing for up

property intended to be damaged); $ 609.595 (Supp. 1992) (criminal damage

upon the extent of the damage to the property).

In construing the St. Paul ordinance, we are bound by theconstruction given to it by the Minnesota court. Posadas

de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico,478 U. S. 328, 339 (1986); New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747,
769, n. 24 (1982); Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U. S. 1, 4 (1949).Accordingly, we accept the Minnesota Supreme Court's authoritative statement that the ordinance reaches only thoseexpressions that constitute "fighting words" within the
meaning of Chaplinsky. 464 N. W. 2d, at 510-511. Peti-tioner and his

amici urge us to modify the scope of theChaplinsky formulation, thereby invalidating the ordinance

as "substantially overbroad," Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413U. S. 601, 610 (1973). We find it unnecessary to consider
this issue. Assuming, arguendo, that all of the expressionreached by the ordinance is proscribable under the "fighting
words" doctrine, we nonetheless conclude that the ordinanceis facially unconstitutional in that it prohibits otherwise permitted speech solely on the basis of the subjects the speechaddresses.

3 Contrary to Justice White's suggestion, post, at 397-398, n. 1, petitioner's claim is "fairly included" within the questions presented in the
petition for certiorari, see this Court's Rule 14.1(a). It was clear from the
petition and from petitioner's other filings in this Court (and in the courts
below) that his assertion that the St. Paul ordinance "violat[es] overbreadth . . . principles of the First Amendment," Pet. for Cert. i, was not

382 R. A. V. v. ST. PAUL

Opinion of the Court
The First Amendment generally prevents government
from proscribing speech, see, e. g., Cantwell v. Connecticut,
310 U. S. 296, 309-311 (1940), or even expressive conduct,
see, e. g., Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 406 (1989), because
of disapproval of the ideas expressed. Content-based regulations are presumptively invalid. Simon & Schuster, Inc.
v. Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105,
115 (1991); id., at 124 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment);
Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of
N. Y., 447 U. S. 530, 536 (1980); Police Dept. of Chicago v.
Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 95 (1972). From 1791 to the present,
however, our society, like other free but civilized societies,
has permitted restrictions upon the content of speech in a

just a technical "overbreadth" claim--i. e., a claim that the ordinance violated the rights of too many third parties--but included the contention
that the ordinance was "overbroad" in the sense of restricting more speech
than the Constitution permits, even in its application to him, because it is
content based. An important component of petitioner's argument is, and
has been all along, that narrowly construing the ordinance to cover only
"fighting words" cannot cure this fundamental defect. Id., at 12, 14, 15-
16. In his briefs in this Court, petitioner argued that a narrowing construction was ineffective because (1) its boundaries were vague, Brief for
Petitioner 26, and because (2) denominating particular expression a "fighting word" because of the impact of its ideological content upon the audience is inconsistent with the First Amendment, Reply Brief for Petitioner
5; id., at 13 ("[The ordinance] is overbroad, viewpoint discriminatory and
vague as `narrowly construed' ") (emphasis added). At oral argument,
counsel for petitioner reiterated this second point: "It is . . . one of my
positions, that in [punishing only some fighting words and not others],
even though it is a subcategory, technically, of unprotected conduct, [the
ordinance] still is picking out an opinion, a disfavored message, and making
that clear through the State." Tr. of Oral Arg. 8. In resting our judgment upon this contention, we have not departed from our criteria of what
is "fairly included" within the petition. See Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corp. v. Arkansas Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 461 U. S. 375, 382, n. 6 (1983);
Brown v. Socialist Workers '74 Campaign Comm., 459 U. S. 87, 94, n. 9

few limited areas, which are "of such slight social value as astep to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them

is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and mo-rality."

Chaplinsky, supra, at 572. We have recognized
that "the freedom of speech" referred to by the First
Amendment does not include a freedom to disregard thesetraditional limitations. See,

e. g., Roth v. United States, 354
U. S. 476 (1957) (obscenity); Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343 U. S.250 (1952) (defamation);

Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,
supra (" `fighting' words"); see generally Simon & Schuster,
supra, at 124 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment). Our
decisions since the 1960's have narrowed the scope of the
traditional categorical exceptions for defamation, see New
York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964); Gertz v.
Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323 (1974); see generally Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., 497 U. S. 1, 13-17 (1990), and
for obscenity, see Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15 (1973),
but a limited categorical approach has remained an important part of our First Amendment jurisprudence.

We have sometimes said that these categories of expression are "not within the area of constitutionally protected
speech," Roth, supra, at 483; Beauharnais, supra, at 266;
Chaplinsky, supra, at 571-572, or that the "protection of
the First Amendment does not extend" to them, Bose Corp.
v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U. S. 485,
504 (1984); Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492
U. S. 115, 124 (1989). Such statements must be taken in context, however, and are no more literally true than is the occasionally repeated shorthand characterizing obscenity "as not
being speech at all," Sunstein, Pornography and the First
Amendment, 1986 Duke L. J. 589, 615, n. 46. What they
mean is that these areas of speech can, consistently with the
First Amendment, be regulated because of their constitutionally proscribable content (obscenity, defamation, etc.)--
not that they are categories of speech entirely invisible to
the Constitution, so that they may be made the vehicles for

Opinion of the Court
content discrimination unrelated to their distinctively pro-scribable content. Thus, the government may proscribe

libel; but it may not make the further content discriminationof proscribing only libel critical of the government. We recently acknowledged this distinction in Ferber, 458 U. S., at763, where, in upholding New York's child pornography law,
we expressly recognized that there was no "question here ofcensoring a particular literary theme . . . ." See also

id.,at 775 (
O'Connor, J., concurring) ("As drafted, New York'sstatute does not attempt to suppress the communication of

particular ideas").Our cases surely do not establish the proposition that the
First Amendment imposes no obstacle whatsoever to regula-tion of particular instances of such proscribable expression,
so that the government "may regulate [them] freely," post,at 400 (

White, J., concurring in judgment). That wouldmean that a city council could enact an ordinance prohibiting

only those legally obscene works that contain criticism of thecity government or, indeed, that do not include endorsement
of the city government. Such a simplistic, all-or-nothing-at-all approach to First Amendment protection is at odds with
common sense and with our jurisprudence as well.4 It is

4 Justice White concedes that a city council cannot prohibit only those
legally obscene works that contain criticism of the city government, post,
at 406, but asserts that to be the consequence, not of the First Amendment, but of the Equal Protection Clause. Such content-based discrimination would not, he asserts, "be rationally related to a legitimate government interest." Ibid. But of course the only reason that government
interest is not a "legitimate" one is that it violates the First Amendment.
This Court itself has occasionally fused the First Amendment into the
Equal Protection Clause in this fashion, but at least with the acknowledgment (which Justice White cannot afford to make) that the First Amendment underlies its analysis. See Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408
U. S. 92, 95 (1972) (ordinance prohibiting only nonlabor picketing violated
the Equal Protection Clause because there was no "appropriate governmental interest" supporting the distinction inasmuch as "the First Amendment means that government has no power to restrict expression because
of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content"); Carey v.

Opinion of the Court
not true that "fighting words" have at most a "de minimis"expressive content, ibid., or that their content is in all respects "worthless and undeserving of constitutional protec-tion," post, at 401; sometimes they are quite expressive indeed. We have not said that they constitute "no part of theexpression of ideas," but only that they constitute "no

essen-tial part of any exposition of ideas." Chaplinsky, supra, at

572 (emphasis added).The proposition that a particular instance of speech can be
proscribable on the basis of one feature (e. g., obscenity) butnot on the basis of another (e. g., opposition to the city government) is commonplace and has found application in manycontexts. We have long held, for example, that nonverbal
expressive activity can be banned because of the action itentails, but not because of the ideas it expresses--so that
burning a flag in violation of an ordinance against outdoorfires could be punishable, whereas burning a flag in violation
of an ordinance against dishonoring the flag is not. See
Johnson, 491 U. S., at 406-407. See also Barnes v. Glen
Theatre, Inc., 501 U. S. 560, 569-570 (1991) (plurality opin-ion); id., at 573-574 (

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment);
id., at 581-582 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment); United

Brown, 447 U. S. 455 (1980). See generally Simon & Schuster, Inc. v.
Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 124 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).

Justice Stevens seeks to avoid the point by dismissing the notion of
obscene antigovernment speech as "fantastical," post, at 418, apparently
believing that any reference to politics prevents a finding of obscenity.
Unfortunately for the purveyors of obscenity, that is obviously false. A
shockingly hardcore pornographic movie that contains a model sporting a
political tattoo can be found, "taken as a whole, [to] lac[k] serious literary,
artistic, political, or scientific value," Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, 24
(1973) (emphasis added). Anyway, it is easy enough to come up with other
illustrations of a content-based restriction upon "unprotected speech"
that is obviously invalid: the antigovernment libel illustration mentioned
earlier, for one. See supra, at 384. And of course the concept of racist
fighting words is, unfortunately, anything but a "highly speculative hypothetica[l]," post, at 419.

386 R. A. V. v. ST. PAUL

Opinion of the Court
States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 376-377 (1968). Similarly,we have upheld reasonable "time, place, or manner" restrictions, but only if they are "justified without reference to thecontent of the regulated speech." Ward v. Rock Against
Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791 (1989) (internal quotation marksomitted); see also

Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288, 298 (1984) (noting that the O'Brien

test differs little from the standard applied to time, place, ormanner restrictions). And just as the power to proscribe
particular speech on the basis of a noncontent element (e. g.,noise) does not entail the power to proscribe the same speech
on the basis of a content element; so also, the power to pro-scribe it on the basis of

one content element (e. g., obscenity)does not entail the power to proscribe it on the basis of other

content elements.In other words, the exclusion of "fighting words" from the
scope of the First Amendment simply means that, for pur-poses of that Amendment, the unprotected features of the
words are, despite their verbal character, essentially a "non-speech" element of communication. Fighting words are
thus analogous to a noisy sound truck: Each is, as JusticeFrankfurter recognized, a "mode of speech,"

Niemotko v.Maryland, 340 U. S. 268, 282 (1951) (opinion concurring in

result); both can be used to convey an idea; but neither has,in and of itself, a claim upon the First Amendment. As with
the sound truck, however, so also with fighting words: Thegovernment may not regulate use based on hostility--or
favoritism--towards the underlying message expressed.Compare

Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474 (1988) (upholding,against facial challenge, a content-neutral ban on targeted

residential picketing), with Carey v. Brown, 447 U. S. 455(1980) (invalidating a ban on residential picketing that exempted labor picketing).5

5 Although Justice White asserts that our analysis disregards "established principles of First Amendment law," post, at 415, he cites not a
single case (and we are aware of none) that even involved, much less con505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:57 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
The concurrences describe us as setting forth a new FirstAmendment principle that prohibition of constitutionally

proscribable speech cannot be "underinclusiv[e]," post, at 402(

White, J., concurring in judgment)--a First Amendment"absolutism" whereby "[w]ithin a particular `proscribable'

category of expression, . . . a government must either pro-scribe all speech or no speech at all," post, at 419 (

Stevens,
J., concurring in judgment). That easy target is of the con-currences' own invention. In our view, the First Amendment imposes not an "underinclusiveness" limitation but a"content discrimination" limitation upon a State's prohibition
of proscribable speech. There is no problem whatever, for
example, with a State's prohibiting obscenity (and otherforms of proscribable expression) only in certain media or

markets, for although that prohibition would be "underinclu-sive," it would not discriminate on the basis of content. See,
e. g., Sable Communications, 492 U. S., at 124-126 (upholding47 U. S. C. $ 223(b)(1), which prohibits obscene

telephone
communications).Even the prohibition against content discrimination that

we assert the First Amendment requires is not absolute. It
applies differently in the context of proscribable speech thanin the area of fully protected speech. The rationale of the

general prohibition, after all, is that content discrimination"raises the specter that the Government may effectively
drive certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace,"
Simon & Schuster, 502 U. S., at 116; Leathers v. Medlock,
499 U. S. 439, 448 (1991); FCC v. League of Women Voters of
Cal., 468 U. S. 364, 383-384 (1984); Consolidated Edison Co.,
447 U. S., at 536; Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S.,

sidered and resolved, the issue of content discrimination through regulation of "unprotected" speech--though we plainly recognized that as an
issue in New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747 (1982). It is of course contrary
to all traditions of our jurisprudence to consider the law on this point
conclusively resolved by broad language in cases where the issue was not
presented or even envisioned.

388 R. A. V. v. ST. PAUL

Opinion of the Court
at 95-98. But content discrimination among various in-stances of a class of proscribable speech often does not pose

this threat.When the basis for the content discrimination consists entirely of the very reason the entire class of speech at issue
is proscribable, no significant danger of idea or viewpointdiscrimination exists. Such a reason, having been adjudged

neutral enough to support exclusion of the entire class ofspeech from First Amendment protection, is also neutral
enough to form the basis of distinction within the class. Toillustrate: A State might choose to prohibit only that obscenity which is the most patently offensive in its prurience--
i. e., that which involves the most lascivious displays of sexual activity. But it may not prohibit, for example, only that
obscenity which includes offensive political messages. See
Kucharek v. Hanaway, 902 F. 2d 513, 517 (CA7 1990), cert.
denied, 498 U. S. 1041 (1991). And the Federal Government
can criminalize only those threats of violence that are directed against the President, see 18 U. S. C. $ 871--since the
reasons why threats of violence are outside the First Amendment (protecting individuals from the fear of violence, from
the disruption that fear engenders, and from the possibility
that the threatened violence will occur) have special force
when applied to the person of the President. See Watts v.
United States, 394 U. S. 705, 707 (1969) (upholding the facial
validity of $ 871 because of the "overwhelmin[g] interest in
protecting the safety of [the] Chief Executive and in allowing
him to perform his duties without interference from threats
of physical violence"). But the Federal Government may
not criminalize only those threats against the President that
mention his policy on aid to inner cities. And to take a final
example (one mentioned by Justice Stevens, post, at 421-
422), a State may choose to regulate price advertising in one
industry but not in others, because the risk of fraud (one of
the characteristics of commercial speech that justifies depriving it of full First Amendment protection, see Virginia

Opinion of the Court
State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Ci tizens Consumer
Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748, 771-772 (1976)) is in its view
greater there. Cf. Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.,504 U. S. 374 (1992) (state regulation of airline advertising);

Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U. S. 447 (1978) (state
regulation of lawyer advertising). But a State may not pro-hibit only that commercial advertising that depicts men in a

demeaning fashion. See, e. g., Los Angeles Times, Aug. 8,1989, section 4, p. 6, col. 1.

Another valid basis for according differential treatmentto even a content-defined subclass of proscribable speech is
that the subclass happens to be associated with particular
"secondary effects" of the speech, so that the regulation is
"justified without reference to the content of the . . . speech,"
Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41, 48 (1986)
(quoting, with emphasis, Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy,
supra, at 771); see also Young v. American Mini Theatres,
Inc., 427 U. S. 50, 71, n. 34 (1976) (plurality opinion); id.,
at 80-82 (Powell, J., concurring); Barnes, 501 U. S., at 586
(Souter, J., concurring in judgment). A State could, for example, permit all obscene live performances except those involving minors. Moreover, since words can in some circumstances violate laws directed not against speech but against
conduct (a law against treason, for example, is violated by
telling the enemy the Nation's defense secrets), a particular
content-based subcategory of a proscribable class of speech
can be swept up incidentally within the reach of a statute
directed at conduct rather than speech. See id., at 571 (plurality opinion); id., at 577 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 582 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment); FTC
v. Superior Court Trial Lawyers Assn., 493 U. S. 411, 425-
432 (1990); O'Brien, 391 U. S., at 376-377. Thus, for example, sexually derogatory "fighting words," among other
words, may produce a violation of Title VII's general prohibition against sexual discrimination in employment practices,
42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2; 29 CFR $ 1604.11 (1991). See also 18

Opinion of the Court
U. S. C. $ 242; 42 U. S. C. $$ 1981, 1982. Where the govern-ment does not target conduct on the basis of its expressive

content, acts are not shielded from regulation merely be-cause they express a discriminatory idea or philosophy.

These bases for distinction refute the proposition that theselectivity of the restriction is "even arguably `conditioned
upon the sovereign's agreement with what a speaker mayintend to say.' "

Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U. S.490, 555 (1981) (
Stevens, J., dissenting in part) (citationomitted). There may be other such bases as well. Indeed,

to validate such selectivity (where totally proscribablespeech is at issue) it may not even be necessary to identify
any particular "neutral" basis, so long as the nature of thecontent discrimination is such that there is no realistic possibility that official suppression of ideas is afoot. (We cannotthink of any First Amendment interest that would stand in
the way of a State's prohibiting only those obscene motionpictures with blue-eyed actresses.) Save for that limitation,
the regulation of "fighting words," like the regulation ofnoisy speech, may address some offensive instances and
leave other, equally offensive, instances alone. See Posadas
de Puerto Rico, 478 U. S., at 342-343.6

6 Justice Stevens cites a string of opinions as supporting his assertion
that "selective regulation of speech based on content" is not presumptively
invalid. Post, at 421-422. Analysis reveals, however, that they do not
support it. To begin with, three of them did not command a majority of
the Court, Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U. S. 50, 63-73
(1976) (plurality opinion); FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726, 744-
748 (1978) (plurality opinion); Lehman v. Shaker Heights, 418 U. S. 298
(1974) (plurality opinion), and two others did not even discuss the First
Amendment, Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374 (1992);
Jacob Siegel Co. v. FTC, 327 U. S. 608 (1946). In any event, all that their
contents establish is what we readily concede: that presumptive invalidity
does not mean invariable invalidity, leaving room for such exceptions as
reasonable and viewpoint-neutral content-based discrimination in nonpublic forums, see Lehman, supra, at 301-304; see also Cornelius v. NAACP
Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 806 (1985), or with respect
to certain speech by government employees, see Broadrick v. Oklahoma,

Opinion of the Court

II
Applying these principles to the St. Paul ordinance, weconclude that, even as narrowly construed by the Minnesota

Supreme Court, the ordinance is facially unconstitutional.Although the phrase in the ordinance, "arouses anger, alarm
or resentment in others," has been limited by the MinnesotaSupreme Court's construction to reach only those symbols
or displays that amount to "fighting words," the remaining,unmodified terms make clear that the ordinance applies only
to "fighting words" that insult, or provoke violence, "on thebasis of race, color, creed, religion or gender." Displays containing abusive invective, no matter how vicious or severe,are permissible unless they are addressed to one of the specified disfavored topics. Those who wish to use "fightingwords" in connection with other ideas--to express hostility, for example, on the basis of political affiliation, unionmembership, or homosexuality--are not covered. The First
Amendment does not permit St. Paul to impose special pro-hibitions on those speakers who express views on disfavored
subjects. See Simon & Schuster, 502 U. S., at 116; Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U. S. 221, 229-230 (1987).

In its practical operation, moreover, the ordinance goes
even beyond mere content discrimination, to actual view-point discrimination. Displays containing some words--

odious racial epithets, for example--would be prohibited toproponents of all views. But "fighting words" that do not
themselves invoke race, color, creed, religion, or gender--aspersions upon a person's mother, for example--would
seemingly be usable ad libitum in the placards of thosearguing

in favor of racial, color, etc., tolerance and equality,
but could not be used by those speakers' opponents. One
could hold up a sign saying, for example, that all "anti413 U. S. 601 (1973); see also Civil Service Comm'n v. Letter Carriers, 413

Opinion of the Court
Catholic bigots" are misbegotten; but not that all "papists"are, for that would insult and provoke violence "on the basis

of religion." St. Paul has no such authority to license oneside of a debate to fight freestyle, while requiring the other
to follow Marquis of Queensberry rules.

What we have here, it must be emphasized, is not a prohi-bition of fighting words that are directed at certain persons

or groups (which would be facially valid if it met the re-quirements of the Equal Protection Clause); but rather, a
prohibition of fighting words that contain (as the MinnesotaSupreme Court repeatedly emphasized) messages of "biasmotivated" hatred and in particular, as applied to this case,
messages "based on virulent notions of racial supremacy."
464 N. W. 2d, at 508, 511. One must wholeheartedly agree
with the Minnesota Supreme Court that "[i]t is the responsibility, even the obligation, of diverse communities to confront
such notions in whatever form they appear," id., at 508, but
the manner of that confrontation cannot consist of selective
limitations upon speech. St. Paul's brief asserts that a general "fighting words" law would not meet the city's needs
because only a content-specific measure can communicate
to minority groups that the "group hatred" aspect of such
speech "is not condoned by the majority." Brief for Respondent 25. The point of the First Amendment is that majority preferences must be expressed in some fashion other
than silencing speech on the basis of its content.

Despite the fact that the Minnesota Supreme Court and
St. Paul acknowledge that the ordinance is directed at expression of group hatred, Justice Stevens suggests that
this "fundamentally misreads" the ordinance. Post, at 433.
It is directed, he claims, not to speech of a particular content,
but to particular "injur[ies]" that are "qualitatively different" from other injuries. Post, at 424. This is wordplay.
What makes the anger, fear, sense of dishonor, etc., produced
by violation of this ordinance distinct from the anger, fear,
sense of dishonor, etc., produced by other fighting words is

Opinion of the Court
nothing other than the fact that it is caused by a distinctiveidea, conveyed by a distinctive message. The First Amendment cannot be evaded that easily. It is obvious that thesymbols which will arouse "anger, alarm or resentment in
others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender"
are those symbols that communicate a message of hostilitybased on one of these characteristics. St. Paul concedes in

its brief that the ordinance applies only to "racial, religious,or gender-specific symbols" such as "a burning cross, Nazi
swastika or other instrumentality of like import." Brieffor Respondent 8. Indeed, St. Paul argued in the Juvenile
Court that "[t]he burning of a cross does express a message
and it is, in fact, the content of that message which the St.
Paul Ordinance attempts to legislate." Memorandum from
the Ramsey County Attorney to the Honorable Charles A.
Flinn, Jr., dated July 13, 1990, in In re Welfare of R. A. V.,
No. 89-D-1231 (Ramsey Cty. Juvenile Ct.), p. 1, reprinted in
App. to Brief for Petitioner C-1.

The content-based discrimination reflected in the St. Paul
ordinance comes within neither any of the specific exceptions
to the First Amendment prohibition we discussed earlier nor
a more general exception for content discrimination that
does not threaten censorship of ideas. It assuredly does not
fall within the exception for content discrimination based on
the very reasons why the particular class of speech at issue
(here, fighting words) is proscribable. As explained earlier,
see supra, at 386, the reason why fighting words are categorically excluded from the protection of the First Amendment
is not that their content communicates any particular idea,
but that their content embodies a particularly intolerable
(and socially unnecessary) mode of expressing whatever idea
the speaker wishes to convey. St. Paul has not singled out
an especially offensive mode of expression--it has not, for
example, selected for prohibition only those fighting words
that communicate ideas in a threatening (as opposed to a
merely obnoxious) manner. Rather, it has proscribed fight505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ing words of whatever manner that communicate messagesof racial, gender, or religious intolerance. Selectivity of this

sort creates the possibility that the city is seeking to handi-cap the expression of particular ideas. That possibility
would alone be enough to render the ordinance presump-tively invalid, but St. Paul's comments and concessions in
this case elevate the possibility to a certainty.St. Paul argues that the ordinance comes within another
of the specific exceptions we mentioned, the one that allowscontent discrimination aimed only at the "secondary effects"
of the speech, see Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475U. S. 41 (1986). According to St. Paul, the ordinance is intended, "not to impact on [sic] the right of free expressionof the accused," but rather to "protect against the victimization of a person or persons who are particularly vulner-able because of their membership in a group that historically
has been discriminated against." Brief for Respondent 28.Even assuming that an ordinance that completely proscribes,
rather than merely regulates, a specified category of speechcan ever be considered to be directed only to the secondary
effects of such speech, it is clear that the St. Paul ordinanceis not directed to secondary effects within the meaning of
Renton. As we said in Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312 (1988),"Listeners' reactions to speech are not the type of `secondary
effects' we referred to in Renton." Id., at 321. "The emo-tive impact of speech on its audience is not a `secondary effect.' " Ibid. See also id., at 334 (opinion of Brennan, J.).7

7 St. Paul has not argued in this case that the ordinance merely regulates
that subclass of fighting words which is most likely to provoke a violent
response. But even if one assumes (as appears unlikely) that the categories selected may be so described, that would not justify selective regulation under a "secondary effects" theory. The only reason why such expressive conduct would be especially correlated with violence is that it
conveys a particularly odious message; because the "chain of causation"
thus necessarily "run[s] through the persuasive effect of the expressive
component" of the conduct, Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U. S. 560, 586
(1991) (Souter, J., concurring in judgment), it is clear that the St. Paul

Opinion of the Court
It hardly needs discussion that the ordinance does not fallwithin some more general exception permitting all selectivity that for any reason is beyond the suspicion of official sup-pression of ideas. The statements of St. Paul in this very
case afford ample basis for, if not full confirmation of, thatsuspicion.

Finally, St. Paul and its amici defend the conclusion ofthe Minnesota Supreme Court that, even if the ordinance
regulates expression based on hostility towards its protectedideological content, this discrimination is nonetheless justified because it is narrowly tailored to serve compelling stateinterests. Specifically, they assert that the ordinance helps
to ensure the basic human rights of members of groups thathave historically been subjected to discrimination, including
the right of such group members to live in peace where theywish. We do not doubt that these interests are compelling,
and that the ordinance can be said to promote them. Butthe "danger of censorship" presented by a facially contentbased statute, Leathers v. Medlock, 499 U. S., at 448, requiresthat that weapon be employed only where it is "

necessary toserve the asserted [compelling] interest," Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 199 (1992) (plurality opinion) (emphasisadded); Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn.,
460 U. S. 37, 45 (1983). The existence of adequate content-neutral alternatives thus "undercut[s] significantly" any defense of such a statute, Boos v. Barry, supra, at 329, castingconsiderable doubt on the government's protestations that
"the asserted justification is in fact an accurate descriptionof the purpose and effect of the law,"

Burson, supra, at 213(

Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm'rof Revenue, 460 U. S. 575, 586-587 (1983). The dispositive

question in this case, therefore, is whether content discrimi-nation is reasonably necessary to achieve St. Paul's compelordinance regulates on the basis of the "primary" effect of the speech--
i. e., its persuasive (or repellant) force.

Opinion of the Court
ling interests; it plainly is not. An ordinance not limited
to the favored topics, for example, would have precisely
the same beneficial effect. In fact the only interest distinctively served by the content limitation is that of displaying
the city council's special hostility towards the particular
biases thus singled out.8 That is precisely what the First
Amendment forbids. The politicians of St. Paul are entitled
to express that hostility--but not through the means of
imposing unique limitations upon speakers who (however
benightedly) disagree.

* * *
Let there be no mistake about our belief that burning a
cross in someone's front yard is reprehensible. But St. Paul
has sufficient means at its disposal to prevent such behavior
without adding the First Amendment to the fire.

The judgment of the Minnesota Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

8 A plurality of the Court reached a different conclusion with regard to
the Tennessee antielectioneering statute considered earlier this Term in
Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191 (1992). In light of the "logical connection" between electioneering and the State's compelling interest in preventing voter intimidation and election fraud--an inherent connection
borne out by a "long history" and a "widespread and time-tested consensus," id., at 206, 208, n. 10, 211--the plurality concluded that it was faced
with one of those "rare case[s]" in which the use of a facially content-based
restriction was justified by interests unrelated to the suppression of ideas,
id., at 211; see also id., at 213 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Justice White
and Justice Stevens are therefore quite mistaken when they seek to
convert the Burson plurality's passing comment that "[t]he First Amendment does not require States to regulate for problems that do not exist,"
id., at 207, into endorsement of the revolutionary proposition that the suppression of particular ideas can be justified when only those ideas have
been a source of trouble in the past. Post, at 405 (White, J., concurring

I agree with the majority that the judgment of the Minne-sota Supreme Court should be reversed. However, our
agreement ends there.This case could easily be decided within the contours of
established First Amendment law by holding, as petitionerargues, that the St. Paul ordinance is fatally overbroad because it criminalizes not only unprotected expression but ex-pression protected by the First Amendment. See Part II,
infra. Instead, "find[ing] it unnecessary" to consider thequestions upon which we granted review,

1 The Court granted certiorari to review the following questions:
"1. May a local government enact a content-based, `hate-crime' ordinance prohibiting the display of symbols, including a Nazi swastika or a
burning cross, on public or private property, which one knows or has reason to know arouses anger, alarm, or resentment in others on the basis
of race, color, creed, religion, or gender without violating overbreadth
and vagueness principles of the First Amendment to the United States
Constitution?

"2. Can the constitutionality of such a vague and substantially overbroad content-based restraint of expression be saved by a limiting construction, like that used to save the vague and overbroad content-neutral
laws, restricting its application to `fighting words' or `imminent lawless
action?' " Pet. for Cert. i.

It has long been the rule of this Court that "[o]nly the questions set
forth in the petition, or fairly included therein, will be considered by the
Court." This Court's Rule 14.1(a). This Rule has served to focus the
issues presented for review. But the majority reads the Rule so expansively that any First Amendment theory would appear to be "fairly included" within the questions quoted above.

Contrary to the impression the majority attempts to create through its
selective quotation of petitioner's briefs, see ante, at 381-382, n. 3, petitioner did not present to this Court or the Minnesota Supreme Court anything approximating the novel theory the majority adopts today. Most
certainly petitioner did not "reiterat[e]" such a claim at argument; he responded to a question from the bench, Tr. of Oral Arg. 8. Previously, this
Court has shown the restraint to refrain from deciding cases on the basis

White, J., concurring in judgment
Court holds the ordinance facially unconstitutional on a
ground that was never presented to the Minnesota Supreme
Court, a ground that has not been briefed by the parties
before this Court, a ground that requires serious departures
from the teaching of prior cases and is inconsistent with the
plurality opinion in Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191 (1992),
which was joined by two of the five Justices in the majority
in the present case.

This Court ordinarily is not so eager to abandon its precedents. Twice within the past month, the Court has declined
to overturn longstanding but controversial decisions on questions of constitutional law. See Allied-Signal, Inc. v. Director, Division of Taxation, 504 U. S. 768 (1992); Quill Corp.
v. North Dakota, 504 U. S. 298 (1992). In each case, we had
the benefit of full briefing on the critical issue, so that the
parties and amici had the opportunity to apprise us of the
impact of a change in the law. And in each case, the Court
declined to abandon its precedents, invoking the principle
of stare decisis. Allied-Signal, Inc., supra, at 783-786;
Quill Corp., supra, at 317-318.

But in the present case, the majority casts aside longestablished First Amendment doctrine without the benefit
of briefing and adopts an untried theory. This is hardly a
judicious way of proceeding, and the Court's reasoning in
reaching its result is transparently wrong.

of its own theories when they have not been pressed or passed upon by
a state court of last resort. See, e. g., Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213,
217-224 (1983).

Given this threshold issue, it is my view that the Court lacks jurisdiction
to decide the case on the majority rationale. Cf. Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corp. v. Arkansas Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 461 U. S. 375, 382, n. 6
(1983). Certainly the preliminary jurisdictional and prudential concerns
are sufficiently weighty that we would never have granted certiorari had
petitioner sought review of a question based on the majority's decisional
theory.

I
A

This Court's decisions have plainly stated that expression
falling within certain limited categories so lacks the values
the First Amendment was designed to protect that the Constitution affords no protection to that expression. Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568 (1942), made the point
in the clearest possible terms:

"There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited
classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of
which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem. . . . It has been well observed that such
utterances are no essential part of any exposition of
ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to
truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is
clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and
morality." Id., at 571-572.

See also Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States,
Inc., 466 U. S. 485, 504 (1984) (citing Chaplinsky).

Thus, as the majority concedes, see ante, at 383-384, this
Court has long held certain discrete categories of expression
to be proscribable on the basis of their content. For instance, the Court has held that the individual who falsely
shouts "fire" in a crowded theater may not claim the protection of the First Amendment. Schenck v. United States, 249
U. S. 47, 52 (1919). The Court has concluded that neither
child pornography nor obscenity is protected by the First
Amendment. New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 764 (1982);
Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, 20 (1973); Roth v. United
States, 354 U. S. 476, 484-485 (1957). And the Court has
observed that, "[l]eaving aside the special considerations
when public officials [and public figures] are the target, a
libelous publication is not protected by the Constitution."
Ferber, supra, at 763 (citations omitted).

505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT
400 R. A. V. v. ST. PAUL

White, J., concurring in judgment
All of these categories are content based. But the Courthas held that the First Amendment does not apply to them

because their expressive content is worthless or of de mini-mis value to society. Chaplinsky, supra, at 571-572. We
have not departed from this principle, emphasizing repeat-edly that, "within the confines of [these] given classification[s], the evil to be restricted so overwhelmingly outweighsthe expressive interests, if any, at stake, that no process of
case-by-case adjudication is required." Ferber, supra, at763-764;

Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809, 819 (1975). Thiscategorical approach has provided a principled and narrowly

focused means for distinguishing between expression thatthe government may regulate freely and that which it may
regulate on the basis of content only upon a showing of com-pelling need.

2

Today, however, the Court announces that earlier Courtsdid not mean their repeated statements that certain categories of expression are "not within the area of constitutionallyprotected speech."

Roth, supra, at 483. See ante, at 383,citing Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343 U. S. 250, 266 (1952);

Chaplinsky, supra, at 571-572; Bose Corp., supra, at 504;Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115,
124 (1989). The present Court submits that such clearstatements "must be taken in context" and are not "literally
true." Ante, at 383.To the contrary, those statements meant precisely what
they said: The categorical approach is a firmly entrenchedpart of our First Amendment jurisprudence. Indeed, the
Court in Roth reviewed the guarantees of freedom of expres-sion in effect at the time of the ratification of the Constitution and concluded, "In light of this history, it is apparentthat the unconditional phrasing of the First Amendment was

2 "In each of these areas, the limits of the unprotected category, as well
as the unprotected character of particular communications, have been determined by the judicial evaluation of special facts that have been deemed
to have constitutional significance." Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of

not intended to protect every utterance." 354 U. S., at482-483.

In its decision today, the Court points to "[n]othing . . . inthis Court's precedents warrant[ing] disregard of this longstanding tradition." Burson, 504 U. S., at 216 (Scalia, J.,
concurring in judgment); Allied-Signal, Inc., supra, at 783.Nevertheless, the majority holds that the First Amendment

protects those narrow categories of expression long held tobe undeserving of First Amendment protection--at least to
the extent that lawmakers may not regulate some fightingwords more strictly than others because of their content.
The Court announces that such content-based distinctions vi-olate the First Amendment because "[t]he government may
not regulate use based on hostility--or favoritism--towards
the underlying message expressed." Ante, at 386. Shouldthe government want to criminalize certain fighting words,

the Court now requires it to criminalize all fighting words.To borrow a phrase: "Such a simplistic, all-or-nothing-atall approach to First Amendment protection is at odds withcommon sense and with our jurisprudence as well."

Ante,
at 384. It is inconsistent to hold that the government mayproscribe an entire category of speech because the content

of that speech is evil, Ferber, supra, at 763-764; but that the
government may not treat a subset of that category differently without violating the First Amendment; the content
of the subset is by definition worthless and undeserving of
constitutional protection.

The majority's observation that fighting words are "quite
expressive indeed," ante, at 385, is no answer. Fighting
words are not a means of exchanging views, rallying supporters, or registering a protest; they are directed against
individuals to provoke violence or to inflict injury. Chaplinsky, 315 U. S., at 572. Therefore, a ban on all fighting words
or on a subset of the fighting words category would restrict
only the social evil of hate speech, without creating the danger of driving viewpoints from the marketplace. See ante,
at 387.

402 R. A. V. v. ST. PAUL

White, J., concurring in judgment
Therefore, the Court's insistence on inventing its brand
of First Amendment underinclusiveness puzzles me.3 The
overbreadth doctrine has the redeeming virtue of attempting
to avoid the chilling of protected expression, Broadrick v.
Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 612 (1973); Osborne v. Ohio, 495
U. S. 103, 112, n. 8 (1990); Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc.,
472 U. S. 491, 503 (1985); Ferber, supra, at 772, but the
Court's new "underbreadth" creation serves no desirable
function. Instead, it permits, indeed invites, the continuation of expressive conduct that in this case is evil and worthless in First Amendment terms, see Ferber, supra, at 763-
764; Chaplinsky, supra, at 571-572, until the city of St. Paul
cures the underbreadth by adding to its ordinance a catchall
phrase such as "and all other fighting words that may constitutionally be subject to this ordinance."

Any contribution of this holding to First Amendment jurisprudence is surely a negative one, since it necessarily signals that expressions of violence, such as the message of intimidation and racial hatred conveyed by burning a cross on
someone's lawn, are of sufficient value to outweigh the social
interest in order and morality that has traditionally placed
such fighting words outside the First Amendment.4 Indeed,

by characterizing fighting words as a form of "debate," ante,
at 392, the majority legitimates hate speech as a form of
public discussion.

3 The assortment of exceptions the Court attaches to its rule belies
the majority's claim, see ante, at 387, that its new theory is truly concerned with content discrimination. See Part I-C, infra (discussing the
exceptions).

4 This does not suggest, of course, that cross burning is always unprotected. Burning a cross at a political rally would almost certainly be protected expression. Cf. Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444, 445 (1969).
But in such a context, the cross burning could not be characterized as a
"direct personal insult or an invitation to exchange fisticuffs," Texas v.
Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 409 (1989), to which the fighting words doctrine,
see Part II, infra, applies.

White, J., concurring in judgment
Furthermore, the Court obscures the line between speechthat could be regulated freely on the basis of content (i. e.,

the narrow categories of expression falling outside the FirstAmendment) and that which could be regulated on the basis
of content only upon a showing of a compelling state interest(

i. e., all remaining expression). By placing fighting words,which the Court has long held to be valueless, on at least

equal constitutional footing with political discourse and otherforms of speech that we have deemed to have the greatest
social value, the majority devalues the latter category. SeeBurson v. Freeman, supra, at 196; Eu v. San Francisco Cty.
Democratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 222-223 (1989).

B
In a second break with precedent, the Court refuses tosustain the ordinance even though it would survive under

the strict scrutiny applicable to other protected expression.Assuming, arguendo, that the St. Paul ordinance is a contentbased regulation of protected expression, it neverthelesswould pass First Amendment review under settled law upon
a showing that the regulation " `is necessary to serve a com-pelling state interest and is narrowly drawn to achieve that
end.' " Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State
Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 118 (1991) (quoting Arkan-sas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U. S. 221, 231

(1987)). St. Paul has urged that its ordinance, in the wordsof the majority, "helps to ensure the basic human rights of
members of groups that have historically been subjected todiscrimination . . . ."

Ante, at 395. The Court expresslyconcedes that this interest is compelling and is promoted by

the ordinance. Ibid. Nevertheless, the Court treats strictscrutiny analysis as irrelevant to the constitutionality of
the legislation:

"The dispositive question . . . is whether content dis-crimination is reasonably necessary to achieve St. Paul's

compelling interests; it plainly is not. An ordinance not

White, J., concurring in judgment
limited to the favored topics, for example, would haveprecisely the same beneficial effect." Ante, at 395-396.

Under the majority's view, a narrowly drawn, content-basedordinance could never pass constitutional muster if the object of that legislation could be accomplished by banninga wider category of speech. This appears to be a general
renunciation of strict scrutiny review, a fundamental tool ofFirst Amendment analysis.

5

This abandonment of the doctrine is inexplicable in lightof our decision in Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191 (1992),

which was handed down just a month ago.6 In Burson,seven of the eight participating Members of the Court agreed
that the strict scrutiny standard applied in a case involvinga First Amendment challenge to a content-based statute.
See id., at 198 (plurality opinion); id., at 217 (Stevens, J.,

5 The majority relies on Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312 (1988), in arguing
that the availability of content-neutral alternatives " `undercut[s] significantly' " a claim that content-based legislation is " `necessary to serve the
asserted [compelling] interest.' " Ante, at 395 (quoting Boos, supra, at
329, and Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 199 (1992) (plurality opinion)).
Boos does not support the majority's analysis. In Boos, Congress already
had decided that the challenged legislation was not necessary, and the
Court pointedly deferred to this choice. 485 U. S., at 329. St. Paul lawmakers have made no such legislative choice.

Moreover, in Boos, the Court held that the challenged statute was not
narrowly tailored because a less restrictive alternative was available.
Ibid. But the Court's analysis today turns Boos inside-out by substituting the majority's policy judgment that a more restrictive alternative
could adequately serve the compelling need identified by St. Paul lawmakers. The result would be: (a) a statute that was not tailored to fit the
need identified by the government; and (b) a greater restriction on fighting
words, even though the Court clearly believes that fighting words have
protected expressive content. Ante, at 384-385.

6 Earlier this Term, seven of the eight participating Members of the

Court agreed that strict scrutiny analysis applied in Simon & Schuster,
Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105 (1991), in
which we struck down New York's "Son of Sam" law, which required "that
an accused or convicted criminal's income from works describing his crime
be deposited in an escrow account." Id., at 108.

dissenting).7 The statute at issue prohibited the solicitationof votes and the display or distribution of campaign materials

within 100 feet of the entrance to a polling place. The plu-rality concluded that the legislation survived strict scrutiny
because the State had asserted a compelling interest in regu-lating electioneering near polling places and because the
statute at issue was narrowly tailored to accomplish thatgoal.

Id., at 208-210.Significantly, the statute in Burson did not proscribe all

speech near polling places; it restricted only political speech.Id., at 197. The Burson plurality, which included

The
Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy, concluded that thedistinction between types of speech required application of

strict scrutiny, but it squarely rejected the proposition thatthe legislation failed First Amendment review because it
could have been drafted in broader, content-neutral terms:

"States adopt laws to address the problems that con-front them. The First Amendment does not require

States to regulate for problems that do not exist." Id.,at 207 (emphasis added).

This reasoning is in direct conflict with the majority's analy-sis in the present case, which leaves two options to lawmakers attempting to regulate expressions of violence: (1) enacta sweeping prohibition on an entire class of speech (thereby
requiring "regulat[ion] for problems that do not exist"); or(2) not legislate at all.

Had the analysis adopted by the majority in the presentcase been applied in

Burson, the challenged election lawwould have failed constitutional review, for its content-based

distinction between political and nonpolitical speech couldnot have been characterized as "reasonably necessary," ante,

applying strict scrutiny; they objected that the plurality was not sufficiently rigorous in its review. 504 U. S., at 225-226 (Stevens, J.,

As with its rejection of the Court's categorical analysis,the majority offers no reasoned basis for discarding our

firmly established strict scrutiny analysis at this time. Themajority appears to believe that its doctrinal revisionism is
necessary to prevent our elected lawmakers from prohibiting
libel against members of one political party but not anotherand from enacting similarly preposterous laws.

Ante, at
384. The majority is misguided.Although the First Amendment does not apply to categories of unprotected speech, such as fighting words, the EqualProtection Clause requires that the regulation of unprotected speech be rationally related to a legitimate government interest. A defamation statute that drew distinctionson the basis of political affiliation or "an ordinance prohibiting only those legally obscene works that contain criticism
of the city government," ibid., would unquestionably fail
rational-basis review.9

8 Justice Scalia concurred in the judgment in Burson, reasoning that
the statute, "though content based, is constitutional [as] a reasonable,
viewpoint-neutral regulation of a nonpublic forum." Id., at 214. However, nothing in his reasoning in the present case suggests that a contentbased ban on fighting words would be constitutional were that ban limited
to nonpublic fora. Taken together, the two opinions suggest that, in some
settings, political speech, to which "the First Amendment `has its fullest
and most urgent application,' " is entitled to less constitutional protection
than fighting words. Eu v. San Francisco Cty. Democratic Central
Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 223 (1989) (quoting Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy, 401
U. S. 265, 272 (1971)).

9 The majority is mistaken in stating that a ban on obscene works critical

of government would fail equal protection review only because the ban
would violate the First Amendment. Ante, at 384-385, n. 4. While decisions such as Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92 (1972), recognize that First Amendment principles may be relevant to an equal protection claim challenging distinctions that impact on protected expression,
id., at 95-99, there is no basis for linking First and Fourteenth Amendment analysis in a case involving unprotected expression. Certainly, one

White, J., concurring in judgment
Turning to the St. Paul ordinance and assuming, arguendo,
as the majority does, that the ordinance is not constitutionally overbroad (but see Part II, infra), there is no question
that it would pass equal protection review. The ordinance
proscribes a subset of "fighting words," those that injure "on
the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender." This
selective regulation reflects the city's judgment that harms
based on race, color, creed, religion, or gender are more
pressing public concerns than the harms caused by other
fighting words. In light of our Nation's long and painful
experience with discrimination, this determination is plainly
reasonable. Indeed, as the majority concedes, the interest
is compelling. Ante, at 395.

C
The Court has patched up its argument with an apparently
nonexhaustive list of ad hoc exceptions, in what can be
viewed either as an attempt to confine the effects of its decision to the facts of this case, see post, at 415 (Blackmun, J.,
concurring in judgment), or as an effort to anticipate some
of the questions that will arise from its radical revision of
First Amendment law.

For instance, if the majority were to give general application to the rule on which it decides this case, today's decision
would call into question the constitutionality of the statute
making it illegal to threaten the life of the President. 18
U. S. C. $ 871. See Watts v. United States, 394 U. S. 705
(1969) (per curiam). Surely, this statute, by singling out
certain threats, incorporates a content-based distinction; it
indicates that the Government especially disfavors threats
against the President as opposed to threats against all othneed not resort to First Amendment principles to conclude that the sort
of improbable legislation the majority hypothesizes is based on senseless
distinctions.

408 R. A. V. v. ST. PAUL

White, J., concurring in judgment
ers.10 See ante, at 391. But because the Government couldprohibit all threats and not just those directed against the

President, under the Court's theory, the compelling reasonsjustifying the enactment of special legislation to safeguard
the President would be irrelevant, and the statute would failFirst Amendment review.

To save the statute, the majority has engrafted the follow-ing exception onto its newly announced First Amendment
rule: Content-based distinctions may be drawn within anunprotected category of speech if the basis for the distinctions is "the very reason the entire class of speech at issueis proscribable."

Ante, at 388. Thus, the argument goes,the statute making it illegal to threaten the life of the President is constitutional, "since the reasons why threats of vio-lence are outside the First Amendment (protecting individuals from the fear of violence, from the disruption that fearengenders, and from the possibility that the threatened violence will occur) have special force when applied to the per-son of the President."

Ibid.The exception swallows the majority's rule. Certainly, it

should apply to the St. Paul ordinance, since "the reasonswhy [fighting words] are outside the First Amendment . . .
have special force when applied to [groups that have histori-cally been subjected to discrimination]."

To avoid the result of its own analysis, the Court suggeststhat fighting words are simply a mode of communication,
rather than a content-based category, and that the St. Paulordinance has not singled out a particularly objectionable
mode of communication. Ante, at 386, 393. Again, the ma-jority confuses the issue. A prohibition on fighting words is
not a time, place, or manner restriction; it is a ban on a classof speech that conveys an overriding message of personal
injury and imminent violence, Chaplinsky, 315 U. S., at 572,a message that is at its ugliest when directed against groups

10 Indeed, such a law is content based in and of itself because it distinguishes between threatening and nonthreatening speech.

that have long been the targets of discrimination. Accord-ingly, the ordinance falls within the first exception to the

majority's theory.As its second exception, the Court posits that certain
content-based regulations will survive under the new regimeif the regulated subclass "happens to be associated with particular `secondary effects' of the speech . . . ," ante, at 389,which the majority treats as encompassing instances in
which "words can . . . violate laws directed not against speechbut against conduct . . . ,"

ibid.11 Again, there is a simpleexplanation for the Court's eagerness to craft an exception

to its new First Amendment rule: Under the general rulethe Court applies in this case, Title VII hostile work environment claims would suddenly be unconstitutional.Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it unlawful
to discriminate "because of [an] individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin," 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1), andthe regulations covering hostile workplace claims forbid

"sexual harassment," which includes "[u]nwelcome sexual ad-vances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature" that create "an intimidat-ing, hostile, or offensive working environment," 29 CFR

$ 1604.11(a) (1991). The regulation does not prohibit work-place harassment generally; it focuses on what the majority
would characterize as the "disfavored topi[c]" of sexual harassment. Ante, at 391. In this way, Title VII is similar tothe St. Paul ordinance that the majority condemns because

it "impose[s] special prohibitions on those speakers whoexpress views on disfavored subjects."

Ibid. Under the
broad principle the Court uses to decide the present case,

11 The consequences of the majority's conflation of the rarely used secondary effects standard and the O'Brien test for conduct incorporating
"speech" and "nonspeech" elements, see generally United States v.
O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 376-377 (1968), present another question that I
fear will haunt us and the lower courts in the aftermath of the majority's
opinion.

410 R. A. V. v. ST. PAUL

White, J., concurring in judgment
hostile work environment claims based on sexual harassmentshould fail First Amendment review; because a general ban

on harassment in the workplace would cover the problem ofsexual harassment, any attempt to proscribe the subcategory
of sexually harassing expression would violate the First
Amendment.Hence, the majority's second exception, which the Court

indicates would insulate a Title VII hostile work environ-ment claim from an underinclusiveness challenge because
"sexually derogatory `fighting words' . . . may produce a vio-lation of Title VII's general prohibition against sexual discrimination in employment practices." Ante, at 389. Butapplication of this exception to a hostile work environment
claim does not hold up under close examination.

First, the hostile work environment regulation is notkeyed to the presence or absence of an economic

quid pro
quo, Meritor Savings Bank, F. S. B. v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57,65 (1986), but to the impact of the speech on the victimized

worker. Consequently, the regulation would no more fallwithin a secondary effects exception than does the St. Paul
ordinance. Ante, at 394. Second, the majority's focus onthe statute's general prohibition on discrimination glosses
over the language of the specific regulation governing hostile
working environment, which reaches beyond any "incidental" effect on speech. United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S.
367, 376 (1968). If the relationship between the broader
statute and specific regulation is sufficent to bring the Title
VII regulation within O'Brien, then all St. Paul need do to
bring its ordinance within this exception is to add some prefatory language concerning discrimination generally.

As to the third exception to the Court's theory for deciding
this case, the majority concocts a catchall exclusion to protect against unforeseen problems, a concern that is heightened here given the lack of briefing on the majority's decisional theory. This final exception would apply in cases in
which "there is no realistic possibility that official suppression of ideas is afoot." Ante, at 390. As I have demon505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT

411Cite as: 505 U. S. 377 (1992)
White, J., concurring in judgment
strated, this case does not concern the official suppression ofideas. See supra, at 401. The majority discards this notion

out of hand. Ante, at 395.As I see it, the Court's theory does not work and will do
nothing more than confuse the law. Its selection of this caseto rewrite First Amendment law is particularly inexplicable,
because the whole problem could have been avoided by de-ciding this case under settled First Amendment principles.

II
Although I disagree with the Court's analysis, I do agreewith its conclusion: The St. Paul ordinance is unconstitutional. However, I would decide the case on overbreadthgrounds.

We have emphasized time and again that overbreadth doc-trine is an exception to the established principle that "a person to whom a statute may constitutionally be applied willnot be heard to challenge that statute on the ground that it
may conceivably be applied unconstitutionally to others, inother situations not before the Court." Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S., at 610; Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc.,472 U. S., at 503-504. A defendant being prosecuted for
speech or expressive conduct may challenge the law on itsface if it reaches protected expression, even when that person's activities are not protected by the First Amendment.This is because "the possible harm to society in permitting
some unprotected speech to go unpunished is outweighedby the possibility that protected speech of others may
be muted." Broadrick, supra, at 612; Osborne v. Ohio, 495U. S., at 112, n. 8;

New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S., at 768-769;
Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U. S.620, 634 (1980); Gooding v. Wilson, 405 U. S. 518, 521 (1972).

However, we have consistently held that, because over-breadth analysis is "strong medicine," it may be invoked to
strike an entire statute only when the overbreadth of thestatute is not only "real, but substantial as well, judged in
relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep," Broad505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT

rick, 413 U. S., at 615, and when the statute is not suscepti-ble to limitation or partial invalidation,

id., at 613; Board of
Airport Comm'rs of Los Angeles v. Jews for Jesus, Inc., 482U. S. 569, 574 (1987). "When a federal court is dealing with

a federal statute challenged as overbroad, it should . . . construe the statute to avoid constitutional problems, if the stat-ute is subject to a limiting construction."

Ferber, 458 U. S.,
at 769, n. 24. Of course, "[a] state court is also free to dealwith a state statute in the same way."

Ibid. See, e. g.,
Osborne, 495 U. S., at 113-114.Petitioner contends that the St. Paul ordinance is not susceptible to a narrowing construction and that the ordinancetherefore should be considered as written, and not as construed by the Minnesota Supreme Court. Petitioner is
wrong. Where a state court has interpreted a provision ofstate law, we cannot ignore that interpretation, even if it is

not one that we would have reached if we were construing
the statute in the first instance. Ibid.; Kolender v. Lawson,
461 U. S. 352, 355 (1983); Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 494, n. 5 (1982).12

Of course, the mere presence of a state court interpretation does not insulate a statute from overbreadth review.
We have stricken legislation when the construction supplied
by the state court failed to cure the overbreadth problem.

12 Petitioner can derive no support from our statement in Virginia v.
American Booksellers Assn., Inc., 484 U. S. 383, 397 (1988), that "the statute must be `readily susceptible' to the limitation; we will not rewrite
a state law to conform it to constitutional requirements." In American
Booksellers, no state court had construed the language in dispute. In
that instance, we certified a question to the state court so that it would
have an opportunity to provide a narrowing interpretation. Ibid. In
Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205, 216 (1975), the other case upon
which petitioner principally relies, we observed not only that the ordinance at issue was not "by its plain terms . . . easily susceptible of a
narrowing construction," but that the state courts had made no effort to
restrict the scope of the statute when it was challenged on overbreadth
grounds.

White, J., concurring in judgment
See, e. g., Lewis v. New Orleans, 415 U. S. 130, 132-133 (1974);
Gooding, supra, at 524-525. But in such cases, we have
looked to the statute as construed in determining whetherit contravened the First Amendment. Here, the Minnesota Supreme Court has provided an authoritative construction of the St. Paul antibias ordinance. Considerationof petitioner's overbreadth claim must be based on that

interpretation.I agree with petitioner that the ordinance is invalid on its
face. Although the ordinance as construed reaches catego-ries of speech that are constitutionally unprotected, it also
criminalizes a substantial amount of expression that--however repugnant--is shielded by the First Amendment.

In attempting to narrow the scope of the St. Paul antibias
ordinance, the Minnesota Supreme Court relied upon two of
the categories of speech and expressive conduct that fall outside the First Amendment's protective sphere: words that
incite "imminent lawless action," Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395
U. S. 444, 449 (1969), and "fighting" words, Chaplinsky v.
New Hampshire, 315 U. S., at 571-572. The Minnesota
Supreme Court erred in its application of the Chaplinsky
fighting words test and consequently interpreted the St.
Paul ordinance in a fashion that rendered the ordinance
facially overbroad.

In construing the St. Paul ordinance, the Minnesota Supreme Court drew upon the definition of fighting words that
appears in Chaplinsky--words "which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of
the peace." Id., at 572. However, the Minnesota court was
far from clear in identifying the "injur[ies]" inflicted by the
expression that St. Paul sought to regulate. Indeed, the
Minnesota court emphasized (tracking the language of the
ordinance) that "the ordinance censors only those displays
that one knows or should know will create anger, alarm or
resentment based on racial, ethnic, gender or religious bias."
In re Welfare of R. A. V., 464 N. W. 2d 507, 510 (1991). I

505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT
414 R. A. V. v. ST. PAUL

White, J., concurring in judgment
therefore understand the court to have ruled that St. Paul
may constitutionally prohibit expression that "by its very
utterance" causes "anger, alarm or resentment."

Our fighting words cases have made clear, however, that
such generalized reactions are not sufficient to strip expression of its constitutional protection. The mere fact that expressive activity causes hurt feelings, offense, or resentment
does not render the expression unprotected. See United
States v. Eichman, 496 U. S. 310, 319 (1990); Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 409, 414 (1989); Hustler Magazine, Inc. v.
Falwell, 485 U. S. 46, 55-56 (1988); FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726, 745 (1978); Hess v. Indiana, 414 U. S. 105,
107-108 (1973); Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15, 20 (1971);
Street v. New York, 394 U. S. 576, 592 (1969); Terminiello v.

Chicago, 337 U. S. 1 (1949).

In the First Amendment context, "[c]riminal statutes must
be scrutinized with particular care; those that make unlawful
a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct
may be held facially invalid even if they also have legitimate
application." Houston v. Hill, 482 U. S. 451, 459 (1987) (citation omitted). The St. Paul antibias ordinance is such a law.
Although the ordinance reaches conduct that is unprotected,
it also makes criminal expressive conduct that causes only
hurt feelings, offense, or resentment, and is protected by the
First Amendment. Cf. Lewis, supra, at 132.13 The ordinance is therefore fatally overbroad and invalid on its face.

13 Although the First Amendment protects offensive speech, Johnson v.
Texas, 491 U. S., at 414, it does not require us to be subjected to such
expression at all times, in all settings. We have held that such expression
may be proscribed when it intrudes upon a "captive audience." Frisby v.
Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 484-485 (1988); FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438
U. S. 726, 748-749 (1978). And expression may be limited when it merges
into conduct. United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367 (1968); cf. Meritor
Savings Bank, F. S. B. v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57, 65 (1986). However, because of the manner in which the Minnesota Supreme Court construed the
St. Paul ordinance, those issues are not before us in this case.

III
Today, the Court has disregarded two established princi-ples of First Amendment law without providing a coherent

replacement theory. Its decision is an arid, doctrinaire in-terpretation, driven by the frequently irresistible impulse of
judges to tinker with the First Amendment. The decisionis mischievous at best and will surely confuse the lower
courts. I join the judgment, but not the folly of the opinion.

Justice Blackmun, concurring in the judgment.
I regret what the Court has done in this case. The major-ity opinion signals one of two possibilities: It will serve as

precedent for future cases, or it will not. Either result isdisheartening.

In the first instance, by deciding that a State cannot regu-late speech that causes great harm unless it also regulates
speech that does not (setting law and logic on their heads),the Court seems to abandon the categorical approach, and
inevitably to relax the level of scrutiny applicable to content-based laws. As

Justice White points out, this weakensthe traditional protections of speech. If all expressive activity must be accorded the same protection, that protectionwill be scant. The simple reality is that the Court will
never provide child pornography or cigarette advertising thelevel of protection customarily granted political speech. If
we are forbidden to categorize, as the Court has done here,we shall reduce protection across the board. It is sad that
in its effort to reach a satisfying result in this case, the Courtis willing to weaken First Amendment protections.

In the second instance is the possibility that this case willnot significantly alter First Amendment jurisprudence but,
instead, will be regarded as an aberration--a case where theCourt manipulated doctrine to strike down an ordinance
whose premise it opposed, namely, that racial threats andverbal assaults are of greater harm than other fighting
words. I fear that the Court has been distracted from its

416 R. A. V. v. ST. PAUL

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
proper mission by the temptation to decide the issue over
"politically correct speech" and "cultural diversity," neither
of which is presented here. If this is the meaning of today's
opinion, it is perhaps even more regrettable.

I see no First Amendment values that are compromised
by a law that prohibits hoodlums from driving minorities out
of their homes by burning crosses on their lawns, but I see
great harm in preventing the people of Saint Paul from
specifically punishing the race-based fighting words that so
prejudice their community.

I concur in the judgment, however, because I agree with
Justice White that this particular ordinance reaches beyond fighting words to speech protected by the First
Amendment.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice White and Justice Blackmun join as to Part I, concurring in the
judgment.

Conduct that creates special risks or causes special harms
may be prohibited by special rules. Lighting a fire near an
ammunition dump or a gasoline storage tank is especially
dangerous; such behavior may be punished more severely
than burning trash in a vacant lot. Threatening someone
because of her race or religious beliefs may cause particularly severe trauma or touch off a riot, and threatening a
high public official may cause substantial social disruption;
such threats may be punished more severely than threats
against someone based on, say, his support of a particular
athletic team. There are legitimate, reasonable, and neutral
justifications for such special rules.

This case involves the constitutionality of one such ordinance. Because the regulated conduct has some communicative content--a message of racial, religious, or gender
hostility--the ordinance raises two quite different First
Amendment questions. Is the ordinance "overbroad" be505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT

417Cite as: 505 U. S. 377 (1992)
Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
cause it prohibits too much speech? If not, is it "underbroad" because it does not prohibit enough speech?

In answering these questions, my colleagues today wrestle
with two broad principles: first, that certain "categories
of expression [including `fighting words'] are `not within
the area of constitutionally protected speech,' " ante, at
400 (White, J., concurring in judgment); and second, that
"[c]ontent-based regulations [of expression] are presumptively invalid," ante, at 382 (majority opinion). Although in
past opinions the Court has repeated both of these maxims,
it has--quite rightly--adhered to neither with the absolutism suggested by my colleagues. Thus, while I agree that
the St. Paul ordinance is unconstitutionally overbroad for the
reasons stated in Part II of Justice White's opinion, I write
separately to suggest how the allure of absolute principles
has skewed the analysis of both the majority and Justice
White's opinions.

I

Fifty years ago, the Court articulated a categorical approach to First Amendment jurisprudence.

"There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited
classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of
which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem. . . . It has been well observed that such
utterances are no essential part of any exposition of
ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to
truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is
clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and
morality." Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S.
568, 571-572 (1942).

We have, as Justice White observes, often described such
categories of expression as "not within the area of constitutionally protected speech." Roth v. United States, 354 U. S.
476, 483 (1957).

505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT
418 R. A. V. v. ST. PAUL

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
The Court today revises this categorical approach. It isnot, the Court rules, that certain "categories" of expression

are "unprotected," but rather that certain "elements" of ex-pression are wholly "proscribable." To the Court, an expressive act, like a chemical compound, consists of more than
one element. Although the act may be regulated because itcontains a proscribable element, it may not be regulated on

the basis of another (nonproscribable) element it also con-tains. Thus, obscene antigovernment speech may be regulated because it is obscene, but not because it is antigovern-ment.

Ante, at 384. It is this revision of the categorical
approach that allows the Court to assume that the St. Paul
ordinance proscribes only fighting words, while at the same
time concluding that the ordinance is invalid because it imposes a content-based regulation on expressive activity.

As an initial matter, the Court's revision of the categorical
approach seems to me something of an adventure in a doctrinal wonderland, for the concept of "obscene antigovernment" speech is fantastical. The category of the obscene is
very narrow; to be obscene, expression must be found by the
trier of fact to "appea[l] to the prurient interest, . . . depic[t]
or describ[e], in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct,
[and], taken as a whole, lac[k] serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value." Miller v. California, 413 U. S.
15, 24 (1973) (emphasis added). "Obscene antigovernment"
speech, then, is a contradiction in terms: If expression is antigovernment, it does not "lac[k] serious . . . political . . . value"
and cannot be obscene.

The Court attempts to bolster its argument by likening its
novel analysis to that applied to restrictions on the time,
place, or manner of expression or on expressive conduct. It
is true that loud speech in favor of the Republican Party can
be regulated because it is loud, but not because it is proRepublican; and it is true that the public burning of the
American flag can be regulated because it involves public
burning and not because it involves the flag. But these anal505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT

419Cite as: 505 U. S. 377 (1992)
Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
ogies are inapposite. In each of these examples, the two
elements (e. g., loudness and pro-Republican orientation) can
coexist; in the case of "obscene antigovernment" speech,
however, the presence of one element ("obscenity") by definition means the absence of the other. To my mind, it is
unwise and unsound to craft a new doctrine based on such
highly speculative hypotheticals.

I am, however, even more troubled by the second step of
the Court's analysis--namely, its conclusion that the St. Paul
ordinance is an unconstitutional content-based regulation of
speech. Drawing on broadly worded dicta, the Court establishes a near-absolute ban on content-based regulations of
expression and holds that the First Amendment prohibits
the regulation of fighting words by subject matter. Thus,
while the Court rejects the "all-or-nothing-at-all" nature of
the categorical approach, ante, at 384, it promptly embraces
an absolutism of its own: Within a particular "proscribable"
category of expression, the Court holds, a government must
either proscribe all speech or no speech at all.1 This aspect
of the Court's ruling fundamentally misunderstands the role
and constitutional status of content-based regulations on
speech, conflicts with the very nature of First Amendment
jurisprudence, and disrupts well-settled principles of First
Amendment law.

1 The Court disputes this characterization because it has crafted two
exceptions, one for "certain media or markets" and the other for content
discrimination based upon "the very reason that the entire class of speech
at issue is proscribable." Ante, at 388. These exceptions are, at best, ill
defined. The Court does not tell us whether, with respect to the former,
fighting words such as cross burning could be proscribed only in certain
neighborhoods where the threat of violence is particularly severe, or
whether, with respect to the second category, fighting words that create a
particular risk of harm (such as a race riot) would be proscribable. The
hypothetical and illusory category of these two exceptions persuades me
that either my description of the Court's analysis is accurate or that the
Court does not in fact mean much of what it says in its opinion.

420 R. A. V. v. ST. PAUL

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
Although the Court has, on occasion, declared that
content-based regulations of speech are "never permitted,"
Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 99 (1972),
such claims are overstated. Indeed, in Mosley itself, the
Court indicated that Chicago's selective proscription of nonlabor picketing was not per se unconstitutional, but rather
could be upheld if the city demonstrated that nonlabor picketing was "clearly more disruptive than [labor] picketing."
Id., at 100. Contrary to the broad dicta in Mosley and elsewhere, our decisions demonstrate that content-based distinctions, far from being presumptively invalid, are an inevitable
and indispensable aspect of a coherent understanding of the
First Amendment.

This is true at every level of First Amendment law. In
broadest terms, our entire First Amendment jurisprudence
creates a regime based on the content of speech. The scope
of the First Amendment is determined by the content of expressive activity: Although the First Amendment broadly
protects "speech," it does not protect the right to "fix prices,
breach contracts, make false warranties, place bets with
bookies, threaten, [or] extort." Schauer, Categories and the
First Amendment: A Play in Three Acts, 34 Vand. L. Rev.
265, 270 (1981). Whether an agreement among competitors
is a violation of the Sherman Act or protected activity under
the Noerr-Pennington doctrine 2 hinges upon the content of
the agreement. Similarly, "the line between permissible advocacy and impermissible incitation to crime or violence depends, not merely on the setting in which the speech occurs,
but also on exactly what the speaker had to say." Young v.

Likewise, whether speech falls within one of the cate-gories of "unprotected" or "proscribable" expression is determined, in part, by its content. Whether a magazine isobscene, a gesture a fighting word, or a photograph child
pornography is determined, in part, by its content. Even
within categories of protected expression, the First Amend-ment status of speech is fixed by its content.

New York
Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964), and Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U. S. 749 (1985),
establish that the level of protection given to speech dependsupon its subject matter: Speech about public officials or

matters of public concern receives greater protection than
speech about other topics. It can, therefore, scarcely be said
that the regulation of expressive activity cannot be predicated on its content: Much of our First Amendment jurisprudence is premised on the assumption that content makes a
difference.

Consistent with this general premise, we have frequently
upheld content-based regulations of speech. For example,
in Young v. American Mini Theatres, the Court upheld zoning ordinances that regulated movie theaters based on the
content of the films shown. In FCC v. Pacifica Foundation,
438 U. S. 726 (1978) (plurality opinion), we upheld a restriction on the broadcast of specific indecent words. In Lehman
v. Shaker Heights, 418 U. S. 298 (1974) (plurality opinion), we
upheld a city law that permitted commercial advertising, but
prohibited political advertising, on city buses. In Broadrick
v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601 (1973), we upheld a state law
that restricted the speech of state employees, but only as
concerned partisan political matters. We have long recognized the power of the Federal Trade Commission to regulate misleading advertising and labeling, see, e. g., Jacob
Siegel Co. v. FTC, 327 U. S. 608 (1946), and the National
Labor Relations Board's power to regulate an employer's
election-related speech on the basis of its content, see, e. g.,
NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U. S. 575, 616-618 (1969).

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
It is also beyond question that the Government may chooseto limit advertisements for cigarettes, see 15 U. S. C. $$ 1331-

1340,3 but not for cigars; choose to regulate airline advertis-ing, see Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374
(1992), but not bus advertising; or choose to monitor solicita-tion by lawyers, see

Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436U. S. 447 (1978), but not by doctors.

All of these cases involved the selective regulation ofspeech based on content--precisely the sort of regulation the
Court invalidates today. Such selective regulations are un-avoidably content based, but they are not, in my opinion,
"presumptively invalid." As these many decisions and ex-amples demonstrate, the prohibition on content-based regulations is not nearly as total as the Mosley dictum suggests.Disregarding this vast body of case law, the Court today
goes beyond even the overstatement in Mosley and appliesthe prohibition on content-based regulation to speech that
the Court had until today considered wholly "unprotected"by the First Amendment--namely, fighting words. This
new absolutism in the prohibition of content-based regula-tions severely contorts the fabric of settled First Amendment law.Our First Amendment decisions have created a rough hierarchy in the constitutional protection of speech. Core politi-cal speech occupies the highest, most protected position;
commercial speech and nonobscene, sexually explicit speechare regarded as a sort of second-class expression; obscenity
and fighting words receive the least protection of all. Assum-ing that the Court is correct that this last class of speech is
not wholly "unprotected," it certainly does not follow thatfighting words and obscenity receive the

same sort of pro-tection afforded core political speech. Yet in ruling that

proscribable speech cannot be regulated based on subject

matter, the Court does just that.4 Perversely, this givesfighting words

greater protection than is afforded commercial speech. If Congress can prohibit false advertising di-rected at airline passengers without also prohibiting false

advertising directed at bus passengers and if a city can
prohibit political advertisements in its buses while allowingother advertisements, it is ironic to hold that a city cannot

regulate fighting words based on "race, color, creed, religionor gender" while leaving unregulated fighting words based
on "union membership . . . or homosexuality." Ante, at 391.The Court today turns First Amendment law on its head:
Communication that was once entirely unprotected (and that
still can be wholly proscribed) is now entitled to greater protection than commercial speech--and possibly greater protection than core political speech. See Burson v. Freeman,
504 U. S. 191, 195, 196 (1992).

Perhaps because the Court recognizes these perversities,
it quickly offers some ad hoc limitations on its newly extended prohibition on content-based regulations. First, the
Court states that a content-based regulation is valid "[w]hen
the basis for the content discrimination consists entirely of
the very reason the entire class of speech . . . is proscribable." Ante, at 388. In a pivotal passage, the Court writes:

"[T]he Federal Government can criminalize only those
threats of violence that are directed against the President, see 18 U. S. C. $ 871--since the reasons why

4 The Court states that the prohibition on content-based regulations "applies differently in the context of proscribable speech" than in the context
of other speech, ante, at 387, but its analysis belies that claim. The Court
strikes down the St. Paul ordinance because it regulates fighting words
based on subject matter, despite the fact that, as demonstrated above, we
have long upheld regulations of commercial speech based on subject matter. The Court's self-description is inapt: By prohibiting the regulation
of fighting words based on its subject matter, the Court provides the same
protection to fighting words as is currently provided to core political
speech.

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
threats of violence are outside the First Amendment
(protecting individuals from the fear of violence, from
the disruption that fear engenders, and from the possibility that the threatened violence will occur) have special force when applied to the . . . President." Ibid.

As I understand this opaque passage, Congress may choose
from the set of unprotected speech (all threats) to proscribe
only a subset (threats against the President) because those
threats are particularly likely to cause "fear of violence,"
"disruption," and actual "violence."

Precisely this same reasoning, however, compels the conclusion that St. Paul's ordinance is constitutional. Just as
Congress may determine that threats against the President
entail more severe consequences than other threats, so St.
Paul's City Council may determine that threats based on the
target's race, religion, or gender cause more severe harm to
both the target and to society than other threats. This latter judgment--that harms caused by racial, religious, and
gender-based invective are qualitatively different from that
caused by other fighting words--seems to me eminently reasonable and realistic.

Next, the Court recognizes that a State may regulate advertising in one industry but not another because "the risk
of fraud (one of the characteristics . . . that justifies depriving
[commercial speech] of full First Amendment protection . . .)"
in the regulated industry is "greater" than in other industries. Ibid. Again, the same reasoning demonstrates the
constitutionality of St. Paul's ordinance. "[O]ne of the characteristics that justifies" the constitutional status of fighting
words is that such words "by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace."
Chaplinsky, 315 U. S., at 572. Certainly a legislature that
may determine that the risk of fraud is greater in the legal

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
trade than in the medical trade may determine that the risk
of injury or breach of peace created by race-based threats is
greater than that created by other threats.

Similarly, it is impossible to reconcile the Court's analysis
of the St. Paul ordinance with its recognition that "a prohibition of fighting words that are directed at certain persons or
groups . . . would be facially valid." Ante, at 392 (emphasis
deleted). A selective proscription of unprotected expression designed to protect "certain persons or groups" (for example, a law proscribing threats directed at the elderly)
would be constitutional if it were based on a legitimate determination that the harm created by the regulated expression differs from that created by the unregulated expression
(that is, if the elderly are more severely injured by threats
than are the nonelderly). Such selective protection is no different from a law prohibiting minors (and only minors) from
obtaining obscene publications. See Ginsberg v. New York,
390 U. S. 629 (1968). St. Paul has determined--reasonably
in my judgment--that fighting-word injuries "based on race,
color, creed, religion or gender" are qualitatively different
and more severe than fighting-word injuries based on other
characteristics. Whether the selective proscription of proscribable speech is defined by the protected target ("certain
persons or groups") or the basis of the harm (injuries "based
on race, color, creed, religion or gender") makes no constitutional difference: What matters is whether the legislature's
selection is based on a legitimate, neutral, and reasonable
distinction.

In sum, the central premise of the Court's ruling--that
"[c]ontent-based regulations are presumptively invalid"--
has simplistic appeal, but lacks support in our First Amendment jurisprudence. To make matters worse, the Court
today extends this overstated claim to reach categories of
hitherto unprotected speech and, in doing so, wreaks havoc
in an area of settled law. Finally, although the Court recog505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
nizes exceptions to its new principle, those exceptions undermine its very conclusion that the St. Paul ordinance is unconstitutional. Stated directly, the majority's position cannot
withstand scrutiny.

II

Although I agree with much of Justice White's analysis,
I do not join Part I-A of his opinion because I have reservations about the "categorical approach" to the First Amendment. These concerns, which I have noted on other occasions, see, e. g., New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 778 (1982)
(opinion concurring in judgment), lead me to find Justice
White's response to the Court's analysis unsatisfying.

Admittedly, the categorical approach to the First Amendment has some appeal: Either expression is protected or it
is not--the categories create safe harbors for governments
and speakers alike. But this approach sacrifices subtlety for
clarity and is, I am convinced, ultimately unsound. As an
initial matter, the concept of "categories" fits poorly with the
complex reality of expression. Few dividing lines in First
Amendment law are straight and unwavering, and efforts at
categorization inevitably give rise only to fuzzy boundaries.
Our definitions of "obscenity," see, e. g., Marks v. United
States, 430 U. S. 188, 198 (1977) (Stevens, J., concurring in
part and dissenting in part), and "public forum," see, e. g.,
United States Postal Service v. Council of Greenburgh Civic
Assns., 453 U. S. 114, 126-131 (1981); id., at 136-140 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 147-151 (Marshall,
J., dissenting); id., at 152-154 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (all
debating the definition of "public forum"), illustrate this all
too well. The quest for doctrinal certainty through the
definition of categories and subcategories is, in my opinion,
destined to fail.

Moreover, the categorical approach does not take seriously
the importance of context. The meaning of any expression
and the legitimacy of its regulation can only be determined

427Cite as: 505 U. S. 377 (1992)

in context.5 Whether, for example, a picture or a sentenceis obscene cannot be judged in the abstract, but rather only

in the context of its setting, its use, and its audience. Simi-larly, although legislatures may freely regulate most nonobscene child pornography, such pornography that is part of "aserious work of art, a documentary on behavioral problems,
or a medical or psychiatric teaching device" may be entitledto constitutional protection; the "question whether a specific
act of communication is protected by the First Amendmentalways requires some consideration of both its content and
its context." Ferber, 458 U. S., at 778 (Stevens, J., con-curring in judgment); see also

Smith v. United States, 431U. S. 291, 311-321 (1977) (
Stevens, J., dissenting). Thecategorical approach sweeps too broadly when it declares

that all such expression is beyond the protection of theFirst Amendment.

Perhaps sensing the limits of such an all-or-nothing ap-proach, the Court has applied its analysis less categorically
than its doctrinal statements suggest. The Court has recog-nized intermediate categories of speech (for example, for indecent nonobscene speech and commercial speech) and geo-graphic categories of speech (public fora, limited public fora,
nonpublic fora) entitled to varying levels of protection. TheCourt has also stringently delimited the categories of unprotected speech. While we once declared that "[l]ibelous ut-terances [are] not . . . within the area of constitutionally protected speech," Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343 U. S. 250, 266(1952), our rulings in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376
U. S. 254 (1964); Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323(1974), and Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders,
Inc., 472 U. S. 749 (1985), have substantially qualified this

5 "A word," as Justice Holmes has noted, "is not a crystal, transparent
and unchanged, it is the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in
color and content according to the circumstances and the time in which it
is used." Towne v. Eisner, 245 U. S. 418, 425 (1918); see also Jacobellis v.
Ohio, 378 U. S. 184, 201 (1964) (Warren, C. J., dissenting).

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
broad claim. Similarly, we have consistently construed the
"fighting words" exception set forth in Chaplinsky narrowly.
See, e. g., Houston v. Hill, 482 U. S. 451 (1987); Lewis v. New
Orleans, 415 U. S. 130 (1974); Cohen v. California, 403 U. S.
15 (1971). In the case of commercial speech, our ruling that
"the Constitution imposes no . . . restraint on government
[regulation] as respects purely commercial advertising," Valentine v. Chrestensen, 316 U. S. 52, 54 (1942), was expressly
repudiated in Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748 (1976). In short,
the history of the categorical approach is largely the history
of narrowing the categories of unprotected speech.

This evolution, I believe, indicates that the categorical approach is unworkable and the quest for absolute categories of
"protected" and "unprotected" speech ultimately futile. My
analysis of the faults and limits of this approach persuades
me that the categorical approach presented in Part I-A of
Justice White's opinion is not an adequate response to the
novel "underbreadth" analysis the Court sets forth today.

III
As the foregoing suggests, I disagree with both the
Court's and part of Justice White's analysis of the constitutionality of the St. Paul ordinance. Unlike the Court, I do
not believe that all content-based regulations are equally infirm and presumptively invalid; unlike Justice White, I do
not believe that fighting words are wholly unprotected by
the First Amendment. To the contrary, I believe our decisions establish a more complex and subtle analysis, one that
considers the content and context of the regulated speech,
and the nature and scope of the restriction on speech. Applying this analysis and assuming, arguendo, (as the Court does)
that the St. Paul ordinance is not overbroad, I conclude that
such a selective, subject-matter regulation on proscribable
speech is constitutional.

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
Not all content-based regulations are alike; our decisionsclearly recognize that some content-based restrictions raise

more constitutional questions than others. Although theCourt's analysis of content-based regulations cannot be reduced to a simple formula, we have considered a number of
factors in determining the validity of such regulations.First, as suggested above, the scope of protection provided

expressive activity depends in part upon its content andcharacter. We have long recognized that when government
regulates political speech or "the expression of editorialopinion on matters of public importance,"

FCC v. League of
Women Voters of Cal., 468 U. S. 364, 375-376 (1984), "First
Amendment protectio[n] is `at its zenith,' " Meyer v. Grant,
486 U. S. 414, 425 (1988). In comparison, we have recognized that "commercial speech receives a limited form of
First Amendment protection," Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, 478 U. S. 328, 340
(1986), and that "society's interest in protecting [sexually explicit films] is of a wholly different, and lesser, magnitude
than [its] interest in untrammeled political debate," Young v.
American Mini Theatres, 427 U. S., at 70; see also FCC v.
Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726 (1978). The character of
expressive activity also weighs in our consideration of its
constitutional status. As we have frequently noted, "[t]he
government generally has a freer hand in restricting expressive conduct than it has in restricting the written or spoken
word." Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 406 (1989); see also
United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367 (1968).

The protection afforded expression turns as well on the
context of the regulated speech. We have noted, for example, that "[a]ny assessment of the precise scope of employer
expression, of course, must be made in the context of its
labor relations setting . . . [and] must take into account the
economic dependence of the employees on their employers."
NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U. S., at 617. Similarly,
the distinctive character of a university environment, see

430 R. A. V. v. ST. PAUL

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263, 277-280 (1981) (Stevens,
J., concurring in judgment), or a secondary school environ-ment, see

Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U. S.260 (1988), influences our First Amendment analysis. The

same is true of the presence of a " `captive audience[, one]there as a matter of necessity, not of choice.' "

Lehman v.Shaker Heights, 418 U. S., at 302 (citation omitted).

6 Perhaps the most familiar embodiment of the relevance of con-text is our "fora" jurisprudence, differentiating the levels of

protection afforded speech in different locations.The nature of a contested restriction of speech also informs our evaluation of its constitutionality. Thus, for ex-ample, "[a]ny system of prior restraints of expression comes
to this Court bearing a heavy presumption against itsconstitutional validity."

Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan,372 U. S. 58, 70 (1963). More particularly to the matter of

content-based regulations, we have implicitly distinguishedbetween restrictions on expression based on subject matter
and restrictions based on viewpoint, indicating that the lat-ter are particularly pernicious. "If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the Govern-ment may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply
because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagree-able."

Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S., at 414. "Viewpointdiscrimination is censorship in its purest form," Perry Ed.

Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 62 (1983)(Brennan, J., dissenting), and requires particular scrutiny, in
part because such regulation often indicates a legislative ef-fort to skew public debate on an issue, see,

e. g., Schacht v.United States, 398 U. S. 58, 63 (1970). "Especially where . . .

the legislature's suppression of speech suggests an attempt

6 Cf. In re Chase, 468 F. 2d 128, 139-140 (CA7 1972) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (arguing that defendant who, for reasons of religious belief, refused

to contempt proceedings because he was not present in the courtroom "as
a matter of choice").

to give one side of a debatable public question an advantage
in expressing its views to the people, the First Amendment
is plainly offended." First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,
435 U. S. 765, 785-786 (1978). Thus, although a regulation
that on its face regulates speech by subject matter may in
some instances effectively suppress particular viewpoints,
see, e. g., Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv.
Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 530, 546-547 (1980) (Stevens, J.,
concurring in judgment), in general, viewpoint-based restrictions on expression require greater scrutiny than subjectmatter-based restrictions.7

Finally, in considering the validity of content-based regulations we have also looked more broadly at the scope of
the restrictions. For example, in Young v. American Mini
Theatres, 427 U. S., at 71, we found significant the fact that
"what [was] ultimately at stake [was] nothing more than a
limitation on the place where adult films may be exhibited."
Similarly, in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, the Court emphasized two dimensions of the limited scope of the FCC ruling.
First, the ruling concerned only broadcast material which
presents particular problems because it "confronts the citizen . . . in the privacy of the home"; second, the ruling was
not a complete ban on the use of selected offensive words,
but rather merely a limitation on the times such speech could
be broadcast. 438 U. S., at 748-750.

All of these factors play some role in our evaluation of
content-based regulations on expression. Such a multifaceted analysis cannot be conflated into two dimensions.
Whatever the allure of absolute doctrines, it is just too simple to declare expression "protected" or "unprotected" or to
proclaim a regulation "content based" or "content neutral."

7 Although the Court has sometimes suggested that subject-matterbased and viewpoint-based regulations are equally problematic, see, e. g.,
Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447
U. S., at 537, our decisions belie such claims.

432 R. A. V. v. ST. PAUL

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
In applying this analysis to the St. Paul ordinance, I as-sume, arguendo--as the Court does--that the ordinance regulates only fighting words and therefore is not overbroad.Looking to the content and character of the regulated activity, two things are clear. First, by hypothesis the ordinancebars only low-value speech, namely, fighting words. By
definition such expression constitutes "no essential part ofany exposition of ideas, and [is] of such slight social value as
a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from[it] is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and
morality." Chaplinsky, 315 U. S., at 572. Second, the ordi-nance regulates "expressive conduct [rather] than . . . the
written or spoken word." Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S., at406.

Looking to the context of the regulated activity, it is againsignificant that the ordinance (by hypothesis) regulates only
fighting words. Whether words are fighting words is deter-mined in part by their context. Fighting words are not
words that merely cause offense; fighting words must be di-rected at individuals so as to "by their very utterance inflict
injury." By hypothesis, then, the St. Paul ordinance re-stricts speech in confrontational and potentially violent situations. The case at hand is illustrative. The cross burningin this case--directed as it was to a single African-American
family trapped in their home--was nothing more than acrude form of physical intimidation. That this cross burning
sends a message of racial hostility does not automaticallyendow it with complete constitutional protection.

8

8 The Court makes much of St. Paul's description of the ordinance as
regulating "a message." Ante, at 393. As always, however, St. Paul's
argument must be read in context:

"Finally, we ask the Court to reflect on the `content' of the `expressive
conduct' represented by a `burning cross.' It is no less than the first step
in an act of racial violence. It was and unfortunately still is the equivalent of [the] waving of a knife before the thrust, the pointing of a gun
before it is fired, the lighting of the match before the arson, the hanging
of the noose before the lynching. It is not a political statement, or even

433Cite as: 505 U. S. 377 (1992)
Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
Significantly, the St. Paul ordinance regulates speech not
on the basis of its subject matter or the viewpoint expressed,
but rather on the basis of the harm the speech causes. In
this regard, the Court fundamentally misreads the St. Paul
ordinance. The Court describes the St. Paul ordinance as
regulating expression "addressed to one of [several] specified
disfavored topics," ante, at 391 (emphasis supplied), as policing "disfavored subjects," ibid. (emphasis supplied), and as
"prohibit[ing] . . . speech solely on the basis of the subjects
the speech addresses," ante, at 381 (emphasis supplied).
Contrary to the Court's suggestion, the ordinance regulates
only a subcategory of expression that causes injuries based
on "race, color, creed, religion or gender," not a subcategory
that involves discussions that concern those characteristics.9
The ordinance, as construed by the Court, criminalizes expression that "one knows . . . [by its very utterance inflicts
injury on] others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or

a cowardly statement of hatred. It is the first step in an act of assault.
It can be no more protected than holding a gun to a victim['s] head. It is
perhaps the ultimate expression of `fighting words.' " App. to Brief for
Petitioner C-6.

9 The Court contends that this distinction is "wordplay," reasoning that

"[w]hat makes [the harms caused by race-based threats] distinct from [the
harms] produced by other fighting words is . . . the fact that [the former
are] caused by a distinctive idea." Ante, at 392-393 (emphasis added).
In this way, the Court concludes that regulating speech based on the injury it causes is no different from regulating speech based on its subject
matter. This analysis fundamentally miscomprehends the role of "race,
color, creed, religion [and] gender" in contemporary American society.
One need look no further than the recent social unrest in the Nation's
cities to see that race-based threats may cause more harm to society and
to individuals than other threats. Just as the statute prohibiting threats
against the President is justifiable because of the place of the President in
our social and political order, so a statute prohibiting race-based threats
is justifiable because of the place of race in our social and political order.
Although it is regrettable that race occupies such a place and is so incendiary an issue, until the Nation matures beyond that condition, laws such as
St. Paul's ordinance will remain reasonable and justifiable.

gender." In this regard, the ordinance resembles the child
pornography law at issue in Ferber, which in effect singled
out child pornography because those publications caused far
greater harms than pornography involving adults.

Moreover, even if the St. Paul ordinance did regulate
fighting words based on its subject matter, such a regulation
would, in my opinion, be constitutional. As noted above,
subject-matter-based regulations on commercial speech are
widespread and largely unproblematic. As we have long
recognized, subject-matter regulations generally do not raise
the same concerns of government censorship and the distortion of public discourse presented by viewpoint regulations.
Thus, in upholding subject-matter regulations we have carefully noted that viewpoint-based discrimination was not implicated. See Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U. S.,
at 67 (emphasizing "the need for absolute neutrality by the
government," and observing that the contested statute was
not animated by "hostility for the point of view" of the theaters); FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S., at 745-746
(stressing that "government must remain neutral in the marketplace of ideas"); see also FCC v. League of Women's Voters of Cal., 468 U. S., at 412-417 (Stevens, J., dissenting);
Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U. S. 490, 554-555 (1981)
(Stevens, J., dissenting in part). Indeed, some subjectmatter restrictions are a functional necessity in contemporary governance: "The First Amendment does not require
States to regulate for problems that do not exist." Burson
v. Freeman, 504 U. S., at 207.

Contrary to the suggestion of the majority, the St. Paul
ordinance does not regulate expression based on viewpoint.
The Court contends that the ordinance requires proponents
of racial intolerance to "follow the Marquis of Queensberry
rules" while allowing advocates of racial tolerance to "fight
freestyle." The law does no such thing.

The Court writes:

"One could hold up a sign saying, for example, that all`anti-Catholic bigots' are misbegotten; but not that all

`papists' are, for that would insult and provoke violence`on the basis of religion.' "

Ante, at 391-392.

This may be true, but it hardly proves the Court's point.The Court's reasoning is asymmetrical. The response to a

sign saying that "all [religious] bigots are misbegotten" isa sign saying that "all advocates of religious tolerance are
misbegotten." Assuming such signs could be fighting words(which seems to me extremely unlikely), neither sign would
be banned by the ordinance for the attacks were not "basedon . . . religion" but rather on one's beliefs about tolerance.
Conversely (and again assuming such signs are fightingwords), just as the ordinance would prohibit a Muslim from
hoisting a sign claiming that all Catholics were misbegotten,so the ordinance would bar a Catholic from hoisting a similar
sign attacking Muslims.The St. Paul ordinance is evenhanded. In a battle between advocates of tolerance and advocates of intolerance,
the ordinance does not prevent either side from hurlingfighting words at the other on the basis of their conflicting

ideas, but it does bar both sides from hurling such words onthe basis of the target's "race, color, creed, religion or
gender." To extend the Court's pugilistic metaphor, theSt. Paul ordinance simply bans punches "below the belt"--
by either party. It does not, therefore, favor one side ofany debate.

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
Finally, it is noteworthy that the St. Paul ordinance is, asconstrued by the Court today, quite narrow. The St. Paul

ordinance does not ban all "hate speech," nor does it ban,say, all cross burnings or all swastika displays. Rather it
only bans a subcategory of the already narrow category offighting words. Such a limited ordinance leaves open and
protected a vast range of expression on the subjects of racial,religious, and gender equality. As construed by the Court
today, the ordinance certainly does not " `rais[e] the specterthat the Government may effectively drive certain ideas or
viewpoints from the marketplace.' " Ante, at 387. Peti-tioner is free to burn a cross to announce a rally or to express
his views about racial supremacy, he may do so on privateproperty or public land, at day or at night, so long as the
burning is not so threatening and so directed at an individualas to "by its very [execution] inflict injury." Such a limited
proscription scarcely offends the First Amendment.In sum, the St. Paul ordinance (as construed by the Court)
regulates expressive activity that is wholly proscribable anddoes so not on the basis of viewpoint, but rather in recognition of the different harms caused by such activity. Takentogether, these several considerations persuade me that the
St. Paul ordinance is not an unconstitutional content-basedregulation of speech. Thus, were the ordinance not overbroad, I would vote to uphold it.

437OCTOBER TERM, 1991
Syllabus

MEDINA v. CALIFORNIA
certiorari to the supreme court of california
No. 90-8370. Argued February 25, 1992--Decided June 22, 1992
Before petitioner Medina's trial for, inter alia, first-degree murder, the

California court granted his motion for a competency hearing pursuant
to a state law that forbids a mentally incompetent person to be tried
or punished, establishes a presumption of competence, and placed on
petitioner the burden of proving incompetence by a preponderance of
the evidence. The jury empaneled for the competency hearing found
Medina competent to stand trial and, subsequently, he was convicted
and sentenced to death. The State Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting
Medina's claim that the competency statute's burden of proof and presumption provisions violated his right to due process.

Held:

1. The Due Process Clause permits a State to require that a defendant claiming incompetence to stand trial bear the burden of proving so
by a preponderance of the evidence. Pp. 442-453.

(a) Contrary to Medina's argument, the Mathews v. Eldridge, 424
U. S. 319, test for evaluating procedural due process claims does not
provide the appropriate framework for assessing the validity of state
procedural rules that are part of the criminal law process. It is not at
all clear that Mathews was essential to the results in United States v.
Raddatz, 447 U. S. 667, or Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68, the only
criminal law cases in which this Court has invoked Mathews in resolving
due process claims. Rather, the proper analytical approach is that set
forth in Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, in which this Court held
that the power of a State to regulate procedures for carrying out its
criminal laws, including the burdens of producing evidence and persuasion, is not subject to proscription under the Due Process Clause unless
" `it offends some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and
conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.' " Id., at 201-
202. Pp. 442-446.

(b) There is no historical basis for concluding that allocating the
burden of proof to a criminal defendant to prove incompetence violates
due process. While the rule that an incompetent criminal defendant
should not be required to stand trial has deep roots in this country's
common-law heritage, no settled tradition exists for the proper allocation of the burden of proof in a competency proceeding. Moreover, con505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT
438 MEDINA v. CALIFORNIA

Syllabus
temporary practice demonstrates that there remains no settled view on
where the burden should lie. Pp. 446-448.

(c) Nor does the State's allocation of the burden of proof to a defendant transgress any recognized principle of "fundamental fairness"
in operation. This Court's decision in Leland v. Oregon, 343 U. S. 790--
which upheld a State's right to place on a defendant the burden of proving the defense of insanity--does not compel the conclusion that the
procedural rule at issue is constitutional, because there are significant
differences between a claim of incompetence and a plea of not guilty by
reason of insanity. Nonetheless, once the State has met its due process
obligation of providing a defendant access to procedures for making a
competency evaluation, there is no basis for requiring it to assume the
burden of vindicating the defendant's constitutional right not to be tried
while legally incompetent by persuading the trier of fact that the defendant is competent to stand trial. Pp. 448-449.

(d) Allocating the burden to the defendant is not inconsistent with
this Court's holding in Pate v. Robinson, 383 U. S. 375, 384, that a defendant whose competence is in doubt cannot be deemed to have waived
his right to a competency hearing, because the question whether a defendant whose competence is in doubt can be deemed to have made a
knowing and intelligent waiver is quite different from the question presented here. Although psychiatry is an inexact science and reasonable
minds may differ as to the wisdom of placing the burden of proof on the
defendant in these circumstances, the State is not required to adopt one
procedure over another on the basis that it may produce results more
favorable to the accused. In addition, the fact that the burden of proof
has been allocated to the State on a variety of other issues implicating
a criminal defendant's constitutional rights does not mean that the burden must be placed on the State here. Lego v. Twomey, 404 U. S. 477,
489, distinguished. Pp. 449-452.

2. For the same reasons discussed herein with regard to the allocation
of the burden of proof, the presumption of competence does not violate
due process. There is no reason to disturb the State Supreme Court's
conclusion that, in essence, the challenged presumption is a restatement
of that burden. Pp. 452-453.

51 Cal. 3d 870, 799 P. 2d 1282, affirmed.

440 MEDINA v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court
began and was charged with a number of criminal offenses,including three counts of first-degree murder. Before trial,

petitioner's counsel moved for a competency hearing underCal. Penal Code Ann. $ 1368 (West 1982), on the ground that
he was unsure whether petitioner had the ability to partici-pate in the criminal proceedings against him. 1 Record 320.

Under California law, "[a] person cannot be tried or ad-judged to punishment while such person is mentally incompetent." Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 1367 (West 1982). A de-fendant is mentally incompetent "if, as a result of mental
disorder or developmental disability, the defendant is unableto understand the nature of the criminal proceedings or to
assist counsel in the conduct of a defense in a rational man-ner." Ibid. The statute establishes a presumption that the
defendant is competent, and the party claiming incompetencebears the burden of proving that the defendant is incompetent by a preponderance of the evidence. $ 1369(f) ("It shallbe presumed that the defendant is mentally competent unless it is proved by a preponderance of the evidence that thedefendant is mentally incompetent").

The trial court granted the motion for a hearing and thepreliminary issue of petitioner's competence to stand trial
was tried to a jury. Over the course of the 6-day hearing,in addition to lay testimony, the jury heard conflicting expert
testimony about petitioner's mental condition. The Su-preme Court of California gives this summary:

"Dr. Gold, a psychiatrist who knew defendant whilehe was in the Arizona prison system, testified that defendant was a paranoid schizophrenic and was incompe-tent to assist his attorney at trial. Dr. Echeandia, a
clinical psychologist at the Orange County jail, doubtedthe accuracy of the schizophrenia diagnosis, and could
not express an opinion on defendant's competence tostand trial. Dr. Sharma, a psychiatrist, likewise expressed doubts regarding the schizophrenia diagnosisand leaned toward a finding of competence. Dr. Pierce,

Opinion of the Court
a psychologist, believed defendant was schizophrenic,with impaired memory and hallucinations, but nevertheless was competent to stand trial. Dr. Sakurai, a jailpsychiatrist, opined that although defendant suffered
from depression, he was competent, and that he mayhave been malingering. Dr. Sheffield, who treated defendant for knife wounds he incurred in jail, could giveno opinion on the competency issue." 51 Cal. 3d 870,
880, 799 P. 2d 1282, 1288 (1990).
During the competency hearing, petitioner engaged in sev-eral verbal and physical outbursts. App. 62, 81-82; 3 Record 671, 699, 916. On one of these occasions, he overturnedthe counsel table. App. 81-82.

The trial court instructed the jury in accordance with$ 1369(f) that "the defendant is presumed to be mentally
competent and he has the burden of proving by a preponder-ance of the evidence that he is mentally incompetent as a
result of mental disorder or developmental disability." App.87. The jury found petitioner competent to stand trial.
Id., at 89. A new jury was empaneled for the criminal trial,4 Record 1020, and petitioner entered pleas of not guilty and
not guilty by reason of insanity, 51 Cal. 3d, at 899, 799 P. 2d,at 1300. At the conclusion of the guilt phase, petitioner was
found guilty of all three counts of first-degree murder and anumber of lesser offenses. Id., at 878-879, 799 P. 2d, at 1287.
He moved to withdraw his insanity plea, and the trial courtgranted the motion. Two days later, however, petitioner
moved to reinstate his insanity plea. Although his counselexpressed the view that reinstatement of the insanity plea
was "tactically unsound," the trial court granted petitioner'smotion.

Id., at 899, 799 P. 2d, at 1300-1301. A sanity hear-ing was held, and the jury found that petitioner was sane at

the time of the offenses. At the penalty phase, the juryfound that the murders were premeditated and deliberate
and returned a verdict of death. The trial court imposedthe death penalty for the murder convictions and sentenced

442 MEDINA v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court
petitioner to a prison term for the remaining offenses. Id.,at 878-880, 799 P. 2d, at 1287-1288.

On direct appeal to the California Supreme Court, peti-tioner did not challenge the standard of proof set forth in

$ 1369(f), but argued that the statute violated his right todue process by placing the burden of proof on him to establish that he was not competent to stand trial. In addition,he argued that $ 1369(f) violates due process by establishing
a presumption that a defendant is competent to stand trialunless proven otherwise. The court rejected both of these
contentions. Relying upon our decision in Leland v. Oregon,343 U. S. 790 (1952), which rejected a due process challenge
to an Oregon statute that required a criminal defendant toprove the defense of insanity beyond a reasonable doubt, the
court observed that "the states ordinarily have great lati-tude to decide the proper placement of proof burdens." 51
Cal. 3d, at 884, 799 P. 2d, at 1291. In its view, $ 1369(f ) "doesnot subject the defendant to hardship or oppression," because "one might reasonably expect that the defendant andhis counsel would have better access than the People to the
facts relevant to the court's competency inquiry." Id., at885, 799 P. 2d, at 1291. The court also rejected petitioner's
argument that it is "irrational" to retain a presumption ofcompetence after sufficient doubt has arisen as to a defendant's competence to warrant a hearing and "decline[d] to holdas a matter of due process that such a presumption must
be treated as a mere presumption affecting the burden ofproduction, which disappears merely because a preliminary,
often undefined and indefinite, `doubt' has arisen that justi-fies further inquiry into the matter." Id., at 885, 799 P. 2d,
at 1291-1292. We granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 924 (1991),and now affirm.

Petitioner argues that our decision in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319 (1976), provides the proper analyticalframework for determining whether California's allocation of

443Cite as: 505 U. S. 437 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
the burden of proof in competency hearings comports withdue process. We disagree. In

Mathews, we articulated a
three-factor test for evaluating procedural due processclaims which requires a court to consider

"[f]irst, the private interest that will be affected by theofficial action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, andthe probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government's inter-est, including the function involved and the fiscal and
administrative burdens that the additional or substitute
procedural requirement would entail." Id., at 335.

In our view, the Mathews balancing test does not providethe appropriate framework for assessing the validity of state

procedural rules which, like the one at bar, are part of the
criminal process. E. g., People v. Fields, 62 Cal. 2d 538, 542,399 P. 2d 369, 371 (competency hearing "must be regarded

as part of the proceedings in the criminal case") (internalquotation marks omitted), cert. denied, 382 U. S. 858 (1965).

In the field of criminal law, we "have defined the categoryof infractions that violate `fundamental fairness' very narrowly" based on the recognition that, "[b]eyond the specificguarantees enumerated in the Bill of Rights, the Due Process Clause has limited operation." Dowling v. United
States, 493 U. S. 342, 352 (1990); accord, United States v. Lovasco, 431 U. S. 783, 790 (1977). The Bill of Rights speaks
in explicit terms to many aspects of criminal procedure, andthe expansion of those constitutional guarantees under the

open-ended rubric of the Due Process Clause invites undue
interference with both considered legislative judgments and
the careful balance that the Constitution strikes between liberty and order. As we said in Spencer v. Texas, 385 U. S.
554, 564 (1967), "it has never been thought that [decisions
under the Due Process Clause] establish this Court as a rulemaking organ for the promulgation of state rules of criminal

procedure." Accord, Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 70(1991);

Marshall v. Lonberger, 459 U. S. 422, 438, n. 6 (1983).
Mathews itself involved a due process challenge to the ade-quacy of administrative procedures established for the purpose of terminating Social Security disability benefits, and
the Mathews balancing test was first conceived to addressdue process claims arising in the context of administrative

law. Although we have since characterized the Mathewsbalancing test as "a general approach for testing challenged
state procedures under a due process claim," Parham v.
J. R., 442 U. S. 584, 599 (1979), and applied it in a variety of contexts, e. g., Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U. S. 745
(1982) (standard of proof for termination of parental rights
over objection); Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418 (1979)
(standard of proof for involuntary civil commitment to mental hospital for indefinite period), we have invoked Mathews
in resolving due process claims in criminal law cases on only
two occasions.

In United States v. Raddatz, 447 U. S. 667 (1980), we cited
to the Mathews balancing test in rejecting a due process
challenge to a provision of the Federal Magistrates Act
which authorized magistrates to make findings and recommendations on motions to suppress evidence. In Ake v.
Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68 (1985), we relied upon Mathews in
holding that, when an indigent capital defendant has made a
preliminary showing that his sanity at the time of the offense
is likely to be a significant factor at trial, due process requires that the defendant be provided access to the assistance of a psychiatrist. Without disturbing the holdings of
Raddatz and Ake, it is not at all clear that Mathews was
essential to the results reached in those cases. In Raddatz,
supra, at 677-681, the Court adverted to the Mathews balancing test, but did not explicitly rely upon it in conducting
the due process analysis. Raddatz, supra, at 700 (Marshall,
J., dissenting) ("The Court recites th[e] test, but it does not
even attempt to apply it"). The holding in Ake can be un505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT

445Cite as: 505 U. S. 437 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
derstood as an expansion of earlier due process cases holdingthat an indigent criminal defendant is entitled to the minimum assistance necessary to assure him "a fair opportunityto present his defense" and "to participate meaningfully in
[the] judicial proceeding." Ake, supra, at 76.

The proper analytical approach, and the one that we adopthere, is that set forth in

Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S.
197 (1977), which was decided one year after Mathews. In
Patterson, we rejected a due process challenge to a New
York law which placed on a criminal defendant the burdenof proving the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance. Rather than relying upon the Mathews balancingtest, however, we reasoned that a narrower inquiry was
more appropriate:

"It goes without saying that preventing and dealing
with crime is much more the business of the States thanit is of the Federal Government,

Irvine v. California,
347 U. S. 128, 134 (1954) (plurality opinion), and that we
should not lightly construe the Constitution so as to in-trude upon the administration of justice by the individual States. Among other things, it is normally `withinthe power of the State to regulate procedures under
which its laws are carried out, including the burden ofproducing evidence and the burden of persuasion,' and
its decision in this regard is not subject to proscriptionunder the Due Process Clause unless `it offends some
principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.'
Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513, 523 (1958); Leland v.
Oregon, 343 U. S. 790, 798 (1952); Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97, 105 (1934)." Patterson v. New York,
supra, at 201-202.

Accord, Martin v. Ohio, 480 U. S. 228, 232 (1987). As Patterson suggests, because the States have considerable expertise
in matters of criminal procedure and the criminal process is

505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT
446 MEDINA v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court
grounded in centuries of common-law tradition, it is appro-priate to exercise substantial deference to legislative judgments in this area. The analytical approach endorsed in
Patterson is thus far less intrusive than that approved in
Mathews.

Based on our review of the historical treatment of the bur-den of proof in competency proceedings, the operation of the

challenged rule, and our precedents, we cannot say that theallocation of the burden of proof to a criminal defendant to
prove incompetence "offends some principle of justice sorooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be
ranked as fundamental." Patterson v. New York, supra, at
202 (internal quotation marks omitted). Historical practice
is probative of whether a procedural rule can be characterized as fundamental. See 432 U. S., at 202; In re Winship,
397 U. S. 358, 361 (1970). The rule that a criminal defendant
who is incompetent should not be required to stand trial has
deep roots in our common-law heritage. Blackstone acknowledged that a defendant "who became `mad' after the
commission of an offense should not be arraigned for it `because he is not able to plead to it with that advice and caution
that he ought,' " and "if he became `mad' after pleading, he
should not be tried, `for how can he make his defense?' "
Drope v. Missouri, 420 U. S., at 171 (quoting 4 W. Blackstone,
Commentaries *24); accord, 1 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown
*34-*35.

By contrast, there is no settled tradition on the proper
allocation of the burden of proof in a proceeding to determine
competence. Petitioner concedes that "[t]he common law
rule on this issue at the time the Constitution was adopted is
not entirely clear." Brief for Petitioner 36. Early English
authorities either express no view on the subject, e. g.,
Firth's Case (1790), 22 Howell St. Tr. 307, 311, 317-318 (1817);
Kinloch's Case (1746), 18 Howell St. Tr. 395, 411 (1813), or
are ambiguous. E. g., King v. Steel, 1 Leach 452, 168 Eng.
Rep. 328 (1787) (stating that, once a jury had determined

505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
that the defendant was "mute by the visitation of God" (i. e.,deaf and dumb) and not "mute of malice," there arose a "presumption of ideotism" that the prosecution could rebut bydemonstrating that the defendant had the capacity "to understand by signs and tokens").

Nineteenth century English decisions do not take a con-sistent position on the allocation of the burden of proof. Compare R. v. Turton, 6 Cox C. C. 385 (1854) (burden on defend-ant), with

R. v. Davies, 3 Carrington & Kirwan 328, 175 Eng.
Rep. 575 (1853) (burden on prosecution); see generally R. v.
Podola, 43 Crim. App. 220, 235-236, 3 All E. R. 418, 429-430
(1959) (collecting conflicting cases). American decisions dating from the turn of the century also express divergent
views on the subject. E. g., United States v. Chisolm, 149
F. 284, 290 (SD Ala. 1906) (defendant bears burden of raising
a reasonable doubt as to competence); State v. Helm, 69 Ark.
167, 170-171, 61 S. W. 915, 916 (1901) (burden on defendant
to prove incompetence).

Contemporary practice, while of limited relevance to the
due process inquiry, see Martin v. Ohio, supra, at 236; Patterson v. New York, supra, at 211, demonstrates that there
remains no settled view of where the burden of proof should
lie. The Federal Government and all 50 States have
adopted procedures that address the issue of a defendant's

J. Parry, & B. Weiner, The Mentally Disabled and the Law,
Table 12.1, pp. 744-754 (3d ed. 1985). Some States have enacted statutes that, like $ 1369(f), place the burden of proof
on the party raising the issue. E. g., Conn. Gen. Stat. $ 54-
56d(b) (1991); Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 50, $ 7403(a) (Purdon Supp.
1991). A number of state courts have said that the burden
of proof may be placed on the defendant to prove incompetence. E. g., Wallace v. State, 248 Ga. 255, 258-259, 282 S. E.
2d 325, 330 (1981), cert. denied, 455 U. S. 927 (1982); State v.

Still other state courts have said that the burden rests withthe prosecution.

E. g., Diaz v. State, 508 A. 2d 861, 863-864
(Del. 1986); Commonwealth v. Crowley, 393 Mass. 393, 400-

State v. Jones,
406 N. W. 2d 366, 369-370 (S. D. 1987).Discerning no historical basis for concluding that the allocation of the burden of proving incompetence to the defend-ant violates due process, we turn to consider whether the
rule transgresses any recognized principle of "fundamental
fairness" in operation. Dowling v. United States, 493 U. S.,
at 352. Respondent argues that our decision in Leland v.
Oregon, 343 U. S. 790 (1952), which upheld the right of the
State to place on a defendant the burden of proving the defense of insanity beyond a reasonable doubt, compels the conclusion that $ 1369(f ) is constitutional because, like a finding
of insanity, a finding of incompetence has no necessary relationship to the elements of a crime, on which the State bears
the burden of proof. See also Rivera v. Delaware, 429 U. S.
877 (1976). This analogy is not convincing, because there
are significant differences between a claim of incompetence
and a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. See Drope v.
Missouri, supra, at 176-177; Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U. S.
715, 739 (1972).

In a competency hearing, the "emphasis is on [the defendant's] capacity to consult with counsel and to comprehend the
proceedings, and . . . this is by no means the same test as
those which determine criminal responsibility at the time of
the crime." Pate v. Robinson, 383 U. S., at 388-389 (Harlan,
J., dissenting). If a defendant is incompetent, due process
considerations require suspension of the criminal trial until
such time, if any, that the defendant regains the capacity to
participate in his defense and understand the proceedings
against him. See Dusky v. United States, 362 U. S. 402

Opinion of the Court
(1960) (per curiam). The entry of a plea of not guilty byreason of insanity, by contrast, presupposes that the defendant is competent to stand trial and to enter a plea. More-over, while the Due Process Clause affords an incompetent
defendant the right not to be tried, Drope v. Missouri,
supra, at 172-173; Pate v. Robinson, supra, at 386, we havenot said that the Constitution requires the States to recognize the insanity defense. See, e. g., Powell v. Texas, 392U. S. 514, 536-537 (1968).

Under California law, the allocation of the burden of proofto the defendant will affect competency determinations only
in a narrow class of cases where the evidence is in equipoise;
that is, where the evidence that a defendant is competent is
just as strong as the evidence that he is incompetent. See
United States v. DiGilio, 538 F. 2d 972, 988 (CA3 1976), cert.
denied, 429 U. S. 1038 (1977). Our cases recognize that a
defendant has a constitutional right "not to be tried while
legally incompetent," and that a State's "failure to observe
procedures adequate to protect a defendant's right not to be
tried or convicted while incompetent to stand trial deprives
him of his due process right to a fair trial." Drope v. Missouri, 420 U. S., at 172, 173. Once a State provides a defendant access to procedures for making a competency evaluation, however, we perceive no basis for holding that due
process further requires the State to assume the burden of
vindicating the defendant's constitutional right by persuading the trier of fact that the defendant is competent to
stand trial.

Petitioner relies upon federal- and state-court decisions
which have said that the allocation of the burden of proof to
the defendant in these circumstances is inconsistent with the
rule of Pate v. Robinson, supra, at 384, where we held that
a defendant whose competence is in doubt cannot be deemed
to have waived his right to a competency hearing. E. g.,
United States v. DiGilio, supra, at 988; People v. McCullum,
66 Ill. 2d 306, 312-314, 362 N. E. 2d 307, 310-311 (1977); State

v. Bertrand, supra, at 727-728, 465 A. 2d, at 916. Because" `it is contradictory to argue that a defendant may be incompetent, and yet knowingly or intelligently "waive" his rightto have the court determine his capacity to stand trial,' " it
has been said that it is also "contradictory to argue that a
defendant who may be incompetent should be presumed topossess sufficient intelligence that he will be able to adduce

evidence of his incompetency which might otherwise bewithin his grasp."

United States v. DiGilio, supra, at 988
(quoting Pate v. Robinson, supra, at 384).In our view, the question whether a defendant whose competence is in doubt may waive his right to a competency
hearing is quite different from the question whether the burden of proof may be placed on the defendant once a hearing
is held. The rule announced in Pate was driven by our concern that it is impossible to say whether a defendant whose
competence is in doubt has made a knowing and intelligent
waiver of his right to a competency hearing. Once a competency hearing is held, however, the defendant is entitled to
the assistance of counsel, e. g., Estelle v. Smith, 451 U. S. 454,
469-471 (1981), and psychiatric evidence is brought to bear
on the question of the defendant's mental condition, see, e. g.,
Cal. Penal Code Ann. $$ 1369(a), 1370 (West 1982 and Supp.
1992); see generally Brakel, Parry, & Weiner, The Mentally
Disabled and the Law, at 697-698. Although an impaired
defendant might be limited in his ability to assist counsel
in demonstrating incompetence, the defendant's inability to
assist counsel can, in and of itself, constitute probative evidence of incompetence, and defense counsel will often have
the best-informed view of the defendant's ability to participate in his defense. E. g., United States v. David, 167 U. S.
App. D. C. 117, 122, 511 F. 2d 355, 360 (1975); United States
ex rel. Roth v. Zelker, 455 F. 2d 1105, 1108 (CA2), cert. denied, 408 U. S. 927 (1972). While reasonable minds may differ as to the wisdom of placing the burden of proof on the
defendant in these circumstances, we believe that a State

Opinion of the Court
may take such factors into account in making judgments asto the allocation of the burden of proof, and we see no basis

for concluding that placing the burden on the defendant vio-lates the principle approved in

Pate.
Petitioner argues that psychiatry is an inexact science, and
that placing the burden of proof on the defendant violatesdue process because it requires the defendant to "bear the

risk of being forced to stand trial as a result of an erroneousfinding of competency." Brief for Petitioner 8. Our cases
recognize that "[t]he subtleties and nuances of psychiatricdiagnosis render certainties virtually beyond reach in most
situations," because "[p]sychiatric diagnosis . . . is to a large
extent based on medical `impressions' drawn from subjective
analysis and filtered through the experience of the diagnostician." Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S., at 430. The Due
Process Clause does not, however, require a State to adopt
one procedure over another on the basis that it may produce
results more favorable to the accused. See, e. g., Patterson
v. New York, 432 U. S., at 208 ("Due process does not require
that every conceivable step be taken, at whatever cost, to
eliminate the possibility of convicting an innocent person");
Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97, 105 (1934) (a state
procedure "does not run foul of the Fourteenth Amendment
because another method may seem to our thinking to be
fairer or wiser or to give a surer promise of protection to
the prisoner at the bar"). Consistent with our precedents,
it is enough that the State affords the criminal defendant on
whose behalf a plea of incompetence is asserted a reasonable
opportunity to demonstrate that he is not competent to
stand trial.

Petitioner further contends that the burden of proof should
be placed on the State because we have allocated the burden
to the State on a variety of other issues that implicate a
criminal defendant's constitutional rights. E. g., Colorado v.
Connelly, 479 U. S. 157, 168-169 (1986) (waiver of Miranda
rights); Nix v. Williams, 467 U. S. 431, 444-445, n. 5 (1984)

(inevitable discovery of evidence obtained by unlawfulmeans);

United States v. Matlock, 415 U. S. 164, 177-178,
n. 14 (1974) (voluntariness of consent to search); Lego v. Twomey, 404 U. S. 477, 489 (1972) (voluntariness of confession).
The decisions upon which petitioner relies, however, do not
control the result here, because they involved situationswhere the government sought to introduce inculpatory evidence obtained by virtue of a waiver of, or in violation of,a defendant's constitutional rights. In such circumstances,
allocating the burden of proof to the government furthersthe objective of "deterring lawless conduct by police and
prosecution." Ibid. No such purpose is served by allocating the burden of proof to the government in a competency
hearing.

In light of our determination that the allocation of the burden of proof to the defendant does not offend due process,
it is not difficult to dispose of petitioner's challenge to the
presumption of competence imposed by $ 1369(f). Under
California law, a defendant is required to make a threshold
showing of incompetence before a hearing is required and,
at the hearing, the defendant may be prevented from making
decisions that are normally left to the discretion of a competent defendant. E. g., People v. Samuel, 29 Cal. 3d 489, 495-
496, 629 P. 2d 485, 486-487 (1981). Petitioner argues that,
once the trial court has expressed a doubt as to the defendant's competence, a hearing is held, and the defendant is deprived of his right to make determinations reserved to competent persons, it is irrational to retain the presumption that
the defendant is competent.

In rejecting this contention below, the California Supreme
Court observed that "[t]he primary significance of the presumption of competence is to place on defendant (or the People, if they contest his competence) the burden of rebutting
it" and that, "[b]y its terms, the presumption of competence
is one which affects the burden of proof." 51 Cal. 3d, at 885,
799 P. 2d, at 1291. We see no reason to disturb the Califor505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:36 PAGES OPINPGT

nia Supreme Court's conclusion that, in essence, the chal-lenged presumption is a restatement of the burden of proof,

and it follows from what we have said that the presumptiondoes not violate the Due Process Clause.

Nothing in today's decision is inconsistent with our long-standing recognition that the criminal trial of an incompetent defendant violates due process. Drope v. Missouri, 420U. S., at 172-173;

Pate v. Robinson, 383 U. S., at 386; see alsoRiggins v. Nevada, 504 U. S. 127, 139 (1992) (

Kennedy, J.,concurring in judgment). Rather, our rejection of petitioner's challenge to $ 1369(f) is based on a determination thatthe California procedure is "constitutionally adequate" to
guard against such results, Drope v. Missouri, supra, at 172,and reflects our considered view that "[t]raditionally, due
process has required that only the most basic proceduralsafeguards be observed; more subtle balancing of society's
interests against those of the accused ha[s] been left to thelegislative branch," Patterson v. New York, supra, at 210.

The judgment of the Supreme Court of California is

Affirmed.
Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Souter joins,concurring in the judgment.

I concur in the judgment of the Court, but I reject itsintimation that the balancing of equities is inappropriate in
evaluating whether state criminal procedures amount to dueprocess. Ante, at 443-446. We obviously applied the balancing test of Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319 (1976), inAke v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68 (1985), a case concerning criminal procedure, and I do not see that Ake can be distin-guished here without disavowing the analysis on which it
rests. The balancing of equities that Mathews v. Eldridgeoutlines remains a useful guide in due process cases.

In Mathews, however, we did not have to address the ques-tion of how much weight to give historical practice; in the
context of modern administrative procedures, there was no

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
historical practice to consider. The same is true of the newadministrative regime established by the federal criminal

sentencing guidelines, and I have agreed that Mathews maybe helpful in determining what process is due in that context.
See Burns v. United States, 501 U. S. 129, 147-148 (1991)
(Souter, J., dissenting). While I agree with the Court thathistorical pedigree can give a procedural practice a presumption of constitutionality, see Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S.197, 211 (1977), the presumption must surely be rebuttable.

The concept of due process is, "perhaps, the least frozenconcept of our law--the least confined to history and the
most absorptive of powerful social standards of a progressive
society. But neither the unfolding content of `due process'
nor the particularized safeguards of the Bill of Rights disregard procedural ways that reflect a national historic policy."
Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U. S. 12, 20-21 (1956) (Frankfurter, J.,
concurring in judgment). Against the historical status quo,
I read the Court's opinion to allow some weight to be given
countervailing considerations of fairness in operation, considerations much like those we evaluated in Mathews. See
ante, at 448-453. Any less charitable reading of the Court's
opinion would put it at odds with many of our criminal due
process cases, in which we have required States to institute
procedures that were neither required at common law nor
explicitly commanded by the text of the Constitution. See,
e. g., Griffin v. Illinois, supra (due process right to trial transcript on appeal); Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963)
(due process right to discovery of exculpatory evidence);
Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333 (1966) (due process right
to protection from prejudicial publicity and courtroom disruptions); Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U. S. 284 (1973) (due
process right to introduce certain evidence); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U. S. 778 (1973) (due process right to hearing and
counsel before probation revoked); Ake v. Oklahoma, supra
(due process right to psychiatric examination when sanity is
significantly in question).

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
In determining whether the placement of the burden ofproof is fundamentally unfair, relevant considerations include: whether the government has superior access to evi-dence; whether the defendant is capable of aiding in the
garnering and evaluation of evidence on the matter to be
proved; and whether placing the burden of proof on thegovernment is necessary to help enforce a further right,

such as the right to be presumed innocent, the right to befree from self-incrimination, or the right to be tried while
competent.After balancing the equities in this case, I agree with the
Court that the burden of proof may constitutionally rest on
the defendant. As the dissent points out, post, at 465, the
competency determination is based largely on the testimony
of psychiatrists. The main concern of the prosecution, of
course, is that a defendant will feign incompetence in order
to avoid trial. If the burden of proving competence rests
on the government, a defendant will have less incentive to
cooperate in psychiatric investigations, because an inconclusive examination will benefit the defense, not the prosecution. A defendant may also be less cooperative in making
available friends or family who might have information about
the defendant's mental state. States may therefore decide
that a more complete picture of a defendant's competence
will be obtained if the defense has the incentive to produce
all the evidence in its possession. The potentially greater
overall access to information provided by placing the burden
of proof on the defense may outweigh the danger that, in
close cases, a marginally incompetent defendant is brought
to trial. Unlike the requirement of a hearing or a psychiatric examination, placing the burden of proof on the government will not necessarily increase the reliability of the proceedings. The equities here, then, do not weigh so much in
petitioner's favor as to rebut the presumption of constitutionality that the historical toleration of procedural variation creates.

Blackmun, J., dissenting
As the Court points out, ante, at 451-452, the other cases
in which we have placed the burden of proof on the government are distinguishable. See Colorado v. Connelly, 479
U. S. 157, 168-169 (1986) (burden of proof on government to
show waiver of rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S.
436 (1966)); Nix v. Williams, 467 U. S. 431, 444-445, n. 5
(1984) (burden on government to show inevitable discovery
of evidence obtained by unlawful means); United States v.
Matlock, 415 U. S. 164, 177-178, n. 14 (1974) (burden on government to show voluntariness of consent to search); Lego v.
Twomey, 404 U. S. 477, 489 (1972) (burden on government to
show voluntariness of confession). In each of these cases,
the government's burden of proof accords with its investigatory responsibilities. Before obtaining a confession, the
government is required to ensure that the confession is given
voluntarily. Before searching a private area without a warrant, the government is generally required to ensure that
the owner consents to the search. The government has no
parallel responsibility to gather evidence of a defendant's
competence.

Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice Stevens joins,
dissenting.

Teofilo Medina, Jr., may have been mentally incompetent
when the State of California convicted him and sentenced
him to death. One psychiatrist testified he was incompetent. Another psychiatrist and a psychologist testified he
was not. Several other experts testified but did not express
an opinion on competence. Instructed to presume that petitioner Medina was competent, the jury returned a finding of
competence. For all we know, the jury was entirely undecided. I do not believe a Constitution that forbids the trial
and conviction of an incompetent person tolerates the trial
and conviction of a person about whom the evidence of competency is so equivocal and unclear. I dissent.

The right of a criminal defendant to be tried only if competent is "fundamental to an adversary system of justice,"
Drope v. Missouri, 420 U. S. 162, 172 (1975). The Due Process Clause forbids the trial and conviction of persons incapa-ble of defending themselves--persons lacking the capacity to

understand the nature and object of the proceedings againstthem, to consult with counsel, and to assist in preparing their
defense. Id., at 171.1 See also Pate v. Robinson, 383 U. S.375, 378 (1966).

The right to be tried while competent is the foundational
right for the effective exercise of a defendant's other rights
in a criminal trial. "Competence to stand trial is rudimentary, for upon it depends the main part of those rights
deemed essential to a fair trial, including the right to effective assistance of counsel, the rights to summon, to confront,
and to cross-examine witnesses, and the right to testify on
one's own behalf or to remain silent without penalty for
doing so." Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U. S. 127, 139 (1992)
(Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment). In the words of
Professor Morris, one of the world's leading criminologists,
incompetent persons "are not really present at trial; they
may not be able properly to play the role of an accused person, to recall relevant events, to produce evidence and witnesses, to testify effectively on their own behalf, to help confront hostile witnesses, and to project to the trier of facts a

oriented to time and place and has some recollection of events, but that
the test must be whether he has sufficient present ability to consult with
his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding--and
whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him," Dusky v. United States, 362 U. S. 402 (1960) (internal
quotation marks and bracketing omitted); cf. Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U. S.

sense of their innocence." N. Morris, Madness and the
Criminal Law 37 (1982).

This Court's cases are clear that the right to be tried while
competent is so critical a prerequisite to the criminal process
that "state procedures must be adequate to protect this
right." Pate, 383 U. S., at 378 (emphasis added). "[T]he
failure to observe procedures adequate to protect a defendant's right not to be tried or convicted while incompetent to
stand trial deprives him of his due process right to a fair
trial." Drope, 420 U. S., at 172. In other words, the Due
Process Clause does not simply forbid the State to try to
convict a person who is incompetent. It also demands adequate anticipatory, protective procedures to minimize the
risk that an incompetent person will be convicted. Justice
Frankfurter recognized this in a related context: "If the
deeply rooted principle in our society against killing an insane man is to be respected, at least the minimum provision
for assuring a fair application of that principle is inherent in
the principle itself." Solesbee v. Balkcom, 339 U. S. 9, 23
(1950) (dissenting opinion). Anticipatory protective procedures are necessary as well because "we have previously emphasized the difficulty of retrospectively determining an accused's competence to stand trial." Pate, 383 U. S., at 387.
See also Drope, 420 U. S., at 183; Dusky v. United States,
362 U. S. 402, 403 (1960). See generally Miller & Germain,
The Retrospective Evaluation of Competency to Stand Trial,
11 Int'l J. Law and Psych. 113 (1988).

This Court expressly has recognized that one of the required procedural protections is "further inquiry" or a hearing when there is a sufficient doubt raised about a defendant's competency. Drope, 420 U. S., at 180; Pate, 383 U. S.,
at 385-386. In my view, then, the only question before the
Court in this case is whether--as with the right to a hearing--placing the burden of proving competence on the State
is necessary to protect adequately the underlying due proc505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:36 PAGES OPINPGT

ess right. I part company with the Court today, because Ibelieve the answer to that question is in the affirmative.

II
As an initial matter, I believe the Court's approach to thiscase effectively asks and answers the wrong doctrinal question. Following the lead of the parties, the Court mistak-enly frames its inquiry in terms of whether to apply a standard it takes to be derived from language in Patterson v. New
York, 432 U. S. 197 (1977), or a standard based on the func-tional balancing approach of Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S.

319 (1976). Ante, at 442-446. The Court is not put to sucha choice. Under D rope and Pa te, it need decide only
whether a procedure imposing the burden of proof upon thedefendant is "adequate" to protect the constitutional prohibition against trial of incompetent persons.The Court, however, chooses the

Patterson path, announc-ing that there is no violation of due process unless placing

the burden of proof of incompetency upon the defendant" ` "offends some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as funda-mental." ' " Ante, at 445 (quoting Patterson, 432 U. S., at
202). Separating the primary right (the right not to be triedwhile incompetent) from the subsidiary right (the right not
to bear the burden of proof of incompetency), the Court ac-knowledges the primary right to be fundamental in "our
common-law heritage," but determines the subsidiary rightto be without a "settled tradition" deserving of constitutional
protection. Ante, at 446. This approach is mistaken, be-cause it severs two integrally related procedural rights that
cannot be examined meaningfully in isolation. The protec-tions of the Due Process Clause, to borrow the second Justice
Harlan's words, are simply not "a series of isolated pointspricked" out in terms of their most specific level of historic
generality. Poe v. Ullman, 367 U. S. 497, 543 (1961) (dissent-ing opinion). Had the Court taken the same historical505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:36 PAGES OPINPGT

categorical approach in Pate and Drope, it would not haverecognized that a defendant has a right to a competency

hearing, for in neither of those cases was there any showingthat the mere denial of a hearing where there is doubt about
competency offended any deeply rooted traditions of the
American people.In all events, I do not interpret the Court's reliance on

Patterson to undermine the basic balancing of the gov-ernment's interests against the individual's interest that is
germane to any due process inquiry. While unwilling todiscount the force of tradition and history, the Court
in Patterson did not adopt an exclusively tradition-basedapproach to due process analysis. Relying on

Morrison v.
California, 291 U. S. 82 (1934), the Court in Patterson looked
to the "convenience" to the government and "hardship oroppression" to the defendant in forming its allocation of the

burden of proof. 432 U. S., at 203, n. 9, and 210.

" `The decisions are manifold that within limits of reason
and fairness the burden of proof may be lifted from thestate in criminal prosecutions and cast on a defendant.

The limits are in substance these, that the state shallhave proved enough to make it just for the defendant to
be required to repel what has been proved with excuseor explanation,

or at least that upon a balancing of
convenience or of the opportunities for knowledge the
shifting of the burden will be found to be an aid to

the accuser without subjecting the accused to hardship or oppression. Cf. Wigmore, Evidence, Vol. 5,$$ 2486, 2512, and cases cited.' "

tutionality of a California criminal statute forbidding aliensnot eligible for naturalization to farm. The statute provided

that, once the State proved the defendant used or occupiedfarmland, the burden of proving citizenship or eligibility for
naturalization rested upon the defendant. See 291 U. S.,
at 84. At the time, persons of Asian ancestry were gener-ally not eligible for naturalization. See

id., at 85-86. The
Court observed that in the "vast majority of cases," therewould be no unfairness to the distribution of the burden, because a defendant's Asian ancestry could plainly be observed.
Id., at 94. But, where the evidence is in equipoise--as when
the defendant is of mixed blood and his outward appearance
does not readily reveal his Asian ancestry--"the promotion
of convenience from the point of view of the prosecution will
be outweighed by the probability of injustice to the accused."
Ibid. Thus, the Court concluded: "There can be no escape
from hardship and injustice, outweighing many times any
procedural convenience, unless the burden of persuasion in
respect of racial origin is cast upon the People." Id., at 96.

Consistent with Morrison, I read the Court's opinion
today to acknowledge that Patterson does not relieve the
Court from evaluating the underlying fairness of imposing
the burden of proof of incompetency upon the defendant.
That is why the Court not only looks to "the historical treatment of the burden of proof in competency proceedings" but
also looks to "the operation of the challenged rule, and our
precedents." Ante, at 446. That is why the Court eventually turns to determining "whether the rule [placing upon
the defendant the burden of proof of incompetency] transgresses any recognized principle of `fundamental fairness' in
operation." Ante, at 448.

Carrying out this inquiry, the Court points out that the
defendant is already entitled to the assistance of counsel and
to a psychiatric evaluation. Ante, at 450. It suggests as
well that defense counsel will have "the best-informed view"
of the defendant's ability to assist in his defense. Ibid. Ac505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:36 PAGES OPINPGT

cordingly, the Court concludes: "[I]t is enough that the State
affords the criminal defendant on whose behalf a plea of incompetence is asserted a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate that he is not competent to stand trial." Ante, at 451.
While I am unable to agree with the Court's conclusion, it is
clear that the Court ends up engaging in a balancing inquiry
not meaningfully distinguishable from that of the Mathews
v. Eldridge test it earlier appears to forswear.2

I am perplexed that the Court, while recognizing "the
careful balance that the Constitution strikes between liberty and order," ante, at 443 (emphasis added), intimates that
the apparent "expertise" of the States in criminal procedure

2 Recently, several Members of this Court have expressly declined to
limit Mathews v. Eldridge balancing to the civil administrative context
and determined that Mathews provides the appropriate framework for
assessing the validity of criminal rules of procedure. See Burns v. United
States, 501 U. S. 129, 148-156 (1991) (Souter, J., joined in relevant part
by White and O'Connor, JJ., dissenting) (applying Mathews to federal
criminal sentencing procedures, stating that Mathews does not apply only
to civil "administrative" determinations but "[t]he Mathews analysis has
thus been used as a general approach for determining the procedures required by due process whenever erroneous governmental action would
infringe an individual's protected interest"). The Court also acknowledges that it has previously relied on Mathews v. Eldridge in at least two
cases concerning criminal procedure. Ante, at 444 (citing Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68 (1985) (due process requires appointment of psychiatrist where defendant's sanity at the time of the offense is to be significant
factor at trial), and United States v. Raddatz, 447 U. S. 667 (1980) (due
process does not require federal district judges to make de novo determination with live testimony of issues presented in motion to suppress)).

The Court claims that "it is not at all clear" that Mathews was "essential
to the results reached in" Ake and Raddatz. Ante, at 444. I am not sure
what the Court means, because both cases unquestionably set forth the
full Mathews test and evaluated the interests. See Ake, 470 U. S., at
77-83; Raddatz, 447 U. S., at 677-679. What the Court should find clear,
if anything, from these two cases is that the specific rights asserted there
were historically novel and could hardly be said to have constituted "principle[s] of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people
as to be ranked as fundamental."

and the "centuries of common-law tradition" of the "criminalprocess" warrant less than careful balancing in favor of "substantial deference to legislative judgments," ante, at 445-446. Because the Due Process Clause is not the Some Process Clause, I remain convinced that it requires carefulbalancing of the individual and governmental interests at
stake to determine what process is due.

III
I believe that requiring a possibly incompetent person tocarry the burden of proving that he is incompetent cannot

be called "adequate," within the meaning of the decisions inPate and Drope, to protect a defendant's right to be tried
only while competent. In a variety of other contexts, theCourt has allocated the burden of proof to the prosecution
as part of the protective procedures designed to ensure theintegrity of specific underlying rights. In

Lego v. Twomey,404 U. S. 477 (1972), for example, the Court determined that

when the prosecution seeks to use at trial a confession chal-lenged as involuntary, "the prosecution must prove at least
by a preponderance of the evidence that the confession wasvoluntary," because the defendant is "entitled to a reliable
and clear-cut determination that the confession was in factvoluntarily rendered."

Id., at 489. See also Colorado v.Connelly, 479 U. S. 157, 167-169 (1986) (burden on prosecution to show defendant waived Miranda rights); Nix v. Wil-liams, 467 U. S. 431, 444, and n. 5 (1984) (burden on prosecution to show inevitable discovery of evidence obtained byunlawful means); United States v. Matlock, 415 U. S. 164,
177-178, n. 14 (1974) (burden on prosecution to show volun-tariness of consent to search). Equally weighty concerns
warrant imposing the burden of proof upon the State here.The Court suggests these cases are distinguishable because they shift the burden of proof in order to deter lawlessconduct by law enforcement and prosecutorial authorities,
while in this case deterrence is irrelevant. Ante, at 451-453.

464 MEDINA v. CALIFORNIA

Blackmun, J., dissenting
If anything, this distinction cuts against the Court's point ofview. Deterrence of official misconduct during the investigatory stage of the criminal process has less to do with thefairness of the trial and an accurate determination of the
defendant's guilt than does the defendant's ability to understand and participate in the trial itself. Accordingly, thereis greater reason here to impose a trial-related cost upon the

government--in the form of the burden of proof--to ensurethe fairness and accuracy of the trial. Cf.

United States v.
Alvarez-Machain, 504 U. S. 655, 660 (1992) (official miscon-duct in the form of forcible kidnaping of defendant for trial

does not violate defendant's due process rights at trial).
Moreover, given the Court's consideration of nontrial-related
interests, I wonder whether the Court owes any consideration to the public interest in the appearance of fairness in
the criminal justice system. The trial of persons about
whose competence the evidence is inconclusive unquestionably "undermine[s] the very foundation of our system of
justice--our citizens' confidence in it." Georgia v. McCollum, ante, at 49.

"In all kinds of litigation it is plain that where the burden
of proof lies may be decisive of the outcome." Speiser v.
Randall, 357 U. S., at 525. To be sure, the requirement of a
hearing (once there is a threshold doubt as to competency)
and the provision for a psychiatric evaluation, see Ake v.
Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68, 81 (1985), do ensure at least some
protection against the trial of incompetent persons. Yet in
cases where the evidence is inconclusive, a defendant bearing
the burden of proof of his own incompetency now will still
be subjected to trial. In my view, this introduces a systematic and unacceptably high risk that persons will be tried
and convicted who are unable to follow or participate in the
proceedings determining their fate. I, therefore, cannot
agree with the Court that "reasonable minds may differ as
to the wisdom of placing the burden of proof " on likely incompetent defendants. Ante, at 450.

Blackmun, J., dissenting
The Court suggests that "defense counsel will often havethe best-informed view of the defendant's ability to participate in his defense." Ibid. There are at least three goodreasons, however, to doubt the Court's confidence. First,
while the defendant is in custody, the State itself obviously
has the most direct, unfettered access to him and is in thebest position to observe his behavior. In the present case,

Medina was held before trial in the Orange County jail sys-tem for more than a year and a half prior to his competency
hearing. 3 Tr. 677-684. During the months immediatelypreceding the competency hearing, he was placed several
times for extended periods in a padded cell for treatment
and observation by prison psychiatric personnel. Id., at 226,
682-684. While Medina was in the padded cell, prison personnel observed his behavior every 15 minutes. Id., at 226.

Second, a competency determination is primarily a medical
and psychiatric determination. Competency determinations
by and large turn on the testimony of psychiatric experts,
not lawyers. "Although competency is a legal issue ultimately determined by the courts, recommendations by
mental health professionals exert tremendous influence on
judicial determinations, with rates of agreement typically
exceeding 90%." Nicholson & Johnson, Prediction of Competency to Stand Trial: Contribution of Demographics, Type
of Offense, Clinical Characteristics, and Psycholegal Ability,
14 Int'l J. Law and Psych. 287 (1991) (citations omitted). See
also S. Brakel, J. Parry, & B. Weiner, The Mentally Disabled
and the Law 703 (3d ed. 1985) (same). While the testimony
of psychiatric experts may be far from infallible, see Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880, 916 (1983) (Blackmun, J., dissenting), it is the experts and not the lawyers who are credited as the "best informed," and most able to gauge a
defendant's ability to understand and participate in the legal
proceedings affecting him.

Third, even assuming that defense counsel has the "bestinformed view" of the defendant's competency, the lawyer's

505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:36 PAGES OPINPGT
466 MEDINA v. CALIFORNIA

Blackmun, J., dissenting
view will likely have no outlet in, or effect on, the com-petency determination. Unlike the testimony of medical

specialists or lay witnesses, the testimony of defense coun-sel is far more likely to be discounted by the factfinder as
self-interested and biased. Defense counsel may also be
discouraged in the first place from testifying for fear ofabrogating an ethical responsibility or the attorney-client

privilege. See, e. g., ABA Criminal Justice Mental HealthStandards $ 7-4.8(b), Commentary Introduction, p. 209, and
Commentary, pp. 212-213 (1989). By way of example fromthe case at hand, it should come as little surprise that neither
of Medina's two attorneys was among the dozens of persons
testifying during the six days of competency proceedings in
this case. 1 Tr. 1-5 (witness list).

Like many psychological inquiries, competency evaluations
are "in the present state of the mental sciences . . . at best
a hazardous guess however conscientious." Solesbee v.
Balkcom, 339 U. S., at 23 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting). See
also Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S., at 81; Addington v. Texas,
441 U. S. 418, 430 (1979); Drope, 420 U. S., at 176. This unavoidable uncertainty expands the range of cases where the
factfinder will conclude the evidence is in equipoise. The
Court, however, dismisses this concern on grounds that
" `[d]ue process does not require that every conceivable step
be taken, at whatever cost, to eliminate the possibility of
convicting an innocent person.' " Ante, at 451 (quoting Patterson, 432 U. S., at 208). Yet surely the Due Process Clause
requires some conceivable steps be taken to eliminate the
risk of erroneous convictions. I search in vain for any guiding principle in the Court's analysis that determines when
the risk of a wrongful conviction happens to be acceptable
and when it does not.

The allocation of the burden of proof reflects a societal
judgment about how the risk of error should be distributed
between litigants. Cf. Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U. S. 745,
755 (1982) (standard of proof ). This Court has said it well

before: "The individual should not be asked to share equallywith society the risk of error when the possible injury to the

individual is significantly greater than any possible harm tothe state." Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S., at 427. The
costs to the State of bearing the burden of proof of compe-tency are not at all prohibitive. The Court acknowledges
that several States already bear the burden, ante, at 447-448, and that the allocation of the burden of proof will make
a difference "only in a narrow class of cases where the evi-dence is in equipoise,"

ante, at 449. In those few difficultcases, the State should bear the burden of remitting the defendant for further psychological observation to ensure thathe is competent to defend himself. See,

e. g., Cal. PenalCode Ann. $ 1370(a)(1) (West Supp. 1992) (defendant found

incompetent shall be "delivered" to state hospital or treat-ment facility "which will promote the defendant's speedy restoration to mental competence"). See also Jackson v. Indi-ana, 406 U. S. 715, 738 (1972) (Due Process Clause allows
State to hold incompetent defendant "for reasonable periodof time necessary to determine whether there is a substantial probability" of return to competency). In the narrowclass of cases where the evidence is in equipoise, the State
can reasonably expect that it will speedily be able to returnthe defendant for trial.

IV
Just this Term the Court reaffirmed that the Due ProcessClause prevents the States from taking measures that undermine the defendant's right to be tried while fully aware andable to defend himself. In Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U. S. 127
(1992), the Court reversed on due process grounds the con-viction of a defendant subjected to the forcible administration of antipsychotic drugs during his trial. Rejecting thedissent's insistence that actual prejudice be shown, the Court
found it to be "clearly possible" that the medications affectedthe defendant's "ability to follow the proceedings, or the substance of his communication with counsel." Id., at 137 (em505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:36 PAGES OPINPGT

phasis added). See also id., at 141 (Kennedy, J., concurringin judgment) (prosecution must show "no significant risk

that the medication will impair or alter in any material waythe defendant's capacity or willingness to react to the testimony at trial or to assist his counsel") (emphasis added).I consider it no less likely that petitioner Medina was tried
and sentenced to death while effectively unable to defendhimself. That is why I do not share the Court's remarkable
confidence that "[n]othing in today's decision is inconsistentwith our longstanding recognition that the criminal trial of
an incompetent defendant violates due process." Ante, at453. I do not believe the constitutional prohibition against
convicting incompetent persons remains "fundamental" if theState is at liberty to go forward with a trial when the evidence of competency is inconclusive. Accordingly, I dissent.

ESTATE OF COWART v. NICKLOS DRILLING CO.

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 91-17. Argued March 25, 1992--Decided June 22, 1992
Floyd Cowart, whose estate is the petitioner, was injured while working

on an oil drilling platform owned by Transco Exploration Company
(Transco), in an area subject to the Longshore and Harbor Workers'
Compensation Act (LHWCA or Act). The Department of Labor gave
respondent Compass Insurance Co. (Compass), the insurer for Cowart's
employer, respondent Nicklos Drilling Company (Nicklos), an informal
notice that Cowart was due permanent disability payments, but none
were ever made. In the meantime, Cowart settled a negligence action
with Transco, which Nicklos funded under an indemnification agreement
with Transco. However, Cowart did not secure from Nicklos or Compass a formal, prior, written approval of the settlement. Subsequently,
Cowart filed a claim with the Department of Labor seeking disability
payments from Nicklos. Nicklos denied liability on the ground that recovery was barred under $ 33(g) of the Act, which provides that a "person entitled to compensation" must obtain prior written approval from
the employer and its insurer of any settlement of a third-party claim,

$ 33(g)(1), and that the failure of the "employee" to secure the approval
results in forfeiture of all rights under the Act, $ 33(g)(2). The Administrative Law Judge awarded benefits, relying on past Benefits Review
Board (BRB) decisions: one in which the BRB held that in an earlier
version of $ 33(g) the words "person entitled to compensation" did not
refer to a person not yet receiving benefits; and another in which it held
that, since this phrase was not altered in the 1984 amendments to the
LHWCA that added $ 33(g)(2), Congress was presumed to have adopted
the BRB's interpretation. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that

$ 33(g) unambiguously provides for forfeiture whenever an LHWCA
claimant fails to meet the written-approval requirement.

Held: Section 33(g)'s forfeiture provision applies to a worker whose employer, at the time the worker settles with a third party, is neither
paying compensation to the worker nor subject to an order to pay under
the Act. The section's language is plain and cannot support the BRB's
interpretation. The normal meaning of entitlement includes a right or
benefit for which a person qualifies, regardless of whether the right or
benefit has been acknowledged or adjudicated. Thus, Cowart became

Opinion of the Court
"entitled to compensation" at the moment his right to recovery under
the Act vested. If the language of $ 33(g)(1) left any doubt, the ambiguity would be eliminated by the statute's structure, especially the addition of subsection (g)(2). This interpretation of $ 33(g) is reinforced by
the fact that the phrase "person entitled to compensation" is used elsewhere in the statute in contexts in which it cannot bear Cowart's meaning, and is not altered by the fact that subsection (g)(2) uses the term
"employee" rather than that phrase. Contrary to Cowart's argument,
this interpretation of $ 33(g) gives full meaning to all of subsection
(g)(2)'s notification and consent requirements. The question whether
Nicklos' participation in the settlement brings this case outside

$ 33(g)(1)'s terms is not addressed, since it was not fairly included within
the question on which certiorari was granted. The possible harsh effects of $ 33(g) are recognized, but it is the duty of the courts to enforce
the judgment of the legislature; it is Congress that has the authority to
change the statute, not the courts. Pp. 475-484.

sate workers injured or killed while employed upon the navi-gable waters of the United States. The Act allows injured

workers, without forgoing compensation under the Act, topursue claims against third parties for their injuries. But

$ 33(g) of the LHWCA, 33 U. S. C. $ 933(g), provides thatunder certain circumstances if a third-party claim is settled
without the written approval of the worker's employer, allfuture benefits including medical benefits are forfeited. The
question we must decide today is whether the forfeiture pro-vision applies to a worker whose employer, at the time the
worker settles with a third party, is neither paying compen-sation to the worker nor yet subject to an order to pay under
the Act. I

The injured worker in this case was Floyd Cowart, andhis estate is now the petitioner. Cowart suffered an injury
to his hand on July 20, 1983, while working on an oil drillingplatform owned by Transco Exploration Company (Transco).
The platform was located on the Outer Continental Shelf, anarea subject to the Act. 43 U. S. C. $ 1333(b). Cowart was
an employee of the Nicklos Drilling Company (Nicklos), whoalong with its insurer Compass Insurance Co. (Compass) are
respondents before us. Nicklos and Compass paid Cowarttemporary disability payments for 10 months following his
injury. At that point Cowart's treating physician releasedhim to return to work, though he found Cowart had a 40%
permanent partial disability. App. 75. The Department ofLabor notified Compass that Cowart was owed permanent
disability payments in the total amount of $35,592.77, pluspenalties and interest. This was an informal notice which
did not constitute an award. No payments were made.Cowart, meanwhile, had filed an action against Transco alleging that Transco's negligence caused his injury. On July1, 1985, Cowart settled the action for $45,000, of which he
received $29,350.60 after attorney's fees and expenses.Nicklos funded the entire settlement under an indemnifica505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:05 PAGES OPINPGT

tion agreement with Transco, and it had prior notice of thesettlement amount. But Cowart made a mistake: He did not

secure from Nicklos a formal, prior, written approval of theTransco settlement.

After settling, Cowart filed an administrative claim withthe Department of Labor seeking disability payments from
Nicklos. Nicklos denied liability on the grounds that underthe terms of $ 33(g)(2) of the LHWCA, Cowart had forfeited
his benefits by failing to secure approval from Nicklos andCompass of his settlement with Transco, in the manner required by $ 33(g)(1).Section 33(g) provides in pertinent part:

"(g) Compromise obtained by person entitled tocompensation

"(1) If the person entitled to compensation (or theperson's representative) enters into a settlement with a
third person referred to in subsection (a) of this sectionfor an amount less than the compensation to which the
person (or the person's representative) would be entitledunder this chapter, the employer shall be liable for compensation as determined under subsection (f) of this sec-tion only if written approval of the settlement is obtained from the employer and the employer's carrier,before the settlement is executed, and by the person
entitled to compensation (or the person's representa-tive). The approval shall be made on a form provided
by the Secretary and shall be filed in the office of thedeputy commissioner within thirty days after the settlement is entered into."(2) If no written approval of the settlement is obtained and filed as required by paragraph (1), or if theemployee fails to notify the employer of any settlement
obtained from or judgment rendered against a thirdperson, all rights to compensation and medical benefits
under this chapter shall be terminated, regardless ofwhether the employer or the employer's insurer has

made payments or acknowledged entitlement to benefitsunder this chapter." 33 U. S. C. $ 933(g).

The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) rejected Nicklos'argument on the basis of prior interpretations of $ 33(g) by
the Benefits Review Board (Board or BRB). In the firstof those decisions, O'Leary v. Southeast Stevedoring Co., 7
BRBS 144 (1977), aff 'd mem., 622 F. 2d 595 (CA9 1980), theBoard held that in an earlier version of $ 33(g) the words
"person entitled to compensation" referred only to injuredemployees whose employers were making compensation payments, whether voluntary or pursuant to an award. The
O'Leary decision held that a person not yet receiving bene-fits was not a "person entitled to compensation," even though

the person had a valid claim for benefits.The statute was amended to its present form, the form we
have quoted, in 1984. In that year Congress redesignatedthen subsection (g) to what is now (g)(1) and modified its
language somewhat, but did not change the phrase "personentitled to compensation." Congress also added the current
subsection (g)(2), as well as other provisions. Following the1984 amendments the Board decided

Dorsey v. Cooper Steve-doring Co., 18 BRBS 25 (1986), app. dism'd, 826 F. 2d 1011

(CA11 1987). The Board reaffirmed its interpretation in
O'Leary of the phrase "person entitled to compensation,"saying that because the 1984 amendments had not changed

the specific language, Congress was presumed to haveadopted the Board's previous interpretation. It noted that
nothing in the 1984 legislative history disclosed an intent tooverrule the Board's interpretations. The Board decided
that the forfeiture provisions of subsection (g)(2), includingthe final phrase providing that forfeiture occurs "regardless
of whether the employer . . . has made payments or acknowl-edged entitlement to benefits," was a "separate provisio[n]
applicable to separate situations." 18 BRBS, at 29.The ALJ in this case held that under the reasoning of
O'Leary and Dorsey, Cowart was not a person entitled to

compensation because he was not receiving payments at thetime of the Transco settlement. Thus, the written-approval

provision did not apply and Cowart was entitled to benefits.Cowart's total disability award was for $35,592.77, less Cowart's net recovery from Transco of $29,350.60, for a net award
of $6,242.17. In addition, Cowart was awarded interest, at-torney's fees, and future medical benefits, the last constituting, we think, a matter of great potential consequence. TheBoard affirmed in reliance on

Dorsey. 23 BRBS 42 (1989)
(per curiam).On review, a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth

Circuit reversed. 907 F. 2d 1552 (1990). Without addressing the Board's specific statutory interpretation, it held that

$ 33(g) contains no exceptions to its written-approval requirement. Because this holding, and a decision by a panel
in a different case, Petroleum Helicopters, Inc. v. Barger, 910
F. 2d 276 (CA5 1990), conflicted with a previous unpublished
decision in the same Circuit, Kahny v. O. W. C. P., 729 F. 2d
777 (CA5 1984), the Court of Appeals granted rehearing en
banc. The Director of the Office of Workers' Compensation
Programs (OWCP), a part of the Department of Labor, 20
CFR $ 701.201 (1991), appeared as a respondent before the
full Court of Appeals to defend the interpretation and decision of the Board.

In a per curiam opinion, the en banc Court of Appeals
confirmed the panel's decision reversing the BRB in its Cowart case. 927 F. 2d 828 (CA5 1991). The Court of Appeals'
majority held that $ 33(g) is unambiguous in providing for
forfeiture whenever an LHWCA claimant fails to get written
approval from his employer of a third-party settlement.
The majority acknowledged the well-established principle requiring judicial deference to reasonable interpretations by
an agency of the statute it administers, but concluded that
the plain language of $ 33(g) leaves no room for interpretation. Judge Politz, joined by Judges King and Johnson, dissented on the ground that the OWCP's was a reasonable

agency interpretation of the phrase "person entitled to compensation," to which the Court of Appeals should have
deferred.

We granted certiorari because of the large number of
LHWCA claimants who might be affected by the Court of
Appeals' decision. 502 U. S. 1003 (1991). We now affirm.

II
In a statutory construction case, the beginning point must
be the language of the statute, and when a statute speaks
with clarity to an issue judicial inquiry into the statute's
meaning, in all but the most extraordinary circumstance, is
finished. Demarest v. Manspeaker, 498 U. S. 184, 190 (1991).
The question is whether Cowart, at the time of the Transco
settlement, was a "person entitled to compensation" under
the terms of $ 33(g)(1) of the LHWCA. Cowart concedes
that he did not comply with the written-approval requirements of the statute, while Nicklos and Compass do not claim
that they lacked notice of the Transco settlement. By the
terms of $ 33(g)(2), Cowart would have forfeited his LHWCA
benefits if, and only if, he was subject to the written-approval
provisions of $ 33(g)(1). Cowart claims that he is not subject
to the approval requirement because in his view the phrase
"person entitled to compensation," as long interpreted by
both the BRB and the OWCP, limits the reach of $ 33(g)(1)
to injured workers who are either already receiving compensation payments from their employer, or in whose favor an
award of compensation has been entered. Nicklos and Compass, supported by the United States, defend the holding of
the Court of Appeals that $ 33(g) cannot support that reading. We agree with these respondents and hold that under
the plain language of $ 33(g), Cowart forfeited his right to
further LHWCA benefits by failing to obtain the written
approval of Nicklos and Compass prior to settling with
Transco.

Opinion of the Court
The controlling principle in this case is the basic and unex-ceptional rule that courts must give effect to the clear meaning of statutes as written. The principle can at times comeinto some tension with another fundamental principle of our
law, one requiring judicial deference to a reasonable statutory interpretation by an administering agency. Chevron
U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467
U. S. 837 (1984); National Railroad Passenger Corporationv.

Boston & Maine Corp., 503 U. S. 407, 417 (1992). Of
course, a reviewing court should not defer to an agency posi-tion which is contrary to an intent of Congress expressed in

unambiguous terms. K mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 U. S.
281, 291 (1988); Chevron, supra, at 842-843. In any event,
we need not resolve any tension of that sort here, because
the Director of the OWCP and the Department of Labor
have altered their position regarding the best interpretation
of $ 33(g). The Director appears as a respondent before us,
arguing in favor of the Court of Appeals' statutory interpretation, and contrary to his previous position. See Brief for
Federal Respondent 8, n. 6. If the Director asked us to
defer to his new statutory interpretation, this case might
present a difficult question regarding whether and under
what circumstances deference is due to an interpretation formulated during litigation. See Bowen v. Georgetown Univ.
Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 212-213 (1988); Martin v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm'n, 499 U. S. 144, 158
(1991). The agency does not ask this, however. Instead,
the federal respondent argues that the Court of Appeals was
correct in saying the language of $ 33(g) is plain and cannot
support the interpretation given it by the Board. Because
we agree with the federal respondent and the Court of Appeals, and because Cowart concedes that the position of the
BRB is not entitled to any special deference, see Brief for
Petitioner 25; see also Potomac Electric Power Co. v. Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, 449 U. S.

477Cite as: 505 U. S. 469 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
Health Review Comm'n, supra, we need not resolve the dif-ficult issues regarding deference which would be lurking in

other circumstances.As a preliminary matter, the natural reading of the statute
supports the Court of Appeals' conclusion that a person entitled to compensation need not be receiving compensation orhave had an adjudication in his favor. Both in legal and general usage, the normal meaning of entitlement includes aright or benefit for which a person qualifies, and it does not
depend upon whether the right has been acknowledged oradjudicated. It means only that the person satisfies the prerequisites attached to the right. See generally Board of
Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 577 (1972)
(discussing property interests protected by the Due Process
Clause and contrasting an entitlement to an expectancy);
Black's Law Dictionary 532 (6th ed. 1990) (defining "entitle"
as "To qualify for; to furnish with proper grounds for seeking
or claiming"). Cowart suffered an injury which by the
terms of the LHWCA gave him a right to compensation from
his employer. He became a person entitled to compensation
at the moment his right to recovery vested, not when his
employer admitted liability, an event even yet to happen.

If the language of $ 33(g)(1), in isolation, left any doubt,
the structure of the statute would remove all ambiguity.
First, and perhaps most important, when Congress amended

$ 33(g) in 1984, it added the explicit forfeiture features of

$ 33(g)(2), which specify that forfeiture occurs "regardless of
whether the employer or the employer's insurer has made
payments or acknowledged entitlement to benefits under this
chapter." We read that phrase to modify the entirety of
subsection (g)(2), including the beginning part discussing the
written-approval requirement of paragraph (1). The BRB
did not find this amendment controlling because the quoted
language is not an explicit modification of subsection (1).
This is a strained reading of what Congress intended. Subsection (g)(2) leaves little doubt that the contemplated for505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT
478 ESTATE OF COWART v. NICKLOS DRILLING CO.

Opinion of the Court
feiture will occur whether or not the employer has made pay-ments or acknowledged liability.

The addition of subsection (g)(2) in 1984 also precludesthe primary argument made by the BRB in favor of its decisions in Dorsey and this case, and repeated by Cowart to us:
That Congress in 1984, by reenacting the phrase "personentitled to compensation," adopted the Board's reading of

that language in O'Leary. The argument might have hadsome force if $ 33(g) had been reenacted without changes,
but that was not the case. In 1984 Congress did more thanreenact $ 33(g); it added new provisions and new language
which on their face appear to have the specific purpose of
overruling the prior administrative interpretation. In light
of the clear import of $ 33(g)(2), the Board erred in relying
on the purported lack of legislative history showing an explicit intent to reject the O'Leary decision. Even were it
relevant, the Board's reading of the legislative history is
suspect because as the federal respondent demonstrates, the
legislative history of predecessor bills to the eventual 1984
enactment do indicate an intent to overturn O'Leary. See
Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act
Amendments of 1981: Hearings on S. 1182 before the Subcommittee on Labor of the Senate Committee on Labor and
Human Resources, 97th Cong., 1st Sess., 209, 210-211, 396
(1981). In any event, administrative interpretation followed
by congressional reenactment cannot overcome the plain language of a statute. Demarest v. Manspeaker, 498 U. S., at
190. And the language of $ 33(g) is plain.

Our interpretation of $ 33(g) is reinforced by the fact that
the phrase "person entitled to compensation" appears elsewhere in the statute in contexts in which it cannot bear the
meaning placed on it by Cowart. For example, $ 14(h) of the
LHWCA, 33 U. S. C. $ 914(h), requires an official to conduct
an investigation upon the request of a person entitled to compensation when, inter alia, the claim is controverted and
payments are not being made. For that provision, the inter505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT

479Cite as: 505 U. S. 469 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
pretation championed by Cowart would be nonsensical. An-other difficulty would be presented for the provision preceding $ 33(g), $ 33(f). It mandates that an employer's liabilitybe reduced by the net amount a person entitled to compensation recovers from a third party. Under Cowart's reading,
the reduction would not be available to employers who hadnot yet begun payment at the time of the third-party recovery. That result makes no sense under the LHWCA struc-ture. Indeed, when a litigant before the BRB made this argument, the Board rejected it, acknowledging in so doingthat it had adopted differing interpretations of the identical
language in $$ 33(f) and 33(g). Force v. Kaiser Aluminum
and Chemical Corp., 23 BRBS 1, 4-5 (1989). This result is
contrary to the basic canon of statutory construction that
identical terms within an Act bear the same meaning. Sullivan v. Stroop, 496 U. S. 478, 484 (1990); Sorenson v. Secretary
of Treasury, 475 U. S. 851, 860 (1986). The Board's willingness to adopt such a forced and unconventional approach
does not convince us we should do the same. And we owe
no deference to the BRB, see supra, at 476.

Yet another reason why we are not convinced by the
Board's position is that the Board's interpretation of "person
entitled to compensation" has not been altogether consistent;
and Cowart's interpretation may not be the same as the
Board's in precise respects. At times the Board has said
this language refers to an employee whose "employer is actually paying compensation either pursuant to an award or voluntarily when claimant enters into a third party settlement."
Dorsey, 18 BRBS, at 28; 23 BRBS, at 44 (case below). At
other times, sometimes within the same opinion, the Board
has spoken in terms of the employer either making payments
or acknowledging liability. O'Leary, 7 BRBS, at 147-149;
Dorsey, supra, at 29; see also In re Wilson, 17 BRBS 471,
480 (ALJ 1985). Cowart, on the other hand, would include
within the phrase both employees receiving compensation
benefits and employees who have a judicial award of compen505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
sation but are not receiving benefits. Brief for Petitioner 6.This distinction is an important part of Cowart's response to

the position of the United States. Reply Brief for Petitioner8. It may be that the gap between the Board's and Cowart's
positions can be explained by the Board's inconsistency; but
that in itself weakens any argument that the Board's inter-pretation is entitled to some weight.

We do not believe that Congress' use of the word "em-ployee" in subsection (g)(2), rather than the phrase "person
entitled to compensation," undercuts our reading of thestatute. The plain meaning of subsection (g)(1) cannot be
altered by the use of a somewhat different term in another
part of the statute. Subsection (g)(2) does not purport to
speak to the question of who is required under subsection
(g)(1) to obtain prior written approval.

Cowart's strongest argument to the Court of Appeals was
that any ambiguity in the statute favors him because of the
deference due the OWCP Director's statutory construction,
a deference which Nicklos and Compass concede is appropriate. Brief for Private Respondents 7. As we have said,
we are not faced with this difficult issue because the views
of the OWCP Director have changed since we granted certiorari. Supra, at 476. It seems apparent to us that it would
be quite inappropriate to defer to an interpretation which
has been abandoned by the policymaking agency itself. It
is noteworthy, moreover, that even prior to this case the position of the Department of Labor has not been altogether
consistent. It is true that the Director has twice, albeit in
a somewhat equivocal manner, endorsed the Board's rulings
in O'Leary and Dorsey. First, in a 1986 circular discussing
the Board's Dorsey case a subordinate of the Director stated:
"While the Board's position may not be totally consistent
with the amended language of Section 33(g), we think it is a
rational approach and have advised the Associate Solicitor
that we will support this position." United States Dept. of
Labor, LHWCA Circular No. 86-3, p. 1 (May 30, 1986).

481Cite as: 505 U. S. 469 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
Next, in a manual published in 1989 the Director againadopted the Board's position that written approval of a settlement is required only from employers who are payingcompensation; but the statement ends with a qualifying
comment, that "[t]he issue of consent to a settlement can be
a complex matter. Judicial interpretation may be necessaryto resolve the issue. (See LHWCA CIRCULAR 86-03, 5-

30-86)." U. S. Dept. of Labor, Longshore and Harbor Work-ers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) Procedure Manual, ch. 3-
600, || 9 (Sept. 1989). On the other hand, the Department ofLabor has issued regulations (effective in their current form
since 1986) which are explicit that the written-approval requirement of $ 33(g) applies to a settlement for less than the
amount of compensation due under the LHWCA, "regardless
of whether the employer or carrier has made payments of
[sic] acknowledged entitlement to benefits under the Act."
20 CFR $ 702.281(b) (1991). So the Department of Labor
has not been speaking with one voice on this issue. This
further diminishes the persuasive power of the Director's
earlier decision to endorse the BRB's questionable interpretation, a decision he has since reconsidered.

The history of the Department of Labor regulation goes
far toward confirming our view of the significance of the 1984
amendments. The original $ 702.281, proposed in 1976 and
enacted in final form in 1977, required only that an employee
notify his employer and the Department of any third-party
claim, settlement, or judgment. 41 Fed. Reg. 34297 (1976);
42 Fed. Reg. 45303 (1977). The sole reference to the forfeiture provisions was a closing parenthetical: "Caution:
See 33 U. S. C. $ 933(g)." In 1985, in response to the 1984
congressional amendments, the Department proposed to
amend $ 702.281 by replacing the closing parenthetical with
a subsection (b), stating that failure to obtain written approval of settlements for amounts less than the compensation
due under the Act would lead to forfeiture of future benefits.
50 Fed. Reg. 400 (1985). In response to comments, the final

Opinion of the Court
rulemaking modified $ 702.281(b) to clarify that the forfeiture provision applied regardless of whether the employer
was paying compensation. 51 Fed. Reg. 4284-4285 (1986).
Thus the evolution of $ 702.281 suggests that at least some
elements within the Department of Labor read the 1984 statutory amendments to adopt a rule different from the Board's
previous decisions.

We also reject Cowart's argument that our interpretation
of $ 33(g) leaves the notification requirements of $ 33(g)(2)
without meaning. An employee is required to provide notification to his employer, but is not required to obtain written
approval, in two instances: (1) Where the employee obtains
a judgment, rather than a settlement, against a third party;
and (2) Where the employee settles for an amount greater
than or equal to the employer's total liability. Under our
construction the written-approval requirement of $ 33(g)(1)
is inapplicable in those instances, but the notification requirement of $ 33(g)(2) remains in force. That is why subsection (g)(2) mandates that an employer be notified of "any
settlement."

This view comports with the purposes and structure of

$ 33. Section 33(f) provides that the net amount of damages
recovered from any third party for the injuries sustained
reduces the compensation owed by the employer. So the
employer is a real party in interest with respect to any settlement that might reduce but not extinguish the employer's
liability. The written-approval requirement of $ 33(g) "protects the employer against his employee's accepting too little
for his cause of action against a third party." Banks v. Chicago Grain Trimmers Assn., Inc., 390 U. S. 459, 467 (1968).
In cases where a judgment is entered, however, the employee does not determine the amount of his recovery, and
employer approval, even if somehow feasible, would serve no
purpose. And in cases where the employee settles for
greater than the employer's liability, the employer is pro505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT

483Cite as: 505 U. S. 469 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
tected regardless of the precise amount of the settlement
because his liability for compensation is wiped out. Notification provides full protection to the employer in these situations because it ensures against fraudulent double recovery
by the employee.

As a final line of defense, Cowart's attorney suggested at
oral argument that Nicklos' participation in the Transco settlement brought this case outside the terms of $ 33(g)(1).
Tr. of Oral Arg. 4-7. Relying on the recent decision of the
Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in I. T. O. Corporation of Baltimore v. Sellman, 954 F. 2d 239, 242-243 (1992),
counsel argued that $ 33(g)(1) requires written approval only
of "settlement[s] with a third person," and that Nicklos' participation in the Transco settlement meant it was not with
a third person. Without indicating any view on the merits
of this contention, we do not address it because it is not
fairly included within the question on which certiorari
was granted. See this Court's Rule 14.1(a).

We need not today decide the retroactive effect of our decision, nor the relevance of res judicata principles for other
LHWCA beneficiaries who may be affected by our decision.
Cf. Pittston Coal Group v. Sebben, 488 U. S. 105, 121-123
(1988). We do recognize the stark and troubling possibility
that significant numbers of injured workers or their families
may be stripped of their LHWCA benefits by this statute,
and that its forfeiture penalty creates a trap for the unwary.
It also provides a powerful tool to employers who resist liability under the Act. Counsel for respondents stated during
oral argument that he had used the Transco settlement as a
means of avoiding Nicklos' liability under the LHWCA. Tr.
of Oral Arg. 23-26. These harsh effects of $ 33(g) may be
exacerbated by the inconsistent course followed over the
years by the federal agencies charged with enforcing the Act.
But Congress has spoken with great clarity to the precise
question raised by this case. It is the duty of the courts to

enforce the judgment of the Legislature, however much wemight question its wisdom or fairness. Often we have urged

the Congress to speak with greater clarity, and in this stat-ute it has done so. If the effects of the law are to be alleviated, that is within the province of the Legislature. It is
Congress that has the authority to change the statute, notthe courts.

For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals is

Affirmed.
Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice Stevens and
Justice O'Connor join, dissenting.

For more than 14 years, the Director of the Office of Work-ers' Compensation Programs interpreted the Longshore and

Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA or Act), 44
Stat. 1424, as amended, 33 U. S. C. $ 901 et seq., in the very
same way that petitioner Floyd Cowart's estate now urges.
Indeed, the Director advocated Cowart's position in the
Court of Appeals, both before the panel and before that court
en banc.

After certiorari was granted, however, and after Cowart's
opening brief was filed, the federal respondent informed this
Court: "In light of the en banc decision in this case, the
Department of Labor reexamined its views on the issue."
Brief for Federal Respondent 8, n. 6. The federal respondent now assures us that the interpretation the Director advanced and defended for 14 years is inconsistent with the
statute's "plain meaning." The Court today accepts that improbable contention, and in so doing rules that perhaps thousands of employees and their families must be denied death
and disability benefits. I cannot agree with the federal respondent's newly discovered interpretation, and still less do
I find it to be compelled by the "plain meaning" of the statute. The Court needlessly inflicts additional injury upon
these workers and their families. I dissent.

Ever since the LHWCA was adopted in 1927, it has in-cluded some version of the present $ 33(g), 33 U. S. C.

$ 933(g), the provision at issue in this case. Because thatprovision cannot be considered in isolation from the broader
context of $ 33, or indeed, the LHWCA as a whole, somebackground on the structure of the Act and the history of

$ 33's interpretation is essential.

A
The LHWCA requires employers to provide compensation,"irrespective of fault," for injuries and deaths arising out of

covered workers' employment. $$ 3(a) and 4(b), 33 U. S. C.$$ 903(a) and 904(b). In return for requiring the employer
to pay statutory compensation without proof of negligence,the Act grants the employer immunity from tort liability,
regardless of how serious its fault may have been. See$$ 5(a) and 33(i). Benefits under the LHWCA are strictly
limited, generally to medical expenses and two-thirds of lostearnings, and are set out in detailed schedules contained in
the Act itself. See $$ 7-9. A fundamental assumption ofthe Act is that employers liable for benefits will pay compensation "promptly," "directly," and "without an award" havingto be issued. See $ 14(a).

In a case where a third party may be liable, the LHWCAdoes not require a claimant to elect between statutory compensation and tort recovery. $ 33(a). Where a claimant hasaccepted compensation under a formal award, then, within a
specified time, he may file a civil action against the thirdparty. $ 33(b). If a claimant recovers in that action, his
compensation under the LHWCA is limited to the excess, ifany, of his statutory compensation over the net amount of
his recovery. $ 33(f ). Section 33(f ) thus operates as a setoffprovision, allowing an employer to reduce its LHWCA liability by the net amount a claimant obtains from a third party.Where the claimant nets as much or more from the third

party as he would have received from his employer under
the LHWCA, the employer owes him no benefits.

Section 33(g) of the LHWCA, 33 U. S. C. $ 933(g), addresses the situation in which a claimant-plaintiff settles an
action against a third party for less than he would have received under the Act. Under $ 33(f), considered alone, the
claimant in this situation would always be able to collect the
remainder of his statutory benefits from the employer. To
protect the employer from having to pay excessive $ 33(f)
compensation because of an employee's "lowball" settlement,

$ 33(g) conditions LHWCA compensation, in specified circumstances, upon the employer's written approval of the
third-party settlement. See Banks v. Chicago Grain Trimmers Assn., Inc., 390 U. S. 459, 467 (1968).

Before the LHWCA's 1984 amendments, $ 33(g) provided
that if a "person entitled to compensation" settled for less
than the compensation to which he was entitled under the
Act, then the employer would be liable for compensation, as
determined in $ 33(f ), only if the person obtained and duly
filed with the Department of Labor the employer's written
approval of the settlement. The meaning of the term "person entitled to compensation" has proved to be a difficult
issue, both in the pre-1984 version of the Act and--as this
case demonstrates--in the Act's current form.

B
This issue apparently was considered first in O'Leary v.
Southeast Stevedoring Co., 7 BRBS 144 (1977), aff 'd, 622
F. 2d 595 (CA9 1980). In that case, the employer denied
liability for the death of the claimant's husband, contending
that the decedent was not an employee covered by the
LHWCA and that the injury did not arise out of his employment. 7 BRBS, at 145. The employer persisted in denying
liability even after its position was rejected by the Benefits

Review Board (BRB or Board).1 See id., at 146-147. Eventually, more than 28 months after her husband's accident, the
claimant settled a third-party suit for $37,500. About one
month thereafter, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), on
remand from the BRB, entered an award for the claimant.
The value of the death benefits awarded, assuming that the
claimant would live out her normal life expectancy without
remarrying, amounted to more than $150,000. See In re
O'Leary, 5 BRBS 16, 20 (ALJ 1976). At that point, the employer contested liability for any compensation on the ground
that, under $ 33(g), the claimant had forfeited that compensation by failing to obtain the employer's written approval of
the settlement.

The ALJ rejected the employer's position, reasoning that
the claimant was not a "person entitled to compensation" at
the time of the settlement. The BRB affirmed. The Board
pointed out that the "underlying concept" of the LHWCA is
that "the employer upon being informed of an injury will
voluntarily begin to pay compensation." O'Leary, 7 BRBS,
at 147 (citing $ 14(a)). Further, the Board observed, $ 33(g)
refers to the conditions under which an employer will be "liable" for compensation under $ 33(f ); the reference to "liability," the Board reasoned, "contemplat[es] that [the] employer
either be making voluntary payments under the Act or that
it ha[s] been found liable for benefits by a judicial determination." Id., at 148. Moreover, the Board continued, $ 33(b)
gives the employer the right to pursue third parties only if
the employer is paying compensation under an award.
Thus, the premise of employer rights under $ 33, the Board
concluded, is that the employer is "making either voluntary
payments under the Act or pursuant to an award." Ibid.

empowered to "hear and determine appeals raising a substantial question
of law or fact" with respect to LHWCA benefits claims. $ 21(b)(3), 33

The BRB observed that the employer in O'Leary had notpaid compensation either voluntarily or pursuant to an

award, but, instead, consistently had denied liability. Itcould hardly have been clear to the claimant at the time she
settled her third-party suit that the BRB would ultimately
decide in her favor. Indeed, only after that settlement andafter the ALJ award did the employer concede that the

claimant represented a "person entitled to compensation,"and then only to argue that, for that reason, she had forfeited
her right to compensation under $ 33(g). The Board empha-sized that the employer's interpretation would place claimants in a severe bind:

"If a claimant was injured through the negligence of
a third party and the employer denied coverage underthe Act, a claimant would be forced to sue the third

party. However, even if the claimant obtained a reason-able settlement offer, an employer could refuse to give
its consent to the third party settlement for any number
of reasons, e. g., it does not wish to approve the settle-ment on a form provided under the Act since its consent

to jurisdiction under the Act might be inferred. Thiscould result in a claimant not being paid any compensation, yet the claimant would be afraid to make a thirdparty settlement for in so doing he might waive his
rights to compensation under the Act. Ultimately, aclaimant going without income for a long enough time
could be forced into a third party settlement without
employer's consent to obtain money . . . ." Id., at 149.

And under the employer's interpretation of $ 33(g), the employee would thereby forfeit all right to compensation under
the Act. Surely, the Board concluded, "Congress by requiring written consent could not have contemplated such a result." Ibid.

unpublished opinion, App. 113, stating: "The Board's ruling

is reasonable and furthers the underlying purpose of the
Act." Id., at 117. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in an unpublished opinion, upheld a similar BRB decision in 1984, finding the O'Leary approach "fully consistent
with the language, legislative history, and rationale of "

$ 33(g). See Kahny v. OWCP, 729 F. 2d 777 (table) and

The Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act
Amendments of 1984, 98 Stat. 1639, revisited $ 33(g). Id.,
at 1652. The former $ 33(g) was carried over, with minor
changes not relevant here, as $ 33(g)(1), and a new subsection
(g)(2) was added. Section 33(g) now reads as follows:

"(1) If the person entitled to compensation (or the
person's representative) enters into a settlement with a
third person referred to in subsection (a) for an amount
less than the compensation to which the person (or the
person's representative) would be entitled under this
Act, the employer shall be liable for compensation as
determined under subsection (f ) only if written approval
of the settlement is obtained from the employer and the
employer's carrier, before the settlement is executed,
and by the person entitled to compensation (or the person's representative). The approval shall be made on a
form provided by the Secretary and shall be filed in the
office of the deputy commissioner within thirty days
after the settlement is entered into.

"(2) If no written approval of the settlement is obtained and filed as required by paragraph (1), or if

the employee fails to notify the employer of any settlement obtained from or judgment rendered against a
third person, all rights to compensation and medical
benefits under this Act shall be terminated, regardless

of whether the employer or the employer's insurer hasmade payments or acknowledged entitlement to benefits

under this Act."
In Dorsey v. Cooper Stevedoring Co., 18 BRBS 25 (1986),appeal dism'd

sub nom. Cooper Stevedoring Co. v. Director,Office of Workers' Comp. Programs, U. S. Dept. of Labor, 826

F. 2d 1011 (CA11 1987), the Board rejected an employer'sargument that the final clause of the new $ 33(g)(2) should
be understood as overturning the O'Leary rule that no dutyto obtain approval arises until the employer begins to pay
compensation. Subsection (g)(1), the Board stated, reen-acted the prior version of $ 33(g) as it was interpreted in
O'Leary; the new subsection, (g)(2), was intended to apply tosituations not covered by (g)(1) or

O'Leary. In these situa-tions--where the employer has neither paid compensation

nor acknowledged liability--notice, but not written approval,is required. 18 BRBS, at 29-30. The Board interpreted
the final clause of (g)(2)--language that echoes the Board'swords in

O'Leary--to make clear that the notification re-quirement, described in (g)(2), was not subject to the

O'Leary limitation that is incorporated in (g)(1). 18 BRBS,at 29.

This interpretation is reinforced, the Board continued, bytwo other considerations. First, although in a number of
instances the 1984 legislative history indicates a congres-sional intention to override other BRB and judicial decisions,
that history "indicates no congressional intent to overrule
O'Leary." Id., at 30. Second, the Board observed, thisCourt has held that the LHWCA "should be construed in

order to further its purpose of compensating longshoremenand harbor workers `and in a way which avoids harsh and
incongruous results.' " Id., at 31, quoting Voris v. Eikel, 346U. S. 328, 333 (1953), and citing

Northeast Marine TerminalCo. v. Caputo, 432 U. S. 249, 268 (1977). As O'Leary made

clear, allowing employers to escape all LHWCA liability bywithholding approval from any settlement, while refusing to

pay benefits or acknowledge liability, could hardly be thoughtconsistent with the purpose of encouraging prompt, voluntary payment of LHWCA compensation.

D
Such was the legal background against which Cowart'sclaim was considered. In the administrative proceedings,

the BRB relied on O'Leary and Dorsey to reject the argu-ment, offered by respondent Nicklos Drilling Company, that
by failing to obtain prior written approval of his third-partysettlement Cowart had forfeited his LHWCA benefits. Because Nicklos was not paying Cowart benefits, either volun-tarily or under an award, the Board reasoned, Cowart was
not a "person entitled to compensation" within the meaningof $ 33(g)(1), and he therefore was not required to obtain
Nicklos' approval of his settlement. 23 BRBS 42, 46 (1989).Instead, the Board held, Cowart was required only to give
Nicklos notice of the settlement, as provided in $ 33(g)(2).Because Nicklos indisputably had notice of the settlement--
indeed, it had notice three months before the settlement wasconsummated--the Board ruled Cowart was eligible for
LHWCA benefits.On Nicklos' petition for review, the Director of the Office
of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP)--head of theagency charged with administering the Act--defended the
Board's interpretation before the Court of Appeals for theFifth Circuit. First a panel of the Court of Appeals, and
then the full court, by a divided vote sitting en banc, how-ever, rejected the Director's position, ruling that Cowart
was a "person entitled to compensation" and was requiredby $ 33(g)(1) to obtain Nicklos' written approval. See 907
F. 2d 1552 (1990) (panel), and 927 F. 2d 828 (1991) (en banc).We are told that after this Court granted certiorari, and
after Cowart filed his opening brief, the Director "reexam-ined" his position and argued that the interpretation of

$ 33(g) he had maintained for 14 years, and defended in the

492 ESTATE OF COWART v. NICKLOS DRILLING CO.

Blackmun, J., dissenting
Court of Appeals, was inconsistent with the Act's plainmeaning.

II
This Court today agrees with the Director's postcertiorariposition that Cowart's claim for compensation is barred by

the "clear meaning" of the statute "as written." Ante, at476. According to the Court, Cowart is plainly a "person
entitled to compensation" within the meaning of $ 33(g)(1),and his failure to obtain Nicklos' written approval of his
third-party settlement requires, by the "plain language" of$ 33(g), that he be deemed to have forfeited his statutory
benefits. Although the Court does not identify any plausi-ble statutory purpose whatsoever advanced by its reading,
and although--to its credit--it acknowledges the "harsheffects" of its interpretation, ante, at 483, the Court ultimately concludes that the language of $ 33 compels it to re-ject Cowart's position.

In my view, the language of $ 33 in no way compels theCourt to deny Cowart's claim. In fact, the Court's reliance
on the Act's "plain language," ante, at 475, is selective: asdiscussed below, analysis of $$ 33(b) and (f ) of the Act shows
that, even leaving aside the question whether Cowart is a"person entitled to compensation," a

consistently literal in-terpretation of the Act's language would not require Cowart

to have obtained Nicklos' written approval of the settlement.Indeed, under a thoroughgoing "plain meaning" approach,
Cowart would be entitled to receive full LHWCA benefitsin addition to his third-party settlement, not just the excess
of his statutory benefits over the settlement.At the same time, a consistently literal interpretation of
the Act would commit the Court to positions it might beunwilling to take. The conclusion I draw is not that the
Court should adopt a purely literal interpretation of the Act,but instead that the Court should recognize, as it has until
today, that the LHWCA must be read in light of the pur-poses and policies it would serve. Once that point is recog505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT

Blackmun, J., dissenting
nized, then, as suggested by the Court's closing remarks onthe "stark and troubling" implications of its interpretation,

ante, at 483, it follows that recognition of Cowart's claim isfully consistent with the Act.

A
Were the Court truly to interpret the Act "as written,"it would not conclude that Cowart is barred from receiving

compensation. Section 33(g)(1) of the LHWCA, on whichthe Court's "plain meaning" argument relies, provides that
if a "person entitled to compensation" settles with a thirdparty for an amount less than his statutory benefits, his employer will be "liable for compensation as determined under
subsection (f)" only if the "person entitled to compensation"obtains and files the employer's written approval. The "plain

language" of subsection (g)(1) does not establish any generalwritten-approval requirement binding either all "persons entitled to compensation," or the subset of those persons whosettle for less than their statutory benefits. Instead, it requires written approval only as a condition of receiving com-pensation "as determined under subsection (f)." Where the
"person entitled to compensation" is not eligible for compen-sation "as determined under subsection (f)," subsection (g)(1)
does not require him to obtain written approval.The "plain language" of subsection (f) in turn suggests
that the provision does not apply to Cowart's situation. Sub-section (f ), by its terms, applies only "[i]f the person entitled
to compensation institutes proceedings within the periodprescribed in subsection (b)." And the "period prescribed
in subsection (b)" begins, by the terms of that subsection,upon the person's "[a]cceptance of compensation under an
award in a compensation order filed by the deputy commis-sioner, an administrative law judge, or the Board." Cowart's third-party suit was clearly not instituted within thisperiod: He filed suit

before any award of LHWCA benefits,and he still has not accepted (or been offered) compensation

494 ESTATE OF COWART v. NICKLOS DRILLING CO.

Blackmun, J., dissenting
under any award. Thus, he does not come within the "plainmeaning" of subsection (f ), and, accordingly, for the reasons

given above, he would not be bound by the subsection (g)(1)written-approval requirement. It would also follow that,
because Nicklos indisputably received the notice required by
subsection (g)(2), that provision would not bar Cowart fromreceiving LHWCA compensation and medical benefits.

Indeed, if Cowart is not covered by subsection (f ), hewould appear to have been eligible for a larger award than
he sought. Subsection (f ) does not authorize compensationotherwise unavailable; instead, it operates as a

limit, in the
specified circumstances, on the employer's LHWCA liability.
If read literally, subsection (f) would not bar Cowart from
receiving full LHWCA benefits, in addition to the amount
he received in settlement of the third-party claim.

It is true that $ 33(f) has not always been read literally.
Subsection (f) has been assumed to be applicable where, for
example, the claimant's third-party suit was filed after an
employer voluntarily began paying LHWCA compensation,
not just where compensation was paid pursuant to an award.
See, e. g., I. T. O. Corp. of Baltimore v. Sellman, 954 F. 2d
239, 240, 243-245 (CA4 1992); Shellman v. United States
Lines, Inc., 528 F. 2d 675, 678-679, n. 2 (CA9 1975) (referring
to the availability of an employer's lien, where the employer
has paid compensation without an award, as "judicially created" rather than statutory), cert. denied, 425 U. S. 936
(1976). That interpretation is eminently sensible and consistent with the statutory purpose of encouraging employers
to make payments "promptly," directly," and "without an
award." See $ 14(a). A contrary interpretation would penalize employers who acknowledge liability and commence
payments without seeking an award, and it would reward
employers who, whether in good faith or bad, contest their
liability until faced with a formal award. See Shellman, 528
F. 2d, at 679, n. 2 ("The purpose of this Act would be frustrated if a different result could be reached merely because

Blackmun, J., dissenting
the employer pays compensation without entry of a formalaward").

It is not obvious, however, that a similar argument fromstatutory purpose should be available to employers such as
Nicklos who refuse to pay benefits and then seek shelterunder $ 33(f) (and by extension, $ 33(g)(1)). And the fact remains that the Court professes to interpret the "clear mean-ing" of the statute "as written." The Court's interpretation
today, however, is no more compelled by the language of theLHWCA than the interpretation Cowart defends: The Court
is simply insensible to the fact that it implicitly has reliedupon presumed statutory purposes and policy considerations
to bring Nicklos and Cowart under the setoff provisions of$ 33(f ), thus absolving Nicklos of the first $29,000 in LHWCA
liability. Only at that point does the Court invoke the plainmeaning rule and insist on a "literal" interpretation of

$ 33(g)(1). This selective insistence on "plain meaning" de-prives Cowart's estate of the last $6,242.17 Nicklos would
otherwise have been bound to pay.

B
For these reasons, I think it clear that a purely textualapproach to the LHWCA cannot justify the Court's holding.

In my view, a more sensible approach is to consider $ 33(g)as courts always have considered the other parts of $ 33--in
relation to the history, structure, and policies of the Act.

1
Looking first to $ 33's history, for present purposes themost relevant aspect is the 1984 amendment to $ 33(g)

through which that provision assumed its present form.The amended provision clearly bears the impress of the
Board's O'Leary decision. The reference in $ 33(g)(2) to thatsubsection's applicability, "regardless of whether the employer or the employer's insurer has made payments or ac-knowledged entitlement to benefits," tracks the limitation

496 ESTATE OF COWART v. NICKLOS DRILLING CO.

Blackmun, J., dissenting
recognized in O'Leary--a limitation that had been unani-mously approved by panels of two Federal Courts of Appeals. The question, then, is whether Congress sought toincorporate that holding or to repudiate it in the 1984 amendments to $ 33(g).The critical fact in this inquiry is Congress' use of the term
"employee," rather than "person entitled to compensation,"in connection with the notification requirement. The use of
this term is in marked contrast to the other clauses of $ 33(g).Section 33(g)(1) conditions $ 33(f ) compensation of a settling
"person entitled to compensation" on securing the employer'swritten approval, and $ 33(g)(2) provides, somewhat redundantly, that a "person entitled to compensation" forfeits allrights to compensation and medical benefits if the written
approval mentioned in $ 33(g)(1) is not obtained. The noti-fication clause of $ 33(g)(2), however, provides that "if the
employee fails to notify the employer of any settlement ob-tained from or judgment rendered against a third person,
all rights to compensation and medical benefits . . . shall beterminated, regardless of whether the employer or the employer's insurer has made payments or acknowledged entitle-ment to benefits" (emphasis added).

The use of the term "employee" in $ 33(g)(2) strongly sug-gests that Congress intended to incorporate the BRB's holding in O'Leary. As mentioned, the language Congress chosefor the last clause of $ 33(g)(2) indicates that it was aware the
Board had adopted a restrictive interpretation of the term"person entitled to compensation." Congress retained that
term in connection with the written-approval requirementof subsection (g)(1). Yet Congress chose the broad term,
"employee," for the notification clause of subsection (g)(2),and "employee," unlike "person entitled to compensation," is
a term expressly defined in the statute. See $ 2(3).2 The

Blackmun, J., dissenting
Court cannot explain why Congress would have chosen twodifferent terms to apply to the different requirements. Indeed, on the Court's interpretation, the two terms are identi-cal in their extension. On the Court's reading, the term
"person entitled to compensation" denotes only a statutoryemployee who has a claim that, aside from the requirements
of $ 33(g), would be recognized as valid. And that is exactlythe denotation of the term "employee" in connection with
the notification requirement. The fact that Congress choseto use different terms in connection with the different $ 33(g)
requirements--using, with respect to the written-approvalrequirement, a term that it knew had been narrowly interpreted, and using, with respect to the notification require-ment, a term broadly defined in the statute itself--surely
indicates that Congress intended the two terms to have dif-ferent meanings. Had Congress intended the meaning the
Court attributes to it, it would have used the same term inboth contexts.

The inference that Congress intended to adopt the O'Learyrule in the amended language of $ 33(g) is only strengthened

operations, and any harborworker including a ship repairman, shipbuilder,
and ship-breaker."

3 Two of the Court's other arguments concerning the 1984 amendments

may deserve brief mention. First, the Court suggests in passing that "the
legislative history of predecessor bills to the eventual 1984 enactment
do indicate an intent to overturn O'Leary," citing snippets of written testimony submitted during the lengthy 1981 hearings. See ante, at 478.
Needless to say, statements buried in hearings conducted three years before

the bill's passage fall far short of demonstrating any such congressional
intent. The BRB was correct when it said in Dorsey that the legislative
history of the 1984 amendments indicates no intention to overturn O'Leary.

Second, the Court places great significance upon the fact that "at least
some elements within the Department of Labor" read the post-1984 statute differently from the Director of OWCP. Ante, at 482. The Court is
quite clear, however, that it is the Director who administers the Act, see
ante, at 480, not these other "elements," and that the Director does not
ask for deference to his recently adopted interpretation.

498 ESTATE OF COWART v. NICKLOS DRILLING CO.

Blackmun, J., dissenting
by consideration of the factual context to which the provisionwas designed to apply. As the Board noted in

O'Leary, and
as the Director argued to the Court of Appeals, the Actpresumes that employers, as a rule, will promptly recognize

their LHWCA obligations and commence payments immediately, without the need for a formal award. See $ 14(a). Inthat situation, the claimant generally knows the value of the

benefits to be received, and can accurately compare that fig-ure to any settlement offer. The claimant in this situation
has no strong interest in the precise amount of any settle-ment that nets less than the statutory benefits, so long as
the costs of suit are covered, because by operation of $ 33(f),
he would not be allowed to retain any of the proceeds. On
the other hand, the employer who has acknowledged liability
has a strong interest in recovering from the third party any
benefits already paid to the claimant and in reducing or eliminating any future benefits it has committed itself to pay.
For the employer in this situation, the precise amount of a
settlement for less than the claimant's statutory benefits is
vitally important: any net dollar the claimant recovers in a
third-party action is a dollar less the employer will have to
pay in LHWCA benefits.

Given the parties' different incentives in the situation
where the employer already is paying benefits, it makes
sense to require the claimant to protect the employer's interest, by requiring settlements to be reasonable in the employer's judgment. At the same time, giving the employer this
power of approval does not generally threaten the claimant's
interests, since, as mentioned, only the employer has an interest in settlements above the threshold of the claimantplaintiff 's expenses and below the amount of promised or
delivered LHWCA benefits.

Matters are quite different, however, when (as in the present case) the employer has refused to make statutory payments and is not subject to an enforceable award at the time
of settlement. First, the claimant generally will not be able

505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT

499Cite as: 505 U. S. 469 (1992)
Blackmun, J., dissenting
to estimate with certainty whether he will receive anyLHWCA benefits, let alone how much. Accordingly, the

calculation required by $ 33(g)--a comparison betweenLHWCA benefits and settlement amount--will be far more
difficult. Second, the claimant who is not receiving
LHWCA payments, and who cannot be certain that he everwill receive payments, will have a much more powerful interest in negotiating a third-party settlement that is as favor-able as possible. This claimant, unlike its counterpart who
is receiving payments, therefore will have a strong incen-tive--independent of the $ 33(g) requirements--to protect
any interest the employer might have in reducing potential
LHWCA liability. Finally, disabled longshore employees, or
the families of a longshoreman killed on the job, are likely to
be in a highly vulnerable position, subject to financial pressure that may lead them to overvalue a present lump-sum
payment and undervalue future periodic payments that
might eventually be available under an LHWCA award.

The employer who refuses to pay, by contrast, has taken
the position that it owes no LHWCA benefits that may be
reduced through a third-party settlement, and thus that it
has no real interest in the amount for which the third party
settles. Moreover, as has been noted, the claimant who is
not receiving benefits has a strong incentive to protect the
employer's interest in reducing or eliminating any LHWCA
liability that might eventually be imposed. Under the
Court's interpretation of $ 33(g)(1), however, such an employer in many cases can ensure that it will never be required to pay LHWCA benefits, even if it might otherwise
ultimately be determined to be liable, simply by withholding
approval of any settlement offer, regardless of amount. In
practice, recalcitrant employers will seek to exempt themselves from statutory liability by withholding approval of
settlements, hoping that their employees' need for present
funds will force them to settle without approval. I cannot
believe that Congress intended to require LHWCA claim505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT
500 ESTATE OF COWART v. NICKLOS DRILLING CO.

Blackmun, J., dissenting
ants to bet their statutory benefits on the possibility thatfuture administrative and perhaps judicial proceedings,

years later, might vindicate their position that the employershould have been paying benefits--particularly when the
employer's asserted interest is already adequately protectedindependently of $ 33(g)(1).

3
The Court recognizes the patent unfairness of this situa-tion, and it as much as admits that its interpretation is out

of line with the policies of the Act. See ante, at 483. Never-theless, the Court holds that the plain meaning of the term
"person entitled to compensation" clearly applies to both cat-egories of claimants--those whose employers have denied liability, as well as those whose employers have acknowledgedthat they must pay statutory benefits. See ante, at 477.
For that reason, the Court implies, regardless of what Con-gress may have thought it was accomplishing in the 1984
amendments, the words "person entitled to compensation"simply will not bear the construction

O'Leary gave them.See ante, at 478-479.

Even setting aside my doubts, expressed above, about theplain meaning rule's application to this statute, I am not persuaded by the Court's contention. In my view, it does notstrain ordinary language to describe claimants whose employers have acknowledged LHWCA liability as "personsentitled to compensation," but to withhold that description
from claimants whose employers have denied liability forcompensation. This is particularly so, given the context in
which the term appears in the statute. Section 33(g)(1) re-quires the "person entitled to compensation" to compare two
figures--the amount of a settlement offer, on the one hand,and the amount of compensation to which the person is entitled, on the other. But what is that latter figure in a situa-tion in which the employer denies liability in full or in part?
Doubtless, the claimant could hazard a guess by consultingthe Act's jurisdictional provisions concerning who is covered

501Cite as: 505 U. S. 469 (1992)
Blackmun, J., dissenting
for which kind of accident, the compensation schedules in-cluded in the Act, and, in the case of a disability claim, the

opinion of the claimant's doctor that the claimant, in fact, isdisabled. The very nature of the situation, however, is that
it is not clear that such a person is indeed "entitled to com-pensation"--that question, after all, is exactly the issue that
the employer's position requires to be determined in admin-istrative and perhaps subsequent judicial proceedings. The
O'Leary limitation of the term "person entitled to compen-sation" to the situation in which the claimant's employer
has acknowledged liability and commenced payments seemsto me fully consistent with the requirements of ordinary
language.It is true, as the Court observes, that under the O'Leary
interpretation, the term "person entitled to compensation"would take on different meanings in different contexts. See
ante, at 478. This Court, however, has not inflexibly re-quired the same term to be interpreted in the same way for
all purposes. Compare Barnhill v. Johnson, 503 U. S. 393,401-402, and n. 9 (1992), with

id., at 406 (Stevens, J., dis-senting) (noting that the maxim is "not inexorable," but

arguing that because "nothing in the [statute's] structureor purpose" counsels otherwise, the Court should have applied it). This Court has recognized:

"Most words have different shades of meaning and con-sequently may be variously construed, not only when

they occur in different statutes, but when used morethan once in the same statute or even in the same
section. . . ."It is not unusual for the same word to be used with
different meanings in the same act, and there is no ruleof statutory construction which precludes the courts
from giving to the word the meaning which the legisla-ture intended it should have in each instance." Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers, Inc. v. United States, 286 U. S.427, 433 (1932).

502 ESTATE OF COWART v. NICKLOS DRILLING CO.

Blackmun, J., dissenting
This case is one in which the statutory term in questionshould be read contextually, rather than under the assumption that the term necessarily has the same meaning in allcontexts. The phrase "person entitled to compensation" is
not defined in the statute, and it is susceptible of at least two
interpretations--a "formalist" interpretation, according towhich one may be entitled to compensation whether or not

anyone ever acknowledges that fact, and a "positivist" or"legal realist" interpretation, according to which one is entitled to compensation only if the relevant decisionmaker hasso declared. Which of these two senses is "correct" will depend upon context. The latter sense, I have suggested, is
appropriate to a context in which liability for compensation
is disputed and the employee is called upon to predict the
future course of administrative and perhaps judicial proceedings--not just as to liability, but as to the precise amount of
liability. And, in any event, I think, the text and circumstances of the 1984 amendment to $ 33(g) indicate that Congress intended to adopt the "realist" interpretation found
in O'Leary.

Moreover, the Court simply has failed to apply, or even
mention, a maxim of interpretation, specifically applicable to
the LHWCA, that strongly supports Cowart's position.
This Court long has held that " `[t]his Act must be liberally

that the interpretation of $ 33(g) it has adopted has "harsheffects" and "creates a trap for the unwary." Ante, at 483.

For my part, I can imagine no more appropriate occasion onwhich the maxim should be applied.

Once it is recognized that a claimant whose employer de-nies LHWCA liability is not a "person entitled to compensation" for purposes of $ 33(g)(1), the proper resolution of thiscase is clear. Cowart was just such a claimant, and, accordingly, he was not bound by $ 33(g)(1)'s written-approvalrequirement. It is undisputed that he satisfied the notice
requirement of $ 33(g)(2). It follows that $ 33(g) is no barto Cowart's eligibility for benefits.

III
The Court recognizes "the stark and troubling possibilitythat significant numbers of injured workers or their families

may be stripped of their LHWCA benefits by this statute."Ibid. It attempts to justify the "harsh effects" of its decision on the ground that it is but the faithful agent of theLegislature, and "Congress has spoken with great clarity to
the precise question raised by this case." Ibid. In myview, Congress did not answer the question in the way the
Court suggests, let alone did it do so "with great clarity."The responsibility for today's unfortunate decision rests not
with Congress, but with this very Court.I dissent.

ESTATE OF CIPOLLONE v. LIGGETT GROUP,INC.,

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 90-1038. Argued October 8, 1991--Reargued January 13, 1992--

Decided June 24, 1992

Section 4 of the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (1965

Act) required a conspicuous label warning of smoking's health hazards
to be placed on every package of cigarettes sold in this country, while

$ 5 of that Act, captioned "Preemption," provided: "(a) No statement
relating to smoking and health, other than the [$ 4] statement . . . , shall
be required on any cigarette package," and "(b) No [such] statement . . .
shall be required in the advertising of any cigarettes the packages of
which are labeled in conformity with" $ 4. Section 5(b) was amended
by the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969 (1969 Act) to specify: "No requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall
be imposed under State law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of which are [lawfully] labeled." Petitioner's complaint in his action for damages invoked the District Court's
diversity jurisdiction and alleged, inter alia, that respondent cigarette
manufacturers were responsible for the 1984 death of his mother, a
smoker since 1942, because they breached express warranties contained
in their advertising, failed to warn consumers about smoking's hazards,
fraudulently misrepresented those hazards to consumers, and conspired
to deprive the public of medical and scientific information about smoking, all in derogation of duties created by New Jersey law. The District
Court ultimately ruled, among other things, that these claims were preempted by the 1965 and 1969 Acts to the extent that the claims relied
on respondents' advertising, promotional, and public relations activities
after the effective date of the 1965 Act. The Court of Appeals affirmed
on this point.

Held: The judgment is reversed in part and affirmed in part, and the case

is remanded.

893 F. 2d 541, reversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded.

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I, II, III, and IV, concluding that $ 5 of the 1965 Act did not pre505us2108K 07-16-96 16:46:27 PAGES OPINPGT

empt state-law damages actions, but superseded only positive enactments by state and federal rulemaking bodies mandating particular
warnings on cigarette labels or in cigarette advertisements. This conclusion is required by the section's precise and narrow prohibition of
required cautionary "statement[s]"; by the strong presumption against
pre-emption of state police power regulations; by the fact that the required $ 4 warning does not by its own effect foreclose additional obligations imposed under state law; by the fact that there is no general,
inherent conflict between federal pre-emption of state warning requirements and the continued vitality of common-law damages actions; and
by the Act's stated purpose and regulatory context, which establish that

$ 5 was passed to prevent a multiplicity of pending and diverse "regulations," a word that most naturally refers to positive enactments rather
than common-law actions. Pp. 517-520.

Justice Stevens, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice White,
and Justice O'Connor, concluded in Parts V and VI that $ 5(b) of the
1969 Act pre-empts certain of petitioner's failure-to-warn and fraudulent misrepresentation claims, but does not pre-empt other such claims
or the claims based on express warranty or conspiracy. Pp. 520-530.

(a) The broad language of amended $ 5(b) extends the section's preemptive reach beyond positive enactments to include some common-law
damages actions. The statutory phrase "requirement or prohibition"
suggests no distinction between positive enactments and common law,
but, in fact, easily encompasses obligations that take the form of
common-law rules, while the phrase "imposed under State law" clearly
contemplates common law as well as statutes and regulations. This
does not mean, however, that $ 5(b) pre-empts all common-law claims,
nor does the statute indicate that any familiar subdivision of common
law is or is not pre-empted. Instead, the precise language of $ 5(b) must
be fairly but--in light of the presumption against pre-emption--narrowly construed, and each of petitioner's common-law claims must be
examined to determine whether it is in fact pre-empted. The central
inquiry in each case is straightforward: whether the legal duty that is
the predicate of the common-law damages action satisfies $ 5(b)'s express
terms, giving those terms a fair but narrow reading. Each phrase
within the section limits the universe of common-law claims pre-empted
by the statute. Pp. 517-524.

(b) Insofar as claims under either of petitioner's failure-to-warn theories--i. e., that respondents were negligent in the manner that they tested, researched, sold, promoted, and advertised their cigarettes, and
that they failed to provide adequate warnings of smoking's consequences--require a showing that respondents' post-1969 advertising or

Syllabus
promotions should have included additional, or more clearly stated,
warnings, those claims rely on a state-law "requirement or prohibition
. . . with respect to . . . advertising or promotion" within $ 5(b)'s meaning
and are pre-empted. Pp. 524-525.

(c) To the extent that petitioner has a viable claim for breach of express warranties, that claim is not pre-empted. While the general duty
not to breach such warranties arises under state law, a manufacturer's
liability for the breach derives from, and is measured by, the terms of
the warranty. A common-law remedy for a contractual commitment
voluntarily undertaken should not be regarded as a "requirement . . .
imposed under State law" under $ 5(b). Pp. 525-527.

(d) Because $ 5(b) pre-empts "prohibition[s]" as well as "requirement[s]," it supersedes petitioner's first fraudulent-misrepresentation
theory, which is predicated on a state-law prohibition against advertising and promotional statements tending to minimize smoking's health
hazards, and which alleges that respondents' advertising neutralized the
effect of the federally mandated warning labels. However, the claims
based on petitioner's second fraudulent-misrepresentation theory--
which alleges intentional fraud both by false representation and concealment of material facts--are not pre-empted. The concealment allegations, insofar as they rely on a state-law duty to disclose material facts
through channels of communication other than advertising and promotions, do not involve an obligation "with respect to" those activities
within $ 5(b)'s meaning. Moreover, those fraudulent-misrepresentation
claims that do arise with respect to advertising and promotions are not
predicated on a duty "based on smoking and health" but rather on a
more general obligation--the duty not to deceive. Pp. 527-529.

(e) Petitioner's claim alleging a conspiracy among respondents to misrepresent or conceal material facts concerning smoking's health hazards
is not pre-empted, since the predicate duty not to conspire to commit
fraud that underlies that claim is not a prohibition "based on smoking
and health" as that $ 5(b) phrase is properly construed. P. 530.

Justice Blackmun, joined by Justice Kennedy and Justice
Souter, concluded that the modified language of $ 5(b) in the 1969
Act does not clearly exhibit the necessary congressional intent to preempt state common-law damages actions, and therefore concurred in
the judgment that certain of petitioner's failure-to-warn and fraudulentmisrepresentation claims, as well as his express warranty and conspiracy claims, are not pre-empted by that Act. Pp. 533-534.

Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, concluded that all of
petitioner's common-law claims are pre-empted by the 1969 Act under
ordinary principles of statutory construction, and therefore concurred
in the judgment that certain of his post-1969 failure-to-warn claims

508 CIPOLLONE v. LIGGETT GROUP, INC.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court,
except as to Parts V and VI.

"Warning: The Surgeon General Has Determined
That Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous to Your
Health." A federal statute enacted in 1969 requires that
warning (or a variation thereof) to appear in a conspicuous
place on every package of cigarettes sold in the United
States.1 The questions presented to us by this case are
whether that statute, or its 1965 predecessor which required
a less alarming label, pre-empted petitioner's common-law
claims against respondent cigarette manufacturers.

Petitioner is the son of Rose Cipollone, who began smoking
in 1942 and who died of lung cancer in 1984. He claims that
respondents are responsible for Rose Cipollone's death because they breached express warranties contained in their
advertising, because they failed to warn consumers about the
hazards of smoking, because they fraudulently misrepresented those hazards to consumers, and because they conspired to deprive the public of medical and scientific information about smoking. The Court of Appeals held that
petitioner's state-law claims were pre-empted by federal
statutes, 893 F. 2d 541 (CA3 1990), and other courts have
agreed with that analysis.2 The highest court of the State
of New Jersey, however, has held that the federal statutes

1 Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969, Pub. L. 91-222, 84 Stat.
87, as amended, 15 U. S. C. $$ 1331-1340. In 1984, Congress amended the
statute to require four more explicit warnings, used on a rotating basis.
See Comprehensive Smoking Education Act, Pub. L. 98-474, 98 Stat. 2201.
Because petitioner's claims arose before 1984, neither party relies on this
later Act.

2 The Court of Appeals' analysis was initially set forth in Cipollone v.

Liggett Group, Inc., 789 F. 2d 181 (CA3 1986). Other federal courts have
adopted a similar analysis. See Pennington v. Vistron Corp., 876 F. 2d
414 (CA5 1989); Roysdon v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 849 F. 2d 230 (CA6
1988); Stephen v. American Brands, Inc., 825 F. 2d 312 (CA11 1987);

Opinion of the Court
did not pre-empt similar common-law claims.3 Because ofthe manifest importance of the issue, we granted certiorari

to resolve the conflict, 499 U. S. 935 (1991). We now reversein part and affirm in part.

I
On August 1, 1983, Rose Cipollone and her husband filed acomplaint invoking the diversity jurisdiction of the Federal

District Court. Their complaint alleged that Rose Cipollonedeveloped lung cancer because she smoked cigarettes manufactured and sold by the three respondents. After herdeath in 1984, her husband filed an amended complaint.
After trial, he also died; their son, executor of both estates,now maintains this action.

Petitioner's third amended complaint alleges several dif-ferent bases of recovery, relying on theories of strict liability,
negligence, express warranty, and intentional tort. Theseclaims, all based on New Jersey law, divide into five categories. The "design defect claims" allege that respondents'cigarettes were defective because respondents failed to use
a safer alternative design for their products and because thesocial value of their product was outweighed by the dangers
it created (Count 2, App. 83-84). The "failure to warnclaims" allege both that the product was "defective as a result of [respondents'] failure to provide adequate warningsof the health consequences of cigarette smoking" (Count 3,
App. 85) and that respondents "were negligent in the manner[that] they tested, researched, sold, promoted and advertised" their cigarettes (Count 4, App. 86). The "expresswarranty claims" allege that respondents had "expressly

3 Dewey v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 121 N. J. 69, 577 A. 2d 1239 (1990)
(holding that the Cigarette Act does not pre-empt plaintiff's failure-towarn and misrepresentation claims); see also Forster v. R. J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co., 437 N. W. 2d 655 (Minn. 1989) (holding that plaintiffs' claim
in strict liability for unsafe design was not pre-empted; claims for misrepresentation and breach of express warranty would also not be preempted).

510 CIPOLLONE v. LIGGETT GROUP, INC.

Opinion of the Court
warranted that smoking the cigarettes which they manufactured and sold did not present any significant health consequences" (Count 7, App. 88). The "fraudulent misrepresentation claims" allege that respondents had willfully, "through
their advertising, attempted to neutralize the [federally
mandated] warnin[g]" labels (Count 6, App. 87-88), and that
they had possessed, but had "ignored and failed to act upon,"
medical and scientific data indicating that "cigarettes were
hazardous to the health of consumers" (Count 8, App. 89).
Finally, the "conspiracy to defraud claims" allege that respondents conspired to deprive the public of such medical
and scientific data (ibid.).

As one of their defenses, respondents contended that the
Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, enacted in
1965, and its successor, the Public Health Cigarette Smoking
Act of 1969, protected them from any liability based on their
conduct after 1965. In a pretrial ruling, the District Court
concluded that the federal statutes were intended to establish a uniform warning that would prevail throughout the
country and that would protect cigarette manufacturers from
being "subjected to varying requirements from state to
state," Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 593 F. Supp. 1146,
1148 (NJ 1984), but that the statutes did not pre-empt
common-law actions. Id., at 1153-1170.4 Accordingly, the
court granted a motion to strike the pre-emption defense
entirely.

4 The court explained:
"However, the existence of the present federally mandated warning does
not prevent an individual from claiming that the risks of smoking are
greater than the warning indicates, and that therefore such warning is
inadequate. The court recognizes that it will be extremely difficult for a
plaintiff to prove that the present warning is inadequate to inform of the
dangers, whatever they may be. However, the difficulty of proof cannot
preclude the opportunity to be heard, and affording that opportunity will
not undermine the purposes of the Act." 593 F. Supp., at 1148.

Opinion of the Court
The Court of Appeals accepted an interlocutory appealpursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 1292(b), and reversed. Cipollone v.

Liggett Group, Inc., 789 F. 2d 181 (CA3 1986). The courtrejected respondents' contention that the federal Acts expressly pre-empted common-law actions, but accepted theircontention that such actions would conflict with federal law.
Relying on the statement of purpose in the statutes,5 thecourt concluded that Congress' "carefully drawn balance between the purposes of warning the public of the hazards ofcigarette smoking and protecting the interests of national
economy" would be upset by state-law damages actionsbased on noncompliance with "warning, advertisement, and
promotion obligations other than those prescribed in the[federal] Act."

Id., at 187. Accordingly, the court held:

"[T]he Act preempts those state law damage[s] actionsrelating to smoking and health that challenge either the

adequacy of the warning on cigarette packages or thepropriety of a party's actions with respect to the advertising and promotion of cigarettes. [W]here the successof a state law damage[s] claim necessarily depends on
the assertion that a party bore the duty to provide awarning to consumers in addition to the warning Congress has required on cigarette packages, such claimsare preempted as conflicting with the Act." Ibid. (footnote omitted).
5 "It is the policy of the Congress, and the purpose of this chapter, to
establish a comprehensive Federal program to deal with cigarette labeling
and advertising with respect to any relationship between smoking and
health, whereby--

"(1) the public may be adequately informed that cigarette smoking may
be hazardous to health by inclusion of a warning to that effect on each
package of cigarettes; and

"(2) commerce and the national economy may be (A) protected to the
maximum extent consistent with this declared policy and (B) not impeded
by diverse, nonuniform, and confusing cigarette labeling and advertising
regulations with respect to any relationship between smoking and health."

512 CIPOLLONE v. LIGGETT GROUP, INC.

Opinion of the Court
The court did not, however, identify the specific claims asserted by petitioner that were pre-empted by the Act.

This Court denied a petition for certiorari, 479 U. S. 1043
(1987), and the case returned to the District Court for trial.
Complying with the Court of Appeals' mandate, the District Court held that the failure-to-warn, express-warranty,
fraudulent-misrepresentation, and conspiracy-to-defraud
claims were barred to the extent that they relied on respondents' advertising, promotional, and public relations activities after January 1, 1966 (the effective date of the 1965
Act). 649 F. Supp. 664, 669, 673-675 (NJ 1986). The court
also ruled that while the design defect claims were not
pre-empted by federal law, those claims were barred on
other grounds.6 Id., at 669-672. Following extensive discovery and a 4-month trial, the jury answered a series
of special interrogatories and awarded $400,000 in damages
to Rose Cipollone's husband. In brief, it rejected all of

the fraudulent-misrepresentation and conspiracy claims, but
found that respondent Liggett had breached its duty to warn
and its express warranties before 1966. It found, however,
that Rose Cipollone had " `voluntarily and unreasonably encounter[ed] a known danger by smoking cigarettes' " and that
80% of the responsibility for her injuries was attributable
to her. See 893 F. 2d, at 554 (summarizing jury findings).
For that reason, no damages were awarded to her estate.
However, the jury awarded damages to compensate her husband for losses caused by respondents' breach of express
warranty.

On cross-appeals from the final judgment, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's pre-emption rulings but
remanded for a new trial on several issues not relevant to
our decision. We granted the petition for certiorari to consider the pre-emptive effect of the federal statutes.

6 We are not presented with any question concerning these claims.

Opinion of the Court

II
Although physicians had suspected a link between smok-ing and illness for centuries, the first medical studies of that

connection did not appear until the 1920's. See U. S. Dept.of Health and Human Services, Report of the Surgeon General, Reducing the Health Consequences of Smoking: 25Years of Progress 5 (1989). The ensuing decades saw a wide
range of epidemiologic and laboratory studies on the healthhazards of smoking. Thus, by the time the Surgeon General
convened an advisory committee to examine the issue in1962, there were more than 7,000 publications examining the
relationship between smoking and health. Id., at 5-7.In 1964, the advisory committee issued its report, which
stated as its central conclusion: "Cigarette smoking is ahealth hazard of sufficient importance in the United States
to warrant appropriate remedial action." U. S. Dept. ofHealth, Education, and Welfare, U. S. Surgeon General's Advisory Committee, Smoking and Health 33 (1964). Relyingin part on that report, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC),
which had long regulated unfair and deceptive advertisingpractices in the cigarette industry,

7 promulgated a new trade

regulation rule. That rule, which was to take effect January1, 1965, established that it would be a violation of the Federal

Trade Commission Act "to fail to disclose, clearly and promi-nently, in all advertising and on every pack, box, carton, or
container [of cigarettes] that cigarette smoking is danger-ous to health and may cause death from cancer and other
diseases." 29 Fed. Reg. 8325 (1964). Several States alsomoved to regulate the advertising and labeling of cigarettes.
See, e. g., 1965 N. Y. Laws, ch. 470; see also 111 Cong. Rec.13900-13902 (1965) (statement of Sen. Moss). Upon a congressional request, the FTC postponed enforcement of its

Opinion of the Court
new regulation for six months. In July 1965, Congress en-acted the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act

(1965 Act or Act).8 The 1965 Act effectively adopted half ofthe FTC's regulation: the Act mandated warnings on cigarette packages ($ 5(a)), but barred the requirement of suchwarnings in cigarette advertising ($ 5(b)).

9

Section 2 of the Act declares the statute's two purposes:(1) adequately informing the public that cigarette smoking

may be hazardous to health, and (2) protecting the nationaleconomy from the burden imposed by diverse, nonuniform,
and confusing cigarette labeling and advertising regula-tions.

10 In furtherance of the first purpose, $ 4 of the Act

made it unlawful to sell or distribute any cigarettes in theUnited States unless the package bore a conspicuous label

stating: "Caution: Cigarette Smoking May Be Hazardous to Your Health." In furtherance of the second pur-pose, $ 5, captioned "Preemption," provided in part:

"(a) No statement relating to smoking and health,other than the statement required by section 4 of this
Act, shall be required on any cigarette package."(b) No statement relating to smoking and health
shall be required in the advertising of any cigarettes thepackages of which are labeled in conformity with the
provisions of this Act."
Although the Act took effect January 1, 1966, $ 10 of the Actprovided that its provisions affecting the regulation of advertising would terminate on July 1, 1969.As that termination date approached, federal authorities
prepared to issue further regulations on cigarette advertis-ing. The FTC announced the reinstitution of its 1964 pro8 Pub. L. 89-92, 79 Stat. 282, as amended, 15 U. S. C. $$ 1331-1340.
9 However, $ 5(c) of the Act expressly preserved "the authority of the

Federal Trade Commission with respect to unfair or deceptive acts or
practices in the advertising of cigarettes." 79 Stat. 283.

Opinion of the Court
ceedings concerning a warning requirement for cigarette
advertisements. 34 Fed. Reg. 7917 (1969). The Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) announced that it would
consider "a proposed rule which would ban the broadcast of
cigarette commercials by radio and television stations." Id.,
at 1959. State authorities also prepared to take actions regulating cigarette advertisements.11

It was in this context that Congress enacted the Public
Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969 (1969 Act or Act),12
which amended the 1965 Act in several ways. First, the
1969 Act strengthened the warning label, in part by requiring a statement that cigarette smoking "is dangerous" rather
than that it "may be hazardous." Second, the 1969 Act
banned cigarette advertising in "any medium of electronic
communication subject to [FCC] jurisdiction." Third, and
related, the 1969 Act modified the pre-emption provision by
replacing the original $ 5(b) with a provision that reads:

"(b) No requirement or prohibition based on smoking
and health shall be imposed under State law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes
the packages of which are labeled in conformity with the
provisions of this Act."

Although the Act also directed the FTC not to "take any
action before July 1, 1971, with respect to its pending trade

not persuaded that the labeling obligation imposed by boththe 1965 and 1969 Acts revealed a congressional intent to

exert exclusive federal control over every aspect of the rela-tionship between cigarettes and health. Id., at 186. Nevertheless, reading the statute as a whole in the light of thestatement of purpose in $ 2, and considering the potential
regulatory effect of state common-law actions on the federalinterest in uniformity, the Court of Appeals concluded that
Congress had impliedly pre-empted petitioner's claims chal-lenging the adequacy of the warnings on labels or in advertising or the propriety of respondents' advertising and pro-motional activities.

Id., at 187.In our opinion, the pre-emptive scope of the 1965 Act and

the 1969 Act is governed entirely by the express language in$ 5 of each Act. When Congress has considered the issue
of pre-emption and has included in the enacted legislationa provision explicitly addressing that issue, and when that
provision provides a "reliable indicium of congressional in-tent with respect to state authority,"

Malone v. White Motor

provisions" of the legislation. California Federal Sav-ings & Loan Assn. v. Guerra, 479 U. S. 272, 282 (1987) (opinion of Marshall, J.). Such reasoning is a variant of thefamiliar principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius:
Congress' enactment of a provision defining the pre-emptivereach of a statute implies that matters beyond that reach are
not pre-empted. In this case, the other provisions of the1965 and 1969 Acts offer no cause to look beyond $ 5 of each
Act. Therefore, we need only identify the domain expresslypre-empted by each of those sections. As the 1965 and 1969
provisions differ substantially, we consider each in turn.

broad as the 1965 provision. The court's ultimate ruling that petitioner's
claims were impliedly pre-empted effective January 1, 1966, reflects the
fact that the 1969 Act did not alter the statement of purpose in $ 2, which
was critical to the court's implied pre-emption analysis.

518 CIPOLLONE v. LIGGETT GROUP, INC.

Opinion of the Court

IV
In the 1965 pre-emption provision regarding advertising($ 5(b)), Congress spoke precisely and narrowly: "No

state-ment relating to smoking and health shall be required in the

advertising of [properly labeled] cigarettes." Section 5(a)used the same phrase ("No statement relating to smoking
and health") with regard to cigarette labeling. As $ 5(a)made clear, that phrase referred to the sort of warning
provided for in $ 4, which set forth verbatim the warningCongress determined to be appropriate. Thus, on their
face, these provisions merely prohibited state and federalrulemaking bodies from mandating particular cautionary
statements on cigarette labels ($ 5(a)) or in cigarette ad-vertisements ($ 5(b)).

Beyond the precise words of these provisions, this read-ing is appropriate for several reasons. First, as discussed
above, we must construe these provisions in light of the pre-sumption against the pre-emption of state police power regulations. This presumption reinforces the appropriateness ofa narrow reading of $ 5. Second, the warning required in $ 4
does not by its own effect foreclose additional obligationsimposed under state law. That Congress requires a particular warning label does not automatically pre-empt a regula-tory field. See

McDermott v. Wisconsin, 228 U. S. 115, 131-132 (1913). Third, there is no general, inherent conflict

between federal pre-emption of state warning requirementsand the continued vitality of state common-law damages
actions. For example, in the Comprehensive SmokelessTobacco Health Education Act of 1986,

14 Congress expressly

pre-empted state or local imposition of a "statement relatingto the use of smokeless tobacco products and health" but, at

the same time, preserved state-law damages actions basedon those products. See 15 U. S. C. $ 4406. All of these considerations indicate that $ 5 is best read as having super14 Pub. L. 99-252, 100 Stat. 30, as codified, 15 U. S. C. $$ 4401-4408.

519Cite as: 505 U. S. 504 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
seded only positive enactments by legislatures or administrative agencies that mandate particular warning labels.15

This reading comports with the 1965 Act's statement of
purpose, which expressed an intent to avoid "diverse, nonuniform, and confusing cigarette labeling and advertising
regulations with respect to any relationship between smoking and health." Read against the backdrop of regulatory
activity undertaken by state legislatures and federal agencies in response to the Surgeon General's report, the term
"regulation" most naturally refers to positive enactments by
those bodies, not to common-law damages actions.

The regulatory context of the 1965 Act also supports such
a reading. As noted above, a warning requirement promulgated by the FTC and other requirements under consideration by the States were the catalyst for passage of the 1965
Act. These regulatory actions animated the passage of $ 5,
which reflected Congress' efforts to prevent "a multiplicity
of State and local regulations pertaining to labeling of cigarette packages," H. R. Rep. No. 449, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 4
(1965), and to "preemp[t] all Federal, State, and local authorities from requiring any statement relating to smoking and
health in the advertising of cigarettes." Id., at 5 (emphasis
supplied).16

For these reasons, we conclude that $ 5 of the 1965 Act
only pre-empted state and federal rulemaking bodies from

15 Cf. Banzhaf v. FCC, 132 U. S. App. D. C. 14, 405 F. 2d 1082 (1968)
(holding that 1965 Act did not pre-empt FCC's fairness policy as applied
to cigarette advertising), cert. denied, 396 U. S. 842 (1969).

16 Justice Scalia takes issue with our narrow reading of the phrase

"No statement." His criticism, however, relies solely on an interpretation
of those two words, artificially severed from both textual and legislative
context. As demonstrated above, the phrase "No statement" in $ 5(b) refers to the similar phrase in $ 5(a), which refers in turn to $ 4, which itself
sets forth a particular statement. This context, combined with the regulatory setting in which Congress acted, establishes that a narrow reading
of the phrase "No statement" is appropriate.

mandating particular cautionary statements and did not
pre-empt state-law damages actions.17

V
Compared to its predecessor in the 1965 Act, the plain language of the pre-emption provision in the 1969 Act is much
broader. First, the later Act bars not simply "statement[s]"
but rather "requirement[s] or prohibition[s] . . . imposed
under State law." Second, the later Act reaches beyond
statements "in the advertising" to obligations "with respect
to the advertising or promotion" of cigarettes.

Notwithstanding these substantial differences in language,
both petitioner and respondents contend that the 1969 Act
did not materially alter the pre-emptive scope of federal
law.18 Their primary support for this contention is a sentence in a Committee Report which states that the 1969
amendment "clarified" the 1965 version of $ 5(b). S. Rep.
No. 91-566, p. 12 (1969). We reject the parties' reading as
incompatible with the language and origins of the amendments. As we noted in another context, "[i]nferences from
legislative history cannot rest on so slender a reed. Moreover, the views of a subsequent Congress form a hazardous
basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one." United
States v. Price, 361 U. S. 304, 313 (1960). The 1969 Act
worked substantial changes in the law: rewriting the label
warning, banning broadcast advertising, and allowing the
FTC to regulate print advertising. In the context of such
revisions and in light of the substantial changes in wording,

17 This interpretation of the 1965 Act appears to be consistent with respondents' contemporaneous understanding of the Act. Although respondents have participated in a great deal of litigation relating to cigarette use beginning in the 1950's, it appears that this case is the first in
which they have raised $ 5 as a pre-emption defense.

we cannot accept the parties' claim that the 1969 Act did notalter the reach of $ 5(b).

19

Petitioner next contends that $ 5(b), however broadenedby the 1969 Act, does not pre-empt

common-law actions.
He offers two theories for limiting the reach of the amended$ 5(b). First, he argues that common-law damages actions

do not impose "requirement[s] or prohibition[s]" and that
Congress intended only to trump "state statute[s], injunc-tion[s], or executive pronouncement[s]."

20 We disagree;

such an analysis is at odds both with the plain words of the1969 Act and with the general understanding of common-law

damages actions. The phrase "[n]o requirement or prohibi-tion" sweeps broadly and suggests no distinction between
positive enactments and common law; to the contrary, thosewords easily encompass obligations that take the form of
common-law rules. As we noted in another context, "[state]
regulation can be as effectively exerted through an award
of damages as through some form of preventive relief. The
obligation to pay compensation can be, indeed is designed to
be, a potent method of governing conduct and controlling
policy." San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon,
359 U. S. 236, 247 (1959).

Although portions of the legislative history of the 1969 Act
suggest that Congress was primarily concerned with positive
enactments by States and localities, see S. Rep. No. 91-566,
p. 12, the language of the Act plainly reaches beyond such
enactments. "We must give effect to this plain language unless there is good reason to believe Congress intended the
language to have some more restrictive meaning." Shaw v.

19 As noted above, the 1965 Act's statement of purpose ($ 2) suggested
that Congress was concerned primarily with "regulations"--positive enactments, rather than common-law damages actions. Although the 1969
Act did not amend $ 2, we are not persuaded that the retention of that
portion of the 1965 Act is a sufficient basis for rejecting the plain meaning
of the broad language that Congress added to $ 5(b).

522 CIPOLLONE v. LIGGETT GROUP, INC.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S. 85, 97 (1983). In this casethere is no "good reason to believe" that Congress meant less

than what it said; indeed, in light of the narrowness of the1965 Act, there is "good reason to believe" that Congress
meant precisely what it said in amending that Act.

Moreover, common-law damages actions of the sort raisedby petitioner are premised on the existence of a legal duty,

and it is difficult to say that such actions do not impose "re-quirements or prohibitions." See W. Prosser, Law of Torts
4 (4th ed. 1971); Black's Law Dictionary 1489 (6th ed. 1990)(defining "tort" as "always [involving] a violation of some
duty owing to plaintiff "). It is in this way that the 1969
version of $ 5(b) differs from its predecessor: Whereas the
common law would not normally require a vendor to use any
specific statement on its packages or in its advertisements,
it is the essence of the common law to enforce duties that
are either affirmative requirements or negative prohibitions.
We therefore reject petitioner's argument that the phrase
"requirement or prohibition" limits the 1969 Act's preemptive scope to positive enactments by legislatures and
agencies.

Petitioner's second argument for excluding common-law
rules from the reach of $ 5(b) hinges on the phrase "imposed
under State law." This argument fails as well. At least
since Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938), we have
recognized the phrase "state law" to include common law as
well as statutes and regulations. Indeed just last Term, the
Court stated that the phrase " `all other law, including State
and municipal law' " "does not admit of [a] distinction . . .
between positive enactments and common-law rules of liability." Norfolk & Western R. Co. v. Train Dispatchers, 499
U. S. 117, 128 (1991). Although the presumption against
pre-emption might give good reason to construe the phrase
"state law" in a pre-emption provision more narrowly than
an identical phrase in another context, in this case such a
construction is not appropriate. As explained above, the

Opinion of Stevens, J.
1965 version of $ 5 was precise and narrow on its face; the
obviously broader language of the 1969 version extended
that section's pre-emptive reach. Moreover, while the version of the 1969 Act passed by the Senate pre-empted "any
State statute or regulation with respect to . . . advertising or
promotion," S. Rep. No. 91-566, p. 16 (1969), the Conference
Committee replaced this language with "State law with
respect to advertising or promotion." In such a situation,

$ 5(b)'s pre-emption of "state law" cannot fairly be limited to
positive enactments.

That the pre-emptive scope of $ 5(b) cannot be limited to
positive enactments does not mean that that section preempts all common-law claims. For example, as respondents
concede, $ 5(b) does not generally pre-empt "state-law obligations to avoid marketing cigarettes with manufacturing defects or to use a demonstrably safer alternative design for
cigarettes." 21 For purposes of $ 5(b), the common law is not
of a piece.

Nor does the statute indicate that any familiar subdivision
of common-law claims is or is not pre-empted. We therefore
cannot follow petitioner's passing suggestion that $ 5(b) preempts liability for omissions but not for acts, or that $ 5(b)
pre-empts liability for unintentional torts but not for intentional torts. Instead we must fairly but--in light of the
strong presumption against pre-emption--narrowly construe
the precise language of $ 5(b) and we must look to each of
petitioner's common-law claims to determine whether it is
in fact pre-empted.22 The central inquiry in each case is

21 Brief for Respondents 14.
22 Petitioner makes much of the fact that Congress did not expressly

include common law within $ 5's pre-emptive reach, as it has in other statutes. See, e. g., 29 U. S. C. $ 1144(c)(1); 12 U. S. C. $ 1715z-17(d). Respondents make much of the fact that Congress did not include a saving clause
preserving common-law claims, again, as it has in other statutes. See,
e. g., 17 U. S. C. $ 301. Under our analysis of $ 5, these omissions make
perfect sense: Congress was neither pre-empting nor saving common law

505us2108K 07-16-96 16:46:27 PAGES OPINPGT
524 CIPOLLONE v. LIGGETT GROUP, INC.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
straightforward: we ask whether the legal duty that is the
predicate of the common-law damages action constitutes a
"requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health . . .
imposed under State law with respect to . . . advertising or
promotion," giving that clause a fair but narrow reading.
As discussed below, each phrase within that clause limits the
universe of common-law claims pre-empted by the statute.

We consider each category of damages actions in turn. In
doing so, we express no opinion on whether these actions are
viable claims as a matter of state law; we assume, arguendo,
that they are.

Failure to Warn

To establish liability for a failure to warn, petitioner must
show that "a warning is necessary to make a product . . .
reasonably safe, suitable and fit for its intended use," that
respondents failed to provide such a warning, and that that
failure was a proximate cause of petitioner's injury. Tr.
12738. In this case, petitioner offered two closely related
theories concerning the failure to warn: first, that respondents "were negligent in the manner [that] they tested, researched, sold, promoted, and advertised" their cigarettes;
and second, that respondents failed to provide "adequate
warnings of the health consequences of cigarette smoking."
App. 85-86.

Petitioner's claims are pre-empted to the extent that they
rely on a state-law "requirement or prohibition . . . with respect to . . . advertising or promotion." Thus, insofar as
claims under either failure-to-warn theory require a showing
that respondents' post-1969 advertising or promotions should
have included additional, or more clearly stated, warnings,
those claims are pre-empted. The Act does not, however,
pre-empt petitioner's claims that rely solely on respondents'

as a whole--it was simply pre-empting particular common-law claims,
while saving others.

testing or research practices or other actions unrelated toadvertising or promotion.

Breach of Express Warranty

Petitioner's claim for breach of an express warranty arisesunder N. J. Stat. Ann. $ 12A:2-313(1)(a) (West 1962), which

provides:

"Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the sellerto the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes

part of the basis of the bargain creates an express war-ranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation
or promise."
Petitioner's evidence of an express warranty consists largelyof statements made in respondents' advertising. See 893

F. 2d, at 574, 576; 683 F. Supp. 1487, 1497 (NJ 1988). Apply-ing the Court of Appeals' ruling that Congress pre-empted
"damage[s] actions . . . that challenge . . . the propriety of aparty's actions with respect to the advertising and promotion
of cigarettes," 789 F. 2d, at 187, the District Court ruled thatthis claim "inevitably brings into question [respondents'] advertising and promotional activities, and is therefore pre-empted" after 1965. 649 F. Supp., at 675. As demonstrated
above, however, the 1969 Act does not sweep so broadly: Theappropriate inquiry is not whether a claim challenges the
"propriety" of advertising and promotion, but whether theclaim would require the imposition under state law of a requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health withrespect to advertising or promotion.

A manufacturer's liability for breach of an express war-ranty derives from, and is measured by, the terms of that
warranty. Accordingly, the "requirement[s]" imposed by anexpress warranty claim are not "imposed under State law,"
but rather imposed by the warrantor.23 If, for example, a

23 Thus it is that express warranty claims are said to sound in contract
rather than in tort. Compare Black's Law Dictionary 1489 (6th ed. 1990)
(defining "tort": "There must always be a violation of some duty . . . and

Opinion of Stevens, J.
manufacturer expressly promised to pay a smoker's medicalbills if she contracted emphysema, the duty to honor that

promise could not fairly be said to be "imposed under statelaw," but rather is best understood as undertaken by the
manufacturer itself. While the general duty not to breachwarranties arises under state law, the particular "requirement . . . based on smoking and health . . . with respect tothe advertising or promotion [of] cigarettes" in an express
warranty claim arises from the manufacturer's statements inits advertisements. In short, a common-law remedy for a
contractual commitment voluntarily undertaken should notbe regarded as a "requirement . . .

imposed under State law"within the meaning of $ 5(b).
24

That the terms of the warranty may have been set forthin advertisements rather than in separate documents is irrelevant to the pre-emption issue (though possibly not to thestate-law issue of whether the alleged warranty is valid and
enforceable) because, although the breach of warranty claimis made "with respect to . . . advertising," it does not rest on
a duty imposed under state law. Accordingly, to the extentthat petitioner has a viable claim for breach of express wargenerally such duty must arise by operation of law and not by mere agreement of the parties") with id., at 322 (defining "contract": "An agreement
between two . . . persons which creates an obligation").

24 Justice Scalia contends that because the general duty to honor express warranties arises under state law, every express warranty obligation is a "requirement . . . imposed under State law," and that, therefore,
the Act pre-empts petitioner's express warranty claim. Justice Scalia
might be correct if the Act pre-empted "liability" imposed under state
law (as he suggests, post, at 551); but instead the Act expressly pre-empts
only a "requirement or prohibition" imposed under state law. That a
"contract has no legal force apart from the [state] law that acknowledges
its binding character," Norfolk & Western R. Co. v. Train Dispatchers,
499 U. S. 117, 130 (1991), does not mean that every contractual provision
is "imposed under State law." To the contrary, common understanding
dictates that a contractual requirement, although only enforceable under
state law, is not "imposed" by the State, but rather is "imposed" by the
contracting party upon itself.

ranties made by respondents, that claim is not pre-emptedby the 1969 Act.

Fraudulent Misrepresentation

Petitioner alleges two theories of fraudulent misrepresen-tation. First, petitioner alleges that respondents, through

their advertising, neutralized the effect of federally man-dated warning labels. Such a claim is predicated on a statelaw prohibition against statements in advertising and promo-tional materials that tend to minimize the health hazards
associated with smoking. Such a prohibition, however, ismerely the converse of a state-law

requirement that warn-ings be included in advertising and promotional materials.

Section 5(b) of the 1969 Act pre-empts both requirementsand prohibitions; it therefore supersedes petitioner's first
fraudulent-misrepresentation theory.Regulators have long recognized the relationship between
prohibitions on advertising that downplays the dangers ofsmoking and requirements for warnings in advertisements.
For example, the FTC, in promulgating its initial trade regu-lation rule in 1964, criticized advertising that "associated cigarette smoking with such positive attributes as contentment,glamour, romance, youth, happiness . . . at the same time
suggesting that smoking is an activity at least consistentwith physical health and well-being." The Commission
concluded:

"To avoid giving a false impression that smoking [is] in-nocuous, the cigarette manufacturer who represents the

alleged pleasures or satisfactions of cigarette smokingin his advertising must also disclose the serious risks to
life that smoking involves." 29 Fed. Reg. 8356 (1964).
Longstanding regulations of the Food and Drug Administra-tion express a similar understanding of the relationship between required warnings and advertising that "negates ordisclaims" those warnings: "A hazardous substance shall not
be deemed to have met [federal labeling] requirements if

there appears in or on the label . . . statements, designs, orother graphic material that in any manner negates or disclaims [the required warning]." 21 CFR $ 191.102 (1965).In this light it seems quite clear that petitioner's first theory
of fraudulent misrepresentation is inextricably related topetitioner's first failure-to-warn theory, a theory that we
have already concluded is largely pre-empted by $ 5(b).Petitioner's second theory, as construed by the District
Court, alleges intentional fraud and misrepresentation bothby "false representation of a material fact [and by] conceal[-
ment of] a material fact." Tr. 12727.25 The predicate ofthis claim is a state-law duty not to make false statements
of material fact or to conceal such facts. Our pre-emptionanalysis requires us to determine whether such a duty is the
sort of requirement or prohibition proscribed by $ 5(b).Section 5(b) pre-empts only the imposition of state-law obligations "with respect to the advertising or promotion" ofcigarettes. Petitioner's claims that respondents concealed
material facts are therefore not pre-empted insofar as thoseclaims rely on a state-law duty to disclose such facts through
channels of communication other than advertising or promo-tion. Thus, for example, if state law obliged respondents
to disclose material facts about smoking and health to anadministrative agency, $ 5(b) would not pre-empt a state-law
claim based on a failure to fulfill that obligation.Moreover, petitioner's fraudulent-misrepresentation claims
that do arise with respect to advertising and promotions(most notably claims based on allegedly false statements of
material fact made in advertisements) are not pre-emptedby $ 5(b). Such claims are predicated not on a duty "based
on smoking and health" but rather on a more general obliga25 The District Court stated that this claim "consists of the following
elements: 1) a material misrepresentation of . . . fact [by false statement
or concealment]; 2) knowledge of the falsity . . . ; 3) intent that the misrepresentation be relied upon; 4) justifiable reliance . . . ; 5) resultant damage."

tion--the duty not to deceive. This understanding of fraudby intentional misstatement is appropriate for several reasons. First, in the 1969 Act, Congress offered no sign thatit wished to insulate cigarette manufacturers from longstanding rules governing fraud. To the contrary, both the1965 and the 1969 Acts explicitly reserved the FTC's authority to identify and punish deceptive advertising practices--an authority that the FTC had long exercised and continues
to exercise. See $ 5(c) of the 1965 Act; $ 7(b) of the 1969Act; see also nn. 7, 9,

supra. This indicates that Congressintended the phrase "relating to smoking and health" (which

was essentially unchanged by the 1969 Act) to be construednarrowly, so as not to proscribe the regulation of deceptive
advertising.26Moreover, this reading of "based on smoking and health"
is wholly consistent with the purposes of the 1969 Act.State-law prohibitions on false statements of material fact do
not create "diverse, nonuniform, and confusing" standards.Unlike state-law obligations concerning the warning necessary to render a product "reasonably safe," state-law pro-scriptions on intentional fraud rely only on a single, uniform
standard: falsity. Thus, we conclude that the phrase "basedon smoking and health" fairly but narrowly construed does
not encompass the more general duty not to make fraudulentstatements. Accordingly, petitioner's claim based on allegedly fraudulent statements made in respondents' advertise-ments is not pre-empted by $ 5(b) of the 1969 Act.

27

26 The Senate Report emphasized that the "preemption of regulation or
prohibition with respect to cigarette advertising is narrowly phrased to
preempt only State action based on smoking and health. It would in no
way affect the power of any State . . . with respect to the taxation or the
sale of cigarettes to minors, or the prohibition of smoking in public buildings, or similar police regulations." S. Rep. No. 91-566, p. 12 (1969) (emphasis supplied).

27 Both Justice Blackmun and Justice Scalia challenge the level of

generality employed in our analysis. Justice Blackmun contends that,
as a matter of consistency, we should construe failure-to-warn claims not

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Conspiracy to Misrepresent or Conceal Material Facts

Petitioner's final claim alleges a conspiracy among re-spondents to misrepresent or conceal material facts concerning the health hazards of smoking.28 The predicate duty un-derlying this claim is a duty not to conspire to commit fraud.
For the reasons stated in our analysis of petitioner's inten-tional fraud claim, this duty is not pre-empted by $ 5(b) for
it is not a prohibition "based on smoking and health" as thatphrase is properly construed. Accordingly, we conclude that
the 1969 Act does not pre-empt petitioner's conspiracy claim.

VI
To summarize our holding: The 1965 Act did not pre-emptstate-law damages actions; the 1969 Act pre-empts petitioner's claims based on a failure to warn and the neutralization
as based on smoking and health, but rather as based on the broader duty "to
inform consumers of known risks." Post, at 543. Justice Scalia contends that, again as a matter of consistency, we should construe fraudulentmisrepresentation claims not as based on a general duty not to deceive
but rather as "based on smoking and health." Admittedly, each of these
positions has some conceptual attraction. However, our ambition here is
not theoretical elegance, but rather a fair understanding of congressional
purpose.

To analyze failure-to-warn claims at the highest level of generality (as
Justice Blackmun would have us do) would render the 1969 amendments almost meaningless and would pay too little respect to Congress'
substantial reworking of the Act. On the other hand, to analyze fraud
claims at the lowest level of generality (as Justice Scalia would have
us do) would conflict both with the background presumption against preemption and with legislative history that plainly expresses an intent to
preserve the "police regulations" of the States. See n. 25, supra.

28 The District Court described the evidence of conspiracy as follows:

"Evidence presented by [petitioner], particularly that contained in the
documents of [respondents] themselves, indicates . . . that the industry of
which these [respondents] were and are a part entered into a sophisticated
conspiracy. The conspiracy was organized to refute, undermine, and neutralize information coming from the scientific and medical community . . . ."

of federally mandated warnings to the extent that thoseclaims rely on omissions or inclusions in respondents' advertising or promotions; the 1969 Act does not pre-empt peti-tioner's claims based on express warranty, intentional fraud

It is so ordered.

Justice Souter join, concurring in part, concurring in thejudgment in part, and dissenting in part.

I
The Court today would craft a compromise position con-cerning the extent to which federal law pre-empts persons

injured by cigarette manufacturers' unlawful conduct frombringing state common-law damages claims against those
manufacturers. I, however, find the Court's divided holdingwith respect to the original and amended versions of the
federal statute entirely unsatisfactory. Our precedents donot allow us to infer a scope of pre-emption beyond that
which clearly is mandated by Congress' language. In myview, neither version of the federal legislation at issue here
provides the kind of unambiguous evidence of congressionalintent necessary to displace state common-law damages
claims. I therefore join Parts I, II, III, and IV of theCourt's opinion, but dissent from Parts V and VI.

A
I agree with the Court's exposition, in Part III of its opin-ion, of the underlying principles of pre-emption law, and in

particular with its recognition that the pre-emptive scope ofthe Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (1965
Act or Act) and the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of

1969 (1969 Act) is "governed entirely by the express lan-guage" of the statutes' pre-emption provisions.

Ante, at
517. Where, as here, Congress has included in legislationa specific provision addressing--and indeed, entitled--preemption, the Court's task is one of statutory interpretation--
only to "identify the domain expressly pre-empted" by theprovision.

Ibid. An interpreting court must " `begin with
the language employed by Congress and the assumption thatthe ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses

the legislative purpose.' " FMC Corp. v. Holliday, 498 U. S.52, 57 (1990) (quoting

Park 'N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park &
Fly, Inc., 469 U. S. 189, 194 (1985)). See California Coastal
Comm'n v. Granite Rock Co., 480 U. S. 572, 591-593 (1987);
California Federal Savings & Loan Assn. v. Guerra, 479

U. S. 272, 282 (1987) (opinion of Marshall, J.). We resort to
principles of implied pre-emption--that is, inquiring whether
Congress has occupied a particular field with the intent to
supplant state law or whether state law actually conflicts
with federal law, see English v. General Electric Co., 496
U. S. 72, 79 (1990)--only when Congress has been silent with
respect to pre-emption.

I further agree with the Court that we cannot find the
state common-law damages claims at issue in this case preempted by federal law in the absence of clear and unambiguous evidence that Congress intended that result. See ante,
at 516. The Court describes this reluctance to infer preemption in ambiguous cases as a "presumption against the
pre-emption of state police power regulations." Ante, at
518. Although many of the cases in which the Court has
invoked such a presumption against displacement of state
law have involved implied pre-emption, see, e. g., Florida
Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U. S. 132, 146-
152 (1963); Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218,
236-237 (1947), this Court often speaks in general terms
without reference to the nature of the pre-emption at issue
in the given statutory scheme. See, e. g., Maryland v. Loui505us2108K 07-16-96 16:46:27 PAGES OPINPGT

siana, 451 U. S. 725, 746 (1981) ("Consideration under the
Supremacy Clause starts with the basic assumption that
Congress did not intend to displace state law"); Avocado
Growers, 373 U. S., at 146-147 ("[W]e are not to conclude
that Congress legislated the ouster of this [state] statute . . .
in the absence of an unambiguous congressional mandate to
that effect"); Bethlehem Steel Co. v. New York State Labor
Relations Bd., 330 U. S. 767, 780 (1947) ("Any indulgence in
construction should be in favor of the States, because Congress can speak with drastic clarity whenever it chooses to
assure full federal authority, completely displacing the
States") (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).

The principles of federalism and respect for state sovereignty that underlie the Court's reluctance to find preemption where Congress has not spoken directly to the issue
apply with equal force where Congress has spoken, though
ambiguously. In such cases, the question is not whether
Congress intended to pre-empt state regulation, but to what
extent. We do not, absent unambiguous evidence, infer a
scope of pre-emption beyond that which clearly is mandated
by Congress' language.1 I therefore agree with the Court's
unwillingness to conclude that the state common-law damages claims at issue in this case are pre-empted unless such
result is " `the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.' "
Ante, at 516 (quoting Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331
U. S., at 230).

B

I also agree with the Court's application of the foregoing
principles in Part IV of its opinion, where it concludes that

1 The Court construes congressional inroads on state power narrowly in
other contexts, as well. For example, the Court repeatedly has held that,
in order to waive a State's sovereign immunity from suit in federal court,
Congress must make its intention "unmistakably clear in the language of
the statute." Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 242
(1985); Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U. S. 223, 228 (1989).

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
none of petitioner's common-law damages claims are preempted by the 1965 Act. In my view, the words of $ 5(b) of
that Act ("No statement relating to smoking and health shall
be required in the advertising of any cigarettes the packages
of which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of this
Act") can bear only one meaning: that States are prohibited
merely from "mandating particular cautionary statements
. . . in cigarette advertisements." Ante, at 518. As the
Court recognizes, this interpretation comports with Congress' stated purpose of avoiding " `diverse, nonuniform, and
confusing cigarette labeling and advertising regulations' "
relating to smoking and health. Ante, at 519 (quoting 15
U. S. C. $ 1331(2)). The narrow scope of federal pre-emption
is thus apparent from the statutory text, and it is correspondingly impossible to divine any "clear and manifest purpose" on the part of Congress to pre-empt common-law damages actions.

II

My agreement with the Court ceases at this point. Given
the Court's proper analytical focus on the scope of the express pre-emption provisions at issue here and its acknowledgment that the 1965 Act does not pre-empt state commonlaw damages claims, I find the plurality's conclusion that the
1969 Act pre-empts at least some common-law damages
claims little short of baffling. In my view, the modified language of $ 5(b), 15 U. S. C. $ 1334(b) ("No requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under
State law with respect to the advertising or promotion of
any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of this Act"), no more "clearly" or
"manifestly" exhibits an intent to pre-empt state commonlaw damages actions than did the language of its predecessor
in the 1965 Act. Nonetheless, the plurality reaches a different conclusion, and its reasoning warrants scrutiny.

Opinion of Blackmun, J.

A
The plurality premises its pre-emption ruling on what itterms the "substantial changes" wrought by Congress in

$ 5(b), ante, at 520, notably, the rewording of the provisionto pre-empt any "requirement or prohibition" (as opposed
merely to any "statement") "imposed under State law." Asan initial matter, I do not disagree with the plurality that
the phrase "State law," in an appropriate case, can encom-pass the common law as well as positive enactments such as
statutes and regulations. See ante, at 522-523. I do dis-agree, however, with the plurality's conclusion that "State
law" as used in $ 5(b) represents such an all-inclusive refer-ence. Congress' intention in selecting that phrase cannot
be understood without considering the narrow range ofactions--any "requirement or prohibition"--that Congress
specifically described in $ 5(b) as "imposed under" state law.See

United States v. Morton, 467 U. S. 822, 828 (1984) ("Wedo not . . . construe statutory phrases in isolation; we read

statutes as a whole. Thus, the words [in question] must beread in light of the immediately following phrase" (footnote
omitted)); Jarecki v. G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U. S. 303, 307(1961) ("The maxim noscitur a sociis, that a word is known
by the company it keeps, while not an inescapable rule, isoften wisely applied where a word is capable of many meanings in order to avoid the giving of unintended breadth tothe Acts of Congress"); see also

Norfolk & Western R. Co.v. Train Dispatchers, 499 U. S. 117, 138-139 (1991) (

Stevens, J., dissenting) (declining to read the phrase "all otherlaw, including State and municipal law," broadly).

Although the plurality flatly states that the phrase "norequirement or prohibition" "sweeps broadly" and "easily
encompass[es] obligations that take the form of common-lawrules,"

ante, at 521, those words are in reality far from unam-biguous and cannot be said clearly to evidence a congressional mandate to pre-empt state common-law damages ac-tions. The dictionary definitions of these terms suggest, if

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
anything, specific actions mandated or disallowed by a formalgoverning authority. See,

e. g., Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1929 (1981) (defining "require" as "to askfor authoritatively or imperatively: claim by right and authority" and "to demand as necessary or essential (as on general principles or in order to comply with or satisfy someregulation)"); Black's Law Dictionary 1212 (6th ed. 1990) (defining "prohibition" as an "[a]ct or law prohibiting some-thing"; an "interdiction").

More important, the question whether common-law dam-ages actions exert a regulatory effect on manufacturers analogous to that of positive enactments--an assumption crucial
to the plurality's conclusion that the phrase "requirement or
prohibition" encompasses common-law actions--is significantly more complicated than the plurality's brief quotation
from San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359
U. S. 236, 247 (1959), see ante, at 521, would suggest.

The effect of tort law on a manufacturer's behavior is necessarily indirect. Although an award of damages by its very
nature attaches additional consequences to the manufacturer's continued unlawful conduct, no particular course of action (e. g., the adoption of a new warning label) is required.
A manufacturer found liable on, for example, a failure-towarn claim may respond in a number of ways. It may decide to accept damages awards as a cost of doing business
and not alter its behavior in any way. See Goodyear Atomic
Corp. v. Miller, 486 U. S. 174, 185-186 (1988) (corporation
"may choose to disregard [state] safety regulations and simply pay an additional" damages award if an employee is injured as a result of a safety violation). Or, by contrast, it
may choose to avoid future awards by dispensing warnings
through a variety of alternative mechanisms, such as package inserts, public service advertisements, or general educational programs. The level of choice that a defendant retains in shaping its own behavior distinguishes the indirect
regulatory effect of the common law from positive enact505us2108K 07-16-96 16:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT

ments such as statutes and administrative regulations. SeeDewey v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 121 N. J. 69, 90, 577

A. 2d 1239, 1249 (1990); Garner, Cigarette Dependency andCivil Liability: A Modest Proposal, 53 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1423,
1454 (1980). Moreover, tort law has an entirely separatefunction--compensating victims--that sets it apart from direct forms of regulation. See Ferebee v. Chevron Chemical
Co., 237 U. S. App. D. C. 164, 175, 736 F. 2d 1529, 1540, cert.denied, 469 U. S. 1062 (1984).

Despite its earlier acknowledgment, consistent with theforegoing conception of damages actions, that "there is no
general, inherent conflict between federal pre-emption ofstate warning requirements and the continued vitality of
state common-law damages actions," ante, at 518,2 the plu-rality apparently finds Garmon's statement that "regulation
can be as effectively exerted through an award of damages
as through some form of preventive relief," 359 U. S., at 247,sufficient authority to warrant extinguishing the commonlaw actions at issue in this case. See ante, at 521. I am notpersuaded. Not only has the Court previously distinguished
Garmon,3 but it has declined on several recent occasions tofind the regulatory effects of state tort law direct or substantial enough to warrant pre-emption.In

Goodyear Atomic Corp. v. Miller, for example, the
Court distinguished, for purposes of pre-emption analysis,

2 Congress, in fact, has expressly allowed common-law damages actions
to survive while pre-empting other, more direct forms of state regulation.
See, e. g., Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of
1986, $ 7, 100 Stat. 34, 15 U. S. C. $ 4406; Occupational Safety and Health
Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 1590, 29 U. S. C. $ 651 et seq., as construed in Gade v.
National Solid Wastes Management Assn., ante, p. 88.

3 The Court has explained that Garmon, in which a state common-law

damages award was found to be pre-empted by the National Labor Relations Act, involved a special "presumption of federal pre-emption" relating
to the primary jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board. See
Brown v. Hotel Employees, 468 U. S. 491, 502 (1984); English v. General

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
"direct state regulation" of safety matters from "the incidental regulatory effects" of damages awarded pursuant to a
state workers' compensation law. 486 U. S., at 185. Relying in part on its earlier decision in Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee
Corp., 464 U. S. 238, 256 (1984),4 the Court stated that "Congress may reasonably determine that incidental regulatory
pressure is acceptable, whereas direct regulatory authority
is not." 486 U. S., at 186. Even more recently, the Court
declined in English v. General Electric Co., 496 U. S., at 86,
to find state common-law damages claims for emotional distress pre-empted by federal nuclear energy law. The Court
concluded that, although awards to former employees for
emotional distress would attach "additional consequences" to
retaliatory employer conduct and could lead employers to
alter the underlying conditions about which employees were
complaining, ibid., such an effect would be "neither direct
nor substantial enough" to warrant pre-emption. Id., at 85.

In light of the recognized distinction in this Court's jurisprudence between direct state regulation and the indirect
regulatory effects of common-law damages actions, it cannot
be said that damages claims are clearly or unambiguously
"requirements" or "prohibitions" imposed under state law.

4 The Court in Silkwood declined to find state punitive damages awards
pre-empted by federal nuclear safety laws, explaining: "It may be that the
award of damages based on the state law of negligence or strict liability
is regulatory in the sense that a nuclear plant will be threatened with
damages liability if it does not conform to state standards, but that regulatory consequence was something that Congress was quite willing to accept." 464 U. S., at 256. Although the Court has noted that the decision
in Silkwood was based in "substantial part" on affirmative evidence in
the legislative history suggesting that Congress did not intend to include
common-law damages remedies within the pre-empted field, see English
v. General Electric Co., 496 U. S. 72, 86 (1990), Silkwood's discussion of
the regulatory effects of the common law is instructive and has been relied
on in subsequent cases. See, e. g., Goodyear, 486 U. S., at 186.

The plain language of the 1969 Act's modified pre-emption
provision simply cannot bear the broad interpretation the
plurality would impart to it.

B
Not only does the text of the revised $ 5(b) fail clearly or
manifestly to require pre-emption of state common-law damages actions, but there is no suggestion in the legislative
history that Congress intended to expand the scope of the
pre-emption provision when it amended the statute in 1969.
The plurality acknowledges the evidence that Congress itself
perceived the changes in $ 5(b) to be a mere " `clarifi[cation]' "
of the existing narrow pre-emption provision, ante, at 520
(quoting S. Rep. No. 91-566, p. 12 (1969) (hereinafter
S. Rep.)), but it dismisses these statements of legislative
intent as the " `views of a subsequent Congress.' " Ante, at
520 (quoting United States v. Price, 361 U. S. 304, 313
(1960)). The plurality is wrong not only as a factual matter--for the statements of the Congress that amended $ 5(b)
are contemporaneous, not "subsequent," to enactment of the
revised pre-emption provision--but as a legal matter, as
well. This Court accords "great weight" to an amending
Congress' interpretation of the underlying statute. See,
e. g., Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367,
380-381, and n. 8 (1969).

Viewing the revisions to $ 5(b) as generally nonsubstantive
in nature makes sense. By replacing the word "statement"
with the slightly broader term, "requirement," and adding
the word "prohibition" to ensure that a State could not do
through negative mandate (e. g., banning all cigarette advertising) that which it already was forbidden to do through
positive mandate (e. g., mandating particular cautionary
statements), Congress sought to "clarif[y]" the existing pre505us2108K 07-16-96 16:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT

cautions against confusing and nonuniform state laws andregulations. S. Rep., at 12.

Just as it acknowledges the evidence that Congress'changes in the pre-emption provision were nonsubstantive,

the plurality admits that "portions of the legislative historyof the 1969 Act suggest that Congress was primarily concerned with positive enactments by States and localities."
Ante, at 521. Indeed, the relevant Senate Report explainsthat the revised pre-emption provision is "intended to include not only action by State statute but by all other admin-istrative actions or local ordinances or regulations by any
political subdivisions of any State," a list remarkable for theabsence of any reference to common-law damages actions.
S. Rep., at 12. Cf., e. g., 29 U. S. C. $$ 1144(a) and (c)(1)(ERISA statute defines "any and all State laws" as used in
pre-emption provision to mean "all laws, decisions, rules,regulations, or

other State action having the effect of law")(emphasis added). The plurality dismisses this statement

with the simple observation that "the language of the Actplainly reaches beyond such [positive] enactments."

Ante,at 521. Yet, as discussed above, the words of $ 5(b) ("requirement or prohibition") do not so "plainly" extend tocommon-law damages actions, and the plurality errs in placing so much weight on this fragile textual hook.The plurality further acknowledges that, at the same time
that Congress amended the pre-emption provision of $ 5(b),it made no effort to alter the statement of purpose contained
in $ 2 of the 1965 Act. Ante, at 521, n. 19. Although the

5 In the one reported case construing the scope of pre-emption under
the 1965 Act, Banzhaf v. FCC--a case of which Congress was aware, see
S. Rep., at 7--the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
used the term "affirmative requirements" to describe $ 5(b)'s ban on "statement[s]." 132 U. S. App. D. C. 14, 22, 405 F. 2d 1082, 1090 (1968), cert.

but a small step from "affirmative requirement" to the converse, "negative
requirement" ("prohibition"), and, from there, to the single explanatory
phrase, "requirement or prohibition."

plurality relegates this fact to a footnote, the continued vital-ity of $ 2 is significant, particularly in light of the Court's

reliance on the same statement of purpose for its earlier con-clusion that the 1965 Act does

not pre-empt state commonlaw damages actions. See ante, at 519 (concluding that Congress' expressed intent to avoid diverse, nonuniform, andconfusing regulations "most naturally refers to positive enactments by [state legislatures and federal agencies], not tocommon-law damages actions").

Finally, there is absolutely no suggestion in the legislativehistory that Congress intended to leave plaintiffs who were
injured as a result of cigarette manufacturers' unlawful conduct without any alternative remedies; yet that is the regrettable effect of the ruling today that many state common-law
damages claims are pre-empted. The Court in the past has
hesitated to find pre-emption where federal law provides no
comparable remedy. See Rabin, A Sociolegal History of the
Tobacco Tort Litigation, 44 Stan. L. Rev. 853, 869 (1992) (noting the "rather strong tradition of federal deference to competing state interests in compensating injury victims"). Indeed, in Silkwood, the Court took note of "Congress' failure
to provide any federal remedy" for injured persons, and
stated that it was "difficult to believe that Congress would,
without comment, remove all means of judicial recourse for
those injured by illegal conduct." 464 U. S., at 251. See
also id., at 263 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) ("[I]t is inconceivable that Congress intended to leave victims with no remedy
at all").

Unlike other federal statutes where Congress has eased
the bite of pre-emption by establishing "comprehensive" civil
enforcement schemes, see, e. g., Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U. S. 133, 144-145 (1990) (discussing $ 502(a) of
ERISA), the Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act is barren of alternative remedies. The Act merely empowers the
Federal Trade Commission to regulate unfair or deceptive
advertising practices (15 U. S. C. $ 1336), establishes minimal

criminal penalties (misdemeanor and fine not to exceed$10,000) for violations of the Act's provisions ($ 1338), and

authorizes federal courts, upon the Government's applica-tion, to enjoin violations of the Act ($ 1339). Unlike the plurality, I am unwilling to believe that Congress, without anymention of state common-law damages actions or of its intention dramatically to expand the scope of federal pre-emption,would have eliminated the only means of judicial recourse for
those injured by cigarette manufacturers' unlawful conduct.Thus, not only does the plain language of the 1969 Act fail
clearly to require pre-emption of petitioner's state common-law damages claims, but there is no suggestion in the legislative history that Congress intended to expand the scope ofthe pre-emption provision in the drastic manner that the plurality attributes to it. Our obligation to infer pre-emptiononly where Congress' intent is clear and manifest mandates
the conclusion that state common-law damages actions arenot pre-empted by the 1969 Act.

III
Stepping back from the specifics of the plurality's pre-emption analysis to view the result the plurality ultimately

reaches, I am further disturbed. Notwithstanding theCourt's ready acknowledgment that " ` "[t]he purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone" ' of pre-emption analysis,"ante, at 516 (quoting Malone v. White Motor Corp., 435 U. S.
497, 504 (1978)), the plurality proceeds to create a crazy quilt

6 Every Court of Appeals to consider the question, including the Third
Circuit in an earlier opinion in this case, similarly has concluded that state
common-law damages claims are not expressly pre-empted under the 1969
Act. See, e. g., Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 789 F. 2d 181, 185-186
(CA3 1986), cert. denied, 479 U. S. 1043 (1987); Pennington v. Vistron

Co., 849 F. 2d 230, 234 (CA6 1988); Palmer v. Liggett Group, Inc., 825 F. 2d
620, 625 (CA1 1987). See also Dewey v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 121

of pre-emption from among the common-law claims impli-cated in this case, and in so doing reaches a result that Congress surely could not have intended.The most obvious problem with the plurality's analysis is
its frequent shift in the level of generality at which it examines the individual claims. For example, the plurality statesthat fraudulent-misrepresentation claims (at least those involving false statements of material fact in advertisements)are "predicated not on a duty `based on smoking and health'
but rather on a more general obligation--the duty not todeceive," and therefore are not pre-empted by $ 5(b) of the
1969 Act. Ante, at 528-529. Yet failure-to-warn claims--
which could just as easily be described as based on a "more
general obligation" to inform consumers of known risks--
implicitly are found to be "based on smoking and health" and
are declared pre-empted. See ante, at 524. The plurality
goes on to hold that express warranty claims are not preempted because the duty at issue is undertaken by the manufacturer and is not "imposed under State law." Ante, at 525.
Yet, as the plurality itself must acknowledge, "the general
duty not to breach warranties arises under state law," ibid.
(emphasis added); absent the State's decision to penalize
such behavior through the creation of a common-law damages action, no warranty claim would exist.

In short, I can perceive no principled basis for many of
the plurality's asserted distinctions among the common-law
claims, and I cannot believe that Congress intended to create
such a hodgepodge of allowed and disallowed claims when it
amended the pre-emption provision in 1970. Although the
plurality acknowledges that $ 5(b) fails to "indicate that any
familiar subdivision of common-law claims is or is not preempted," ante, at 523, it ignores the simplest and most obvious explanation for the statutory silence: that Congress
never intended to displace state common-law damages
claims, much less to cull through them in the manner the
plurality does today. I can only speculate as to the difficulty

lower courts will encounter in attempting to implement
today's decision.

IV

By finding federal pre-emption of certain state commonlaw damages claims, the decision today eliminates a critical
component of the States' traditional ability to protect the
health and safety of their citizens. Yet such a radical readjustment of federal-state relations is warranted under this
Court's precedents only if there is clear evidence that Congress intended that result. Because I believe that neither
version of the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising
Act evidences such a clear congressional intent to pre-empt
state common-law damages actions, I respectfully dissent
from Parts V and VI of Justice Stevens' opinion.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.

Today's decision announces what, on its face, is an extraordinary and unprecedented principle of federal statutory
construction: that express pre-emption provisions must be
construed narrowly, "in light of the presumption against the
pre-emption of state police power regulations." Ante, at
518. The life span of this new rule may have been blessedly
brief, inasmuch as the opinion that gives it birth in Part I
proceeds to ignore it in Part V, by adjudging at least some
of the common-law tort claims at issue here pre-empted. In
my view, there is no merit to this newly crafted doctrine
of narrow construction. Under the Supremacy Clause, U. S.
Const., Art. VI, cl. 2, our job is to interpret Congress's
decrees of pre-emption neither narrowly nor broadly, but in
accordance with their apparent meaning. If we did that job
in the present case, we would find, under the 1965 Act, preemption of petitioner's failure-to-warn claims; and under the
1969 Act, we would find pre-emption of petitioner's claims
complete.

The Court's threshold description of the law of pre-emption is accurate enough: Though we generally " `assum[e]

that the historic police powers of the States [are] not to besuperseded by . . . Federal Act unless that [is] the clear and
manifest purpose of Congress,' " ante, at 516 (quoting Rice v.
Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947)), we havetraditionally not thought that to require express statutory

text. Where state law is in actual conflict with federal law,see,

e. g., Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy ResourcesConservation and Development Comm'n, 461 U. S. 190, 204

(1983), or where it "stands as an obstacle to the accomplish-ment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of
Congress," Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941), oreven where the nature of Congress's regulation, or its scope,
convinces us that "Congress left no room for the States tosupplement it,"

Rice, supra, at 230, we have had no difficultydeclaring that state law must yield. The ultimate question

in each case, as we have framed the inquiry, is one of Con-gress's intent, as revealed by the text, structure, purposes,
and subject matter of the statutes involved. See, e. g., Eng-lish v. General Electric Co., 496 U. S. 72, 78-79 (1990); Shaw
v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S. 85, 95 (1983).The Court goes beyond these traditional principles, however, to announce two new ones. First, it says that expresspre-emption provisions must be given the narrowest possible
construction. This is in its view the consequence of ouroft-repeated assumption that, absent convincing evidence of
statutory intent to pre-empt, " `the historic police powers ofthe States [are] not to be superseded,' " see

ante, at 516.But it seems to me that assumption dissolves once there is

conclusive evidence of intent to pre-empt in the expresswords of the statute itself, and the only remaining question
is what the scope of that pre-emption is meant to be. There-upon, I think, our responsibility is to apply to the text ordinary principles of statutory construction.

That is precisely what our express pre-emption cases havedone. Less than a month ago, in

Morales v. Trans World
Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374 (1992), we held that the AirlineDeregulation Act's provision pre-empting state laws "relating to [airline] rates, routes, or services," 49 U. S. C. App.

$ 1305(a)(1), was broad enough to reach state fare advertisingregulations despite the availability of plausible limiting constructions. We made no mention of any "plain-statement"rule, or rule of narrow construction, but applied the usual
" ` "assumption that the ordinary meaning of [the statutory] language accurately expresses the legislative purpose." ' " Morales, supra, at 383 (quoting FMC Corp. v.
Holliday, 498 U. S. 52, 57 (1990)) (emphasis added). And
last Term, in Norfolk & Western R. Co. v. Train Dispatchers,
499 U. S. 117 (1991), we interpreted an express pre-emption
provision broadly despite the fact that a well-respected
canon of statutory construction supported a narrower reading. See id., at 129; id., at 136 (Stevens, J., dissenting).
We said not a word about a "presumption against . . . preemption," ante, at 518, that was to be applied to construction
of the text.

In light of our willingness to find pre-emption in the absence of any explicit statement of pre-emptive intent, the
notion that such explicit statements, where they exist, are
subject to a "plain-statement" rule is more than somewhat
odd. To be sure, our jurisprudence abounds with rules of
"plain statement," "clear statement," and "narrow construction" designed variously to ensure that, absent unambiguous
evidence of Congress's intent, extraordinary constitutional
powers are not invoked, or important constitutional protections eliminated, or seemingly inequitable doctrines applied.
See, e. g., United States v. Mitchell, 445 U. S. 535, 538 (1980)
(waivers of federal sovereign immunity must be "unequivocally expressed"); Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police,
491 U. S. 58, 65 (1989) (clear statement required to compel
States to entertain damages suits against themselves in state

courts); Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234,243 (1985) (abrogation of state sovereign immunity must be

expressed "in unmistakable language"). But none of thoserules exists alongside a doctrine whereby the same result so
prophylactically protected from careless explicit provision
can be achieved by sheer implication, with no express state-ment of intent at all. That is the novel regime the Court

constructs today.The results seem odder still when one takes into account
the second new rule that the Court announces: "When Con-gress has considered the issue of pre-emption and has included in the enacted legislation a provision explicitly addressing that issue, . . . we need only identify the domain
expressly pre-empted by [that provision]." Ante, at 517.
Once there is an express pre-emption provision, in other
words, all doctrines of implied pre-emption are eliminated.
This proposition may be correct insofar as implied "field"
pre-emption is concerned: The existence of an express preemption provision tends to contradict any inference that
Congress intended to occupy a field broader than the statute's express language defines. However, with regard to
implied "conflict" pre-emption--i. e., where state regulation
actually conflicts with federal law, or where state regulation
"stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution"
of Congress's purposes, Hines, supra, at 67--the Court's second new rule works mischief. If taken seriously, it would
mean, for example, that if a federal consumer protection law
provided that no state agency or court shall assert jurisdiction under state law over any workplace safety issue with
respect to which a federal standard is in effect, then a state
agency operating under a law dealing with a subject other
than workplace safety (e. g., consumer protection) could impose requirements entirely contrary to federal law--forbidding, for example, the use of certain safety equipment that
federal law requires. To my knowledge, we have never expressed such a rule before, and our prior cases are inconsist505us2108K 07-16-96 16:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT

ent with it. See, e. g., Jones v. Rath Packing Co., 430 U. S.519, 540-543 (1977). When this second novelty is combined

with the first, the result is extraordinary: The statute thatsays anything about pre-emption must say everything; and
it must do so with great exactitude, as any ambiguity con-cerning its scope will be read in favor of preserving state
power. If this is to be the law, surely only the most sportingof Congresses will dare to say anything about pre-emption.

The proper rule of construction for express pre-emptionprovisions is, it seems to me, the one that is customary for
statutory provisions in general: Their language should begiven its ordinary meaning.

FMC Corp. v. Holliday, supra,at 57;
Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, 463 U. S., at 97. When thissuggests that the pre-emption provision was intended to

sweep broadly, our construction must sweep broadly as well.See, e. g., id., at 96-97. And when it bespeaks a narrow
scope of pre-emption, so must our judgment. See, e. g., FortHalifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U. S. 1, 7-8 (1987). Applying its niggardly rule of construction, the Court finds (notsurprisingly) that none of petitioner's claims--common-law
failure to warn, breach of express warranty, and intentionalfraud and misrepresentation--is pre-empted under $ 5(b) of
the 1965 Act. And save for the failure-to-warn claims, theCourt reaches the same result under $ 5(b) of the 1969 Act.
I think most of that is error. Applying ordinary principlesof statutory construction, I believe petitioner's failure-towarn claims are pre-empted by the 1965 Act, and all hiscommon-law claims by the 1969 Act.

II
With much of what the plurality says in Part V of its opin-ion I agree--that "the language of the [1969] Act plainly

reaches beyond [positive] enactments," ante, at 521; that thegeneral tort-law duties petitioner invokes against the cigarette companies can, as a general matter, impose "require-ment[s] or prohibition[s]" within the meaning of $ 5(b) of the

1969 Act, ibid.; and that the phrase "State law" as used inthat provision embraces state common law, ante, at 523. I

take issue with the plurality, however, on its applicationof these general principles to the present case. Its finding
that they produce only partial pre-emption of petitioner'scommon-law claims rests upon three misperceptions that I
shall discuss in turn, under headings indicating the errone-ously permitted claims to which they apply.

A
Pre-1969 Failure-to-Warn Claims

According to the Court,1 $ 5(b) of the 1965 Act "is best readas having superseded only positive enactments by legislatures or administrative agencies that mandate particularwarning labels." Ante, at 518-519 (emphasis added). In
essence, the Court reads $ 5(b)'s critical language "No state-ment relating to smoking and health . . . shall be required"
to mean "No particular statement relating to smoking andhealth shall be required." The Court reasons that because
common-law duties do not require cigarette manufacturersto include any

particular statement in their advertising, butonly some statement warning of health risks, those duties

survive the 1965 Act. I see no basis for this element of"particularity." To require a warning about cigarette health
risks is to require a "statement relating to smoking andhealth." If the "presumption against . . . pre-emption,"
ante, at 518, requires us to import limiting language into the1965 Act, I do not see why it does not require us to import
similarly limiting language into the 1969 Act--so that a "re-quirement . . . based on smoking and health . . . with respect
to advertising" means only a specific requirement, and notjust general, noncigarette-specific duties imposed by tort
law. The divergent treatment of the 1965 Act cannot be jus1 The plurality is joined by Justices Blackmun, Kennedy, and Souter in its analysis of the 1965 Act.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
tified by the Act's statement of purposes, which, as the Courtnotes, expresses concern with "diverse, nonuniform, and

confusing cigarette labeling and advertising regulations."15 U. S. C. $ 1331(2) (emphasis added). That statement of
purposes was left untouched by Congress in 1969, and thusshould be as restrictive of the scope of the later $ 5(b) as the
Court believes it is of the scope of the earlier one.2To the extent petitioner's claims are premised specifically
on respondents' failure (during the period in which the 1965Act was in force) to include in their

advertising any state-ment relating to smoking and health, I would find those

claims, no less than the similar post-1969 claims, pre-empted.In addition, for reasons I shall later explain, see Part III,
infra, I would find pre-emption even of those claims basedon respondents' failure to make health-related statements to
consumers outside their advertising. However, since $ 5(b)of the 1965 Act enjoins only those laws that

require "state-ment[s]" in cigarette advertising, those of petitioner's claims

that, if accepted, would penalize statements voluntarilymade by the cigarette companies must be deemed to survive.
As these would appear to include petitioner's breach-of-express-warranty and intentional fraud and misrepresentation claims, I concur in the Court's judgment in this respect.

2 The Court apparently thinks that because $ 4 of the Act, imposing the
federal package-labeling requirement, "itself sets forth a particular statement," ante, at 519, n. 16, $ 5(b), the advertising pre-emption provision
must be read to proscribe only those state laws that compel the use of
particular statements in advertising. Besides being a complete non sequitur, this reasoning proves too much: The similar prescription of a particular warning in the 1969 Act would likewise require us to confine the
pre-emptive scope of that later statute to specific, prescriptive "requirement[s] or prohibition[s]" (which, I presume, would not include tort-law
obligations to warn consumers about product dangers). And under both
the 1965 and 1969 versions of the Act, the package-labeling pre-emption
provision of $ 5(a), no less than the advertising pre-emption provision of

$ 5(b), would have to be limited to the prescription of particular language,
leaving the States free to impose general health-labeling requirements.
These results are obviously contrary to the Act's stated purposes.

B
Post-1969 Breach-of-Express-Warranty Claims

In the context of this case, petitioner's breach-of-expresswarranty claim necessarily embodies an assertion that respondents' advertising and promotional materials made
statements to the effect that cigarette smoking is not unhealthy. Making such statements civilly actionable certainly constitutes an advertising "requirement or prohibition
. . . based on smoking and health." The plurality appears
to accept this, but finds that liability for breach of express
warranty is not "imposed under State law" within the meaning of $ 5(b) of the 1969 Act. "[R]ather," it says, the duty "is
best understood as undertaken by the manufacturer itself."
Ante, at 526. I cannot agree.

When liability attaches to a particular promise or representation, it attaches by law. For the making of a voluntary
promise or representation, no less than for the commission
of an intentional tort, it is the background law against which
the act occurs, and not the act itself, that supplies the element of legal obligation. See Home Building & Loan Assn.
v. Blaisdell, 290 U. S. 398, 429 (1934); N. J. Stat. Ann.

$$ 12A:2-313(1), 12A:2-714, and 12A:2-715 (West 1962) (providing for enforcement of express warranties). Of course,
New Jersey's law of express warranty attaches legal consequences to the cigarette manufacturer's voluntary conduct in
making the warranty, and in that narrow sense, I suppose,
the warranty obligation can be said to be "undertaken by the
manufacturer." But on that logic it could also be said that
the duty to warn about the dangers of cigarettes is undertaken voluntarily by manufacturers when they choose to sell
in New Jersey; or, more generally, that any legal duty imposed on volitional behavior is not one imposed by law.

The plurality cites no authority for its curious view, which
is reason enough to doubt it. In addition, however, we rejected this very argument last Term in Norfolk & Western

R. Co. v. Train Dispatchers, where we construed a federalexemption "from the antitrust laws and from all other law,"

49 U. S. C. $ 11341(a), to include an exemption from contractobligations. We observed, in a passage flatly inconsistent
with the plurality's analysis today, that "[a] contract has nolegal force

apart from the law that acknowledges its bindingcharacter." 499 U. S., at 130. Cf. id., at 139 (

Stevens, J.,dissenting). I would find petitioner's claim for breach of

express warranty pre-empted by $ 5(b) of the 1969 Act.

C
Post-1969 Fraud and Misrepresentation Claims

According to the plurality, at least one of petitioner's in-tentional fraud and misrepresentation claims survives $ 5(b)

of the 1969 Act because the common-law duty underlyingthat claim is not "based on smoking and health" within the
meaning of the Act. See ante, at 528-529. If I understandthe plurality's reasoning, it proceeds from the implicit
assumption that only duties deriving from laws that arespecifically directed to "smoking and health," or that are
uniquely crafted to address the relationship between ciga-rette companies and their putative victims, fall within $ 5(b)
of the Act, as amended. Given that New Jersey's tort-law"duty not to deceive,"

ante, at 529, is a general one, applica-ble to all commercial actors and all kinds of commerce, it

follows from this assumption that $ 5(b) does not pre-emptclaims based on breaches of that duty.

This analysis is suspect, to begin with, because the plural-ity is unwilling to apply it consistently. As

Justice Blackmun cogently explains, see ante, at 543 (opinion concurringin part and dissenting in part), if New Jersey's common-law

duty to avoid false statements of material fact--as appliedto the cigarette companies' behavior--is not "based on smoking and health," the same must be said of New Jersey'scommon-law duty to warn about a product's dangers.

Eachduty transcends the relationship between the cigarette com505us2108K 07-16-96 16:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Scalia, J.
panies and cigarette smokers; neither duty was specificallycrafted with an eye toward "smoking and health." None of

the arguments the plurality advances to support its distinc-tion between the two is persuasive. That Congress specifically preserved, in both the 1965 and 1969 Acts, the Federal
Trade Commission's authority to police deceptive advertisingpractices, see $ 5(c) of the 1965 Act; $ 7(b) of the 1969 Act;

ante, at 529, does not suggest that Congress intended compa-rable state authority to survive $ 5(b). In fact, at least in
the 1965 Act (which generally excluded federal as well asstate regulation), the exemption suggested that $ 5(b) was
broad enough to reach laws governing fraud and misrepresentation. And it is not true that the States' laws governing
fraud and misrepresentation in advertising impose identical
legal standards, whereas their laws "concerning the warning
necessary to render a product `reasonably safe' " are quite
diverse, ibid. The question whether an ad featuring a glamorous, youthful smoker with pearly-white teeth is "misrepresentative" would almost certainly be answered differently
from State to State. See ante, at 527 (discussing FTC's initial cigarette advertising rules).

Once one is forced to select a consistent methodology for
evaluating whether a given legal duty is "based on smoking
and health," it becomes obvious that the methodology must
focus not upon the ultimate source of the duty (e. g., the common law) but upon its proximate application. Use of the
"ultimate source" approach (i. e., a legal duty is not "based
on smoking and health" unless the law from which it derives
is directed only to smoking and health) would gut the statute, inviting the very "diverse, nonuniform, and confusing
cigarette . . . advertising regulations" Congress sought to
avoid. 15 U. S. C. $ 1331(2). And the problem is not simply
the common law: Requirements could be imposed by state
executive agencies as well, so long as they were operating
under a general statute authorizing their supervision of
"commercial advertising" or "unfair trade practices." New

Opinion of Scalia, J.
Jersey and many other States have such statutes already on
the books. E. g., N. J. Stat. Ann. $ 56:8-1 et seq. (West 1989);
N. Y. Gen. Bus. Law $ 349 et seq. (McKinney 1988 and Supp.
1992); Texas Bus. & Com. Code Ann. $ 17.01 et seq. (1987 and
Supp. 1992).

I would apply to all petitioner's claims what I have called
a "proximate application" methodology for determining
whether they invoke duties "based on smoking and health"--
I would ask, that is, whether, whatever the source of the
duty, it imposes an obligation in this case because of the
effect of smoking upon health. On that basis, I would find
petitioner's failure-to-warn and misrepresentation claims
both pre-empted.

III

Finally, there is an additional flaw in the plurality's opinion, a systemic one that infects even its otherwise correct
disposition of petitioner's post-1969 failure-to-warn claims.
The opinion states that, since $ 5(b) proscribes only "requirement[s] or prohibition[s] . . . `with respect to . . . advertising
or promotion,' " state-law claims premised on the failure to
warn consumers "through channels of communication other
than advertising or promotion" are not covered. Ante, at
528 (emphasis added); see ante, at 524. This preserves not
only the (somewhat fanciful) claims based on duties having
no relation to the advertising and promotion (one could imagine a law requiring manufacturers to disclose the health hazards of their products to a state public-health agency), but
also claims based on duties that can be complied with by
taking action either within the advertising and promotional
realm or elsewhere. Thus, if--as appears to be the case in
New Jersey--a State's common law requires manufacturers
to advise consumers of their products' dangers, but the law
is indifferent as to how that requirement is met (i. e., through
"advertising or promotion" or otherwise), the plurality
would apparently be unprepared to find pre-emption as long

555Cite as: 505 U. S. 504 (1992)
Opinion of Scalia, J.
as the jury were instructed not to zero in on deficiencies inthe manufacturers' advertising or promotion.

I think that is inconsistent with the law of pre-emption.Advertising and promotion are the normal means by which
a manufacturer communicates required product warnings toprospective customers, and by far the most economical
means. It is implausible that Congress meant to save ciga-rette companies from being compelled to convey such data
to consumers through that means, only to allow them to becompelled to do so through means more onerous still. As
a practical matter, such a "tell-the-consumers-any-way-you-wish" law compels manufacturers to relinquish the advertising and promotion immunity accorded them by the Act. Thetest for pre-emption in this setting should be one of practical
compulsion, i. e., whether the law practically compels themanufacturers to engage in behavior that Congress has
barred the States from prescribing directly. Cf., e. g., Rayv. Atlantic Richfield Co., 435 U. S. 151, 173, n. 25 (1978).
Though the hypothetical law requiring disclosure to a stateregulatory agency would seem to survive this test, I would
have no difficulty finding that test met with respect to statelaws that require the cigarette companies to meet general
standards of "fair warning" regarding smoking and health.

CITY OF BURLINGTON v. DAGUE et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 91-810. Argued April 21, 1992--Decided June 24, 1992
After ruling on the merits for respondents, the District Court determined

that they were "substantially prevailing" parties entitled to "reasonable" attorney's fees under the attorney's fee provisions of the Solid
Waste Disposal Act and the Clean Water Act. The District Court calculated the fee award by, inter alia, enhancing the "lodestar" amount
by 25% on the grounds that respondents' attorneys were retained on a
contingent-fee basis and that without such enhancement respondents
would have faced substantial difficulties in obtaining suitable counsel.
The Court of Appeals affirmed the fee award.

Held: The fee-shifting statutes at issue do not permit enhancement of a

fee award beyond the lodestar amount to reflect the fact that a party's
attorneys were retained on a contingent-fee basis. In Pennsylvania v.
Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air, 483 U. S. 711 (Delaware Valley II), this Court addressed, but did not resolve, a question
essentially identical to the one presented here. The position taken by
the principal opinion in that case, id., at 723-727 (opinion of White, J.)--
that the typical federal fee-shifting statute does not permit an attorney's fee award to be enhanced on account of contingency--is adopted.
The position advocated by Delaware Valley II's concurrence, id., at 731,
733 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)--
that contingency enhancement is appropriate in defined limited circumstances--is rejected, since it is based upon propositions that are mutually inconsistent as a practical matter; would make enhancement turn
upon a circular test for a very large proportion of contingency-fee cases;
and could not possibly achieve its supposed goal of mirroring market
incentives to attorneys to take cases. Beyond that approach, there is
no other basis, fairly derivable from the fee-shifting statutes, by which
contingency enhancement, if adopted, could be restricted to fewer than
all contingent-fee cases. Moreover, contingency enhancement is not
compatible with the fee-shifting statutes at issue, since such enhancement would in effect pay for the attorney's time (or anticipated time) in
cases where his client does not prevail; is unnecessary to the determination of a reasonable fee and inconsistent with this Court's general rejection of the contingent-fee model in favor of the lodestar model, see, e. g.,
Blanchard v. Bergeron, 489 U. S. 87, 96; and would make the setting of

Opinion of the Court
Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents the question whether a court, in determining an award of reasonable attorney's fees under $ 7002(e)
of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA), 90 Stat. 2826, as
amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 6972(e), or $ 505(d) of the Federal Water
Pollution Control Act (Clean Water Act (CWA)), 86 Stat. 889,
as amended, 33 U. S. C. $ 1365(d), may enhance the fee award
above the "lodestar" amount in order to reflect the fact that
the party's attorneys were retained on a contingent-fee basis
and thus assumed the risk of receiving no payment at all for
their services. Although different fee-shifting statutes are
involved, the question is essentially identical to the one we
addressed, but did not resolve, in Pennsylvania v. Delaware
Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air, 483 U. S. 711 (1987)
(Delaware Valley II).

I

Respondent Ernest Dague, Sr. (whom we will refer to in
place of all the respondents), owns land in Vermont adjacent
to a landfill that was owned and operated by petitioner city
of Burlington. Represented by attorneys retained on a
contingent-fee basis, he sued Burlington over its operation
of the landfill. The District Court ruled, inter alia, that
Burlington had violated provisions of the SWDA and the
CWA, and ordered Burlington to close the landfill by January
1, 1990. It also determined that Dague was a "substantially
prevailing party" entitled to an award of attorney's fees
under the Acts, see 42 U. S. C. $ 6972(e); 33 U. S. C. $ 1365(d).
732 F. Supp. 458 (Vt. 1989).

In calculating the attorney's fees award, the District Court
first found reasonable the figures advanced by Dague for his
attorneys' hourly rates and for the number of hours expended by them, producing a resulting "lodestar" attorney's
fee of $198,027.50. (What our cases have termed the "lodestar" is "the product of reasonable hours times a reasonable
rate," Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council

560 BURLINGTON v. DAGUE

Opinion of the Court
for Clean Air, 478 U. S. 546, 565 (1986) (Delaware Valley I).)Addressing Dague's request for a contingency enhancement,

the court looked to Circuit precedent, which provided that" `the rationale that should guide the court's discretion is
whether "[w]ithout the possibility of a fee enhancement . . .competent counsel might refuse to represent [environmental] clients thereby denying them effective access to thecourts." ' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 131-132 (quoting

Friendsof the Earth v. Eastman Kodak Co., 834 F. 2d 295, 298 (CA2

1987), in turn quoting Lewis v. Coughlin, 801 F. 2d 570, 576(CA2 1986)). Following this guidance, the court declared
that Dague's "risk of not prevailing was substantial" and that"absent an opportunity for enhancement, [Dague] would
have faced substantial difficulty in obtaining counsel of rea-sonable skill and competence in this complicated field of law."
It concluded that "a 25% enhancement is appropriate, butanything more would be a windfall to the attorneys." It
therefore enhanced the lodestar amount by 25%--$49,506.87.App. to Pet. for Cert. 133, 134.

The Court of Appeals affirmed in all respects. Reviewingthe various opinions in Delaware Valley II, the court concluded that the issue whether and when a contingency en-hancement is warranted remained open, and expressly disagreed with the position taken by some Courts of Appealsthat the concurrence in Delaware Valley II was controlling.
The court stated that the District Court had correctly reliedon Circuit precedent, and, holding that the District Court's
findings were not clearly erroneous, it upheld the 25% contin-gency enhancement. 935 F. 2d 1343, 1359-1360 (CA2 1991).
We granted certiorari only with respect to the propriety ofthe contingency enhancement. 502 U. S. 1071 (1992).

II
We first provide some background to the issue before us.Fees for legal services in litigation may be either "certain"

or "contingent" (or some hybrid of the two). A fee is certain

Opinion of the Court
if it is payable without regard to the outcome of the suit;it is contingent if the obligation to pay depends on a particular result's being obtained. Under the most commoncontingent-fee contract for litigation, the attorney receives
no payment for his services if his client loses. Under thisarrangement, the attorney bears a contingent risk of nonpayment that is the inverse of the case's prospects of success: ifhis client has an 80% chance of winning, the attorney's contingent risk is 20%.In

Delaware Valley II, we reversed a judgment that hadaffirmed enhancement of a fee award to reflect the contingent risk of nonpayment. In the process, we addressedwhether the typical federal fee-shifting statute (there,

$ 304(d) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U. S. C. $ 7604(d)) permitsan attorney's fees award to be enhanced on account of contingency. In the principal opinion, Justice White, joinedon this point by three other Justices, determined that such
enhancement is not permitted. 483 U. S., at 723-727. Justice O'Connor, in an opinion concurring in part and concur-ring in the judgment, concluded that no enhancement for

contingency is appropriate "unless the applicant can estab-lish that without an adjustment for risk the prevailing party
would have faced substantial difficulties in finding counselin the local or other relevant market,"

id., at 733 (internalquotation marks omitted), and that any enhancement "must

be based on the difference in market treatment of contingentfee cases

as a class, rather than on an assessment of the`riskiness' of any particular case," id., at 731 (emphasis in

original). Justice Blackmun's dissenting opinion, joinedby three other Justices, concluded that enhancement for contingency is always statutorily required. Id., at 737-742, 754.We turn again to this same issue.

U. S. C. $ 1365(d) (emphasis added). This language is similarto that of many other federal fee-shifting statutes, see,

e. g.,
42 U. S. C. $$ 1988, 2000e-5(k), 7604(d); our case law construing what is a "reasonable" fee applies uniformly to all ofthem.

Flight Attendants v. Zipes, 491 U. S. 754, 758, n. 2
(1989).The "lodestar" figure has, as its name suggests, become

the guiding light of our fee-shifting jurisprudence. We haveestablished a "strong presumption" that the lodestar represents the "reasonable" fee, Delaware Valley I, supra, at 565,
and have placed upon the fee applicant who seeks more than
that the burden of showing that "such an adjustment is
necessary to the determination of a reasonable fee." Blum
v. Stenson, 465 U. S. 886, 898 (1984) (emphasis added). The
Court of Appeals held, and Dague argues here, that a
"reasonable" fee for attorneys who have been retained on a
contingency-fee basis must go beyond the lodestar, to compensate for risk of loss and of consequent nonpayment. Feeshifting statutes should be construed, he contends, to replicate the economic incentives that operate in the private legal
market, where attorneys working on a contingency-fee basis
can be expected to charge some premium over their ordinary
hourly rates. Petitioner Burlington argues, by contrast,
that the lodestar fee may not be enhanced for contingency.

We note at the outset that an enhancement for contingency
would likely duplicate in substantial part factors already
subsumed in the lodestar. The risk of loss in a particular
case (and, therefore, the attorney's contingent risk) is the
product of two factors: (1) the legal and factual merits of the
claim, and (2) the difficulty of establishing those merits.
The second factor, however, is ordinarily reflected in the
lodestar--either in the higher number of hours expended to
overcome the difficulty, or in the higher hourly rate of the
attorney skilled and experienced enough to do so. Blum,

Opinion of the Court
supra, at 898-899. Taking account of it again through lode-star enhancement amounts to double counting.

Delaware
Valley II, 483 U. S., at 726-727 (plurality opinion).The first factor (relative merits of the claim) is not reflected in the lodestar, but there are good reasons why it
should play no part in the calculation of the award. It is, ofcourse, a factor that

always exists (no claim has a 100%
chance of success), so that computation of the lodestar wouldnever end the court's inquiry in contingent-fee cases. See

id., at 740 (Blackmun, J., dissenting). Moreover, the conse-quence of awarding contingency enhancement to take account of this "merits" factor would be to provide attorneys
with the same incentive to bring relatively meritless claims
as relatively meritorious ones. Assume, for example, two
claims, one with underlying merit of 20%, the other of 80%.
Absent any contingency enhancement, a contingent-fee attorney would prefer to take the latter, since he is four times
more likely to be paid. But with a contingency enhancement, this preference will disappear: the enhancement for
the 20% claim would be a multiplier of 5 (100/20), which is
quadruple the 1.25 multiplier (100/80) that would attach to
the 80% claim. Thus, enhancement for the contingency risk
posed by each case would encourage meritorious claims to
be brought, but only at the social cost of indiscriminately
encouraging nonmeritorious claims to be brought as well.
We think that an unlikely objective of the "reasonable fees"
provisions. "These statutes were not designed as a form
of economic relief to improve the financial lot of lawyers."
Delaware Valley I, 478 U. S., at 565.

Instead of enhancement based upon the contingency risk
posed by each case, Dague urges that we adopt the approach
set forth in the Delaware Valley II concurrence. We decline
to do so, first and foremost because we do not see how it can
intelligibly be applied. On the one hand, it would require
the party seeking contingency enhancement to "establish
that without the adjustment for risk [he] `would have faced

564 BURLINGTON v. DAGUE

Opinion of the Court
substantial difficulties in finding counsel in the local or otherrelevant market.' " 483 U. S., at 733. On the other hand,

it would forbid enhancement based "on an assessment ofthe `riskiness' of any particular case."

Id., at 731; see id.,
at 734 (no enhancement "based on `legal' risks or risks peculiar to the case"). But since the predominant reason that acontingent-fee claimant has difficulty finding counsel in any

legal market where the winner's attorney's fees will be paidby the loser is that attorneys view his case as too risky
(i. e., too unlikely to succeed), these two propositions, as apractical matter, collide. See

King v. Palmer, 292 U. S.
App. D. C. 362, 371, 950 F. 2d 771, 780 (1991) (en banc), cert.
pending sub nom. King v. Ridley, No. 91-1370.

A second difficulty with the approach taken by the concurrence in Delaware Valley II is that it would base the contingency enhancement on "the difference in market treatment
of contingent fee cases as a class." 483 U. S., at 731 (emphasis in original). To begin with, for a very large proportion
of contingency-fee cases--those seeking not monetary damages but injunctive or other equitable relief--there is no
"market treatment." Such cases scarcely exist, except to
the extent Congress has created an artificial "market" for
them by fee shifting--and looking to that "market" for the
meaning of fee shifting is obviously circular. Our decrees
would follow the "market," which in turn is based on our
decrees. See King v. Palmer, 285 U. S. App. D. C. 68, 76,
906 F. 2d 762, 770 (1990) (Williams, J., concurring) ("I see the
judicial judgment as defining the market, not vice versa"),
vacated, 292 U. S. App. D. C. 362, 950 F. 2d 771 (1991), cert.
pending sub nom. King v. Ridley, No. 91-1370. But even

apart from that difficulty, any approach that applies uniform
treatment to the entire class of contingent-fee cases, or to
any conceivable subject-matter-based subclass, cannot possibly achieve the supposed goal of mirroring market incentives. As discussed above, the contingent risk of a case (and
hence the difficulty of getting contingent-fee lawyers to take

565Cite as: 505 U. S. 557 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
it) depends principally upon its particular merits. Contin-gency enhancement calculated on any class-wide basis,

therefore, guarantees at best (leaving aside the double-counting problem described earlier) that those cases within
the class that have the class-average chance of success willbe compensated according to what the "market" requires to
produce the services, and that all cases having above-class-average chance of success will be overcompensated.

Looking beyond the Delaware Valley II concurrence's ap-proach, we perceive no other basis, fairly derivable from the
fee-shifting statutes, by which contingency enhancement, ifadopted, could be restricted to fewer than all contingent-fee
cases. And we see a number of reasons for concluding thatno contingency enhancement whatever is compatible with
the fee-shifting statutes at issue. First, just as the statu-tory language limiting fees to prevailing (or substantially
prevailing) parties bars a prevailing plaintiff from recoveringfees relating to claims on which he lost, Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424 (1983), so should it bar a prevailing plain-tiff from recovering for the risk of loss. See

Delaware Val-ley II, supra, at 719-720, 724-725 (principal opinion). An

attorney operating on a contingency-fee basis pools the riskspresented by his various cases: cases that turn out to be
successful pay for the time he gambled on those that did not.To award a contingency enhancement under a fee-shifting
statute would in effect pay for the attorney's time (or antici-pated time) in cases where his client does

not prevail.Second, both before and since Delaware Valley II, "we

have generally turned away from the contingent-feemodel"--which would make the fee award a percentage of
the value of the relief awarded in the primary action*--"to

*Contrary to Justice Blackmun's understanding, post, at 572, there is
no reason in theory why the contingent-fee model could not apply to relief
other than damages; where injunctive relief is obtained, for example, the
fee award would simply be a percentage of the value of the injunctive
relief. There would be, to be sure, severe problems of administration in

Opinion of the Court
the lodestar model." Venegas v. Mitchell, 495 U. S. 82, 87
(1990). We have done so, it must be noted, even though the
lodestar model often (perhaps, generally) results in a larger
fee award than the contingent-fee model. See, e. g., Report
of the Federal Courts Study Committee 104 (Apr. 2, 1990)
(lodestar method may "give lawyers incentives to run up
hours unnecessarily, which can lead to overcompensation").
For example, in Blanchard v. Bergeron, 489 U. S. 87 (1989),
we held that the lodestar governed, even though it produced
a fee that substantially exceeded the amount provided in the
contingent-fee agreement between plaintiff and his counsel
(which was self-evidently an amount adequate to attract the
needed legal services). Id., at 96. Contingency enhancement is a feature inherent in the contingent-fee model (since
attorneys factor in the particular risks of a case in negotiating their fee and in deciding whether to accept the case). To
engraft this feature onto the lodestar model would be to concoct a hybrid scheme that resorts to the contingent-fee model
to increase a fee award but not to reduce it. Contingency
enhancement is therefore not consistent with our general rejection of the contingent-fee model for fee awards, nor is it
necessary to the determination of a reasonable fee.

And finally, the interest in ready administrability that has
underlain our adoption of the lodestar approach, see, e. g.,
Hensley, 461 U. S., at 433, and the related interest in avoiding
burdensome satellite litigation (the fee application "should
not result in a second major litigation," id., at 437), counsel
strongly against adoption of contingency enhancement. Contingency enhancement would make the setting of fees more
complex and arbitrary, hence more unpredictable, and hence
more litigable. It is neither necessary nor even possible for
application of the fee-shifting statutes to mimic the intricadetermining the value of injunctive relief, but such problems simply highlight why we have rejected the contingent-fee model in favor of the lodestar model.

* * *
Adopting the position set forth in Justice White's opin-ion in Delaware Valley II, 483 U. S., at 715-727, we hold that

enhancement for contingency is not permitted under the fee-shifting statutes at issue. We reverse the Court of Appeals'
judgment insofar as it affirmed the 25% enhancement of thelodestar.

It is so ordered.
Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice Stevens joins,dissenting.

In language typical of most federal fee-shifting provisions,the statutes involved in this case authorize courts to award
the prevailing party a "reasonable" attorney's fee.1 Twoprinciples, in my view, require the conclusion that the "enhanced" fee awarded to respondents was reasonable. First,this Court consistently has recognized that a "reasonable"
fee is to be a "fully compensatory fee," Hensley v. Eckerhart,461 U. S. 424, 435 (1983), and is to be "calculated on the basis
of rates and practices prevailing in the relevant market."Missouri v. Jenkins, 491 U. S. 274, 286 (1989). Second, it is
a fact of the market that an attorney who is paid only whenhis client prevails will tend to charge a higher fee than one
who is paid regardless of outcome,2 and relevant profes-sional standards long have recognized that this practice is
reasonable.3

568 BURLINGTON v. DAGUE

Blackmun, J., dissenting
The Court does not deny these principles. It simply re-fuses to draw the conclusion that follows ineluctably: If a

statutory fee consistent with market practices is "reason-able," and if in the private market an attorney who assumes
the risk of nonpayment can expect additional compensation,then it follows that a statutory fee may include additional
compensation for contingency and still qualify as reasonable.The Court's decision to the contrary violates the principles
we have applied consistently in prior cases and will seriouslyweaken the enforcement of those statutes for which Congress has authorized fee awards--notably, many of our Na-tion's civil rights laws and environmental laws.

I
Congress' purpose in adopting fee-shifting provisions wasto strengthen the enforcement of selected federal laws by

ensuring that private persons seeking to enforce those lawscould retain competent counsel. See S. Rep. No. 94-1011,
p. 6 (1976). In particular, federal fee-shifting provisionshave been designed to address two related difficulties that
otherwise would prevent private persons from obtainingcounsel. First, many potential plaintiffs lack sufficient resources to hire attorneys. See H. R. Rep. No. 94-1558, p. 1(1976); S. Rep. No. 94-1011, at 2. Second, many of the statutes to which Congress attached fee-shifting provisionstypically will generate either no damages or only small recoveries; accordingly, plaintiffs bringing cases under thesestatutes cannot offer attorneys a share of a recovery sufficient to justify a standard contingent-fee arrangement. See
Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for
Clean Air (Delaware Valley II), 483 U. S. 711, 749 (1987)(dissenting opinion); H. R. Rep. No. 94-1558, at 9. The strategy of the fee-shifting provisions is to attract competentcounsel to selected federal cases by ensuring that if they
prevail, counsel will receive fees commensurable with whatthey could obtain in other litigation. If federal fee-bearing

Blackmun, J., dissenting
litigation is less remunerative than private litigation, thenthe only attorneys who will take such cases will be underemployed lawyers--who likely will be less competent than thesuccessful, busy lawyers who would shun federal fee-bearing
litigation--and public interest lawyers who, by any measure,
are insufficiently numerous to handle all the cases for whichother competent attorneys cannot be found. See

Delaware
Valley II, 483 U. S., at 742-743 (dissenting opinion).In many cases brought under federal statutes that authorize fee shifting, plaintiffs will be unable to ensure that theirattorneys will be compensated for the risk that they might
not prevail. This will be true in precisely those situations
targeted by the fee-shifting statutes--where plaintiffs lack
sufficient funds to hire an attorney on a win-or-lose basis and
where potential damages awards are insufficient to justify a
standard contingent-fee arrangement. In these situations,
unless the fee-shifting statutes are construed to compensate
attorneys for the risk of nonpayment associated with loss,
the expected return from cases brought under federal feeshifting provisions will be less than could be obtained in
otherwise comparable private litigation offering guaranteed,
win-or-lose compensation. Prudent counsel, under these
conditions, would tend to avoid federal fee-bearing claims in
favor of private litigation, even in the very situations for
which the attorney's fee statutes were designed. This will
be true even if the fee-bearing claim is more likely meritorious than the competing private claim.

In Delaware Valley II, five Justices of this Court concluded that for these reasons the broad statutory term "reasonable attorney's fee" must be construed to permit, in some
circumstances, compensation above the hourly win-or-lose
rate generally borrowed to compute the lodestar fee. See
483 U. S., at 731, 732-733 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part
and concurring in judgment); id., at 735 (dissenting opinion).
Together with the three Justices who joined my dissenting
opinion in that case, I would have allowed enhancement

Blackmun, J., dissenting
where, and to the extent that, the attorney's compensationis contingent upon prevailing and receiving a statutory

award. I indicated that if, by contrast, the attorney andclient have been able to mitigate the risk of nonpayment--
either in full, by agreeing to win-or-lose compensation or toa contingent share of a substantial damages recovery, or
in part, by arranging for partial payment--then to that ex-tent enhancement should be unavailable.

Id., at 748-749. Imade clear that the "risk" for which enhancement might be

available is not the particular factual and legal riskiness of anindividual case, but the risk of nonpayment associated with
contingent cases considered as a class. Id., at 745-747, 752.Congress, I concluded, did not intend to prohibit district
courts from considering contingency in calculating a "reason-able" attorney's fee.

Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion agreed that "Con-gress did not intend to foreclose consideration of contingency

in setting a reasonable fee," id., at 731, and that "compensa-tion for contingency must be based on the difference in market treatment of contingent-fee cases as a class, rather thanon an assessment of the `riskiness' of any particular case"
(emphasis in original). Ibid. As I understand her opinion,

4 A number of bills introduced in Congress would have done just this,
by prohibiting "bonuses and multipliers" where a suit is against the United
States, a State, or a local government. These bills failed to receive congressional approval. See Delaware Valley II, 483 U. S., at 739, n. 3 (dissenting opinion).

Moreover, in some instances Congress explicitly has prohibited enhancements, as in the 1986 amendments to the Education of the Handicapped
Act. See 20 U. S. C. $ 1415(e)(4)(C) ("[n]o bonus or multiplier may be used
in calculating the fees awarded under this subsection"). Congress' express prohibition on enhancement in this statute suggests that it did not
understand the standard fee-shifting language used elsewhere to bar enhancement. Cf. West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U. S.
83, 92-97 (1991) (relying, in part, on express authorization of expertwitness fees in subsequently passed fee-shifting statutes to infer that such
fees could not have been included in unsupplemented references to "attorney's fees").

Blackmun, J., dissenting
Justice O'Connor further agreed that a court consideringan enhancement must determine whether and to what extent

the attorney's compensation was contingent, as well aswhether and to what extent that contingency was, or could
have been, mitigated. Her concurrence added, however, anadditional inquiry designed to make the market-based approach "not merely justifiable in theory but also objectiveand nonarbitrary in practice."

Id., at 732. She suggestedtwo additional "constraints on a court's discretion" in determining whether, and how much, enhancement is warranted.First, "district courts and courts of appeals should treat a
determination of how a particular market compensates forcontingency as controlling future cases involving the same
market," and varying rates of enhancement among marketsmust be justifiable by reference to real differences in those
markets. Id., at 733. Second, the applicant bears the bur-den of demonstrating that without an adjustment for risk
"the prevailing party would have faced substantial difficul-ties in finding counsel in the local or other relevant market."
Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).

II
After criticizing at some length an approach it admits re-spondents and their

amici do not advocate, see ante, at 563-564, and after rejecting the approach of the Delaware Valley II concurrence, see ante, at 564-565, the Court statesthat it "see[s] a number of reasons for concluding that no
contingency enhancement whatever is compatible with thefee-shifting statutes at issue." Ante, at 565. I do not find
any of these arguments persuasive.The Court argues, first, that "[a]n attorney operating on a
contingency-fee basis pools the risks presented by his vari-ous cases" and uses the cases that were successful to subsidize those that were not. Ibid. "To award a contingencyenhancement under a fee-shifting statute," the Court concludes, would "in effect" contravene the prevailing-party

572 BURLINGTON v. DAGUE

Blackmun, J., dissenting
limitation, by allowing the attorney to recover fees for casesin which his client does not prevail.

Ibid. What the words
"in effect" conceal, however, is the Court's inattention to thelanguage of the statutes: The provisions at issue in this case,

like fee-shifting provisions generally, authorize fee awards
to prevailing parties, not their attorneys. See 33 U. S. C.$ 1365(d); 42 U. S. C. $ 6972(e); see also

Venegas v. Mitchell,
495 U. S. 82, 87 (1990). Respondents simply do not advocateawarding fees to any party who has not prevailed. Moreover, the Court's reliance on the "prevailing party" limitationis somewhat misleading: the Court's real objection to contingency enhancement is that the amount of an enhanced award
would be excessive, not that parties receiving enhanced fee
awards are not prevailing parties entitled to an award. In
prior cases the Court has been careful to distinguish between these two issues. See, e. g., Hensley v. Eckerhart,
461 U. S., at 433 (The "prevailing party" determination only
"brings the plaintiff . . . across the statutory threshold. It
remains for the district court to determine what fee is
`reasonable' ").

Second, the Court suggests that "both before and since
Delaware Valley II, `we have generally turned away from
the contingent-fee model'--which would make the fee award
a percentage of the value of the relief awarded in the primary action--`to the lodestar model.' " Ante, at 565-566
(footnote omitted), quoting Venegas v. Mitchell, 495 U. S.,
at 87. This argument simply plays on two meanings of
"contingency." Most assuredly, respondents--who received
no damages for their fee-bearing claims--do not advocate
"mak[ing] the fee award a percentage" of that amount.
Rather, they argue that the lodestar figure must be enhanced
because their attorneys' compensation was contingent on
prevailing, and because their attorneys could not otherwise
be compensated for assuming the risk of nonpayment.

Third, the Court suggests that allowing for contingency
enhancement "would make the setting of fees more complex

505us2109K 07-09-96 20:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT

573Cite as: 505 U. S. 557 (1992)
Blackmun, J., dissenting
and arbitrary" and would likely lead to "burdensome satellite
litigation" that this Court has said should be avoided. Ante,
at 566. The present case is an odd one in which to make
this point: The issue of enhancement hardly occupied center
stage in the fees portion of this litigation, and it became a
time-consuming matter only after the Court granted certiorari, limited to this question alone.5 Moreover, if Justice O'Connor's standard were adopted, the matter of the
amount by which fees should be increased would quickly become settled in the various district courts and courts of
appeals for the different kinds of federal litigation. And
in any event, speculation that enhancement determinations
would be "burdensome" does not speak to the issue whether
they are required by the fee-shifting statutes.

The final objection to be considered is the Court's contention that any approach that treats contingent-fee cases as a
class is doomed to failure. The Court's argument on this
score has two parts. First, the Court opines that "for a very
large proportion of contingency-fee cases"--cases in which
only equitable relief is sought--"there is no `market treatment,' " except insofar as Congress has created an "artificial"
market with the fee-shifting statutes themselves. It is circular, the Court contends, to "loo[k] to that `market' for the
meaning of fee-shifting." Ante, at 564. And even leaving
that difficulty aside, the Court continues, the real "risk" to
which lawyers respond is the riskiness of particular cases.
Because under a class-based contingency enhancement system the same enhancement will be awarded whether the

5 It is fair to say that petitioner's attention was directed almost exclusively toward the merits issues, both in the lower courts and in its petition
for certiorari. While petitioner sharply contested respondents' entitlement to an award and objected to the amount of the lodestar, its opposition
to enhancement occupies only a single page of its memorandum in opposition to the motion for fees and costs. See App. 224-225. Only a little
more than 1 page of the 30-page petition for certiorari is devoted to the
issue of contingency enhancement. See Pet. for Cert. 25-27.

Blackmun, J., dissenting
chance of prevailing was 80% or 20%, "all cases havingabove-class-average chance of success will be overcompensated" (emphasis in original). Ante, at 565.Both parts of this argument are mistaken. The circularity objection overlooks the fact that even under the Court'sunenhanced lodestar approach, the district court must find a
relevant private market from which to select a fee. TheCourt offers no reason why this market disappears only
when the inquiry turns to enhancement. The second part ofthe Court's argument is mistaken so far as it assumes the
only relevant incentive to which attorneys respond is the riskof losing particular cases. As explained above, a proper system of contingency enhancement addresses a different kindof incentive: the common incentive of all lawyers to avoid
any fee-bearing claim in which the plaintiff cannot guaranteethe lawyer's compensation if he does not prevail. Because,
as the Court observes, "no claim has a 100% chance of suc-cess," ante, at 563, any such case under a pure lodestar system will offer a lower prospective return per hour than onein which the lawyer will be paid at the same lodestar rate,
win or lose. Even the least meritorious case in which theattorney is guaranteed compensation whether he wins or
loses will be economically preferable to the most meritoriousfee-bearing claim in which the attorney will be paid only if
he prevails, so long as the cases require the same amount oftime. Yet as noted above, this latter kind of case--in which
potential plaintiffs can neither afford to hire attorneys on astraight hourly basis nor offer a percentage of a substantial
damages recovery--is exactly the kind of case for which thefee-shifting statutes were designed.

III
Preventing attorneys who bring actions under fee-shiftingstatutes from receiving fully compensatory fees will harm

far more than the legal profession. Congress intended thefee-shifting statutes to serve as an integral enforcement

mechanism in a variety of federal statutes--most notably,
civil rights and environmental statutes. The amicus briefs
filed in this case make clear that we can expect many meritorious actions will not be filed, or, if filed, will be prosecuted
by less experienced and able counsel.6 Today's decision
weakens the protections we afford important federal rights.

I dissent.

Justice O'Connor, dissenting.
I continue to be of the view that in certain circumstances
a "reasonable" attorney's fee should not be computed by the
purely retrospective lodestar figure, but also must incorporate a reasonable incentive to an attorney contemplating
whether or not to take a case in the first place. See Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean
Air, 483 U. S. 711, 731-734 (1987) (Delaware Valley II)
(O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). As Justice Blackmun cogently explains, when an
attorney must choose between two cases--one with a client
who will pay the attorney's fees win or lose and the other
who can only promise the statutory compensation if the case
is successful--the attorney will choose the fee-paying client,
unless the contingency client can promise an enhancement
of sufficient magnitude to justify the extra risk of nonpayment. Ante, at 568-569. Thus, a reasonable fee should be
one that would "attract competent counsel," Delaware Valley II, supra, at 733 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment), and in some markets this must include the assurance of a contingency enhancement if the
plaintiff should prevail. I therefore dissent from the Court's
holding that a "reasonable" attorney's fee can never include
an enhancement for cases taken on contingency.

576 BURLINGTON v. DAGUE

O'Connor, J., dissenting
In my view the promised enhancement should be "basedon the difference in market treatment of contingent fee cases

as a class, rather than on an assessment of the `riskiness' ofany particular case." 483 U. S., at 731 (emphasis omitted).
As Justice Blackmun has shown, the Court's reasons for
rejecting a market-based approach do not stand up to scru-tiny.

Ante, at 574. Admittedly, the courts called upon
to determine the enhancements appropriate for variousmarkets would be required to make economic calculations

based on less-than-perfect data. Yet that is also the case,for example, in inverse condemnation and antitrust cases,
and the Court has never suggested that the difficulty of
the task or possible inexactitude of the result justifies forgoing those calculations altogether. As Justice Blackmun
notes, these initial hurdles would be overcome as the enhancements appropriate to various markets became settled
in the district courts and courts of appeals. Ante, at 573.

In this case, the District Court determined that a 25% contingency enhancement was appropriate by reliance on the
likelihood of success in the individual case. App. to Pet. for
Cert. 132-133. The Court of Appeals affirmed on the basis
of its holding in Friends of the Earth v. Eastman Kodak Co.,
834 F. 2d 295 (CA2 1987), which asks simply whether, without the possibility of a fee enhancement, the prevailing party
would not have been able to obtain competent counsel. 935
F. 2d 1343, 1360 (CA2 1991) (citing Friends of the Earth,
supra). Although I believe that inquiry is part of the contingency enhancement determination, see Delaware Valley
II, supra, at 733 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), I also believe that it was error to base
the degree of enhancement on case-specific factors. Because
I can find no market-specific support for the 25% enhancement figure in the affidavits submitted by respondents in
support of the fee request, I would vacate the judgment
affirming the fee award and remand for a market-based assessment of a suitable enhancement for contingency.

Syllabus

LEE et al. v. WEISMAN, personally and as

next friend of WEISMAN

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe first circuit

No. 90-1014. Argued November 6, 1991--Decided June 24, 1992
Principals of public middle and high schools in Providence, Rhode Island,

are permitted to invite members of the clergy to give invocations and
benedictions at their schools' graduation ceremonies. Petitioner Lee, a
middle school principal, invited a rabbi to offer such prayers at the graduation ceremony for Deborah Weisman's class, gave the rabbi a pamphlet containing guidelines for the composition of public prayers at civic
ceremonies, and advised him that the prayers should be nonsectarian.
Shortly before the ceremony, the District Court denied the motion of
respondent Weisman, Deborah's father, for a temporary restraining
order to prohibit school officials from including the prayers in the ceremony. Deborah and her family attended the ceremony, and the prayers
were recited. Subsequently, Weisman sought a permanent injunction
barring Lee and other petitioners, various Providence public school
officials, from inviting clergy to deliver invocations and benedictions
at future graduations. It appears likely that such prayers will be conducted at Deborah's high school graduation. The District Court enjoined petitioners from continuing the practice at issue on the ground
that it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.
The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: Including clergy who offer prayers as part of an official public

school graduation ceremony is forbidden by the Establishment Clause.
Pp. 586-599.

(a) This Court need not revisit the questions of the definition and
scope of the principles governing the extent of permitted accommodation by the State for its citizens' religious beliefs and practices, for the
controlling precedents as they relate to prayer and religious exercise in
primary and secondary public schools compel the holding here. Thus,
the Court will not reconsider its decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403
U. S. 602. The principle that government may accommodate the free
exercise of religion does not supersede the fundamental limitations imposed by the Establishment Clause, which guarantees at a minimum
that a government may not coerce anyone to support or participate in
religion or its exercise, or otherwise act in a way which "establishes a

Syllabus
[state] religion or religious faith, or tends to do so." Lynch v. Donnelly,
465 U. S. 668, 678. Pp. 586-587.

(b) State officials here direct the performance of a formal religious
exercise at secondary schools' promotional and graduation ceremonies.
Lee's decision that prayers should be given and his selection of the
religious participant are choices attributable to the State. Moreover,
through the pamphlet and his advice that the prayers be nonsectarian,
he directed and controlled the prayers' content. That the directions
may have been given in a good-faith attempt to make the prayers acceptable to most persons does not resolve the dilemma caused by the
school's involvement, since the government may not establish an official
or civic religion as a means of avoiding the establishment of a religion
with more specific creeds. Pp. 587-590.

(c) The Establishment Clause was inspired by the lesson that in the
hands of government what might begin as a tolerant expression of religious views may end in a policy to indoctrinate and coerce. Prayer
exercises in elementary and secondary schools carry a particular risk of
indirect coercion. Engel v. Vitale, 370 U. S. 421; School Dist. of Abington v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203. The school district's supervision and
control of a high school graduation ceremony places subtle and indirect
public and peer pressure on attending students to stand as a group or
maintain respectful silence during the invocation and benediction. A
reasonable dissenter of high school age could believe that standing or
remaining silent signified her own participation in, or approval of, the
group exercise, rather than her respect for it. And the State may not
place the student dissenter in the dilemma of participating or protesting.
Since adolescents are often susceptible to peer pressure, especially in
matters of social convention, the State may no more use social pressure
to enforce orthodoxy than it may use direct means. The embarrassment and intrusion of the religious exercise cannot be refuted by arguing that the prayers are of a de minimis character, since that is an
affront to the rabbi and those for whom the prayers have meaning, and
since any intrusion was both real and a violation of the objectors'
rights. Pp. 590-594.

(d) Petitioners' argument that the option of not attending the ceremony excuses any inducement or coercion in the ceremony itself is rejected. In this society, high school graduation is one of life's most significant occasions, and a student is not free to absent herself from the
exercise in any real sense of the term "voluntary." Also not dispositive
is the contention that prayers are an essential part of these ceremonies
because for many persons the occasion would lack meaning without the
recognition that human achievements cannot be understood apart from
their spiritual essence. This position fails to acknowledge that what

for many was a spiritual imperative was for the Weismans religious
conformance compelled by the State. It also gives insufficient recognition to the real conflict of conscience faced by a student who would have
to choose whether to miss graduation or conform to the state-sponsored
practice, in an environment where the risk of compulsion is especially
high. Pp. 594-596.

(e) Inherent differences between the public school system and a session of a state legislature distinguish this case from Marsh v. Chambers,
463 U. S. 783, which condoned a prayer exercise. The atmosphere at a
state legislature's opening, where adults are free to enter and leave with
little comment and for any number of reasons, cannot compare with the
constraining potential of the one school event most important for the
student to attend. Pp. 596-598.

Opinion of the Court

I
A

Deborah Weisman graduated from Nathan Bishop Middle
School, a public school in Providence, at a formal ceremony
in June 1989. She was about 14 years old. For many years
it has been the policy of the Providence School Committee
and the Superintendent of Schools to permit principals to
invite members of the clergy to give invocations and benedictions at middle school and high school graduations. Many,
but not all, of the principals elected to include prayers as
part of the graduation ceremonies. Acting for himself and
his daughter, Deborah's father, Daniel Weisman, objected to
any prayers at Deborah's middle school graduation, but to no
avail. The school principal, petitioner Robert E. Lee, invited a rabbi to deliver prayers at the graduation exercises
for Deborah's class. Rabbi Leslie Gutterman, of the Temple
Beth El in Providence, accepted.

It has been the custom of Providence school officials to
provide invited clergy with a pamphlet entitled "Guidelines
for Civic Occasions," prepared by the National Conference
of Christians and Jews. The Guidelines recommend that
public prayers at nonsectarian civic ceremonies be composed
with "inclusiveness and sensitivity," though they acknowledge that "[p]rayer of any kind may be inappropriate on
some civic occasions." App. 20-21. The principal gave
Rabbi Gutterman the pamphlet before the graduation and
advised him the invocation and benediction should be nonsectarian. Agreed Statement of Facts || 17, id., at 13.

Rabbi Gutterman's prayers were as follows:

"INVOCATION
"God of the Free, Hope of the Brave:
"For the legacy of America where diversity is celebrated and the rights of minorities are protected, we

thank You. May these young men and women grow up
to enrich it.

"For the liberty of America, we thank You. May
these new graduates grow up to guard it.

"For the political process of America in which all its
citizens may participate, for its court system where all
may seek justice we thank You. May those we honor
this morning always turn to it in trust.

"For the destiny of America we thank You. May the
graduates of Nathan Bishop Middle School so live that
they might help to share it.

"May our aspirations for our country and for these
young people, who are our hope for the future, be
richly fulfilled.

AMEN"
"BENEDICTION
"O God, we are grateful to You for having endowed us
with the capacity for learning which we have celebrated
on this joyous commencement.

"Happy families give thanks for seeing their children
achieve an important milestone. Send Your blessings
upon the teachers and administrators who helped prepare them.

"The graduates now need strength and guidance for
the future, help them to understand that we are not complete with academic knowledge alone. We must each
strive to fulfill what You require of us all: To do justly,
to love mercy, to walk humbly.

"We give thanks to You, Lord, for keeping us alive,
sustaining us and allowing us to reach this special,
happy occasion.

Opinion of the Court
The record in this case is sparse in many respects, and weare unfamiliar with any fixed custom or practice at middle

school graduations, referred to by the school district as "pro-motional exercises." We are not so constrained with reference to high schools, however. High school graduations are
such an integral part of American cultural life that we canwith confidence describe their customary features, confirmed

by aspects of the record and by the parties' representationsat oral argument. In the Providence school system, most
high school graduation ceremonies are conducted away fromthe school, while most middle school ceremonies are held on
school premises. Classical High School, which Deborah now
attends, has conducted its graduation ceremonies on school
premises. Agreed Statement of Facts || 37, id., at 17. The
parties stipulate that attendance at graduation ceremonies is
voluntary. Agreed Statement of Facts || 41, id., at 18. The
graduating students enter as a group in a processional, subject to the direction of teachers and school officials, and sit
together, apart from their families. We assume the clergy's
participation in any high school graduation exercise would
be about what it was at Deborah's middle school ceremony.
There the students stood for the Pledge of Allegiance and
remained standing during the rabbi's prayers. Tr. of Oral
Arg. 38. Even on the assumption that there was a respectful moment of silence both before and after the prayers, the
rabbi's two presentations must not have extended much beyond a minute each, if that. We do not know whether he
remained on stage during the whole ceremony, or whether
the students received individual diplomas on stage, or if he
helped to congratulate them.

The school board (and the United States, which supports
it as amicus curiae) argued that these short prayers and
others like them at graduation exercises are of profound
meaning to many students and parents throughout this country who consider that due respect and acknowledgment for
divine guidance and for the deepest spiritual aspirations of

our people ought to be expressed at an event as importantin life as a graduation. We assume this to be so in addressing the difficult case now before us, for the significance ofthe prayers lies also at the heart of Daniel and Deborah
Weisman's case. B

Deborah's graduation was held on the premises of NathanBishop Middle School on June 29, 1989. Four days before
the ceremony, Daniel Weisman, in his individual capacity asa Providence taxpayer and as next friend of Deborah, sought
a temporary restraining order in the United States DistrictCourt for the District of Rhode Island to prohibit school officials from including an invocation or benediction in the grad-uation ceremony. The court denied the motion for lack of
adequate time to consider it. Deborah and her family at-tended the graduation, where the prayers were recited. In
July 1989, Daniel Weisman filed an amended complaint seek-ing a permanent injunction barring petitioners, various officials of the Providence public schools, from inviting theclergy to deliver invocations and benedictions at future
graduations. We find it unnecessary to address DanielWeisman's taxpayer standing, for a live and justiciable controversy is before us. Deborah Weisman is enrolled as astudent at Classical High School in Providence and from the
record it appears likely, if not certain, that an invocation andbenediction will be conducted at her high school graduation.
Agreed Statement of Facts || 38, App. 17.The case was submitted on stipulated facts. The District
Court held that petitioners' practice of including invoca-tions and benedictions in public school graduations violated
the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, andit enjoined petitioners from continuing the practice. 728
F. Supp. 68 (1990). The court applied the three-partEstablishment Clause test set forth in Lemon v. Kurtzman,
403 U. S. 602 (1971). Under that test as described in ourpast cases, to satisfy the Establishment Clause a governmen505us2110L 04-22-99 18:56:59 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
tal practice must (1) reflect a clearly secular purpose; (2)have a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion; and (3) avoid excessive government entanglement withreligion.

Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v.
Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756, 773 (1973). The District Court held
that petitioners' actions violated the second part of the test,and so did not address either the first or the third. The

court decided, based on its reading of our precedents, thatthe effects test of

Lemon is violated whenever government
action "creates an identification of the state with a religion,or with religion in general," 728 F. Supp., at 71, or when "the

effect of the governmental action is to endorse one religion
over another, or to endorse religion in general." Id., at 72.
The court determined that the practice of including invocations and benedictions, even so-called nonsectarian ones, in
public school graduations creates an identification of governmental power with religious practice, endorses religion, and
violates the Establishment Clause. In so holding the court
expressed the determination not to follow Stein v. Plainwell
Community Schools, 822 F. 2d 1406 (1987), in which the
Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, relying on our decision in Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783 (1983), held that
benedictions and invocations at public school graduations are
not always unconstitutional. In Marsh we upheld the constitutionality of the Nebraska State Legislature's practice of
opening each of its sessions with a prayer offered by a chaplain paid out of public funds. The District Court in this case
disagreed with the Sixth Circuit's reasoning because it believed that Marsh was a narrow decision, "limited to the
unique situation of legislative prayer," and did not have any
relevance to school prayer cases. 728 F. Supp., at 74.

On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the
First Circuit affirmed. The majority opinion by Judge Torruella adopted the opinion of the District Court. 908 F. 2d
1090 (1990). Judge Bownes joined the majority, but wrote
a separate concurring opinion in which he decided that the

Opinion of the Court
practices challenged here violated all three parts of theLemon test. Judge Bownes went on to agree with the District Court that Marsh had no application to school prayercases and that the Stein decision was flawed. He concluded
by suggesting that under Establishment Clause rules noprayer, even one excluding any mention of the Deity, could
be offered at a public school graduation ceremony. 908F. 2d, at 1090-1097. Judge Campbell dissented, on the basis
of Marsh and Stein. He reasoned that if the prayers deliv-ered were nonsectarian, and if school officials ensured that
persons representing a variety of beliefs and ethical systemswere invited to present invocations and benedictions, there
was no violation of the Establishment Clause. 908 F. 2d, at1099. We granted certiorari, 499 U. S. 918 (1991), and now
affirm. II

These dominant facts mark and control the confines of ourdecision: State officials direct the performance of a formal
religious exercise at promotional and graduation ceremoniesfor secondary schools. Even for those students who object
to the religious exercise, their attendance and participationin the state-sponsored religious activity are in a fair and real
sense obligatory, though the school district does not requireattendance as a condition for receipt of the diploma.

This case does not require us to revisit the difficult ques-tions dividing us in recent cases, questions of the definition
and full scope of the principles governing the extent of per-mitted accommodation by the State for the religious beliefs
and practices of many of its citizens. See County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573 (1989); Wallace v. Jaffree, 472U. S. 38 (1985); Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668 (1984). For

without reference to those principles in other contexts, thecontrolling precedents as they relate to prayer and religious
exercise in primary and secondary public schools compel theholding here that the policy of the city of Providence is an

587Cite as: 505 U. S. 577 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
unconstitutional one. We can decide the case without recon-sidering the general constitutional framework by which public schools' efforts to accommodate religion are measured.Thus we do not accept the invitation of petitioners and

amicus the United States to reconsider our decision in Lemon v.
Kurtzman, supra. The government involvement with reli-gious activity in this case is pervasive, to the point of creating a state-sponsored and state-directed religious exercise ina public school. Conducting this formal religious observance conflicts with settled rules pertaining to prayer exer-cises for students, and that suffices to determine the question
before us.

The principle that government may accommodate the free
exercise of religion does not supersede the fundamental limitations imposed by the Establishment Clause. It is beyond
dispute that, at a minimum, the Constitution guarantees that
government may not coerce anyone to support or participate
in religion or its exercise, or otherwise act in a way which
"establishes a [state] religion or religious faith, or tends to
do so." Lynch, supra, at 678; see also County of Allegheny,
supra, at 591, quoting Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing,
330 U. S. 1, 15-16 (1947). The State's involvement in the
school prayers challenged today violates these central
principles.

That involvement is as troubling as it is undenied. A
school official, the principal, decided that an invocation and a
benediction should be given; this is a choice attributable to
the State, and from a constitutional perspective it is as if
a state statute decreed that the prayers must occur. The
principal chose the religious participant, here a rabbi, and
that choice is also attributable to the State. The reason for
the choice of a rabbi is not disclosed by the record, but the
potential for divisiveness over the choice of a particular
member of the clergy to conduct the ceremony is apparent.

Divisiveness, of course, can attend any state decision respecting religions, and neither its existence nor its potential

Opinion of the Court
necessarily invalidates the State's attempts to accommodatereligion in all cases. The potential for divisiveness is of particular relevance here though, because it centers around anovert religious exercise in a secondary school environment
where, as we discuss below, see infra, at 593-594, subtle coercive pressures exist and where the student had no realalternative which would have allowed her to avoid the fact

or appearance of participation.The State's role did not end with the decision to include a
prayer and with the choice of a clergyman. Principal Leeprovided Rabbi Gutterman with a copy of the "Guidelines
for Civic Occasions," and advised him that his prayers should
be nonsectarian. Through these means the principal directed and controlled the content of the prayers. Even if
the only sanction for ignoring the instructions were that the
rabbi would not be invited back, we think no religious representative who valued his or her continued reputation and
effectiveness in the community would incur the State's displeasure in this regard. It is a cornerstone principle of our
Establishment Clause jurisprudence that "it is no part of the
business of government to compose official prayers for any
group of the American people to recite as a part of a religious
program carried on by government," Engel v. Vitale, 370
U. S. 421, 425 (1962), and that is what the school officials attempted to do.

Petitioners argue, and we find nothing in the case to refute
it, that the directions for the content of the prayers were a
good-faith attempt by the school to ensure that the sectarianism which is so often the flashpoint for religious animosity
be removed from the graduation ceremony. The concern is
understandable, as a prayer which uses ideas or images identified with a particular religion may foster a different sort of
sectarian rivalry than an invocation or benediction in terms
more neutral. The school's explanation, however, does not
resolve the dilemma caused by its participation. The question is not the good faith of the school in attempting to make

Opinion of the Court
the prayer acceptable to most persons, but the legitimacy ofits undertaking that enterprise at all when the object is to

produce a prayer to be used in a formal religious exercisewhich students, for all practical purposes, are obliged to
attend.

We are asked to recognize the existence of a practice ofnonsectarian prayer, prayer within the embrace of what is

known as the Judeo-Christian tradition, prayer which ismore acceptable than one which, for example, makes explicit
references to the God of Israel, or to Jesus Christ, or to apatron saint. There may be some support, as an empirical
observation, to the statement of the Court of Appeals for the
Sixth Circuit, picked up by Judge Campbell's dissent in the
Court of Appeals in this case, that there has emerged in this
country a civic religion, one which is tolerated when sectarian exercises are not. Stein, 822 F. 2d, at 1409; 908 F. 2d
1090, 1098-1099 (CA1 1990) (Campbell, J., dissenting) (case
below); see also Note, Civil Religion and the Establishment
Clause, 95 Yale L. J. 1237 (1986). If common ground can be
defined which permits once conflicting faiths to express the
shared conviction that there is an ethic and a morality which
transcend human invention, the sense of community and purpose sought by all decent societies might be advanced. But
though the First Amendment does not allow the government
to stifle prayers which aspire to these ends, neither does it
permit the government to undertake that task for itself.

The First Amendment's Religion Clauses mean that religious beliefs and religious expression are too precious to be
either proscribed or prescribed by the State. The design
of the Constitution is that preservation and transmission of
religious beliefs and worship is a responsibility and a choice
committed to the private sphere, which itself is promised
freedom to pursue that mission. It must not be forgotten
then, that while concern must be given to define the protection granted to an objector or a dissenting nonbeliever, these
same Clauses exist to protect religion from government in505us2110L 04-22-99 18:56:59 PAGES OPINPGT
590 LEE v. WEISMAN

Opinion of the Court
terference. James Madison, the principal author of the Billof Rights, did not rest his opposition to a religious establishment on the sole ground of its effect on the minority. Aprincipal ground for his view was: "[E]xperience witnesseth
that ecclesiastical establishments, instead of maintaining
the purity and efficacy of Religion, have had a contrary op-eration." Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious

Assessments (1785), in 8 Papers of James Madison 301(W. Rachal, R. Rutland, B. Ripel, & F. Teute eds. 1973).

These concerns have particular application in the case ofschool officials, whose effort to monitor prayer will be perceived by the students as inducing a participation they might
otherwise reject. Though the efforts of the school officials
in this case to find common ground appear to have been a
good-faith attempt to recognize the common aspects of religions and not the divisive ones, our precedents do not permit
school officials to assist in composing prayers as an incident
to a formal exercise for their students. Engel v. Vitale,
supra, at 425. And these same precedents caution us to
measure the idea of a civic religion against the central meaning of the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment, which
is that all creeds must be tolerated and none favored. The
suggestion that government may establish an official or civic
religion as a means of avoiding the establishment of a religion with more specific creeds strikes us as a contradiction
that cannot be accepted.

The degree of school involvement here made it clear that
the graduation prayers bore the imprint of the State and
thus put school-age children who objected in an untenable
position. We turn our attention now to consider the position
of the students, both those who desired the prayer and she
who did not.

To endure the speech of false ideas or offensive content
and then to counter it is part of learning how to live in a
pluralistic society, a society which insists upon open discourse towards the end of a tolerant citizenry. And toler505us2110L 04-22-99 18:56:59 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ance presupposes some mutuality of obligation. It is arguedthat our constitutional vision of a free society requires confidence in our own ability to accept or reject ideas of whichwe do not approve, and that prayer at a high school graduation does nothing more than offer a choice. By the time
they are seniors, high school students no doubt have beenrequired to attend classes and assemblies and to complete

assignments exposing them to ideas they find distasteful orimmoral or absurd or all of these. Against this background,
students may consider it an odd measure of justice to besubjected during the course of their educations to ideas
deemed offensive and irreligious, but to be denied a brief,
formal prayer ceremony that the school offers in return.
This argument cannot prevail, however. It overlooks a fundamental dynamic of the Constitution.

The First Amendment protects speech and religion by
quite different mechanisms. Speech is protected by ensuring its full expression even when the government participates, for the very object of some of our most important
speech is to persuade the government to adopt an idea as its
own. Meese v. Keene, 481 U. S. 465, 480-481 (1987); see also
Keller v. State Bar of California, 496 U. S. 1, 10-11 (1990);
Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209 (1977). The
method for protecting freedom of worship and freedom of
conscience in religious matters is quite the reverse. In religious debate or expression the government is not a prime
participant, for the Framers deemed religious establishment
antithetical to the freedom of all. The Free Exercise Clause
embraces a freedom of conscience and worship that has close
parallels in the speech provisions of the First Amendment,
but the Establishment Clause is a specific prohibition on
forms of state intervention in religious affairs with no precise counterpart in the speech provisions. Buckley v. Valeo,
424 U. S. 1, 92-93, and n. 127 (1976) (per curiam). The explanation lies in the lesson of history that was and is the
inspiration for the Establishment Clause, the lesson that in

505us2110L 04-22-99 18:56:59 PAGES OPINPGT
592 LEE v. WEISMAN

Opinion of the Court
the hands of government what might begin as a tolerant expression of religious views may end in a policy to indoctrinate and coerce. A state-created orthodoxy puts at grave
risk that freedom of belief and conscience which are the sole
assurance that religious faith is real, not imposed.

The lessons of the First Amendment are as urgent in the
modern world as in the 18th century when it was written.
One timeless lesson is that if citizens are subjected to statesponsored religious exercises, the State disavows its own
duty to guard and respect that sphere of inviolable conscience and belief which is the mark of a free people. To
compromise that principle today would be to deny our own
tradition and forfeit our standing to urge others to secure
the protections of that tradition for themselves.

As we have observed before, there are heightened concerns with protecting freedom of conscience from subtle
coercive pressure in the elementary and secondary public
schools. See, e. g., School Dist. of Abington v. Schempp, 374
U. S. 203, 307 (1963) (Goldberg, J., concurring); Edwards v.
Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578, 584 (1987); Board of Ed. of Westside
Community Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U. S. 226,
261-262 (1990) (Kennedy, J., concurring). Our decisions in
Engel v. Vitale, 370 U. S. 421 (1962), and School Dist. of
Abington, supra, recognize, among other things, that prayer
exercises in public schools carry a particular risk of indirect
coercion. The concern may not be limited to the context
of schools, but it is most pronounced there. See County of
Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater
Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S., at 661 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). What to
most believers may seem nothing more than a reasonable
request that the nonbeliever respect their religious practices, in a school context may appear to the nonbeliever or
dissenter to be an attempt to employ the machinery of the
State to enforce a religious orthodoxy.

Opinion of the Court
We need not look beyond the circumstances of this case tosee the phenomenon at work. The undeniable fact is that

the school district's supervision and control of a high schoolgraduation ceremony places public pressure, as well as peer
pressure, on attending students to stand as a group or, at
least, maintain respectful silence during the invocation andbenediction. This pressure, though subtle and indirect, can

be as real as any overt compulsion. Of course, in our culturestanding or remaining silent can signify adherence to a view
or simple respect for the views of others. And no doubtsome persons who have no desire to join a prayer have little
objection to standing as a sign of respect for those who do.
But for the dissenter of high school age, who has a reasonable
perception that she is being forced by the State to pray in a
manner her conscience will not allow, the injury is no less
real. There can be no doubt that for many, if not most, of
the students at the graduation, the act of standing or remaining silent was an expression of participation in the rabbi's
prayer. That was the very point of the religious exercise.
It is of little comfort to a dissenter, then, to be told that for
her the act of standing or remaining in silence signifies mere
respect, rather than participation. What matters is that,
given our social conventions, a reasonable dissenter in this
milieu could believe that the group exercise signified her own
participation or approval of it.

Finding no violation under these circumstances would
place objectors in the dilemma of participating, with all that
implies, or protesting. We do not address whether that
choice is acceptable if the affected citizens are mature adults,
but we think the State may not, consistent with the Establishment Clause, place primary and secondary school children in this position. Research in psychology supports the
common assumption that adolescents are often susceptible to
pressure from their peers towards conformity, and that the
influence is strongest in matters of social convention. Brittain, Adolescent Choices and Parent-Peer Cross-Pressures,

Adolescents, 22 Developmental Psychology 521 (July 1986).To recognize that the choice imposed by the State constitutes an unacceptable constraint only acknowledges that thegovernment may no more use social pressure to enforce
orthodoxy than it may use more direct means.The injury caused by the government's action, and the reason why Daniel and Deborah Weisman object to it, is that
the State, in a school setting, in effect required participation
in a religious exercise. It is, we concede, a brief exercise
during which the individual can concentrate on joining its
message, meditate on her own religion, or let her mind
wander. But the embarrassment and the intrusion of the
religious exercise cannot be refuted by arguing that these
prayers, and similar ones to be said in the future, are of a
de minimis character. To do so would be an affront to the
rabbi who offered them and to all those for whom the prayers
were an essential and profound recognition of divine authority. And for the same reason, we think that the intrusion is
greater than the two minutes or so of time consumed for
prayers like these. Assuming, as we must, that the prayers
were offensive to the student and the parent who now object,
the intrusion was both real and, in the context of a secondary
school, a violation of the objectors' rights. That the intrusion was in the course of promulgating religion that sought
to be civic or nonsectarian rather than pertaining to one sect
does not lessen the offense or isolation to the objectors. At
best it narrows their number, at worst increases their sense
of isolation and affront. See supra, at 593.

There was a stipulation in the District Court that attendance at graduation and promotional ceremonies is voluntary.

Opinion of the Court
the United States, as amicus, made this a center point of thecase, arguing that the option of not attending the graduation

excuses any inducement or coercion in the ceremony itself.The argument lacks all persuasion. Law reaches past formalism. And to say a teenage student has a real choice not
to attend her high school graduation is formalistic in the ex-treme. True, Deborah could elect not to attend commencement without renouncing her diploma; but we shall not allowthe case to turn on this point. Everyone knows that in our
society and in our culture high school graduation is one oflife's most significant occasions. A school rule which excuses attendance is beside the point. Attendance may not
be required by official decree, yet it is apparent that a student is not free to absent herself from the graduation exercise in any real sense of the term "voluntary," for absence
would require forfeiture of those intangible benefits which
have motivated the student through youth and all her high
school years. Graduation is a time for family and those closest to the student to celebrate success and express mutual
wishes of gratitude and respect, all to the end of impressing
upon the young person the role that it is his or her right and
duty to assume in the community and all of its diverse parts.

The importance of the event is the point the school district
and the United States rely upon to argue that a formal
prayer ought to be permitted, but it becomes one of the principal reasons why their argument must fail. Their contention, one of considerable force were it not for the constitutional constraints applied to state action, is that the prayers
are an essential part of these ceremonies because for many
persons an occasion of this significance lacks meaning if there
is no recognition, however brief, that human achievements
cannot be understood apart from their spiritual essence.
We think the Government's position that this interest suffices to force students to choose between compliance or forfeiture demonstrates fundamental inconsistency in its argumentation. It fails to acknowledge that what for many of

505us2110L 04-22-99 18:56:59 PAGES OPINPGT
596 LEE v. WEISMAN

Opinion of the Court
Deborah's classmates and their parents was a spiritual im-perative was for Daniel and Deborah Weisman religious conformance compelled by the State. While in some societiesthe wishes of the majority might prevail, the Establishment
Clause of the First Amendment is addressed to this contingency and rejects the balance urged upon us. The Constitu-tion forbids the State to exact religious conformity from a

student as the price of attending her own high school gradua-tion. This is the calculus the Constitution commands.

The Government's argument gives insufficient recognitionto the real conflict of conscience faced by the young student.
The essence of the Government's position is that with regard
to a civic, social occasion of this importance it is the objector,
not the majority, who must take unilateral and private action
to avoid compromising religious scruples, hereby electing to
miss the graduation exercise. This turns conventional First
Amendment analysis on its head. It is a tenet of the First
Amendment that the State cannot require one of its citizens
to forfeit his or her rights and benefits as the price of resisting conformance to state-sponsored religious practice. To
say that a student must remain apart from the ceremony
at the opening invocation and closing benediction is to risk
compelling conformity in an environment analogous to the
classroom setting, where we have said the risk of compulsion
is especially high. See supra, at 593-594. Just as in Engel
v. Vitale, 370 U. S., at 430, and School Dist. of Abington v.
Schempp, 374 U. S., at 224-225, where we found that provisions within the challenged legislation permitting a student
to be voluntarily excused from attendance or participation
in the daily prayers did not shield those practices from invalidation, the fact that attendance at the graduation ceremonies is voluntary in a legal sense does not save the religious
exercise.

Inherent differences between the public school system and
a session of a state legislature distinguish this case from
Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783 (1983). The considera505us2110L 04-22-99 18:56:59 PAGES OPINPGT

597Cite as: 505 U. S. 577 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
tions we have raised in objection to the invocation and bene-diction are in many respects similar to the arguments we

considered in Marsh. But there are also obvious differ-ences. The atmosphere at the opening of a session of a state
legislature where adults are free to enter and leave with little comment and for any number of reasons cannot comparewith the constraining potential of the one school event most

important for the student to attend. The influence and forceof a formal exercise in a school graduation are far greater
than the prayer exercise we condoned in Marsh. The
Marsh majority in fact gave specific recognition to this distinction and placed particular reliance on it in upholding the
prayers at issue there. 463 U. S., at 792. Today's case is
different. At a high school graduation, teachers and principals must and do retain a high degree of control over the
precise contents of the program, the speeches, the timing,
the movements, the dress, and the decorum of the students.
Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U. S. 675 (1986).
In this atmosphere the state-imposed character of an invocation and benediction by clergy selected by the school combine to make the prayer a state-sanctioned religious exercise
in which the student was left with no alternative but to
submit. This is different from Marsh and suffices to make
the religious exercise a First Amendment violation. Our
Establishment Clause jurisprudence remains a delicate and
fact-sensitive one, and we cannot accept the parallel relied
upon by petitioners and the United States between the facts
of Marsh and the case now before us. Our decisions in
Engel v. Vitale, supra, and School Dist. of Abington v.
Schempp, supra, require us to distinguish the public school
context.

We do not hold that every state action implicating religion
is invalid if one or a few citizens find it offensive. People
may take offense at all manner of religious as well as nonreligious messages, but offense alone does not in every case
show a violation. We know too that sometimes to endure

505us2110L 04-22-99 18:56:59 PAGES OPINPGT
598 LEE v. WEISMAN

Opinion of the Court
social isolation or even anger may be the price of conscienceor nonconformity. But, by any reading of our cases, the conformity required of the student in this case was too high anexaction to withstand the test of the Establishment Clause.
The prayer exercises in this case are especially improper because the State has in every practical sense compelled at-tendance and participation in an explicit religious exercise at

an event of singular importance to every student, one theobjecting student had no real alternative to avoid.

Our jurisprudence in this area is of necessity one of line-drawing, of determining at what point a dissenter's rights of
religious freedom are infringed by the State.

"The First Amendment does not prohibit practices
which by any realistic measure create none of the dan-gers which it is designed to prevent and which do not so

directly or substantially involve the state in religiousexercises or in the favoring of religion as to have meaningful and practical impact. It is of course true that
great consequences can grow from small beginnings, butthe measure of constitutional adjudication is the ability

and willingness to distinguish between real threat andmere shadow."

School Dist. of Abington v. Schempp,
supra, at 308 (Goldberg, J., concurring).

Our society would be less than true to its heritage if it
lacked abiding concern for the values of its young people, andwe acknowledge the profound belief of adherents to many

faiths that there must be a place in the student's life forprecepts of a morality higher even than the law we today
enforce. We express no hostility to those aspirations, nor
would our oath permit us to do so. A relentless and allpervasive attempt to exclude religion from every aspect of
public life could itself become inconsistent with the Constitution. See School Dist. of Abington, supra, at 306 (Goldberg,

throughout the course of the educational process, there will

(1990). But these matters, often questions of accommoda-tion of religion, are not before us. The sole question presented is whether a religious exercise may be conducted ata graduation ceremony in circumstances where, as we have
found, young graduates who object are induced to conform.No holding by this Court suggests that a school can persuade
or compel a student to participate in a religious exercise.That is being done here, and it is forbidden by the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.For the reasons we have stated, the judgment of the Court
of Appeals is Affirmed.

Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice Stevens and
Justice O'Connor join, concurring.

Nearly half a century of review and refinement of Estab-lishment Clause jurisprudence has distilled one clear understanding: Government may neither promote nor affiliate it-self with any religious doctrine or organization, nor may it
obtrude itself in the internal affairs of any religious institu-tion. The application of these principles to the present case
mandates the decision reached today by the Court.

This Court first reviewed a challenge to state law underthe Establishment Clause in

Everson v. Board of Ed. of
Ewing, 330 U. S. 1 (1947).1 Relying on the history of the

1 A few earlier cases involving federal laws touched on interpretation of
the Establishment Clause. In Reynolds v. United States, 98 U. S. 145
(1879), and Davis v. Beason, 133 U. S. 333 (1890), the Court considered the
Clause in the context of federal laws prohibiting bigamy. The Court in
Reynolds accepted Thomas Jefferson's letter to the Danbury Baptist Asso505us2110F 04-22-99 18:56:59 PAGES OPINPGT

Clause, and the Court's prior analysis, Justice Black outlinedthe considerations that have become the touchstone of Establishment Clause jurisprudence: Neither a State nor theFederal Government can pass laws which aid one religion,
aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another. Neither a State nor the Federal Government, openly or secretly,
can participate in the affairs of any religious organization
and vice versa.2 "In the words of Jefferson, the clause

ciation "almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect" of
the First Amendment. 98 U. S., at 164. In that letter Jefferson penned
his famous lines that the Establishment Clause built "a wall of separation
between church and State." Ibid. Davis considered that "[t]he first
amendment to the Constitution . . . was intended . . . to prohibit legislation
for the support of any religious tenets, or the modes of worship of any
sect." 133 U. S., at 342. In another case, Bradfield v. Roberts, 175 U. S.
291 (1899), the Court held that it did not violate the Establishment Clause
for Congress to construct a hospital building for caring for poor patients,
although the hospital was managed by sisters of the Roman Catholic
Church. The Court reasoned: "That the influence of any particular church
may be powerful over the members of a non-sectarian and secular corporation, incorporated for a certain defined purpose and with clearly stated
powers, is surely not sufficient to convert such a corporation into a religious or sectarian body." Id., at 298. Finally, in 1908 the Court held
that "the spirit of the Constitution" did not prohibit the Indians from using
their money, held by the United States Government, for religious education. See Quick Bear v. Leupp, 210 U. S. 50, 81.

2 The Court articulated six examples of paradigmatic practices that the

Establishment Clause prohibits: "The `establishment of religion' clause of
the First Amendment means at least this: Neither a state nor the Federal
Government can set up a church. Neither can pass laws which aid one
religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another. Neither
can force nor influence a person to go to or to remain away from church
against his will or force him to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion.
No person can be punished for entertaining or professing religious beliefs
or disbeliefs, for church attendance or non-attendance. No tax in any
amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or
institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may
adopt to teach or practice religion. Neither a state nor the Federal Government can, openly or secretly, participate in the affairs of any religious

against establishment of religion by law was intended to
erect `a wall of separation between church and State.' "
Everson, 330 U. S., at 16 (quoting Reynolds v. United States,
98 U. S. 145, 164 (1879)). The dissenters agreed: "The
Amendment's purpose . . . was to create a complete and permanent separation of the spheres of religious activity and
civil authority by comprehensively forbidding every form of
public aid or support for religion." 330 U. S., at 31-32 (Rutledge, J., dissenting, joined by Frankfurter, Jackson, and
Burton, JJ.).

In Engel v. Vitale, 370 U. S. 421 (1962), the Court considered for the first time the constitutionality of prayer in a
public school. Students said aloud a short prayer selected
by the State Board of Regents: " `Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings
upon us, our parents, our teachers and our Country.' " Id.,
at 422. Justice Black, writing for the Court, again made
clear that the First Amendment forbids the use of the power
or prestige of the government to control, support, or influence the religious beliefs and practices of the American
people. Although the prayer was "denominationally neutral" and "its observance on the part of the students [was]
voluntary," id., at 430, the Court found that it violated this
essential precept of the Establishment Clause.

A year later, the Court again invalidated governmentsponsored prayer in public schools in School Dist. of Abington v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203 (1963). In Schempp, the
school day for Baltimore, Maryland, and Abington Township,
Pennsylvania, students began with a reading from the Bible,
or a recitation of the Lord's Prayer, or both. After a
thorough review of the Court's prior Establishment Clause
cases, the Court concluded:

Blackmun, J., concurring
"[T]he Establishment Clause has been directly consid-ered by this Court eight times in the past score of years

and, with only one Justice dissenting on the point, it hasconsistently held that the clause withdrew all legislative power respecting religious belief or the expressionthereof. The test may be stated as follows: what are
the purpose and the primary effect of the enactment?If either is the advancement or inhibition of religion,
then the enactment exceeds the scope of legislativepower as circumscribed by the Constitution."

Id., at222.

Because the schools' opening exercises were government-sponsored religious ceremonies, the Court found that the
primary effect was the advancement of religion and held,therefore, that the activity violated the Establishment
Clause. Id., at 223-224.Five years later, the next time the Court considered
whether religious activity in public schools violated the Es-tablishment Clause, it reiterated the principle that government "may not aid, foster, or promote one religion or reli-gious theory against another or even against the militant
opposite." Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U. S. 97, 104 (1968)." `If [the purpose or primary effect] is the advancement or
inhibition of religion then the enactment exceeds the scopeof legislative power as circumscribed by the Constitution.' "
Id., at 107 (quoting Schempp, 374 U. S., at 222). Findingthat the Arkansas law aided religion by preventing the
teaching of evolution, the Court invalidated it.In 1971, Chief Justice Burger reviewed the Court's past
decisions and found: "Three . . . tests may be gleaned fromour cases."

Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 612. Inorder for a statute to survive an Establishment Clause challenge, "[f]irst, the statute must have a secular legislativepurpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one

religion." Id., at 612-613 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).3 After Lemon, the Court continued to rely
on these basic principles in resolving Establishment Clause
disputes.4

Application of these principles to the facts of this case is
straightforward. There can be "no doubt" that the "invocation of God's blessings" delivered at Nathan Bishop Middle
School "is a religious activity." Engel, 370 U. S., at 424. In
the words of Engel, the rabbi's prayer "is a solemn avowal
of divine faith and supplication for the blessings of the
Almighty. The nature of such a prayer has always been
religious." Id., at 424-425. The question then is whether
the government has "plac[ed] its official stamp of approval"
on the prayer. Id., at 429. As the Court ably demonstrates,
when the government "compose[s] official prayers," id., at
425, selects the member of the clergy to deliver the prayer,
has the prayer delivered at a public school event that is
planned, supervised, and given by school officials, and pres3 The final prong, excessive entanglement, was a focus of Walz v. Tax
Comm'n of New York City, 397 U. S. 664, 674 (1970), but harkens back to
the final example in Everson: "Neither a state nor the Federal Government can, openly or secretly, participate in the affairs of any religious
organizations or groups and vice versa." Everson, 330 U. S., at 16. The
discussion in Everson reflected the Madisonian concern that secular and
religious authorities must not interfere with each other's respective
spheres of choice and influence. See generally The Complete Madison
298-312 (S. Padover ed. 1953).

4 Since 1971, the Court has decided 31 Establishment Clause cases. In

only one instance, the decision of Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783 (1983),
has the Court not rested its decision on the basic principles described in
Lemon. For example, in the most recent Establishment Clause case,
Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496
U. S. 226 (1990), the Court applied the three-part Lemon analysis to the
Equal Access Act, which made it unlawful for public secondary schools
to deny equal access to any student wishing to hold religious meetings.
Id., at 248-253 (plurality opinion); id., at 262 (Marshall, J., concurring in
judgment). In no case involving religious activities in public schools
has the Court failed to apply vigorously the Lemon factors.

sures students to attend and participate in the prayer, therecan be no doubt that the government is advancing and promoting religion.5 As our prior decisions teach us, it is thisthat the Constitution prohibits.

II
I join the Court's opinion today because I find nothing in itinconsistent with the essential precepts of the Establishment

Clause developed in our precedents. The Court holds thatthe graduation prayer is unconstitutional because the State
"in effect required participation in a religious exercise."
Ante, at 594. Although our precedents make clear that proofof government coercion is not necessary to prove an Establishment Clause violation, it is sufficient. Government pres-sure to participate in a religious activity is an obvious indication that the government is endorsing or promoting religion.But it is not enough that the government restrain from
compelling religious practices: It must not engage in themeither. See

Schempp, 374 U. S., at 305 (Goldberg, J., concur-ring). The Court repeatedly has recognized that a violation

of the Establishment Clause is not predicated on coercion.See,

e. g., id., at 223; id., at 229 (Douglas, J., concurring); Wal-lace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 72 (1985) (

O'Connor, J., concur-ring in judgment) ("The decisions [in

schemes, but they expressly turned only on the fact that thegovernment was sponsoring a manifestly religious exercise"

66) v. Mergens, 496 U. S. 226, 261 (1990) (Kennedy, J., con-curring in part and concurring in judgment).

The scope of the Establishment Clause's prohibitions de-veloped in our case law derives from the Clause's purposes.
The First Amendment encompasses two distinct guaran-tees--the government shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercisethereof--both with the common purpose of securing religious liberty.7 Through vigorous enforcement of bothClauses, we "promote and assure the fullest possible scope
of religious liberty and tolerance for all and . . . nurture the
conditions which secure the best hope of attainment of thatend."

Schempp, 374 U. S., at 305 (Goldberg, J., concurring).
There is no doubt that attempts to aid religion throughgovernment coercion jeopardize freedom of conscience.

Even subtle pressure diminishes the right of each individualto choose voluntarily what to believe. Representative Carroll explained during congressional debate over the Estab6 As a practical matter, of course, anytime the government endorses a
religious belief there will almost always be some pressure to conform.
"When the power, prestige and financial support of government is placed
behind a particular religious belief, the indirect coercive pressure upon
religious minorities to conform to the prevailing officially approved religion is plain." Engel v. Vitale, 370 U. S. 421, 431 (1962).

7 See, e. g., Everson, 330 U. S., at 40 (Rutledge, J., dissenting) (" `Establishment' and `free exercise' were correlative and coextensive ideas, representing only different facets of the single great and fundamental freedom"); School Dist. of Abington v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203, 227 (1963)

lishment Clause: "[T]he rights of conscience are, in their na-ture, of peculiar delicacy, and will little bear the gentlest

touch of governmental hand." 1 Annals of Cong. 757 (1789).Our decisions have gone beyond prohibiting coercion, however, because the Court has recognized that "the fullest pos-sible scope of religious liberty,"

Schempp, 374 U. S., at 305(Goldberg, J., concurring), entails more than freedom from

coercion. The Establishment Clause protects religious lib-erty on a grand scale; it is a social compact that guarantees
for generations a democracy and a strong religious commu-nity--both essential to safeguarding religious liberty. "Our
fathers seem to have been perfectly sincere in their beliefthat the members of the Church would be more patriotic,
and the citizens of the State more religious, by keeping theirrespective functions entirely separate." Religious Liberty,
in Essays and Speeches of Jeremiah S. Black 53 (C. Black ed.1885) (Chief Justice of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania).

The mixing of government and religion can be a threat tofree government, even if no one is forced to participate.

When the government puts its imprimatur on a particularreligion, it conveys a message of exclusion to all those who
do not adhere to the favored beliefs.9 A government cannot

affairs, it abandons its obligation as guarantor of democracy.Democracy requires the nourishment of dialog and dissent,
while religious faith puts its trust in an ultimate divine au-thority above all human deliberation. When the government appropriates religious truth, it "transforms rational de-bate into theological decree." Nuechterlein, Note, The Free

James Madison stated the theory even more strongly in his "Memorial and
Remonstrance" against a bill providing tax funds to religious teachers: "It
degrades from the equal rank of Citizens all those whose opinions in Religion do not bend to those of the Legislative authority. Distant as it may
be, in its present form, from the Inquisition it differs from it only in degree. The one is the first step, the other the last in the career of intolerance." The Complete Madison, at 303. Religion has not lost its power
to engender divisiveness. "Of all the issues the ACLU takes on--reproductive rights, discrimination, jail and prison conditions, abuse of kids in
the public schools, police brutality, to name a few--by far the most volatile
issue is that of school prayer. Aside from our efforts to abolish the death
penalty, it is the only issue that elicits death threats." Parish, Graduation

Madison warned that government officials who would use
religious authority to pursue secular ends "exceed the commission from which they derive their authority and are Tyrants. The People who submit to it are governed by laws
made neither by themselves, nor by an authority derived
from them, and are slaves." Memorial and Remonstrance
against Religious Assessments (1785), in The Complete Madison 300 (S. Padover ed. 1953). Democratic government will
not last long when proclamation replaces persuasion as the
medium of political exchange.

Likewise, we have recognized that "[r]eligion flourishes in
greater purity, without than with the aid of Gov[ernment]." 11
Id., at 309. To "make room for as wide a variety of beliefs
and creeds as the spiritual needs of man deem necessary,"
Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U. S. 306, 313 (1952), the government
must not align itself with any one of them. When the government favors a particular religion or sect, the disadvantage to all others is obvious, but even the favored religion
may fear being "taint[ed] . . . with a corrosive secularism."
School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373, 385
(1985). The favored religion may be compromised as political figures reshape the religion's beliefs for their own purposes; it may be reformed as government largesse brings
government regulation.12 Keeping religion in the hands of
private groups minimizes state intrusion on religious choice
and best enables each religion to "flourish according to the

zeal of its adherents and the appeal of its dogma." Zorach,343 U. S., at 313.

It is these understandings and fears that underlie our Es-tablishment Clause jurisprudence. We have believed that
religious freedom cannot exist in the absence of a free demo-cratic government, and that such a government cannot endure when there is fusion between religion and the politicalregime. We have believed that religious freedom cannot
thrive in the absence of a vibrant religious community andthat such a community cannot prosper when it is bound to
the secular. And we have believed that these were the ani-mating principles behind the adoption of the Establishment
Clause. To that end, our cases have prohibited governmentendorsement of religion, its sponsorship, and active involvement in religion, whether or not citizens were coerced toconform.

I remain convinced that our jurisprudence is not mis-guided, and that it requires the decision reached by the
Court today. Accordingly, I join the Court in affirming thejudgment of the Court of Appeals.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens and
Justice O'Connor join, concurring.

I join the whole of the Court's opinion, and fully agree thatprayers at public school graduation ceremonies indirectly coerce religious observance. I write separately nonethelesson two issues of Establishment Clause analysis that underlie
my independent resolution of this case: whether the Clauseapplies to governmental practices that do not favor one religion or denomination over others, and whether state coer-cion of religious conformity, over and above state endorsement of religious exercise or belief, is a necessary elementof an Establishment Clause violation.

Establishment Clause forbids not only state practices that"aid one religion . . . or prefer one religion over another,"

but also those that "aid all religions." Everson v. Board ofEd. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1, 15 (1947). Today we reaffirm that
principle, holding that the Establishment Clause forbidsstate-sponsored prayers in public school settings no matter
how nondenominational the prayers may be. In barring theState from sponsoring generically theistic prayers where it
could not sponsor sectarian ones, we hold true to a line ofprecedent from which there is no adequate historical case
to depart. A

Since Everson, we have consistently held the Clause appli-cable no less to governmental acts favoring religion generally than to acts favoring one religion over others.1 Thus,in

Engel v. Vitale, 370 U. S. 421 (1962), we held that the pub-lic schools may not subject their students to readings of any

prayer, however "denominationally neutral." Id., at 430.More recently, in Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38 (1985), we
held that an Alabama moment-of-silence statute passed forthe sole purpose of "returning voluntary prayer to public
schools," id., at 57, violated the Establishment Clause eventhough it did not encourage students to pray to any particular deity. We said that "when the underlying principle hasbeen examined in the crucible of litigation, the Court has
unambiguously concluded that the individual freedom ofconscience protected by the First Amendment embraces
the right to select any religious faith or none at all." Id.,at 52-53. This conclusion, we held,

"derives support not only from the interest in respectingthe individual's freedom of conscience, but also from the
conviction that religious beliefs worthy of respect arethe product of free and voluntary choice by the faithful,

and from recognition of the fact that the political interest in forestalling intolerance extends beyond intolerance among Christian sects--or even intolerance among
`religions'--to encompass intolerance of the disbeliever
and the uncertain." Id., at 53-54 (footnotes omitted).

Likewise, in Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U. S. 1
(1989), we struck down a state tax exemption benefiting only
religious periodicals; even though the statute in question
worked no discrimination among sects, a majority of the
Court found that its preference for religious publications
over all other kinds "effectively endorses religious belief."
Id., at 17 (plurality opinion); see id., at 28 (Blackmun, J.,
concurring in judgment) ("A statutory preference for the dissemination of religious ideas offends our most basic understanding of what the Establishment Clause is all about and
hence is constitutionally intolerable"). And in Torcaso v.
Watkins, 367 U. S. 488 (1961), we struck down a provision of
the Maryland Constitution requiring public officials to declare a " `belief in the existence of God,' " id., at 489, reasoning that, under the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment, "neither a State nor the Federal Government . . . can
constitutionally pass laws or impose requirements which aid
all religions as against non-believers . . . ," id., at 495. See
also Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U. S. 97, 104 (1968) ("The
First Amendment mandates governmental neutrality between religion and religion, and between religion and nonreligion"); School Dist. of Abington v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203,

320 (Stewart, J., dissenting) (the Clause applies "to each of
us, be he Jew or Agnostic, Christian or Atheist, Buddhist
or Freethinker").

Such is the settled law. Here, as elsewhere, we should
stick to it absent some compelling reason to discard it. See

Some have challenged this precedent by reading the Es-tablishment Clause to permit "nonpreferential" state promotion of religion. The challengers argue that, as originallyunderstood by the Framers, "[t]he Establishment Clause
did not require government neutrality between religionand irreligion nor did it prohibit the Federal Government
from providing nondiscriminatory aid to religion." Wallace,
supra, at 106 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting); see also R. Cord,Separation of Church and State: Historical Fact and Current

Fiction (1988). While a case has been made for this position,it is not so convincing as to warrant reconsideration of our
settled law; indeed, I find in the history of the Clause's tex-tual development a more powerful argument supporting the
Court's jurisprudence following Everson.When James Madison arrived at the First Congress with
a series of proposals to amend the National Constitution, oneof the provisions read that "[t]he civil rights of none shall be
abridged on account of religious belief or worship, nor shallany national religion be established, nor shall the full and
equal rights of conscience be in any manner, or on any pre-text, infringed." 1 Annals of Cong. 434 (1789). Madison's
language did not last long. It was sent to a Select Commit-tee of the House, which, without explanation, changed it to
read that "no religion shall be established by law, nor shallthe equal rights of conscience be infringed." Id., at 729.
Thence the proposal went to the Committee of the Whole,which was in turn dissatisfied with the Select Committee's
language and adopted an alternative proposed by SamuelLivermore of New Hampshire: "Congress shall make no laws
touching religion, or infringing the rights of conscience."See

id., at 731. Livermore's proposal would have forbiddenlaws having anything to do with religion and was thus not

only far broader than Madison's version, but broader eventhan the scope of the Establishment Clause as we now understand it. See, e. g., Corporation of Presiding Bishop of
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos, 483
U. S. 327 (1987) (upholding legislative exemption of religious
groups from certain obligations under civil rights laws).The House rewrote the amendment once more before sending it to the Senate, this time adopting, without recordeddebate, language derived from a proposal by Fisher Ames
of Massachusetts: "Congress shall make no law establishingReligion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, nor shall
the rights of conscience be infringed." 1 Documentary History of the First Federal Congress of the United States of
America 136 (Senate Journal) (L. de Pauw ed. 1972); see 1
Annals of Cong. 765 (1789). Perhaps, on further reflection,
the Representatives had thought Livermore's proposal too
expansive, or perhaps, as one historian has suggested, they
had simply worried that his language would not "satisfy the
demands of those who wanted something said specifically
against establishments of religion." L. Levy, The Establishment Clause 81 (1986) (hereinafter Levy). We do not know;
what we do know is that the House rejected the Select Committee's version, which arguably ensured only that "no
religion" enjoyed an official preference over others, and deliberately chose instead a prohibition extending to laws establishing "religion" in general.

The sequence of the Senate's treatment of this House proposal, and the House's response to the Senate, confirm that
the Framers meant the Establishment Clause's prohibition
to encompass nonpreferential aid to religion. In September
1789, the Senate considered a number of provisions that
would have permitted such aid, and ultimately it adopted one
of them. First, it briefly entertained this language: "Congress shall make no law establishing One Religious Sect or
Society in preference to others, nor shall the rights of conscience be infringed." See 1 Documentary History, at 151

(Senate Journal); id., at 136. After rejecting two minoramendments to that proposal, see id., at 151, the Senate

dropped it altogether and chose a provision identical to theHouse's proposal, but without the clause protecting the
"rights of conscience," ibid. With no record of the Senatedebates, we cannot know what prompted these changes, but
the record does tell us that, six days later, the Senate wenthalf circle and adopted its narrowest language yet: "Congress shall make no law establishing articles of faith or amode of worship, or prohibiting the free exercise of religion."
Id., at 166. The Senate sent this proposal to the Housealong with its versions of the other constitutional amendments proposed.Though it accepted much of the Senate's work on the Bill
of Rights, the House rejected the Senate's version of the Es-tablishment Clause and called for a joint conference committee, to which the Senate agreed. The House conferees ulti-mately won out, persuading the Senate to accept this as the
final text of the Religion Clauses: "Congress shall make no
law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibitingthe free exercise thereof." What is remarkable is that, unlike the earliest House drafts or the final Senate proposal,the prevailing language is not limited to laws respecting an
establishment of "a religion," "a national religion," "one reli-gious sect," or specific "articles of faith."

2 The Framers re2 Some commentators have suggested that by targeting laws respecting
"an" establishment of religion, the Framers adopted the very nonpreferentialist position whose much clearer articulation they repeatedly rejected.
See, e. g., R. Cord, Separation of Church and State 11-12 (1988). Yet the
indefinite article before the word "establishment" is better seen as evidence that the Clause forbids any kind of establishment, including a nonpreferential one. If the Framers had wished, for some reason, to use the
indefinite term to achieve a narrow meaning for the Clause, they could
far more aptly have placed it before the word "religion." See Laycock,
"Nonpreferential" Aid to Religion: A False Claim About Original Intent,
27 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 875, 884-885 (1986) (hereinafter Laycock, "Nonpreferential" Aid).

peatedly considered and deliberately rejected such narrowlanguage and instead extended their prohibition to state support for "religion" in general.Implicit in their choice is the distinction between preferential and nonpreferential establishments, which the weight of
evidence suggests the Framers appreciated. See, e. g., Lay-cock, "Nonpreferential" Aid 902-906; Levy 91-119. But cf.

T. Curry, The First Freedoms 208-222 (1986). Of particu-lar note, the Framers were vividly familiar with efforts in
the Colonies and, later, the States to impose general, nonde-nominational assessments and other incidents of ostensibly
ecumenical establishments. See generally Levy 1-62. The
Virginia statute for religious freedom, written by Jefferson
and sponsored by Madison, captured the separationist response to such measures. Condemning all establishments,
however nonpreferentialist, the statute broadly guaranteed
that "no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any
religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever," including
his own. Act for Establishing Religious Freedom (1785), in
5 The Founders' Constitution 84, 85 (P. Kurland & R. Lerner
eds. 1987). Forcing a citizen to support even his own church
would, among other things, deny "the ministry those temporary rewards, which proceeding from an approbation of their
personal conduct, are an additional incitement to earnest and
unremitting labours for the instruction of mankind." Id., at
84. In general, Madison later added, "religion & Govt. will
both exist in greater purity, the less they are mixed together." Letter from J. Madison to E. Livingston (July 10,
1822), in 5 The Founders' Constitution, at 105, 106.

What we thus know of the Framers' experience underscores the observation of one prominent commentator, that
confining the Establishment Clause to a prohibition on preferential aid "requires a premise that the Framers were extraordinarily bad drafters--that they believed one thing but
adopted language that said something substantially different, and that they did so after repeatedly attending to the

choice of language." Laycock, "Nonpreferential" Aid 882-883; see also

County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 647-648 (1989) (opinion of

Stevens, J.). We must presume, since
there is no conclusive evidence to the contrary, that the
Framers embraced the significance of their textual judg-ment.

3 Thus, on balance, history neither contradicts nor

warrants reconsideration of the settled principle that the Es-tablishment Clause forbids support for religion in general no

less than support for one religion or some.

C
While these considerations are, for me, sufficient to reject
the nonpreferentialist position, one further concern animatesmy judgment. In many contexts, including this one, nonpreferentialism requires some distinction between "sectarian" religious practices and those that would be, by some
measure, ecumenical enough to pass Establishment Clause
muster. Simply by requiring the enquiry, nonpreferentialists invite the courts to engage in comparative theology.
I can hardly imagine a subject less amenable to the compe3 In his dissent in Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38 (1985), The Chief
Justice rested his nonpreferentialist interpretation partly on the postratification actions of the early National Government. Aside from the
willingness of some (but not all) early Presidents to issue ceremonial religious proclamations, which were at worst trivial breaches of the Establishment Clause, see infra, at 630-631, he cited such seemingly preferential
aid as a treaty provision, signed by Jefferson, authorizing federal subsidization of a Roman Catholic priest and church for the Kaskaskia Indians.
472 U. S., at 103. But this proves too much, for if the Establishment
Clause permits a special appropriation of tax money for the religious activities of a particular sect, it forbids virtually nothing. See Laycock, "Nonpreferential" Aid 915. Although evidence of historical practice can indeed
furnish valuable aid in the interpretation of contemporary language, acts
like the one in question prove only that public officials, no matter when
they serve, can turn a blind eye to constitutional principle. See infra,
at 626.

tence of the federal judiciary, or more deliberately to beavoided where possible.

This case is nicely in point. Since the nonpreferentialityof a prayer must be judged by its text,

Justice Blackmun
pertinently observes, ante, at 604, n. 5, that Rabbi Gutterman drew his exhortation " `[t]o do justly, to love mercy, towalk humbly' " straight from the King James version of

Micah, ch. 6, v. 8. At some undefinable point, the similaritiesbetween a state-sponsored prayer and the sacred text of a
specific religion would so closely identify the former with thelatter that even a nonpreferentialist would have to concede
a breach of the Establishment Clause. And even if Micah's
thought is sufficiently generic for most believers, it still embodies a straightforwardly theistic premise, and so does the
rabbi's prayer. Many Americans who consider themselves
religious are not theistic; some, like several of the Framers,
are deists who would question Rabbi Gutterman's plea for
divine advancement of the country's political and moral good.
Thus, a nonpreferentialist who would condemn subjecting
public school graduates to, say, the Anglican liturgy would
still need to explain why the government's preference for
theistic over nontheistic religion is constitutional.

Nor does it solve the problem to say that the State should
promote a "diversity" of religious views; that position would
necessarily compel the government and, inevitably, the
courts to make wholly inappropriate judgments about the
number of religions the State should sponsor and the relative
frequency with which it should sponsor each. In fact, the
prospect would be even worse than that. As Madison observed in criticizing religious Presidential proclamations,
the practice of sponsoring religious messages tends, over
time, "to narrow the recommendation to the standard of
the predominant sect." Madison's "Detached Memoranda,"

Madison's "Detached Memoranda"). We have not changed
much since the days of Madison, and the judiciary should not

willingly enter the political arena to battle the centripetalforce leading from religious pluralism to official preference

for the faith with the most votes.

II
Petitioners rest most of their argument on a theory that,whether or not the Establishment Clause permits extensive

nonsectarian support for religion, it does not forbid the stateto sponsor affirmations of religious belief that coerce neither
support for religion nor participation in religious observance.I appreciate the force of some of the arguments supporting
a "coercion" analysis of the Clause. See generally Countyof Allegheny, supra, at 655-679 (opinion of

Kennedy, J.);McConnell, Coercion: The Lost Element of Establishment,

27 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 933 (1986). But we could not adoptthat reading without abandoning our settled law, a course
that, in my view, the text of the Clause would not readilypermit. Nor does the extratextual evidence of original
meaning stand so unequivocally at odds with the textualpremise inherent in existing precedent that we should fundamentally reconsider our course.

A
Over the years, this Court has declared the invalidity ofmany noncoercive state laws and practices conveying a message of religious endorsement. For example, in County ofAllegheny, supra, we forbade the prominent display of a nativity scene on public property; without contesting the dis-sent's observation that the cre` che coerced no one into accepting or supporting whatever message it proclaimed, fiveMembers of the Court found its display unconstitutional as a
state endorsement of Christianity. Id., at 589-594, 598-602.Likewise, in

Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38 (1985), we struckdown a state law requiring a moment of silence in public

classrooms not because the statute coerced students to par-ticipate in prayer (for it did not), but because the manner of

its enactment "convey[ed] a message of state approval ofprayer activities in the public schools."

Id., at 61; see also
id., at 67-84 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). Cf.
Engel v. Vitale, 370 U. S., at 431 ("When the power, prestige
and financial support of government is placed behind a particular religious belief, the indirect coercive pressure uponreligious minorities to conform to the prevailing officially approved religion is plain. But the purposes underlying theEstablishment Clause go much further than that").

In Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U. S. 97 (1968), we invali-dated a state law that barred the teaching of Darwin's theory
of evolution because, even though the statute obviously did
not coerce anyone to support religion or participate in any
religious practice, it was enacted for a singularly religious
purpose. See also Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578, 593
(1987) (statute requiring instruction in "creation science"
"endorses religion in violation of the First Amendment").
And in School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373
(1985), we invalidated a program whereby the State sent
public school teachers to parochial schools to instruct students on ostensibly nonreligious matters; while the scheme
clearly did not coerce anyone to receive or subsidize religious
instruction, we held it invalid because, among other things,
"[t]he symbolic union of church and state inherent in the
[program] threatens to convey a message of state support for
religion to students and to the general public." Id., at 397;
see also Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U. S., at 17 (plurality opinion) (tax exemption benefiting only religious publications "effectively endorses religious belief "); id., at 28
(Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment) (exemption unconstitutional because State "engaged in preferential support
for the communication of religious messages").

Our precedents may not always have drawn perfectly
straight lines. They simply cannot, however, support the
position that a showing of coercion is necessary to a successful Establishment Clause claim.

Like the provisions about "due" process and "unrea-sonable" searches and seizures, the constitutional language

forbidding laws "respecting an establishment of religion" isnot pellucid. But virtually everyone acknowledges that the
Clause bans more than formal establishments of religion inthe traditional sense, that is, massive state support for religion through, among other means, comprehensive schemesof taxation. See generally Levy 1-62 (discussing such establishments in the Colonies and early States). This muchfollows from the Framers' explicit rejection of simpler provisions prohibiting either the establishment of a religion orlaws "establishing religion" in favor of the broader ban on
laws "respecting an establishment of religion." See supra,at 612-614.

While some argue that the Framers added the word"respecting" simply to foreclose federal interference with
state establishments of religion, see, e. g., Amar, The Billof Rights as a Constitution, 100 Yale L. J. 1131, 1157
(1991), the language sweeps more broadly than that. InMadison's words, the Clause in its final form forbids "everything like" a national religious establishment, see Madison's"Detached Memoranda" 558, and, after incorporation, it
forbids "everything like" a state religious establishment.4Cf. County of Allegheny, 492 U. S., at 649 (opinion of
Stevens, J.). The sweep is broad enough that Madisonhimself characterized congressional provisions for legislative
and military chaplains as unconstitutional "establishments."Madison's "Detached Memoranda" 558-559; see

infra, at624-625, and n. 6.

4 In Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1 (1947), we unanimously incorporated the Establishment Clause into the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and, by so doing, extended its reach
to the actions of States. Id., at 14-15; see also Cantwell v. Connecticut,
310 U. S. 296, 303 (1940) (dictum). Since then, not one Member of this
Court has proposed disincorporating the Clause.

While petitioners insist that the prohibition extends only
to the "coercive" features and incidents of establishment,
they cannot easily square that claim with the constitutional
text. The First Amendment forbids not just laws "respecting an establishment of religion," but also those "prohibiting
the free exercise thereof." Yet laws that coerce nonadherents to "support or participate in any religion or its
exercise," County of Allegheny, supra, at 659-660 (opinion
of Kennedy, J.), would virtually by definition violate their
right to religious free exercise. See Employment Div.,
Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872,
877 (1990) (under Free Exercise Clause, "government may
not compel affirmation of religious belief "), citing Torcaso v.
Watkins, 367 U. S. 488 (1961); see also J. Madison, Memorial
and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments (1785)
(compelling support for religious establishments violates
"free exercise of Religion"), quoted in 5 The Founders' Constitution, at 82, 84. Thus, a literal application of the coercion
test would render the Establishment Clause a virtual nullity,
as petitioners' counsel essentially conceded at oral argument.
Tr. of Oral Arg. 18.

Our cases presuppose as much; as we said in School Dist.
of Abington, "[t]he distinction between the two clauses is
apparent--a violation of the Free Exercise Clause is predicated on coercion while the Establishment Clause violation
need not be so attended." 374 U. S., at 223; see also Laycock, "Nonpreferential" Aid 922 ("If coercion is . . . an
element of the establishment clause, establishment adds
nothing to free exercise"). While one may argue that the
Framers meant the Establishment Clause simply to ornament the First Amendment, cf. T. Curry, The First Freedoms
216-217 (1986), that must be a reading of last resort. Without compelling evidence to the contrary, we should presume
that the Framers meant the Clause to stand for something
more than petitioners attribute to it.

Petitioners argue from the political setting in which theEstablishment Clause was framed, and from the Framers'

own political practices following ratification, that govern-ment may constitutionally endorse religion so long as it does
not coerce religious conformity. The setting and the prac-tices warrant canvassing, but while they yield some evidence
for petitioners' argument, they do not reveal the degree ofconsensus in early constitutional thought that would raise a
threat to stare decisis by challenging the presumption thatthe Establishment Clause adds something to the Free Exercise Clause that follows it.The Framers adopted the Religion Clauses in response to
a long tradition of coercive state support for religion, partic-ularly in the form of tax assessments, but their special antipathy to religious coercion did not exhaust their hostility tothe features and incidents of establishment. Indeed, Jefferson and Madison opposed any political appropriation of reli-gion, see

infra, at 623-626, and, even when challenging thehated assessments, they did not always temper their rhetoric

with distinctions between coercive and noncoercive state ac-tion. When, for example, Madison criticized Virginia's general assessment bill, he invoked principles antithetical to allstate efforts to promote religion. An assessment, he wrote,
is improper not simply because it forces people to donate"three pence" to religion, but, more broadly, because "it is
itself a signal of persecution. It degrades from the equalrank of Citizens all those whose opinions in Religion do not
bend to those of the Legislative authority." J. Madison,Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments
(1785), in 5 The Founders' Constitution, at 83. Madison sawthat, even without the tax collector's participation, an official
endorsement of religion can impair religious liberty.Petitioners contend that because the early Presidents included religious messages in their inaugural and Thanksgiv-ing Day addresses, the Framers could not have meant the

Establishment Clause to forbid noncoercive state endorse-ment of religion. The argument ignores the fact, however,

that Americans today find such proclamations less controver-sial than did the founding generation, whose published
thoughts on the matter belie petitioners' claim. PresidentJefferson, for example, steadfastly refused to issue Thanksgiving proclamations of any kind, in part because he thoughtthey violated the Religion Clauses. Letter from Thomas
Jefferson to Rev. S. Miller (Jan. 23, 1808), in 5 The Founders'Constitution, at 98. In explaining his views to the Reverend
Samuel Miller, Jefferson effectively anticipated, and re-jected, petitioners' position:

"[I]t is only proposed that I should recommend, not pre-scribe a day of fasting & prayer. That is, that I should
indirectly assume to the U. S. an authority over reli-gious exercises which the Constitution has directly precluded from them. It must be meant too that thisrecommendation is to carry some authority, and to be
sanctioned by some penalty on those who disregard it;not indeed of fine and imprisonment, but of some degree
of proscription perhaps in public opinion." Id., at 98-99(emphasis in original).

By condemning such noncoercive state practices that, in"recommending" the majority faith, demean religious dissenters "in public opinion," Jefferson necessarily condemnedwhat, in modern terms, we call official endorsement of religion. He accordingly construed the Establishment Clauseto forbid not simply state coercion, but also state endorsement, of religious belief and observance.5 And if he opposed

5 Petitioners claim that the quoted passage shows that Jefferson regarded Thanksgiving proclamations as "coercive": "Thus, while one may
disagree with Jefferson's view that a recommendatory Thanksgiving proclamation would nonetheless be coercive . . . one cannot disagree that Jefferson believed coercion to be a necessary element of a First Amendment
violation." Brief for Petitioners 34. But this is wordplay. The "proscription" to which Jefferson referred was, of course, by the public and not

impersonal Presidential addresses for inflicting "proscription
in public opinion," all the more would he have condemned
less diffuse expressions of official endorsement.

During his first three years in office, James Madison also
refused to call for days of thanksgiving and prayer, though
later, amid the political turmoil of the War of 1812, he did so
on four separate occasions. See Madison's "Detached Memoranda" 562, and n. 54. Upon retirement, in an essay condemning as an unconstitutional "establishment" the use of
public money to support congressional and military chaplains, id., at 558-560,6 he concluded that "[r]eligious proclathe government, whose only action was a noncoercive recommendation.
And one can call any act of endorsement a form of coercion, but only if
one is willing to dilute the meaning of "coercion" until there is no meaning
left. Jefferson's position straightforwardly contradicts the claim that a
showing of "coercion," under any normal definition, is prerequisite to a
successful Establishment Clause claim. At the same time, Jefferson's
practice, like Madison's, see infra this page and 625, sometimes diverged
from principle, for he did include religious references in his inaugural
speeches. See Inaugural Addresses of the Presidents of the United
States 17, 22-23 (1989); see also n. 3, supra.

Petitioners also seek comfort in a different passage of the same letter.
Jefferson argued that Presidential religious proclamations violate not just
the Establishment Clause, but also the Tenth Amendment, for "what
might be a right in a state government, was a violation of that right when
assumed by another." Letter from Thomas Jefferson to Rev. S. Miller
(Jan. 23, 1808), in 5 The Founders' Constitution 99 (P. Kurland & R. Lerner
eds. 1987). Jefferson did not, however, restrict himself to the Tenth
Amendment in condemning such proclamations by a national officer. I do
not, in any event, understand petitioners to be arguing that the Establishment Clause is exclusively a structural provision mediating the respective
powers of the State and National Governments. Such a position would
entail the argument, which petitioners do not make, and which we would
almost certainly reject, that incorporation of the Establishment Clause
under the Fourteenth Amendment was erroneous.

6 Madison found this practice "a palpable violation of . . . Constitutional

principles." Madison's "Detached Memoranda" 558. Although he sat on
the committee recommending the congressional chaplainship, see R. Cord,

face of congressional pressure cannot erase the principles.He admitted to backsliding, and explained that he had made
the content of his wartime proclamations inconsequentialenough to mitigate much of their impropriety. See

ibid.; seealso Letter from J. Madison to E. Livingston (July 10, 1822),

in 5 The Founders' Constitution, at 105. While his writingssuggest mild variations in his interpretation of the Establishment Clause, Madison was no different in that respectfrom the rest of his political generation. That he expressed
so much doubt about the constitutionality of religious proc-lamations, however, suggests a brand of separationism
stronger even than that embodied in our traditional jurispru-dence. So too does his characterization of public subsidies
for legislative and military chaplains as unconstitutional "es-tablishments," see supra, at 624 and this page, and n. 6, for
the federal courts, however expansive their general view ofthe Establishment Clause, have upheld both practices. See

To be sure, the leaders of the young Republic engaged insome of the practices that separationists like Jefferson and
Madison criticized. The First Congress did hire institutional chaplains, see Marsh v. Chambers, supra, at 788, andPresidents Washington and Adams unapologetically marked

days of " `public thanksgiving and prayer,' " see R. Cord, Sep-aration of Church and State 53 (1988). Yet in the face of the
separationist dissent, those practices prove, at best, that theFramers simply did not share a common understanding of
the Establishment Clause, and, at worst, that they, like other
politicians, could raise constitutional ideals one day and turn
their backs on them the next. "Indeed, by 1787 the provisions of the state bills of rights had become what Madison
called mere `paper parchments'--expressions of the most
laudable sentiments, observed as much in the breach as in
practice." Kurland, The Origins of the Religion Clauses of
the Constitution, 27 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 839, 852 (1986)
(footnote omitted). Sometimes the National Constitution
fared no better. Ten years after proposing the First
Amendment, Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts,
measures patently unconstitutional by modern standards.
If the early Congress's political actions were determinative,
and not merely relevant, evidence of constitutional meaning,
we would have to gut our current First Amendment doctrine
to make room for political censorship.

While we may be unable to know for certain what the
Framers meant by the Clause, we do know that, around the
time of its ratification, a respectable body of opinion supported a considerably broader reading than petitioners urge
upon us. This consistency with the textual considerations
is enough to preclude fundamentally reexamining our settled
law, and I am accordingly left with the task of considering
whether the state practice at issue here violates our traditional understanding of the Clause's proscriptions.

While the Establishment Clause's concept of neutrality isnot self-revealing, our recent cases have invested it with specific content: the State may not favor or endorse either reli-gion generally over nonreligion or one religion over others.
See, e. g., County of Allegheny, 492 U. S., at 589-594, 598-602;

Texas Monthly, 489 U. S., at 17 (plurality opinion); id.,at 28 (

Neutrality Toward Religion, 39 DePaul L. Rev. 993 (1990);cf. Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 612-613 (1971). This
principle against favoritism and endorsement has become thefoundation of Establishment Clause jurisprudence, ensuring
that religious belief is irrelevant to every citizen's standingin the political community, see

County of Allegheny, supra,at 594; J. Madison, Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments (1785), in 5 The Founders' Constitution,at 82-83, and protecting religion from the demeaning effects
of any governmental embrace, see id., at 83. Now, as in theearly Republic, "religion & Govt. will both exist in greater
purity, the less they are mixed together." Letter from J.Madison to E. Livingston (July 10, 1822), in 5 The Founders'
Constitution, at 106. Our aspiration to religious liberty, em-bodied in the First Amendment, permits no other standard.

A
That government must remain neutral in matters of reli-gion does not foreclose it from ever taking religion into account. The State may "accommodate" the free exercise ofreligion by relieving people from generally applicable rules
that interfere with their religious callings. See, e. g., Corpo-ration of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of

Latter-day Saints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327 (1987); see alsoSherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398 (1963). Contrary to the

views of some,7 such accommodation does not necessarilysignify an official endorsement of religious observance over

disbelief.In everyday life, we routinely accommodate religious beliefs that we do not share. A Christian inviting an Orthodox
Jew to lunch might take pains to choose a kosher restaurant;an atheist in a hurry might yield the right of way to an

Amish man steering a horse-drawn carriage. In so acting,we express respect for, but not endorsement of, the fundamental values of others. We act without expressing a posi-tion on the theological merit of those values or of religious
belief in general, and no one perceives us to have taken sucha position.

The government may act likewise. Most religions encourage devotional practices that are at once crucial to the livesof believers and idiosyncratic in the eyes of nonadherents.

By definition, secular rules of general application are drawn
from the nonadherent's vantage and, consequently, fail to
take such practices into account. Yet when enforcement of
such rules cuts across religious sensibilities, as it often does,
it puts those affected to the choice of taking sides between
God and government. In such circumstances, accommodating religion reveals nothing beyond a recognition that general rules can unnecessarily offend the religious conscience
when they offend the conscience of secular society not at all.

respects the centrality of peyote to the lives of certainAmericans. See Note, The Free Exercise Boundaries of

Whatever else may define the scope of accommodation per-missible under the Establishment Clause, one requirement is

clear: accommodation must lift a discernible burden on thefree exercise of religion. See

Concern for the position of religious individuals in themodern regulatory State cannot justify official solicitude
for a religious practice unburdened by general rules; suchgratuitous largesse would effectively favor religion over disbelief. By these lights one easily sees that, in sponsoringthe graduation prayers at issue here, the State has crossed
the line from permissible accommodation to unconstitu-tional establishment.

Religious students cannot complain that omitting prayersfrom their graduation ceremony would, in any realistic sense,
"burden" their spiritual callings. To be sure, many of theminvest this rite of passage with spiritual significance, but
they may express their religious feelings about it before andafter the ceremony. They may even organize a privately
sponsored baccalaureate if they desire the company of like-minded students. Because they accordingly have no need
for the machinery of the State to affirm their beliefs, the

government's sponsorship of prayer at the graduation cere-mony is most reasonably understood as an official endorsement of religion and, in this instance, of theistic religion.One may fairly say, as one commentator has suggested, that
the government brought prayer into the ceremony "preciselybecause some people want a symbolic affirmation that government approves and endorses their religion, and becausemany of the people who want this affirmation place little or
no value on the costs to religious minorities." Laycock,Summary and Synthesis: The Crisis in Religious Liberty, 60
Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 841, 844 (1992).8Petitioners would deflect this conclusion by arguing that
graduation prayers are no different from Presidential reli-gious proclamations and similar official "acknowledgments"
of religion in public life. But religious invocations inThanksgiving Day addresses and the like, rarely noticed, ignored without effort, conveyed over an impersonal medium,and directed at no one in particular, inhabit a pallid zone
worlds apart from official prayers delivered to a captive audi-ence of public school students and their families. Madison
himself respected the difference between the trivial and theserious in constitutional practice. Realizing that his con8 If the State had chosen its graduation day speakers according to wholly
secular criteria, and if one of those speakers (not a state actor) had individually chosen to deliver a religious message, it would have been harder to
attribute an endorsement of religion to the State. Cf. Witters v. Washington Dept. of Services for Blind, 474 U. S. 481 (1986). But that is not our
case. Nor is this a case where the State has, without singling out religious groups or individuals, extended benefits to them as members of
a broad class of beneficiaries defined by clearly secular criteria. See
Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263, 274-275 (1981); Walz, supra, at 696
(opinion of Harlan, J.) ("In any particular case the critical question is
whether the circumference of legislation encircles a class so broad that it
can be fairly concluded that religious institutions could be thought to fall
within the natural perimeter"). Finally, this is not a case like Marsh v.
Chambers, 463 U. S. 783 (1983), in which government officials invoke spiritual inspiration entirely for their own benefit without directing any religious message at the citizens they lead.

public school officials, armed with the State's authority,convey an endorsement of religion to their students, they
strike near the core of the Establishment Clause. How-ever "ceremonial" their messages may be, they are flatly
unconstitutional.

Three Terms ago, I joined an opinion recognizing that the
Establishment Clause must be construed in light of the
"[g]overnment policies of accommodation, acknowledgment,
and support for religion [that] are an accepted part of our
political and cultural heritage." That opinion affirmed that
"the meaning of the Clause is to be determined by reference
to historical practices and understandings." It said that "[a]
test for implementing the protections of the Establishment
Clause that, if applied with consistency, would invalidate
longstanding traditions cannot be a proper reading of the
Clause." County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties

(1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).

These views of course prevent me from joining today's
opinion, which is conspicuously bereft of any reference to
history. In holding that the Establishment Clause prohibits
invocations and benedictions at public school graduation ceremonies, the Court--with nary a mention that it is doing

so--lays waste a tradition that is as old as public school grad-uation ceremonies themselves, and that is a component of an

even more longstanding American tradition of nonsectarianprayer to God at public celebrations generally. As its instrument of destruction, the bulldozer of its social engineer-ing, the Court invents a boundless, and boundlessly manipulable, test of psychological coercion, which promises to do forthe Establishment Clause what the

Durham rule did for theinsanity defense. See Durham v. United States, 94 U. S.

App. D. C. 228, 214 F. 2d 862 (1954). Today's opinion showsmore forcefully than volumes of argumentation why our
Nation's protection, that fortress which is our Constitution,cannot possibly rest upon the changeable philosophical predilections of the Justices of this Court, but must have deepfoundations in the historic practices of our people.

Justice Holmes' aphorism that "a page of history is wortha volume of logic,"

New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, 256 U. S.345, 349 (1921), applies with particular force to our Establishment Clause jurisprudence. As we have recognized, our in-terpretation of the Establishment Clause should "compor[t]

Establishment Clause. Walz v. Tax Comm'n of New York
City, 397 U. S. 664, 681 (1970) (Brennan, J., concurring).

The history and tradition of our Nation are replete withpublic ceremonies featuring prayers of thanksgiving and petition. Illustrations of this point have been amply provided
in our prior opinions, see, e. g., Lynch, supra, at 674-678;
Marsh, supra, at 786-788; see also Wallace v. Jaffree, 472
U. S. 38, 100-103 (1985) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting); Engel v.
Vitale, 370 U. S. 421, 446-450, and n. 3 (1962) (Stewart, J.,
dissenting), but since the Court is so oblivious to our historyas to suggest that the Constitution restricts "preservation

and transmission of religious beliefs . . . to the privatesphere,"

ante, at 589, it appears necessary to provide another
brief account.

From our Nation's origin, prayer has been a prominentpart of governmental ceremonies and proclamations. The

Declaration of Independence, the document marking ourbirth as a separate people, "appeal[ed] to the Supreme Judge
of the world for the rectitude of our intentions" and avowed"a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence." In
his first inaugural address, after swearing his oath of officeon a Bible, George Washington deliberately made a prayer a
part of his first official act as President:

"[I]t would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first
official act my fervent supplications to that AlmightyBeing who rules over the universe, who presides in the

councils of nations, and whose providential aids can supply every human defect, that His benediction may conse-crate to the liberties and happiness of the people of the

United States a Government instituted by themselves
for these essential purposes." Inaugural Addresses of
the Presidents of the United States, S. Doc. 101-10,
p. 2 (1989).

Such supplications have been a characteristic feature of inaugural addresses ever since. Thomas Jefferson, for example,

505us2110K 04-22-99 18:57:00 PAGES OPINPGT
634 LEE v. WEISMAN

Scalia, J., dissenting
prayed in his first inaugural address: "[M]ay that Infinite
Power which rules the destinies of the universe lead our
councils to what is best, and give them a favorable issue for
your peace and prosperity." Id., at 17. In his second inaugural address, Jefferson acknowledged his need for divine
guidance and invited his audience to join his prayer:

"I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands
we are, who led our fathers, as Israel of old, from their
native land and planted them in a country flowing with
all the necessaries and comforts of life; who has covered
our infancy with His providence and our riper years
with His wisdom and power, and to whose goodness I
ask you to join in supplications with me that He will so
enlighten the minds of your servants, guide their councils, and prosper their measures that whatsoever they
do shall result in your good, and shall secure to you the
peace, friendship, and approbation of all nations." Id.,
at 22-23.

Similarly, James Madison, in his first inaugural address,
placed his confidence

"in the guardianship and guidance of that Almighty
Being whose power regulates the destiny of nations,
whose blessings have been so conspicuously dispensed
to this rising Republic, and to whom we are bound to
address our devout gratitude for the past, as well as our
fervent supplications and best hopes for the future."
Id., at 28.

Most recently, President Bush, continuing the tradition established by President Washington, asked those attending
his inauguration to bow their heads, and made a prayer his
first official act as President. Id., at 346.

Our national celebration of Thanksgiving likewise dates
back to President Washington. As we recounted in Lynch:

635Cite as: 505 U. S. 577 (1992)
Scalia, J., dissenting
"The day after the First Amendment was proposed,Congress urged President Washington to proclaim `a

day of public thanksgiving and prayer, to be observed byacknowledging with grateful hearts the many and signal
favours of Almighty God.' President Washington pro-claimed November 26, 1789, a day of thanksgiving to
`offe[r] our prayers and supplications to the Great Lordand Ruler of Nations, and beseech Him to pardon our
national and other transgressions . . . .' " 465 U. S., at675, n. 2 (citations omitted).

This tradition of Thanksgiving Proclamations--with theirreligious theme of prayerful gratitude to God--has been
adhered to by almost every President. Id., at 675, and nn. 2and 3;

Wallace v. Jaffree, supra, at 100-103 (Rehnquist, J.,dissenting).

The other two branches of the Federal Government alsohave a long-established practice of prayer at public events.
As we detailed in Marsh, congressional sessions have openedwith a chaplain's prayer ever since the First Congress. 463
U. S., at 787-788. And this Court's own sessions haveopened with the invocation "God save the United States and
this Honorable Court" since the days of Chief Justice Mar-shall. 1 C. Warren, The Supreme Court in United States
History 469 (1922).In addition to this general tradition of prayer at public
ceremonies, there exists a more specific tradition of invoca-tions and benedictions at public school graduation exercises.
By one account, the first public high school graduation cere-mony took place in Connecticut in July 1868--the very
month, as it happens, that the Fourteenth Amendment (thevehicle by which the Establishment Clause has been applied
against the States) was ratified--when "15 seniors from theNorwich Free Academy marched in their best Sunday suits
and dresses into a church hall and waited through majesticmusic and long prayers." Brodinsky, Commencement Rites

Scalia, J., dissenting
ing School Board Policies, No. 4, p. 3 (Apr. 1979). As the
Court obliquely acknowledges in describing the "customary
features" of high school graduations, ante, at 583, and as respondents do not contest, the invocation and benediction
have long been recognized to be "as traditional as any other
parts of the [school] graduation program and are widely
established." H. McKown, Commencement Activities 56
(1931); see also Brodinsky, supra, at 5.

II
The Court presumably would separate graduation invocations and benedictions from other instances of public
"preservation and transmission of religious beliefs" on the
ground that they involve "psychological coercion." I find it
a sufficient embarrassment that our Establishment Clause
jurisprudence regarding holiday displays, see County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573 (1989), has come to "requir[e]
scrutiny more commonly associated with interior decorators
than with the judiciary." American Jewish Congress v.
Chicago, 827 F. 2d 120, 129 (CA7 1987) (Easterbrook, J.,
dissenting). But interior decorating is a rock-hard science
compared to psychology practiced by amateurs. A few citations of "[r]esearch in psychology" that have no particular
bearing upon the precise issue here, ante, at 593, cannot disguise the fact that the Court has gone beyond the realm
where judges know what they are doing. The Court's argument that state officials have "coerced" students to take part
in the invocation and benediction at graduation ceremonies
is, not to put too fine a point on it, incoherent.

The Court identifies two "dominant facts" that it says dictate its ruling that invocations and benedictions at public
school graduation ceremonies violate the Establishment
Clause. Ante, at 586. Neither of them is in any relevant
sense true.

Scalia, J., dissenting

A
The Court declares that students' "attendance and partici-pation in the [invocation and benediction] are in a fair and

real sense obligatory." Ibid. But what exactly is this "fairand real sense"? According to the Court, students at graduation who want "to avoid the fact or appearance of participa-tion,"

ante, at 588, in the invocation and benediction are psy-chologically obligated by "public pressure, as well as peer

pressure, . . . to stand as a group or, at least, maintain re-spectful silence" during those prayers.

Ante, at 593. Thisassertion--the very linchpin of the Court's opinion--is almost as intriguing for what it does not say as for what itsays. It does not say, for example, that students are psychologically coerced to bow their heads, place their hands in aDu" rer-like prayer position, pay attention to the prayers,
utter "Amen," or in fact pray. (Perhaps further intensivepsychological research remains to be done on these matters.)
It claims only that students are psychologically coerced "tostand . . .

or, at least, maintain respectful silence." Ibid.(emphasis added). Both halves of this disjunctive (both of

which must amount to the fact or appearance of participationin prayer if the Court's analysis is to survive on its own
terms) merit particular attention.To begin with the latter: The Court's notion that a student
who simply sits in "respectful silence" during the invocationand benediction (when all others are standing) has somehow
joined--or would somehow be perceived as having joined--in the prayers is nothing short of ludicrous. We indeed live
in a vulgar age. But surely "our social conventions," ibid.,have not coarsened to the point that anyone who does
not stand on his chair and shout obscenities can reasonablybe deemed to have assented to everything said in his presence. Since the Court does not dispute that students ex-posed to prayer at graduation ceremonies retain (despite
"subtle coercive pressures," ante, at 588) the free will to sit,cf. ante, at 593, there is absolutely no basis for the Court's

505us2110K 04-22-99 18:57:00 PAGES OPINPGT
638 LEE v. WEISMAN

Scalia, J., dissenting
decision. It is fanciful enough to say that "a reasonable dis-senter," standing head erect in a class of bowed heads, "could

believe that the group exercise signified her own participa-tion or approval of it,"

ibid. It is beyond the absurd to
say that she could entertain such a belief while pointedly
declining to rise.But let us assume the very worst, that the nonparticipating graduate is "subtly coerced" . . . to stand! Even thathalf of the disjunctive does not remotely establish a "participation" (or an "appearance of participation") in a religiousexercise. The Court acknowledges that "in our culture
standing . . . can signify adherence to a view or simple respect for the views of others." Ibid. (Much more often
the latter than the former, I think, except perhaps in the
proverbial town meeting, where one votes by standing.)
But if it is a permissible inference that one who is standing
is doing so simply out of respect for the prayers of others
that are in progress, then how can it possibly be said that a
"reasonable dissenter . . . could believe that the group exercise signified her own participation or approval"? Quite obviously, it cannot. I may add, moreover, that maintaining
respect for the religious observances of others is a fundamental civic virtue that government (including the public
schools) can and should cultivate--so that even if it were the
case that the displaying of such respect might be mistaken
for taking part in the prayer, I would deny that the dissenter's interest in avoiding even the false appearance of participation constitutionally trumps the government's interest in
fostering respect for religion generally.

The opinion manifests that the Court itself has not given
careful consideration to its test of psychological coercion.
For if it had, how could it observe, with no hint of concern or
disapproval, that students stood for the Pledge of Allegiance,
which immediately preceded Rabbi Gutterman's invocation?
Ante, at 583. The government can, of course, no more
coerce political orthodoxy than religious orthodoxy. West

Scalia, J., dissenting
Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 642 (1943).Moreover, since the Pledge of Allegiance has been revised

since Barnette to include the phrase "under God," recital ofthe Pledge would appear to raise the same Establishment
Clause issue as the invocation and benediction. If studentswere psychologically coerced to remain standing during the
invocation, they must also have been psychologically coerced,moments before, to stand for (and thereby, in the Court's view,
take part in or appear to take part in) the Pledge. Must thePledge therefore be barred from the public schools (both
from graduation ceremonies and from the classroom)? In
Barnette we held that a public school student could not becompelled to

recite the Pledge; we did not even hint that shecould not be compelled to observe respectful silence--indeed,

even to stand in respectful silence--when those who wishedto recite it did so. Logically, that ought to be the next project for the Court's bulldozer.I also find it odd that the Court concludes that high school
graduates may not be subjected to this supposed psychologi-cal coercion, yet refrains from addressing whether "mature
adults" may. Ante, at 593. I had thought that the reasongraduation from high school is regarded as so significant an
event is that it is generally associated with transition fromadolescence to young adulthood. Many graduating seniors,
of course, are old enough to vote. Why, then, does the Courttreat them as though they were first-graders? Will we soon
have a jurisprudence that distinguishes between mature andimmature adults?

B
The other "dominant fac[t]" identified by the Court is that"[s]tate officials direct the performance of a formal religious

exercise" at school graduation ceremonies. Ante, at 586."Direct[ing] the performance of a formal religious exercise"
has a sound of liturgy to it, summoning up images of the princi-pal directing acolytes where to carry the cross, or showing the
rabbi where to unroll the Torah. A Court professing to be

Scalia, J., dissenting
engaged in a "delicate and fact-sensitive" line-drawing, ante,at 597, would better describe what it means as "prescribing

the content of an invocation and benediction." But eventhat would be false. All the record shows is that principals
of the Providence public schools, acting within their dele-gated authority, have invited clergy to deliver invocations
and benedictions at graduations; and that Principal Lee in-vited Rabbi Gutterman, provided him a two-page pamphlet,
prepared by the National Conference of Christians and Jews,giving general advice on inclusive prayer for civic occasions,
and advised him that his prayers at graduation should benonsectarian. How these facts can fairly be transformed
into the charges that Principal Lee "directed and controlledthe content of [Rabbi Gutterman's] prayer," ante, at 588, that
school officials "monitor prayer," ante, at 590, and attemptedto " `compose official prayers,' " ante, at 588, and that the
"government involvement with religious activity in this caseis pervasive," ante, at 587, is difficult to fathom. The Court
identifies nothing in the record remotely suggesting thatschool officials have ever drafted, edited, screened, or censored graduation prayers, or that Rabbi Gutterman was amouthpiece of the school officials.

These distortions of the record are, of course, not harmlesserror: without them the Court's solemn assertion that the
school officials could reasonably be perceived to be "enforc[-ing] a religious orthodoxy,"

ante, at 592, would ring as hollowas it ought.

III
The deeper flaw in the Court's opinion does not lie in itswrong answer to the question whether there was stateinduced "peer-pressure" coercion; it lies, rather, in theCourt's making violation of the Establishment Clause hinge
on such a precious question. The coercion that was a hall-mark of historical establishments of religion was coercion of
religious orthodoxy and of financial support by force of lawand threat of penalty. Typically, attendance at the state

church was required; only clergy of the official church couldlawfully perform sacraments; and dissenters, if tolerated,

faced an array of civil disabilities. L. Levy, The Establish-ment Clause 4 (1986). Thus, for example, in the Colony of
Virginia, where the Church of England had been established,
ministers were required by law to conform to the doctrineand rites of the Church of England; and all persons were

required to attend church and observe the Sabbath, weretithed for the public support of Anglican ministers, and were
taxed for the costs of building and repairing churches. Id.,at 3-4.

The Establishment Clause was adopted to prohibit such an
establishment of religion at the federal level (and to protect
state establishments of religion from federal interference).
I will further acknowledge for the sake of argument that, as
some scholars have argued, by 1790 the term "establishment" had acquired an additional meaning--"financial support of religion generally, by public taxation"--that reflected
the development of "general or multiple" establishments, not
limited to a single church. Id., at 8-9. But that would still
be an establishment coerced by force of law. And I will further concede that our constitutional tradition, from the Declaration of Independence and the first inaugural address of
Washington, quoted earlier, down to the present day, has,
with a few aberrations, see Church of Holy Trinity v. United
States, 143 U. S. 457 (1892), ruled out of order governmentsponsored endorsement of religion--even when no legal
coercion is present, and indeed even when no ersatz, "peerpressure" psycho-coercion is present--where the endorsement is sectarian, in the sense of specifying details upon
which men and women who believe in a benevolent, omnipotent Creator and Ruler of the world are known to differ
(for example, the divinity of Christ). But there is simply no
support for the proposition that the officially sponsored
nondenominational invocation and benediction read by
Rabbi Gutterman--with no one legally coerced to recite

Scalia, J., dissenting
them--violated the Constitution of the United States. To
the contrary, they are so characteristically American they
could have come from the pen of George Washington or
Abraham Lincoln himself.

Thus, while I have no quarrel with the Court's general
proposition that the Establishment Clause "guarantees that
government may not coerce anyone to support or participate
in religion or its exercise," ante, at 587, I see no warrant
for expanding the concept of coercion beyond acts backed by
threat of penalty--a brand of coercion that, happily, is
readily discernible to those of us who have made a career of
reading the disciples of Blackstone rather than of Freud.
The Framers were indeed opposed to coercion of religious
worship by the National Government; but, as their own sponsorship of nonsectarian prayer in public events demonstrates, they understood that "[s]peech is not coercive; the
listener may do as he likes." American Jewish Congress v.
Chicago, 827 F. 2d, at 132 (Easterbrook, J., dissenting).

This historical discussion places in revealing perspective
the Court's extravagant claim that the State has "for all
practical purposes," ante, at 589, and "in every practical
sense," ante, at 598, compelled students to participate in
prayers at graduation. Beyond the fact, stipulated to by the
parties, that attendance at graduation is voluntary, there is
nothing in the record to indicate that failure of attending
students to take part in the invocation or benediction was
subject to any penalty or discipline. Contrast this with, for
example, the facts of Barnette: Schoolchildren were required
by law to recite the Pledge of Allegiance; failure to do so
resulted in expulsion, threatened the expelled child with the
prospect of being sent to a reformatory for criminally inclined juveniles, and subjected his parents to prosecution
(and incarceration) for causing delinquency. 319 U. S., at
629-630. To characterize the "subtle coercive pressures,"
ante, at 588, allegedly present here as the "practical" equiva505us2110K 04-22-99 18:57:00 PAGES OPINPGT

Scalia, J., dissenting
lent of the legal sanctions in Barnette is . . . well, let me justsay it is not a "delicate and fact-sensitive" analysis.

The Court relies on our "school prayer" cases, Engel v.
Vitale, 370 U. S. 421 (1962), and School Dist. of Abington v.
Schempp, 374 U. S. 203 (1963). Ante, at 592. But whatever
the merit of those cases, they do not support, much less com-pel, the Court's psycho-journey. In the first place,

Engel
and Schempp do not constitute an exception to the rule, dis-tilled from historical practice, that public ceremonies may

include prayer, see supra, at 633-636; rather, they simply donot fall within the scope of the rule (for the obvious reason
that school instruction is not a public ceremony). Second, we
have made clear our understanding that school prayer occurs
within a framework in which legal coercion to attend school
(i. e., coercion under threat of penalty) provides the ultimate
backdrop. In Schempp, for example, we emphasized that
the prayers were "prescribed as part of the curricular activities of students who are required by law to attend school."
374 U. S., at 223 (emphasis added). Engel's suggestion that
the school prayer program at issue there--which permitted
students "to remain silent or be excused from the room," 370
U. S., at 430--involved "indirect coercive pressure," id., at
431, should be understood against this backdrop of legal coercion. The question whether the opt-out procedure in Engel
sufficed to dispel the coercion resulting from the mandatory
attendance requirement is quite different from the question
whether forbidden coercion exists in an environment utterly
devoid of legal compulsion. And finally, our school prayer
cases turn in part on the fact that the classroom is inherently
an instructional setting, and daily prayer there--where
parents are not present to counter "the students' emulation
of teachers as role models and the children's susceptibility
to peer pressure," Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578, 584
(1987)--might be thought to raise special concerns regarding
state interference with the liberty of parents to direct the
religious upbringing of their children: "Families entrust pub505us2110K 04-22-99 18:57:00 PAGES OPINPGT

Scalia, J., dissenting
lic schools with the education of their children, but conditiontheir trust on the understanding that the classroom will

not purposely be used to advance religious views that mayconflict with the private beliefs of the student and his or
her family." Ibid.; see Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S.510, 534-535 (1925). Voluntary prayer at graduation--a onetime ceremony at which parents, friends, and relatives arepresent--can hardly be thought to raise the same concerns.

IV
Our Religion Clause jurisprudence has become bedeviled(so to speak) by reliance on formulaic abstractions that are

not derived from, but positively conflict with, our long-accepted constitutional traditions. Foremost among these
has been the so-called Lemon test, see Lemon v. Kurtzman,403 U. S. 602, 612-613 (1971), which has received well-earned
criticism from many Members of this Court. See, e. g.,County of Allegheny, 492 U. S., at 655-656 (opinion of

Kennedy, J.); Edwards v. Aguillard, supra, at 636-640 (Scalia,
J., dissenting); Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S., at 108-112(

Rehnquist, J., dissenting); Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S. 402,426-430 (1985) (

O'Connor, J., dissenting); Roemer v. Board
of Pub. Works of Md., 426 U. S. 736, 768-769 (1976) (White,
J., concurring in judgment). The Court today demonstratesthe irrelevance of Lemon by essentially ignoring it, see ante,

at 587, and the interment of that case may be the one happybyproduct of the Court's otherwise lamentable decision. Unfortunately, however, the Court has replaced Lemon with itspsycho-coercion test, which suffers the double disability of
having no roots whatever in our people's historic practice,and being as infinitely expandable as the reasons for psychotherapy itself.Another happy aspect of the case is that it is only a jurisprudential disaster and not a practical one. Given the oddbasis for the Court's decision, invocations and benedictions
will be able to be given at public school graduations next

June, as they have for the past century and a half, so long asschool authorities make clear that anyone who abstains from

screaming in protest does not necessarily participate in theprayers. All that is seemingly needed is an announcement,
or perhaps a written insertion at the beginning of the gradu-ation program, to the effect that, while all are asked to rise
for the invocation and benediction, none is compelled to joinin them, nor will be assumed, by rising, to have done so.
That obvious fact recited, the graduates and their parentsmay proceed to thank God, as Americans have always done,
for the blessings He has generously bestowed on them andon their country.

* * *
The reader has been told much in this case about the per-sonal interest of Mr. Weisman and his daughter, and very

little about the personal interests on the other side. Theyare not inconsequential. Church and state would not be
such a difficult subject if religion were, as the Court appar-ently thinks it to be, some purely personal avocation that can
be indulged entirely in secret, like pornography, in the pri-vacy of one's room. For most believers it is

not that, andhas never been. Religious men and women of almost all

denominations have felt it necessary to acknowledge andbeseech the blessing of God as a people, and not just as individuals, because they believe in the "protection of divineProvidence," as the Declaration of Independence put it, not
just for individuals but for societies; because they believeGod to be, as Washington's first Thanksgiving Proclamation
put it, the "Great Lord and Ruler of Nations." One can be-lieve in the effectiveness of such public worship, or one can
deprecate and deride it. But the longstanding Americantradition of prayer at official ceremonies displays with unmistakable clarity that the Establishment Clause does not forbidthe government to accommodate it.

The narrow context of the present case involves a commu-nity's celebration of one of the milestones in its young citi505us2110K 04-22-99 18:57:00 PAGES OPINPGT
646 LEE v. WEISMAN

Scalia, J., dissenting
zens' lives, and it is a bold step for this Court to seek tobanish from that occasion, and from thousands of similar celebrations throughout this land, the expression of gratitude toGod that a majority of the community wishes to make. The
issue before us today is not the abstract philosophical ques-tion whether the alternative of frustrating this desire of a
religious majority is to be preferred over the alternative ofimposing "psychological coercion," or a feeling of exclusion,
upon nonbelievers. Rather, the question is whether a mandatory choice in favor of the former has been imposed bythe United States Constitution. As the age-old practices of

our people show, the answer to that question is not at allin doubt.

I must add one final observation: The Founders of our Re-public knew the fearsome potential of sectarian religious belief to generate civil dissension and civil strife. And theyalso knew that nothing, absolutely nothing, is so inclined to
foster among religious believers of various faiths a tolera-tion--no, an affection--for one another than voluntarily joining in prayer together, to the God whom they all worshipand seek. Needless to say, no one should be compelled to
do that, but it is a shame to deprive our public culture of theopportunity, and indeed the encouragement, for people to do
it voluntarily. The Baptist or Catholic who heard and joinedin the simple and inspiring prayers of Rabbi Gutterman on
this official and patriotic occasion was inoculated from reli-gious bigotry and prejudice in a manner that cannot be replicated. To deprive our society of that important unifyingmechanism, in order to spare the nonbeliever what seems to
me the minimal inconvenience of standing or even sitting inrespectful nonparticipation, is as senseless in policy as it is
unsupported in law.For the foregoing reasons, I dissent.

647OCTOBER TERM, 1991
Syllabus

DOGGETT v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 90-857. Argued October 9, 1991--Reargued February 24, 1992--

Decided June 24, 1992

In February 1980, petitioner Doggett was indicted on federal drug

charges, but he left the country before the Drug Enforcement Agency
could secure his arrest. The DEA knew that he was later imprisoned
in Panama, but after requesting that he be expelled back to the United
States, never followed up on his status. Once the DEA discovered that
he had left Panama for Colombia, it made no further attempt to locate
him. Thus, it was unaware that he reentered this country in 1982 and
subsequently married, earned a college degree, found steady employment, lived openly under his own name, and stayed within the law. The
Marshal's Service eventually located him during a simple credit check
on individuals with outstanding warrants. He was arrested in September 1988, 81/2 years after his indictment. He moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the Government's failure to prosecute him
earlier violated his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, but the
District Court denied the motion, and he entered a conditional guilty
plea. The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: The delay between Doggett's indictment and arrest violated his

right to a speedy trial. His claim meets the Barker v. Wingo, 407 U. S.
514, 530, criteria for evaluating speedy trial claims. First, the extraordinary 81/2-year lag between his indictment and arrest clearly suffices
to trigger the speedy trial enquiry. Second, the Government was to
blame for the delay. The District Court's finding that the Government
was negligent in pursuing Doggett should be viewed with considerable
deference, and neither the Government nor the record provides any reason to reject that finding. Third, Doggett asserted in due course his
right to a speedy trial. The courts below found that he did not know
of his indictment before his arrest, and, in the factual basis supporting
his guilty plea, the Government essentially conceded this point. Finally, the negligent delay between Doggett's indictment and arrest presumptively prejudiced his ability to prepare an adequate defense. The
Government errs in arguing that the Speedy Trial Clause does not significantly protect a defendant's interest in fair adjudication. United
States v. Marion, 404 U. S. 307, 320-323; United States v. MacDonald,
456 U. S. 1, 8; United States v. Loud Hawk, 474 U. S. 302, 312, distin505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
guished. Nor does Doggett's failure to cite any specifically demonstrable prejudice doom his claim, since excessive delay can compromise a
trial's reliability in unidentifiable ways. Presumptive prejudice is part
of the mix of relevant Barker factors and increases in importance with
the length of the delay. Here, the Government's egregious persistence
in failing to prosecute Doggett is sufficient to warrant granting relief.
The negligence caused delay six times as long as that generally deemed
sufficient to trigger judicial review, and the presumption of prejudice
is neither extenuated, as by Doggett's acquiescence, nor persuasively
rebutted. Pp. 651-658.

906 F. 2d 573, reversed and remanded.

Rehnquist, C. J., and Scalia, J., joined, post, p. 659.

the United States. Assistant Attorney General Muellerargued the cause for the United States on the original argument. With them on the briefs were Solicitor General
Starr, Ronald J. Mann, and Patty Merkamp Stemler.

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this case we consider whether the delay of 81/2 yearsbetween petitioner's indictment and arrest violated his Sixth

Amendment right to a speedy trial. We hold that it did.

I
On February 22, 1980, petitioner Marc Doggett was in-dicted for conspiring with several others to import and distribute cocaine. See 84 Stat. 1265, 1291, as amended, 21U. S. C. $$ 846, 963. Douglas Driver, the Drug Enforcement
Administration's (DEA's) principal agent investigating theconspiracy, told the United States Marshal's Service that the
DEA would oversee the apprehension of Doggett and hisconfederates. On March 18, 1980, two police officers set out

Opinion of the Court
under Driver's orders to arrest Doggett at his parents' housein Raleigh, North Carolina, only to find that he was not

there. His mother told the officers that he had left forColombia four days earlier.

To catch Doggett on his return to the United States,
Driver sent word of his outstanding arrest warrant to allUnited States Customs stations and to a number of law enforcement organizations. He also placed Doggett's name inthe Treasury Enforcement Communication System (TECS),
a computer network that helps Customs agents screen peopleentering the country, and in the National Crime Information
Center computer system, which serves similar ends. The
TECS entry expired that September, however, and Doggett's
name vanished from the system.

In September 1981, Driver found out that Doggett was
under arrest on drug charges in Panama and, thinking that
a formal extradition request would be futile, simply asked
Panama to "expel" Doggett to the United States. Although
the Panamanian authorities promised to comply when their
own proceedings had run their course, they freed Doggett
the following July and let him go to Colombia, where he
stayed with an aunt for several months. On September 25,
1982, he passed unhindered through Customs in New York
City and settled down in Virginia. Since his return to the
United States, he has married, earned a college degree,
found a steady job as a computer operations manager, lived
openly under his own name, and stayed within the law.

Doggett's travels abroad had not wholly escaped the Government's notice, however. In 1982, the American Embassy
in Panama told the State Department of his departure to
Colombia, but that information, for whatever reason, eluded
the DEA, and Agent Driver assumed for several years that
his quarry was still serving time in a Panamanian prison.
Driver never asked DEA officials in Panama to check into
Doggett's status, and only after his own fortuitous assignment to that country in 1985 did he discover Doggett's depar505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT
650 DOGGETT v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
ture for Colombia. Driver then simply assumed Doggett
had settled there, and he made no effort to find out for sure
or to track Doggett down, either abroad or in the United
States. Thus Doggett remained lost to the American criminal justice system until September 1988, when the Marshal's
Service ran a simple credit check on several thousand people
subject to outstanding arrest warrants and, within minutes,
found out where Doggett lived and worked. On September
5, 1988, nearly 6 years after his return to the United States
and 81/2 years after his indictment, Doggett was arrested.

He naturally moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing
that the Government's failure to prosecute him earlier violated his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. The
Federal Magistrate hearing his motion applied the criteria
for assessing speedy trial claims set out in Barker v. Wingo,
407 U. S. 514 (1972): "[l]ength of delay, the reason for the
delay, the defendant's assertion of his right, and prejudice to
the defendant." Id., at 530 (footnote omitted). The Magistrate found that the delay between Doggett's indictment and
arrest was long enough to be "presumptively prejudicial,"
Magistrate's Report, reprinted at App. to Pet. for Cert. 27-
28, that the delay "clearly [was] attributable to the negligence of the government," id., at 39, and that Doggett could
not be faulted for any delay in asserting his right to a speedy
trial, there being no evidence that he had known of the
charges against him until his arrest, id., at 42-44. The Magistrate also found, however, that Doggett had made no affirmative showing that the delay had impaired his ability to
mount a successful defense or had otherwise prejudiced him.
In his recommendation to the District Court, the Magistrate
contended that this failure to demonstrate particular prejudice sufficed to defeat Doggett's speedy trial claim.

The District Court took the recommendation and denied
Doggett's motion. Doggett then entered a conditional guilty

plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(a)(2),

Opinion of the Court
expressly reserving the right to appeal his ensuing convic-tion on the speedy trial claim.

A split panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed. 906 F. 2d573 (CA11 1990). Following Circuit precedent, see Ringstaff v. Howard, 885 F. 2d 1542 (CA11 1989) (en banc), thecourt ruled that Doggett could prevail only by proving "actual prejudice" or by establishing that "the first three
Barker factors weigh[ed] heavily in his favor." 906 F. 2d, at582. The majority agreed with the Magistrate that Doggett

had not shown actual prejudice, and, attributing the Govern-ment's delay to "negligence" rather than "bad faith," id., at
578-579, it concluded that Barker's first three factors did notweigh so heavily against the Government as to make proof
of specific prejudice unnecessary. Judge Clark dissented,arguing, among other things, that the majority had placed
undue emphasis on Doggett's inability to prove actualprejudice.

We granted Doggett's petition for certiorari, 498 U. S. 1119(1991), and now reverse.

II
The Sixth Amendment guarantees that, "[i]n all criminalprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy

. . . trial . . . ." On its face, the Speedy Trial Clause is writ-ten with such breadth that, taken literally, it would forbid
the government to delay the trial of an "accused" for anyreason at all. Our cases, however, have qualified the literal
sweep of the provision by specifically recognizing the rele-vance of four separate enquiries: whether delay before trial
was uncommonly long, whether the government or the crimi-nal defendant is more to blame for that delay, whether, in
due course, the defendant asserted his right to a speedy trial,and whether he suffered prejudice as the delay's result. See
Barker, supra, at 530.The first of these is actually a double enquiry. Simply to
trigger a speedy trial analysis, an accused must allege thatthe interval between accusation and trial has crossed the

505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT
652 DOGGETT v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
threshold dividing ordinary from "presumptively prejudicial"delay, 407 U. S., at 530-531, since, by definition, he cannot

complain that the government has denied him a "speedy"trial if it has, in fact, prosecuted his case with customary
promptness. If the accused makes this showing, the courtmust then consider, as one factor among several, the extent
to which the delay stretches beyond the bare minimumneeded to trigger judicial examination of the claim. See

id.,at 533-534. This latter enquiry is significant to the speedy

trial analysis because, as we discuss below, the presumptionthat pretrial delay has prejudiced the accused intensifies
over time. In this case, the extraordinary 81/2-year lag be-tween Doggett's indictment and arrest clearly suffices to
trigger the speedy trial enquiry; 1 its further significancewithin that enquiry will be dealt with later.

As for Barker's second criterion, the Government claimsto have sought Doggett with diligence. The findings of the
courts below are to the contrary, however, and we reviewtrial court determinations of negligence with considerable
deference. See Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S.384, 402 (1990);

McAllister v. United States, 348 U. S. 19,20-22 (1954); 9 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and

Procedure $ 2590 (1971). The Government gives us nothingto gainsay the findings that have come up to us, and we see
nothing fatal to them in the record. For six years, the Gov-ernment's investigators made no serious effort to test their
progressively more questionable assumption that Doggett

1 Depending on the nature of the charges, the lower courts have generally found postaccusation delay "presumptively prejudicial" at least as it
approaches one year. See 2 W. LaFave & J. Israel, Criminal Procedure

$ 18.2, p. 405 (1984); Joseph, Speedy Trial Rights in Application, 48 Ford.
L. Rev. 611, 623, n. 71 (1980) (citing cases). We note that, as the term is
used in this threshold context, "presumptive prejudice" does not necessarily indicate a statistical probability of prejudice; it simply marks the point
at which courts deem the delay unreasonable enough to trigger the Barker
enquiry. Cf. Uviller, Barker v. Wingo: Speedy Trial Gets a Fast Shuffle,
72 Colum. L. Rev. 1376, 1384-1385 (1972).

Opinion of the Court
was living abroad, and, had they done so, they could have
found him within minutes. While the Government's lethargy may have reflected no more than Doggett's relative
unimportance in the world of drug trafficking, it was still
findable negligence, and the finding stands.

The Government goes against the record again in suggesting that Doggett knew of his indictment years before he was
arrested. Were this true, Barker's third factor, concerning
invocation of the right to a speedy trial, would be weighed
heavily against him. But here again, the Government is
trying to revisit the facts. At the hearing on Doggett's
speedy trial motion, it introduced no evidence challenging
the testimony of Doggett's wife, who said that she did not
know of the charges until his arrest, and of his mother, who
claimed not to have told him or anyone else that the police
had come looking for him. From this the Magistrate implicitly concluded, Magistrate's Report, reprinted at App. to Pet.
for Cert. 42-44, and the Court of Appeals expressly reaffirmed, 906 F. 2d, at 579-580, that Doggett had won the
evidentiary battle on this point. Not only that, but in the
factual basis supporting Doggett's guilty plea, the Government explicitly conceded that it had

"no information that Doggett was aware of the indictment before he left the United States in March 1980, or
prior to his arrest. His mother testified at the suppression hearing that she never told him, and Barnes and
Riddle [Doggett's confederates] state they did not have
contact with him after their arrest [in 1980]." 2 Record, Exh. 63, p. 2.

While one of the Government's lawyers later expressed
amazement that "that particular stipulation is in the factual
basis," Tr. 13 (Mar. 31, 1989), he could not make it go away,
and the trial and appellate courts were entitled to accept
the defense's unrebutted and largely substantiated claim of

505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT
654 DOGGETT v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Doggett's ignorance. Thus, Doggett is not to be taxed forinvoking his speedy trial right only after his arrest.

III
The Government is left, then, with its principal contention:that Doggett fails to make out a successful speedy trial claim

because he has not shown precisely how he was prejudicedby the delay between his indictment and trial.

A
We have observed in prior cases that unreasonable delaybetween formal accusation and trial threatens to produce

more than one sort of harm, including "oppressive pretrialincarceration," "anxiety and concern of the accused," and
"the possibility that the [accused's] defense will be impaired"by dimming memories and loss of exculpatory evidence.
Barker, 407 U. S., at 532; see also Smith v. Hooey, 393 U. S.374, 377-379 (1969);

United States v. Ewell, 383 U. S. 116, 120(1966). Of these forms of prejudice, "the most serious is the

last, because the inability of a defendant adequately to pre-pare his case skews the fairness of the entire system." 407
U. S., at 532. Doggett claims this kind of prejudice, andthere is probably no other kind that he can claim, since he
was subjected neither to pretrial detention nor, he hassuccessfully contended, to awareness of unresolved charges
against him.The Government answers Doggett's claim by citing language in three cases, United States v. Marion, 404 U. S. 307,320-323 (1971), United States v. MacDonald, 456 U. S. 1, 8
(1982), and United States v. Loud Hawk, 474 U. S. 302, 312(1986), for the proposition that the Speedy Trial Clause does
not significantly protect a criminal defendant's interest infair adjudication. In so arguing, the Government asks us,
in effect, to read part of Barker right out of the law, andthat we will not do. In context, the cited passages support
nothing beyond the principle, which we have independently

Opinion of the Court
based on textual and historical grounds, see Marion, supra,at 313-320, that the Sixth Amendment right of the accused

to a speedy trial has no application beyond the confines ofa formal criminal prosecution. Once triggered by arrest,
indictment, or other official accusation, however, the speedytrial enquiry must weigh the effect of delay on the accused's
defense just as it has to weigh any other form of prejudicethat

Barker recognized.2 See Moore v. Arizona, 414 U. S.25, 26-27, and n. 2 (1973); Barker, supra, at 532; Smith,

supra, at 377-379; Ewell, supra, at 120.As an alternative to limiting Barker, the Government
claims Doggett has failed to make any affirmative showingthat the delay weakened his ability to raise specific defenses,
elicit specific testimony, or produce specific items of evidence.Though Doggett did indeed come up short in this respect,
the Government's argument takes it only so far: consider-ation of prejudice is not limited to the specifically demonstrable, and, as it concedes, Brief for United States 28, n. 21;Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-34 (Feb. 24, 1992), affirmative proof of
particularized prejudice is not essential to every speedy trialclaim. See

Moore, supra, at 26; Barker, supra, at 533.
Barker explicitly recognized that impairment of one's de-fense is the most difficult form of speedy trial prejudice to

prove because time's erosion of exculpatory evidence andtestimony "can rarely be shown." 407 U. S., at 532. And
though time can tilt the case against either side, see id., at521; Loud Hawk, supra, at 315, one cannot generally be sure
which of them it has prejudiced more severely. Thus, wegenerally have to recognize that excessive delay presumptively compromises the reliability of a trial in ways that nei-ther party can prove or, for that matter, identify. While

2 Thus, we reject the Government's argument that the effect of delay on
adjudicative accuracy is exclusively a matter for consideration under the
Due Process Clause. We leave intact our earlier observation, see United
States v. MacDonald, 456 U. S. 1, 7 (1982), that a defendant may invoke
due process to challenge delay both before and after official accusation.

Opinion of the Court
such presumptive prejudice cannot alone carry a SixthAmendment claim without regard to the other Barker criteria, see Loud Hawk, supra, at 315, it is part of the mix ofrelevant facts, and its importance increases with the length
of delay. B

This brings us to an enquiry into the role that presumptiveprejudice should play in the disposition of Doggett's speedy
trial claim. We begin with hypothetical and somewhat eas-ier cases and work our way to this one.

Our speedy trial standards recognize that pretrial delay isoften both inevitable and wholly justifiable. The government may need time to collect witnesses against the accused,oppose his pretrial motions, or, if he goes into hiding, track
him down. We attach great weight to such considerationswhen balancing them against the costs of going forward with
a trial whose probative accuracy the passage of time hasbegun by degrees to throw into question. See Loud Hawk,
supra, at 315-317. Thus, in this case, if the Governmenthad pursued Doggett with reasonable diligence from his indictment to his arrest, his speedy trial claim would fail. In-deed, that conclusion would generally follow as a matter of
course however great the delay, so long as Doggett could notshow specific prejudice to his defense.

The Government concedes, on the other hand, that Dog-gett would prevail if he could show that the Government had
intentionally held back in its prosecution of him to gain someimpermissible advantage at trial. See Brief for United
States 28, n. 21; Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-34 (Feb. 24, 1992). Thatwe cannot doubt.

Barker stressed that official bad faith incausing delay will be weighed heavily against the government, 407 U. S., at 531, and a bad-faith delay the length ofthis negligent one would present an overwhelming case for
dismissal.Between diligent prosecution and bad-faith delay, official
negligence in bringing an accused to trial occupies the mid505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:36 PAGES OPINPGT

657Cite as: 505 U. S. 647 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
dle ground. While not compelling relief in every case wherebad-faith delay would make relief virtually automatic, neither is negligence automatically tolerable simply because theaccused cannot demonstrate exactly how it has prejudiced
him. It was on this point that the Court of Appeals erred,
and on the facts before us, it was reversible error.

Barker made it clear that "different weights [are to be]
assigned to different reasons" for delay. Ibid. Althoughnegligence is obviously to be weighed more lightly than a

deliberate intent to harm the accused's defense, it still fallson the wrong side of the divide between acceptable and unacceptable reasons for delaying a criminal prosecution once it
has begun. And such is the nature of the prejudice presumed that the weight we assign to official negligence compounds over time as the presumption of evidentiary prejudice grows. Thus, our toleration of such negligence varies
inversely with its protractedness, cf. Arizona v. Youngblood,
488 U. S. 51 (1988), and its consequent threat to the fairness
of the accused's trial. Condoning prolonged and unjustifiable delays in prosecution would both penalize many defendants for the state's fault and simply encourage the government to gamble with the interests of criminal suspects
assigned a low prosecutorial priority. The Government, indeed, can hardly complain too loudly, for persistent neglect in
concluding a criminal prosecution indicates an uncommonly
feeble interest in bringing an accused to justice; the more
weight the Government attaches to securing a conviction,
the harder it will try to get it.

To be sure, to warrant granting relief, negligence unaccompanied by particularized trial prejudice must have lasted
longer than negligence demonstrably causing such prejudice.
But even so, the Government's egregious persistence in failing to prosecute Doggett is clearly sufficient. The lag between Doggett's indictment and arrest was 81/2 years, and he
would have faced trial 6 years earlier than he did but for the
Government's inexcusable oversights. The portion of the

delay attributable to the Government's negligence far ex-ceeds the threshold needed to state a speedy trial claim;

indeed, we have called shorter delays "extraordinary." SeeBarker, supra, at 533. When the Government's negligence
thus causes delay six times as long as that generally suffi-cient to trigger judicial review, see n. 1,

supra, and whenthe presumption of prejudice, albeit unspecified, is neither

extenuated,3 as by the defendant's acquiescence, e. g., 407U. S., at 534-536, nor persuasively rebutted,

is entitled to relief. IV

We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and re-mand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Justice O'Connor, dissenting.
I believe the Court of Appeals properly balanced the con-siderations set forth in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514 (1972).

Although the delay between indictment and trial waslengthy, petitioner did not suffer any anxiety or restriction
on his liberty. The only harm to petitioner from the lapse

3 Citing United States v. Broce, 488 U. S. 563, 569 (1989), the Government
argues that, by pleading guilty, Doggett waived any right to claim that
the delay would have prejudiced him had he gone to trial. Brief for
United States 30. Yet Doggett did not sign a guilty plea simpliciter, but
a conditional guilty plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure
11(a)(2), thereby securing the Government's explicit consent to his reservation of "the right to appeal the adverse Court ruling on his Motion to
Dismiss for violation of Constitutional Speedy Trial provisions based upon
post-indictment delay." Plea Agreement, 2 Record, Exh. 66, p. 1. One
cannot reasonably construe this agreement to bar Doggett from pursuing
as effective an appeal as he could have raised had he not pleaded guilty.

4 While the Government ably counters Doggett's efforts to demonstrate

particularized trial prejudice, it has not, and probably could not have, affirmatively proved that the delay left his ability to defend himself unimpaired. Cf. Uviller, 72 Colum. L. Rev., at 1394-1395.

of time was potential prejudice to his ability to defend hiscase. We have not allowed such speculative harm to tip the

scales. Instead, we have required a showing of actual prej-udice to the defense before weighing it in the balance. As
we stated in United States v. Loud Hawk, 474 U. S. 302, 315(1986), the "possibility of prejudice is not sufficient to support respondents' position that their speedy trial rights wereviolated. In this case, moreover, delay is a two-edged
sword. It is the Government that bears the burden of prov-ing its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The passage of time
may make it difficult or impossible for the Government tocarry this burden." The Court of Appeals followed this
holding, and I believe we should as well. For this reason, Irespectfully dissent.

Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Scalia join, dissenting.

Just as "bad facts make bad law," so too odd facts makeodd law. Doggett's 8

1/2-year odyssey from youthful drug

dealing in the tobacco country of North Carolina, throughstints in a Panamanian jail and in Colombia, to life as a computer operations manager, homeowner, and registered voterin suburban Virginia is extraordinary. But even more extraordinary is the Court's conclusion that the Governmentdenied Doggett his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial
despite the fact that he has suffered none of the harms thatthe right was designed to prevent. I respectfully dissent.

We have long identified the "major evils" against whichthe Speedy Trial Clause is directed as "undue and oppressive

incarceration" and the "anxiety and concern accompanyingpublic accusation." United States v. Marion, 404 U. S. 307,
320 (1971). The Court does not, and cannot, seriously dis-pute that those two concerns lie at the heart of the Clause,
and that neither concern is implicated here. Doggett was

neither in United States custody nor subject to bail duringthe entire 8

1/2-year period at issue. Indeed, as this case

comes to us, we must assume that he was blissfully unawareof his indictment all the while, and thus was not subject

to the anxiety or humiliation that typically accompanies aknown criminal charge.

Thus, this unusual case presents the question whether, in-dependent of these core concerns, the Speedy Trial Clause
protects an accused from two additional harms: (1) prejudiceto his ability to defend himself caused by the passage of time;
and (2) disruption of his life years after the alleged commis-sion of his crime. The Court today proclaims that the first
of these additional harms is indeed an independent concernof the Clause, and on that basis compels reversal of Doggett's
conviction and outright dismissal of the indictment againsthim. As to the second of these harms, the Court remains
mum--despite the fact that we requested supplementalbriefing on this very point.

I disagree with the Court's analysis. In my view, theSixth Amendment's speedy trial guarantee does not provide

independent protection against either prejudice to an ac-cused's defense or the disruption of his life. I shall consider
each in turn. A

As we have explained, "the Speedy Trial Clause's coreconcern is impairment of liberty." United States v. Loud
Hawk, 474 U. S. 302, 312 (1986) (emphasis added). When-ever a criminal trial takes place long after the events at
issue, the defendant may be prejudiced in any number ofways. But "[t]he Speedy Trial Clause does not purport to

"whether the history of the Speedy Trial Clause of the Sixth Amendment
supports the view that the Clause protects a right of citizens to repose,
free from the fear of secret or unknown indictments for past crimes, independent of any interest in preventing lengthy pretrial incarceration or
prejudice to the case of a criminal defendant").

Thomas, J., dissenting
protect a defendant from all effects flowing from a delay be-fore trial."

Id., at 311. The Clause is directed not generally against delay-related prejudice, but against delay-related prejudice to a defendant's liberty. "The speedy trial

guarantee is designed to minimize the possibility of lengthy
incarceration prior to trial, to reduce the lesser, but never-theless substantial, impairment of liberty imposed on an accused while released on bail, and to shorten the disruption oflife caused by arrest and the presence of unresolved criminal
charges." United States v. MacDonald, 456 U. S. 1, 8 (1982).Thus, "when defendants are not incarcerated or subjected to
other substantial restrictions on their liberty, a court should
not weigh that time towards a claim under the Speedy Trial
Clause." Loud Hawk, supra, at 312.

A lengthy pretrial delay, of course, may prejudice an accused's ability to defend himself. But, we have explained,
prejudice to the defense is not the sort of impairment of liberty against which the Clause is directed. "Passage of time,
whether before or after arrest, may impair memories, cause
evidence to be lost, deprive the defendant of witnesses, and
otherwise interfere with his ability to defend himself. But
this possibility of prejudice at trial is not itself sufficient
reason to wrench the Sixth Amendment from its proper context." Marion, supra, at 321-322 (footnote omitted; emphasis added). Even though a defendant may be prejudiced by
a pretrial delay, and even though the government may be
unable to provide a valid justification for that delay, the
Clause does not come into play unless the delay impairs the
defendant's liberty. "Inordinate delay . . . may impair a defendant's ability to present an effective defense. But the
major evils protected against by the speedy trial guarantee
exist quite apart from actual or possible prejudice to an accused's defense." 404 U. S., at 320 (emphasis added).

These explanations notwithstanding, we have on occasion
identified the prevention of prejudice to the defense as an
independent and fundamental objective of the Speedy Trial

Thomas, J., dissenting
Clause. In particular, in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514, 532
(1972), we asserted that the Clause was "designed to protect" three basic interests: "(i) to prevent oppressive pretrial
incarceration; (ii) to minimize anxiety and concern of the accused; and (iii) to limit the possibility that the defense will be
impaired." See also Smith v. Hooey, 393 U. S. 374, 377-378
(1969); United States v. Ewell, 383 U. S. 116, 120 (1966). Indeed, the Barker Court went so far as to declare that of these
three interests, "the most serious is the last, because the
inability of a defendant adequately to prepare his case skews
the fairness of the entire system." 407 U. S., at 532.

We are thus confronted with two conflicting lines of authority, the one declaring that "limit[ing] the possibility that
the defense will be impaired" is an independent and fundamental objective of the Speedy Trial Clause, e. g., Barker,
supra, at 532, and the other declaring that it is not, e. g.,
Marion, 404 U. S. 307 (1971); MacDonald, supra; Loud
Hawk, supra. The Court refuses to acknowledge this conflict. Instead, it simply reiterates the relevant language
from Barker and asserts that Marion, MacDonald, and
Loud Hawk "support nothing beyond the principle . . . that
the Sixth Amendment right of the accused to a speedy trial
has no application beyond the confines of a formal criminal
prosecution." Ante, at 654-655. That attempt at reconciliation is eminently unpersuasive.

It is true, of course, that the Speedy Trial Clause by its
terms applies only to an "accused"; the right does not attach
before indictment or arrest. See Marion, supra, at 313-315,
320-322; Dillingham v. United States, 423 U. S. 64, 64-65
(1975) (per curiam). But that limitation on the Clause's
protection only confirms that preventing prejudice to the defense is not one of its independent and fundamental objectives. For prejudice to the defense stems from the interval
between crime and trial, which is quite distinct from the interval between accusation and trial. If the Clause were in505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:36 PAGES OPINPGT

Thomas, J., dissenting
deed aimed at safeguarding against prejudice to the defense,then it would presumably limit

all prosecutions that occur
long after the criminal events at issue. A defendant prose-cuted 10 years after a crime is just as hampered in his ability

to defend himself whether he was indicted the week after
the crime or the week before the trial--but no one would
suggest that the Clause protects him in the latter situation,
where the delay did not substantially impair his liberty,
either through oppressive incarceration or the anxiety of
known criminal charges. Thus, while the Court is correct
to observe that the defendants in Marion, MacDonald, and
Loud Hawk were not subject to formal criminal prosecution
during the lengthy period of delay prior to their trials, that
observation misses the point of those cases. With respect to
the relevant consideration--the defendants' ability to defend
themselves despite the passage of time--they were in precisely the same situation as a defendant who had long since
been indicted. The initiation of a formal criminal prosecution is simply irrelevant to whether the defense has been
prejudiced by delay.

Although being an "accused" is necessary to trigger the
Clause's protection, it is not sufficient to do so. The touchstone of the speedy trial right, after all, is the substantial
deprivation of liberty that typically accompanies an "accusation," not the accusation itself. That explains why a person
who has been arrested but not indicted is entitled to the protection of the Clause, see Dillingham, supra, even though
technically he has not been "accused" at all.2 And it ex2 In this regard, it is instructive to compare the Sixth Amendment's
speedy trial right to its right to counsel, which also applies only to an
"accused." The right to counsel, we have held, does not attach until " `at
or after the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings--whether
by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or
arraignment.' " United States v. Gouveia, 467 U. S. 180, 188 (1984) (quoting Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U. S. 682, 689 (1972) (plurality opinion)). In

plains why the lower courts consistently have held that, with
respect to sealed (and hence secret) indictments, the protections of the Speedy Trial Clause are triggered not when the
indictment is filed, but when it is unsealed. See, e. g.,
United States v. Watson, 599 F. 2d 1149, 1156-1157, and n. 5
(CA2 1979), modified on other grounds sub nom. United
States v. Muse, 633 F. 2d 1041 (CA2 1980) (en banc); United
States v. Hay, 527 F. 2d 990, 994, and n. 4 (CA10 1975); cf.
United States v. Lewis, 907 F. 2d 773, 774, n. 3 (CA8 1990).

It is misleading, then, for the Court to accuse the Government of "ask[ing] us, in effect, to read part of Barker right
out of the law," ante, at 654, a course the Court resolutely
rejects. For the issue here is not simply whether the relevant language from Barker should be read out of the law, but
whether that language trumps the contrary logic of Marion,
MacDonald, and Loud Hawk. The Court's protestations
notwithstanding, the two lines of authority cannot be reconciled; to reaffirm the one is to undercut the other.

In my view, the choice presented is not a hard one. Barker's suggestion that preventing prejudice to the defense is
a fundamental and independent objective of the Clause is
plainly dictum. Never, until today, have we confronted a
case where a defendant subjected to a lengthy delay after
indictment nonetheless failed to suffer any substantial impairment of his liberty. I think it fair to say that Barker
simply did not contemplate such an unusual situation. Moreover, to the extent that the Barker dictum purports to elevate considerations of prejudice to the defense to fundamental and independent status under the Clause, it cannot be

other words, for purposes of the right to counsel, an "accused" must in
fact be accused of a crime; unlike the speedy trial right, it does not attach
upon arrest. See, e. g., Gouveia, supra, at 189-190; McNeil v. Wisconsin,
501 U. S. 171, 175-176 (1991).

deemed to have survived our subsequent decisions in Mac-Donald and Loud Hawk.

Just because the Speedy Trial Clause does not independ-ently protect against prejudice to the defense does not, of

course, mean that a defendant is utterly unprotected in thisregard. To the contrary, " `the applicable statute of limitations . . . is . . . the primary guarantee against bringingoverly stale criminal charges,' "

Marion, 404 U. S., at 322(quoting Ewell, 383 U. S., at 122). These statutes "represent

legislative assessments of relative interests of the State andthe defendant in administering and receiving justice; they
`are made for the repose of society and the protection ofthose who may [during the limitation] . . . have lost their
means of defence.' " 404 U. S., at 322 (quoting Public
Schools v. Walker, 9 Wall. 282, 288 (1870)). Because suchstatutes are fixed by the legislature and not decreed by

3 Our summary reversal in Moore v. Arizona, 414 U. S. 25 (1973) (per
curiam), is not to the contrary. The petitioner there was tried for murder
in Arizona "[a]lmost three years after he was charged and 28 months after
he first demanded that Arizona either extradite him from California,
where he was serving a prison term, or drop a detainer against him."
Ibid. The Arizona Supreme Court denied him speedy trial relief on the
ground that "a showing of prejudice to the defense at trial was essential
to establish a federal speedy trial claim." Ibid. We rejected that reasoning, emphasizing the contextual nature of the speedy trial analysis set
forth in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514 (1972).

To hold that a speedy trial claim can succeed without a showing of actual
trial prejudice is not, of course, to hold that such a claim can succeed
without a showing of any prejudice at all. Moore, like Barker, is clearly
premised on the assumption that the defendant invoking the protection of
the Speedy Trial Clause has been subjected to the evils against which the
Clause was designed to protect. Indeed, Moore makes this assumption
quite explicit, observing that prejudice is " `inevitably present in every
case to some extent, for every defendant will either be incarcerated pending trial or on bail subject to substantial restrictions on his liberty.' "
Moore, supra, at 27 (quoting Barker, supra, at 537 (White, J., concurring))
(emphasis added). While accurate in the vast majority of cases, that observation is not inevitably true--as this case shows.

courts on an ad hoc basis, they "provide predictability byspecifying a limit beyond which there is an irrebuttable

presumption that a defendant's right to a fair trial wouldbe prejudiced." 404 U. S., at 322.

Furthermore, the Due Process Clause always protectsdefendants against fundamentally unfair treatment by the
government in criminal proceedings. See United States v.
Lovasco, 431 U. S. 783 (1977). As we explained in Marion,"the Due Process Clause . . . would require dismissal of [an]

indictment if it were shown at trial that [a] delay . . . causedsubstantial prejudice to [a defendant's] rights to a fair trial
and that the delay was an intentional device to gain tacticaladvantage over the accused." 404 U. S., at 324. See also
MacDonald, 456 U. S., at 8 ("The Sixth Amendment right toa speedy trial is . . . not primarily intended to prevent prejudice to the defense caused by passage of time; that interestis protected primarily by the Due Process Clause and by
statutes of limitations").4

4 The result in the case may well be explained by an improvident concession. While the United States argued essentially that a defendant's
speedy trial rights cannot be violated where he is neither incarcerated nor
subject to the anxiety of known criminal charges, it did not claim that this
was invariably so. Instead, the United States conceded that a defendant
whose liberty was in no way impaired by a pretrial delay could nevertheless succeed in a speedy trial claim if the government had intentionally
caused the delay for the specific purpose of prejudicing the defense or
injuring the defendant in some other significant way. The defendant in
this case is not entitled to relief, the United States asserts, because the
delay in bringing him to trial was, at worst, caused by negligence.

Not surprisingly, the Court seizes on this concession with relish. See
ante, at 655, 656 (citing Brief for United States 28, n. 21, Tr. of Oral Arg.
28-34 (Feb. 24, 1992)). For if defendants can bring successful speedy trial
claims even though they have not been "incarcerated or subjected to other
substantial restrictions on their liberty," United States v. Loud Hawk, 474
U. S. 302, 312 (1986), then the Clause's protections necessarily extend beyond those core concerns. If the Clause does not protect a defendant
whose liberty has not been impaired by a delay, then it simply does not
protect him; its protections cannot be triggered solely by the government's
bad motives. The Speedy Trial Clause provides no basis for the line the
United States advances between negligent governmental conduct, on the

Therefore, I see no basis for the Court's conclusion thatDoggett is entitled to relief under the Speedy Trial Clause

simply because the Government was negligent in prosecut-ing him and because the resulting delay may have prejudiced
his defense. B

It remains to be considered, however, whether Doggett isentitled to relief under the Speedy Trial Clause because of
the disruption of his life years after the criminal events atissue. In other words, does the Clause protect a right to
repose, free from secret or unknown indictments? In myview, it does not, for much the same reasons set forth above.

The common law recognized no right of criminals to re-pose. "The maxim of our law has always been `Nullum tempus occurrit regi,' [`time does not run against the king'], andas a criminal trial is regarded as an action by the king, it
follows that it may be brought at any time." 2 J. Stephen,A History of the Criminal Law of England 1, 2 (1883) (noting
examples of delays in prosecution ranging from 14 to 35years). See also F. Wharton, Criminal Pleading and Pracone hand, and bad-faith conduct, on the other. As noted in text, the Due
Process Clause is the proper recourse for an accused whose defense is
materially prejudiced by bad-faith governmental behavior. See United
States v. Lovasco, 431 U. S. 783 (1977); cf. Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U. S.
51 (1988).

The Court, thus, is certainly entitled to decide this particular case adversely to the United States on the ground that the concession undercut
the Government's entire argument. But the Court goes much further.
It affirmatively endorses the point conceded, thereby embedding in the
law the mischievous notion that a defendant is entitled to the protection
of the Speedy Trial Clause even though he has suffered none of the harms
against which the Clause protects, as long as the government's conduct is
sufficiently culpable. I would disregard the concession, for much the same
reasons that we sometimes consider an argument that a litigant has
waived. See, e. g., Arcadia v. Ohio Power Co., 498 U. S. 73, 77 (1990);
Kamen v. Kemper Financial Services, Inc., 500 U. S. 90, 99-100 (1991);
United States v. Burke, 504 U. S. 229, 246 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring
in judgment). I see little sense in elevating an unwise concession into
unwise law.

That is not to deny that our legal system has long recog-nized the value of repose, both to the individual and to society. But that recognition finds expression not in the sweep-ing commands of the Constitution, or in the common law, but
in any number of specific statutes of limitations enacted by
the federal and state legislatures. Such statutes not only
protect a defendant from prejudice to his defense (as discussed above), but also balance his interest in repose against
society's interest in the apprehension and punishment of
criminals. Cf. Toussie v. United States, 397 U. S. 112, 114-
115 (1970). In general, the graver the offense, the longer
the limitations period; indeed, many serious offenses, such

(same). These statutes refute the notion that our society
ever has recognized any general right of criminals to repose.

Doggett, however, asks us to hold that a defendant's interest in repose is a value independently protected by the
Speedy Trial Clause. He emphasizes that at the time of his
arrest he was "leading a normal, productive and law-abiding
life," and that his "arrest and prosecution at this late date
interrupted his life as a productive member of society and
forced him to answer for actions taken in the distant past."

illuminate the protections of the Speedy Trial Clause, not totake the measure of one man's life.

There is no basis for concluding that the disruption of anaccused's life years after the commission of his alleged crime
is an evil independently protected by the Speedy TrialClause. Such disruption occurs

regardless of whether theindividual is under indictment during the period of delay.

Thus, had Doggett been indicted shortly before his 1988 ar-rest rather than shortly after his 1980 crime, his repose
would have been equally shattered--but he would not haveeven a colorable speedy trial claim. To recognize a constitutional right to repose is to recognize a right to be triedspeedily

after the offense. That would, of course, convertthe Speedy Trial Clause into a constitutional statute of limitations--a result with no basis in the text or history of theClause or in our precedents.

II
Our constitutional law has become ever more complex inrecent decades. That is, in itself, a regrettable development, for the law draws force from the clarity of its commandand the certainty of its application. As the complexity of
legal doctrines increases, moreover, so too does the dangerthat their foundational principles will become obscured. I
fear that danger has been realized here. So engrossed isthe Court in applying the multifactor balancing test set forth
in Barker that it loses sight of the nature and purpose of thespeedy trial guarantee set forth in the Sixth Amendment.
The Court's error, in my view, lies not so much in its particu-lar application of the

Barker test to the facts of this case,but more fundamentally in its failure to recognize that the

speedy trial guarantee cannot be violated--and thus Barkerdoes not apply at all--when an accused is

entirely unawareof a pending indictment against him.

I do not mean to question Barker's approach, but merelyits scope. We have long recognized that whether an accused

670 DOGGETT v. UNITED STATES

Thomas, J., dissenting
has been denied his right to a speedy trial "depends uponcircumstances." Beavers v. Haubert, 198 U. S. 77, 87 (1905).

By setting forth a number of relevant factors, Barker pro-vided this contextual inquiry with at least a modicum of
structure. But Barker's factors now appear to have takenon a life of their own. Instead of simply guiding the inquiry
whether an individual who has been deprived of a liberty
protected by the Clause is entitled to relief, Barker has be-come a source for new liberties under the Clause. In my

view, application of Barker presupposes that an accused hasbeen subjected to the evils against which the Speedy Trial

Clause is directed--and, as I have explained, neither pretrialdelay nor the disruption of life is itself such an evil.

5

Today's opinion, I fear, will transform the courts of theland into boards of law enforcement supervision. For the

Court compels dismissal of the charges against Doggett notbecause he was harmed in any way by the delay between his
indictment and arrest,6 but simply because the Government'sefforts to catch him are found wanting. Indeed, the Court
expressly concedes that "if the Government had pursuedDoggett with reasonable diligence from his indictment to his
arrest, his speedy trial claim would fail." Ante, at 656. Ourfunction, however, is not to slap the Government on the wrist

5 To recognize that neither of these considerations provides an independent ground for speedy trial relief, of course, is not to say that neither
of them is relevant to speedy trial analysis. Both may be appropriate
considerations in the highly contextual inquiry whether a defendant who
has been deprived of a liberty protected by the Clause is entitled to relief.
See Barker, 407 U. S., at 530-533.

6 It is quite likely, in fact, that the delay benefited Doggett. At the time

of his arrest, he had been living an apparently normal, law-abiding life for
some five years--a point not lost on the District Court Judge, who, instead
of imposing a prison term, sentenced him to three years' probation and a
$1,000 fine. App. 114-115. Thus, the delay gave Doggett the opportunity to prove what most defendants can only promise: that he no longer
posed a threat to society. There can be little doubt that, had he been
tried immediately after his cocaine-importation activities, he would have
received a harsher sentence.

for sloppy work or misplaced priorities, but to protect thelegal rights of those individuals harmed thereby. By divorcing the Speedy Trial Clause from all considerations of preju-dice to an accused, the Court positively invites the Nation's
judges to indulge in ad hoc and result-driven second-guessing of the government's investigatory efforts. Our
Constitution neither contemplates nor tolerates such a role.I respectfully dissent.

INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR KRISHNA CON-SCIOUSNESS, INC.,

et al. v. LEE, SUPERIN-TENDENT OF PORT AUTHORITY POLICE

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 91-155. Argued March 25, 1992--Decided June 26, 1992
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns and operates three major airports in the New York City area and controls certain
terminal areas at the airports (hereinafter terminals), adopted a regulation forbidding, inter alia, the repetitive solicitation of money within
the terminals. However, solicitation is permitted on the sidewalks
outside the terminal buildings. Petitioner International Society for
Krishna Consciousness, Inc. (ISKCON), a not-for-profit religious corporation whose members, among other things, solicit funds in public places
to support their movement, brought suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, alleging that the regulation deprived
its members of their First Amendment rights. The District Court
granted ISKCON summary judgment, concluding that the terminals
were public fora, and that the regulation banning solicitation failed because it was not narrowly tailored to support a compelling state interest.
The Court of Appeals reversed as here relevant. It determined that
the terminals are not public fora, and found that the ban on solicitation
was reasonable.

Held:

1. An airport terminal operated by a public authority is a nonpublic
forum, and thus a ban on solicitation need only satisfy a reasonableness
standard. Pp. 677-683.

(a) The extent to which the Port Authority can restrict expressive
activity on its property depends on the nature of the forum. Regulation of traditional public fora or designated public fora survives only if
it is narrowly drawn to achieve a compelling state interest, but limitations on expressive activity conducted on any other government-owned
property need only be reasonable to survive. Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry
Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 45, 46. Pp. 677-679.

(b) Neither by tradition nor purpose can the terminals be described
as public fora. Airports have not historically been made available for
speech activity. Given the lateness with which the modern air terminal
has made its appearance, it hardly qualifies as a property that has "immemorially . . . time out of mind" been held in the public trust and used

for the purposes of expressive activity. See Hague v. Committee for
Industrial Organization, 307 U. S. 496, 515. Nor have airport operators opened terminals to such activities, see Cornelius v. NAACP Legal
Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 802, as evidenced by the operators' frequent and continuing litigation in this area. Pp. 679-681.

(c) That speech activities may have historically occurred at "transportation nodes" such as rail and bus stations, wharves, and Ellis Island
is not relevant. Many of these sites traditionally have had private ownership. In addition, equating airports with other transportation centers would not take into account differences among the various facilities
that may affect the extent to which such facilities can accommodate
expressive activity. It is unsurprising to find differences among the
facilities. The Port Authority, other airport builders and managers,
and the Federal Government all share the view that terminals are dedicated to the facilitation of efficient air travel, not the solicitation of contributions. Pp. 681-683.

2. The Port Authority's ban on solicitation is reasonable. Solicitation
may have a disruptive effect on business by slowing the path of both
those who must decide whether to contribute and those who must alter
their paths to avoid the solicitation. In addition, a solicitor may cause
duress by targeting the most vulnerable persons or commit fraud by
concealing his affiliation or shortchanging purchasers. The fact that
the targets are likely to be on a tight schedule, and thus are unlikely to
stop and complain to authorities, compounds the problem. The Port
Authority has determined that it can best achieve its legitimate interest
in monitoring solicitation activity to assure that travelers are not interfered with unduly by limiting solicitation to the sidewalk areas outside
the terminals. That area is frequented by an overwhelming percentage
of airport users, making ISKCON's access to the general public quite
complete. Moreover, it would be odd to conclude that the regulation is
unreasonable when the Port Authority has otherwise assured access to a
universally traveled area. While the inconvenience caused by ISKCON
may seem small, the Port Authority could reasonably worry that the
incremental effects of having one group and then another seek such
access could prove quite disruptive. Pp. 683-685.

In this case we consider whether an airport terminal oper-ated by a public authority is a public forum and whether a

literature and soliciting funds to support the religion.' " 925F. 2d 576, 577 (CA2 1991). The primary purpose of this

ritual is raising funds for the movement. Ibid.Respondent Walter Lee, now deceased, was the police
superintendent of the Port Authority of New York and NewJersey and was charged with enforcing the regulation at
issue. The Port Authority owns and operates three majorairports in the greater New York City area: John F. Kennedy
International Airport (Kennedy), La Guardia Airport (LaGuardia), and Newark International Airport (Newark). The
three airports collectively form one of the world's busiestmetropolitan airport complexes. They serve approximately
8% of this country's domestic airline market and more than50% of the trans-Atlantic market. By decade's end they are
expected to serve at least 110 million passengers annually.Id., at 578.

The airports are funded by user fees and operated to makea regulated profit. Id., at 581. Most space at the three airports is leased to commercial airlines, which bear primaryresponsibility for the leasehold. The Port Authority retains
control over unleased portions, including La Guardia's Cen-tral Terminal Building, portions of Kennedy's International
Arrivals Building, and Newark's North Terminal Building(we refer to these areas collectively as the "terminals").
The terminals are generally accessible to the general publicand contain various commercial establishments such as restaurants, snack stands, bars, newsstands, and stores of vari-ous types. Id., at 578. Virtually all who visit the terminals
do so for purposes related to air travel. These visitors prin-cipally include passengers, those meeting or seeing off passengers, flight crews, and terminal employees. Ibid.The Port Authority has adopted a regulation forbidding
within the terminals the repetitive solicitation of money ordistribution of literature. The regulation states:

"1. The following conduct is prohibited within the inte-rior areas of buildings or structures at an air terminal

if conducted by a person to or with passers-by in acontinuous or repetitive manner:

"(a) The sale or distribution of any merchandise, includ-ing but not limited to jewelry, food stuffs, candles, flowers, badges and clothing.
"(b) The sale or distribution of flyers, brochures, pam-phlets, books or any other printed or written material.

"(c) The solicitation and receipt of funds." Id., at578-579.

The regulation governs only the terminals; the Port Au-thority permits solicitation and distribution on the sidewalks
outside the terminal buildings. The regulation effectivelyprohibits ISKCON from performing sankirtan in the terminals. As a result, ISKCON brought suit seeking declara-tory and injunctive relief under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, alleging
that the regulation worked to deprive its members of rightsguaranteed under the First Amendment.

1 The District

Court analyzed the claim under the "traditional publicforum" doctrine. It concluded that the terminals were akin

to public streets, 721 F. Supp. 572, 577 (SDNY 1989), thequintessential traditional public fora. This conclusion in
turn meant that the Port Authority's terminal regulationcould be sustained only if it was narrowly tailored to support
a compelling state interest. Id., at 579. In the absence ofany argument that the blanket prohibition constituted such

1 The suit was filed in 1975. ISKCON originally sought access to both
the airline controlled areas and to the terminals and as a result sued both
respondent and various private airlines. The suit worked a meandering
course, see 721 F. Supp. 572, 573-574 (SDNY 1989), with the private airlines eventually being dismissed and leaving, as the sole remaining issue,
ISKCON's claim against respondent seeking a declaration and injunction
against the regulation. The regulation at issue was not formally promulgated until 1988 although it represents a codification of presuit policy.
App. to Pet. for Cert. 52. As noted in the text, supra this page, respondent concedes that sankirtan may be performed on the sidewalks outside
the terminals.

narrow tailoring, the District Court granted ISKCON sum-mary judgment. Ibid.

The Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed inpart. 925 F. 2d 576 (1991). Relying on our recent decision
in United States v. Kokinda, 497 U. S. 720 (1990), a dividedpanel concluded that the terminals are not public fora. As
a result, the restrictions were required only to satisfy astandard of reasonableness. The Court of Appeals then concluded that, presented with the issue, this Court would findthat the ban on solicitation was reasonable, but the ban on
distribution was not. ISKCON and one of its members, alsoa petitioner here, sought certiorari respecting the Court of
Appeals' decision that the terminals are not public fora andupholding the solicitation ban. Respondent cross-petitioned
respecting the court's holding striking down the distributionban. We granted both petitions, 502 U. S. 1022 (1992), to
resolve whether airport terminals are public fora, a ques-tion on which the Circuits have split

Riley v. National Federation of Blind of
N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 788-789 (1988). But it is also wellsettled that the government need not permit all forms of

Greer v. Spock, 424 U. S. 828 (1976). Where the government is acting as a proprietor, managing its internal op-erations, rather than acting as lawmaker with the power to

regulate or license, its action will not be subjected to theheightened review to which its actions as a lawmaker may be
subject. Kokinda, supra, at 725 (plurality opinion) (citing
Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers v. McElroy, 367 U. S. 886,
896 (1961)). Thus, we have upheld a ban on political advertisements in city-operated transit vehicles, Lehman v.
Shaker Heights, 418 U. S. 298 (1974), even though the city
permitted other types of advertising on those vehicles.
Similarly, we have permitted a school district to limit access
to an internal mail system used to communicate with teachers employed by the district. Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry
Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S. 37 (1983).

These cases reflect, either implicitly or explicitly, a "forum
based" approach for assessing restrictions that the government seeks to place on the use of its property. Cornelius v.
NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 800
(1985). Under this approach, regulation of speech on government property that has traditionally been available for
public expression is subject to the highest scrutiny. Such
regulations survive only if they are narrowly drawn to
achieve a compelling state interest. Perry, 460 U. S., at 45.
The second category of public property is the designated
public forum, whether of a limited or unlimited character--
property that the State has opened for expressive activity
by part or all of the public. Ibid. Regulation of such property is subject to the same limitations as that governing a
traditional public forum. Id., at 46. Finally, there is all re505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:49 PAGES OPINPGT

maining public property. Limitations on expressive activityconducted on this last category of property must survive

only a much more limited review. The challenged regula-tion need only be reasonable, as long as the regulation is not
an effort to suppress the speaker's activity due to disagree-ment with the speaker's view.

Ibid.The parties do not disagree that this is the proper framework. Rather, they disagree whether the airport terminalsare public fora or nonpublic fora. They also disagree
whether the regulation survives the "reasonableness" reviewgoverning nonpublic fora, should that prove the appropriate
category.4 Like the Court of Appeals, we conclude that theterminals are nonpublic fora and that the regulation reasonably limits solicitation.The suggestion that the government has a high burden in
justifying speech restrictions relating to traditional publicfora made its first appearance in

Hague v. Committee forIndustrial Organization, 307 U. S. 496, 515, 516 (1939). Justice Roberts, concluding that individuals have a right to use"streets and parks for communication of views," reasoned
that such a right flowed from the fact that "streets and parks. . . have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the
public and, time out of mind, have been used for purposesof assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and
discussing public questions." We confirmed this observa-tion in

Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 481 (1988), where weheld that a residential street was a public forum.

Our recent cases provide additional guidance on the char-acteristics of a public forum. In Cornelius we noted that a
traditional public forum is property that has as "a principalpurpose . . . the free exchange of ideas." 473 U. S., at 800.
Moreover, consistent with the notion that the government--like other property owners--"has power to preserve the

4 Respondent also argues that the regulations survive under the strict
scrutiny applicable to public fora. We find it unnecessary to reach that
question.

Opinion of the Court

property under its control for the use to which it is lawfullydedicated,"

Greer, 424 U. S., at 836, the government does not
create a public forum by inaction. Nor is a public forumcreated "whenever members of the public are permitted

freely to visit a place owned or operated by the Government." Ibid. The decision to create a public forum mustinstead be made "by intentionally opening a nontraditional

forum for public discourse." Cornelius, supra, at 802. Fi-nally, we have recognized that the location of property also
has bearing because separation from acknowledged publicareas may serve to indicate that the separated property is
a special enclave, subject to greater restriction. United
States v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 179-180 (1983).

These precedents foreclose the conclusion that airport
terminals are public fora. Reflecting the general growth of
the air travel industry, airport terminals have only recently
achieved their contemporary size and character. See H.
Hubbard, M. McClintock, & F. Williams, Airports: Their Location, Administration and Legal Basis 8 (1930) (noting that
the United States had only 807 airports in 1930). But given
the lateness with which the modern air terminal has made its
appearance, it hardly qualifies for the description of having
"immemorially . . . time out of mind" been held in the public
trust and used for purposes of expressive activity. Hague,
supra, at 515. Moreover, even within the rather short history of air transport, it is only "[i]n recent years [that] it has
become a common practice for various religious and nonprofit organizations to use commercial airports as a forum
for the distribution of literature, the solicitation of funds, the
proselytizing of new members, and other similar activities."
45 Fed. Reg. 35314 (1980). Thus, the tradition of airport activity does not demonstrate that airports have historically
been made available for speech activity. Nor can we say
that these particular terminals, or airport terminals generally, have been intentionally opened by their operators to
such activity; the frequent and continuing litigation evidenc505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:49 PAGES OPINPGT

681Cite as: 505 U. S. 672 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
ing the operators' objections belies any such claim. See n. 2,
supra. In short, there can be no argument that society's
time-tested judgment, expressed through acquiescence in acontinuing practice, has resolved the issue in petitioners'

favor.

Petitioners attempt to circumvent the history and practicegoverning airport activity by pointing our attention to the

variety of speech activity that they claim historically oc-curred at various "transportation nodes" such as rail stations, bus stations, wharves, and Ellis Island. Even if wewere inclined to accept petitioners' historical account describing speech activity at these locations, an account respondent contests, we think that such evidence is of little
import for two reasons. First, much of the evidence is irrelevant to public fora analysis, because sites such as bus and
rail terminals traditionally have had private ownership.
See United Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., 455
U. S. 678, 687 (1982); H. Grant & C. Bohi, The Country Railroad Station in America 11-15 (1978); U. S. Dept. of Transportation, The Intercity Bus Terminal Study 31 (Dec. 1984).
The development of privately owned parks that ban speech
activity would not change the public fora status of publicly
held parks. But the reverse is also true. The practices of
privately held transportation centers do not bear on the
government's regulatory authority over a publicly owned
airport.

Second, the relevant unit for our inquiry is an airport, not
"transportation nodes" generally. When new methods of
transportation develop, new methods for accommodating
that transportation are also likely to be needed. And with
each new step, it therefore will be a new inquiry whether
the transportation necessities are compatible with various
kinds of expressive activity. To make a category of "transportation nodes," therefore, would unjustifiably elide what
may prove to be critical differences of which we should rightfully take account. The "security magnet," for example, is

Opinion of the Court

an airport commonplace that lacks a counterpart in busterminals and train stations. And public access to air terminals is also not infrequently restricted--just last yearthe Federal Aviation Administration required airports for
a 4-month period to limit access to areas normally publicly
accessible. See 14 CFR 107.11(f ) (1991) and U. S. Dept. ofTransportation News Release, Office of Assistant Secretary

for Public Affairs, Jan. 18, 1991. To blithely equate air-ports with other transportation centers, therefore, would be
a mistake.The differences among such facilities are unsurprising
since, as the Court of Appeals noted, airports are commercial
establishments funded by users fees and designed to make a
regulated profit, 925 F. 2d, at 581, and where nearly all who
visit do so for some travel related purpose, id., at 578. As
commercial enterprises, airports must provide services attractive to the marketplace. In light of this, it cannot fairly
be said that an airport terminal has as a principal purpose
promoting "the free exchange of ideas." Cornelius v.
NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 800
(1985). To the contrary, the record demonstrates that Port
Authority management considers the purpose of the terminals to be the facilitation of passenger air travel, not the
promotion of expression. Sloane Affidavit, || 11, App. 464;
Defendant's Civil Rule 3(g) Statement, || 39, App. 453. Even
if we look beyond the intent of the Port Authority to the
manner in which the terminals have been operated, the terminals have never been dedicated (except under the threat
of court order) to expression in the form sought to be exercised here: i. e., the solicitation of contributions and the distribution of literature.

The terminals here are far from atypical. Airport builders and managers focus their efforts on providing terminals
that will contribute to efficient air travel. See, e. g., R. Horonjeff & F. McKelvey, Planning and Design of Airports 326
(3d ed. 1983) ("The terminal is used to process passengers

and baggage for the interface with aircraft and the groundtransportation modes"). The Federal Government is in accord; the Secretary of Transportation has been directed topublish a plan for airport development necessary "to anticipate and meet the needs of civil aeronautics, to meet requirements in support of the national defense . . . and to meetidentified needs of the Postal Service." 49 U. S. C. App.

$ 2203(a)(1) (emphasis added); see also 45 Fed. Reg. 35317(1980) ("The purpose for which the [Dulles and National airport] terminal[s] [were] built and maintained is to processand serve air travelers efficiently"). Although many airports have expanded their function beyond merely contributing to efficient air travel, few have included among their
purposes the designation of a forum for solicitation and distribution activities. See supra, at 680-681. Thus, we think
that neither by tradition nor purpose can the terminals be
described as satisfying the standards we have previously set
out for identifying a public forum.

The restrictions here challenged, therefore, need only satisfy a requirement of reasonableness. We reiterate what we
stated in Kokinda: The restriction " `need only be reasonable; it need not be the most reasonable or the only reasonable limitation.' " 497 U. S., at 730 (plurality opinion) (quoting Cornelius, supra, at 808). We have no doubt that under
this standard the prohibition on solicitation passes muster.

We have on many prior occasions noted the disruptive effect that solicitation may have on business. "Solicitation requires action by those who would respond: The individual
solicited must decide whether or not to contribute (which
itself might involve reading the solicitor's literature or hearing his pitch), and then, having decided to do so, reach for a
wallet, search it for money, write a check, or produce a credit
card." Kokinda, supra, at 734; see Heffron, 452 U. S., at 663
(Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).
Passengers who wish to avoid the solicitor may have to alter
their paths, slowing both themselves and those around them.

CONSCIOUSNESS, INC. v. LEE

Opinion of the Court

The result is that the normal flow of traffic is impeded. Id.,at 653. This is especially so in an airport, where "[a]ir

travelers, who are often weighted down by cumbersome bag-gage . . . may be hurrying to catch a plane or to arrange
ground transportation." 925 F. 2d, at 582. Delays may be
particularly costly in this setting, as a flight missed by onlya few minutes can result in hours worth of subsequent

inconvenience.In addition, face-to-face solicitation presents risks of duress that are an appropriate target of regulation. The skill-ful, and unprincipled, solicitor can target the most vulnerable, including those accompanying children or those suffering
physical impairment and who cannot easily avoid the solicitation. See, e. g., International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Barber, 506 F. Supp. 147, 159-163 (NDNY 1980),
rev'd on other grounds, 650 F. 2d 430 (CA2 1981). The unsavory solicitor can also commit fraud through concealment of
his affiliation or through deliberate efforts to shortchange
those who agree to purchase. 506 F. Supp., 159-163. See
45 Fed. Reg. 35314-35315 (1980). Compounding this problem is the fact that, in an airport, the targets of such activity
frequently are on tight schedules. This in turn makes such
visitors unlikely to stop and formally complain to airport authorities. As a result, the airport faces considerable difficulty in achieving its legitimate interest in monitoring solicitation activity to assure that travelers are not interfered
with unduly.

The Port Authority has concluded that its interest in monitoring the activities can best be accomplished by limiting solicitation and distribution to the sidewalk areas outside the
terminals. Sloane Supp. Affidavit, || 11, App. 514. This
sidewalk area is frequented by an overwhelming percentage
of airport users, see id., at || 14, App. 515-516 (noting that
no more than 3% of air travelers passing through the terminals are doing so on intraterminal flights, i. e., transferring
planes). Thus the resulting access of those who would so505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:49 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
licit the general public is quite complete. In turn we think itwould be odd to conclude that the Port Authority's terminal

regulation is unreasonable despite the Port Authority havingotherwise assured access to an area universally traveled.

The inconveniences to passengers and the burdens on PortAuthority officials flowing from solicitation activity may
seem small, but viewed against the fact that "pedestrian con-gestion is one of the greatest problems facing the three terminals," 925 F. 2d, at 582, the Port Authority could reason-ably worry that even such incremental effects would prove
quite disruptive.5 Moreover, "[t]he justification for the Ruleshould not be measured by the disorder that would result
from granting an exemption solely to ISKCON." Heffron,
supra, at 652. For if ISKCON is given access, so too mustother groups. "Obviously, there would be a much larger

threat to the State's interest in crowd control if all other
religious, nonreligious, and noncommercial organizationscould likewise move freely." 452 U. S., at 653. As a result,

we conclude that the solicitation ban is reasonable.For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of
Appeals sustaining the ban on solicitation in Port Authorityterminals is

Affirmed.

or written material within the terminals. 925 F. 2d 576(CA2 1991). I would affirm both parts of that judgment.

I concur in the Court's opinion in No. 91-155 and agreethat publicly owned airports are not public fora. Unlike
public streets and parks, both of which our First Amendment
jurisprudence has identified as "traditional public fora," air-ports do not count among their purposes the "free exchange

of ideas," Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund,
Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 800 (1985); they have not "by long tradition or by government fiat . . . been devoted to assembly anddebate,"

Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn.,
460 U. S. 37, 45 (1983); nor have they "time out of mind, . . .
been used for purposes of . . . communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions," Hague v.
Committee for Industrial Organization, 307 U. S. 496, 515
(1939). Although most airports do not ordinarily restrict
public access, "[p]ublicly owned or operated property does
not become a `public forum' simply because members of the
public are permitted to come and go at will." United States
v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 177 (1983); see also Greer v. Spock,
424 U. S. 828, 836 (1976). "[W]hen government property is
not dedicated to open communication the government may--
without further justification--restrict use to those who participate in the forum's official business." Perry, supra, at
53. There is little doubt that airports are among those publicly owned facilities that could be closed to all except those
who have legitimate business there. See Grace, supra, at
178. Public access to airports is thus not "inherent in the
open nature of the locations," as it is for most streets and
parks, but is rather a "matter of grace by government officials." United States v. Kokinda, 497 U. S. 720, 743 (1990)
(Brennan, J., dissenting). I also agree with the Court that
the Port Authority has not expressly opened its airports to
the types of expression at issue here, see ante, at 680-681,
and therefore has not created a "limited" or "designated"
public forum relevant to this case.

687Cite as: 505 U. S. 672 (1992)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
For these reasons, the Port Authority's restrictions onsolicitation and leafletting within the airport terminals do

not qualify for the strict scrutiny that applies to restrictionof speech in public fora. That airports are not public
fora, however, does not mean that the government can restrict speech in whatever way it likes. "The Government,even when acting in its proprietary capacity, does not enjoy

absolute freedom from First Amendment constraints."
Kokinda, supra, at 725 (plurality opinion). For example, in
Board of Airport Comm'rs of Los Angeles v. Jews for Jesus,
Inc., 482 U. S. 569 (1987), we unanimously struck down a regulation that prohibited "all First Amendment activities" in
the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) without even
reaching the question whether airports were public fora.
Id., at 574-575. We found it "obvious that such a ban cannot
be justified even if LAX were a nonpublic forum because
no conceivable governmental interest would justify such an
absolute prohibition of speech." Id., at 575. Moreover, we
have consistently stated that restrictions on speech in nonpublic fora are valid only if they are "reasonable" and "not an
effort to suppress expression merely because public officials
oppose the speaker's view." Perry, supra, at 46; see also
Kokinda, supra, at 731; Cornelius, supra, at 800; Lehman v.
Shaker Heights, 418 U. S. 298, 303 (1974). The determination that airports are not public fora thus only begins our
inquiry.

"The reasonableness of the Government's restriction [on
speech in a nonpublic forum] must be assessed in light of the
purpose of the forum and all the surrounding circumstances."
Cornelius, supra, at 809. " `[C]onsideration of a forum's
special attributes is relevant to the constitutionality of a
regulation since the significance of the governmental interest must be assessed in light of the characteristic nature
and function of the particular forum involved.' " Kokinda,
supra, at 732, quoting Heffron v. International Soc. for
Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U. S. 640, 650-651 (1981).

688 INTERNATIONAL SOC. FOR KRISHNA

CONSCIOUSNESS, INC. v. LEE

Opinion of O'Connor, J.

In this case, the "special attributes" and "surrounding cir-cumstances" of the airports operated by the Port Authority

are determinative. Not only has the Port Authority chosen
not to limit access to the airports under its control, it has
created a huge complex open to travelers and nontravelers
alike. The airports house restaurants, cafeterias, snackbars, coffee shops, cocktail lounges, post offices, banks, telegraph offices, clothing shops, drug stores, food stores, nurser-ies, barber shops, currency exchanges, art exhibits, commercial advertising displays, bookstores, newsstands, dentaloffices, and private clubs. See App. 183-185 (Newark);

id.,
at 185-186 (JFK); id., at 190-192 (La Guardia). The International Arrivals Building at JFK Airport even has two
branches of Bloomingdale's. Id., at 185-186.

We have said that a restriction on speech in a nonpublic
forum is "reasonable" when it is "consistent with the [government's] legitimate interest in `preserv[ing] the property
. . . for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated.' " Perry,
supra, at 50-51, quoting Postal Service v. Council of Greenburgh Civic Assns., 453 U. S. 114, 129-130 (1981) (internal
quotation marks omitted). Ordinarily, this inquiry is relatively straightforward, because we have almost always been
confronted with cases where the fora at issue were discrete,
single-purpose facilities. See, e. g., Kokinda, supra (dedicated sidewalk between parking lot and post office); Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S.
788 (1985) (literature for charity drive); City Council of Los
Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U. S. 789 (1984) (utility
poles); Perry, supra (interschool mail system); Postal Service v. Council of Greenburgh Civic Assns., supra (household
mail boxes); Adderley v. Florida, 385 U. S. 39 (1966) (curtilage of jailhouse). The Port Authority urges that this case
is no different and contends that it, too, has dedicated its
airports to a single purpose--facilitating air travel--and that
the speech it seeks to prohibit is not consistent with that
purpose. But the wide range of activities promoted by the

505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 PAGES OPINPGT

689Cite as: 505 U. S. 672 (1992)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Port Authority is no more directly related to facilitating airtravel than are the types of activities in which the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. (ISKCON),wishes to engage. See

Jews for Jesus, supra, at 576 ("The
line between airport-related speech and nonairport-related
speech is, at best, murky"). In my view, the Port Authorityis operating a shopping mall as well as an airport. The

reasonableness inquiry, therefore, is not whether the re-strictions on speech are "consistent with . . . preserving the
property" for air travel, Perry, supra, at 50-51 (internalquotation marks and citation omitted), but whether they are
reasonably related to maintaining the multipurpose environment that the Port Authority has deliberately created.

Applying that standard, I agree with the Court in No. 91-
155 that the ban on solicitation is reasonable. Face-to-face
solicitation is incompatible with the airport's functioning in
a way that the other, permitted activities are not. We have
previously observed that "[s]olicitation impedes the normal
flow of traffic [because it] requires action by those who would
respond: The individual solicited must decide whether or not
to contribute (which itself might involve reading the solicitor's literature or hearing his pitch), and then, having decided to do so, reach for a wallet, search it for money, write
a check, or produce a credit card. . . . As residents of metropolitan areas know from daily experience, confrontation by a
person asking for money disrupts passage and is more intrusive and intimidating than an encounter with a person giving
out information." Kokinda, 497 U. S., at 733-734 (plurality
opinion) (citations omitted); id., at 739 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (accepting Postal Service's judgment that,
given its past experience, "in-person solicitation deserves
different treatment from alternative forms of solicitation and
expression"); Heffron, supra, at 657 (Brennan, J., concurring
in part and dissenting in part) (upholding partial restriction
on solicitation at fairgrounds because of state interest "in
protecting its fairgoers from fraudulent, deceptive, and mis505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 PAGES OPINPGT

leading solicitation practices"); 452 U. S., at 665 (Blackmun,
J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (upholding partial restriction on solicitation because of the "crowd controlproblems" it creates). The record in this case confirms that

the problems of congestion and fraud that we have identified
with solicitation in other contexts have also proved true inthe airports' experience. See App. 67-111 (affidavits). Because airport users are frequently facing time constraints,and are traveling with luggage or children, the ban on solicitation is a reasonable means of avoiding disruption of an air-port's operation.

In my view, however, the regulation banning leafletting--
or, in the Port Authority's words, the "continuous or repetitive . . . distribution of . . . printed or written material"--
cannot be upheld as reasonable on this record. I therefore
concur in the judgment in No. 91-339, post, p. 830, striking
down that prohibition. While the difficulties posed by solicitation in a nonpublic forum are sufficiently obvious that
its regulation may "rin[g] of common-sense," Kokinda, 497
U. S., at 734 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted),
the same is not necessarily true of leafletting. To the contrary, we have expressly noted that leafletting does not entail the same kinds of problems presented by face-to-face solicitation. Specifically, "[o]ne need not ponder the contents
of a leaflet or pamphlet in order mechanically to take it out
of someone's hand . . . . `The distribution of literature does
not require that the recipient stop in order to receive the
message the speaker wishes to convey; instead the recipient
is free to read the message at a later time.' " Ibid. (plurality
opinion), quoting Heffron, supra, at 665 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). With the possible
exception of avoiding litter, see Schneider v. State (Town of
Irvington), 308 U. S. 147, 162 (1939), it is difficult to point to
any problems intrinsic to the act of leafletting that would
make it naturally incompatible with a large, multipurpose
forum such as those at issue here.

691Cite as: 505 U. S. 672 (1992)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
We have only once before considered restrictions onspeech in a nonpublic forum that sustained the kind of extensive, nonforum-related activity found in the Port Authorityairports, and I believe that case is instructive. In

Greer v.
Spock, 424 U. S. 828 (1976), the Court held that even though
certain parts of a military base were open to the public, theystill did not constitute a public forum in light of " `the historically unquestioned power of [a] commanding officer sum-marily to exclude civilians from the area of his command.' "
Id., at 838, quoting Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers v. McElroy, 367 U. S. 886, 893 (1961). The Court then proceeded
to uphold a regulation banning the distribution of literature
without the prior approval of the base commander. In so
doing, the Court "emphasized" that the regulation on
leafletting did "not authorize the Fort Dix authorities to prohibit the distribution of conventional political campaign literature." Rather, the Court explained, "[t]he only publications that a military commander may disapprove are those
that he finds constitute `a clear danger to [military] loyalty,
discipline, or morale' " and that "[t]here is nothing in the
Constitution that disables a military commander from acting
to avert what he perceives to be a clear danger to the loyalty,
discipline, or morale of troops on the base under his command." 424 U. S., at 840 (citation omitted). In contrast, the
regulation at issue in this case effects an absolute prohibition
and is not supported by any independent justification outside
of the problems caused by the accompanying solicitation.

Moreover, the Port Authority has not offered any justifications or record evidence to support its ban on the distribution of pamphlets alone. Its argument is focused instead on
the problems created when literature is distributed in conjunction with a solicitation plea. Although we do not "requir[e] that . . . proof be present to justify the denial of access
to a nonpublic forum on grounds that the proposed use may
disrupt the property's intended function," Perry, 460 U. S.,
at 52, n. 12, we have required some explanation as to why

CONSCIOUSNESS, INC. v. LEE

Opinion of O'Connor, J.

certain speech is inconsistent with the intended use of the
forum. In Kokinda, for example, we upheld a regulation
banning solicitation on postal property in part because the
Postal Service's 30-year history of regulation of solicitation
in post offices demonstrated that permitting solicitation interfered with its postal mission. 497 U. S., at 731-732 (plurality opinion). Similarly, in Cornelius, we held that it was
reasonable to exclude political advocacy groups from a fundraising campaign targeted at federal employees in part because "the record amply support[ed] an inference" that the
participation of those groups would have jeopardized the success of the campaign. 473 U. S., at 810. Here, the Port Authority has provided no independent reason for prohibiting
leafletting, and the record contains no information from
which we can draw an inference that would support its ban.
Because I cannot see how peaceful pamphleteering is incompatible with the multipurpose environment of the Port Authority airports, I cannot accept that a total ban on that activity is reasonable without an explanation as to why such a
restriction "preserv[es] the property" for the several uses
to which it has been put. Perry, supra, at 50-51 (internal
quotation marks and citation omitted).

Of course, it is still open for the Port Authority to promulgate regulations of the time, place, and manner of leafletting
which are "content-neutral, are narrowly tailored to serve
a significant government interest, and leave open ample alternative channels of communication." Perry, supra, at 45;
Postal Service, 453 U. S., at 132. For example, during the
many years that this litigation has been in progress, the Port
Authority has not banned sankirtan completely from JFK
International Airport, but has restricted it to a relatively
uncongested part of the airport terminals, the same part that
houses the airport chapel. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5-6, 46-47. In
my view, that regulation meets the standards we have
applied to time, place, and manner restrictions of protected

I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals inboth No. 91-155 and No. 91-339.

Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice Blackmun, Justice Stevens, and Justice Souter join as to Part I, con-curring in the judgments.*

While I concur in the judgments affirming in these cases,my analysis differs in substantial respects from that of the
Court. In my view the airport corridors and shopping areasoutside of the passenger security zones, areas operated by
the Port Authority, are public forums, and speech in thoseplaces is entitled to protection against all government regulation inconsistent with public forum principles. The PortAuthority's blanket prohibition on the distribution or sale of
literature cannot meet those stringent standards, and I agreeit is invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
The Port Authority's rule disallowing in-person solicitationof money for immediate payment, however, is in my view a
narrow and valid regulation of the time, place, and mannerof protected speech in this forum, or else is a valid regulation
of the nonspeech element of expressive conduct. I wouldsustain the Port Authority's ban on solicitation and receipt
of funds. I

forum doctrine ought not to be a jurisprudence of categoriesrather than ideas or convert what was once an analysis protective of expression into one which grants the governmentauthority to restrict speech by fiat. I believe that the
Court's public forum analysis in these cases is inconsistent
with the values underlying the Speech and Press Clauses ofthe First Amendment.

Our public forum analysis has its origins in Justice Rob-erts' rather sweeping dictum in

Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization, 307 U. S. 496, 515 (1939); see also
ante, at 679. The doctrine was not stated with much precision or elaboration, though, until our more recent decisionsin

Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460
U. S. 37 (1983), and Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &
Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788 (1985). These cases describea three-part analysis to designate government-owned property as either a traditional public forum, a designated publicforum, or a nonpublic forum.

Perry, supra, at 45-46; ante,
at 678-679. The Court today holds that traditional publicforums are limited to public property which have as " `a principal purpose . . . the free exchange of ideas,' " ante, at 679(quoting

Cornelius, supra, at 800); ante, at 686 (O'Connor,
J., concurring in No. 91-155 and concurring in judgment in
No. 91-339 (hereinafter opinion of O'Connor, J.)); and that
this purpose must be evidenced by a longstanding historical
practice of permitting speech, ante, at 679; ante, at 686 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). The Court also holds that designated
forums consist of property which the government intends to
open for public discourse. Ante, at 680, citing Cornelius,
supra, at 802; ante, at 686 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). All
other types of property are, in the Court's view, nonpublic
forums (in other words, not public forums), and governmentimposed restrictions of speech in these places will be upheld
so long as reasonable and viewpoint neutral. Under this
categorical view the application of public forum analysis to
airport terminals seems easy. Airports are of course public
spaces of recent vintage, and so there can be no time-honored

tradition associated with airports of permitting free speech.
Ante, at 680. And because governments have often attempted to restrict speech within airports, it follows a fortiori under the Court's analysis that they cannot be so-called
"designated" forums. Ante, at 680-681. So, the Court concludes, airports must be nonpublic forums, subject to mini-mal First Amendment protection.

This analysis is flawed at its very beginning. It leavesthe government with almost unlimited authority to restrict
speech on its property by doing nothing more than articulat-ing a non-speech-related purpose for the area, and it leaves
almost no scope for the development of new public forumsabsent the rare approval of the government. The Court's
error lies in its conclusion that the public forum status of
public property depends on the government's defined pur-pose for the property, or on an explicit decision by the government to dedicate the property to expressive activity. Inmy view, the inquiry must be an objective one, based on the
actual, physical characteristics and uses of the property.The fact that in our public forum cases we discuss and analyze these precise characteristics tends to support my posi-tion.

Perry, supra, at 46-48; Cornelius, supra, at 804-806;
Kokinda, supra, at 727-729 (plurality opinion).

The First Amendment is a limitation on government, not
a grant of power. Its design is to prevent the government
from controlling speech. Yet under the Court's view the authority of the government to control speech on its property
is paramount, for in almost all cases the critical step in the
Court's analysis is a classification of the property that turns
on the government's own definition or decision, unconstrained by an independent duty to respect the speech its
citizens can voice there. The Court acknowledges as much,
by reintroducing today into our First Amendment law a
strict doctrinal line between the proprietary and regulatory
functions of government which I thought had been abandoned long ago. Ante, at 678; compare Davis v. Massachusetts, 167 U. S. 43 (1897), with Hague, supra, at 515; Schnei505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 PAGES OPINPGT

der v. State (Town of Irvington), 308 U. S. 147 (1939); and
Grayned v. Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 115-116 (1972).

The Court's approach is contrary to the underlying pur-poses of the public forum doctrine. The liberties protected

by our doctrine derive from the Assembly, as well as the
Speech and Press Clauses of the First Amendment, and areessential to a functioning democracy. See Kalven, The Concept of the Public Forum: Cox v. Louisiana, 1965 S. Ct. Rev.1, 14, 19. Public places are of necessity the locus for discussion of public issues, as well as protest against arbitrary gov-ernment action. At the heart of our jurisprudence lies the
principle that in a free nation citizens must have the right togather and speak with other persons in public places. The
recognition that certain government-owned property is a
public forum provides open notice to citizens that their free-doms may be exercised there without fear of a censorial government, adding tangible reinforcement to the idea that weare a free people.

A fundamental tenet of our Constitution is that the gov-ernment is subject to constraints which private persons are
not. The public forum doctrine vindicates that principle byrecognizing limits on the government's control over speech
activities on property suitable for free expression. The doctrine focuses on the physical characteristics of the property
because government ownership is the source of its purported
authority to regulate speech. The right of speech protected
by the doctrine, however, comes not from a Supreme Court
dictum but from the constitutional recognition that the government cannot impose silence on a free people.

The Court's analysis rests on an inaccurate view of history.
The notion that traditional public forums are properties that
have public discourse as their principal purpose is a most
doubtful fiction. The types of property that we have recognized as the quintessential public forums are streets, parks,
and sidewalks. Cornelius, 473 U. S., at 802; Frisby v.
Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 480-481 (1988). It would seem apparent that the principal purpose of streets and sidewalks, like

airports, is to facilitate transportation, not public discourse,and we have recognized as much.

Schneider v. State, supra,
at 160. Similarly, the purpose for the creation of publicparks may be as much for beauty and open space as for discourse. Thus under the Court's analysis, even the quintessential public forums would appear to lack the necessary ele-ments of what the Court defines as a public forum.

The effect of the Court's narrow view of the first categoryof public forums is compounded by its description of the second purported category, the so-called "designated" forum.The requirements for such a designation are so stringent
that I cannot be certain whether the category has any con-tent left at all. In any event, it seems evident that under
the Court's analysis today few, if any, types of property other
than those already recognized as public forums will be ac-corded that status.

The Court's answer to these objections appears to be arecourse to history as justifying its recognition of streets,
parks, and sidewalks, but apparently no other types of gov-ernment property, as traditional public forums.

Ante, at
681. The Court ignores the fact that the purpose of the pub-lic forum doctrine is to give effect to the broad command of

the First Amendment to protect speech from governmental
interference. The jurisprudence is rooted in historic practice, but it is not tied to a narrow textual command limiting
the recognition of new forums. In my view the policies underlying the doctrine cannot be given effect unless we recognize that open, public spaces and thoroughfares that are suitable for discourse may be public forums, whatever their
historical pedigree and without concern for a precise classification of the property. There is support in our precedents
for such a view. See Lehman v. Shaker Heights, 418 U. S.
298, 303 (1974) (plurality opinion); Hague, 307 U. S., at 515
(speaking of "streets and public places" as forums). Without
this recognition our forum doctrine retains no relevance in
times of fast-changing technology and increasing insularity.
In a country where most citizens travel by automobile, and

parks all too often become locales for crime rather than so-cial intercourse, our failure to recognize the possibility that

new types of government property may be appropriateforums for speech will lead to a serious curtailment of our
expressive activity.

One of the places left in our mobile society that is suit-able for discourse is a metropolitan airport. It is of particular importance to recognize that such spaces are publicforums because in these days an airport is one of the few
government-owned spaces where many persons have exten-sive contact with other members of the public. Given that
private spaces of similar character are not subject to the dictates of the First Amendment, see Hudgens v. NLRB, 424
U. S. 507 (1976), it is critical that we preserve these areas for
protected speech. In my view, our public forum doctrine
must recognize this reality, and allow the creation of public
forums that do not fit within the narrow tradition of streets,
sidewalks, and parks. We have allowed flexibility in our
doctrine to meet changing technologies in other areas of constitutional interpretation, see, e. g., Katz v. United States,
389 U. S. 347 (1967), and I believe we must do the same with
the First Amendment.

I agree with the Court that government property of a type
which by history and tradition has been available for speech
activity must continue to be recognized as a public forum.
Ante, at 679. In my view, however, constitutional protection
is not confined to these properties alone. Under the proper
circumstances I would accord public forum status to other
forms of property, regardless of their ancient or contemporary origins and whether or not they fit within a narrow
historic tradition. If the objective, physical characteristics
of the property at issue and the actual public access and uses
that have been permitted by the government indicate that
expressive activity would be appropriate and compatible
with those uses, the property is a public forum. The most
important considerations in this analysis are whether the

505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 PAGES OPINPGT

699Cite as: 505 U. S. 672 (1992)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgments
property shares physical similarities with more traditionalpublic forums, whether the government has permitted or acquiesced in broad public access to the property, and whetherexpressive activity would tend to interfere in a significant
way with the uses to which the government has as a factual
matter dedicated the property. In conducting the last in-quiry, courts must consider the consistency of those uses

with expressive activities in general, rather than the specificsort of speech at issue in the case before it; otherwise the
analysis would be one not of classification but rather of case-by-case balancing, and would provide little guidance to the
State regarding its discretion to regulate speech. Courts
must also consider the availability of reasonable time, place,
and manner restrictions in undertaking this compatibility
analysis. The possibility of some theoretical inconsistency
between expressive activities and the property's uses should
not bar a finding of a public forum, if those inconsistencies
can be avoided through simple and permitted regulations.

The second category of the Court's jurisprudence, the socalled designated forum, provides little, if any, additional
protection for speech. Where government property does
not satisfy the criteria of a public forum, the government
retains the power to dedicate the property for speech,
whether for all expressive activity or for limited purposes
only. See ante, at 678; Perry, 460 U. S., at 45-46; Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U. S. 546 (1975). I do
not quarrel with the fact that speech must often be restricted on property of this kind to retain the purpose for
which it has been designated. And I recognize that when
property has been designated for a particular expressive use,
the government may choose to eliminate that designation.
But this increases the need to protect speech in other places,
where discourse may occur free of such restrictions. In
some sense the government always retains authority to close
a public forum, by selling the property, changing its physical
character, or changing its principal use. Otherwise the

CONSCIOUSNESS, INC. v. LEE

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgments

State would be prohibited from closing a park, or eliminatinga street or sidewalk, which no one has understood the public

forum doctrine to require. The difference is that whenproperty is a protected public forum the State may not by
fiat assert broad control over speech or expressive activities;
it must alter the objective physical character or uses of theproperty, and bear the attendant costs, to change the property's forum status.Under this analysis, it is evident that the public spaces of
the Port Authority's airports are public forums. First, theDistrict Court made detailed findings regarding the physical
similarities between the Port Authority's airports and public
streets. 721 F. Supp. 572, 576-577 (SDNY 1989). These
findings show that the public spaces in the airports are
broad, public thoroughfares full of people and lined with
stores and other commercial activities. An airport corridor
is of course not a street, but that is not the proper inquiry.
The question is one of physical similarities, sufficient to suggest that the airport corridor should be a public forum for
the same reasons that streets and sidewalks have been
treated as public forums by the people who use them.

Second, the airport areas involved here are open to the
public without restriction. Ibid. Plaintiffs do not seek access to the secured areas of the airports, nor do I suggest
that these areas would be public forums. And while most
people who come to the Port Authority's airports do so for
a reason related to air travel, either because they are passengers or because they are picking up or dropping off
passengers, this does not distinguish an airport from streets
or sidewalks, which most people use for travel. See supra,
at 696-697. Further, the group visiting the airports encompasses a vast portion of the public: In 1986 the Authority's
three airports served over 78 million passengers. It is the
very breadth and extent of the public's use of airports that
makes it imperative to protect speech rights there. Of
course, airport operators retain authority to restrict public

505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 PAGES OPINPGT

701Cite as: 505 U. S. 672 (1992)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgments
access when necessary, for instance to respond to special se-curity concerns. But if the Port Authority allows the uses

and open access to airports that is shown on this record, itcannot argue that some vestigial power to change its practices bars the conclusion that its airports are public forums,
any more than the power to bulldoze a park bars a findingthat a public forum exists so long as the open use does.

Third, and perhaps most important, it is apparent from therecord, and from the recent history of airports, that when
adequate time, place, and manner regulations are in place,expressive activity is quite compatible with the uses of major
airports. The Port Authority's primary argument to the
contrary is that the problem of congestion in its airports'
corridors makes expressive activity inconsistent with the
airports' primary purpose, which is to facilitate air travel.
The First Amendment is often inconvenient. But that is beside the point. Inconvenience does not absolve the government of its obligation to tolerate speech. The Authority
makes no showing that any real impediments to the smooth
functioning of the airports cannot be cured with reasonable
time, place, and manner regulations. In fact, the history of
the Authority's own airports, as well as other major airports
in this country, leaves little doubt that such a solution is
quite feasible. The Authority has for many years permitted
expressive activities by petitioners and others, without any
apparent interference with its ability to meet its transportation purposes. App. 462, 469-470; see also ante, at 691-692
(opinion of O'Connor, J.). The Federal Aviation Administration, in its operation of the airports of the Nation's capital, has issued rules which allow regulated expressive activity within specified areas, without any suggestion that the
speech would be incompatible with the airports' business.
14 CFR $$ 159.93, 159.94 (1992). And, in fact, expressive activity has been a commonplace feature of our Nation's major
airports for many years, in part because of the wide consensus among the Courts of Appeals, prior to the decision in

these cases, that the public spaces of airports are public fo-rums. See,

e. g., Chicago Area Military Project v. Chicago,
508 F. 2d 921 (CA7), cert. denied, 421 U. S. 992 (1975); Fernandes v. Limmer, 663 F. 2d 619 (CA5 1981), cert. dism'd, 458

Jews for Jesus, Inc. v. Board
of Airport Comm'rs, 785 F. 2d 791 (CA9 1986), aff 'd on othergrounds, 482 U. S. 569 (1987);

Jamison v. St. Louis, 828 F. 2d
1280 (CA8 1987), cert. denied, 485 U. S. 987 (1988). As theDistrict Court recognized, the logical consequence of the

Port Authority's congestion argument is that the crowded
streets and sidewalks of major cities cannot be public forums.
721 F. Supp., at 578. These problems have been dealt with
in the past, and in other settings, through proper time, place,
and manner restrictions; and the Port Authority does not
make any showing that similar regulations would not be effective in its airports. The Port Authority makes a halfhearted argument that the special security concerns associated with airports suggest they are not public forums; but
this position is belied by the unlimited public access the Authority allows to its airports. This access demonstrates that
the Port Authority does not consider the general public to
pose a serious security threat, and there is no evidence in
the record that persons engaged in expressive activities are
any different.

The danger of allowing the government to suppress speech
is shown in the cases now before us. A grant of plenary
power allows the government to tilt the dialog heard by the
public, to exclude many, more marginal, voices. The first
challenged Port Authority regulation establishes a flat prohibition on "[t]he sale or distribution of flyers, brochures, pamphlets, books or any other printed or written material," if
conducted within the airport terminal, "in a continuous or
repetitive manner." We have long recognized that the right
to distribute flyers and literature lies at the heart of the lib505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 PAGES OPINPGT

703Cite as: 505 U. S. 672 (1992)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgments
erties guaranteed by the Speech and Press Clauses of theFirst Amendment. See, e. g., Schneider v. State (Town of

Irvington), 308 U. S. 147 (1939); Murdock v. Pennsylvania,319 U. S. 105 (1943). The Port Authority's rule, which prohibits almost all such activity, is among the most restrictivepossible of those liberties. The regulation is in fact so broad
and restrictive of speech, Justice O'Connor finds it voideven under the standards applicable to government regulations in nonpublic forums. Ante, at 691-693. I have no dif-ficulty deciding the regulation cannot survive the far more
stringent rules applicable to regulations in public forums.The regulation is not drawn in narrow terms, and it does not
leave open ample alternative channels for communication.See Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791 (1989).
The Port Authority's concerns with the problem of conges-tion can be addressed through narrow restrictions on the
time and place of expressive activity. See ante, at 692-693(opinion of

O'Connor, J.). I would strike down the regula-tion as an unconstitutional restriction of speech.

II
It is my view, however, that the Port Authority's ban onthe "solicitation and receipt of funds" within its airport terminals should be upheld under the standards applicable tospeech regulations in public forums. The regulation may be
upheld as either a reasonable time, place, and manner restric-tion, or as a regulation directed at the nonspeech element of
expressive conduct. The two standards have considerableoverlap in a case like this one.

It is well settled that "even in a public forum the govern-ment may impose reasonable restrictions on the time, place,
or manner of protected speech, provided the restrictions `arejustified without reference to the content of the regulated
speech, that they are narrowly tailored to serve a significantgovernmental interest, and that they leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.' "

Ward, supra, at 791 (quoting Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288, 293 (1984)). We have held
further that the government in appropriate circumstancesmay regulate conduct, even if the conduct has an expressive

component. United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367 (1968).
And in several recent cases we have recognized that thestandards for assessing time, place, and manner restrictions

are little, if any, different from the standards applicable toregulations of conduct with an expressive component.
Clark, supra, at 298, and n. 8; Ward, supra, at 798; Barnesv.

Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U. S. 560, 566 (1991) (plurality opinion); see generally Kalven, 1965 S. Ct. Rev., at 23, 27 (arguing
that all speech contains elements of conduct which may be
regulated). The confluence of the two tests is well demonstrated by a case like this, where the government regulation
at issue can be described with equal accuracy as a regulation
of the manner of expression, or as a regulation of conduct
with an expressive component.

I am in full agreement with the statement of the Court
that solicitation is a form of protected speech. Ante, at 677;
see also Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc.,
487 U. S. 781, 788-789 (1988); Schaumburg v. Citizens for a
Better Environment, 444 U. S. 620, 629 (1980); Murdock v.
Pennsylvania, supra. If the Port Authority's solicitation
regulation prohibited all speech that requested the contribution of funds, I would conclude that it was a direct, contentbased restriction of speech in clear violation of the First
Amendment. The Authority's regulation does not prohibit
all solicitation, however; it prohibits the "solicitation and receipt of funds." I do not understand this regulation to prohibit all speech that solicits funds. It reaches only personal
solicitations for immediate payment of money. Otherwise,
the "receipt of funds" phrase would be written out of the
provision. The regulation does not cover, for example, the
distribution of preaddressed envelopes along with a plea to
contribute money to the distributor or his organization. As

505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 PAGES OPINPGT

705Cite as: 505 U. S. 672 (1992)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgments
I understand the restriction it is directed only at the physicalexchange of money, which is an element of conduct interwoven with otherwise expressive solicitation. In otherwords, the regulation permits expression that solicits funds,
but limits the manner of that expression to forms other than
the immediate receipt of money.So viewed, I believe the Port Authority's rule survives our

test for speech restrictions in the public forum. In-personsolicitation of funds, when combined with immediate receipt
of that money, creates a risk of fraud and duress that is wellrecognized, and that is different in kind from other forms of
expression or conduct. Travelers who are unfamiliar with
the airport, perhaps even unfamiliar with this country, its
customs, and its language, are an easy prey for the money
solicitor. I agree in full with the Court's discussion of these
dangers in No. 91-155. Ante, at 683-684; ante, at 689-690
(opinion of O'Connor, J.). I would add that our precedents,
as well as the actions of coordinate branches of Government,
support this conclusion. We have in the past recognized
that in-person solicitation has been associated with coercive
or fraudulent conduct. Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S.
296, 306 (1940); Riley, supra, at 800; Heffron v. International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U. S. 640,
657 (1981) (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in
part); Schaumburg, supra, at 636-638. In addition, the Federal Government has adopted regulations which acknowledge
and respond to the serious problems associated with solicitation. The National Park Service has enacted a flat ban on
the direct solicitation of money in the parks of the Nation's
capital within its control. 36 CFR $ 7.96(h) (1991); see also
United States v. Kokinda, 497 U. S., at 739 (Kennedy, J.,
concurring in judgment). Also, the Federal Aviation Administration, in its administration of the airports of Washington, D. C., even while permitting the solicitation of funds
has adopted special rules to prevent coercive, harassing, or
repetitious behavior. 14 CFR $ 159.94(e)-(h) (1992). And

706 INTERNATIONAL SOC. FOR KRISHNA

CONSCIOUSNESS, INC. v. LEE

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgments

in the commercial sphere, the Federal Trade Commission has
long held that "it constitutes an unfair and deceptive act or
practice" to make a door-to-door sale without allowing the
buyer a 3-day "cooling-off period" during which time he or
she may cancel the sale. 16 CFR $ 429.1 (1992). All of
these measures are based on a recognition that requests for
immediate payment of money create a strong potential for
fraud or undue pressure, in part because of the lack of time
for reflection. As the Court recounts, questionable practices associated with solicitation can include the targeting of
vulnerable and easily coerced persons, misrepresentation of
the solicitor's cause, and outright theft. Ante, at 684; see
also International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v.
Barber, 506 F. Supp. 147, 159-163 (NDNY 1980), rev'd on
other grounds, 650 F. 2d 430 (CA2 1981).

Because the Port Authority's solicitation ban is directed at
these abusive practices and not at any particular message,
idea, or form of speech, the regulation is a content-neutral
rule serving a significant government interest. We have
held that the content neutrality of a rule must be assessed
based on whether it is " `justified without reference to the
content of the regulated speech.' " Ward, 491 U. S., at 791
(quoting Clark, 468 U. S., at 293) (emphasis in original). It
is apparent that the justification for the solicitation ban is
unrelated to the content of speech or the identity of the
speaker. There can also be no doubt that the prevention of
fraud and duress is a significant government interest. The
government cannot, of course, prohibit speech for the sole
reason that it is concerned the speech may be fraudulent.
Schaumburg, 444 U. S., at 637. But the Port Authority's
regulation does not do this. It recognizes that the risk of
fraud and duress is intensified by particular conduct, the
immediate exchange of money; and it addresses only that
conduct. We have recognized that such narrowly drawn
regulations are in fact the proper means for addressing

505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 PAGES OPINPGT

707Cite as: 505 U. S. 672 (1992)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgments
the dangers which can be associated with speech. Ibid.;
Riley, supra, at 799, n. 11.

To survive scrutiny, the regulation must be drawn in nar-row terms to accomplish its end and leave open ample alternative channels for communication. Regarding the former
requirement, we have held that to be narrowly tailored aregulation need not be the least restrictive or least intrusive

means of achieving an end. The regulation must be reason-able, and must not burden substantially more speech than
necessary. Ward, supra, at 798-800. Under this standardthe solicitation ban survives with ease, because it prohibits
only solicitation of money for immediate receipt. The regulation does not burden any broader category of speech or
expressive conduct than is the source of the evil sought to
be avoided. And in fact, the regulation is even more narrow
because it only prohibits such behavior if conducted in a continuous or repetitive manner. The Port Authority has made
a reasonable judgment that this type of conduct raises the
most serious concerns, and it is entitled to deference. My
conclusion is not altered by the fact that other means, for
example, the regulations adopted by the Federal Aviation
Administration to govern its airports, may be available to
address the problems associated with solicitation, because
the existence of less intrusive means is not decisive. Our
cases do not so limit the government's regulatory flexibility.
See Ward, supra, at 800.

I have little difficulty in deciding that the Port Authority
has left open ample alternative channels for the communication of the message which is an aspect of solicitation. As
already discussed, see supra, at 704, the Authority's rule
does not prohibit all solicitation of funds: It restricts only
the manner of the solicitation, or the conduct associated with
solicitation, to prohibit immediate receipt of the solicited
money. Requests for money continue to be permitted, and
in the course of requesting money solicitors may explain
their cause, or the purposes of their organization, without

violating the regulation. It is only if the solicitor acceptsimmediate payment that a violation occurs. Thus the solicitor can continue to disseminate his message, for example, bydistributing preaddressed envelopes in which potential contributors may mail their donations. See supra, at 704.

Much of what I have said about the solicitation of fundsmay seem to apply to the sale of literature, but the differences between the two activities are of sufficient significanceto require they be distinguished for constitutional purposes.
The Port Authority's flat ban on the distribution or sale ofprinted material must, in my view, fall in its entirety. See
supra, at 703. The application of our time, place, and manner test to the ban on sales leads to a result quite different
from the solicitation ban. For one, the government interest
in regulating the sales of literature is not as powerful as in
the case of solicitation. The danger of a fraud arising from
such sales is much more limited than from pure solicitation,
because in the case of a sale the nature of the exchange tends
to be clearer to both parties. Also, the Port Authority's sale
regulation is not as narrowly drawn as the solicitation rule,
since it does not specify the receipt of money as a critical
element of a violation. And perhaps most important, the
flat ban on sales of literature leaves open fewer alternative
channels of communication than the Port Authority's more
limited prohibition on the solicitation and receipt of funds.
Given the practicalities and ad hoc nature of much expressive
activity in the public forum, sales of literature must be completed in one transaction to be workable. Attempting to collect money at another time or place is a far less plausible
option in the context of a sale than when soliciting donations,
because the literature sought to be sold will under normal
circumstances be distributed within the forum. These distinctions have been recognized by the National Park Service,
which permits the sale or distribution of literature, while
prohibiting solicitation. Supra, at 705; 36 CFR $ 7.96( j)(2)
(1991). Thus the Port Authority's regulation allows no prac505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 PAGES OPINPGT

709Cite as: 505 U. S. 672 (1992)
Opinion of Souter, J.
tical means for advocates and organizations to sell literaturewithin the public forums which are its airports.

Against all of this must be balanced the great need, recog-nized by our precedents, to give the sale of literature full
First Amendment protection. We have long recognized thatto prohibit distribution of literature for the mere reason that
it is sold would leave organizations seeking to spread theirmessage without funds to operate. "It should be remembered that the pamphlets of Thomas Paine were not distrib-uted free of charge."

Murdock, 319 U. S., at 111; see alsoSchaumburg, supra, at 628-635 (discussing cases). The

effect of a rule of law distinguishing between sales and dis-tribution would be to close the marketplace of ideas to less
affluent organizations and speakers, leaving speech as thepreserve of those who are able to fund themselves. One of
the primary purposes of the public forum is to provide per-sons who lack access to more sophisticated media the opportunity to speak. A prohibition on sales forecloses that op-portunity for the very persons who need it most. And while
the same arguments might be made regarding solicitation offunds, the answer is that the Port Authority has not prohibited all solicitation, but only a narrow class of conduct associ-ated with a particular manner of solicitation.

For these reasons I agree that the Court of Appeals shouldbe affirmed in full in finding the Port Authority's ban on the
distribution or sale of literature unconstitutional, but uphold-ing the prohibition on solicitation and immediate receipt of
funds.

Kennedy's view of the rule that should determine what isa public forum and with his conclusion that the public areas

of the airports at issue here qualify as such. The designa-tion of a given piece of public property as a traditional public
forum must not merely state a conclusion that the property
falls within a static category including streets, parks, side-walks, and perhaps not much more, but must represent a

conclusion that the property is no different in principle fromsuch examples, which we have previously described as "archetypes" of property from which the government was andis powerless to exclude speech. See

Frisby v. Schultz, 487
U. S. 474, 480 (1988). To treat the class of such forums as
closed by their description as "traditional," taking that word
merely as a charter for examining the history of the particular public property claimed as a forum, has no warrant in a
Constitution whose values are not to be left behind in the
city streets that are no longer the only focus of our community life. If that were the line of our direction, we might as
well abandon the public forum doctrine altogether.

Nor is that a Scylla without Charybdis. Public forum
analysis is stultified not only by treating its archetypes as
closed categories, but by treating its candidates so categorically as to defeat their identification with the archetypes.
We need not say that all "transportation nodes" or all airports are public forums in order to find that certain metropolitan airports are. Thus, the enquiry may and must relate
to the particular property at issue and not necessarily to
the "precise classification of the property." See ante, at 697
(Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment). It is true that property of some types will invariably be public forums. "No
particularized inquiry into the precise nature of a specific
street is necessary; all public streets are held in the public
trust and are properly considered traditional public fora."
Frisby, supra, at 481. But to find one example of a certain
property type (e. g., airports, post offices, etc.) that is not
a public forum is not to rule out all properties of that sort.

Cf. United States v. Kokinda, 497 U. S. 720, 727 (1990) (plural-ity opinion) (implicitly rejecting the categorical approach by

examining whether "[t]he postal sidewalk at issue . . . [has]the characteristics of public sidewalks traditionally open to
expressive activity"). One can imagine a public airport of asize or design or need for extraordinary security that would
render expressive activity incompatible with its normal use.But that would be no reason to conclude that one of the more
usual variety of metropolitan airports is not a public forum.I also agree with

Justice Kennedy's statement of thepublic forum principle: We should classify as a public forum

any piece of public property that is "suitable for discourse"in its physical character, where expressive activity is "compatible" with the use to which it has actually been put. See
ante, at 698 (opinion concurring in judgment); see alsoGrayned v. Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 116 (1972) ("The crucial

question is whether the manner of expression is basicallyincompatible with the normal activity of a particular place
at a particular time"); ante, at 692 (O'Connor, J., concurringin No. 91-155 and concurring in judgment in No. 91-339)
(finding that the ban on the sale or distribution of leafletshere must be struck down "[b]ecause I cannot see how peaceful pamphleteering is incompatible with the multipurpose en-vironment of the Port Authority airports," and concluding
that regulations of leafletting may thus only be upheld if theypass scrutiny under our test for restrictions on time, place,
or manner of speech). Applying this test, I have no diffi-culty concluding that the unleased public areas at airports
like the metropolitan New York airports at issue in thesecases are public forums.

From the Court's conclusion in No. 91-155, however, sus-taining the total ban on solicitation of money for immediate

payment, I respectfully dissent. "We have held the solicita-tion of money by charities to be fully protected as the dissemination of ideas. See [Riley v. National Federation of

although fraudulent misrepresentation of facts can be regu-lated, the dissemination of ideas cannot be regulated to prevent it from being unfair or unreasonable." Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 803(1988) (

Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg-ment) (some citations omitted).

Even if I assume, arguendo, that the ban on the petition-ers' activity at issue here is both content neutral and merely
a restriction on the manner of communication, the regulationmust be struck down for its failure to satisfy the requirements of narrow tailoring to further a significant state in-terest, see, e. g., Clark v. Community for Creative NonViolence, 468 U. S. 288, 293 (1984), and availability of "amplealternative channels for communication," Virginia State Bd.
of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc.,425 U. S. 748, 771 (1976).

As Justice Kennedy's opinion indicates, respondentcomes closest to justifying the restriction as one furthering
the government's interest in preventing coercion and fraud.*

*Respondent also attempts to justify his regulation on the alternative
basis of "interference with air travelers," referring in particular to problems of "annoyance" and "congestion." Brief for Respondent 24-25, 42-
44, 47. The First Amendment inevitably requires people to put up with
annoyance and uninvited persuasion. Indeed, in such cases we need to
scrutinize restrictions on speech with special care. In their degree of
congestion, most of the public spaces of these airports are probably more
comparable to public streets than to the fairground as we described it in
Heffron v. International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U. S.
640, 651 (1981). Consequently, the congestion argument, which was held
there to justify a regulation confining solicitation to a fixed location, should
have less force here. See id., at 650-651. Be that as it may, the conclusion of a majority of the Court today that the Constitution forbids the ban
on the sale, as well as the distribution, of leaflets puts to rest respondent's
argument that congestion justifies a total ban on solicitation. While there

Opinion of Souter, J.
The claim to be preventing coercion is weak to start with.While a solicitor can be insistent, a pedestrian on the street

or airport concourse can simply walk away or walk on. Inany event, we have held in a far more coercive context than
this one, that of a black boycott of white stores in ClaiborneCounty, Mississippi, that "[s]peech does not lose its protected
character . . . simply because it may embarrass others orcoerce them into action."

NAACP v. Claiborne HardwareCo., 458 U. S. 886, 910 (1982). See also Organization for a

Better Austin v. Keefe, 402 U. S. 415, 419 (1971) ("The claimthat . . . expressions were intended to exercise a coercive
impact on respondent does not remove them from the reachof the First Amendment. Petitioners plainly intended to influence respondent's conduct by their activities; this is notfundamentally different from the function of a newspaper").
Since there is here no evidence of any type of coercive con-duct, over and above the merely importunate character of
the open and public solicitation, that might justify a ban, see
United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367 (1968); Claiborne
Hardware Co., supra, at 912, the regulation cannot be sus-tained to avoid coercion.

As for fraud, our cases do not provide government withplenary authority to ban solicitation just because it could be
fraudulent. "Broad prophylactic rules in the area of free ex-pression are suspect," NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 438
(1963), and more than a laudable intent to prevent fraud isrequired to sustain the present ban. See,

e. g., Schaumburgv. Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U. S. 620, 636-638

(1980) ("The Village, consistently with the First Amendment,may not label such groups `fraudulent' and bar them from
canvassing on the streets and house to house"); Riley, supra,at 800. The evidence of fraudulent conduct here is virtually
nonexistent. It consists of one affidavit describing eight
may, of course, be congested locations where solicitation could severely
compromise the efficient flow of pedestrians, the proper response would
be to tailor the restrictions to those choke points.

complaints, none of them substantiated, "involving someform of fraud, deception, or larceny" over an entire 11-year

period between 1975 and 1986, during which the regulationat issue here was, by agreement, not enforced. See Brief
for Respondent 44; Brief for Petitioners 46. Petitionersclaim, and respondent does not dispute, that by the Port Authority's own calculation, there has not been a single claimof fraud or misrepresentation since 1981.

Ibid. As againstthese facts, respondent's brief is ominous in adding that

"[t]he Port Authority is also aware that members of [Interna-tional Society for Krishna Consciousness] have engaged in
misconduct elsewhere." Brief for Respondent 44. This isprecisely the type of vague and unsubstantiated allegation
that could never support a restriction on speech. Finally,the fact that other governmental bodies have also enacted
restrictions on solicitation in other places, see, e. g., 36 CFR$ 7.96(h) (1991), is not evidence of fraudulent conduct.

Even assuming a governmental interest adequate to jus-tify some regulation, the present ban would fall when subjected to the requirement of narrow tailoring. See Riley,supra, at 800; Schaumburg, supra, at 637 ("The Village may
serve its legitimate interests, but it must do so by narrowlydrawn regulations designed to serve those interests without
unnecessarily interfering with First Amendment freedoms")."Precision of regulation must be the touchstone . . . ." Button, supra, at 438. Thus, in Schaumburg we said:

"The Village's legitimate interest in preventing fraudcan be better served by measures less intrusive than a

direct prohibition on solicitation. Fraudulent misrepre-sentations can be prohibited and the penal laws used to
punish such conduct directly. Efforts to promote disclo-sure of the finances of charitable organizations also may
assist in preventing fraud by informing the public of theways in which their contributions will be employed.
Such measures may help make contribution decisionsmore informed, while leaving to individual choice the

decision whether to contribute . . . ." 444 U. S., at 637-638 (citations and footnotes omitted).

Similarly, in Riley we required the State to cure its per-ceived fraud problem by more narrowly tailored means than
compelling disclosure by professional fundraisers of theamount of collected funds that were actually turned over to
charity during the previous year:

"In contrast to the prophylactic, imprecise, and undulyburdensome rule the State has adopted to reduce its alleged donor misperception, more benign and narrowlytailored options are available. For example, as a general rule, the State may itself publish the detailed fi-nancial disclosure forms it requires professional fundraisers to file. This procedure would communicate thedesired information to the public without burdening a
speaker with unwanted speech during the course of asolicitation. Alternatively, the State may vigorously
enforce its antifraud laws to prohibit professional fund-raisers from obtaining money on false pretenses or by
making false statements." 487 U. S., at 800.
Finally, I do not think the Port Authority's solicitation banleaves open the "ample" channels of communication required

of a valid content-neutral time, place, and manner restriction.A distribution of preaddressed envelopes is unlikely to be
much of an alternative. The practical reality of the regula-tion, which this Court can never ignore, is that it shuts off a
uniquely powerful avenue of communication for organiza-tions like the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, and may, in effect, completely prohibit unpopular andpoorly funded groups from receiving funds in response to
protected solicitation. Cf. Linmark Associates, Inc. v. Willingboro, 431 U. S. 85, 93 (1977) ("Although in theory sellersremain free to employ a number of different alternatives, in

practice realty is not marketed through leaflets, soundtrucks, demonstrations, or the like").

UNITED STATES v. FORDICE, GOVERNOR OFMISSISSIPPI,

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 90-1205. Argued November 13, 1991--Decided June 26, 1992*
Despite this Court's decisions in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S.

483 (Brown I), and Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294 (Brown
II), Mississippi continued its policy of de jure segregation in its public
university system, maintaining five almost completely white and three
almost exclusively black universities. Private petitioners initiated this
lawsuit in 1975, and the United States intervened, charging that state
officials had failed to satisfy their obligation under, inter alia, the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 to dismantle the dual system. In an attempt
to reach a consensual resolution through voluntary dismantlement, the
State Board of Trustees, in 1981, issued "Mission Statements" classifying the three flagship white institutions during the de jure period as
"comprehensive" universities having the most varied programs and offering doctoral degrees, redesignating one of the black colleges as an
"urban" university with limited research and degree functions geared
toward its urban setting, and characterizing the rest of the colleges as
"regional" institutions which functioned primarily in an undergraduate
role. When, by the mid-1980's, the student bodies at the white universities were still predominantly white, and the racial composition at the
black institutions remained largely black, the suit proceeded to trial.
After voluminous evidence was presented on a full range of educational
issues, the District Court entered extensive findings of fact on, among
other things, admissions requirements, institutional classification and
missions assignments, duplication of programs, and funding. Its conclusions of law included rulings that, based on its interpretation of Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U. S. 385, and other cases, the affirmative duty to
desegregate in the higher education context does not contemplate either
restricting student choice or the achievement of any degree of racial
balance; that current state policies and practices should be examined to
ensure that they are racially neutral, developed and implemented in
good faith, and do not substantially contribute to the racial identifiability

Syllabus
of individual institutions; and that Mississippi's current actions demonstrate conclusively that the State is fulfilling its affirmative duty to
disestablish the former de jure segregated system. In affirming, the
Court of Appeals left largely undisturbed the lower court's findings
and conclusions.

Held:

1. The courts below did not apply the correct legal standard in ruling
that Mississippi has brought itself into compliance with the Equal Protection Clause. If the State perpetuates policies and practices traceable to its prior de jure dual system that continue to have segregative
effects--whether by influencing student enrollment decisions or by
fostering segregation in other facets of the university system--and
such policies are without sound educational justification and can be practicably eliminated, the policies violate the Clause, even though the
State has abolished the legal requirement that the races be educated
separately and has established racially neutral policies not animated by
a discriminatory purpose. Bazemore v. Friday, supra, distinguished.
The proper inquiry asks whether existing racial identifiability is attributable to the State, see, e. g., Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U. S. 467, and examines a wide range of factors to determine whether the State has perpetuated its former segregation in any facet of its system, see, e. g., Board
of Ed. of Oklahoma City Public Schools v. Dowell, 498 U. S. 237, 250.
Because the District Court's standard did not ask the appropriate questions, the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the lower court's judgment. Pp. 727-732.

2. When the correct legal standard is applied, it becomes apparent
from the District Court's undisturbed factual findings that there are
several surviving aspects of Mississippi's prior dual system which are
constitutionally suspect; for even though such policies may be race
neutral on their face, they substantially restrict a person's choice of
which institution to enter and they contribute to the racial identifiability
of the eight public universities. Mississippi must justify these policies,
as well as any others that are susceptible to challenge by petitioners on
remand under the proper standard, or eliminate them. Pp. 732-743.

(a) Although the State's current admissions policy requiring higher
minimum composite scores on the American College Testing Program
(ACT) for the five historically white institutions than for the three historically black universities derived from policies enacted in the 1970's to
redress the problem of student unpreparedness, the policy is constitutionally suspect because it was originally enacted in 1963 by three of
the white universities to discriminate against black students, who, at
the time, had an average ACT score well below the required minimum.

719Cite as: 505 U. S. 717 (1992)
Syllabus
The policy also has present discriminatory effects, since a much higher
percentage of white than of black high school seniors recently scored
at or above the minimum necessary to enter a white university. The
segregative effect of this standard is especially striking in light of the
differences in minimum required entrance scores among the white and
black regional universities and colleges with dissimilar programmatic
missions, and yet the courts below made little effort to justify those
disparities in educational terms or to inquire whether it was practicable
to eliminate them. The State's refusal to consider high school grade
performance along with ACT scores is also constitutionally problematic,
since the ACT's administering organization discourages use of ACT
scores alone, the disparity between black and white students' high
school grade averages is much narrower than the gap between their
average ACT scores, most States use high school grades and other indicators along with standardized test scores, and Mississippi's approach
was not adequately justified or shown to be unsusceptible to elimination
without eroding sound educational policy. Pp. 733-738.

(b) The District Court's treatment of the widespread duplication
of programs at the historically black and historically white Mississippi
universities is problematic for several reasons. First, it can hardly be
denied that such duplication represents a continuation of the "separate
but equal" treatment required by the prior dual system, and yet the
court's holding that petitioners could not establish a constitutional defect shifted the burden of proof away from the State in violation of
Brown II, supra, at 300, and its progeny. Second, implicit in the court's
finding of "unnecessary" duplication is the absence of any educational
justification and the fact that some, if not all, duplication may be practically eliminated. Finally, by treating this issue in isolation, the court
failed to consider the combined effects of unnecessary duplication with
other policies in evaluating whether the State had met its constitutional
duty. Pp. 738-739.

(c) Mississippi's 1981 mission assignments scheme has as its antecedents the policies enacted to perpetuate racial separation during the
de jure period. When combined with the differential admission practices and unnecessary program duplication, it is likely that the mission
designations interfere with student choice and tend to perpetuate the
segregated system. On remand, the court should inquire whether it
would be practicable and consistent with sound educational practices to
eliminate any such discriminatory effects. Pp. 739-741.

(d) Also on remand, the court should inquire and determine
whether the State's retention and operation of all eight higher educational institutions in an attempt to bring itself into constitutional compliance actually affects student choice and perpetuates the de jure system,

505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT
720 UNITED STATES v. FORDICE

Syllabus
whether maintenance of each of the universities is educationally justifiable, and whether one or more of them can practicably be closed or
merged with other existing institutions. Though certainly closure of
one or more institutions would decrease the system's discriminatory effects, the present record is inadequate to demonstrate whether such
action is constitutionally required. Pp. 741-742.

(e) In addition to the foregoing policies and practices, the full range
of the State's higher educational activities, including its funding of the
three historically black schools, must be examined on remand under the
proper standard to determine whether the State is taking the necessary
steps to dismantle its prior system. Pp. 742-743.

Opinion of the Court
Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court.
In 1954, this Court held that the concept of " `separate butequal' " has no place in the field of public education.

Brownv. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, 495 (Brown I). The

following year, the Court ordered an end to segregated pub-lic education "with all deliberate speed." Brown v. Board
of Education, 349 U. S. 294, 301 (1955) (Brown II). Sincethese decisions, the Court has had many occasions to evaluate whether a public school district has met its affirmativeobligation to dismantle its prior

de jure segregated systemin elementary and secondary schools. In these cases we decide what standards to apply in determining whether theState of Mississippi has met this obligation in the university context. I

Mississippi launched its public university system in 1848by establishing the University of Mississippi, an institution
dedicated to the higher education exclusively of white per-sons. In succeeding decades, the State erected additional
postsecondary, single-race educational facilities. AlcornState University opened its doors in 1871 as "an agricultural
college for the education of Mississippi's black youth."
Ayers v. Allain, 674 F. Supp. 1523, 1527 (ND Miss. 1987).Creation of four more exclusively white institutions followed:

Mississippi State University (1880), Mississippi Universityfor Women (1885), University of Southern Mississippi (1912),
and Delta State University (1925). The State added twomore solely black institutions in 1940 and 1950: in the former
year, Jackson State University, which was charged withtraining "black teachers for the black public schools,"

sity, whose functions were to educate teachers primarily forrural and elementary schools and to provide vocational instruction to black students.Despite this Court's decisions in Brown I and Brown II,
Mississippi's policy of de jure segregation continued. Thefirst black student was not admitted to the University of Mississippi until 1962, and then only by court order. See Meredith v. Fair, 306 F. 2d 374 (CA5), cert. denied, 371 U. S. 828,enf 'd, 313 F. 2d 532 (1962) (en banc) (per curiam). For the

next 12 years the segregated public university system in theState remained largely intact. Mississippi State University,
Mississippi University for Women, University of SouthernMississippi, and Delta State University each admitted at
least one black student during these years, but the studentcomposition of these institutions was still almost completely
white. During this period, Jackson State and MississippiValley State were exclusively black; Alcorn State had admitted five white students by 1968.In 1969, the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) initiated efforts to enforce Title VIof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d.

1 HEW

requested that the State devise a plan to disestablish the for-merly

de jure segregated university system. In June 1973,the Board of Trustees of State Institutions of Higher Learning (Board) submitted a plan of compliance, which expressedthe aims of improving educational opportunities for all Mississippi citizens by setting numerical goals on the enrollmentof other-race students at state universities, hiring other-race
faculty members, and instituting remedial programs and spe-cial recruitment efforts to achieve those goals. App. 898-
900. HEW rejected this Plan as failing to comply with TitleVI because it did not go far enough in the areas of student

recruitment and enrollment, faculty hiring, elimination ofunnecessary program duplication, and institutional funding

practices to ensure that "a student's choice of institution orcampus, henceforth, will be based on other than racial criteria." Id., at 205. The Board reluctantly offered amend-ments, prefacing its reform pledge to HEW with this statement: "With deference, it is the position of the Board ofTrustees . . . that the Mississippi system of higher education
is in compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of1964."

Id., at 898. At this time, the racial composition ofthe State's universities had changed only marginally from

the levels of 1968, which were almost exclusively single race.2Though HEW refused to accept the modified Plan, the Board
adopted it anyway. 674 F. Supp., at 1530. But even thelimited effects of this Plan in disestablishing the prior de
jure segregated system were substantially constricted by the
state legislature, which refused to fund it until fiscal year1978, and even then at well under half the amount sought by

the Board. App. 896-897, 1444-1445, 1448-1449.3Private petitioners initiated this lawsuit in 1975. They
complained that Mississippi had maintained the racially seg-regative effects of its prior dual system of postsecondary education in violation of the Fifth, Ninth, Thirteenth, andFourteenth Amendments, 42 U. S. C. $$ 1981 and 1983, and
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d.

2 For the 1974-1975 school year, black students comprised 4.1 percent of
the full-time undergraduate enrollments at University of Mississippi; at
Mississippi State University, 7.5 percent; at University of Southern Mississippi, 8.0 percent; at Delta State University, 12.6 percent; at Mississippi
University for Women, 13.0 percent. At Jackson State, Alcorn State, and
Mississippi Valley State, the percentages of black students were 96.6
percent, 99.9 percent, and 100 percent, respectively. Brief for United
States 7.

3 According to counsel for respondents, it was in this time period--the

mid- to late-1970's--that the State came into full "compliance with the
law" as having taken the necessary affirmative steps to dismantle its prior
de jure system. Tr. of Oral Arg. 45.

Shortly thereafter, the United States filed its complaint inintervention, charging that state officials had failed to satisfy

their obligation under the Equal Protection Clause of theFourteenth Amendment and Title VI to dismantle Mississippi's dual system of higher education.

After this lawsuit was filed, the parties attempted for 12years to achieve a consensual resolution of their differences

through voluntary dismantlement by the State of its priorseparated system. The board of trustees implemented reviews of existing curricula and program "mission" at eachinstitution. In 1981, the Board issued "Mission Statements"
that identified the extant purpose of each public university.
These "missions" were clustered into three categories: comprehensive, urban, and regional. "Comprehensive" universities were classified as those with the greatest existing resources and program offerings. All three such institutions
(University of Mississippi, Mississippi State, and Southern
Mississippi) were exclusively white under the prior de jure
segregated system. The Board authorized each to continue
offering doctoral degrees and to assert leadership in certain
disciplines. Jackson State, the sole urban university, was
assigned a more limited research and degree mission, with
both functions geared toward its urban setting. It was exclusively black at its inception. The "regional" designation
was something of a misnomer, as the Board envisioned those
institutions primarily in an undergraduate role, rather than
a "regional" one in the geographical sense of serving just the
localities in which they were based. Only the universities
classified as "regional" included institutions that, prior to
desegregation, had been either exclusively white--Delta
State and Mississippi University for Women--or exclusively
black--Alcorn State and Mississippi Valley State.

By the mid-1980's, 30 years after Brown, more than 99
percent of Mississippi's white students were enrolled at University of Mississippi, Mississippi State, Southern Mississippi, Delta State, and Mississippi University for Women.

Opinion of the Court
The student bodies at these universities remained predomi-nantly white, averaging between 80 and 91 percent white

students. Seventy-one percent of the State's black studentsattended Jackson State, Alcorn State, and Mississippi Valley
State, where the racial composition ranged from 92 to 99 per-cent black.

II
By 1987, the parties concluded that they could not agreeon whether the State had taken the requisite affirmative

steps to dismantle its prior de jure segregated system.They proceeded to trial. Both sides presented voluminous
evidence on a full range of educational issues spanningadmissions standards, faculty and administrative staff recruitment, program duplication, on-campus discrimination,institutional funding disparities, and satellite campuses.
Petitioners argued that in various ways the State continuedto reinforce historic, race-based distinctions among the universities. Respondents argued generally that the State hadfulfilled its duty to disestablish its state-imposed segregative
system by implementing and maintaining good-faith, non-discriminatory race-neutral policies and practices in student
admission, faculty hiring, and operations. Moreover, theysuggested, the State had attracted significant numbers of
qualified black students to those universities composedmostly of white persons. Respondents averred that the
mere continued existence of racially identifiable universitieswas not unlawful given the freedom of students to choose
which institution to attend and the varying objectives andfeatures of the State's universities.

At trial's end, based on the testimony of 71 witnesses and56,700 pages of exhibits, the District Court entered extensive findings of fact. The court first offered a historicaloverview of the higher education institutions in Mississippi
and the developments in the system between 1954 and thefiling of this suit in 1975. 674 F. Supp., at 1526-1530. It

Opinion of the Court
then made specific findings recounting post-1975 develop-ments, including a description at the time of trial, in those

areas of the higher education system under attack by plain-tiffs: admission requirements and recruitment; institutional
classification and assignment of missions; duplication of programs; facilities and finance; the land grant institutions; fac-ulty and staff; and governance.

Id., at 1530-1550.
The court's conclusions of law followed. As an overview,the court outlined the common ground in the action: "Where

a state has previously maintained a racially dual system ofpublic education established by law, it assumes an `affirmative duty' to reform those policies and practices which required or contributed to the separation of races." Id., at
1551. Noting that courts unanimously hold that the affirmative duty to dismantle a racially dual structure in elementary and secondary schools also governs in the higher education context, the court observed that there was disagreement
whether Green v. School Bd. of New Kent County, 391 U. S.
430 (1968), applied in all of its aspects to formerly dual systems of higher education, i. e., whether "some level of racial
mixture at previously segregated institutions of higher
learning is not only desirable but necessary to `effectively'
desegregate the system." 674 F. Supp., at 1552. Relying
on a Fifth Circuit three-judge court decision, Alabama State
Teachers Assn. (ASTA) v. Alabama Public School and College Authority, 289 F. Supp. 784 (MD Ala. 1968), our per
curiam affirmance of that case, 393 U. S. 400 (1969), and its
understanding of our later decision in Bazemore v. Friday,
478 U. S. 385 (1986), the court concluded that in the higher
education context, "the affirmative duty to desegregate does
not contemplate either restricting choice or the achievement
of any degree of racial balance." 674 F. Supp., at 1553.
Thus, the court stated: "While student enrollment and faculty and staff hiring patterns are to be examined, greater
emphasis should instead be placed on current state higher
education policies and practices in order to insure that such

Opinion of the Court
policies and practices are racially neutral, developed and im-plemented in good faith, and do not substantially contribute

to the continued racial identifiability of individual institu-tions." Id., at 1554.

When it addressed the same aspects of the university sys-tem covered by the findings of fact in light of the foregoing
standard, the court found no violation of federal law in anyof them. "In summary, the court finds that current actions
on the part of the defendants demonstrate conclusively thatthe defendants are fulfilling their affirmative duty to disestablish the former de jure segregated system of higher edu-cation."

Id., at 1564.The Court of Appeals reheard the action en banc and affirmed the decision of the District Court. Ayers v. Allain,914 F. 2d 676 (CA5 1990). With a single exception, see
infra, at 741, it did not disturb the District Court's findingsof fact or conclusions of law. The en banc majority agreed
that "Mississippi was . . . constitutionally required to elimi-nate invidious racial distinctions and dismantle its dual system." Id., at 682. That duty, the court held, had been dis-charged since "the record makes clear that Mississippi has
adopted and implemented race neutral policies for operatingits colleges and universities and that all students have real
freedom of choice to attend the college or university theywish . . . ." Id., at 678.

We granted the respective writs of certiorari filed by theUnited States and the private petitioners. 499 U. S. 958
(1991). III

The District Court, the Court of Appeals, and respondentsrecognize and acknowledge that the State of Mississippi had
the constitutional duty to dismantle the dual school systemthat its laws once mandated. Nor is there any dispute that
this obligation applies to its higher education system. If theState has not discharged this duty, it remains in violation of
the Fourteenth Amendment. Brown v. Board of Education

728 UNITED STATES v. FORDICE

Opinion of the Court
and its progeny clearly mandate this observation. Thus, theprimary issue in these cases is whether the State has met

its affirmative duty to dismantle its prior dual universitysystem.

Our decisions establish that a State does not discharge its
constitutional obligations until it eradicates policies and prac-tices traceable to its prior

de jure dual system that continue
to foster segregation. Thus we have consistently askedwhether existing racial identifiability is attributable to the

State, see, e. g., Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U. S. 467, 496 (1992);
Bazemore v. Friday, supra, at 407 (White, J., concurring);
Pasadena City Bd. of Ed. v. Spangler, 427 U. S. 424, 434
(1976); Gilmore v. City of Montgomery, 417 U. S. 556, 566-
567 (1974); and examined a wide range of factors to determine whether the State has perpetuated its formerly de jure
segregation in any facet of its institutional system. See,
e. g., Board of Ed. of Oklahoma City Public Schools v.
Dowell, 498 U. S. 237, 250 (1991); Swann v. CharlotteMecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S. 1, 18 (1971); Green v.
School Bd. of New Kent County, supra, at 435-438.

The Court of Appeals concluded that the State had fulfilled
its affirmative obligation to disestablish its prior de jure segregated system by adopting and implementing race-neutral
policies governing its college and university system. Because students seeking higher education had "real freedom"
to choose the institution of their choice, the State need do no
more. Even though neutral policies and free choice were
not enough to dismantle a dual system of primary or secondary schools, Green v. School Bd. of New Kent County, 391
U. S. 430 (1968), the Court of Appeals thought that universities "differ in character fundamentally" from lower levels of
schools, 914 F. 2d, at 686, sufficiently so that our decision in
Bazemore v. Friday, supra, justified the conclusion that the
State had dismantled its former dual system.

Like the United States, we do not disagree with the Court
of Appeals' observation that a state university system is

505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT

729Cite as: 505 U. S. 717 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
quite different in very relevant respects from primary andsecondary schools. Unlike attendance at the lower level

schools, a student's decision to seek higher education hasbeen a matter of choice. The State historically has not assigned university students to a particular institution. Moreover, like public universities throughout the country, Missis-sippi's institutions of higher learning are not fungible--they

have been designated to perform certain missions. Stu-dents who qualify for admission enjoy a range of choices of
which institution to attend. Thus, as the Court of Appealsstated, "[i]t hardly needs mention that remedies common to
public school desegregation, such as pupil assignments, busing, attendance quotas, and zoning, are unavailable when
persons may freely choose whether to pursue an advanced
education and, when the choice is made, which of several
universities to attend." 914 F. 2d, at 687.

We do not agree with the Court of Appeals or the District
Court, however, that the adoption and implementation of
race-neutral policies alone suffice to demonstrate that the
State has completely abandoned its prior dual system. That
college attendance is by choice and not by assignment does
not mean that a race-neutral admissions policy cures the constitutional violation of a dual system. In a system based
on choice, student attendance is determined not simply by
admissions policies, but also by many other factors. Although some of these factors clearly cannot be attributed to
state policies, many can be. Thus, even after a State dismantles its segregative admissions policy, there may still
be state action that is traceable to the State's prior de jure
segregation and that continues to foster segregation. The
Equal Protection Clause is offended by "sophisticated as well
as simple-minded modes of discrimination." Lane v. Wilson, 307 U. S. 268, 275 (1939). If policies traceable to the de
jure system are still in force and have discriminatory effects,
those policies too must be reformed to the extent practicable
and consistent with sound educational practices. Freeman,

Opinion of the Court

Florida ex rel. Hawkins v. Board of Control of Fla., 350
U. S. 413, 414 (1956) (per curiam).4 We also disagree with
respondents that the Court of Appeals and District Court
properly relied on our decision in Bazemore v. Friday, 478
U. S. 385 (1986). Bazemore neither requires nor justifies the
conclusions reached by the two courts below.5

4 To the extent we understand private petitioners to urge us to focus on
present discriminatory effects without addressing whether such consequences flow from policies rooted in the prior system, we reject this position. Private petitioners contend that the State must not only cease its
legally authorized discrimination, it must also "eliminate its continuing
effects insofar as practicable." Brief for Petitioners in No. 90-6588, p. 44.
Though they seem to disavow as radical a remedy as student reassignment
in the university setting, id., at 66, their focus on "student enrollment,
faculty and staff employment patterns, [and] black citizens' college-going
and degree-granting rates," id., at 63, would seemingly compel remedies
akin to those upheld in Green v. School Bd. of New Kent County, 391 U. S.
430 (1968), were we to adopt their legal standard. As will become clear,
however, the inappropriateness of remedies adopted in Green by no means
suggests that the racial identifiability of the institutions in a university
system is irrelevant to deciding whether a State such as Mississippi has
satisfactorily dismantled its prior de jure dual system or that the State
need not take additional steps to ameliorate such identifiability.

5 Similarly, reliance on our per curiam affirmance in Alabama State

Teachers Assn. v. Alabama Public School and College Authority, 289
F. Supp. 784 (MD Ala. 1968) (ASTA), aff'd, 393 U. S. 400 (1969) (per curiam), is misplaced. In ASTA, the state teachers association sought to
enjoin construction of an extension campus of Auburn University in Montgomery, Alabama. The three-judge District Court rejected the allegation
that such a facility would perpetuate the State's dual system. It found
that the State had educationally justifiable reasons for this new campus
and that it had acted in good faith in the fields of admissions, faculty, and
staff. 289 F. Supp., at 789. The court also noted that it was "reasonable
to conclude that a new institution will not be a white school or a Negro
school, but just a school." Ibid. Respondents are incorrect to suppose
that ASTA validates policies traceable to the de jure system regardless of
whether or not they are educationally justifiable or can be practicably
altered to reduce their segregative effects.

Opinion of the Court
Bazemore raised the issue whether the financing and operational assistance provided by a state university's extension
service to voluntary 4-H and Homemaker Clubs was inconsistent with the Equal Protection Clause because of the existence of numerous all-white and all-black clubs. Though
prior to 1965 the clubs were supported on a segregated basis,
the District Court had found that the policy of segregation
had been completely abandoned and that no evidence existed
of any lingering discrimination in either services or membership; any racial imbalance resulted from the wholly voluntary
and unfettered choice of private individuals. Bazemore,
supra, at 407 (White, J., concurring). In this context, we
held inapplicable the Green Court's judgment that a voluntary choice program was insufficient to dismantle a de jure
dual system in public primary and secondary schools, but
only after satisfying ourselves that the State had not fostered segregation by playing a part in the decision of which
club an individual chose to join.

Bazemore plainly does not excuse inquiry into whether
Mississippi has left in place certain aspects of its prior dual
system that perpetuate the racially segregated higher education system. If the State perpetuates policies and practices
traceable to its prior system that continue to have segregative effects--whether by influencing student enrollment
decisions or by fostering segregation in other facets of the
university system--and such policies are without sound educational justification and can be practicably eliminated, the
State has not satisfied its burden of proving that it has dismantled its prior system. Such policies run afoul of the
Equal Protection Clause, even though the State has abolished the legal requirement that whites and blacks be educated separately and has established racially neutral policies

Opinion of the Court
not animated by a discriminatory purpose.6 Because thestandard applied by the District Court did not make these

inquiries, we hold that the Court of Appeals erred in affirm-ing the District Court's ruling that the State had brought
itself into compliance with the Equal Protection Clause inthe operation of its higher education system.

IV
Had the Court of Appeals applied the correct legal stand-ard, it would have been apparent from the undisturbed fac6 Of course, if challenged policies are not rooted in the prior dual system,
the question becomes whether the fact of racial separation establishes a
new violation of the Fourteenth Amendment under traditional principles.
Board of Ed. of Oklahoma City Public Schools v. Dowell, 498 U. S. 237,
250-251 (1991); Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development
Corp., 429 U. S. 252 (1977).

7 The Court of Appeals also misanalyzed the Title VI claim. The court

stated that "we are not prepared to say the defendants have failed to meet
the duties outlined in the regulations." 914 F. 2d 676, 687-688, n. 11 (CA5
1990). The court added that it need not "discuss the scope of Mississippi's
duty under the regulations" because "the duty outlined by the Supreme
Court in Bazemore controls in Title VI cases." Ibid. It will be recalled,
however, that the relevant agency and the courts had specifically found no
violation of the regulation in Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U. S. 385, 409 (1986)
(White, J., concurring). Insofar as it failed to perform the same factual
inquiry and application as the courts in Bazemore had made, therefore,
the Court of Appeals' reliance on Bazemore to avoid conducting a similar
analysis in these cases was inappropriate.

Private petitioners reiterate in this Court their assertion that the state
system also violates Title VI, citing a regulation to that statute which
requires States to "take affirmative action to overcome the effects of prior
discrimination." 34 CFR $ 100.3(b)(6)(i) (1991). Our cases make clear,
and the parties do not disagree, that the reach of Title VI's protection
extends no further than the Fourteenth Amendment. See Regents of
Univ. of California v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 287 (1978) (opinion of Powell,
J.); id., at 328 (opinion of Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ.,
concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); see also Guardians
Assn. v. Civil Service Comm'n of New York City, 463 U. S. 582, 610-611
(1983) (Powell, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 612-613 (O'Connor, J.,
concurring in judgment); id., at 639-643 (Stevens, J., dissenting). We
thus treat the issues in these cases as they are implicated under the
Constitution.

Opinion of the Court
tual findings of the District Court that there are several surviving aspects of Mississippi's prior dual system which are
constitutionally suspect; for even though such policies may
be race neutral on their face, they substantially restrict a
person's choice of which institution to enter, and they contribute to the racial identifiability of the eight public universities. Mississippi must justify these policies or eliminate
them.

It is important to state at the outset that we make no
effort to identify an exclusive list of unconstitutional remnants of Mississippi's prior de jure system. In highlighting,
as we do below, certain remnants of the prior system that
are readily apparent from the findings of fact made by the
District Court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals,8 we
by no means suggest that the Court of Appeals need not examine, in light of the proper standard, each of the other policies now governing the State's university system that have
been challenged or that are challenged on remand in light of
the standard that we articulate today. With this caveat in
mind, we address four policies of the present system: admissions standards, program duplication, institutional mission
assignments, and continued operation of all eight public
universities.

We deal first with the current admissions policies of Mississippi's public universities. As the District Court found,
the three flagship historically white universities in the sys8 In this sense, it is important to reiterate that we do not disturb
the findings of no discriminatory purpose in the many instances in which
the courts below made such conclusions. The private petitioners and the
United States, however, need not show such discriminatory intent to establish a constitutional violation for the perpetuation of policies traceable
to the prior de jure segregative regime which have continuing discriminatory effects. As for present policies that do not have such historical
antecedents, a claim of violation of the Fourteenth Amendment cannot
be made out without a showing of discriminatory purpose. See supra, at
732, n. 6.

Opinion of the Court
tem--University of Mississippi, Mississippi State University,and University of Southern Mississippi--enacted policies in

1963 requiring all entrants to achieve a minimum compositescore of 15 on the test administered by the American College
Testing Program (ACT). 674 F. Supp., at 1531. The court
described the "discriminatory taint" of this policy, id., at1557, an obvious reference to the fact that, at the time, the

average ACT score for white students was 18 and the aver-age score for blacks was 7. 893 F. 2d, at 735. The District
Court concluded, and the en banc Court of Appeals agreed,that present admissions standards derived from policies enacted in the 1970's to redress the problem of student unpreparedness. 914 F. 2d, at 679; 674 F. Supp., at 1531. Obviously, this midpassage justification for perpetuating a policy
enacted originally to discriminate against black students
does not make the present admissions standards any less
constitutionally suspect.

The present admissions standards are not only traceable
to the de jure system and were originally adopted for a discriminatory purpose, but they also have present discriminatory effects. Every Mississippi resident under 21 seeking
admission to the university system must take the ACT test.
Any applicant who scores at least 15 qualifies for automatic
admission to any of the five historically white institutions
except Mississippi University for Women, which requires a
score of 18 for automatic admission unless the student has a
3.0 high school grade average. Those scoring less than 15
but at least 13 automatically qualify to enter Jackson State
University, Alcorn State University, and Mississippi Valley
State University. Without doubt, these requirements restrict the range of choices of entering students as to which
institution they may attend in a way that perpetuates segregation. Those scoring 13 or 14, with some exceptions, are
excluded from the five historically white universities and if
they want a higher education must go to one of the historically black institutions or attend junior college with the hope

Opinion of the Court
of transferring to a historically white institution.9 Proportionately more blacks than whites face this choice: In 1985,
72 percent of Mississippi's white high school seniors achieved
an ACT composite score of 15 or better, while less than 30
percent of black high school seniors earned that score. App.
1524-1525. It is not surprising then that Mississippi's universities remain predominantly identifiable by race.

The segregative effect of this automatic entrance standard
is especially striking in light of the differences in minimum
automatic entrance scores among the regional universities
in Mississippi's system. The minimum score for automatic
admission to Mississippi University for Women is 18; it is 13
for the historically black universities. Yet Mississippi University for Women is assigned the same institutional mission
as two other regional universities, Alcorn State and Mississippi Valley State--that of providing quality undergraduate
education. The effects of the policy fall disproportionately
on black students who might wish to attend Mississippi University for Women; and though the disparate impact is not
as great, the same is true of the minimum standard ACT
score of 15 at Delta State University--the other "regional"
university--as compared to the historically black "regional"
universities where a score of 13 suffices for automatic admission. The courts below made little, if any, effort to justify
in educational terms those particular disparities in entrance
requirements or to inquire whether it was practicable to
eliminate them.

9 The District Court's finding that "[v]ery few black students, if any, are
actually denied admission to a Mississippi university as a first-time freshman for failure to achieve the minimal ACT score," Ayers v. Allain, 674
F. Supp. 1523, 1535 (ND Miss. 1987), ignores the inherent self-selection
that accompanies public announcement of "automatic" admissions standards. It is logical to think that some percentage of black students who
fail to score 15 do not seek admission to one of the historically white
universities because of this automatic admissions standard.

505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT
736 UNITED STATES v. FORDICE

Opinion of the Court
We also find inadequately justified by the courts below orby the record before us the differential admissions requirements between universities with dissimilar programmaticmissions. We do not suggest that absent a discriminatory
purpose different programmatic missions accompanied by
different admissions standards would be constitutionally sus-pect simply because one or more schools are racially identifiable. But here the differential admissions standards areremnants of the dual system with a continuing discriminatory effect, and the mission assignments "to some degreefollow the historical racial assignments," 914 F. 2d, at 692.
Moreover, the District Court did not justify the differing admissions standards based on the different mission assignments. It observed only that in the 1970's, the board of
trustees justified a minimum ACT score of 15 because too
many students with lower scores were not prepared for the
historically white institutions and that imposing the 15 score
requirement on admissions to the historically black institutions would decimate attendance at those universities. The
District Court also stated that the mission of the regional
universities had the more modest function of providing quality undergraduate education. Certainly the comprehensive
universities are also, among other things, educating undergraduates. But we think the 15 ACT test score for automatic admission to the comprehensive universities, as compared with a score of 13 for the regionals, requires further
justification in terms of sound educational policy.

Another constitutionally problematic aspect of the State's
use of the ACT test scores is its policy of denying automatic
admission if an applicant fails to earn the minimum ACT
score specified for the particular institution, without also resorting to the applicant's high school grades as an additional
factor in predicting college performance. The United States
produced evidence that the American College Testing Program (ACTP), the administering organization of the ACT,
discourages use of ACT scores as the sole admissions crite505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
rion on the ground that it gives an incomplete "picture" ofthe student applicant's ability to perform adequately in college. App. 1209-1210. One ACTP report presented intoevidence suggests that "it would be foolish" to substitute a
3- or 4-hour test in place of a student's high school gradesas a means of predicting college performance.

Id., at 193.The record also indicated that the disparity between black

and white students' high school grade averages was muchnarrower than the gap between their average ACT scores,
thereby suggesting that an admissions formula which in-cluded grades would increase the number of black students
eligible for automatic admission to all of Mississippi's publicuniversities.

10

The United States insists that the State's refusal to con-sider information which would better predict college performance than ACT scores alone is irrational in light of mostStates' use of high school grades and other indicators along
with standardized test scores. The District Court observedthat the board of trustees was concerned with grade inflation
and the lack of comparability in grading practices and courseofferings among the State's diverse high schools. Both the
District Court and the Court of Appeals found this concernample justification for the failure to consider high school
grade performance along with ACT scores. In our view,such justification is inadequate because the ACT requirement was originally adopted for discriminatory purposes, the

10 In 1985, 72 percent of white students in Mississippi scored 15 or better
on the ACT test, whereas only 30 percent of black students achieved that
mark, a difference of nearly 21/2 times. By contrast, the disparity among
grade averages was not nearly so wide. 43.8 percent of white high school
students and 30.5 percent of black students averaged at least a 3.0, and
62.2 percent of whites and 49.2 percent of blacks earned at least a 2.5
grade point average. App. 1524-1525. Though it failed to make specific
factfindings on this point, this evidence, which the State does not dispute,
is fairly encompassed within the District Court's statement that "[b]lack
students on the average score somewhat lower [than white students]."

Opinion of the Court
current requirement is traceable to that decision and seem-ingly continues to have segregative effects, and the State

has so far failed to show that the "ACT-only" admissionsstandard is not susceptible to elimination without eroding
sound educational policy.

A second aspect of the present system that necessitatesfurther inquiry is the widespread duplication of programs.

"Unnecessary" duplication refers, under the District Court'sdefinition, "to those instances where two or more institutions
offer the same nonessential or noncore program. Under thisdefinition, all duplication at the bachelor's level of nonbasic
liberal arts and sciences course work and all duplication at
the master's level and above are considered to be unnecessary." 674 F. Supp., at 1540. The District Court found that
34.6 percent of the 29 undergraduate programs at historically
black institutions are "unnecessarily duplicated" by the historically white universities, and that 90 percent of the graduate programs at the historically black institutions are unnecessarily duplicated at the historically white institutions.
Id., at 1541. In its conclusions of law on this point, the District Court nevertheless determined that "there is no proof "
that such duplication "is directly associated with the racial
identifiability of institutions," and that "there is no proof that
the elimination of unnecessary program duplication would be
justifiable from an educational standpoint or that its elimination would have a substantial effect on student choice." Id.,
at 1561.

The District Court's treatment of this issue is problematic
from several different perspectives. First, the court appeared to impose the burden of proof on the plaintiffs to meet
a legal standard the court itself acknowledged was not yet
formulated. It can hardly be denied that such duplication
was part and parcel of the prior dual system of higher education--the whole notion of "separate but equal" required duplicative programs in two sets of schools--and that the present unnecessary duplication is a continuation of that practice.

Opinion of the Court
Brown and its progeny, however, established that the burdenof proof falls on the

State, and not the aggrieved plaintiffs, to
establish that it has dismantled its prior de jure segregatedsystem.

Brown II, 349 U. S., at 300. The court's holding
that petitioners could not establish the constitutional defect
of unnecessary duplication, therefore, improperly shifted theburden away from the State. Second, implicit in the District Court's finding of "unnecessary" duplication is the ab-sence of any educational justification and the fact that some,
if not all, duplication may be practicably eliminated. In-deed, the District Court observed that such duplication "cannot be justified economically or in terms of providing quality
education." 674 F. Supp., at 1541. Yet by stating that
"there is no proof " that elimination of unnecessary duplication would decrease institutional racial identifiability, affect
student choice, and promote educationally sound policies, the
court did not make clear whether it had directed the parties
to develop evidence on these points, and if so, what that evidence revealed. See id., at 1561. Finally, by treating this
issue in isolation, the court failed to consider the combined
effects of unnecessary program duplication with other policies, such as differential admissions standards, in evaluating
whether the State had met its duty to dismantle its prior de
jure segregated system.

We next address Mississippi's scheme of institutional mission classification, and whether it perpetuates the State's formerly de jure dual system. The District Court found that,
throughout the period of de jure segregation, University of
Mississippi, Mississippi State University, and University of
Southern Mississippi were the flagship institutions in the
state system. They received the most funds, initiated the
most advanced and specialized programs, and developed the
widest range of curricular functions. At their inception,
each was restricted for the education solely of white persons.
Id., at 1526-1528. The missions of Mississippi University for
Women and Delta State University, by contrast, were more

740 UNITED STATES v. FORDICE

Opinion of the Court
limited than their other all-white counterparts during theperiod of legalized segregation. Mississippi University for

Women and Delta State University were each established toprovide undergraduate education solely for white students
in the liberal arts and such other fields as music, art, education, and home economics. Id., at 1527-1528. When theywere founded, the three exclusively black universities were

more limited in their assigned academic missions than thefive all-white institutions. Alcorn State, for example, was
designated to serve as "an agricultural college for the educa-tion of Mississippi's black youth."

Id., at 1527. Jackson
State and Mississippi Valley State were established to train
black teachers. Id., at 1528. Though the District Court's
findings do not make this point explicit, it is reasonable to
infer that state funding and curriculum decisions throughout
the period of de jure segregation were based on the purposes
for which these institutions were established.

In 1981, the State assigned certain missions to Mississippi's public universities as they then existed. It classified
University of Mississippi, Mississippi State, and Southern
Mississippi as "comprehensive" universities having the most
varied programs and offering graduate degrees. Two of the
historically white institutions, Delta State University and
Mississippi University for Women, along with two of the historically black institutions, Alcorn State University and Mississippi Valley State University, were designated as "regional" universities with more limited programs and devoted
primarily to undergraduate education. Jackson State University was classified as an "urban" university whose mission
was defined by its urban location.

The institutional mission designations adopted in 1981
have as their antecedents the policies enacted to perpetuate
racial separation during the de jure segregated regime. The
Court of Appeals expressly disagreed with the District
Court by recognizing that the "inequalities among the institutions largely follow the mission designations, and the mis505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT

741Cite as: 505 U. S. 717 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
sion designations to some degree follow the historical racialassignments." 914 F. 2d, at 692. It nevertheless upheld

this facet of the system as constitutionally acceptable basedon the existence of good-faith racially neutral policies and
procedures. That different missions are assigned to the universities surely limits to some extent an entering student'schoice as to which university to seek admittance. While the

courts below both agreed that the classification and missionassignments were made without discriminatory purpose, the
Court of Appeals found that the record "supports the plain-tiffs' argument that the mission designations had the effect
of maintaining the more limited program scope at the historically black universities." Id., at 690. We do not suggest
that absent discriminatory purpose the assignment of different missions to various institutions in a State's higher education system would raise an equal protection issue where one
or more of the institutions become or remain predominantly
black or white. But here the issue is whether the State has
sufficiently dismantled its prior dual system; and when combined with the differential admission practices and unnecessary program duplication, it is likely that the mission designations interfere with student choice and tend to perpetuate
the segregated system. On remand, the court should inquire whether it would be practicable and consistent with
sound educational practices to eliminate any such discriminatory effects of the State's present policy of mission
assignments.

Fourth, the State attempted to bring itself into compliance
with the Constitution by continuing to maintain and operate
all eight higher educational institutions. The existence of
eight instead of some lesser number was undoubtedly occasioned by state laws forbidding the mingling of the races.
And as the District Court recognized, continuing to maintain
all eight universities in Mississippi is wasteful and irrational.
The District Court pointed especially to the facts that Delta
State and Mississippi Valley State are only 35 miles apart

505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT
742 UNITED STATES v. FORDICE

Opinion of the Court
and that only 20 miles separate Mississippi State and Missis-sippi University for Women. 674 F. Supp., at 1563-1564. It

was evident to the District Court that "the defendants un-dertake to fund more institutions of higher learning than are
justified by the amount of financial resources available to the
state," id., at 1564, but the court concluded that such fiscalirresponsibility was a policy choice of the legislature rather

than a feature of a system subject to constitutional scrutiny.Unquestionably, a larger rather than a smaller number of
institutions from which to choose in itself makes for differentchoices, particularly when examined in the light of other
factors present in the operation of the system, such asadmissions, program duplication, and institutional mission
designations. Though certainly closure of one or more
institutions would decrease the discriminatory effects of thepresent system, see,

e. g., United States v. Louisiana, 718 F.
Supp. 499, 514 (ED La. 1989), based on the present record
we are unable to say whether such action is constitutionally
required.11 Elimination of program duplication and revision
of admissions criteria may make institutional closure unnecessary. However, on remand this issue should be carefully
explored by inquiring and determining whether retention of
all eight institutions itself affects student choice and perpetuates the segregated higher education system, whether
maintenance of each of the universities is educationally justifiable, and whether one or more of them can be practicably
closed or merged with other existing institutions.

Because the former de jure segregated system of public
universities in Mississippi impeded the free choice of pro11 It should be noted that in correspondence with the board of trustees
in 1973, an HEW official expressed the "overall objective" of the Plan to
be "that a student's choice of institution or campus, henceforth, will be
based on other than racial criteria." App. 205. The letter added that
closure of a formerly de jure black institution "would create a presumption
that a greater burden is being placed upon the black students and faculty
in Mississippi." Id., at 206.

spective students, the State in dismantling that system musttake the necessary steps to ensure that this choice now is

truly free. The full range of policies and practices must beexamined with this duty in mind. That an institution is predominantly white or black does not in itself make out a constitutional violation. But surely the State may not leave inplace policies rooted in its prior officially segregated system

that serve to maintain the racial identifiability of its universi-ties if those policies can practicably be eliminated without
eroding sound educational policies.If we understand private petitioners to press us to order
the upgrading of Jackson State, Alcorn State, and MississippiValley State

solely so that they may be publicly financed,
exclusively black enclaves by private choice, we reject that
request. The State provides these facilities for all its citizens and it has not met its burden under Brown to take affirmative steps to dismantle its prior de jure system when it
perpetuates a separate, but "more equal" one. Whether
such an increase in funding is necessary to achieve a full
dismantlement under the standards we have outlined, however, is a different question, and one that must be addressed
on remand.

Because the District Court and the Court of Appeals failed
to consider the State's duties in their proper light, the cases
must be remanded. To the extent that the State has not
met its affirmative obligation to dismantle its prior dual system, it shall be adjudged in violation of the Constitution and
Title VI and remedial proceedings shall be conducted. The
decision of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the cases
are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.

It is so ordered.

affirmatively dismantle their prior de jure segregation in
order to create an environment free of racial discrimination
and to make aggrieved individuals whole. See Brown v.
Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294, 299 (1955); Milliken v.
Bradley, 418 U. S. 717, 746 (1974). I write separately to emphasize that it is Mississippi's burden to prove that it has
undone its prior segregation, and that the circumstances in
which a State may maintain a policy or practice traceable to
de jure segregation that has segregative effects are narrow.
In light of the State's long history of discrimination, and the
lost educational and career opportunities and stigmatic
harms caused by discriminatory educational systems, see
Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, 494 (1954);
Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U. S. 629, 634-635 (1950); McLaurin
v. Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Ed., 339 U. S. 637,
640-641 (1950), the courts below must carefully examine Mississippi's proffered justifications for maintaining a remnant
of de jure segregation to ensure that such rationales do not
merely mask the perpetuation of discriminatory practices.
Where the State can accomplish legitimate educational objectives through less segregative means, the courts may
infer lack of good faith; "at the least it places a heavy burden
upon the [State] to explain its preference for an apparently
less effective method." Green v. School Bd. of New Kent
County, 391 U. S. 430, 439 (1968). In my view, it also follows
from the State's obligation to prove that it has "take[n] all
steps" to eliminate policies and practices traceable to de jure
segregation, Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U. S. 467, 485 (1992), that
if the State shows that maintenance of certain remnants of
its prior system is essential to accomplish its legitimate
goals, then it still must prove that it has counteracted and
minimized the segregative impact of such policies to the extent possible. Only by eliminating a remnant that unnecessarily continues to foster segregation or by negating insofar
as possible its segregative impact can the State satisfy its

constitutional obligation to dismantle the discriminatory sys-tem that should, by now, be only a distant memory.

Justice Thomas, concurring.
"We must rally to the defense of our schools. We mustrepudiate this unbearable assumption of the right to kill

institutions unless they conform to one narrow standard."
Du Bois, Schools, 13 The Crisis 111, 112 (1917).I agree with the Court that a State does not satisfy its

obligation to dismantle a dual system of higher educationmerely by adopting race-neutral policies for the future administration of that system. Today, we hold that "[i]f poli-cies traceable to the

de jure system are still in force and have
discriminatory effects, those policies too must be reformed tothe extent practicable and consistent with sound educational

practices." Ante, at 729. I agree that this statement defines the appropriate standard to apply in the higher education context. I write separately to emphasize that this
standard is far different from the one adopted to govern the
grade-school context in Green v. School Bd. of New Kent
County, 391 U. S. 430 (1968), and its progeny. In particular,
because it does not compel the elimination of all observed
racial imbalance, it portends neither the destruction of historically black colleges nor the severing of those institutions
from their distinctive histories and traditions.

In Green, we held that the adoption of a freedom-of-choice
plan does not satisfy the obligations of a formerly de jure
grade-school system should the plan fail to decrease, if not
eliminate, the racial imbalance within that system. See id.,
at 441. Although racial imbalance does not itself establish
a violation of the Constitution, our decisions following Green
indulged the presumption, often irrebuttable in practice, that
a presently observed imbalance has been proximately caused
by intentional state action during the prior de jure era.
See, e. g., Dayton Bd. of Ed. v. Brinkman, 443 U. S. 526, 537
(1979); Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, Denver, 413 U. S. 189,

Thomas, J., concurring
211 (1973). As a result, we have repeatedly authorized thedistrict courts to reassign students, despite the operation of

facially neutral assignment policies, in order to eliminate ordecrease observed racial imbalances. See,

e. g., Swann v.
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S. 1, 22-31 (1971);
Green, supra, at 442, n. 6.Whatever the merit of this approach in the grade-school

context, it is quite plainly not the approach that we adopttoday to govern the higher education context. We explicitly
reject the use of remedies as "radical" as student reassign-ment--

i. e., "remedies akin to those upheld in Green."
Ante, at 730, n. 4; see also ante, at 728-729. Of necessity,then, we focus on the specific

policies alleged to produce racial imbalance, rather than on the imbalance itself. Thus, a
plaintiff cannot obtain relief merely by identifying a persist-ent racial imbalance, because the district court cannot provide a reassignment remedy designed to eliminate that im-balance directly. Plaintiffs are likely to be able to identify,
as these plaintiffs have identified, specific policies traceableto the

de jure era that continue to produce a current racial
imbalance. As a practical matter, then, the district courtsadministering our standard will spend their time determining whether such policies have been adequately justified--
a far narrower, more manageable task than that imposed
under Green.

A challenged policy does not survive under the standard
we announce today if it began during the prior de jure era,
produces adverse impacts, and persists without sound educational justification. When each of these elements has been
met, I believe, we are justified in not requiring proof of a
present specific intent to discriminate. It is safe to assume
that a policy adopted during the de jure era, if it produces
segregative effects, reflects a discriminatory intent. As
long as that intent remains, of course, such a policy cannot
continue. And given an initially tainted policy, it is eminently reasonable to make the State bear the risk of nonpersuasion with respect to intent at some future time, both be505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT

cause the State has created the dispute through its own prior
unlawful conduct, see, e. g., Keyes, supra, at 209-210, and because discriminatory intent does tend to persist through
time, see, e. g., Hazelwood School Dist. v. United States, 433
U. S. 299, 309-310, n. 15 (1977). Although we do not formulate our standard in terms of a burden shift with respect to
intent, the factors we do consider--the historical background
of the policy, the degree of its adverse impact, and the plausibility of any justification asserted in its defense--are precisely those factors that go into determining intent under
Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229 (1976). See, e. g., Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development
Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 266-267 (1977). Thus, if a policy remains in force, without adequate justification and despite
tainted roots and segregative effect, it appears clear--clear
enough to presume conclusively--that the State has failed to
disprove discriminatory intent.

We have no occasion to elaborate upon what constitutes
an adequate justification. Under Green, we have recognized
that an otherwise unconstitutional policy may be justified if
it serves "important and legitimate ends," Dayton, supra,
at 538, or if its elimination is not "practicable," Board of
Ed. of Oklahoma City Public Schools v. Dowell, 498 U. S.
237, 250 (1991). As Justice Scalia points out, see post, at
753-754, our standard appears to mirror these formulations
rather closely. Nonetheless, I find most encouraging the
Court's emphasis on "sound educational practices," ante, at
729 (emphasis added); see also, e. g., ante, at 731 ("sound educational justification"); ante, at 736 ("sound educational policy").
From the beginning, we have recognized that desegregation
remedies cannot be designed to ensure the elimination of any
remnant at any price, but rather must display "a practical
flexibility" and "a facility for adjusting and reconciling public
and private needs." Brown v. Board of Education, 349
U. S. 294, 300 (1955). Quite obviously, one compelling need
to be considered is the educational need of the present and

future students in the Mississippi university system, forwhose benefit the remedies will be crafted.

In particular, we do not foreclose the possibility that thereexists "sound educational justification" for maintaining historically black colleges as such. Despite the shameful history of state-enforced segregation, these institutions havesurvived and flourished. Indeed, they have expanded as opportunities for blacks to enter historically white institutionshave expanded. Between 1954 and 1980, for example, enrollment at historically black colleges increased from 70,000to 200,000 students, while degrees awarded increased from
13,000 to 32,000. See S. Hill, National Center for EducationStatistics, The Traditionally Black Institutions of Higher Education 1860 to 1982, pp. xiv-xv (1985). These accomplishments have not gone unnoticed:

"The colleges founded for Negroes are both a source ofpride to blacks who have attended them and a source of

hope to black families who want the benefits of higher
learning for their children. They have exercised lead-ership in developing educational opportunities for young

blacks at all levels of instruction, and, especially in theSouth, they are still regarded as key institutions for enhancing the general quality of the lives of black Ameri-cans." Carnegie Commission on Higher Education,
From Isolation to Mainstream: Problems of the CollegesFounded for Negroes 11 (1971).

I think it undisputable that these institutions have suc-ceeded in part because of their distinctive histories and
traditions; for many, historically black colleges have become "a symbol of the highest attainments of black culture."
J. Preer, Lawyers v. Educators: Black Colleges and Desegregation in Public Higher Education 2 (1982). Obviously, a
State cannot maintain such traditions by closing particular
institutions, historically white or historically black, to particular racial groups. Nonetheless, it hardly follows that a

749Cite as: 505 U. S. 717 (1992)
Opinion of Scalia, J.
State cannot operate a diverse assortment of institutions--including historically black institutions--open to all on a

race-neutral basis, but with established traditions and pro-grams that might disproportionately appeal to one race or
another. No one, I imagine, would argue that such institutional diversity is without "sound educational justification,"or that it is even remotely akin to program

duplication,
which is designed to separate the races for the sake of sepa-rating the races. The Court at least hints at the importance

of this value when it distinguishes Green in part on theground that colleges and universities "are not fungible."
Ante, at 729. Although I agree that a State is not constitu-tionally

required to maintain its historically black institutions as such, see ante, at 743, I do not understand our
opinion to hold that a State is forbidden to do so. It would
be ironic, to say the least, if the institutions that sustained
blacks during segregation were themselves destroyed in an
effort to combat its vestiges.

Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment in part and
dissenting in part.

With some of what the Court says today, I agree. I agree,
of course, that the Constitution compels Mississippi to remove all discriminatory barriers to its state-funded universities. Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954)
(Brown I). I agree that the Constitution does not compel
Mississippi to remedy funding disparities between its historically black institutions (HBI's) and historically white institutions (HWI's). And I agree that Mississippi's American College Testing Program (ACT) requirements need further
review. I reject, however, the effectively unsustainable
burden the Court imposes on Mississippi, and all States that
formerly operated segregated universities, to demonstrate
compliance with Brown I. That requirement, which resembles what we prescribed for primary and secondary schools

(1968), has no proper application in the context of higher edu-cation, provides no genuine guidance to States and lower

courts, and is as likely to subvert as to promote the inter-ests of those citizens on whose behalf the present suit was
brought. I

Before evaluating the Court's handiwork, it is no smalltask simply to comprehend it. The Court sets forth not one,
but seemingly two different tests for ascertaining compli-ance with

Brown I--though in the last analysis they come tothe same. The Court initially announces the following test,

in Part III of its opinion: All policies (i) "traceable to [theState's] prior [de jure] system" (ii) "that continue to have
segregative effects--whether by influencing student enroll-ment decisions or by fostering segregation in other facets of
the university system--" must be eliminated (iii) to the ex-tent "practicabl[e]" and (iv) consistent with "sound educational" practices. Ante, at 731. When the Court comes toapplying its test, however, in Part IV of the opinion, "influencing student enrollment decisions" is not merely one exam-ple of a "segregative effec[t]," but is elevated to an independent and essential requirement of its own. The policies thatmust be eliminated are those that (i) are legacies of the dual
system, (ii) "contribute to the racial identifiability" of theState's universities (the same as (i) and (ii) in Part III), and,
in addition, (iii) do so in a way that "substantially restrict[s]a person's choice of which institution to enter." Ante, at
733 (emphasis added). See also ante, at 734-735, 738-739,741-743.

What the Court means by "substantially restrict[ing] aperson's choice of which institution to enter" is not clear.
During the course of the discussion in Part IV the require-ment changes from one of strong coercion ("substantially restrict," ante, at 733, "interfere," ante, at 741), to one of mid-dling pressure ("restrict,"

ante, at 734, "limi[t]," ante, at 741),to one of slight inducement ("inherent[ly] self-selec[t]," ante,

at 735, n. 9, "affect," ante, at 739, 742). If words have any

Opinion of Scalia, J.
meaning, in this last stage of decrepitude the requirementis so frail that almost anything will overcome it. Even an

open-admissions policy would fall short of ensuring that stu-dent choice is un

affected by state action. The Court's results also suggest that the "restricting choice" requirement
is toothless. Nothing else would explain how it could be metby Mississippi's mission designations, program duplication,

and operation of all eight formerly de jure colleges. Only atest aimed at state action that "affects" student choice could
implicate policies such as these, which in no way restrict thedecision where to attend college. (Indeed, program duplication and continuation of the eight schools have quite theopposite effect; they

multiply, rather than restrict, limit, or
impede the available choices.) At the end of the day, then,
the Court dilutes this potentially useful concept to the pointof such insignificance that it adds nothing to the Court's test

except confusion. It will be a fertile source of litigation.Almost as inscrutable in its operation as the "restricting
choice" requirement is the requirement that challenged statepractices perpetuate

de facto segregation. That is "likely"
met, the Court says, by Mississippi's mission designations.
Ante, at 741. Yet surely it is apparent that by designating
three colleges of the same prior disposition (HWI's) as the
only comprehensive schools, Mississippi encouraged integration; and that the suggested alternative of elevating an HBI
to comprehensive status (so that blacks could go there instead of to the HWI's) would have been an invitation to continuing segregation. See Ayers v. Allain, 674 F. Supp. 1523,
1562 (ND Miss. 1987) ("Approximately 30% of all black college students attending four-year colleges in the state attend
one of the comprehensive universities"). It appears, moreover, that even if a particular practice does not, in isolation,
rise to the minimal level of fostering segregation, it can be
aggregated with other ones, and the composite condemned.
See ante, at 739-740 ("by treating [the] issue [of program
duplication] in isolation, the [district] court failed to consider
the combined effects of unnecessary program duplication

with other policies, such as differential admissions stand-ards");

ante, at 741 ("[W]hen combined with the differential
admission practices and unnecessary program duplication, itis likely that the mission designations . . . tend to perpetuate

the segregated system"). It is interesting to speculate how
university administrators are going to guess which practicesa district judge will choose to aggregate; or how district

judges are going to guess when disaggregation is lawful.The Court appears to suggest that a practice that has been
aggregated and condemned may be disaggregated and ap-proved so long as it does not

itself "perpetuat[e] the segregated higher education system," ante, at 742--which seems,of course, to negate the whole purpose of aggregating in the

first place. The Court says:

"Elimination of program duplication and revision of
admissions criteria may make institutional closureunnecessary. . . . [O]n remand this issue should be carefully explored by inquiring and determining whether retention of all eight institutions itself . . . perpetuates thesegregated higher education system, whether maintenance of each of the universities is educationally justifi-able, and whether one or more of them can be practicably closed or merged with other existing institutions."
Ibid.

Perhaps the Court means, however, that even if retention ofall eight institutions is found by itself

not to "perpetuat[e]
the segregated higher education system," it must still befound that such retention is "educationally justifiable," or

that none of the institutions can be "practicably closed or
merged." It is unclear.

Besides the ambiguities inherent in the "restricting
choice" requirement and the requirement that the challenged
state practice or practices perpetuate segregation, I am not
sanguine that there will be comprehensible content to the
to-be-defined-later (and, make no mistake about it, outcome505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT

determinative) notions of "sound educational justification"and "impracticable elimination." In short, except for the results that it produces in the present litigation (which arewhat they are because the Court says so), I have not the
slightest idea how to apply the Court's analysis--and I doubt
whether anyone else will.Whether one consults the Court's description of what it

purports to be doing, in Part III, ante, at 727-732, or whatthe Court actually does, in Part IV,

ante, at 732-743, one
must conclude that the Court is essentially applying touniversities the amorphous standard adopted for primary

and secondary schools in Green v. School Bd. of New Kent
County, 391 U. S. 430 (1968). Like that case, today's decision places upon the State the ordinarily unsustainable burden of proving the negative proposition that it is not responsible for extant racial disparity in enrollment. See ante, at
728. Green requires school boards to prove that racially
identifiable schools are not the consequence of past or
present discriminatory state action, Swann v. CharlotteMecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S. 1, 26 (1971); today's opinion requires state university administrators to prove that
racially identifiable schools are not the consequence of any
practice or practices (in such impromptu "aggregation" as
might strike the fancy of a district judge) held over from the
prior de jure regime. This will imperil virtually any practice or program plaintiffs decide to challenge--just as Green
has--so long as racial imbalance remains. And just as under
Green, so also under today's decision, the only practicable
way of disproving that "existing racial identifiability is attributable to the State," ante, at 728, is to eliminate extant
segregation, i. e., to assure racial proportionality in the
schools. Failing that, the State's only defense will be to establish an excuse for each challenged practice--either impracticability of elimination, which is also a theoretical excuse under the Green regime, see Board of Ed. of Oklahoma
City Public Schools v. Dowell, 498 U. S. 237, 249-250 (1991),

or sound educational value, which (presumably) is not much
different from the "important and legitimate ends" excuse
available under Green, see Dayton Bd. of Ed. v. Brinkman,
443 U. S. 526, 538 (1979).

II

Application of the standard (or standards) announced
today has no justification in precedent, and in fact runs contrary to a case decided six years ago, see Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U. S. 385 (1986). The Court relies primarily upon
citations of Green and other primary and secondary school
cases. But those decisions left open the question whether
Green merits application in the distinct context of higher education. Beyond that, the Court relies on Brown I, Florida
ex rel. Hawkins v. Board of Control of Fla., 350 U. S. 413
(1956) (per curiam), and Gilmore v. City of Montgomery,
417 U. S. 556 (1974). That reliance also is mistaken.

The constitutional evil of the "separate but equal" regime
that we confronted in Brown I was that blacks were told to
go to one set of schools, whites to another. See Plessy v.
Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 (1896). What made this "evenhanded" racial partitioning offensive to equal protection was
its implicit stigmatization of minority students: "To separate
[black students] from others of similar age and qualifications
solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority
as to their status in the community that may affect their
hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone."
Brown I, 347 U. S., at 494. In the context of higher education, a context in which students decide whether to attend
school and if so where, the only unconstitutional derivations
of that bygone system are those that limit access on discriminatory bases; for only they have the potential to generate
the harm Brown I condemned, and only they have the potential to deny students equal access to the best public education a State has to offer. Legacies of the dual system that
permit (or even incidentally facilitate) free choice of racially

identifiable schools--while still assuring each individual stu-dent the right to attend

whatever school he wishes--do not
have these consequences.Our decisions immediately following

Brown I also fail to
sustain the Court's approach. They, too, suggest that former de jure States have one duty: to eliminate discrimina-tory obstacles to admission.

Brown v. Board of Education,
349 U. S. 294 (1955) (Brown II), requires States "to achievea system of determining admission to the public schools on a

nonracial basis," id., at 300-301, as do other cases of that era,see,

e. g., Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U. S. 1, 7 (1958); Goss v. Board
of Ed. of Knoxville, 373 U. S. 683, 687 (1963).

Nor do Hawkins or Gilmore support what the Court has
done. Hawkins involved a segregated graduate school, to
be sure. But our one-paragraph per curiam opinion supports nothing more than what I have said: The duty to
dismantle means the duty to establish nondiscriminatory admissions criteria. See 350 U. S., at 414 ("He is entitled to
prompt admission under the rules and regulations applicable
to other qualified candidates"). Establishment of neutral
admissions standards, not the eradication of all "policies
traceable to the de jure system . . . hav[ing] discriminatory
effects," ante, at 729, is what Hawkins is about. Finally,
Gilmore, quite simply, is inapposite. All that we did there
was uphold an order enjoining a city from granting exclusive
access to its parks and recreational facilities to segregated
private schools and to groups affiliated with such schools.
417 U. S., at 569. Notably, in the one case that does bear
proximately on today's decision, Bazemore, supra, we declined to apply Gilmore. See Bazemore, supra, at 408
(White, J., concurring) ("Our cases requiring parks and the
like to be desegregated lend no support for requiring more
than what has been done in this case").

If we are looking to precedent to guide us in the context
of higher education, we need not go back 38 years to Brown
I, read between the lines of Hawkins, or conjure authority

(Gilmore) that does not exist. In Bazemore v. Friday,
supra, we addressed a dispute parallel in all relevant respects to this one. At issue there was state financing of 4-Hand Homemaker youth clubs by the North Carolina Agricultural Extension Service, a division of North Carolina State
University. In the Plessy era, club affiliations had been dic-tated by race; after 1964, they were governed by neutral

criteria. Yet "there were a great many all-white and all-black clubs" at the time suit was filed. 478 U. S., at 407.
We nonetheless declined to adopt Green's requirement that"affirmative action [be taken] to integrate" once segregatedby-law/still segregated-in-fact state institutions. 478 U. S.,
at 408. We confined Green to primary and secondary public
schools, where "schoolchildren must go to school" and where
"school boards customarily have the power to create school
attendance areas and otherwise designate the school that
particular students may attend." 478 U. S, at 408. "[T]his
case," we said, "presents no current violation of the Fourteenth Amendment since the Service has discontinued its
prior discriminatory practices and has adopted a wholly
neutral admissions policy. The mere continued existence
of single-race clubs does not make out a constitutional violation." Ibid.

The Court asserts that we reached the result we did in
Bazemore "only after satisfying ourselves that the State had
not fostered segregation by playing a part in the decision of
which club an individual chose to join," ante, at 731--implying that we assured ourselves there, as the Court insists we
must do here, that none of the State's practices carried over
from de jure days incidentally played a part in the decision
of which club an individual chose to join. We did no such
thing. An accurate description of Bazemore was set forth
in Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469 (1989): "mere
existence of single-race clubs . . . cannot create a duty to
integrate," we said Bazemore held, "in absence of evidence
of exclusion by race," 488 U. S., at 503 (emphasis added)--

757Cite as: 505 U. S. 717 (1992)
Opinion of Scalia, J.
not "in absence of evidence of state action playing a part inthe decision of which club an individual chose to join." The

only thing we "satisfied ourselves" about in Bazemore wasthat the club members' choices were "wholly voluntary and
unfettered," 478 U. S., at 407--which does not mean the
State "play[ed] [no] part in the decision of which club an indi-vidual chose to join," however much the Court may mush the

concepts together today. It is, on the face of things, entirelyunbelievable that the previously established characteristics
of the various all-white and all-black 4-H Clubs (where eachof them met, for example) did not even play a part in young
people's decisions of which club to join.

Bazemore's standard for dismantling a dual system ought
to control here: discontinuation of discriminatory practices
and adoption of a neutral admissions policy. To use Green
nomenclature, modern racial imbalance remains a "vestige"
of past segregative practices in Mississippi's universities, in
that the previously mandated racial identification continues
to affect where students choose to enroll--just as it surely
affected which clubs students chose to join in Bazemore.
We tolerated this vestigial effect in Bazemore, squarely rejecting the view that the State was obliged to correct "the
racial segregation resulting from [its prior] practice[s]." 478
U. S., at 417 (Brennan, J., dissenting in part). And we declined to require the State, as the Court has today, to prove
that no holdover practices of the de jure system, e. g., program offerings in the different clubs, played a role in the
students' decisions of which clubs to join. If that analysis
was correct six years ago in Bazemore, and I think it was,
it must govern here as well. Like the club attendance in
Bazemore (and unlike the school attendance in Green), attending college is voluntary, not a legal obligation, and which
institution particular students attend is determined by their
own choice, not by "school boards [who] customarily have the
power to create school attendance areas and otherwise designate the school that particular students may attend." Baze505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:21 PAGES OPINPGT
758 UNITED STATES v. FORDICE

Opinion of Scalia, J.
more, supra, at 408. Indeed, Bazemore was a more appeal-ing case than these for adhering to the

Green approach, since
the 4-H Clubs served students similar in age to those in
Green, and had been "organized in the public schools" until
the early 1960's. 478 U. S., at 417.

It is my view that the requirement of compelled integra-tion (whether by student assignment, as in

Green itself, or
by elimination of nonintegrated options, as the Court todayeffectively decrees) does not apply to higher education.

Only one aspect of a historically segregated university sys-tem need be eliminated: discriminatory admissions standards. The burden is upon the formerly de jure system to
show that that has been achieved. Once that has been done,
however, it is not just unprecedented, but illogical as well, to
establish that former de jure States continue to deny equal
protection of the law to students whose choices among public
university offerings are unimpeded by discriminatory barriers. Unless one takes the position that Brown I required
States not only to provide equal access to their universities
but also to correct lingering disparities between them, that
is, to remedy institutional noncompliance with the "equal"
requirement of Plessy, a State is in compliance with Brown
I once it establishes that it has dismantled all discriminatory
barriers to its public universities. Having done that, a State
is free to govern its public institutions of higher learning as
it will, unless it is convicted of discriminating anew--which
requires both discriminatory intent and discriminatory causation. See Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229 (1976).

That analysis brings me to agree with the judgment that
the Court of Appeals must be reversed in part--for the reason (quite different from the Court's) that Mississippi has not
borne the burden of demonstrating that intentionally discriminatory admissions standards have been eliminated. It
has been established that Mississippi originally adopted ACT
assessments as an admissions criterion because that was an
effective means of excluding blacks from the HWI's. See

Ayers v. Allain, 674 F. Supp., at 1555; Ayers v. Allain, 914F. 2d 676, 690 (CA5 1990) (en banc). Given that finding, the

District Court should have required Mississippi to prove thatits continued use of ACT requirements does not have a racially exclusionary purpose and effect--a not insubstantialtask, see

Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U. S. 467, 503 (Scalia, J.,concurring).

III
I must add a few words about the unanticipated conse-quences of today's decision. Among petitioners' contentions

is the claim that the Constitution requires Mississippi to cor-rect funding disparities between its HBI's and HWI's. The
Court rejects that, see ante, at 743--as I think it should,since it is students and not colleges that are guaranteed
equal protection of the laws. See Sweatt v. Painter, 339U. S. 629, 635 (1950);

Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada, 305U. S. 337, 351 (1938). But to say that the Constitution does

not require equal funding is not to say that the Constitution
prohibits it. The citizens of a State may conclude that ifcertain of their public educational institutions are used predominantly by whites and others predominantly by blacks, itis desirable to fund those institutions more or less equally.

Ironically enough, however, today's decision seems to pre-vent adoption of such a conscious policy. What the Court
says about duplicate programs is as true of equal funding:The requirement "was part and parcel of the prior dual system." Ante, at 738. Moreover, equal funding, like programduplication, facilitates continued segregation--enabling students to attend schools where their own race predominateswithout paying a penalty in the quality of education. Nor
could such an equal-funding policy be saved on the basis thatit serves what the Court calls a "sound educational justification." The only conceivable educational value it furthers isthat of fostering schools in which blacks receive their education in a "majority" setting; but to acknowledge that as a"value" would contradict the compulsory-integration philoso505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:21 PAGES OPINPGT
760 UNITED STATES v. FORDICE

Opinion of Scalia, J.
phy that underlies Green. Just as vulnerable, of course,would be all other programs that have the effect of facilitating the continued existence of predominantly black institu-tions: elevating an HBI to comprehensive status (but see
ante, at 740-741, where the Court inexplicably suggests that
this action may be required); offering a so-called Afrocentriccurriculum, as has been done recently on an experimental

basis in some secondary and primary schools, see Jarvis,
Brown and the Afrocentric Curriculum, 101 Yale L. J. 1285,
1287, and n. 12 (1992); preserving eight separate universities,see

ante, at 741-742, which is perhaps Mississippi's single
policy most segregative in effect; or providing funding for
HBI's as HBI's, see 20 U. S. C. $$ 1060-1063c, which does
just that.

But this predictable impairment of HBI's should come as
no surprise: for incidentally facilitating--indeed, even tolerating--the continued existence of HBI's is not what the
Court's test is about, and has never been what Green is
about. See Green, 391 U. S., at 442 ("The Board must be
required to formulate a new plan and . . . fashion steps which
promise realistically to convert promptly to a system without
a `white' school and a `Negro' school") (footnote omitted).
What the Court's test is designed to achieve is the elimination of predominantly black institutions. While that may be
good social policy, the present petitioners, I suspect, would
not agree; and there is much to be said for the Court of Appeals' perception in Ayers, 914 F. 2d, at 687, that "if no [state]
authority exists to deny [the student] the right to attend the
institution of his choice, he is done a severe disservice by
remedies which, in seeking to maximize integration, minimize diversity and vitiate his choices." But whether or not
the Court's antagonism to unintegrated schooling is good policy, it is assuredly not good constitutional law. There is
nothing unconstitutional about a "black" school in the sense,
not of a school that blacks must attend and that whites cannot, but of a school that, as a consequence of private choice

in residence or in school selection, contains, and has long contained, a large black majority. See McLaurin v. Oklahoma
State Regents for Higher Ed., 339 U. S. 637, 641 (1950).
(The Court says this, see ante, at 743, but does not appear
to mean it, see ante, at 730, n. 4.) In a perverse way, in
fact, the insistence, whether explicit or implicit, that such
institutions not be permitted to endure perpetuates the very
stigma of black inferiority that Brown I sought to destroy.
Not only Mississippi, but Congress itself, seems out of step
with the drum that the Court beats today, judging by its
passage of an Act entitled "Strengthening Historically Black
Colleges and Universities," which authorizes the Education
Department to provide money grants to historically black
colleges. 20 U. S. C. $$ 1060-1063c. The implementing regulations designate Alcorn State University, Jackson State
University, and Mississippi Valley State University as eligible recipients. See 34 CFR $ 608.2(b) (1991).

* * *
The Court was asked to decide today whether, in the provision of university education, a State satisfies its duty under
Brown I by removing discriminatory barriers to admissions.
That question required us to choose between the standards
established in Green and Bazemore, both of which involved
(as, for the most part, this does) free-choice plans that failed
to end de facto segregation. Once the confusion engendered
by the Court's something-for-all, guidance-to-none opinion
has been dissipated, compare ante, at 744-745 (O'Connor, J.,
concurring), with ante, at 747-749 (Thomas, J., concurring),
it will become apparent that, essentially, the Court has
adopted Green.

I would not predict, however, that today's opinion will succeed in producing the same result as Green--viz., compelling
the States to compel racial "balance" in their schools--because of several practical imperfections: because the Court
deprives district judges of the most efficient (and perhaps

the only effective) Green remedy, mandatory student assign-ment, see ante, at 730, n. 4; because some contradictory

elements of the opinion (its suggestion, for example, thatMississippi's mission designations foster, rather than deter,
segregation) will prevent clarity of application; and becausethe virtually standardless discretion conferred upon district
judges (see Part I, supra) will permit them to do prettymuch what they please. What I do predict is a number of
years of litigation-driven confusion and destabilization in theuniversity systems of all the formerly

de jure States, thatwill benefit neither blacks nor whites, neither predominantly

black institutions nor predominantly white ones. Nothinggood will come of this judicially ordained turmoil, except the
public recognition that any court that would knowingly im-pose it must hate segregation. We must find some other
way of making that point.

TWO PESOS, INC. v. TACO CABANA, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 91-971. Argued April 21, 1992--Decided June 26, 1992
Respondent, the operator of a chain of Mexican restaurants, sued petitioner, a similar chain, for trade dress infringement under $ 43(a) of the
Trademark Act of 1946 (Lanham Act), which provides that "[a]ny person
who . . . use[s] in connection with any goods or services . . . any false
description or representation . . . shall be liable to . . . any person . . .
damaged by [such] use." The District Court instructed the jury, inter
alia, that respondent's trade dress was protected if it either was inherently distinctive--i. e., was not merely descriptive--or had acquired a
secondary meaning--i. e., had come through use to be uniquely associated with a specific source. The court entered judgment for respondent
after the jury found, among other things, that respondent's trade dress
is inherently distinctive but has not acquired a secondary meaning. In
affirming, the Court of Appeals ruled that the instructions adequately
stated the applicable law, held that the evidence supported the jury's
findings, and rejected petitioner's argument that a finding of no secondary meaning contradicted a finding of inherent distinctiveness.

Held: Trade that is inherently distinctive is protectable under $ 43(a)

without a showing that it has acquired secondary meaning, since such
trade dress itself is capable of identifying products or services as coming
from a specific source. This is the rule generally applicable to trademarks, see, e. g., Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition $ 13,
pp. 37-38, and the protection of trademarks and of trade dress under

$ 43(a) serves the same statutory purpose of preventing deception and
unfair competition. There is no textual basis for applying different analysis to the two. Section 43(a) mentions neither and does not contain the
concept of secondary meaning, and that concept, where it does appear

in the Lanham Act, is a requirement that applies only to merely descriptive marks and not to inherently distinctive ones. Engrafting a secondary meaning requirement onto $ 43(a) also would make more difficult the
identification of a producer with its product and thereby undermine the
Lanham Act's purposes of securing to a mark's owner the goodwill of
his business and protecting consumers' ability to distinguish among competing producers. Moreover, it could have anticompetitive effects by
creating burdens on the startup of small businesses. Petitioner's suggestion that such businesses be protected by briefly dispensing with the

1 The District Court instructed the jury: " `[T]rade dress' is the total

image of the business. Taco Cabana's trade dress may include the shape
and general appearance of the exterior of the restaurant, the identifying
sign, the interior kitchen floor plan, the decor, the menu, the equipment
used to serve food, the servers' uniforms and other features reflecting on
the total image of the restaurant." 1 App. 83-84. The Court of Appeals
accepted this definition and quoted from Blue Bell Bio-Medical v. CinBad, Inc., 864 F. 2d 1253, 1256 (CA5 1989): "The `trade dress' of a product
is essentially its total image and overall appearance." See 932 F. 2d 1113,
1118 (CA5 1991). It "involves the total image of a product and may include features such as size, shape, color or color combinations, texture,

(1982 ed.), based on a finding of inherent distinctiveness,without proof that the trade dress has secondary meaning.

I
Respondent Taco Cabana, Inc., operates a chain of fast-food restaurants in Texas. The restaurants serve Mexican

food. The first Taco Cabana restaurant was opened in SanAntonio in September 1978, and five more restaurants had
been opened in San Antonio by 1985. Taco Cabana de-scribes its Mexican trade dress as

"a festive eating atmosphere having interior dining andpatio areas decorated with artifacts, bright colors, paintings and murals. The patio includes interior and exte-rior areas with the interior patio capable of being sealed
off from the outside patio by overhead garage doors.The stepped exterior of the building is a festive and
vivid color scheme using top border paint and neonstripes. Bright awnings and umbrellas continue the
theme." 932 F. 2d 1113, 1117 (CA5 1991).
In December 1985, a Two Pesos, Inc., restaurant wasopened in Houston. Two Pesos adopted a motif very similar

to the foregoing description of Taco Cabana's trade dress.Two Pesos restaurants expanded rapidly in Houston and
other markets, but did not enter San Antonio. In 1986, TacoCabana entered the Houston and Austin markets and expanded into other Texas cities, including Dallas and El Pasowhere Two Pesos was also doing business.

In 1987, Taco Cabana sued Two Pesos in the United StatesDistrict Court for the Southern District of Texas for trade
dress infringement under $ 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15U. S. C. $ 1125(a) (1982 ed.),

under Texas common law. The case was tried to a jury,which was instructed to return its verdict in the form of

answers to five questions propounded by the trial judge.The jury's answers were: Taco Cabana has a trade dress;
taken as a whole, the trade dress is nonfunctional; the tradedress is inherently distinctive;

3 the trade dress has not acquired a secondary meaning 4 in the Texas market; and thealleged infringement creates a likelihood of confusion on the

part of ordinary customers as to the source or association ofthe restaurant's goods or services. Because, as the jury was
told, Taco Cabana's trade dress was protected if it either wasinherently distinctive or had acquired a secondary meaning,
judgment was entered awarding damages to Taco Cabana.In the course of calculating damages, the trial court held that
Two Pesos had intentionally and deliberately infringed TacoCabana's trade dress.

scribe or represent the same, and shall cause such goods or services to
enter into commerce, and any person who shall with knowledge of the
falsity of such designation of origin or description or representation cause
or procure the same to be transported or used in commerce or deliver the
same to any carrier to be transported or used, shall be liable to a civil
action by any person doing business in the locality falsely indicated as that
of origin or in the region in which said locality is situated, or by any person
who believes that he is or is likely to be damaged by the use of any such
false description or representation." 60 Stat. 441.

This provision has been superseded by $ 132 of the Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988, 102 Stat. 3946, 15 U. S. C. $ 1121.

3 The instructions were that, to be found inherently distinctive, the trade

dress must not be descriptive.

4 Secondary meaning is used generally to indicate that a mark or dress

"has come through use to be uniquely associated with a specific source."
Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition $ 13, Comment e (Tent. Draft
No. 2, Mar. 23, 1990). "To establish secondary meaning, a manufacturer
must show that, in the minds of the public, the primary significance of a
product feature or term is to identify the source of the product rather
than the product itself." Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories,
Inc., 456 U. S. 844, 851, n. 11 (1982).

Opinion of the Court
The Court of Appeals ruled that the instructions ade-quately stated the applicable law and that the evidence

supported the jury's findings. In particular, the Court ofAppeals rejected petitioner's argument that a finding of
no secondary meaning contradicted a finding of inherentdistinctiveness.

In so holding, the court below followed precedent in theFifth Circuit. In

Chevron Chemical Co. v. Voluntary Pur-chasing Groups, Inc., 659 F. 2d 695, 702 (CA5 1981), the court

noted that trademark law requires a demonstration of sec-ondary meaning only when the claimed trademark is not sufficiently distinctive of itself to identify the producer; thecourt held that the same principles should apply to protection of trade dresses. The Court of Appeals noted that thisapproach conflicts with decisions of other courts, particularly
the holding of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in
Vibrant Sales, Inc. v. New Body Boutique, Inc., 652 F. 2d 299(1981), cert. denied, 455 U. S. 909 (1982), that $ 43(a) protects

unregistered trademarks or designs only where secondarymeaning is shown.

Chevron, supra, at 702. We grantedcertiorari to resolve the conflict among the Courts of Appeals on the question whether trade dress that is inherentlydistinctive is protectible under $ 43(a) without a showing that
it has acquired secondary meaning.6 502 U. S. 1071 (1992).We find that it is, and we therefore affirm.

The Lanham Act 7 was intended to make "actionable thedeceptive and misleading use of marks" and "to protect perforeclosed several lucrative markets within Taco Cabana's natural zone of
expansion." 932 F. 2d, at 1127, n. 20.

6 We limited our grant of certiorari to the above question on which there

is a conflict. We did not grant certiorari on the second question presented
by the petition, which challenged the Court of Appeals' acceptance of the
jury's finding that Taco Cabana's trade dress was not functional.

$ 45, 15 U. S. C. $ 1127. Section 43(a) "prohibits a broader
range of practices than does $ 32," which applies to registered marks, Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories,
Inc., 456 U. S. 844, 858 (1982), but it is common ground that

$ 43(a) protects qualifying unregistered trademarks and that
the general principles qualifying a mark for registration
under $ 2 of the Lanham Act are for the most part applicable
in determining whether an unregistered mark is entitled to
protection under $ 43(a). See A. J. Canfield Co. v. Honickman, 808 F. 2d 291, 299, n. 9 (CA3 1986); Thompson Medical
Co. v. Pfizer Inc., 753 F. 2d 208, 215-216 (CA2 1985).

A trademark is defined in 15 U. S. C. $ 1127 as including
"any word, name, symbol, or device or any combination
thereof " used by any person "to identify and distinguish his
or her goods, including a unique product, from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the
goods, even if that source is unknown." In order to be registered, a mark must be capable of distinguishing the applicant's goods from those of others. $ 1052. Marks are often
classified in categories of generally increasing distinctiveness; following the classic formulation set out by Judge
Friendly, they may be (1) generic; (2) descriptive; (3) suggestive; (4) arbitrary; or (5) fanciful. See Abercrombie & Fitch
Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., 537 F. 2d 4, 9 (CA2 1976). The
Court of Appeals followed this classification and petitioner
accepts it. Brief for Petitioner 11-15. The latter three categories of marks, because their intrinsic nature serves to
identify a particular source of a product, are deemed inherently distinctive and are entitled to protection. In contrast,
generic marks--those that "refe[r] to the genus of which the
particular product is a species," Park 'N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar
Park & Fly, Inc., 469 U. S. 189, 194 (1985), citing Abercrombie & Fitch, supra, at 9--are not registrable as trademarks.

Opinion of the Court
Marks which are merely descriptive of a product are not
inherently distinctive. When used to describe a product,
they do not inherently identify a particular source, and hence
cannot be protected. However, descriptive marks may acquire the distinctiveness which will allow them to be protected under the Act. Section 2 of the Lanham Act provides
that a descriptive mark that otherwise could not be registered under the Act may be registered if it "has become distinctive of the applicant's goods in commerce." $$ 2(e), (f ),
15 U. S. C. $$ 1052(e), (f). See Park 'N Fly, supra, at 194,
196. This acquired distinctiveness is generally called "secondary meaning." See ibid.; Inwood Laboratories, supra,
at 851, n. 11; Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co., 305 U. S.
111, 118 (1938). The concept of secondary meaning has been
applied to actions under $ 43(a). See, e. g., University of
Georgia Athletic Assn. v. Laite, 756 F. 2d 1535 (CA11 1985);
Thompson Medical Co. v. Pfizer Inc., supra.

The general rule regarding distinctiveness is clear: An
identifying mark is distinctive and capable of being protected
if it either (1) is inherently distinctive or (2) has acquired
distinctiveness through secondary meaning. Restatement
(Third) of Unfair Competition $ 13, pp. 37-38, and Comment
a (Tent. Draft No. 2, Mar. 23, 1990). Cf. Park 'N Fly, supra,
at 194. It is also clear that eligibility for protection under

$ 43(a) depends on nonfunctionality. See, e. g., Inwood Laboratories, supra, at 863 (White, J., concurring in result); see
also, e. g., Brunswick Corp. v. Spinit Reel Co., 832 F. 2d 513,

Opinion of the Court
supra, at 1535; First Brands, supra, at 1381; Stormy Clime,supra, at 974; American Greetings, supra, at 1141.

The Court of Appeals determined that the District Court'sinstructions were consistent with the foregoing principles
and that the evidence supported the jury's verdict. Bothcourts thus ruled that Taco Cabana's trade dress was not
descriptive but rather inherently distinctive, and that it wasnot functional. None of these rulings is before us in this
case, and for present purposes we assume, without deciding,that each of them is correct. In going on to affirm the judgment for respondent, the Court of Appeals, following itsprior decision in

Chevron, held that Taco Cabana's inherentlydistinctive trade dress was entitled to protection despite the

lack of proof of secondary meaning. It is this issue that isbefore us for decision, and we agree with its resolution by
the Court of Appeals. There is no persuasive reason toapply to trade dress a general requirement of secondary
meaning which is at odds with the principles generally appli-cable to infringement suits under $ 43(a). Petitioner devotes
much of its briefing to arguing issues that are not before us,and we address only its arguments relevant to whether proof
of secondary meaning is essential to qualify an inherentlydistinctive trade dress for protection under $ 43(a).

Petitioner argues that the jury's finding that the tradedress has not acquired a secondary meaning shows conclusively that the trade dress is not inherently distinctive.Brief for Petitioner 9. The Court of Appeals' disposition of
this issue was sound:

"Two Pesos' argument--that the jury finding of inherentdistinctiveness contradicts its finding of no secondary

meaning in the Texas market--ignores the law in thiscircuit. While the necessarily imperfect (and often prohibitively difficult) methods for assessing secondarymeaning address the empirical question of current consumer association, the legal recognition of an inherentlydistinctive trademark or trade dress acknowledges the

Opinion of the Court
owner's legitimate proprietary interest in its unique and
valuable informational device, regardless of whether
substantial consumer association yet bestows the additional empirical protection of secondary meaning." 932
F. 2d, at 1120, n. 7.

Although petitioner makes the above argument, it appears
to concede elsewhere in its brief that it is possible for a trade
dress, even a restaurant trade dress, to be inherently distinctive and thus eligible for protection under $ 43(a). Brief for
Petitioner 10-11, 17-18; Reply Brief for Petitioner 10-14.
Recognizing that a general requirement of secondary meaning imposes "an unfair prospect of theft [or] financial loss" on
the developer of fanciful or arbitrary trade dress at the outset of its use, petitioner suggests that such trade dress
should receive limited protection without proof of secondary
meaning. Id., at 10. Petitioner argues that such protection
should be only temporary and subject to defeasance when
over time the dress has failed to acquire a secondary meaning. This approach is also vulnerable for the reasons given
by the Court of Appeals. If temporary protection is available from the earliest use of the trade dress, it must be
because it is neither functional nor descriptive, but an inherently distinctive dress that is capable of identifying a particular source of the product. Such a trade dress, or mark, is
not subject to copying by concerns that have an equal opportunity to choose their own inherently distinctive trade dress.
To terminate protection for failure to gain secondary meaning over some unspecified time could not be based on the
failure of the dress to retain its fanciful, arbitrary, or suggestive nature, but on the failure of the user of the dress to be
successful enough in the marketplace. This is not a valid
basis to find a dress or mark ineligible for protection. The
user of such a trade dress should be able to maintain what
competitive position it has and continue to seek wider identification among potential customers.

772 TWO PESOS, INC. v. TACO CABANA, INC.

Opinion of the Court
This brings us to the line of decisions by the Court of Ap-peals for the Second Circuit that would find protection for

trade dress unavailable absent proof of secondary meaning,a position that petitioner concedes would have to be modified
if the temporary protection that it suggests is to be recognized. Brief for Petitioner 10-14. In Vibrant Sales, Inc. v.
New Body Boutique, Inc., 652 F. 2d 299 (1981), the plaintiff
claimed protection under $ 43(a) for a product whose featuresthe defendant had allegedly copied. The Court of Appeals

held that unregistered marks did not enjoy the "presumptivesource association" enjoyed by registered marks and hence
could not qualify for protection under $ 43(a) without proof of
secondary meaning. Id., at 303, 304. The court's rationale
seemingly denied protection for unregistered, but inherently
distinctive, marks of all kinds, whether the claimed mark
used distinctive words or symbols or distinctive product design. The court thus did not accept the arguments that an
unregistered mark was capable of identifying a source and
that copying such a mark could be making any kind of a false
statement or representation under $ 43(a).

This holding is in considerable tension with the provisions
of the Lanham Act. If a verbal or symbolic mark or the
features of a product design may be registered under $ 2, it
necessarily is a mark "by which the goods of the applicant
may be distinguished from the goods of others," 60 Stat. 428,
and must be registered unless otherwise disqualified. Since

$ 2 requires secondary meaning only as a condition to registering descriptive marks, there are plainly marks that are
registrable without showing secondary meaning. These
same marks, even if not registered, remain inherently capable of distinguishing the goods of the users of these marks.
Furthermore, the copier of such a mark may be seen as
falsely claiming that his products may for some reason be
thought of as originating from the plaintiff.

Some years after Vibrant, the Second Circuit announced
in Thompson Medical Co. v. Pfizer Inc., 753 F. 2d 208 (1985),

505US3114D 07-09-96 12:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT

773Cite as: 505 U. S. 763 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
that in deciding whether an unregistered mark is eligible forprotection under $ 43(a), it would follow the classification of

marks set out by Judge Friendly in Abercrombie & Fitch,537 F. 2d, at 9. Hence, if an unregistered mark is deemed
merely descriptive, which the verbal mark before the court
proved to be, proof of secondary meaning is required; how-ever, "[s]uggestive marks are eligible for protection without

any proof of secondary meaning, since the connection be-tween the mark and the source is presumed." 753 F. 2d, at
216. The Second Circuit has nevertheless continued to denyprotection for trade dress under $ 43(a) absent proof of secondary meaning, despite the fact that $ 43(a) provides no
basis for distinguishing between trademark and trade dress.
See, e. g., Stormy Clime Ltd. v. ProGroup, Inc., 809 F. 2d, at
974; Union Mfg. Co. v. Han Baek Trading Co., 763 F. 2d 42,
48 (1985); LeSportsac, Inc. v. K mart Corp., 754 F. 2d 71,
75 (1985).

The Fifth Circuit was quite right in Chevron, and in this
case, to follow the Abercrombie classifications consistently
and to inquire whether trade dress for which protection is
claimed under $ 43(a) is inherently distinctive. If it is, it is
capable of identifying products or services as coming from a
specific source and secondary meaning is not required. This
is the rule generally applicable to trademarks, and the protection of trademarks and trade dress under $ 43(a) serves
the same statutory purpose of preventing deception and unfair competition. There is no persuasive reason to apply different analysis to the two. The "proposition that secondary
meaning must be shown even if the trade dress is a distinctive, identifying mark, [is] wrong, for the reasons explained
by Judge Rubin for the Fifth Circuit in Chevron." Blau
Plumbing, Inc. v. S. O. S. Fix-It, Inc., 781 F. 2d 604, 608 (CA7
1986). The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit also
follows Chevron, Ambrit, Inc. v. Kraft, Inc., 805 F. 2d 974,
979 (1986), and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
appears to think that proof of secondary meaning is super505US3114D 07-09-96 12:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
fluous if a trade dress is inherently distinctive, Fuddruckers,
Inc. v. Doc's B. R. Others, Inc., 826 F. 2d 837, 843 (1987).

It would be a different matter if there were textual basis
in $ 43(a) for treating inherently distinctive verbal or symbolic trademarks differently from inherently distinctive
trade dress. But there is none. The section does not mention trademarks or trade dress, whether they be called generic, descriptive, suggestive, arbitrary, fanciful, or functional. Nor does the concept of secondary meaning appear
in the text of $ 43(a). Where secondary meaning does
appear in the statute, 15 U. S. C. $ 1052 (1982 ed.), it is a
requirement that applies only to merely descriptive marks
and not to inherently distinctive ones. We see no basis for
requiring secondary meaning for inherently distinctive trade
dress protection under $ 43(a) but not for other distinctive
words, symbols, or devices capable of identifying a producer's product.

Engrafting onto $ 43(a) a requirement of secondary meaning for inherently distinctive trade dress also would undermine the purposes of the Lanham Act. Protection of trade
dress, no less than of trademarks, serves the Act's purpose
to "secure to the owner of the mark the goodwill of his business and to protect the ability of consumers to distinguish
among competing producers. National protection of trademarks is desirable, Congress concluded, because trademarks
foster competition and the maintenance of quality by securing to the producer the benefits of good reputation." Park
'N Fly, 469 U. S., at 198, citing S. Rep. No. 1333, 79th Cong.,
2d Sess., 3-5 (1946) (citations omitted). By making more
difficult the identification of a producer with its product, a
secondary meaning requirement for a nondescriptive trade
dress would hinder improving or maintaining the producer's
competitive position.

Suggestions that under the Fifth Circuit's law, the initial
user of any shape or design would cut off competition from

775Cite as: 505 U. S. 763 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
products of like design and shape are not persuasive. Only
nonfunctional, distinctive trade dress is protected under

$ 43(a). The Fifth Circuit holds that a design is legally functional, and thus unprotectible, if it is one of a limited number
of equally efficient options available to competitors and free
competition would be unduly hindered by according the design trademark protection. See Sicilia Di R. Biebow & Co.
v. Cox, 732 F. 2d 417, 426 (1984). This serves to assure that
competition will not be stifled by the exhaustion of a limited
number of trade dresses.

On the other hand, adding a secondary meaning requirement could have anticompetitive effects, creating particular
burdens on the startup of small companies. It would present special difficulties for a business, such as respondent,
that seeks to start a new product in a limited area and then
expand into new markets. Denying protection for inherently distinctive nonfunctional trade dress until after secondary meaning has been established would allow a competitor,
which has not adopted a distinctive trade dress of its own,
to appropriate the originator's dress in other markets and to
deter the originator from expanding into and competing in
these areas.

As noted above, petitioner concedes that protecting an inherently distinctive trade dress from its inception may be
critical to new entrants to the market and that withholding
protection until secondary meaning has been established
would be contrary to the goals of the Lanham Act. Petitioner specifically suggests, however, that the solution is to
dispense with the requirement of secondary meaning for a
reasonable, but brief, period at the outset of the use of a
trade dress. Reply Brief for Petitioner 11-12. If $ 43(a)
does not require secondary meaning at the outset of a business' adoption of trade dress, there is no basis in the statute
to support the suggestion that such a requirement comes into
being after some unspecified time.

We agree with the Court of Appeals that proof of secondary meaning is not required to prevail on a claim under

$ 43(a) of the Lanham Act where the trade dress at issue is
inherently distinctive, and accordingly the judgment of that
court is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, concurring.
I write separately to note my complete agreement with
Justice Thomas's explanation as to how the language of

$ 43(a) and its common-law derivation are broad enough to
embrace inherently distinctive trade dress. Nevertheless,
because I find that analysis to be complementary to (and
not inconsistent with) the Court's opinion, I concur in the
latter.

Justice Stevens, concurring in the judgment.
As the Court notes in its opinion, the text of $ 43(a) of the
Lanham Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 1125(a) (1982 ed.), "does not mention trademarks or trade dress." Ante, at 774. Nevertheless, the Court interprets this section as having created a
federal cause of action for infringement of an unregistered
trademark or trade dress and concludes that such a mark or
dress should receive essentially the same protection as those
that are registered. Although I agree with the Court's conclusion, I think it is important to recognize that the meaning
of the text has been transformed by the federal courts over
the past few decades. I agree with this transformation,
even though it marks a departure from the original text, because it is consistent with the purposes of the statute and
has recently been endorsed by Congress.

It is appropriate to begin with the relevant text of $ 43(a).1See,

e. g., Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103 (1990);K mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 U. S. 281, 291 (1988);

United States v. Turkette, 452 U. S. 576, 580 (1981). Section43(a)

2 provides a federal remedy for using either "a false

designation of origin" or a "false description or representa-tion" in connection with any goods or services. The full text

of the section makes it clear that the word "origin" refers tothe geographic location in which the goods originated, and
in fact, the phrase "false designation of origin" was under-stood to be limited to false advertising of geographic origin.
For example, the "false designation of origin" language con1 The text that we consider today is $ 43(a) of the Lanham Act prior to
the 1988 amendments; it provides:

"Any person who shall affix, apply, or annex, or use in connection with
any goods or services, or any container or containers for goods, a false
designation of origin, or any false description or representation, including
words or other symbols tending falsely to describe or represent the same,
and shall cause such goods or services to enter into commerce, and any
person who shall with knowledge of the falsity of such designation of origin or description or representation cause or procure the same to be transported or used in commerce or deliver the same to any carrier to be transported or used, shall be liable to a civil action by any person doing business
in the locality falsely indicated as that of origin or in the region in which
said locality is situated, or by any person who believes that he is or is
likely to be damaged by the use of any such false description or representation." 15 U. S. C. $ 1125(a) (1982 ed.).

2 Section 43(a) replaced and extended the coverage of $ 3 of the Trademark Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 534, as amended. Section 3 was destined for
oblivion largely because it referred only to false designation of origin, was
limited to articles of merchandise, thus excluding services, and required a
showing that the use of the false designation of origin occurred "willfully
and with intent to deceive." Ibid. As a result, "[a]lmost no reported
decision can be found in which relief was granted to either a United States
or foreign party based on this newly created remedy." Derenberg, Federal Unfair Competition Law at the End of the First Decade of the Lanham Act: Prologue or Epilogue?, 32 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1029, 1034 (1957).

For a number of years after the 1946 enactment of theLanham Act, a "false description or representation," like "a

false designation of origin," was construed narrowly. The
phrase encompassed two kinds of wrongs: false advertis-ing

4 and the common-law tort of "passing off." 5 False advertising meant representing that goods or services pos-sessed characteristics that they did not actually have and

passing off meant representing one's goods as those of an-other. Neither "secondary meaning" nor "inherent distinctiveness" had anything to do with false advertising, but proofof secondary meaning was an element of the common-law

3 This is clear from the fact that the cause of action created by this
section is available only to a person doing business in the locality falsely
indicated as that of origin. See n. 1, supra.

4 The deleterious effects of false advertising were described by one commentator as follows: "[A] campaign of false advertising may completely
discredit the product of an industry, destroy the confidence of consumers
and impair a communal or trade good will. Less tangible but nevertheless real is the injury suffered by the honest dealer who finds it necessary
to meet the price competition of inferior goods, glamorously misdescribed
by the unscrupulous merchant. The competition of a liar is always dangerous even though the exact injury may not be susceptible of precise
proof." Handler, Unfair Competition, 21 Iowa L. Rev. 175, 193 (1936).

5 The common-law tort of passing off has been described as follows:

"Beginning in about 1803, English and American common law slowly
developed an offshoot of the tort of fraud and deceit and called it `passing
off' or `palming off.' Simply stated, passing off as a tort consists of one
passing off his goods as the goods of another. In 1842 Lord Langdale
wrote:

" `I think that the principle on which both the courts of law and equity
proceed is very well understood. A man is not to sell his own goods under
the pretence that they are the goods of another man. . . .'

"In 19th century cases, trademark infringement embodied much of the
elements of fraud and deceit from which trademark protection developed.
That is, the element of fraudulent intent was emphasized over the objective facts of consumer confusion." 1 J. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair
Competition $ 5.2, p. 133 (2d ed. 1984) (McCarthy) (footnotes omitted).

passing-off cause of action. See, e. g., G. & C. Merriam Co.v. Saalfield, 198 F. 369, 372 (CA6 1912) ("The ultimate offense always is that defendant has passed off his goods asand for those of the complainant").

II
Over time, the Circuits have expanded the categories of"false designation of origin" and "false description or representation." One treatise 6 identified the Court of Appealsfor the Sixth Circuit as the first to broaden the meaning of
"origin" to include "origin of source or manufacture" in addi-tion to geographic origin.

7 Another early case, described as

unique among the Circuit cases because it was so "forward-looking,"

8 interpreted the "false description or representation" language to mean more than mere "palming off." L'Aiglon Apparel, Inc. v. Lana Lobell, Inc., 214 F. 2d 649 (CA31954). The court explained: "We find nothing in the legislative history of the Lanham Act to justify the view that[$ 43(a)] is merely declarative of existing law. . . . It seems to
us that Congress has defined a statutory civil wrong of falserepresentation of goods in commerce and has given a broad
class of suitors injured or likely to be injured by such wrongthe right to relief in the federal courts."

embedded reality." 10 The United States Trade AssociationTrademark Review Commission noted this transformation

with approval: "Section 43(a) is an enigma, but a very popu-lar one. Narrowly drawn and intended to reach false designations or representations as to the geographical origin of
products, the section has been widely interpreted to create,in essence, a federal law of unfair competition. . . . It has

definitely eliminated a gap in unfair competition law, and itsvitality is showing no signs of age."

11

Today, it is less significant whether the infringement fallsunder "false designation of origin" or "false description or

representation" 12 because in either case $ 43(a) may be in-voked. The federal courts are in agreement that $ 43(a) creates a federal cause of action for trademark and trade dressinfringement claims. 1 J. Gilson, Trademark Protection and
Practice $ 2.13, p. 2-178 (1991). They are also in agreementthat the test for liability is likelihood of confusion: "[U]nder
the Lanham Act [$ 43(a)], the ultimate test is whether the
public is likely to be deceived or confused by the similarity
of the marks. . . . Whether we call the violation infringement, unfair competition or false designation of origin, the
test is identical--is there a `likelihood of confusion?' " New

that it was not designed to function").

general agreement,13 with perhaps the exception of the Sec-ond Circuit,

14 that secondary meaning need not be established once there is a finding of inherent distinctiveness inorder to establish a trade dress violation under $ 43(a).

III
Even though the lower courts' expansion of the categoriescontained in $ 43(a) is unsupported by the text of the Act, I

am persuaded that it is consistent with the general purposesof the Act. For example, Congressman Lanham, the bill's
sponsor, stated: "The purpose of [the Act] is to protect le13 See, e. g., AmBrit, Inc. v. Kraft, Inc., 805 F. 2d 974 (CA11 1986), cert.

(1982); see also Fuddruckers, Inc. v. Doc's B. R. Others, Inc., 826 F. 2d
837, 843-844 (CA9 1987); M. Kramer Mfg. Co. v. Andrews, 783 F. 2d 421,
449, n. 26 (CA4 1986).

14 Consistent with the common-law background of $ 43(a), the Second

Circuit has said that proof of secondary meaning is required to establish a
claim that the defendant has traded on the plaintiff's good will by falsely
representing that his goods are those of the plaintiff. See, e. g., Crescent
Tool Co. v. Kilborn & Bishop Co., 247 F. 299 (1917). To my knowledge,
however, the Second Circuit has not explained why "inherent distinctiveness" is not an appropriate substitute for proof of secondary meaning in a
trade dress case. Most of the cases in which the Second Circuit has said
that secondary meaning is required did not involve findings of inherent
distinctiveness. For example, in Vibrant Sales, Inc. v. New Body Boutique, Inc., 652 F. 2d 299 (1981), cert. denied, 455 U. S. 909 (1982), the
product at issue--a velcro belt--was functional and lacked "any distinctive, unique or non-functional mark or feature." 652 F. 2d, at 305. Similarly, in Stormy Clime Ltd. v. ProGroup, Inc., 809 F. 2d 971, 977 (1987),
the court described functionality as a continuum, and placed the contested
rainjacket closer to the functional end than to the distinctive end. Although the court described the lightweight bag in LeSportsac, Inc. v.
K mart Corp., 754 F. 2d 71 (1985), as having a distinctive appearance and
concluded that the District Court's finding of nonfunctionality was not
clearly erroneous, id., at 74, it did not explain why secondary meaning was
also required in such a case.

gitimate business and the consumers of the country." 15 92Cong. Rec. 7524 (1946). One way of accomplishing these

dual goals was by creating uniform legal rights and remediesthat were appropriate for a national economy. Although the
protection of trademarks had once been "entirely a Statematter," the result of such a piecemeal approach was that
there were almost "as many different varieties of commonlaw as there are States" so that a person's right to a trademark "in one State may differ widely from the rights which[that person] enjoys in another." H. R. Rep. No. 944, 76th
Cong., 1st Sess., 4 (1939). The House Committee on Trade-marks and Patents, recognizing that "trade is no longer local,
but . . . national," saw the need for "national legislation alongnational lines [to] secur[e] to the owners of trademarks in
interstate commerce definite rights." Ibid.16

15 The Senate Report elaborated on these two goals:
"The purpose underlying any trade-mark statute is twofold. One is to
protect the public so it may be confident that, in purchasing a product
bearing a particular trade-mark which it favorably knows, it will get the
product which it asks for and wants to get. Secondly, where the owner
of a trade-mark has spent energy, time, and money in presenting to the
public the product, he is protected in his investment from its misappropriation by pirates and cheats. This is the well-established rule of law protecting both the public and the trade-mark owner." S. Rep. No. 1333,
79th Cong., 2d Sess., 3 (1946).

By protecting trademarks, Congress hoped "to protect the public from
deceit, to foster fair competition, and to secure to the business community
the advantages of reputation and good will by preventing their diversion
from those who have created them to those who have not. This is the
end to which this bill is directed." Id., at 4.

16 Forty years later, the USTA Trademark Review Commission assessed

the state of trademark law. The conclusion that it reached serves as a
testimonial to the success of the Act in achieving its goal of uniformity:
"The federal courts now decide, under federal law, all but a few trademark
disputes. State trademark law and state courts are less influential than
ever. Today the Lanham Act is the paramount source of trademark law
in the United States, as interpreted almost exclusively by the federal
courts." Trademark Review Commission, 77 Trademark Rep., at 377.

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
Congress has revisited this statute from time to time, and
has accepted the "judicial legislation" that has created this
federal cause of action. Recently, for example, in the Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988, 102 Stat. 3935, Congress
codified the judicial interpretation of $ 43(a), giving its imprimatur to a growing body of case law from the Circuits
that had expanded the section beyond its original language.

Although Congress has not specifically addressed the
question whether secondary meaning is required under

$ 43(a), the steps it has taken in this subsequent legislation
suggest that secondary meaning is not required if inherent
distinctiveness has been established.17 First, Congress
broadened the language of $ 43(a) to make explicit that the
provision prohibits "any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof " that is "likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation,
connection, or association of such person with another person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or
her goods, services, or commercial activities by another person." 15 U. S. C. $ 1125(a). That language makes clear that
a confusingly similar trade dress is actionable under $ 43(a),
without necessary reference to "falsity." Second, Congress
approved and confirmed the extensive judicial development
under the provision, including its application to trade dress
that the federal courts had come to apply.18 Third, the legis17 "When several acts of Congress are passed touching the same subjectmatter, subsequent legislation may be considered to assist in the interpretation of prior legislation upon the same subject." Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221 U. S. 286, 309 (1911); see NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co. of
Textron, Inc., 416 U. S. 267, 275 (1974); Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC,

(1923) (opinion of Holmes, J.).

18 As the Senate Report explained, revision of $ 43(a) is designed

"to codify the interpretation it has been given by the courts. Because
Section 43(a) of the Act fills an important gap in federal unfair compe505US3114D 07-09-96 12:05:25 PAGES OPINPGT

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
lative history of the 1988 amendments reaffirms Congress'goals of protecting both businesses and consumers with the

Lanham Act.19 And fourth, Congress explicitly extended toany violation of $ 43(a) the basic Lanham Act remedial provisions whose text previously covered only registered trade-marks.

20 The aim of the amendments was to apply the same

protections to unregistered marks as were already affordedto registered marks. See S. Rep. No. 100-515, p. 40 (1988).

These steps buttress the conclusion that $ 43(a) is properlyunderstood to provide protection in accordance with the
standards for registration in $ 2. These aspects of the 1988legislation bolster the claim that an inherently distinctive
trade dress may be protected under $ 43(a) without proof ofsecondary meaning.

IV
In light of the consensus among the Courts of Appealsthat have actually addressed the question, and the steps

on the part of Congress to codify that consensus, stare
decisis concerns persuade me to join the Court's conclusionthat secondary meaning is not required to establish a trade

dress violation under $ 43(a) once inherent distinctiveness
tition law, the committee expects the courts to continue to interpret the
section.

"As written, Section 43(a) appears to deal only with false descriptions
or representations and false designations of geographic origin. Since its
enactment in 1946, however, it has been widely interpreted as creating, in
essence, a federal law of unfair competition. For example, it has been
applied to cases involving the infringement of unregistered marks, violations of trade dress and certain nonfunctional configurations of goods and
actionable false advertising claims." S. Rep. No. 100-515, p. 40 (1988).

19 "Trademark protection is important to both consumers and producers.

Trademark law protects the public by making consumers confident that
they can identify brands they prefer and can purchase those brands without being confused or misled. Trademark laws also protec[t] trademark
owners. When the owner of a trademark has spent conside[r]able time
and money bringing a product to the marketplace, trademark law protects
the producer from pirates and counterfeiters." Id., at 4.

has been established. Accordingly, I concur in the judgment, but not in the opinion, of the Court.

Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.
Both the Court and Justice Stevens decide today that
the principles that qualify a mark for registration under $ 2
of the Lanham Act apply as well to determining whether an
unregistered mark is entitled to protection under $ 43(a).
The Court terms that view "common ground," though it fails
to explain why that might be so, and Justice Stevens decides that the view among the Courts of Appeals is textually
insupportable, but worthy nonetheless of adherence. See
ante, at 768 (opinion of the Court); ante, at 781-782 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). I see no need in answering the question presented either to move back and forth
among the different sections of the Lanham Act or to adopt
what may or may not be a misconstruction of the statute for
reasons akin to stare decisis. I would rely, instead, on the
language of $ 43(a).

Section 43(a) made actionable (before being amended) "any
false description or representation, including words or other
symbols tending falsely to describe or represent," when
"use[d] in connection with any goods or services." 15
U. S. C. $ 1125(a) (1982 ed.). This language codified, among
other things, the related common-law torts of technical
trademark infringement and passing off, see Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456 U. S. 844, 861, n. 2

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
At common law, words or symbols that were arbitrary, fan-ciful, or suggestive (called "inherently distinctive" words or

symbols, or "trademarks") were presumed to represent thesource of a product, and the first user of a trademark could
sue to protect it without having to show that the word or
symbol represented the product's source in fact. See, e. g.,
Heublein v. Adams, 125 F. 782, 784 (CC Mass. 1903). That
presumption did not attach to personal or geographic namesor to words or symbols that only described a product (called

"trade names"), and the user of a personal or geographicname or of a descriptive word or symbol could obtain relief
only if he first showed that his trade name did in fact represent not just the product, but a producer (that the good or
service had developed "secondary meaning"). See, e. g.,
Florence Mfg. Co. v. J. C. Dowd & Co., 178 F. 73, 74-75 (CA2
1910). Trade dress, which consists not of words or symbols,
but of a product's packaging (or "image," more broadly),
seems at common law to have been thought incapable ever
of being inherently distinctive, perhaps on the theory that
the number of ways to package a product is finite. Thus, a
user of trade dress would always have had to show secondary
meaning in order to obtain protection. See, e. g., Crescent
Tool Co. v. Kilborn & Bishop Co., 247 F. 299, 300-301 (CA2
1917); Flagg Mfg. Co. v. Holway, 178 Mass. 83, 91, 59 N. E.
667 (1901); Philadelphia Novelty Mfg. Co. v. Rouss, 40 F.
585, 587 (CC SDNY 1889); see also J. Hopkins, Law of Trademarks, Tradenames and Unfair Competition $ 54, pp. 140-141
(3d ed. 1917); W. Browne, Law of Trade-Marks $$ 89b, 89c,
pp. 106-110 (2d ed. 1885); Restatement (Third) of the Law of
Unfair Competition $ 16, Comment b (Tent. Draft No. 2, Mar.
23, 1990) (hereinafter Third Restatement).

Over time, judges have come to conclude that packages or
images may be as arbitrary, fanciful, or suggestive as words
or symbols, their numbers limited only by the human imagination. See, e. g., AmBrit, Inc. v. Kraft, Inc., 812 F. 2d 1531,
1536 (CA11 1986) ("square size, bright coloring, pebbled tex505US3114D 07-09-96 12:05:25 PAGES OPINPGT

denied, 481 U. S. 1041 (1987); see also Third Restatement$$ 13, 16. A particular trade dress, then, is now considered
as fully capable as a particular trademark of serving as a"representation or designation" of source under $ 43(a). As
a result, the first user of an arbitrary package, like the firstuser of an arbitrary word, should be entitled to the presumption that his package represents him without having to showthat it does so in fact. This rule follows, in my view, from
the language of $ 43(a), and this rule applies under that sec-tion without regard to the rules that apply under the sections of the Lanham Act that deal with registration.Because the Court reaches the same conclusion for different reasons, I join its judgment.

appeal from the united states district court for thedistrict of massachusetts

No. 91-1502. Argued April 21, 1992--Decided June 26, 1992
The Constitution requires that the apportionment of Representatives be

determined by an "actual Enumeration" of persons "in each State," conducted every 10 years. Art. I, $ 2, cl. 3; Amdt. 14, $ 2. After the Secretary of Commerce takes the census in a form and content she determines, 13 U. S. C. $ 141(a), she reports the tabulation to the President,

$ 141(b). He, in turn, sends Congress a statement showing the number
of persons in each State, based on data from the "decennial census," and
he determines the number of Representatives to which each State will
be entitled. 2 U. S. C. $ 2a(a). For only the second time since 1900, the
Census Bureau (Bureau) allocated the Department of Defense's overseas
employees to particular States for reapportionment purposes in the 1990
census, using an allocation method that it determined most closely resembled "usual residence," its standard measure of state affiliation. Appellees Massachusetts and two of its registered voters filed an action
against, inter alios, the President and the Secretary of Commerce, alleging, among other things, that the decision to allocate federal overseas
employees is inconsistent with the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)
and the Constitution. In particular, they alleged that the allocation of
overseas military personnel resulted in the shift of a Representative
from Massachusetts to Washington State. The District Court, inter
alia, held that the Secretary's decision to allocate such employees to the
States was arbitrary and capricious under APA standards, directed the
Secretary to eliminate them from the apportionment count, and directed
the President to recalculate the number of Representatives and submit
the new calculation to Congress.

Held: The judgment is reversed.
785 F. Supp. 230, reversed.

Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court with respect
to Parts I, II, and IV, concluding that:

1. There was no "final agency action" reviewable under the APA.
Pp. 796-801.

(a) An agency action is "final" when an agency completes its decisionmaking process and the result of that process is one that will directly affect the parties. Here, the action that creates an entitlement

Syllabus
to a particular number of Representatives and has a direct effect on
the reapportionment is the President's statement to Congress. He is
not required to transmit the Secretary's report directly to Congress.
Rather, he uses the data from the "decennial census" in making his
statement, and, even after he receives the Secretary's report, he is not
prohibited from instructing the Secretary to reform the census. The
statutory structure here differs from those statutes under which an
agency action automatically triggers a course of action regardless of any
discretionary action taken by the President. Japan Whaling Assn. v.
American Cetacean Soc., 478 U. S. 221, distinguished. Contrary to appellees' argument, the President's action here is not ceremonial or ministerial. Apportionment is not foreordained by the time the Secretary
gives the President the report, and the fact that the final action is the
President's is important to the integrity of the process. Pp. 796-800.

(b) The President's actions are not reviewable under the APA. He
is not specifically included in the APA's purview, and respect for the
separation of powers and the President's unique constitutional position makes textual silence insufficient to subject him to its provisions.
Pp. 800-801.

2. The Secretary's allocation of overseas federal employees to their
home States is consistent with the constitutional language and goal of
equal representation. It is compatible with the standard of "usual residence," which was the gloss given the constitutional phrase "in each
State" by the first enumeration Act and which has been used by the
Bureau ever since to allocate persons to their home States. The phrase
may mean more than mere physical presence, and has been used to include some element of allegiance or enduring tie to a place. The first
enumeration Act also used "usual place of abode," "usual resident," and
"inhabitant" to describe the required tie. And "Inhabitant," in the related context of congressional residence qualifications, Art. I, $ 2, has
been interpreted to include persons occasionally absent for a considerable time on public or private business. "Usual residence" has continued to hold broad connotations up to the present day. The Secretary's
judgment does not hamper the underlying constitutional goal of equal
representation, but, assuming that overseas employees have retained
ties to their home States, actually promotes equality. Pp. 803-806.

Opinion of the Court
States for reapportionment purposes until 1970. App. 175,177. The 1970 census, taken during the Vietnam War, allocated members of the Armed Forces stationed overseas totheir "home of record," using Defense Department personnel
records. Id., at 179. "Home of record" is the State declared by the person upon entry into military service, anddetermines where he or she will be moved after military

service is complete. Id., at 149. Because the Bureau foundthat military personnel were likely to designate a "home of
record" with low or no income taxes instead of their truehome State--even though home of record does not determine
state taxation--the Bureau did not allocate overseas employees to particular States in the 1980 census. App. 180.

Initially, the Bureau took the position that overseas
federal employees would not be included in the 1990 state
enumerations either. There were, however, stirrings in
Congress in favor of including overseas federal employees,
especially overseas military, in the state population counts.
Several bills requiring the Secretary to include overseas military were introduced but not passed in the 100th and 101st
Congresses. See H. R. 3814, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. (1987);
H. R. 4234, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. (1988); H. R. 3815, 100th
Cong., 1st Sess. (1987); H. R. 4720, 100th Cong., 2d Sess.
(1988); S. 2103, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. (1988); H. R. 1468, 101st
Cong., 1st Sess. (1989); H. R. 2661, 101st Cong., 1st Sess.
(1989); H. R. 3016, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. (1989); S. 290, 101st
Cong., 1st Sess. (1989). In July 1989, nine months before
the census taking was to begin, then-Secretary of Commerce
Robert Mosbacher agreed to allocate overseas federal employees to their home States for purposes of congressional
apportionment. App. 182. His decision memorandum cites
both the growing congressional support for including overseas employees and the Department of Defense's belief that
"its employees should not be excluded from apportionment
counts because of temporary and involuntary residence overseas." Id., at 120. Another factor explaining the Secre505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:41 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
tary's shift was that the Department of Defense, the largestfederal overseas employer, planned to poll its employees to

determine, among other things, which State they consideredtheir permanent home.

Id., at 184. In December 1989,
however, the Defense Department canceled its plans to conduct the survey due to a lack of funds. Ibid. As an alter-native, the Defense Department suggested that it could provide data on its employees' last six months of residence inthe United States, information that would be more complete
and up-to-date than the home of record data already in thepersonnel files. This possibility also failed to materialize
when the Defense Department informed the Census Bureau
that it was not able to assemble the information after all.
Ibid.

In the meantime, two more bills were introduced in Congress, but not passed, which would have required the Census
Bureau to apportion members of the overseas military to
their home States using the "home of record" data already
in their personnel files. See H. R. 4903, 101st Cong., 2d
Sess. (1990); S. 2675, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. (1990). In July
1990, six months before the census count was due to be reported to the President, the Census Bureau decided to allocate the Department of Defense's overseas employees to the
States based on their "home of record." App. 185. It chose
the home of record designation over other data available,
including legal residence and last duty station, because home
of record most closely resembled the Census Bureau's standard measure of state affiliation--"usual residence." 3 Record 925. Legal residence was thought less accurate because
the choice of legal residence may have been affected by state
taxation. Indeed, the Congressional Research Service
found that in 1990 "the nine States with either no income
taxes, or those which tax only interest and dividend income,
have approximately 9 percent more of the overseas military
personnel claiming the States for tax purposes, than those
same States receive using home of record." Congressional

Opinion of the Court
Research Service Report, App. 151, n. 13. For similar reasons, last duty station was rejected because it would provide
only a work address, and the employee's last home address
might have been in a different State, as with those, for example, who worked in the District of Columbia but lived in
Virginia or Maryland. 3 Record 925. Residence at a "last
duty station" may also have been of a very short duration
and may not have reflected the more enduring tie of usual
residence. App. 150. Those military personnel for whom
home of record information was not available were allocated
based on legal residence or last duty station, in that order.
Id., at 186.

The Census Bureau invited 40 other federal agencies with
overseas employees to submit counts of their employees as
well. Of those, only 30 actually submitted counts, and only
20 agencies included dependents in their enumeration. Four
of the agencies could not provide a home State for all of their
overseas employees. Ibid.

Appellees challenged the decision to allocate federal overseas employees, and the method used to do so, as inconsistent
with the APA and with the constitutional requirement that
the apportionment of Representatives be determined by an
"actual Enumeration" of persons "in each State." U. S.
Const., Art. I, $ 2, cl. 3; U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, $ 2. Appellees focused their attack on the Secretary's decision to use
"home of record" data for military personnel. The District
Court, finding that it had jurisdiction to address the merits
of the claims, was "skeptical" of the merits of appellees' constitutional claims, speculating that "[t]here would appear
to be nothing inherently unconstitutional in a properly
supported decision to include overseas federal employees in
apportionment counts." Commonwealth v. Mosbacher, 785
F. Supp. 230, 266 (Mass. 1992). The District Court nonetheless held that, on the administrative record before it, the Secretary's decision to allocate the employees and to use home

Opinion of the Court
of record data was arbitrary and capricious under the stand-ards of the APA. Id., at 264-266.

II
Appellees raise claims under both the APA and the Consti-tution. We address first the statutory basis for our jurisdiction under the APA. See Blum v. Bacon, 457 U. S. 132, 137(1982); Burton v. United States, 196 U. S. 283, 295 (1905).

The APA sets forth the procedures by which federal agen-cies are accountable to the public and their actions subject
to review by the courts. The Secretary's report to the Pres-ident is an unusual candidate for "agency action" within the
meaning of the APA, because it is not promulgated to thepublic in the Federal Register, no official administrative record is generated, and its effect on reapportionment is feltonly after the President makes the necessary calculations
and reports the result to the Congress. Contrast 2 U. S. C.$ 441a(e) (requiring Secretary to publish each year in the
Federal Register an estimate of the voting age population).Only after the President reports to Congress do the States
have an entitlement to a particular number of Represen-tatives. See $ 2a(b) ("Each State shall be entitled . . . to
the number of Representatives shown in the [President's]statement").

The APA provides for judicial review of "final agency ac-tion for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court."
5 U. S. C. $ 704. At issue in this case is whether the "final"action that appellees have challenged is that of an "agency"
such that the federal courts may exercise their powers ofreview under the APA. We hold that the final action complained of is that of the President, and the President is not anagency within the meaning of the Act. Accordingly, there
is no final agency action that may be reviewed under theAPA standards.

To determine when an agency action is final, we havelooked to, among other things, whether its impact "is suffi505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:41 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ciently direct and immediate" and has a "direct effect on . . .day-to-day business."

Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387
U. S. 136, 152 (1967). An agency action is not final if it isonly "the ruling of a subordinate official," or "tentative."

Id., at 151. The core question is whether the agency has
completed its decisionmaking process, and whether the re-sult of that process is one that will directly affect the parties.

In this case, the action that creates an entitlement to a par-ticular number of Representatives and has a direct effect on
the reapportionment is the President's statement to Con-gress, not the Secretary's report to the President.

Unlike other statutes that expressly require the President
to transmit an agency's report directly to Congress, $ 2a does
not. Compare, e. g., 20 U. S. C. $ 1017(d) ("The President
shall transmit each such report [of the National Advisory
Council on Continuing Education] to the Congress with his
comments and recommendations"); 30 U. S. C. $ 1315(c) (similar language); 42 U. S. C. $ 3015(f) (similar language); 42
U. S. C. $ 6633(b)(2) (similar language). After receiving the
Secretary's report, the President is to "transmit to the Congress a statement showing the whole number of persons in
each State . . . as ascertained under the . . . decennial census
of the population." 2 U. S. C. $ 2a(a). Section 2a does not
expressly require the President to use the data in the Secretary's report, but, rather, the data from the "decennial census." There is no statute forbidding amendment of the "decennial census" itself after the Secretary submits the report
to the President. For potential litigants, therefore, the "decennial census" still presents a moving target, even after the
Secretary reports to the President. In this case, the Department of Commerce, in its press release issued the day
the Secretary submitted the report to the President, was
explicit that the data presented to the President was still
subject to correction. See United States Department of
Commerce News, Bureau of Census, 1990 Census Population
for the United States is 249,632,692: Reapportionment Will

to possible correction for undercount and overcount. TheUnited States Department of Commerce is considering
whether to correct these counts and will publish correctedcounts, if any, not later than July 15, 1991").

1 Moreover,

there is no statute that rules out an instruction by the Presi-dent to the Secretary to reform the census, even after the

data are submitted to him. It is not until the President sub-mits the information to Congress that the target stops moving, because only then are the States entitled by $ 2a to aparticular number of Representatives. Because the Secretary's report to the President carries no direct consequencesfor the reapportionment, it serves more like a tentative recommendation than a final and binding determination. It is,like "the ruling of a subordinate official," Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, supra, at 151, not final and therefore notsubject to review. Cf. Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc.
v. Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 109 (1948); UnitedStates v. George S. Bush & Co., 310 U. S. 371, 379 (1940).

The statutory structure in this case differs from that atissue in

Japan Whaling Assn. v. American Cetacean Soc.,478 U. S. 221 (1986), in which we held that the Secretary of

Commerce's certification to the President that another coun-try was endangering fisheries was "final agency action."
Id., at 231, n. 4. In that case, the Secretary's certification

1 Justice Stevens suggests that the "decennial census" is a single
count, determined solely by the Secretary, that is used for many purposes
other than reapportionment of Representatives. Therefore, he reasons,
it cannot be within the control of the President. However, the President
may be involved in the policymaking tasks of his Cabinet members,
whether or not his involvement is explicitly required by statute. The
question here is whether the census count is final before the President
acts. It seems clear that it is not. The tabulations used for purposes of
state redistricting, which include counts of persons in each state district,
are not required by statute to be completed until April 1, months after
the President's report to Congress. 13 U. S. C. $ 141(c).

U. S. C. $ 1821(e)(2)(B), regardless of any discretionary actionthe President himself decided to take.

Japan Whaling,
supra, at 226. Under 13 U. S. C. $ 141(a), by contrast, the
Secretary's report to the President has no direct effect onreapportionment until the President takes affirmative steps

to calculate and transmit the apportionment to Congress.Appellees claim that because the President exercises no
discretion in calculating the numbers of Representatives, his"role in the statutory scheme was intended to have no substantive content," and the final action is the Secretary's, not
the President's. Brief for Appellees 86. They cite the Senate Report for the bill that became 2 U. S. C. $ 2a, which
states that the President is to report "upon a problem in
mathematics which is standard, and for which rigid specifications are provided by Congress itself, and to which there
can be but one mathematical answer." S. Rep. No. 2, 71st
Cong., 1st Sess., at 4-5.

The admittedly ministerial nature of the apportionment
calculation itself does not answer the question whether the
apportionment is foreordained by the time the Secretary
gives her report to the President. To reiterate, $ 2a does
not curtail the President's authority to direct the Secretary
in making policy judgments that result in "the decennial census"; he is not expressly required to adhere to the policy
decisions reflected in the Secretary's report. Because it is
the President's personal transmittal of the report to Congress that settles the apportionment, until he acts there is
no determinate agency action to challenge. The President,
not the Secretary, takes the final action that affects the
States.

Indeed, it is clear that Congress thought it was important
to involve a constitutional officer in the apportionment process. Congress originally considered a bill requiring the
Secretary to report the apportionment calculation directly

505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:41 PAGES OPINPGT
800 FRANKLIN v. MASSACHUSETTS

Opinion of the Court
to Congress. See S. Rep. No. 1446, 70th Cong., 2d Sess., 4(1929). The bill was later amended to require the participation of the President: "Another objection to the previous billwas that the Secretary of Commerce should not be intrusted
with the final responsibility for making so important a report
to Congress. The new and pending bill recognizes this ob-jection to the extent that the President is substituted for the

Secretary of Commerce so that this function may be servedby a constitutional officer. This makes for greater permanence, which is one of the major virtues to be desired in sucha statute." S. Rep. No. 2,

supra, at 5. It is hard to imagine
a purpose for involving the President if he is to be prevented
from exercising his accustomed supervisory powers over his
executive officers. Certainly no purpose to alter the President's usual superintendent role is evident from the text of
the statute.

As enacted, 2 U. S. C. $ 2a provides that the Secretary cannot act alone; she must send her results to the President,
who makes the calculations and sends the final apportionment to Congress. That the final act is that of the President
is important to the integrity of the process and bolsters our
conclusion that his duties are not merely ceremonial or ministerial. Thus, we can only review the APA claims here if
the President, not the Secretary of Commerce, is an "agency"
within the meaning of the Act.

The APA defines "agency" as "each authority of the Government of the United States, whether or not it is within or
subject to review by another agency, but does not include--
(A) the Congress; (B) the courts of the United States; (C) the
governments of the territories or possessions of the United
States; (D) the government of the District of Columbia." 5
U. S. C. $$ 701(b)(1), 551(1). The President is not explicitly
excluded from the APA's purview, but he is not explicitly
included, either. Out of respect for the separation of powers
and the unique constitutional position of the President, we
find that textual silence is not enough to subject the Presi505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:42 PAGES OPINPGT

dent to the provisions of the APA. We would require an
express statement by Congress before assuming it intended
the President's performance of his statutory duties to be reviewed for abuse of discretion. Cf. Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457
U. S. 731, 748, n. 27 (1982) (Court would require an explicit
statement by Congress before assuming Congress had created a damages action against the President). As the APA
does not expressly allow review of the President's actions,
we must presume that his actions are not subject to its requirements. Although the President's actions may still be
reviewed for constitutionality, see Youngstown Sheet & Tube
Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579 (1952); Panama Refining Co. v.
Ryan, 293 U. S. 388 (1935), we hold that they are not reviewable for abuse of discretion under the APA, see Armstrong
v. Bush, 288 U. S. App. D. C. 38, 45, 924 F. 2d 282, 289 (1991).
The District Court erred in proceeding to determine the
merits of the APA claims.

III

Although the reapportionment determination is not subject to review under the standards of the APA, that does not
dispose of appellees' constitutional claims. See Webster v.
Doe, 486 U. S. 592, 603-605 (1988). Constitutional challenges to apportionment are justiciable. See Department of
Commerce v. Montana, 503 U. S. 442 (1992).

We first address standing.2 To invoke the constitutional
power of the federal courts to adjudicate a case or controversy under Article III, appellees here must allege and
prove an injury "fairly traceable to the [appellants'] allegedly
unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested
relief." Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751 (1984).

2 While appellants asserted below that the courts have no subjectmatter jurisdiction over this case because it involves a "political question,"
we recently rejected a similar argument in Department of Commerce v.
Montana, 503 U. S., at 456-459, and appellants now concede the issue.
Brief for Appellants 21.

802 FRANKLIN v. MASSACHUSETTS

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
To determine whether appellees sufficiently allege and
prove causation requires separating out appellees' claims:
Appellees claim both that the Secretary erred in deciding to
allocate overseas employees to various States and that the
Secretary erred in using inaccurate data to do so. Appellees
have shown that Massachusetts would have had an additional
Representative if overseas employees had not been allocated
at all. App. 183. They have neither alleged nor shown,
however, that Massachusetts would have had an additional
Representative if the allocation had been done using some
other source of "more accurate" data. Consequently, even if
appellees have standing to challenge the Secretary's decision
to allocate, they do not have standing to challenge the accuracy of the data used in making that allocation. We need,
then, review only the decision to include overseas federal
employees in the state population counts, not the Secretary's
choice of information sources.

The thornier standing question is whether the injury is
redressable by the relief sought. Tracking the statutory
progress of the census data from the Census Bureau, through
the President, and to the States, the District Court entered
an injunction against the Secretary of Commerce, the President, and the Clerk of the House. 785 F. Supp., at 268.
While injunctive relief against executive officials like the
Secretary of Commerce is within the courts' power, see
Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, supra, the District
Court's grant of injunctive relief against the President himself is extraordinary, and should have raised judicial eyebrows. We have left open the question whether the President might be subject to a judicial injunction requiring the
performance of a purely "ministerial" duty, Mississippi v.
Johnson, 4 Wall. 475, 498-499 (1867), and we have held that
the President may be subject to a subpoena to provide information relevant to an ongoing criminal prosecution, United
States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683 (1974), but in general "this

Opinion of the Court
court has no jurisdiction of a bill to enjoin the President in
the performance of his official duties." Mississippi v. Johnson, supra, at 501. At the threshold, the District Court
should have evaluated whether injunctive relief against the
President was available, and, if not, whether appellees' injuries were nonetheless redressable.

For purposes of establishing standing, however, we need
not decide whether injunctive relief against the President
was appropriate, because we conclude that the injury alleged
is likely to be redressed by declaratory relief against the
Secretary alone. See Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., 438 U. S. 59, 75, n. 20 (1978); Allen
v. Wright, supra, at 752. The Secretary certainly has an
interest in defending her policy determinations concerning
the census; even though she cannot herself change the reapportionment, she has an interest in litigating its accuracy.
And, as the Solicitor General has not contended to the contrary, we may assume it is substantially likely that the President and other executive and congressional officials would
abide by an authoritative interpretation of the census
statute and constitutional provision by the District Court,
even though they would not be directly bound by such a
determination.

IV

On the merits, appellees argue that the Secretary's allocation of overseas federal employees to the States violated the
command of Article I, $ 2, cl. 3, that the number of Representatives per State be determined by an "actual Enumeration" of "their respective Numbers," that is, a count of the
persons "in" each State. Appellees point out that the first
census conducted in 1790 required that persons be allocated
to their place of "usual residence." Brief for Appellees 77.
See Act of Mar. 1, 1790, $ 5, 1 Stat. 103. Because the interpretations of the Constitution by the First Congress are per505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:42 PAGES OPINPGT
804 FRANKLIN v. MASSACHUSETTS

Opinion of the Court
suasive, Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 723-724 (1986), ap-pellees argue that the Secretary should have allocated the

overseas employees to their overseas stations, because thosewere their usual residences.

The appellants respond, on the other hand, that the allocation of employees temporarily stationed overseas to theirhome States is fully compatible with the standard of "usual

residence" used in the early censuses. We review the dis-pute to the extent of determining whether the Secretary's
interpretation is consistent with the constitutional languageand the constitutional goal of equal representation. See

Department of Commerce v. Montana, 503 U. S., at 459.

"Usual residence" was the gloss given the constitutional
phrase "in each State" by the first enumeration Act and has
been used by the Census Bureau ever since to allocate persons to their home States. App. 173-174. The term can
mean more than mere physical presence, and has been used
broadly enough to include some element of allegiance or enduring tie to a place. The first enumeration Act itself provided that "every person occasionally absent at the time of
the enumeration [shall be counted] as belonging to that place
in which he usually resides in the United States." Act of
Mar. 1, 1790, $ 5, 1 Stat. 103. The Act placed no limit on
the duration of the absence, which, considering the modes of
transportation available at the time, may have been quite
lengthy. For example, during the 36-week enumeration period of the 1790 census, President George Washington spent
16 weeks traveling through the States, 15 weeks at the seat
of Government, and only 10 weeks at his home in Mount
Vernon. He was, however, counted as a resident of Virginia.
T. Clemence, Place of Abode, reproduced in App. 83.

The first enumeration Act uses other words as well to describe the required tie to the State: "usual place of abode,"
"inhabitant," "usual reside[nt]." Act of Mar. 1, 1790, $ 5, 1
Stat. 103. The first draft of Article I, $ 2, also used the word
"inhabitant," which was omitted by the Committee of Style

In the related context of congressional residence qualifi-cations, U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 2, James Madison interpreted

the constitutional term "inhabitant" to include "persons ab-sent occasionally for a considerable time on public or private
business." 2 Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention of1787, at 217. This understanding was applied in 1824, when
a question was raised about the residency qualifications ofwould-be Representative John Forsyth, of Georgia. Mr.
Forsyth had been living in Spain during his election, serving
as minister plenipotentiary from the United States. Hisqualification for office was challenged on the ground that he

was not "an inhabitant of the State in which he [was] chosen." U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 2, cl. 2. The House Committeeof Elections disagreed, reporting: "There is nothing in Mr.

Forsyth's case which disqualifies him from holding a seat inthis House. The capacity in which he acted, excludes the
idea that, by the performance of his duty abroad, he ceasedto be an inhabitant of the United States; and, if so, inasmuch
as he had no inhabitancy in any other part of the Union than
Georgia, he must be considered as in the same situation asbefore the acceptance of the appointment." M. Clarke &

D. Hall, Cases of Contested Elections in Congress 497-498(1834). Representative Bailey, supporting the qualification
of Mr. Forsyth, pointed out that if "the mere living in a placeconstituted inhabitancy," it would "exclude sitting members
of this House." Id., at 497 (emphasis deleted).Up to the present day, "usual residence" has continued to
hold broad connotations. For example, up until 1950, college

Legislature shall . . . regulate the number of representatives by the number of inhabitants." 2 M. Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention of

more familiar ring: "Representatives . . . shall be apportioned among the
several states . . . according to their respective numbers." Id., at 590.

D. C., area or in their home States. Id., at 218. Those persons who are institutionalized in out-of-state hospitals or
jails for short terms are also counted in their home States.
Id., at 225.

In this case, the Secretary of Commerce made a judgment,
consonant with, though not dictated by, the text and history
of the Constitution, that many federal employees temporarily stationed overseas had retained their ties to the States
and could and should be counted toward their States' representation in Congress: "Many, if not most, of these military
overseas consider themselves to be usual residents of the
United States, even though they are temporarily assigned
overseas." Id., at 120. The Secretary's judgment does not
hamper the underlying constitutional goal of equal representation, but, assuming that employees temporarily stationed
abroad have indeed retained their ties to their home States,
actually promotes equality. If some persons sharing in
Washington's fate had not been properly counted, the votes
of all those who reside in Washington State would not have
been weighted equally to votes of those who reside in other
States. Certainly, appellees have not demonstrated that
eliminating overseas employees entirely from the state
counts will make representation in Congress more equal.
Cf. Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U. S. 725, 730-731 (1983) (parties
challenging state apportionment legislation bear burden of
proving disparate representation). We conclude that appellees' constitutional challenge fails on the merits.

The District Court's judgment is

Reversed.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Blackmun, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Souter join, concurring inpart and concurring in the judgment.

In my opinion the census report prepared by the Secretaryof Commerce is "final agency action" subject to judicial
review under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5U. S. C. $ 701

et seq. I am persuaded, however, that the Sec-retary complied with the Census Act and with the Constitution in the preparation of the 1990 census and that, underthe standard of deference appropriate here, the Secretary's
actions were not arbitrary or capricious. I therefore agreethat the judgment of the District Court must be reversed.

During the decade after 1980 the population of Massachu-setts increased less rapidly than the population of the entire

Nation. In the apportionment following the 1990 census, itreceived only 10 of the 435 seats in the House of Representatives whereas formerly it had 11.In the District Court, appellees, who are the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and two of its registered voters,made two separate attacks on the process that reduced the
size of Massachusetts' congressional delegation. They chal-lenged the Secretary's conduct of the census, and they
challenged the method of apportioning congressional seatsbased on the census report. The District Court rejected
the challenge to the constitutionality of the method of appor-tionment prescribed in the Apportionment Act of 1941, 55
Stat. 761-762. Commonwealth v. Mosbacher, 785 F. Supp.230, 256 (Mass. 1992). That decision was consistent with the
analysis subsequently set forth in our opinion in Departmentof Commerce v. Montana, 503 U. S. 442 (1992), and is no
longer in dispute. Pursuant to the judicial review provi-sions of the APA, 5 U. S. C. $ 706(2), the District Court also
examined the decision of the Secretary of Commerce to in-clude overseas federal employees in the census count. The

court concluded that the Secretary's decision was "arbitrary
and capricious, and an abuse of discretion." 785 F. Supp.,
at 267.

In a rather surprising development, this Court reverses
because it concludes that the census report is not "final
agency action," 5 U. S. C. $ 704. The reason the Court gives
for this conclusion is that the President--who is not himself
a part of the agency that prepared the census and who has
no statutory responsibilities under the Census Act--might
revise that report in some way when he is performing his
responsibilities under an entirely separate statute, the Apportionment Act. The logic of the Court's opinion escapes
me, and apparently was not obvious to the Solicitor General,
for he advanced no such novel claim in his argument seeking
reversal. The Court's conclusion is erroneous for several
reasons.

Article I, $ 2, cl. 3, of the Constitution, as modified by the
Fourteenth Amendment, provides that Members of the
House of Representatives "shall be apportioned among the
several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State . . . ." To
ensure that the apportionment remains representative of the
current population, the Constitution further requires that a
census be taken at least every 10 years.1

Beginning in 1790, Congress fulfilled the constitutional
command by passing a Census Act every 10 years. Under
the early census statutes, marshals would transmit the collected information to the Secretary of State. The census
functions of the Secretary of State were transferred to the
Secretary of the Interior after that Department was estab1 "The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the
first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such manner as they shall by Law direct."

lished in 1849.2 A Census Office in the Department of the
Interior was established in 1899 and made permanent in
1902.3 A year later, the Census Office was moved to the
newly formed Department of Commerce and Labor.4

Following each census, Congress enacted a statute to reapportion the House of Representatives. After the 1920 census, however, Congress failed to pass a reapportionment Act.
This congressional deadlock provided the impetus for the
1929 Act that established a self-executing apportionment in
the case of congressional inaction. See S. Rep. No. 2, 71st
Cong., 1st Sess., 2-4 (1929). The bill produced an automatic
reapportionment through the application of a mathematical
formula to the census. The automatic connection between
the census and the reapportionment was the key innovation
of the Act.5

In its original version, the bill directed the Secretary of
Commerce to apply a mathematical formula to the census
figures and to transmit the resulting apportionment calculations to Congress. A later version made the President responsible for performing the mathematical computations and
reporting the result. From the legislative history, it is clear
that this change in the designated official was intended to
have no substantive significance.6 There is no indication

of Commerce, who was identified in the bill last February simply and

whatsoever of an intention to introduce a layer of Executivediscretion between the taking of the census and the application of the reapportionment formula. The intention wasexactly the contrary: to make the apportionment proceed
automatically based on the census.The statutory scheme creates an interlocking set of responsibilities for the Secretary and the President. The Sec-retary of Commerce is required to take a "decennial census
of population as of the first day of April of [every tenth] year,which date shall be known as the `decennial census date.' "
13 U. S. C. $ 141(a). The Secretary reports the collected in-formation to the President, see $ 141(b), who is directed to
"transmit to the Congress" a statement showing the popula-tion of each State "as ascertained under the seventeenth and
each subsequent decennial census . . . ." 2 U. S. C. $ 2a(a).The plain language of the statute demonstrates that the
President has no substantive role in the computation of thecensus. The Secretary takes the "decennial census," and
the President performs the apportionment calculations andtransmits the census figures and apportionment results to
Congress.In the face of this clear statutory mandate, the Court must
fall back on an argument based on statutory silence. TheCourt insists that there is no law

prohibiting the Presidentfrom changing the census figures after he receives them from

the Secretary. The Court asserts: "Section 2a does not ex-pressly require the President to use the data in the

Secre-tary's report, but, rather, the data from the `decennial census.' " Ante, at 797 (emphasis added). This statement isdifficult to comprehend, for it purports to contrast two terms
that the statute equates. The "decennial census" is thename the statute gives to the information collected by the

have quite no pride of opinion at that point and I think it makes quite no
difference, because everybody will get the same answer when we undertake to do that problem in arithmetic." 71 Cong. Rec. 1613 (1929).

Secretary and reported to the President. The Court's argu-ment cannot be harmonized with a statutory scheme that

directs the Secretary to take the "decennial census" and thePresident to report to Congress figures "as ascertained
under the . . . decennial census." This language cannot support the Court's view that the statute endows the Presidentwith discretion to modify the census results reported by

the Secretary.The legislative record, moreover, establishes that the
Executive involvement in the process is to be wholly min-isterial.

7 The question of the discretion allowed to the

President was discussed on the floor of the Senate, and thesponsor of the bill, Senator Vandenberg of Michigan, stated

unequivocally that the President exercised no discretionwhatsoever: "I believe as a matter of indisputable fact, that
function served by the President is as purely and completely
a ministerial function as any function on earth could be." 71
Cong. Rec. 1858 (1929).8 In a colloquy with other legisla7 The Senate Report, for example, states:
"The objection that this is an improper `delegation of power' to the
Department of Commerce (which takes the census) and to the President
(who reports the arithmetic) is answered by an examination of the facts.
No power whatever is delegated. The Department of Commerce counts
the people (as it always has done) and the President reports upon a problem in mathematics which is standard, and for which rigid specifications
are provided by Congress itself, and to which there can be but one mathematical answer." S. Rep. No. 2, 71st Cong., 1st Sess., 4-5 (1929).

8 At another point, Senator Vandenberg explained:

"The bill calls upon the President to report the result of a census to the
Congress. We have always depended upon somebody to report the result
of a census to us. The bill calls upon the President, when he reports the
result of the census, also to report the result of a problem in arithmetic.
If the President did not present the answer to that problem in arithmetic,
somebody else would have to do the problem in arithmetic, because no
matter what method is embraced for purposes of apportionment, there is
inevitably needed a formula which, like a chemical formula, may in itself
be somewhat inscrutable, and yet which always reaches the same conclusion." 71 Cong. Rec. 1613 (1929). The accuracy of Senator Vandenberg's

tors, Senator Vandenberg made clear that the bill did notallow the President to change the census figures he received:

"Mr. SWANSON: As I understand, the Senator fromMontana says, after reading the bill carefully, that the
President is bound and has no discretion under its terms;so that if there should be glaring frauds all over the
country he would be compelled to make the apportion-ment according to the census.

"Mr. WALSH of Montana: I should say so, becauseas I understand, he is not authorized to disregard any
numbers upon any ground."Mr. SWANSON: I should like to ask the Senator
from Michigan if that is his view? I understand theSenator from Montana to say that if the census returns
shall be shown to be reeking with frauds the Presidentwill have no power to correct them; that he must follow
the census returns as certified, regardless of the fraudthat may be involved. Is that the view of the Senator
from Michigan?. . . . .

"Mr. VANDENBERG: My answer is that the Senatorfrom Montana is entirely correct. There is absolutely
no discretion in name or nature reposed in the Presidentin connection with the administration of this proposed
act." Id., at 1845-1846.9
No President--indeed, no member of the ExecutiveBranch--has ever suggested that the statute authorizes the

President to modify the census figures when he performs the
statements is confirmed by the analysis set forth in our opinion in Department of Commerce v. Montana, 503 U. S., at 448-456.

9 An opponent of the bill, Senator Black, questioned whether the Act

might allow the President more than a ministerial role in the apportionment process. He considered such a possibility a recipe for tyranny. See

apportionment calculations. Nor did the Solicitor Generaladvance that argument in this litigation.

10 As a matter of

practice, the President has consistently and faithfully per-formed the ministerial duty described by Senator Vandenberg. The Court's suggestion today that the statute giveshim discretion to do otherwise is plainly incorrect.

11

10 While asserting that the President has authority to direct the Secretary's performance of the census, the Solicitor General acknowledged that
the statute does not authorize the President to deviate from the Secretary's report:

"MR. ROBERTS: The law directs [the President] to apply, of course, a
particular mathematical formula to the population figures he receives, but
I don't think there is a limit on his exercise of authority to direct the
Secretary of Commerce to conduct the census in a particular manner. It
would be unlawful, maybe not subject to judicial review, but unlawful just
to say, these are the figures, they are right, but I am going to submit a
different statement. But he can certainly direct the Secretary in the
conduct of the census.

"QUESTION: But would he have to remand it in effect to the Secretary
or could he say, well, I have had somebody over at the FBI making some
checks for me and they tell me there are really more people in Massachusetts, so I am going to give them extra seats.

"MR. ROBERTS: I think under the law he is supposed to base his calculation on the figures submitted by the Secretary." Tr. of Oral Arg. 12-13.

11 The Court confuses two duties of the President: (1) the general duty

to supervise the actions of the Secretary of Commerce, and (2) the statutory duty to transmit the census report and the apportionment calculations to Congress. This confusion is evident from the Court's statement,
"It is hard to imagine a purpose for involving the President if he is to be
prevented from exercising his accustomed supervisory powers over his
executive officers." Ante, at 800. It may be true that the statute does
not purport to limit the President's "accustomed supervisory powers" over
the Secretary of Commerce. The President would enjoy these "accustomed powers," however, whether or not he was responsible for transmitting the census and apportionment calculations to Congress. These "accustomed powers," therefore, cannot be relevant in deciding whether
agency action is final for the purposes of the APA, or else no action of an
Executive department would ever be final. The Court's argument then
depends on construing the statute to grant discretion to the President that

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Because the Census Act directs that the tabulation of the
total population by States shall be "reported by the Secretary to the President," the Court suggests that it is "like a
tentative recommendation" to the President, ante, at 798.
This suggestion is misleading because, unlike the typical
"tentative recommendation," the census report is a public
document. It is released to the public at the same time that
it is transmitted to the President.12 By law, the census report is distributed to federal and state agencies because it
provides the basis for the allocation of various benefits and
burdens among the States under a variety of federal programs. The Secretary also transmits the census figures directly to the States to assist them in redistricting. See 13
U. S. C. $ 141(c).

This wide distribution provides further evidence that the
statute does not contemplate the President's changing the
Secretary's report. If the President modified the census
figures after he received them from the Secretary, the Federal Government and the States would rely on different census results. The Secretary has made clear that the existence of varying "official" population figures is not acceptable.

he would not otherwise enjoy. Such additional grants of authority were
implicated in the cases on which the Court relies. See Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103 (1948); United
States v. George S. Bush & Co., 310 U. S. 371 (1940). The statutory
language here will not bear this interpretation. Moreover, whatever
purpose the Court wishes to "imagine" for the statute's designating the
President as the official responsible for performing the apportionment calculations, the legislative record makes it absolutely clear that the purpose
was not to give the President any new discretionary authority over the
census. See supra, at 810-812, and n. 6.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
In setting forth guidelines for possible adjustment of thecensus results,

13 the Secretary stated:

"The resulting counts must be of sufficient quality andlevel of detail to be usable for Congressional reapportionment and legislative redistricting, and for all otherpurposes and at all levels for which census counts are
published. . . .
"[T]here can be, for the population at all geographiclevels at any one point in time, only one set of official

government population figures." 55 Fed. Reg. 9840-9841 (1990).

To ensure uniformity, the Secretary's count must establishthe final census figures.

14

13 The Court asserts that the possibility of census adjustments prior to
the President's report to Congress supports its interpretation of the statute. See ante, at 797-798. On the contrary, the evidence the Court cites
undermines its argument. The President's statement accompanying the
transmittal of the 1990 census and apportionment figures to Congress explains, "The Department of Commerce is considering whether to correct
these counts and will publish corrected counts, if any, not later than July
15, 1991." H. R. Doc. No. 102-18, p. 1 (1991). The statement underscores
that it is the Secretary, not the President who determines the final census

figures. That the Secretary will "publish" the corrected results also demonstrates that the Court is mistaken in likening the Secretary's report to
a "tentative recommendation." Ante, at 798.

The possibility that the Secretary may modify the census figures, of
course, cannot support the Court's view that the President's intervention
deprives the Secretary's action of finality. The possibility of correction
would mean, at most, that appellees' challenge was not ripe until the Secretary's eventual announcement that he would not adjust the census. See
56 Fed. Reg. 33582 (1991). Similarly, even if it were the President's report to Congress that signaled the end of a census-adjustment process,
that would be relevant only in determining when a challenge is ripe, not
whether the Secretary's report is "final agency action."

14 Even in the Court's view, the Secretary's report of census information

to recipients other than the President would certainly constitute "final
agency action." The Court's decision thus appears to amount to a pleading requirement. To avoid the bar to APA review that the Court imposes

Opinion of Stevens, J.
In light of the statutory language, the legislative history,and the consistent Executive practice, the Court's conclusion

that the census report is not "final agency action" is as insup-portable as it is surprising.

15

III
In view of my conclusion that the census report preparedby the Secretary constitutes final agency action, I must consider the Secretary's contention that judicial review is notavailable because the conduct of the census is "committed to
agency discretion by law." 5 U. S. C. $ 701(a)(2).As we have frequently recognized, the "strong presumption that Congress intends judicial review of administrativeaction," see,

e. g., Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family
Physicians, 476 U. S. 667, 670 (1986), cannot be overcomewithout " `clear and convincing evidence' " of a contrary legislative intent, Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136,141 (1967) (quoting Rusk v. Cort, 369 U. S. 367, 380 (1962)).
No such evidence appears here.The current version of the statute provides that "[t]he Secretary shall . . . take a decennial census of population as ofthe first day of April . . . in such form and content as [s]he
may determine . . . ." 13 U. S. C. $ 141(a).16 The Secretary
today, litigants need only join their apportionment challenges to other
census-related claims. Notwithstanding the Court's novel reading of the
statute, in view of the Secretary's insistence on unitary census data, relief
on any census claim would yield relief on all other claims.

15 My conclusion that the Secretary's action was reviewable makes it

unnecessary for me to consider whether the President is an "agency"
within the meaning of the APA.

16 Moreover, this language appeared only recently in the statute. The

Act passed in 1929 stated: "That a census of population . . . shall be taken
by the Director of the Census in the year 1930 and every ten years thereafter." 46 Stat. 21. Before the 1976 amendment, the Act provided: "The
Secretary shall, in the year 1960 and every ten years thereafter, take a
census of population . . . ." 71 Stat. 483. It was not until 1976 that Congress added the language, "in such form and content as [s]he may determine." To the extent that the argument for unreviewability depends on

817Cite as: 505 U. S. 788 (1992)
Opinion of Stevens, J.
asserts that the discretion afforded by the statute is at leastas broad as that allowed the Director of Central Intelligence

in the statute we considered in Webster v. Doe, 486 U. S. 592(1988). That assertion cannot withstand scrutiny. The
statute at issue in Doe provided that "the Director of Central
Intelligence may, in his discretion, terminate the employ-ment of any officer or employee of the Agency whenever he

shall deem such termination necessary or advisable in theinterests of the United States . . . ." 50 U. S. C. $ 403(c). In
concluding that employment discharge decisions were com-mitted to agency discretion, we emphasized the language of
"deem . . . advisable," which we found to provide no meaning-ful standard of review. We also relied on the overall statutory structure of the National Security Act.

No language equivalent to "deem . . . advisable" exists inthe census statute. There is no indication that Congress intended the Secretary's own mental processes, rather than
other more objective factors, to provide the standard for
gauging the Secretary's exercise of discretion. Moreover, it

this phrase, it requires the conclusion that when Congress amended the
statute in 1976, it intended to effect a new, unreviewable commitment to
agency discretion. There is no support for this position whatsoever. The
main purpose of the 1976 amendment was to provide for a mid-decade
census to be used for various purposes (not including apportionment).
See S. Rep. No. 94-1256, pp. 2-3 (1976). The legislative history evidences
no intention to expand the scope of the Secretary's discretion.

The Senate Report on the new language in 13 U. S. C. $ 141(a) reads in
its entirety:

"Subsection (a) of section 141 essentially rewords the existing subsection, adding the term `decennial census of population' so as to distinguish
this census, to be taken in 1980 and every ten years thereafter, from the
mid-decade census, which is to be taken in 1985 and every ten years thereafter. New language is added at the end of the subsection to encourage
the use of sampling and surveys in the taking of the decennial census."
S. Rep. No. 94-1256, at 4.

Indeed, other portions of the Act limited the Secretary's authority by
requiring, if feasible, the use of sampling in the nonapportionment census.

818 FRANKLIN v. MASSACHUSETTS

Opinion of Stevens, J.
is difficult to imagine two statutory schemes more dissimilar
than the National Security Act and the Census Act. Though
they both relate to the gathering of information, the similarity ends there. Doe raises the possibility that, except for
constitutional claims, the Director of Central Intelligence
may enjoy unreviewable discretion to discharge employees.
This conclusion accords with the principle of judicial deference that pervades the area of national security. See, e. g.,
Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U. S. 518, 530 (1988); CIA
v. Sims, 471 U. S. 159, 180-181 (1985). While the operations
of a secret intelligence agency may provide an exception to
the norm of reviewability,17 the taking of the census does not.
The open nature of the census enterprise and the public dissemination of the information collected are closely connected
with our commitment to a democratic form of government.18
The reviewability of decisions relating to the conduct of the
census bolsters public confidence in the integrity of the process and helps strengthen this mainstay of our democracy.

More generally, the Court has limited the exception to judicial review provided by 5 U. S. C. $ 701(a)(2) to cases involving national security, such as Webster v. Doe and Department of Navy v. Egan, or those seeking review of refusal to
pursue enforcement actions, see Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U. S.

17 Indeed, it was asserted in Webster v. Doe, 486 U. S. 592 (1988), that
the statute should be construed to preclude review even of constitutional
claims. See id., at 605-606 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); id., at 621 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (describing Court's refusal
to preclude constitutional review as creating "the world's only secret intelligence agency that must litigate the dismissal of its agents").

tradition of publicity, of course, relates to the tabulated information. The
confidentiality of individual responses has long been assured by statute.

explained, the relationship of the census provision containedin 13 U. S. C. $ 141 and the apportionment provision contained in 2 U. S. C. $ 2a demonstrates that the Secretary's
discretion is constrained by the requirement that she
produce a tabulation of the "whole number of persons in each
State." 2 U. S. C. $ 2a(a).20 This statutory command also

19 The great weight of authority supports the view that the conduct of
the census is not "committed to agency discretion by law." See, e. g.,
Carey v. Klutznick, 637 F. 2d 834 (CA2 1980); New York v. United States
Dept. of Commerce, 739 F. Supp. 761 (EDNY 1990); New York v. United

20 The Census Act provides various other rules, as well, that limit the

Secretary's discretion. For example, the statute requires the Secretary
to take a decennial census of population "as of the first day of April" in
every 10th year. 13 U. S. C. $ 141(a). Thus, persons who die in February
or March, or who are not born until May or June, are not to be counted.
The fact that the statute gives the Secretary broad discretion with respect
to the "form and content" of the census surely does not mean that she
could lawfully count persons who predeceased the census date or who were

embodies a duty to conduct a census that is accurate and thatfairly accounts for the crucial representational rights that

depend on the census and the apportionment. The "usualresidence" policy that has guided the census since 1790 provides a further standard by which to evaluate the Secretary'sexercise of discretion. See generally

Heckler v. Chaney, 470U. S., at 836; Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States,

Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29,41-43 (1983); Padula v. Webster, 822 F. 2d 97, 100, 261 U. S.
App. D. C. 365, 368 (1987). The District Court was clearlycorrect in concluding that the statutory framework and the
long-held administrative tradition provide a judicially admin-istrable standard of review.

IV
For the reasons stated in Part IV of the Court's opinion, Iagree that the inclusion of overseas employees in state census totals does not violate the Constitution.22 I turn now to
born thereafter. Similarly, it would be plain error to count as Massachusetts residents a family that moved from New York to Boston on June 1.

21 Nothing in the language of the statute or in the overall statutory

scheme supports the Secretary's alternative argument that this is an
instance in which the relevant "statutes preclude judicial review." 5
U. S. C. $ 701(a)(1). In the absence of express statutory language, we
have generally reserved that exception for cases in which the existence of
an alternative review procedure provided "clear and convincing evidence,"
Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U. S. 667, 671
(1986) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted), of a legislative
intent to preclude judicial review. See, e. g., Department of Navy v.
Egan, 484 U. S. 518, 530-533 (1988); NLRB v. Food & Commercial Workers, 484 U. S. 112, 130-133 (1987); Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, 467 U. S. 340, 346-348 (1984). No such alternative scheme appears
here. The ability of Congress, itself, to resolve apportionment issues by
enacting new laws does not provide any evidence of an intent to preclude
judicial review.

22 I believe that appellees' challenge to the use of "home of record" data

also merits brief consideration.

The contention that overseas personnel may have little connection with
their "home of record" clearly has some force. A person designates a

Opinion of Stevens, J.
appellees' contention that the Secretary's decision to includeoverseas federal employees was arbitrary and capricious and

should have been set aside under the APA.With the exception of the census conducted in 1900, overseas federal employees were not included in state census to-tals before 1970.

23 In the census conducted in 1970, during

the Vietnam War, overseas military personnel were assignedto States for apportionment purposes based on the "home

of record" appearing in their personnel files.24 The Bureaureverted to its previous policy of excluding overseas employees from apportionment totals in the 1980 census. In ex-plaining this decision, one of the reasons cited by Bureau
officials was the "unknown reliability" of the data relied onto determine the "home State" of overseas personnel. App.
55. In discussions with the Bureau and in testimony beforeCongress, officials of the Defense Department agreed that
"home of record" data had a high "error rate" and mighthave little correlation with an employee's true feelings of
affiliation. See id., at 124, 183.In July 1989, then-Secretary Mosbacher decided to include
overseas employees in state population figures in the 1990
"home of record" when entering the service and is not permitted to change
it thereafter. See App. 147, n. 5. This information may therefore be
quite stale, implicating the constitutional requirements of accuracy and
decenniality.

The special problems of including overseas personnel in the census,
though, necessitate difficult judgments about the best data to use. In
view of the discretion available to the Secretary in formulating residence
rules, the adoption of the "home of record" principle cannot be said to
transgress any constitutional command. Accuracy in this context is
clearly a comparative concept, and appellees have not demonstrated that
the constitutional requirement of accuracy dictates a different method of
determining residence.

Like the District Court, I also conclude that the Secretary's decision did
not violate any specific provision of the Census Act. See 785 F. Supp., at
266, n. 31.

23 See App. 175-177.

census.25 The decision memorandum approved by the Sec-retary described several reasons for this conclusion, including "growing bipartisan concern of the Congress" and thebelief of the Defense Department that its employees should
be included in apportionment calculations because they considered themselves to be "usual residents" of the UnitedStates.

Id., at 120. The prospect of more accurate data
than previously available also contributed to the decision.The memorandum stated that the Defense Department's

plans to conduct an enumeration of its employees provided a"significant reason" for the decision.

Id., at 121; see also id.,
at 184. In December 1989, however, a lack of funds led theDefense Department to cancel the survey.

Ibid. The Secretary nevertheless adhered to the decision to include overseas personnel.In reaching the ultimate decision to allocate overseas federal employees to States, the Secretary had an obligation
to "examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory
explanation for [the] action including a `rational connection
between the facts found and the choice made.' " State
Farm, 463 U. S., at 43 (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc.
v. United States, 371 U. S. 156, 168 (1962)). The District
Court was properly concerned by the scant evidence that the
Secretary reconsidered the apportionment policy following
the cancellation of the Defense Department survey. If the
justification for the decision no longer obtained, the refusal
to reconsider would be quite capricious. The District Court
was certainly correct in concluding that "[i]nertia cannot
supply the necessary rationality" for the Secretary's decision. 785 F. Supp., at 265.

While the question is a close one, two factors in particular
lead me to conclude that the decision to include overseas employees ultimately rested on more than inertia. First, the
Secretary received assurances from the Defense Department

25 Id., at 182.

that, even without the survey, information on overseas per-sonnel would be "supplemented and improved," App. 161,

and would thus be more accurate than the data available inthe past. Moreover, while the anticipated Defense Department survey played an important role in the Secretary's ini-tial decision, other factors cited in the memorandum continued to support the Secretary's choice to include overseaspersonnel.

The record could be more robust. However, the basis forthe agency's decision need not appear with "ideal clarity,"
Bowman Transportation, Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight
System, Inc., 419 U. S. 281, 286 (1974), as long as it is reason-ably discernible. As the Court explains, see

ante, Part IV,the Secretary had discretion to include overseas personnel

in the census count. Although the hopes for more accuratedata were not fully realized, the record discloses that the
decision to include overseas personnel continued to besupported by valid considerations. I therefore conclude
that the decision of the Secretary was not arbitrary orcapricious.

26

For these reasons, I concur in the Court's judgment, butonly in Part IV of its opinion.

Justice Scalia, concurring in part and concurring in thejudgment.
I agree with the Court that appellees had no cause ofaction under the judicial-review provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. $ 701 et seq., and Itherefore join Parts I and II of its opinion.

Appellees have also challenged the constitutionality of theallocation methods used by the Secretary of Commerce in
conducting the census. The Court concludes that they have

methods of allocating overseas employees to States and that the choice of
"home of record" data was certainly not arbitrary or capricious. See, e. g.,

standing to assert these claims, but that the claims are mer-itless.

1 I disagree with the Court's conclusion on the standing question, and therefore do not reach the merits. Ourcases have established that there are three elements to the

"irreducible constitutional minimum of standing" requiredby Article III: (1) the plaintiffs must establish that they have
suffered "injury in fact"; (2) they must show causation be-tween the challenged action and the injury; and (3) they must
establish that it is likely that the injury will be redressed bya decision in their favor.

Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992). Appellees have clearly satisfied

the first two requirements, but I think they founder on thethird.

The plurality concludes that declaratory relief directed atthe Secretary alone would be sufficient to redress appellees'
injury. Ante, at 803. I do not agree. Ordering the Sec-retary to recalculate the final census totals will not redress
appellees' injury unless the President accepts the new num-bers, changes his calculations accordingly, and issues a new
reapportionment statement to Congress, and the Clerk ofthe House then submits new certificates to the States. 13
U. S. C. $ 141(b); 2 U. S. C. $ 2a. I agree that, in light of theClerk's purely ministerial role, we can properly assume that
insofar as his participation is concerned the sequence ofevents will occur. But as the Court correctly notes, ante, at
797-800, the President's role in the reapportionment processis

not purely ministerial; he is not "required to adhere to thepolicy decisions reflected in the Secretary's report," ante, at

799. I do not think that for purposes of the Article III re-dressability requirement we are ever entitled to assume, no
matter how objectively reasonable the assumption may be,that the President (or, for that matter, any official of the Ex1 Although only a plurality of the Court joins that portion of Justice
O'Connor's opinion which finds standing (Part III), I must conclude that
the Court finds standing since eight Justices join Part IV of the Court's
opinion discussing the merits of appellees' constitutional claims.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
ecutive or Legislative Branches), in performing a functionthat is not wholly ministerial, will follow the advice of a subordinate official. The decision is by Constitution or law con-ferred upon him, and I think we are precluded from saying
that it is, in practical effect, the decision of someone else.
Indeed, judicial inquiry into or speculation about the proba-bility of such "practical" subservience--never mind acting

upon the outcome of such inquiry or speculation--seems tome disrespectful of a coordinate branch. On such a theory
of redressability, suit would lie (assuming injury-in-fact couldbe shown) against the members of the President's Cabinet,
or even the members of his personal staff, for the almostsure-to-be-followed advice they give him in their respective
areas of expertise.

The plurality, however, has a different theory of redressability. In its view, it suffices that the "authoritative interpretation of the census statute and constitutional provision"
rendered by the District Court will induce the President to
submit a new reapportionment that is consistent with what
the District Court judgment orders the Secretary to submit.
Ante, at 803. It seems to me this bootstrap argument
eliminates, rather than resolves, the redressability question.
If courts may simply assume that everyone (including those
who are not proper parties to an action) will honor the legal
rationales that underlie their decrees, then redressability
will always exist. Redressability requires that the court be
able to afford relief through the exercise of its power, not
through the persuasive or even awe-inspiring effect of the
opinion explaining the exercise of its power. It is the
Court's judgment, in other words, its injunction to the
Secretary of Commerce, that must provide appellees
relief--not its accompanying excursus on the meaning of
the Constitution.

Though the Court does not rely upon it, the judgment
sought here did run against the President of the United
States. The District Court's order expressly required, not

505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:42 PAGES OPINPGT
826 FRANKLIN v. MASSACHUSETTS

Opinion of Scalia, J.
only that a new census tabulation be prepared, but also that
the President issue a new certification and that the Clerk of
the House forward the new apportionment to the 50 Governors. It is a commentary upon the level to which judicial
understanding--indeed, even judicial awareness--of the doctrine of separation of powers has fallen, that the District
Court entered this order against the President without
blinking an eye. I think it clear that no court has authority
to direct the President to take an official act.

We have long recognized that the scope of Presidential immunity from judicial process differs significantly from that of
Cabinet or inferior officers. Compare Nixon v. Fitzgerald,
457 U. S. 731, 750 (1982) ("The President's unique status
under the Constitution distinguishes him from other executive officials"), with Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 811,
n. 17 (1982) ("Suits against other officials--including Presidential aides--generally do not invoke separation-of-powers
considerations to the same extent as suits against the President himself "). Although we held in United States v.
Nixon, 418 U. S. 683 (1974), that the President is not absolutely immune from judicial process, see also United States
v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 30 (No. 14,692d) (CC Va. 1807) (Marshall,
C. J.) (upholding subpoena directed to President Jefferson),
the order upheld there merely required the President to provide information relevant to an ongoing criminal prosecution,
which is what any citizen might do; it did not require him
to exercise the "executive Power" in a judicially prescribed
fashion. We have similarly held that Members of Congress
can be subpoenaed as witnesses, see Gravel v. United States,
408 U. S. 606, 615 (1972), citing United States v. Cooper, 4
Dall. 341 (CC Pa. 1800) (Chase, J., sitting on Circuit), though
there is no doubt that we cannot direct them in the performance of their constitutionally prescribed duties, see Eastland
v. United States Servicemen's Fund, 421 U. S. 491 (1975) (refusing to enjoin the issuance of a congressional subpoena).

827Cite as: 505 U. S. 788 (1992)
Opinion of Scalia, J.
I am aware of only one instance in which we were specifi-cally asked to issue an injunction requiring the President

to take specified executive acts: to enjoin President AndrewJohnson from enforcing the Reconstruction Acts. As the
plurality notes, ante, at 802-803, we emphatically disclaimedthe authority to do so, stating that " `this court has no jurisdiction of a bill to enjoin the President in the performanceof his official duties.' "

Mississippi v. Johnson, 4 Wall. 475,501 (1867). See also C. Burdick, The Law of the American

Constitution $ 50, pp. 126-127 (1922); C. Pyle & R. Pious, ThePresident, Congress, and the Constitution 170 (1984) ("No
court has ever issued an injunction against the president
himself or held him in contempt of court"). The apparentlyunbroken historical tradition supports the view, which I

think implicit in the separation of powers established by theConstitution, that the principals in whom the executive and
legislative powers are ultimately vested--viz., the Presidentand the Congress (as opposed to their agents)--may not be
ordered to perform particular executive or legislative acts atthe behest of the Judiciary.

2

For similar reasons, I think we cannot issue a declaratoryjudgment against the President. It is incompatible with his

constitutional position that he be compelled personally to de-fend his executive actions before a court. Many of the reasons we gave in Nixon v. Fitzgerald, supra, for acknowledg-ing an absolute Presidential immunity from civil damages for
official acts apply with equal, if not greater, force to requests
for declaratory or injunctive relief in official-capacity suitsthat challenge the President's performance of executive functions: The President's immunity from such judicial relief is

2 In Mississippi v. Johnson, 4 Wall. 475 (1867), we left open the question
whether the President might be subject to a judicial injunction requiring
the performance of a purely "ministerial" duty, see id., at 498-499; cf.
Kendall v. United States ex rel. Stokes, 12 Pet. 524 (1838) (Postmaster
General); Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803) (Secretary of State).
As discussed earlier, the President's duty here was not that.

828 FRANKLIN v. MASSACHUSETTS

Opinion of Scalia, J.
"a functionally mandated incident of the President's unique
office, rooted in the constitutional tradition of the separation
of powers and supported by our history." Id., at 749; see
also id., at 749-757; id., at 760-764 (Burger, C. J., concurring).3 Permitting declaratory or injunctive relief against
the President personally would not only distract him from
his constitutional responsibility to "take Care that the Laws
be faithfully executed," U. S. Const., Art. II, $ 3, but, as more
and more disgruntled plaintiffs add his name to their complaints, would produce needless head-on confrontations between district judges and the Chief Executive. (If officialaction suits against the President had been contemplated,
surely they would have been placed within this Court's original jurisdiction.) It is noteworthy that in the last substantive section of Nixon v. Fitzgerald where we explain why
"[a] rule of absolute immunity for the President will not leave
the Nation without sufficient protection against misconduct
on the part of the Chief Executive," 457 U. S., at 757, because
of "[t]he existence of alternative remedies and deterrents,"
id., at 758, injunctive or declaratory relief against the President is not mentioned.

None of these conclusions, of course, in any way suggests
that Presidential action is unreviewable. Review of the legality of Presidential action can ordinarily be obtained in a
suit seeking to enjoin the officers who attempt to enforce the
President's directive, see, e. g., Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co.
v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579 (1952); Panama Refining Co. v.
Ryan, 293 U. S. 388 (1935)--just as unlawful legislative ac3 Although the relief granted in Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S. 486
(1969), was only declaratory, and although we reserved the question
whether coercive relief could properly be granted against the congressional officers, we discussed the issue of the form of relief only after having
concluded that the actions of these officers were not protected by legislative immunity, id., at 517-518. Accordingly, nothing in the case suggests
that declaratory relief may be awarded for actions protected by congressional (or Presidential) immunity.

tion can be reviewed, not by suing Members of Congress forthe performance of their legislative duties, see, e. g., Powell

v. McCormack, 395 U. S. 486, 503-506 (1969); Dombrowski v.Eastland, 387 U. S. 82 (1967); Kilbourn v. Thompson, 103
U. S. 168 (1881), but by enjoining those congressional (or ex-ecutive) agents who carry out Congress's directive. Unless
the other branches are to be entirely subordinated to theJudiciary, we cannot direct the President to take a specified
executive act or the Congress to perform particular legisla-tive duties.

In sum, we cannot remedy appellees' asserted injury with-out ordering declaratory or injunctive relief against appellant President Bush, and since we have no power to do that, Ibelieve appellees' constitutional claims should be dismissed.

4

Since I agree with the Court's conclusion that appellees' con-stitutional claims do not provide an alternative ground that

would support the judgment below, I concur in its judgmentreversing the District Court.

4 A contrary conclusion is not required by the fact that in Department
of Commerce v. Montana, 503 U. S. 442 (1992), we reached the merits of
a challenge to the President's use of the method of equal proportions in
calculating the reapportionment. " `[W]hen questions of jurisdiction have
been passed on in prior decisions sub silentio, this Court has never considered itself bound when a subsequent case finally brings the jurisdictional
issue before us.' " Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman,

Leafletting presents risks of congestion similar to thoseposed by solicitation. It presents, in addition, some risks

unique to leafletting. And of course, as with solicitation,these risks must be evaluated against a backdrop of the substantial congestion problem facing the Port Authority andwith an eye to the cumulative impact that will result if all
groups are permitted terminal access. Viewed in this light,I conclude that the distribution ban, no less than the solicitation ban, is reasonable. I therefore dissent from the Court'sholding striking the distribution ban.

I will not trouble to repeat in detail all that has beenstated in No. 91-155,

to avoid the delays generated by having literature foistedupon him than he does to avoid delays from a financial solicitation. And while a busy passenger perhaps may succeedin fending off a leafletter with minimal disruption to himself
by agreeing simply to take the proffered material, this doesnot completely ameliorate the dangers of congestion flowing
from such leafletting. Others may choose not simply to ac-cept the material but also to stop and engage the leafletter
in debate, obstructing those who follow. Moreover, thosewho accept material may often simply drop it on the floor
once out of the leafletter's range, creating an eyesore, asafety hazard, and additional cleanup work for airport staff.

prohibits solicitation, while giving the impression of permit-ting the Port Authority at least half of what it seeks, may in
fact prove for the Port Authority to be a much more Pyrrhicvictory. Under the regime that is today sustained, the Port
Authority is obliged to permit leafletting. But monitoringleafletting activity in order to ensure that it is

only leaflett-ing that occurs, and not also soliciting, may prove little less

burdensome than the monitoring that would be required ifsolicitation were permitted. At a minimum, therefore, I
think it remains open whether at some future date the PortAuthority may be able to reimpose a complete ban, having
developed evidence that enforcement of a differential banis overly burdensome. Until now it has had no reason or
means to do this, since it is only today that such a require-ment has been announced.

For the foregoing reasons, and for the reasons stated inthe opinion in No. 91-155, ante, p. 672, I respectfully dissent.

et al. v. CASEY, GOVERNOROF PENNSYLVANIA,

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 91-744. Argued April 22, 1992--Decided June 29, 1992*
At issue are five provisions of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of

1982: $ 3205, which requires that a woman seeking an abortion give her
informed consent prior to the procedure, and specifies that she be provided with certain information at least 24 hours before the abortion is
performed; $ 3206, which mandates the informed consent of one parent
for a minor to obtain an abortion, but provides a judicial bypass procedure; $ 3209, which commands that, unless certain exceptions apply, a
married woman seeking an abortion must sign a statement indicating
that she has notified her husband; $ 3203, which defines a "medical emergency" that will excuse compliance with the foregoing requirements;
and $$ 3207(b), 3214(a), and 3214(f), which impose certain reporting requirements on facilities providing abortion services. Before any of the
provisions took effect, the petitioners, five abortion clinics and a physician representing himself and a class of doctors who provide abortion
services, brought this suit seeking a declaratory judgment that each of
the provisions was unconstitutional on its face, as well as injunctive
relief. The District Court held all the provisions unconstitutional and
permanently enjoined their enforcement. The Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part, striking down the husband notification provision but upholding the others.

Held: The judgment in No. 91-902 is affirmed; the judgment in No. 91-744

is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded.

947 F. 2d 682: No. 91-902, affirmed; No. 91-744, affirmed in part, reversed

in part, and remanded.

Justice O'Connor, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and III, concluding that consideration of the fundamental constitutional question resolved by Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, principles of institutional integrity,
and the rule of stare decisis require that Roe's essential holding be re*Together with No. 91-902, Casey, Governor of Pennsylvania, et al. v.

tained and reaffirmed as to each of its three parts: (1) a recognition of
a woman's right to choose to have an abortion before fetal viability and
to obtain it without undue interference from the State, whose previability interests are not strong enough to support an abortion prohibition
or the imposition of substantial obstacles to the woman's effective right
to elect the procedure; (2) a confirmation of the State's power to restrict
abortions after viability, if the law contains exceptions for pregnancies
endangering a woman's life or health; and (3) the principle that the State
has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting
the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a
child. Pp. 844-869.

(a) A reexamination of the principles that define the woman's rights
and the State's authority regarding abortions is required by the doubt
this Court's subsequent decisions have cast upon the meaning and reach
of Roe's central holding, by the fact that The Chief Justice would
overrule Roe, and by the necessity that state and federal courts and
legislatures have adequate guidance on the subject. Pp. 844-845.

(b) Roe determined that a woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy is a "liberty" protected against state interference by the substantive component of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Neither the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of States at
the time of the Fourteenth Amendment's adoption marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of such "liberty." Rather, the adjudication
of substantive due process claims may require this Court to exercise its
reasoned judgment in determining the boundaries between the individual's liberty and the demands of organized society. The Court's decisions
have afforded constitutional protection to personal decisions relating to
marriage, see, e. g., Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, procreation, Skinner
v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S. 535, family relationships,
Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U. S. 158, child rearing and education,
Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510, and contraception, Griswold
v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479, and have recognized the right of the individual to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters
so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or
beget a child, Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438, 453. Roe's central
holding properly invoked the reasoning and tradition of these precedents. Pp. 846-853.

(c) Application of the doctrine of stare decisis confirms that Roe's essential holding should be reaffirmed. In reexamining that holding, the
Court's judgment is informed by a series of prudential and pragmatic
considerations designed to test the consistency of overruling the holding
with the ideal of the rule of law, and to gauge the respective costs of
reaffirming and overruling. Pp. 854-855.

835Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992)
Syllabus
(d) Although Roe has engendered opposition, it has in no sense proven
unworkable, representing as it does a simple limitation beyond which a
state law is unenforceable. P. 855.

(e) The Roe rule's limitation on state power could not be repudiated
without serious inequity to people who, for two decades of economic and
social developments, have organized intimate relationships and made
choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society,
in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception
should fail. The ability of women to participate equally in the economic
and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives. The Constitution serves human values,
and while the effect of reliance on Roe cannot be exactly measured,
neither can the certain costs of overruling Roe for people who have
ordered their thinking and living around that case be dismissed.
Pp. 855-856.

(f) No evolution of legal principle has left Roe's central rule a doctrinal anachronism discounted by society. If Roe is placed among the
cases exemplified by Griswold, supra, it is clearly in no jeopardy, since
subsequent constitutional developments have neither disturbed, nor do
they threaten to diminish, the liberty recognized in such cases. Similarly, if Roe is seen as stating a rule of personal autonomy and bodily
integrity, akin to cases recognizing limits on governmental power to
mandate medical treatment or to bar its rejection, this Court's post-Roe
decisions accord with Roe's view that a State's interest in the protection
of life falls short of justifying any plenary override of individual liberty
claims. See, e. g., Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S.
261, 278. Finally, if Roe is classified as sui generis, there clearly has
been no erosion of its central determination. It was expressly reaffirmed in Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462
U. S. 416 (Akron I), and Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747; and, in Webster v. Reproductive
Health Services, 492 U. S. 490, a majority either voted to reaffirm or
declined to address the constitutional validity of Roe's central holding.
Pp. 857-859.

(g) No change in Roe's factual underpinning has left its central holding obsolete, and none supports an argument for its overruling. Although subsequent maternal health care advances allow for later
abortions safe to the pregnant woman, and post-Roe neonatal care developments have advanced viability to a point somewhat earlier, these
facts go only to the scheme of time limits on the realization of competing
interests. Thus, any later divergences from the factual premises of
Roe have no bearing on the validity of its central holding, that viability marks the earliest point at which the State's interest in fetal

PA. v. CASEY

Syllabus

life is constitutionally adequate to justify a legislative ban on nontherapeutic abortions. The soundness or unsoundness of that constitutional
judgment in no sense turns on when viability occurs. Whenever it
may occur, its attainment will continue to serve as the critical fact.
P. 860.

(h) A comparison between Roe and two decisional lines of comparable
significance--the line identified with Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45,
and the line that began with Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537--confirms
the result reached here. Those lines were overruled--by, respectively,
West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379, and Brown v. Board of
Education, 347 U. S. 483--on the basis of facts, or an understanding of
facts, changed from those which furnished the claimed justifications for
the earlier constitutional resolutions. The overruling decisions were
comprehensible to the Nation, and defensible, as the Court's responses
to changed circumstances. In contrast, because neither the factual underpinnings of Roe's central holding nor this Court's understanding of
it has changed (and because no other indication of weakened precedent
has been shown), the Court could not pretend to be reexamining Roe
with any justification beyond a present doctrinal disposition to come
out differently from the Roe Court. That is an inadequate basis for
overruling a prior case. Pp. 861-864.

(i) Overruling Roe's central holding would not only reach an unjustifiable result under stare decisis principles, but would seriously weaken
the Court's capacity to exercise the judicial power and to function as the
Supreme Court of a Nation dedicated to the rule of law. Where the
Court acts to resolve the sort of unique, intensely divisive controversy
reflected in Roe, its decision has a dimension not present in normal cases
and is entitled to rare precedential force to counter the inevitable efforts
to overturn it and to thwart its implementation. Only the most convincing justification under accepted standards of precedent could suffice
to demonstrate that a later decision overruling the first was anything
but a surrender to political pressure and an unjustified repudiation of
the principle on which the Court staked its authority in the first instance. Moreover, the country's loss of confidence in the Judiciary
would be underscored by condemnation for the Court's failure to keep
faith with those who support the decision at a cost to themselves. A
decision to overrule Roe's essential holding under the existing circumstances would address error, if error there was, at the cost of both profound and unnecessary damage to the Court's legitimacy and to the Nation's commitment to the rule of law. Pp. 864-869.

Justice O'Connor, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Souter concluded in Part IV that an examination of Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, and

505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT

837Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992)
Syllabus
subsequent cases, reveals a number of guiding principles that should
control the assessment of the Pennsylvania statute:

(a) To protect the central right recognized by Roe while at the same
time accommodating the State's profound interest in potential life, see
id., at 162, the undue burden standard should be employed. An undue
burden exists, and therefore a provision of law is invalid, if its purpose
or effect is to place substantial obstacles in the path of a woman seeking
an abortion before the fetus attains viability.

(b) Roe's rigid trimester framework is rejected. To promote the
State's interest in potential life throughout pregnancy, the State may
take measures to ensure that the woman's choice is informed. Measures designed to advance this interest should not be invalidated if their
purpose is to persuade the woman to choose childbirth over abortion.
These measures must not be an undue burden on the right.

(c) As with any medical procedure, the State may enact regulations
to further the health or safety of a woman seeking an abortion, but may
not impose unnecessary health regulations that present a substantial
obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion.

(d) Adoption of the undue burden standard does not disturb Roe's
holding that regardless of whether exceptions are made for particular
circumstances, a State may not prohibit any woman from making the
ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy before viability.

(e) Roe's holding that "subsequent to viability, the State in promoting
its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate,
and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate
medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the
mother" is also reaffirmed. Id., at 164-165. Pp. 869-879.

Justice O'Connor, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts V-A and V-C, concluding that:

1. As construed by the Court of Appeals, $ 3203's medical emergency
definition is intended to assure that compliance with the State's abortion
regulations would not in any way pose a significant threat to a woman's
life or health, and thus does not violate the essential holding of Roe,
supra, at 164. Although the definition could be interpreted in an unconstitutional manner, this Court defers to lower federal court interpretations of state law unless they amount to "plain" error. Pp. 879-880.

2. Section 3209's husband notification provision constitutes an undue
burden and is therefore invalid. A significant number of women will
likely be prevented from obtaining an abortion just as surely as if Pennsylvania had outlawed the procedure entirely. The fact that $ 3209 may
affect fewer than one percent of women seeking abortions does not save
it from facial invalidity, since the proper focus of constitutional inquiry

Syllabus

is the group for whom the law is a restriction, not the group for whom
it is irrelevant. Furthermore, it cannot be claimed that the father's
interest in the fetus' welfare is equal to the mother's protected liberty,
since it is an inescapable biological fact that state regulation with respect to the fetus will have a far greater impact on the pregnant
woman's bodily integrity than it will on the husband. Section 3209 embodies a view of marriage consonant with the common-law status of
married women but repugnant to this Court's present understanding of
marriage and of the nature of the rights secured by the Constitution.
See Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, 69.
Pp. 887-898.

Justice O'Connor, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Souter, joined
by Justice Stevens, concluded in Part V-E that all of the statute's
recordkeeping and reporting requirements, except that relating to
spousal notice, are constitutional. The reporting provision relating to
the reasons a married woman has not notified her husband that she
intends to have an abortion must be invalidated because it places an
undue burden on a woman's choice. Pp. 900-901.

Justice O'Connor, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Souter concluded in Parts V-B and V-D that:

1. Section 3205's informed consent provision is not an undue burden
on a woman's constitutional right to decide to terminate a pregnancy.
To the extent Akron I, 462 U. S., at 444, and Thornburgh, 476 U. S., at
762, find a constitutional violation when the government requires, as it
does here, the giving of truthful, nonmisleading information about the
nature of the abortion procedure, the attendant health risks and those
of childbirth, and the "probable gestational age" of the fetus, those cases
are inconsistent with Roe's acknowledgment of an important interest in
potential life, and are overruled. Requiring that the woman be informed of the availability of information relating to the consequences to
the fetus does not interfere with a constitutional right of privacy between a pregnant woman and her physician, since the doctor-patient
relation is derivative of the woman's position, and does not underlie or
override the abortion right. Moreover, the physician's First Amendment rights not to speak are implicated only as part of the practice of
medicine, which is licensed and regulated by the State. There is no
evidence here that requiring a doctor to give the required information
would amount to a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion.
The premise behind Akron I 's invalidation of a waiting period between
the provision of the information deemed necessary to informed consent
and the performance of an abortion, 462 U. S., at 450, is also wrong.
Although $ 3205's 24-hour waiting period may make some abortions
more expensive and less convenient, it cannot be said that it is invalid

839Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992)

on the present record and in the context of this facial challenge.
Pp. 881-887.

2. Section 3206's one-parent consent requirement and judicial bypass
procedure are constitutional. See, e. g., Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U. S. 502, 510-519. Pp. 899-900.

Justice Blackmun concluded that application of the strict scrutiny
standard of review required by this Court's abortion precedents results
in the invalidation of all the challenged provisions in the Pennsylvania
statute, including the reporting requirements, and therefore concurred
in the judgment that the requirement that a pregnant woman report
her reasons for failing to provide spousal notice is unconstitutional.
Pp. 930, 934-936.

The Chief Justice, joined by Justice White, Justice Scalia, and
Justice Thomas, concluded that:

1. Although Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, is not directly implicated by
the Pennsylvania statute, which simply regulates and does not prohibit
abortion, a reexamination of the "fundamental right" Roe accorded to a
woman's decision to abort a fetus, with the concomitant requirement
that any state regulation of abortion survive "strict scrutiny," id., at
154-156, is warranted by the confusing and uncertain state of this
Court's post-Roe decisional law. A review of post-Roe cases demonstrates both that they have expanded upon Roe in imposing increasingly
greater restrictions on the States, see Thornburgh v. American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747, 783 (Burger, C. J.,
dissenting), and that the Court has become increasingly more divided,
none of the last three such decisions having commanded a majority opinion, see Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U. S. 502;
Hodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U. S. 417; Webster v. Reproductive Health
Services, 492 U. S. 490. This confusion and uncertainty complicated the
task of the Court of Appeals, which concluded that the "undue burden"
standard adopted by Justice O'Connor in Webster and Hodgson governs the present cases. Pp. 944-951.

2. The Roe Court reached too far when it analogized the right to
abort a fetus to the rights involved in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268
U. S. 510; Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390; Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S.
1; and Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479, and thereby deemed the
right to abortion to be "fundamental." None of these decisions endorsed an all-encompassing "right of privacy," as Roe, supra, at 152-153,
claimed. Because abortion involves the purposeful termination of potential life, the abortion decision must be recognized as sui generis,
different in kind from the rights protected in the earlier cases under the
rubric of personal or family privacy and autonomy. And the historical
traditions of the American people--as evidenced by the English common

840 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN

Syllabus

law and by the American abortion statutes in existence both at the time
of the Fourteenth Amendment's adoption and Roe's issuance--do not
support the view that the right to terminate one's pregnancy is "fundamental." Thus, enactments abridging that right need not be subjected
to strict scrutiny. Pp. 951-953.

3. The undue burden standard adopted by the joint opinion of Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter has no basis in constitutional
law and will not result in the sort of simple limitation, easily applied,
which the opinion anticipates. To evaluate abortion regulations under
that standard, judges will have to make the subjective, unguided determination whether the regulations place "substantial obstacles" in the
path of a woman seeking an abortion, undoubtedly engendering a variety of conflicting views. The standard presents nothing more workable
than the trimester framework the joint opinion discards, and will allow
the Court, under the guise of the Constitution, to continue to impart
its own preferences on the States in the form of a complex abortion
code. Pp. 964-966.

4. The correct analysis is that set forth by the plurality opinion in
Webster, supra: A woman's interest in having an abortion is a form of
liberty protected by the Due Process Clause, but States may regulate
abortion procedures in ways rationally related to a legitimate state interest. P. 966.

5. Section 3205's requirements are rationally related to the State's
legitimate interest in assuring that a woman's consent to an abortion
be fully informed. The requirement that a physician disclose certain
information about the abortion procedure and its risks and alternatives
is not a large burden and is clearly related to maternal health and the
State's interest in informed consent. In addition, a State may rationally decide that physicians are better qualified than counselors to impart
this information and answer questions about the abortion alternatives'
medical aspects. The requirement that information be provided about
the availability of paternal child support and state-funded alternatives
is also related to the State's informed consent interest and furthers the
State's interest in preserving unborn life. That such information might
create some uncertainty and persuade some women to forgo abortions
only demonstrates that it might make a difference and is therefore relevant to a woman's informed choice. In light of this plurality's rejection
of Roe's "fundamental right" approach to this subject, the Court's contrary holding in Thornburgh is not controlling here. For the same reason, this Court's previous holding invalidating a State's 24-hour mandatory waiting period should not be followed. The waiting period helps
ensure that a woman's decision to abort is a well-considered one, and
rationally furthers the State's legitimate interest in maternal health and

Syllabus
in unborn life. It may delay, but does not prohibit, abortions; and both
it and the informed consent provisions do not apply in medical emergencies. Pp. 966-970.

6. The statute's parental consent provision is entirely consistent with
this Court's previous decisions involving such requirements. See, e. g.,
Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v. Ashcroft, 462
U. S. 476. It is reasonably designed to further the State's important
and legitimate interest "in the welfare of its young citizens, whose immaturity, inexperience, and lack of judgment may sometimes impair
their ability to exercise their rights wisely." Hodgson, supra, at 444.
Pp. 970-971.

7. Section 3214(a)'s requirement that abortion facilities file a report on
each abortion is constitutional because it rationally furthers the State's
legitimate interests in advancing the state of medical knowledge concerning maternal health and prenatal life, in gathering statistical information with respect to patients, and in ensuring compliance with other
provisions of the Act, while keeping the reports completely confidential.
Public disclosure of other reports made by facilities receiving public
funds--those identifying the facilities and any parent, subsidiary, or affiliated organizations, $ 3207(b), and those revealing the total number of
abortions performed, broken down by trimester, $ 3214(f)--are rationally related to the State's legitimate interest in informing taxpayers as
to who is benefiting from public funds and what services the funds are
supporting; and records relating to the expenditure of public funds are
generally available to the public under Pennsylvania law. Pp. 976-977.

Justice Scalia, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice White, and
Justice Thomas, concluded that a woman's decision to abort her unborn
child is not a constitutionally protected "liberty" because (1) the Constitution says absolutely nothing about it, and (2) the longstanding traditions of American society have permitted it to be legally proscribed.
See, e. g., Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U. S. 502,
520 (Scalia, J., concurring). The Pennsylvania statute should be upheld in its entirety under the rational basis test. Pp. 979-981.

PA. v. CASEY

Opinion of the Court

V-C, and VI, an opinion with respect to Part V-E, in which
Justice Stevens joins, and an opinion with respect to Parts
IV, V-B, and V-D.

I

Liberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt. Yet
19 years after our holding that the Constitution protects a
woman's right to terminate her pregnancy in its early stages,
Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), that definition of liberty is
still questioned. Joining the respondents as amicus curiae,
the United States, as it has done in five other cases in the
last decade, again asks us to overrule Roe. See Brief for
Respondents 104-117; Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 8.

At issue in these cases are five provisions of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982, as amended in 1988
and 1989. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. $$ 3203-3220 (1990). Relevant
portions of the Act are set forth in the Appendix. Infra, at
902. The Act requires that a woman seeking an abortion
give her informed consent prior to the abortion procedure,
and specifies that she be provided with certain information
at least 24 hours before the abortion is performed. $ 3205.
For a minor to obtain an abortion, the Act requires the informed consent of one of her parents, but provides for a judicial bypass option if the minor does not wish to or cannot
obtain a parent's consent. $ 3206. Another provision of the
Act requires that, unless certain exceptions apply, a married
woman seeking an abortion must sign a statement indicating
that she has notified her husband of her intended abortion.

$ 3209. The Act exempts compliance with these three requirements in the event of a "medical emergency," which is
defined in $ 3203 of the Act. See $$ 3203, 3205(a), 3206(a),
3209(c). In addition to the above provisions regulating the
performance of abortions, the Act imposes certain reporting
requirements on facilities that provide abortion services.

$$ 3207(b), 3214(a), 3214(f).

Opinion of the Court
Before any of these provisions took effect, the petitioners,who are five abortion clinics and one physician representing

himself as well as a class of physicians who provide abortionservices, brought this suit seeking declaratory and injunctive
relief. Each provision was challenged as unconstitutional on
its face. The District Court entered a preliminary injunc-tion against the enforcement of the regulations, and, after a

3-day bench trial, held all the provisions at issue here uncon-stitutional, entering a permanent injunction against Pennsylvania's enforcement of them. 744 F. Supp. 1323 (ED Pa.1990). The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed
in part and reversed in part, upholding all of the regulations
except for the husband notification requirement. 947 F. 2d
682 (1991). We granted certiorari. 502 U. S. 1056 (1992).

The Court of Appeals found it necessary to follow an elaborate course of reasoning even to identify the first premise to
use to determine whether the statute enacted by Pennsylvania meets constitutional standards. See 947 F. 2d, at 687-
698. And at oral argument in this Court, the attorney for
the parties challenging the statute took the position that
none of the enactments can be upheld without overruling
Roe v. Wade. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5-6. We disagree with that
analysis; but we acknowledge that our decisions after Roe
cast doubt upon the meaning and reach of its holding. Further, The Chief Justice admits that he would overrule the
central holding of Roe and adopt the rational relationship
test as the sole criterion of constitutionality. See post, at
944, 966. State and federal courts as well as legislatures
throughout the Union must have guidance as they seek to
address this subject in conformance with the Constitution.
Given these premises, we find it imperative to review once
more the principles that define the rights of the woman and
the legitimate authority of the State respecting the termination of pregnancies by abortion procedures.

After considering the fundamental constitutional questions resolved by Roe, principles of institutional integrity,

PA. v. CASEY

Opinion of the Court

and the rule of stare decisis, we are led to conclude this: theessential holding of Roe v. Wade should be retained and once

again reaffirmed.It must be stated at the outset and with clarity that Roe's
essential holding, the holding we reaffirm, has three parts.First is a recognition of the right of the woman to choose to
have an abortion before viability and to obtain it withoutundue interference from the State. Before viability, the
State's interests are not strong enough to support a prohibi-tion of abortion or the imposition of a substantial obstacle to
the woman's effective right to elect the procedure. Secondis a confirmation of the State's power to restrict abortions
after fetal viability, if the law contains exceptions for preg-nancies which endanger the woman's life or health. And
third is the principle that the State has legitimate interestsfrom the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of
the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child.These principles do not contradict one another; and we adhere to each. II

Constitutional protection of the woman's decision to termi-nate her pregnancy derives from the Due Process Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment. It declares that no State shall"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due
process of law." The controlling word in the cases before usis "liberty." Although a literal reading of the Clause might
suggest that it governs only the procedures by which a Statemay deprive persons of liberty, for at least 105 years, since
Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623, 660-661 (1887), the Clausehas been understood to contain a substantive component as

well, one "barring certain government actions regardless ofthe fairness of the procedures used to implement them."
Daniels v. Williams, 474 U. S. 327, 331 (1986). As JusticeBrandeis ( joined by Justice Holmes) observed, "[d]espite arguments to the contrary which had seemed to me persuasive,it is settled that the due process clause of the Fourteenth

Opinion of the Court
Amendment applies to matters of substantive law as well asto matters of procedure. Thus all fundamental rights comprised within the term liberty are protected by the FederalConstitution from invasion by the States."

Whitney v.
California, 274 U. S. 357, 373 (1927) (concurring opinion).
"[T]he guaranties of due process, though having their rootsin Magna Carta's

`per legem terrae' and considered as procedural safeguards `against executive usurpation and tyranny,'have in this country `become bulwarks also against arbitrary

legislation.' " Poe v. Ullman, 367 U. S. 497, 541 (1961) (Har-lan, J., dissenting from dismissal on jurisdictional grounds)
(quoting Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516, 532 (1884)).

The most familiar of the substantive liberties protected by
the Fourteenth Amendment are those recognized by the Bill
of Rights. We have held that the Due Process Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates most of the Bill of
Rights against the States. See, e. g., Duncan v. Louisiana,
391 U. S. 145, 147-148 (1968). It is tempting, as a means of
curbing the discretion of federal judges, to suppose that liberty encompasses no more than those rights already guaranteed to the individual against federal interference by the
express provisions of the first eight Amendments to the
Constitution. See Adamson v. California, 332 U. S. 46,
68-92 (1947) (Black, J., dissenting). But of course this Court
has never accepted that view.

It is also tempting, for the same reason, to suppose that
the Due Process Clause protects only those practices, defined
at the most specific level, that were protected against government interference by other rules of law when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. See Michael H. v. Gerald
D., 491 U. S. 110, 127-128, n. 6 (1989) (opinion of Scalia, J.).
But such a view would be inconsistent with our law. It is a
promise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal
liberty which the government may not enter. We have vindicated this principle before. Marriage is mentioned nowhere in the Bill of Rights and interracial marriage was ille505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT

gal in most States in the 19th century, but the Court was nodoubt correct in finding it to be an aspect of liberty protected

against state interference by the substantive component ofthe Due Process Clause in Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 12
(1967) (relying, in an opinion for eight Justices, on the DueProcess Clause). Similar examples may be found in

Turnerv. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 94-99 (1987); in Carey v. Population

Services International, 431 U. S. 678, 684-686 (1977); inGriswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479, 481-482 (1965), as
well as in the separate opinions of a majority of the Membersof the Court in that case, id., at 486-488 (Goldberg, J., joined
by Warren, C. J., and Brennan, J., concurring) (expressly rely-ing on due process),

id., at 500-502 (Harlan, J., concurring injudgment) (same), id., at 502-507 (

White, J., concurring injudgment) (same); in
Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S.510, 534-535 (1925); and in Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390,

399-403 (1923).Neither the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of
States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amend-ment marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects. See U. S.Const., Amdt. 9. As the second Justice Harlan recognized:

"[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the DueProcess Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere providedin the Constitution. This `liberty' is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of prop-erty; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the
right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreason-able searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational
continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedomfrom all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints, . . . and which also recognizes, what areasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the stateneeds asserted to justify their abridgment." Poe v.

Ullman, supra, at 543 (opinion dissenting from dismissalon jurisdictional grounds).

Justice Harlan wrote these words in addressing an issue thefull Court did not reach in

Poe v. Ullman, but the Court
adopted his position four Terms later in Griswold v. Connecticut, supra. In Griswold, we held that the Constitution
does not permit a State to forbid a married couple to usecontraceptives. That same freedom was later guaranteed,

under the Equal Protection Clause, for unmarried couples.See

Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438 (1972). Constitutional
protection was extended to the sale and distribution of contraceptives in Carey v. Population Services International,
supra. It is settled now, as it was when the Court heard
arguments in Roe v. Wade, that the Constitution places limitson a State's right to interfere with a person's most basic decisions about family and parenthood, see Carey v. Population
Services International, supra; Moore v. East Cleveland, 431
U. S. 494 (1977); Eisenstadt v. Baird, supra; Loving v. Virginia, supra; Griswold v. Connecticut, supra; Skinner v.
Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S. 535 (1942); Pierce v.
Society of Sisters, supra; Meyer v. Nebraska, supra, as wellas bodily integrity, see,

e. g., Washington v. Harper, 494 U. S.
210, 221-222 (1990); Winston v. Lee, 470 U. S. 753 (1985);
Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165 (1952).

The inescapable fact is that adjudication of substantive dueprocess claims may call upon the Court in interpreting the

Constitution to exercise that same capacity which by tradi-tion courts always have exercised: reasoned judgment. Its
boundaries are not susceptible of expression as a simple rule.
That does not mean we are free to invalidate state policy
choices with which we disagree; yet neither does it permit
us to shrink from the duties of our office. As Justice Harlan observed:

"Due process has not been reduced to any formula; its
content cannot be determined by reference to any code.

PA. v. CASEY

Opinion of the Court

The best that can be said is that through the course ofthis Court's decisions it has represented the balance

which our Nation, built upon postulates of respect forthe liberty of the individual, has struck between that
liberty and the demands of organized society. If thesupplying of content to this Constitutional concept has
of necessity been a rational process, it certainly has notbeen one where judges have felt free to roam where unguided speculation might take them. The balance ofwhich I speak is the balance struck by this country, having regard to what history teaches are the traditionsfrom which it developed as well as the traditions from
which it broke. That tradition is a living thing. A de-cision of this Court which radically departs from it could
not long survive, while a decision which builds on whathas survived is likely to be sound. No formula could
serve as a substitute, in this area, for judgment and re-straint." Poe v. Ullman, 367 U. S., at 542 (opinion dissenting from dismissal on jurisdictional grounds).
See also Rochin v. California, supra, at 171-172 (Frank-furter, J., writing for the Court) ("To believe that this judicial

exercise of judgment could be avoided by freezing `due proc-ess of law' at some fixed stage of time or thought is to suggest that the most important aspect of constitutional adjudi-cation is a function for inanimate machines and not for
judges").Men and women of good conscience can disagree, and we
suppose some always shall disagree, about the profoundmoral and spiritual implications of terminating a pregnancy,
even in its earliest stage. Some of us as individuals findabortion offensive to our most basic principles of morality,
but that cannot control our decision. Our obligation is todefine the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.
The underlying constitutional issue is whether the State canresolve these philosophic questions in such a definitive way
that a woman lacks all choice in the matter, except perhaps

Opinion of the Court
in those rare circumstances in which the pregnancy is itself
a danger to her own life or health, or is the result of rape
or incest.

It is conventional constitutional doctrine that where reasonable people disagree the government can adopt one position or the other. See, e. g., Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U. S.
726 (1963); Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U. S.
483 (1955). That theorem, however, assumes a state of affairs in which the choice does not intrude upon a protected
liberty. Thus, while some people might disagree about
whether or not the flag should be saluted, or disagree about
the proposition that it may not be defiled, we have ruled that
a State may not compel or enforce one view or the other.
See West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624
(1943); Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397 (1989).

Our law affords constitutional protection to personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family
relationships, child rearing, and education. Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U. S., at 685. Our cases
recognize "the right of the individual, married or single, to
be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision
whether to bear or beget a child." Eisenstadt v. Baird,
supra, at 453 (emphasis in original). Our precedents "have
respected the private realm of family life which the state
cannot enter." Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U. S. 158, 166
(1944). These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central
to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty
protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. At the heart of
liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence,
of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human
life. Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of
the State.

PA. v. CASEY

Opinion of the Court

These considerations begin our analysis of the woman's interest in terminating her pregnancy but cannot end it, for
this reason: though the abortion decision may originate
within the zone of conscience and belief, it is more than a
philosophic exercise. Abortion is a unique act. It is an act
fraught with consequences for others: for the woman who
must live with the implications of her decision; for the persons who perform and assist in the procedure; for the spouse,
family, and society which must confront the knowledge that
these procedures exist, procedures some deem nothing short
of an act of violence against innocent human life; and, depending on one's beliefs, for the life or potential life that is
aborted. Though abortion is conduct, it does not follow that
the State is entitled to proscribe it in all instances. That is
because the liberty of the woman is at stake in a sense
unique to the human condition and so unique to the law.
The mother who carries a child to full term is subject to
anxieties, to physical constraints, to pain that only she must
bear. That these sacrifices have from the beginning of the
human race been endured by woman with a pride that ennobles her in the eyes of others and gives to the infant a bond
of love cannot alone be grounds for the State to insist she
make the sacrifice. Her suffering is too intimate and personal for the State to insist, without more, upon its own vision of the woman's role, however dominant that vision has
been in the course of our history and our culture. The destiny of the woman must be shaped to a large extent on her
own conception of her spiritual imperatives and her place
in society.

It should be recognized, moreover, that in some critical
respects the abortion decision is of the same character as the
decision to use contraception, to which Griswold v. Connecticut, Eisenstadt v. Baird, and Carey v. Population Services
International afford constitutional protection. We have no
doubt as to the correctness of those decisions. They support

505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT

853Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
the reasoning in Roe relating to the woman's liberty because
they involve personal decisions concerning not only the
meaning of procreation but also human responsibility and respect for it. As with abortion, reasonable people will have
differences of opinion about these matters. One view is
based on such reverence for the wonder of creation that any
pregnancy ought to be welcomed and carried to full term no
matter how difficult it will be to provide for the child and
ensure its well-being. Another is that the inability to provide for the nurture and care of the infant is a cruelty to the
child and an anguish to the parent. These are intimate
views with infinite variations, and their deep, personal character underlay our decisions in Griswold, Eisenstadt, and
Carey. The same concerns are present when the woman
confronts the reality that, perhaps despite her attempts to
avoid it, she has become pregnant.

It was this dimension of personal liberty that Roe sought
to protect, and its holding invoked the reasoning and the
tradition of the precedents we have discussed, granting protection to substantive liberties of the person. Roe was, of
course, an extension of those cases and, as the decision itself
indicated, the separate States could act in some degree to
further their own legitimate interests in protecting prenatal
life. The extent to which the legislatures of the States
might act to outweigh the interests of the woman in choosing
to terminate her pregnancy was a subject of debate both in
Roe itself and in decisions following it.

While we appreciate the weight of the arguments made on
behalf of the State in the cases before us, arguments which
in their ultimate formulation conclude that Roe should be
overruled, the reservations any of us may have in reaffirming the central holding of Roe are outweighed by the
explication of individual liberty we have given combined
with the force of stare decisis. We turn now to that
doctrine.

PA. v. CASEY

Opinion of the Court

III

A

The obligation to follow precedent begins with necessity,
and a contrary necessity marks its outer limit. With Cardozo, we recognize that no judicial system could do society's
work if it eyed each issue afresh in every case that raised it.
See B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 149
(1921). Indeed, the very concept of the rule of law underlying our own Constitution requires such continuity over time
that a respect for precedent is, by definition, indispensable.
See Powell, Stare Decisis and Judicial Restraint, 1991 Journal of Supreme Court History 13, 16. At the other extreme,
a different necessity would make itself felt if a prior judicial
ruling should come to be seen so clearly as error that its
enforcement was for that very reason doomed.

Even when the decision to overrule a prior case is not, as
in the rare, latter instance, virtually foreordained, it is common wisdom that the rule of stare decisis is not an "inexorable command," and certainly it is not such in every constitutional case, see Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S.
393, 405-411 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). See also
Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 842 (1991) (Souter, J.,
joined by Kennedy, J., concurring); Arizona v. Rumsey, 467
U. S. 203, 212 (1984). Rather, when this Court reexamines
a prior holding, its judgment is customarily informed by a
series of prudential and pragmatic considerations designed
to test the consistency of overruling a prior decision with
the ideal of the rule of law, and to gauge the respective costs
of reaffirming and overruling a prior case. Thus, for example, we may ask whether the rule has proven to be intolerable simply in defying practical workability, Swift & Co. v.
Wickham, 382 U. S. 111, 116 (1965); whether the rule is subject to a kind of reliance that would lend a special hardship
to the consequences of overruling and add inequity to the
cost of repudiation, e. g., United States v. Title Ins. & Trust

505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
Co., 265 U. S. 472, 486 (1924); whether related principles oflaw have so far developed as to have left the old rule no

more than a remnant of abandoned doctrine, see Pattersonv. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 173-174 (1989); or
whether facts have so changed, or come to be seen so differ-ently, as to have robbed the old rule of significant application
or justification, e. g., Burnet, supra, at 412 (Brandeis, J.,dissenting).

So in this case we may enquire whether Roe's central rulehas been found unworkable; whether the rule's limitation on
state power could be removed without serious inequity tothose who have relied upon it or significant damage to the
stability of the society governed by it; whether the law'sgrowth in the intervening years has left Roe's central rule a
doctrinal anachronism discounted by society; and whetherRoe's premises of fact have so far changed in the ensuing two
decades as to render its central holding somehow irrelevantor unjustifiable in dealing with the issue it addressed.

1
Although Roe has engendered opposition, it has in no senseproven "unworkable," see

Garcia v. San Antonio Metropoli-tan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 546 (1985), representing as it does a simple limitation beyond which a state lawis unenforceable. While Roe has, of course, required judicial
assessment of state laws affecting the exercise of the choiceguaranteed against government infringement, and although
the need for such review will remain as a consequence oftoday's decision, the required determinations fall within judicial competence. 2

The inquiry into reliance counts the cost of a rule's repudi-ation as it would fall on those who have relied reasonably on
the rule's continued application. Since the classic case forweighing reliance heavily in favor of following the earlier
rule occurs in the commercial context, see Payne v. Tennes505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT
856 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN

PA. v. CASEY

Opinion of the Court

see, supra, at 828, where advance planning of great precision
is most obviously a necessity, it is no cause for surprise that
some would find no reliance worthy of consideration in support of Roe.

While neither respondents nor their amici in so many
words deny that the abortion right invites some reliance
prior to its actual exercise, one can readily imagine an argument stressing the dissimilarity of this case to one involving
property or contract. Abortion is customarily chosen as an
unplanned response to the consequence of unplanned activity
or to the failure of conventional birth control, and except on
the assumption that no intercourse would have occurred but
for Roe's holding, such behavior may appear to justify no
reliance claim. Even if reliance could be claimed on that
unrealistic assumption, the argument might run, any reliance
interest would be de minimis. This argument would be
premised on the hypothesis that reproductive planning could
take virtually immediate account of any sudden restoration
of state authority to ban abortions.

To eliminate the issue of reliance that easily, however, one
would need to limit cognizable reliance to specific instances
of sexual activity. But to do this would be simply to refuse
to face the fact that for two decades of economic and social
developments, people have organized intimate relationships
and made choices that define their views of themselves and
their places in society, in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail. The ability
of women to participate equally in the economic and social
life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives. See, e. g., R. Petchesky, Abortion and Woman's Choice 109, 133, n. 7 (rev. ed. 1990). The
Constitution serves human values, and while the effect of
reliance on Roe cannot be exactly measured, neither can the
certain cost of overruling Roe for people who have ordered
their thinking and living around that case be dismissed.

3
No evolution of legal principle has left Roe's doctrinal foot-ings weaker than they were in 1973. No development of

constitutional law since the case was decided has implicitlyor explicitly left

Roe behind as a mere survivor of obsoleteconstitutional thinking.

It will be recognized, of course, that Roe stands at an in-tersection of two lines of decisions, but in whichever doctrinal category one reads the case, the result for present pur-poses will be the same. The

Roe Court itself placed itsholding in the succession of cases most prominently exemplified by Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965). SeeRoe, 410 U. S., at 152-153. When it is so seen, Roe is clearly
in no jeopardy, since subsequent constitutional developmentshave neither disturbed, nor do they threaten to diminish, the
scope of recognized protection accorded to the liberty relat-ing to intimate relationships, the family, and decisions about
whether or not to beget or bear a child. See, e. g., Carey v.
Population Services International, 431 U. S. 678 (1977);Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494 (1977).

Roe, however, may be seen not only as an exemplar ofGriswold liberty but as a rule (whether or not mistaken) of
personal autonomy and bodily integrity, with doctrinal affin-ity to cases recognizing limits on governmental power to
mandate medical treatment or to bar its rejection. If so,our cases since

Roe accord with Roe's view that a State'sinterest in the protection of life falls short of justifying any

plenary override of individual liberty claims. Cruzan v. Di-rector, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261, 278 (1990); cf., e. g.,
Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U. S. 127, 135 (1992); Washington v.
Harper, 494 U. S. 210 (1990); see also, e. g., Rochin v. Califor-nia, 342 U. S. 165 (1952); Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197

U. S. 11, 24-30 (1905).Finally, one could classify Roe as sui generis. If the case
is so viewed, then there clearly has been no erosion of itscentral determination. The original holding resting on the

Opinion of the Court

concurrence of seven Members of the Court in 1973 was expressly affirmed by a majority of six in 1983, see Akron v.
Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416
(Akron I), and by a majority of five in 1986, see Thornburgh
v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,
476 U. S. 747, expressing adherence to the constitutional
ruling despite legislative efforts in some States to test its
limits. More recently, in Webster v. Reproductive Health
Services, 492 U. S. 490 (1989), although two of the present
authors questioned the trimester framework in a way consistent with our judgment today, see id., at 518 (Rehnquist,
C. J., joined by White and Kennedy, JJ.); id., at 529
(O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), a majority of the Court either decided to reaffirm or
declined to address the constitutional validity of the central
holding of Roe. See Webster, 492 U. S., at 521 (Rehnquist,
C. J., joined by White and Kennedy, JJ.); id., at 525-526
(O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); id., at 537, 553 (Blackmun, J., joined by Brennan
and Marshall, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part);
id., at 561-563 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).

Nor will courts building upon Roe be likely to hand down
erroneous decisions as a consequence. Even on the assumption that the central holding of Roe was in error, that error
would go only to the strength of the state interest in fetal
protection, not to the recognition afforded by the Constitution to the woman's liberty. The latter aspect of the decision
fits comfortably within the framework of the Court's prior
decisions, including Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S. 535 (1942); Griswold, supra; Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967); and Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S.

438 (1972), the holdings of which are "not a series of isolated
points," but mark a "rational continuum." Poe v. Ullman,
367 U. S., at 543 (Harlan, J., dissenting). As we described in

859Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
Carey v. Population Services International, supra, the lib-erty which encompasses those decisions

"includes `the interest in independence in making cer-tain kinds of important decisions.' While the outer limits of this aspect of [protected liberty] have not beenmarked by the Court, it is clear that among the decisions
that an individual may make without unjustified gov-ernment interference are personal decisions `relating
to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relation-ships, and child rearing and education.' " 431 U. S., at
684-685 (citations omitted).
The soundness of this prong of the Roe analysis is apparent
from a consideration of the alternative. If indeed the wom-an's interest in deciding whether to bear and beget a child

had not been recognized as in Roe, the State might as readily
restrict a woman's right to choose to carry a pregnancy toterm as to terminate it, to further asserted state interests

in population control, or eugenics, for example. Yet Roe hasbeen sensibly relied upon to counter any such suggestions.
E. g., Arnold v. Board of Education of Escambia County,
Ala., 880 F. 2d 305, 311 (CA11 1989) (relying upon Roe and
concluding that government officials violate the Constitutionby coercing a minor to have an abortion);

Avery v. County of
Burke, 660 F. 2d 111, 115 (CA4 1981) (county agency inducing
teenage girl to undergo unwanted sterilization on the basisof misrepresentation that she had sickle cell trait); see also

In re Quinlan, 70 N. J. 10, 355 A. 2d 647 (relying on Roe infinding a right to terminate medical treatment), cert. denied
sub nom. Garger v. New Jersey, 429 U. S. 922 (1976)). In
any event, because Roe's scope is confined by the fact of its
concern with postconception potential life, a concern otherwise likely to be implicated only by some forms of contraception protected independently under Griswold and later
cases, any error in Roe is unlikely to have serious ramifications in future cases.

Opinion of the Court

We have seen how time has overtaken some of Roe's fac-tual assumptions: advances in maternal health care allow for

abortions safe to the mother later in pregnancy than wastrue in 1973, see

Akron I, supra, at 429, n. 11, and advancesin neonatal care have advanced viability to a point somewhat

earlier. Compare Roe, 410 U. S., at 160, with Webster,
supra, at 515-516 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.); see AkronI, 462 U. S., at 457, and n. 5 (

O'Connor, J., dissenting). Butthese facts go only to the scheme of time limits on the realization of competing interests, and the divergences from thefactual premises of 1973 have no bearing on the validity of
Roe's central holding, that viability marks the earliest pointat which the State's interest in fetal life is constitutionally
adequate to justify a legislative ban on nontherapeutic abor-tions. The soundness or unsoundness of that constitutional
judgment in no sense turns on whether viability occurs atapproximately 28 weeks, as was usual at the time of Roe, at
23 to 24 weeks, as it sometimes does today, or at some mo-ment even slightly earlier in pregnancy, as it may if fetal
respiratory capacity can somehow be enhanced in the future.Whenever it may occur, the attainment of viability may continue to serve as the critical fact, just as it has done since
Roe was decided; which is to say that no change in Roe'sfactual underpinning has left its central holding obsolete, and

none supports an argument for overruling it.

5
The sum of the precedential enquiry to this point shows
Roe's underpinnings unweakened in any way affecting itscentral holding. While it has engendered disapproval, it has

not been unworkable. An entire generation has come of agefree to assume

Roe's concept of liberty in defining the capac-ity of women to act in society, and to make reproductive decisions; no erosion of principle going to liberty or personal au-tonomy has left Roe's central holding a doctrinal remnant;

505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT

861Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
Roe portends no developments at odds with other precedentfor the analysis of personal liberty; and no changes of fact

have rendered viability more or less appropriate as the pointat which the balance of interests tips. Within the bounds of
normal stare decisis analysis, then, and subject to the consid-erations on which it customarily turns, the stronger argument is for affirming Roe's central holding, with whateverdegree of personal reluctance any of us may have, not for
overruling it. B

In a less significant case, stare decisis analysis could, andwould, stop at the point we have reached. But the sustained
and widespread debate Roe has provoked calls for some com-parison between that case and others of comparable dimension that have responded to national controversies and takenon the impress of the controversies addressed. Only two
such decisional lines from the past century present them-selves for examination, and in each instance the result
reached by the Court accorded with the principles we applytoday.

The first example is that line of cases identified withLochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905), which imposed substantive limitations on legislation limiting economic auton-omy in favor of health and welfare regulation, adopting, in
Justice Holmes's view, the theory of laissez-faire. Id., at 75(dissenting opinion). The

Lochner decisions were exempli-fied by Adkins v. Children's Hospital of District of Columbia, 261 U. S. 525 (1923), in which this Court held it to be aninfringement of constitutionally protected liberty of contract
to require the employers of adult women to satisfy minimumwage standards. Fourteen years later,

West Coast Hotel Co.v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937), signaled the demise of

Lochner by overruling Adkins. In the meantime, the De-pression had come and, with it, the lesson that seemed unmistakable to most people by 1937, that the interpretation ofcontractual freedom protected in Adkins rested on funda505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT
862 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN

PA. v. CASEY

Opinion of the Court

mentally false factual assumptions about the capacity of arelatively unregulated market to satisfy minimal levels of

human welfare. See West Coast Hotel Co., supra, at 399.As Justice Jackson wrote of the constitutional crisis of 1937
shortly before he came on the bench: "The older world of
laissez faire was recognized everywhere outside the Courtto be dead." The Struggle for Judicial Supremacy 85 (1941).

The facts upon which the earlier case had premised a consti-tutional resolution of social controversy had proven to be untrue, and history's demonstration of their untruth not onlyjustified but required the new choice of constitutional principle that West Coast Hotel announced. Of course, it was true
that the Court lost something by its misperception, or its
lack of prescience, and the Court-packing crisis only magnified the loss; but the clear demonstration that the facts of
economic life were different from those previously assumed
warranted the repudiation of the old law.

The second comparison that 20th century history invites
is with the cases employing the separate-but-equal rule
for applying the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection
guarantee. They began with Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S.
537 (1896), holding that legislatively mandated racial segregation in public transportation works no denial of equal protection, rejecting the argument that racial separation enforced by the legal machinery of American society treats the
black race as inferior. The Plessy Court considered "the
underlying fallacy of the plaintiff 's argument to consist in
the assumption that the enforced separation of the two races
stamps the colored race with a badge of inferiority. If this
be so, it is not by reason of anything found in the act, but
solely because the colored race chooses to put that construction upon it." Id., at 551. Whether, as a matter of historical fact, the Justices in the Plessy majority believed this or
not, see id., at 557, 562 (Harlan, J., dissenting), this understanding of the implication of segregation was the stated justification for the Court's opinion. But this understanding of

505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT

863Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
the facts and the rule it was stated to justify were repudi-ated in

Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954)
(Brown I). As one commentator observed, the question be-fore the Court in

Brown was "whether discrimination inheres in that segregation which is imposed by law in the
twentieth century in certain specific states in the AmericanUnion. And that question has meaning and can find an answer only on the ground of history and of common knowledgeabout the facts of life in the times and places aforesaid."
Black, The Lawfulness of the Segregation Decisions, 69 YaleL. J. 421, 427 (1960).

The Court in Brown addressed these facts of life by observing that whatever may have been the understanding in
Plessy's time of the power of segregation to stigmatize
those who were segregated with a "badge of inferiority," it
was clear by 1954 that legally sanctioned segregation had
just such an effect, to the point that racially separate public
educational facilities were deemed inherently unequal. 347
U. S., at 494-495. Society's understanding of the facts upon
which a constitutional ruling was sought in 1954 was thus
fundamentally different from the basis claimed for the decision in 1896. While we think Plessy was wrong the day it
was decided, see Plessy, supra, at 552-564 (Harlan, J., dissenting), we must also recognize that the Plessy Court's explanation for its decision was so clearly at odds with the facts
apparent to the Court in 1954 that the decision to reexamine
Plessy was on this ground alone not only justified but
required.

West Coast Hotel and Brown each rested on facts, or an
understanding of facts, changed from those which furnished
the claimed justifications for the earlier constitutional resolutions. Each case was comprehensible as the Court's response to facts that the country could understand, or had
come to understand already, but which the Court of an earlier day, as its own declarations disclosed, had not been able
to perceive. As the decisions were thus comprehensible

Opinion of the Court

they were also defensible, not merely as the victories of onedoctrinal school over another by dint of numbers (victories

though they were), but as applications of constitutional prin-ciple to facts as they had not been seen by the Court before.
In constitutional adjudication as elsewhere in life, changedcircumstances may impose new obligations, and the thoughtful part of the Nation could accept each decision to overrulea prior case as a response to the Court's constitutional duty.

Because the cases before us present no such occasion itcould be seen as no such response. Because neither the factual underpinnings of Roe's central holding nor our under-standing of it has changed (and because no other indication
of weakened precedent has been shown), the Court could notpretend to be reexamining the prior law with any justification beyond a present doctrinal disposition to come out dif-ferently from the Court of 1973. To overrule prior law for
no other reason than that would run counter to the viewrepeated in our cases, that a decision to overrule should rest
on some special reason over and above the belief that a priorcase was wrongly decided. See

, e. g., Mitchell v. W. T. GrantCo., 416 U. S. 600, 636 (1974) (Stewart, J., dissenting) ("A

basic change in the law upon a ground no firmer than achange in our membership invites the popular misconception
that this institution is little different from the two politicalbranches of the Government. No misconception could do
more lasting injury to this Court and to the system of lawwhich it is our abiding mission to serve");

Mapp v. Ohio, 367U. S. 643, 677 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting).

C
The examination of the conditions justifying the repudia-tion of Adkins by West Coast Hotel and Plessy by Brown is

enough to suggest the terrible price that would have beenpaid if the Court had not overruled as it did. In the present
cases, however, as our analysis to this point makes clear, theterrible price would be paid for overruling. Our analysis

Opinion of the Court
would not be complete, however, without explaining whyoverruling

Roe's central holding would not only reach an unjustifiable result under principles of stare decisis, but wouldseriously weaken the Court's capacity to exercise the judicial

power and to function as the Supreme Court of a Nation
dedicated to the rule of law. To understand why this wouldbe so it is necessary to understand the source of this Court's

authority, the conditions necessary for its preservation, andits relationship to the country's understanding of itself as a
constitutional Republic.The root of American governmental power is revealed
most clearly in the instance of the power conferred by the
Constitution upon the Judiciary of the United States and specifically upon this Court. As Americans of each succeeding
generation are rightly told, the Court cannot buy support for
its decisions by spending money and, except to a minor degree, it cannot independently coerce obedience to its decrees.
The Court's power lies, rather, in its legitimacy, a product of
substance and perception that shows itself in the people's
acceptance of the Judiciary as fit to determine what the Nation's law means and to declare what it demands.

The underlying substance of this legitimacy is of course
the warrant for the Court's decisions in the Constitution and
the lesser sources of legal principle on which the Court
draws. That substance is expressed in the Court's opinions,
and our contemporary understanding is such that a decision
without principled justification would be no judicial act at

all. But even when justification is furnished by apposite
legal principle, something more is required. Because not
every conscientious claim of principled justification will be
accepted as such, the justification claimed must be beyond
dispute. The Court must take care to speak and act in ways
that allow people to accept its decisions on the terms the
Court claims for them, as grounded truly in principle, not as
compromises with social and political pressures having, as
such, no bearing on the principled choices that the Court is

Opinion of the Court

obliged to make. Thus, the Court's legitimacy depends onmaking legally principled decisions under circumstances in

which their principled character is sufficiently plausible to beaccepted by the Nation.

The need for principled action to be perceived as such is
implicated to some degree whenever this, or any other appel-late court, overrules a prior case. This is not to say, of

course, that this Court cannot give a perfectly satisfactoryexplanation in most cases. People understand that some of
the Constitution's language is hard to fathom and that theCourt's Justices are sometimes able to perceive significant
facts or to understand principles of law that eluded their
predecessors and that justify departures from existing decisions. However upsetting it may be to those most directly
affected when one judicially derived rule replaces another,
the country can accept some correction of error without necessarily questioning the legitimacy of the Court.

In two circumstances, however, the Court would almost
certainly fail to receive the benefit of the doubt in overruling
prior cases. There is, first, a point beyond which frequent
overruling would overtax the country's belief in the Court's
good faith. Despite the variety of reasons that may inform
and justify a decision to overrule, we cannot forget that such
a decision is usually perceived (and perceived correctly) as,
at the least, a statement that a prior decision was wrong.
There is a limit to the amount of error that can plausibly be
imputed to prior Courts. If that limit should be exceeded,
disturbance of prior rulings would be taken as evidence that
justifiable reexamination of principle had given way to drives
for particular results in the short term. The legitimacy of
the Court would fade with the frequency of its vacillation.

That first circumstance can be described as hypothetical;
the second is to the point here and now. Where, in the performance of its judicial duties, the Court decides a case in
such a way as to resolve the sort of intensely divisive controversy reflected in Roe and those rare, comparable cases, its

505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT

867Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
decision has a dimension that the resolution of the normalcase does not carry. It is the dimension present whenever

the Court's interpretation of the Constitution calls the con-tending sides of a national controversy to end their national
division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the
Constitution.The Court is not asked to do this very often, having thus

addressed the Nation only twice in our lifetime, in the deci-sions of

Brown and Roe. But when the Court does act in
this way, its decision requires an equally rare precedentialforce to counter the inevitable efforts to overturn it and to

thwart its implementation. Some of those efforts may be
mere unprincipled emotional reactions; others may proceed
from principles worthy of profound respect. But whatever
the premises of opposition may be, only the most convincing
justification under accepted standards of precedent could suffice to demonstrate that a later decision overruling the first
was anything but a surrender to political pressure, and an
unjustified repudiation of the principle on which the Court
staked its authority in the first instance. So to overrule
under fire in the absence of the most compelling reason to
reexamine a watershed decision would subvert the Court's
legitimacy beyond any serious question. Cf. Brown v.
Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294, 300 (1955) (Brown II)
("[I]t should go without saying that the vitality of th[e] constitutional principles [announced in Brown I,] cannot be allowed to yield simply because of disagreement with them").

The country's loss of confidence in the Judiciary would be
underscored by an equally certain and equally reasonable
condemnation for another failing in overruling unnecessarily
and under pressure. Some cost will be paid by anyone who
approves or implements a constitutional decision where it is
unpopular, or who refuses to work to undermine the decision
or to force its reversal. The price may be criticism or ostracism, or it may be violence. An extra price will be paid by
those who themselves disapprove of the decision's results

Opinion of the Court

when viewed outside of constitutional terms, but who nevertheless struggle to accept it, because they respect the rule
of law. To all those who will be so tested by following, the
Court implicitly undertakes to remain steadfast, lest in the
end a price be paid for nothing. The promise of constancy,
once given, binds its maker for as long as the power to stand
by the decision survives and the understanding of the issue
has not changed so fundamentally as to render the commitment obsolete. From the obligation of this promise this
Court cannot and should not assume any exemption when
duty requires it to decide a case in conformance with the
Constitution. A willing breach of it would be nothing less
than a breach of faith, and no Court that broke its faith with
the people could sensibly expect credit for principle in the
decision by which it did that.

It is true that diminished legitimacy may be restored, but
only slowly. Unlike the political branches, a Court thus
weakened could not seek to regain its position with a new
mandate from the voters, and even if the Court could somehow go to the polls, the loss of its principled character could
not be retrieved by the casting of so many votes. Like the
character of an individual, the legitimacy of the Court must
be earned over time. So, indeed, must be the character of
a Nation of people who aspire to live according to the rule
of law. Their belief in themselves as such a people is not
readily separable from their understanding of the Court invested with the authority to decide their constitutional cases
and speak before all others for their constitutional ideals. If
the Court's legitimacy should be undermined, then, so would
the country be in its very ability to see itself through its
constitutional ideals. The Court's concern with legitimacy
is not for the sake of the Court, but for the sake of the Nation
to which it is responsible.

The Court's duty in the present cases is clear. In 1973, it
confronted the already-divisive issue of governmental power

505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT

869Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992)
Opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.
to limit personal choice to undergo abortion, for which it pro-vided a new resolution based on the due process guaranteed

by the Fourteenth Amendment. Whether or not a new so-cial consensus is developing on that issue, its divisiveness is
no less today than in 1973, and pressure to overrule the deci-sion, like pressure to retain it, has grown only more intense.
A decision to overrule Roe's essential holding under the ex-isting circumstances would address error, if error there was,
at the cost of both profound and unnecessary damage to theCourt's legitimacy, and to the Nation's commitment to the
rule of law. It is therefore imperative to adhere to the es-sence of

Roe's original decision, and we do so today.

IV
From what we have said so far it follows that it is a consti-tutional liberty of the woman to have some freedom to terminate her pregnancy. We conclude that the basic decision inRoe was based on a constitutional analysis which we cannot
now repudiate. The woman's liberty is not so unlimited,however, that from the outset the State cannot show its concern for the life of the unborn, and at a later point in fetaldevelopment the State's interest in life has sufficient force so
that the right of the woman to terminate the pregnancy canbe restricted.

That brings us, of course, to the point where much criti-cism has been directed at

Roe, a criticism that always inhereswhen the Court draws a specific rule from what in the Constitution is but a general standard. We conclude, however,that the urgent claims of the woman to retain the ultimate
control over her destiny and her body, claims implicit in themeaning of liberty, require us to perform that function. Liberty must not be extinguished for want of a line that is clear.
And it falls to us to give some real substance to the woman'sliberty to determine whether to carry her pregnancy to full

term.

870 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN

PA. v. CASEY

Opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.

We conclude the line should be drawn at viability, so thatbefore that time the woman has a right to choose to terminate her pregnancy. We adhere to this principle for tworeasons. First, as we have said, is the doctrine of

stare decisis. Any judicial act of line-drawing may seem somewhat
arbitrary, but Roe was a reasoned statement, elaborated withgreat care. We have twice reaffirmed it in the face of great

opposition. See Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S., at 759; Akron I, 462
U. S., at 419-420. Although we must overrule those parts of
Thornburgh and Akron I which, in our view, are inconsistent
with Roe's statement that the State has a legitimate interest
in promoting the life or potential life of the unborn, see
infra, at 882-883, the central premise of those cases represents an unbroken commitment by this Court to the essential
holding of Roe. It is that premise which we reaffirm today.

The second reason is that the concept of viability, as we
noted in Roe, is the time at which there is a realistic possibility of maintaining and nourishing a life outside the womb, so
that the independent existence of the second life can in reason and all fairness be the object of state protection that now
overrides the rights of the woman. See Roe v. Wade, 410
U. S., at 163. Consistent with other constitutional norms,
legislatures may draw lines which appear arbitrary without
the necessity of offering a justification. But courts may not.
We must justify the lines we draw. And there is no line
other than viability which is more workable. To be sure, as
we have said, there may be some medical developments that
affect the precise point of viability, see supra, at 860, but
this is an imprecision within tolerable limits given that the
medical community and all those who must apply its discoveries will continue to explore the matter. The viability line
also has, as a practical matter, an element of fairness. In
some broad sense it might be said that a woman who fails to
act before viability has consented to the State's intervention
on behalf of the developing child.

Opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.
The woman's right to terminate her pregnancy before via-bility is the most central principle of

Roe v. Wade. It is a
rule of law and a component of liberty we cannot renounce.On the other side of the equation is the interest of the

State in the protection of potential life. The Roe Court recognized the State's "important and legitimate interest inprotecting the potentiality of human life."

Roe, supra, at
162. The weight to be given this state interest, not thestrength of the woman's interest, was the difficult question

faced in Roe. We do not need to say whether each of us,had we been Members of the Court when the valuation of
the state interest came before it as an original matter, would
have concluded, as the Roe Court did, that its weight is insufficient to justify a ban on abortions prior to viability even
when it is subject to certain exceptions. The matter is not
before us in the first instance, and coming as it does after
nearly 20 years of litigation in Roe's wake we are satisfied
that the immediate question is not the soundness of Roe's
resolution of the issue, but the precedential force that must
be accorded to its holding. And we have concluded that the
essential holding of Roe should be reaffirmed.

Yet it must be remembered that Roe v. Wade speaks with
clarity in establishing not only the woman's liberty but also
the State's "important and legitimate interest in potential
life." Roe, supra, at 163. That portion of the decision in
Roe has been given too little acknowledgment and implementation by the Court in its subsequent cases. Those cases
decided that any regulation touching upon the abortion decision must survive strict scrutiny, to be sustained only if
drawn in narrow terms to further a compelling state interest. See, e. g., Akron I, supra, at 427. Not all of the cases
decided under that formulation can be reconciled with the
holding in Roe itself that the State has legitimate interests
in the health of the woman and in protecting the potential
life within her. In resolving this tension, we choose to rely
upon Roe, as against the later cases.

PA. v. CASEY

Opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.

Roe established a trimester framework to govern abortionregulations. Under this elaborate but rigid construct, almost no regulation at all is permitted during the first trimes-ter of pregnancy; regulations designed to protect the woman's health, but not to further the State's interest in potential
life, are permitted during the second trimester; and duringthe third trimester, when the fetus is viable, prohibitions are

permitted provided the life or health of the mother is not atstake.

Roe, supra, at 163-166. Most of our cases since Roe
have involved the application of rules derived from the tri-mester framework. See,

e. g., Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, supra; Akron I,
supra.

The trimester framework no doubt was erected to ensure
that the woman's right to choose not become so subordinate
to the State's interest in promoting fetal life that her choice
exists in theory but not in fact. We do not agree, however,
that the trimester approach is necessary to accomplish this
objective. A framework of this rigidity was unnecessary
and in its later interpretation sometimes contradicted the
State's permissible exercise of its powers.

Though the woman has a right to choose to terminate or
continue her pregnancy before viability, it does not at all
follow that the State is prohibited from taking steps to ensure that this choice is thoughtful and informed. Even in
the earliest stages of pregnancy, the State may enact rules
and regulations designed to encourage her to know that
there are philosophic and social arguments of great weight
that can be brought to bear in favor of continuing the pregnancy to full term and that there are procedures and institutions to allow adoption of unwanted children as well as a
certain degree of state assistance if the mother chooses to
raise the child herself. " `[T]he Constitution does not forbid
a State or city, pursuant to democratic processes, from expressing a preference for normal childbirth.' " Webster v.
Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S., at 511 (opinion of

the Court) (quoting Poelker v. Doe, 432 U. S. 519, 521 (1977)).
It follows that States are free to enact laws to provide a
reasonable framework for a woman to make a decision that
has such profound and lasting meaning. This, too, we find
consistent with Roe's central premises, and indeed the inevitable consequence of our holding that the State has an interest in protecting the life of the unborn.

We reject the trimester framework, which we do not consider to be part of the essential holding of Roe. See Webster
v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S., at 518 (opinion of
Rehnquist, C. J.); id., at 529 (O'Connor, J., concurring in
part and concurring in judgment) (describing the trimester
framework as "problematic"). Measures aimed at ensuring
that a woman's choice contemplates the consequences for the
fetus do not necessarily interfere with the right recognized
in Roe, although those measures have been found to be inconsistent with the rigid trimester framework announced in that
case. A logical reading of the central holding in Roe itself,
and a necessary reconciliation of the liberty of the woman
and the interest of the State in promoting prenatal life, require, in our view, that we abandon the trimester framework
as a rigid prohibition on all previability regulation aimed at
the protection of fetal life. The trimester framework suffers from these basic flaws: in its formulation it misconceives
the nature of the pregnant woman's interest; and in practice
it undervalues the State's interest in potential life, as recognized in Roe.

As our jurisprudence relating to all liberties save perhaps
abortion has recognized, not every law which makes a right
more difficult to exercise is, ipso facto, an infringement of
that right. An example clarifies the point. We have held
that not every ballot access limitation amounts to an infringement of the right to vote. Rather, the States are
granted substantial flexibility in establishing the framework
within which voters choose the candidates for whom they

wish to vote. Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 788(1983);

Norman v. Reed, 502 U. S. 279 (1992).
The abortion right is similar. Numerous forms of stateregulation might have the incidental effect of increasing the

cost or decreasing the availability of medical care, whether
for abortion or any other medical procedure. The fact thata law which serves a valid purpose, one not designed to

strike at the right itself, has the incidental effect of makingit more difficult or more expensive to procure an abortion
cannot be enough to invalidate it. Only where state regula-tion imposes an undue burden on a woman's ability to make
this decision does the power of the State reach into the heart
of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause. See
Hodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U. S. 417, 458-459 (1990) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment in
part); Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497
U. S. 502, 519-520 (1990) (Akron II) (opinion of Kennedy,
J.); Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, supra, at 530
(O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists, 476 U. S., at 828 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); Simopoulos v. Virginia, 462 U. S. 506, 520 (1983)

(1976) (Bellotti I).

For the most part, the Court's early abortion cases adhered to this view. In Maher v. Roe, 432 U. S. 464, 473-474
(1977), the Court explained: "Roe did not declare an unqualified `constitutional right to an abortion,' as the District
Court seemed to think. Rather, the right protects the
woman from unduly burdensome interference with her freedom to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy." See

also Doe v. Bolton, 410 U. S. 179, 198 (1973) ("[T]he interposi-tion of the hospital abortion committee is unduly restrictive

of the patient's rights"); Bellotti I, supra, at 147 (State maynot "impose undue burdens upon a minor capable of giving
an informed consent"); Harris v. McRae, 448 U. S. 297, 314
(1980) (citing Maher, supra). Cf. Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U. S., at 688 ("[T]he same test must
be applied to state regulations that burden an individual'sright to decide to prevent conception or terminate pregnancy

by substantially limiting access to the means of effectuatingthat decision as is applied to state statutes that prohibit the
decision entirely").

These considerations of the nature of the abortion right
illustrate that it is an overstatement to describe it as a right
to decide whether to have an abortion "without interference
from the State." Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v.
Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, 61 (1976). All abortion regulations
interfere to some degree with a woman's ability to decide
whether to terminate her pregnancy. It is, as a consequence, not surprising that despite the protestations contained in the original Roe opinion to the effect that the Court
was not recognizing an absolute right, 410 U. S., at 154-155,
the Court's experience applying the trimester framework
has led to the striking down of some abortion regulations
which in no real sense deprived women of the ultimate decision. Those decisions went too far because the right recognized by Roe is a right "to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a
person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child."
Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S., at 453. Not all governmental
intrusion is of necessity unwarranted; and that brings us to
the other basic flaw in the trimester framework: even in
Roe's terms, in practice it undervalues the State's interest in
the potential life within the woman.

Roe v. Wade was express in its recognition of the State's
"important and legitimate interest[s] in preserving and pro505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:03 PAGES OPINPGT

tecting the health of the pregnant woman [and] in protectingthe potentiality of human life." 410 U. S., at 162. The trimester framework, however, does not fulfill Roe's own prom-ise that the State has an interest in protecting fetal life or
potential life. Roe began the contradiction by using the trimester framework to forbid any regulation of abortion de-signed to advance that interest before viability.

Id., at 163.
Before viability, Roe and subsequent cases treat all govern-mental attempts to influence a woman's decision on behalf of

the potential life within her as unwarranted. This treat-ment is, in our judgment, incompatible with the recognition
that there is a substantial state interest in potential life
throughout pregnancy. Cf. Webster, 492 U. S., at 519 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.); Akron I, supra, at 461 (O'Connor,
J., dissenting).

The very notion that the State has a substantial interest
in potential life leads to the conclusion that not all regulations must be deemed unwarranted. Not all burdens on the
right to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy will be
undue. In our view, the undue burden standard is the appropriate means of reconciling the State's interest with the
woman's constitutionally protected liberty.

The concept of an undue burden has been utilized by the
Court as well as individual Members of the Court, including
two of us, in ways that could be considered inconsistent.
See, e. g., Hodgson v. Minnesota, supra, at 459-461 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment);
Akron II, supra, at 519-520 (opinion of Kennedy, J.); Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, supra, at 828-829 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); Akron I,
supra, at 461-466 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); Harris v.
McRae, supra, at 314; Maher v. Roe, supra, at 473; Beal v.
Doe, 432 U. S. 438, 446 (1977); Bellotti I, supra, at 147. Because we set forth a standard of general application to which
we intend to adhere, it is important to clarify what is meant
by an undue burden.

505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:03 PAGES OPINPGT

877Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992)
Opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.
A finding of an undue burden is a shorthand for the conclu-sion that a state regulation has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking anabortion of a nonviable fetus. A statute with this purpose
is invalid because the means chosen by the State to further
the interest in potential life must be calculated to inform thewoman's free choice, not hinder it. And a statute which,

while furthering the interest in potential life or some othervalid state interest, has the effect of placing a substantial
obstacle in the path of a woman's choice cannot be considereda permissible means of serving its legitimate ends. To the
extent that the opinions of the Court or of individual Justices
use the undue burden standard in a manner that is inconsistent with this analysis, we set out what in our view should be
the controlling standard. Cf. McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S.
467, 489 (1991) (attempting "to define the doctrine of abuse
of the writ with more precision" after acknowledging tension
among earlier cases). In our considered judgment, an undue
burden is an unconstitutional burden. See Akron II, 497
U. S., at 519-520 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). Understood another way, we answer the question, left open in previous
opinions discussing the undue burden formulation, whether
a law designed to further the State's interest in fetal life
which imposes an undue burden on the woman's decision before fetal viability could be constitutional. See, e. g., Akron
I, 462 U. S., at 462-463 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). The
answer is no.

Some guiding principles should emerge. What is at stake
is the woman's right to make the ultimate decision, not a
right to be insulated from all others in doing so. Regulations which do no more than create a structural mechanism
by which the State, or the parent or guardian of a minor,
may express profound respect for the life of the unborn are
permitted, if they are not a substantial obstacle to the woman's exercise of the right to choose. See infra, at 899-900
(addressing Pennsylvania's parental consent requirement).

PA. v. CASEY

Opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.

Unless it has that effect on her right of choice, a state measure designed to persuade her to choose childbirth over abortion will be upheld if reasonably related to that goal. Regulations designed to foster the health of a woman seeking an
abortion are valid if they do not constitute an undue burden.

Even when jurists reason from shared premises, some disagreement is inevitable. Compare Hodgson, 497 U. S., at
482-497 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part and
dissenting in part), with id., at 458-460 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment in part). That
is to be expected in the application of any legal standard
which must accommodate life's complexity. We do not expect it to be otherwise with respect to the undue burden
standard. We give this summary:

(a) To protect the central right recognized by Roe v. Wade
while at the same time accommodating the State's profound
interest in potential life, we will employ the undue burden
analysis as explained in this opinion. An undue burden exists, and therefore a provision of law is invalid, if its purpose
or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a
woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.

(b) We reject the rigid trimester framework of Roe v.
Wade. To promote the State's profound interest in potential
life, throughout pregnancy the State may take measures to
ensure that the woman's choice is informed, and measures
designed to advance this interest will not be invalidated as
long as their purpose is to persuade the woman to choose
childbirth over abortion. These measures must not be an
undue burden on the right.

(c) As with any medical procedure, the State may enact
regulations to further the health or safety of a woman seeking an abortion. Unnecessary health regulations that have
the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to
a woman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden on
the right.

Opinion of the Court
(d) Our adoption of the undue burden analysis does notdisturb the central holding of Roe v. Wade, and we reaffirm

that holding. Regardless of whether exceptions are madefor particular circumstances, a State may not prohibit any
woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate herpregnancy before viability.

(e) We also reaffirm Roe's holding that "subsequent to via-bility, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality
of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe,abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical
judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of themother."

Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S., at 164-165.These principles control our assessment of the Pennsylvania statute, and we now turn to the issue of the validity ofits challenged provisions.

V
The Court of Appeals applied what it believed to be theundue burden standard and upheld each of the provisions

except for the husband notification requirement. We agreegenerally with this conclusion, but refine the undue burden
analysis in accordance with the principles articulated above.We now consider the separate statutory sections at issue.

A
Because it is central to the operation of various other re-quirements, we begin with the statute's definition of medical

emergency. Under the statute, a medical emergency is

"[t]hat condition which, on the basis of the physician's
good faith clinical judgment, so complicates the medicalcondition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death orfor which a delay will create serious risk of substantial
and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function."

PA. v. CASEY

Opinion of the Court

Petitioners argue that the definition is too narrow, con-tending that it forecloses the possibility of an immediate

abortion despite some significant health risks. If the con-tention were correct, we would be required to invalidate the
restrictive operation of the provision, for the essential holding of Roe forbids a State to interfere with a woman's choiceto undergo an abortion procedure if continuing her pregnancy would constitute a threat to her health. 410 U. S.,at 164. See also

Harris v. McRae, 448 U. S., at 316.
The District Court found that there were three seriousconditions which would not be covered by the statute: preeclampsia, inevitable abortion, and premature ruptured
membrane. 744 F. Supp., at 1378. Yet, as the Court of Appeals observed, 947 F. 2d, at 700-701, it is undisputed that
under some circumstances each of these conditions could lead
to an illness with substantial and irreversible consequences.
While the definition could be interpreted in an unconstitutional manner, the Court of Appeals construed the phrase
"serious risk" to include those circumstances. Id., at 701.
It stated: "[W]e read the medical emergency exception as
intended by the Pennsylvania legislature to assure that compliance with its abortion regulations would not in any way
pose a significant threat to the life or health of a woman."
Ibid. As we said in Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472
U. S. 491, 499-500 (1985): "Normally, . . . we defer to the
construction of a state statute given it by the lower federal
courts." Indeed, we have said that we will defer to lower
court interpretations of state law unless they amount to
"plain" error. Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U. S. 109, 118 (1943).
This " `reflect[s] our belief that district courts and courts of
appeals are better schooled in and more able to interpret the
laws of their respective States.' " Frisby v. Schultz, 487
U. S. 474, 482 (1988) (citation omitted). We adhere to that
course today, and conclude that, as construed by the Court of
Appeals, the medical emergency definition imposes no undue
burden on a woman's abortion right.

B
We next consider the informed consent requirement. 18Pa. Cons. Stat. $ 3205 (1990). Except in a medical emergency, the statute requires that at least 24 hours before per-forming an abortion a physician inform the woman of the
nature of the procedure, the health risks of the abortion andof childbirth, and the "probable gestational age of the unborn
child." The physician or a qualified nonphysician must in-form the woman of the availability of printed materials published by the State describing the fetus and providing infor-mation about medical assistance for childbirth, information
about child support from the father, and a list of agencieswhich provide adoption and other services as alternatives
to abortion. An abortion may not be performed unless thewoman certifies in writing that she has been informed of the
availability of these printed materials and has been providedthem if she chooses to view them.

Our prior decisions establish that as with any medical pro-cedure, the State may require a woman to give her written
informed consent to an abortion. See Planned Parenthood
of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S., at 67. In this respect,the statute is unexceptional. Petitioners challenge the statute's definition of informed consent because it includes theprovision of specific information by the doctor and the mandatory 24-hour waiting period. The conclusions reached bya majority of the Justices in the separate opinions filed today
and the undue burden standard adopted in this opinion re-quire us to overrule in part some of the Court's past decisions, decisions driven by the trimester framework's prohibi-tion of all previability regulations designed to further the
State's interest in fetal life.In Akron I, 462 U. S. 416 (1983), we invalidated an ordinance which required that a woman seeking an abortion beprovided by her physician with specific information "designed to influence the woman's informed choice betweenabortion or childbirth." Id., at 444. As we later described

the Akron I holding in Thornburgh v. American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S., at 762, there
were two purported flaws in the Akron ordinance: the infor-mation was designed to dissuade the woman from having an

abortion and the ordinance imposed "a rigid requirement
that a specific body of information be given in all cases, irre-spective of the particular needs of the patient . . . ."

Ibid.
To the extent Akron I and Thornburgh find a constitu-tional violation when the government requires, as it does

here, the giving of truthful, nonmisleading information aboutthe nature of the procedure, the attendant health risks and
those of childbirth, and the "probable gestational age" of the
fetus, those cases go too far, are inconsistent with Roe's acknowledgment of an important interest in potential life, and
are overruled. This is clear even on the very terms of
Akron I and Thornburgh. Those decisions, along with Danforth, recognize a substantial government interest justifying
a requirement that a woman be apprised of the health risks
of abortion and childbirth. E. g., Danforth, supra, at 66-67.
It cannot be questioned that psychological well-being is a
facet of health. Nor can it be doubted that most women
considering an abortion would deem the impact on the fetus
relevant, if not dispositive, to the decision. In attempting
to ensure that a woman apprehend the full consequences of
her decision, the State furthers the legitimate purpose of
reducing the risk that a woman may elect an abortion, only
to discover later, with devastating psychological consequences, that her decision was not fully informed. If the
information the State requires to be made available to the
woman is truthful and not misleading, the requirement may
be permissible.

We also see no reason why the State may not require doctors to inform a woman seeking an abortion of the availability of materials relating to the consequences to the fetus,
even when those consequences have no direct relation to her
health. An example illustrates the point. We would think

883Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992)
Opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.
it constitutional for the State to require that in order forthere to be informed consent to a kidney transplant operation the recipient must be supplied with information aboutrisks to the donor as well as risks to himself or herself. A
requirement that the physician make available information
similar to that mandated by the statute here was describedin

Thornburgh as "an outright attempt to wedge the Commonwealth's message discouraging abortion into the privacyof the informed-consent dialogue between the woman and

her physician." 476 U. S., at 762. We conclude, however,that informed choice need not be defined in such narrow
terms that all considerations of the effect on the fetus are
made irrelevant. As we have made clear, we depart from
the holdings of Akron I and Thornburgh to the extent that
we permit a State to further its legitimate goal of protecting
the life of the unborn by enacting legislation aimed at ensuring a decision that is mature and informed, even when in so
doing the State expresses a preference for childbirth over
abortion. In short, requiring that the woman be informed
of the availability of information relating to fetal development and the assistance available should she decide to carry
the pregnancy to full term is a reasonable measure to ensure
an informed choice, one which might cause the woman to
choose childbirth over abortion. This requirement cannot
be considered a substantial obstacle to obtaining an abortion,
and, it follows, there is no undue burden.

Our prior cases also suggest that the "straitjacket,"
Thornburgh, supra, at 762 (quoting Danforth, supra, at 67,
n. 8), of particular information which must be given in each
case interferes with a constitutional right of privacy between
a pregnant woman and her physician. As a preliminary
matter, it is worth noting that the statute now before us does
not require a physician to comply with the informed consent
provisions "if he or she can demonstrate by a preponderance
of the evidence, that he or she reasonably believed that furnishing the information would have resulted in a severely

adverse effect on the physical or mental health of the pa-tient." 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. $ 3205 (1990). In this respect, the

statute does not prevent the physician from exercising his orher medical judgment.

Whatever constitutional status the doctor-patient relation
may have as a general matter, in the present context it isderivative of the woman's position. The doctor-patient relation does not underlie or override the two more generalrights under which the abortion right is justified: the right
to make family decisions and the right to physical autonomy.On its own, the doctor-patient relation here is entitled to
the same solicitude it receives in other contexts. Thus, a
requirement that a doctor give a woman certain information
as part of obtaining her consent to an abortion is, for constitutional purposes, no different from a requirement that a
doctor give certain specific information about any medical
procedure.

All that is left of petitioners' argument is an asserted First
Amendment right of a physician not to provide information
about the risks of abortion, and childbirth, in a manner
mandated by the State. To be sure, the physician's First
Amendment rights not to speak are implicated, see Wooley
v. Maynard, 430 U. S. 705 (1977), but only as part of the
practice of medicine, subject to reasonable licensing and regulation by the State, cf. Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 603
(1977). We see no constitutional infirmity in the requirement that the physician provide the information mandated
by the State here.

The Pennsylvania statute also requires us to reconsider
the holding in Akron I that the State may not require that
a physician, as opposed to a qualified assistant, provide information relevant to a woman's informed consent. 462 U. S.,
at 448. Since there is no evidence on this record that requiring a doctor to give the information as provided by the statute would amount in practical terms to a substantial obstacle
to a woman seeking an abortion, we conclude that it is not

an undue burden. Our cases reflect the fact that the Consti-tution gives the States broad latitude to decide that particular functions may be performed only by licensed profession-als, even if an objective assessment might suggest that those
same tasks could be performed by others. See Williamson
v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U. S. 483 (1955). Thus, weuphold the provision as a reasonable means to ensure that

the woman's consent is informed.Our analysis of Pennsylvania's 24-hour waiting period between the provision of the information deemed necessary toinformed consent and the performance of an abortion under
the undue burden standard requires us to reconsider the
premise behind the decision in Akron I invalidating a parallel requirement. In Akron I we said: "Nor are we convinced
that the State's legitimate concern that the woman's decision
be informed is reasonably served by requiring a 24-hour
delay as a matter of course." 462 U. S., at 450. We consider
that conclusion to be wrong. The idea that important decisions will be more informed and deliberate if they follow
some period of reflection does not strike us as unreasonable,
particularly where the statute directs that important information become part of the background of the decision. The
statute, as construed by the Court of Appeals, permits avoidance of the waiting period in the event of a medical emergency and the record evidence shows that in the vast majority of cases, a 24-hour delay does not create any appreciable
health risk. In theory, at least, the waiting period is a reasonable measure to implement the State's interest in protecting the life of the unborn, a measure that does not amount
to an undue burden.

Whether the mandatory 24-hour waiting period is nonetheless invalid because in practice it is a substantial obstacle
to a woman's choice to terminate her pregnancy is a closer
question. The findings of fact by the District Court indicate
that because of the distances many women must travel to
reach an abortion provider, the practical effect will often be

Opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.

a delay of much more than a day because the waiting periodrequires that a woman seeking an abortion make at least two

visits to the doctor. The District Court also found that inmany instances this will increase the exposure of women
seeking abortions to "the harassment and hostility of antiabortion protestors demonstrating outside a clinic." 744 F.Supp., at 1351. As a result, the District Court found that

for those women who have the fewest financial resources,those who must travel long distances, and those who have
difficulty explaining their whereabouts to husbands, employ-ers, or others, the 24-hour waiting period will be "particularly burdensome." Id., at 1352.

These findings are troubling in some respects, but they do
not demonstrate that the waiting period constitutes an
undue burden. We do not doubt that, as the District Court
held, the waiting period has the effect of "increasing the cost
and risk of delay of abortions," id., at 1378, but the District
Court did not conclude that the increased costs and potential
delays amount to substantial obstacles. Rather, applying
the trimester framework's strict prohibition of all regulation
designed to promote the State's interest in potential life before viability, see id., at 1374, the District Court concluded
that the waiting period does not further the state "interest
in maternal health" and "infringes the physician's discretion
to exercise sound medical judgment," id., at 1378. Yet, as
we have stated, under the undue burden standard a State is
permitted to enact persuasive measures which favor childbirth over abortion, even if those measures do not further a
health interest. And while the waiting period does limit a
physician's discretion, that is not, standing alone, a reason to
invalidate it. In light of the construction given the statute's
definition of medical emergency by the Court of Appeals, and
the District Court's findings, we cannot say that the waiting
period imposes a real health risk.

We also disagree with the District Court's conclusion that
the "particularly burdensome" effects of the waiting period

Opinion of the Court
on some women require its invalidation. A particular bur-den is not of necessity a substantial obstacle. Whether a

burden falls on a particular group is a distinct inquiry fromwhether it is a substantial obstacle even as to the women in
that group. And the District Court did not conclude thatthe waiting period is such an obstacle even for the women
who are most burdened by it. Hence, on the record beforeus, and in the context of this facial challenge, we are not
convinced that the 24-hour waiting period constitutes anundue burden.

We are left with the argument that the various aspects ofthe informed consent requirement are unconstitutional because they place barriers in the way of abortion on demand.Even the broadest reading of Roe, however, has not suggested that there is a constitutional right to abortion on de-mand. See, e. g., Doe v. Bolton, 410 U. S., at 189. Rather,
the right protected by Roe is a right to decide to terminatea pregnancy free of undue interference by the State. Because the informed consent requirement facilitates the wiseexercise of that right, it cannot be classified as an interference with the right Roe protects. The informed consent re-quirement is not an undue burden on that right.

C
Section 3209 of Pennsylvania's abortion law provides, ex-cept in cases of medical emergency, that no physician shall

perform an abortion on a married woman without receivinga signed statement from the woman that she has notified her
spouse that she is about to undergo an abortion. Thewoman has the option of providing an alternative signed
statement certifying that her husband is not the man whoimpregnated her; that her husband could not be located; that
the pregnancy is the result of spousal sexual assault whichshe has reported; or that the woman believes that notifying
her husband will cause him or someone else to inflict bodilyinjury upon her. A physician who performs an abortion on

a married woman without receiving the appropriate signedstatement will have his or her license revoked, and is liable

to the husband for damages.The District Court heard the testimony of numerous expert witnesses, and made detailed findings of fact regardingthe effect of this statute. These included:

"273. The vast majority of women consult their hus-bands prior to deciding to terminate their pregnancy. . . .

. . . . .
"279. The `bodily injury' exception could not be in-voked by a married woman whose husband, if notified,

would, in her reasonable belief, threaten to (a) publicizeher intent to have an abortion to family, friends or acquaintances; (b) retaliate against her in future child cus-tody or divorce proceedings; (c) inflict psychological intimidation or emotional harm upon her, her children orother persons; (d) inflict bodily harm on other persons
such as children, family members or other loved ones; or(e) use his control over finances to deprive of necessary
monies for herself or her children. . . .. . . . .

"281. Studies reveal that family violence occurs in twomillion families in the United States. This figure, however, is a conservative one that substantially under-states (because battering is usually not reported until it
reaches life-threatening proportions) the actual numberof families affected by domestic violence. In fact, researchers estimate that one of every two women will bebattered at some time in their life. . . .

"282. A wife may not elect to notify her husband ofher intention to have an abortion for a variety of reasons, including the husband's illness, concern about herown health, the imminent failure of the marriage, or the
husband's absolute opposition to the abortion. . . ."283. The required filing of the spousal consent form
would require plaintiff-clinics to change their counseling

procedures and force women to reveal their most intimate decision-making on pain of criminal sanctions.
The confidentiality of these revelations could not be
guaranteed, since the woman's records are not immune
from subpoena. . . .

"284. Women of all class levels, educational backgrounds, and racial, ethnic and religious groups are
battered. . . .

"285. Wife-battering or abuse can take on many physical and psychological forms. The nature and scope of
the battering can cover a broad range of actions and be
gruesome and torturous. . . .

"286. Married women, victims of battering, have been
killed in Pennsylvania and throughout the United
States. . . .

"287. Battering can often involve a substantial
amount of sexual abuse, including marital rape and
sexual mutilation. . . .

"288. In a domestic abuse situation, it is common for
the battering husband to also abuse the children in an
attempt to coerce the wife. . . .

"289. Mere notification of pregnancy is frequently a
flashpoint for battering and violence within the family.
The number of battering incidents is high during the
pregnancy and often the worst abuse can be associated
with pregnancy. . . . The battering husband may deny

parentage and use the pregnancy as an excuse for
abuse. . . .

"290. Secrecy typically shrouds abusive families.
Family members are instructed not to tell anyone, especially police or doctors, about the abuse and violence.
Battering husbands often threaten their wives or her
children with further abuse if she tells an outsider of the
violence and tells her that nobody will believe her. A
battered woman, therefore, is highly unlikely to disclose

the violence against her for fear of retaliation by the
abuser. . . .

"291. Even when confronted directly by medical personnel or other helping professionals, battered women
often will not admit to the battering because they have
not admitted to themselves that they are battered. . . .. . . . .

"294. A woman in a shelter or a safe house unknown
to her husband is not `reasonably likely' to have bodily
harm inflicted upon her by her batterer, however her
attempt to notify her husband pursuant to section 3209
could accidentally disclose her whereabouts to her husband. Her fear of future ramifications would be realistic under the circumstances.

"295. Marital rape is rarely discussed with others or
reported to law enforcement authorities, and of those
reported only few are prosecuted. . . .

"296. It is common for battered women to have sexual
intercourse with their husbands to avoid being battered.
While this type of coercive sexual activity would be
spousal sexual assault as defined by the Act, many
women may not consider it to be so and others would
fear disbelief. . . .

"297. The marital rape exception to section 3209 cannot be claimed by women who are victims of coercive
sexual behavior other than penetration. The 90-day reporting requirement of the spousal sexual assault statute, 18 Pa. Con. Stat. Ann. $ 3218(c), further narrows the
class of sexually abused wives who can claim the exception, since many of these women may be psychologically
unable to discuss or report the rape for several years
after the incident. . . .

"298. Because of the nature of the battering relationship, battered women are unlikely to avail themselves of
the exceptions to section 3209 of the Act, regardless of

whether the section applies to them." 744 F. Supp., at1360-1362 (footnote omitted).

These findings are supported by studies of domestic vio-lence. The American Medical Association (AMA) has published a summary of the recent research in this field, whichindicates that in an average 12-month period in this country,
approximately two million women are the victims of severeassaults by their male partners. In a 1985 survey, women
reported that nearly one of every eight husbands had as-saulted their wives during the past year. The AMA views
these figures as "marked underestimates," because the na-ture of these incidents discourages women from reporting
them, and because surveys typically exclude the very poor,those who do not speak English well, and women who are
homeless or in institutions or hospitals when the survey isconducted. According to the AMA, "[r]esearchers on family
violence agree that the true incidence of partner violence isprobably double the above estimates; or four million severely
assaulted women per year. Studies on prevalence suggestthat from one-fifth to one-third of all women will be physically assaulted by a partner or ex-partner during their life-time." AMA Council on Scientific Affairs, Violence Against
Women 7 (1991) (emphasis in original). Thus on an averageday in the United States, nearly 11,000 women are severely
assaulted by their male partners. Many of these incidentsinvolve sexual assault.

tered Woman Syndrome 27-28 (1984). Many victims of do-mestic violence remain with their abusers, perhaps because

they perceive no superior alternative. Herbert, Silver, &Ellard, Coping with an Abusive Relationship: I. How and
Why do Women Stay?, 53 J. Marriage & the Family 311
(1991). Many abused women who find temporary refuge inshelters return to their husbands, in large part because they

have no other source of income. Aguirre, Why Do They Re-turn? Abused Wives in Shelters, 30 J. Nat. Assn. of Social
Workers 350, 352 (1985). Returning to one's abuser can bedangerous. Recent Federal Bureau of Investigation statistics disclose that 8.8 percent of all homicide victims in the
United States are killed by their spouses. Mercy & Saltzman, Fatal Violence Among Spouses in the United States,

The limited research that has been conducted with respect
to notifying one's husband about an abortion, although involving samples too small to be representative, also supports
the District Court's findings of fact. The vast majority of
women notify their male partners of their decision to obtain
an abortion. In many cases in which married women do not
notify their husbands, the pregnancy is the result of an extramarital affair. Where the husband is the father, the primary reason women do not notify their husbands is that the
husband and wife are experiencing marital difficulties, often
accompanied by incidents of violence. Ryan & Plutzer,

and Marital Interaction, 51 J. Marriage & the Family 41, 44
(1989).

This information and the District Court's findings reinforce what common sense would suggest. In well505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:03 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
functioning marriages, spouses discuss important intimatedecisions such as whether to bear a child. But there are

millions of women in this country who are the victims ofregular physical and psychological abuse at the hands of
their husbands. Should these women become pregnant,
they may have very good reasons for not wishing to informtheir husbands of their decision to obtain an abortion. Many

may have justifiable fears of physical abuse, but may be noless fearful of the consequences of reporting prior abuse to
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Many may have a rea-sonable fear that notifying their husbands will provoke further instances of child abuse; these women are not exempt
from $ 3209's notification requirement. Many may fear devastating forms of psychological abuse from their husbands,
including verbal harassment, threats of future violence, the
destruction of possessions, physical confinement to the home,
the withdrawal of financial support, or the disclosure of the
abortion to family and friends. These methods of psychological abuse may act as even more of a deterrent to notification
than the possibility of physical violence, but women who are
the victims of the abuse are not exempt from $ 3209's notification requirement. And many women who are pregnant as
a result of sexual assaults by their husbands will be unable to
avail themselves of the exception for spousal sexual assault,

$ 3209(b)(3), because the exception requires that the woman
have notified law enforcement authorities within 90 days of
the assault, and her husband will be notified of her report
once an investigation begins, $ 3128(c). If anything in this
field is certain, it is that victims of spousal sexual assault are
extremely reluctant to report the abuse to the government;
hence, a great many spousal rape victims will not be exempt
from the notification requirement imposed by $ 3209.

The spousal notification requirement is thus likely to prevent a significant number of women from obtaining an abortion. It does not merely make abortions a little more difficult or expensive to obtain; for many women, it will impose

Opinion of the Court

a substantial obstacle. We must not blind ourselves to thefact that the significant number of women who fear for their

safety and the safety of their children are likely to be de-terred from procuring an abortion as surely as if the Commonwealth had outlawed abortion in all cases.

Respondents attempt to avoid the conclusion that $ 3209 isinvalid by pointing out that it imposes almost no burden at

all for the vast majority of women seeking abortions. Theybegin by noting that only about 20 percent of the women
who obtain abortions are married. They then note that ofthese women about 95 percent notify their husbands of their
own volition. Thus, respondents argue, the effects of $ 3209
are felt by only one percent of the women who obtain abortions. Respondents argue that since some of these women
will be able to notify their husbands without adverse consequences or will qualify for one of the exceptions, the statute
affects fewer than one percent of women seeking abortions.
For this reason, it is asserted, the statute cannot be invalid
on its face. See Brief for Respondents 83-86. We disagree
with respondents' basic method of analysis.

The analysis does not end with the one percent of women
upon whom the statute operates; it begins there. Legislation is measured for consistency with the Constitution by its
impact on those whose conduct it affects. For example, we
would not say that a law which requires a newspaper to print
a candidate's reply to an unfavorable editorial is valid on its
face because most newspapers would adopt the policy even
absent the law. See Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U. S. 241 (1974). The proper focus of constitutional inquiry is the group for whom the law is a restriction,
not the group for whom the law is irrelevant.

Respondents' argument itself gives implicit recognition to
this principle, at one of its critical points. Respondents
speak of the one percent of women seeking abortions who
are married and would choose not to notify their husbands
of their plans. By selecting as the controlling class women

Opinion of the Court
who wish to obtain abortions, rather than all women or allpregnant women, respondents in effect concede that $ 3209

must be judged by reference to those for whom it is an actualrather than an irrelevant restriction. Of course, as we have
said, $ 3209's real target is narrower even than the class of
women seeking abortions identified by the State: it is mar-ried women seeking abortions who do not wish to notify their

husbands of their intentions and who do not qualify for oneof the statutory exceptions to the notice requirement. The
unfortunate yet persisting conditions we document abovewill mean that in a large fraction of the cases in which $ 3209
is relevant, it will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice to undergo an abortion. It is an undue burden,
and therefore invalid.

This conclusion is in no way inconsistent with our decisions
upholding parental notification or consent requirements.
See, e. g., Akron II, 497 U. S., at 510-519; Bellotti v. Baird,
443 U. S. 622 (1979) (Bellotti II); Planned Parenthood of
Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S., at 74. Those enactments, and our judgment that they are constitutional, are
based on the quite reasonable assumption that minors will
benefit from consultation with their parents and that children will often not realize that their parents have their best
interests at heart. We cannot adopt a parallel assumption
about adult women.

We recognize that a husband has a "deep and proper concern and interest . . . in his wife's pregnancy and in the
growth and development of the fetus she is carrying." Danforth, supra, at 69. With regard to the children he has fathered and raised, the Court has recognized his "cognizable
and substantial" interest in their custody. Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U. S. 645, 651-652 (1972); see also Quilloin v. Walcott, 434 U. S. 246 (1978); Caban v. Mohammed, 441 U. S. 380
(1979); Lehr v. Robertson, 463 U. S. 248 (1983). If these cases
concerned a State's ability to require the mother to notify
the father before taking some action with respect to a living

Opinion of the Court

child raised by both, therefore, it would be reasonable to conclude as a general matter that the father's interest in the
welfare of the child and the mother's interest are equal.

Before birth, however, the issue takes on a very different
cast. It is an inescapable biological fact that state regulation with respect to the child a woman is carrying will have
a far greater impact on the mother's liberty than on the father's. The effect of state regulation on a woman's protected liberty is doubly deserving of scrutiny in such a case,
as the State has touched not only upon the private sphere of
the family but upon the very bodily integrity of the pregnant
woman. Cf. Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497
U. S., at 281. The Court has held that "when the wife and
the husband disagree on this decision, the view of only one
of the two marriage partners can prevail. Inasmuch as it is
the woman who physically bears the child and who is the
more directly and immediately affected by the pregnancy, as
between the two, the balance weighs in her favor." Danforth, supra, at 71. This conclusion rests upon the basic nature of marriage and the nature of our Constitution: "[T]he
marital couple is not an independent entity with a mind and
heart of its own, but an association of two individuals each
with a separate intellectual and emotional makeup. If the
right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting
a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child."
Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S., at 453 (emphasis in original).
The Constitution protects individuals, men and women alike,
from unjustified state interference, even when that interference is enacted into law for the benefit of their spouses.

There was a time, not so long ago, when a different understanding of the family and of the Constitution prevailed. In
Bradwell v. State, 16 Wall. 130 (1873), three Members of this

505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:03 PAGES OPINPGT

897Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
Court reaffirmed the common-law principle that "a woman
had no legal existence separate from her husband, who was
regarded as her head and representative in the social state;
and, notwithstanding some recent modifications of this civil
status, many of the special rules of law flowing from and
dependent upon this cardinal principle still exist in full force
in most States." Id., at 141 (Bradley, J., joined by Swayne
and Field, JJ., concurring in judgment). Only one generation has passed since this Court observed that "woman is
still regarded as the center of home and family life," with
attendant "special responsibilities" that precluded full and
independent legal status under the Constitution. Hoyt v.
Florida, 368 U. S. 57, 62 (1961). These views, of course, are
no longer consistent with our understanding of the family,
the individual, or the Constitution.

In keeping with our rejection of the common-law understanding of a woman's role within the family, the Court held
in Danforth that the Constitution does not permit a State to
require a married woman to obtain her husband's consent
before undergoing an abortion. 428 U. S., at 69. The principles that guided the Court in Danforth should be our
guides today. For the great many women who are victims
of abuse inflicted by their husbands, or whose children are
the victims of such abuse, a spousal notice requirement enables the husband to wield an effective veto over his wife's
decision. Whether the prospect of notification itself deters
such women from seeking abortions, or whether the husband, through physical force or psychological pressure or
economic coercion, prevents his wife from obtaining an abortion until it is too late, the notice requirement will often be
tantamount to the veto found unconstitutional in Danforth.
The women most affected by this law--those who most reasonably fear the consequences of notifying their husbands
that they are pregnant--are in the gravest danger.

898 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN

PA. v. CASEY

Opinion of the Court

The husband's interest in the life of the child his wife is
carrying does not permit the State to empower him with this
troubling degree of authority over his wife. The contrary
view leads to consequences reminiscent of the common law.
A husband has no enforceable right to require a wife to advise him before she exercises her personal choices. If a husband's interest in the potential life of the child outweighs a
wife's liberty, the State could require a married woman to
notify her husband before she uses a postfertilization contraceptive. Perhaps next in line would be a statute requiring
pregnant married women to notify their husbands before
engaging in conduct causing risks to the fetus. After all, if
the husband's interest in the fetus' safety is a sufficient predicate for state regulation, the State could reasonably conclude
that pregnant wives should notify their husbands before
drinking alcohol or smoking. Perhaps married women
should notify their husbands before using contraceptives or
before undergoing any type of surgery that may have complications affecting the husband's interest in his wife's reproductive organs. And if a husband's interest justifies notice
in any of these cases, one might reasonably argue that it
justifies exactly what the Danforth Court held it did not
justify--a requirement of the husband's consent as well. A
State may not give to a man the kind of dominion over his
wife that parents exercise over their children.

Section 3209 embodies a view of marriage consonant with
the common-law status of married women but repugnant to
our present understanding of marriage and of the nature of
the rights secured by the Constitution. Women do not lose
their constitutionally protected liberty when they marry.
The Constitution protects all individuals, male or female,
married or unmarried, from the abuse of governmental
power, even where that power is employed for the supposed
benefit of a member of the individual's family. These considerations confirm our conclusion that $ 3209 is invalid.

We next consider the parental consent provision. Exceptin a medical emergency, an unemancipated young woman

under 18 may not obtain an abortion unless she and one ofher parents (or guardian) provides informed consent as defined above. If neither a parent nor a guardian providesconsent, a court may authorize the performance of an abortion upon a determination that the young woman is matureand capable of giving informed consent and has in fact given
her informed consent, or that an abortion would be in herbest interests.

We have been over most of this ground before. Our casesestablish, and we reaffirm today, that a State may require a
minor seeking an abortion to obtain the consent of a parentor guardian, provided that there is an adequate judicial bypass procedure. See, e. g., Akron II, 497 U. S., at 510-519;
Hodgson, 497 U. S., at 461 (O'Connor, J., concurring in partand concurring in judgment in part); id., at 497-501 (

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting inpart); Akron I, 462 U. S., at 440; Bellotti II, 443 U. S., at

643-644 (plurality opinion). Under these precedents, in ourview, the one-parent consent requirement and judicial bypass
procedure are constitutional.The only argument made by petitioners respecting this
provision and to which our prior decisions do not speak is thecontention that the parental consent requirement is invalid
because it requires informed parental consent. For the
most part, petitioners' argument is a reprise of their argu-ment with respect to the informed consent requirement in

general, and we reject it for the reasons given above. Indeed, some of the provisions regarding informed consenthave particular force with respect to minors: the waiting period, for example, may provide the parent or parents of apregnant young woman the opportunity to consult with her
in private, and to discuss the consequences of her decision in

the context of the values and moral or religious principlesof their family. See Hodgson, supra, at 448-449 (opinion of

Stevens, J.). E

Under the recordkeeping and reporting requirements ofthe statute, every facility which performs abortions is required to file a report stating its name and address as wellas the name and address of any related entity, such as a controlling or subsidiary organization. In the case of state-funded institutions, the information becomes public.

For each abortion performed, a report must be filed identi-fying: the physician (and the second physician where required); the facility; the referring physician or agency; thewoman's age; the number of prior pregnancies and prior
abortions she has had; gestational age; the type of abortionprocedure; the date of the abortion; whether there were any
pre-existing medical conditions which would complicatepregnancy; medical complications with the abortion; where
applicable, the basis for the determination that the abortionwas medically necessary; the weight of the aborted fetus;
and whether the woman was married, and if so, whether no-tice was provided or the basis for the failure to give notice.
Every abortion facility must also file quarterly reports show-ing the number of abortions performed broken down by trimester. See 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. $$ 3207, 3214 (1990). In allevents, the identity of each woman who has had an abortion
remains confidential.In

Danforth, 428 U. S., at 80, we held that recordkeepingand reporting provisions "that are reasonably directed to the

preservation of maternal health and that properly respect apatient's confidentiality and privacy are permissible." We
think that under this standard, all the provisions at issuehere, except that relating to spousal notice, are constitutional. Although they do not relate to the State's interestin informing the woman's choice, they do relate to health.

make abortions more difficult. Nor do we find that the re-quirements impose a substantial obstacle to a woman's
choice. At most they might increase the cost of some abor-tions by a slight amount. While at some point increased
cost could become a substantial obstacle, there is no suchshowing on the record before us.

Subsection (12) of the reporting provision requires the re-porting of, among other things, a married woman's "reason
for failure to provide notice" to her husband. $ 3214(a)(12).This provision in effect requires women, as a condition of
obtaining an abortion, to provide the Commonwealth withthe precise information we have already recognized that
many women have pressing reasons not to reveal. Like thespousal notice requirement itself, this provision places an
undue burden on a woman's choice, and must be invalidatedfor that reason.

VI
Our Constitution is a covenant running from the first gen-eration of Americans to us and then to future generations.

It is a coherent succession. Each generation must learnanew that the Constitution's written terms embody ideas and
aspirations that must survive more ages than one. We ac-cept our responsibility not to retreat from interpreting the
full meaning of the covenant in light of all of our precedents.We invoke it once again to define the freedom guaranteed by
the Constitution's own promise, the promise of liberty.

The judgment in No. 91-902 is affirmed. The judgmentin No. 91-744 is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the

case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opin-ion, including consideration of the question of severability.

It is so ordered.

PA. v. CASEY

Opinion of Stevens, J.

I
The Court is unquestionably correct in concluding that thedoctrine of

stare decisis has controlling significance in a caseof this kind, notwithstanding an individual Justice's concerns

about the merits.1 The central holding of Roe v. Wade, 410U. S. 113 (1973), has been a "part of our law" for almost two
decades. Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth,428 U. S. 52, 101 (1976) (

Stevens, J., concurring in part anddissenting in part). It was a natural sequel to the protection of individual liberty established in Griswold v. Con-necticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965). See also Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U. S. 678, 687, 702 (1977)(

White, J., concurring in part and concurring in result).The societal costs of overruling

Roe at this late date wouldbe enormous. Roe is an integral part of a correct understanding of both the concept of liberty and the basic equalityof men and women.

Stare decisis also provides a sufficient basis for my agree-ment with the joint opinion's reaffirmation of

Roe's post-viability analysis. Specifically, I accept the proposition that

"[i]f the State is interested in protecting fetal life after via-bility, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion during that
period, except when it is necessary to preserve the life orhealth of the mother." 410 U. S., at 163-164; see

ante, at879.

I also accept what is implicit in the Court's analysis,namely, a reaffirmation of Roe's explanation of why the
State's obligation to protect the life or health of the mother

1 It is sometimes useful to view the issue of stare decisis from a historical perspective. In the last 19 years, 15 Justices have confronted the basic
issue presented in Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973). Of those, 11 have
voted as the majority does today: Chief Justice Burger, Justices Douglas, Brennan, Stewart, Marshall, and Powell, and Justices Blackmun,
O'Connor, Kennedy, Souter, and myself. Only four--all of whom happen to be on the Court today--have reached the opposite conclusion.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
must take precedence over any duty to the unborn. TheCourt in Roe carefully considered, and rejected, the State's

argument "that the fetus is a `person' within the languageand meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment." 410 U. S., at
156. After analyzing the usage of "person" in the Constitu-tion, the Court concluded that that word "has application
only postnatally." Id., at 157. Commenting on the contin-gent property interests of the unborn that are generally represented by guardians ad litem, the Court noted: "Perfectionof the interests involved, again, has generally been contingent upon live birth. In short, the unborn have never beenrecognized in the law as persons in the whole sense."

Id.,at 162. Accordingly, an abortion is not "the termination of

life entitled to Fourteenth Amendment protection." Id., at159. From this holding, there was no dissent, see

id., at 173;indeed, no Member of the Court has ever questioned this

fundamental proposition. Thus, as a matter of federal con-stitutional law, a developing organism that is not yet a "person" does not have what is sometimes described as a "rightto life."

2 This has been and, by the Court's holding today,

2 Professor Dworkin has made this comment on the issue:
"The suggestion that states are free to declare a fetus a person. . . .
assumes that a state can curtail some persons' constitutional rights by
adding new persons to the constitutional population. The constitutional
rights of one citizen are of course very much affected by who or what else
also has constitutional rights, because the rights of others may compete
or conflict with his. So any power to increase the constitutional population by unilateral decision would be, in effect, a power to decrease rights
the national Constitution grants to others.

". . . If a state could declare trees to be persons with a constitutional
right to life, it could prohibit publishing newspapers or books in spite
of the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech, which could not be
understood as a license to kill. . . . Once we understand that the suggestion
we are considering has that implication, we must reject it. If a fetus is
not part of the constitutional population, under the national constitutional
arrangement, then states have no power to overrule that national arrangement by themselves declaring that fetuses have rights competitive with

Opinion of Stevens, J.

remains a fundamental premise of our constitutional lawgoverning reproductive autonomy.

II
My disagreement with the joint opinion begins with itsunderstanding of the trimester framework established in

Roe. Contrary to the suggestion of the joint opinion, ante,at 876, it is not a "contradiction" to recognize that the State
may have a legitimate interest in potential human life and,at the same time, to conclude that that interest does not
justify the regulation of abortion before viability (althoughother interests, such as maternal health, may). The fact
that the State's interest is legitimate does not tell us when,if ever, that interest outweighs the pregnant woman's interest in personal liberty. It is appropriate, therefore, to con-sider more carefully the nature of the interests at stake.

First, it is clear that, in order to be legitimate, the State'sinterest must be secular; consistent with the First Amendment the State may not promote a theological or sectarianinterest. See Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747, 778 (1986) (Stevens,
J., concurring); see generally Webster v. Reproductive HealthServices, 492 U. S. 490, 563-572 (1989) (

Stevens, J., concur-ring in part and dissenting in part). Moreover, as discussed

above, the state interest in potential human life is not aninterest

in loco parentis, for the fetus is not a person.Identifying the State's interests--which the States rarely

articulate with any precision--makes clear that the interestin protecting potential life is not grounded in the Constitution. It is, instead, an indirect interest supported by bothhumanitarian and pragmatic concerns. Many of our citizens
believe that any abortion reflects an unacceptable disrespectfor potential human life and that the performance of more

the constitutional rights of pregnant women." Unenumerated Rights:
Whether and How Roe Should be Overruled, 59 U. Chi. L. Rev. 381, 400-
401 (1992).

Opinion of Stevens, J.
than a million abortions each year is intolerable; many findthird-trimester abortions performed when the fetus is approaching personhood particularly offensive. The State hasa legitimate interest in minimizing such offense. The State
may also have a broader interest in expanding the popula-tion,

3 believing society would benefit from the services of

additional productive citizens--or that the potential humanlives might include the occasional Mozart or Curie. These

are the kinds of concerns that comprise the State's interestin potential human life.

In counterpoise is the woman's constitutional interest inliberty. One aspect of this liberty is a right to bodily integrity, a right to control one's person. See, e. g., Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165 (1952); Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel.
Williamson, 316 U. S. 535 (1942). This right is neutral onthe question of abortion: The Constitution would be equally

offended by an absolute requirement that all women undergoabortions as by an absolute prohibition on abortions. "Our
whole constitutional heritage rebels at the thought of givinggovernment the power to control men's minds."

Stanley v.
Georgia, 394 U. S. 557, 565 (1969). The same holds true for
the power to control women's bodies.The woman's constitutional liberty interest also involves

her freedom to decide matters of the highest privacy andthe most personal nature. Cf.

Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589,

3 The state interest in protecting potential life may be compared to the
state interest in protecting those who seek to immigrate to this country.
A contemporary example is provided by the Haitians who have risked the
perils of the sea in a desperate attempt to become "persons" protected by
our laws. Humanitarian and practical concerns would support a state policy allowing those persons unrestricted entry; countervailing interests in
population control support a policy of limiting the entry of these potential
citizens. While the state interest in population control might be sufficient
to justify strict enforcement of the immigration laws, that interest would
not be sufficient to overcome a woman's liberty interest. Thus, a state
interest in population control could not justify a state-imposed limit on
family size or, for that matter, state-mandated abortions.

PA. v. CASEY

Opinion of Stevens, J.

598-600 (1977). A woman considering abortion faces "a dif-ficult choice having serious and personal consequences of

major importance to her own future--perhaps to the salva-tion of her own immortal soul."

Thornburgh, 476 U. S., at
781. The authority to make such traumatic and yet empowering decisions is an element of basic human dignity. As thejoint opinion so eloquently demonstrates, a woman's decision

to terminate her pregnancy is nothing less than a matterof conscience.

Weighing the State's interest in potential life and thewoman's liberty interest, I agree with the joint opinion that
the State may " ` "expres[s] a preference for normal childbirth," ' " that the State may take steps to ensure that a
woman's choice "is thoughtful and informed," and that
"States are free to enact laws to provide a reasonable framework for a woman to make a decision that has such profound
and lasting meaning." Ante, at 872-873. Serious questions
arise, however, when a State attempts to "persuade the
woman to choose childbirth over abortion." Ante, at 878.
Decisional autonomy must limit the State's power to inject
into a woman's most personal deliberations its own views of
what is best. The State may promote its preferences
by funding childbirth, by creating and maintaining alternatives to abortion, and by espousing the virtues of family; but
it must respect the individual's freedom to make such
judgments.

This theme runs throughout our decisions concerning reproductive freedom. In general, Roe's requirement that restrictions on abortions before viability be justified by the
State's interest in maternal health has prevented States
from interjecting regulations designed to influence a woman's decision. Thus, we have upheld regulations of abortion
that are not efforts to sway or direct a woman's choice, but
rather are efforts to enhance the deliberative quality of that
decision or are neutral regulations on the health aspects of
her decision. We have, for example, upheld regulations re505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:04 PAGES OPINPGT

quiring written informed consent, see Planned Parenthood
of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52 (1976); limited recordkeeping and reporting, see ibid.; and pathology reports,see

Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v.
Ashcroft, 462 U. S. 476 (1983); as well as various licensing
and qualification provisions, see, e. g., Roe, 410 U. S., at 150;
Simopoulos v. Virginia, 462 U. S. 506 (1983). Conversely,
we have consistently rejected state efforts to prejudice awoman's choice, either by limiting the information available

to her, see Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809 (1975), or by"requir[ing] the delivery of information designed `to influence the woman's informed choice between abortion or childbirth.' " Thornburgh, 476 U. S., at 760; see also Akron v.
Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416,
442-449 (1983).

In my opinion, the principles established in this long line
of cases and the wisdom reflected in Justice Powell's opinion
for the Court in Akron (and followed by the Court just six
years ago in Thornburgh) should govern our decision today.
Under these principles, Pa. Cons. Stat. $$ 3205(a)(2)(i)-(iii)
(1990) of the Pennsylvania statute are unconstitutional.
Those sections require a physician or counselor to provide
the woman with a range of materials clearly designed to persuade her to choose not to undergo the abortion. While the
Commonwealth is free, pursuant to $ 3208 of the Pennsylvania law, to produce and disseminate such material, the Commonwealth may not inject such information into the woman's
deliberations just as she is weighing such an important
choice.

Under this same analysis, $$ 3205(a)(1)(i) and (iii) of the
Pennsylvania statute are constitutional. Those sections,
which require the physician to inform a woman of the nature
and risks of the abortion procedure and the medical risks of
carrying to term, are neutral requirements comparable to
those imposed in other medical procedures. Those sections
indicate no effort by the Commonwealth to influence the

woman's choice in any way. If anything, such requirementsenhance, rather than skew, the woman's decisionmaking.

III
The 24-hour waiting period required by $$ 3205(a)(1)-(2) ofthe Pennsylvania statute raises even more serious concerns.

Such a requirement arguably furthers the Commonwealth'sinterests in two ways, neither of which is constitutionally
permissible.First, it may be argued that the 24-hour delay is justified
by the mere fact that it is likely to reduce the number ofabortions, thus furthering the Commonwealth's interest in
potential life. But such an argument would justify any formof coercion that placed an obstacle in the woman's path. The
Commonwealth cannot further its interests by simply wear-ing down the ability of the pregnant woman to exercise her
constitutional right.Second, it can more reasonably be argued that the 24-hour
delay furthers the Commonwealth's interest in ensuring thatthe woman's decision is informed and thoughtful. But there
is no evidence that the mandated delay benefits women orthat it is necessary to enable the physician to convey any
relevant information to the patient. The mandatory delaythus appears to rest on outmoded and unacceptable assumptions about the decisionmaking capacity of women. Whilethere are well-established and consistently maintained reasons for the Commonwealth to view with skepticism the abil-ity of minors to make decisions, see

Hodgson v. Minnesota,497 U. S. 417, 449 (1990),
4 none of those reasons applies to an

4 As we noted in that opinion, the State's "legitimate interest in protecting minor women from their own immaturity" distinguished that case from
Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416 (1983),
which involved "a provision that required that mature women, capable
of consenting to an abortion, wait 24 hours after giving consent before
undergoing an abortion." Hodgson, 497 U. S., at 449, n. 35.

adult woman's decisionmaking ability. Just as we have leftbehind the belief that a woman must consult her husband

before undertaking serious matters, see ante, at 895-898, sowe must reject the notion that a woman is less capable of
deciding matters of gravity. Cf. Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71(1971).

In the alternative, the delay requirement may be premisedon the belief that the decision to terminate a pregnancy is
presumptively wrong. This premise is illegitimate. Those
who disagree vehemently about the legality and morality ofabortion agree about one thing: The decision to terminate a

pregnancy is profound and difficult. No person undertakes
such a decision lightly--and States may not presume that awoman has failed to reflect adequately merely because her

conclusion differs from the State's preference. A womanwho has, in the privacy of her thoughts and conscience,
weighed the options and made her decision cannot be forcedto reconsider all, simply because the State believes she has
come to the wrong conclusion.5

5 The joint opinion's reliance on the indirect effects of the regulation of
constitutionally protected activity, see ante, at 873-874, is misplaced; what
matters is not only the effect of a regulation but also the reason for the
regulation. As I explained in Hodgson:

"In cases involving abortion, as in cases involving the right to travel or
the right to marry, the identification of the constitutionally protected interest is merely the beginning of the analysis. State regulation of travel
and of marriage is obviously permissible even though a State may not
categorically exclude nonresidents from its borders, Shapiro v. Thompson,
394 U. S. 618, 631 (1969), or deny prisoners the right to marry, Turner v.
Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 94-99 (1987). But the regulation of constitutionally
protected decisions, such as where a person shall reside or whom he or
she shall marry, must be predicated on legitimate state concerns other
than disagreement with the choice the individual has made. Cf. Turner
v. Safley, supra; Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 12 (1967). In the abortion
area, a State may have no obligation to spend its own money, or use its
own facilities, to subsidize nontherapeutic abortions for minors or adults.
See, e. g., Maher v. Roe, 432 U. S. 464 (1977); cf. Webster v. Reproductive

PA. v. CASEY

Opinion of Stevens, J.

Part of the constitutional liberty to choose is the equaldignity to which each of us is entitled. A woman who decides to terminate her pregnancy is entitled to the same re-spect as a woman who decides to carry the fetus to term.
The mandatory waiting period denies women that equal
respect. IV

In my opinion, a correct application of the "undue burden"
standard leads to the same conclusion concerning the consti-tutionality of these requirements. A state-imposed burden

on the exercise of a constitutional right is measured both by
its effects and by its character: A burden may be "undue"
either because the burden is too severe or because it lacks a
legitimate, rational justification.6

The 24-hour delay requirement fails both parts of this test.
The findings of the District Court establish the severity of

Health Services, 492 U. S. 490, 508-511 (1989); id., at 523-524 (O'Connor,
J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). A State's value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion may provide adequate support for
decisions involving such allocation of public funds, but not for simply substituting a state decision for an individual decision that a woman has a
right to make for herself. Otherwise, the interest in liberty protected by
the Due Process Clause would be a nullity. A state policy favoring childbirth over abortion is not in itself a sufficient justification for overriding
the woman's decision or for placing `obstacles--absolute or otherwise--in
the pregnant woman's path to an abortion.' " 497 U. S., at 435.

6 The meaning of any legal standard can only be understood by reviewing the actual cases in which it is applied. For that reason, I discount
both Justice Scalia's comments on past descriptions of the standard, see
post, at 988-990 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in
part), and the attempt to give it crystal clarity in the joint opinion. The
several opinions supporting the judgment in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381
U. S. 479 (1965), are less illuminating than the central holding of the case,
which appears to have passed the test of time. The future may also demonstrate that a standard that analyzes both the severity of a regulatory
burden and the legitimacy of its justification will provide a fully adequate
framework for the review of abortion legislation even if the contours of
the standard are not authoritatively articulated in any single opinion.

the burden that the 24-hour delay imposes on many pregnantwomen. Yet even in those cases in which the delay is not

especially onerous, it is, in my opinion, "undue" becausethere is no evidence that such a delay serves a useful and
legitimate purpose. As indicated above, there is no legiti-mate reason to require a woman who has agonized over her
decision to leave the clinic or hospital and return again an-other day. While a general requirement that a physician notify her patients about the risks of a proposed medical proce-dure is appropriate, a rigid requirement that all patients wait
24 hours or (what is true in practice) much longer to evaluatethe significance of information that is either common knowledge or irrelevant is an irrational and, therefore, "undue"burden.

The counseling provisions are similarly infirm. Whenevergovernment commands private citizens to speak or to listen,
careful review of the justification for that command is partic-ularly appropriate. In these cases, the Pennsylvania statute
directs that counselors provide women seeking abortionswith information concerning alternatives to abortion, the
availability of medical assistance benefits, and the possibilityof child-support payments. $$ 3205(a)(2)(i)-(iii). The statute requires that this information be given to all womenseeking abortions, including those for whom such information is clearly useless, such as those who are married, thosewho have undergone the procedure in the past and are fully
aware of the options, and those who are fully convinced thatabortion is their only reasonable option. Moreover, the
statute requires physicians to inform all of their patientsof "[t]he probable gestational age of the unborn child."

$ 3205(a)(1)(ii). This information is of little decisional valuein most cases, because 90% of all abortions are performed
during the first trimester 7 when fetal age has less relevancethan when the fetus nears viability. Nor can the informa7 U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Statistical Abstract of

requirements in $ 3205(a)(1)(ii) and $$ 3205(a)(2)(i)-(iii) do notserve a useful purpose and thus constitute an unnecessary--
and therefore undue--burden on the woman's constitutionalliberty to decide to terminate her pregnancy.

Accordingly, while I disagree with Parts IV, V-B, and V-Dof the joint opinion,

8 I join the remainder of the Court's

opinion.

Justice Blackmun, concurring in part, concurring in thejudgment in part, and dissenting in part.

I join Parts I, II, III, V-A, V-C, and VI of the joint opin-ion of

Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, ante.Three years ago, in

Webster v. Reproductive Health Serv-ices, 492 U. S. 490 (1989), four Members of this Court appeared poised to "cas[t] into darkness the hopes and visionsof every woman in this country" who had come to believe
that the Constitution guaranteed her the right to reproduc-tive choice.

Id., at 557 (Blackmun, J., dissenting). See id.,at 499 (plurality opinion of

Rehnquist, C. J., joined by
White and Kennedy, JJ.); id., at 532 (Scalia, J., concurringin part and concurring in judgment). All that remained between the promise of Roe and the darkness of the pluralitywas a single, flickering flame. Decisions since Webster gave
little reason to hope that this flame would cast much light.See,

e. g., Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497U. S. 502, 524 (1990) (

Blackmun, J., dissenting). But now,just when so many expected the darkness to fall, the flame

has grown bright.

8 Although I agree that a parental-consent requirement (with the appropriate bypass) is constitutional, I do not join Part V-D of the joint opinion
because its approval of Pennsylvania's informed parental-consent requirement is based on the reasons given in Part V-B, with which I disagree.

I do not underestimate the significance of today's jointopinion. Yet I remain steadfast in my belief that the right

to reproductive choice is entitled to the full protectionafforded by this Court before Webster. And I fear for the
darkness as four Justices anxiously await the single votenecessary to extinguish the light.

I
Make no mistake, the joint opinion of Justices O'Connor,
Kennedy, and Souter is an act of personal courage andconstitutional principle. In contrast to previous decisions in

which Justices O'Connor and Kennedy postponed recon-sideration of Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), the authors
of the joint opinion today join Justice Stevens and me inconcluding that "the essential holding of Roe v. Wade should
be retained and once again reaffirmed." Ante, at 846. Inbrief, five Members of this Court today recognize that "the
Constitution protects a woman's right to terminate her preg-nancy in its early stages."

Ante, at 844.A fervent view of individual liberty and the force of stare

decisis have led the Court to this conclusion. Ante, at 853.Today a majority reaffirms that the Due Process Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment establishes "a realm of personalliberty which the government may not enter,"

ante, at 847--a realm whose outer limits cannot be determined by interpretations of the Constitution that focus only on the specificpractices of States at the time the Fourteenth Amendment
was adopted. See ante, at 848-849. Included within thisrealm of liberty is " `the right of the individual, married or
single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusioninto matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.' " Ante, at 851, quot-ing

Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438, 453 (1972) (emphasisin original). "These matters, involving the most intimate

and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choicescentral to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the

liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment." Ante, at
851 (emphasis added). Finally, the Court today recognizes
that in the case of abortion, "the liberty of the woman is at
stake in a sense unique to the human condition and so unique
to the law. The mother who carries a child to full term is
subject to anxieties, to physical constraints, to pain that only
she must bear." Ante, at 852.

The Court's reaffirmation of Roe's central holding is also
based on the force of stare decisis. "[N]o erosion of principle going to liberty or personal autonomy has left Roe's
central holding a doctrinal remnant; Roe portends no developments at odds with other precedent for the analysis of
personal liberty; and no changes of fact have rendered viability more or less appropriate as the point at which the balance
of interests tips." Ante, at 860-861. Indeed, the Court acknowledges that Roe's limitation on state power could not be
removed "without serious inequity to those who have relied
upon it or significant damage to the stability of the society
governed by it." Ante, at 855. In the 19 years since Roe
was decided, that case has shaped more than reproductive
planning--"[a]n entire generation has come of age free to assume Roe's concept of liberty in defining the capacity of
women to act in society, and to make reproductive decisions."
Ante, at 860. The Court understands that, having "call[ed]
the contending sides . . . to end their national division by
accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution,"
ante, at 867, a decision to overrule Roe "would seriously
weaken the Court's capacity to exercise the judicial power
and to function as the Supreme Court of a Nation dedicated
to the rule of law." Ante, at 865. What has happened
today should serve as a model for future Justices and a warning to all who have tried to turn this Court into yet another
political branch.

In striking down the Pennsylvania statute's spousal notification requirement, the Court has established a framework

925Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992)
Opinion of Blackmun, J.
for evaluating abortion regulations that responds to the social context of women facing issues of reproductive choice.1
In determining the burden imposed by the challenged regulation, the Court inquires whether the regulation's "purpose
or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a
woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability." Ante, at 878 (emphasis added). The Court reaffirms:
"The proper focus of constitutional inquiry is the group for
whom the law is a restriction, not the group for whom the
law is irrelevant." Ante, at 894. Looking at this group, the
Court inquires, based on expert testimony, empirical studies,
and common sense, whether "in a large fraction of the cases
in which [the restriction] is relevant, it will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice to undergo an abortion." Ante, at 895. "A statute with this purpose is invalid
because the means chosen by the State to further the interest in potential life must be calculated to inform the woman's
free choice, not hinder it." Ante, at 877. And in applying
its test, the Court remains sensitive to the unique role of
women in the decisionmaking process. Whatever may have
been the practice when the Fourteenth Amendment was
adopted, the Court observes, "[w]omen do not lose their constitutionally protected liberty when they marry. The Constitution protects all individuals, male or female, married or
unmarried, from the abuse of governmental power, even
where that power is employed for the supposed benefit of a
member of the individual's family." Ante, at 898.2

1 As I shall explain, the joint opinion and I disagree on the appropriate
standard of review for abortion regulations. I do agree, however, that
the reasons advanced by the joint opinion suffice to invalidate the spousal
notification requirement under a strict scrutiny standard.

2 I also join the Court's decision to uphold the medical emergency provision. As the Court notes, its interpretation is consistent with the essential holding of Roe that "forbids a State to interfere with a woman's
choice to undergo an abortion procedure if continuing her pregnancy

Lastly, while I believe that the joint opinion errs in failingto invalidate the other regulations, I am pleased that the

joint opinion has not ruled out the possibility that these reg-ulations may be shown to impose an unconstitutional burden.
The joint opinion makes clear that its specific holdings arebased on the insufficiency of the record before it. See,

e. g.,ante, at 885-886. I am confident that in the future evidence

will be produced to show that "in a large fraction of the casesin which [these regulations are] relevant, [they] will operate
as a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice to undergo anabortion." Ante, at 895.

II
Today, no less than yesterday, the Constitution and deci-sions of this Court require that a State's abortion restrictions be subjected to the strictest judicial scrutiny. Ourprecedents and the joint opinion's principles require us to
subject all non-de-minimis abortion regulations to strictscrutiny. Under this standard, the Pennsylvania statute's
provisions requiring content-based counseling, a 24-hourdelay, informed parental consent, and reporting of abortionrelated information must be invalidated.

A
The Court today reaffirms the long recognized rights ofprivacy and bodily integrity. As early as 1891, the Court

held, "[n]o right is held more sacred, or is more carefullyguarded by the common law, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person, free fromall restraint or interference of others . . . ." Union Pacific
R. Co. v. Botsford, 141 U. S. 250, 251 (1891). Throughoutthis century, this Court also has held that the fundamental
right of privacy protects citizens against governmental inwould constitute a threat to her health." Ante, at 880. As is apparent
in my analysis below, however, this exception does not render constitutional the provisions which I conclude do not survive strict scrutiny.

trusion in such intimate family matters as procreation, child-rearing, marriage, and contraceptive choice. See

ante, at
847-849. These cases embody the principle that personaldecisions that profoundly affect bodily integrity, identity,

and destiny should be largely beyond the reach of government. Eisenstadt, 405 U. S., at 453. In Roe v. Wade, thisCourt correctly applied these principles to a woman's right

to choose abortion.State restrictions on abortion violate a woman's right of
privacy in two ways. First, compelled continuation of apregnancy infringes upon a woman's right to bodily integrity
by imposing substantial physical intrusions and significantrisks of physical harm. During pregnancy, women experience dramatic physical changes and a wide range of health
consequences. Labor and delivery pose additional healthrisks and physical demands. In short, restrictive abortion

laws force women to endure physical invasions far more substantial than those this Court has held to violate the constitutional principle of bodily integrity in other contexts. See,
e. g., Winston v. Lee, 470 U. S. 753 (1985) (invalidating surgical removal of bullet from murder suspect); Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165 (1952) (invalidating stomach pumping).3

Further, when the State restricts a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy, it deprives a woman of the right to
make her own decision about reproduction and family planning--critical life choices that this Court long has deemed
central to the right to privacy. The decision to terminate or
continue a pregnancy has no less an impact on a woman's life
than decisions about contraception or marriage. 410 U. S.,

3 As the joint opinion acknowledges, ante, at 857, this Court has recognized the vital liberty interest of persons in refusing unwanted medical
treatment. Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261 (1990).
Just as the Due Process Clause protects the deeply personal decision of
the individual to refuse medical treatment, it also must protect the deeply
personal decision to obtain medical treatment, including a woman's decision to terminate a pregnancy.

at 153. Because motherhood has a dramatic impact on a
woman's educational prospects, employment opportunities,
and self-determination, restrictive abortion laws deprive her
of basic control over her life. For these reasons, "the decision whether or not to beget or bear a child" lies at "the very
heart of this cluster of constitutionally protected choices."
Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U. S. 678,
685 (1977).

A State's restrictions on a woman's right to terminate her
pregnancy also implicate constitutional guarantees of gender
equality. State restrictions on abortion compel women to
continue pregnancies they otherwise might terminate. By
restricting the right to terminate pregnancies, the State conscripts women's bodies into its service, forcing women to continue their pregnancies, suffer the pains of childbirth, and in
most instances, provide years of maternal care. The State
does not compensate women for their services; instead, it
assumes that they owe this duty as a matter of course. This
assumption--that women can simply be forced to accept the
"natural" status and incidents of motherhood--appears to
rest upon a conception of women's role that has triggered
the protection of the Equal Protection Clause. See, e. g.,
Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718, 724-
726 (1982); Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 198-199 (1976).4
The joint opinion recognizes that these assumptions about
women's place in society "are no longer consistent with our

4 A growing number of commentators are recognizing this point. See,

Ante, at 897.

The Court has held that limitations on the right of privacy
are permissible only if they survive "strict" constitutionalscrutiny--that is, only if the governmental entity imposing

the restriction can demonstrate that the limitation is bothnecessary and narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479,485 (1965). We have applied this principle specifically in the
context of abortion regulations. Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S., at
155.5

Roe implemented these principles through a framework
that was designed "to ensure that the woman's right to
choose not become so subordinate to the State's interest in
promoting fetal life that her choice exists in theory but not
in fact," ante, at 872. Roe identified two relevant state interests: "an interest in preserving and protecting the health
of the pregnant woman" and an interest in "protecting the
potentiality of human life." 410 U. S., at 162. With respect
to the State's interest in the health of the mother, "the `compelling' point . . . is at approximately the end of the first
trimester," because it is at that point that the mortality rate
in abortion approaches that in childbirth. Id., at 163. With
respect to the State's interest in potential life, "the `compelling' point is at viability," because it is at that point that the

5 To say that restrictions on a right are subject to strict scrutiny is not
to say that the right is absolute. Regulations can be upheld if they have
no significant impact on the woman's exercise of her right and are justified
by important state health objectives. See, e. g., Planned Parenthood of
Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, 65-67, 79-81 (1976) (upholding requirements of a woman's written consent and recordkeeping). But the
Court today reaffirms the essential principle of Roe that a woman has the
right "to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the State." Ante, at 846. Under Roe, any
more than de minimis interference is undue.

fetus "presumably has the capability of meaningful life out-side the mother's womb." Ibid. In order to fulfill the requirement of narrow tailoring, "the State is obligated tomake a reasonable effort to limit the effect of its regulations
to the period in the trimester during which its health inter-est will be furthered."

Akron v. Akron Center for Repro-ductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416, 434 (1983).

In my view, application of this analytical framework is noless warranted than when it was approved by seven Members of this Court in Roe. Strict scrutiny of state limita-tions on reproductive choice still offers the most secure protection of the woman's right to make her own reproductivedecisions, free from state coercion. No majority of this
Court has ever agreed upon an alternative approach. Thefactual premises of the trimester framework have not been
undermined, see Webster, 492 U. S., at 553 (Blackmun, J.,dissenting), and the

Roe framework is far more administra-ble, and far less manipulable, than the "undue burden" standard adopted by the joint opinion.Nonetheless, three criticisms of the trimester framework
continue to be uttered. First, the trimester framework isattacked because its key elements do not appear in the text
of the Constitution. My response to this attack remains thesame as it was in

Webster:

"Were this a true concern, we would have to abandonmost of our constitutional jurisprudence. [T]he `critical

elements' of countless constitutional doctrines nowhereappear in the Constitution's text . . . . The Constitution
makes no mention, for example, of the First Amend-ment's `actual malice' standard for proving certain libels,
see New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964).. . . Similarly, the Constitution makes no mention of the
rational-basis test, or the specific verbal formulations ofintermediate and strict scrutiny by which this Court
evaluates claims under the Equal Protection Clause.The reason is simple. Like the Roe framework, these

tests or standards are not, and do not purport to be,rights protected by the Constitution. Rather, they are

judge-made methods for evaluating and measuring thestrength and scope of constitutional rights or for balancing the constitutional rights of individuals against the
competing interests of government." Id., at 548.

The second criticism is that the framework more closelyresembles a regulatory code than a body of constitutional

doctrine. Again, my answer remains the same as in
Webster:

"[I]f this were a true and genuine concern, we wouldhave to abandon vast areas of our constitutional

jurisprudence. . . . Are [the distinctions entailed in thetrimester framework] any finer, or more `regulatory,'
than the distinctions we have often drawn in our First
Amendment jurisprudence, where, for example, we haveheld that a `release time' program permitting publicschool students to leave school grounds during schoolhours to receive religious instruction does not violate
the Establishment Clause, even though a release-timeprogram permitting religious instruction on school
grounds does violate the Clause? Compare Zorach v.
Clauson, 343 U. S. 306 (1952), with Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Education of School Dist. No. 71,
Champaign County, 333 U. S. 203 (1948). . . . Similarly,in a Sixth Amendment case, the Court held that although an overnight ban on attorney-client communica-tion violated the constitutionally guaranteed right to
counsel, Geders v. United States, 425 U. S. 80 (1976), that

right was not violated when a trial judge separated a
defendant from his lawyer during a 15-minute recess
after the defendant's direct testimony. Perry v. Leeke,
488 U. S. 272 (1989).

"That numerous constitutional doctrines result in narrow differentiations between similar circumstances does

not mean that this Court has abandoned adjudication infavor of regulation."

Id., at 549-550.

The final, and more genuine, criticism of the trimesterframework is that it fails to find the State's interest in potential human life compelling throughout pregnancy. No Mem-ber of this Court--nor for that matter, the Solicitor General,
see Tr. of Oral Arg. 42--has ever questioned our holding in
Roe that an abortion is not "the termination of life entitled
to Fourteenth Amendment protection." 410 U. S., at 159.Accordingly, a State's interest in protecting fetal life is not

grounded in the Constitution. Nor, consistent with our Establishment Clause, can it be a theological or sectarian inter-est. See

Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747, 778 (1986) (Stevens, J.,concurring). It is, instead, a legitimate interest grounded in

humanitarian or pragmatic concerns. See ante, at 914-915(

Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).

But while a State has "legitimate interests from the outsetof the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and

the life of the fetus that may become a child," ante, at 846,
legitimate interests are not enough. To overcome the bur-den of strict scrutiny, the interests must be compelling. The

question then is how best to accommodate the State's inter-est in potential human life with the constitutional liberties
of pregnant women. Again, I stand by the views I ex-pressed in

Webster:

"I remain convinced, as six other Members of this Court16 years ago were convinced, that the

Roe framework,
and the viability standard in particular, fairly, sensibly,
and effectively functions to safeguard the constitutional
liberties of pregnant women while recognizing and accommodating the State's interest in potential human life.
The viability line reflects the biological facts and truths
of fetal development; it marks that threshold moment
prior to which a fetus cannot survive separate from the

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
woman and cannot reasonably and objectively be re-garded as a subject of rights or interests distinct from,

or paramount to, those of the pregnant woman. At thesame time, the viability standard takes account of the
undeniable fact that as the fetus evolves into its postna-tal form, and as it loses its dependence on the uterine
environment, the State's interest in the fetus' potentialhuman life, and in fostering a regard for human life in
general, becomes compelling. As a practical matter, be-cause viability follows `quickening'--the point at which
a woman feels movement in her womb--and because via-bility occurs no earlier than 23 weeks gestational age, it
establishes an easily applicable standard for regulatingabortion while providing a pregnant woman ample time
to exercise her fundamental right with her responsiblephysician to terminate her pregnancy." 492 U. S., at
553-554.6
Roe's trimester framework does not ignore the State's in-terest in prenatal life. Like

Justice Stevens, ante, at 916,I agree that the State may take steps to ensure that a woman's choice "is thoughtful and informed," ante, at 872, andthat "States are free to enact laws to provide a reasonable
framework for a woman to make a decision that has suchprofound and lasting meaning." Ante, at 873. But

"[s]erious questions arise . . . when a State attempts topersuade the woman to choose childbirth over abortion.
Ante, at 878. Decisional autonomy must limit theState's power to inject into a woman's most personal deliberations its own views of what is best. The Statemay promote its preferences by funding childbirth, by
creating and maintaining alternatives to abortion, andby espousing the virtues of family; but it must respect

6 The joint opinion agrees with Roe's conclusion that viability occurs at
23 or 24 weeks at the earliest. Compare ante, at 860, with Roe v. Wade,
410 U. S. 113, 160 (1973).

the individual's freedom to make such judgments."Ante, at 916 (

Stevens, J., concurring in part and dis-senting in part) (internal quotation marks omitted).

As the joint opinion recognizes, "the means chosen by theState to further the interest in potential life must be calculated to inform the woman's free choice, not hinder it."
Ante, at 877.In sum, Roe's requirement of strict scrutiny as implemented through a trimester framework should not be dis-turbed. No other approach has gained a majority, and no
other is more protective of the woman's fundamental right.Lastly, no other approach properly accommodates the woman's constitutional right with the State's legitimate interests.

C
Application of the strict scrutiny standard results in theinvalidation of all the challenged provisions. Indeed, as this

Court has invalidated virtually identical provisions in priorcases,

stare decisis requires that we again strike them down.This Court has upheld informed- and written-consent requirements only where the State has demonstrated that theygenuinely further important health-related state concerns.
See Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428U. S. 52, 65-67 (1976). A State may not, under the guise of
securing informed consent, "require the delivery of informa-tion `designed to influence the woman's informed choice between abortion or childbirth.' " Thornburgh, 476 U. S., at760, quoting

Akron, 462 U. S., at 443-444. Rigid require-ments that a specific body of information be imparted to a

woman in all cases, regardless of the needs of the patient,improperly intrude upon the discretion of the pregnant
woman's physician and thereby impose an " `undesired anduncomfortable straitjacket.' "

Thornburgh, 476 U. S., at762, quoting Danforth, 428 U. S., at 67, n. 8.

Measured against these principles, some aspects of thePennsylvania informed-consent scheme are unconstitutional.

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
While it is unobjectionable for the Commonwealth to requirethat the patient be informed of the nature of the procedure,

the health risks of the abortion and of childbirth, and theprobable gestational age of the unborn child, compare Pa.
Cons. Stat. $$ 3205(a)(i)-(iii) (1990) with Akron, 462 U. S., at446, n. 37, I remain unconvinced that there is a vital state
need for insisting that the information be provided by a phy-sician rather than a counselor.

Id., at 448. The DistrictCourt found that the physician-only requirement necessarily

would increase costs to the plaintiff clinics, costs that un-doubtedly would be passed on to patients. And because
trained women counselors are often more understandingthan physicians, and generally have more time to spend with
patients, see App. 366-387, the physician-only disclosure re-quirement is not narrowly tailored to serve the Commonwealth's interest in protecting maternal health.Sections 3205(a)(2)(i)-(iii) of the Act further requires that
the physician or a qualified nonphysician inform the womanthat printed materials are available from the Commonwealth
that describe the fetus and provide information about medi-cal assistance for childbirth, information about child support
from the father, and a list of agencies offering adoption andother services as alternatives to abortion. Thornburgh invalidated biased patient-counseling requirements virtuallyidentical to the one at issue here. What we said of those
requirements fully applies in these cases:

"[T]he listing of agencies in the printed Pennsylvaniaform presents serious problems; it contains names of

agencies that well may be out of step with the needs ofthe particular woman and thus places the physician in
an awkward position and infringes upon his or herprofessional responsibilities. Forcing the physician or
counselor to present the materials and the list to thewoman makes him or her in effect an agent of the State
in treating the woman and places his or her imprimaturupon both the materials and the list. All this is, or

comes close to being, state medicine imposed upon thewoman, not the professional medical guidance she seeks,

and it officially structures--as it obviously was intendedto do--the dialogue between the woman and her
physician."The requirements . . . that the woman be advised
that medical assistance benefits may be available, andthat the father is responsible for financial assistance in
the support of the child similarly are poorly disguisedelements of discouragement for the abortion decision.
Much of this . . . , for many patients, would be irrelevantand inappropriate. For a patient with a life-threatening
pregnancy, the `information' in its very rendition maybe cruel as well as destructive of the physician-patient
relationship. As any experienced social worker orother counselor knows, theoretical financial responsibility often does not equate with fulfillment . . . . Underthe guise of informed consent, the Act requires the dissemination of information that is not relevant to suchconsent, and, thus, it advances no legitimate state interest." 476 U. S., at 762-763 (citation omitted).
"This type of compelled information is the antithesis ofinformed consent,"

id., at 764, and goes far beyond merelydescribing the general subject matter relevant to the woman's decision. "That the Commonwealth does not, andsurely would not, compel similar disclosure of every possible
peril of necessary surgery or of simple vaccination, revealsthe anti-abortion character of the statute and its real purpose." Ibid.7

7 While I do not agree with the joint opinion's conclusion that these
provisions should be upheld, the joint opinion has remained faithful to
principles this Court previously has announced in examining counseling
provisions. For example, the joint opinion concludes that the "information the State requires to be made available to the woman" must be
"truthful and not misleading." Ante, at 882. Because the State's information must be "calculated to inform the woman's free choice, not hinder

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
The 24-hour waiting period following the provision of the
foregoing information is also clearly unconstitutional. The
District Court found that the mandatory 24-hour delay could
lead to delays in excess of 24 hours, thus increasing health
risks, and that it would require two visits to the abortion
provider, thereby increasing travel time, exposure to further
harassment, and financial cost. Finally, the District Court
found that the requirement would pose especially significant
burdens on women living in rural areas and those women
that have difficulty explaining their whereabouts. 744 F.
Supp. 1323, 1378-1379 (ED Pa. 1990). In Akron this Court
invalidated a similarly arbitrary or inflexible waiting period
because, as here, it furthered no legitimate state interest.8

As Justice Stevens insightfully concludes, the mandatory delay rests either on outmoded or unacceptable assumptions about the decisionmaking capacity of women or
the belief that the decision to terminate the pregnancy is

it," ante, at 877, the measures must be designed to ensure that a woman's
choice is "mature and informed," ante, at 883, not intimidated, imposed,
or impelled. To this end, when the State requires the provision of certain
information, the State may not alter the manner of presentation in order
to inflict "psychological abuse," ante, at 893, designed to shock or unnerve
a woman seeking to exercise her liberty right. This, for example, would
appear to preclude a State from requiring a woman to view graphic literature or films detailing the performance of an abortion operation. Just as
a visual preview of an operation to remove an appendix plays no part in a
physician's securing informed consent to an appendectomy, a preview of
scenes appurtenant to any major medical intrusion into the human body
does not constructively inform the decision of a woman of the State's interest in the preservation of the woman's health or demonstrate the State's
"profound respect for the life of the unborn." Ante, at 877.

8 The Court's decision in Hodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U. S. 417 (1990),

validating a 48-hour waiting period for minors seeking an abortion to permit parental involvement does not alter this conclusion. Here the 24-hour
delay is imposed on an adult woman. See id., at 449-450, n. 35; Ohio v.
Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 497 U. S. 502 (1990). Moreover, the statute in Hodgson did not require any delay once the minor
obtained the affirmative consent of either a parent or the court.

presumptively wrong. Ante, at 918-919. The requirementthat women consider this obvious and slanted information for

an additional 24 hours contained in these provisions will onlyinfluence the woman's decision in improper ways. The vast
majority of women will know this information--of the fewthat do not, it is less likely that their minds will be changed
by this information than it will be either by the realizationthat the State opposes their choice or the need once again to
endure abuse and harassment on return to the clinic.9Except in the case of a medical emergency, $ 3206 requires
a physician to obtain the informed consent of a parent orguardian before performing an abortion on an unemancipated minor or an incompetent woman. Based on evidencein the record, the District Court concluded that, in order to
fulfill the informed-consent requirement, generally acceptedmedical principles would require an in-person visit by the
parent to the facility. 744 F. Supp., at 1382. Although theCourt "has recognized that the State has somewhat broader
authority to regulate the activities of children than ofadults," the State nevertheless must demonstrate that there
is a "significant state interest in conditioning an abortion . . .that is not present in the case of an adult." Danforth, 428
U. S., at 74-75 (emphasis added). The requirement of an in-person visit would carry with it the risk of a delay of several
days or possibly weeks, even where the parent is willing toconsent. While the State has an interest in encouraging parental involvement in the minor's abortion decision, $ 3206 isnot narrowly drawn to serve that interest.

10

9 Because this information is so widely known, I am confident that a
developed record can be made to show that the 24-hour delay, "in a large
fraction of the cases in which [the restriction] is relevant, . . . will operate
as a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice to undergo an abortion."
Ante, at 895.

10 The judicial-bypass provision does not cure this violation. Hodgson is

distinguishable, since these cases involve more than parental involvement
or approval--rather, the Pennsylvania law requires that the parent receive
information designed to discourage abortion in a face-to-face meeting with

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
Finally, the Pennsylvania statute requires every facility
performing abortions to report its activities to the Commonwealth. Pennsylvania contends that this requirement is
valid under Danforth, in which this Court held that recordkeeping and reporting requirements that are reasonably directed to the preservation of maternal health and that properly respect a patient's confidentiality are permissible. Id.,
at 79-81. The Commonwealth attempts to justify its required reports on the ground that the public has a right to
know how its tax dollars are spent. A regulation designed
to inform the public about public expenditures does not further the Commonwealth's interest in protecting maternal
health. Accordingly, such a regulation cannot justify a legally significant burden on a woman's right to obtain an
abortion.

The confidential reports concerning the identities and
medical judgment of physicians involved in abortions at first
glance may seem valid, given the Commonwealth's interest
in maternal health and enforcement of the Act. The District
Court found, however, that, notwithstanding the confidentiality protections, many physicians, particularly those who
have previously discontinued performing abortions because
of harassment, would refuse to refer patients to abortion
clinics if their names were to appear on these reports. 744
F. Supp., at 1392. The Commonwealth has failed to show
that the name of the referring physician either adds to the
pool of scientific knowledge concerning abortion or is reasonably related to the Commonwealth's interest in maternal
health. I therefore agree with the District Court's conclusion that the confidential reporting requirements are unconthe physician. The bypass procedure cannot ensure that the parent would
obtain the information, since in many instances, the parent would not even
attend the hearing. A State may not place any restriction on a young
woman's right to an abortion, however irrational, simply because it has
provided a judicial bypass.

stitutional insofar as they require the name of the referringphysician and the basis for his or her medical judgment.

In sum, I would affirm the judgment in No. 91-902 andreverse the judgment in No. 91-744 and remand the cases
for further proceedings. III

At long last, The Chief Justice and those who havejoined him admit it. Gone are the contentions that the issue
need not be (or has not been) considered. There, on the firstpage, for all to see, is what was expected: "We believe that
Roe was wrongly decided, and that it can and should be over-ruled consistently with our traditional approach to

stare de-cisis in constitutional cases." Post, at 944. If there is much

reason to applaud the advances made by the joint opiniontoday, there is far more to fear from

The Chief Justice'sopinion.

The Chief Justice's criticism of Roe follows from hisstunted conception of individual liberty. While recognizing
that the Due Process Clause protects more than simple phys-ical liberty, he then goes on to construe this Court's personalliberty cases as establishing only a laundry list of particularrights, rather than a principled account of how these particular rights are grounded in a more general right of privacy.
Post, at 951. This constricted view is reinforced by The
Chief Justice's exclusive reliance on tradition as a sourceof fundamental rights. He argues that the record in favor

of a right to abortion is no stronger than the record in Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U. S. 110 (1989), where the plural-ity found no fundamental right to visitation privileges by an

adulterous father, or in Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186(1986), where the Court found no fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy, or in a case involving the " `fir-ing [of] a gun . . . into another person's body.' "

Post, at951-952. In
The Chief Justice's world, a woman consider-ing whether to terminate a pregnancy is entitled to no more

protection than adulterers, murderers, and so-called sexual

deviates.11 Given The Chief Justice's exclusive relianceon tradition, people using contraceptives seem the next likely

candidate for his list of outcasts.Even more shocking than

The Chief Justice's crampednotion of individual liberty is his complete omission of any

discussion of the effects that compelled childbirth and moth-erhood have on women's lives. The only expression of concern with women's health is purely instrumental--for The
Chief Justice, only women's psychological health is a con-cern, and only to the extent that he assumes that every

woman who decides to have an abortion does so without seri-ous consideration of the moral implications of her decision.
Post, at 967-968. In short, The Chief Justice's view ofthe State's compelling interest in maternal health has less
to do with health than it does with compelling women tobe maternal.

Nor does The Chief Justice give any serious consider-ation to the doctrine of stare decisis. For

The Chief Justice, the facts that gave rise to Roe are surprisingly simple:"women become pregnant, there is a point somewhere, depending on medical technology, where a fetus becomes via-ble, and women give birth to children."

Post, at 955. Thischaracterization of the issue thus allows
The Chief Justicequickly to discard the joint opinion's reliance argument by

asserting that "reproductive planning could take virtuallyimmediate account of " a decision overruling

Roe. Post, at956 (internal quotation marks omitted).

The Chief Justice's narrow conception of individual lib-erty and

stare decisis leads him to propose the same stand-ard of review proposed by the plurality in Webster. "States

may regulate abortion procedures in ways rationally relatedto a legitimate state interest. Williamson v. Lee Optical of
Oklahoma, Inc., 348 U. S. 483, 491 (1955); cf. Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U. S. 645, 651-653 (1972)." Post, at 966. The

11 Obviously, I do not share The Chief Justice's views of homosexuality as sexual deviance. See Bowers, 478 U. S., at 202-203, n. 2.

Chief Justice then further weakens the test by providing
an insurmountable requirement for facial challenges: Petitioners must " `show that no set of circumstances exists
under which the [provision] would be valid.' " Post, at 973,
quoting Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497
U. S., at 514. In short, in his view, petitioners must prove
that the statute cannot constitutionally be applied to anyone.
Finally, in applying his standard to the spousal-notification
provision, The Chief Justice contends that the record
lacks any "hard evidence" to support the joint opinion's contention that a "large fraction" of women who prefer not to
notify their husbands involve situations of battered women
and unreported spousal assault. Post, at 974, n. 2. Yet
throughout the explication of his standard, The Chief Justice never explains what hard evidence is, how large a fraction is required, or how a battered woman is supposed to
pursue an as-applied challenge.

Under his standard, States can ban abortion if that ban is
rationally related to a legitimate state interest--a standard
which the United States calls "deferential, but not toothless." Yet when pressed at oral argument to describe the
teeth, the best protection that the Solicitor General could
offer to women was that a prohibition, enforced by criminal
penalties, with no exception for the life of the mother, "could
raise very serious questions." Tr. of Oral Arg. 48. Perhaps, the Solicitor General offered, the failure to include an
exemption for the life of the mother would be "arbitrary and
capricious." Id., at 49. If, as The Chief Justice contends, the undue burden test is made out of whole cloth,
the so-called "arbitrary and capricious" limit is the Solicitor
General's "new clothes."

Even if it is somehow "irrational" for a State to require
a woman to risk her life for her child, what protection is
offered for women who become pregnant through rape or
incest? Is there anything arbitrary or capricious about a

State's prohibiting the sins of the father from being visitedupon his offspring?

12

But, we are reassured, there is always the protection ofthe democratic process. While there is much to be praised

about our democracy, our country since its founding has rec-ognized that there are certain fundamental liberties that are
not to be left to the whims of an election. A woman's rightto reproductive choice is one of those fundamental liberties.
Accordingly, that liberty need not seek refuge at the ballotbox.

IV
In one sense, the Court's approach is worlds apart fromthat of

The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia. And yet,in another sense, the distance between the two approaches

is short--the distance is but a single vote.I am 83 years old. I cannot remain on this Court forever,
and when I do step down, the confirmation process for mysuccessor well may focus on the issue before us today. That,
I regret, may be exactly where the choice between the twoworlds will be made.

12 Justice Scalia urges the Court to "get out of this area," post, at
1002, and leave questions regarding abortion entirely to the States, post,
at 999-1000. Putting aside the fact that what he advocates is nothing
short of an abdication by the Court of its constitutional responsibilities,
Justice Scalia is uncharacteristically naive if he thinks that overruling
Roe and holding that restrictions on a woman's right to an abortion are
subject only to rational-basis review will enable the Court henceforth to
avoid reviewing abortion-related issues. State efforts to regulate and
prohibit abortion in a post-Roe world undoubtedly would raise a host of
distinct and important constitutional questions meriting review by this
Court. For example, does the Eighth Amendment impose any limits on
the degree or kind of punishment a State can inflict upon physicians who
perform, or women who undergo, abortions? What effect would differences among States in their approaches to abortion have on a woman's
right to engage in interstate travel? Does the First Amendment permit
States that choose not to criminalize abortion to ban all advertising providing information about where and how to obtain abortions?

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice White,
Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas join, concurring inthe judgment in part and dissenting in part.

The joint opinion, following its newly minted variation on
stare decisis, retains the outer shell of Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S.113 (1973), but beats a wholesale retreat from the substance

of that case. We believe that Roe was wrongly decided, andthat it can and should be overruled consistently with our
traditional approach to stare decisis in constitutional cases.We would adopt the approach of the plurality in

Webster v.Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490 (1989), and uphold the challenged provisions of the Pennsylvania statute intheir entirety.

In ruling on this litigation below, the Court of Appeals forthe Third Circuit first observed that "this appeal does not

directly implicate Roe; this case involves the regulation ofabortions rather than their outright prohibition." 947 F. 2d
682, 687 (1991). Accordingly, the court directed its attentionto the question of the standard of review for abortion regulations. In attempting to settle on the correct standard, how-ever, the court confronted the confused state of this Court's
abortion jurisprudence. After considering the several opin-ions in

Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, supra, andHodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U. S. 417 (1990), the Court of Appeals concluded that Justice O'Connor's "undue burden"test was controlling, as that was the narrowest ground on

requiring a woman to notify her spouse of an intendedabortion.

In arguing that this Court should invalidate each of theprovisions at issue, petitioners insist that we reaffirm our
decision in Roe v. Wade, supra, in which we held unconstitu-tional a Texas statute making it a crime to procure an abortion except to save the life of the mother.1 We agree withthe Court of Appeals that our decision in

Roe is not directlyimplicated by the Pennsylvania statute, which does not prohibit, but simply regulates, abortion. But, as the Court ofAppeals found, the state of our post-Roe decisional law dealing with the regulation of abortion is confusing and uncer-tain, indicating that a reexamination of that line of cases is in
order. Unfortunately for those who must apply this Court'sdecisions, the reexamination undertaken today leaves the
Court no less divided than beforehand. Although they re-ject the trimester framework that formed the underpinning
of Roe, Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter adopta revised undue burden standard to analyze the challenged
regulations. We conclude, however, that such an outcome isan unjustified constitutional compromise, one which leaves
the Court in a position to closely scrutinize all types of abor-tion regulations despite the fact that it lacks the power to
do so under the Constitution.In Roe, the Court opined that the State "does have an
important and legitimate interest in preserving and protect-ing the health of the pregnant woman, . . . and that it has
still another important and legitimate interest in protecting

1 Two years after Roe, the West German constitutional court, by contrast, struck down a law liberalizing access to abortion on the grounds
that life developing within the womb is constitutionally protected. Judgment of February 25, 1975, 39 BVerfGE 1 (translated in Jonas & Gorby,
West German Abortion Decision: A Contrast to Roe v. Wade, 9 John Marshall J. Prac. & Proc. 605 (1976)). In 1988, the Canadian Supreme Court
followed reasoning similar to that of Roe in striking down a law that restricted abortion. Morgentaler v. Queen, 1 S. C. R. 30, 44 D. L. R. 4th
385 (1988).

the potentiality of human life." 410 U. S., at 162 (emphasisomitted). In the companion case of

Doe v. Bolton, 410 U. S.
179 (1973), the Court referred to its conclusion in Roe "thata pregnant woman does not have an absolute constitutional

right to an abortion on her demand." 410 U. S., at 189. But
while the language and holdings of these cases appeared toleave States free to regulate abortion procedures in a variety

of ways, later decisions based on them have found consider-ably less latitude for such regulations than might have been
expected.For example, after

Roe, many States have sought to protect their young citizens by requiring that a minor seeking
an abortion involve her parents in the decision. Some
States have simply required notification of the parents, while
others have required a minor to obtain the consent of her
parents. In a number of decisions, however, the Court has
substantially limited the States in their ability to impose
such requirements. With regard to parental notice requirements, we initially held that a State could require a minor
to notify her parents before proceeding with an abortion.
H. L. v. Matheson, 450 U. S. 398, 407-410 (1981). Recently,
however, we indicated that a State's ability to impose a notice requirement actually depends on whether it requires notice of one or both parents. We concluded that although the
Constitution might allow a State to demand that notice be
given to one parent prior to an abortion, it may not require
that similar notice be given to two parents, unless the State
incorporates a judicial bypass procedure in that two-parent
requirement. Hodgson v. Minnesota, supra.

We have treated parental consent provisions even more
harshly. Three years after Roe, we invalidated a Missouri
regulation requiring that an unmarried woman under the age
of 18 obtain the consent of one of her parents before proceeding
with an abortion. We held that our abortion jurisprudence
prohibited the State from imposing such a "blanket provision
. . . requiring the consent of a parent." Planned Parenthood

of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, 74 (1976). In Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U. S. 622 (1979), the Court struck down a
similar Massachusetts parental consent statute. A majorityof the Court indicated, however, that a State could constitutionally require parental consent, if it alternatively allowed
a pregnant minor to obtain an abortion without parental con-sent by showing either that she was mature enough to make

her own decision, or that the abortion would be in her bestinterests. See

id., at 643-644 (plurality opinion); id., at 656-
657 (White, J., dissenting). In light of Bellotti, we haveupheld one parental consent regulation which incorporated a

judicial bypass option we viewed as sufficient, see Planned
Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v. Ashcroft, 462
U. S. 476 (1983), but have invalidated another because of our
belief that the judicial procedure did not satisfy the dictates
of Bellotti, see Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive
Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416, 439-442 (1983). We have never
had occasion, as we have in the parental notice context, to
further parse our parental consent jurisprudence into oneparent and two-parent components.

In Roe, the Court observed that certain States recognized
the right of the father to participate in the abortion decision
in certain circumstances. Because neither Roe nor Doe involved the assertion of any paternal right, the Court expressly stated that the case did not disturb the validity of
regulations that protected such a right. Roe v. Wade, supra,
at 165, n. 67. But three years later, in Danforth, the Court
extended its abortion jurisprudence and held that a State
could not require that a woman obtain the consent of her
spouse before proceeding with an abortion. Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S., at 69-71.

States have also regularly tried to ensure that a woman's
decision to have an abortion is an informed and wellconsidered one. In Danforth, we upheld a requirement that
a woman sign a consent form prior to her abortion, and observed that "it is desirable and imperative that [the decision]

be made with full knowledge of its nature and conse-quences."

Id., at 67. Since that case, however, we have
twice invalidated state statutes designed to impart suchknowledge to a woman seeking an abortion. In

Akron, we
held unconstitutional a regulation requiring a physician to
inform a woman seeking an abortion of the status of herpregnancy, the development of her fetus, the date of possible

viability, the complications that could result from an abor-tion, and the availability of agencies providing assistance and
information with respect to adoption and childbirth. Akronv.

Akron Center for Reproductive Health, supra, at 442-445.
More recently, in Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747 (1986), we struck
down a more limited Pennsylvania regulation requiring that
a woman be informed of the risks associated with the abortion procedure and the assistance available to her if she decided to proceed with her pregnancy, because we saw the
compelled information as "the antithesis of informed consent." Id., at 764. Even when a State has sought only to
provide information that, in our view, was consistent with
the Roe framework, we concluded that the State could not
require that a physician furnish the information, but instead
had to alternatively allow nonphysician counselors to provide
it. Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 462
U. S., at 448-449. In Akron as well, we went further and
held that a State may not require a physician to wait 24
hours to perform an abortion after receiving the consent of
a woman. Although the State sought to ensure that the
woman's decision was carefully considered, the Court concluded that the Constitution forbade the State to impose any
sort of delay. Id., at 449-451.

We have not allowed States much leeway to regulate even
the actual abortion procedure. Although a State can require that second-trimester abortions be performed in outpatient clinics, see Simopoulos v. Virginia, 462 U. S. 506 (1983),
we concluded in Akron and Ashcroft that a State could not

require that such abortions be performed only in hospitals.See

Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, supra,
at 437-439; Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo.,
Inc. v. Ashcroft, supra, at 481-482. Despite the fact that
Roe expressly allowed regulation after the first trimester in
furtherance of maternal health, " `present medical knowl-edge,' " in our view, could not justify such a hospitalization

requirement under the trimester framework. Akron v.
Akron Center for Reproductive Health, supra, at 437 (quoting Roe v. Wade, supra, at 163). And in Danforth, the Courtheld that Missouri could not outlaw the saline amniocentesis

method of abortion, concluding that the Missouri Legislature
had "failed to appreciate and to consider several significant
facts" in making its decision. 428 U. S., at 77.

Although Roe allowed state regulation after the point of
viability to protect the potential life of the fetus, the Court
subsequently rejected attempts to regulate in this manner.
In Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U. S. 379 (1979), the Court
struck down a statute that governed the determination of
viability. Id., at 390-397. In the process, we made clear
that the trimester framework incorporated only one definition of viability--ours--as we forbade States to decide that
a certain objective indicator--"be it weeks of gestation or
fetal weight or any other single factor"--should govern the
definition of viability. Id., at 389. In that same case, we
also invalidated a regulation requiring a physician to use the
abortion technique offering the best chance for fetal survival
when performing postviability abortions. See id., at 397-
401; see also Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S., at 768-769 (invalidating a
similar regulation). In Thornburgh, the Court struck down
Pennsylvania's requirement that a second physician be present at postviability abortions to help preserve the health of
the unborn child, on the ground that it did not incorporate
a sufficient medical emergency exception. Id., at 769-771.
Regulations governing the treatment of aborted fetuses have

met a similar fate. In Akron, we invalidated a provisionrequiring physicians performing abortions to "insure that

the remains of the unborn child are disposed of in a humaneand sanitary manner." 462 U. S., at 451 (internal quotation
marks omitted).

Dissents in these cases expressed the view that the Courtwas expanding upon

Roe in imposing ever greater restrictions on the States. See Thornburgh v. American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S., at 783
(Burger, C. J., dissenting) ("The extent to which the Courthas departed from the limitations expressed in

Roe is readily
apparent"); id., at 814 (White, J., dissenting) ("[T]he majority indiscriminately strikes down statutory provisions that
in no way contravene the right recognized in Roe"). And,
when confronted with state regulations of this type in past
years, the Court has become increasingly more divided: The
three most recent abortion cases have not commanded a
Court opinion. See Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive
Health, 497 U. S. 502 (1990); Hodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U. S.
417 (1990); Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492
U. S. 490 (1989).

The task of the Court of Appeals in the present cases was
obviously complicated by this confusion and uncertainty.
Following Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188 (1977), it
concluded that in light of Webster and Hodgson, the strict
scrutiny standard enunciated in Roe was no longer applicable, and that the "undue burden" standard adopted by Justice O'Connor was the governing principle. This state of
confusion and disagreement warrants reexamination of the
"fundamental right" accorded to a woman's decision to abort
a fetus in Roe, with its concomitant requirement that any
state regulation of abortion survive "strict scrutiny." See
Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827-828 (1991) (observing
that reexamination of constitutional decisions is appropriate
when those decisions have generated uncertainty and failed
to provide clear guidance, because "correction through legis505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT

lative action is practically impossible" (internal quotationmarks omitted));

Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 546-547, 557 (1985).We have held that a liberty interest protected under the

Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment will be
deemed fundamental if it is "implicit in the concept of or-dered liberty."

Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319, 325
(1937). Three years earlier, in Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291U. S. 97 (1934), we referred to a "principle of justice so rooted

in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be rankedas fundamental."

Id., at 105; see also Michael H. v. Gerald
D., 491 U. S. 110, 122 (1989) (plurality opinion) (citing the language from Snyder). These expressions are admittedly not
precise, but our decisions implementing this notion of "fundamental" rights do not afford any more elaborate basis on
which to base such a classification.

In construing the phrase "liberty" incorporated in the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, we have recognized that its meaning extends beyond freedom from physical restraint. In Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510
(1925), we held that it included a parent's right to send a
child to private school; in Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390
(1923), we held that it included a right to teach a foreign
language in a parochial school. Building on these cases, we
have held that the term "liberty" includes a right to marry,
Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967); a right to procreate,
Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S. 535
(1942); and a right to use contraceptives, Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965); Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S.
438 (1972). But a reading of these opinions makes clear that
they do not endorse any all-encompassing "right of privacy."

In Roe v. Wade, the Court recognized a "guarantee of personal privacy" which "is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy."
410 U. S., at 152-153. We are now of the view that, in terming this right fundamental, the Court in Roe read the earlier

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.

opinions upon which it based its decision much too broadly.Unlike marriage, procreation, and contraception, abortion

"involves the purposeful termination of a potential life."
Harris v. McRae, 448 U. S. 297, 325 (1980). The abortion
decision must therefore "be recognized as sui generis, different in kind from the others that the Court has protectedunder the rubric of personal or family privacy and autonomy." Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists, supra, at 792 (White, J., dissenting).
One cannot ignore the fact that a woman is not isolated inher pregnancy, and that the decision to abort necessarily involves the destruction of a fetus. See Michael H. v. Gerald
D., supra, at 124, n. 4 (To look "at the act which is assertedly
the subject of a liberty interest in isolation from its effect
upon other people [is] like inquiring whether there is a liberty interest in firing a gun where the case at hand happens
to involve its discharge into another person's body").

Nor do the historical traditions of the American people
support the view that the right to terminate one's pregnancy
is "fundamental." The common law which we inherited
from England made abortion after "quickening" an offense.
At the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment,
statutory prohibitions or restrictions on abortion were commonplace; in 1868, at least 28 of the then-37 States and 8
Territories had statutes banning or limiting abortion. J.
Mohr, Abortion in America 200 (1978). By the turn of the
century virtually every State had a law prohibiting or restricting abortion on its books. By the middle of the present
century, a liberalization trend had set in. But 21 of the restrictive abortion laws in effect in 1868 were still in effect in
1973 when Roe was decided, and an overwhelming majority
of the States prohibited abortion unless necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother. Roe v. Wade, 410
U. S., at 139-140; id., at 176-177, n. 2 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). On this record, it can scarcely be said that any deeply
rooted tradition of relatively unrestricted abortion in our his505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT

953Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992)
Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
tory supported the classification of the right to abortion as"fundamental" under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.We think, therefore, both in view of this history and of our
decided cases dealing with substantive liberty under the DueProcess Clause, that the Court was mistaken in

Roe when itclassified a woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy as

a "fundamental right" that could be abridged only in a man-ner which withstood "strict scrutiny." In so concluding, we
repeat the observation made in Bowers v. Hardwick, 478U. S. 186 (1986):

"Nor are we inclined to take a more expansive viewof our authority to discover new fundamental rights imbedded in the Due Process Clause. The Court is mostvulnerable and comes nearest to illegitimacy when it
deals with judge-made constitutional law having littleor no cognizable roots in the language or design of the
Constitution." Id., at 194.
We believe that the sort of constitutionally imposed abor-tion code of the type illustrated by our decisions following

Roe is inconsistent "with the notion of a Constitution cast ingeneral terms, as ours is, and usually speaking in general
principles, as ours does." Webster v. Reproductive HealthServices, 492 U. S., at 518 (plurality opinion). The Court in
Roe reached too far when it analogized the right to abort afetus to the rights involved in

Pierce, Meyer, Loving, andGriswold, and thereby deemed the right to abortion

fundamental. II

The joint opinion of Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and
Souter cannot bring itself to say that Roe was correct as anoriginal matter, but the authors are of the view that "the

immediate question is not the soundness of Roe's resolutionof the issue, but the precedential force that must be accorded
to its holding." Ante, at 871. Instead of claiming that Roe

505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT
954 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN

PA. v. CASEY

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.

was correct as a matter of original constitutional interpreta-tion, the opinion therefore contains an elaborate discussion of

stare decisis. This discussion of the principle of stare decisisappears to be almost entirely dicta, because the joint opinion
does not apply that principle in dealing with Roe. Roe decided that a woman had a fundamental right to an abortion.The joint opinion rejects that view.

Roe decided that abortion regulations were to be subjected to "strict scrutiny" andcould be justified only in the light of "compelling state interests." The joint opinion rejects that view. Ante, at872-873; see

Roe v. Wade, supra, at 162-164. Roe analyzed
abortion regulation under a rigid trimester framework, aframework which has guided this Court's decisionmaking

for 19 years. The joint opinion rejects that framework.
Ante, at 873.

Stare decisis is defined in Black's Law Dictionary as meaning "to abide by, or adhere to, decided cases." Black's LawDictionary 1406 (6th ed. 1990). Whatever the "central holding" of Roe that is left after the joint opinion finishes dissect-ing it is surely not the result of that principle. While purporting to adhere to precedent, the joint opinion insteadrevises it.

Roe continues to exist, but only in the way a
storefront on a western movie set exists: a mere facade to
give the illusion of reality. Decisions following Roe, such as
Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462
U. S. 416 (1983), and Thornburgh v. American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747 (1986), are
frankly overruled in part under the "undue burden" standard
expounded in the joint opinion. Ante, at 881-884.

In our view, authentic principles of stare decisis do not
require that any portion of the reasoning in Roe be kept intact. "Stare decisis is not . . . a universal, inexorable command," especially in cases involving the interpretation of the
Federal Constitution. Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co.,
285 U. S. 393, 405 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). Erroneous decisions in such constitutional cases are uniquely durable, because correction through legislative action, save for

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
constitutional amendment, is impossible. It is therefore our
duty to reconsider constitutional interpretations that "depar[t] from a proper understanding" of the Constitution.
Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469
U. S., at 557; see United States v. Scott, 437 U. S. 82, 101
(1978) (" `[I]n cases involving the Federal Constitution, . . .
[t]he Court bows to the lessons of experience and the force
of better reasoning, recognizing that the process of trial and
error, so fruitful in the physical sciences, is appropriate also
in the judicial function' " (quoting Burnet v. Coronado Oil &
Gas Co., supra, at 406-408 (Brandeis, J., dissenting))); Smith
v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649, 665 (1944). Our constitutional
watch does not cease merely because we have spoken before
on an issue; when it becomes clear that a prior constitutional
interpretation is unsound we are obliged to reexamine the
question. See, e. g., West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette,
319 U. S. 624, 642 (1943); Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S.
64, 74-78 (1938).

The joint opinion discusses several stare decisis factors
which, it asserts, point toward retaining a portion of Roe.
Two of these factors are that the main "factual underpinning" of Roe has remained the same, and that its doctrinal
foundation is no weaker now than it was in 1973. Ante, at
857-860. Of course, what might be called the basic facts
which gave rise to Roe have remained the same--women become pregnant, there is a point somewhere, depending on
medical technology, where a fetus becomes viable, and
women give birth to children. But this is only to say that the
same facts which gave rise to Roe will continue to give rise to
similar cases. It is not a reason, in and of itself, why those
cases must be decided in the same incorrect manner as was
the first case to deal with the question. And surely there is
no requirement, in considering whether to depart from stare
decisis in a constitutional case, that a decision be more wrong
now than it was at the time it was rendered. If that were
true, the most outlandish constitutional decision could sur505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT
956 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN

PA. v. CASEY

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.

vive forever, based simply on the fact that it was no moreoutlandish later than it was when originally rendered.

Nor does the joint opinion faithfully follow this alleged re-quirement. The opinion frankly concludes that

Roe and its
progeny were wrong in failing to recognize that the State's
interests in maternal health and in the protection of unbornhuman life exist throughout pregnancy.

Ante, at 871-873.
But there is no indication that these components of Roe areany more incorrect at this juncture than they were at its

inception.The joint opinion also points to the reliance interests involved in this context in its effort to explain why precedent
must be followed for precedent's sake. Certainly it is true
that where reliance is truly at issue, as in the case of judicial
decisions that have formed the basis for private decisions,
"[c]onsiderations in favor of stare decisis are at their acme."
Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S., at 828. But, as the joint opinion apparently agrees, ante, at 855-856, any traditional notion of reliance is not applicable here. The Court today cuts
back on the protection afforded by Roe, and no one claims
that this action defeats any reliance interest in the disavowed trimester framework. Similarly, reliance interests
would not be diminished were the Court to go further and
acknowledge the full error of Roe, as "reproductive planning
could take virtually immediate account of " this action.
Ante, at 856.

The joint opinion thus turns to what can only be described
as an unconventional--and unconvincing--notion of reliance,
a view based on the surmise that the availability of abortion
since Roe has led to "two decades of economic and social
developments" that would be undercut if the error of Roe
were recognized. Ante, at 856. The joint opinion's assertion of this fact is undeveloped and totally conclusory. In
fact, one cannot be sure to what economic and social developments the opinion is referring. Surely it is dubious to suggest that women have reached their "places in society" in

505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT

957Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992)
Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
reliance upon Roe, rather than as a result of their determina-tion to obtain higher education and compete with men in the

job market, and of society's increasing recognition of theirability to fill positions that were previously thought to be
reserved only for men. Ante, at 856.

In the end, having failed to put forth any evidence to proveany true reliance, the joint opinion's argument is based solely

on generalized assertions about the national psyche, on a be-lief that the people of this country have grown accustomed
to the Roe decision over the last 19 years and have "orderedtheir thinking and living around" it.

Ante, at 856. As an
initial matter, one might inquire how the joint opinion can
view the "central holding" of Roe as so deeply rooted in our
constitutional culture, when it so casually uproots and disposes of that same decision's trimester framework. Furthermore, at various points in the past, the same could have been
said about this Court's erroneous decisions that the Constitution allowed "separate but equal" treatment of minorities,
see Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 (1896), or that "liberty"
under the Due Process Clause protected "freedom of contract," see Adkins v. Children's Hospital of District of Columbia, 261 U. S. 525 (1923); Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S.
45 (1905). The "separate but equal" doctrine lasted 58 years
after Plessy, and Lochner's protection of contractual freedom lasted 32 years. However, the simple fact that a generation or more had grown used to these major decisions did
not prevent the Court from correcting its errors in those
cases, nor should it prevent us from correctly interpreting
the Constitution here. See Brown v. Board of Education,
347 U. S. 483 (1954) (rejecting the "separate but equal" doctrine); West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937)
(overruling Adkins v. Children's Hospital, supra, in upholding Washington's minimum wage law).

Apparently realizing that conventional stare decisis principles do not support its position, the joint opinion advances a
belief that retaining a portion of Roe is necessary to protect

the "legitimacy" of this Court. Ante, at 861-869. Becausethe Court must take care to render decisions "grounded

truly in principle," and not simply as political and social com-promises,

ante, at 865, the joint opinion properly declares it
to be this Court's duty to ignore the public criticism and
protest that may arise as a result of a decision. Few wouldquarrel with this statement, although it may be doubted that

Members of this Court, holding their tenure as they do dur-ing constitutional "good behavior," are at all likely to be intimidated by such public protests.But the joint opinion goes on to state that when the Court
"resolve[s] the sort of intensely divisive controversy reflected in Roe and those rare, comparable cases," its decision
is exempt from reconsideration under established principles
of stare decisis in constitutional cases. Ante, at 866. This
is so, the joint opinion contends, because in those "intensely
divisive" cases the Court has "call[ed] the contending sides
of a national controversy to end their national division by
accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution,"
and must therefore take special care not to be perceived as
"surrender[ing] to political pressure" and continued opposition. Ante, at 866, 867. This is a truly novel principle, one
which is contrary to both the Court's historical practice and
to the Court's traditional willingness to tolerate criticism of
its opinions. Under this principle, when the Court has ruled
on a divisive issue, it is apparently prevented from overruling that decision for the sole reason that it was incorrect,
unless opposition to the original decision has died away.

The first difficulty with this principle lies in its assumption
that cases that are "intensely divisive" can be readily distinguished from those that are not. The question of whether a
particular issue is "intensely divisive" enough to qualify for
special protection is entirely subjective and dependent on the
individual assumptions of the Members of this Court. In
addition, because the Court's duty is to ignore public opinion
and criticism on issues that come before it, its Members are

in perhaps the worst position to judge whether a decisiondivides the Nation deeply enough to justify such uncommon

protection. Although many of the Court's decisions dividethe populace to a large degree, we have not previously on
that account shied away from applying normal rules of stare
decisis when urged to reconsider earlier decisions. Overthe past 21 years, for example, the Court has overruled in

whole or in part 34 of its previous constitutional decisions.See

Payne v. Tennessee, supra, at 828-830, and n. 1 (listing
cases).The joint opinion picks out and discusses two prior Court

rulings that it believes are of the "intensely divisive" variety,
and concludes that they are of comparable dimension to Roe.
Ante, at 861-864 (discussing Lochner v. New York, supra,
and Plessy v. Ferguson, supra). It appears to us very odd
indeed that the joint opinion chooses as benchmarks two
cases in which the Court chose not to adhere to erroneous
constitutional precedent, but instead enhanced its stature by
acknowledging and correcting its error, apparently in violation of the joint opinion's "legitimacy" principle. See West
Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, supra; Brown v. Board of Education, supra. One might also wonder how it is that the joint
opinion puts these, and not others, in the "intensely divisive"
category, and how it assumes that these are the only two
lines of cases of comparable dimension to Roe. There is no
reason to think that either Plessy or Lochner produced the
sort of public protest when they were decided that Roe did.
There were undoubtedly large segments of the bench and
bar who agreed with the dissenting views in those cases, but
surely that cannot be what the Court means when it uses the
term "intensely divisive," or many other cases would have
to be added to the list. In terms of public protest, however,
Roe, so far as we know, was unique. But just as the Court
should not respond to that sort of protest by retreating from
the decision simply to allay the concerns of the protesters, it
should likewise not respond by determining to adhere to the

decision at all costs lest it seem to be retreating under fire.Public protests should not alter the normal application of

stare decisis, lest perfectly lawful protest activity be penal-ized by the Court itself.

Taking the joint opinion on its own terms, we doubt that
its distinction between Roe, on the one hand, and Plessy and
Lochner, on the other, withstands analysis. The joint opinion acknowledges that the Court improved its stature byoverruling

Plessy in Brown on a deeply divisive issue. And
our decision in West Coast Hotel, which overruled Adkins v.
Children's Hospital, supra, and Lochner, was rendered at
a time when Congress was considering President Franklin
Roosevelt's proposal to "reorganize" this Court and enable
him to name six additional Justices in the event that any
Member of the Court over the age of 70 did not elect to
retire. It is difficult to imagine a situation in which the
Court would face more intense opposition to a prior ruling
than it did at that time, and, under the general principle proclaimed in the joint opinion, the Court seemingly should have
responded to this opposition by stubbornly refusing to reexamine the Lochner rationale, lest it lose legitimacy by
appearing to "overrule under fire." Ante, at 867.

The joint opinion agrees that the Court's stature would
have been seriously damaged if in Brown and West Coast
Hotel it had dug in its heels and refused to apply normal
principles of stare decisis to the earlier decisions. But the
opinion contends that the Court was entitled to overrule
Plessy and Lochner in those cases, despite the existence of
opposition to the original decisions, only because both the
Nation and the Court had learned new lessons in the interim.
This is at best a feebly supported, post hoc rationalization
for those decisions.

For example, the opinion asserts that the Court could justifiably overrule its decision in Lochner only because the Depression had convinced "most people" that constitutional protection of contractual freedom contributed to an economy

961Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992)
Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
that failed to protect the welfare of all. Ante, at 861.Surely the joint opinion does not mean to suggest that people

saw this Court's failure to uphold minimum wage statutes asthe cause of the Great Depression! In any event, the

Lochner Court did not base its rule upon the policy judgment that
an unregulated market was fundamental to a stable econ-omy; it simple believed, erroneously, that "liberty" under the

Due Process Clause protected the "right to make a contract."
Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S., at 53. Nor is it the case
that the people of this Nation only discovered the dangers ofextreme laissez-faire economics because of the Depression.

State laws regulating maximum hours and minimum wages
were in existence well before that time. A Utah statute of
that sort enacted in 1896 was involved in our decision in
Holden v. Hardy, 169 U. S. 366 (1898), and other States followed suit shortly afterwards, see, e. g., Muller v. Oregon,
208 U. S. 412 (1908); Bunting v. Oregon, 243 U. S. 426 (1917).
These statutes were indeed enacted because of a belief on
the part of their sponsors that "freedom of contract" did not
protect the welfare of workers, demonstrating that that belief manifested itself more than a generation before the Great
Depression. Whether "most people" had come to share it in
the hard times of the 1930's is, insofar as anything the joint
opinion advances, entirely speculative. The crucial failing
at that time was not that workers were not paid a fair wage,
but that there was no work available at any wage.

When the Court finally recognized its error in West Coast
Hotel, it did not engage in the post hoc rationalization that
the joint opinion attributes to it today; it did not state that
Lochner had been based on an economic view that had fallen
into disfavor, and that it therefore should be overruled.
Chief Justice Hughes in his opinion for the Court simply recognized what Justice Holmes had previously recognized in
his Lochner dissent, that "[t]he Constitution does not speak
of freedom of contract." West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish,
300 U. S., at 391; Lochner v. New York, supra, at 75 (Holmes,

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.

J., dissenting) ("[A] constitution is not intended to embody aparticular economic theory, whether of paternalism and the

organic relation of the citizen to the State or of laissez
faire"). Although the Court did acknowledge in the last
paragraph of its opinion the state of affairs during the thencurrent Depression, the theme of the opinion is that theCourt had been mistaken as a matter of constitutional law

when it embraced "freedom of contract" 32 years previously.The joint opinion also agrees that the Court acted properly
in rejecting the doctrine of "separate but equal" in Brown.In fact, the opinion lauds

Brown in comparing it to Roe.
Ante, at 867. This is strange, in that under the opinion's
"legitimacy" principle the Court would seemingly have been
forced to adhere to its erroneous decision in Plessy because
of its "intensely divisive" character. To us, adherence to
Roe today under the guise of "legitimacy" would seem to
resemble more closely adherence to Plessy on the same
ground. Fortunately, the Court did not choose that option
in Brown, and instead frankly repudiated Plessy. The joint
opinion concludes that such repudiation was justified only because of newly discovered evidence that segregation had the
effect of treating one race as inferior to another. But it can
hardly be argued that this was not urged upon those who
decided Plessy, as Justice Harlan observed in his dissent that
the law at issue "puts the brand of servitude and degradation
upon a large class of our fellow-citizens, our equals before
the law." Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S., at 562. It is clear
that the same arguments made before the Court in Brown
were made in Plessy as well. The Court in Brown simply
recognized, as Justice Harlan had recognized beforehand,
that the Fourteenth Amendment does not permit racial segregation. The rule of Brown is not tied to popular opinion
about the evils of segregation; it is a judgment that the
Equal Protection Clause does not permit racial segregation,
no matter whether the public might come to believe that it
is beneficial. On that ground it stands, and on that ground

963Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992)
Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
alone the Court was justified in properly concluding that the
Plessy Court had erred.

There is also a suggestion in the joint opinion that thepropriety of overruling a "divisive" decision depends in part

on whether "most people" would now agree that it should be
overruled. Either the demise of opposition or its progres-sion to substantial popular agreement apparently is required

to allow the Court to reconsider a divisive decision. Howsuch agreement would be ascertained, short of a public opinion poll, the joint opinion does not say. But surely even thesuggestion is totally at war with the idea of "legitimacy" in
whose name it is invoked. The Judicial Branch derives its
legitimacy, not from following public opinion, but from deciding by its best lights whether legislative enactments of the
popular branches of Government comport with the Constitution. The doctrine of stare decisis is an adjunct of this duty,
and should be no more subject to the vagaries of public opinion than is the basic judicial task.

There are other reasons why the joint opinion's discussion
of legitimacy is unconvincing as well. In assuming that the
Court is perceived as "surrender[ing] to political pressure"
when it overrules a controversial decision, ante, at 867, the
joint opinion forgets that there are two sides to any controversy. The joint opinion asserts that, in order to protect its
legitimacy, the Court must refrain from overruling a controversial decision lest it be viewed as favoring those who oppose the decision. But a decision to adhere to prior precedent is subject to the same criticism, for in such a case one
can easily argue that the Court is responding to those who
have demonstrated in favor of the original decision. The
decision in Roe has engendered large demonstrations, including repeated marches on this Court and on Congress, both
in opposition to and in support of that opinion. A decision
either way on Roe can therefore be perceived as favoring
one group or the other. But this perceived dilemma arises
only if one assumes, as the joint opinion does, that the Court

964 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN

PA. v. CASEY

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.

should make its decisions with a view toward speculativepublic perceptions. If one assumes instead, as the Court

surely did in both Brown and West Coast Hotel, that theCourt's legitimacy is enhanced by faithful interpretation of
the Constitution irrespective of public opposition, such selfengendered difficulties may be put to one side.

Roe is not this Court's only decision to generate conflict.
Our decisions in some recent capital cases, and in Bowers v.
Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186 (1986), have also engendered demonstrations in opposition. The joint opinion's message to suchprotesters appears to be that they must cease their activities

in order to serve their cause, because their protests will only
cement in place a decision which by normal standards of
stare decisis should be reconsidered. Nearly a century ago,
Justice David J. Brewer of this Court, in an article discussing
criticism of its decisions, observed that "many criticisms may
be, like their authors, devoid of good taste, but better all
sorts of criticism than no criticism at all." Justice Brewer
on "The Nation's Anchor," 57 Albany L. J. 166, 169 (1898).
This was good advice to the Court then, as it is today.
Strong and often misguided criticism of a decision should not
render the decision immune from reconsideration, lest a fetish for legitimacy penalize freedom of expression.

The end result of the joint opinion's paeans of praise for
legitimacy is the enunciation of a brand new standard for
evaluating state regulation of a woman's right to abortion--
the "undue burden" standard. As indicated above, Roe v.
Wade adopted a "fundamental right" standard under which
state regulations could survive only if they met the requirement of "strict scrutiny." While we disagree with that
standard, it at least had a recognized basis in constitutional
law at the time Roe was decided. The same cannot be said
for the "undue burden" standard, which is created largely
out of whole cloth by the authors of the joint opinion. It is
a standard which even today does not command the support
of a majority of this Court. And it will not, we believe, re505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT

965Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992)
Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
sult in the sort of "simple limitation," easily applied, whichthe joint opinion anticipates.

Ante, at 855. In sum, it is a
standard which is not built to last.In evaluating abortion regulations under that standard,

judges will have to decide whether they place a "substantial
obstacle" in the path of a woman seeking an abortion. Ante,at 877. In that this standard is based even more on a judge's

subjective determinations than was the trimester frame-work, the standard will do nothing to prevent "judges from
roaming at large in the constitutional field" guided only bytheir personal views.

Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S., at
502 (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment). Because the undue
burden standard is plucked from nowhere, the question of
what is a "substantial obstacle" to abortion will undoubtedly
engender a variety of conflicting views. For example, in the
very matter before us now, the authors of the joint opinion
would uphold Pennsylvania's 24-hour waiting period, concluding that a "particular burden" on some women is not a
substantial obstacle. Ante, at 887. But the authors would
at the same time strike down Pennsylvania's spousal notice
provision, after finding that in a "large fraction" of cases the
provision will be a substantial obstacle. Ante, at 895. And,
while the authors conclude that the informed consent provisions do not constitute an "undue burden," Justice Stevens
would hold that they do. Ante, at 920-922.

Furthermore, while striking down the spousal notice regulation, the joint opinion would uphold a parental consent
restriction that certainly places very substantial obstacles in
the path of a minor's abortion choice. The joint opinion is
forthright in admitting that it draws this distinction based on
a policy judgment that parents will have the best interests of
their children at heart, while the same is not necessarily true
of husbands as to their wives. Ante, at 895. This may or
may not be a correct judgment, but it is quintessentially a
legislative one. The "undue burden" inquiry does not in any
way supply the distinction between parental consent and

966 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN

PA. v. CASEY

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.

spousal consent which the joint opinion adopts. Despite the
efforts of the joint opinion, the undue burden standard presents nothing more workable than the trimester framework
which it discards today. Under the guise of the Constitution, this Court will still impart its own preferences on the
States in the form of a complex abortion code.

The sum of the joint opinion's labors in the name of stare
decisis and "legitimacy" is this: Roe v. Wade stands as a sort
of judicial Potemkin Village, which may be pointed out to
passers-by as a monument to the importance of adhering to
precedent. But behind the facade, an entirely new method
of analysis, without any roots in constitutional law, is imported to decide the constitutionality of state laws regulating abortion. Neither stare decisis nor "legitimacy" are
truly served by such an effort.

We have stated above our belief that the Constitution does
not subject state abortion regulations to heightened scrutiny.
Accordingly, we think that the correct analysis is that set
forth by the plurality opinion in Webster. A woman's interest in having an abortion is a form of liberty protected by
the Due Process Clause, but States may regulate abortion
procedures in ways rationally related to a legitimate state
interest. Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc., 348
U. S. 483, 491 (1955); cf. Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U. S. 645,
651-653 (1972). With this rule in mind, we examine each of
the challenged provisions.

A

Section 3205 of the Act imposes certain requirements related to the informed consent of a woman seeking an abortion. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. $ 3205 (1990). Section 3205(a)(1)
requires that the referring or performing physician must inform a woman contemplating an abortion of (i) the nature of
the procedure and the risks and alternatives that a reasonable patient would find material; (ii) the fetus' probable ges505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT

967Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992)
Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
tational age; and (iii) the medical risks involved in carryingher pregnancy to term. Section 3205(a)(2) requires a physician or a nonphysician counselor to inform the woman that(i) the state health department publishes free materials describing the fetus at different stages and listing abortion alternatives; (ii) medical assistance benefits may be availablefor prenatal, childbirth, and neonatal care; and (iii) the child's

father is liable for child support. The Act also imposes a24-hour waiting period between the time that the woman
receives the required information and the time that the phy-sician is allowed to perform the abortion. See Appendix
to opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ., ante,
at 902-904.

This Court has held that it is certainly within the province
of the States to require a woman's voluntary and informed
consent to an abortion. See Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S., at 760.
Here, Pennsylvania seeks to further its legitimate interest in
obtaining informed consent by ensuring that each woman "is
aware not only of the reasons for having an abortion, but
also of the risks associated with an abortion and the availability of assistance that might make the alternative of normal childbirth more attractive than it might otherwise appear." Id., at 798-799 (White, J., dissenting).

We conclude that this provision of the statute is rationally
related to the State's interest in assuring that a woman's
consent to an abortion be a fully informed decision.

Section 3205(a)(1) requires a physician to disclose certain
information about the abortion procedure and its risks and
alternatives. This requirement is certainly no large burden,
as the Court of Appeals found that "the record shows that
the clinics, without exception, insist on providing this information to women before an abortion is performed." 947
F. 2d, at 703. We are of the view that this information
"clearly is related to maternal health and to the State's legitimate purpose in requiring informed consent." Akron v.

968 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN

PA. v. CASEY

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.

Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S., at446. An accurate description of the gestational age of the

fetus and of the risks involved in carrying a child to termhelps to further both those interests and the State's legitimate interest in unborn human life. See id., at 445-446,
n. 37 (required disclosure of gestational age of the fetus "cer-tainly is not objectionable"). Although petitioners contend

that it is unreasonable for the State to require that a physi-cian, as opposed to a nonphysician counselor, disclose this
information, we agree with the Court of Appeals that a State"may rationally decide that physicians are better qualified
than counselors to impart this information and answer questions about the medical aspects of the available alternatives."
947 F. 2d, at 704.

Section 3205(a)(2) compels the disclosure, by a physician
or a counselor, of information concerning the availability of
paternal child support and state-funded alternatives if the
woman decides to proceed with her pregnancy. Here again,
the Court of Appeals observed that "the record indicates
that most clinics already require that a counselor consult in
person with the woman about alternatives to abortion before
the abortion is performed." Id., at 704-705. And petitioners do not claim that the information required to be disclosed
by statute is in any way false or inaccurate; indeed, the
Court of Appeals found it to be "relevant, accurate, and noninflammatory." Id., at 705. We conclude that this required
presentation of "balanced information" is rationally related
to the State's legitimate interest in ensuring that the woman's consent is truly informed, Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S., at 830
(O'Connor, J., dissenting), and in addition furthers the
State's interest in preserving unborn life. That the information might create some uncertainty and persuade some
women to forgo abortions does not lead to the conclusion that
the Constitution forbids the provision of such information.
Indeed, it only demonstrates that this information might

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
very well make a difference, and that it is therefore relevant
to a woman's informed choice. Cf. id., at 801 (White, J.,
dissenting) ("[T]he ostensible objective of Roe v. Wade is
not maximizing the number of abortions, but maximizing
choice"). We acknowledge that in Thornburgh this Court
struck down informed consent requirements similar to the
ones at issue here. See id., at 760-764. It is clear, however, that while the detailed framework of Roe led to the
Court's invalidation of those informational requirements,
they "would have been sustained under any traditional
standard of judicial review, . . . or for any other surgical
procedure except abortion." Webster v. Reproductive
Health Services, 492 U. S., at 517 (plurality opinion) (citing
Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S., at 802 (White, J., dissenting); id., at 783
(Burger, C. J., dissenting)). In light of our rejection of Roe's
"fundamental right" approach to this subject, we do not regard Thornburgh as controlling.

For the same reason, we do not feel bound to follow this
Court's previous holding that a State's 24-hour mandatory
waiting period is unconstitutional. See Akron v. Akron
Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., supra, at 449-451.
Petitioners are correct that such a provision will result in
delays for some women that might not otherwise exist,
therefore placing a burden on their liberty. But the provision in no way prohibits abortions, and the informed consent
and waiting period requirements do not apply in the case of
a medical emergency. See 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. $$ 3205(a), (b)
(1990). We are of the view that, in providing time for reflection and reconsideration, the waiting period helps ensure
that a woman's decision to abort is a well-considered one, and
reasonably furthers the State's legitimate interest in maternal health and in the unborn life of the fetus. It "is surely
a small cost to impose to ensure that the woman's decision is
well considered in light of its certain and irreparable conse505us3117H 05-19-99 10:05:55 PAGES OPINPGT

quences on fetal life, and the possible effects on her own."462 U. S., at 474 (

O'Connor, J., dissenting).

B
In addition to providing her own informed consent, beforean unemancipated woman under the age of 18 may obtain an

abortion she must either furnish the consent of one of herparents, or must opt for the judicial procedure that allows
her to bypass the consent requirement. Under the judicialbypass option, a minor can obtain an abortion if a state court
finds that she is capable of giving her informed consent andhas indeed given such consent,

or determines that an abor-tion is in her best interests. Records of these court proceedings are kept confidential. The Act directs the statetrial court to render a decision within three days of the
woman's application, and the entire procedure, includingappeal to Pennsylvania Superior Court, is to last no longer
than eight business days. The parental consent require-ment does not apply in the case of a medical emergency. 18
Pa. Cons. Stat. $ 3206 (1990). See Appendix to opinion of
O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ., ante, at 904-906.This provision is entirely consistent with this Court's previous decisions involving parental consent requirements.See

Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v.Ashcroft, 462 U. S. 476 (1983) (upholding parental consent

requirement with a similar judicial bypass option); Akron v.Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., supra, at 439-
440 (approving of parental consent statutes that include ajudicial bypass option allowing a pregnant minor to "demonstrate that she is sufficiently mature to make the abortiondecision herself or that, despite her immaturity, an abortion
would be in her best interests"); Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U. S.622 (1979).

We think it beyond dispute that a State "has a strong andlegitimate interest in the welfare of its young citizens, whose
immaturity, inexperience, and lack of judgment may some505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT

times impair their ability to exercise their rights wisely."
Hodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U. S., at 444 (opinion of Stevens,
J.). A requirement of parental consent to abortion, like
myriad other restrictions placed upon minors in other contexts, is reasonably designed to further this important and
legitimate state interest. In our view, it is entirely "rational
and fair for the State to conclude that, in most instances, the
family will strive to give a lonely or even terrified minor
advice that is both compassionate and mature." Ohio v.
Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U. S., at 520
(opinion of Kennedy, J.); see also Planned Parenthood of
Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S., at 91 (Stewart, J., concurring) ("There can be little doubt that the State furthers a
constitutionally permissible end by encouraging an unmarried pregnant minor to seek the help and advice of her parents in making the very important decision whether or not
to bear a child"). We thus conclude that Pennsylvania's parental consent requirement should be upheld.

C
Section 3209 of the Act contains the spousal notification
provision. It requires that, before a physician may perform
an abortion on a married woman, the woman must sign a
statement indicating that she has notified her husband of her
planned abortion. A woman is not required to notify her
husband if (1) her husband is not the father, (2) her husband,
after diligent effort, cannot be located, (3) the pregnancy is
the result of a spousal sexual assault that has been reported
to the authorities, or (4) the woman has reason to believe
that notifying her husband is likely to result in the infliction
of bodily injury upon her by him or by another individual.
In addition, a woman is exempted from the notification requirement in the case of a medical emergency. 18 Pa. Cons.
Stat. $ 3209 (1990). See Appendix to opinion of O'Connor,
Kennedy, and Souter, JJ., ante, at 908-909.

PA. v. CASEY

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.

We first emphasize that Pennsylvania has not imposed aspousal

consent requirement of the type the Court struck
down in Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth,428 U. S., at 67-72. Missouri's spousal consent provision was

invalidated in that case because of the Court's view that it
unconstitutionally granted to the husband "a veto power ex-ercisable for any reason whatsoever or for no reason at all."

Id., at 71. But the provision here involves a much less in-trusive requirement of spousal

notification, not consent.
Such a law requiring only notice to the husband "does notgive any third party the legal right to make the [woman's]

decision for her, or to prevent her from obtaining an abortion
should she choose to have one performed." Hodgson v.
Minnesota, supra, at 496 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); see H. L. v. Matheson,
450 U. S., at 411, n. 17. Danforth thus does not control our
analysis. Petitioners contend that it should, however; they
argue that the real effect of such a notice requirement is to
give the power to husbands to veto a woman's abortion
choice. The District Court indeed found that the notification provision created a risk that some woman who would
otherwise have an abortion will be prevented from having
one. 947 F. 2d, at 712. For example, petitioners argue,
many notified husbands will prevent abortions through physical force, psychological coercion, and other types of threats.
But Pennsylvania has incorporated exceptions in the notice
provision in an attempt to deal with these problems. For
instance, a woman need not notify her husband if the pregnancy is the result of a reported sexual assault, or if she has
reason to believe that she would suffer bodily injury as a
result of the notification. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. $ 3209(b) (1990).
Furthermore, because this is a facial challenge to the Act,
it is insufficient for petitioners to show that the notification
provision "might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances." United States v. Salerno,
481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987). Thus, it is not enough for petition505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
ers to show that, in some "worst case" circumstances, the
notice provision will operate as a grant of veto power to husbands. Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497
U. S., at 514. Because they are making a facial challenge to
the provision, they must "show that no set of circumstances
exists under which the [provision] would be valid." Ibid.
(internal quotation marks omitted). This they have failed
to do.2

2 The joint opinion of Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter appears to ignore this point in concluding that the spousal notice provision
imposes an undue burden on the abortion decision. Ante, at 887-898. In
most instances the notification requirement operates without difficulty.
As the District Court found, the vast majority of wives seeking abortions
notify and consult with their husbands, and thus suffer no burden as a
result of the provision. 744 F. Supp. 1323, 1360 (ED Pa. 1990). In other
instances where a woman does not want to notify her husband, the Act
provides exceptions. For example, notification is not required if the husband is not the father, if the pregnancy is the result of a reported spousal
sexual assault, or if the woman fears bodily injury as a result of notifying
her husband. Thus, in these instances as well, the notification provision
imposes no obstacle to the abortion decision.

The joint opinion puts to one side these situations where the regulation
imposes no obstacle at all, and instead focuses on the group of married
women who would not otherwise notify their husbands and who do not
qualify for one of the exceptions. Having narrowed the focus, the joint
opinion concludes that in a "large fraction" of those cases, the notification
provision operates as a substantial obstacle, ante, at 895, and that the provision is therefore invalid. There are certainly instances where a woman
would prefer not to notify her husband, and yet does not qualify for an
exception. For example, there are the situations of battered women who
fear psychological abuse or injury to their children as a result of notification; because in these situations the women do not fear bodily injury, they
do not qualify for an exception. And there are situations where a woman
has become pregnant as a result of an unreported spousal sexual assault;
when such an assault is unreported, no exception is available. But, as the
District Court found, there are also instances where the woman prefers
not to notify her husband for a variety of other reasons. See 744 F. Supp.,
at 1360. For example, a woman might desire to obtain an abortion without her husband's knowledge because of perceived economic constraints
or her husband's previously expressed opposition to abortion. The joint

974 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN

PA. v. CASEY

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.

The question before us is therefore whether the spousalnotification requirement rationally furthers any legitimate

state interests. We conclude that it does. First, a hus-band's interests in procreation within marriage and in the
potential life of his unborn child are certainly substantialones. See

Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth,428 U. S., at 69 ("We are not unaware of the deep and proper

concern and interest that a devoted and protective husbandhas in his wife's pregnancy and in the growth and development of the fetus she is carrying"); id., at 93 (White, J.,concurring in part and dissenting in part); Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S., at 541. The State itselfhas legitimate interests both in protecting these interests of
the father and in protecting the potential life of the fetus,and the spousal notification requirement is reasonably related to advancing those state interests. By providing thata husband will usually know of his spouse's intent to have an
abortion, the provision makes it more likely that the husbandwill participate in deciding the fate of his unborn child, a
possibility that might otherwise have been denied him.This participation might in some cases result in a decision to
proceed with the pregnancy. As Judge Alito observed inhis dissent below, "[t]he Pennsylvania legislature could have
rationally believed that some married women are initiallyinclined to obtain an abortion without their husbands' knowledge because of perceived problems--such as economic con-straints, future plans, or the husbands' previously expressed

opinion concentrates on the situations involving battered women and unreported spousal assault, and assumes, without any support in the record,
that these instances constitute a "large fraction" of those cases in which
women prefer not to notify their husbands (and do not qualify for an exception). Ante, at 895. This assumption is not based on any hard evidence,
however. And were it helpful to an attempt to reach a desired result, one
could just as easily assume that the battered women situations form 100
percent of the cases where women desire not to notify, or that they constitute only 20 percent of those cases. But reliance on such speculation is
the necessary result of adopting the undue burden standard.

opposition--that may be obviated by discussion prior to theabortion." 947 F. 2d, at 726 (opinion concurring in part and

dissenting in part).The State also has a legitimate interest in promoting "the
integrity of the marital relationship." 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.

$ 3209(a) (1990). This Court has previously recognized "theimportance of the marital relationship in our society."

Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, supra, at69. In our view, the spousal notice requirement is a rational
attempt by the State to improve truthful communication be-tween spouses and encourage collaborative decisionmaking,
and thereby fosters marital integrity. See Labine v. Vincent, 401 U. S. 532, 538 (1971) ("[T]he power to make rules
to establish, protect, and strengthen family life" is committed to the state legislatures). Petitioners argue that the
notification requirement does not further any such interest;
they assert that the majority of wives already notify their
husbands of their abortion decisions, and the remainder have
excellent reasons for keeping their decisions a secret. In
the first case, they argue, the law is unnecessary, and in the
second case it will only serve to foster marital discord and
threats of harm. Thus, petitioners see the law as a totally
irrational means of furthering whatever legitimate interest
the State might have. But, in our view, it is unrealistic to
assume that every husband-wife relationship is either (1) so
perfect that this type of truthful and important communication will take place as a matter of course, or (2) so imperfect
that, upon notice, the husband will react selfishly, violently,
or contrary to the best interests of his wife. See Planned
Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, supra, at 103-104
(Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)
(making a similar point in the context of a parental consent
statute). The spousal notice provision will admittedly be
unnecessary in some circumstances, and possibly harmful in
others, but "the existence of particular cases in which a feature of a statute performs no function (or is even counterpro505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT

ductive) ordinarily does not render the statute unconstitu-tional or even constitutionally suspect." Thornburgh v.

American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476U. S., at 800 (

White, J., dissenting). The Pennsylvania Leg-islature was in a position to weigh the likely benefits of the

provision against its likely adverse effects, and presumablyconcluded, on balance, that the provision would be beneficial.
Whether this was a wise decision or not, we cannot say thatit was irrational. We therefore conclude that the spousal
notice provision comports with the Constitution. See Har-ris v. McRae, 448 U. S., at 325-326 ("It is not the mission of
this Court or any other to decide whether the balance ofcompeting interests . . . is wise social policy").

D
The Act also imposes various reporting requirements.Section 3214(a) requires that abortion facilities file a report

on each abortion performed. The reports do not include theidentity of the women on whom abortions are performed, but
they do contain a variety of information about the abortions.For example, each report must include the identities of the
performing and referring physicians, the gestational age ofthe fetus at the time of abortion, and the basis for any medical judgment that a medical emergency existed. See 18 Pa.Cons. Stat. $$ 3214(a)(1), (5), (10) (1990). See Appendix to
opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ., ante, at909-911. The District Court found that these reports are
kept completely confidential. 947 F. 2d, at 716. We furtherconclude that these reporting requirements rationally further the State's legitimate interests in advancing the stateof medical knowledge concerning maternal health and prenatal life, in gathering statistical information with respect topatients, and in ensuring compliance with other provisions
of the Act.Section 3207 of the Act requires each abortion facility to
file a report with its name and address, as well as the names

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
and addresses of any parent, subsidiary, or affiliated organizations. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. $ 3207(b) (1990). Section 3214(f)
further requires each facility to file quarterly reports stating
the total number of abortions performed, broken down by
trimester. Both of these reports are available to the public
only if the facility received state funds within the preceding
12 months. See Appendix to opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ., ante, at 906, 911. Petitioners do not
challenge the requirement that facilities provide this information. They contend, however, that the forced public disclosure of the information given by facilities receiving public
funds serves no legitimate state interest. We disagree. Records relating to the expenditure of public funds are generally
available to the public under Pennsylvania law. See Pa.
Stat. Ann., Tit. 65, $$ 66.1, 66.2 (Purdon 1959 and Supp. 1991-
1992). As the Court of Appeals observed, "[w]hen a state
provides money to a private commercial enterprise, there is
a legitimate public interest in informing taxpayers who the
funds are benefiting and what services the funds are supporting." 947 F. 2d, at 718. These reporting requirements rationally further this legitimate state interest.

E
Finally, petitioners challenge the medical emergency exception provided for by the Act. The existence of a medical
emergency exempts compliance with the Act's informed consent, parental consent, and spousal notice requirements.
See 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. $$ 3205(a), 3206(a), 3209(c) (1990).
The Act defines a "medical emergency" as

"[t]hat condition which, on the basis of the physician's
good faith clinical judgment, so complicates the medical
condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or
for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial

and irreversible impairment of major bodily function."$ 3203.

Petitioners argued before the District Court that the stat-utory definition was inadequate because it did not cover
three serious conditions that pregnant women can suffer--preeclampsia, inevitable abortion, and prematurely ruptured
membrane. The District Court agreed with petitioners thatthe medical emergency exception was inadequate, but the
Court of Appeals reversed this holding. In construing themedical emergency provision, the Court of Appeals first observed that all three conditions do indeed present the risk ofserious injury or death when an abortion is not performed,
and noted that the medical profession's uniformly prescribedtreatment for each of the three conditions is an immediate
abortion. See 947 F. 2d, at 700-701. Finding that "[t]hePennsylvania legislature did not choose the wording of its
medical emergency exception in a vacuum," the court readthe exception as intended "to assure that compliance with its
abortion regulations would not in any way pose a significantthreat to the life or health of a woman." Id., at 701. It
thus concluded that the exception encompassed each of thethree dangerous conditions pointed to by petitioners.

We observe that Pennsylvania's present definition of medi-cal emergency is almost an exact copy of that State's definition at the time of this Court's ruling in Thornburgh, onewhich the Court made reference to with apparent approval.
476 U. S., at 771 ("It is clear that the Pennsylvania Legisla-ture knows how to provide a medical-emergency exception
when it chooses to do so").3 We find that the interpretation

3 The definition in use at that time provided as follows:
" `Medical emergency.' That condition which, on the basis of the physician's best clinical judgment, so complicates a pregnancy as to necessitate
the immediate abortion of same to avert the death of the mother or for
which a 24-hour delay will create grave peril of immediate and irreversible
loss of major bodily function." Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, $ 3203 (Purdon
1983).

of the Court of Appeals in these cases is eminently reason-able, and that the provision thus should be upheld. When a

woman is faced with any condition that poses a "significantthreat to [her] life or health," she is exempted from the Act's
consent and notice requirements and may proceed immedi-ately with her abortion.

IV
For the reasons stated, we therefore would hold that eachof the challenged provisions of the Pennsylvania statute is

consistent with the Constitution. It bears emphasis thatour conclusion in this regard does not carry with it any necessary approval of these regulations. Our task is, as always,to decide only whether the challenged provisions of a law
comport with the United States Constitution. If, as we be-lieve, these do, their wisdom as a matter of public policy is
for the people of Pennsylvania to decide.

Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice
White, and Justice Thomas join, concurring in the judg-ment in part and dissenting in part.

My views on this matter are unchanged from those I setforth in my separate opinions in Webster v. Reproductive
Health Services, 492 U. S. 490, 532 (1989) (opinion concurringin part and concurring in judgment), and

Ohio v. Akron Cen-ter for Reproductive Health, 497 U. S. 502, 520 (1990) (Akron

II) (concurring opinion). The States may, if they wish, per-mit abortion on demand, but the Constitution does not require them to do so. The permissibility of abortion, and thelimitations upon it, are to be resolved like most important
questions in our democracy: by citizens trying to persuadeone another and then voting. As the Court acknowledges,
"where reasonable people disagree the government canadopt one position or the other."

Ante, at 851. The Courtis correct in adding the qualification that this "assumes a

state of affairs in which the choice does not intrude upon aprotected liberty," ibid.--but the crucial part of that quali505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:06 PAGES OPINPGT

PA. v. CASEY

Opinion of Scalia, J.

fication is the penultimate word. A State's choice betweentwo positions on which reasonable people can disagree is constitutional even when (as is often the case) it intrudes upona "liberty" in the absolute sense. Laws against bigamy, for
example--with which entire societies of reasonable peopledisagree--intrude upon men and women's liberty to marry
and live with one another. But bigamy happens not to be aliberty specially "protected" by the Constitution.

That is, quite simply, the issue in these cases: not whetherthe power of a woman to abort her unborn child is a "liberty"
in the absolute sense; or even whether it is a liberty of greatimportance to many women. Of course it is both. The
issue is whether it is a liberty protected by the Constitutionof the United States. I am sure it is not. I reach that conclusion not because of anything so exalted as my views con-cerning the "concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life." Ibid. Rather, Ireach it for the same reason I reach the conclusion that bigamy is not constitutionally protected--because of two simplefacts: (1) the Constitution says absolutely nothing about it,
and (2) the longstanding traditions of American society havepermitted it to be legally proscribed.

1 Akron II, supra, at

520 (Scalia, J., concurring).

1 The Court's suggestion, ante, at 847-848, that adherence to tradition
would require us to uphold laws against interracial marriage is entirely
wrong. Any tradition in that case was contradicted by a text--an Equal
Protection Clause that explicitly establishes racial equality as a constitutional value. See Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 9 (1967) ("In the case at
bar, . . . we deal with statutes containing racial classifications, and the fact of
equal application does not immunize the statute from the very heavy burden
of justification which the Fourteenth Amendment has traditionally required of state statutes drawn according to race"); see also id., at 13 (Stewart, J., concurring in judgment). The enterprise launched in Roe v. Wade,
410 U. S. 113 (1973), by contrast, sought to establish--in the teeth of a
clear, contrary tradition--a value found nowhere in the constitutional text.

There is, of course, no comparable tradition barring recognition of a
"liberty interest" in carrying one's child to term free from state efforts to
kill it. For that reason, it does not follow that the Constitution does not

The Court destroys the proposition, evidently meant torepresent my position, that "liberty" includes "only those

practices, defined at the most specific level, that were pro-tected against government interference by other rules of law
when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified," ante, at 847(citing

Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U. S. 110, 127, n. 6 (1989)(opinion of

Scalia, J.)). That is not, however, what Michael
H. says; it merely observes that, in defining "liberty," wemay not disregard a specific, "relevant tradition protecting,

or denying protection to, the asserted right," ibid. But theCourt does not wish to be fettered by any such limitations
on its preferences. The Court's statement that it is "tempt-ing" to acknowledge the authoritativeness of tradition in
order to "cur[b] the discretion of federal judges," ante, at847, is of course rhetoric rather than reality; no government
official is "tempted" to place restraints upon his own freedomof action, which is why Lord Acton did not say "Power tends
to purify." The Court's temptation is in the quite oppositeand more natural direction--towards systematically eliminating checks upon its own power; and it succumbs.Beyond that brief summary of the essence of my position,
I will not swell the United States Reports with repetition ofwhat I have said before; and applying the rational basis test,
I would uphold the Pennsylvania statute in its entirety. Imust, however, respond to a few of the more outrageous arguments in today's opinion, which it is beyond human natureto leave unanswered. I shall discuss each of them under a
quotation from the Court's opinion to which they pertain.

"The inescapable fact is that adjudication of sub-stantive due process claims may call upon the Court

protect childbirth simply because it does not protect abortion. The
Court's contention, ante, at 859, that the only way to protect childbirth is
to protect abortion shows the utter bankruptcy of constitutional analysis
deprived of tradition as a validating factor. It drives one to say that the
only way to protect the right to eat is to acknowledge the constitutional
right to starve oneself to death.

in interpreting the Constitution to exercise thatsame capacity which by tradition courts always have

exercised: reasoned judgment." Ante, at 849.
Assuming that the question before us is to be resolved atsuch a level of philosophical abstraction, in such isolation

from the traditions of American society, as by simply apply-ing "reasoned judgment," I do not see how that could possibly have produced the answer the Court arrived at in Roe v.
Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973). Today's opinion describes themethodology of

Roe, quite accurately, as weighing againstthe woman's interest the State's " `important and legitimate

interest in protecting the potentiality of human life.' "Ante, at 871 (quoting Roe, supra, at 162). But "reasoned
judgment" does not begin by begging the question, as Roeand subsequent cases unquestionably did by assuming that
what the State is protecting is the mere "potentiality ofhuman life." See,

e. g., Roe, supra, at 162; Planned Parent-hood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, 61 (1976); Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U. S. 379, 386 (1979); Akron v. AkronCenter for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416, 428
(1983) (Akron I); Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City,Mo., Inc. v. Ashcroft, 462 U. S. 476, 482 (1983). The whole
argument of abortion opponents is that what the Court callsthe fetus and what others call the unborn child

is a humanlife. Thus, whatever answer Roe came up with after conducting its "balancing" is bound to be wrong, unless it iscorrect that the human fetus is in some critical sense merely
potentially human. There is of course no way to determinethat as a legal matter; it is in fact a value judgment. Some
societies have considered newborn children not yet human,or the incompetent elderly no longer so.

The authors of the joint opinion, of course, do not squarelycontend that

Roe v. Wade was a correct application of "rea-soned judgment"; merely that it must be followed, because

of stare decisis. Ante, at 853, 861, 871. But in their ex-haustive discussion of all the factors that go into the determi505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:06 PAGES OPINPGT

nation of when stare decisis should be observed and whendisregarded, they never mention "how wrong was the decision on its face?" Surely, if "[t]he Court's power lies . . . inits legitimacy, a product of substance and perception," ante,
at 865, the "substance" part of the equation demands thatplain error be acknowledged and eliminated.

Roe wasplainly wrong--even on the Court's methodology of "reasoned judgment," and even more so (of course) if the propercriteria of text and tradition are applied.

The emptiness of the "reasoned judgment" that produced
Roe is displayed in plain view by the fact that, after more
than 19 years of effort by some of the brightest (and most
determined) legal minds in the country, after more than 10cases upholding abortion rights in this Court, and after dozens upon dozens of amicus briefs submitted in these andother cases, the best the Court can do to explain how it is that
the word "liberty" must be thought to include the right to de-stroy human fetuses is to rattle off a collection of adjectives
that simply decorate a value judgment and conceal a politicalchoice. The right to abort, we are told, inheres in "liberty"
because it is among "a person's most basic decisions," ante,
at 849; it involves a "most intimate and personal choic[e],"
ante, at 851; it is "central to personal dignity and autonomy,"
ibid.; it "originate[s] within the zone of conscience and be-lief,"

ante, at 852; it is "too intimate and personal" for state
interference, ibid.; it reflects "intimate views" of a "deep,personal character,"

ante, at 853; it involves "intimate relationships" and notions of "personal autonomy and bodily in-tegrity,"

ante, at 857; and it concerns a particularly " `important decisio[n],' " ante, at 859 (citation omitted).2 But it is

2 Justice Blackmun's parade of adjectives is similarly empty: Abortion
is among " `the most intimate and personal choices,' " ante, at 923; it is a
matter "central to personal dignity and autonomy," ibid.; and it involves
"personal decisions that profoundly affect bodily integrity, identity, and
destiny," ante, at 927. Justice Stevens is not much less conclusory: The
decision to choose abortion is a matter of "the highest privacy and the

obvious to anyone applying "reasoned judgment" that thesame adjectives can be applied to many forms of conduct that

this Court (including one of the Justices in today's majority,see Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186 (1986)) has held are
not entitled to constitutional protection--because, like abor-tion, they are forms of conduct that have long been criminalized in American society. Those adjectives might be ap-plied, for example, to homosexual sodomy, polygamy, adult
incest, and suicide, all of which are equally "intimate" and"deep[ly] personal" decisions involving "personal autonomy
and bodily integrity," and all of which can constitutionallybe proscribed because it is our unquestionable constitutional
tradition that they are proscribable. It is not reasonedjudgment that supports the Court's decision; only personal
predilection. Justice Curtis's warning is as timely today asit was 135 years ago:

"[W]hen a strict interpretation of the Constitution, ac-cording to the fixed rules which govern the interpretation of laws, is abandoned, and the theoretical opinionsof individuals are allowed to control its meaning, we
have no longer a Constitution; we are under the govern-ment of individual men, who for the time being have
power to declare what the Constitution is, according totheir own views of what it ought to mean."

thors of the joint opinion. The shortcomings of Roe did not
include lack of clarity: Virtually all regulation of abortion
before the third trimester was invalid. But to come across
this phrase in the joint opinion--which calls upon federal
district judges to apply an "undue burden" standard as
doubtful in application as it is unprincipled in origin--is
really more than one should have to bear.

The joint opinion frankly concedes that the amorphous
concept of "undue burden" has been inconsistently applied
by the Members of this Court in the few brief years since
that "test" was first explicitly propounded by Justice
O'Connor in her dissent in Akron I, 462 U. S. 416 (1983).
See ante, at 876.3 Because the three Justices now wish to
"set forth a standard of general application," the joint opinion announces that "it is important to clarify what is meant
by an undue burden." Ibid. I certainly agree with that,
but I do not agree that the joint opinion succeeds in the announced endeavor. To the contrary, its efforts at clarifica3 The joint opinion is clearly wrong in asserting, ante, at 874, that "the
Court's early abortion cases adhered to" the "undue burden" standard.
The passing use of that phrase in Justice Blackmun's opinion for the
Court in Bellotti v. Baird, 428 U. S. 132, 147 (1976) (Bellotti I), was not
by way of setting forth the standard of unconstitutionality, as Justice
O'Connor's later opinions did, but by way of expressing the conclusion
of unconstitutionality. Justice Powell for a time appeared to employ a
variant of "undue burden" analysis in several nonmajority opinions, see,
e. g., Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U. S. 622, 647 (1979) (Bellotti II); Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U. S. 678, 705 (1977) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment), but he too ultimately rejected
that standard in his opinion for the Court in Akron v. Akron Center for
Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416, 420, n. 1 (1983) (Akron I). The
joint opinion's reliance on Maher v. Roe, 432 U. S. 464, 473 (1977), and
Harris v. McRae, 448 U. S. 297, 314 (1980), is entirely misplaced, since
those cases did not involve regulation of abortion, but mere refusal to fund
it. In any event, Justice O'Connor's earlier formulations have apparently now proved unsatisfactory to the three Justices, who--in the name
of stare decisis no less--today find it necessary to devise an entirely new
version of "undue burden" analysis. See ante, at 877-879.

tion make clear only that the standard is inherently manipu-lable and will prove hopelessly unworkable in practice.

The joint opinion explains that a state regulation imposesan "undue burden" if it "has the purpose or effect of placing
a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking anabortion of a nonviable fetus."

Ante, at 877; see also ante,at 877-879. An obstacle is "substantial," we are told, if it is

"calculated[,] [not] to inform the woman's free choice, [butto] hinder it." Ante, at 877.

4 This latter statement cannot

4 The joint opinion further asserts that a law imposing an undue burden
on abortion decisions is not a "permissible" means of serving "legitimate"
state interests. Ante, at 877. This description of the undue burden
standard in terms more commonly associated with the rational-basis test
will come as a surprise even to those who have followed closely our wanderings in this forsaken wilderness. See, e. g., Akron I, supra, at 463
(O'Connor, J., dissenting) ("The `undue burden' . . . represents the required threshold inquiry that must be conducted before this Court can
require a State to justify its legislative actions under the exacting `compelling state interest' standard"); see also Hodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U. S.
417, 458-460 (1990) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment in part); Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747, 828 (1986) (O'Connor, J., dissenting). This
confusing equation of the two standards is apparently designed to explain
how one of the Justices who joined the plurality opinion in Webster v.
Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490 (1989), which adopted the
rational-basis test, could join an opinion expressly adopting the undue burden test. See id., at 520 (rejecting the view that abortion is a "fundamental right," instead inquiring whether a law regulating the woman's "liberty interest" in abortion is "reasonably designed" to further "legitimate"
state ends). The same motive also apparently underlies the joint opinion's erroneous citation of the plurality opinion in Ohio v. Akron Center
for Reproductive Health, 497 U. S. 502, 506 (1990) (Akron II) (opinion of
Kennedy, J.), as applying the undue burden test. See ante, at 876 (using
this citation to support the proposition that "two of us"--i. e., two of the
authors of the joint opinion--have previously applied this test). In fact,
Akron II does not mention the undue burden standard until the conclusion
of the opinion, when it states that the statute at issue "does not impose
an undue, or otherwise unconstitutional, burden." 497 U. S., at 519 (emphasis added). I fail to see how anyone can think that saying a statute
does not impose an unconstitutional burden under any standard, including

possibly mean what it says. Any regulation of abortion that
is intended to advance what the joint opinion concedes is the
State's "substantial" interest in protecting unborn life will
be "calculated [to] hinder" a decision to have an abortion. It
thus seems more accurate to say that the joint opinion would
uphold abortion regulations only if they do not unduly hinder the woman's decision. That, of course, brings us right
back to square one: Defining an "undue burden" as an "undue
hindrance" (or a "substantial obstacle") hardly "clarifies" the
test. Consciously or not, the joint opinion's verbal shell
game will conceal raw judicial policy choices concerning what
is "appropriate" abortion legislation.

The ultimately standardless nature of the "undue burden"
inquiry is a reflection of the underlying fact that the concept
has no principled or coherent legal basis. As The Chief
Justice points out, Roe's strict-scrutiny standard "at least
had a recognized basis in constitutional law at the time Roe
was decided," ante, at 964, while "[t]he same cannot be said
for the `undue burden' standard, which is created largely out
of whole cloth by the authors of the joint opinion," ibid. The
joint opinion is flatly wrong in asserting that "our jurisprudence relating to all liberties save perhaps abortion has recognized" the permissibility of laws that do not impose an
"undue burden." Ante, at 873. It argues that the abortion
right is similar to other rights in that a law "not designed to
strike at the right itself, [but which] has the incidental effect
of making it more difficult or more expensive to [exercise the
right,]" is not invalid. Ante, at 874. I agree, indeed I have

the undue burden test, amounts to adopting the undue burden test as the
exclusive standard. The Court's citation of Hodgson as reflecting Justice Kennedy's and Justice O'Connor's "shared premises," ante, at
878, is similarly inexplicable, since the word "undue" was never even used
in the former's opinion in that case. I joined Justice Kennedy's opinions in both Hodgson and Akron II; I should be grateful, I suppose, that
the joint opinion does not claim that I, too, have adopted the undue burden test.

forcefully urged, that a law of general applicability whichplaces only an incidental burden on a fundamental right does

not infringe that right, see R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377,389-390 (1992);

Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872, 878-882 (1990), but
that principle does not establish the quite different (and quitedangerous) proposition that a law which

directly regulates a
fundamental right will not be found to violate the Consti-tution unless it imposes an "undue burden." It is that, of

course, which is at issue here: Pennsylvania has consciously
and directly regulated conduct that our cases have held is
constitutionally protected. The appropriate analogy, therefore, is that of a state law requiring purchasers of religious
books to endure a 24-hour waiting period, or to pay a nominal additional tax of 1c. The joint opinion cannot possibly
be correct in suggesting that we would uphold such legislation on the ground that it does not impose a "substantial
obstacle" to the exercise of First Amendment rights. The
"undue burden" standard is not at all the generally applicable
principle the joint opinion pretends it to be; rather, it is a
unique concept created specially for these cases, to preserve
some judicial foothold in this ill-gotten territory. In claiming otherwise, the three Justices show their willingness to
place all constitutional rights at risk in an effort to preserve
what they deem the "central holding in Roe." Ante, at 873.

The rootless nature of the "undue burden" standard, a
phrase plucked out of context from our earlier abortion decisions, see n. 3, supra, is further reflected in the fact that the
joint opinion finds it necessary expressly to repudiate the
more narrow formulations used in Justice O'Connor's earlier opinions. Ante, at 876-877. Those opinions stated that
a statute imposes an "undue burden" if it imposes "absolute
obstacles or severe limitations on the abortion decision,"
Akron I, 462 U. S., at 464 (dissenting opinion) (emphasis
added); see also Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747, 828 (1986) (dissent505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:06 PAGES OPINPGT

ing opinion). Those strong adjectives are conspicuouslymissing from the joint opinion, whose authors have for some

unexplained reason now determined that a burden is "undue"if it merely imposes a "substantial" obstacle to abortion decisions. See, e. g., ante, at 895, 901. Justice O'Connor hasalso abandoned (again without explanation) the view she expressed in Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo.,
Inc. v. Ashcroft, 462 U. S. 476 (1983) (dissenting opinion), thata medical regulation which imposes an "undue burden" could

nevertheless be upheld if it "reasonably relate[s] to the pres-ervation and protection of maternal health," id., at 505 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In today's ver-sion, even health measures will be upheld only "

if they do notconstitute an undue burden," ante, at 878 (emphasis added).

Gone too is Justice O'Connor's statement that "the Statepossesses compelling interests in the protection of potential
human life . . . throughout pregnancy," Akron I, supra, at461 (dissenting opinion) (emphasis added); see also Ashcroft,
supra, at 505 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment in partand dissenting in part);

Thornburgh, supra, at 828 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); instead, the State's interest in unbornhuman life is stealthily downgraded to a merely "substantial"

or "profound" interest, ante, at 876, 878. (That had to bedone, of course, since designating the interest as "compelling" throughout pregnancy would have been, shall we say,a "substantial obstacle" to the joint opinion's determined effort to reaffirm what it views as the "central holding" of Roe.See Akron I, 462 U. S., at 420, n. 1.) And "viability" is no
longer the "arbitrary" dividing line previously decried by
Justice O'Connor in Akron I, id., at 461; the Court nowannounces that "the attainment of viability may continue to

serve as the critical fact," ante, at 860.5 It is difficult to

maintain the illusion that we are interpreting a Constitution
rather than inventing one, when we amend its provisions so
breezily.

Because the portion of the joint opinion adopting and describing the undue burden test provides no more useful guidance than the empty phrases discussed above, one must turn
to the 23 pages applying that standard to the present facts
for further guidance. In evaluating Pennsylvania's abortion
law, the joint opinion relies extensively on the factual findings of the District Court, and repeatedly qualifies its conclusions by noting that they are contingent upon the record developed in these cases. Thus, the joint opinion would uphold
the 24-hour waiting period contained in the Pennsylvania
statute's informed consent provision, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.

$ 3205 (1990), because "the record evidence shows that in the
vast majority of cases, a 24-hour delay does not create any
appreciable health risk," ante, at 885. The three Justices
therefore conclude that "on the record before us, . . . we are
not convinced that the 24-hour waiting period constitutes an
undue burden." Ante, at 887. The requirement that a doctor provide the information pertinent to informed consent
would also be upheld because "there is no evidence on this
record that [this requirement] would amount in practical
terms to a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion." Ante, at 884. Similarly, the joint opinion would uphold the reporting requirements of the Act, $$ 3207, 3214,
because "there is no . . . showing on the record before us"
that these requirements constitute a "substantial obstacle"

be thought to override the interests of the mother. Ante, at 870. Precisely why is it that, at the magical second when machines currently in
use (though not necessarily available to the particular woman) are able to
keep an unborn child alive apart from its mother, the creature is suddenly
able (under our Constitution) to be protected by law, whereas before that
magical second it was not? That makes no more sense than according infants legal protection only after the point when they can feed
themselves.

to abortion decisions. Ante, at 901. But at the same timethe opinion pointedly observes that these reporting requirements may increase the costs of abortions and that "at somepoint [that fact] could become a substantial obstacle." Ibid.
Most significantly, the joint opinion's conclusion that thespousal notice requirement of the Act, see $ 3209, imposes an
"undue burden" is based in large measure on the DistrictCourt's "detailed findings of fact," which the joint opinion
sets out at great length, ante, at 888-891.I do not, of course, have any objection to the notion that,
in applying legal principles, one should rely only upon thefacts that are contained in the record or that are properly
subject to judicial notice.6 But what is remarkable aboutthe joint opinion's fact-intensive analysis is that it does not
result in any measurable clarification of the "undue burden"standard. Rather, the approach of the joint opinion is, for
the most part, simply to highlight certain facts in the recordthat apparently strike the three Justices as particularly significant in establishing (or refuting) the existence of an undueburden; after describing these facts, the opinion then simply
announces that the provision either does or does not imposea "substantial obstacle" or an "undue burden." See, e. g.,
ante, at 880, 884-885, 887, 893-894, 895, 901. We do not knowwhether the same conclusions could have been reached on a
different record, or in what respects the record would havehad to differ before an opposite conclusion would have been

6 The joint opinion is not entirely faithful to this principle, however. In
approving the District Court's factual findings with respect to the spousal
notice provision, it relies extensively on nonrecord materials, and in reliance upon them adds a number of factual conclusions of its own. Ante, at
891-893. Because this additional factfinding pertains to matters that
surely are "subject to reasonable dispute," Fed. Rule Evid. 201(b), the
joint opinion must be operating on the premise that these are "legislative"
rather than "adjudicative" facts, see Rule 201(a). But if a court can find
an undue burden simply by selectively string-citing the right social science
articles, I do not see the point of emphasizing or requiring "detailed factual findings" in the District Court.

appropriate. The inherently standardless nature of this in-quiry invites the district judge to give effect to his personal

preferences about abortion. By finding and relying uponthe right facts, he can invalidate, it would seem, almost any
abortion restriction that strikes him as "undue"--subject, of
course, to the possibility of being reversed by a court of ap-peals or Supreme Court that is as unconstrained in reviewing his decision as he was in making it.To the extent I can discern

any meaningful content in the
"undue burden" standard as applied in the joint opinion, itappears to be that a State may not regulate abortion in such

a way as to reduce significantly its incidence. The joint
opinion repeatedly emphasizes that an important factor in
the "undue burden" analysis is whether the regulation "prevent[s] a significant number of women from obtaining an
abortion," ante, at 893; whether a "significant number of
women . . . are likely to be deterred from procuring an
abortion," ante, at 894; and whether the regulation often
"deters" women from seeking abortions, ante, at 897. We
are not told, however, what forms of "deterrence" are impermissible or what degree of success in deterrence is too much
to be tolerated. If, for example, a State required a woman
to read a pamphlet describing, with illustrations, the facts of
fetal development before she could obtain an abortion, the
effect of such legislation might be to "deter" a "significant
number of women" from procuring abortions, thereby seemingly allowing a district judge to invalidate it as an undue
burden. Thus, despite flowery rhetoric about the State's
"substantial" and "profound" interest in "potential human
life," and criticism of Roe for undervaluing that interest, the
joint opinion permits the State to pursue that interest only
so long as it is not too successful. As Justice Blackmun
recognizes (with evident hope), ante, at 926, the "undue burden" standard may ultimately require the invalidation of
each provision upheld today if it can be shown, on a better
record, that the State is too effectively "express[ing] a pref505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:06 PAGES OPINPGT

erence for childbirth over abortion," ante, at 883. Reasonfinds no refuge in this jurisprudence of confusion.

"While we appreciate the weight of the arguments. . . that Roe should be overruled, the reservations
any of us may have in reaffirming the central holdingof Roe are outweighed by the explication of individual liberty we have given combined with the force ofstare decisis."

Ante, at 853.

The Court's reliance upon stare decisis can best be de-scribed as contrived. It insists upon the necessity of adhering not to all of Roe, but only to what it calls the "centralholding." It seems to me that

stare decisis ought to be applied even to the doctrine of stare decisis, and I confess neverto have heard of this new, keep-what-you-want-and-throwaway-the-rest version. I wonder whether, as applied to
Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), for example, the
new version of stare decisis would be satisfied if we allowed
courts to review the constitutionality of only those statutesthat (like the one in

Marbury) pertain to the jurisdiction of
the courts.I am certainly not in a good position to dispute that the

Court has saved the "central holding" of Roe, since to dothat effectively I would have to know what the Court has
saved, which in turn would require me to understand (as I donot) what the "undue burden" test means. I must confess,
however, that I have always thought, and I think a lot of
other people have always thought, that the arbitrary trimes-ter framework, which the Court today discards, was quite as

central to Roe as the arbitrary viability test, which the Court
today retains. It seems particularly ungrateful to carve the
trimester framework out of the core of Roe, since its very
rigidity (in sharp contrast to the utter indeterminability of
the "undue burden" test) is probably the only reason the
Court is able to say, in urging stare decisis, that Roe "has in
no sense proven `unworkable,' " ante, at 855. I suppose the

Court is entitled to call a "central holding" whatever it wantsto call a "central holding"--which is, come to think of it, perhaps one of the difficulties with this modified version of staredecisis. I thought I might note, however, that the following
portions of Roe have not been saved:

x Under Roe, requiring that a woman seeking an abortionbe provided truthful information about abortion before giving informed written consent is unconstitutional, if the infor-mation is designed to influence her choice. Thornburgh, 476
U. S., at 759-765; Akron I, 462 U. S., at 442-445. Underthe joint opinion's "undue burden" regime (as applied today,
at least) such a requirement is constitutional. Ante, at881-885.

x Under Roe, requiring that information be provided by adoctor, rather than by nonphysician counselors, is unconstitutional. Akron I, supra, at 446-449. Under the "undue bur-den" regime (as applied today, at least) it is not.

Ante, at884-885.

x Under Roe, requiring a 24-hour waiting period betweenthe time the woman gives her informed consent and the time
of the abortion is unconstitutional. Akron I, supra, at 449-451. Under the "undue burden" regime (as applied today,
at least) it is not. Ante, at 885-887.

x Under Roe, requiring detailed reports that include demo-graphic data about each woman who seeks an abortion and

various information about each abortion is unconstitutional.
Thornburgh, supra, at 765-768. Under the "undue burden"regime (as applied today, at least) it generally is not. Ante,

at 900-901.

"Where, in the performance of its judicial duties, theCourt decides a case in such a way as to resolve the

sort of intensely divisive controversy reflected inRoe . . . , its decision has a dimension that the resolution of the normal case does not carry. It is the di-mension present whenever the Court's interpretation
of the Constitution calls the contending sides of a

national controversy to end their national divisionby accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution." Ante, at 866-867.
The Court's description of the place of Roe in the socialhistory of the United States is unrecognizable. Not only did

Roe not, as the Court suggests, resolve the deeply divisiveissue of abortion; it did more than anything else to nourish
it, by elevating it to the national level where it is infinitelymore difficult to resolve. National politics were not plagued
by abortion protests, national abortion lobbying, or abortionmarches on Congress before Roe v. Wade was decided. Profound disagreement existed among our citizens over theissue--as it does over other issues, such as the death penalty--but that disagreement was being worked out at thestate level. As with many other issues, the division of sentiment within each State was not as closely balanced as it wasamong the population of the Nation as a whole, meaning not
only that more people would be satisfied with the results ofstate-by-state resolution, but also that those results would
be more stable. Pre-Roe, moreover, political compromisewas possible.

Roe's mandate for abortion on demand destroyed the com-promises of the past, rendered compromise impossible for the
future, and required the entire issue to be resolved uni-formly, at the national level. At the same time, Roe created
a vast new class of abortion consumers and abortion propo-nents by eliminating the moral opprobrium that had attached
to the act. ("If the Constitution guarantees abortion, howcan it be bad?"--not an accurate line of thought, but a natural one.) Many favor all of those developments, and it is notfor me to say that they are wrong. But to portray

Roe asthe statesmanlike "settlement" of a divisive issue, a jurisprudential Peace of Westphalia that is worth preserving, is noth-ing less than Orwellian. Roe fanned into life an issue that
has inflamed our national politics in general, and has ob-scured with its smoke the selection of Justices to this Court

in particular, ever since. And by keeping us in the abortion-umpiring business, it is the perpetuation of that disruption,

rather than of any Pax Roeana, that the Court's new major-ity decrees.

the United States, S. Doc. No. 101-10, p. 139 (1989).
It is particularly difficult, in the circumstances of the pres-ent decision, to sit still for the Court's lengthy lecture upon

the virtues of "constancy," ante, at 868, of "remain[ing]steadfast," ibid., and adhering to "principle," ante, passim.

principle that constitutes adher-ence (the joint opinion's "undue burden" standard)--and that

principle is inconsistent with Roe. See 410 U. S., at 154-156.

7 To make matters worse, two of the three, in order

thus to remain steadfast, had to abandon previously statedpositions. See n. 4,

to, it seems to me, is the principle that the Court must beseen as standing by

Roe. That is not a principle of law
(which is what I thought the Court was talking about), buta principle of

Realpolitik--and a wrong one at that.
I cannot agree with, indeed I am appalled by, the Court's
suggestion that the decision whether to stand by an errone-ous constitutional decision must be strongly influenced--

against overruling, no less--by the substantial and continu-ing public opposition the decision has generated. The
Court's judgment that any other course would "subvert theCourt's legitimacy" must be another consequence of reading
the error-filled history book that described the deeply divided country brought together by Roe. In my history
book, the Court was covered with dishonor and deprived of
legitimacy by Dred Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393 (1857), an
erroneous (and widely opposed) opinion that it did not abandon, rather than by West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S.
379 (1937), which produced the famous "switch in time" from
the Court's erroneous (and widely opposed) constitutional opposition to the social measures of the New Deal. (Both
Dred Scott and one line of the cases resisting the New Deal
rested upon the concept of "substantive due process" that
the Court praises and employs today. Indeed, Dred Scott
was "very possibly the first application of substantive due
process in the Supreme Court, the original precedent for
Lochner v. New York and Roe v. Wade." D. Currie, The
Constitution in the Supreme Court 271 (1985) (footnotes

But whether it would "subvert the Court's legitimacy" or
not, the notion that we would decide a case differently from
the way we otherwise would have in order to show that we
can stand firm against public disapproval is frightening. It
is a bad enough idea, even in the head of someone like me,
who believes that the text of the Constitution, and our traditions, say what they say and there is no fiddling with them.
But when it is in the mind of a Court that believes the Con505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:06 PAGES OPINPGT

stitution has an evolving meaning, see ante, at 848; that theNinth Amendment's reference to "othe[r]" rights is not a disclaimer, but a charter for action, ibid.; and that the functionof this Court is to "speak before all others for [the people's]
constitutional ideals" unrestrained by meaningful text or tradition--then the notion that the Court must adhere to a deci-sion for as long as the decision faces "great opposition" and

the Court is "under fire" acquires a character of almost czar-ist arrogance. We are offended by these marchers who descend upon us, every year on the anniversary of Roe, to pro-test our saying that the Constitution requires what our
society has never thought the Constitution requires. These
people who refuse to be "tested by following" must be
taught a lesson. We have no Cossacks, but at least we can
stubbornly refuse to abandon an erroneous opinion that we
might otherwise change--to show how little they intimidate
us.

Of course, as The Chief Justice points out, we have been
subjected to what the Court calls " `political pressure' " by
both sides of this issue. Ante, at 963. Maybe today's decision not to overrule Roe will be seen as buckling to pressure
from that direction. Instead of engaging in the hopeless
task of predicting public perception--a job not for lawyers
but for political campaign managers--the Justices should do
what is legally right by asking two questions: (1) Was Roe
correctly decided? (2) Has Roe succeeded in producing a
settled body of law? If the answer to both questions is no,
Roe should undoubtedly be overruled.

In truth, I am as distressed as the Court is--and expressed my distress several years ago, see Webster, 492 U. S.,
at 535--about the "political pressure" directed to the Court:
the marches, the mail, the protests aimed at inducing us to
change our opinions. How upsetting it is, that so many of
our citizens (good people, not lawless ones, on both sides of
this abortion issue, and on various sides of other issues as
well) think that we Justices should properly take into ac505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:06 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Scalia, J.

count their views, as though we were engaged not in ascer-taining an objective law but in determining some kind of

social consensus. The Court would profit, I think, from giv-ing less attention to the

fact of this distressing phenomenon,
and more attention to the cause of it. That cause permeates
today's opinion: a new mode of constitutional adjudicationthat relies not upon text and traditional practice to determine the law, but upon what the Court calls "reasoned judg-ment,"

ante, at 849, which turns out to be nothing but philosophical predilection and moral intuition. All manner of"liberties," the Court tells us, inhere in the Constitution and

are enforceable by this Court--not just those mentioned in the
text or established in the traditions of our society. Ante, at
847-849. Why even the Ninth Amendment--which says only
that "[t]he enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights,
shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained
by the people"--is, despite our contrary understanding for
almost 200 years, a literally boundless source of additional,
unnamed, unhinted-at "rights," definable and enforceable by
us, through "reasoned judgment." Ante, at 848-849.

What makes all this relevant to the bothersome application
of "political pressure" against the Court are the twin facts
that the American people love democracy and the American
people are not fools. As long as this Court thought (and
the people thought) that we Justices were doing essentially
lawyers' work up here--reading text and discerning our
society's traditional understanding of that text--the public
pretty much left us alone. Texts and traditions are facts to
study, not convictions to demonstrate about. But if in reality our process of constitutional adjudication consists primarily of making value judgments; if we can ignore a long and
clear tradition clarifying an ambiguous text, as we did, for
example, five days ago in declaring unconstitutional invocations and benedictions at public high school graduation ceremonies, Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577 (1992); if, as I say, our
pronouncement of constitutional law rests primarily on value

judgments, then a free and intelligent people's attitude to-wards us can be expected to be (ought to be) quite different.

The people know that their value judgments are quite asgood as those taught in any law school--maybe better. If,
indeed, the "liberties" protected by the Constitution are, asthe Court says, undefined and unbounded, then the people
should demonstrate, to protest that we do not implement
their values instead of ours. Not only that, but confirmationhearings for new Justices should deteriorate into questionand-answer sessions in which Senators go through a list oftheir constituents' most favored and most disfavored alleged
constitutional rights, and seek the nominee's commitment tosupport or oppose them. Value judgments, after all, should
be voted on, not dictated; and if our Constitution has some-how accidently committed them to the Supreme Court, at
least we can have a sort of plebiscite each time a new nomi-nee to that body is put forward.

Justice Blackmun notonly regards this prospect with equanimity, he solicits it.

There is a poignant aspect to today's opinion. Its length,and what might be called its epic tone, suggest that its authors believe they are bringing to an end a troublesome erain the history of our Nation and of our Court. "It is the
dimension" of authority, they say, to "cal[l] the contendingsides of national controversy to end their national division
by accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution."

that hangs in the Harvard Law School: Roger Brooke Taney,painted in 1859, the 82d year of his life, the 24th of his Chief
Justiceship, the second after his opinion in Dred Scott. Heis all in black, sitting in a shadowed red armchair, left hand
resting upon a pad of paper in his lap, right hand hanginglimply, almost lifelessly, beside the inner arm of the chair.

seems to be on his face, and in his deep-set eyes, an expres-sion of profound sadness and disillusionment. Perhaps he

always looked that way, even when dwelling upon the happi-est of thoughts. But those of us who know how the lustre
of his great Chief Justiceship came to be eclipsed by Dred
Scott cannot help believing that he had that case--its alreadyapparent consequences for the Court and its soon-to-beplayed-out consequences for the Nation--burning on hismind. I expect that two years earlier he, too, had thought
himself "call[ing] the contending sides of national contro-versy to end their national division by accepting a common
mandate rooted in the Constitution."It is no more realistic for us in this litigation, than it was
for him in that, to think that an issue of the sort they bothinvolved--an issue involving life and death, freedom and
subjugation--can be "speedily and finally settled" by the Su-preme Court, as President James Buchanan in his inaugural
address said the issue of slavery in the territories would be.See Inaugural Addresses of the Presidents of the United
States, S. Doc. No. 101-10, p. 126 (1989). Quite to the con-trary, by foreclosing all democratic outlet for the deep passions this issue arouses, by banishing the issue from the po-litical forum that gives all participants, even the losers, the
satisfaction of a fair hearing and an honest fight, by continu-ing the imposition of a rigid national rule instead of allowing
for regional differences, the Court merely prolongs and in-tensifies the anguish.

We should get out of this area, where we have no right tobe, and where we do neither ourselves nor the country any
good by remaining.

LUCAS v. SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCIL
certiorari to the supreme court of south carolina

No. 91-453. Argued March 2, 1992--Decided June 29, 1992
In 1986, petitioner Lucas bought two residential lots on a South Carolina

barrier island, intending to build single-family homes such as those on
the immediately adjacent parcels. At that time, Lucas's lots were not
subject to the State's coastal zone building permit requirements. In
1988, however, the state legislature enacted the Beachfront Management Act, which barred Lucas from erecting any permanent habitable
structures on his parcels. He filed suit against respondent state
agency, contending that, even though the Act may have been a lawful
exercise of the State's police power, the ban on construction deprived
him of all "economically viable use" of his property and therefore effected a "taking" under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments that
required the payment of just compensation. See, e. g., Agins v. City of
Tiburon, 447 U. S. 255, 261. The state trial court agreed, finding that
the ban rendered Lucas's parcels "valueless," and entered an award exceeding $1.2 million. In reversing, the State Supreme Court held itself
bound, in light of Lucas's failure to attack the Act's validity, to accept
the legislature's "uncontested . . . findings" that new construction in the
coastal zone threatened a valuable public resource. The court ruled
that, under the Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623, line of cases, when a
regulation is designed to prevent "harmful or noxious uses" of property
akin to public nuisances, no compensation is owing under the Takings
Clause regardless of the regulation's effect on the property's value.

Held:

1. Lucas's takings claim is not rendered unripe by the fact that he
may yet be able to secure a special permit to build on his property under
an amendment to the Act passed after briefing and argument before
the State Supreme Court, but prior to issuance of that court's opinion.
Because it declined to rest its judgment on ripeness grounds, preferring
to dispose of the case on the merits, the latter court's decision precludes,
both practically and legally, any takings claim with respect to Lucas's
preamendment deprivation. Lucas has properly alleged injury in fact
with respect to this preamendment deprivation, and it would not accord
with sound process in these circumstances to insist that he pursue the
late-created procedure before that component of his takings claim can
be considered ripe. Pp. 1010-1014.

505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:20 PAGES OPINPGT

Syllabus
2. The State Supreme Court erred in applying the "harmful or noxious uses" principle to decide this case. Pp. 1014-1032.

(a) Regulations that deny the property owner all "economically viable use of his land" constitute one of the discrete categories of regulatory deprivations that require compensation without the usual casespecific inquiry into the public interest advanced in support of the
restraint. Although the Court has never set forth the justification for
this categorical rule, the practical--and economic-- equivalence of physically appropriating and eliminating all beneficial use of land counsels
its preservation. Pp. 1014-1019.

(b) A review of the relevant decisions demonstrates that the "harmful or noxious use" principle was merely this Court's early formulation
of the police power justification necessary to sustain (without compensation) any regulatory diminution in value; that the distinction between
regulation that "prevents harmful use" and that which "confers benefits"
is difficult, if not impossible, to discern on an objective, value-free basis;
and that, therefore, noxious-use logic cannot be the basis for departing
from this Court's categorical rule that total regulatory takings must be
compensated. Pp. 1020-1026.

(c) Rather, the question must turn, in accord with this Court's "takings" jurisprudence, on citizens' historic understandings regarding the
content of, and the State's power over, the "bundle of rights" that they
acquire when they take title to property. Because it is not consistent
with the historical compact embodied in the Takings Clause that title to
real estate is held subject to the State's subsequent decision to eliminate
all economically beneficial use, a regulation having that effect cannot be
newly decreed, and sustained, without compensation's being paid the
owner. However, no compensation is owed--in this setting as with all
takings claims--if the State's affirmative decree simply makes explicit
what already inheres in the title itself, in the restrictions that background principles of the State's law of property and nuisance already
place upon land ownership. Cf. Scranton v. Wheeler, 179 U. S. 141,
163. Pp. 1027-1031.

(d) Although it seems unlikely that common-law principles would
have prevented the erection of any habitable or productive improvements on Lucas's land, this state-law question must be dealt with on
remand. To win its case, respondent cannot simply proffer the legislature's declaration that the uses Lucas desires are inconsistent with the
public interest, or the conclusory assertion that they violate a commonlaw maxim such as sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas, but must identify background principles of nuisance and property law that prohibit
the uses Lucas now intends in the property's present circumstances.

Opinion of the Court

$ 48-39-10(J)) to obtain a permit from the newly createdSouth Carolina Coastal Council (Council) (respondent here)

prior to committing the land to a "use other than the use thecritical area was devoted to on [September 28, 1977]."

$ 48-39-130(A).In the late 1970's, Lucas and others began extensive residential development of the Isle of Palms, a barrier islandsituated eastward of the city of Charleston. Toward the
close of the development cycle for one residential subdivisionknown as "Beachwood East," Lucas in 1986 purchased the
two lots at issue in this litigation for his own account. Noportion of the lots, which were located approximately 300
feet from the beach, qualified as a "critical area" under the1977 Act; accordingly, at the time Lucas acquired these parcels, he was not legally obliged to obtain a permit from theCouncil in advance of any development activity. His intention with respect to the lots was to do what the owners of theimmediately adjacent parcels had already done: erect singlefamily residences. He commissioned architectural drawingsfor this purpose.

The Beachfront Management Act brought Lucas's plans toan abrupt end. Under that 1988 legislation, the Council was
directed to establish a "baseline" connecting the landward-most "point[s] of erosion . . . during the past forty years" in
the region of the Isle of Palms that includes Lucas's lots.S. C. Code Ann. $ 48-39-280(A)(2) (Supp. 1988).

1 In action

not challenged here, the Council fixed this baseline landwardof Lucas's parcels. That was significant, for under the Act

1 This specialized historical method of determining the baseline applied
because the Beachwood East subdivision is located adjacent to a so-called
"inlet erosion zone" (defined in the Act to mean "a segment of shoreline
along or adjacent to tidal inlets which are directly influenced by the inlet
and its associated shoals," S. C. Code Ann. $ 48-39-270(7) (Supp. 1988))
that is "not stabilized by jetties, terminal groins, or other structures,"

$ 48-39-280(A)(2). For areas other than these unstabilized inlet erosion
zones, the statute directs that the baseline be established along "the crest
of an ideal primary oceanfront sand dune." $ 48-39-280(A)(1).

construction of occupable improvements 2 was flatly prohib-ited seaward of a line drawn 20 feet landward of, and parallel

to, the baseline. $ 48-39-290(A). The Act provided noexceptions.

B
Lucas promptly filed suit in the South Carolina Court ofCommon Pleas, contending that the Beachfront Management

Act's construction bar effected a taking of his property with-out just compensation. Lucas did not take issue with the
validity of the Act as a lawful exercise of South Carolina'spolice power, but contended that the Act's complete extinguishment of his property's value entitled him to compensa-tion regardless of whether the legislature had acted in furtherance of legitimate police power objectives. Following abench trial, the court agreed. Among its factual determinations was the finding that "at the time Lucas purchased thetwo lots, both were zoned for single-family residential construction and . . . there were no restrictions imposed uponsuch use of the property by either the State of South Carolina, the County of Charleston, or the Town of the Isle ofPalms." App. to Pet. for Cert. 36. The trial court further
found that the Beachfront Management Act decreed a per-manent ban on construction insofar as Lucas's lots were
concerned, and that this prohibition "deprive[d] Lucas ofany reasonable economic use of the lots, . . . eliminated the
unrestricted right of use, and render[ed] them valueless."Id., at 37. The court thus concluded that Lucas's properties
had been "taken" by operation of the Act, and it orderedrespondent to pay "just compensation" in the amount of
$1,232,387.50. Id., at 40.The Supreme Court of South Carolina reversed. It found
dispositive what it described as Lucas's concession "that the

Beachfront Management Act [was] properly and validly de-signed to preserve . . . South Carolina's beaches." 304 S. C.

376, 379, 404 S. E. 2d 895, 896 (1991). Failing an attack onthe validity of the statute as such, the court believed itself
bound to accept the "uncontested . . . findings" of the SouthCarolina Legislature that new construction in the coastal
zone--such as petitioner intended--threatened this publicresource.

Id., at 383, 404 S. E. 2d, at 898. The court ruledthat when a regulation respecting the use of property is

designed "to prevent serious public harm," id., at 383, 404S. E. 2d, at 899 (citing, inter alia, Mugler v. Kansas, 123
U. S. 623 (1887)), no compensation is owing under the Tak-ings Clause regardless of the regulation's effect on the property's value.Two justices dissented. They acknowledged that our
Mugler line of cases recognizes governmental power to pro-hibit "noxious" uses of property--

i. e., uses of property akinto "public nuisances"--without having to pay compensation.

But they would not have characterized the Beachfront Man-agement Act's "

primary purpose [as] the prevention of a nui-sance." 304 S. C., at 395, 404 S. E. 2d, at 906 (Harwell, J.,

dissenting). To the dissenters, the chief purposes of the leg-islation, among them the promotion of tourism and the creation of a "habitat for indigenous flora and fauna," could notfairly be compared to nuisance abatement. Id., at 396, 404
S. E. 2d, at 906. As a consequence, they would have af-firmed the trial court's conclusion that the Act's obliteration
of the value of petitioner's lots accomplished a taking.We granted certiorari. 502 U. S. 966 (1991).

II
As a threshold matter, we must briefly address the Coun-cil's suggestion that this case is inappropriate for plenary

review. After briefing and argument before the South Car-olina Supreme Court, but prior to issuance of that court's
opinion, the Beachfront Management Act was amended to

authorize the Council, in certain circumstances, to issue"special permits" for the construction or reconstruction of

habitable structures seaward of the baseline. See S. C.Code Ann. $ 48-39-290(D)(1) (Supp. 1991). According to the
Council, this amendment renders Lucas's claim of a permanent deprivation unripe, as Lucas may yet be able to securepermission to build on his property. "[The Court's] cases,"

we are reminded, "uniformly reflect an insistence on knowingthe nature and extent of permitted development before adjudicating the constitutionality of the regulations that purportto limit it."

U. S. 172, 190 (1985), the Council argues that he is not yet
entitled to definitive adjudication of his takings claim in
this Court.

We think these considerations would preclude review had
the South Carolina Supreme Court rested its judgment on
ripeness grounds, as it was (essentially) invited to do by the
Council. See Brief for Respondent 9, n. 3. The South Carolina Supreme Court shrugged off the possibility of further
administrative and trial proceedings, however, preferring to
dispose of Lucas's takings claim on the merits. Cf., e. g., San
Diego Gas & Electric Co. v. San Diego, 450 U. S. 621, 631-632
(1981). This unusual disposition does not preclude Lucas
from applying for a permit under the 1990 amendment for
future construction, and challenging, on takings grounds,
any denial. But it does preclude, both practically and legally, any takings claim with respect to Lucas's past deprivation, i. e., for his having been denied construction rights during the period before the 1990 amendment. See generally
First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v.
County of Los Angeles, 482 U. S. 304 (1987) (holding that

Opinion of the Court
temporary deprivations of use are compensable under theTakings Clause). Without even so much as commenting

upon the consequences of the South Carolina SupremeCourt's judgment in this respect, the Council insists that permitting Lucas to press his claim of a past deprivation on this
appeal would be improper, since "the issues of whether andto what extent [Lucas] has incurred a temporary taking . . .

have simply never been addressed." Brief for Respondent11. Yet Lucas had no reason to proceed on a "temporary
taking" theory at trial, or even to seek remand for that pur-pose prior to submission of the case to the South Carolina
Supreme Court, since as the Act then read, the taking wasunconditional and permanent. Moreover, given the breadth
of the South Carolina Supreme Court's holding and judgment, Lucas would plainly be unable (absent our interventionnow) to obtain further state-court adjudication with respect

to the 1988-1990 period.

In these circumstances, we think it would not accord with
sound process to insist that Lucas pursue the late-created
"special permit" procedure before his takings claim can be
considered ripe. Lucas has properly alleged Article III injury in fact in this case, with respect to both the pre-1990
and post-1990 constraints placed on the use of his parcels by
the Beachfront Management Act.3 That there is a discre3 Justice Blackmun insists that this aspect of Lucas's claim is "not
justiciable," post, at 1042, because Lucas never fulfilled his obligation
under Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton
Bank of Johnson City, 473 U. S. 172 (1985), to "submi[t] a plan for development of [his] property" to the proper state authorities, id., at 187. See
post, at 1043. But such a submission would have been pointless, as the
Council stipulated below that no building permit would have been issued
under the 1988 Act, application or no application. Record 14 (stipulations). Nor does the peculiar posture of this case mean that we are without Article III jurisdiction, as Justice Blackmun apparently believes.
See post, at 1042, and n. 5. Given the South Carolina Supreme Court's
dismissive foreclosure of further pleading and adjudication with respect to
the pre-1990 component of Lucas's takings claim, it is appropriate for us

tionary "special permit" procedure by which he may re-gain--for the future, at least--beneficial use of his land goes

only to the prudential "ripeness" of Lucas's challenge, andfor the reasons discussed we do not think it prudent to apply
that prudential requirement here. See Esposito v. South
Carolina Coastal Council, 939 F. 2d 165, 168 (CA4 1991),cert. denied, post, p. 1219.

4 We leave for decision on remand, of course, the questions left unaddressed by the South

to address that component as if the case were here on the pleadings alone.
Lucas properly alleged injury in fact in his complaint. See App. to Pet.
for Cert. 154 (complaint); id., at 156 (asking "damages for the temporary
taking of his property" from the date of the 1988 Act's passage to "such
time as this matter is finally resolved"). No more can reasonably be demanded. Cf. First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v.
County of Los Angeles, 482 U. S. 304, 312-313 (1987). Justice Blackmun finds it "baffling," post, at 1043, n. 5, that we grant standing here,
whereas "just a few days ago, in Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S.
555 (1992)," we denied standing. He sees in that strong evidence to support his repeated imputations that the Court "presses" to take this case,
post, at 1036, is "eager to decide" it, post, at 1045, and is unwilling to "be

denied," post, at 1042. He has a point: The decisions are indeed very close
in time, yet one grants standing and the other denies it. The distinction,
however, rests in law rather than chronology. Lujan, since it involved
the establishment of injury in fact at the summary judgment stage, required specific facts to be adduced by sworn testimony; had the same challenge to a generalized allegation of injury in fact been made at the pleading stage, it would have been unsuccessful.

4 In that case, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reached the

merits of a takings challenge to the 1988 Beachfront Management Act
identical to the one Lucas brings here even though the Act was amended,
and the special permit procedure established, while the case was under
submission. The court observed:

"The enactment of the 1990 Act during the pendency of this appeal, with
its provisions for special permits and other changes that may affect the
plaintiffs, does not relieve us of the need to address the plaintiffs' claims
under the provisions of the 1988 Act. Even if the amended Act cured all
of the plaintiffs' concerns, the amendments would not foreclose the possibility that a taking had occurred during the years when the 1988 Act was
in effect." Esposito v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 939 F. 2d 165,
168 (1991).

III

A
Prior to Justice Holmes's exposition in Pennsylvania CoalCo. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393 (1922), it was generally thought

that the Takings Clause reached only a "direct appropria-tion" of property, Legal Tender Cases, 12 Wall. 457, 551
(1871), or the functional equivalent of a "practical ouster of[the owner's] possession,"

Transportation Co. v. Chicago, 99U. S. 635, 642 (1879). See also Gibson v. United States, 166

U. S. 269, 275-276 (1897). Justice Holmes recognized inMahon, however, that if the protection against physical
appropriations of private property was to be meaningfullyenforced, the government's power to redefine the range of
interests included in the ownership of property was neces-sarily constrained by constitutional limits. 260 U. S., at
414-415. If, instead, the uses of private property were sub-ject to unbridled, uncompensated qualification under the police power, "the natural tendency of human nature [wouldbe] to extend the qualification more and more until at last
private property disappear[ed]." Id., at 415. These consid-erations gave birth in that case to the oft-cited maxim that,
"while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if reg-ulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking." Ibid.

5 Justice Blackmun states that our "intense interest in Lucas' plight
. . . would have been more prudently expressed by vacating the judgment
below and remanding for further consideration in light of the 1990 amendments" to the Beachfront Management Act. Post, at 1045, n. 7. That is
a strange suggestion, given that the South Carolina Supreme Court rendered its categorical disposition in this case after the Act had been
amended, and after it had been invited to consider the effect of those
amendments on Lucas's case. We have no reason to believe that the justices of the South Carolina Supreme Court are any more desirous of using
a narrower ground now than they were then; and neither "prudence" nor
any other principle of judicial restraint requires that we remand to find
out whether they have changed their mind.

Opinion of the Court
Nevertheless, our decision in Mahon offered little insightinto when, and under what circumstances, a given regulation

would be seen as going "too far" for purposes of the FifthAmendment. In 70-odd years of succeeding "regulatory
takings" jurisprudence, we have generally eschewed any
" `set formula' " for determining how far is too far, preferringto "engag[e] in . . . essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries."

Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S.104, 124 (1978) (quoting

Goldblatt v. Hempstead, 369 U. S.
590, 594 (1962)). See Epstein, Takings: Descent and Resur-rection, 1987 S. Ct. Rev. 1, 4. We have, however, described

at least two discrete categories of regulatory action as compensable without case-specific inquiry into the public interest
advanced in support of the restraint. The first encompasses
regulations that compel the property owner to suffer a physical "invasion" of his property. In general (at least with regard to permanent invasions), no matter how minute the intrusion, and no matter how weighty the public purpose
behind it, we have required compensation. For example, in
Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S.
419 (1982), we determined that New York's law requiring
landlords to allow television cable companies to emplace
cable facilities in their apartment buildings constituted a taking, id., at 435-440, even though the facilities occupied at
most only 11/2 cubic feet of the landlords' property, see id., at
438, n. 16. See also United States v. Causby, 328 U. S. 256,
265, and n. 10 (1946) (physical invasions of airspace); cf. Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U. S. 164 (1979) (imposition
of navigational servitude upon private marina).

The second situation in which we have found categorical
treatment appropriate is where regulation denies all economically beneficial or productive use of land. See Agins,
447 U. S., at 260; see also Nollan v. California Coastal
Comm'n, 483 U. S. 825, 834 (1987); Keystone Bituminous
Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U. S. 470, 495 (1987); Hodel
v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452

1016 LUCAS v. SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCIL

Opinion of the Court
U. S. 264, 295-296 (1981).6 As we have said on numerous
occasions, the Fifth Amendment is violated when land-use
regulation "does not substantially advance legitimate state
interests or denies an owner economically viable use of his
land." Agins, supra, at 260 (citations omitted) (emphasis
added).7

6 We will not attempt to respond to all of Justice Blackmun's mistaken
citation of case precedent. Characteristic of its nature is his assertion
that the cases we discuss here stand merely for the proposition "that proof
that a regulation does not deny an owner economic use of his property is
sufficient to defeat a facial takings challenge" and not for the point that
"denial of such use is sufficient to establish a takings claim regardless of
any other consideration." Post, at 1050, n. 11. The cases say, repeatedly
and unmistakably, that " `[t]he test to be applied in considering [a] facial
[takings] challenge is fairly straightforward. A statute regulating the
uses that can be made of property effects a taking if it "denies an owner
economically viable use of his land." ' " Keystone, 480 U. S., at 495 (quoting Hodel, 452 U. S., at 295-296 (quoting Agins, 447 U. S., at 260)) (emphasis added).

Justice Blackmun describes that rule (which we do not invent but
merely apply today) as "alter[ing] the long-settled rules of review" by
foisting on the State "the burden of showing [its] regulation is not a
taking." Post, at 1045, 1046. This is of course wrong. Lucas had to do
more than simply file a lawsuit to establish his constitutional entitlement;
he had to show that the Beachfront Management Act denied him economically beneficial use of his land. Our analysis presumes the unconstitutionality of state land-use regulation only in the sense that any rule with
exceptions presumes the invalidity of a law that violates it--for example,
the rule generally prohibiting content-based restrictions on speech. See,
e. g., Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd.,
502 U. S. 105, 115 (1991) ("A statute is presumptively inconsistent with the
First Amendment if it imposes a financial burden on speakers because of
the content of their speech"). Justice Blackmun's real quarrel is with
the substantive standard of liability we apply in this case, a longestablished standard we see no need to repudiate.

7 Regrettably, the rhetorical force of our "deprivation of all economically

feasible use" rule is greater than its precision, since the rule does not
make clear the "property interest" against which the loss of value is to be
measured. When, for example, a regulation requires a developer to leave
90% of a rural tract in its natural state, it is unclear whether we would

1017Cite as: 505 U. S. 1003 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
We have never set forth the justification for this rule. Perhaps it is simply, as Justice Brennan suggested, that total
deprivation of beneficial use is, from the landowner's point
of view, the equivalent of a physical appropriation. See San
Diego Gas & Electric Co. v. San Diego, 450 U. S., at 652
(dissenting opinion). "[F]or what is the land but the profits
thereof[?]" 1 E. Coke, Institutes, ch. 1, $ 1 (1st Am. ed.
1812). Surely, at least, in the extraordinary circumstance
when no productive or economically beneficial use of land is
permitted, it is less realistic to indulge our usual assumption
that the legislature is simply "adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life," Penn Central Transportation Co., 438

analyze the situation as one in which the owner has been deprived of all
economically beneficial use of the burdened portion of the tract, or as one
in which the owner has suffered a mere diminution in value of the tract
as a whole. (For an extreme--and, we think, unsupportable--view of the
relevant calculus, see Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City,
42 N. Y. 2d 324, 333-334, 366 N. E. 2d 1271, 1276-1277 (1977), aff'd, 438
U. S. 104 (1978), where the state court examined the diminution in a particular parcel's value produced by a municipal ordinance in light of total value
of the takings claimant's other holdings in the vicinity.) Unsurprisingly,
this uncertainty regarding the composition of the denominator in our "deprivation" fraction has produced inconsistent pronouncements by the Court.
Compare Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, 414 (1922) (law
restricting subsurface extraction of coal held to effect a taking), with Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U. S. 470, 497-502
(1987) (nearly identical law held not to effect a taking); see also id., at
515-520 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting); Rose, Mahon Reconstructed: Why
the Takings Issue is Still a Muddle, 57 S. Cal. L. Rev. 561, 566-569 (1984).
The answer to this difficult question may lie in how the owner's reasonable
expectations have been shaped by the State's law of property--i. e.,
whether and to what degree the State's law has accorded legal recognition
and protection to the particular interest in land with respect to which the
takings claimant alleges a diminution in (or elimination of) value. In any
event, we avoid this difficulty in the present case, since the "interest in
land" that Lucas has pleaded (a fee simple interest) is an estate with a
rich tradition of protection at common law, and since the South Carolina
Court of Common Pleas found that the Beachfront Management Act left
each of Lucas's beachfront lots without economic value.

1018 LUCAS v. SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCIL

Opinion of the Court
U. S., at 124, in a manner that secures an "average reciprocity of advantage" to everyone concerned, Pennsylvania Coal
Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S., at 415. And the functional basis for
permitting the government, by regulation, to affect property
values without compensation--that "Government hardly
could go on if to some extent values incident to property
could not be diminished without paying for every such
change in the general law," id., at 413--does not apply to the
relatively rare situations where the government has deprived a landowner of all economically beneficial uses.

On the other side of the balance, affirmatively supporting
a compensation requirement, is the fact that regulations that
leave the owner of land without economically beneficial or
productive options for its use--typically, as here, by requiring land to be left substantially in its natural state--carry
with them a heightened risk that private property is being
pressed into some form of public service under the guise
of mitigating serious public harm. See, e. g., Annicelli v.
South Kingstown, 463 A. 2d 133, 140-141 (R. I. 1983) (prohibition on construction adjacent to beach justified on twin
grounds of safety and "conservation of open space"); Morris
County Land Improvement Co. v. Parsippany-Troy Hills
Township, 40 N. J. 539, 552-553, 193 A. 2d 232, 240 (1963)
(prohibition on filling marshlands imposed in order to preserve region as water detention basin and create wildlife
refuge). As Justice Brennan explained: "From the government's point of view, the benefits flowing to the public
from preservation of open space through regulation may
be equally great as from creating a wildlife refuge through
formal condemnation or increasing electricity production
through a dam project that floods private property." San
Diego Gas & Elec. Co., supra, at 652 (dissenting opinion).

Opinion of the Court
provide for the use of eminent domain to impose servitudes
on private scenic lands preventing developmental uses, or to
acquire such lands altogether, suggest the practical equivalence in this setting of negative regulation and appropriation.
See, e. g., 16 U. S. C. $ 410ff-1(a) (authorizing acquisition of
"lands, waters, or interests [within Channel Islands National
Park] (including but not limited to scenic easements)");

$ 460aa-2(a) (authorizing acquisition of "any lands, or lesser
interests therein, including mineral interests and scenic
easements" within Sawtooth National Recreation Area);

$$ 3921-3923 (authorizing acquisition of wetlands); N. C. Gen.
Stat. $ 113A-38 (1990) (authorizing acquisition of, inter alia,
" `scenic easements' " within the North Carolina natural and
scenic rivers system); Tenn. Code Ann. $$ 11-15-101 to 11-
15-108 (1987) (authorizing acquisition of "protective easements" and other rights in real property adjacent to State's
historic, architectural, archaeological, or cultural resources).

We think, in short, that there are good reasons for our
frequently expressed belief that when the owner of real
property has been called upon to sacrifice all economically
beneficial uses in the name of the common good, that is, to
leave his property economically idle, he has suffered a
taking.8

8 Justice Stevens criticizes the "deprivation of all economically beneficial use" rule as "wholly arbitrary," in that "[the] landowner whose property is diminished in value 95% recovers nothing," while the landowner
who suffers a complete elimination of value "recovers the land's full value."
Post, at 1064. This analysis errs in its assumption that the landowner
whose deprivation is one step short of complete is not entitled to compensation. Such an owner might not be able to claim the benefit of our categorical formulation, but, as we have acknowledged time and again, "[t]he
economic impact of the regulation on the claimant and . . . the extent
to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed
expectations" are keenly relevant to takings analysis generally. Penn

1020 LUCAS v. SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCIL

Opinion of the Court

B
The trial court found Lucas's two beachfront lots to have
been rendered valueless by respondent's enforcement of the
coastal-zone construction ban.9 Under Lucas's theory of the
case, which rested upon our "no economically viable use"
statements, that finding entitled him to compensation.
Lucas believed it unnecessary to take issue with either the
purposes behind the Beachfront Management Act, or the
means chosen by the South Carolina Legislature to effectuate those purposes. The South Carolina Supreme Court,
however, thought otherwise. In its view, the Beachfront
Management Act was no ordinary enactment, but involved
an exercise of South Carolina's "police powers" to mitigate
the harm to the public interest that petitioner's use of his

Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104, 124 (1978).
It is true that in at least some cases the landowner with 95% loss will get
nothing, while the landowner with total loss will recover in full. But that
occasional result is no more strange than the gross disparity between the
landowner whose premises are taken for a highway (who recovers in full)
and the landowner whose property is reduced to 5% of its former value
by the highway (who recovers nothing). Takings law is full of these "allor-nothing" situations.

Justice Stevens similarly misinterprets our focus on "developmental"
uses of property (the uses proscribed by the Beachfront Management Act)
as betraying an "assumption that the only uses of property cognizable
under the Constitution are developmental uses." Post, at 1065, n. 3. We
make no such assumption. Though our prior takings cases evince an abiding concern for the productive use of, and economic investment in, land,
there are plainly a number of noneconomic interests in land whose impairment will invite exceedingly close scrutiny under the Takings Clause.
See, e. g., Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419,
436 (1982) (interest in excluding strangers from one's land).

9 This finding was the premise of the petition for certiorari, and since it

was not challenged in the brief in opposition we decline to entertain the
argument in respondent's brief on the merits, see Brief for Respondent
45-50, that the finding was erroneous. Instead, we decide the question
presented under the same factual assumptions as did the Supreme Court
of South Carolina. See Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U. S. 808, 816 (1985).

By neglecting to dispute the findings enumerated in the
Act 10 or otherwise to challenge the legislature's purposes,

10 The legislature's express findings include the following:
"The General Assembly finds that:
"(1) The beach/dune system along the coast of South Carolina is extremely important to the people of this State and serves the following
functions:

"(a) protects life and property by serving as a storm barrier which dissipates wave energy and contributes to shoreline stability in an economical
and effective manner;

"(b) provides the basis for a tourism industry that generates approximately two-thirds of South Carolina's annual tourism industry revenue
which constitutes a significant portion of the state's economy. The tourists who come to the South Carolina coast to enjoy the ocean and dry sand
beach contribute significantly to state and local tax revenues;

"(c) provides habitat for numerous species of plants and animals, several
of which are threatened or endangered. Waters adjacent to the beach/
dune system also provide habitat for many other marine species;

"(d) provides a natural health environment for the citizens of South Carolina to spend leisure time which serves their physical and mental wellbeing.

"(2) Beach/dune system vegetation is unique and extremely important
to the vitality and preservation of the system.

"(3) Many miles of South Carolina's beaches have been identified as critically eroding.

"(4) . . . [D]evelopment unwisely has been sited too close to the [beach/
dune] system. This type of development has jeopardized the stability of
the beach/dune system, accelerated erosion, and endangered adjacent
property. It is in both the public and private interests to protect the
system from this unwise development.

"(5) The use of armoring in the form of hard erosion control devices
such as seawalls, bulkheads, and rip-rap to protect erosion-threatened
structures adjacent to the beach has not proven effective. These armoring devices have given a false sense of security to beachfront property
owners. In reality, these hard structures, in many instances, have increased the vulnerability of beachfront property to damage from wind and
waves while contributing to the deterioration and loss of the dry sand
beach which is so important to the tourism industry.

"(6) Erosion is a natural process which becomes a significant problem
for man only when structures are erected in close proximity to the beach/

petitioner "concede[d] that the beach/dune area of South Car-olina's shores is an extremely valuable public resource; that

the erection of new construction, inter alia, contributes tothe erosion and destruction of this public resource; and that
discouraging new construction in close proximity to thebeach/dune area is necessary to prevent a great public
harm." Id., at 382-383, 404 S. E. 2d, at 898. In the court'sview, these concessions brought petitioner's challenge within
a long line of this Court's cases sustaining against Due Proc-ess and Takings Clause challenges the State's use of its "police powers" to enjoin a property owner from activities akinto public nuisances. See

Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623(1887) (law prohibiting manufacture of alcoholic beverages);

Hadacheck v. Sebastian, 239 U. S. 394 (1915) (law barringoperation of brick mill in residential area);

Miller v. Schoene,276 U. S. 272 (1928) (order to destroy diseased cedar trees to

prevent infection of nearby orchards); Goldblatt v. Hemp-stead, 369 U. S. 590 (1962) (law effectively preventing continued operation of quarry in residential area).It is correct that many of our prior opinions have suggested that "harmful or noxious uses" of property may beproscribed by government regulation without the requirement of compensation. For a number of reasons, however,we think the South Carolina Supreme Court was too quick to
conclude that that principle decides the present case. The"harmful or noxious uses" principle was the Court's early
attempt to describe in theoretical terms why government
dune system. It is in both the public and private interests to afford the
beach/dune system space to accrete and erode in its natural cycle. This
space can be provided only by discouraging new construction in close proximity to the beach/dune system and encouraging those who have erected
structures too close to the system to retreat from it.. . . . .

may, consistent with the Takings Clause, affect property val-ues by regulation without incurring an obligation to compensate--a reality we nowadays acknowledge explicitly with re-spect to the full scope of the State's police power. See,

very point in Penn Central Transportation Co., where, inthe course of sustaining New York City's landmarks preservation program against a takings challenge, we rejected thepetitioner's suggestion that

Mugler and the cases following
it were premised on, and thus limited by, some objective con-ception of "noxiousness":

"[T]he uses in issue in Hadacheck, Miller, and Goldblattwere perfectly lawful in themselves. They involved no
`blameworthiness, . . . moral wrongdoing or consciousact of dangerous risk-taking which induce[d society] to
shift the cost to a pa[rt]icular individual.' Sax, Takingsand the Police Power, 74 Yale L. J. 36, 50 (1964). These
cases are better understood as resting not on any supposed `noxious' quality of the prohibited uses but ratheron the ground that the restrictions were reasonably related to the implementation of a policy--not unlike historic preservation--expected to produce a widespread
public benefit and applicable to all similarly situated
property." 438 U. S., at 133-134, n. 30.

"Harmful or noxious use" analysis was, in other words, simply the progenitor of our more contemporary statements that

Opinion of the Court
"land-use regulation does not effect a taking if it `substan-tially advance[s] legitimate state interests' . . . ." Nollan,

supra, at 834 (quoting Agins v. Tiburon, 447 U. S., at 260);see also Penn Central Transportation Co., supra, at 127;
Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365, 387-388 (1926).The transition from our early focus on control of "noxious"
uses to our contemporary understanding of the broad realmwithin which government may regulate without compensation was an easy one, since the distinction between "harm-preventing" and "benefit-conferring" regulation is often in
the eye of the beholder. It is quite possible, for example, todescribe in

either fashion the ecological, economic, and es-thetic concerns that inspired the South Carolina Legislature

in the present case. One could say that imposing a servi-tude on Lucas's land is necessary in order to prevent his use
of it from "harming" South Carolina's ecological resources;or, instead, in order to achieve the "benefits" of an ecological preserve.11 Compare, e. g., Claridge v. New Hampshire

11 In the present case, in fact, some of the "[South Carolina] legislature's
`findings' " to which the South Carolina Supreme Court purported to defer
in characterizing the purpose of the Act as "harm-preventing," 304 S. C.
376, 385, 404 S. E. 2d 895, 900 (1991), seem to us phrased in "benefitconferring" language instead. For example, they describe the importance
of a construction ban in enhancing "South Carolina's annual tourism industry revenue," S. C. Code Ann. $ 48-39-250(1)(b) (Supp. 1991), in "provid[ing] habitat for numerous species of plants and animals, several of which
are threatened or endangered," $ 48-39-250(1)(c), and in "provid[ing] a
natural healthy environment for the citizens of South Carolina to spend
leisure time which serves their physical and mental well-being," $ 48-39-
250(1)(d). It would be pointless to make the outcome of this case hang
upon this terminology, since the same interests could readily be described
in "harm-preventing" fashion.

Justice Blackmun, however, apparently insists that we must make
the outcome hinge (exclusively) upon the South Carolina Legislature's
other, "harm-preventing" characterizations, focusing on the declaration
that "prohibitions on building in front of the setback line are necessary to
protect people and property from storms, high tides, and beach erosion."

"laudable" goal of "preserv[ing] marshlands from encroach-ment or destruction"). Whether one or the other of the
competing characterizations will come to one's lips in a par-ticular case depends primarily upon one's evaluation of the
worth of competing uses of real estate. See Restatement(Second) of Torts $ 822, Comment

g, p. 112 (1979) ("Practically all human activities unless carried on in a wilderness
interfere to some extent with others or involve some risk ofinterference"). A given restraint will be seen as mitigating

"harm" to the adjacent parcels or securing a "benefit" forthem, depending upon the observer's evaluation of the relative importance of the use that the restraint favors. SeeSax, Takings and the Police Power, 74 Yale L. J. 36, 49 (1964)
("[T]he problem [in this area] is not one of noxiousness orharm-creating activity at all; rather it is a problem of inconsistency between perfectly innocent and independently
desirable uses"). Whether Lucas's construction of single-family residences on his parcels should be described as bringing "harm" to South Carolina's adjacent ecological resourcesthus depends principally upon whether the describer believes that the State's use interest in nurturing those re-sources is so important that

any competing adjacent use
must yield.12

1026 LUCAS v. SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCIL

Opinion of the Court
When it is understood that "prevention of harmful use"was merely our early formulation of the police power justification necessary to sustain (without compensation) any regu-latory diminution in value; and that the distinction between
regulation that "prevents harmful use" and that which "con-fers benefits" is difficult, if not impossible, to discern on
an objective, value-free basis; it becomes self-evident thatnoxious-use logic cannot serve as a touchstone to distinguish
regulatory "takings"--which require compensation--fromregulatory deprivations that do not require compensation.
A fortiori the legislature's recitation of a noxious-use justifi-cation cannot be the basis for departing from our categorical
rule that total regulatory takings must be compensated. Ifit were, departure would virtually always be allowed. The
South Carolina Supreme Court's approach would essentiallynullify Mahon's affirmation of limits to the noncompensable
exercise of the police power. Our cases provide no supportfor this: None of them that employed the logic of "harmful
use" prevention to sustain a regulation involved an allega-tion that the regulation wholly eliminated the value of the
claimant's land. See Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn., 480U. S., at 513-514 (

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting).13

the test for required compensation is whether the legislature has recited a
harm-preventing justification for its action. See post, at 1039, 1040-1041,
1047-1051. Since such a justification can be formulated in practically
every case, this amounts to a test of whether the legislature has a stupid
staff. We think the Takings Clause requires courts to do more than insist
upon artful harm-preventing characterizations.

13 E. g., Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623 (1887) (prohibition upon use

of a building as a brewery; other uses permitted); Plymouth Coal Co. v.
Pennsylvania, 232 U. S. 531 (1914) (requirement that "pillar" of coal be
left in ground to safeguard mine workers; mineral rights could otherwise
be exploited); Reinman v. Little Rock, 237 U. S. 171 (1915) (declaration
that livery stable constituted a public nuisance; other uses of the property
permitted); Hadacheck v. Sebastian, 239 U. S. 394 (1915) (prohibition of
brick manufacturing in residential area; other uses permitted); Goldblatt
v. Hempstead, 369 U. S. 590 (1962) (prohibition on excavation; other uses
permitted).

Opinion of the Court
Where the State seeks to sustain regulation that deprivesland of all economically beneficial use, we think it may resist

compensation only if the logically antecedent inquiry into thenature of the owner's estate shows that the proscribed use
interests were not part of his title to begin with.14 Thisaccords, we think, with our "takings" jurisprudence, which
has traditionally been guided by the understandings of our
citizens regarding the content of, and the State's power over,the "bundle of rights" that they acquire when they obtain

title to property. It seems to us that the property ownernecessarily expects the uses of his property to be restricted,
from time to time, by various measures newly enacted bythe State in legitimate exercise of its police powers; "[a]s
long recognized, some values are enjoyed under an impliedlimitation and must yield to the police power."

Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S., at 413. And in the case of
personal property, by reason of the State's traditionally high
degree of control over commercial dealings, he ought to be
aware of the possibility that new regulation might even ren14 Drawing on our First Amendment jurisprudence, see, e. g., Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872,
878-879 (1990), Justice Stevens would "loo[k] to the generality of a
regulation of property" to determine whether compensation is owing.
Post, at 1072. The Beachfront Management Act is general, in his view,
because it "regulates the use of the coastline of the entire State." Post,
at 1074. There may be some validity to the principle Justice Stevens
proposes, but it does not properly apply to the present case. The equivalent of a law of general application that inhibits the practice of religion
without being aimed at religion, see Oregon v. Smith, supra, is a law that
destroys the value of land without being aimed at land. Perhaps such a
law--the generally applicable criminal prohibition on the manufacturing
of alcoholic beverages challenged in Mugler comes to mind--cannot constitute a compensable taking. See 123 U. S., at 655-656. But a regulation
specifically directed to land use no more acquires immunity by plundering
landowners generally than does a law specifically directed at religious
practice acquire immunity by prohibiting all religions. Justice Stevens's approach renders the Takings Clause little more than a particularized restatement of the Equal Protection Clause.

Opinion of the Court
der his property economically worthless (at least if the property's only economically productive use is sale or manufacture for sale). See Andrus v. Allard, 444 U. S. 51, 66-67
(1979) (prohibition on sale of eagle feathers). In the case of
land, however, we think the notion pressed by the Council
that title is somehow held subject to the "implied limitation"
that the State may subsequently eliminate all economically
valuable use is inconsistent with the historical compact recorded in the Takings Clause that has become part of our
constitutional culture.15

Where "permanent physical occupation" of land is concerned, we have refused to allow the government to decree
it anew (without compensation), no matter how weighty the
asserted "public interests" involved, Loretto v. Teleprompter
Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S., at 426--though we assuredly would permit the government to assert a permanent
easement that was a pre-existing limitation upon the land15 After accusing us of "launch[ing] a missile to kill a mouse," post, at
1036, Justice Blackmun expends a good deal of throw-weight of his own
upon a noncombatant, arguing that our description of the "understanding"
of land ownership that informs the Takings Clause is not supported by
early American experience. That is largely true, but entirely irrelevant.
The practices of the States prior to incorporation of the Takings and Just
Compensation Clauses, see Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U. S.
226 (1897)--which, as Justice Blackmun acknowledges, occasionally included outright physical appropriation of land without compensation, see
post, at 1056--were out of accord with any plausible interpretation of
those provisions. Justice Blackmun is correct that early constitutional
theorists did not believe the Takings Clause embraced regulations of property at all, see post, at 1057-1058, and n. 23, but even he does not suggest
(explicitly, at least) that we renounce the Court's contrary conclusion in
Mahon. Since the text of the Clause can be read to encompass regulatory
as well as physical deprivations (in contrast to the text originally proposed
by Madison, see Speech Proposing Bill of Rights (June 8, 1789), in 12
J. Madison, The Papers of James Madison 201 (C. Hobson, R. Rutland,
W. Rachal, & J. Sisson ed. 1979) ("No person shall be . . . obliged to relinquish his property, where it may be necessary for public use, without a
just compensation"), we decline to do so as well.

owner's title. Compare Scranton v. Wheeler, 179 U. S. 141,163 (1900) (interests of "riparian owner in the submerged

lands . . . bordering on a public navigable water" held subjectto Government's navigational servitude), with Kaiser Aetna
v. United States, 444 U. S., at 178-180 (imposition of naviga-tional servitude on marina created and rendered navigable
at private expense held to constitute a taking). We believesimilar treatment must be accorded confiscatory regulations,
i. e., regulations that prohibit all economically beneficial useof land: Any limitation so severe cannot be newly legislated
or decreed (without compensation), but must inhere in the
title itself, in the restrictions that background principles of
the State's law of property and nuisance already place uponland ownership. A law or decree with such an effect must,

in other words, do no more than duplicate the result thatcould have been achieved in the courts--by adjacent landowners (or other uniquely affected persons) under the State'slaw of private nuisance, or by the State under its complementary power to abate nuisances that affect the public gener-ally, or otherwise.

16

On this analysis, the owner of a lakebed, for example,would not be entitled to compensation when he is denied the

requisite permit to engage in a landfilling operation thatwould have the effect of flooding others' land. Nor the corporate owner of a nuclear generating plant, when it is di-rected to remove all improvements from its land upon discovery that the plant sits astride an earthquake fault. Such
regulatory action may well have the effect of eliminating theland's only economically productive use, but it does not proscribe a productive use that was previously permissible

16 The principal "otherwise" that we have in mind is litigation absolving
the State (or private parties) of liability for the destruction of "real and
personal property, in cases of actual necessity, to prevent the spreading of
a fire" or to forestall other grave threats to the lives and property of
others. Bowditch v. Boston, 101 U. S. 16, 18-19 (1880); see United States
v. Pacific R. Co., 120 U. S. 227, 238-239 (1887).

Opinion of the Court
under relevant property and nuisance principles. The useof these properties for what are now expressly prohibited

purposes was always unlawful, and (subject to other consti-tutional limitations) it was open to the State at any point to
make the implication of those background principles of nuisance and property law explicit. See Michelman, Property,
Utility, and Fairness, Comments on the Ethical Foundations
of "Just Compensation" Law, 80 Harv. L. Rev. 1165, 1239-
1241 (1967). In light of our traditional resort to "existing
rules or understandings that stem from an independent
source such as state law" to define the range of interests
that qualify for protection as "property" under the Fifth and
Fourteenth Amendments, Board of Regents of State Colleges
v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 577 (1972); see, e. g., Ruckelshaus v.
Monsanto Co., 467 U. S. 986, 1011-1012 (1984); Hughes v.
Washington, 389 U. S. 290, 295 (1967) (Stewart, J., concurring), this recognition that the Takings Clause does not require compensation when an owner is barred from putting
land to a use that is proscribed by those "existing rules or
understandings" is surely unexceptional. When, however, a
regulation that declares "off-limits" all economically productive or beneficial uses of land goes beyond what the relevant
background principles would dictate, compensation must be
paid to sustain it.17

The "total taking" inquiry we require today will ordinarily
entail (as the application of state nuisance law ordinarily entails) analysis of, among other things, the degree of harm to
public lands and resources, or adjacent private property,

17 Of course, the State may elect to rescind its regulation and thereby
avoid having to pay compensation for a permanent deprivation. See First
English Evangelical Lutheran Church, 482 U. S., at 321. But "where the
[regulation has] already worked a taking of all use of property, no subsequent action by the government can relieve it of the duty to provide
compensation for the period during which the taking was effective."

posed by the claimant's proposed activities, see, e. g., Restatement (Second) of Torts $$ 826, 827, the social value of
the claimant's activities and their suitability to the locality
in question, see, e. g., id., $$ 828(a) and (b), 831, and the relative ease with which the alleged harm can be avoided
through measures taken by the claimant and the government
(or adjacent private landowners) alike, see, e. g., id., $$ 827(e),
828(c), 830. The fact that a particular use has long been engaged in by similarly situated owners ordinarily imports a
lack of any common-law prohibition (though changed circumstances or new knowledge may make what was previously
permissible no longer so, see id., $ 827, Comment g. So also
does the fact that other landowners, similarly situated, are
permitted to continue the use denied to the claimant.

It seems unlikely that common-law principles would have
prevented the erection of any habitable or productive improvements on petitioner's land; they rarely support prohibition of the "essential use" of land, Curtin v. Benson, 222 U. S.
78, 86 (1911). The question, however, is one of state law to
be dealt with on remand. We emphasize that to win its case
South Carolina must do more than proffer the legislature's
declaration that the uses Lucas desires are inconsistent with
the public interest, or the conclusory assertion that they violate a common-law maxim such as sic utere tuo ut alienum
non laedas. As we have said, a "State, by ipse dixit, may
not transform private property into public property without
compensation . . . ." Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v.
Beckwith, 449 U. S. 155, 164 (1980). Instead, as it would be
required to do if it sought to restrain Lucas in a commonlaw action for public nuisance, South Carolina must identify
background principles of nuisance and property law that prohibit the uses he now intends in the circumstances in which
the property is presently found. Only on this showing can

the State fairly claim that, in proscribing all such beneficialuses, the Beachfront Management Act is taking nothing.

The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded forproceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

So ordered.
Justice Kennedy, concurring in the judgment.
The case comes to the Court in an unusual posture, as allmy colleagues observe. Ante, at 1010-1011; post, at 1041

(Blackmun, J., dissenting); post, at 1061-1062 (Stevens, J.,dissenting); post, at 1076-1077 (statement of

Souter, J.).After the suit was initiated but before it reached us, South

Carolina amended its Beachfront Management Act to author-ize the issuance of special permits at variance with the Act's
general limitations. See S. C. Code Ann. $ 48-39-290(D)(1)(Supp. 1991). Petitioner has not applied for a special permit
but may still do so. The availability of this alternative, if itcan be invoked, may dispose of petitioner's claim of a permanent taking. As I read the Court's opinion, it does not de-cide the permanent taking claim, but neither does it foreclose
the Supreme Court of South Carolina from considering theclaim or requiring petitioner to pursue an administrative alternative not previously available.The potential for future relief does not control our disposition, because whatever may occur in the future cannot undo

18 Justice Blackmun decries our reliance on background nuisance principles at least in part because he believes those principles to be as manipulable as we find the "harm prevention"/"benefit conferral" dichotomy, see
post, at 1054-1055. There is no doubt some leeway in a court's interpretation of what existing state law permits--but not remotely as much, we
think, as in a legislative crafting of the reasons for its confiscatory regulation. We stress that an affirmative decree eliminating all economically
beneficial uses may be defended only if an objectively reasonable application of relevant precedents would exclude those beneficial uses in the circumstances in which the land is presently found.

what has occurred in the past. The Beachfront Manage-ment Act was enacted in 1988. S. C. Code Ann. $ 48-39-250

et seq. (Supp. 1990). It may have deprived petitioner ofthe use of his land in an interim period. $ 48-39-290(A).
If this deprivation amounts to a taking, its limited duration
will not bar constitutional relief. It is well established thattemporary takings are as protected by the Constitution as

are permanent ones. First English Evangelical Lutheran
Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U. S. 304,
318 (1987).The issues presented in the case are ready for our decision.

The Supreme Court of South Carolina decided the case on
constitutional grounds, and its rulings are now before us.
There exists no jurisdictional bar to our disposition, and prudential considerations ought not to militate against it. The
State cannot complain of the manner in which the issues
arose. Any uncertainty in this regard is attributable to the
State, as a consequence of its amendment to the Beachfront
Management Act. If the Takings Clause is to protect
against temporary deprivations, as well as permanent ones,
its enforcement must not be frustrated by a shifting background of state law.

Although we establish a framework for remand, moreover,
we do not decide the ultimate question whether a temporary
taking has occurred in this case. The facts necessary to the
determination have not been developed in the record.
Among the matters to be considered on remand must be
whether petitioner had the intent and capacity to develop
the property and failed to do so in the interim period because
the State prevented him. Any failure by petitioner to comply with relevant administrative requirements will be part
of that analysis.

The South Carolina Court of Common Pleas found that
petitioner's real property has been rendered valueless by the
State's regulation. App. to Pet. for Cert. 37. The finding
appears to presume that the property has no significant mar505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:21 PAGES OPINPGT

ket value or resale potential. This is a curious finding, andI share the reservations of some of my colleagues about a

finding that a beachfront lot loses all value because of a de-velopment restriction.

Post, at 1043-1045 (Blackmun, J.,
dissenting); post, at 1065, n. 3 (Stevens, J., dissenting); post,
at 1076 (statement of Souter, J.). While the SupremeCourt of South Carolina on remand need not consider the

case subject to this constraint, we must accept the finding asentered below. See

Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U. S. 808,
816 (1985). Accepting the finding as entered, it follows thatpetitioner is entitled to invoke the line of cases discussing

regulations that deprive real property of all economic value.
See Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U. S. 255, 260 (1980).

The finding of no value must be considered under the
Takings Clause by reference to the owner's reasonable,
investment-backed expectations. Kaiser Aetna v. United
States, 444 U. S. 164, 175 (1979); Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104, 124 (1978); see also
W. B. Worthen Co. v. Kavanaugh, 295 U. S. 56 (1935). The
Takings Clause, while conferring substantial protection on
property owners, does not eliminate the police power of the
State to enact limitations on the use of their property.
Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623, 669 (1887). The rights conferred by the Takings Clause and the police power of the
State may coexist without conflict. Property is bought and
sold, investments are made, subject to the State's power to
regulate. Where a taking is alleged from regulations which
deprive the property of all value, the test must be whether
the deprivation is contrary to reasonable, investmentbacked expectations.

There is an inherent tendency towards circularity in this
synthesis, of course; for if the owner's reasonable expectations are shaped by what courts allow as a proper exercise
of governmental authority, property tends to become what
courts say it is. Some circularity must be tolerated in these
matters, however, as it is in other spheres. E. g., Katz v.

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967) (Fourth Amendment pro-tections defined by reasonable expectations of privacy).

The definition, moreover, is not circular in its entirety. Theexpectations protected by the Constitution are based on objective rules and customs that can be understood as reasonable by all parties involved.In my view, reasonable expectations must be understood

in light of the whole of our legal tradition. The common lawof nuisance is too narrow a confine for the exercise of regulatory power in a complex and interdependent society. Goldblatt v. Hempstead, 369 U. S. 590, 593 (1962). The State
should not be prevented from enacting new regulatory initiatives in response to changing conditions, and courts must
consider all reasonable expectations whatever their source.
The Takings Clause does not require a static body of state
property law; it protects private expectations to ensure private investment. I agree with the Court that nuisance prevention accords with the most common expectations of property owners who face regulation, but I do not believe this
can be the sole source of state authority to impose severe
restrictions. Coastal property may present such unique
concerns for a fragile land system that the State can go further in regulating its development and use than the common
law of nuisance might otherwise permit.

The Supreme Court of South Carolina erred, in my view,
by reciting the general purposes for which the state regulations were enacted without a determination that they were
in accord with the owner's reasonable expectations and
therefore sufficient to support a severe restriction on specific
parcels of property. See 304 S. C. 376, 383, 404 S. E. 2d 895,
899 (1991). The promotion of tourism, for instance, ought
not to suffice to deprive specific property of all value without
a corresponding duty to compensate. Furthermore, the
means, as well as the ends, of regulation must accord with
the owner's reasonable expectations. Here, the State did
not act until after the property had been zoned for individual

lot development and most other parcels had been improved,
throwing the whole burden of the regulation on the remaining lots. This too must be measured in the balance. See
Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, 416 (1922).

With these observations, I concur in the judgment of the
Court.

Today the Court launches a missile to kill a mouse.
The State of South Carolina prohibited petitioner Lucas
from building a permanent structure on his property from
1988 to 1990. Relying on an unreviewed (and implausible)
state trial court finding that this restriction left Lucas' property valueless, this Court granted review to determine
whether compensation must be paid in cases where the State
prohibits all economic use of real estate. According to the
Court, such an occasion never has arisen in any of our prior
cases, and the Court imagines that it will arise "relatively
rarely" or only in "extraordinary circumstances." Almost
certainly it did not happen in this case.

Nonetheless, the Court presses on to decide the issue, and
as it does, it ignores its jurisdictional limits, remakes its traditional rules of review, and creates simultaneously a new
categorical rule and an exception (neither of which is rooted
in our prior case law, common law, or common sense). I protest not only the Court's decision, but each step taken to
reach it. More fundamentally, I question the Court's wisdom in issuing sweeping new rules to decide such a narrow
case. Surely, as Justice Kennedy demonstrates, the
Court could have reached the result it wanted without inflicting this damage upon our Takings Clause jurisprudence.

My fear is that the Court's new policies will spread beyond
the narrow confines of the present case. For that reason, I,
like the Court, will give far greater attention to this case
than its narrow scope suggests--not because I can intercept

In 1972 Congress passed the Coastal Zone ManagementAct. 16 U. S. C. $ 1451

et seq. The Act was designed to pro-vide States with money and incentives to carry out Congress'

goal of protecting the public from shoreline erosion andcoastal hazards. In the 1980 amendments to the Act,
Congress directed States to enhance their coastal pro-grams by "[p]reventing or significantly reducing threats to
life and the destruction of property by eliminating develop-ment and redevelopment in high-hazard areas."

1 16 U. S. C.

$ 1456b(a)(2) (1988 ed., Supp. II).South Carolina began implementing the congressional directive by enacting the South Carolina Coastal Zone Man-agement Act of 1977. Under the 1977 Act, any construction
activity in what was designated the "critical area" requireda permit from the South Carolina Coastal Council (Council),
and the construction of any habitable structure was prohib-ited. The 1977 critical area was relatively narrow.

This effort did not stop the loss of shoreline. In October1986, the Council appointed a "Blue Ribbon Committee on
Beachfront Management" to investigate beach erosion and

attack upon South Carolina's coastline, for example, caused 29 deaths and
approximately $6 billion in property damage, much of it the result of uncontrolled beachfront development. See Zalkin, Shifting Sands and Shifting Doctrines: The Supreme Court's Changing Takings Doctrine and
South Carolina's Coastal Zone Statute, 79 Calif. L. Rev. 205, 212-213
(1991). The beachfront buildings are not only themselves destroyed in
such a storm, "but they are often driven, like battering rams, into adjacent
inland homes." Ibid. Moreover, the development often destroys the
natural sand dune barriers that provide storm breaks. Ibid.

established on the basis of "the best scientific and historicaldata" available.

Petitioner Lucas is a contractor, manager, and part ownerof the Wild Dune development on the Isle of Palms. He has

lived there since 1978. In December 1986, he purchased twoof the last four pieces of vacant property in the development.3 The area is notoriously unstable. In roughly half ofthe last 40 years, all or part of petitioner's property was part
of the beach or flooded twice daily by the ebb and flow of thetide. Tr. 84. Between 1957 and 1963, petitioner's property
was under water. Id., at 79, 81-82. Between 1963 and 1973the shoreline was 100 to 150 feet onto petitioner's property.
Ibid. In 1973 the first line of stable vegetation was abouthalfway through the property.

Id., at 80. Between 1981and 1983, the Isle of Palms issued 12 emergency orders for

from the crest of an ideal oceanfront sand dune which is 40 times the
annual erosion rate. S. C. Code Ann. $ 48-39-280 (Supp. 1991).

3 The properties were sold frequently at rapidly escalating prices before

Lucas purchased them. Lot 22 was first sold in 1979 for $96,660, sold in
1984 for $187,500, then in 1985 for $260,000, and, finally, to Lucas in 1986
for $475,000. He estimated its worth in 1991 at $650,000. Lot 24 had a
similar past. The record does not indicate who purchased the properties
prior to Lucas, or why none of the purchasers held on to the lots and built
on them. Tr. 44-46.

sandbagging to protect property in the Wild Dune develop-ment. Id., at 99. Determining that local habitable structures were in imminent danger of collapse, the Council issuedpermits for two rock revetments to protect condominium developments near petitioner's property from erosion; one ofthe revetments extends more than halfway onto one of his
lots. Id., at 102. C

The South Carolina Supreme Court found that the Beach-front Management Act did not take petitioner's property
without compensation. The decision rested on two premisesthat until today were unassailable--that the State has the
power to prevent any use of property it finds to be harmfulto its citizens, and that a state statute is entitled to a presumption of constitutionality.The Beachfront Management Act includes a finding by the
South Carolina General Assembly that the beach/dune sys-tem serves the purpose of "protect[ing] life and property by
serving as a storm barrier which dissipates wave energy andcontributes to shoreline stability in an economical and effective manner." S. C. Code Ann. $ 48-39-250(1)(a) (Supp.1990). The General Assembly also found that "development
unwisely has been sited too close to the [beach/dune] system.This type of development has jeopardized the stability of the
beach/dune system, accelerated erosion, and endangeredadjacent property." $ 48-39-250(4); see also $ 48-39-250(6)
(discussing the need to "afford the beach/dune system spaceto accrete and erode").

If the state legislature is correct that the prohibition onbuilding in front of the setback line prevents serious harm,
then, under this Court's prior cases, the Act is constitutional."Long ago it was recognized that all property in this country
is held under the implied obligation that the owner's use ofit shall not be injurious to the community, and the Takings
Clause did not transform that principle to one that requirescompensation whenever the State asserts its power to en505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:21 PAGES OPINPGT

force it." Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U. S. 470, 491-492 (1987) (internal quotation marks
omitted); see also id., at 488-489, and n. 18. The Court con-sistently has upheld regulations imposed to arrest a significant threat to the common welfare, whatever their economic
effect on the owner. See, e. g., Goldblatt v. Hempstead, 369U. S. 590, 592-593 (1962);

Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272
U. S. 365 (1926); Gorieb v. Fox, 274 U. S. 603, 608 (1927);
Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623 (1887).

Petitioner never challenged the legislature's findings thata building ban was necessary to protect property and life.

Nor did he contend that the threatened harm was not sufficiently serious to make building a house in a particular location a "harmful" use, that the legislature had not made sufficient findings, or that the legislature was motivated by
anything other than a desire to minimize damage to coastal
areas. Indeed, petitioner objected at trial that evidence as
to the purposes of the setback requirement was irrelevant.
Tr. 68. The South Carolina Supreme Court accordingly understood petitioner not to contest the State's position that
"discouraging new construction in close proximity to the
beach/dune area is necessary to prevent a great public
harm," 304 S. C. 376, 383, 404 S. E. 2d 895, 898 (1991), and
"to prevent serious injury to the community." Id., at 387,
404 S. E. 2d, at 901. The court considered itself "bound by
these uncontested legislative findings . . . [in the absence of]
any attack whatsoever on the statutory scheme." Id., at
383, 404 S. E. 2d, at 898.

Nothing in the record undermines the General Assembly's
assessment that prohibitions on building in front of the setback line are necessary to protect people and property from
storms, high tides, and beach erosion. Because that legislative determination cannot be disregarded in the absence of
such evidence, see, e. g., Euclid, 272 U. S., at 388; O'Gorman & Young, Inc. v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 282 U. S. 251,
257-258 (1931) (Brandeis, J.), and because its determination

of harm to life and property from building is sufficient toprohibit that use under this Court's cases, the South Carolina

Supreme Court correctly found no taking.

II
My disagreement with the Court begins with its decisionto review this case. This Court has held consistently that a

land-use challenge is not ripe for review until there is a finaldecision about what uses of the property will be permitted.
The ripeness requirement is not simply a gesture of goodwill to land-use planners. In the absence of "a final and authoritative determination of the type and intensity of devel-opment legally permitted on the subject property," MacDonald, Sommer & Frates v. Yolo County, 477 U. S. 340, 348(1986), and the utilization of state procedures for just compensation, there is no final judgment, and in the absence of afinal judgment there is no jurisdiction, see

San Diego Gas &Electric Co. v. San Diego, 450 U. S. 621, 633 (1981); Agins v.

City of Tiburon, 447 U. S. 255, 260 (1980).This rule is "compelled by the very nature of the inquiry
required by the Just Compensation Clause," because the fac-tors applied in deciding a takings claim "simply cannot be
evaluated until the administrative agency has arrived at afinal, definitive position regarding how it will apply the regulations at issue to the particular land in question." Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bankof Johnson City, 473 U. S. 172, 190, 191 (1985). See also

MacDonald, Sommer & Frates, 477 U. S., at 348 ("A courtcannot determine whether a regulation has gone `too far' unless it knows how far the regulation goes") (citation omitted).The Court admits that the 1990 amendments to the Beachfront Management Act allowing special permits precludeLucas from asserting that his property has been permanently taken. See ante, at 1011-1012. The Court agreesthat such a claim would not be ripe because there has been no
final decision by respondent on what uses will be permitted.

Blackmun, J., dissenting
The Court, however, will not be denied: It determines thatpetitioner's "temporary takings" claim for the period from

July 1, 1988, to June 25, 1990, is ripe. But this claim also isnot justiciable.

4

From the very beginning of this litigation, respondent hasargued that the courts

"lac[k] jurisdiction in this matter because the Plaintiffhas sought no authorization from Council for use of his
property, has not challenged the location of the baselineor setback line as alleged in the Complaint and because
no final agency decision has been rendered concerning
use of his property or location of said baseline or setbackline." Tr. 10 (answer, as amended).

Although the Council's plea has been ignored by every court,
it is undoubtedly correct.

Under the Beachfront Management Act, petitioner was
entitled to challenge the setback line or the baseline or erosion rate applied to his property in formal administrative,
followed by judicial, proceedings. S. C. Code Ann. $ 48-39-
280(E) (Supp. 1991). Because Lucas failed to pursue this
administrative remedy, the Council never finally decided
whether Lucas' particular piece of property was correctly
categorized as a critical area in which building would not be
permitted. This is all the more crucial because Lucas argued strenuously in the trial court that his land was perfectly safe to build on, and that his company had studies to
prove it. Tr. 20, 25, 36. If he was correct, the Council's

4 The Court's reliance, ante, at 1013, on Esposito v. South Carolina
Coastal Council, 939 F. 2d 165, 168 (CA4 1991), cert. denied, post, p. 1219,
in support of its decision to consider Lucas' temporary takings claim ripe
is misplaced. In Esposito the plaintiffs brought a facial challenge to the
mere enactment of the Act. Here, of course, Lucas has brought an asapplied challenge. See Brief for Petitioner 16. Facial challenges are ripe
when the Act is passed; applied challenges require a final decision on the
Act's application to the property in question.

final decision would have been to alter the setback line, elim-inating the construction ban on Lucas' property.

That petitioner's property fell within the critical area asinitially interpreted by the Council does not excuse petitioner's failure to challenge the Act's application to his propertyin the administrative process. The claim is not ripe until
petitioner seeks a variance from that status. "[W]e havemade it quite clear that the mere assertion of regulatory
jurisdiction by a governmental body does not constitute aregulatory taking."

United States v. Riverside BayviewHomes, Inc., 474 U. S. 121, 126 (1985). See also Williamson

County, 473 U. S., at 188 (claim not ripe because respondentdid not seek variances that would have allowed it to develop
the property, notwithstanding the commission's finding thatthe plan did not comply with the zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations).5Even if I agreed with the Court that there were no jurisdictional barriers to deciding this case, I still would not tryto decide it. The Court creates its new takings jurisprudence based on the trial court's finding that the property

5 Even more baffling, given its decision, just a few days ago, in Lujan v.
Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555 (1992), the Court decides petitioner
has demonstrated injury in fact. In his complaint, petitioner made no
allegations that he had any definite plans for using his property. App. to
Pet. for Cert. 153-156. At trial, Lucas testified that he had house plans
drawn up, but that he was "in no hurry" to build "because the lot was
appreciating in value." Tr. 28-29. The trial court made no findings of
fact that Lucas had any plans to use the property from 1988 to 1990.
" `[S]ome day' intentions--without any description of concrete plans, or
indeed even any specification of when the some day will be--do not support a finding of the `actual or imminent' injury that our cases require."
504 U. S., at 564. The Court circumvents Defenders of Wildlife by deciding to resolve this case as if it arrived on the pleadings alone. But it did
not. Lucas had a full trial on his claim for " `damages for the temporary
taking of his property' from the date of the 1988 Act's passage to `such
time as this matter is finally resolved,' " ante, at 1013, n. 3, quoting the

complaint, and failed to demonstrate any immediate concrete plans to build
or sell.

had lost all economic value.6 This finding is almost certainlyerroneous. Petitioner still can enjoy other attributes of

ownership, such as the right to exclude others, "one of themost essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property." Kaiser Aetna v. United
States, 444 U. S. 164, 176 (1979). Petitioner can picnic, swim,camp in a tent, or live on the property in a movable trailer.

State courts frequently have recognized that land has eco-nomic value where the only residual economic uses are recreation or camping. See, e. g., Turnpike Realty Co. v. Ded-ham, 362 Mass. 221, 284 N. E. 2d 891 (1972); Turner v.
County of Del Norte, 24 Cal. App. 3d 311, 101 Cal. Rptr. 93(1972), cert. denied, 409 U. S. 1108 (1973);

Hall v. Board ofEnvironmental Protection, 528 A. 2d 453 (Me. 1987). Petitioner also retains the right to alienate the land, which wouldhave value for neighbors and for those prepared to enjoy
proximity to the ocean without a house.Yet the trial court, apparently believing that "less value"
and "valueless" could be used interchangeably, found theproperty "valueless." The court accepted no evidence from
the State on the property's value without a home, and peti-tioner's appraiser testified that he never had considered
what the value would be absent a residence. Tr. 54-55.The appraiser's value was based on the fact that the "highest
and best use of these lots . . . [is] luxury single family de-tached dwellings."

Id., at 48. The trial court appeared tobelieve that the property could be considered "valueless" if

it was not available for its most profitable use. Absent thaterroneous assumption, see

Goldblatt, 369 U. S., at 592, I findno evidence in the record supporting the trial court's conclusion that the damage to the lots by virtue of the restrictions

6 Respondent contested the findings of fact of the trial court in the South
Carolina Supreme Court, but that court did not resolve the issue. This
Court's decision to assume for its purposes that petitioner had been denied
all economic use of his land does not, of course, dispose of the issue on
remand.

was "total." Record 128 (findings of fact). I agree with theCourt, ante, at 1020, n. 9, that it has the power to decide a

case that turns on an erroneous finding, but I question thewisdom of deciding an issue based on a factual premise that
does not exist in this case, and in the judgment of the Courtwill exist in the future only in "extraordinary circumstance[s]," ante, at 1017.Clearly, the Court was eager to decide this case.

7 But

eagerness, in the absence of proper jurisdiction, must--andin this case should have been--met with restraint.

III
The Court's willingness to dispense with precedent in itshaste to reach a result is not limited to its initial jurisdictional decision. The Court also alters the long-settled rulesof review.

The South Carolina Supreme Court's decision to defer tolegislative judgments in the absence of a challenge from petitioner comports with one of this Court's oldest maxims:"[T]he existence of facts supporting the legislative judgment
is to be presumed." United States v. Carolene Products Co.,304 U. S. 144, 152 (1938). Indeed, we have said the legislature's judgment is "well-nigh conclusive." Berman v. Par7 The Court overlooks the lack of a ripe and justiciable claim apparently
out of concern that in the absence of its intervention Lucas will be unable
to obtain further adjudication of his temporary takings claim. The Court
chastises respondent for arguing that Lucas' temporary takings claim is
premature because it failed "so much as [to] commen[t]" upon the effect of
the South Carolina Supreme Court's decision on petitioner's ability to obtain relief for the 2-year period, and it frets that Lucas would "be unable
(absent our intervention now) to obtain further state-court adjudication
with respect to the 1988-1990 period." Ante, at 1012. Whatever the explanation for the Court's intense interest in Lucas' plight when ordinarily
we are more cautious in granting discretionary review, the concern would
have been more prudently expressed by vacating the judgment below and
remanding for further consideration in light of the 1990 amendments. At
that point, petitioner could have brought a temporary takings claim in the
state courts.

ker, 348 U. S. 26, 32 (1954). See also Sweet v. Rechel, 159U. S. 380, 392 (1895); Euclid, 272 U. S., at 388 ("If the validity

of the legislative classification for zoning purposes be fairlydebatable, the legislative judgment must be allowed to
control").Accordingly, this Court always has required plaintiffs challenging the constitutionality of an ordinance to provide"some factual foundation of record" that contravenes the legislative findings. O'Gorman & Young, 282 U. S., at 258. Inthe absence of such proof, "the presumption of constitutionality must prevail." Id., at 257. We only recently have re-affirmed that claimants have the burden of showing a state
law constitutes a taking. See Keystone Bituminous Coal,480 U. S., at 485. See also Goldblatt, 369 U. S., at 594 (citing
"the usual presumption of constitutionality" that applies tostatutes attacked as takings).

Rather than invoking these traditional rules, the Court de-cides the State has the burden to convince the courts that its
legislative judgments are correct. Despite Lucas' completefailure to contest the legislature's findings of serious harm to
life and property if a permanent structure is built, the Courtdecides that the legislative findings are not sufficient to justify the use prohibition. Instead, the Court "emphasize[s]"the State must do more than merely proffer its legislative
judgments to avoid invalidating its law. Ante, at 1031. Inthis case, apparently, the State now has the burden of showing the regulation is not a taking. The Court offers no justi-fication for its sudden hostility toward state legislators, and
I doubt that it could. IV

The Court does not reject the South Carolina SupremeCourt's decision simply on the basis of its disbelief and distrust of the legislature's findings. It also takes the opportu-nity to create a new scheme for regulations that eliminate
all economic value. From now on, there is a categorical rulefinding these regulations to be a taking unless the use they

prohibit is a background common-law nuisance or propertyprinciple. See ante, at 1028-1031.

A
I first question the Court's rationale in creating a categorythat obviates a "case-specific inquiry into the public interest

advanced," ante, at 1015, if all economic value has been lost.If one fact about the Court's takings jurisprudence can be
stated without contradiction, it is that "the particular cir-cumstances of each case" determine whether a specific restriction will be rendered invalid by the government's failureto pay compensation.

United States v. Central Eureka Min-ing Co., 357 U. S. 155, 168 (1958). This is so because although we have articulated certain factors to be considered,including the economic impact on the property owner, the
ultimate conclusion "necessarily requires a weighing of pri-vate and public interests."

Agins, 447 U. S., at 261. Whenthe government regulation prevents the owner from any economically valuable use of his property, the private interestis unquestionably substantial, but we have never before held
that no public interest can outweigh it. Instead the Court'sprior decisions "uniformly reject the proposition that diminution in property value, standing alone, can establish a `tak-ing.' "

Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S.104, 131 (1978).

This Court repeatedly has recognized the ability of gov-ernment, in certain circumstances, to regulate property
without compensation no matter how adverse the financialeffect on the owner may be. More than a century ago, the
Court explicitly upheld the right of States to prohibit usesof property injurious to public health, safety, or welfare
without paying compensation: "A prohibition simply uponthe use of property for purposes that are declared, by valid
legislation, to be injurious to the health, morals, or safety ofthe community, cannot, in any just sense, be deemed a taking
or an appropriation of property." Mugler v. Kansas, 123

U. S., at 668-669. On this basis, the Court upheld an ordi-nance effectively prohibiting operation of a previously lawful

brewery, although the "establishments will become of novalue as property." Id., at 664; see also id., at 668.

Mugler was only the beginning in a long line of cases.8 InPowell v. Pennsylvania, 127 U. S. 678 (1888), the Court upheld legislation prohibiting the manufacture of oleomarga-rine, despite the owner's allegation that "if prevented from
continuing it, the value of his property employed thereinwould be entirely lost and he be deprived of the means of
livelihood." Id., at 682. In Hadacheck v. Sebastian, 239
U. S. 394 (1915), the Court upheld an ordinance prohibiting abrickyard, although the owner had made excavations on the

land that prevented it from being utilized for any purpose
but a brickyard. Id., at 405. In Miller v. Schoene, 276 U. S.272 (1928), the Court held that the Fifth Amendment did not

require Virginia to pay compensation to the owner of cedartrees ordered destroyed to prevent a disease from spreading
to nearby apple orchards. The "preferment of [the publicinterest] over the property interest of the individual, to the
extent even of its destruction, is one of the distinguishingcharacteristics of every exercise of the police power which
affects property." Id., at 280. Again, in Omnia Commercial Co. v. United States, 261 U. S. 502 (1923), the Courtstated that "destruction of, or injury to, property is frequently accomplished without a `taking' in the constitutionalsense."

Id., at 508.
More recently, in Goldblatt, the Court upheld a town regu-lation that barred continued operation of an existing sand

and gravel operation in order to protect public safety. 369

8 Prior to Mugler, the Court had held that owners whose real property
is wholly destroyed to prevent the spread of a fire are not entitled to
compensation. Bowditch v. Boston, 101 U. S. 16, 18-19 (1880). And the
Court recognized in the License Cases, 5 How. 504, 589 (1847) (opinion of

often to the destruction of property."

even if the ordinance denied the owner all use, it could be
justified as a safety measure.10 Id., at 313. And in Keystone Bituminous Coal, the Court summarized over 100years of precedent: "[T]he Court has repeatedly upheld regulations that destroy or adversely affect real property interests." 11 480 U. S., at 489, n. 18.

Blackmun, J., dissenting
The Court recognizes that "our prior opinions have suggested that `harmful or noxious uses' of property may be
proscribed by government regulation without the requirement of compensation," ante, at 1022, but seeks to reconcile
them with its categorical rule by claiming that the Court
never has upheld a regulation when the owner alleged the
loss of all economic value. Even if the Court's factual premise were correct, its understanding of the Court's cases is
distorted. In none of the cases did the Court suggest that
the right of a State to prohibit certain activities without paying compensation turned on the availability of some residual
valuable use.12 Instead, the cases depended on whether the

if total value has been taken. The Court has indicated that proof that a
regulation does not deny an owner economic use of his property is sufficient to defeat a facial takings challenge. See Hodel v. Virginia Surface
Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 295-297 (1981). But
the conclusion that a regulation is not on its face a taking because it allows
the landowner some economic use of property is a far cry from the proposition that denial of such use is sufficient to establish a takings claim regardless of any other consideration. The Court never has accepted the latter
proposition.

The Court relies today on dicta in Agins, Hodel, Nollan v. California
Coastal Comm'n, 483 U. S. 825 (1987), and Keystone Bituminous Coal
Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U. S. 470 (1987), for its new categorical rule.
Ante, at 1015-1016. I prefer to rely on the directly contrary holdings in
cases such as Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623 (1887), and Hadacheck v.
Sebastian, 239 U. S. 394 (1915), not to mention contrary statements in the
very cases on which the Court relies. See Agins, 447 U. S., at 260-262;
Keystone Bituminous Coal, 480 U. S., at 489, n. 18, 491-492.

12 Miller v. Schoene, 276 U. S. 272 (1928), is an example. In the course

of demonstrating that apple trees are more valuable than red cedar trees,
the Court noted that red cedar has "occasional use and value as lumber."
Id., at 279. But the Court did not discuss whether the timber owned by
the petitioner in that case was commercially salable, and nothing in the
opinion suggests that the State's right to require uncompensated felling
of the trees depended on any such salvage value. To the contrary, it is
clear from its unanimous opinion that the Schoene Court would have sustained a law requiring the burning of cedar trees if that had been necessary to protect apple trees in which there was a public interest: The Court

government interest was sufficient to prohibit the activity,
given the significant private cost.13

These cases rest on the principle that the State has full
power to prohibit an owner's use of property if it is harmful
to the public. "[S]ince no individual has a right to use his
property so as to create a nuisance or otherwise harm others,
the State has not `taken' anything when it asserts its power
to enjoin the nuisance-like activity." Keystone Bituminous
Coal, 480 U. S., at 491, n. 20. It would make no sense under
this theory to suggest that an owner has a constitutionally
protected right to harm others, if only he makes the proper
showing of economic loss.14 See Pennsylvania Coal Co. v.
Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, 418 (1922) (Brandeis, J., dissenting)
("Restriction upon [harmful] use does not become inappropriate as a means, merely because it deprives the owner of
the only use to which the property can then be profitably
put").

spoke of preferment of the public interest over the property interest of
the individual, "to the extent even of its destruction." Id., at 280.

13 The Court seeks to disavow the holdings and reasoning of Mugler and

subsequent cases by explaining that they were the Court's early efforts to
define the scope of the police power. There is language in the earliest
takings cases suggesting that the police power was considered to be the
power simply to prevent harms. Subsequently, the Court expanded its
understanding of what were government's legitimate interests. But it
does not follow that the holding of those early cases--that harmful and
noxious uses of property can be forbidden whatever the harm to the property owner and without the payment of compensation--was repudiated.
To the contrary, as the Court consciously expanded the scope of the police
power beyond preventing harm, it clarified that there was a core of public
interests that overrode any private interest. See Keystone Bituminous
Coal, 480 U. S., at 491, n. 20.

14 "Indeed, it would be extraordinary to construe the Constitution to

require a government to compensate private landowners because it denied
them `the right' to use property which cannot be used without risking

Ultimately even the Court cannot embrace the full implications of its per se rule: It eventually agrees that there cannot
be a categorical rule for a taking based on economic value
that wholly disregards the public need asserted. Instead,
the Court decides that it will permit a State to regulate all
economic value only if the State prohibits uses that would
not be permitted under "background principles of nuisance
and property law." 15 Ante, at 1031.

Until today, the Court explicitly had rejected the contention that the government's power to act without paying compensation turns on whether the prohibited activity is a
common-law nuisance.16 The brewery closed in Mugler itself was not a common-law nuisance, and the Court specifically stated that it was the role of the legislature to deter15 Although it refers to state nuisance and property law, the Court apparently does not mean just any state nuisance and property law. Public
nuisance was first a common-law creation, see Newark, The Boundaries of
Nuisance, 65 L. Q. Rev. 480, 482 (1949) (attributing development of nuisance to 1535), but by the 1800's in both the United States and England,
legislatures had the power to define what is a public nuisance, and particular uses often have been selectively targeted. See Prosser, Private Action for Public Nuisance, 52 Va. L. Rev. 997, 999-1000 (1966); J. Stephen,
A General View of the Criminal Law of England 105-107 (2d ed. 1890).
The Court's references to "common-law" background principles, however,
indicate that legislative determinations do not constitute "state nuisance
and property law" for the Court.

16 Also, until today the fact that the regulation prohibited uses that were

lawful at the time the owner purchased did not determine the constitutional question. The brewery, the brickyard, the cedar trees, and the
gravel pit were all perfectly legitimate uses prior to the passage of the
regulation. See Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S., at 654; Hadacheck v. Sebastian, 239 U. S. 394 (1915); Miller, 276 U. S., at 272; Goldblatt v. Hempstead,
369 U. S. 590 (1962). This Court explicitly acknowledged in Hadacheck
that "[a] vested interest cannot be asserted against [the police power] because of conditions once obtaining. To so hold would preclude development and fix a city forever in its primitive conditions." 239 U. S., at 410
(citation omitted).

mine what measures would be appropriate for the protection
of public health and safety. See 123 U. S., at 661. In upholding the state action in Miller, the Court found it unnecessary to "weigh with nicety the question whether the infected cedars constitute a nuisance according to common law;
or whether they may be so declared by statute." 276 U. S.,
at 280. See also Goldblatt, 369 U. S., at 593; Hadacheck, 239
U. S., at 411. Instead the Court has relied in the past, as
the South Carolina court has done here, on legislative judgments of what constitutes a harm.17

The Court rejects the notion that the State always can
prohibit uses it deems a harm to the public without granting compensation because "the distinction between `harmpreventing' and `benefit-conferring' regulation is often in the
eye of the beholder." Ante, at 1024. Since the characterization will depend "primarily upon one's evaluation of the
worth of competing uses of real estate," ante, at 1025, the
Court decides a legislative judgment of this kind no longer
can provide the desired "objective, value-free basis" for
upholding a regulation, ante, at 1026. The Court, however,
fails to explain how its proposed common-law alternative
escapes the same trap.

17 The Court argues that finding no taking when the legislature prohibits
a harmful use, such as the Court did in Mugler and the South Carolina
Supreme Court did in the instant case, would nullify Pennsylvania Coal.
See ante, at 1022-1023. Justice Holmes, the author of Pennsylvania
Coal, joined Miller v. Schoene, 276 U. S. 272 (1928), six years later. In
Miller, the Court adopted the exact approach of the South Carolina court:
It found the cedar trees harmful, and their destruction not a taking,
whether or not they were a nuisance. Justice Holmes apparently believed
that such an approach did not repudiate his earlier opinion. Moreover,
this Court already has been over this ground five years ago, and at that
point rejected the assertion that Pennsylvania Coal was inconsistent
with Mugler, Hadacheck, Miller, or the others in the string of "noxious
use" cases, recognizing instead that the nature of the State's action is
critical in takings analysis. Keystone Bituminous Coal, 480 U. S., at 490.

The threshold inquiry for imposition of the Court's newrule, "deprivation of all economically valuable use," itself

cannot be determined objectively. As the Court admits,whether the owner has been deprived of all economic value
of his property will depend on how "property" is defined.The "composition of the denominator in our `deprivation'
fraction," ante, at 1017, n. 7, is the dispositive inquiry. Yetthere is no "objective" way to define what that denominator
should be. "We have long understood that any land-use reg-ulation can be characterized as the `total' deprivation of an
aptly defined entitlement. . . . Alternatively, the same regula-tion can always be characterized as a mere `partial' withdrawal from full, unencumbered ownership of the landhold-ing affected by the regulation . . . ."

18 Michelman, Takings,

1987, 88 Colum. L. Rev. 1600, 1614 (1988).The Court's decision in

Keystone Bituminous Coal illus-trates this principle perfectly. In

Keystone, the Court de-termined that the "support estate" was "merely a part of the

entire bundle of rights possessed by the owner." 480 U. S.,at 501. Thus, the Court concluded that the support estate's
destruction merely eliminated one segment of the total prop-erty. Ibid. The dissent, however, characterized the support estate as a distinct property interest that was whollydestroyed.

Id., at 519. The Court could agree on no"value-free basis" to resolve this dispute.

Even more perplexing, however, is the Court's reliance oncommon-law principles of nuisance in its quest for a valuefree takings jurisprudence. In determining what is a nui-sance at common law, state courts make exactly the decision
that the Court finds so troubling when made by the SouthCarolina General Assembly today: They determine whether
the use is harmful. Common-law public and private nui18 See also Michelman, Property, Utility, and Fairness, Comments on the

sance law is simply a determination whether a particular usecauses harm. See Prosser, Private Action for Public Nuisance, 52 Va. L. Rev. 997 (1966) ("Nuisance is a French wordwhich means nothing more than harm"). There is nothing
magical in the reasoning of judges long dead. They deter-mined a harm in the same way as state judges and legislatures do today. If judges in the 18th and 19th centuries candistinguish a harm from a benefit, why not judges in the
20th century, and if judges can, why not legislators? Theresimply is no reason to believe that new interpretations of
the hoary common-law nuisance doctrine will be particularly"objective" or "value free."

19 Once one abandons the level

of generality of sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas, ante, at1031, one searches in vain, I think, for anything resembling a

principle in the common law of nuisance.

Finally, the Court justifies its new rule that the legislaturemay not deprive a property owner of the only economically

valuable use of his land, even if the legislature finds it to be aharmful use, because such action is not part of the " `long recognized' " "understandings of our citizens." Ante, at 1027.These "understandings" permit such regulation only if the use
is a nuisance under the common law. Any other course is"inconsistent with the historical compact recorded in the Takings Clause." Ante, at 1028. It is not clear from the Court's

opinion where our "historical compact" or "citizens' under-standing" comes from, but it does not appear to be history.

The principle that the State should compensate individualsfor property taken for public use was not widely established
in America at the time of the Revolution.

"The colonists . . . inherited . . . a concept of property whichpermitted extensive regulation of the use of that property

for the public benefit--regulation that could even go so faras to deny all productive use of the property to the owner
if, as Coke himself stated, the regulation `extends to thepublic benefit . . . for this is for the public, and every one
hath benefit by it.' " F. Bosselman, D. Callies, & J. Banta,The Taking Issue 80-81 (1973), quoting The Case of the
King's Prerogative in Saltpetre, 12 Co. Rep. 12-13 (1606)(hereinafter Bosselman).

See also Treanor, The Origins and Original Significance ofthe Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment, 94
Yale L. J. 694, 697, n. 9 (1985).20Even into the 19th century, state governments often felt
free to take property for roads and other public projectswithout paying compensation to the owners.

was meant to preserve economic value. Id., at 58-59.

holders' demand for compensation when the State took their land to build

made for compensation for the soil or freehold of the lands." Lindsay v.

Although, prior to the adoption of the Bill of Rights,America was replete with land-use regulations describing

which activities were considered noxious and forbidden, seeBender, The Takings Clause: Principles or Politics?, 34
Buffalo L. Rev. 735, 751 (1985); L. Friedman, A History ofAmerican Law 66-68 (1973), the Fifth Amendment's Takings
Clause originally did not extend to regulations of property,whatever the effect.

23 See ante, at 1014. Most state courts

agreed with this narrow interpretation of a taking. "Untilthe end of the nineteenth century . . . jurists held that

22 Only the Constitutions of Vermont and Massachusetts required that
compensation be paid when private property was taken for public use; and
although eminent domain was mentioned in the Pennsylvania Constitution,
its sole requirement was that property not be taken without the consent
of the legislature. See Grant, The "Higher Law" Background of the Law
of Eminent Domain, in 2 Selected Essays on Constitutional Law 912, 915-
916 (1938). By 1868, five of the original States still had no just compensation clauses in their Constitutions. Ibid.

23 James Madison, author of the Takings Clause, apparently intended it

to apply only to direct, physical takings of property by the Federal Government. See Treanor, The Origins and Original Significance of the Just
Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment, 94 Yale L. J. 694, 711
(1985). Professor Sax argues that although "contemporaneous commentary upon the meaning of the compensation clause is in very short supply,"
74 Yale L. J., at 58, the "few authorities that are available" indicate that
the Clause was "designed to prevent arbitrary government action," not to
protect economic value. Id., at 58-60.

Clause: The Role of the Property-Privilege Distinction and
"Takings" Clause Jurisprudence, 60 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1, 76
(1986); Bosselman 106. Even indirect and consequential injuries to property resulting from regulations were excluded
from the definition of a taking. See ibid.; Callender v.
Marsh, 1 Pick. 418, 430 (Mass. 1823).

Even when courts began to consider that regulation in
some situations could constitute a taking, they continued to
uphold bans on particular uses without paying compensation,
notwithstanding the economic impact, under the rationale
that no one can obtain a vested right to injure or endanger
the public.24 In the Coates cases, for example, the Supreme
Court of New York found no taking in New York's ban on
the interment of the dead within the city, although "no other
use can be made of these lands." Coates v. City of New
York, 7 Cow. 585, 592 (N. Y. 1827). See also Brick Presbyterian Church v. City of New York, 5 Cow. 538 (N. Y. 1826);
Commonwealth v. Alger, 7 Cush. 53, 59, 104 (Mass. 1851); St.

370 P. 2d 342, appeal dism'd, 371 U. S. 36 (1962); Nassr v.

24 For this reason, the retroactive application of the regulation to formerly lawful uses was not a controlling distinction in the past. "Nor can
it make any difference that the right is purchased previous to the passage
of the by-law," for "[e]very right, from an absolute ownership in property,
down to a mere easement, is purchased and holden subject to the restriction, that it shall be so exercised as not to injure others. Though, at the
time, it be remote and inoffensive, the purchaser is bound to know, at his
peril, that it may become otherwise." Coates v. City of New York, 7 Cow.

In addition, state courts historically have been less likely
to find that a government action constitutes a taking when
the affected land is undeveloped. According to the South
Carolina court, the power of the legislature to take unimproved land without providing compensation was sanctioned
by "ancient rights and principles." Lindsay v. Commissioners, 2 S. C. L. 38, 57 (1796). "Except for Massachusetts, no
colony appears to have paid compensation when it built a
state-owned road across unimproved land. Legislatures
provided compensation only for enclosed or improved land."
Treanor, 94 Yale L. J., at 695 (footnotes omitted). This rule
was followed by some States into the 1800's. See Horwitz
63-65.

With similar result, the common agrarian conception of
property limited owners to "natural" uses of their land prior
to and during much of the 18th century. See id., at 32.
Thus, for example, the owner could build nothing on his land
that would alter the natural flow of water. See id., at 44;
see also, e. g., Merritt v. Parker, 1 Coxe 460, 463 (N. J. 1795).
Some more recent state courts still follow this reasoning.
See, e. g., Just v. Marinette County, 56 Wis. 2d 7, 201
N. W. 2d 761, 768 (1972).

Nor does history indicate any common-law limit on the
State's power to regulate harmful uses even to the point of
destroying all economic value. Nothing in the discussions
in Congress concerning the Takings Clause indicates that the
Clause was limited by the common-law nuisance doctrine.
Common-law courts themselves rejected such an understanding. They regularly recognized that it is "for the legislature to interpose, and by positive enactment to prohibit
a use of property which would be injurious to the public."

Tewksbury, 11 Metc., at 57.25 Chief Justice Shaw explainedin upholding a regulation prohibiting construction of

common law or not." Alger, 7 Cush., at 104; see also Statev.

Paul, 5 R. I. 185, 193 (1858); Commonwealth v. Parks, 155Mass. 531, 532, 30 N. E. 174 (1892) (Holmes, J.) ("[T]he legislature may change the common law as to nuisances, and maymove the line either way, so as to make things nuisances
which were not so, or to make things lawful which werenuisances").

In short, I find no clear and accepted "historical compact"or "understanding of our citizens" justifying the Court's new
takings doctrine. Instead, the Court seems to treat historyas a grab bag of principles, to be adopted where they support
the Court's theory, and ignored where they do not. If theCourt decided that the early common law provides the background principles for interpreting the Takings Clause, thenregulation, as opposed to physical confiscation, would not be
compensable. If the Court decided that the law of a laterperiod provides the background principles, then regulation
might be compensable, but the Court would have to confrontthe fact that legislatures regularly determined which uses
were prohibited, independent of the common law, and inde-pendent of whether the uses were lawful when the owner
purchased. What makes the Court's analysis unworkable isits attempt to package the law of two incompatible eras and
peddle it as historical fact.26

25 More recent state-court decisions agree. See, e. g., Lane v. Mt. Vernon, 38 N. Y. 2d 344, 348-349, 342 N. E. 2d 571, 573 (1976); Commonwealth
v. Baker, 160 Pa. Super. 640, 641-642, 53 A. 2d 829, 830 (1947).

26 The Court asserts that all early American experience, prior to and

after passage of the Bill of Rights, and any case law prior to 1897 are
"entirely irrelevant" in determining what is "the historical compact recorded in the Takings Clause." Ante, at 1028, and n. 15. Nor apparently
are we to find this compact in the early federal takings cases, which clearly
permitted prohibition of harmful uses despite the alleged loss of all value,

The Court makes sweeping and, in my view, misguidedand unsupported changes in our takings doctrine. While it

limits these changes to the most narrow subset of govern-ment regulation--those that eliminate all economic value
from land--these changes go far beyond what is necessaryto secure petitioner Lucas' private benefit. One hopes they
do not go beyond the narrow confines the Court assigns themto today.

I dissent.
Justice Stevens, dissenting.
Today the Court restricts one judge-made rule and ex-pands another. In my opinion it errs on both counts.

Proper application of the doctrine of judicial restraint wouldavoid the premature adjudication of an important constitutional question. Proper respect for our precedents wouldavoid an illogical expansion of the concept of "regulatory
takings." I

As the Court notes, ante, at 1010-1011, South Carolina'sBeachfront Management Act has been amended to permit
some construction of residences seaward of the line that frus-trated petitioner's proposed use of his property. Until he exhausts his right to apply for a special permit under that amend-ment, petitioner is not entitled to an adjudication by this Court
of the merits of his permanent takings claim. MacDonald,
Sommer & Frates v. Yolo County, 477 U. S. 340, 351 (1986).It is also not clear that he has a viable "temporary takings" claim. If we assume that petitioner is now able tobuild on the lot, the only injury that he may have suffered is

whether or not the prohibition was a common-law nuisance, and whether
or not the prohibition occurred subsequent to the purchase. See supra,
at 1047-1048, 1052-1053, and n. 16. I cannot imagine where the Court
finds its "historical compact," if not in history.

the delay caused by the temporary existence of the absolutestatutory ban on construction. We cannot be sure, however,

that that delay caused petitioner any harm because the rec-ord does not tell us whether his building plans were even
temporarily frustrated by the enactment of the statute.1Thus, on the present record it is entirely possible that petitioner has suffered no injury in fact even if the state statutewas unconstitutional when he filed this lawsuit.

It is true, as the Court notes, that the argument againstdeciding the constitutional issue in this case rests on prudential considerations rather than a want of jurisdiction. Ithink it equally clear, however, that a Court less eager to
decide the merits would follow the wise counsel of JusticeBrandeis in his deservedly famous concurring opinion in
Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 341 (1936). As he ex-plained, the Court has developed "for its own governance in
the cases confessedly within its jurisdiction, a series of rulesunder which it has avoided passing upon a large part of all
the constitutional questions pressed upon it for decision."Id., at 346. The second of those rules applies directly to
this case.

decision of the case.' Burton v. United States, 196 U. S.283, 295." Id., at 346-347.

Cavalierly dismissing the doctrine of judicial restraint, theCourt today tersely announces that "we do not think it prudent to apply that prudential requirement here." Ante, at

18 months before the statute was passed; there is no evidence that he ever
sought a building permit from the local authorities.

1013. I respectfully disagree and would save considerationof the merits for another day. Since, however, the Court

has reached the merits, I shall do so as well.

II
In its analysis of the merits, the Court starts from thepremise that this Court has adopted a "categorical rule that

total regulatory takings must be compensated," ante, at1026, and then sets itself to the task of identifying the exceptional cases in which a State may be relieved of this cate-gorical obligation, ante, at 1027-1029. The test the Court
announces is that the regulation must "do no more thanduplicate the result that could have been achieved" under a
State's nuisance law. Ante, at 1029. Under this test thecategorical rule will apply unless the regulation merely
makes explicit what was otherwise an implicit limitation onthe owner's property rights.

In my opinion, the Court is doubly in error. The categori-cal rule the Court establishes is an unsound and unwise addition to the law and the Court's formulation of the exceptionto that rule is too rigid and too narrow.

The Categorical Rule

As the Court recognizes, ante, at 1015, Pennsylvania Coal
Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393 (1922), provides no support forits--or, indeed, any--categorical rule. To the contrary, Justice Holmes recognized that such absolute rules ill fit theinquiry into "regulatory takings." Thus, in the paragraph
that contains his famous observation that a regulation maygo "too far" and thereby constitute a taking, the Justice
wrote: "As we already have said, this is a question of de-gree--and therefore cannot be disposed of by general propositions." Id., at 416. What he had "already . . . said" madeperfectly clear that Justice Holmes regarded economic injury
to be merely one factor to be weighed: "One fact for consider-ation in determining such limits is the extent of the diminu505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:22 PAGES OPINPGT

Stevens, J., dissenting
tion [of value.] So the question depends upon the particularfacts." Id., at 413.

Nor does the Court's new categorical rule find support indecisions following Mahon. Although in dicta we have
sometimes recited that a law "effects a taking if [it] . . . de-nies an owner economically viable use of his land,"

Agins v.City of Tiburon, 447 U. S. 255, 260 (1980), our rulings have

rejected such an absolute position. We have frequently--and recently--held that, in some circumstances, a law that
renders property valueless may nonetheless not constitute ataking. See, e. g., First English Evangelical Lutheran
Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U. S. 304,313 (1987);

Goldblatt v. Hempstead, 369 U. S. 590, 596 (1962);United States v. Caltex, 344 U. S. 149, 155 (1952); Miller v.

Schoene, 276 U. S. 272 (1928); Hadacheck v. Sebastian, 239U. S. 394, 405 (1915); Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623, 657
(1887); cf. Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U. S. 986, 1011(1984); Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation,

475 U. S. 211, 225 (1986). In short, as we stated in Keystone
Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U. S. 470, 490(1987), " `Although a comparison of values before and after'

a regulatory action `is relevant, . . . it is by no meansconclusive.' "

In addition to lacking support in past decisions, the Court'snew rule is wholly arbitrary. A landowner whose property
is diminished in value 95% recovers nothing, while an ownerwhose property is diminished 100% recovers the land's full
value. The case at hand illustrates this arbitrariness well.The Beachfront Management Act not only prohibited the
building of new dwellings in certain areas, it also prohibitedthe rebuilding of houses that were "destroyed beyond repair
by natural causes or by fire." 1988 S. C. Acts 634, $ 3; seealso

Esposito v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 939 F. 2d165, 167 (CA4 1991).

Stevens, J., dissenting
lot were destroyed by a hurricane one day after the Act tookeffect, the owners would not be able to rebuild, nor would

they be assured recovery. Under the Court's categorical ap-proach, Lucas (who has lost the opportunity to build) recovers, while his neighbors (who have lost both the opportunity
to build and their homes) do not recover. The arbitrarinessof such a rule is palpable.

Moreover, because of the elastic nature of property rights,the Court's new rule will also prove unsound in practice. In
response to the rule, courts may define "property" broadlyand only rarely find regulations to effect total takings. This
is the approach the Court itself adopts in its revisionist read-ing of venerable precedents. We are told that--notwithstanding the Court's findings to the contrary in each case--
the brewery in Mugler, the brickyard in Hadacheck, and thegravel pit in

Goldblatt all could be put to "other uses" and
that, therefore, those cases did not involve total regulatory
takings.3 Ante, at 1026, n. 13.

On the other hand, developers and investors may market
specialized estates to take advantage of the Court's new rule.
The smaller the estate, the more likely that a regulatory
change will effect a total taking. Thus, an investor may, for
example, purchase the right to build a multifamily home on
a specific lot, with the result that a zoning regulation that

3 Of course, the same could easily be said in this case: Lucas may put his
land to "other uses"--fishing or camping, for example--or may sell his
land to his neighbors as a buffer. In either event, his land is far from
"valueless."

This highlights a fundamental weakness in the Court's analysis: its failure to explain why only the impairment of "economically beneficial or
productive use," ante, at 1015 (emphasis added), of property is relevant in
takings analysis. I should think that a regulation arbitrarily prohibiting
an owner from continuing to use her property for bird watching or sunbathing might constitute a taking under some circumstances; and, conversely, that such uses are of value to the owner. Yet the Court offers no
basis for its assumption that the only uses of property cognizable under
the Constitution are developmental uses.

505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:22 PAGES OPINPGT
1066 LUCAS v. SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCIL

Stevens, J., dissenting
allows only single-family homes would render the investor's
property interest "valueless." 4 In short, the categorical
rule will likely have one of two effects: Either courts will
alter the definition of the "denominator" in the takings "fraction," rendering the Court's categorical rule meaningless, or
investors will manipulate the relevant property interests,
giving the Court's rule sweeping effect. To my mind, neither of these results is desirable or appropriate, and both are
distortions of our takings jurisprudence.

Finally, the Court's justification for its new categorical
rule is remarkably thin. The Court mentions in passing
three arguments in support of its rule; none is convincing.
First, the Court suggests that "total deprivation of feasible
use is, from the landowner's point of view, the equivalent of
a physical appropriation." Ante, at 1017. This argument
proves too much. From the "landowner's point of view," a
regulation that diminishes a lot's value by 50% is as well "the
equivalent" of the condemnation of half of the lot. Yet, it is
well established that a 50% diminution in value does not by
itself constitute a taking. See Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co.,
272 U. S. 365, 384 (1926) (75% diminution in value). Thus,
the landowner's perception of the regulation cannot justify
the Court's new rule.

Second, the Court emphasizes that because total takings
are "relatively rare" its new rule will not adversely affect
the government's ability to "go on." Ante, at 1018. This
argument proves too little. Certainly it is true that defining
a small class of regulations that are per se takings will not

4 This unfortunate possibility is created by the Court's subtle revision of
the "total regulatory takings" dicta. In past decisions, we have stated
that a regulation effects a taking if it "denies an owner economically viable
use of his land," Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U. S. 255, 260 (1980) (emphasis added), indicating that this "total takings" test did not apply to
other estates. Today, however, the Court suggests that a regulation may
effect a total taking of any real property interest. See ante, at 1016-
1017, n. 7.

Stevens, J., dissenting
greatly hinder important governmental functions--but this
is true of any small class of regulations. The Court's suggestion only begs the question of why regulations of this
particular class should always be found to effect takings.

Finally, the Court suggests that "regulations that leave
the owner . . . without economically beneficial . . . use . . .
carry with them a heightened risk that private property is
being pressed into some form of public service." Ibid. As
discussed more fully below, see Part III, infra, I agree that
the risks of such singling out are of central concern in
takings law. However, such risks do not justify a per se rule
for total regulatory takings. There is no necessary correlation between "singling out" and total takings: A regulation
may single out a property owner without depriving him of
all of his property, see, e. g., Nollan v. California Coastal
Comm'n, 483 U. S. 825, 837 (1987); J. E. D. Associates, Inc. v.
Atkinson, 121 N. H. 581, 432 A. 2d 12 (1981); and it may
deprive him of all of his property without singling him out,
see, e. g., Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623 (1887); Hadacheck
v. Sebastian, 239 U. S. 394 (1915). What matters in such
cases is not the degree of diminution of value, but rather
the specificity of the expropriating act. For this reason, the
Court's third justification for its new rule also fails.

In short, the Court's new rule is unsupported by prior decisions, arbitrary and unsound in practice, and theoretically
unjustified. In my opinion, a categorical rule as important
as the one established by the Court today should be supported by more history or more reason than has yet been
provided.

The Nuisance Exception

Like many bright-line rules, the categorical rule established in this case is only "categorical" for a page or two in
the U. S. Reports. No sooner does the Court state that
"total regulatory takings must be compensated," ante, at
1026, than it quickly establishes an exception to that rule.

1068 LUCAS v. SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCIL

Stevens, J., dissenting
The exception provides that a regulation that rendersproperty valueless is not a taking if it prohibits uses of property that were not "previously permissible under relevantproperty and nuisance principles."

Ante, at 1029-1030.
The Court thus rejects the basic holding in Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623 (1887). There we held that a statewidestatute that prohibited the owner of a brewery from making

alcoholic beverages did not effect a taking, even though theuse of the property had been perfectly lawful and caused no
public harm before the statute was enacted. We squarelyrejected the rule the Court adopts today:

"It is true, that, when the defendants . . . erected theirbreweries, the laws of the State did not forbid the manufacture of intoxicating liquors. But the State did notthereby give any assurance, or come under an obligation, that its legislation upon that subject would remainunchanged. [T]he supervision of the public health and
the public morals is a governmental power, `continuing
in its nature,' and `to be dealt with as the special exigen-cies of the moment may require;' . . . `for this purpose,

the largest legislative discretion is allowed, and the dis-cretion cannot be parted with any more than the power
itself.' " Id., at 669.
Under our reasoning in Mugler, a State's decision to prohibit or to regulate certain uses of property is not a compen-sable taking just because the particular uses were previously

lawful. Under the Court's opinion today, however, if a Stateshould decide to prohibit the manufacture of asbestos, cigarettes, or concealable firearms, for example, it must be prepared to pay for the adverse economic consequences of its
decision. One must wonder if government will be able to
"go on" effectively if it must risk compensation "for every
such change in the general law." Mahon, 260 U. S., at 413.

The Court's holding today effectively freezes the State's
common law, denying the legislature much of its traditional

Stevens, J., dissenting
power to revise the law governing the rights and uses of
property. Until today, I had thought that we had long abandoned this approach to constitutional law. More than a century ago we recognized that "the great office of statutes is
to remedy defects in the common law as they are developed,
and to adapt it to the changes of time and circumstances."
Munn v. Illinois, 94 U. S. 113, 134 (1877). As Justice Marshall observed about a position similar to that adopted by
the Court today:

"If accepted, that claim would represent a return to the
era of Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905), when
common-law rights were also found immune from revision by State or Federal Government. Such an approach would freeze the common law as it has been constructed by the courts, perhaps at its 19th-century state
of development. It would allow no room for change in
response to changes in circumstance. The Due Process
Clause does not require such a result." PruneYard
Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U. S. 74, 93 (1980) (concurring opinion).

Arresting the development of the common law is not only
a departure from our prior decisions; it is also profoundly
unwise. The human condition is one of constant learning
and evolution--both moral and practical. Legislatures implement that new learning; in doing so they must often revise the definition of property and the rights of property
owners. Thus, when the Nation came to understand that
slavery was morally wrong and mandated the emancipation
of all slaves, it, in effect, redefined "property." On a lesser
scale, our ongoing self-education produces similar changes
in the rights of property owners: New appreciation of the
significance of endangered species, see, e. g., Andrus v. Allard, 444 U. S. 51 (1979); the importance of wetlands, see,
e. g., 16 U. S. C. $ 3801 et seq.; and the vulnerability of coastal

lands, see, e. g., 16 U. S. C. $ 1451 et seq., shapes our evolvingunderstandings of property rights.

Of course, some legislative redefinitions of property willeffect a taking and must be compensated--but it certainly
cannot be the case that every movement away from commonlaw does so. There is no reason, and less sense, in such an
absolute rule. We live in a world in which changes in theeconomy and the environment occur with increasing frequency and importance. If it was wise a century ago toallow government " `the largest legislative discretion' " to
deal with " `the special exigencies of the moment,' " Mugler,123 U. S., at 669, it is imperative to do so today. The rule
that should govern a decision in a case of this kind shouldfocus on the future, not the past.

5

The Court's categorical approach rule will, I fear, greatlyhamper the efforts of local officials and planners who must

deal with increasingly complex problems in land-use and en-vironmental regulation. As this case--in which the claims
of an individual property owner exceed $1 million--welldemonstrates, these officials face both substantial uncertainty because of the ad hoc nature of takings law and unac-ceptable penalties if they guess incorrectly about that law.

6

5 Even measured in terms of efficiency, the Court's rule is unsound. The
Court today effectively establishes a form of insurance against certain
changes in land-use regulations. Like other forms of insurance, the
Court's rule creates a "moral hazard" and inefficiencies: In the face of
uncertainty about changes in the law, developers will overinvest, safe in
the knowledge that if the law changes adversely, they will be entitled to
compensation. See generally Farber, Economic Analysis and Just Compensation, 12 Int'l Rev. of Law & Econ. 125 (1992).

6 As the Court correctly notes, in regulatory takings, unlike physical

takings, courts have a choice of remedies. See ante, at 1030, n. 17. They
may "invalidat[e the] excessive regulation" or they may "allo[w] the regulation to stand and orde[r] the government to afford compensation for the
permanent taking." First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of
Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U. S. 304, 335 (1987) (Stevens, J.,
dissenting); see also id., at 319-321. In either event, however, the costs
to the government are likely to be substantial and are therefore likely to
impede the development of sound land-use policy.

Viewed more broadly, the Court's new rule and exception
conflict with the very character of our takings jurisprudence.
We have frequently and consistently recognized that the
definition of a taking cannot be reduced to a "set formula"
and that determining whether a regulation is a taking is
"essentially [an] ad hoc, factual inquir[y]." Penn Central
Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104, 124
(1978) (quoting Goldblatt v. Hempstead, 369 U. S., at 594).
This is unavoidable, for the determination whether a law effects a taking is ultimately a matter of "fairness and justice,"
Armstrong v. United States, 364 U. S. 40, 49 (1960), and "necessarily requires a weighing of private and public interests,"
Agins, 447 U. S., at 261. The rigid rules fixed by the Court
today clash with this enterprise: "fairness and justice" are
often disserved by categorical rules.

III
It is well established that a takings case "entails inquiry
into [several factors:] the character of the governmental
action, its economic impact, and its interference with reasonable investment-backed expectations." PruneYard, 447
U. S., at 83. The Court's analysis today focuses on the last
two of these three factors: The categorical rule addresses a
regulation's "economic impact," while the nuisance exception
recognizes that ownership brings with it only certain "expectations." Neglected by the Court today is the first and, in
some ways, the most important factor in takings analysis:
the character of the regulatory action.

The Just Compensation Clause "was designed to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by
the public as a whole." Armstrong, 364 U. S., at 49. Accordingly, one of the central concerns of our takings jurisprudence is "prevent[ing] the public from loading upon
one individual more than his just share of the burdens
of government." Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United

Stevens, J., dissenting
States, 148 U. S. 312, 325 (1893). We have, therefore, in ourtakings law frequently looked to the generality of a regulation of property.7For example, in the case of so-called "developmental exactions," we have paid special attention to the risk that partic-ular landowners might "b[e] singled out to bear the burden"
of a broader problem not of his own making. Nollan, 483U. S., at 835, n. 4; see also

Pennell v. San Jose, 485 U. S. 1,23 (1988). Similarly, in distinguishing between the Kohler

Act (at issue in Mahon) and the Subsidence Act (at issue inKeystone), we found significant that the regulatory function
of the latter was substantially broader. Unlike the Kohler

7 This principle of generality is well rooted in our broader understandings of the Constitution as designed in part to control the "mischiefs of
faction." See The Federalist No. 10, p. 43 (G. Wills ed. 1982) (J. Madison).

An analogous concern arises in First Amendment law. There we have
recognized that an individual's rights are not violated when his religious
practices are prohibited under a neutral law of general applicability. For
example, in Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v.
Smith, 494 U. S. 872, 879-880 (1990), we observed:

"[Our] decisions have consistently held that the right of free exercise
does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a `valid and
neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes
(or prescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes).'
United States v. Lee, 455 U. S. 252, 263, n. 3 (1982) (Stevens, J., concurring
in judgment). . . . In Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U. S. 158 (1944), we held
that a mother could be prosecuted under the child labor laws for using
her children to dispense literature in the streets, her religious motivation
notwithstanding. We found no constitutional infirmity in `excluding
[these children] from doing there what no other children may do.' Id., at
171. In Braunfeld v. Brown, 366 U. S. 599 (1961) (plurality opinion), we
upheld Sunday-closing laws against the claim that they burdened the religious practices of persons whose religions compelled them to refrain from
work on other days. In Gillette v. United States, 401 U. S. 437, 461 (1971),
we sustained the military Selective Service System against the claim that
it violated free exercise by conscripting persons who opposed a particular
war on religious grounds."

If such a neutral law of general applicability may severely burden constitutionally protected interests in liberty, a comparable burden on property
owners should not be considered unreasonably onerous.

Act, which simply transferred back to the surface ownerscertain rights that they had earlier sold to the coal companies, the Subsidence Act affected all surface owners--includ-ing the coal companies--equally. See Keystone, 480 U. S.,
at 486. Perhaps the most familiar application of this princi-ple of generality arises in zoning cases. A diminution in
value caused by a zoning regulation is far less likely to con-stitute a taking if it is part of a general and comprehensive
land-use plan, see Euclid v. Amber Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365(1926); conversely, "spot zoning" is far more likely to constitute a taking, see Penn Central, 438 U. S., at 132, and n. 28.The presumption that a permanent physical occupation, no
matter how slight, effects a taking is wholly consistent withthis principle. A physical taking entails a certain amount
of "singling out." 8 Consistent with this principle, physicaloccupations by third parties are more likely to effect takings
than other physical occupations. Thus, a regulation requir-ing the installation of a junction box owned by a third party,
Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S.419 (1982), is more troubling than a regulation requiring the
installation of sprinklers or smoke detectors; just as an ordergranting third parties access to a marina, Kaiser Aetna v.
United States, 444 U. S. 164 (1979), is more troubling than anorder requiring the placement of safety buoys in the marina.

In analyzing takings claims, courts have long recognizedthe difference between a regulation that targets one or two
parcels of land and a regulation that enforces a statewidepolicy. See,

e. g., A. A. Profiles, Inc. v. Ft. Lauderdale, 850F. 2d 1483, 1488 (CA11 1988); Wheeler v. Pleasant Grove, 664

372 S. W. 2d 833, 842-843 (Mo. 1963). As one early courtstated with regard to a waterfront regulation, "If such restraint were in fact imposed upon the estate of one proprie-tor only, out of several estates on the same line of shore, the
objection would be much more formidable." Commonwealth v. Alger, 61 Mass. 53, 102 (1851).In considering Lucas' claim, the generality of the Beachfront Management Act is significant. The Act does not tar-get particular landowners, but rather regulates the use of
the coastline of the entire State. See S. C. Code Ann. $ 48-39-10 (Supp. 1990). Indeed, South Carolina's Act is best understood as part of a national effort to protect the coastline,one initiated by the federal Coastal Zone Management Act
of 1972. Pub. L. 92-583, 86 Stat. 1280, codified as amendedat 16 U. S. C. $ 1451

Moreover, the Act did not single out owners of undevelopedland. The Act also prohibited owners of developed land

from rebuilding if their structures were destroyed, see 1988S. C. Acts 634, $ 3,

repairing erosion control devices, such as seawalls, see S. C.Code Ann. $ 48-39-290(B)(2) (Supp. 1990). In addition, in

some situations, owners of developed land were required to"renouris[h] the beach . . . on a yearly basis with an amount
. . . of sand . . . not . . . less than one and one-half times theyearly volume of sand lost due to erosion." 1988 S. C. Acts

land alike.12 This generality indicates that the Act is not an
effort to expropriate owners of undeveloped land.

Admittedly, the economic impact of this regulation is dramatic and petitioner's investment-backed expectations are
substantial. Yet, if anything, the costs to and expectations
of the owners of developed land are even greater: I doubt,
however, that the cost to owners of developed land of renourishing the beach and allowing their seawalls to deteriorate
effects a taking. The costs imposed on the owners of undeveloped land, such as petitioner, differ from these costs only
in degree, not in kind.

The impact of the ban on developmental uses must also be
viewed in light of the purposes of the Act. The legislature
stated the purposes of the Act as "protect[ing], preserv[ing],
restor[ing] and enhanc[ing] the beach/dune system" of the
State not only for recreational and ecological purposes, but
also to "protec[t] life and property." S. C. Code Ann. $ 48-
39-260(1)(a) (Supp. 1990). The State, with much science on
its side, believes that the "beach/dune system [acts] as a
buffer from high tides, storm surge, [and] hurricanes." Ibid.
This is a traditional and important exercise of the State's
police power, as demonstrated by Hurricane Hugo, which in
1989, caused 29 deaths and more than $6 billion in property
damage in South Carolina alone.13

In view of all of these factors, even assuming that petitioner's property was rendered valueless, the risk inherent in
investments of the sort made by petitioner, the generality of
the Act, and the compelling purpose motivating the South

Carolina Legislature persuade me that the Act did not effecta taking of petitioner's property.

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.
Statement of Justice Souter.
I would dismiss the writ of certiorari in this case as having
been granted improvidently. After briefing and argument
it is abundantly clear that an unreviewable assumption onwhich this case comes to us is both questionable as a conclusion of Fifth Amendment law and sufficient to frustrate theCourt's ability to render certain the legal premises on which
its holding rests.The petition for review was granted on the assumption
that the State by regulation had deprived the owner of hisentire economic interest in the subject property. Such was
the state trial court's conclusion, which the State Supreme
Court did not review. It is apparent now that in light of our
prior cases, see, e. g., Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v.
DeBenedictis, 480 U. S. 470, 493-502 (1987); Andrus v. Allard, 444 U. S. 51, 65-66 (1979); Penn Central Transportation Corp. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104, 130-131 (1978),
the trial court's conclusion is highly questionable. While
the respondent now wishes to contest the point, see Brief for
Respondent 45-50, the Court is certainly right to refuse to
take up the issue, which is not fairly included within the
question presented, and has received only the most superficial and one-sided treatment before us.

Because the questionable conclusion of total deprivation
cannot be reviewed, the Court is precluded from attempting
to clarify the concept of total (and, in the Court's view, categorically compensable) taking on which it rests, a concept
which the Court describes, see ante, at 1016-1017, n. 6, as so
uncertain under existing law as to have fostered inconsistent
pronouncements by the Court itself. Because that concept is
left uncertain, so is the significance of the exceptions to the
compensation requirement that the Court proceeds to recog505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:22 PAGES OPINPGT

Statement of Souter, J.
nize. This alone is enough to show that there is little utilityin attempting to deal with this case on the merits.

The imprudence of proceeding to the merits in spite ofthese unpromising circumstances is underscored by the fact
that, in doing so, the Court cannot help but assume something about the scope of the uncertain concept of total depri-vation, even when it is barred from explicating total deprivation directly. Thus, when the Court concludes that theapplication of nuisance law provides an exception to the general rule that complete denial of economically beneficial useof property amounts to a compensable taking, the Court will
be understood to suggest (if it does not assume) that there
are in fact circumstances in which state-law nuisance abatement may amount to a denial of all beneficial land use as that
concept is to be employed in our takings jurisprudence under
the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The nature of nuisance law, however, indicates that application of a regulation
defensible on grounds of nuisance prevention or abatement
will quite probably not amount to a complete deprivation in
fact. The nuisance enquiry focuses on conduct, not on the
character of the property on which that conduct is performed, see 4 Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 821B (1979)
(public nuisance); id., $ 822 (private nuisance), and the remedies for such conduct usually leave the property owner with
other reasonable uses of his property, see W. Keeton, D.
Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law
of Torts $ 90 (5th ed. 1984) (public nuisances usually remedied by criminal prosecution or abatement), id., $ 89 (private
nuisances usually remedied by damages, injunction, or abatement); see also, e. g., Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623, 668-
669 (1887) (prohibition on use of property to manufacture
intoxicating beverages "does not disturb the owner in the
control or use of his property for lawful purposes, nor restrict his right to dispose of it, but is only a declaration by
the State that its use . . . for certain forbidden purposes, is
prejudicial to the public interests"); Hadacheck v. Sebastian,

Statement of Souter, J.
239 U. S. 394, 412 (1915) (prohibition on operation of brick-yard did not prohibit extraction of clay from which bricks

were produced). Indeed, it is difficult to imagine propertythat can be used only to create a nuisance, such that its sole
economic value must presuppose the right to occupy it forsuch seriously noxious activity.

The upshot is that the issue of what constitutes a totaldeprivation is being addressed by indirection, and with uncertain results, in the Court's treatment of defenses to com-pensation claims. While the issue of what constitutes total
deprivation deserves the Court's attention, as does the rela-tionship between nuisance abatement and such total deprivation, the Court should confront these matters directly. Be-cause it can neither do so in this case, nor skip over those
preliminary issues and deal independently with defenses tothe Court's categorical compensation rule, the Court should
dismiss the instant writ and await an opportunity to face thetotal deprivation question squarely. Under these circumstances, I believe it proper for me to vote to dismiss the writ,despite the Court's contrary preference. See,

e. g., Welsh v.Wisconsin, 466 U. S. 740, 755 (1984) (Burger, C. J.); United

States v. Shannon, 342 U. S. 288, 294 (1952) (Frankfurter, J.).

1079OCTOBER TERM, 1991
Syllabus

ESPINOSA v. FLORIDA
on petition for writ of certiorari to thesupreme court of florida

No. 91-7390. Decided June 29, 1992
During the penalty phase of a capital murder trial in Florida, a jury is

asked to recommend whether a defendant should be sentenced to death
or life imprisonment in a verdict that does not include specific findings of
aggravating and mitigating circumstances. The court itself must then
weigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances to determine what
the sentence will be, and it must issue a written statement of the circumstances found and weighed if the sentence is death. In petitioner Espinosa's case, the jury was instructed, inter alia, that it could find as an
aggravating factor that the murder was "especially wicked, evil, atrocious or cruel." It recommended that the trial court impose death, and
finding four aggravating and two mitigating factors, the court did so.
On appeal, the State Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting Espinosa's argument that the instruction in question was vague and left the jury
with insufficient guidance when to find the existence of the aggravating factor.

Held: If a weighing State requires a trial court to pay deference to a jury's

sentencing recommendation in determining the appropriate sentence,
the jury's consideration of an invalid aggravating circumstance unconstitutionally infects the court's sentencing determination. Instructions
more specific and elaborate than the one given in the instant case have
been found unconstitutionally vague, and the weighing of an invalid aggravating circumstance violates the Eighth Amendment. The State incorrectly argues that there was no need to instruct the jury with the
specificity required by this Court's cases because Florida juries are not
the sentencers. While a trial court in Florida is not bound by a jury's
recommendation, it is required to give "great weight" to it. It must be
presumed that the jury in this case weighed the invalid instruction in
making its recommendation and that the trial court followed state law
and gave deference to that recommendation. Thus, the trial court indirectly weighed the invalid aggravating factor itself, creating the same
potential for arbitrariness as the direct weighing of such a factor.

Certiorari granted; 589 So. 2d 887, reversed and remanded.

1080 ESPINOSA v. FLORIDA

Per Curiam
Per Curiam.
Under Florida law, after a defendant is found guilty of acapital felony, a separate sentencing proceeding is conducted

to determine whether the sentence should be life imprison-ment or death. Fla. Stat. $ 921.141(1) (1991). At the close
of a hearing at which the prosecution and the defense maypresent evidence and argument in favor of and against the
death penalty, ibid., the trial judge charges the jurors to con-sider "[w]hether sufficient aggravating circumstances exist,"
"[w]hether sufficient mitigating circumstances exist whichoutweigh the aggravating circumstances," and "[b]ased on
these considerations, whether the defendant should be sen-tenced to life imprisonment or death." $ 921.141(2). The
verdict does not include specific findings of aggravating andmitigating circumstances, but states only the jury's sentencing recommendation. "Notwithstanding the recommenda-tion of a majority of the jury," the trial court itself must then
"weig[h] the aggravating and mitigating circumstances" todetermine finally whether the sentence will be life or death.

$ 921.141(3). If the trial court fixes punishment at death, thecourt must issue a written statement of the circumstances
found and weighed. Ibid.A Florida jury found petitioner Henry Jose Espinosa
guilty of first-degree murder. At the close of the evidencein the penalty hearing, the trial court instructed the jury on
aggravating factors. One of the instructions informed thejury that it was entitled to find as an aggravating factor that
the murder of which it had found Espinosa guilty was "espe-cially wicked, evil, atrocious or cruel." See $ 921.141(h).
The jury recommended that the trial court impose death, and
the court, finding four aggravating and two mitigating fac-tors, did so. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Florida,

petitioner argued that the "wicked, evil, atrocious or cruel"instruction was vague and therefore left the jury with insufficient guidance when to find the existence of the aggravatingfactor. The court rejected this argument and affirmed, say505us3119Z 06-17-96 23:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT

ing: "We reject Espinosa's complaint with respect to the textof the jury instruction on the heinous, atrocious, or cruel

aggravating factor upon the rationale of Smalley v. State,546 So. 2d 720 (Fla. 1989)." 589 So. 2d 887, 894 (1991).

Our cases establish that, in a State where the sentencer
weighs aggravating and mitigating circumstances, theweighing of an invalid aggravating circumstance violates the

Eighth Amendment. See Sochor v. Florida, 504 U. S. 527,532 (1992);

Stringer v. Black, 503 U. S. 222, 232 (1992); Parker v. Dugger, 498 U. S. 308, 319-321 (1991); Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738, 752 (1990). Our cases further establish that an aggravating circumstance is invalid in this sense
if its description is so vague as to leave the sentencer without sufficient guidance for determining the presence or absence of the factor. See Stringer, supra, at 235. We have
held instructions more specific and elaborate than the one
given in the instant case unconstitutionally vague. See
Shell v. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 1 (1990); Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356 (1988); Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S.
420 (1980).

The State here does not argue that the "especially wicked,
evil, atrocious or cruel" instruction given in this case was
any less vague than the instructions we found lacking in
Shell, Cartwright, or Godfrey. Instead, echoing the State
Supreme Court's reasoning in Smalley v. State, 546 So. 2d,
at 722, the State argues that there was no need to instruct
the jury with the specificity our cases have required where
the jury was the final sentencing authority, because, in the
Florida scheme, the jury is not "the sentencer" for Eighth
Amendment purposes. This is true, the State argues, because the trial court is not bound by the jury's sentencing
recommendation; rather, the court must independently determine which aggravating and mitigating circumstances
exist, and, after weighing the circumstances, enter a sentence "[n]otwithstanding the recommendation of a majority
of the jury," Fla. Stat. $ 921.141(3).

1082 ESPINOSA v. FLORIDA

Per Curiam
Our examination of Florida case law indicates, however,that a Florida trial court is required to pay deference to a

jury's sentencing recommendation, in that the trial courtmust give "great weight" to the jury's recommendation,
whether that recommendation be life, see Tedder v. State,
322 So. 2d 908, 910 (Fla. 1975), or death, see Smith v. State,515 So. 2d 182, 185 (Fla. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U. S. 971

(1988); Grossman v. State, 525 So. 2d 833, 839, n. 1 (Fla. 1988),cert. denied, 489 U. S. 1071 (1989). Thus, Florida has essentially split the weighing process in two. Initially, the juryweighs aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and the
result of that weighing process is then in turn weighed
within the trial court's process of weighing aggravating and
mitigating circumstances.

It is true that, in this case, the trial court did not directly
weigh any invalid aggravating circumstances. But, we must
presume that the jury did so, see Mills v. Maryland, 486
U. S. 367, 376-377 (1988), just as we must further presume
that the trial court followed Florida law, cf. Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 653 (1990), and gave "great weight" to
the resultant recommendation. By giving "great weight" to
the jury recommendation, the trial court indirectly weighed
the invalid aggravating factor that we must presume the
jury found. This kind of indirect weighing of an invalid aggravating factor creates the same potential for arbitrariness
as the direct weighing of an invalid aggravating factor, cf.
Baldwin v. Alabama, 472 U. S. 372, 382 (1985), and the result, therefore, was error.

We have often recognized that there are many constitutionally permissible ways in which States may choose to allocate capital sentencing authority. See id., at 389; Spaziano
v. Florida, 468 U. S. 447, 464 (1984). Today's decision in no
way signals a retreat from that position. We merely hold
that, if a weighing State decides to place capital sentencing
authority in two actors rather than one, neither actor must
be permitted to weigh invalid aggravating circumstances.

For the reasons given in my opinion in Sochor v. Florida,504 U. S. 527, 553 (1992), I dissent from the Court's summary

reversal of Espinosa's death sentence. Since the Floridacourts found several constitutionally sound aggravating factors in this case, Espinosa's death sentence unquestionablycomports with the "narrowing" requirement of

Furman v.Georgia, 408 U. S. 238 (1972). Compliance with that requirement is the only special capital sentencing procedurethat the Eighth Amendment demands. See Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 669-673 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurringin part and concurring in judgment). I would deny the
petition.

No. A-40. Decided July 17, 1992
Respondent federal officials confiscated applicant Benten's supply of RU-

486, a drug not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
at airport customs as she tried to import a single dosage in order to
induce a nonsurgical abortion. The District Court entered a preliminary injunction compelling the drug's immediate return to Benten,
which the Court of Appeals stayed pending an appeal.

Held: The application to vacate the stay is denied. Applicants have failed

to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their
claim that Benten is entitled to the drug's return on the ground that
the administrative document instructing officials to seize the drug was
promulgated without notice-and-comment procedures assertedly required by both the Administrative Procedure Act and FDA regulations.
The Court expresses no opinion on the merits of the claim that holding
the drug would constitute an undue burden upon Benten's constitutionally protected abortion rights, since that claim was addressed neither
by the courts below nor by applicants' filings in this Court.

Application denied.

Stevens, J., dissenting
Petitioners contend that Benten is entitled to the return of
her RU-486 because an administrative document instructing
enforcement officials to seize that drug was promulgated
without notice-and-comment procedures assertedly required
under both the Administrative Procedure Act and FDA regulations. We conclude that petitioners have failed to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of
these claims. Justice Stevens contends that the Government's holding the drug would constitute an undue burden
upon Benten's constitutionally protected abortion rights.
See post this page and 1086. We express no view on the
merits of this assertion. The claim under which Justice
Stevens would grant relief was addressed neither by the
District Court nor by the Court of Appeals nor by petitioners' filings in this Court. Accordingly, we conclude that it
is not properly before us.

Petitioners' application to vacate the Court of Appeals'
July 15, 1992, stay pending respondents' appeal, presented
to Justice Thomas and by him referred to the Court, is
denied.

It is so ordered.

Justice Blackmun dissents and would grant the application to vacate the stay.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
Whether an undue burden has been imposed on the exercise of a constitutional right depends on the relative significance of the burden, on the one hand, and the governmental
interest at stake, on the other.

In this case, applicant Benten's constitutionally protected
interest in liberty has two components--her decision to terminate the pregnancy and her decision concerning the
method of doing so. The Government does not assert any
interest in, or right to, burden the former decision. The
Government does, however, assert an interest in the latter

Stevens, J., dissenting
by protecting Benten from taking medication under the su-pervision of her doctor instead of undergoing an invasive

surgical procedure. In view of the Government's "personaluse exception" policy, expressed in the Federal Drug Administration's February 1, 1989, revision of its Regulatory Proce-dures Manual,* the only legitimate governmental interest
that is now relevant is the interest in avoiding any "signifi-cant health risk" associated with the use of this medication
when prescribed by a competent physician. There is no evi-dence in this record that Benten faces any such risk; indeed,
on the specific facts of this case, the Government's purportedinterest actually supports her position. In all events, I am
persuaded that the relevant legitimate federal interest is notsufficient to justify the burdensome consequence of this
seizure.Accordingly, I would grant the application.

*The Regulatory Procedures Manual provides in pertinent part as
follows:

"In deciding whether to exercise discretion to allow personal shipments of
drugs or devices, FDA personnel should consider a more permissive policy
in the following situations:

"when the intended use is appropriately identified, such use is not for
treatment of a serious condition, and the product is not known to represent
a significant health risk." Ch. 9-71-30(C).

Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice Stevens joins,dissenting.

An applicant for a stay pending the disposition of a petition forcertiorari faces a heavy burden. The applicant must demonstrate
(1) a likelihood of irreparable harm if the judgment below is notstayed; (2) a reasonable probability that certiorari will be granted;
(3) a significant possibility that the judgment below will be re-versed; and (4) that the balance of the equities tilts clearly in
its favor. I do not think the Government has met the lattertwo conditions.

Eight federal judges have now considered the territorial reachof 8 U. S. C. $1253(h). Four have concluded that the statute does
not apply in international waters, and four have concluded that itdoes. Given the thorough and careful reasoning of the majority
and concurring opinions below, I do not see how the Court canconclude at this stage that the Government's likelihood of success
on the merits is any better than even. That is not fatal to theGovernment's application, for if each party's chance of succeeding is equal, a strong showing on the equities can still carry theday for the Government. But no such showing has been made.
While the Government has offered a vague invocation of harm toforeign policy, immigration policy, and the federal treasury, the
plaintiffs in this case face the real and immediate prospect ofpersecution, terror, and possibly even death at the hands of those
to whom they are being forcibly returned. So determined theDistrict Court, to whose findings we should defer where the balance of equities is highly factual in nature. Block v. North SideLumber Co., 473 U. S. 1307 (1985) (Rehnquist, Circuit Justice).

I would deny the application for a stay.

In a statutory construction case that is important enough tomerit reargument, the Court should err on the side of allowing
full discussion of the entire statute at issue. Without having ex-amined the supplemental brief attached to respondents' motion,
and noting the absence of any objection from petitioners, I wouldtherefore allow it to be filed as a matter of course. Because I
intend to read the entire supplemental brief in preparation forthe reargument--despite the Court's peculiar order--I would welcome comment by petitioners on all issues discussed therein.

OPINION OF INDIVIDUAL JUSTICEIN CHAMBERS
REYNOLDS v. INTERNATIONAL AMATEURATHLETIC FEDERATION

et al.

on application for stay
No. A-954. Decided June 20, 1992
The request of applicant Reynolds is granted to stay a Court of Appeals'

order staying a preliminary injunction which barred The Athletic Congress of the U. S. A., Inc., and the International Amateur Athletic Federation from impeding or interfering with Reynolds' ability to compete
in the 1992 United States Olympic Trials. The District Court's opinion
on the issue whether Reynolds has established a probability of success
on the merits is persuasive. With respect to whether the availability
of a damages remedy precludes a finding of irreparable harm, a decent
respect for the incomparable importance of winning an Olympic gold
medal demonstrates that a pecuniary award is not an adequate substitute for the intangible values for which the world's greatest athletes
compete.

Justice Stevens, Circuit Justice.
On June 19, 1992, the United States District Court for theSouthern District of Ohio entered a preliminary injunction

barring The Athletic Congress of the U. S. A., Inc., and theInternational Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) from impeding or interfering with Harry L. Reynolds, Jr.'s, abilityto compete in the 1992 United States Olympic Trials. Later
that day, the United States Court of Appeals for the SixthCircuit issued an order staying the preliminary injunction.
Mr. Reynolds has applied to me in my capacity as a CircuitJustice for a stay of the order of the Court of Appeals.

In my opinion, the IAAF's threatened harm to third par-ties cannot dictate the proper disposition of applicant's claim.
The dispositive questions for me are, first, whether applicant

1301

1302 REYNOLDS v. INTERNATIONAL AMATEUR

ATHLETIC FEDERATION

Opinion in Chambers

has established a probability of success on the merits, andsecond, whether the availability of a damages remedy precludes a finding of irreparable harm. With respect to thefirst, I find the District Court's opinion persuasive. With
respect to the second, a decent respect for the incomparableimportance of winning a gold medal in the Olympic Games
convinces me that a pecuniary award is not an adequate sub-stitute for the intangible values for which the world's greatest athletes compete.Of course, I recognize that this ruling may not establish
applicant's right to compete in the Olympics at Barcelona,but that opportunity will presumably be foreclosed if he is
not allowed to participate in the Olympic Trials. On theother hand, the harm, if any, to the IAAF can be fully cured
by a fair and objective determination of the merits of thecontroversy. Indeed, applicant may fail to qualify, thus
mooting the entire matter; if he does qualify, his eligibilitycan be reviewed before the final event in Barcelona.

The IAAF's threat to enforce its eligibility decision--nomatter how arbitrary or erroneous it may be--by punishing
innocent third parties cannot be permitted to influence a fairand impartial adjudication of the merits of applicant's claims.

The application for a stay is granted.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.
I. Apportionment.

Allocation of overseas federal employees--Equal representation.--
Allocating overseas federal employees to their home States when apportioning congressional representatives among States is consistent with constitutional language and goal of equal representation. Franklin v. Massachusetts, p. 788.

II. Cruel and Unusual Punishment.

Death penalty--Weighing State--Consideration of invalid aggravating
factor.--If a weighing State requires a trial court to pay deference to a
jury's sentencing recommendation in determining appropriate sentence,
jury's consideration of an invalid aggravating circumstance unconstitutionally infects court's sentencing determination. Espinosa v. Florida,
p. 1079.

III. Discrimination Against Foreign Commerce.

Iowa business tax--Dividends from foreign subsidiaries.--Iowa's business tax on corporations--which allows a deduction for dividends received
from domestic, but not foreign, subsidiaries--facially discriminates against
foreign commerce in violation of Foreign Commerce Clause. Kraft Gen.
Foods, Inc. v. Iowa Dept. of Revenue and Finance, p. 71.

IV. Due Process.

Competence to stand trial--Burden of proof.--Due Process Clause permits a State to require that a defendant claiming incompetence to stand
trial--here, for first-degree murder--bear burden of proving such incompetence by a preponderance of evidence; a presumption of competence also
does not violate Clause. Medina v. California, p. 437.

V. Eminent Domain.

Loss of economic value--Beachfront property.--Where South Carolina's Beachfront Management Act in effect barred petitioner from erecting
permanent structures on two residential lots, State Supreme Court erred

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW--Continued.
in applying "harmful or noxious uses" principle to determine whether
Act's dramatic effect on property's economic value accomplished a taking
of private property under Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Lucas v.
South Carolina Coastal Council, p. 1003.

VI. Equal Protection of the Laws.

1. California property tax assessment.--Acquisition-value assessment
scheme used to value real property under Article XIIIA of California Constitution, which was added by Proposition 13, does not violate Equal Protection Clause. Nordlinger v. Hahn, p. 1.

2. Jury selection--Discriminatory use of peremptory challenges by
criminal defendant.--Constitution prohibits a criminal defendant from
engaging in purposeful discrimination on racial grounds in exercising peremptory challenges. Georgia v. McCollum, p. 42.

3. Segregation in public higher education--Standard to determine
compliance--Justification for policies.--In determining whether Mississippi has brought itself into compliance with Equal Protection Clause
in desegregating its higher education system, correct legal standard
is whether State has perpetuated policies and practices traceable to its
prior de jure dual system that continue to have segregative effects and
whether such policies are without sound educational justification and can
be practicably eliminated; using that standard, Mississippi must justify
several policies that may be race neutral on their face but substantially
restrict a person's choice of which institution to enter and contribute
to racial identifiability of eight public universities. United States v. Fordice, p. 717.

VII. Establishment of Religion.

Establishment of religion--Public school prayer--Graduation ceremonies.--Inclusion of clergy to offer prayers as part of an official public
school graduation ceremony is forbidden by Establishment Clause. Lee
v. Weisman, p. 577.

VIII. Freedom of Speech.

1. Airport terminal--Ban on literature distribution.--Court of Appeals' decision that a ban on distribution of literature in respondent Port
Authority's airport terminals is invalid under First Amendment is affirmed. Lee v. International Soc. For Krishna Consciousness, Inc., p. 830.

2. Airport terminal--Ban on solicitation.--Since an airport terminal
operated by a public authority is a nonpublic forum, a ban on solicitation
need only satisfy a reasonableness standard; such a ban imposed by respondent Port Authority was reasonable, and thus its application to peti505ind$$bv 07-16-96 17:00:54 PGT*INDBV (Bound Volume)

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW--Continued.
tioner religious corporation did not deprive petitioner's members of their
First Amendment rights. International Soc. For Krishna Consciousness,
Inc. v. Lee, p. 672.

3. Assembly and parade ordinance--Government official's discretion.--County's assembly and parade ordinance--which permits a government administrator to vary fee for assembling or parading to reflect
estimated cost of maintaining public order--is invalid because it unconstitutionally ties fee amount to speech's content and lacks adequate procedural safeguards. Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, p. 123.

4. Cross burning--Prosecution under city's Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance.--City ordinance--which prohibits display of a symbol that one
knows or has reason to know "arouses anger, alarm or resentment in
others" on basis of, inter alia, race and under which petitioner was
charged for allegedly burning a cross on a black family's lawn--is facially
invalid under First Amendment. R. A. V. v. St. Paul, p. 377.

IX. Right to Abortion.

Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982.--Court of Appeals' decision striking down Act's husband notification provision but otherwise
upholding Act is affirmed in part and reversed in part. Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, p. 833.

X. Right to Speedy Trial.

Federal drug charges--Lag between indictment and arrest.--A delay
of 81/2 years between petitioner's indictment and arrest on federal drug
charges violated his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. Doggett
v. United States, p. 647.

XI. States' Powers.

Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985--Incentives to States.--While Congress has substantial power to encourage
States to provide for radioactive waste disposal, Constitution does not
give Congress ability to compel States to do so; thus, Act's monetary incentives and access incentives provisions are consistent with Constitution's allocation of power between Federal and State Governments, but
take-title provision is not. New York v. United States, p. 144.

XII. Supremacy Clause.

Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965--Pre-emption
of state common-law claims.--Act did not pre-empt state-law damages
action against cigarette manufacturer for death of petitioner's mother,
but superseded only positive enactments by state and federal rulemaking
bodies mandating particular warnings on cigarette labels or in cigarette
advertisements. Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., p. 504.

death penalty so that a court may reach his claim's merits only if he shows
by clear and convincing evidence that but for a constitutional error, no
reasonable juror would have found him eligible for death penalty under
applicable state law; here, petitioner failed to show actual innocence. Sawyer v. Whitley, p. 333.

2. Sufficiency of evidence to support conviction.--Court of Appeals'
decision, on federal habeas, that evidence against respondent was insufficient, as a matter of due process, to support his state-court conviction for
grand larceny, is reversed. Wright v. West, p. 277.
