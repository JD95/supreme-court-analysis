This case, brought under $ 502(a) of the Employee Retire-ment Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 88 Stat. 891, asamended, 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a), concerns ERISA's preemptionand saving clauses. The preemption clause, $ 514(a), 29U. S. C. $ 1144(a), broadly states that ERISA provisions"shall supersede . . . State laws" to the extent that those laws"relate to any employee benefit plan." The saving clause,$ 514(b)(2)(A), 29 U. S. C. $ 1144(b)(2)(A), phrased with similar breadth, exempts from preemption "any law of any Statewhich regulates insurance." The key words "regulates insurance" in $ 514(b)(2)(A), and "relate to" in $ 514(a), onceagain require interpretation, for their meaning is not "plain";sensible construction of ERISA, our decisions indicate, re-quires that we measure these words in context. SeePilotLife Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41, 47 (1987) (noting thatrepeated calls for interpretation are not surprising in viewof "the wide variety of state statutory and decisional lawarguably affected" by ERISA's preemption and savingclauses).The context here is a suit to recover disability benefitsunder an ERISA-gover ned insurance policy issued bydefendant-petitioner UNUM Life Insurance Company ofAmerica (UNUM). Plaintiff-respondent John E. Ward submitted his proof of claim to UNUM outside the time limit setin the policy, and UNUM therefore denied Ward's claim.Ruling in Ward's favor, and reversing the District Court'ssummary judgment for UNUM, the Court of Appeals for theNinth Circuit relied on decisional law in California, the Statein which Ward worked and in which his employer operated.The Ninth Circuit's judgment rested on two grounds. Thatridge; and for the National Employment Lawyers Association by DanielM. Feinberg and Paula A. Brantner.Mary Ellen Signorille and Melvin Radowitz filed a brief for the American Association of Retired Persons as amicus curiae.526US2 Unit: $U47 [12-11-00 18:40:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN364 UNUM LIFE INS. CO. OF AMERICA v. WARDOpinion of the Courtcourt relied first on California's "notice-prejudice" rule,under which an insurer cannot avoid liability although theproof of claim is untimely, unless the insurer shows it wasprejudiced by the delay. The notice-prejudice rule is savedfrom preemption, the Court of Appeals held, because it is"law . . . which regulates insurance." SeeWard v. Manage-ment Analysis Co. Employee Disability Benefit Plan, 135F. 3d 1276, 1280 (1998).The Court of Appeals announced a further ground for reversing the District Court's judgment for UNUM, one thatwould come into play if the insurer proved prejudice due tothe delayed notice. Under California's decisions, the NinthCircuit said, the employer could be deemed an agent of theinsurer in administering group insurance policies. Ward'semployer knew of his disability within the time the policyallowed for proof of claim. The Ninth Circuit held that thegenerally applicable agency law reflected in the Californiacases does not "relate to" employee benefit plans, and there-fore is not preempted. Seeid., at 1281-1283, 1287-1288.We granted certiorari, 525 U. S. 928 (1998), and now affirmthe Court of Appeals' first disposition, and reverse the sec-ond. California's notice-prejudice rule, we agree, is a "law. . . which regulates insurance," and is therefore saved frompreemption by ERISA. California's agency law, we furtherhold, does "relate to" employee benefit plans, and thereforedoes not occupy ground outside ERISA's preemption clause.IUNUM issued a long-term group disability policy to Man-agement Analysis Company (MAC) as an insured welfarebenefit plan governed by ERISA, effective November 1,1983. The policy provides that proofs of claim must be furnished to UNUM, at the latest, one year and 180 days afterthe onset of disability.Ward was employed by MAC from 1983 until May 1992.Throughout this period, premiums for the disability policy526US2 Unit: $U47 [12-11-00 18:40:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN365Cite as: 526 U. S. 358 (1999)Opinion of the Courtwere deducted from Ward's paycheck. Under the admittedfacts of the case, Ward became permanently disabled withsevere leg pain on the date of his resignation, May 5, 1992.See 135 F. 3d, at 1280.Ward's condition was diagnosed as diabetic neuropathy inDecember 1992. In late February or early March 1993, hequalified for state disability benefits and thereupon informedMAC of his disability and inquired about continuing healthinsurance benefits. In July 1993, Ward received a determination of eligibility for Social Security disability benefits andforwarded a copy of this determination to MAC's human resources division. See id., at 1279. In April 1994, Ward discovered among his papers a booklet describing the long-termdisability plan and asked MAC whether the plan covered hiscondition. When MAC told him he was covered, Ward completed an application for benefits and forwarded it to MAC.In turn, and after filling in the employer information section,MAC forwarded the application to UNUM. UNUM received proof of Ward's claim on April 11, 1994. See ibid.This notice was late under the terms of the policy, whichrequired submission of proof of claim by November 5, 1993.See id., at 1280. By letter dated April 13, 1994, UNUM advised Ward that his claim was denied as untimely. See id.,at 1279.In September 1994, Ward filed suit against the MAC planunder $ 502 of ERISA, 29 U. S. C. $ 1132, to recover the disability benefits provided by the plan. UNUM appeared asa defendant and answered on behalf of itself and the plan.See 135 F. 3d, at 1279. To the District Court, Ward arguedthat under Elfstrom v. New York Life Ins. Co., 67 Cal. 2d503, 512, 432 P. 2d 731, 737 (1967) (en banc), a California employer that administers an insured group health plan shouldbe deemed to act as the agent of the insurance company.Therefore, Ward asserted, his notice of permanent disabilityto MAC, in February or March 1993, sufficed to supply timelynotice to UNUM. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 30a. The Dis526US2 Unit: $U47 [12-11-00 18:40:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN366 UNUM LIFE INS. CO. OF AMERICA v. WARDOpinion of the Courttrict Court rejected this argument, concluding that theagency rule announced in Elfstrom "relate[s] to" ERISAplans; hence it is preempted under $ 514(a), 29 U. S. C.$ 1144(a). See App. to Pet. for Cert. 30a. The DistrictCourt further held that the Elfstrom rule is not saved frompreemption as a law that "regulates insurance" within thecompass of ERISA's insurance saving clause, $ 514(b)(2)(A),29 U. S. C. $ 1144(b)(2)(A). App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a. Accordingly, the court rendered summary judg ment inUNUM's favor. Seeid., at 33a.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, identifying two grounds on which Ward might prevail. First,following the Ninth Circuit's recent decision inCisneros v.UNUM Life Ins. Co., 134 F. 3d 939 (1998), the appeals courtheld that California's notice-prejudice rule is saved fromERISA preemption as a law that "regulates insurance";under the notice-prejudice rule, Ward's late notice would notpreclude his ERISA claim absent proof that the insurer suffered actual prejudice because of the delay. See 135 F. 3d,at 1280. Second, and contingently, the Ninth Circuit heldthat the Elfstrom rule, under which the employer could bedeemed an agent of the insurer, does not "relate to" employee benefit plans, and therefore is not preempted by rea-son of ERISA. See 135 F. 3d, at 1287 (internal quotationmarks omitted). The court accordingly remanded the caseto the District Court for a determination whether UNUMsuffered actual prejudice on account of the late submissionof Ward's notice of claim; and if so, whether, under the reasoning of Elfstrom, Ward could nevertheless prevail becausehe had timely filed his claim. See 135 F. 3d, at 1289.IICalifornia's notice-prejudice rule prescribes:"[A] defense based on an insured's failure to give timelynotice [of a claim] requires the insurer to prove that itsuffered substantial prejudice. Prejudice is not pre526US2 Unit: $U47 [12-11-00 18:40:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN367Cite as: 526 U. S. 358 (1999)Opinion of the Courtsumed from delayed notice alone. The insurer mustshow actual prejudice, not the mere possibility of prejudice." Shell Oil Co. v. Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co., 12Cal. App. 4th 715, 760-761, 15 Cal. Rptr. 2d 815, 845 (1stDist. 1993) (citations omitted).The parties agree that the notice-prejudice rule falls underERISA's preemption clause, $ 514(a), as a state law that "relate[s] to" an employee benefit plan.1 Their dispute hingeson this question: Does the rule "regulat[e] insurance" andthus escape preempti on under the saving clause,$ 514(b)(2)(A).2Our precedent provides a framework for resolvingwhether a state law "regulates insurance" within the meaning of the saving clause. First, we ask whether, from a"common-sense view of the matter," the contested prescription regulates insurance. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Mas-sachusetts, 471 U. S. 724, 740 (1985); see Pilot Life, 481 U. S.,at 48. Second, we consider three factors employed to deter-mine whether the regulation fits within the "business of insurance" as that phrase is used in the McCarran-FergusonAct, 59 Stat. 33, as amended, 15 U. S. C. $ 1011et seq.: "first,whether the practice has the effect of transferring or spreading a policyholder's risk; second, whether the practice is anintegral part of the policy relationship between the insurerand the insured; and third, whether the practice is limited toentities within the insurance industry."Metropolitan Life,1 Common-law rules developed by decisions of state courts are "Statelaw" under ERISA. See 29 U. S. C. $ 1144(c)(1) ("The term `State law'includes all laws, decisions, rules, regulations, or other State action havingthe effect of law.").2 State laws that purport to regulate insurance by "deem[ing]" a plan tobe an insurance company are outside the saving clause and remain subjectto preemption. See $ 1144(b)(2)(B). Self-insured ERISA plans, therefore, are generally sheltered from state insurance regulation. See Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724, 747 (1985). Becausethis case does not involve a self-insured plan, this limitation on state regulatory authority is not at issue here.526US2 Unit: $U47 [12-11-00 18:40:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN368 UNUM LIFE INS. CO. OF AMERICA v. WARDOpinion of the Court471 U. S., at 743 (emphasis, citations, and internal quotationmarks omitted); see also Pilot Life, 481 U. S., at 48-49.AThe Ninth Circuit concluded that California's notice-prejudice rule "regulates insurance" as a matter of commonsense. See Cisneros, 134 F. 3d, at 945. We do not normallydisturb an appeals court's judgment on an issue so heavilydependent on analysis of state law, see Runyon v. McCrary,427 U. S. 160, 181-182 (1976), and we lack cause to do so here.The California notice-prejudice rule controls the terms of theinsurance relationship by "requiring the insurer to proveprejudice before enforcing proof-of-claim requirements."Cisneros, 134 F. 3d, at 945. As the Ninth Circuit observed,the rule, by its very terms, "is directed specifically at theinsurance industry and is applicable only to insurance con-tracts."Ibid.; see Brief for United States as Amicus Cu-riae 12 ("[O]ur survey of California law reveals no caseswhere the state courts apply the notice-prejudice rule assuch outside the insurance area. Nor is this surprising,given that the rule is stated in terms of prejudice to an `in-surer' resulting from untimeliness of notice."). The rulethus appears to satisfy the common-sense view as a regula-tion that homes in on the insurance industry and does "notjust have an impact on [that] industry." Pilot Life, 481U. S., at 50.UNUM and its amici urge in opposition to the Ninth Cir-cuit's common-sense conclusion that the notice-prejudice ruleis merely an industry-specific application of the general prin-ciple that "disproportionate forfeiture should be avoidedin the enforcement of contracts." See Brief for AmericanCouncil of Life Insurance et al. as Amici Curiae 13; Brieffor Association of California Life and Health Insurance Com-panies as Amicus Curiae 5 ("[N]otice-prejudice is merely abranch of the broad doctrine of harmless error."). Given thetenet from which the notice-prejudice rule springs, UNUM526US2 Unit: $U47 [12-11-00 18:40:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN369Cite as: 526 U. S. 358 (1999)Opinion of the Courtmaintains, the rule resembles the Mississippi law at issue inPilot Life; under that law, punitive damages could be soughtfor "bad faith" in denying claims without any reasonably ar-guable basis for the refusal to pay. See 481 U. S., at 50. Wedetermined in Pilot Life that although Mississippi had "identified its law of bad faith with the insurance industry, theroots of this law are firmly planted in the general principlesof Mississippi tort and contract law." Ibid. "Any breach ofcontract," we observed, "and not merely breach of an insurance contract, may lead to liability for punitive damagesunder [the Mississippi common law of bad faith]."Ibid.Accordingly, we concluded, the Mississippi law did not "regulat[e] insurance" within the meaning of ERISA's savingclause. Ibid.We do not find it fair to bracket California's noticepre judice rule for insurance contracts with Mississippi'sbroad gauged "bad faith" claim for relief. Insurance policieslike UNUM's frame timely notice provisions as conditionsprecedent to be satisfied by the insured before an insurer'scontractual obligation arises. See 1 B. Witkin, Summary ofCalifornia Law, Contracts $ 726, p. 657 (9th ed. 1987); ZurnEngineers v. Eagle Star Ins. Co., 61 Cal. App. 3d 493, 499,132 Cal. Rptr. 206, 210 (2d Dist. 1976). Ordinarily, "failureto comply with conditions precedent . . . prevents an actionby the defaulting party to enforce the contract." 14 Cal.Jur. 3d, Contracts $ 245, p. 542 (3d ed. 1974). A recent California decision, Platt Pacific Inc. v. Andelson, 6 Cal. 4th 307,862 P. 2d 158 (1993) (en banc), is illustrative. In that case,the California Supreme Court adhered to the normal course:It refused to excuse a plaintiff 's failure to comply with acontractual requirement to timely demand arbitration, although there was no allegation that the defendant had beenprejudiced by the plaintiff 's lapse. The plaintiff had forfeited the right to pursue arbitration, the court concluded,for "the condition precedent [of a timely demand] was neither legally excused nor changed by modification of the par526US2 Unit: $U47 [12-11-00 18:40:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN370 UNUM LIFE INS. CO. OF AMERICA v. WARDOpinion of the Courtties' written agreement." Id., at 321, 862 P. 2d, at 167. "Acontrary conclusion," the court stated, "would undermine thelaw of contracts by vesting in one contracting party thepower to unilaterally convert the other contracting party'sconditional obligation into an independent, unconditionalobligation notwithstanding the terms of the agreement."Id., at 314, 862 P. 2d, at 162.It is no doubt true that diverse California decisions bearout the maxim that "law abhors a forfeiture" 3 and that the3 UNUM cites a handful of California cases of this genre. They do notcast doubt on our disposition. In Conservatorship of Rand, 49 Cal. App.4th 835, 57 Cal. Rptr. 2d 119 (4th Dist. 1996), the court found that a countycourt rule governing notice to a conservatee of potential liability for feesand costs did not comply with statutory notice requirements, but excusedthe defective notice because the conservatee had suffered no prejudice.See id., at 838-841, 57 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 121-123. Rand was not a contractcase at all; it concerned the consequences of a court's violation of a statecreated notice provision in the context of a judicial proceeding. Industrial Asphalt Inc. v. Garrett Corp., 180 Cal. App. 3d 1001, 226 Cal. Rptr. 17(2d Dist. 1986), concerned the notice requirements imposed by California'smechanics lien law and turned on principles of statutory rather than contract interpretation. See id., at 1005-1006, 226 Cal. Rptr., at 18-19. InIndustrial Asphalt, moreover, the complaining party had received actualnotice of the claim underlying the lien. Ibid. Neither case suggests thatCalifornia courts are generally unwilling or reluctant to enforce time conditions in private contracts as written.The older decisions on which UNUM relies are no more instructive.The contract at issue in Ballard v. MacCallum, 15 Cal. 2d 439, 101 P. 2d692 (1940) (en banc), contained contradictory clauses, some appearing toprovide for forfeiture in the event of default, others appearing to contemplate an opportunity to cure. See id., at 442, 101 P. 2d, at 694. The courtinvoked a general presumption against forfeitures only to resolve the conflict. See id., at 444, 101 P. 2d, at 695. Finally, in Henck v. Lake HemetWater Co., 9 Cal. 2d 136, 69 P. 2d 849 (1937) (en banc), a water supplierattempted to escape the terms of a long-term delivery contract on theground that the water recipient had not timely made annual payment.The California Supreme Court rejected the supplier's plea, observing that"in a proper case," equity permits a court to excuse a lapse like the recipient's in order to avoid forfeiture. See id., at 141, 142, 69 P. 2d, at 852.The Henck court carefully weighed the competing interests of the parties526US2 Unit: $U47 [12-11-00 18:40:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN371Cite as: 526 U. S. 358 (1999)Opinion of the Courtnotice-prejudice rule is an application of that maxim. Butit is an application of a special order, a rule mandatory forinsurance contracts, not a principle a court may pliably em-ploy when the circumstances so warrant. Tellingly, UNUMhas identified no California authority outside the insurancespecific notice-prejudice context indicating that as a matterof law, failure to abide by a contractual time condition doesnot work a forfeiture absent prejudice. Outside the notice-prejudice context, the burden of justifying a departure froma contract's written terms generally rests with the partyseeking the departure. See,e. g., American Bankers Mortgage Corp. v. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., 75 F. 3d1401, 1413 (CA9 1996);CQL Original Products, Inc. v. National Hockey League Players' Assn., 39 Cal. App. 4th 1347,1357-1358, n. 6, 46 Cal. Rptr. 2d 412, 418, n. 6 (4th Dist. 1995).In short, the notice-prejudice rule is distinctive most notablybecause it is a rule firmly applied to insurance contracts, nota general principle guiding a court's discretion in a rangeof matters.4and relied in part on the water supplier's fault in inducing the late payment. See id., at 144-145, 69 P. 2d, at 853; cf. Restatement (Second) ofContracts $ 229, Comment c, Reporter's Note (1979) (courts are likely toexcuse obligor's failure strictly to adhere to a performance timetablewhere obligee has induced the failure).These decisions support the uncontested propositions that the law disfavors forfeitures and that in case-specific circumstances California courtswill excuse the breach of a time or notice provision in order to avoid aninequitable forfeiture. None of the decisions even remotely suggests thatfailures to comply with contractual notice periods are excused as a matterof law absent prejudice; none, therefore, suggests that the notice-prejudicerule is merely a routine application of a general antiforfeiture principle.4 UNUM features $ 229 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts (1979),and urges that the notice-prejudice rule fits within its compass. Section229 provides that "[t]o the extent that the non-occurrence of a conditionwould cause disproportionate forfeiture, a court may excuse the nonoccurrence of that condition unless its occurrence was a material part ofthe agreed exchange." The notice-prejudice rule, however, is mandatoryrather than permissive; it requires California courts to excuse a failure to526US2 Unit: $U47 [12-11-00 18:40:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN372 UNUM LIFE INS. CO. OF AMERICA v. WARDOpinion of the CourtCalifornia's insistence that insurers show prejudice beforethey may deny coverage because of late notice is groundedin policy concerns specific to the insurance industry. SeeBrief for Council of State Governments et al. as Amici Curiae 10-14. That grounding is key to our decision. An-nouncing the notice-prejudice rule inCampbell v. AllstateIns. Co., 60 Cal. 2d 303, 384 P. 2d 155 (1963) (en banc), theCalifornia Supreme Court emphasized the "public policy ofthis state" in favor of compensating insureds. Id., at 307,384 P. 2d, at 157; see ibid. (weighing the relative burdensof notice-prejudice on insurers and insureds). Subsequentnotice-prejudice rulings have likewise focused on insuranceindustry policy and governance. See,e. g., Hanover Ins. Co.v. Carroll, 241 Cal. App. 2d 558, 570, 50 Cal. Rptr. 704, 712(1st Dist. 1966) (public policy respecting compensation of in-sured injured parties); Northwestern Title Security Co. v.Flack, 6 Cal. App. 3d 134, 143-144, 85 Cal. Rptr. 693, 698 (1stDist. 1970) (extending notice-prejudice rule to "claims-type"policies, rejecting contention that sound public policy re-quired limitation of rule to "occurrence-type" policies);Pa-cific Employers Ins. Co. v. Superior Court, 221 Cal. App. 3d1348, 1359-1360, 270 Cal. Rptr. 779, 784-785 (2d Dist. 1990)(evaluating insurance industry public policy considerations inreaching the opposite conclusion). Decisions of courts inother States similarly indicate that the notice-prejudice ruleaddresses policy concerns specific to insurance. See, e. g.,Cooper v. Government Employees Ins. Co., 51 N. J. 86, 94,237 A. 2d 870, 874 (1968) (failure to adopt notice-prejudicewould "disserve the public interest, for insurance is an in-strument of a social policy that the victims of negligence becompensated"); Great American Ins. Co. v. C. G. Tate Con-struction Co., 303 N. C. 387, 395, 279 S. E. 2d 769, 774 (1981)("The [notice-prejudice] rule we adopt today has the advanprovide timely notice whenever the insurer cannot carry the burden ofshowing actual prejudice, and it allows no argument over the materialityof the time prescription.526US2 Unit: $U47 [12-11-00 18:40:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN373Cite as: 526 U.

W. 2d 845, 851-853 (Tenn. 1998) (surveying the"compelling public policy justifications" that support depart-ing from traditional contract interpretation in favor ofnotice-prejudice).In sum, the Ninth Circuit properly concluded that noticeprejudice is a rule of law governing the insurance relation-ship distinctively. We reject UNUM's contention that therule merely restates a general principle disfavoring forfeit-ures and conclude instead that notice-prejudice, as a matterof common sense, regulates insurance.BWe next consider the criteria used to determine whethera state law regulates the "business of insurance" within themeaning of the McCarran-Ferguson Act. Preliminarily, wereject UNUM's assertion that a state regulation must satisfyall three McCarran-Ferguson factors in order to "regulateinsurance" under ERISA's saving clause. Our precedent ismore supple than UNUM conceives it to be. We have indi-cated that the McCarran-Ferguson factors are "considerations [to be] weighed" in determining whether a state lawregulates insurance, Pilot Life, 481 U. S., at 49, and that"[n]one of these criteria is necessarily determinative in it-self," Union Labor Life Ins. Co. v. Pireno, 458 U. S. 119, 129(1982). In Metropolitan Life, the case in which we firstused the McCarran-Ferguson formulation to assess whethera state law "regulates insurance" for purposes of ERISA'ssaving clause, we called the McCarran-Ferguson factors "relevant"; we did not describe them as "required." See 471U. S., at 743;O'Connor v. UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America,146 F. 3d 959, 963 (CADC 1998) ("That the factors are merely`relevant' suggests that they need not all point in the samedirection, else they would be `required.' "). As the Ninth526US2 Unit: $U47 [12-11-00 18:40:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN374 UNUM LIFE INS. CO. OF AMERICA v. WARDOpinion of the CourtCircuit correctly recognized, Metropolitan Life asked firstwhether the law there in question "fit a common-sense understanding of insurance regulation," Cisneros, 134 F. 3d, at945, and then looked to the McCarran-Ferguson factors aschecking points or "guideposts, not separate essential elements . . . that must each be satisfied" to save the State'slaw, id., at 946.The first McCarran-Ferguson factor asks whether the ruleat issue "has the effect of transferring or spreading a policyholder's risk." Metropolitan Life, 471 U. S., at 743 (internalquotation marks omitted). The Ninth Circuit determinedthat the notice-prejudice rule does not satisfy that criterionbecause it "does not alter the allocation of risk for which theparties initially contracted, namely the risk of lost incomefrom long-term disability." Cisneros, 134 F. 3d, at 946.The United States as amicus curiae, however, suggests thatthe notice-prejudice rule might be found to satisfy theMcCarran-Ferguson "risk-spreading" factor: "Insofar as thenotice-prejudice rule shifts the risk of late notice and staleevidence from the insured to the insurance company in someinstances, it has the effect of raising premiums and spreadingrisk among policyholders." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 14. We need not pursue this point, becausethe remaining McCarran-Ferguson factors, verifying thecommon-sense view, are securely satisfied.Meeting the second factor, the notice-prejudice rule servesas "an integral part of the policy relationship between theinsurer and the insured." Metropolitan Life, 471 U. S., at743. California's rule changes the bargain between insurerand insured; it "effectively creates a mandatory contractterm" that requires the insurer to prove prejudice beforeenforcing a timeliness-of-claim provision. Cisneros, 134F. 3d, at 946. As the Ninth Circuit stated: "The [noticeprejudice] rule dictates the terms of the relationship be526US2 Unit: $U47 [12-11-00 18:40:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN375Cite as: 526 U. S. 358 (1999)Opinion of the Courttween the insurer and the insured, and consequently, is inte-gral to that relationship." Ibid.5The third McCarran-Ferguson factor--which asks whetherthe rule is limited to entities within the insurance industry--is also well met. As earlier explained, see supra, at 368-373, California's notice-prejudice rule focuses on the insurance industry. The rule "does not merely have an impacton the insurance industry; it is aimed at it."FMC Corp. v.Holliday, 498 U. S. 52, 61 (1990).IIIUNUM and its amici assert that even if the notice-prejudice rule is saved under 29 U. S. C. $ 1144(b)(2)(A), it isnonetheless preempted because it conflicts with substantiveprovisions of ERISA in three ways. UNUM first contendsthat the notice-prejudice rule, by altering the notice pro-visions of the insurance contract, conflicts with ERISA'srequirement that plan fiduciaries act "in accordance withthe documents and instruments governing the plan. "$ 1104(a)(1)(D). According to UNUM, $ 1104(a)(1)(D) pre-empts any state law contrary to a written plan term. SeeBrief for Petitioner 32-33; Tr. of Oral Arg. 8.UNUM's "contra plan term" argument overlooks controlling precedent and makes scant sense. We have repeatedlyheld that state laws mandating insurance contract terms aresaved from preemption under $ 1144(b)(2)(A). See Metro-politan Life, 471 U.

S., at 64 ("[I]f a plan is insured, a State may regulate itindirectly through regulation of its insurer and its insurer'sinsurance contracts."). Under UNUM's interpretation of$ 1104(a)(1)(D), however, States would be powerless to alterthe terms of the insurance relationship in ERISA plans; insurers could displace any state regulation simply by insert-ing a contrary term in plan documents. This interpretationwould virtually "rea[d] the saving clause out of ERISA."Metropolitan Life, 471 U. S., at 741.6UNUM next contends that ERISA's civil enforcement provision, $ 502(a), 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a), preempts any action forplan benefits brought under state rules such as noticepre judice. Whatever the merits of UNUM's view of$ 502(a)'s preemptive force,7 the issue is not implicated here.6 We recognize that applying the States' varying insurance regulationscreates disuniformities for "national plans that enter into local markets topurchase insurance." Metropolitan Life, 471 U. S., at 747. As we haveobserved, however, "[s]uch disuniformities . . . are the inevitable result ofthe congressional decision to `save' local insurance regulation." Ibid.7 We discussed this issue in Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41(1987). That case concerned Mississippi common law creating a cause ofaction for bad-faith breach of contract, law not specifically directed to theinsurance industry and therefore not saved from ERISA preemption. Inthat context, the Solicitor General, for the United States as amicus curiae,urged the exclusivity of $ 502(a), ERISA's civil enforcement provision, andobserved that $ 502(a) was modeled on the exclusive remedy provided by$ 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA), 29 U. S. C.$ 185. The Court agreed with the Solicitor General's submission. 481U. S., at 52-56.In the instant case, the Solicitor General, for the United States as amicus curiae, has endeavored to qualify the argument advanced in PilotLife. See Brief 20-25. Noting that "LMRA Section 301 does not containany statutory exception analogous to ERISA's insurance savings provision," the Solicitor General now maintains that the discussion of $ 502(a)in Pilot Life "does not in itself require that a state law that `regulatesinsurance,' and so comes within the terms of the savings clause, is nevertheless preempted if it provides a state-law cause of action or remedy."Brief 25; see also id., at 23 ("[T]he insurance savings clause, on its face,526US2 Unit: $U47 [12-11-00 18:40:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN377Cite as: 526 U.

The notice-prejudice rule supplied the relevant rule of decision for this $ 502(a) suit. Thecase therefore does not raise the question whether $ 502(a)provides the sole launching ground for an ERISA enforce-ment action.Finally, we reject UNUM's suggestion that the notice-prejudice rule conflicts with $ 503 of ERISA, 29 U. S. C.$ 1133, which requires plans to provide notice and the oppor-tunity for review of denied claims, or with Department ofLabor regulations providing that "[a] claim is filed when therequirements of a reasonable claim filing procedure . . . havebeen met," 29 CFR $ 2560.503-1(d) (1998). By allowing alonger period to file than the minimum filing terms mandated by federal law, the notice-prejudice rule complementsrather than contradicts ERISA and the regulations. SeeBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19, n. 9.IVWard successfully maintained in the Ninth Circuit thatMAC had timely notice of his disability and that his noticeto MAC could be found to have served as notice to UNUMon the theory that MAC, as administrator of the group policy, acted as UNUM's agent.

We neednot address the Solicitor General's current argument, for Ward has suedunder $ 502(a)(1)(B) for benefits due, and seeks only the application ofsaved state insurance law as a relevant rule of decision in his $ 502(a)action.526US2 Unit: $U47 [12-11-00 18:40:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN378 UNUM LIFE INS. CO. OF AMERICA v. WARDOpinion of the CourtCalifornia law rendered that policy provision ineffective, theNinth Circuit appeared to conclude, because under the rulestated in Elfstrom v. New York Life Ins. Co., 67 Cal. 2d, at512, 432 P. 2d, at 737, "the employer is the agent of the insurer in performing the duties of administering group insurance policies." Thus, the Ninth Circuit instructed that, onremand, if UNUM was found to have suffered actual prejudice on account of Ward's late notice of claim, the DistrictCourt should then determine whether the claim was timelyunder Elfstrom. 135 F. 3d, at 1289.Ward does not argue in this Court that theElfstrom rule,as comprehended by the Ninth Circuit, is a law that "regulates insurance." See Brief for Respondent 35 (the NinthCircuit applied "general principles of agency law," not a ruledetermining when "employers who administer insured plansare agents of the insurer as a matter of law"). Indeed, it isdifficult to tell from the Court of Appeals opinion preciselywhat rule or principle that court derived from Elfstrom.See Brief for Respondent 35 ("[T]he court below did not actually apply the Elfstrom rule in this case."); 135 F. 3d, at1283, and n. 6 (endorsing the reasoning of Paulson v. WesternLife Ins. Co, 292 Ore. 38, 636 P. 2d 935 (1981), an OregonSupreme Court decision that purported to reconcile Elfstrom with an apparently conflicting body of case law).Whatever the contours of Elfstrom may be, the Ninth Circuit held that the state law emerging from that case does not"relat[e] to" an ERISA plan within the meaning of $ 1144(a),and therefore escapes preemption. See 135 F. 3d, at 1287.In this determination, the Ninth Circuit was mistaken.The Court of Appeals stated, without elaboration, that Elfstrom does not dictate "the manner in which the plan will beadministered," and therefore is consistent with this Court'sERISA preemption precedent.

The Ninth Circuit's statement is not firmlygrounded.As persuasively urged by the United States in its amicuscuriae brief, deeming the policyholder-employer the agent ofthe insurer would have a marked effect on plan administration. It would "forc[e] the employer, as plan administrator,to assume a role, with attendant legal duties and consequences, that it has not undertaken voluntarily"; it wouldaffect "not merely the plan's bookkeeping obligations regarding to whom benefits checks must be sent, but [would] alsoregulat[e] the basic services that a plan may or must provideto its participants and beneficiaries."
