HOLLOWAYOpinion of the Courtfied immunity from a damages suit charging violation of afederal right, must disregard relevant legal authority notpresented to, or considered by, the court of first instance.We hold that appellate review of qualified immunity dispositions is to be conducted in light of all relevant precedents,not simply those cited to, or discovered by, the district court.IIn April 1987, police officers in Idaho learned that CharlesElder was wanted by Florida authorities. They set out toarrest Elder, but did not obtain an Idaho arrest warrant.The officers planned to apprehend Elder at his workplace, ina public area where a warrant is not required. See UnitedStates v. Watson, 423 U. S. 411, 418, n. 6 (1976). Findingthat Elder had already left his jobsite, the officers surrounded the house in which he resided and ordered him tocome out. Elder suffered epileptic seizures during the episode, and an officer instructed him to crawl out of the houseto avoid injury from falling. Elder, instead, walked throughthe doorway, immediately suffered another seizure, and fellon the concrete walk in front of the house. He sustainedserious brain trauma and remains partially paralyzed.IIAlleging that the warrantless arrest violated his FourthAmendment right to be secure against unreasonable seizure,Elder sued the arresting officers for damages under 42U. S. C. $ 1983. The doctrine of qualified immunity shieldspublic officials like respondents from damages actions unlesstheir conduct was unreasonable in light of clearly establishedlaw. The District Court analyzed Elder's case in threesteps. Had the arrest occurred inside the house, that courtrecognized, clear law would come into play: absent exigentcircumstances, an arrest warrant would have been required.See 751 F. Supp. 858, 860 (Idaho 1990) (citing Payton v. NewYork, 445 U. S. 573 (1980)). If the same clear law governed510us2$26Z 06-23-97 19:08:20 PAGES OPINPGT513Cite as: 510 U. S. 510 (1994)Opinion of the CourtElder's arrest as it in fact transpired, the District Court said,then the matter of exigent circumstances would present atriable issue. 751 F. Supp., at 865.1 But, the District Courtconcluded, it was not clear that the warrant requirementapplied when officers surrounded a house and requested anindividual inside to come out and surrender. For thatscenario, the one presented here, the District Court "foundno controlling Idaho or Ninth Circuit case law."Id., at 866.The District Court accordingly granted summary judgmentfor the officers on qualified immunity grounds. See, e. g.,Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982) (officials "areshielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their con-duct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would haveknown").On appeal, the Ninth Circuit noticed precedent in pointmissed in the District Court:United States v. Al-Azzawy,784 F. 2d 890 (CA9 1985), cert. denied, 476 U. S. 1144 (1986).Al-Azzawy, the Court of Appeals observed, involved a sus-pect seized outside his surrounded home. TheAl-Azzawydecision, published over a year before Elder's arrest, "mighthave alerted a reasonable officer to the constitutional impli-cations of putting a suspect under arrest after he had comeoutside his house pursuant to an order to exit." 975 F.2d 1388, 1391-1392 (1991).2 Indeed, Al-Azzawy explicitly"reaffirmed the rule that `it is the location of the arrestedperson, and not the arresting agents, that determineswhether an arrest occurs within a home.' [Al-Azzawy, 7841 According to depositions before the District Court, Elder had accessto guns in the house, a consideration that might support an exigent circumstances plea. On the other hand, the police started to plan for the arrestfive days before it occurred, a factor that might tug against a finding ofexigency.2 Elder's brief in the Court of Appeals did cite Al-Azzawy, albeit withoutelaboration. Brief for Appellant in No. 91-35146 (CA9), p. 9. There wascause for Elder's caution: The ultimate holding of Al-Azzawy was thatexigent circumstances justified the warrantless arrest.

Johnson, 626 F. 2d753, 757 (9th Cir. 1980), aff 'd on other grounds, 457 U. S. 537. . . (1982))." 975 F. 2d, at 1391.Elder could not benefit from the rule reaffirmed in AlAzzawy, the Court of Appeals believed, because that prece-dent had been unearthed too late. For the conclusion thatcases unmentioned in the District Court could not control onappeal, the Court of Appeals relied onDavis v. Scherer, 468U. S. 183 (1984), in particular, on this statement from Davis:"A plaintiff who seeks damages for violation of constitutionalor statutory rights may overcome the defendant official'squalified immunity only by showing that those rights wereclearly established at the time of the conduct at issue."Id.,at 197 (emphasis added).Although typing the qualified immunity inquiry "a `purequestio[n] of law,' " 975 F. 2d, at 1392 (quoting Romero v.Kitsap County, 931 F. 2d 624, 627-628 (CA9 1991)), the Courtof Appeals read Davis to require plaintiffs to put into thedistrict court record, as "legal facts," the cases showing thatthe right asserted was "clearly established." 975 F. 2d, at1394. Just as appellants forfeit facts not presented to thecourt of first instance, the Ninth Circuit reasoned, so, in thepeculiar context of civil rights qualified immunity litigation,a plaintiff may not benefit on appeal from precedent neitherhe nor the district court itself mentioned in the first instance:"[T]he plaintiff 's burden in responding to a request for judgment based on qualified immunity is to identify the universeof statutory or decisional law from which the [district] courtcan determine whether the right allegedly violated wasclearly established." Id., at 1392. We granted certiorari,509 U. S. 921 (1993). IIIThe central purpose of affording public officials qualifiedimmunity from suit is to protect them "from undue interference with their duties and from potentially disabling threatsof liability." Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 806. The510us2$26Z 06-23-97 19:08:20 PAGES OPINPGT515Cite as: 510 U. S. 510 (1994)Opinion of the Courtrule announced by the Ninth Circuit does not aid this objective because its operation is unpredictable in advance of thedistrict court's adjudication. Nor does the rule further theinterests on the other side of the balance: deterring publicofficials' unlawful actions and compensating victims of suchconduct. Instead, it simply releases defendants because ofshortages in counsel's or the court's legal research orbriefing.3In thinking its rule compelled by this Court's instruction,the Ninth Circuit misconstrued Davis v. Scherer. TheCourt held in Davis that an official's clear violation of a stateadministrative regulation does not allow a $ 1983 plaintiff toovercome the official's qualified immunity. Only in this context is the Court's statement comprehensible: "A plaintiffwho seeks damages for violation of constitutional or statutory rights may overcome the defendant official's qualifiedimmunity only by showing that those rights were clearlyestablished . . . ." Davis v. Scherer, 468 U. S., at 197 (emphasis added). Davis, in short, concerned not the authorities acourt may consider in determining qualified immunity, butthis entirely discrete question: Is qualified immunity defeated where a defendant violates any clearly establishedduty, including one under state law, or must the clearly established right be the federal right on which the claim forrelief is based? The Court held the latter. Id., at 193-196,and n. 14; see 984 F. 2d 991, 995 (CA9 1993) (Kozinski, J.,dissenting from denial of reh'g en banc).3 The Ninth Circuit's rule could have a number of untoward effects. Itcould occasion appellate affirmation of incorrect legal results, see 984 F. 2d991, 998-999 (CA9 1993) (Kozinski, J., dissenting from denial of reh'g enbanc), and it could place defense counsel in a trying situation. See ABAModel Rule of Professional Conduct 3.3(a) (1989 ed.) ("A lawyer shall notknowingly: . . . (3) fail to disclose to the tribunal legal authority in thecontrolling jurisdiction known to the lawyer to be directly adverse to theposition of the client and not disclosed by opposing counsel.").510us2$26Z 06-23-97 19:08:20 PAGES OPINPGT516 ELDER v. HOLLOWAYOpinion of the CourtWhether an asserted federal right was clearly establishedat a particular time, so that a public official who allegedlyviolated the right has no qualified immunity from suit, pre-sents a question of law, not one of "legal facts." See Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 528 (1985); Harlow v. Fitzgerald,457 U. S., at 818. That question of law, like the generalityof such questions, must be resolved de novo on appeal. See,e. g., Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 558 (1988). A courtengaging in review of a qualified immunity judgment shouldtherefore use its "full knowledge of its own [and other rele-vant] precedents." See Davis, 468 U. S., at 192, n. 9.We leave it to the Court of Appeals to consider, in lightof all relevant authority, includingAl-Azzawy, whether therespondent officers are entitled to prevail on their qualifiedimmunity defense. We express no opinion on that ultimateissue, nor do we consider whether the officers' alternate pleaof exigent circumstances is tenable.* * *For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for furtherproceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.510us2$27H 06-19-97 23:10:27 PAGES OPINPGT517OCTOBER TERM, 1993SyllabusFOGERTY v. FANTASY, INC.certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuitNo. 92-1750. Argued December 8, 1993--Decided March 1, 1994After petitioner Fogerty's successful defense of a copyright infringementaction filed against him by respondent Fantasy, Inc., the District Courtdenied his motion for attorney's fees pursuant to 17 U. S. C. $ 505, whichprovides in relevant part that in such an action "the court may . . .award a reasonable attorney's fee to the prevailing party as part of thecosts." The Court of Appeals affirmed, declining to abandon its "dual"standard for awarding $ 505 fees--under which prevailing plaintiffs aregenerally awarded attorney's fees as a matter of course, while defendants must show that the original suit was frivolous or brought in badfaith--in favor of the so-called "evenhanded" approach, in which no distinction is made between prevailing plaintiffs and prevailing defendants.Held: Prevailing plaintiffs and prevailing defendants must be treated alikeunder $ 505; attorney's fees are to be awarded to prevailing parties onlyas a matter of the court's discretion. Pp. 522-535.(a) Fantasy's arguments in favor of a dual standard are rejected. Section 505's language gives no hint that successful plaintiffs are to betreated differently than successful defendants. Nor does this Court'sdecision in Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U. S. 412, whichconstrued virtually identical language from Title VII of the Civil RightsAct of 1964, support different treatment. The normal indication thatfee-shifting statutes with similar language should be interpreted alikeis overborne by factors relied upon in Christiansburg and the CivilRights Act which are noticeably absent in the context of the CopyrightAct. The legislative history of $ 505 provides no support for differenttreatment. In addition, the two Acts' goals and objectives are not completely similar. The Civil Rights Act provides incentives for the bringing of meritorious lawsuits by impecunious "private attorney general"plaintiffs who can ill afford to litigate their claims against defendantswith more resources. However, the Copyright Act's primary objectiveis to encourage the production of original literary, artistic, and musicalexpression for the public good; and plaintiffs, as well as defendants, canrun the gamut from corporate behemoths to starving artists. Fantasy'sargument that the dual approach to $ 505 best serves the CopyrightAct's policy of encouraging litigation of meritorious infringement claimsexpresses a one-sided view of the Copyright Act's purposes. Becausecopyright law ultimately serves the purpose of enriching the general510us2$27H 06-19-97 23:10:27 PAGES OPINPGT518 FOGERTY v. FANTASY, INC.Syllabuspublic through access to creative works, it is peculiarly important thatthe law's boundaries be demarcated as clearly as possible. Thus, a defendant seeking to advance meritorious copyright defenses should beencouraged to litigate them to the same extent that plaintiffs are encouraged to litigate meritorious infringement claims. Fantasy also errsin urging that the legislative history supports the dual standard basedon the principle of ratification. Neither the two studies submitted toCongress while it considered revisions to the Act, nor the cases referredto in those studies, support the view that there was a settled construction in favor of the dual standard under the virtually identical provisionin the 1909 Copyright Act. Pp. 522-533.(b) Also rejected is Fogerty's argument that $ 505 enacted the "British Rule," which allows for automatic recovery of attorney's fees byprevailing plaintiffs and defendants, absent exceptional circumstances.The word "may" in $ 505 clearly connotes discretion in awarding suchfees, and an automatic award would pretermit the exercise of that discretion. In addition, since Congress legislates against the strong background of the American Rule--which requires parties to bear their ownattorney's fees unless Congress provides otherwise--it would havesurely drawn more explicit statutory language and legislative commenthad it intended to adopt the British Rule in $ 505. While there is noprecise rule or formula for making fee determinations under $ 505, equitable discretion should be exercised "in light of the considerations [thisCourt] has identified." Hensley v.

S. 517 (1994)Opinion of the CourtChief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.The Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U. S. C. $ 505, provides inrelevant part that in any copyright infringement action "thecourt may . . . award a reasonable attorney's fee to the prevailing party as part of the costs." 1 The question presentedin this case is what standards should inform a court's decision to award attorney's fees to a prevailing defendant in acopyright infringement action--a question that has producedconflicting views in the Courts of Appeals.Petitioner John Fogerty is a successful musician, who, inthe late 1960's, was the lead singer and songwriter of a popular music group known as "Creedence Clearwater Revival." 2In 1970, he wrote a song entitled "Run Through the Jungle"and sold the exclusive publishing rights to predecessors-ininterest of respondent Fantasy, Inc., who later obtained thecopyright by assignment. The music group disbanded in1972 and Fogerty subsequently published under anotherrecording label. In 1985, he published and registered acopyright to a song entitled "The Old Man Down theRoad," which was released on an album distributed byWarner Brothers Records, Inc. Respondent Fantasy, Inc.,1 The section provides in full: "In any civil action under this title, thecourt in its discretion may allow the recovery of full costs by or againstany party other than the United States or an officer thereof. Except asotherwise provided by this title, the court may also award a reasonableattorney's fee to the prevailing party as part of the costs." 17 U. S. C.$ 505.2 Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR), recently inducted into the Rockand Roll Hall of Fame, has been recognized as one of the greatest American rock and roll groups of all time. With Fogerty as its leader, CCRdeveloped a distinctive style of music, dubbed "swamp rock" by the mediadue to its southern country and blues feel.

FANTASY, INC.Opinion of the Courtsued Fogerty, Warner Brothers, and affiliated companies 3 inDistrict Court, alleging that "The Old Man Down the Road"was merely "Run Through the Jungle" with new words.4The copyright infringement claim went to trial and a juryreturned a verdict in favor of Fogerty.After his successful defense of the action, Fogerty movedfor reasonable attorney's fees pursuant to 17 U. S. C. $ 505.The District Court denied the motion, finding that Fantasy'sinfringement suit was not brought frivolously or in bad faithas required by Circuit precedent for an award of attorney'sfees to a successful defendant.5 The Court of Appeals affirmed, 984 F. 2d 1524 (CA9 1993), and declined to abandonthe existing Ninth Circuit standard for awarding attorney'sfees which treats successful plaintiffs and successful defendants differently. Under that standard, commonly termedthe "dual" standard, prevailing plaintiffs are generallyawarded attorney's fees as a matter of course, while prevailing defendants must show that the original suit was frivolous3 Pursuant to an agreement between Fogerty and the Warner defendants, Fogerty indemnified and reimbursed the Warner defendants for theirattorney's fees and costs incurred in defending the copyright infringementaction. Brief for Petitioner 4, n. 3.4 In addition to the copyright infringement claim, Fantasy asserted statelaw and Lanham Act claims. These claims were voluntarily dismissedbefore trial. Petitioner also asserted various counterclaims against Fantasy, which were ultimately dismissed on Fantasy's motion for summaryjudgment. These related claims and counterclaims are not before thisCourt.5 In making its findings, the District Court stated: "Although the factsof this case did not present the textbook scenario of copyright infringement, the Court has held that Fogerty could indeed be held liable forcopyright infringement even where he also wrote the song allegedlyinfringed. . . . Nor does Fantasy's `knowledge of Fogerty's creativity' meanthat this suit was brought in bad faith, where a finding of subconsciouscopying would have supported Fantasy's infringement claim."

S. 517 (1994)Opinion of the Courtor brought in bad faith.6 In contrast, some Courts of Ap-peals follow the so-called "evenhanded" approach in whichno distinction is made between prevailing plaintiffs and pre-vailing defendants.7 The Court of Appeals for the ThirdCircuit, for example, has ruled that "we do not require badfaith, nor do we mandate an allowance of fees as a concomitant of prevailing in every case, but we do favor an even-handed approach."Lieb v. Topstone Industries, Inc., 788F. 2d 151, 156 (1986).We granted certiorari, 509 U. S. 903 (1993), to addressan important area of federal law and to resolve the conflictbetween the Ninth Circuit's "dual" standard for awardingattorney's fees under $ 505, and the so-called "evenhanded"approach exemplified by the Third Circuit.8 We reverse.6 By predicating an award of attorney's fees to prevailing defendants ona showing of bad faith or frivolousness on the part of plaintiffs, the "dual"standard makes it more difficult for prevailing defendants to secureawards of attorney's fees than prevailing plaintiffs. The Ninth Circuithas explained that prevailing plaintiffs, on the other hand, should generally receive such awards absent special circumstances such as "the presence of a complex or novel issue of law that the defendant litigates vigorously and in good faith . . . ." McCulloch v. Albert E. Price, Inc., 823F. 2d 316, 323 (1987). In the instant case, the Court of Appeals explained:"The purpose of [the dual standard] rule is to avoid chilling a copyrightholder's incentive to sue on colorable claims, and thereby to give full effectto the broad protection for copyrights intended by the Copyright Act."984 F. 2d, at 1532.7 At oral argument, counsel for respondent voiced his dissatisfactionwith the terms "dual" and "evenhanded" used to describe the differingrules in the Circuits. Tr. of Oral Arg. 31. Counsel objected to the implication from the terms--that the Ninth Circuit's dual standard was somehow not evenhanded or fair. While this point may be well taken in arhetorical sense, we will continue to use the terms as commonly used bythe lower courts for the sake of convenience.8 In addition to the Ninth Circuit, the Second, Seventh, and District ofColumbia Circuits have adopted a "dual" standard of awarding attorney'sfees whereby a greater burden is placed upon prevailing defendants thanprevailing plaintiffs. See, e. g., Diamond v. Am-Law Publishing Corp.,510us2$27H 06-19-97 23:10:27 PAGES OPINPGT522 FOGERTY v. FANTASY, INC.Opinion of the CourtRespondent advances three arguments in support of thedual standard followed by the Court of Appeals for the NinthCircuit in this case. First, it contends that the language of$ 505, when read in the light of our decisions construing similar fee-shifting language, supports the rule. Second, it as-serts that treating prevailing plaintiffs and defendants differently comports with the "objectives" and "equitableconsiderations" underlying the Copyright Act as a whole.Finally, respondent contends that the legislative history of$ 505 indicates that Congress ratified the dual standardwhich it claims was "uniformly" followed by the lower courtsunder identical language in the 1909 Copyright Act. Weaddress each of these arguments in turn.The statutory language--"the court may also award areasonable attorney's fee to the prevailing party as part ofthe costs"--gives no hint that successful plaintiffs areto be treated differently from successful defendants. Butrespondent contends that our decision in ChristiansburgGarment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U. S. 412 (1978), in which weconstrued virtually identical language, supports a differentiation in treatment between plaintiffs and defendants.Christiansburg construed the language of Title VII of theCivil Rights Act of 1964, which in relevant part providedthat the court, "in its discretion, may allow the prevailingparty . . . a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs . . . ."42 U.

On the other hand, the Fourth and Eleventh Circuits have beenidentified as following an "evenhanded" approach similar to that of theThird Circuit. See, e. g., Sherry Manufacturing Co. v.

This deci-sion was based on what we found to be the important policyobjectives of the Civil Rights statutes, and the intent of Con-gress to achieve such objectives through the use of plaintiffsas " `private attorney[s] general.' " Ibid. In Christiansburg, supra, we determined that the same policy considera-tions were not at work in the case of a prevailing civil rightsdefendant. We noted that a Title VII plaintiff, like a TitleII plaintiff in Piggie Park, is "the chosen instrument of Congress to vindicate `a policy that Congress considered of thehighest priority.' " 434 U. S., at 418. We also relied on theadmittedly sparse legislative history to indicate that differ-ent standards were to be applied to successful plaintiffs thanto successful defendants.Respondent points to our language inFlight Attendantsv. Zipes, 491 U. S. 754, 758, n. 2 (1989), that "fee-shifting statutes' similar language is a `strong indication' that they are tobe interpreted alike." But here we think this normal indication is overborne by the factors relied upon in our Christiansburg opinion that are absent in the case of the Copy-right Act.9 The legislative history of $ 505 provides nosupport for treating prevailing plaintiffs and defendants dif-ferently with respect to the recovery of attorney's fees. Theattorney's fees provision of $ 505 of the 1976 Act was carriedforwardverbatim from the 1909 Act with very little discus-sion.10 The relevant House Report provides simply:"Under section 505 the awarding of costs and attorney'sfees are left to the court's discretion, and the sectionalso makes clear that neither costs nor attorney's fees9 Additionally, we note that Congress, in enacting $ 505 of the 1976 Copyright Act, could not have been aware of the Christiansburg dual standardas Christiansburg was not decided until 1978.10 For the former provision under the Copyright Act of 1909, see 17U.

No. 94-1476, p. 163(1976).11See also S. Rep. No. 94-473, p. 145 (1975) (same). Othercourts and commentators have noted the paucity of legislative history of $ 505. See, e. g., Cohen v. Virginia Electric &Power Co., 617 F. Supp. 619, 621 (ED Va. 1985), aff 'd on othergrounds, 788 F. 2d 247 (CA4 1986). See also Jaszi, 505 AndAll That--The Defendant's Dilemma, 55 Law & Contemp.Prob. 107, 107-108, and nn. 1, 2 (1992).The goals and objectives of the two Acts are likewise notcompletely similar. Oftentimes, in the civil rights context,impecunious "private attorney general" plaintiffs can ill af-ford to litigate their claims against defendants with moreresources. Congress sought to redress this balance in part,and to provide incentives for the bringing of meritoriouslawsuits, by treating successful plaintiffs more favorablythan successful defendants in terms of the award of attorney's fees. The primary objective of the Copyright Act isto encourage the production of original literary, artistic, andmusical expression for the good of the public. See infra, at527. In the copyright context, it has been noted that "[e]ntities which sue for copyright infringement as plaintiffs canrun the gamut from corporate behemoths to starving artists;the same is true of prospective copyright infringement de-fendants."Cohen, supra, at 622-623.11 The 1976 Copyright Act did change, however, the standard for awarding costs to the prevailing party. The 1909 Act provided a mandatoryrule that "full costs shall be allowed." 17 U. S. C. $ 116 (1976 ed.) (emphasis added). The 1976 Act changed the rule from a mandatory one to oneof discretion. As the 1909 Act indicates, Congress clearly knows how touse mandatory language when it so desires. That Congress did notamend the neutral language of the 1909 rule respecting attorney's feeslends further support to the plain language of $ 505--district courts are touse their discretion in awarding attorney's fees and costs to the prevailing party.510us2$27H 06-19-97 23:10:27 PAGES OPINPGT525Cite as: 510 U. S. 517 (1994)Opinion of the CourtWe thus conclude that respondent's argument based on ourfee-shifting decisions under the Civil Rights Act must fail.12Respondent next argues that the policies and objectives of$ 505 and of the Copyright Act in general are best served bythe "dual approach" to the award of attorney's fees.13 Themost common reason advanced in support of the dual approach is that, by awarding attorney's fees to prevailingplaintiffs as a matter of course, it encourages litigation ofmeritorious claims of copyright infringement. See, e. g.,McCulloch v. Albert E. Price, Inc., 823 F. 2d 316, 323 (CA91987) ("Because section 505 is intended in part to encouragethe assertion of colorable copyright claims, to deter infringe-ment, and to make the plaintiff whole, fees are generallyawarded to a prevailing plaintiff ") (citations omitted); Diamond v. Am-Law Publishing Corp., 745 F. 2d 142, 148 (CA212 We note that the federal fee-shifting statutes in the patent and trademark fields, which are more closely related to that of copyright, support aparty-neutral approach. Those statutes contain language similar to thatof $ 505, with the added proviso that fees are only to be awarded in "exceptional cases." 35 U. S. C. $ 285 (patent) ("The court in exceptional casesmay award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party"); 15 U. S. C.$ 1117 (trademark) (same). Consistent with the party-neutral language,courts have generally awarded attorney's fees in an evenhanded mannerbased on the same criteria. For patent, see, e. g., Eltech Systems Corp.v. PPG Industries, Inc., 903 F. 2d 805, 811 (CA Fed. 1990) ("[T]here isand should be no difference in the standards applicable to patentees andinfringers who engage in bad faith litigation"). For trademark, see, e. g.,Motown Productions, Inc. v. Cacomm, Inc., 849 F. 2d 781, 786 (CA2 1988)(exceptional circumstances include cases in which losing party prosecutedor defended action in bad faith); but see Scotch Whisky Assn. v. MajesticDistilling Co., 958 F. 2d 594, 599 (CA4) (finding in the legislative historythat prevailing defendants are to be treated more favorably than prevailing plaintiffs), cert. denied, 506 U. S. 862 (1992).13 Respondent points to four important interests allegedly advanced bythe dual standard: (1) it promotes the vigorous enforcement of the Copyright Act; (2) it distinguishes between the wrongdoers and the blameless;(3) it enhances the predictability and certainty in copyrights by providinga relatively certain benchmark for the award of attorney's fees; and (4) itaffords copyright defendants sufficient incentives to litigate their defenses.510us2$27H 06-19-97 23:10:27 PAGES OPINPGT526 FOGERTY v. FANTASY, INC.Opinion of the Court1984) (same). Indeed, respondent relies heavily on this ar-gument. We think the argument is flawed because it expresses a one-sided view of the purposes of the CopyrightAct. While it is true that one of the goals of the CopyrightAct is to discourage infringement, it is by no means the onlygoal of that Act. In the first place, it is by no means alwaysthe case that the plaintiff in an infringement action is theonly holder of a copyright; often times, defendants hold copyrights too, as exemplified in the case at hand. See Lieb v.Topstone Industries, Inc., 788 F. 2d, at 155 (noting that "inmany cases the defendants are the [copyright] holders").More importantly, the policies served by the CopyrightAct are more complex, more measured, than simply maximizing the number of meritorious suits for copyright infringe-ment. The Constitution grants to Congress the power "Topromote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securingfor limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusiveRight to their respective Writings and Discoveries." U. S.Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 8. We have often recognized the monopoly privileges that Congress has authorized, while "in-tended to motivate the creative activity of authors and inventors by the provision of a special reward," are limited innature and must ultimately serve the public good. SonyCorp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U. S.417, 429 (1984). For example, in Twentieth Century MusicCorp. v. Aiken, 422 U. S. 151, 156 (1975), we discussed thepolicies underlying the 1909 Copyright Act as follows:"The limited scope of the copyright holder's statutorymonopoly . . . reflects a balance of competing claims uponthe public interest: Creative work is to be encouragedand rewarded, but private motivation must ultimatelyserve the cause of promoting broad public availabilityof literature, music, and the other arts. The immediateeffect of our copyright law is to secure a fair return foran `author's' creative labor. But the ultimate aim is, by510us2$27H 06-19-97 23:10:27 PAGES OPINPGT527Cite as: 510 U. S. 517 (1994)Opinion of the Courtthis incentive, to stimulate artistic creativity for thegeneral public good." (Footnotes omitted.)We reiterated this theme in Feist Publications, Inc. v. RuralTelephone Service Co., 499 U. S. 340, 349-350 (1991), wherewe said:"The primary objective of copyright is not to reward thelabor of authors, but `[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.' To this end, copyright assuresauthors the right to their original expression, but encourages others to build freely upon the ideas and infor-mation conveyed by a work." (Citations omitted.)Because copyright law ultimately serves the purpose ofenriching the general public through access to creativeworks, it is peculiarly important that the boundaries of copy-right law be demarcated as clearly as possible. To that end,defendants who seek to advance a variety of meritoriouscopyright defenses should be encouraged to litigate them tothe same extent that plaintiffs are encouraged to litigatemeritorious claims of infringement. In the case before us,the successful defense of "The Old Man Down the Road" in-creased public exposure to a musical work that could, as aresult, lead to further creative pieces. Thus a successful de-fense of a copyright infringement action may further the policies of the Copyright Act every bit as much as a successfulprosecution of an infringement claim by the holder of acopyright.Respondent finally urges that the legislative history supports the dual standard, relying on the principle of ratifica-tion. SeeLorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 580 (1978) ("Con-gress is presumed to be aware of an administrative orjudicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that inter-pretation when it re-enacts a statute without change . . .").Respondent surveys the great number of lower court casesinterpreting the identical provision in the 1909 Act, 17510us2$27H 06-19-97 23:10:27 PAGES OPINPGT528 FOGERTY v. FANTASY, INC.Opinion of the CourtU. S. C. $ 116 (1976 ed.), and asserts that "it was firmly estab-lished" that prevailing defendants should be awarded attorney's fees only where the plaintiff 's claim was frivolous orbrought with a vexatious purpose. Brief for Respondent40-45. Furthermore, respondent claims that Congress wasaware of this construction of former $ 116 because of twocopyright studies submitted to Congress when it was studying revisions to the Act. W. Strauss, Damage Provisions ofthe Copyright Law, Study No. 22 (hereinafter StraussStudy), and R. Brown, Operation of the Damage Provisionsof the Copyright Law: An Exploratory Study, Study No. 23(hereinafter Brown Study), Studies Prepared for Subcommittee on Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights, 86th Cong.,2d Sess. (H. Judiciary Comm. Print 1960).Before turning to the import of the two studies and thecases decided under the 1909 Act, we summarize briefly thefactual background of Lorillard, whence comes the statement upon which respondent relies. There the question waswhether there was a right to jury trial in an action for lostwages under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of1967 (ADEA). In enacting that statute, Congress provided,inter alia, that the provisions of the ADEA were to be "enforced in accordance with the `powers, remedies and procedures' " of specified sections of the Fair Labor Standards Act(FLSA), 81 Stat. 604, 29 U. S. C. $ 626(b). Lorillard, 434U. S., at 580. In the three decided cases which had treatedthe right to jury trial under the FLSA, each court had decided that there was such a right. In enacting the ADEA,"Congress exhibited both a detailed knowledge of the FLSAprovisions and their judicial interpretation and a willingnessto depart from those provisions regarded as undesirable orinappropriate for incorporation." Id., at 581.Here, by contrast, the Strauss and Brown Studies dealonly briefly with the provision for the award of attorney'sfees. In the Strauss Study, the limited discussion beginswith a quote to A. Weil, American Copyright Law 530-531510us2$27H 06-19-97 23:10:27 PAGES OPINPGT529Cite as: 510 U.

It is increasingly recognizedthat the person who forces another to engage counsel tovindicate, or defend, a right should bear the expense ofsuch engagement and not his successful opponent . . . .' "Strauss Study 31.The study then notes that the pending bills contemplate nochange in the attorney's fees provision and concludes withthe simple statement "[t]he cases indicate that this discretionhas been judiciously exercised by the courts."Ibid.14 This14 In a footnote, the Strauss Study lists several cases exemplifying thecourts' use of discretion. None of these cases explicitly require a dualstandard of awarding attorney's fees, but instead offer various reasons forawarding or not awarding attorney's fees to the prevailing party.

At one point, the study notes that "courts donot usually make an allowance at all if an unsuccessful plaintiff 's claim was not `synthetic, capricious or otherwise unreasonable,' or if the losing defendant raised real issues of factor law." Brown Study 85.16Our review of the prior case law itself leads us to concludethat there was no settled "dual standard" interpretation offormer $ 116 about which Congress could have been aware.We note initially that at least one reported case stated noreason in awarding attorney's fees to successful defendants.See, e. g., Marks v. Leo Feist, Inc., 8 F. 2d 460, 461 (CA21925) (noting that the Copyright Act gave courts "absolutediscretion," the court awarded attorney's fees to prevailingdefendant after plaintiff voluntarily dismissed suit). Moreimportantly, while it appears that the majority of lowercourts exercised their discretion in awarding attorney's fees15 To this extent, the Brown Study focuses more on the effect that theprospect of an award of attorney's fees has on decisions to litigate or tosettle cases. Based on its interview sources, the study concluded that thelikelihood of getting a fee award is so problematic that "it is not a factor"that goes into the decision to settle or litigate. Brown Study 85. Thereport also noted that its observations about attorney's fees "are not intended as an exhaustive treatment of the subject" and that "[attorney'sfees'] deterrent effect on ill-founded litigation, whether by plaintiffs ordefendants, is outside the scope of this inquiry."

FANTASY, INC.Opinion of the Courtto prevailing defendants based on a finding of frivolousnessor bad faith, not all courts expressly described the test inthose terms.17 In fact, only one pre-1976 case expresslyendorsed a dual standard. Breffort v. I Had a Ball Co.,271 F. Supp. 623 (SDNY 1967).18 This is hardly the sort ofuniform construction that Congress might have endorsed.17 See, e. g., Shroeder v. William Morrow & Co., 421 F. Supp. 372, 378(ND Ill. 1976) (refusing to award prevailing defendant an attorney's feebecause plaintiff's action was "prosecuted in good faith and with a reasonable likelihood of success"), rev'd on other grounds, 566 F. 2d 3 (CA7 1977);Kinelow Publishing Co. v.

O'Neill, 49 F. 2d, at 618 (awarding fees toprevailing defendant because plaintiff's case was "wholly synthetic").18 That court concluded that "the considerations prompting an award offees to a successful plaintiff must of necessity differ from those determining whether a prevailing defendant is entitled to such an award."Breffort, 271 F. Supp., at 627. As support, the court stated: "The purpose of an award of counsel fees to a plaintiff is to deter copyrightinfringement. . . . In the case of a prevailing defendant, however, prevention of infringement is obviously not a factor; and if an award is to be madeat all, it represents a penalty imposed upon the plaintiff for institution ofa baseless, frivolous, or unreasonable suit, or one instituted in bad faith."Ibid. As we have already explained, supra, at 527, such is too narrow aview of the purposes of the Copyright Act because it fails to adequatelyconsider the important role played by copyright defendants.

S. 517 (1994)Opinion of the CourtIn summary, neither of the two studies presented to Con-gress, nor the cases referred to by the studies, support respondent's view that there was a settled construction infavor of the "dual standard" under $ 116 of the 1909 Copyright Act.We thus reject each of respondent's three arguments insupport of the dual standard. We now turn to petitioner'sargument that $ 505 was intended to adopt the "BritishRule." Petitioner argues that, consistent with the neutrallanguage of $ 505, both prevailing plaintiffs and defendantsshould be awarded attorney's fees as a matter of course, ab-sent exceptional circumstances. For two reasons we rejectthis argument for the British Rule.First, just as the plain language of $ 505 supports petitioner's claim for disapproving the dual standard, it cuts againsthim in arguing for the British Rule. The statute says that"the court may also award a reasonable attorney's fee to theprevailing party as part of the costs." The word "may"clearly connotes discretion. The automatic awarding ofattorney's fees to the prevailing party would pretermit theexercise of that discretion.Second, we are mindful that Congress legislates againstthe strong background of the American Rule. Unlike Britain where counsel fees are regularly awarded to the prevail-ing party, it is the general rule in this country that unlessCongress provides otherwise, parties are to bear their ownattorney's fees.Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. WildernessSociety, 421 U. S. 240, 247-262 (1975) (tracing the origins anddevelopment of the American Rule); Flight Attendants v.Zipes, 491 U. S., at 758. While $ 505 is one situation in whichCohen v. Virginia Electric & Power Co., 617 F. Supp., at 621-622 (tracingthe evolution of the Second Circuit's dual standard rule and concludingthat earlier cases upon which it supposedly rests do not require bad faithor frivolousness--"[the dual standard rule] is the culmination of a long lineof bootstrapping from nothing to something").510us2$27H 06-19-97 23:10:27 PAGES OPINPGT534 FOGERTY v. FANTASY, INC.Opinion of the CourtCongress has modified the American Rule to allow an awardof attorney's fees in the court's discretion, we find it impossible to believe that Congress, without more, intended to adoptthe British Rule. Such a bold departure from traditionalpractice would have surely drawn more explicit statutorylanguage and legislative comment. Cf.Isbrandtsen Co. v.Johnson, 343 U. S. 779, 783 (1952) ("Statutes which invadethe common law . . . are to be read with a presumption favor-ing the retention of long-established and familiar principles,except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident").Not surprisingly, no court has held that $ 505 (or its predecessor statute) adopted the British Rule.Thus we reject both the "dual standard" adopted by several of the Courts of Appeals and petitioner's claim that$ 505 enacted the British Rule for automatic recovery of attorney's fees by the prevailing party. Prevailing plaintiffsand prevailing defendants are to be treated alike, but attor-ney's fees are to be awarded to prevailing parties only as amatter of the court's discretion. "There is no precise ruleor formula for making these determinations," but insteadequitable discretion should be exercised "in light of the considerations we have identified." Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461U. S. 424, 436-437 (1983).19 Because the Court of Appealserroneously held petitioner, the prevailing defendant, to amore stringent standard than that applicable to a prevailing19 Some courts following the evenhanded standard have suggested several nonexclusive factors to guide courts' discretion. For example, theThird Circuit has listed several nonexclusive factors that courts shouldconsider in making awards of attorney's fees to any prevailing party.These factors include "frivolousness, motivation, objective unreasonableness (both in the factual and in the legal components of the case) and theneed in particular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence." Lieb v. Topstone Industries, Inc., 788 F. 2d 151,156 (1986). We agree that such factors may be used to guide courts'discretion, so long as such factors are faithful to the purposes of the Copyright Act and are applied to prevailing plaintiffs and defendants in anevenhanded manner.510us2$27H 06-19-97 23:10:27 PAGES OPINPGT535Cite as: 510 U.
