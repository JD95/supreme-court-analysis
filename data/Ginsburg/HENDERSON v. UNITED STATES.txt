This case concerns the period allowed for service of proc-ess in a civil action commenced by a seaman injured aboarda vessel owned by the United States. Recovery in suchcases is governed by the Suits in Admiralty Act, 46 U. S. C.App. $ 741 et seq., which broadly waives the Government'ssovereign immunity. See $ 742 (money judgments); $ 743(costs and interest). Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of CivilProcedure allows 120 days to effect service of the summonsand timely filed complaint, a period extendable by the court.The Suits in Admiralty Act, however, instructs that serviceshall be made "forthwith." $ 742. The question presentedis whether the Act's "forthwith" instruction for service ofprocess has been superseded by the Federal Rule.In the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 2071et seq., Con-gress ordered that, in matters of "practice and procedure,"$ 2072(a), the Federal Rules shall govern, and "[a]ll laws inconflict with such rules shall be of no further force or effect,"$ 2072(b). We hold that, in actions arising under federal law,commenced in compliance with the governing statute of limitations, the manner and timing of serving process are gener-ally nonjurisdictional matters of "procedure" controlled bythe Federal Rules. IOn August 27, 1991, petitioner Lloyd Henderson, a mer-chant mariner, was injured while working aboard a vesselowned and operated by the United States. On April 8, 1993,after exhausting administrative remedies, Henderson filed aseaman's personal injury action against the United States,pursuant to the Suits in Admiralty Act, 41 Stat. 525, asamended, 46 U. S. C. App. $ 741 et seq.1 Under that Act,1 Henderson's complaint also invoked the Public Vessels Act, 43 Stat.1112, as amended, 46 U. S. C. App. $ 781 et seq. The Government maintains, however, that Henderson's suit falls under the exclusive governanceof the Suits in Admiralty Act, because his claim arose from employmentaboard a Maritime Administration vessel.

S. 654 (1996)Opinion of the Courtsuits of the kind Henderson commenced "may be brought . . .within two years after the cause of action arises." $ 745.Henderson brought his action well within that time period.He commenced suit, as Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 3instructs, simply "by filing a complaint with the court." 2Having timely filed his complaint, Henderson attempted tofollow the Federal Rules on service. It is undisputed thatthe following Rules, and nothing in the Suits in AdmiraltyAct, furnished the immediately relevant instructions. Fed-eral Rule of Civil Procedure 4(a) (1988) provided: "Upon thefiling of the complaint the clerk shall forthwith issue a sum-mons and deliver the summons to the plaintiff or the plaintiff 's attorney, who shall be responsible for prompt serv-ice of the summons and a copy of the complaint." Rule4(b) provided: "The summons shall be signed by the clerk,[and] be under the seal of the court." Rule 4(d) stated: "Thesummons and complaint shall be served together." 3A series of slips occurred in obtaining the summonsrequired by Rule 4. Henderson's counsel requested the ap-propriate summons forms and file-stamped copies of thecomplaint on April 8, 1993, the day he filed Henderson'sn. 9 (citing 57 Stat. 45, as amended, 50 U. S. C. App. $ 1291(a) (1988 ed.)).Henderson apparently does not contest this assertion. In any case, claimsunder both Acts proceed the same way. See 46 U. S. C. App. $ 782 (suitsunder the Public Vessels Act "shall be subject to and proceed in accordance with the provisions" of the Suits in Admiralty Act).2 In a suit on a right created by federal law, filing a complaint suffices tosatisfy the statute of limitations. See West v. Conrail, 481 U. S. 35, 39(1987). In a federal-court suit on a state-created right, however, a plaintiff must serve process before the statute of limitations has run, if statelaw so requires for a similar state-court suit. See Walker v. Armco SteelCorp., 446 U. S. 740, 752-753 (1980) (reaffirming Ragan v. MerchantsTransfer & Warehouse Co., 337 U. S. 530 (1949)). But cf. Hanna v.Plumer, 380 U. S. 460 (1965) (method of service, as distinguished from timeperiod for commencement of civil action, is governed by Federal Rules inall actions, including suits based on state-created rights).3 The substance of these provisions is retained in current Rules 4(a), (b),and (c)(1).517us2$54P 02-05-99 11:39:02 PAGES OPINPGT658 HENDERSON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtcomplaint. But the court clerk did not respond immediately.Counsel eventually obtained the forms on April 21, 1993, andcompleted and returned them to the clerk. On May 4, coun-sel received the summons mailed to him from the clerk's office, and on May 19, counsel sent the summons and complaint,by certified mail, to the Attorney General,4 who receivedthem on May 25.Service on the local United States Attorney took longer.On May 25, Henderson's counsel forwarded the summons andcomplaint, as received from the clerk, to a "constable" witha request to effect service. On June 1, the constable's officereturned the documents, informing Henderson's counsel thatthe summons was not in proper form, because it lacked thecourt's seal. Counsel thereupon wrote to the court clerkrequesting new summons forms with the appropriate courtseal. Counsel repeated this request on August 19; ultimately, on August 25, Henderson's counsel received the prop-erly sealed summons.Once again, Henderson's counsel requested the constable'sservice and, on August 30, moved for an extension of time toserve the United States Attorney.5 The court granted themotion, extending the time for service until September 15.The United States Attorney received personal service of thesummons and complaint, in proper form, on September 3,1993.4 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(d)(4), effective at that time, instructed that "a copy of the summons and of the complaint [be sent] byregistered or certified mail to the Attorney General of the United Statesat Washington, District of Columbia." The same instruction currentlyappears in Rule 4(i)(1)(B).5 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(j), then in force, provided for serviceof the summons and complaint within 120 days after the filing of the complaint, a time limit subject to extension for good cause. The substance ofthis provision is retained in current Rule 4(m), which permits a districtcourt to enlarge the time for service "even if there is no good causeshown."

S. 654 (1996)Opinion of the CourtThus, the Attorney General received the complaint 47 daysafter Henderson filed suit, and the United States Attorneywas personally served 148 days after Henderson commencedthe action by filing his complaint with the court. On November 17, 1993, the United States moved to dismiss theaction. The grounds for, and disposition of, that motion ledto Henderson's petition for certiorari.The United States has never maintained that it lacked notice of Henderson's complaint within the 2-year limitationperiod prescribed for Suits in Admiralty Act claims. See 46U. S. C. App. $ 745; Tr. of Oral Arg. 38-39 (counsel for UnitedStates acknowledged that service on Attorney General gaveGovernment actual notice three months before 2-year limita-tion period ended).6 Nor has the Government asserted anyprejudice to the presentation of its defense stemming fromthe delayed service of the summons and complaint. And themanner and timing of service, it appears beyond debate, sat-isfied the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure4 (titled "Summons" and detailing prescriptions on serviceof process).In support of its motion to dismiss, the United Statesrelied exclusively on $ 2 of the Suits in Admiralty Act, 46U. S. C. App. $ 742, which provides in part:"The libelant [plaintiff] shall forthwith serve a copy ofhis libel [complaint] on the United States attorney for[the] district [where suit is brought] and mail a copythereof by registered mail to the Attorney General ofthe United States."This provision has remained unchanged since its enactmentin 1920, 18 years before the Federal Rules of Civil Procedurebecame effective, and 46 years before admiralty cases werebrought within the realm of the Civil Rules. The Government argued that Henderson's failure to serve process6 In any event, the filing of the complaint within the limitation periodrendered the action timely.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court"forthwith," as required by $ 742, deprived the DistrictCourt of subject-matter jurisdiction because $ 742 describesthe conditions of the United States' waiver of sovereignimmunity.The District Court initially denied the Government's mo-tion, but reconsidered the matter based on an interveningFifth Circuit decision, United States v. Holmberg, 19 F. 3d1062, cert. denied, 513 U. S. 986 (1994). The court inHolm-berg, agreeing with the United States, held that the $ 742service "forthwith" requirement "is a condition of the Gov-ernment's waiver of sovereign immunity and, thus, a jurisdictional prerequisite." 19 F. 3d, at 1064. In so ruling, theHolmberg court rejected the argument that service of proc-ess under the Suits in Admiralty Act, as in the generality ofcases arising and timely filed under federal law, is a matterof procedure, now governed by the Federal Rules of CivilProcedure.Bound by Holmberg, the District Court dismissed Henderson's complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, andthe Court of Appeals, adhering toHolmberg, affirmed. 51F. 3d 574 (CA5 1995).7 We granted certiorari to resolve disagreement among lower courts on the question whether Fed-eral Rule 4, which authorizes an extendable 120-day periodfor service of process, supersedes the Suits in Admiralty Actprovision that service on the United States be made"forthwith." 87 The Holmberg court "agree[d] that there has been no uniform definition of forthwith," as that term is used in $ 742, 19 F. 3d, at 1065, and theCourt of Appeals in the instant case took no position on whether serviceon the Attorney General 47 days after commencement of the action couldcount as "forthwith." 51 F. 3d, at 577. The court held, however, that the"forthwith" requirement applies to service on both officers--the UnitedStates Attorney and the Attorney General--and stated that "completingservice in 148 days [through service on the United States Attorney] is notforthwith." Id., at 576.8 Compare, e. g., Libby v. United States, 840 F. 2d 818, 819-821 (CA111988); Kenyon v.

S. 654 (1996)Opinion of the CourtIIThe United States first suggests that Rule 4's extendable120-day time prescription, and the Suits in Admiralty Act'sservice "forthwith" instruction, can and should be read har-moniously. The Rule 4 time limit for service, Rule 4( j) atthe time Henderson's action commenced,9 provided:"( j) Summons: Time Limit for Service. If a serviceof the summons and complaint is not made upon a defendant within 120 days after the filing of the complaintand the party on whose behalf such service was requiredcannot show good cause why such service was not madewithin that period, the action shall be dismissed as tothat defendant . . . ." Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 4( j) (1988).Section 2 of the Suits in Admiralty Act, 46 U. S. C. App. $ 742,prescribes service "forthwith," seesupra, at 659, a word notprecisely defined in the Act or in case law, but indicativeof a time far shorter than 120 days. The apparent conflictdissolves, the Government urges, if one reads Rule 4 as establishing not "an affirmative right to serve [a] complaint"within 120 days, but only an outer boundary for timely service. See Brief for United States 14, 18, 26; Tr. of Oral Arg.28, 30.We reject the Government's view of the time the FederalRules authorize for service. Reading Rule 4 in its historical context, we conclude that the 120-day provision operatesnot as an outer limit subject to reduction, but as an irreducible allowance. Prior to 1983, Rule 4 contained no timelimit for service. Until the changes installed that year,v. United States, 303 F. 2d 683, 685-686 (CA2), cert. dism'd, 371 U. S. 907(1962), with Jones & Laughlin Steel, Inc. v. Mon River Towing, Inc., 772F. 2d 62, 66 (CA3 1985). See also Kenyon, 676 F. 2d, at 1231-1232(Boochever, J., concurring); Battaglia, 303 F. 2d, at 686-687 (Friendly, J.,concurring).9 Currently, Rule 4(m) states the time limit for service. See supra, at658, n. 5.517us2$54P 02-05-99 11:39:02 PAGES OPINPGT662 HENDERSON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtUnited States marshals attended to service. The relevantRule 4 provisions read:"(a) Summons: issuance. Upon the filing of the com-plaint the clerk shall forthwith issue a summons and deliver it for service to the marshal or to any other personauthorized by Rule 4(c) to serve it. . . .. . . . ."(c) By whom served. Service of process shall bemade by a United States marshal, by his deputy, or bysome person specially appointed by the court for thatpurpose . . . ." Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 4(a), (c) (1980).Marshals were expected to effect service expeditiously, andRule 41(b), providing for dismissal "[f]or failure of the plain-tiff to prosecute," could be invoked as a check against unreasonable delay. See 9 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 2370, pp. 374-376 (2d ed. 1995); 2 J.Moore, Moore's Federal Practice || 4.18, p. 436 (2d ed. 1995).Rule 4 changes made operative in 1983 completed a shiftin responsibility for service from the United States marshalsto the plaintiff. See Mullenix, Hope Over Experience: Mandatory Informal Discovery and the Politics of Rulemaking,69 N. C. L. Rev. 795, 845 (1991). With marshals no longeravailable as routine process servers, the Judicial Conferenceconsidered a time control necessary; the Conference proposed, and this Court approved, 120 days from the filing ofthe complaint as the appropriate limit. Congress relaxedthe rule change by authorizing an extension of the 120-dayperiod if the party responsible for service showed "goodcause." See supra, at 661; 128 Cong. Rec. 30931-30932(1982), reprinted in 28 U. S. C. App., p. 647.Most recently, in 1993 amendments to the Rules, courtshave been accorded discretion to enlarge the 120-day period"even if there is no good cause shown." See Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 4, 28 U. S. C. App.,517us2$54P 02-05-99 11:39:02 PAGES OPINPGT663Cite as: 517 U. S. 654 (1996)Opinion of the Courtp. 654.10 And tellingly, the text of Rule 4 sets out, as "[a]specific instance of good cause," ibid., allowance of "a reasonable time" to "cur[e] the failure to serve multiple officers . . .of the United States if the plaintiff has effected service oneither the United States attorney or the Attorney General"within the prescribed 120 days. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 4(i)(3).The Federal Rules thus convey a clear message: Com-plaints are not to be dismissed if served within 120 days, orwithin such additional time as the court may allow. Fur-thermore, the United States acknowledges that, $ 2 of theSuits in Admiralty Act aside, Rule 4's extendable 120-daytime prescription applies to the full range of civil litigation,including cases brought against the United States under theFederal Tort Claims Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 2675, and the TuckerAct, ch. 359, 24 Stat. 505 (1887) (current version 28 U. S. C.$$ 1346, 1491 and other scattered sections of 28 U. S. C.).See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33. We are therefore satisfied that Rule4's regime conflicts irreconcilably with Suits in AdmiraltyAct $ 2's service "forthwith" instruction, and we turn to thedispositive question: Does the Rule supersede the inconsistent statutory direction?IIIThe Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 2071 et seq., author-izes the Supreme Court "to prescribe general rules of practice and procedure . . . for cases in the United States districtcourts . . . and courts of appeals," $ 2072(a), and directs:10 Rule 4(m), captioned "Time Limit for Service," currently provides:"If service of the summons and complaint is not made upon a defendantwithin 120 days after the filing of the complaint, the court, upon motionor on its own initiative after notice to the plaintiff, shall dismiss the actionwithout prejudice as to that defendant or direct that service be effectedwithin a specified time; provided that if the plaintiff shows good cause forthe failure, the court shall extend the time for service for an appropriateperiod. . . ."

All laws in conflict with such rulesshall be of no further force or effect after such ruleshave taken effect." $ 2072(b).Correspondingly, and in confirmation of the understandingand practice under the former Federal Equity Rules, FederalRule of Civil Procedure 82 provides: "[The Federal Rules ofCivil Procedure] shall not be construed to extend or limit thejurisdiction of the United States district courts or the venueof actions therein." See 1937 Advisory Committee's Noteson Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 82, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 821 (Rule 82confirms that the Rules' broad allowance of claim joinder"does not extend federal jurisdiction."); see also 12 Wright &Miller,supra, $ 3141, at 210-214.According to the United States, Rule 4 cannot supersede$ 2 of the Suits in Admiralty Act, 46 U. S. C. App. $ 742, forthe latter is "jurisdictional" and affects "substantive rights"by setting the terms on which the United States waives itssovereign immunity. Henderson, in contrast, characterizesthe Suits in Admiralty Act's service "forthwith" instructionas a nonjurisdictional processing rule. Service "forthwith,"he urges, forms no part of the immunity waiver or $ 745'sstatute of limitations, but is simply a direction for the conduct of litigation once the case is timely launched in court--a characteristically "how to" direction in conflict with, andtherefore superseded by, Rule 4.Before examining the text of $ 742 to determine the character of the service "forthwith" provision, we note that theconflict with Rule 4 is of relatively recent vintage. TheSuits in Admiralty Act, which allows in personam suitsagainst the United States for maritime torts, was enactedin 1920, 18 years before the advent of the Federal Rules.Furthermore, admiralty cases were processed, from 1845until 1966, under discrete Admiralty Rules. Even after1966, the year admiralty cases were brought under the governance of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 4 and517us2$54P 02-05-99 11:39:02 PAGES OPINPGT665Cite as: 517 U. S. 654 (1996)Opinion of the Courtthe Suits in Admiralty Act service "forthwith" provisioncould coexist. Rule 4, as just recounted, originally contained no time prescription, only the direction that, "[u]ponthe filing of the complaint the clerk shall forthwith issuea summons and deliver it for service," generally to aUnited States marshal. Seesupra, at 662. It was only in1983, when plaintiffs were made responsible for service without the aid of the marshal, that the 120-day provision cameinto force, a provision that rendered Rule 4's time frameirreconcilable with $ 742's service "forthwith" instruction.Section 2 of the Suits in Admiralty Act, 46 U. S. C. App.$ 742, captioned "Libel in personam," contains a broad waiverof sovereign immunity in its first sentence:"In cases where if [a vessel owned or operated by theUnited States] were privately owned or operated . . . aproceeding in admiralty could be maintained, any appro-priate nonjury proceeding in personam may be broughtagainst the United States . . . ."Section 3 of the Act, 46 U. S. C. App. $ 743, although cap-tioned "Procedure in cases of libel in personam," completesthe immunity waiver by providing for costs and interest onmoney judgments against the United States.11 See UnitedStates v. Bodcaw Co., 440 U. S. 202, 203-204, n. 3 (1979); Fed.Rule Civ. Proc. 54(d)(1) (absent an authorizing statute,United States is not liable for costs); Library of Congress v.Shaw, 478 U. S. 310, 314 (1986) (absent an authorizing stat-ute, United States is not liable for interest).The United States asserts that not just the first sentenceof $ 742, but that section in its entirety is "jurisdictional,"spelling out the terms and conditions of the Government's11 Specifically, the second sentence of $ 743 reads:"A decree against the United States . . . may include costs of suit, andwhen the decree is for a money judgment, interest at the rate of 4 percentum per annum until satisfied, or at any higher rate which shall bestipulated in any contract upon which such decree shall be based."517us2$54P 02-05-99 11:39:02 PAGES OPINPGT666 HENDERSON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtwaiver of sovereign immunity, in contrast to the next sectionof the Suits in Admiralty Act, 46 U. S. C. App. $ 743, whichgoverns "procedure," specifying in its first sentence: "Suchsuits shall proceed and shall be heard and determined according to the principles of law and to the rules of practiceobtaining in like cases between private parties." See Brieffor United States 26-27; see also Holmberg, 19 F. 3d, at 1064;Libby v. United States, 840 F. 2d 818, 820 (CA11 1988) ("Thefact that the waiver of sovereign immunity is declared insection 742, while the procedures governing admiralty suitsagainst the United States are specified in section 743, indicates that the requirements contained in section 742 aremore than procedural."). The dissent adopts this argumenthook, line, and sinker. See post, at 674-675 (finding key totext and structure of the Suits in Admiralty Act in Congress'placement of service requirement in $ 2 (46 U. S. C. App.$ 742) rather than $ 3 (46 U. S. C. App. $ 743)). But just as$ 743 is not "purely procedural," for it waives the Sovereign'simmunity as to costs and interest, so $ 742 is not pervasively "jurisdictional."The sentence immediately following $ 742's broad waiver,and immediately preceding the sentence on service, reads:"Such suits shall be brought in the district court of theUnited States for the district in which the parties sosuing, or any of them, reside or have their principalplace of business in the United States, or in which thevessel . . . charged with liability is found."This notably generous-to-plaintiffs provision will be rec-ognized instantly as one describing venue choices, notsubject-matter jurisdiction. Cf. 28 U. S. C. $ 1391 ("Venuegenerally").Section 742's final sentence provides:"Upon application of either party the cause may, inthe discretion of the court, be transferred to any otherdistrict court of the United States."517us2$54P 02-05-99 11:39:02 PAGES OPINPGT667Cite as: 517 U. S. 654 (1996)Opinion of the CourtCf. 28 U. S. C. $ 1404 (change of venue to more convenientforum); $ 1406 (authorizing transfer, rather than dismissal,when venue is improperly laid). Congress simultaneouslyadded to the Suits in Admiralty Act, the Public Vessels Act,and the Federal Tort Claims Act the transfer provision justset out so that "jurisdictional" dismissals could be avoidedwhen plaintiffs commenced suit under the wrong statute.See S. Rep. No. 1894, 86th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 2-5 (1960); cf.28 U. S. C. $ 1631 (authorizing transfer, inter alia, when re-view of agency action is sought in the wrong federal court).In short, far from reining in "jurisdiction," $ 742's venue andtransfer provisions afford plaintiffs multiple forum choicesand spare plaintiffs from dismissal for suing in the wrongplace or under the wrong Act.12Section 742's critical sentence on service reads:"The libelant [plaintiff] shall forthwith serve a copy ofhis libel [complaint] on the United States attorney forsuch district and mail a copy thereof by registered mailto the Attorney General . . . ."Rule 4, as observed at oral argument, see Tr. of Oral Arg.27-28, provides for dispatch of the summons and complaintto the Attorney General "by registered or certified mail."See supra, at 658, and n. 4. The Government's sovereignimmunity waiver, counsel for the United States agreed, didnot depend on registered mail service, the sole form of mailing $ 742 authorizes; "in this day and age," counsel said, "cer-tified mail would be acceptable." Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-29.But see post, at 678, n. 4 ("jurisdiction in [a Suits in Admi-ralty Act] suit may turn upon the plaintiff 's use of registeredmail"). It thus appears that several of $ 742's provisions arenot sensibly typed "substantive" or "jurisdictional." Instead, they have a distinctly facilitative, "procedural" cast.12 While striving for fidelity to what Congress wrote, see post, at 674,679, the dissent inexplicably writes off many of $ 742's words as "largelybeside the point," post, at 674.517us2$54P 02-05-99 11:39:02 PAGES OPINPGT668 HENDERSON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtThey deal with case processing, not substantive rights orconsent to suit.13If the service "forthwith" prescription is not made "sub-stantive" or "jurisdictional" by its inclusion--along withbroad venue choices--in $ 742, is it a rule of procedure super-seded by Rule 4? Before we address that dispositive question, we note a preliminary issue. Rule 4( j), which con-tained the 120-day prescription at the time Henderson filedsuit, was not simply prescribed by this Court pursuant tothe Rules Enabling Act. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2074 (rules transmitted by Court to Congress "not later than May 1" becomeeffective "no earlier than December 1" of the same year unless Congress otherwise provides). Instead, the Rule wasenacted into law by Congress as part of the Federal Rulesof Civil Procedure Amendments Act of 1982, $ 2, 96 Stat.2527. See supra, at 662. As the United States acknowledges, however, a Rule made law by Congress supersedesconflicting laws no less than a Rule this Court prescribes.See Brief for United States 16, n. 14 ("We agree with peti-tioner . . . that Section 2072(b) provides the best evidence of13 Even before admiralty proceedings were placed under the governanceof the Federal Rules, Judge Henry Friendly trenchantly observed:"I cannot believe Congress meant [to render `jurisdictional' every failureby a libelant to comply with a procedural step outlined in the Suits inAdmiralty Act]; I should have supposed that, once Congress gave the basicconsent to sue the United States, as it did in the first sentence of [$ 742],it was content to have the courts decide the effect of various procedurallapses in the same manner as `if such vessel were privately owned oroperated.' " Battaglia v. United States, 303 F. 2d, at 686 (concurringopinion).Circuit precedent was otherwise, however, and therefore JudgeFriendly reluctantly concurred in the "Draconian conclusion" that a 4-month delay in mailing the pleadings to the Attorney General called fordismissal of the case, despite "forthwith" service on the United StatesAttorney. Cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 4(i)(3) ("court shall allow a reasonabletime" to "cur[e] the failure to serve multiple officers . . . of the UnitedStates if the plaintiff has effected service on either the United Statesattorney or the Attorney General").517us2$54P 02-05-99 11:39:02 PAGES OPINPGT669Cite as: 517 U. S. 654 (1996)Opinion of the Courtcongressional intent regarding the proper construction ofRule 4( j) and its interaction with other laws.").Returning to the dispositive question, we need not lingerover the answer. What we have so far said, and the furtherelaboration below, lead securely to this response: Rule 4 gov-erns summons and service in this case in whole and not inpart.A plaintiff like Henderson, on commencement of an actionunder the Suits in Admiralty Act, must immediately resortto Rule 4 for instructions on service of process. Seesupra,at 657, and nn. 3, 4. In that Rule, one finds instructions governing, inter alia, form and issuance of the summons, serviceof the summons together with the complaint, who may serveprocess, and proof of service.14 The Rule also describes howservice shall or may be effected on various categories of defendants,15 including, in detail, "the United States, and ItsAgencies, Corporations, or Officers."16 All these prescriptions, it is uncontested, apply in Suits in Admiralty Act cases,just as they apply in other federal cases. We see no reasonwhy the prescription governing time for service 17 is not, as14 Currently, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 4(a), (b), (c), and (l).15 Currently, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 4(e)-( j).16 Currently, Fed.

App.$ 742, specifies mailing "by registered mail to the Attorney General of theUnited States," and commenting that the Federal Rule, then Rule 4(d)(4),supersedes, allowing "registered or certified mail"). The current Rule--4(i)--further facilitates service when the United States is a party by permitting the United States Attorney to designate clerical employees to receive process and allowing service on the United States Attorney by mail.See Fed.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtis the whole of Rule 4, a nonjurisdictional rule governing"practice and procedure" in federal cases, see 28 U. S. C.$ 2072(a), consistent with the Rules Enabling Act and Fed-eral Rule 82, and rendering provisions like the Suits in Admiralty Act's service "forthwith" requirement "of no furtherforce or effect," $ 2072(b). See Jones & Laughlin Steel, Inc.v.Mon River Towing, Inc., 772 F. 2d 62, 66 (CA3 1985) ( justas Rule 4 "now governs the method of service of process inadmiralty actions, as well as service of process on the UnitedStates in all civil cases to which it is a party," so the "con-gressional enactment of a uniform 120-day period for accomplishing service of process" supersedes inconsistent priorlaw, in particular, "the Suits in Admiralty Act's requirementof forthwith service"); Kenyon v. United States, 676 F. 2d1229, 1232 (CA9 1981) (Boochever, J., concurring) ("I can seeno logical reason why there should be a different method ofservice in this one instance [Suits in Admiralty Act cases] inwhich the United States is a defendant.").18n. 18. Current Rule 4(i)(3) shows why the suggested separation of "time"from "method" or "manner" in this context is not credible. That provision, addressing "time" in relation to "manner," instructs:"The court shall allow a reasonable time for service of process . . . forthe purpose of curing the failure to serve multiple officers . . . of the UnitedStates if the plaintiff has effected service on either the United Statesattorney or the Attorney General of the United States."18 Judge Boochever, like Judge Friendly, see supra, at 668, n. 13, reluctantly concurred in Circuit precedent, which ranked service "forthwith""a condition precedent to the congressional waiver of the Government'ssovereign immunity," Kenyon, 676 F. 2d, at 1231. But he stated cogentlythe view he would take "if freed from the bounds of stare decisis":"Section 742 does not constitute an integral part of the substantive waiverof sovereign immunity, but is a mere procedural provision necessary atthe time of the statute's enactment, to effectuate that waiver. As such itwas superseded by the Federal Rules." Id., at 1232 (concurring opinion).Curiously, although the Ninth Circuit, in Kenyon and other cases, hastyped the Suits in Admiralty Act service "forthwith" provision "jurisdictional," that Court of Appeals has pointed to a remedy for litigants inHenderson's situation: Amend the complaint, even after the 2-year statute517us2$54P 02-05-99 11:39:02 PAGES OPINPGT671Cite as: 517 U.

S. C. App. $ 742, has been displaced by Rule 4, andtherefore has no current force or effect.* * *For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Ap-peals affirming the dismissal of Henderson's complaint is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistentwith this opinion.
