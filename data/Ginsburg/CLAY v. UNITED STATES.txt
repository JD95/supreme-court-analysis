A motion by a federal prisoner for postconviction reliefunder 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 is subject to a one-year time limitation that generally runs from "the date on which the judg-ment of conviction becomes final." $ 2255, || 6(1). This caseconcerns the starting date for the one-year limitation. Itpresents a narrow but recurring question on which courts ofappeals have divided: When a defendant in a federal prosecu-tion takes an unsuccessful direct appeal from a judgment ofconviction, but does not next petition for a writ of certiorarifrom this Court, does the judgment become "final" for postconviction relief purposes (1) when the appellate court issuesits mandate affirming the conviction, or, instead, (2) on thedate, ordinarily 69 days later, when the time for filing a peti-tion for certiorari expires?In accord with this Court's consistent understanding of fi-nality in the context of collateral review, and the weight oflower court authority, we reject the issuance of the appellate537US2 Unit: $U26 [06-11-03 21:29:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN525Cite as: 537 U. S. 522 (2003)Opinion of the Courtcourt mandate as the triggering date. For the purpose ofstarting the clock on $ 2255's one-year limitation period, wehold, a judgment of conviction becomes final when the timeexpires for filing a petition for certiorari contesting the appellate court's affirmation of the conviction.IIn 1997, petitioner Erick Cornell Clay was convicted ofarson and distribution of cocaine base in the United StatesDistrict Court for the Northern District of Indiana. On No-vember 23, 1998, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed his convictions. That court's mandate issuedon December 15, 1998. See Fed. Rules App. Proc. 40(a)(1)and 41(b) (when no petition for rehearing is filed, a court ofappeals' mandate issues 21 days after entry of judgment).Clay did not file a petition for a writ of certiorari. The timein which he could have petitioned for certiorari expired onFebruary 22, 1999, 90 days after entry of the Court of Ap-peals' judgment, see this Court's Rule 13(1), and 69 daysafter the issuance of the appellate court's mandate.On February 22, 2000--one year and 69 days after theCourt of Appeals issued its mandate and exactly one yearafter the time for seeking certiorari expired--Clay filed amotion in the District Court, pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2255,to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. Congress hasprescribed "[a] 1-year period of limitation" for such motions"run[ning] from the latest of " four specified dates. $ 2255,|| 6. Of the four dates, the only one relevant in this case, asin the generality of cases, is the first: "the date on which thejudgment of conviction becomes final." $ 2255, || 6(1).Relying onGendron v. United States, 154 F. 3d 672, 674(CA7 1998) (per curiam), the District Court stated that"when a federal prisoner in this circuit does not seekcertiorari . . . , the conviction becomes `final' on the datethe appellate court issues the mandate in the direct appeal."App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a. Because Clay filed his $ 2255 mo537US2 Unit: $U26 [06-11-03 21:29:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN526 CLAY v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courttion more than one year after that date, the court denied themotion as time barred.The Seventh Circuit affirmed. That court declined Clay's"invitation to reconsider our holding inGendron," althoughit acknowledged that Gendron's "construction of section 2255represents the minority view." 30 Fed. Appx. 607, 609(2002). "Bowing to stare decisis," the court expressed "reluctan[ce] to overrule [its own] recently-reaffirmed precedentwithout guidance from the Supreme Court." Ibid.The Fourth Circuit has agreed with Gendron's interpretation of $ 2255. See United States v. Torres, 211 F. 3d 836,838-842 (2000) (when a federal prisoner does not file a petition for certiorari, his judgment of conviction becomes finalfor $ 2255 purposes upon issuance of the court of appeals'mandate). Six Courts of Appeals have parted ways withthe Seventh and Fourth Circuits. These courts hold that,for federal prisoners like Clay who do not file petitions forcertiorari following affirmance of their convictions, $ 2255'sone-year limitation period begins to run when the defendant's time for seeking review by this Court expires.1 To secure uniformity in the application of $ 2255's time constraint,we granted certiorari, 536 U. S. 957 (2002), and now reversethe Seventh Circuit's judgment.21 See Derman v. United States, 298 F. 3d 34, 39-42 (CA1 2002); Kapralv. United States, 166 F. 3d 565, 567-577 (CA3 1999); United States v. Gamble, 208 F. 3d 536, 537 (CA5 2000) (per curiam); United States v. Garcia,210 F. 3d 1058, 1059-1061 (CA9 2000); United States v. Burch, 202 F. 3d1274, 1275-1279 (CA10 2000); Kaufmann v. United States, 282 F. 3d 1336,1337-1339 (CA11 2002).2 Agreeing with the position advanced by the majority of the courts ofappeals that have ruled on the question, the United States joins petitionerClay in urging that Clay's $ 2255 motion was timely filed. We thereforeinvited David W. DeBruin to brief and argue this case, as amicus curiae,in support of the Seventh Circuit's judgment. Mr. DeBruin's able advocacy permits us to decide the case satisfied that the relevant issues havebeen fully aired.537US2 Unit: $U26 [06-11-03 21:29:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN527Cite as: 537 U. S. 522 (2003)Opinion of the CourtIIFinality is variously defined; like many legal terms, itsprecise meaning depends on context. Typically, a federaljudgment becomes final for appellate review and claim pre-clusion purposes when the district court disassociates itselffrom the case, leaving nothing to be done at the court of firstinstance save execution of the judgment. See,e. g., Quack-enbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U. S. 706, 712 (1996); Restatement (Second) of Judgments $ 13, Comment b (1980). Forother purposes, finality attaches at a different stage. Forexample, for certain determinations under the Speedy TrialAct of 1974, 18 U. S. C. $ 3161et seq., and under a now-repealed version of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33,several lower courts have held that finality attends issuanceof the appellate court's mandate. See Brief for Amicus Curiae by Invitation of the Court 22-28 (hereinafter DeBruinBrief) (citing cases). For the purpose of seeking review bythis Court, in contrast, "[t]he time to file a petition for a writof certiorari runs from the date of entry of the judgment ororder sought to be reviewed, and not from the issuance dateof the mandate (or its equivalent under local practice)."This Court's Rule 13(3).Here, the relevant context is postconviction relief, a context in which finality has a long-recognized, clear meaning:Finality attaches when this Court affirms a conviction on themerits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ ofcertiorari, or when the time for filing a certiorari petitionexpires. See,e. g., Caspari v. Bohlen, 510 U. S. 383, 390(1994); Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, 321, n. 6 (1987);Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880, 887 (1983); United Statesv. Johnson, 457 U. S. 537, 542, n. 8 (1982); Linkletter v.Walker, 381 U. S. 618, 622, n. 5 (1965). Because "we presume that Congress expects its statutes to be read in con-formity with this Court's precedents,"United States v.Wells, 519 U. S. 482, 495 (1997), our unvarying understanding537US2 Unit: $U26 [06-11-03 21:29:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN528 CLAY v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtof finality for collateral review purposes would ordinarily de-termine the meaning of "becomes final" in $ 2255.Amicus urges a different determinant, relying on verbaldifferences between $ 2255 and a parallel statutory provision,28 U. S. C. $ 2244(d)(1), which governs petitions for federalhabeas corpus by state prisoners. See DeBruin Brief 8-20.Sections 2255 and 2244(d)(1), as now formulated, were re-shaped by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death PenaltyAct of 1996. See $$ 101, 105, 110 Stat. 1217, 1220. Prior tothat Act, no statute of limitations governed requests for federal habeas corpus or $ 2255 habeas-like relief. See Vasquezv.Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 265 (1986); United States v. Nahodil,36 F. 3d 323, 328 (CA3 1994). Like $ 2255, $ 2244(d)(1) establishes a one-year limitation period, running from the latest offour specified dates. Three of the four time triggers under$ 2244(d)(1) closely track corresponding portions of $ 2255.Compare $$ 2244(d)(1)(B)-(D) with $ 2255, |||| 6(2)-(4). Butwhere $ 2255, || 6(1), refers simply to "the date on which thejudgment of conviction becomes final," $ 2244(d)(1)(A) speaksof "the date on which the judgment became final by the con-clusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review." 3When "Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the sameAct," we have recognized, "it is generally presumed thatCongress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparateinclusion or exclusion."Russello v. United States, 464 U. S.3 The Courts of Appeals have uniformly interpreted "direct review" in$ 2244(d)(1)(A) to encompass review of a state conviction by this Court.See Derman v. United States, 298 F. 3d, at 40-41; Williams v. Artuz, 237F. 3d 147, 151 (CA2 2001); Kapral v. United States, 166 F. 3d, at 575; Hillv. Braxton, 277 F. 3d 701, 704 (CA4 2002); Ott v.

Wong Kim Bo, 472F. 2d 720, 722 (CA5 1972)). Invoking the maxim recited inRussello, amicus asserts that "becomes final" in $ 2255,|| 6(1), cannot mean the same thing as "became final" in$ 2244(d)(1)(A); reading the two as synonymous, amicusmaintains, would render superfluous the words "by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seek-ing such review"--words found only in the latter provision.DeBruin Brief 8-20. We can give effect to the discretewording of the two prescriptions,amicus urges, if we adoptthe following rule: When a convicted defendant does not seekcertiorari on direct review, $ 2255's limitation period startsto run on the date the court of appeals issues its mandate.Id., at 36.4Amicus would have a stronger argument if $ 2255, || 6(1),explicitly incorporated the first of $ 2244(d)(1)(A)'s finalityformulations but not the second, so that the $ 2255 text read"becomes final by the conclusion of direct review." Had$ 2255 explicitly provided for the first of the two finality triggers set forth in $ 2244(d)(1)(A), one might indeed questionthe soundness of interpreting $ 2255 implicitly to incorporate$ 2244(d)(1)(A)'s second trigger as well. As written, how-ever, $ 2255 does not qualify "becomes final" at all. Usingneither of the disjunctive phrases that follow the words "be-came final" in $ 2244(d)(1)(A), $ 2255 simply leaves "becomesfinal" undefined.Russello, we think it plain, hardly warrants the decisionamicus urges, one that would hold the $ 2255 petitioner to4 Although recognizing that "the question is not presented in this case,"Tr. of Oral Arg. 27, amicus suggests that $ 2255's limitation period startsto run upon issuance of the court of appeals' mandate even in cases inwhich the defendant does petition for certiorari. Id., at 27-28, 36-38, 41-42. As amicus also recognizes, however, id., at 41, courts of appeals"have uniformly concluded that, if a prisoner petitions for certiorari, thecontested conviction becomes final when the Supreme Court either deniesthe writ or issues a decision on the merits," United States v. Hicks, 283F. 3d 380, 387 (CADC 2002).537US2 Unit: $U26 [06-11-03 21:29:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN530 CLAY v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courta tighter time constraint than the petitioner governed by$ 2244(d)(1)(A).Russello concerned the meaning of a provision in the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt OrganizationsAct (RICO), 18 U. S. C. $ 1961et seq., that directed forfeitureto the United States of "any interest [a convicted defendant]has acquired . . . in violation of [the Act]." $ 1963(a)(1). Thepetitioner in Russello urged a narrow construction of theunqualified words "any interest . . . acquired." Rejectingthat argument, we observed that a succeeding subsection, $ 1963(a)(2), reached "any interest in . . . any enterprise"the defendant conducted in violation of RICO's proscriptions. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) At that point,we referred to the maxim invoked by amicus. See supra,at 528. The qualifying words "in . . . any enterprise" narrowed $ 1963(a)(2), but in no way affected $ 1963(a)(1). Thecomparison of the two subsections, we said, "fortified" thebroad construction we approved for the unmodified words"any interest . . . acquired." Russello, 464 U. S., at 22-23(internal quotation marks omitted); see id., at 23 ("Had Congress intended to restrict $ 1963(a)(1) to an interest in anenterprise, it presumably would have done so expressly as itdid in the immediately following subsection (a)(2).").Far from supporting the Seventh Circuit's constrictedreading of $ 2255, || 6(1), Russello's reasoning tends in Clay'sfavor. An unqualified term--here "becomes final"--Russello indicates, calls for a reading surely no less broad than apinpointed one--here, $ 2244(d)(1)(A)'s specification "becamefinal by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration ofthe time for seeking such review."Moreover, as Clay and the Government urge, see Brief forPetitioner 22; Reply Brief for United States 7-8, one canreadily comprehend why Congress might have found it appropriate to spell out the meaning of "final" in $ 2244(d)(1)(A)but not in $ 2255. Section 2244(d)(1) governs petitions bystate prisoners. In that context, a bare reference to "became final" might have suggested that finality assessments537US2 Unit: $U26 [06-11-03 21:29:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN531Cite as: 537 U. S. 522 (2003)Opinion of the Courtshould be made by reference to state-law rules that may dif-fer from the general federal rule and vary from State toState. Cf. Artuz v. Bennett, 531 U. S. 4, 8 (2000) (an applica-tion for state postconviction relief is "properly filed" for purposes of 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(d)(2) "when its delivery and accept-ance are in compliance with the applicable [state] laws andrules governing filings"). The words "by the conclusionof direct review or the expiration of the time for seekingsuch review" make it clear that finality for the purpose of$ 2244(d)(1)(A) is to be determined by reference to a uniformfederal rule. Section 2255, however, governs only petitionsby federal prisoners; within the federal system there is nocomparable risk of varying rules to guard against.Amicus also submits that 28 U. S. C. $ 2263 "reinforces"the Seventh Circuit's understanding of $ 2255. DeBruinBrief 20; accord, Torres, 211 F. 3d, at 840. Chapter 154 ofTitle 28 governs certain habeas petitions filed by deathsentenced state prisoners. Section 2263(a) prescribes a180-day limitation period for such petitions running from"final State court affirmance of the conviction and sentenceon direct review or the expiration of the time for seekingsuch review." That period is tolled, however, "from the datethat a petition for certiorari is filed in the Supreme Courtuntil the date of final disposition of the petition if a Stateprisoner files the petition to secure review by the SupremeCourt of the affirmance of a capital sentence on direct reviewby the court of last resort of the State or other final Statecourt decision on direct review." $ 2263(b)(1).We do not find in $ 2263 cause to alter our reading of $ 2255.First, amicus' reliance on $ 2263 encounters essentially thesame problem as does his reliance on $ 2244(d)(1)(A): Section2255, || 6(1), refers to neither of the two events that $ 2263(a)identifies as possible starting points for the limitation period--"affirmance of the conviction and sentence on directreview" and "the expiration of the time for seeking such review." Thus, reasoning by negative implication from $ 2263537US2 Unit: $U26 [06-11-03 21:29:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN532 CLAY v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtdoes not justify the conclusion that $ 2255, || 6(1)'s limitationperiod begins to run at one of those times rather than theother. Cf. supra, at 529-531. Second, $ 2263(a) ties the ap-plicable limitation period to "affirmance of the conviction andsentence," while $ 2255, || 6(1), ties the limitation period tothe date when "the judgment of conviction becomes final."See Torres, 211 F. 3d, at 845 (Hamilton, J., dissenting). "TheRussello presumption--that the presence of a phrase in oneprovision and its absence in another reveals Congress' design--grows weaker with each difference in the formulationof the provisions under inspection." Columbus v. Ours Garage & Wrecker Service, Inc., 536 U. S. 424, 435-436 (2002).* * *We hold that, for federal criminal defendants who do notfile a petition for certiorari with this Court on direct review,$ 2255's one-year limitation period starts to run when thetime for seeking such review expires. Under this rule,Clay's $ 2255 petition was timely filed. The judgment of theUnited States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit istherefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further pro-ceedings consistent with this opinion.
