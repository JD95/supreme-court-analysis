Petitioner Remon Lee asserts that a Missouri trial courtdeprived him of due process when the court refused to grantan overnight continuance of his trial. Lee sought the con-tinuance to locate subpoenaed, previously present, but suddenly missing witnesses key to his defense against felonycharges. On direct review, the Missouri Court of Appealsdisposed of the case on a state procedural ground. Thatcourt found the continuance motion defective under theState's rules. It therefore declined to consider the meritsof Lee's plea that the trial court had denied him a fair opportunity to present a defense. Whether the state ground dis-positive in the Missouri Court of Appeals is adequate to preclude federal habeas corpus review is the question we hereconsider and decide.On the third day of his trial, Lee was convicted of first-degree murder and armed criminal action. His sole affirmative defense was an alibi; Lee maintained he was in Califor-nia, staying with his family, when the Kansas City crimes forwhich he was indicted occurred. Lee's mother, stepfather,and sister voluntarily came to Missouri to testify on his behalf. They were sequestered in the courthouse at the startof the trial's third day. For reasons then unknown, theywere not in the courthouse later in the day when defensecounsel sought to present their testimony. Discoveringtheir absence, defense counsel moved for a continuance untilthe next morning so that he could endeavor to locate thethree witnesses and bring them back to court.The trial judge denied the motion, stating that it lookedto him as though the witnesses had "in effect abandonedMoore of Mississippi, Mike McGrath of Montana, Frankie Sue Del Papaof Nevada, Betty D. Montgomery of Ohio, W. A. Drew Edmondson of Oklahoma, D. Michael Fisher of Pennsylvania, Charles M. Condon of SouthCarolina, and Mark L. Shurtleff of Utah; and for the Criminal JusticeLegal Foundation by Kent S. Scheidegger.534US2 Unit: $U19 [04-10-03 17:04:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN366 LEE v. KEMNAOpinion of the Courtthe defendant" and that, for personal reasons, he would"not be able to be [in court the next day] to try the case."Furthermore, he had "another case set for trial" the nextweekday. App. 22. The trial resumed without pause, noalibi witnesses testified, and the jury found Lee guilty ascharged.Neither the trial judge nor the prosecutor identified anyprocedural flaw in the presentation or content of Lee's motion for a continuance. The Missouri Court of Appeals, however, held the denial of the motion proper because Lee'scounsel had failed to comply with Missouri Supreme CourtRules not relied upon or even mentioned in the trial court:Rule 24.09, which requires that continuance motions be inwritten form, accompanied by an affidavit; and Rule 24.10,which sets out the showings a movant must make to gain acontinuance grounded on the absence of witnesses.We hold that the Missouri Rules, as injected into this caseby the state appellate court, did not constitute a state groundadequate to bar federal habeas review. Caught in the midstof a murder trial and unalerted to any procedural defect inhis presentation, defense counsel could hardly be expectedto divert his attention from the proceedings rapidly unfolding in the courtroom and train, instead, on preparation of awritten motion and affidavit. Furthermore, the trial court,at the time Lee moved for a continuance, had in clear viewthe information needed to rule intelligently on the meritsof the motion. Beyond doubt, Rule 24.10 serves the State'simportant interest in regulating motions for a continuance--motions readily susceptible to use as a delaying tactic. Butunder the circumstances of this case, we hold that petitionerLee, having substantially, if imperfectly, made the basicshowings Rule 24.10 prescribes, qualifies for adjudication ofhis federal, due process claim. His asserted right to defendshould not depend on a formal "ritual . . . [that] would furtherno perceivable state interest." Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.

Rhodes pleaded guilty, and Remon Lee,the alleged getaway driver, was tried for first-degree murderand armed criminal action.Lee's trial took place within the span of three days inFebruary 1994. His planned alibi defense--that he was inCalifornia with his family at the time of the murder--sur-faced at each stage of the proceedings. During voir dire onthe first day of trial, Lee's court-appointed defense attorneyinformed prospective jurors that "[t]here will be a defense inthis case, which is a defense of alibi." App. 10; see also ibid.("And we'll put on evidence--I can't go into it now--that hewas somewhere else, he couldn't commit the crime and I be-lieve the judge will give an instruction on alibi at the conclusion of my case."). Later in the voir dire, defense counselidentified the three alibi witnesses as Lee's mother, GladysEdwards, Lee's sister, Laura Lee, and Lee's stepfather,James Edwards, a minister.Id., at 11-13.The planned alibi defense figured prominently in counsels'opening statements on day two of Lee's trial. The prosecu-tor, at the close of her statement, said she expected an alibidefense from Lee and would present testimony to disproveit. Tr. 187. Defense counsel, in his opening statement, described the alibi defense in detail, telling the jury that theevidence would show Lee was not in Kansas City, and therefore could not have engaged in crime there, in August 1992.App. 12-13. Specifically, defense counsel said three closefamily members would testify that Lee came to visit them in534US2 Unit: $U19 [04-10-03 17:04:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN368 LEE v. KEMNAOpinion of the CourtVentura, California, in July 1992 and stayed through the endof October. Lee's mother and stepfather would say theypicked him up from the airport at the start of his visit andreturned him there at the end. Lee's sister would testifythat Lee resided with her and her four children during thistime. All three would affirm that they saw Lee regularlythroughout his unbroken sojourn. Ibid.During the prosecution case, two eyewitnesses to theshooting identified Lee as the driver. The first, ReginaldWilliams, admitted during cross-examination that he hadtold Lee's first defense counsel in a taped interview thatRhodes, not Lee, was the driver. Tr. 285. Williams saidhe had given that response because he misunderstood thequestion and did not want to be "bothered" by the interviewer. Id., at 283, 287. The second eyewitness, WilliamSanders, was unable to pick Lee out of a photographic arrayon the day of the shooting; Sanders identified Lee as thedriver for the first time 18 months after the murder.Id.,at 413-414.Two other witnesses, Rhonda Shelby and Lynne Bryant,were called by the prosecutor. Each testified that she knewLee and had seen him in Kansas City the night before themurder. Both said Lee was with Rhodes, who had askedwhere Steven Shelby (the murder victim) was. Id., at 443-487. The State offered no physical evidence connecting Leeto the murder and did not suggest a motive.The defense case began at 10:25 a.m. on the third and finalday of trial. Two impeachment witnesses testified thatmorning. Just after noon, counsel met with the trial judgein chambers for a charge conference. At that meeting, thejudge apparently agreed to give an alibi instruction submitted by Lee. Id., at 571.11 That Lee had submitted an alibi instruction during the charge conference became apparent when the trial judge, delivering the charge, beganto read the proposed instruction. He was interrupted by the prosecutor534US2 Unit: $U19 [04-10-03 17:04:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN369Cite as: 534 U. S. 362 (2002)Opinion of the CourtAt some point in the late morning or early afternoon, thealibi witnesses left the courthouse. Just after one o'clock,Lee took the stand outside the presence of the jury and, forthe record, responded to his counsel's questions concerninghis knowledge of the witnesses' unanticipated absence.App. 15. Lee, under oath, stated that Gladys and JamesEdwards and Laura Lee had voluntarily traveled from California to testify on his behalf. Id., at 16. He affirmed hiscounsel's representations that the three witnesses, thenstaying with Lee's uncle in Kansas City, had met with Lee'scounsel and received subpoenas from him; he similarly affirmed that the witnesses had met with a Kansas City policeofficer, who interviewed them on behalf of the prosecutor.Id., at 16-18. Lee said he had seen his sister, mother, andstepfather in the courthouse that morning at 8:30 and laterduring a recess.On discovering the witnesses' absence, Lee could not callthem at his uncle's house because there was no phone on thepremises. He asked his girlfriend to try to find the witnesses, but she was unable to do so. Id., at 17. AlthoughLee did not know the witnesses' whereabouts at that moment, he said he knew "in fact they didn't go back to California" because "they [had] some ministering . . . to do" inKansas City both Thursday and Friday evenings. Id., at 18.He asked for "a couple hours' continuance [to] try to locatethem, because it's very valuable to my case." Ibid. Defense counsel subsequently moved for a continuance until thenext morning, to gain time to enforce the subpoenas he hadserved on the witnesses. Id., at 20. The trial judge responded that he could not hold court the next day because"my daughter is going to be in the hospital all day . . . [s]oI've got to stay with her." Ibid.and defense counsel, who reminded him that the instruction was no longernecessary. Tr. 594-595.534US2 Unit: $U19 [04-10-03 17:04:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN370 LEE v. KEMNAOpinion of the CourtAfter a brief further exchange between court and counsel,2 the judge denied the continuance request. The judgeobserved:"It looks to me as though the folks were here and thenin effect abandoned the defendant. And that, of course,we can't--we can't blame that on the State. The Statehad absolutely nothing to do with that. That's--it's toobad. The Court will not be able to be here tomorrowto try the case." Id., at 22.Counsel then asked for a postponement until Monday (thenext business day after the Friday the judge was to spendwith his daughter in the hospital). The judge denied thatrequest too, noting that he had another case set for trial thatday. Ibid.In a final colloquy before the jury returned to the courtroom, defense counsel told the court he would be making amotion for judgment of acquittal. The judge asked, "You'regoing to give that to me . . . orally and you'll supplementthat with a written motion?" Counsel agreed. Id., at 23.When the jurors returned, defense counsel informed themthat the three witnesses from California he had planned tocall "were here and have gone"; further, counsel did not"know why they've gone." Id., at 25. The defense thenrested. In closing argument, Lee's counsel returned to thealibi defense he was unable to present. "I do apologize,"he said, "I don't know what happened to my witnesses.They're not here. Couldn't put them on on the question ofalibi." Id., at 26. The prosecutor commented on the samegap: "Where are those alibi witnesses that [defense counsel]promised you from opening[?] They're not here." Id., at27.2 Responding to the court's questions, Lee's counsel said he had copiesof the witnesses' written statements and their subpoenas. App. 20-21.Counsel next began to describe the subpoenas. When counsel listedGladys Edwards, the court asked "[i]s she the mother?" Id., at 21.534US2 Unit: $U19 [04-10-03 17:04:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN371Cite as: 534 U. S. 362 (2002)Opinion of the CourtAfter deliberating for three hours, the jury convicted Leeon both counts. He was subsequently sentenced to prisonfor life without possibility of parole. Id., at 43.The trial court later denied Lee's new trial motion, whichLee grounded, in part, on the denial of the continuance mo-tion. Id., at 31-32, 42. Lee, at first pro se but later represented by appointed counsel, next filed a motion for statepostconviction relief. Lee argued,inter alia, that the re-fusal to grant his request for an overnight continuance deprived him of his federal constitutional right to a defense.Id., at 56-59.3 In his postconviction motion, Lee assertedthat the three witnesses had left the courthouse because"an unknown person," whom he later identified as an employee of the prosecutor's office, had told them "they werenot needed to testify." Id., at 56-58. The postconvictioncourt denied the motion, stating that under Missouri law,an allegedly improper denial of a continuance fits withinthe category "trial error," a matter to be raised on directappeal, not in a collateral challenge to a conviction.Id., at70.Lee's direct appeal and his appeal from the denial of post-conviction relief were consolidated before the Missouri Courtof Appeals. See Mo. Sup. Ct. Rule 29.15(l) (1994). There,Lee again urged that the trial court's refusal to continue thecase overnight denied him due process and the right to puton a defense. App. 90-95. In response, the State arguedfor the first time that Lee's continuance request had a fatalprocedural flaw.Id., at 110-115. In particular, the Statecontended that Lee's application failed to comply with Mis-souri Supreme Court Rule 24.10 (Rule 24.10), which liststhe showings required in a continuance request based on3 Missouri procedure at the time required Lee to file his postconvictionmotion in the sentencing court shortly after he filed his notice of directappeal. See Mo. Sup. Ct. Rule 29.15(b) (1994) (requiring motion to bemade within 30 days of filing of court transcript in appellate court considering direct appeal). The direct appeal was "suspended" while the trialcourt considered the postconviction motion. See Rule 29.15(l).534US2 Unit: $U19 [04-10-03 17:04:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN372 LEE v. KEMNAOpinion of the Courtthe absence of witnesses.4 By the State's reckoning, Lee'srequest did not show the materiality of the California witnesses' testimony or the grounds for believing that thewitnesses could be found within a reasonable time; in addition, the prosecution urged, Lee failed to "testify that thewitnesse[s'] absence was not due to his own procurement."App. 113.The Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed Lee's convictionand the denial of postconviction relief. State v. Lee, 935S. W. 2d 689 (1996); App. 123-131. The appellate court firstnoted that Lee's continuance motion was oral and thereforedid not comply with Missouri Supreme Court Rule 24.09(Rule 24.09), which provides that such applications shall be inwritten form, accompanied by an affidavit. App. 126-127.54 Rule 24.10 reads:"Misdemeanors or Felonies--Application for a Continuance on Accountof Absence of Witnesses Shall Show What"An application for a continuance on account of the absence of witnessesor their evidence shall show:"(a) The facts showing the materiality of the evidence sought to be obtained and due diligence upon the part of the applicant to obtain suchwitness or testimony;"(b) The name and residence of such witness, if known, or, if not known,the use of diligence to obtain the same, and also facts showing reasonablegrounds for belief that the attendance or testimony of such witness willbe procured within a reasonable time;"(c) What particular facts the affiant believes the witness will prove,and that he knows of no other person whose evidence or attendance hecould have procured at the trial, by whom he can prove or so fully provethe same facts;"(d) That such witness is not absent by the connivance, consent, or procurement of the applicant, and such application is not made for vexationor delay, but in good faith for the purpose of obtaining a fair and impartial trial."If the court shall be of the opinion that the affidavit is insufficient itshall permit it to be amended."5 Rule 24.09 reads:"Misdemeanors or Felonies--Application for Continuance--How Made"An application for a continuance shall be made by a written motionaccompanied by the affidavit of the applicant or some other credible person534US2 Unit: $U19 [04-10-03 17:04:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN373Cite as: 534 U. S. 362 (2002)Opinion of the Court"Thus," the Court of Appeals said, "the trial court couldhave properly denied the motion for a failure to comply withRule 24.09." Id., at 127. Even assuming the adequacy ofLee's oral motion, the court continued, the application "wasmade without the factual showing required by Rule 24.10."Ibid. The court did not say which components of Rule 24.10were unsatisfied. "When a denial to grant a motion for con-tinuance is based on a deficient application," the Court ofAppeals next said, "it does not constitute an abuse of discre-tion."Ibid. Lee's subsequent motions for rehearing andtransfer to the Missouri Supreme Court were denied.In January 1998, Lee, proceeding pro se, filed an appli-cation for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri. Id., at132. Lee once again challenged the denial of his continuancemotion. Id., at 147-152. He appended affidavits from thethree witnesses, each of whom swore to Lee's alibi; sister,mother, and stepfather alike stated that they had left thecourthouse while the trial was underway because a courtofficer told them their testimony would not be needed thatday.Id., at 168-174.6 Lee maintained that the State hadengineered the witnesses' departure; accordingly, he assetting forth the facts upon which the application is based, unless the adverse party consents that the application for continuance may be madeorally."6 The witnesses' accounts of their departure from the courthouse wereas follows:Laura Lee: "[T]hose people in Missouri told us we could leave becauseOUR TESTIMONY would not be needed until the next day." App. 169.Gladys Edwards: "[T]he officer of the court came and told us that theprosecutor stated that the state[']s case will again take up the remainderof that day. That [o]ur testimony will not be needed until the followingday, that we could leave until the following day. He . . . told [u]s not toworry, the Judge knows [w]e came to testify, they have [o]ur statements,and the trial will not be over until we testify. So at those instructionswe left." Id., at 172.James Edwards: "[W]hile at the [c]ourthouse, we were told by an officerof the court that [o]ur testimony would not be needed until the followingday, we were excused until then." Id., at 174.534US2 Unit: $U19 [04-10-03 17:04:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN374 LEE v. KEMNAOpinion of the Courtserted that prosecutorial misconduct, not anything overwhich he had control, prompted the need for a continuance.Id., at 148, 155-156.The District Court denied the writ. No. 98-0074-CV-W-6-P (WD Mo., Apr. 19, 1999), App. 212-218. The witnesses'affidavits were not cognizable in federal habeas proceedings,the court held, because Lee could have offered them to thestate courts but failed to do so.Id., at 215 (citing 28 U. S. C.$ 2254(e) (1994 ed., Supp. V)). The Federal District Courtwent on to reject Lee's continuance claim, finding in the Mis-souri Court of Appeals' invocation of Rule 24.10 an adequateand independent state-law ground barring further review.App. 217.The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit granted acertificate of appealability, limited to the question whetherLee's "due process rights were violated by the state trialcourt's failure to allow him a continuance,"id., at 232, andaffirmed the denial of Lee's habeas petition. 213 F. 3d 1037(2000)(per curiam). Federal review of Lee's due processclaim would be unavailable, the court correctly observed, ifthe state court's rejection of that claim " `rest[ed] . . . ona state law ground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment,' regardless of`whether the state law ground is substantive or procedural.' "Id., at 1038 (quoting Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722,729 (1991)). "The Missouri Court of Appeals rejected Lee'sclaim because his motion for a continuance did not complywith [Rules] 24.09 and 24.10," the Eighth Circuit next stated.Thus, that court concluded, "the claim was procedurally de-faulted." 213 F. 3d, at 1038.77 Lee had asked the federal appeals court to excuse the procedurallapse, suggesting that trial counsel's failure to follow Missouri's motionrules qualified as ineffective assistance of counsel. Lee had not exhaustedthat claim in state court, the Eighth Circuit responded, therefore he couldnot assert it in federal habeas proceedings. 213 F. 3d, at 1038. Furthermore, the federal appeals court ruled, Lee could not rest on a plea of534US2 Unit: $U19 [04-10-03 17:04:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN375Cite as: 534 U. S. 362 (2002)Opinion of the CourtChief District Judge Bennett, sitting by designation fromthe District Court for the Northern District of Iowa, dissented. In his view, Rules 24.09 and 24.10 did not supplystate-law grounds "adequate" to preclude federal review inthe particular circumstances of this case. Id., at 1041-1049.We granted Lee's pro se petition for a writ of certiorari,531 U. S. 1189 (2001), and appointed counsel, 532 U. S. 956(2001). We now vacate the Court of Appeals judgment.IIThis Court will not take up a question of federal law pre-sented in a case "if the decision of [the state] court rests ona state law ground that is independent of the federal ques-tion andadequate to support the judgment." Coleman v.Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729 (1991) (emphases added). Therule applies with equal force whether the state-law groundis substantive or procedural. Ibid. We first developed theindependent and adequate state ground doctrine in cases ondirect review from state courts, and later applied it as well"in deciding whether federal district courts should addressthe claims of state prisoners in habeas corpus actions."Ibid. "[T]he adequacy of state procedural bars to the asser-tion of federal questions," we have recognized, is not withinthe State's prerogative finally to decide; rather, adequacy "isitself a federal question."Douglas v. Alabama, 380 U. S.415, 422 (1965).Lee does not suggest that Rules 24.09 and 24.10, asbrought to bear on this case by the Missouri Court of Appeals, depended in any way on federal law. Nor does hequestion the general applicability of the two codified Rules.He does maintain that both Rules--addressed initially toMissouri trial courts, but in his case invoked only at the"actual innocence" to escape the procedural bar because "the factualbasis for the [alibi witness] affidavits he relies on as new evidence existedat the time of the trial and could have been presented earlier." Id., at1039.534US2 Unit: $U19 [04-10-03 17:04:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN376 LEE v. KEMNAOpinion of the Courtappellate stage--are inadequate, under the extraordinarycircumstances of this case, to close out his federal, fairopportunity-to-defend claim. We now turn to that disposi-tive issue.8Ordinarily, violation of "firmly established and regularlyfollowed" state rules--for example, those involved in thiscase--will be adequate to foreclose review of a federal claim.James v. Kentucky, 466 U. S. 341, 348 (1984); see Ford v.Georgia, 498 U. S. 411, 422-424 (1991). There are, however,exceptional cases in which exorbitant application of a gener-ally sound rule renders the state ground inadequate to stopconsideration of a federal question. See Davis v. Wechsler,263 U. S. 22, 24 (1923) (Holmes, J.) ("Whatever springes theState may set for those who are endeavoring to assert rightsthat the State confers, the assertion of federal rights, whenplainly and reasonably made, is not to be defeated under thename of local practice."). This case fits within that limitedcategory.Our analysis and conclusion are informed and controlledby Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U. S. 103 (1990). There, the Courtconsidered Osborne's objections that his child pornographyconviction violated due process because the trial judge hadnot required the government to prove two elements of thealleged crime: lewd exhibition and scienter. Id., at 107, 122-125. The Ohio Supreme Court held the constitutional objections procedurally barred because Osborne had failed to8 Missouri argues in two footnotes to its brief that Lee's federal claimfails for a reason independent of Rules 24.09 and 24.10, namely, that heraised only state-law objections to denial of the continuance motion instate court. Brief for Respondent 16, n. 2, 32, n. 7. Lee urges, in response, that his direct appeal brief explicitly invoked due process and hisright to present witnesses in his defense as guaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth,and Fourteenth Amendments. Reply Brief 11, n. 4 (citing App. 86-87,90-95). Missouri did not advance its current contention in the State'sEighth Circuit brief or in its brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari. We therefore exercise "our discretion to deem the [alleged] defectwaived." Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U. S. 808, 816 (1985).534US2 Unit: $U19 [04-10-03 17:04:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN377Cite as: 534 U. S. 362 (2002)Opinion of the Courtobject contemporaneously to the judge's charge, which didnot instruct the jury that it could convict only for conductthat satisfied both the scienter and the lewdness elements.Id., at 107-108, 123; see Ohio Rule Crim. Proc. 30(A) (1989)("A party may not assign as error the giving or the failureto give any instructions unless he objects thereto beforethe jury retires to consider its verdict, stating specificallythe matter to which he objects and the grounds of hisobjection.").We agreed with the State that Osborne's failure to urgethe trial court to instruct the jury on scienter qualified as an"adequate state-law ground [to] preven[t] us from reachingOsborne's due process contention on that point." 495 U. S.,at 123. Ohio law, which was not in doubt, required proofof scienter unless the applicable statute specified otherwise.Id., at 112-113, n. 9, 123. The State's contemporaneous objection rule, we observed, "serves the State's important interest in ensuring that counsel do their part in preventingtrial courts from providing juries with erroneous instructions." Id., at 123."With respect to the trial court's failure to instruct onlewdness, however, we reach[ed] a different conclusion."Ibid. Counsel for Osborne had made his position on thatessential element clear in a motion to dismiss overruled justbefore trial, and the trial judge, "in no uncertain terms,"id., at 124, had rejected counsel's argument. After a brieftrial, the judge charged the jury in line with his rulingagainst Osborne on the pretrial motion to dismiss. Counsel's failure to object to the charge by reasserting the argument he had made unsuccessfully on the motion to dismiss,we held, did not deter our disposition of the constitutionalquestion. "Given this sequence of events," we explained, itwas proper to "reach Osborne's [second] due process claim,"for Osborne's attorney had "pressed the issue of the State'sfailure of proof on lewdness before the trial court and . . .nothing would be gained by requiring Osborne's lawyer to534US2 Unit: $U19 [04-10-03 17:04:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN378 LEE v. KEMNAOpinion of the Courtobject a second time, specifically to the jury instructions."Ibid. In other words, although we did not doubt the generalapplicability of the Ohio Rule of Criminal Procedure requir-ing contemporaneous objection to jury charges, we nevertheless concluded that, in this atypical instance, the Rule wouldserve "no perceivable state interest."Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).Our decision, we added in Osborne, followed from "thegeneral principle that an objection which is ample and timelyto bring the alleged federal error to the attention of thetrial court and enable it to take appropriate corrective actionis sufficient to serve legitimate state interests, and therefore sufficient to preserve the claim for review here." Id.,at 125 (quoting Douglas, 380 U. S., at 422 (internal quotationmarks omitted)). This general principle, and the unusual"sequence of events" before us--rapidly unfolding eventsthat Lee and his counsel could not have foreseen, and forwhich they were not at all responsible--similarly guide ourjudgment in this case.The dissent strives mightily to distinguish Osborne, anopinion Justices Kennedy and Scalia joined, but cannotdo so convincingly. In an intricate discussion of Osbornelonger than the relevant section of Osborne itself, the dissentcrafts its own rationales for the decision and sweeps awaylanguage its design cannot accommodate as "unnecessary"and "in tension" with the rest of the Court's analysis, post,at 399.As attentive reading of the relevant pages of Osborne willconfirm, 495 U. S., at 123-125, we here rely not on "isolatedstatements" from the opinion, post, at 396, but solidly on itsanalysis and holding on "the adequacy of state proceduralbars to the assertion of federal questions." 495 U. S., at 125(quoting Douglas, 380 U. S., at 422 (internal quotationmarks omitted)).According to the dissent in this case, Osborne's discretesection trained on the adequacy of state-law grounds to bar534US2 Unit: $U19 [04-10-03 17:04:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN379Cite as: 534 U. S. 362 (2002)Opinion of the Courtfederal review had two bases. First, the dissent views ascentral to Osborne the "unforeseeab[ility]" of the Ohio Supreme Court's limiting construction of the child pornographystatute at issue there, i. e., that court's addition of the "lewdness" element on which Osborne failed to request a jurycharge. Post, at 397-398; see also post, at 399. The dissenthere is characteristically inventive. Osborne spoke not ofthe predictabilityvel non of the Ohio Supreme Court'sconstruction; instead, this Court asked whether anything"would be gained by requiring Osborne's lawyer to object asecond time" on the question of lewdness, 495 U. S., at 124,and answered that question with a firm "no." Tellingly, Osborne noted, without criticism, the Ohio Supreme Court'sown indication that the limiting construction of the child por-nography statute wasnot unpredictable, for it flowed fromthe "proper purposes" exceptions set out by the Legislature.Id., at 113, n. 10.Second, the dissent suggests that Osborne is enlighteningonly as to "Ohio's treatment of overbreadth objections."Post, at 398.

KEMNAOpinion of the Courtcircumstances, however, unyielding application of the gen-eral rule would disserve any perceivable interest.The asserted procedural oversights in Lee's case, his al-leged failures fully to comply with Rules 24.09 and 24.10,were first raised more than two and a half years after Lee'strial. The two Rules, Missouri maintains, "work togetherto enhance the reliability of a trial court's determination ofwhether to delay a scheduled criminal trial due to the absence of a witness." Brief for Respondent 29 (footnote omit-ted) (emphasis added). Nevertheless, neither the prosecutor nor the trial judge so much as mentioned the Rules asa reason for denying Lee's continuance motion.10 If eitherprosecutor or judge considered supplementation of Lee's mo-tion necessary, they likely would have alerted the defense atthe appropriate time, and Lee would have had an opportu-nity to perfect his plea to hold the case over until the nextday. Rule 24.10, we note, after listing the components of acontinuance motion, contemplates subsequent perfection: "Ifthe court shall be of the opinion that the affidavit is insuffi-cient it shall permit it to be amended."The State, once content that the continuance motion wasripe for trial court disposition on the merits, had a secondthought on appeal. It raised Rule 24.10 as a new argumentin its brief to the Missouri Court of Appeals; even then, theState did not object to the motion's oral form. App. 107-108,110-115. The Missouri Court of Appeals, it seems, raisedRule 24.09's writing requirements ("a written motion accom-panied by [an] affidavit") on its own motion.1110 By contrast, the judge specifically directed Lee's counsel to supplement counsel's oral motion for judgment of acquittal with a written motion. See supra, at 370.11 The belated assertion of these Rules also explains why Lee did notcontend in his state postconviction motion that counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing meticulously to comply with Rules 24.09 and24.10. That postconviction motion had been made and denied in the trialcourt before the Rules' entry into the case when Lee proceeded on appeal.See supra, at 371, n. 3.534US2 Unit: $U19 [04-10-03 17:04:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN381Cite as: 534 U. S. 362 (2002)Opinion of the CourtThree considerations, in combination, lead us to concludethat this case falls within the small category of cases inwhich asserted state grounds are inadequate to block adjudi-cation of a federal claim. First, when the trial judge deniedLee's motion, he stated a reason that could not have beencountered by a perfect motion for continuance. The judgesaid he could not carry the trial over until the next daybecause he had to be with his daughter in the hospital;the judge further informed counsel that another scheduledtrial prevented him from concluding Lee's case on the following business day. Although the judge hypothesized thatthe witnesses had "abandoned" Lee,id., at 22, he had not"a scintilla of evidence or a shred of information" on whichto base this supposition, 213 F. 3d, at 1040 (Bennett, C. J.,dissenting).1212 The dissent suggests that Lee's counsel decided not to put on the alibidefense promised in his opening statement because the prosecution's witnesses caused that planned defense to "collaps[e] altogether." See post,at 402. The record refutes that suggestion. Lee's counsel knew beforehe promised an alibi defense in his opening that the State planned to rebutit: The prosecutor's opening statement--given prior to defense counsel's--outlined the rebuttal witnesses' expected testimony. Tr. 178-187. Likewise, the prosecutor's statement that she "had in reserve other witnessesprepared to rebut the alibi testimony," post, at 403, was part of her opening statement, see Tr. 187. Furthermore, the alibi witnesses would haveknown of Lee's sentence in an unrelated case--a fact that the dissent suggests gave them "second thoughts" about testifying, post, at 403--a monthbefore they traveled to Missouri. Tr. 25-26.Utterly confounding are the dissent's depictions of "the realities oftrial," post, at 400, capped by the statement that "[b]efore any careful trialjudge granted a continuance in these circumstances, he or she would wanta representation that the movant believed the missing witnesses were stillprepared to offer the alibi testimony," post, at 403. Rule 24.10, the dissentinsists, if meticulously observed, would have produced the very thing thecourt "needed to grant the motion: an assurance that the defense witnesses were still prepared to offer material testimony." Post, at 400; seepost, at 403. No motion in the immediacy of the witnesses' sudden disappearance, however, could have provided assurance that they were stillprepared to offer material testimony. The "careful trial judge" does not534US2 Unit: $U19 [04-10-03 17:04:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN382 LEE v. KEMNAOpinion of the CourtSecond, no published Missouri decision directs flawlesscompliance with Rules 24.09 and 24.10 in the unique circumstances this case presents--the sudden, unanticipated, and atthe time unexplained disappearance of critical, subpoenaedwitnesses on what became the trial's last day.13 Lee's predicament, from all that appears, was one Missouri courts hadnot confronted before. "[A]lthough [the rules themselves]may not [have been] novel, . . . [their] application to the factshere was." Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396 U. S.229, 245 (1969) (Harlan, J., dissenting).Third and most important, given "the realities of trial,"post, at 400, Lee substantially complied with Missouri's keyRule. As to the "written motion" requirement, Missouri'sbrief in this Court asserted: "Nothing would have preventedcounsel from drafting a brief motion and affidavit complyingwith Rul[e] 24.09 in longhand while seated in the courtroom."demand the impossible. The witnesses' absence was unexplained, andcould not be explained on the afternoon of their disappearance. That iswhy an overnight continuance to locate the witnesses was so "very valuable to [Lee's] case." See supra, at 369.13 Missouri cites five cases as examples of the state courts' enforcementof Rules 24.09 and 24.10 (or their predecessors) "even in cases of exigency."Brief for Respondent 25-26. The five cases are: State v. Gadwood, 342Mo. 466, 479, 116 S. W. 2d 42, 49 (1937) (defendant's counsel knew, or shouldhave known, of likelihood of witnesses' inability to appear two days beforetrial); State v. Cuckovich, 485 S. W. 2d 16, 21 (Mo. 1972) (en banc) (defendant arrived at court on first day of trial with a letter from a doctor explaining that witness was ill); State v. Scott, 487 S. W. 2d 528, 530 (Mo. 1972)(absent witness was not subpoenaed); State v. Settle, 670 S. W. 2d 7, 13-14(Mo. App. 1984) (deficient application filed six days before trial); State v.Freeman, 702 S. W. 2d 869, 874 (Mo. App. 1985) (absent witness had toldofficer serving subpoena that she would not appear). All of these casesare readily distinguishable; none involved the sudden and unexplaineddisappearance of a subpoenaed witness in the midst of trial. The adequacy of a state ground, of course, does not depend on an appellate decision applying general rules to the precise facts of the case at bar. Buthere, no prior decision suggests strict application to a situation such asLee's.534US2 Unit: $U19 [04-10-03 17:04:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN383Cite as: 534 U. S. 362 (2002)Opinion of the CourtBrief for Respondent 30.14 At oral argument, however, Mis-souri's counsel edged away from this position. Counselstated: "I'm not going to stand on the formality . . . of awriting or even the formality of an affidavit." Tr. of OralArg. 48. This concession was well advised. Missouri doesnot rule out oral continuance motions; they are expresslyauthorized, upon consent of the adverse party, by Rule 24.09.And the written transcript of the brief trial court proceedings, see supra, at 367, enabled an appellate court to compre-hend the situation quickly. In sum, we are drawn to theconclusion reached by the Eighth Circuit dissenter: "[A]nyseasoned trial lawyer would agree" that insistence on a written continuance application, supported by an affidavit, "inthe midst of trial upon the discovery that subpoenaed witnesses are suddenly absent, would be so bizarre as to injectan Alice-in-Wonderland quality into the proceedings." 213F. 3d, at 1047.Regarding Rule 24.10, the only Rule raised on appeal bythe prosecution, see supra, at 371-372, the Missouri Court ofAppeals' decision was summary. Although that court didnot specify the particular components of the Rule neglectedby Lee, the State here stresses two: "Lee's counsel nevermentioned during his oral motion for continuance the testi-mony he expected the missing witnesses to give"; further,he "gave the trial court no reason to believe that the missingwitnesses could be located within a reasonable time." Brieffor Respondent 31.These matters, however, were either covered by the oralcontinuance motion or otherwise conspicuously apparent onthe record. The testimony that the alibi witnesses wereexpected to give had been previewed during voir dire atthe outset of the three-day trial, then detailed in defensecounsel's opening statement delivered just one day beforethe continuance motion. App. 10-13; seeOsborne, 495 U. S.,14 Missouri's brief did not address the requirement that the affidavit benotarized.534US2 Unit: $U19 [04-10-03 17:04:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN384 LEE v. KEMNAOpinion of the Courtat 123 (defense counsel's failure to object to jury charge didnot bar consideration of federal claim where counsel hadpressed the basic objection in a motion to dismiss made im-mediately before "brief " trial). Two of the prosecution'switnesses testified in part to anticipate and rebut the alibi.Tr. 443-487. An alibi instruction was apparently taken upat the charge conference held less than an hour before thetrial court denied the continuance motion. See supra, at368-369, n. 1. When defense counsel moved for a continuance, the judge asked a question indicating his recognitionthat alibi witness Gladys Edwards was Lee's mother. Seesupra, at 370, n. 2.Given the repeated references to the anticipated alibi witness testimony each day of trial, it is inconceivable that anyone in the courtroom harbored a doubt about what the witnesses had traveled from California to Missouri to say on thestand or why their testimony was material, indeed indispensable, to the defense. It was also evident that no witnessthen in the Kansas City vicinity could effectively substitutefor the family members with whom Lee allegedly stayed inVentura, California. See Rule 24.10(a) and (c) (movant shallshow "the materiality of the evidence sought," "[w]hat particular facts the affiant believes the witness will prove," andthat "no other person" available to the movant could "so fullyprove the same facts").Moreover, Lee showed "reasonable grounds for belief "that the continuance would serve its purpose. See Rule24.10(b). He said he knew the witnesses had not left KansasCity because they were to "ministe[r]" there the next twoevenings; he provided their local address; and he sought lessthan a day's continuance to enforce the subpoenas for theirattendance. App. 16-18.Concerning his "diligence . . . to obtain" the alibi testimony, see Rule 24.10(a), Lee and his counsel showed: thewitnesses had voluntarily traveled from California to appearat the trial; counsel had subpoenaed the witnesses when he534US2 Unit: $U19 [04-10-03 17:04:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN385Cite as: 534 U.

App. 16-18.Countering "procurement" of the witnesses' absence by thedefense, see Rule 24.10(d), Lee affirmed that he did not know"why they left" or "where they went," and asked for just"a couple hours' continuance [to] try to locate them." App.17-18.Rule 24.10, like other state and federal rules of its genre,serves a governmental interest of undoubted legitimacy. Itis designed to arm trial judges with the information neededto rule reliably on a motion to delay a scheduled criminaltrial. The Rule's essential requirements, however, weresubstantially met in this case. Few transcript pages needbe read to reveal the information called for by Rule 24.10."[N]othing would [have] be[en] gained by requiring" Lee'scounsel to recapitulate in (a), (b), (c), (d) order the showingsthe Rule requires. See Osborne, 495 U. S., at 124; cf. Staubv. City of Baxley, 355 U. S. 313, 319-320 (1958) (failure tochallenge "specific sections" of an ordinance not an adequatestate ground barring review of federal claim when partychallenged constitutionality of entire ordinance and all sections were "interdependent"). "Where it is inescapable thatthe defendant sought to invoke the substance of his federalright, the asserted state-law defect in form must be moreevident than it is here." James v. Kentucky, 466 U. S., at351.1515 The dissent, indulging in hyperbole, describes our narrow opinionas a "comb" and "searc[h]" order to lower courts. Post, at 395. We hold,simply and only, that Lee satisfied Rule 24.10's essential elements. Justas in Osborne, see supra, at 377-378, we place no burden on courts torummage through a ponderous trial transcript in search of an excuse fora defense counsel's lapse. The dissent, in this and much else, tilts at awindmill of its own invention.534US2 Unit: $U19 [04-10-03 17:04:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN386 LEE v. KEMNAOpinion of the CourtThe dissent critiques at great length Henry v. Mississippi,379 U. S. 443 (1965), a case on which we do not rely in reaching our decision.16 See post, at 393-395, 406. This pro-tracted exercise is a prime example of the dissent's vigorousattack on an imaginary opinion that bears scant, if any, re-semblance to the actual decision rendered today. We chartno new course. We merely apply Osborne's sound reasoningand limited holding to the circumstances of this case. If thedissent's shrill prediction that today's decision will disruptour federal system were accurate, we would have seen clearsignals of such disruption in the 11 years since Osborne.The absence of even dim distress signals demonstrates boththe tight contours of Osborne and the groundlessness ofthe dissent's frantic forecast of doom. SeeUnited Statesv. Travers, 514 F. 2d 1171, 1174 (CA2 1974) (Friendly, J.)("Cassandra-like predictions in dissent are not a sure guideto the breadth of the majority's ruling").It may be questioned, moreover, whether the dissent, putto the test, would fully embrace the unyielding theory thatit is never appropriate to evaluate the state interest in aprocedural rule against the circumstances of a particular16 Henry has been called "radical," post, at 393 (quoting R. Fallon, D.Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and theFederal System 584 (4th ed. 1996)), not for pursuing an "as applied" approach, as the dissent states, but for suggesting that the failure to complywith an anterior procedure was cured by compliance with some subsequent procedure. See id., at 584-585. In Henry, the Court indicatedthat although there was no contemporaneous objection at trial to the admission of evidence alleged to have been derived from an unconstitutionalsearch, a directed verdict motion made at the end of the prosecution's casewas an adequate substitute. 379 U. S., at 448-449. Nothing of the sortis involved in this case. Lee is not endeavoring to designate some latermotion, e. g., one for a new trial, as an adequate substitute for a continuance motion. The question here is whether the movant must enunciate again, when making the right motion at the right time, supportingstatements plainly and repeatedly made the days before. See supra, at367-368. On whether such repetition serves a legitimate state interest,Osborne, not Henry, controls.534US2 Unit: $U19 [04-10-03 17:04:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN387Cite as: 534 U. S. 362 (2002)Opinion of the Courtcase. See post, at 393-395. If that theory holds, it wouldmatter not at all why the witnesses left. Even if the evidence would show beyond doubt that the witnesses left because a court functionary told them to go, saying their testimony would not be needed until the next day, see supra, at373, n. 6, Lee would lose under the dissent's approach. Andthat result would be unaffected should it turn out that thefunctionary acted on the instigation of a prosecutor whoknew the judge would be at the hospital with his daughterthe next day. See supra, at 369. The particular application, never mind how egregious, would be ignored so long asthe Rule, like the mine run of procedural rules, generallyserves a legitimate state interest.To summarize, there was in this case no reference whatever in the trial court to Rules 24.09 and 24.10, the purportedprocedural impediments the Missouri Court of Appealslater pressed. Nor is there any indication that formallyperfect compliance with the Rules would have changedthe trial court's decision. Furthermore, no published Missouri decision demands unmodified application of the Rulesin the urgent situation Lee's case presented. Finally, thepurpose of the Rules was served by Lee's submissionsboth immediately before and at the short trial. Under thespecial circumstances so combined, we conclude that no adequate state-law ground hinders consideration of Lee's federal claim.17Because both the District Court and the Court of Appealsheld Lee's due process claim procedurally barred, neithercourt addressed it on the merits. We remand the case forthat purpose. See National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v.17 In view of this disposition, we do not reach further questions raisedby Lee, i. e., whether he has shown "cause" and "prejudice" to excuse anydefault, Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 90-91 (1977), or has made sufficient showing of "actual innocence" under Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S. 298,315 (1995), to warrant a hearing of the kind ordered in that case.534US2 Unit: $U19 [04-10-03 17:04:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN388 LEE v. KEMNAKennedy, J., dissentingSmith, 525 U.
