This case concerns properties in the city of Sherrill, NewYork, purchased by the Oneida Indian Nation of New York(OIN or Tribe) in 1997 and 1998. The separate parcels ofland in question, once contained within the Oneidas' 300,000-acre reservation, were last possessed by the Oneidas as atribal entity in 1805. For two centuries, governance of thearea in which the properties are located has been providedby the State of New York and its county and municipal units.In County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., 470U. S. 226 (1985)(Oneida II), this Court held that the Oneidasstated a triable claim for damages against the County ofOneida for wrongful possession of lands they conveyed toNew York State in 1795 in violation of federal law. In theinstant action, OIN resists the payment of property taxes toSherrill on the ground that OIN's acquisition of fee title todiscrete parcels of historic reservation land revived the Onei-das' ancient sovereignty piecemeal over each parcel. Consequently, the Tribe maintains, regulatory authority overOIN's newly purchased properties no longer resides inSherrill.Our 1985 decision recognized that the Oneidas could maintain a federal common-law claim for damages for ancientwrongdoing in which both national and state governmentswere complicit. Today, we decline to project redress for theTribe into the present and future, thereby disrupting thegovernance of central New York's counties and towns. Gen-erations have passed during which non-Indians have ownedand developed the area that once composed the Tribe's his-toric reservation. And at least since the middle years of the19th century, most of the Oneidas have resided elsewhere.Given the longstanding, distinctly non-Indian character ofthe area and its inhabitants, the regulatory authority con-stantly exercised by New York State and its counties andtowns, and the Oneidas' long delay in seeking judicial reliefagainst parties other than the United States, we hold that544US1 Unit: $U34 [11-02-07 18:07:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN203Cite as: 544 U.

S. C. $ 1331 or$ 1362, instituted a "test case" against the New York Counties of Oneida and Madison. They alleged that the cessionof 100,000 acres to New York State in 1795, see supra, at205, violated the Nonintercourse Act and thus did not terminate the Oneidas' right to possession under the applicablefederal treaties and statutes. In this initial endeavor togain compensation from governmental units other than theUnited States, the Oneidas confined their demand for relief.They sought only damages measured by the fair rental value,for the years 1968 and 1969, of 872 acres of their ancestralland owned and occupied by the two counties.

Id., at 93-95.This brings us to the present case, which concerns parcelsof land in the city of Sherrill, located in Oneida County, NewYork. According to the 2000 census, over 99% of the population in the area is non-Indian: American Indians representless than 1% of the city of Sherrill's population and less than0.5% of Oneida County's population.

OIN's predecessor, the Oneida Nation, had transferred the parcels atissue to one of its members in 1805, who sold the land to anon-Indian in 1807. The properties thereafter remained innon-Indian hands until OIN's acquisitions in 1997 and 1998in open-market transactions. See 337 F. 3d, at 144, n. 3.OIN now operates commercial enterprises on these parcels:a gasoline station, a convenience store, and a textile facility.Id., at 144.Because the parcels lie within the boundaries of the reservation originally occupied by the Oneidas, OIN maintainedthat the properties are exempt from taxation, and accordingly refused to pay the assessed property taxes. The cityof Sherrill initiated eviction proceedings in state court, andOIN sued Sherrill in federal court.

Moreover, the propertieshere involved have greatly increased in value since the Oneidas sold them 200 years ago. Notably, it was not until latelythat the Oneidas sought to regain ancient sovereignty overland converted from wilderness to become part of cities likeSherrill. See supra, at 210-212; Oneida II, 470 U. S., at264-265 (Stevens, J., dissenting in part).This Court has observed in the different, but related, context of the diminishment of an Indian reservation that "[t]helongstanding assumption of jurisdiction by the State over anarea that is over 90% non-Indian, both in population and inland use," may create "justifiable expectations."

Solem v. Bartlett, 465 U. S. 463,470 (1984); see also 18 U. S. C. $ 1151 (defining Indian country); South Dakota v. Yankton Sioux Tribe, 522 U. S. 329, 343 (1998) ("[O]nly Congresscan alter the terms of an Indian treaty by diminishing a reservation.").The Court need not decide today whether, contrary to the Second Circuit'sdetermination, the 1838 Treaty of Buffalo Creek disestablished the Oneidas' Reservation, as Sherrill argues. See Brief for Petitioner 31-39;Oneida II, 470 U. S., at 269, n. 24 (Stevens, J., dissenting in part) ("Thereis . . . a serious question whether the Oneida did not abandon their claimto the aboriginal lands in New York when they accepted the Treaty ofBuffalo Creek of 1838 . . . ."). The relief OIN seeks--recognition of present and future sovereign authority to remove the land from local taxation--is unavailable because of the long lapse of time, during which NewYork's governance remained undisturbed, and the present-day and futuredisruption such relief would engender.544US1 Unit: $U34 [11-02-07 18:07:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN216 CITY OF SHERRILL v. ONEIDA INDIAN NATION OF N. Y.Opinion of the Courttory jurisdiction, until recently uncontested by OIN, meritheavy weight here.10The wrongs of which OIN complains in this action occurred during the early years of the Republic. For the pasttwo centuries, New York and its county and municipal unitshave continuously governed the territory. The Oneidas didnot seek to regain possession of their aboriginal lands bycourt decree until the 1970's. See supra, at 210, n. 4. Andnot until the 1990's did OIN acquire the properties in question and assert its unification theory to ground its demandfor exemption of the parcels from local taxation. 337 F. 3d,at 144.11 This long lapse of time, during which the Oneidasdid not seek to revive their sovereign control through equitable relief in court, and the attendant dramatic changes in the10 Citing Montana v.

The Oneidas lastoccupied the parcels here at issue in 1805. See supra, at 211. The dissent additionally refers to Cass County v. Leech Lake Band of ChippewaIndians, 524 U. S. 103 (1998). Post, at 224, n. 3. But in that case, theCourt held that an Indian tribe could not revive the tax-exempt status ofits former reservation lands--which Congress had expressly removedfrom federal protection--by reacquiring the lands in the open market.524 U. S., at 113-114.11 The fact that OIN brought this action promptly after acquiring theproperties does not overcome the Oneidas' failure to reclaim ancient prerogatives earlier or lessen the problems associated with upsetting NewYork's long-exercised sovereignty over the area. OIN's claim concernsgrave, but ancient, wrongs, and the relief available must be commensuratewith that historical reality.544US1 Unit: $U34 [11-02-07 18:07:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN217Cite as: 544 U. S. 197 (2005)Opinion of the Courtcharacter of the properties, preclude OIN from gaining thedisruptive remedy it now seeks.The principle that the passage of time can preclude reliefhas deep roots in our law, and this Court has recognized thisprescription in various guises. It is well established thatlaches, a doctrine focused on one side's inaction and the other's legitimate reliance, may bar long-dormant claims for equitable relief. See, e. g., Badger v. Badger, 2 Wall. 87, 94(1865) ("[C]ourts of equity act upon their own inherent doctrine of discouraging, for the peace of society, antiquated de-mands, refuse to interfere where there has been gross lachesin prosecuting the claim, or long acquiescence in the assertion of adverse rights." (internal quotation marks omitted));Wagner v. Baird, 7 How. 234, 258 (1849) (same); Bowman v.Wathen, 1 How. 189, 194 (1843) ("[The] doctrine of an equitable bar by lapse of time, so distinctly announced by the chancellors of England and Ireland, . . . should now be regardedas settled law in this court.").This Court applied the doctrine of laches in Felix v. Patrick, 145 U. S. 317 (1892), to bar the heirs of an Indian fromestablishing a constructive trust over land their Indian ancestor had conveyed in violation of a statutory restriction.In the nearly three decades between the conveyance and thelawsuit, "[a] large part of the tract ha[d] been platted andrecorded as an addition to the city of Omaha, and . . . sold topurchasers." Id., at 326. "[A]s the case stands at present,"the Court observed, "justice requires only what the law . . .would demand--the repayment of the value of the [illegallyconveyed] scrip." Id., at 334. The Court also recognizedthe disproportion between the value of the scrip issued tothe Indian ($150) and the value of the property the heirssought to acquire (over $1 million). Id., at 333. The sort ofchanges to the value and character of the land noted by theFelix Court are present in even greater magnitude in thissuit. Cf. Galliher v. Cadwell, 145 U. S. 368, 373 (1892)("[L]aches is not . . . a mere matter of time; but principally544US1 Unit: $U34 [11-02-07 18:07:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN218 CITY OF SHERRILL v. ONEIDA INDIAN NATION OF N. Y.Opinion of the Courta question of the inequity of permitting the claim to be en-forced--an inequity founded upon some change in the condition or relations of the property or the parties.").As between States, long acquiescence may have controlling effect on the exercise of dominion and sovereignty overterritory. Ohio v. Kentucky, 410 U. S. 641, 651 (1973) ("Therule, long-settled and never doubted by this court, is thatlong acquiescence by one state in the possession of territoryby another and in the exercise of sovereignty and dominionover it is conclusive of the latter's title and rightful authority." (quoting Michigan v. Wisconsin, 270 U. S. 295, 308(1926)));Massachusetts v. New York, 271 U. S. 65, 95 (1926)("Long acquiescence in the possession of territory and theexercise of dominion and sovereignty over it may have a con-trolling effect in the determination of a disputed boundary.").The acquiescence doctrine does not depend on the originalvalidity of a boundary line; rather, it attaches legal consequences to acquiescence in the observance of the boundary.California v. Nevada, 447 U. S. 125, 131 (1980) (No relation-ship need exist "between the origins of a boundary and thelegal consequences of acquiescence in that boundary. . . .Longstanding acquiescence by California and Nevada cangive [the boundary lines] the force of law whether or notfederal authorities had the power to draw them.").This Court's original-jurisdiction state-sovereignty casesdo not dictate a result here, but they provide a helpful pointof reference: When a party belatedly asserts a right to pres-ent and future sovereign control over territory,12 longstanding observances and settled expectations are prime consider-ations. There is no dispute that it has been two centuriessince the Oneidas last exercised regulatory control over theproperties here or held them free from local taxation.12 It bears repetition that for generations, the Oneidas dominantly complained, not against New York or its local units, but about "[mis]treatmentat the hands of the United States Government." Oneida II, 470 U. S., at269 (Stevens, J., dissenting in part); see supra, at 207-208.544US1 Unit: $U34 [11-02-07 18:07:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN219Cite as: 544 U.

Oneida II, 470 U. S., at 262(Stevens, J., dissenting in part).Finally, this Court has recognized the impracticability ofreturning to Indian control land that generations earlierpassed into numerous private hands. See Yankton SiouxTribe v. United States, 272 U. S. 351, 357 (1926) ("It is impos-sible . . . to rescind the cession and restore the Indians totheir former rights because the lands have been opened tosettlement and large portions of them are now in the possession of innumerable innocent purchasers . . . ."); Felix, 145U. S., at 334 (observing, in declining to award equitable relief, "[t]hat which was wild land thirty years ago is now intersected by streets, subdivided into blocks and lots, and largelyoccupied by persons who have bought upon the strength ofPatrick's title, and have erected buildings of a permanentcharacter"). The District Court, in the litigation dormantduring the pendency of Oneida II, see supra, at 209-211,rightly found these pragmatic concerns about restoring Indian sovereign control over land "magnified exponentiallyhere, where development of every type imaginable has beenongoing for more than two centuries." Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., 199 F. R. D., at 92.In this case, the Court of Appeals concluded that the "impossibility" doctrine had no application because OIN acquired the land in the open market and does not seek touproot current property owners. 337 F. 3d, at 157. But theunilateral reestablishment of present and future Indian sovereign control, even over land purchased at the market price,would have disruptive practical consequences similar tothose that led this Court in Yankton Sioux to initiate theimpossibility doctrine. The city of Sherrill and OneidaCounty are today overwhelmingly populated by non-Indians.See supra, at 211.

S., at 421 (quoting Solem v. Bartlett, 465 U. S. 463,471-472, n. 12 (1984)). If OIN may unilaterally reassert sov-ereign control and remove these parcels from the local taxrolls, little would prevent the Tribe from initiating a newgeneration of litigation to free the parcels from local zoningor other regulatory controls that protect all landowners inthe area. SeeFelix, 145 U. S., at 335 ("decree prayed for inthis case, if granted, would offer a distinct encouragement to. . . similar claims"); cf. Brendale v. Confederated Tribes andBands of Yakima Nation, 492 U. S. 408, 433-437 (1989) (opinion of Stevens, J.) (discussing tribal land-use controls); post,at 226, n. 6 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (noting that "the balanceof interests" supports continued state zoning jurisdiction).13Recognizing these practical concerns, Congress has pro-vided a mechanism for the acquisition of lands for tribal communities that takes account of the interests of others withstakes in the area's governance and well-being. Title 25U. S. C. $ 465 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to ac-quire land in trust for Indians and provides that the land"shall be exempt from State and local taxation." See CassCounty v. Leech Lake Band of Chippewa Indians, 524 U. S.103, 114-115 (1998). The regulations implementing $ 465 aresensitive to the complex interjurisdictional concerns thatarise when a tribe seeks to regain sovereign control over13 Other tribal entities have already sought to free historic reservation lands purchased in the open market from local regulatory controls.See Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Okla. v.

S. 197 (2005)Opinion of the Courtterritory. Before approving an acquisition, the Secretarymust consider, among other things, the tribe's need for additional land; "[t]he purposes for which the land will be used";"the impact on the State and its political subdivisions resulting from the removal of the land from the tax rolls"; and"[ j]urisdictional problems and potential conflicts of land usewhich may arise." 25 CFR $ 151.10(f ) (2004). Section 465provides the proper avenue for OIN to reestablish sovereign authority over territory last held by the Oneidas 200years ago.In sum, the question of damages for the Tribe's ancientdispossession is not at issue in this case, and we therefore donot disturb our holding in Oneida II. However, the distancefrom 1805 to the present day, the Oneidas' long delay in seeking equitable relief against New York or its local units, anddevelopments in the city of Sherrill spanning several generations, evoke the doctrines of laches, acquiescence, andimpossibility, and render inequitable the piecemeal shift ingovernance this suit seeks unilaterally to initiate.14* * *For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Ap-peals for the Second Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
