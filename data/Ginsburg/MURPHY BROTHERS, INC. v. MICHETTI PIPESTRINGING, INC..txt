This case concerns the time within which a defendantnamed in a state-court action may remove the action toa federal court. The governing provision is 28 U. S. C.$ 1446(b), which specifies, in relevant part, that the removalnotice "shall be filed within thirty days after the receipt bythe defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of the[complaint]." The question presented is whether the nameddefendant must be officially summoned to appear in the action before the time to remove begins to run. Or, may the30-day period start earlier, on the named defendant's receipt,before service of official process, of a "courtesy copy" of thefiled complaint faxed by counsel for the plaintiff?We read Congress' provisions for removal in light of a bed-rock principle: An individual or entity named as a defendantis not obliged to engage in litigation unless notified of theaction, and brought under a court's authority, by formal process. Accordingly, we hold that a named defendant's time to*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the United Statesby Solicitor General Waxman, Assistant Attorney General Hunger, Deputy Solicitor General Wallace, Kent L.

MICHETTI PIPESTRINGING, INC.Opinion of the Courtremove is triggered by simultaneous service of the summonsand complaint, or receipt of the complaint, "through serviceor otherwise," after and apart from service of the summons,but not by mere receipt of the complaint unattended by anyformal service. IOn January 26, 1996, respondent Michetti Pipe Stringing,Inc. (Michetti), filed a complaint in Alabama state court seeking damages for an alleged breach of contract and fraud bypetitioner Murphy Bros., Inc. (Murphy). Michetti did notserve Murphy at that time, but three days later it faxed a"courtesy copy" of the file-stamped complaint to one of Murphy's vice presidents. The parties then engaged in settle-ment discussions until February 12, 1996, when Michetti officially served Murphy under local law by certified mail.On March 13, 1996 (30 days after service but 44 days afterreceiving the faxed copy of the complaint), Murphy removedthe case under 28 U. S. C. $ 1441 to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.1 Michettimoved to remand the case to the state court on the groundthat Murphy filed the removal notice 14 days too late. Thenotice of removal had not been filed within 30 days of thedate on which Murphy's vice president received the facsimiletransmission. Consequently, Michetti asserted, the removalwas untimely under 28 U. S. C. $ 1446(b), which provides:"The notice of removal of a civil action or proceedingshall be filed within thirty days after the receipt by thedefendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of theinitial pleading setting forth the claim for relief uponwhich such action or proceeding is based, or withinthirty days after the service of summons upon the de1 Murphy invoked the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court under28 U.

S. 344 (1999)Opinion of the Courtfendant if such initial pleading has then been filed incourt and is not required to be served on the defendant,whichever period is shorter." (Emphasis added.)The District Court denied the remand motion on the groundthat the 30-day removal period did not commence until Murphy was officially served with a summons. The court ob-served that the phrase "or otherwise" was added to $ 1446(b)in 1949 to govern removal in States where an action is com-menced merely by the service of a summons, without anyrequirement that the complaint be served or even filed con-temporaneously. See App. A-24. Accordingly, the DistrictCourt said, the phrase had "no field of operation" in Statessuch as Alabama, where the complaint must be served alongwith the summons. See ibid.On interlocutory appeal permitted pursuant to 28 U. S. C.$ 1292(b), the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit re-versed and remanded, instructing the District Court to remand the action to state court. 125 F. 3d 1396, 1399 (1997).The Eleventh Circuit held that "the clock starts to tick uponthe defendant's receipt of a copy of the filed initial pleading."Id., at 1397. "By and large," the appellate court wrote, "ouranalysis begins and ends with" the words "receipt . . . orotherwise." Id., at 1397-1398 (emphasis deleted). Becauselower courts have divided on the question whether serviceof process is a prerequisite for the running of the 30-dayremoval period under $ 1446(b),2 we granted certiorari. 525U. S. 960 (1998).2 Compare Reece v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 98 F. 3d 839, 841 (CA5 1996)(removal period begins with receipt of a copy of the initial pleadingthrough any means, not just service of process); Roe v. O'Donohue, 38F. 3d 298, 303 (CA7 1994) ("Once the defendant possesses a copy of thecomplaint, it must decide promptly in which court it wants to proceed."),with Bowman v. Weeks Marine, Inc., 936 F. Supp. 329, 333 (SC 1996)(removal period begins only upon proper service of process); Baratt v.Phoenix Mut. Life Ins. Co., 787 F. Supp. 333, 336 (WDNY 1992) (properservice is a prerequisite to commencement of removal period).526US2 Unit: $U46 [10-12-99 18:59:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN350 MURPHY BROTHERS, INC. v. MICHETTI PIPESTRINGING, INC.Opinion of the CourtIIService of process, under longstanding tradition in our sys-tem of justice, is fundamental to any procedural impositionon a named defendant. At common law, the writ of capiasad respondendum directed the sheriff to secure the de-fendant's appearance by taking him into custody. See 1 J.Moore, Moore's Federal Practice || 0.6[2.-2], p. 212 (2d ed.1996) ("[T]he three royal courts, Exchequer, Common Pleas,and King's Bench . . . obtained an in personam jurisdictionover the defendant in the same manner through the writ ofcapias ad respondendum."). The requirement that a de-fendant be brought into litigation by official service is thecontemporary counterpart to that writ. See InternationalShoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310, 316 (1945) ("[T]hecapias ad respondendum has given way to personal serviceof summons or other form of notice.").In the absence of service of process (or waiver of serviceby the defendant), a court ordinarily may not exercise powerover a party the complaint names as defendant. SeeOmniCapital Int'l, Ltd. v. Rudolf Wolff & Co., 484 U. S. 97, 104(1987) ("Before a . . . court may exercise personal jurisdictionover a defendant, the procedural requirement of service ofsummons must be satisfied."); Mississippi Publishing Corp.v.Murphree, 326 U. S. 438, 444-445 (1946) ("[S]ervice of sum-mons is the procedure by which a court . . . asserts jurisdiction over the person of the party served."). Accordingly,one becomes a party officially, and is required to take actionin that capacity, only upon service of a summons or otherauthority-asserting measure stating the time within whichthe party served must appear and defend. See Fed. RuleCiv. Proc. 4(a) ("[The summons] shall . . . state the timewithin which the defendant must appear and defend, and notify the defendant that failure to do so will result in a judg-ment by default against the defendant."); Rule 12(a)(1)(A) (adefendant shall serve an answer within 20 days of being526US2 Unit: $U46 [10-12-99 18:59:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN351Cite as: 526 U. S. 344 (1999)Opinion of the Courtserved with the summons and complaint). Unless a nameddefendant agrees to waive service, the summons continuesto function as the sine qua non directing an individual orentity to participate in a civil action or forgo procedural orsubstantive rights. IIIWhen Congress enacted $ 1446(b), the legislators did notendeavor to break away from the traditional understanding.Prior to 1948, a defendant could remove a case any time be-fore the expiration of her time to respond to the complaintunder state law. See, e. g., 28 U. S. C. $ 72 (1940 ed.). Be-cause the time limits for responding to the complaint variedfrom State to State, however, the period for removal corre-spondingly varied. To reduce the disparity, Congress in1948 enacted the original version of $ 1446(b), which providedthat "[t]he petition for removal of a civil action or proceedingmay be filed within twenty days after commencement ofthe action or service of process, whichever is later." Act ofJune 25, 1948, 62 Stat. 939, as amended, 28 U. S. C. $ 1446(b).According to the relevant House Report, this provision wasintended to "give adequate time and operate uniformlythroughout the Federal jurisdiction." H. R. Rep. No. 308,80th Cong., 1st Sess., A135 (1947).Congress soon recognized, however, that $ 1446(b), as firstframed, did not "give adequate time and operate uniformly"in all States. In States such as New York, most notably,service of the summons commenced the action, and suchservice could precede the filing of the complaint. Under$ 1446(b) as originally enacted, the period for removal in sucha State could have expired before the defendant obtainedaccess to the complaint.To ensure that the defendant would have access to thecomplaint before commencement of the removal period, Con-gress in 1949 enacted the current version of $ 1446(b): "Thepetition for removal of a civil action or proceeding shall be526US2 Unit: $U46 [10-12-99 18:59:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN352 MURPHY BROTHERS, INC. v. MICHETTI PIPESTRINGING, INC.Opinion of the Courtfiled within twenty days [now thirty days] 3 after the receiptby the defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy ofthe initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief uponwhich such action or proceeding is based." Act of May 24,1949, $ 83(a), 63 Stat. 101. The accompanying Senate Re-port explained:"In some States suits are begun by the service of a sum-mons or other process without the necessity of filing anypleading until later. As the section now stands, thisplaces the defendant in the position of having to takesteps to remove a suit to Federal court before he knowswhat the suit is about. As said section is herein proposed to be rewritten, a defendant is not required to filehis petition for removal until 20 days after he has received (or it has been made available to him) a copy ofthe initial pleading filed by the plaintiff setting forth theclaim upon which the suit is based and the relief prayedfor. It is believed that this will meet the varying conditions of practice in all the States." S. Rep. No. 303, 81stCong., 1st Sess., 6 (1949).See also H. R. Rep. No. 352, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 14 (1949)("The first paragraph of the amendment to subsection (b)corrects [the New York problem] by providing that thepetition for removal need not be filed until 20 days afterthe defendant has received a copy of the plaintiff 's initialpleading.").4 Nothing in the legislative history of the 19493 Congress extended the period for removal from 20 days to 30 days in1965. See Act of Sept. 29, 1965, 79 Stat. 887.4 The second half of the revised $ 1446(b), providing that the petition forremoval shall be filed "within twenty days after the service of summonsupon the defendant if such initial pleading has then been filed in courtand is not required to be served on the defendant, whichever period isshorter," $ 83(b), 63 Stat. 101, was added to address the situation in Statessuch as Kentucky, which required the complaint to be filed at the time thesummons issued, but did not require service of the complaint along withthe summons. See H. R. Rep. No. 352, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 14 (1949)526US2 Unit: $U46 [10-12-99 18:59:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN353Cite as: 526 U. S. 344 (1999)Opinion of the Courtamendment so much as hints that Congress, in makingchanges to accommodate atypical state commencement andcomplaint filing procedures, intended to dispense with thehistoric function of service of process as the official triggerfor responsive action by an individual or entity nameddefendant.5IVThe Eleventh Circuit relied on the "plain meaning" of$ 1446(b) that the panel perceived. See 125 F. 3d, at 1398.In the Eleventh Circuit's view, because the term " `[r]eceipt'is the nominal form of `receive,' which means broadly `tocome into possession of ' or to `acquire,' " the phrase " `[re-ceipt] through service or otherwise' opens a universe ofmeans besides service for putting the defendant in pos-session of the complaint." Ibid. What are the dimensionsof that "universe"? The Eleventh Circuit's opinion is unin-formative. Nor can one tenably maintain that the words"or otherwise" provide a clue. Cf. Potter v. McCauley,186 F. Supp. 146, 149 (Md. 1960) ("It is not possible to statedefinitely in general terms the precise scope and effectof the word `otherwise' in its context here because its properapplication in particular situations will vary with state pro-cedural requirements.");Apache Nitrogen Products, Inc. v.("Th[e first clause of revised $ 1446(b)], however, without more, wouldcreate further difficulty in those States, such as Kentucky, where suit iscommenced by the filing of the plaintiff's initial pleading and the issuance and service of a summons without any requirement that a copy ofthe pleading be served upon or otherwise furnished to the defendant. Accordingly . . . the amendment provides that in such cases the petition forremoval shall be filed within 20 days after the service of the summons.").5 It is evident, too, that Congress could not have foreseen the situationposed by this case, for, as the District Court recognized, "[i]n 1949 Congress did not anticipate use of facsmile [sic] transmissions." App. A-23,n. 1. Indeed, even the photocopy machine was not yet on the sceneat that time. See 9 New Encyclopaedia Britannica 400 (15th ed. 1985)(noting that photocopiers "did not become available for commercial useuntil 1950").526US2 Unit: $U46 [10-12-99 18:59:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN354 MURPHY BROTHERS, INC. v. MICHETTI PIPESTRINGING, INC.Opinion of the CourtHarbor Ins. Co., 145 F. R. D. 674, 679 (Ariz. 1993) ("[I]fin fact the words `service or otherwise' had a plain meaning,the cases would not be so hopelessly split over their properinterpretation.").The interpretation of $ 1446(b) adopted here adheres totradition, makes sense of the phrase "or otherwise," and assures defendants adequate time to decide whether to removean action to federal court. As the court inPotter observed,the various state provisions for service of the summons andthe filing or service of the complaint fit into one or anotherof four main categories. See 186 F. Supp., at 149. In eachof the four categories, the defendant's period for removal willbe no less than 30 days from service, and in some categories,it will be more than 30 days from service, depending on whenthe complaint is received.As summarized in Potter, the possibilities are as follows.First, if the summons and complaint are served together, the30-day period for removal runs at once. Second, if the de-fendant is served with the summons but the complaint isfurnished to the defendant sometime after, the period forremoval runs from the defendant's receipt of the complaint.Third, if the defendant is served with the summons and thecomplaint is filed in court, but under local rules, service ofthe complaint is not required, the removal period runs fromthe date the complaint is made available through filing. Finally, if the complaint is filed in court prior to any service,the removal period runs from the service of the summons.Seeibid.Notably, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 81(c), amendedin 1949, uses the identical "receipt through service or otherwise" language in specifying the time the defendant has toanswer the complaint once the case has been removed:"In a removed action in which the defendant has notanswered, the defendant shall answer or present theother defenses or objections available under these rules526US2 Unit: $U46 [10-12-99 18:59:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN355Cite as: 526 U. S. 344 (1999)Opinion of the Courtwithin 20 days after the receipt through service or oth-erwise of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth theclaim for relief upon which the action or proceeding isbased."Rule 81(c) sensibly has been interpreted to afford the defend-ant at least 20 days after service of process to respond. SeeSilva v. Madison, 69 F. 3d 1368, 1376-1377 (CA7 1995). InSilva, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals observed that"nothing . . . would justify our concluding that the drafters,in their quest for evenhandedness and promptness in the removal process, intended to abrogate the necessity for some-thing as fundamental as service of process."Id., at 1376.In reaching this conclusion, the court distinguished an earlier decision, Roe v. O'Donohue, 38 F. 3d 298 (CA7 1994),which held that a defendant need not receive service of process before his time for removal under $ 1446(b) begins to run.See 69 F. 3d, at 1376. But, as the United States maintains inits amicus curiae brief, the Silva court "did not adequatelyexplain why one who has not yet lawfully been made a partyto an action should be required to decide in which court sys-tem the case should be heard." Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae 13, n. 4. If, as the Seventh Circuit rightlydetermined, the "service or otherwise" language was not intended to abrogate the service requirement for purposes ofRule 81(c), that same language also was not intended to bypass service as a starter for $ 1446(b)'s clock. The fact thatthe Seventh Circuit could read the phrase "or otherwise"differently in Silva and Roe, moreover, undercuts the Elev-enth Circuit's position that the phrase has an inevitably"plain meaning." 66 Contrary to a suggestion made at oral argument, see Tr. of Oral Arg.6-7, 28 U. S. C. $ 1448 does not support the Eleventh Circuit's position.That section provides that "[i]n all cases removed from any State court toany district court of the United States in which any one or more of thedefendants has not been served with process or in which the service has526US2 Unit: $U46 [10-12-99 18:59:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN356 MURPHY BROTHERS, INC. v. MICHETTI PIPESTRINGING, INC.Opinion of the CourtFurthermore, the so-called "receipt rule"--starting thetime to remove on receipt of a copy of the complaint, however informally, despite the absence of any formal service--could, as the District Court recognized, operate with notableunfairness to individuals and entities in foreign nations.See App. A-24. Because facsimile machines transmit instantaneously, but formal service abroad may take muchlonger than 30 days,7 plaintiffs "would be able to dodge therequirements of international treaties and trap foreign oppo-nents into keeping their suits in state courts."Ibid.* * *In sum, it would take a clearer statement than Congresshas made to read its endeavor to extend removal time (byadding receipt of the complaint) to effect so strange achange--to set removal apart from all other responsive acts,to render removal the sole instance in which one's proceduralrights slip away before service of a summons,i. e., beforeone is subject to any court's authority. Accordingly, for thereasons stated in this opinion, the judgment of the UnitedStates Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistentwith this opinion.
