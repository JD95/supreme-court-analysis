In so holding, we adhere to settled law: when Congress does not instruct otherwise, a State's excise tax is un-enforceable if its legal incidence falls on a Tribe or its members for sales made within Indian country. We further hold,however, that Oklahoma may tax the income (includingwages from tribal employment) of all persons, Indian andnon-Indian alike, residing in the State outside Indian country. The Treaty between the United States and the Tribe,which guarantees the Tribe and its members that "no Territory or State shall ever have a right to pass laws for thegovernment of " the Chickasaw Nation, does not displace therule, accepted interstate and internationally, that a sover-eign may tax the entire income of its residents.IThe Chickasaw Nation, a federally recognized IndianTribe, commenced this civil action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma, to stop theState of Oklahoma from enforcing several state taxes againstthe Tribe and its members.3 Pertinent here, the DistrictComm'n v. Citizen Band of Potawatomi Tribe of Okla., 498 U. S. 505(1991).2 "Indian country," as Congress comprehends that term, see 18 U. S. C.$ 1151, includes "formal and informal reservations, dependent Indian communities, and Indian allotments, whether restricted or held in trust by theUnited States." Sac and Fox, 508 U. S., at 123.3 In addition to the motor fuels and income taxes before us, the Tribe'scomplaint challenged motor vehicle excise taxes on Tribe-owned vehicles,retail sales taxes on certain purchases by the Tribe for its own use, and515us2$79P 08-12-98 16:54:24 PAGES OPINPGT454 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. CHICKASAW NATIONOpinion of the CourtCourt, ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment, heldfor the State on the motor fuels tax imposition and largelyfor the Tribe on the income tax issue. The Court of Appealsfor the Tenth Circuit ruled for the Tribe and its members onboth issues: It held that the State may not apply the motorfuels tax to fuel sold by the Tribe's retail stores, and, further,that the State may not tax the wages of members of theChickasaw Nation who work for the Tribe, even if they reside outside Indian country. 31 F. 3d 964 (1994).Concerning the motor fuels tax, the Tenth Circuit disapproved the District Court's "balancing of the respectivetribal and state interests" approach.Id., at 972. The legalincidence of the tax, the Court of Appeals ruled, is the keyconcept. That incidence, the Tenth Circuit determined, fallsdirectly on fuel retailers--here, on the Tribe, due to its operation of two convenience stores that sell fuel to tribal mem-bers and other persons. Oklahoma's imposition of its fuelstax on the Tribe as retailer, the Court of Appeals concluded,"conflicts with . . . the traditional scope of Indian sovereignauthority." Ibid. Because the State asserted no congres-sional authorization for its exaction, the Tenth Circuit declared the fuels tax preempted.Oklahoma's income tax, in the Court of Appeals' view,could not be applied to any tribal member employed by theTribe;4 residence, the Tenth Circuit said, was "simply notrelevant to [its] determination." Id., at 979. The Court ofAppeals relied on the provision of the Treaty of Dancingsales taxes on 3.2% beer sold at the Tribe's two convenience stores, as wellas tax warrants issued against officers of the Tribe. In the course oflitigation, Oklahoma apparently decided not to contest the Tribe's claimsregarding the vehicle and retail sales taxes, and withdrew the warrants;the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed theDistrict Court's grant of summary judgment for the State on the 3.2%beer tax, and the Tribe has not sought our review of that issue.4 In a ruling not before us, see Brief for Respondent 47, the Court ofAppeals upheld application of Oklahoma's income tax to Chickasaw Nationemployees who are not members of the Tribe.515us2$79P 08-12-98 16:54:24 PAGES OPINPGT455Cite as: 515 U.

IV, 7 Stat. 333-334, that"no Territory or State shall ever have a right to pass lawsfor the government of the [Chickasaw] Nation of Red Peopleand their descendants." To this treaty language, the TenthCircuit applied "the general rule that `[d]oubtful expressionsare to be resolved in favor of ' the Indians." 31 F. 3d, at 978(quoting McClanahan v. Arizona Tax Comm'n, 411 U. S.164, 174 (1973)). The Court of Appeals also noted that ithad endeavored to "rea[d] the treaty as the Indians [whosigned it] would have understood it." 31 F. 3d, at 979.We granted the State's petition for certiorari, 513 U. S.1071 (1995), and now (1) affirm the Court of Appeals' judgment as to the motor fuels tax, and (2) reverse that judgmentas to the income tax applied to earnings of tribal memberswho work for the Tribe but reside in the State outside In-dian country.IIThe Tribe contends, and the Tenth Circuit held, that Okla-homa's fuels tax5 is levied on retailers, not on distributorsor consumers. The respect due to the Chickasaw Nation'ssovereignty, the Tribe maintains, means Oklahoma--absentcongressional permission--may not collect its tax for fuelsupplied to, and sold by, the Tribe at its conveniencestores. In support of the tax immunity it asserts, the Triberecalls our reaffirmations to this effect: "The Constitutionvests the Federal Government with exclusive authority overrelations with Indian tribes . . . , and in recognition of thesovereignty retained by Indian tribes even after formationof the United States, Indian tribes and individuals generallyare exempt from state taxation within their own territory."Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe, 471 U.

CHICKASAW NATIONOpinion of the Courtalso, e. g., Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U. S. 145,148 (1973).In response, Oklahoma urges that Indian tribes and theirmembers are not inevitably, but only " `generally,' " immunefrom state taxation. Brief for Petitioner 19 (quoting Blackfeet Tribe, 471 U. S., at 764). At least as to some aspects ofstate taxation, Oklahoma asserts, an approach "balancing thestate and tribal interests" is in order. Brief for Petitioner17. Even if the legal incidence of the fuels tax falls on theTribe (as retailer), Oklahoma concludes, tax immunity shouldbe disallowed here because "the state interest supportingthe levy is compelling, . . . the tribal interest is insubstantial, and . . . the state tax would have no effect on `tribalgovernance and self-determination.' " Id., at 22 (emphasisin original).In the alternative, Oklahoma argues that the Court of Appeals "erred in holding that the legal incidence of the fueltax falls on the retailer." Id., at 10. Moreover, the Statenewly contends, even if the fuels tax otherwise would beimpermissible, Congress, in the 1936 Hayden-CartwrightAct, 4 U. S. C. $ 104, expressly permitted state taxation ofreservation activity of this type. Brief for Petitioner 23-24.We set out first our reason for refusing to entertain at thislate date Oklahoma's argument that the Hayden-CartwrightAct expressly permits state levies on motor fuels sold onIndian reservations. We then explain why we agree withthe Tenth Circuit on the Tribe's exemption from Oklahoma'sfuels tax.AOn brief, the State points out--for the first time in thislitigation--that the Hayden-Cartwright Act, 4 U. S. C. $ 104,expressly authorizes States to tax motor fuel sales on"United States military or other reservations." $ 104(a).The Act's word "reservations," Oklahoma maintains, encom-passes Indian reservations.

S. 450 (1995)Opinion of the CourtThe State made no reference to the Hayden-Cartwright Actin the courts of first and second instance. And even thoughthe Court of Appeals flagged the Act's possible relevance,6Oklahoma did not mention this 1936 legislation in its petitionfor certiorari. Nor is Oklahoma's newly discovered claim ofvintage legislative authorization "fairly included"7 in thequestion the State tendered for our review: "Whether princi-ples of federal pre-emption or Indian sovereignty preclude aState from imposing a tax on motor fuel sold by an Indiantribe . . . . ?" Pet. for Cert. (i). As a court of review, notone of first view, we will entertain issues withheld until mer-its briefing " `only in the most exceptional cases.' "Yee v.Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 535 (1992) (citation omitted). Thiscase does not fit that bill. BAssuming, then, that Congress has not expressly author-ized the imposition of Oklahoma's fuels tax on fuel sold by theTribe, we must decide if the State's exaction is nonethelesspermitted. Oklahoma asks us to make the determination byweighing the relevant state and tribal interests, and urgesthat the balance tilts in its favor. Oklahoma emphasizesthat the fuel sold is used "almost exclusively on state roads,"imposing "very substantial costs on the State--but no burden at all on the Tribe." Brief for Petitioner 9. The State6 The Court of Appeals noted:"In White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U. S. 136, 151, n. 16 . . .(1980), the Supreme Court declined to reach the question whether Indianreservations might be encompassed by the Hayden-Cartwright Act, 4U. S. C. $ 104, which provides for the imposition of state fuel taxes `onUnited States military or other reservations.' This issue was not raisedbefore this court, and we express no opinion on it." 31 F. 3d 964, 972,n. 4 (1994).7 This Court's Rule 14.1(a); see Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 533(1992). Cf. Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513U. S. 374, 379-380 (1995) (reaching issue addressed in decision underreview and "fairly embraced within" both the question set forth in thepetition for certiorari and the argument advanced in the petition).515us2$79P 08-12-98 16:54:24 PAGES OPINPGT458 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. CHICKASAW NATIONOpinion of the Courtalso stresses that "the levy does not reach any value gener-ated by the Tribe on Indian land,"id., at 10; i. e., the fuel isnot produced or refined in Indian country, and is often soldto outsiders.We have balanced federal, state, and tribal interests in diverse contexts, notably, in assessing state regulation thatdoes not involve taxation, see,e. g., California v. CabazonBand of Mission Indians, 480 U. S. 202, 216-217 (1987) (bal-ancing interests affected by State's attempt to regulate onreservation high-stakes bingo operation), and state attemptsto compel Indians to collect and remit taxes actually imposedon non-Indians, see, e. g., Moe v. Confederated Salish andKootenai Tribes of Flathead Reservation, 425 U. S. 463, 483(1976) (balancing interests affected by State's attempt to require tribal sellers to collect cigarette tax on non-Indians;precedent about state taxation of Indians is not controllingbecause "this [collection] burden is not, strictly speaking, atax at all").But when a State attempts to levy a tax directly on anIndian tribe or its members inside Indian country, ratherthan on non-Indians, we have employed, instead of a balancing inquiry, "a more categorical approach: `[A]bsent cessionof jurisdiction or other federal statutes permitting it,' wehave held, a State is without power to tax reservation landsand reservation Indians." County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 502 U. S. 251, 258(1992) (citation omitted). Taking this categorical approach,we have held unenforceable a number of state taxes whoselegal incidence rested on a tribe or on tribal members insideIndian country. See, e. g., Bryan v. Itasca County, 426 U. S.373 (1976) (tax on Indian-owned personal property situatedin Indian country); McClanahan, 411 U. S., at 165-166 (taxon income earned on reservation by tribal members residingon reservation).The initial and frequently dispositive question in Indiantax cases, therefore, is who bears the legal incidence of a tax.515us2$79P 08-12-98 16:54:24 PAGES OPINPGT459Cite as: 515 U. S. 450 (1995)Opinion of the CourtIf the legal incidence of an excise tax rests on a tribe or ontribal members for sales made inside Indian country, the taxcannot be enforced absent clear congressional authorization.See, e. g., Moe, 425 U. S., at 475-481 (Montana's cigarettesales tax imposed on retail consumers could not be appliedto on-reservation "smoke shop" sales to tribal members).But if the legal incidence of the tax rests on non-Indians, nocategorical bar prevents enforcement of the tax; if the balance of federal, state, and tribal interests favors the State,and federal law is not to the contrary, the State may imposeits levy, see Washington v. Confederated Tribes of ColvilleReservation, 447 U. S. 134, 154-157 (1980), and may place ona tribe or tribal members "minimal burdens" in collectingthe toll, Department of Taxation and Finance of N. Y. v.Milhelm Attea & Bros., 512 U. S. 61, 73 (1994). Thus, theinquiry proper here is whether the legal incidence of Oklahoma's fuels tax rests on the Tribe (as retailer), or on someother transactors--here, the wholesalers who sell to theTribe or the consumers who buy from the Tribe.8Judicial focus on legal incidence in lieu of a more venturesome approach accords due deference to the lead role of Congress in evaluating state taxation as it bears on Indian tribesand tribal members. See Yakima, 502 U. S., at 267. TheState complains, however, that the legal incidence of a tax" `has no relationship to economic realities.' " Brief for Petitioner 30 (quoting Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady,430 U. S. 274, 279 (1977)). But our focus on a tax's legalincidence accommodates the reality that tax administration8 In weighing the affected interests without determining the legal incidence of the fuels tax, the District Court apparently confused our casesabout state taxation of non-Indians with those about state taxation ofIndians. The court cited a case of the former type, Washington v.Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation, 447 U. S. 134 (1980). SeeApp. to Pet. for Cert. 36a. But in Colville we resorted to balancing onlyafter determining that the legal incidence of the challenged levy was onnon-Indian consumers. 447 U. S., at 142, n. 9.515us2$79P 08-12-98 16:54:24 PAGES OPINPGT460 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. CHICKASAW NATIONOpinion of the Courtrequires predictability. The factors that would enter intoan inquiry of the kind the State urges are daunting. Ifwe were to make "economic reality" our guide, we mightbe obliged to consider, for example, how completely retailerscan pass along tax increases without sacrificing sales vol-ume--a complicated matter dependent on the characteristicsof the market for the relevant product. Cf. Yakima, 502U. S., at 267-268 (categorical approach safeguards againstrisk of litigation that could "engulf the States' annual assess-ment and taxation process, with the validity of each levydependent upon a multiplicity of factors that vary from yearto year, and from parcel to parcel").By contrast, a "legal incidence" test, as 11 States withlarge Indian populations have informed us, "provide[s] areasonably bright-line standard which, from a tax admin-istration perspective, responds to the need for substantialcertainty as to the permissible scope of state taxationauthority." Brief for South Dakota et al. as Amici Curiae2.9 And if a State is unable to enforce a tax because thelegal incidence of the impost is on Indians or Indian tribes,the State generally is free to amend its law to shift the tax'slegal incidence. So, in this case, the State recognizes andthe Tribe agrees that Oklahoma could accomplish what ithere seeks "by declaring the tax to fall on the consumer anddirecting the Tribe to collect and remit the levy." Pet. forCert. 17; see Brief for Respondent 10-13.109 Support for focusing on legal incidence is also indicated in cases arisingin the analogous context of the Federal Government's immunity from statetaxation. See United States v. County of Fresno, 429 U. S. 452, 459 (1977)("States may not . . . impose taxes the legal incidence of which falls on theFederal Government.").10 A measure designed to do just that, Committee Substitute for H. B.1522, 45th Okla. Leg., 1st Sess. (1995), was approved by the OklahomaHouse of Representatives on March 9, 1995, but failed to gain passage inthe Oklahoma Senate during the legislature's 1995 session. See Brief forRespondent 11, 1a-23a; Supplemental Brief for Respondent 1.515us2$79P 08-12-98 16:54:24 PAGES OPINPGT461Cite as: 515 U. S. 450 (1995)Opinion of the CourtCThe State also argues that, even if legal incidence is key,the Tenth Circuit erred in holding that the fuels tax's legalincidence rests on the retailer (here, the Tribe). We con-sider the Court of Appeals' ruling on this point altogetherreasonable, and therefore uphold it. See, e. g., Haring v.Prosise, 462 U. S. 306, 314, n. 8 (1983) (noting "our practiceto accept a reasonable construction of state law by the courtof appeals").The Oklahoma legislation does not expressly identify whobears the tax's legal incidence--distributors, retailers, orconsumers; nor does it contain a "pass through" provision,requiring distributors and retailers to pass on the tax'scost to consumers. Cf.Moe, 425 U. S., at 482 (statute atissue provided that Montana cigarette tax " `shall be conclusively presumed to be [a] direct [tax] on the retail consumerprecollected for the purpose of convenience and facilityonly' ").In the absence of such dispositive language, the questionis one of "fair interpretation of the taxing statute as writtenand applied."California Bd. of Equalization v. Cheme-huevi Tribe, 474 U. S. 9, 11 (1985) (per curiam). Oklahoma'slaw requires fuel distributors to "remit" the amount of taxdue to the Tax Commission; crucially, the statute describesthis remittal by the distributor as "on behalf of a licensedretailer." Okla. Stat., Tit. 68, $ 505(C) (1991) (emphasisadded). The inference that the tax obligation is legally theretailer's, not the distributor's, is supported by the prescrip-tions that sales between distributors are exempt from taxation, $ 507, but sales from a distributor to a retailer aresubject to taxation, $ 505(E). Further, if the distributorremits taxes it subsequently is unable to collect from theretailer, the distributor may deduct the uncollected amountfrom its future payments to the Tax Commission. $ 505(C).The distributor, then, "is no more than a transmittal agent515us2$79P 08-12-98 16:54:24 PAGES OPINPGT462 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. CHICKASAW NATIONOpinion of the Courtfor the taxes imposed on the retailer." 31 F. 3d, at 971.And for their services as "agent of the state for [tax] collection," distributors retain a small portion of the taxes theycollect. $ 506(a).The fuels tax law contains no comparable indication thatretailers are simply collection agents for taxes ultimately imposed on consumers. No provision sets off the retailer's lia-bility when consumers fail to make payments due; neitherare retailers compensated for their tax collection efforts.And the tax imposed when a distributor sells fuel to a retailer applies whether or not the fuel is ever purchased by aconsumer. See,e. g., $ 502 ("There is hereby levied an excisetax . . . upon the sale of each and every gallon of gasolinesold, or stored and distributed, or withdrawn from storage. . . ."). Finally, Oklahoma's law imposes no liability of anykind on a consumer for purchasing, possessing, or using un-taxed fuel; in contrast, the legislation makes it unlawful fordistributors or retailers "to sell or offer for sale in this state,motor fuel or diesel fuel while delinquent in the payment ofany excise tax due the state." $ 505(C).As the Court of Appeals fairly and reasonably concluded:"[T]he import of the language and the structure of the fueltax statutes is that the distributor collects the tax from theretail purchaser of the fuel"; the "motor fuel taxes are legallyimposed on the retailer rather than on the distributor or theconsumer." 31 F. 3d, at 971-972.IIIRegarding Oklahoma's income tax, the Court of Appealsdeclared that the State may not tax the wages of membersof the Chickasaw Nation who work for the Tribe, includingmembers who reside in Oklahoma outside Indian country.The holding on tribal members who live in the State out-side Indian country runs up against a well-established principle of interstate and international taxation--namely, thata jurisdiction, such as Oklahoma, may tax all the income515us2$79P 08-12-98 16:54:24 PAGES OPINPGT463Cite as: 515 U.

Cretton, Expatriate Tax Manual 1 (2d ed.1991) ("An individual who is resident in the UK is subject toincome tax on all his sources of income, worldwide."). Ithas been applied both to the States,e. g., Shaffer v. Carter,252 U. S. 37, 57 (1920); see 2 J. Hellerstein & W.

Isenbergh, International Taxation 45-56 (1990).1211 For nonresidents, in contrast, jurisdictions generally may tax only income earned within the jurisdiction. See Shaffer v. Carter, 252 U. S. 37,57 (1920) (as to residents, a State "may, and does, exert its taxing powerover their income from all sources"; as to nonresidents, "the tax is only onsuch income as is derived from . . . sources [within the State]").12 Although sovereigns have authority to tax all income of their residents, including income earned outside their borders, they sometimeselect not to do so, and they commonly credit income taxes paid to othersovereigns. But "[i]f foreign income of a domiciliary taxpayer is exempted, this is an independent policy decision and not one compelled byjurisdictional considerations."

Arizona Tax Comm'n, 411 U. S. 164(1973), as this principle does not operate outside Indian country. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Sac and Fox Nation, 508U. S. 114, 123-126 (1993).Notably, the Tribe has not asserted here, or before theCourt of Appeals, that the State's tax infringes on tribalself-governance. See Brief in Opposition 9-10 ("infringe-ment" question is not presented to this Court); Brief for Respondent 42, n. 37; see also Sac and Fox, 508 U.

TheTribe does not assert here its authority to tax the income of these tribalmembers. Nor does it complain that Oklahoma fails to award a creditagainst state taxes for taxes paid to the Tribe.515us2$79P 08-12-98 16:54:24 PAGES OPINPGT465Cite as: 515 U.

TheTribe invokes the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, Sept. 27,1830, Art.

But an interference-with-self-governance plea wasneither made in the lower courts nor presented here, and is thereforeforeclosed in this case.15 This treaty, first concluded between the United States and the Choctaw Nation in 1830, became applicable to the Chickasaw Nation in 1837.See Treaty of Jan. 17, 1837, Art. I, 11 Stat. 573.515us2$79P 08-12-98 16:54:24 PAGES OPINPGT466 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. CHICKASAW NATIONOpinion of the CourtCounty of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., 470U. S. 226, 247 (1985). But liberal construction cannot savethe Tribe's claim, which founders on a clear geographic limitin the Treaty. By its terms, the Treaty applies only to persons and property "within [the Nation's] limits." We com-prehend this Treaty language to provide for the Tribe's sovereignty within Indian country. We do not read the Treatyas conferring super-sovereign authority to interfere with another jurisdiction's sovereign right to tax income, from allsources, of those who choose to live within that jurisdiction's limits.The Tribe and the United States16 further urge us to readthe Treaty in accord with the repudiated view that an incometax imposed on government employees should be treatedas a tax on the government. See Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie Cty., 16 Pet. 435 (1842). But see Graves v. NewYork ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466, 480 (1939) ("The theory,which once won a qualified approval, that a tax on income islegally or economically a tax on its source, is no longer tena-ble . . . ."). Under this view, a tax on tribal members employed by the Tribe would be seen as an impermissible taxon the Tribe itself.We doubt the signatories meant to incorporate this now-defunct view into the Treaty. They likely gave no thoughtto a State's authority to tax the income of tribal members16 In its alliance with the Tribe, the United States is not an entirelydisinterested party. The United States affords Chickasaw tribal memberemployees no exemption from federal income tax. See Squire v. Capoeman, 351 U. S. 1, 6 (1956) ("[I]n ordinary affairs of life, not governed bytreaties or remedial legislation, [Indians] are subject to the payment ofincome taxes as are other citizens."); Hoptowit v. Commissioner, 709 F. 2d564 (CA9 1983) (rejecting claim of federal tax exemption for income fromtribal employment); Jourdain v. Commissioner, 617 F. 2d 507 (CA8) (percuriam) (same), cert. denied, 449 U. S. 839 (1980). And, in computingemployees' federal income tax base, state income tax is allowed as anitemized deduction. 26 U. S. C. $ 164(a)(3). Thus, an exemption of wagesfrom state income tax increases federal income tax revenue.515us2$79P 08-12-98 16:54:24 PAGES OPINPGT467Cite as: 515 U. S. 450 (1995)Appendix to opinion of the Courtliving in the State's domain, because they did not expect anymembers to be there. On the contrary, the purpose of theTreaty was to put distance between the Tribe and the States.Under the Treaty, the Tribe moved across the MississippiRiver, from its traditional lands within Mississippi and Ala-bama, to unsettled lands not then within a State. See D.Hale & A. Gibson, The Chickasaw 46-59 (1991).Moreover, importing theDobbins rule into the Treatywould prove too much. That dubious doctrine, by typingtaxation of wages earned by tribal employees as taxation ofthe Tribe itself, would require an exemption for all employees of the Tribe--not just tribal members, but nonmembersas well. The Court of Appeals rejected such an extension,see 31 F. 3d, at 975 ("It is settled that the income tax isimposed on the employee, not the employer . . . . Therefore,to the extent that the income tax is imposed on non-memberemployees who have no established claim to tribal ancestry,the tax does not infringe upon the treaty prohibition."), andeven the Tribe is not urging this view before us, admittingthat it is "substantially more tenuous." Brief for Respond-ent 47.* * *For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of theCourt of Appeals as to the motor fuels tax, reverse that judgment as to the income tax, and remand the case for proceed-ings consistent with this opinion.
