The Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980(MPPAA), 94 Stat. 1208, 29 U. S. C. $$ 1381-1461, requiresemployers who withdraw from underfunded multiemployerpension plans to pay a "withdrawal liability." An employermay discharge that obligation by making a series of periodicpayments according to a postwithdrawal schedule set by thepension fund's trustees, or it may prepay the entire debt atany time. We resolve in this case a statute of limitationsissue concerning this legislation, specifically: When does theMPPAA's six-year statute of limitations begin to run on apension fund's action to collect unpaid withdrawal liability?Dismissing petitioner trust fund's suit as time barred, theCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the statuteof limitations runs from the date the employer withdrawsfrom the plan. We reject that ruling. A limitations periodordinarily does not begin to run until the plaintiff has a"complete and present cause of action." Rawlings v. Ray,312 U. S. 96, 98 (1941). A cause of action does not ripenunder the MPPAA until the employer fails to make a payment on the schedule set by the fund. Applying the ordinarily applicable accrual rule, we hold that the statute oflimitations does not begin to run on withdrawal liability untila scheduled payment is missed.Our holding prompts a second question, one that was notreached by the Court of Appeals. Petitioner brought thissuit more than six years after respondents missed their firstscheduled payment, but within six years of each subsequentmissed payment. Respondents contend that petitioner'sfailure to sue within six years of the first missed paymentbars suit for all missed payments. We disagree. TheMPPAA imposes on employers an installment obligation.Consistent with general principles governing installmentobligations, each missed payment creates a separate causeof action with its own six-year limitations period.

The statute requires most employers who withdraw from underfundedmultiemployer pension plans to pay "withdrawal liability."29 U. S. C. $ 1381(a). As relevant here, an employer incurswithdrawal liability when it effects a "complete withdrawal"from the plan. "[C]omplete withdrawal" occurs when theemployer "permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under the plan" or "permanently ceases all coveredoperations under the plan." $ 1383(a).1Three Terms ago, we exhaustively described the MPPAA'scomplex scheme for calculating withdrawal liability. SeeMilwaukee Brewery Workers' Pension Plan, 513 U. S., at417-419, 426. In brief, the Act sets the total amount of"withdrawal liability" at a level that roughly matches "theemployer's proportionate share of the plan's `unfundedvested benefits.' " R. A. Gray & Co., 467 U.

See 29 U. S. C.$ 1392(a). The statute applies special definitions of "complete withdrawal"to particular industries. See, e. g., $$ 1383(b), (c).

The trustees must setan installment schedule and demand payment "[a]s soon aspracticable" after the employer's withdrawal. $ 1399(b)(1).On receipt of the trustees' schedule and payment demand,the employer may invoke a dispute-resolution procedure thatinvolves reconsideration by the trustees and, ultimately, ar-bitration. $$ 1399(b)(2), 1401(a)(1).

BPetitioner Bay Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning PensionTrust Fund (Fund) is a multiemployer pension fund for laundry workers in the San Francisco Bay area. RespondentsFerbar Corporation and Stephen Barnes (collectively, Ferbaror the company) owned three laundries in the area until ap-proximately 1990. For several years, Ferbar contributed tothe Fund on behalf of employees at all three facilities. In1983, Ferbar ceased contributions for one of the laundries;the company ceased contributions for the other two facilitiesin March 1985. Ferbar never resumed participation in theFund.On December 12, 1986, after concluding that Ferbar hadcompletely withdrawn from the Fund, the trustees sent aletter to the company demanding payment of its withdrawalliability. The Fund calculated Ferbar's total liability as$45,570.80 and informed the company that it had two options:pay the entire liability as a lump sum within 60 days of re-ceiving the letter, or pay $345.50 per month for 240 months,beginning February 1, 1987. Ferbar asked the trustees toreview their decision pursuant to 29 U. S. C. $ 1399(b)(2)(B),but received no response explicitly directed to that request.On July 8, 1987, Ferbar filed a notice of initiation of arbitration. Arbitration proceedings have not yet taken place.Despite the statutory "pay now, dispute later" provisions,Ferbar has made no payments toward its withdrawal liabil-ity. On April 14, 1987, the Fund warned Ferbar that thecompany was delinquent and would be in default if it failed522US1 Unit: $U13 [01-27-00 22:17:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN199Cite as: 522 U. S. 192 (1997)Opinion of the Courtto cure the delinquency within 60 days. On February 9,1993, the Fund filed this action in the United States DistrictCourt for the Northern District of California. In its com-plaint, App. 6-12, the Fund sought to recover Ferbar's entire$45,570.80 withdrawal liability. In the alternative, it soughtthe $25,375.00 that had come due prior to the filing of thesuit plus an injunction requiring Ferbar to make each futurepayment when due. The complaint was filed nearly eightyears after Ferbar completely withdrew from the Fund inMarch 1985, six years and eight days after Ferbar missed itsfirst scheduled payment on February 1, 1987, and less thansix years after Ferbar missed the second and succeedingpayments.The District Court granted summary judgment to Ferbaron statute of limitations grounds. App. to Pet. for Cert. 6a-19a. It relied on two alternative rationales. First, thecourt concluded that 29 U. S. C. $ 1451(f )(2)'s three-year "discovery" rule controlled. The Fund's action was thereforetime barred, the District Court held, because it was filed wellmore than three years after the Fund had become aware ofFerbar's delinquency. Second, assuming that $ 1451(f )(1)'ssix-year "accrual" rule applied, the District Court believedthe Fund's action nonetheless time barred. In the court'sview, the six-year period began to run on Ferbar's entire$45,570.80 liability on February 1, 1987, the date the company missed its first $345.50 payment. On that view, theaction was filed eight days too late.The Ninth Circuit affirmed, but on different reasoning.73 F. 3d 971 (1996). The Appeals Court rejected the District Court's conclusion that the Fund was required to suewithin three years after learning of the cause of action. Adverting to the express terms of 29 U. S. C. $ 1451(f ), "whichclearly direc[t] courts to apply `the later of ' the two periodsof limitations," 73 F. 3d, at 972, the Ninth Circuit held thatthe Fund could commence suit up to six years after its causeof action arose. The court also rejected the District Court's522US1 Unit: $U13 [01-27-00 22:17:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN200 BAY AREA LAUNDRY AND DRY CLEANING PENSIONTRUST FUND v. FERBAR CORP. OF CAL.Opinion of the Courtalternative conclusion that the Fund's cause of action ac-crued on the date of the first missed payment. Relying onits earlier decision in Board of Trustees v. Thibodo, 34 F. 3d914 (1994), the Court of Appeals held that "the limitationsperiod begins to run from the date of complete withdrawal--in this case, March 1985." 73 F. 3d, at 973. Under thatreading, the action was filed nearly two years too late.As Judge Trott indicated in his concurring opinion,ibid.,the Ninth Circuit's decision conflicts with an earlier decisionof the District of Columbia Circuit, Joyce v. Clyde SandozMasonry, 871 F. 2d 1119 (1989). Joyce held that the statuteof limitations on an action to collect unpaid withdrawal liabil-ity runs from the date the employer misses a scheduled payment, not from the date of complete withdrawal. Id., at1122-1127. The Third and Seventh Circuits have also heldthat the statute of limitations runs from the failure to makea payment, although they have disagreed as to whether eachmissed payment carries a separate limitations period orwhether the first missed payment triggers the limitationsperiod for the entire withdrawal liability. See Board ofTrustees of District 15 Machinists' Pension Fund v. KahleEngineering Corp., 43 F. 3d 852, 857-861 (CA3 1994) (statuteof limitations runs from each missed payment); CentralStates, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund v.Navco, 3 F. 3d 167, 172-173 (CA7 1993) (statute of limitationsruns from first missed payment). We granted certiorari, 520U. S. 1209 (1997), to resolve these conflicts.IIThe Court of Appeals held that the statute of limitationson a pension plan's action to recover unpaid withdrawal liability runs from the date the employer withdraws from theplan. On that view, the limitations period commences at atime when the plan could not yet file suit. Such a result isinconsistent with basic limitations principles, and we rejectit. A plan cannot maintain an action until the employer522US1 Unit: $U13 [01-27-00 22:17:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN201Cite as: 522 U. S. 192 (1997)Opinion of the Courtmisses a scheduled withdrawal liability payment. The stat-ute of limitations does not begin to run until that time.ABy its terms, the MPPAA's six-year statute of limitationsruns from "the date on which the cause of action arose." 29U. S. C. $ 1451(f )(1). This language, as we comprehend it, in-corporates the standard rule that the limitations period commences when the plaintiff has "a complete and present causeof action."Rawlings v. Ray, 312 U. S., at 98; see also Clarkv. Iowa City, 20 Wall. 583, 589 (1875) ("All statutes of limitation begin to run when the right of action is complete . . . .").Unless Congress has told us otherwise in the legislation atissue, a cause of action does not become "complete and pres-ent" for limitations purposes until the plaintiff can file suitand obtain relief. See Reiter v. Cooper, 507 U. S. 258, 267(1993) ("While it is theoretically possible for a statute tocreate a cause of action that accrues at one time for thepurpose of calculating when the statute of limitations beginsto run, but at another time for the purpose of bringing suit,we will not infer such an odd result in the absence of anysuch indication in the statute."). The MPPAA contains noindication that Congress intended to depart from the general rule.The date of withdrawal cannot start the statute of limitations clock, because the MPPAA affords a plan no basis toobtain relief against an employer on that date. The plancould not sue to undo the withdrawal, for an employer doesnot violate the MPPAA simply by exiting the plan. The Acttakes as a given that employers may withdraw. Instead ofprohibiting employers from leaving their plans, Congress imposed a scheme of mandatory payments designed to discour-age withdrawalsex ante and cushion their impact ex post.See Milwaukee Brewery Workers' Pension Plan, 513 U. S.,at 416-417; Connolly, 475 U. S., at 216-217. Under thatscheme, withdrawal "merely sets in motion the usual (and522US1 Unit: $U13 [01-27-00 22:17:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN202 BAY AREA LAUNDRY AND DRY CLEANING PENSIONTRUST FUND v. FERBAR CORP. OF CAL.Opinion of the Courtroutine) process of calculation, notification, schedule, possiblerequest for review or arbitration, and payment." Joyce, 871F. 2d, at 1124.Any pension plan suit to collect the employer's withdrawalliability, commenced on the date of withdrawal, would bepremature. As we have previously explained, "the statutemakes clear that the withdrawing employer owes nothinguntil its plan demands payment."Milwaukee BreweryWorkers' Pension Plan, 513 U. S., at 423. Absent a demand,even a willing employer cannot satisfy its payment obliga-tion, for "the withdrawing employer cannot determine, orpay, the amount of its debt until the plan has calculated thatamount."Ibid. Once the demand is made, the employer'sbaseline obligation is to make each payment as scheduled,unless it chooses to prepay or the plan properly exercises theacceleration option. See 29 U. S. C. $$ 1399(c)(2), 1401(b)(1).Until the employer fails to honor its obligation, the plan can-not sue.In sum, we hold that the MPPAA does not give a pensionplan any claim for relief against an employer on the dateof withdrawal. The plan's interest in receiving withdrawalliability does not ripen into a cause of action triggering thelimitations period until two events transpire. First, thetrustees must calculate the debt, set a schedule of installments, and demand payment pursuant to $ 1399(b)(1).Second, the employer must default on an installment dueand payable under the trustees' schedule. Only then hasthe employer violated an obligation owed the plan underthe Act. BIn reaching our conclusion, we have not overlooked argu-ments made by Ferbar or invoked by the Ninth Circuit. Weset out those arguments here and our reasons for rejectingthem.Maintaining that a cause of action arises on the dateof withdrawal, Ferbar relies on language in 29 U. S. C.522US1 Unit: $U13 [01-27-00 22:17:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN203Cite as: 522 U. S. 192 (1997)Opinion of the Court$ 1451(a)(1). That provision empowers a "plan fiduciary, em-ployer, plan participant, or beneficiary, who is adversely affected by the act or omission of any party under this subtitlewith respect to a multiemployer plan," to "bring an actionfor appropriate legal or equitable relief, or both." Ferbarasserts that a multiemployer plan is "adversely affected"whenever an employer withdraws. Accordingly, Ferbarurges, the plan's right of action is complete at the time ofwithdrawal.Although the payment of withdrawal liability will offsetthe harmful impact of a participant's exit, we do not doubtthat pension plans are adversely affected as a practical matter when an employer withdraws. But Ferbar's argumentis off the mark. As the Fund points out, $ 1451(a)(1) doesnot "provide a cause of action in the air for any adverseeffect on multiemployer pension funds." Reply Brief forPetitioner 2.Section 1451 prescribes a variety of procedures for thegovernance of civil actions brought to enforce the MPPAA.See,e. g., 29 U. S. C. $ 1451(c) ( jurisdiction of federal andstate courts), $ 1451(d) (venue and service of process),$ 1451(e) (costs and expenses). Subsecti on (a), headed"[p]ersons entitled to maintain actions," answers only a"standing" question--who may sue for a violation of the ob-ligations established by the Act's substantive provisions.Subsection (a)(1) extends judicial remedies for violation ofthe MPPAA to a broad range of plaintiffs--any "plan fiduciary, employer, plan participant, or beneficiary, who is ad-versely affected." But that provision does not make an "adverse effect" unlawful per se, any more than does $ 10(a) ofthe Administrative Procedure Act, which similarly empowers "adversely affected" persons to invoke judicial remedies.3We see nothing in $ 1451(a)(1) to justify the Court of Appeals'3 See 5 U. S. C. $ 702 ("A person suffering legal wrong because of agencyaction, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within themeaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof.").522US1 Unit: $U13 [01-27-00 22:17:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN204 BAY AREA LAUNDRY AND DRY CLEANING PENSIONTRUST FUND v. FERBAR CORP. OF CAL.Opinion of the Courtholding that the statute of limitations begins to run on thedate of withdrawal.In adopting the date-of-withdrawal rule in Thibodo andapplying it here, the Ninth Circuit did not rely on Ferbar'sinterpretation of $ 1451(a)(1). Instead, the Court of Appealsrested its holding on two grounds, one based on statutoryinterpretation, the other on policy considerations. As tostatutory interpretation, the court reasoned that a missedpayment approach would render $ 1451(f)(2)'s three-year discovery rule superfluous, because a pension plan will inevitably learn of the missed payment just around the time itoccurs; hence, $ 1451(f )(1)'s six-year accrual rule would always provide "the later of " the two limitations periods.See Thibodo, 34 F. 3d, at 918.We find this argument infirm. Section 1451(f)'s twin limitations periods govern much more than withdrawal liability;they apply to any "action under this section." 29 U. S. C.$ 1451(f). Such actions can involve "matters far beyond collection of withdrawal liability," including "transfers of planassets, reorganizations of plans, and benefits after termination of plans," all of which may involve matters not discovered until well after the cause of action accrues. Joyce, 871F. 2d, at 1125. Even if the three-year discovery rule is superfluous in actions to collect unpaid withdrawal liability, itretains vitality in many other cases governed by $ 1451.The Court of Appeals' policy argument fares no better.The court reasoned that a rule pegging the statute to theschedule set by the plan's trustees would "improperly plac[e]the running of the limitations period in the control of theplaintiff." Thibodo, 34 F. 3d, at 917. But that is an unavoidable consequence of the scheme Congress adopted.Congress did not set a fixed time during which a pensionfund's trustees must calculate the employer's withdrawal liability, although it surely could have done so. Notably, Congress adopted specific time limits to govern a number of522US1 Unit: $U13 [01-27-00 22:17:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN205Cite as: 522 U. S. 192 (1997)Opinion of the Courtother steps in the assessment and collection process.4 Congress' adoption of a looser "as soon as practicable" requirement for the initial determination of withdrawal liabilitybespeaks a deliberate legislative choice to afford someflexibility in gathering the information and performing thecomplex calculations necessary to make that assessment.Furthermore, we agree with the D. C. Circuit that "significant incentives . . . will, in the usual case, induce plansponsors to act promptly to calculate, schedule, and demandpayment of withdrawal liability." Joyce, 871 F. 2d, at 1126.Pension funds have a financial imperative to act quickly, forthe contributions lost when the employer withdraws will notbe replaced with withdrawal liability payments until the plancalculates those payments and serves a demand on the employer. And as time passes, the likelihood that the plan willnever receive payment increases. If the trustees' delay incalculating withdrawal liability threatens a plan's financialposition, that delay could constitute a breach of fiduciaryduty actionable at the instance of the plan's beneficiaries.Also, if an employer believes the trustees have failed to comply with their "as soon as practicable" responsibility, the employer may assert that violation as a laches objection at anarbitration contesting the withdrawal liability assessment.See ibid. The Ninth Circuit's policy concerns, in short, donot warrant an extraordinary reading of $ 1451(f ) that wouldtrigger the statute of limitations before a cause of actionaccrues.4 See 29 U. S. C. $ 1399(a) (employer must furnish requested information to the plan sponsor within 30 days); $ 1399(b)(2)(A) (employer mayseek reconsideration of withdrawal liability assessment within 90 days);$ 1399(c)(2) (withdrawal liability shall be payable according to the plansponsor's schedule, beginning no later than 60 days after the date of thedemand); $ 1401(a)(1) (either party may request arbitration within the earlier of 60 days after the plan responds to the employer's request for reconsideration or 180 days after the employer sought reconsideration).522US1 Unit: $U13 [01-27-00 22:17:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN206 BAY AREA LAUNDRY AND DRY CLEANING PENSIONTRUST FUND v. FERBAR CORP. OF CAL.Opinion of the CourtIIIAlthough we have rejected the Court of Appeals' conclu-sion that the limitations period commenced on the date ofwithdrawal, that holding alone does not resolve the limita-tions issue in this case. The Fund filed its complaint onFebruary 9, 1993. That date was more than six years afterFerbar missed its first payment (which the Fund had set forFebruary 1, 1987), but within six years of the dates sched-uled for the second and succeeding payments. Because suitwas instituted more than six years after the due date of thefirst payment, the District Court alternatively held that theaction was time barred in its entirety. See supra, at 199.The District Court's alternative ruling implicates a conflictin the Circuits. The Seventh Circuit has held, in line withthe District Court's view here, that the statute of limitationson the entire withdrawal liability begins to run when theemployer misses its first scheduled installment. Under therule advanced by the Seventh Circuit, a plan that sues toolate to recover the first payment forfeits the right to recoverany of the outstanding withdrawal liability. Navco, 3 F. 3d,at 172-173. By contrast, the Third Circuit has held thateach missed payment creates a separate cause of action withits own six-year limitations period. Under the rule advanced by the Third Circuit, a plaintiff who does not suein time to recover the first payment may still recover anysucceeding payments that came due within six years of thecomplaint. Kahle Engineering Corp., 43 F. 3d, at 857-861.We conclude that the Third Circuit's approach is the correctone. The Fund's action is therefore barred only insofar asit seeks to recover Ferbar's first $345.50 installment.AIn briefing on the merits--but not in its petition for certio-rari--the Fund argued that we need not resolve the questionthat has divided the Third and Seventh Circuits. We can522US1 Unit: $U13 [01-27-00 22:17:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN207Cite as: 522 U. S. 192 (1997)Opinion of the Courtavoid that issue, the Fund submits, because its action wastimely even as to the first payment. The Fund relies on29 U. S. C. $ 1399(c)(2), which provides: "Withdrawal liabilityshall be payable in accordance with the schedule set forth bythe plan sponsor . . . beginning no later than 60 days afterthe date of the demand . . . ." The Fund reads this provisionas extending Ferbar's time to make its first payment untilFebruary 10, 1987--60 days after the Fund sent the companya letter demanding the withdrawal liability. Brief for Petitioner 35; see Reply Brief for Petitioner 16. At oral argument, the Fund further suggested that the terms of the December 12, 1986, demand letter, which purported to allowFerbar 60 days from the letter's receipt to prepay the entireliability, independently warrant the same result. Tr. of OralArg. 12, 53. The Fund made both of these arguments in theCourt of Appeals. See Brief for Appellant in No. 94-15976(CA9), p. 11.We are satisfied, however, that the Fund has waived anyright to seek the first payment here. In its petition for certiorari, the Fund did not argue that its action was timely asto that installment. To the contrary, it stated: "On the factsof this case, the difference between the Third and SeventhCircuit positions is determinative," for "[u]nder the SeventhCircuit's Navco interpretation of the statute, the suit isbarred (as the District Court in this case alternativelyheld)." Pet. for Cert. 15-16. These representations wouldbe inaccurate if, as the Fund now argues, the action to recover the first installment was in any event timely. Havingurged that we grant certiorari to resolve not only the statuteof limitations triggering date, but also the ultimately "determinative" question that divided the Third and Seventh Circuits, the Fund is not positioned to revive its claim for thefirst $345.50 payment. Cf. Taylor v. Freeland & Kronz, 503U. S. 638, 645 (1992) (declining to consider argument with522US1 Unit: $U13 [01-27-00 22:17:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN208 BAY AREA LAUNDRY AND DRY CLEANING PENSIONTRUST FUND v. FERBAR CORP. OF CAL.Opinion of the Courtheld from the petition for certiorari and made for the firsttime in briefing on the merits).BA withdrawing employer's basic responsibility under theMPPAA is to make each withdrawal liability payment whendue. The Act thus establishes an installment obligation.Just as a pension plan cannot sue to recover any withdrawalliability until the employer misses a scheduled payment, sotoo must the plan generally wait until the employer missesa particular payment before suing to collect that payment.As we have explained, a statute of limitations ordinarily doesnot begin to run until the plaintiff could sue to enforce theobligation at issue. We therefore agree with the Third Circuit that "a new cause of action," carrying its own limitationsperiod, "arises from the date each payment is missed."Kahle Engineering Corp., 43 F. 3d, at 857. That is thestandard rule for installment obligations, and nothing in theMPPAA indicates that Congress intended to depart from it.The general rule applies even though a plan has the optionto accelerate and collect the entire debt if the employer defaults. See 29 U. S. C. $ 1399(c)(5). For limitations purposes, we cannot assume that a default will or should invariably lead to acceleration, for the statutory accelerationprovision is by its terms permissive. See ibid. ("In theevent of a default, a plan sponsor may require immediatepayment . . . .") (emphasis added). Trustees confronting adelinquent employer may accelerate if they decide such acourse is in the best interests of the plan, but they need notdo so to preserve the plan's right to recover future payments.Cf. Kahle Engineering Corp., 43 F. 3d, at 859, and n. 7 (describing reasons why acceleration might not be in the plan'sbest interests). This, again, is the rule that generally applies to installment obligations. If the creditor refrainsfrom exercising the acceleration option, the limitations pe522US1 Unit: $U13 [01-27-00 22:17:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN209Cite as: 522 U. S. 192 (1997)Opinion of the Courtriod on a particular payment runs from the date that pay-ment comes due.5Rejecting the approach we now endorse, the Seventh Cir-cuit regarded the foregoing principles as controlling contractual obligations only. Where "the employer did not assentto a longer period for payment and suit," that court concluded, a pension fund has "only one claim against the em-ployer"--"the amount of withdrawal liability. Although afund may permit an employer to amortize this sum over 20years . . . the whole amount is presumptively due at the outset." Navco, 3 F. 3d, at 172 (emphasis deleted). The NinthCircuit appeared to entertain a similar view in this case.See 73 F. 3d, at 973, n. 4 ("Ferbar never agreed to the install-ment plan proposed by the Fund and made no installmentpayments. As a result, it appears that no new contract topay off the withdrawal liability could have been formed.").We cannot agree that the rule that each missed paymentcarries its own limitations period turns on the origin--contractual or otherwise--of an installment obligation. Courtshave repeatedly applied the rule in actions to collect on installment judgments, even though such obligations obviously5 See Board of Trustees of Dist. 15 Machinists' Pension Fund v. KahleEngineering Corp., 43 F. 3d 852, 857 (CA3 1994) (" `[W]here there is anacceleration clause giving the creditor the right upon certain contingenciesto declare the whole sum due, the statute begins to run, only with respectto each instalment, at the time the instalment becomes due, unless thecreditor exercises his option to declare the whole indebtedness due, inwhich case the statute begins to run from the date of the exercise of hisoption.' ") (quoting 51 Am. Jur. 2d, Limitation of Actions $ 133 (1970)); seealso 4 A. Corbin, Contracts $ 951 (1951) ("[T]he creditor is not required tojoin subsequent instalments in his action for the first instalment, if theacceleration clause is regarded as giving him an option. In such case, thestatute does not begin to run against later instalments until each falls duein regular course."). The statute of limitations on an accelerated debtruns from the date the creditor exercises its acceleration option, not earlier. Therefore, we need not consider Ferbar's contention that the Fund'scomplaint, which sought to recover the entire withdrawal liability,amounted to a decision to accelerate.

OF CAL.Opinion of the Courtare not contractual.6 Nor can we agree that an install-ment obligation arises only on the employer's assent. TheMPPAA itself creates such an obligation. Unless the em-ployer prepays, the Act requires it, like any other installment debtor, to make payments when due. Like the typicalinstallment creditor, the plan has no right, absent defaultand acceleration, to sue to collect payments before they aredue, and it has no obligation to accelerate on default. Theemployer and the plan are thus in the same position as par-ties to an ordinary installment transaction. We see no reason to apply a different limitations rule.Our holding does not, as the Seventh Circuit believed,"[t]ur[n] six years into twenty-six." Navco, 3 F. 3d, at 172.A pension fund's action to collect unpaid withdrawal liabilityis timely as to any payments that came due during the sixyears preceding the suit. Payments that came due prior tothat time are lost. Applying that rule here, the Fund maynot recover Ferbar's first $345.50 payment. But its actionto recover the subsequent installments may proceed.* * *For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the caseis remanded for further proceedings consistent with thisopinion.
