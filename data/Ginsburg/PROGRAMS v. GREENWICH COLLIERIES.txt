FRANCHISE TAX BD. OF CAL.Opinion of the Courtmultinational enterprise, against a comprehensive challengemade under the Due Process and Commerce Clauses of theFederal Constitution. Container Corp. involved a corporatetaxpayer domiciled and headquartered in the United States;in addition to its stateside components, the taxpayer had anumber of overseas subsidiaries incorporated in the coun-tries in which they operated. The Court's decision inContainer Corp. did not address the constitutionality of Califor-nia's taxing scheme as applied to "domestic corporations withforeign parents or [to] foreign corporations with either for-eign parents or foreign subsidiaries."Id., at 189, n. 26. Inthe consolidated cases before us, we return to the taxingscheme earlier considered in Container Corp. and resolvematters left open in that case.The petitioner in No. 92-1384, Barclays Bank PLC (Barclays), is a United Kingdom corporation in the BarclaysGroup, a multinational banking enterprise. The petitionerin No. 92-1839, Colgate-Palmolive Co. (Colgate), is theUnited States-based parent of a multinational manufacturingand sales enterprise. Each enterprise has operations inCalifornia. During the years here at issue, California determined the state corporate franchise tax due for these operations under a method known as "worldwide combined reporting." California's scheme first looked to the worldwideincome of the multinational enterprise, and then attributeda portion of that income (equal to the average of the proportions of worldwide payroll, property, and sales located in California) to the California operations. The State imposed itstax on the income thus attributed to Barclays' and Colgate'sCalifornia business.Barclays urges that California's tax system distinctivelyburdens foreign-based multinationals and results in doubleinternational taxation, in violation of the Commerce and DueProcess Clauses. Both Barclays and Colgate contend thatthe scheme offends the Commerce Clause by frustrating theFederal Government's ability to "speak with one voice when512us2$79P 01-08-98 12:24:49 PAGES OPINPGT303Cite as: 512 U.

We reject thesearguments, and hold that the Constitution does not impedeapplication of California's corporate franchise tax to Barclaysand Colgate. Accordingly, we affirm the judgments of theCalifornia Court of Appeal.IAThe Due Process and Commerce Clauses of the Constitution, this Court has held, prevent States that impose anincome-based tax on nonresidents from "tax[ing] valueearned outside [the taxing State's] borders."ASARCO Inc.v. Idaho Tax Comm'n, 458 U. S. 307, 315 (1982). But whena business enterprise operates in more than one taxing jurisdiction, arriving at "precise territorial allocations of `value'is often an elusive goal, both in theory and in practice."Container Corp., 463 U. S., at 164. Every method of alloca-tion devised involves some degree of arbitrariness. Seeid.,at 182.One means of deriving locally taxable income, generallyused by States that collect corporate income-based taxes, isthe "unitary business" method. As explained in ContainerCorp., unitary taxation "rejects geographical or transactional accounting," which is "subject to manipulation" anddoes not fully capture "the many subtle and largely unquantifiable transfers of value that take place among the compo-nents of a single enterprise."Id., at 164-165. The "unitarybusiness/formula apportionment" method"calculates the local tax base by first defining the scopeof the `unitary business' of which the taxed enterprise'sactivities in the taxing jurisdiction form one part, andthen apportioning the total income of that `unitary business' between the taxing jurisdiction and the rest of theworld on the basis of a formula taking into account ob512us2$79P 01-08-98 12:24:49 PAGES OPINPGT304 BARCLAYS BANK PLC v. FRANCHISE TAX BD. OF CAL.Opinion of the Courtjective measures of the corporation's activities withinand without the jurisdiction." Id., at 165.1During the income years at issue in these cases--1977 forBarclays, 1970-1973 for Colgate--California assessed its corporate franchise tax by employing a "worldwide combinedreporting" method. California's scheme required the taxpayer to aggregate the income of all corporate entities com-posing the unitary business enterprise, including in theaggregation both affiliates operating abroad and thoseoperating within the United States. Having defined thescope of the "unitary business" thus broadly, California useda long-accepted method of apportionment, commonly calledthe "three-factor" formula, to arrive at the amount of incomeattributable to the operations of the enterprise in California.Under the three-factor formula, California taxed a percent-age of worldwide income equal to the arithmetic average ofthe proportions of worldwide payroll, property, and sales lo-cated inside the State. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code Ann. $ 251281 This Court first considered the "unitary business principle" in 1897,Adams Express Co. v. Ohio State Auditor, 165 U. S. 194, 220-221; we revisited this "settled jurisprudence" most recently in Allied-Signal, Inc. v.Director, Div. of Taxation, 504 U. S. 768, 779-788 (1992). See generally1 J. Hellerstein & W.

Thus, if a unitary business had 8% of its payroll, 3% of its property, and 4% of its sales in California, theState took the average--5%--and imposed its tax on thatpercentage of the business' total income.2BThe corporate income tax imposed by the United Statesemploys a "separate accounting" method, a means of apportioning income among taxing sovereigns used by all majordeveloped nations. In contrast to combined reporting, separate accounting treats each corporate entity discretely forthe purpose of determining income tax liability.3Separate accounting poses the risk that a conglomeratewill manipulate transfers of value among its components tominimize its total tax liability. To guard against such manipulation, transactions between affiliated corporations mustbe scrutinized to ensure that they are reported on an "arm'slength" basis, i. e., at a price reflecting their true marketvalue.

The new amendments became effective in January1994.CThe first of these consolidated cases, No. 92-1384, is a taxrefund suit brought by two members of the Barclays Group,a multinational banking enterprise. Based in the UnitedKingdom, the Barclays Group includes more than 220 corporations doing business in some 60 nations. The two refundseeking members of the Barclays corporate family did business in California and were therefore subject to California'sfranchise tax. Barclays Bank of California (Barcal), one ofthe two taxpayers, was a California banking corporationwholly owned by Barclays Bank International Limited(BBI), the second taxpayer. BBI, a United Kingdom corporation, did business in the United Kingdom and in more than33 other nations and territories.In computing its California franchise tax based on 1977income, Barcal reported only the income from its own operations. BBI reported income on the assumption that itparticipated in a unitary business composed of itself and itssubsidiaries, but not its parent corporation and the parent'sother subsidiaries. After auditing BBI's and Barcal's 1977income year franchise tax returns, the Tax Board, respondent here, determined that both were part of a worldwideunitary business, the Barclays Group. Ultimately, the TaxBoard assessed additional tax liability of $1,678 for BBI and$152,420 for Barcal.66 The figures used by the Tax Board were:Worldwide CaliforniaTaxable Formula Business FranchiseTaxpayer Income Percentage Income TaxBarcal $401,566,973 .0139032% $5,583,066 $693,696BBI 401,566,973 .0003232% 129,786 16,126App. in No. 92-1384, pp. A-13 to A-14 (Joint Stipulation of Facts || 22).512us2$79P 01-08-98 12:24:49 PAGES OPINPGT308 BARCLAYS BANK PLC v. FRANCHISE TAX BD. OF CAL.Opinion of the CourtBarcal and BBI paid the assessments and sued for refunds.They prevailed in California's lower courts, but were unsuccessful in California's Supreme Court. The California Su-preme Court held that the tax did not impair the FederalGovernment's ability to "speak with one voice" in regulatingforeign commerce, seeJapan Line, Ltd. v. County of LosAngeles, 441 U. S., at 449, and therefore did not violate theCommerce Clause. Having so concluded, the California Su-preme Court remanded the case to the Court of Appeal forfurther development of Barclays' claim that the complianceburden on foreign-based multinationals imposed by California's tax violated both the Due Process Clause and the non-discrimination requirement of the Commerce Clause.Bar-clay's Bank Int'l, Ltd. v. Franchise Tax Bd., 2 Cal. 4th 708,829 P. 2d 279, cert. denied, 506 U. S. 870 (1992). On remand,the Court of Appeal decided the compliance burden issuesagainst Barclays, 10 Cal. App. 4th 1742, 14 Cal.

Neither Barclays nor Col-gate has demonstrated the lack of a "rational relationshipbetween the income attributed to the State and the intra-state values of the enterprise,"Container Corp., 463 U.

We note in this regard that, "if applied by every jurisdiction," California's method "would result in no more than all of the unitary business' income beingtaxed." Id., at 169.

S. 298 (1994)Opinion of the Courttest. Barclays maintains that a foreign owner of a taxpayerfiling a California tax return "is forced to convert its diversefinancial and accounting records from around the world intothe language, currency, and accounting principles of theUnited States" at "prohibitiv[e]" expense. Brief for Petitioner in No. 92-1384, p. 44.11 Domestic-owned taxpayers,by contrast, need not incur such expense because they "already keep most of their records in English, in United Statescurrency, and in accord with United States accounting principles." Id., at 45. Barclays urges that imposing this "pro-hibitive administrative burden,"id., at 43, on foreign-ownedenterprises gives a competitive advantage to their UnitedStates-owned counterparts and constitutes "economic protectionism" of the kind this Court has often condemned.Id., at 43-46.Compliance burdens, if disproportionately imposed onout-of-jurisdiction enterprises, may indeed be inconsonantwith the Commerce Clause. See,e. g., Hunt v. WashingtonState Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333, 350-351(1977) (increased costs imposed by North Carolina statute onout-of-state apple producers "would tend to shield the localapple industry from the competition of Washington applegrowers," thereby discriminating against those growers).The factual predicate of Barclays' discrimination claim, however, is infirm.Barclays points to provisions of California's implementingregulations setting out three discrete means for a taxpayerto fulfill its franchise tax reporting requirements. Each ofthese modes of compliance would require Barclays to gatherand present much information not maintained by the unitary11 Barclays estimates, and the trial court found, that an accounting system capable of conveying the information Barclays thought California'sworldwide reporting scheme required for all of the enterprise's foreignaffiliates would cost more than $5 million to set up, and more than $2million annually to maintain.

Cal. Code of Regs., Title18, $ 25137-6(e)(1) (1985). As the Court of Appeal comprehended, in determining Barclays' 1977 worldwide income,Barclays and the Tax Board "used these [latter] provisionsand [made] computations based on reasonable approxima-tions," 10 Cal. App. 4th, at 1756, 14 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 545, thusallowing Barclays to avoid the large compliance costs ofwhich it complains.13 Barclays has not shown that California's provision for "reasonable approximations" systemati-cally "overtaxes" foreign corporations generally or BBI orBarcal in particular.In sum, Barclays has not demonstrated that California'stax system in fact operates to impose inordinate complianceburdens on foreign enterprises. Barclays' claim of unconstitutional discrimination against foreign commerce thereforefails.IIIBarclays additionally argues that California's "reasonableapproximations" method of reducing the compliance burden12 Under the regulations to which Barclays refers, a "unitary businesswith operations in foreign countries" may determine its worldwide incomebased upon either (1) "[a] profit and loss statement . . . for each foreignbranch or corporation," Cal. Code of Regs., Title 18, $ 25137-6(b)(1) (1985);(2) the "consolidated profit and loss statement prepared for the relatedcorporations of which the unitary business is a member which is preparedfor filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission," $ 25137-6(b)(2);or (3) "the consolidated profit and loss statement prepared for reportingto shareholders and subject to review by an independent auditor," ibid.13 The California Court of Appeal additionally found that Barclays' actual compliance costs were "relatively modest" during the years just priorto those here at issue, ranging from $900 to $1,250 per annum, for BBI.See 10 Cal.

"Foreign multinationals,"Barclays maintains, "remain at peril in filing their tax returns because there is no standard to determine what `ap-proximations' will be accepted." Brief for Petitioner in No.92-1384, at 49. Barclays presents no substantive grievanceconcerning the treatment it has received, i. e., no example ofan approximation rejected by the Tax Board as unreasonable. Barclays instead complains that "[t]he grant of stand-ardless discretion itself violates due process," so that thetaxpayer need not show "actual harm from arbitrary applica-tion."Ibid.We note, initially, that "reasonableness" is a guide admit-ting effective judicial review in myriad settings, from encounters between the police and the citizenry, see Terry v.Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 27 (1968) (Fourth Amendment permits po-lice officer's limited search for weapons in circumstanceswhere "reasonably prudent man . . . would be warranted inthe belief that his safety or that of others was in danger"based upon "reasonable inferences . . . draw[n] from the factsin light of [officer's] experience"), to the more closely analogous federal income tax context. See, e. g., 26 U. S. C.$ 162(a)(1) (allowing deductions for ordinary business expenses, including a "reasonable allowance for salaries orother compensation"); $ 167(a) (permitting a "reasonable allowance" for wear and tear as a depreciation deduction); seealso United States v. Ragen, 314 U. S. 513, 522 (1942) (notingthat determinations "by reference to a standard of `reasonableness' [are] not unusual under federal income tax laws").We next observe that California's judiciary has construedthe California law to curtail the discretion of California taxofficials. See 10 Cal. App. 4th, at 1762, 14 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at549 (the Tax Board must consider "regularly-maintained orother readily-accessibly corporate documents" in decidingwhether the "cost and effort of producing [worldwide combined reporting] information" justifies submission of "reasonable approximations"). We note, furthermore, that California has afforded Barclays the opportunity "to clarify the512us2$79P 01-08-98 12:24:50 PAGES OPINPGT316 BARCLAYS BANK PLC v. FRANCHISE TAX BD.

Code of Regs.,Title 18, $ 25137-6(e)(2) (1985).Rules governing international multijurisdictional incomeallocation have an inescapable imprecision given the com-plexity of the subject matter. SeeContainer Corp., 463U.

S., at 498, we hold that California's scheme does nottransgress constitutional limitations in this regard, and thatBarclays' due process argument is no more weighty thanits claim of discrimination first placed under a CommerceClause heading.IVASatisfied that California's corporate franchise tax is"proper and fair" as tested underComplete Auto's guides,14 As noted by the California Court of Appeal, even the federal separateaccounting scheme preferred by Barclays entails recourse to a standard"akin to reasonable approximation." 10 Cal. App. 4th 1742, 1763, 14 Cal.Rptr. 2d 537, 550 (1993). The Internal Revenue Code allows the Secretary of Treasury to "distribute, apportion, or allocate gross income, deductions, credits, or allowances" among a controlled group of businesses "ifhe determines that such distribution, apportionment, or allocation is necessary in order to prevent evasion of taxes or clearly to reflect the income"of such businesses. 26 U.

S. 298 (1994)Opinion of the Courtsee Container Corp., 463 U. S., at 184, we proceed to the"additional scrutiny" required when a State seeks to tax foreign commerce. Id., at 185. First of the two additionalconsiderations is "the enhanced risk of multiple taxation."Ibid.InContainer Corp., we upheld application of California'scombined reporting obligation to "foreign subsidiaries ofdomestic corporations," id., at 193 (emphasis added), againsta charge that such application unconstitutionally exposedthose subsidiaries to a risk of multiple international taxa-tion.15 Barclays contends that its situation compels a different outcome, because application of the combined reportingobligation to foreign multinationals creates a " `more aggravated' risk . . . of double taxation." Brief for Petitioner inNo. 92-1384, at 32, quoting Nos. 325059 and 325061 (Super.Ct. Sacramento Cty., Aug. 20, 1987) (reprinted in App. toPet. for Cert. in No. 92-1384, p. A-26). Barclays rests itsargument on the observation that "foreign multinationalstypically have more of their operations and entities outsideof the United States [compared to] domestic multinationals,which typically have a smaller share of their operations andentities outside of the United States." Brief for Petitionerin No. 92-1384, at 33.16 As a result, a higher proportion ofthe income of a foreign multinational is subject to taxationby foreign sovereigns. This reality, Barclays concludes,means that for the foreign multinational, which must includeall its foreign operations in the California combined report-ing group, "the breadth of double taxation and the degree ofburden on foreign commerce are greater than in the case ofdomestic multinationals." Ibid.15 We reserved judgment on whether an altered analysis would be required where the taxpayer was part of a foreign-based enterprise. SeeContainer Corp., 463 U. S., at 189, n. 26; id., at 195, n. 32.16 To illustrate, Barclays points to its own operations: only 3 of the morethan 220 entities in the Barclays Group did any business in the UnitedStates.

OF CAL.Opinion of the CourtWe do not question Barclays' assertion that multinationalenterprises with a high proportion of income taxed by jurisdictions with wage rates, property values, and sales priceslower than California's face a correspondingly high risk ofmultiple international taxation. See Container Corp., 463U. S., at 187; cf.id., at 199-200 (Powell, J., dissenting) (de-scribing how formulary apportionment leads to multiple taxation). Nor do we question that foreign-based multination-als have a higher proportion of such income, on average, thando their United States counterparts. But Container Corp.'sapproval of this very tax, in the face of a multiple taxationchallenge, did not rest on any insufficiency in the evidencethat multiple taxation might occur; indeed, we accepted inthat case the taxpayer's assertion that multiple taxation infact had occurred.Id., at 187 ("[T]he tax imposed here, likethe tax in Japan Line, has resulted in actual double taxation,in the sense that some of the income taxed without appor-tionment by foreign nations as attributable to appellant's foreign subsidiaries was also taxed by California as attributableto the State's share of the total income of the unitary business of which those subsidiaries are a part."); see also id., at187, n. 22.Container Corp.'s holding on multiple taxation relied ontwo considerations: first, that multiple taxation was not the"inevitable result" of the California tax; 17 and, second, thatthe "alternativ[e] reasonably available to the taxing State"(i. e., some version of the separate accounting/"arm's length"17 The Court stated: "[T]he double taxation in this case, although real,is not the `inevitabl[e]' result of the California taxing scheme. . . . [W]e arefaced with two distinct methods of allocating the income of a multinationalenterprise. The `arm's-length' approach divides the pie on the basis offormal accounting principles. The formula apportionment method dividesthe same pie on the basis of a mathematical generalization. Whether thecombination of the two methods results in the same income being taxedtwice or in some portion of income not being taxed at all is dependentsolely on the facts of the individual case." Container Corp., 463 U. S., at188 (citation omitted).512us2$79P 01-08-98 12:24:50 PAGES OPINPGT319Cite as: 512 U. S. 298 (1994)Opinion of the Courtapproach), id., at 188-189, "could not eliminate the risk ofdouble taxation" and might in some cases enhance that risk.Id., at 191.18 We underscored that "even though most nations have adopted the arm's-length approach in its generaloutlines, the precise rules under which they reallocate income among affiliated corporations often differ substantially,and whenever that difference exists, the possibility of doubletaxation also exists." Ibid. (emphasis added); see also id.,at 192 ("California would have trouble avoiding multiple taxation even if it adopted the `arm's-length' approach . . . .").These considerations are not dispositively diminishedwhen California's tax is applied to the components of foreign,as opposed to domestic, multinationals. Multiple taxation ofsuch entities because of California's scheme is not "inevitable"; the existence vel non of actual multiple taxation of income remains, as in Container Corp., dependent "on the factsof the individual case." Id., at 188. And if, as we have held,adoption of a separate accounting system does not dispositively lessen the risk of multiple taxation of the incomeearned by foreign affiliates of domestic-owned corporations,we see no reason why it would do so in respect of the incomeearned by foreign affiliates of foreign-owned corporations.We refused in Container Corp. "to require California to giveup one allocation method that sometimes results in doubletaxation in favor of another allocation method that alsosometimes results in double taxation." Id., at 193. The18 The Court's decision in Container Corp. effectively modified, for purposes of income taxation, the Commerce Clause multiple taxation inquirydescribed in Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434(1979) (holding unconstitutional application of California's ad valoremproperty tax to cargo containers based in Japan and used exclusively inforeign commerce). In Japan Line, confronting a property tax on containers used as "instrumentalities of [foreign] commerce," not an incometax on companies, we said that a state tax is incompatible with the Commerce Clause if it "creates a substantial risk of international multiple taxation." Id., at 451.512us2$79P 01-08-98 12:24:50 PAGES OPINPGT320 BARCLAYS BANK PLC v. FRANCHISE TAX BD. OF CAL.Opinion of the Courtforeign domicile of the taxpayer (or the taxpayer's parent) isa factor inadequate to warrant retraction of that position.Recognizing that multiple taxation of international enter-prise may occur whatever taxing scheme the State adopts,Justice O'Connor, dissenting in No. 92-1384, finds imper-missible under "the [dormant] Foreign Commerce Clause"only double taxation that (1) burdens a foreign corporationin need of protection for lack of access to the political process, and (2) occurs "because [the State] does not conform tointernational practice."Post, at 336. But the image of apolitically impotent foreign transactor is surely belied by thebattalion of foreign governments that has marched to Bar-clays' aid, deploring worldwide combined reporting in diplomatic notes, amicus briefs, and even retaliatory legislation.Seeinfra, at 324, n. 22; post, at 337. Indeed, Californiaresponded to this impressive political activity when iteliminated mandatory worldwide combined reporting. Seesupra, at 306. In view of this activity, and the control reinCongress holds, see infra, at 329-331, we cannot agree that"international practice" has such force as to dictate thisCourt's Commerce Clause jurisprudence. We thereforeadhere to the precedent set inContainer Corp.BWe turn, finally, to the question ultimately and most ener-getically presented: Did California's worldwide combined reporting requirement, as applied to Barcal, BBI, and Colgate,"impair federal uniformity in an area where federal uniformity is essential," Japan Line, 441 U. S., at 448; in particular,did the State's taxing scheme "preven[t] the Federal Government from `speaking with one voice' in international trade"?Id., at 453, quoting Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, 423 U. S.,at 285. 1Two decisions principally inform our judgment: first, thisCourt's 1983 determination in Container Corp.; and second,our decision three years later in Wardair Canada Inc. v.512us2$79P 01-08-98 12:24:50 PAGES OPINPGT321Cite as: 512 U. S. 298 (1994)Opinion of the CourtFlorida Dept. of Revenue, 477 U. S. 1 (1986). ContainerCorp. held that California's worldwide combined reportingrequirement, as applied to domestic corporations with for-eign subsidiaries, did not violate the "one voice" standard.Container Corp. bears on Colgate's case, but not Barcal's orBBI's, to this extent: "[T]he tax [inContainer Corp.] wasimposed, not on a foreign entity . . . , but on a domesticcorporation." 463 U. S., at 195.19 Other factors emphasizedin Container Corp., however, are relevant to the complaintsof all three taxpayers in the consolidated cases now beforeus.20 Most significantly, the Court found no "specific indications of congressional intent" to preempt California's tax:"First, there is no claim here that the federal tax stat-utes themselves provide the necessary pre-emptiveforce. Second, although the United States is a party toa great number of tax treaties that require the FederalGovernment to adopt some form of `arm's-length' analy-sis in taxing the domestic income of multinational enterprises, that requirement is generally waived with re-spect to the taxes imposed by each of the contractingnations on its own domestic corporations. . . . Third, thetax treaties into which the United States has entered donot generally cover the taxing activities of subnationalgovernmental units such as States, and in none of the19 Container Corp. noted:"We recognize that the fact that legal incidence of a tax falls on a corporation whose formal corporate domicile is domestic might be less significant in the case of a domestic corporation that was owned by foreign interests. We need not decide here whether such a case would require us toalter our analysis." 463 U. S., at 195, n. 32.20 Container Corp. observed that "the tax here does not create an automatic `asymmetry' . . . in international taxation," id., at 194-195, quotingJapan Line, 441 U. S., at 453--i. e., it does not inevitably lead to doubletaxation. See supra, at 319-320, and n. 17. Furthermore, Colgate, Barcal, and BBI are "without a doubt amenable to be taxed in California inone way or another," and "the amount of tax [they] pa[y] is much morethe function of California's tax rate than of its allocation method." 463U.

Moreover, the Senate has on at least one occasion, in considering a pro-posed treaty, attached a reservation declining to giveits consent to a provision in the treaty that would haveextended that restriction to the States. Finally, . . .Congress has long debated, but has not enacted, legisla-tion designed to regulate state taxation of income."Id., at 196-197 (footnotes and internal quotation marksomitted).The Court again confronted a "one voice" argument inWardair Canada Inc. v. Florida Dept. of Revenue, 477 U. S.1 (1986), and there rejected a Commerce Clause challenge toFlorida's tax on the sale of fuel to common carriers, includingairlines. Air carriers were taxed on all aviation fuel purchased in Florida, without regard to the amount the carrierconsumed within the State or the amount of its in-state business. The carrier in Wardair, a Canadian airline that oper-ated charter flights to and from the United States, concededthat the challenged tax satisfied the Complete Auto criteriaand entailed no threat of multiple international taxation.Joined by the United States as amicus curiae, however, thecarrier urged that Florida's tax "threaten[ed] the ability ofthe Federal Government to `speak with one voice.' " 477U. S., at 9. There is "a federal policy," the carrier asserted,"of reciprocal tax exemptions for aircraft, equipment, andsupplies, including aviation fuel, that constitute the instrumentalities of international air traffic"; this policy, the car-rier argued, "represents the statement that the `one voice'of the Federal Government wishes to make," a statement"threatened by [Florida's tax]."Ibid.This Court disagreed, observing that the proffered evidence disclosed no federal policy of the kind described andindeed demonstrated that the Federal Government intendedto permit the States to impose sales taxes on aviation fuel.The international convention and resolution and more than70 bilateral treaties on which the carrier relied to show a512us2$79P 01-08-98 12:24:50 PAGES OPINPGT323Cite as: 512 U. S. 298 (1994)Opinion of the CourtUnited States policy of tax exemption for the instrumentalities of international air traffic, the Court explained, in factindicated far less: "[W]hile there appears to be an international aspiration on the one hand to eliminate all impediments to foreign air travel--including taxation of fuel--thelaw as it presently stands acquiesces in taxation of the saleof that fuel by political subdivisions of countries." Id., at10 (emphasis in original). Most of the bilateral agreementsprohibited the Federal Government from imposing nationaltaxes on aviation fuel used by foreign carriers, but none prohibited the States or their subdivisions from taxing the saleof fuel to foreign airlines. The Court concluded that "[b]ynegative implication arising out of [these international accords,] the United States has at least acquiesced in state taxation of fuel used by foreign carriers in international travel,"and therefore upheld Florida's tax. Id., at 12.In both Wardair and Container Corp., the Court considered the "one voice" argument only after determining thatthe challenged state action was otherwise constitutional.An important premise underlying both decisions 21 is this:Congress may more passively indicate that certain statepractices do not "impair federal uniformity in an area wherefederal uniformity is essential," Japan Line, 441 U. S., at448; it need not convey its intent with the unmistakable clarity required to permit state regulation that discriminatesagainst interstate commerce or otherwise falls short underComplete Auto inspection. See, e. g., Maine v. Taylor, 477U. S. 131, 139 (1986) (requiring an "unambiguous indicationof congressional intent" to insulate "otherwise invalid statelegislation" from judicial dormant Commerce Clause scru21 See also Itel Containers Int'l Corp. v.

Our decision upholding California's fran-chise tax inContainer Corp. left the ball in Congress' court;had Congress, the branch responsible for the regulation offoreign commerce, see U. S.

S., at 448, it could have enactedlegislation prohibiting the States from taxing corporate income based on the worldwide combined reporting method.In the 11 years that have elapsed since our decision inCon-tainer Corp., Congress has failed to enact such legislation.In the past three decades--both before and after Container Corp.--Congress, aware that foreign governmentswere displeased with States' worldwide combined reportingrequirements,22 has on many occasions studied state taxation22 The governments of many of our trading partners have expressedtheir strong disapproval of California's method of taxation, as demonstrated by the amici briefs in support of Barclays from the Governmentof the United Kingdom, and from the Member States of the EuropeanCommunities (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain) and the governmentsof Australia, Austria, Canada, Finland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. Barclays has also directed our attention to a series of diplomaticnotes similarly protesting the tax. See, e. g., App. in No. 92-1384, at A-92to A-123, A-127 to A-128, A-131 to A-138; see also p.

The Constitution expressly grants Congress,not the President, the power to "regulate Commerce withforeign Nations." U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3. As wehave detailed,supra, at 324-327, and nn. 23-27, Congresshas focused its attention on this issue, but has refrained fromexercising its authority to prohibit state-mandated world-wide combined reporting. That the Executive Branch proposed legislation to outlaw a state taxation practice, but en-countered an unreceptive Congress, is not evidence that thepractice interfered with the Nation's ability to speak withone voice, but is rather evidence that the preeminent speakerdecided to yield the floor to others. Cf. Itel Containers Int'lCorp. v. Huddleston, 507 U. S. 60, 81 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ("[The President] is better able to decide than we are which state regula-tory interests should currently be subordinated to ournational interest in foreign commerce. Under the Constitution, however, neither he nor we were to make that decision,but only Congress.").Congress may "delegate very large grants of its powerover foreign commerce to the President," who "also possesses in his own right certain powers conferred by the Constitution on him as Commander-in-Chief and as the Nation'sorgan in foreign affairs."

Executive Branchcommunications that express federal policy but lack the forceof law cannot render unconstitutional California's otherwisevalid, congressionally condoned, use of worldwide combinedreporting.32 * * *The Constitution does " `not make the judiciary the overseer of our government.'

Having determined that the taxpayers before us had an adequatenexus with the State, that worldwide combined reporting ledto taxation which was fairly apportioned, nondiscriminatory,fairly related to the services provided by the State, and thatits imposition did not result inevitably in multiple taxation,32 The Solicitor General suggests that when a court analyzes "whether astate tax impairs the federal government's ability to speak with one voice. . . the statements of executive branch officials are entitled to substantialevidentiary weight," Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19, but heargues that the constitutionality of a State's taxing practice must be assessed according to the federal policy, if any, in effect at the time thechallenged taxes were assessed. He asserts that federal officials had notarticulated a policy opposing use by the States of worldwide combinedreporting prior to the mid-1980's, and urges the Court to affirm the judgments below on the ground that California's use of worldwide combinedreporting was not unconstitutional during the years here at issue, even ifit became unconstitutional in later years (a question on which he takes noposition, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 38-41). Colgate, on the other hand, suggeststhat the relevant time frame is "when the tax is definitively enforced bythe state taxing authority, through judicial proceedings if necessary, notwhen the tax technically accrues under state law," Reply Brief for Petitioner in No. 92-1839, p. 7, and argues in the alternative that a federalpolicy opposing combined worldwide reporting had been established as of1970-1973, id., at 9. We need not resolve this dispute, because we haveconcluded that the Executive statements criticizing States' use of worldwide combined reporting do not, in light of Congress' acquiescence in theStates' actions, authorize judicial intervention here.512us2$79P 01-08-98 12:24:50 PAGES OPINPGT331Cite as: 512 U.
