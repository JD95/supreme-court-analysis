The meaning of a subparagraph in a section of the Truthin Lending Act (TILA or Act), 15 U. S. C. $ 1601et seq., is atissue in this case. As originally enacted in 1968, the provision in question bracketed statutory damages for violationsof TILA prescriptions governing consumer loans: $100 wasmade the minimum recovery and $1,000, the maximumaward. In 1995, Congress added a new clause increasing recovery for TILA violations relating to closed-end loans "se-cured by real property or a dwelling." $ 1640(a)(2)(A)(iii).In lieu of the $100/$1,000 minimum and maximum recoveries,Congress substituted $200/$2,000 as the floor and ceiling.Less-than-meticulous drafting of the 1995 amendment cre-ated an ambiguity. A divided panel of the United StatesCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that the 1995amendment not only raised the statutory damages recoverable for TILA violations involving real-property-securedloans, it also removed the $1,000 cap on recoveries involvingloans secured by personal property. We reverse that deter-mination and hold that the 1995 amendment left unalteredthe $100/$1,000 limits prescribed from the start for TILAviolations involving personal-property loans. The purposeof the 1995 amendment is not in doubt: Congress meant toraise the minimum and maximum recoveries for closed-endloans secured by real property. There is scant indicationthat Congress simultaneously sought to remove the $1,000cap on loans secured by personal property.ICongress enacted TILA in 1968, as part of the ConsumerCredit Protection Act, Pub.

The Act requires a creditor to dis-close information relating to such things as finance charges,annual percentage rates of interest, and borrowers' rights,see $$ 1631-1632, 1635, 1637-1639, and it prescribes civil liability for any creditor who fails to do so, see $ 1640. As orig-inally enacted in 1968, the Act provided for statutory damages of twice the finance charge in connection with thetransaction, except that recovery could not be less than $100or greater than $1,000.1 The original civil-liability provi-sion stated:"(a) [A]ny creditor who fails in connection with anyconsumer credit transaction to disclose to any personany information required under this chapter to be dis-closed to that person is liable to that person in anamount . . . of"(1) twice the amount of the finance charge in connection with the transaction, except that liability under thisparagraph shall not be less than $100 nor greater than$1,000 . . . ."

Congress reworded the original stat-utory damages provision to limit it to individual actions,moved the provision from $ 1640(a)(1) to $ 1640(a)(2)(A), andretained the $100/$1,000 brackets on recovery.

PublicFinance Corp., 598 F. 2d 349, 358, 359, n. 17 (CA5 1979).In 1995, Congress amended TILA's statutory damages provision once more. The 1995 amendment, which gave rise tothe dispute in this case, added a new clause (iii) at the endof $ 1640(a)(2)(A), setting a $200 floor and $2,000 ceiling forstatutory damages in an individual action relating to aclosed-end credit transaction "secured by real property or adwelling." Truth in Lending Act Amendments of 1995, Pub.L. 104-29, $ 6, 109 Stat. 274. These closed-end real estateloans, formerly encompassed by clause (i), had earlier beenheld subject to the $100/$1,000 limitation. See, e. g., Mayfield v. Vanguard Sav. & Loan Assn., 710 F. Supp. 143, 146(ED Pa. 1989) (ordering "the maximum statutory award of$1,000" for each TILA violation concerning a secured realestate loan). Section 1640(a), as amended in 1995, thus provides for statutory damages equal to"(2)(A)(i) in the case of an individual action twice theamount of any finance charge in connection with thetransaction, (ii) in the case of an individual action relating to a consumer lease . . . 25 per centum of the totalamount of monthly payments under the lease, exceptthat the liability under this subparagraph shall not beless than $100 nor greater than $1,000, or (iii) in the caseof an individual action relating to a credit transactionnot under an open end credit plan that is secured by realproperty or a dwelling, not less than $200 or greaterthan $2,000 . . . ."543US1 Unit: $$U4 [03-06-07 11:47:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN57Cite as: 543 U. S. 50 (2004)Opinion of the CourtShortly after the passage of the 1995 TILA amendments,the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued an official policy announcement describing the changes. With re-spect to changes in TILA's civil-liability provisions, the announcement stated only that "[p]unitive damages have beenincreased for transactions secured by real property or adwelling from a maximum of $1,000 to a maximum of $2,000(closed-end credit only)." Administrator of National Banks,Truth in Lending Act Amendments of 1995, OCC Bulletin96-1, p. 2 (Jan. 5, 1996).In 1997, the Seventh Circuit, in Strange v. MonogramCredit Card Bank of Ga., 129 F. 3d 943, held that the mean-ing of clauses (i) and (ii) remained untouched by the additionof clause (iii). The Seventh Circuit observed that prior tothe addition of clause (iii) in 1995, "[c]ourts uniformly interpreted the final clause, which established the $100 minimumand the $1,000 maximum, as applying to both (A)(i) and(A)(ii)." Id., at 947. The 1995 amendment, the SeventhCircuit reasoned, "was designed simply to establish a moregenerous minimum and maximum for certain secured trans-actions, without changing the general rule on minimum andmaximum damage awards for the other two parts of$ 1640(a)(2)(A)."Ibid. As Strange illustrates, TILA viola-tions may involve finance charges that, when doubled, areless than $100. There, double-the-finance-charge liabilitywas $54.27, entitling the plaintiff to the $100 minimum. Id.,at 945, 947.

Nigh made no payments on the Blazer and returnedthe truck to Koons Buick. Id., at 123.On October 3, 2000, Nigh filed suit against Koons Buickalleging, among other things, a violation of TILA. Nighsought uncapped recovery of twice the finance charge, anamount equal to $24,192.80. Koons Buick urged a $1,000limitation on statutory damages under $ 1640(a)(2)(A)(i).The District Court held that damages were not capped at$1,000, and the jury awarded Nigh $24,192.80 (twice theamount of the finance charge). Id., at 121; App. inNo. 01-2201 etc. (CA4), pp. 653-655, 670, 756-757, 764.A divided panel of the Fourth Circuit affirmed. 319 F. 3d,at 126-129. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that it hadpreviously interpreted the $1,000 cap to apply to clauses(i) and (ii). Id., at 126; see Mars v. Spartanburg ChryslerPlymouth, Inc., 713 F. 2d, at 67. But the majority held that"by striking the `or' preceding (ii), and inserting (iii) afterthe `under this subparagraph' phrase," Congress had "rendered Mars' interpretation defunct." 319 F. 3d, at 126. According to the majority: "The inclusion of the new maximumand minimum in (iii) shows that the clause previously interpreted to apply to all of (A), can no longer apply to (A), butmust now apply solely to (ii), so as not to render meaningless543US1 Unit: $$U4 [03-06-07 11:47:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN59Cite as: 543 U. S. 50 (2004)Opinion of the Courtthe maximum and minimum articulated in (iii)." Id., at 127.2The Court of Appeals therefore allowed Nigh to recover thefull uncapped amount of $24,192.80 under clause (i).Judge Gregory dissented. The new clause (iii), he stated,operates as a specific "carve-out" for real estate transactionsfrom the general rule establishing the $100/$1,000 liabilitylimitation. Id., at 130, 132. Both parties acknowledged,and it was Fourth Circuit law underMars, 713 F. 2d 65, that,before 1995, the $100/$1,000 brackets applied to the entiresubparagraph. 319 F. 3d, at 130. Judge Gregory found "noevidence that Congress intended to override the Fourth Circuit's long-standing application of the $1,000 cap to both(2)(A)(i) and (2)(A)(ii)." Id., at 131. If the $1,000 cap applied only to clause (ii), the dissent reasoned, the phrase"under this subparagraph" in clause (ii) would be "superfluous," because "the meaning of (ii) would be unchanged byits deletion." Id., at 132. Moreover, Judge Gregory added,limiting the $1,000 cap to recoveries for consumer leasesunder clause (ii) would create an inconsistency within thestatute: The damages cap in clause (ii) would include the"under this subparagraph" modifier, but the cap in clause (iii)would not. Ibid.3We granted certiorari, 540 U. S. 1148 (2004), to resolve thedivision between the Fourth Circuit and the Seventh Circuiton the question whether the $100 floor and $1,000 ceilingapply to recoveries under $ 1640(a)(2)(A)(i). We now re2 The dissent adopts a similar structural argument to justify its conclusion that the $100/$1,000 brackets apply only to recoveries under clause(ii). See post, at 70-71.3 Judge Gregory noted that the phrase "under this subparagraph," asit appears in $ 1640(a)(2)(B), covering statutory damages in class actions,"indisputably applies to all of subparagraph (B)." 319 F. 3d 119, 132 (CA42003). "[T]he most logical interpretation of the statute," he concluded,"is to read the phrase `under this subparagraph' as applying generally toan entire subparagraph, either (A) or (B), and to read (2)(A)(iii) as creatinga specific carve-out from that general rule for real-estate transactions."Ibid.543US1 Unit: $$U4 [03-06-07 11:47:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN60 KOONS BUICK PONTIAC GMC, INC. v.

In this case, both the conventional meaning of"subparagraph" and standard interpretive guides point tothe same conclusion: The $1,000 cap applies to recoveriesunder clause (i).Congress ordinarily adheres to a hierarchical scheme insubdividing statutory sections. See L. Filson, The Legislative Drafter's Desk Reference 222 (1992) (hereinafter DeskReference). This hierarchy is set forth in drafting manualsprepared by the legislative counsel's offices in the House andthe Senate.

The word "subparagraph" is generally used to referto a subdivision preceded by a capital letter,5 and the word"clause" is generally used to refer to a subdivision precededby a lower case Roman numeral.6 Congress applied this hi-erarchy in $ 1640(a)(2)(B), which covers statutory damages inTILA class actions and states: "[T]he total recovery underthis subparagraph . . . shall not be more than the lesser4 These congressional drafting manuals, both postdating the 1995 TILAamendment, are consistent with earlier guides.

In 1995, Congressplainly meant "to establish a more generous minimum andmaximum" for closed-end mortgages. Strange, 129 F. 3d, at947. On that point, there is no disagreement. Had Con-gress simultaneously meant to repeal the longstanding $100/$1,000 limitation on $ 1640(a)(2)(A)(i), thereby confining the$100/$1,000 limitation solely to clause (ii), Congress likelywould have flagged that substantial change. At the veryleast, a Congress so minded might have stated in clause (ii):"liability under this clause."The statutory history resolves any ambiguity whether the$100/$1,000 brackets apply to recoveries under clause (i).7Before 1995, clauses (i) and (ii) set statutory damages for theentire realm of TILA-regulated consumer credit transac-tions. Closed-end mortgages were encompassed by clause(i). See, e. g., Mayfield v. Vanguard Sav. & Loan Assn., 710F. Supp., at 146. As a result of the addition of clause (iii),closed-end mortgages are subject to a higher floor and ceil-ing. But clause (iii) contains no other measure of damages.The specification of statutory damages in clause (i) of twicethe finance charge continues to apply to loans secured by realproperty as it does to loans secured by personal property.8Clause (iii) removes closed-end mortgages from clause (i)'sgovernance only to the extent that clause (iii) prescribes$200/$2,000 brackets in lieu of $100/$1,000.97 The five separate writings this Court has produced demonstrate that$ 1640(a)(2)(A) is hardly a model of the careful drafter's art.8 In consumer credit transactions in which a security interest is takenin the borrower's principal dwelling, the borrower also has a right to rescission under certain circumstances. $ 1635.9 The dissent's reading, we note, hinges on an assumed alteration in Congress' design, assertedly effected by the bare addition of "(iii)" and thetransposition of "or." See post, at 71-72, and n. 1. If Congress had notadded "(iii)" when it raised the cap on recovery for closed-end mortgages,the meaning of the amended text would be beyond debate. The limitations provision would read: "except that the liability under this subpara543US1 Unit: $$U4 [03-06-07 11:47:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN63Cite as: 543 U. S. 50 (2004)Opinion of the CourtThere is scant indication that Congress meant to alter themeaning of clause (i) when it added clause (iii). Cf. Churchof Scientology of Cal. v. IRS, 484 U. S. 9, 17-18 (1987) ("Allin all, we think this is a case where common sense suggests,by analogy to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's `dog that didn'tbark,' that an amendment having the effect petitioner ascribes to it would have been differently described by itssponsor, and not nearly as readily accepted by the floor manager of the bill."). By adding clause (iii), Congress soughtto provideincreased recovery when a TILA violation occursin the context of a loan secured by real property. See, e. g.,H. R. Rep. No. 104-193, p. 99 (1995) ("[T]his amendment in-creases the statutory damages available in closed end credittransactions secured by real property or a dwelling . . . .").But cf. post, at 75 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (hypothesizing thatfar from focusing onraising damages recoverable for closed-end mortgage transactions, Congress may have "focus[ed]more intently on limiting damages" for that category ofloans). "[T]here is no canon against using common sensein construing laws as saying what they obviously mean."Roschen v. Ward, 279 U. S. 337, 339 (1929) (Holmes, J.). Itwould be passing strange to read the statute to cap recoveryin connection with a closed-end, real-property-secured loanat an amount substantially lower than the recovery available when a violation occurs in the context of a personal-property-secured loan or an open-end, real-property-securedloan.10 The text does not dictate this result; the statutorygraph shall not be less than $100 nor greater than $1,000, or in the case ofan individual action relating to a credit transaction not under an open endcredit plan that is secured by real property or a dwelling, not less than$200 or greater than $2,000."10 This reading would lead to the anomalous result of double-thefinance-charge liability, uncapped by the fixed dollar limit, under clause(i) for an open-end loan secured by real property, while liability would becapped by clause (iii) at $2,000 for a closed-end loan secured by the samereal property. TILA does not in general apply to credit transactions inwhich the total amount financed exceeds $25,000, but this limit does not543US1 Unit: $$U4 [03-06-07 11:47:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN64 KOONS BUICK PONTIAC GMC, INC. v.
