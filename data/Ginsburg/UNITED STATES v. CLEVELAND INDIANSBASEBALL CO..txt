The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and theFederal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) impose excise taxeson employee wages to fund Social Security, Medicare, andunemployment compensation programs. This case concernsthe application of FICA and FUTA taxes to payments ofback wages. The Internal Revenue Service has consistentlymaintained that, for tax purposes, backpay awards should beattributed to the year the award is actually paid. Respondent Cleveland Indians Baseball Company (Company) urges,and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held, that suchawards must be allocated, as they are for purposes of SocialSecurity benefits eligibility, to the periods in which thewages should have been paid. According due respect to theService's reasonable, longstanding construction of the governing statutes and its own regulations, we hold that backwages are subject to FICA and FUTA taxes by reference tothe year the wages are in fact paid.IPursuant to a settlement of grievances asserted by theMajor League Baseball Players Association concerning players' free agency rights, several Major League Baseball clubsagreed to pay $280 million to players with valid claims forsalary damages. Under the agreement, the Company owed8 players a total of $610,000 in salary damages for 1986, andit owed 14 players a total of $1,457,848 in salary damagesfor 1987. The Company paid the awards in 1994. No awardrecipient was a Company employee in that year.*Lawrence T.

S. 200 (2001)Opinion of the CourtThis case concerns the proper FICA and FUTA tax treat-ment of the 1994 payments. Under FICA, both employeesand employers must pay tax on wages to fund Social Securityand Medicare; under FUTA, employers (but not employees)must pay tax on wages to fund unemployment benefits.For purposes of this litigation, the Government and theCompany stipulated that the settlement payments awardedto the players qualify as "wages" within the meaning ofFICA and FUTA. The question presented is whether thosepayments, characterized as back wages, should be taxedby reference to the year they were actually paid (1994), asthe Government urges, or by reference to the years theyshould have been paid (1986 and 1987), as the Company andits supporting amicus, the Major League Baseball PlayersAssociation, contend.In any given year, the amount of FICA and FUTA taxowed depends on two determinants. The first is the taxrate. 26 U. S. C. $$ 3101, 3111 (FICA), $ 3301 (FUTA). Thesecond is the statutory ceiling on taxable wages (also calledthe wage base), which limits the amount of annual wagessubject to tax. $ 3121(a)(1) (FICA), $ 3306(b)(1) (FUTA).Both determinants have increased over time. In 1986, theSocial Security tax on employees and employers was 5.7 percent on wages up to $42,000; 1 in 1987, it was 5.7 percent onwages up to $43,800; 2 and in 1994, 6.2 percent on wages upto $60,600.3 Although the Medicare tax on employees andemployers remained constant at 1.45 percent from 1986 to1994,4 the taxable wage base rose from $42,000 in 1986to $43,800 in 1987,5 and by 1994, Congress had abolished the1 26 U.

CLEVELAND INDIANSBASEBALL CO.Opinion of the Courtwage ceiling, thereby subjecting all wages to the Medicaretax.6 In 1986 and 1987, the FUTA tax was 6.0 percent onwages up to $7,000; 7 in 1994, it was 6.2 percent on wages upto $7,000.8In this case, allocating the 1994 payments back to 1986and 1987 works to the advantage of the Company and itsformer employees. The reason is that all but one of theemployees who received back wages in 1994 had alreadycollected wages from the Company exceeding the taxablemaximum in 1986 and 1987. Because those employees aswell as the Company paid the maximum amount of employment taxes chargeable in 1986 and 1987, allocating the 1994payments back to those years would generate no additionalFICA or FUTA tax liability. By contrast, treating the backwages as taxable in 1994 would subject both the Companyand its former employees to significant tax liability. TheCompany paid none of the employees any other wages in1994,9 and FICA and FUTA taxes attributable to that year6 26 U. S. C. $ 3121(a)(1).7 26 U. S. C. $$ 3301, 3306(b)(1) (1982 ed. and Supp. III).8 26 U. S. C. $$ 3301, 3306(b)(1).9 If a player received wages in 1994 from another employer in addition to receiving back wages from the Company, the player--but not theCompany--would be entitled to a credit or refund of any Social Securitytax paid in excess of the amount of tax due on a single taxable wagebase ($60,600). 26 U. S. C. $ 6413(c)(1). To illustrate, suppose a playerreceived $50,000 in back wages from the Cleveland Indians and an additional $50,000 in wages from the New York Mets in 1994. Assuming all$100,000 in wages are taxed in 1994, the player would be entitled to acredit or refund of Social Security tax paid in excess of the amount of taxdue on $60,600. By contrast, the Indians and the Mets would each beliable for Social Security taxes on $50,000 in wages paid to that player.26 U. S. C. $ 3111 (Social Security tax is "an excise tax, with respect tohaving individuals in his employ"). Thus, under the Government's proposed rule, the Cleveland Indians would owe Social Security taxes onall amounts up to $60,600 that it paid to each player in 1994, regardlessof whether the players themselves had reached or exceeded the $60,600ceiling through multiple wage sources.532US1 Unit: $U39 [09-05-02 19:25:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN207Cite as: 532 U. S. 200 (2001)Opinion of the Courtwould be calculated according to tax rates and wage baseshigher than their levels in 1986 and 1987.Uncertain about the proper rule of taxation, the Com-pany paid its share of employment taxes on the back wagesaccording to 1994 tax rates and wage bases. Its FICApayment totaled $99,382, and its FUTA payment totaled$1,008.10 After the Internal Revenue Service denied itsclaims for a refund of those payments, the Company initiatedthis action in District Court, relying on Bowman v. UnitedStates, 824 F. 2d 528 (CA6 1987). In Bowman, the SixthCircuit held that "[a] settlement for back wages should notbe allocated to the period when the employer finally paysbut `should be allocated to the periods when the regularwages were not paid as usual.' " Id., at 530 (quoting SocialSecurity Bd. v. Nierotko, 327 U. S. 358, 370 (1946)). TheDistrict Court, bound by Bowman, entered judgment for theCompany and ordered the Government to refund $97,202 inFICA and FUTA taxes.11On appeal, the Government observed that two Courtsof Appeals have held, in disagreement with Bowman, thatunder the law as implemented by Treasury Regulations,wages are to be taxed for FICA purposes in the year theyare actually received.Walker v. United States, 202 F. 3d1290, 1292-1293 (CA10 2000) (finding Nierotko "inapposite"and Bowman "unpersuasive"); Hemelt v. United States, 122F. 3d 204, 210 (CA4 1997) (finding it "clear under the Treasury Regulations that `wages' are to be taxed for FICA pur-poses in the year in which they are received"). The Court10 Although the Company also withheld $99,382 to pay the employees'share of FICA taxes, it does not seek to recover any taxes paid on behalfof the employees in this suit.11 This amount is slightly less than the total FICA and FUTA taxes paidby the Company in 1994. The reason is that one of the employees whoreceived a 1994 payment for wages due in 1987 received no wages fromthe Company in 1987. The Company thus owed a small amount of FICAand FUTA taxes on the back wages paid to him even when those wageswere allocated back to 1987.532US1 Unit: $U39 [09-05-02 19:25:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN208 UNITED STATES v. CLEVELAND INDIANSBASEBALL CO.Opinion of the Courtof Appeals for the Sixth Circuit nevertheless affirmed on theauthority of Bowman. 215 F. 3d 1325 (2000) ( judgt. order).We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict among theCourts of Appeals, 531 U. S. 943 (2000), and now reversethe Sixth Circuit's judgment.IIThe Internal Revenue Code imposes employment taxes"on every employer . . . equal to [a percentage of] wages . . .paid by him with respect to employment." 26 U. S. C.$$ 3111(a), 3111(b), 3301. The Social Security tax provision,$ 3111(a), contains a table prescribing tax rates applicable to"wages paid during" each year from 1984 onward (e. g., "Incases of wages paid during . . . 1990 or thereafter . . . [t]herate shall be . . . 6.2 percent."). The Medicare tax provision, $ 3111(b)(6), says "with respect to wages paid afterDecember 31, 1985, the rate shall be 1.45 percent." And theFUTA tax provision, 26 U. S. C. $ 3301 (1994 ed., Supp. IV),says the rate shall be "6.2 percent in the case of calendaryears 1988 through 2007 . . . of the total wages (as defined insection 3306(b)) paid by [the employer] during the calendaryear."Section 3121(a) of the Code establishes the annual ceiling on wages subject to Social Security tax. It does so bydefining "wages" to exclude any remuneration "paid to [an]individual by [an] employer during [a] calendar year" thatexceeds "remuneration . . . equal to the contribution andbenefit base . . . paid to [such] individual by [such] employerduring the calendar year with respect to which such contribution and benefit base is effective." Section 3306(b)(1)similarly limits annual wages subject to FUTA tax by excluding from "wages" any remuneration "paid to [an] individual by [an] employer during [a] calendar year" that exceeds"remuneration . . . equal to $7,000 . . . paid to [such] individualby [such] employer during [the] calendar year."532US1 Unit: $U39 [09-05-02 19:25:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN209Cite as: 532 U. S. 200 (2001)Opinion of the CourtBoth sides in this controversy have offered plausible inter-pretations of Congress' design. We set out next the parties'positions and explain why we ultimately defer to the In-ternal Revenue Service's reasonable, consistent, and longstanding interpretation of the FICA and FUTA provisionsin point. Under that interpretation, wages must be taxedaccording to the year they are actually paid.AIn the Government's view, the text of the controllingFICA and FUTA tax provisions explicitly instructs thatemployment taxes shall be computed by applying the taxrate and wage base in effect when wages are actually paid.In particular, the Government calls attention to the statute'sconstant references to wages paid during a calendar year asthe touchstone for determining the applicable tax rate andwage base. 26 U. S. C. $ 3111(a) (setting Social Security taxrates for "wages paid during" particular calendar years);$ 3121(a) (defining Social Security wage base in terms of"remuneration . . . paid . . . during the calendar year"); $ 3301(setting FUTA tax rate as a percentage of "wages . . .paid . . . during the calendar year"); $ 3306(b)(1) (definingFUTA wage base in terms of "remuneration . . . paid . . .during any calendar year"). The meaning of this language,the Government contends, is plain: Wages are taxed according to the calendar year they are in fact paid, regardlessof when they should have been paid.In support of this reading, the Government observes thatCongress chose the words in the current statute specificallyto replace language in the original 1935 Social Security Actproviding that FICA and FUTA tax rates applied to wagespaid or received "with respect to employment during thecalendar year." Social Security Act (1935 Act), $$ 801, 804,901, 49 Stat. 636-637, 639 (emphasis added). The TreasuryDepartment had interpreted this 1935 language to mean thatwages are taxed at "the rate in effectat the time of the532US1 Unit: $U39 [09-05-02 19:25:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN210 UNITED STATES v. CLEVELAND INDIANSBASEBALL CO.Opinion of the Courtperformance of the services for which the wages were paid."Treas. Regs. 91, Arts. 202, 302 (1936) (emphasis added). In1939, Congress amended the 1935 Act to provide that FICAand FUTA tax rates would no longer apply on the basis ofwhen services were performed, but would instead apply"with respect towages paid during the calendar yea[r]."Social Security Act Amendments of 1939 (1939 Amendments), $$ 604, 608, 53 Stat. 1383, 1387 (emphasis added).This 1939 language remains essentially unchanged in the current FICA and FUTA tax provisions, 26 U. S. C. $$ 3111(a)and 3301.Acknowledging that the 1939 Amendments establisheda "wages paid" rule for FICA and FUTA taxation, theCompany nevertheless argues that Social Security Bd. v.Nierotko, 327 U. S. 358 (1946), undermines the Government's plain language argument. According due weight toour precedent, we agree.In Nierotko, the National Labor Relations Board hadordered the reinstatement of a wrongfully discharged employee with "back pay" covering wages lost during theperiod from February 1937 to September 1939. Id., at 359.The employer paid the award in July 1941. Id., at 359-360.The primary question presented and aired in the Court'sopinion was whether backpay for a time in which the employee was not on the job should nevertheless count as"wages" in determining the employee's eligibility for SocialSecurity benefits. Id., at 359. Notwithstanding the contrary view of the Social Security Board and the Bureauof Internal Revenue, the Court held that backpay covering the wrongful discharge period met the definition of"wages" in the 1935 Act. Id., at 360-370.In the final two paragraphs of the Nierotko opinion, theCourt took up the question of how the backpay award shouldbe allocated for purposes of determining the worker's eligibility for benefits. As originally enacted, the Social Security Act extended benefits to persons over 65 who had532US1 Unit: $U39 [09-05-02 19:25:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN211Cite as: 532 U.

In 1939,however, Congress introduced a new scheme, which remainsin place today, tying eligibility for benefits to the numberof calendar-year "quarters of coverage" accumulated by anindividual. 1939 Amendments, $$ 209(g), (h), 53 Stat. 1376-1377 (codified at 42 U. S. C. $$ 413(a)(2), 414). Section 209(g)defined a "quarter of coverage" as either "a calendar quarterin which the individual has been paid not less than $50 inwages" or any quarter except the first "where an individualhas been paid in a calendar year $3,000 or more in wages."53 Stat. 1377.Nierotko swiftly dispatched the question whether " `backpay' must be allocated as wages . . . to the `calendar quarters'of the year in which the money would have been earned, ifthe employee had not been wrongfully discharged." 327U. S., at 370. Rejecting the Government's argument thatsuch allocation was impermissible because the 1939 Amendments to the benefits scheme refer to " `wages' to be `paid' incertain `quarters,' " id., at 370, and n. 25 (citing id., at 362,n. 7 (citing $ 209(g))), the Court concluded: "If, as we haveheld above, `back pay' is to be treated as wages, we have nodoubt that it should be allocated to the periods when theregular wages were not paid as usual." Id., at 370.Although the allocation question in Nierotko was a secondary issue addressed summarily by the Court, we think theCompany is correct that Nierotko undercuts the plain meaning argument urged by the Government here. Nierotkofound no conflict between an allocation-back rule for backpayand the language in $ 209(g) tying benefits eligibility to thenumber of calendar quarters "in which" a minimum amountof "wages" "has been paid." The Court's allocation holdingfor benefits eligibility purposes, which the Government doesnot urge us to overrule, Tr. of Oral Arg. 9, thus turned onan implicit construction of $ 209(g)'s terms--"wages" "paid""in" "a calendar quarter"--to include "regular wages" that532US1 Unit: $U39 [09-05-02 19:25:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN212 UNITED STATES v. CLEVELAND INDIANSBASEBALL CO.Opinion of the Courtshould have been paid but "were not paid as usual," 327 U. S.,at 370. Given this construction of $ 209(g), now codified in42 U. S. C. $ 413(a)(2), we cannot say that the FICA andFUTA provisions prescribing tax rates based on wages paidduring a calendar year, codified in 26 U. S. C. $$ 3111(a),3301, have a plain meaning that precludes allocation of backpay to the year it should have been paid. Cf. Hilton v.South Carolina Public Railways Comm'n, 502 U. S. 197, 205(1991) ("stare decisis is most compelling" where "a purequestion of statutory construction" is involved).BFrom here, we part ways with the Company. Althoughwe agree that Nierotko blocks the Government's argumentthat the "wages paid" formulation in 26 U. S. C. $$ 3111(a)and 3301 has a dispositively plain meaning, we reject theCompany's next contention. Because Nierotko read the1939 "wages paid" language for benefits eligibility purposesto accommodate an allocation-back rule for backpay, theCompany urges, the identical 1939 "wages paid" language fortax purposes must be read the same way. We do not agreethat the latter follows from the former like the night, the day.Nierotko dealt specifically and only with Social Securitybenefits eligibility, not with taxation. The Court's allocationholding in Nierotko in all likelihood reflected concern thatthe benefits scheme created in 1939 would be disserved byallowing an employer's wrongdoing to reduce the quartersof coverage an employee would otherwise be entitled toclaim toward eligibility. No similar concern underlies thetax provisions. Although Social Security taxes are used topay for Social Security benefits in the aggregate, there is nodirect relation between taxes and benefits at the level of anindividual employee. As the Company itself acknowledges,"Social Security tax `contributions,' unlike private pensioncontributions, do not create in the contributor a propertyright to benefits against the government, and wages rather532US1 Unit: $U39 [09-05-02 19:25:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN213Cite as: 532 U. S. 200 (2001)Opinion of the Courtthan [tax] contributions are the statutory basis for calcu-lating an individual's benefits." Brief for Respondent 14.Nierotko thus does not compel symmetrical constructionof the "wages paid" language in the discrete taxation andbenefits eligibility contexts. Although we generally pre-sume that "identical words used in different parts of thesame act are intended to have the same meaning," AtlanticCleaners & Dyers, Inc. v. United States, 286 U. S. 427, 433(1932), the presumption "is not rigid," and "the meaning[of the same words] well may vary to meet the purposes ofthe law," ibid. Cf. Cook, "Substance" and "Procedure" inthe Conflict of Laws, 42 Yale L. J. 333, 337 (1933) ("The tend-ency to assume that a word which appears in two or morelegal rules, and so in connection with more than one purpose,has and should have precisely the same scope in all ofthem . . . has all the tenacity of original sin and must con-stantly be guarded against."). The benefits scheme delineated in Title 42 would "no doubt" be set awry without anallocation-back rule for back wages, notwithstanding "accounting difficulties." Nierotko, 327 U. S., at 370. But thatsurely cannot be said for the taxation scheme described inTitle 26, where Congress' evident concern was not workereligibility for benefits, but fiscal administrability.1212 In determining that "accounting difficulties" were "not . . . insuperable" to its allocation holding, Nierotko noted that " `backpay' is nowtreated distributively" under $ 119 of the Revenue Act of 1943. 327 U. S.,at 370, and n. 26. Section 119 provided that backpay exceeding 15 percentof gross income may be allocated to earlier periods for income tax purposes if such allocation would reduce the taxpayer's liability. $ 119(a), 58Stat. 39. But Congress eliminated the 1943 backpay allocation rule in1964, see Pub. L. 88-272, $ 232(a), 78 Stat. 107, leaving behind the principle, "too firmly embedded in the income tax law to permit of any question," that "payments of compensation are income to a taxpayer on a cashbasis in the year of receipt, as distinguished from the year in which thecompensation is earned," 2 J. Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation$ 12.42, p. 179 (1973). The symmetry urged by the Company in construingthe tax and benefits provisions of FICA and FUTA thus comes only at theexpense of asymmetry in the collection of income taxes and employmenttaxes.532US1 Unit: $U39 [09-05-02 19:25:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN214 UNITED STATES v. CLEVELAND INDIANSBASEBALL CO.Opinion of the CourtThe 1939 Amendments adopting the "wages paid" rule fortaxation reflected Congress' worry that, as tax rates increase from year to year, "difficulties and confusion" wouldattend the taxation of wages payable in one year, but notactually paid until another year. S. Rep. No. 734, 76thCong., 1st Sess., 75-76; see also H. R. Rep. No. 728, 76thCong., 1st Sess., 57-58. Congress understood that an employee's annual compensation may be "based on a percentageof profits, or on future royalties, the amount of which cannotbe determined until long after the close of the year."S. Rep. No. 734, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., at 75. Requiring employers to "estimate unascertained amounts and pay taxesand contributions on that basis" would "cause a burden onemployers and administrative authorities alike." Id., at 75-76. Congress correctly anticipated that "[t]he placing of[FICA and FUTA] tax[es] on the `wages paid' basis [would]relieve this situation." Id., at 76. "Under the amendmentthe rate applicable would be the rate in effect at the timethat the wages are paid and received without reference tothe rate which was in effect at the time the services wereperformed." H. R. Rep. No. 728, supra, at 58.As an additional ground for construing the tax and benefitsprovisions in pari materia, the Company insists that Congress incorporated Nierotko's treatment of backpay into thetax provisions when it amended the Social Security Actshortly after Nierotko was decided. Prior to 1946, theFICA and FUTA wage bases had been defined in terms ofremuneration "paid . . . with respect to employment during"a given year. 1935 Act, $ 811(a), 49 Stat. 639 (FICA); 1939Amendments, $ 606, 53 Stat. 1383 (FUTA). Paralleling the1939 Amendments to the tax rate provisions, Congress in1946 established the current "wages paid" rule for identifying the wages that compose the FICA and FUTA wage basesin a given year.

S. 200 (2001)Opinion of the Court$ 209(a), which defines the Social Security wage base for pur-poses of benefits calculation, by adopting the "wages paid"language already present in $ 209(g), the provision construedinNierotko. $ 414, 60 Stat. 990-991. Congress also usedidentical "wages paid" language in redefining the FICA andFUTA wage bases for tax purposes. $ 412, 60 Stat. 989.Relying on the presumption that $ 209(a), as amended, incorporated Nierotko's construction of $ 209(g), see Cannon v.University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 696-699 (1979), and observing that Congress redefined the wage bases for taxationto "confor[m] with the changes in section 209(a)," S. Rep.No. 1862, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 36 (1946); H. R. Rep. No. 2447,79th Cong., 2d Sess., 35 (1946), the Company urges that theamended benefits and tax provisions codified Nierotko'sbackpay allocation rule.We are unpersuaded. Even assuming that the benefitsprovision, $ 209(a), is properly construed as incorporatingNierotko's reading of $ 209(g), we think the "confor[mity]"Congress sought to achieve between the tax and benefits provisions, S. Rep. No. 1862, supra, at 36; H. R. Rep.No. 2447, supra, at 35, had nothing to do with Nierotko'streatment of backpay. The Committee Reports make clearthat Congress' purpose in amending the FICA and FUTAwage bases was to define the "yardstick" for measuring"wages" as "the amount paid during the calendar year . . . ,without regard to the year in which the employment occurred." S. Rep. No. 1862, supra, at 35 (emphasis added);H. R. Rep. No. 2447, supra, at 35 (emphasis added). It iswith respect to this rule--measuring "wages" based on "theamount paid during the calendar year"--that Congresssought conformity between the Title 26 tax provisions andthe Title 42 benefits provision. See S. Rep. No. 1862, supra,at 36 (tax wage base), 37 (benefits wage base); H. R. Rep.No. 2447, supra, at 35 (tax wage base), 36 (benefits wagebase). Far from indicating an intent to codify Nierotko,those Reports suggest that Congress, if it considered532US1 Unit: $U39 [09-05-02 19:25:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN216 UNITED STATES v. CLEVELAND INDIANSBASEBALL CO.Opinion of the CourtNierotko at all, considered it an exception to the generalrule for measuring "wages" in a given year.13 Because theconcern that animates Nierotko's treatment of backpay inthe benefits context has no relevance to the tax side, supra,at 212-213, it makes no sense to attribute to Congress a de-sire for conformity not only with respect to the general rulefor measuring "wages," but also with respect to Nierotko'sbackpay exception.CWere the Company to rely solely on arguments for sym-metry in statutory construction, we would be inclined toconclude, given Nierotko's lack of concern with taxation,that the tax provisions themselves, informed by legislativepurpose, require back wages to be taxed according to theyear they are actually paid. But the Company has one morearrow in its quiver.Apart from its arguments for symmetry, the Companycontends that the Government's refusal to allocate backwages to the year they should have been paid creates in13 Indeed, the contemporaneous understanding of the Commissioner ofInternal Revenue was that the 1946 Amendments supplanted Nierotko'sallocation rule for backpay.

Nunan, Jr., Commissioner of Internal Revenue, to Social Security Administration, Bureauof Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (Mar. 6, 1947) ("The Nierotko decisionrequiring your Agency to make an allocation of the back pay award toprior periods was rendered on the basis of the law in effect at that time.The Social Security Act Amendments of 1946, having been enacted subsequent to the date of the Nierotko decision, must be interpreted in thelight of the language contained in such Amendments and the Congressional intent.") (available in Lodging for Respondent, Exh. F). Nevertheless, for benefits eligibility and calculation purposes, the Social SecurityAdministration (SSA) by regulation continues to apply the Nierotko ruleto "[b]ack pay under a statute," 20 CFR $ 404.1242(b) (2000) (such backpay"is allocated to the periods of time in which it should have been paidif the employer had not violated the statute"), while declining to applyNierotko to "[b]ack pay not under a statute," $ 404.1242(c) ("This back paycannot be allocated to prior periods of time but must be reported by theemployer for the period in which it is paid.").532US1 Unit: $U39 [09-05-02 19:25:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN217Cite as: 532 U. S. 200 (2001)Opinion of the Courtequities in taxation and incentives for strategic behaviorthat Congress did not intend. This contention is not without force. Under the Government's rule, an employee whoshould have been paid $100,000 in 1986, but is instead paid$50,000 in 1986 and $50,000 in backpay in 1994, would owemore tax than if she had been paid the full $100,000 duein 1986. Conversely, a wrongdoing employer who shouldhave paid an employee $50,000 in each of five years coveredby a $250,000 backpay award would pay only one year'sworth of employment taxes (limited by the annual ceilingson taxable wages) in the year the award is actually paid.The Government's rule thus appears to exempt some wagesthat should be taxed and to tax some wages that shouldbe exempt.Applying the Government's rule to other provisions of theCode produces similar anomalies. Section 3121(a)(4), for example, exempts disability benefits from FICA tax if paid byan employer to an employee more than six months after theemployee worked for the employer. 26 U. S. C. $ 3121(a)(4).Disability benefits included in a backpay award would beexempt from FICA tax if the employee had not worked forthe employer for six months prior to the backpay award,even if the benefits should have been paid within six monthsafter the employee stopped working for the employer. According to the Company, such results amount to tax windfalls and invite employers wrongfully to withhold pay orbenefits in order to reap the advantages of a strategicallytimed payment. See Brief for Respondent 33-40 (additionalexamples of windfalls and avoidance schemes). These outcomes may be avoided, the Company argues, by construingthe tax provisions to require taxation of back wages according to the year the wages should have been paid.It is, of course, true that statutory construction "is a holistic endeavor" and that the meaning of a provision is "clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme . . . [when]only one of the permissible meanings produces a substantive532US1 Unit: $U39 [09-05-02 19:25:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN218 UNITED STATES v.

The Company's examplesleave little doubt that the Government's rule generates a degree of arbitrariness in the operation of the tax statutes.But in Nierotko's context, an inflexible rule allocating backpay to the year it is actually paid would never work to theemployee's advantage; it could inureonly to the detrimentof the employee, counter to the thrust of the benefits eligibility provisions.14 In this case, by contrast, there is nocomparable structural unfairness in taxation. The Government's rule sometimes disadvantages the taxpayer, as inthis case. Other times it works to the disadvantage of thefisc, as the Company's examples show. The anomalous re-sults to which the Company points must be considered inlight of Congress' evident interest in reducing complexityand minimizing administrative confusion within the FICAand FUTA tax schemes. See supra, at 214. Given thepractical administrability concerns that underpin the taxprovisions, we cannot say that the Government's rule is in-compatible with the statutory scheme. The most we can sayis that Congress intended the tax provisions to be both effi-ciently administrable and fair, and that this case reveals thetension that sometimes exists when Congress seeks to meetthose twin aims.DConfronted with this tension, "we do not sit as a committeeof revision to perfect the administration of the tax laws."United States v. Correll, 389 U. S. 299, 306-307 (1967). In14 The SSA has interpreted its regulation governing "[b]ack pay undera statute," 20 CFR $ 404.1242(b) (2000), to allow the employee to choosewhether to allocate the backpay to the year it is paid or to the year itshould have been paid.
