This case concerns the Indian Mineral Leasing Act of 1938(IMLA), 52 Stat. 347, 25 U. S. C. $ 396aet seq., and the roleit assigns to the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) withrespect to coal leases executed by an Indian Tribe and a pri-vate lessee. The controversy centers on 1987 amendmentsto a 1964 coal lease entered into by the predecessor ofPeabody Coal Company (Peabody) and the Navajo Nation(Tribe), a federally recognized Indian Tribe. The Tribeseeks to recover money damages from the United States foran alleged breach of trust in connection with the Secretary'sapproval of coal lease amendments negotiated by the Tribeand Peabody. This Court's decisions in United States v.Mitchell, 445 U. S. 535 (1980) (Mitchell I), and United Statesv. Mitchell, 463 U. S. 206 (1983) (Mitchell II), control thiscase. Concluding that the controversy here falls withinMitchell I's domain, we hold that the Tribe's claim for compensation from the Federal Government fails, for it does notderive from any liability-imposing provision of the IMLA orits implementing regulations.IAThe IMLA, which governs aspects of mineral leasing onIndian tribal lands, states that "unallotted lands within anyIndian reservation," or otherwise under federal jurisdiction,"may, with the approval of the Secretary . . . , be leased formining purposes, by authority of the tribal council or otherauthorized spokesmen for such Indians, for terms not toexceed ten years and as long thereafter as minerals areproduced in paying quantities." $ 396a.

B. L. A. 269, 311 (1997).Prior to enactment of the IMLA, decisions whether togrant mineral leases on Indian land generally rested withthe Government. See, e. g., Act of June 30, 1919, ch. 4, $ 26,41 Stat. 31, as amended, 25 U. S. C. $ 399; see also infra, at509 (describing $ 399). Indian consent was not required, andleases were sometimes granted over tribal objections. SeeH. R. Rep. No. 1872, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., 2 (1938); S. Rep.No. 985, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1937); 46 Fed. Cl. 217, 230(2000). The IMLA, designed to advance tribal independence, empowers Tribes to negotiate mining leases themselves, and, as to coal leasing, assigns primarily an approvalrole to the Secretary.Although the IMLA covers mineral leasing generally, in anumber of discrete provisions it deals particularly with oiland gas leases. See 25 U. S. C. $ 396b (requirements forpublic auctions of oil and gas leases); $ 396d (oil and gasleases are "subject to the terms of any reasonable cooperative unit or other plan approved or prescribed by [the] Secretary"); $ 396g ("[T]o avoid waste or to promote the conservation of natural resources or the welfare of the Indians,"the Secretary may approve leases of Indian lands "for thesubsurface storage of oil and gas."). The IMLA containsno similarly specific prescriptions for coal leases; it simplyremits coal leases, in common with all mineral leases, tothe governance of rules and regulations promulgated by theSecretary. $ 396d.During all times relevant here, the IMLA regulations provided that "Indian tribes . . . may, with the approval of theSecretary . . . or his authorized representative, lease theirland for mining purposes." 25 CFR $ 211.2 (1985). In linewith the IMLA itself, the regulations treated oil and gasleases in more detail than coal leases. The regulations re537US2 Unit: $U25 [04-14-04 21:42:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN495Cite as: 537 U.

No other limitation was placed on the Tribe'snegotiating capacity or the Secretary's approval authority.1BThe Tribe involved in this case occupies the largest Indianreservation in the United States. Over the past century,large deposits of coal have been discovered on the Tribe'sreservation lands, which are held for it in trust by the UnitedStates. Each year, the Tribe receives millions of dollars inroyalty payments pursuant to mineral leases with privatecompanies.Peabody mines coal on the Tribe's lands pursuant to leasescovered by the IMLA. This case principally concerns Lease8580 (Lease or Lease 8580), which took effect upon approvalby the Secretary in 1964. App. 188-220. The Lease estab-lished a maximum royalty rate of 37.5 cents per ton of coal,id., at 191, but made that figure "subject to reasonable ad-justment by the Secretary of the Interior or his authorizedrepresentative" on the 20-year anniversary of the Lease andevery ten years thereafter,id., at 194.As the 20-year anniversary of Lease 8580 approached, itsroyalty rate of 37.5 cents per ton yielded for the Tribe only"about 2% of gross proceeds." 263 F. 3d 1325, 1327 (CA Fed.2001). This return was higher than the ten cents per tonminimum established by the then-applicable IMLA regula1 In 1996, well after the events at issue here, the minimum rate on newcoal leases was increased to "121/2 percent of the value of productionproduced and sold from the lease." 61 Fed. Reg. 35658 (1996); 25 CFR$ 211.43(a)(2) (1997). The amended regulations further state, however,that "[a] lower royalty rate shall be allowed if it is determined to be inthe best interest of the Indian mineral owner." $ 211.43(b).537US2 Unit: $U25 [04-14-04 21:42:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN496 UNITED STATES v.

It was substantiallylower, however, than the 121/2 percent of gross proceeds rateCongress established in 1977 as the minimum permissibleroyalty for coal mined on federal lands under the MineralLeasing Act. See Pub. L. 94-377, $ 6, 90 Stat. 1087, asamended, 30 U. S. C. $ 207(a). For some years starting inthe 1970's, to gain a more favorable return, the Tribe endeav-ored to renegotiate existing mineral leases with private lessees, including Peabody. See App. 138-139, 143-144.In March 1984, the Chairman of the Navajo Tribal Councilwrote to the Secretary asking him to exercise his contractually conferred authority to adjust the royalty rate underLease 8580. On June 18, 1984, the Director of the Bureauof Indian Affairs for the Navajo Area, acting pursuant toauthority delegated by the Secretary, sent Peabody an opinion letter raising the rate to 20 percent of gross proceeds.Id., at 8-9.Contesting the Area Director's rate determination, Pea-body filed an administrative appeal in July 1984, pursuant to25 CFR $ 2.3(a) (1985). 46 Fed. Cl., at 222.2 The appeal wasreferred to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Indian Af-fairs, John Fritz, then acting as both Commissioner of IndianAffairs and Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs, 263 F. 3d,at 1328. In March 1985, Fritz permitted Peabody to supplement its brief and requested additional cost, revenue, andinvestment data. 46 Fed. Cl., at 222. He thereafter appeared ready to reject Peabody's appeal. Ibid.; App. 89-97(undated draft letter).

Id., at98-100. A copy of Peabody's letter was sent to the Tribe,id., at 100, which then submitted its own letter urging theSecretary to reject Peabody's request and to secure the Department's prompt release of a decision in the Tribe's favor,id., at 119-121.

Facing "severe economic pressure," 263F. 3d, at 1328; App. 355-356, the Tribe resumed negotiationswith Peabody in August 1985, 46 Fed. Cl., at 223.On September 23, 1985, the parties reached a tentativeagreement on a package of amendments to Lease 8580.Ibid.5 They agreed to raise the royalty rate to 121/2 percentof monthly gross proceeds, and to make the new rate retroactive to February 1, 1984. App. 287. The 121/2 percent ratewas at the time customary for leases to mine coal on federallands and on Indian lands.6 The amendments acknowledged4 The Deputy Assistant Secretary's draft opinion letter stated that theruling "is based on the exercise of my discretionary authority and is finalfor the Department." App. 97. Had the letter issued, Peabody wouldnot have been entitled to seek further review by the Board. See 25 CFR$ 2.19(c)(2) (1985) (the Board may review decisions by the Commissionerof Indian Affairs only if the decision states that it "is based on interpretation of law"); see also supra, at 496 (Deputy Assistant Secretary was acting as the Commissioner of Indian Affairs). But even if the opinion letterhad issued as drafted, Peabody could have asked Secretary Hodel to exercise his "authority to review any decision of any employee or employees ofthe Department." 43 CFR $ 4.5(a)(2) (1985). The Secretary could have"render[ed] the final decision" himself, $ 4.5(a)(1), or "direct[ed the DeputyAssistant Secretary] to reconsider [his] decision," $ 4.5(a)(2).5 The parties also agreed to raise the royalty rate under another leasenot in issue here, which covered coal located within a former joint usearea shared by the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Tribe. 46 Fed.

The Tribe identifiesa single federal coal lease with a royalty rate of 17.08 percent, see Brieffor Respondent 11, but, as the Government points out, that lease was "partof an experimental leasing policy tried by the Department for a shorttime," Reply Brief 12, n. 7 (quoting Peabody Coal Co., 93 I. B. L. A. 317,320 (1986)). Between 1984 and 1988, the Department of the Interior'spractice was not to approve IMLA leases with royalties less than the minimum rate for federal coal, i. e., 121/2 percent. See App. in No. 00-5086(CA Fed.), p. A1872. As late as 1996 the customary royalty rate forcoal leases on Indian lands issued or readjusted after 1976 did not exceed121/2 percent. See Department of Interior, Minerals Management Serv.,Mineral Revenues 1996, Report on Receipts from Federal and IndianLeases 128 (Table 47) (Jan. 2, 2003), http://www.mrm.mms.gov/stats/pdfdocs/mrr96fin.pdf (available in Clerk of Court's case file).The Tribe argues, in its presentation to this Court, that the 121/2 percentprovided in amended Lease 8580 is only a "facial royalty rate," Brief forRespondent 11, and that the actual rate is lower, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 33.That assertion is based in part on the Tribe's agreement under theamended Lease to relinquish its claim for $33 million in back taxes and$56 million in back royalties, see 46 Fed. Cl., at 224, and in part on proposed findings of fact the Tribe submitted to the Court of Federal Claims,which the Government did not specifically dispute. See App. in No.00-5086 (CA Fed.), pp. A2703-A2727. The proposed findings stated thata provision in the amended Lease "signifying a non-standard method ofcalculating the royalty," App. 180 (Proposed Findings || 314), "resultedin royalty payments lower than the minimum allowable for federal coal,"id., at 181 (Proposed Findings || 315). To the extent the Tribe here assailsthe Secretary's approval of Lease 8580 as inconsistent with the thenprevailing federal policy not to approve rates below 121/2 percent, we donot pursue the point, for the Tribe failed to rely on it below. See 46 Fed.Cl., at 233 ("[T]here is no claim by the [Tribe] that the [Secretary's] 1987approval of Lease 8580 . . . ran afoul of th[e] [federal] policy" of not approving IMLA leases with royalty rates of less than 121/2 percent.).7 Before this Court's decision in Kerr-McGee Corp. v. Navajo Tribe, 471U. S. 195 (1985), it was unsettled whether the Tribe could levy taxes without the approval of the Secretary of the Interior. The imposition ofa severance tax, of course, augmented the amount payable by the lessee537US2 Unit: $U25 [04-14-04 21:42:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN500 UNITED STATES v.

Id., at 292-293. The agreement "also addressed ancillary matters suchas provisions for future royalty adjustments, arbitration procedures, rights of way, the establishment of a tribal scholarship fund, and the payment by Peabody of back royalties,bonuses, and water payments." 46 Fed. Cl., at 224. "Inconsideration of the benefits associated with these leaseamendments," the parties agreed to move jointly to vacatethe Area Director's June 1984 decision, which had raised theroyalty to 20 percent. App. 286.In August 1987, the Navajo Tribal Council approved theamendments. 46 Fed. Cl., at 224. The parties signed afinal agreement in November 1987, App. 309, and SecretaryHodel approved it on December 14, 1987, id., at 337-339.Shortly thereafter, pursuant to the parties' stipulation, theArea Director's decision was vacated. 46 Fed. Cl., at 224.In 1993, the Tribe brought suit against the United Statesin the Court of Federal Claims, alleging, inter alia, that theSecretary's approval of the amendments to the Lease constituted a breach of trust.

But seeTr. of Oral Arg. 43-44 ("[W]e can't tax 60 percent of the coal because itgoes to the Navajo [G]enerating [S]tation which has a tax waiver in theplant site lease.").8 The Tribe has filed a separate action against Peabody, claiming improper influence over the Government's actions with respect to the Lease.See Navajo Nation v. Peabody Holding Co., Civ. Action No. 99-469 (D. C.,June 24, 2002). The Tribe's complaint in that action alleges violations ofthe federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18U. S. C. $ 1961 et seq., and related wrongdoing, inter alia, breach of contract, interference with fiduciary relationship, conspiracy, and fraudulentconcealment. See Navajo Nation v.

S. 488 (2003)Opinion of the CourtThe Court of Federal Claims granted summary judgmentfor the United States. 46 Fed. Cl. 217 (2000). In no uncertain terms, that court found that the Government owed general fiduciary duties to the Tribe, which, in its view, theSecretary had flagrantly dishonored by acting in the bestinterests of Peabody rather than the Tribe. Nevertheless,the court concluded that the Tribe had entirely failed to linkthat breach of duty to any statutory or regulatory obligationwhich could "be fairly interpreted as mandating compensation for the government's fiduciary wrongs." Id., at 236.Accordingly, the court held that the United States was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.9The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed.263 F. 3d 1325 (2001). The Government's liability to theTribe, it said, turned on whether "the United States controlsthe Indian resources." Id., at 1329. Relying on 25 U. S. C.$ 399 and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Court ofAppeals determined that the measure of control the Secretary exercised over the leasing of Indian lands for mineraldevelopment sufficed to warrant a money judgment againstthe United States for breaches of fiduciary duties connectedto coal leasing. 263 F. 3d, at 1330-1332. But see infra,at 509. The appeals court agreed with the Federal ClaimsCourt that the Secretary's actions regarding Peabody's administrative appeal violated the Government's fiduciary obligations to the Tribe, in that those actions "suppress[ed] andconceal[ed]" the decision of the Deputy Assistant Secretary,and "thereby favor[ed] Peabody interests to the detrimentof Navajo interests." 263 F. 3d, at 1332. Based on these9 The Court of Federal Claims also rejected the Tribe's claim for breachof contract, determining that the Secretary was not a party to the Leaseand that his contractual authority to adjust the Lease-specified royaltyrate carried with it no obligation to do so. 46 Fed. Cl., at 234-236. TheTribe did not appeal that ruling.537US2 Unit: $U25 [04-14-04 21:42:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN502 UNITED STATES v.

A damages remedy, we explained, would "furthe[r] the purposes of the statutes and regulations, which537US2 Unit: $U25 [04-14-04 21:42:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN506 UNITED STATES v. NAVAJO NATIONOpinion of the Courtclearly require that the Secretary manage Indian resourcesso as to generate proceeds for the Indians." Id., at 226-227.To state a claim cognizable under the Indian Tucker Act,Mitchell I and Mitchell II thus instruct, a Tribe must identify a substantive source of law that establishes specific fidu-ciary or other duties, and allege that the Government hasfailed faithfully to perform those duties. See 463 U. S., at216-217, 219. If that threshold is passed, the court mustthen determine whether the relevant source of substantivelaw "can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation fordamages sustained as a result of a breach of the duties [thegoverning law] impose[s]."Id., at 219. Although "the un-disputed existence of a general trust relationship betweenthe United States and the Indian people" can "reinforc[e]"the conclusion that the relevant statute or regulation imposes fiduciary duties, id., at 225, that relationship alone isinsufficient to support jurisdiction under the Indian TuckerAct. Instead, the analysis must train on specific rights-creating or duty-imposing statutory or regulatory prescriptions. Those prescriptions need not, however, expresslyprovide for money damages; the availability of such damagesmay be inferred. See id., at 217, n. 16 ("[T]he substantivesource of law may grant the claimant a right to recover damages either expressly or by implication." (internal quotationmarks and citation omitted)).CWe now consider whether the IMLA and its implementingregulations can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation for the Government's alleged breach of trust in thiscase. We conclude that they cannot.1The Tribe's principal contention is that the IMLA's statu-tory and regulatory scheme, viewed in its entirety, attaches537US2 Unit: $U25 [04-14-04 21:42:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN507Cite as: 537 U. S. 488 (2003)Opinion of the Courtfiduciary duties to each Government function under thatscheme, and that the Secretary acted in contravention ofthose duties by approving the 121/2 percent royalty containedin the amended Lease. See, e. g., Brief for Respondent 20,30-38. We read the IMLA differently. As we see it, thestatute and regulations at issue do not provide the requisite"substantive law" that "mandat[es] compensation by the Federal Government." Mitchell II, 463 U. S., at 218.The IMLA and its implementing regulations impose no obligations resembling the detailed fiduciary responsibilitiesthat Mitchell II found adequate to support a claim for moneydamages.11 The IMLA simply requires Secretarial approvalbefore coal mining leases negotiated between Tribes andthird parties become effective, 25 U. S. C. $ 396a, and authorizes the Secretary generally to promulgate regulations governing mining operations, $ 396d. Yet the dissent concludesthat the IMLA imposes "one or more specific statutory obligations, as in Mitchell II, at the level of fiduciary duty whosebreach is compensable in damages." Post, at 521. The endeavor to align this case with Mitchell II rather than Mitchell I, however valiant, falls short of the mark. Unlike the"elaborate" provisions before the Court in Mitchell II, 463U. S., at 225, the IMLA and its regulations do not "give theFederal Government full responsibility to manage Indianresources . . . for the benefit of the Indians," id., at 224. TheSecretary is neither assigned a comprehensive managerialrole nor, at the time relevant here, expressly invested withresponsibility to secure "the needs and best interests of the11 We rule only on the Government's role in the coal leasing processunder the IMLA. As earlier recounted, see supra, at 494, both the IMLAand its implementing regulations address oil and gas leases in considerablymore detail than coal leases. Whether the Secretary has fiduciary orother obligations, enforceable in an action for money damages, with respect to oil and gas leases is not before us.537US2 Unit: $U25 [04-14-04 21:42:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN508 UNITED STATES v. NAVAJO NATIONOpinion of the CourtIndian owner and his heirs." Ibid. (internal quotationmarks omitted) (quoting 25 U. S. C. $ 406(a)).12Instead, the Secretary's involvement in coal leasing underthe IMLA more closely resembles the role provided for theGovernment by the GAA regarding allotted forest lands.See Mitchell I, 445 U. S., at 540-544. Although the GAArequired the Government to hold allotted land "in trust forthe sole use and benefit of the Indian to whom such allotmentshall have been made," id., at 541 (quoting 25 U. S. C. $ 348),that Act did not "authoriz[e], much less requir[e], the Government to manage timber resources for the benefit of Indianallottees," Mitchell I, 445 U. S., at 545. Similarly here, theIMLA and its regulations do not assign to the Secretarymanagerial control over coal leasing. Nor do they even es-tablish the "limited trust relationship,"id., at 542, existingunder the GAA; no provision of the IMLA or its regulationscontainsany trust language with respect to coal leasing.Moreover, as in Mitchell I, imposing fiduciary duties onthe Government here would be out of line with one of thestatute's principal purposes. The GAA was designed sothat "the allottee, and not the United States, . . . [would]manage the land."Id., at 543. Imposing upon the Government a fiduciary duty to oversee the management of allottedlands would not have served that purpose. So too here.The IMLA aims to enhance tribal self-determination by giv-ing Tribes, not the Government, the lead role in negotiatingmining leases with third parties. See supra, at 494. As theCourt of Federal Claims recognized, "[t]he ideal of Indianself-determination is directly at odds with Secretarial controlover leasing." 46 Fed. Cl., at 230.12 Both the Tribe and the dissent refer to portions of 25 CFR pt. 211that require administrative decisions affecting tribal mineral interests tobe made in the best interests of the tribal mineral owner. See Brief forRespondent 27, 31; post, at 516-517. We note, however, that the referenced regulatory provisions were adopted more than a decade after theevents at issue in this case. See 61 Fed. Reg. 35653 (1996).537US2 Unit: $U25 [04-14-04 21:42:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN509Cite as: 537 U. S. 488 (2003)Opinion of the Court2The Tribe nevertheless argues that the actions of the Sec-retary targeted in this case violated discrete statutory andregulatory provisions whose breach is redressable in an ac-tion for damages. In this regard, the Tribe relies extensively on 25 U. S. C. $ 399, see, e. g., Brief for Respondent22-23, 30-31, upon which the Court of Appeals placed considerable weight as well, see 263 F. 3d, at 1330-1331; supra,at 501. That provision, however, is not part of the IMLAand does not govern Lease 8580. Enacted almost 20 yearsbefore the IMLA, $ 399 authorizesthe Secretary to lease cer-tain unallotted Indian lands for mining purposes on termsshe sets, and does not provide for input from the Tribes con-cerned. Seesupra, at 494. In exercising that authority,the Secretary is authorized to "perform any and all acts . . .as may be necessary and proper for the protection of theinterests of the Indians and for the purpose of carrying theprovisions of this section into full force and effect." $ 399.But that provision describes the Secretary's leasing authority under $ 399; it does not bear on the Secretary's more lim-ited approval role under the IMLA.Similarly unavailing is the Tribe's reliance on the IndianMineral Development Act of 1982 (IMDA), 25 U. S. C. $ 2101et seq. See Brief for Respondent 23-24, 30. The IMDAgoverns the Secretary's approval of agreements for the development of certain Indian mineral resources through ex-ploration and like activities. It does not establish standardsgoverning the Secretary's approval of mining leases negoti-ated by a Tribe and a third party. The Lease in this case,in short, falls outside the IMDA's domain. See Reply Brief12-13.Citing 25 U. S. C. $ 396a, the IMLA's general prescription,seesupra, at 493, the Tribe next asserts that the Secretaryviolated his "duty to review and approve any proposed coallease with care to promote IMLA's basic purpose and the[Tribe's] best interests." Brief for Respondent 39. To sup537US2 Unit: $U25 [04-14-04 21:42:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN510 UNITED STATES v. NAVAJO NATIONOpinion of the Courtport that assertion, the Tribe points to various Governmentreports identifying 20 percent as the appropriate royalty, seeid., at 5-7, 15, and to the Secretary's decision, made afterreceiving ex parte communications from Peabody, to withhold departmental action, see id., at 9-10, 15.In the circumstances presented, the Tribe maintains, theSecretary's eventual approval of the 121/2 percent royalty violated his duties under $ 396a in two ways. First, the Secretary's approval was "improvident," Tr. of Oral Arg. 48, because it allowed the Tribe's coal "to be conveyed for what[the Secretary] knew to be about half of its value," id., at 49.Second, Secretary Hodel's intervention into the Lease adjustment process "skewed the bargaining" by depriving theTribe of the 20 percent rate, rendering the Secretary's subsequent approval of the 121/2 percent rate "unfair." Id., at 50.The Tribe's vigorously pressed arguments headlining$ 396a fare no better than its arguments tied to $ 399 and theIMDA; the $ 396a arguments fail, for they assume substantive prescriptions not found in that provision.13 As to the"improviden[ce]" of the Secretary's approval, the Tribe canpoint to no guides or standards circumscribing the Secretary's affirmation of coal mining leases negotiated between aTribe and a private lessee. Regulations under the IMLA ineffect in 1987 established a minimum royalty of ten cents perton. See 25 CFR $ 211.15(c) (1985). But the royalty contained in Lease 8580 well exceeded that regulatory floor.13 The Lease itself authorized the Secretary to make "reasonable [royalty] adjustment[s]." App. 194. As noted above, however, see supra, at501, n. 9, the Court of Federal Claims determined, and the Tribe does nothere dispute, that the Secretary is not a signatory to the Lease and thatthe Lease is not contractually binding on him. See 46 Fed. Cl., at 234-236. We thus perceive no basis for infusing the Secretary's approvalfunction under $ 396a with substantive standards that might be derivedfrom his adjustment authority under the Lease, and certainly no basis forconcluding that an alleged "breach" of those standards is cognizable in anaction for money damages under the Indian Tucker Act.537US2 Unit: $U25 [04-14-04 21:42:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN511Cite as: 537 U. S. 488 (2003)Opinion of the CourtSee supra, at 495-496.14 At the time the Secretary ap-proved the amended Lease, it bears repetition, 121/2 percentwas the rate the United States itself customarily receivedfrom leases to mine coal on federal lands. Similarly, the customary rate for coal leases on Indian lands issued or re-adjusted after 1976 did not exceed 121/2 percent. See supra,at 498-499, n. 6.15In sum, neither the IMLA nor any of its regulations establishes anything more than a bare minimum royalty. Hence,there is no textual basis for concluding that the Secretary'sapproval function includes a duty, enforceable in an actionfor money damages, to ensure a higher rate of return forthe Tribe concerned. Similarly, no pertinent statutory orregulatory provision requires the Secretary, on pain of damages, to conduct an independent "economic analysis" of thereasonableness of the royalty to which a Tribe and thirdparty have agreed. 263 F. 3d, at 1340 (concurring opinionbelow, finding such a duty).1614 Because the Tribe does not contend that the amended Lease failed tomeet the minimum royalty under the regulations then in effect, we neednot decide whether the Secretary's approval of such a lease would triggermoney damages. See Reply Brief 15 ("The Court may . . . assume forpresent purposes that a failure by the Secretary to ensure, prior to approving a proposed lease, that its terms (or amendments) comply with theregulation specifying the minimum royalty rate to which the parties mayagree would support a claim under the Tucker Act.").15 Under 30 U. S. C. $ 207(a), that customary rate was also a statutorilydefined minimum for federal coal leases. See supra, at 498-499, n. 6.Section 207(a), which applies to federal lands in general, did not apply toleases of Indian lands until 1996, when 25 CFR $ 211.43(a)(2) was promulgated. See Reply Brief 13-14. At the pre-1996 times relevant here, thesole specific provision governing Tribe-private lessee coal leases was theten cents per ton minimum prescribed in 25 CFR $ 211.15(c) (1985).16 Citing language from the legislative history, the dissent stresses thatthe IMLA aimed in part to "give the Indians the greatest return fromtheir property," post, at 516 (quoting S. Rep. No. 985, 75th Cong., 1st Sess.,2 (1937)), and suggests that the Secretary's approval role encompasses anenforceable duty to further that objective, see post, at 517. We have cautioned against according "talismanic effect" to the Senate Report's "reference to `the greatest return from [Indian] property,' " and have observed537US2 Unit: $U25 [04-14-04 21:42:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN512 UNITED STATES v. NAVAJO NATIONOpinion of the CourtThe Tribe's second argument under $ 396a concentrates onthe "skew[ing]" effect of Secretary Hodel's 1985 intervention,i. e., his direction to Deputy Assistant Secretary Fritz towithhold action on Peabody's appeal from the Area Director's decision setting a royalty rate of 20 percent. Tr. ofOral Arg. 50; see supra, at 497-498. The Secretary's actions, both in intervening in the administrative appeal proc-ess, and in approving the amended Lease, the Tribe urges,were not based upon an assessment of the merits of the roy-alty issue; instead, the Tribe maintains, they were attributable entirely to the undue influence Peabody exerted throughex parte communications with the Secretary. See Brief forRespondent 40-42. Underscoring that the Tribe had noknowledge of those communications or of Secretary Hodel'sdirection to Fritz, see supra, at 498, the Tribe asserts thatits bargaining position was seriously compromised when itresumed negotiations with Peabody in 1985. See, e. g., Tr. ofthat it "overstates" Congress' aim to attribute to the Legislature a purpose "to guarantee Indian tribes the maximum profit available." CottonPetroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490 U. S. 163, 179 (1989). Beyond doubt,the IMLA was designed "to provide Indian tribes with a profitable sourceof revenue." Ibid., quoted supra, at 493. But Congress had as a concreteobjective in that regard the removal of certain impediments that had applied particularly to mineral leases on Indian land. See Cotton, 490 U. S.,at 179 ("Congress was . . . concerned . . . with matters such as the unavailability of extralateral mineral rights on Indian land."); S. Rep. No. 985, at2 ("[O]n the public domain the discoverer of a mineral deposit gets extralateral rights and can follow the ore beyond the side lines indefinitely,while on the Indian lands under the act of June 30, 1919, he is limited tothe confines of the survey markers not to exceed 600 feet by 1,500 feet inany one claim. The draft of the bill herewith would permit the obtainingof sufficient acreage to remove the necessity for extralateral rights withall its attending controversies."); H. R. Rep. No. 1872, 75th Cong., 3d Sess.,2 (1938) (same). That impediment-removing objective is discrete from theSecretary's lease approval role under the IMLA. Again, we find no solidbasis in the IMLA, its regulations, or lofty statements in legislative history for a legally enforceable command that the Secretary disapprove Indian coal leases unless they survive "an independent market study," post,at 519, or satisfy some other extratextual criterion of tribal profitability.537US2 Unit: $U25 [04-14-04 21:42:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN513Cite as: 537 U. S. 488 (2003)Opinion of the CourtOral Arg. 50-52. The Secretary's ultimate approval of the121/2 percent royalty, the Tribe concludes, was thus an outcome fundamentally unfair to the Tribe.Here again, as the Court of Federal Claims ultimately determined, see supra, at 501, the Tribe's assertions are notgrounded in a specific statutory or regulatory provision thatcan fairly be interpreted as mandating money damages.Nothing in $ 396a, the IMLA's basic provision, or in theIMLA's implementing regulations proscribed theex partecommunications in this case, which occurred during an ad-ministrative appeal process largely unconstrained by formalrequirements. See 25 CFR $ 2.20 (1985) (Commissioner mayrely on "any information available to [him] . . . whether formally part of the record or not."); supra, at 496-497, n. 3.Either party could have effected a transfer of Peabody's appeal to the Board. See 25 CFR $ 2.19(b) (1985); supra, at496-497, n. 3. Exercise of that option would have triggeredreview of a more formal character, in which ex parte communications would have been prohibited. See 43 CFR $ 4.27(b)(1985). But the Tribe did not elect to transfer the matterto the Board, and the regulatory proscription on ex partecontacts applicable in Board proceedings thus did not govern.We note, moreover, that even if Deputy Assistant Secretary Fritz had rendered an opinion affirming the 20 percentroyalty approved by the Area Director, it would have beenopen to the Secretary to set aside or modify his subordinate'sdecision. See supra, at 498, n. 4. As head of the Department of the Interior, the Secretary had "authority to reviewany decision of any employee or employees of the Department." 43 CFR $ 4.5(a)(2) (1985); cf. Michigan Citizens forIndependent Press v. Thornburgh, 868 F. 2d 1285 (CADC)(upholding Attorney General's approval, over the contraryconclusions of an administrative law judge and the JusticeDepartment's Antitrust Division, of a joint operating agreement under the Newspaper Preservation Act), aff 'd by anequally divided Court, 493 U.
