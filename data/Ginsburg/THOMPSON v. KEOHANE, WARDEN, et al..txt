Challenginghis conviction in a federal habeas corpus proceeding, Thompson maintained that the Alaska troopers gained his confes-sion without according him the warnings Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), requires: that he could remainsilent; that anything he said could be used against him incourt; and that he was entitled to an attorney, either retainedor appointed.Miranda warnings are due only when a suspect interro-gated by the police is "in custody." The state trial and appellate courts determined that Thompson was not "in cus-tody" when he confessed. The statute governing federalhabeas corpus proceedings, 28 U. S. C. $ 2254, directs that,ordinarily, state-court fact findings "shall be presumed tobe correct." $ 2254(d). The question before this Court iswhether the state-court determination that Thompson wasnot "in custody" when he confessed is a finding of fact war-ranting a presumption of correctness, or a matter of law calling for independent review in federal court. We hold thatthe issue whether a suspect is "in custody," and thereforeentitled to Miranda warnings, presents a mixed question oflaw and fact qualifying for independent review.IOn September 10, 1986, two moose hunters discoveredthe body of a dead woman floating in a gravel pit lake onthe outskirts of Fairbanks, Alaska. The woman had beenstabbed 29 times. Notified by the hunters, the Alaska statetroopers issued a press release seeking assistance in iden-tifying the body. Thompson called the troopers on September 11 to inform them that his former wife, Dixie Thompson,fit the description in the press release and that she hadbeen missing for about a month. Through a dental examina-tion, the troopers conclusively established that the corpsewas Dixie Thompson. On September 15, a trooper called516us1$$8P 10-22-98 11:00:09 PAGES OPINPGT103Cite as: 516 U.

It is now undisputed, how-ever, that the trooper's primary reason for contactingThompson was to question him about the murder.Thompson drove to the troopers' headquarters in hispickup truck and, upon arriving, immediately identified theitems as Dixie's. He remained at headquarters, however,for two more hours while two unarmed troopers continuouslyquestioned him in a small interview room and tape-recordedthe exchange. The troopers did not inform Thompson of hisMiranda rights. Although they constantly assured Thompson he was free to leave, they also told him repeatedly thatthey knew he had killed his former wife. Informing Thompson that execution of a search warrant was underway at hishome, and that his truck was about to be searched pursuantto another warrant, the troopers asked questions that inviteda confession. App. 43-79.1 Eventually, Thompson told thetroopers he killed Dixie.1 These passages from the transcript of the tape-recorded interrogationindicate the tenor of the questioning:"Q Do you know--of course, I don't mean to take up a lot of your time,you--you can leave any time that you want to, if you've got somethingelse going on."A Oh no (indiscernible) around here, no."Q I know we called you and probably woke you up and. . . ."A No, I was just laying there."Q Okay.

Some two hours later, the troopers arrested Thomp-son and charged him with first-degree murder.The Alaska trial court, without holding an evidentiaryhearing, denied Thompson's motion to suppress his September 15 statements. Tr. 118 (Dec. 12, 1986); Tr. 142 (Mar. 18,1987). Deciding the motion on the papers submitted, thetrial court ruled that Thompson was not "in custody" forMiranda purposes, therefore the troopers had no obligationto inform him of his Miranda rights. App. 8-9.2 Applyingan objective test to resolve the "in custody" question, thecourt asked whether " `a reasonable person would feel he wasnot free to leave and break off police questioning.' " Id., at7 (quotingHunter v. State, 590 P. 2d 888, 895 (Alaska 1979)).These features, the court indicated, were key: Thompson ar-rived at the station in response to a trooper's request; twounarmed troopers in plain clothes questioned him; Thompsonwas told he was free to go at any time; and he was notarrested at the conclusion of the interrogation. App. 7-8.Although the trial court held that, under the totality ofthe circumstances, a reasonable person would have felt freeto leave, it also observed that the troopers' subsequentactions--releasing and shortly thereafter arresting Thompson--rendered the question "very close." Id., at 8-9.After a trial, at which the prosecution played the taperecorded confession, the jury found Thompson guilty offirst-degree murder and tampering with evidence.

KEOHANEOpinion of the Court768 P. 2d 127, 131 (Alaska App. 1989).3 The Alaska SupremeCourt denied discretionary review. App. 24.Thompson filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus inthe United States District Court for the District of Alaska.The District Court denied the writ, according a presumptionof correctness under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d) to the state court'sconclusion that, when Thompson confessed, he was not yet"in custody" for Miranda purposes. App. 37. The Courtof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed without publishingan opinion. 34 F. 3d 1073 (1994). Based on Circuit precedent,4 the court held that "a state court's determination thata defendant was not in custody for purposes of Miranda is aquestion of fact entitled to the presumption of correctnessunder 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)." App. 41.Federal Courts of Appeals disagree on the issue Thompsonasks us to resolve: whether state-court "in custody" determinations are matters of fact entitled to a presumption of correctness under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d), or mixed questions oflaw and fact warranting independent review by the federalhabeas court. Compare Feltrop v.

Because uniformity amongfederal courts is important on questions of this order, wegranted certiorari to end the division of authority. 513 U. S.3 It is unclear in this case what deference the Alaska appellate courtaccorded to the trial court's conclusion that petitioner was not "in custody"; in later decisions, the Alaska Court of Appeals reviewed the trialcourts' "in custody" determinations for "clear error."

Briggs, 983 F. 2d 961, 964 (CA9 1993),which held that state-court "in custody" determinations warrant a presumption of correctness under $ 2254(d) if the state court made factfindings after a hearing on the merits.516us1$$8P 10-22-98 11:00:09 PAGES OPINPGT107Cite as: 516 U.

Arizona, place "inherently compelling pres-sures" on the persons interrogated. 384 U. S., at 467. Tosafeguard the uncounseled individual's Fifth Amendmentprivilege against self-incrimination, theMiranda Court held,suspects interrogated while in police custody must be toldthat they have a right to remain silent, that anything theysay may be used against them in court, and that they areentitled to the presence of an attorney, either retained orappointed, at the interrogation. Id., at 444. The Court defined "custodial interrogation" as "questioning initiated bylaw enforcement officers after a person has been taken intocustody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action inany significant way."Ibid.; see also Oregon v. Mathiason,429 U. S. 492, 495 (1977) (per curiam) (duty to give Mirandawarnings is triggered "only where there has been such a re-striction on a person's freedom as to render him `in custody' ") (quoted in Stansbury v. California, 511 U. S. 318, 322(1994)(per curiam)). Our task in petitioner Thompson'scase is to identify the standard governing federal habeascourts' review of state-court "in custody" determinations.5ASection 2254 governs federal habeas corpus proceedingsinstituted by persons in custody pursuant to the judgmentof a state court. In such proceedings, $ 2254(d) declares,5 Claims that state courts have incorrectly decided Miranda issues,as Withrow v. Williams, 507 U.

In full, 28 U. S.

As the Miller Court observed, $ 2254(d) "was an al-most verbatim codification of the standards delineated inTownsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293 (1963), for determining whena district court must hold an evidentiary hearing before acting on a habeas petition." Miller, 474 U.

R. Rep. No. 1384, 88th Cong., 2d Sess.,25 (1964), is similar to the list set out in Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293,313 (1963). The legislative history further indicates that the House Judiciary Committee, in framing its recommendations, was mindful of theCourt's recent precedent, including Townsend. H. R. Rep.

S. 412, 429 (1985) ("It will not always be easy toseparate questions of `fact' from `mixed questions of law andfact' for $ 2254(d) purposes . . . ."). Two lines of decisionscompose the Court's $ 2254(d) law/fact jurisprudence.In several cases, the Court has classified as "factual issues"within $ 2254(d)'s compass questions extending beyond thedetermination of "what happened." This category notablyincludes: competency to stand trial (e. g., Maggio v. Fulford,462 U. S. 111, 117 (1983) (per curiam)); and juror impartiality(e. g., Witt, 469 U. S., at 429; Patton v. Yount, 467 U. S. 1025,1036 (1984); Rushen v. Spain, 464 U. S. 114, 120 (1983)).While these issues encompass more than "basic, primary, orhistorical facts," their resolution depends heavily on the trialcourt's appraisal of witness credibility and demeanor. See,e. g., Witt, 469 U. S., at 429 (Although the trial court is"applying some kind of legal standard to what [it] sees andhears," its "predominant function in determining juror biasinvolves credibility findings whose basis cannot be easily discerned from an appellate record."). This Court has reasoned that a trial court is better positioned to make decisionsof this genre, and has therefore accorded the judgment of thejurist-observer "presumptive weight." Miller, 474 U. S., at114 (when an "issue involves the credibility of witnesses andtherefore turns largely on an evaluation of demeanor, thereare compelling and familiar justifications for leaving theprocess of applying law to fact to the trial court").On the other hand, the Court has ranked as issues of lawfor $ 2254(d) purposes: the voluntariness of a confession(Miller, 474 U. S., at 116); the effectiveness of counsel'sassistance (Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 698(1984)); and the potential conflict of interest arising out of anattorney's representation of multiple defendants (Cuyler, 446U. S., at 341-342). "What happened" issues in these caseswarranted a presumption of correctness, but the Courtdeclared "the ultimate question" outside $ 2254(d)'s domain516us1$$8P 10-22-98 11:00:09 PAGES OPINPGT112 THOMPSON v.

S. 387, 397, and n. 4, 403-404 (1977)(waiver of Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel isnot a question of historical fact, but rather requires application of constitutional principles to facts).BThe ultimate "in custody" determination for Miranda purposes, we are persuaded, fits within the latter class of cases.Two discrete inquiries are essential to the determination:first, what were the circumstances surrounding the interrogation; and second, given those circumstances,11 would a reasonable person have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave. Once the scene is setand the players' lines and actions are reconstructed, thecourt must apply an objective test to resolve "the ultimateinquiry": "[was] there a `formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement' of the degree associated with a formalarrest." California v. Beheler, 463 U. S. 1121, 1125 (1983)(per curiam) (quoting Mathiason, 429 U. S., at 495). Thefirst inquiry, all agree, is distinctly factual. State-courtfindings on these scene- and action-setting questions attracta presumption of correctness under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d).The second inquiry, however, calls for application of the controlling legal standard to the historical facts. This ultimate11 The "totality of the circumstances" cast of the "in custody" determination, contrary to respondents' suggestions, does not mean deferentialreview is in order. See, e. g., Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 117 (1985)(state-court determination "whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the confession was obtained in a manner consistent with theConstitution" qualifies for independent review by federal habeas court).516us1$$8P 10-22-98 11:00:09 PAGES OPINPGT113Cite as: 516 U. S. 99 (1995)Opinion of the Courtdetermination, we hold, presents a "mixed question of lawand fact" qualifying for independent review.The practical considerations that have prompted the Courtto type questions like juror bias and competency as "factualissue[s]," and therefore governed by $ 2254(d)'s presumptionof correctness, are not dominant here. As this case illustrates, the trial court's superior capacity to resolve cred-ibility issues is not dispositive of the "in custody" inquiry.12Credibility determinations, as in the case of the allegedinvoluntariness of a confession, seeMiller, 474 U. S., at 112,may sometimes contribute to the establishment of the historical facts and thus to identification of the "totality of thecircumstances." But the crucial question entails an evaluation made after determination of those circumstances: ifencountered by a "reasonable person," would the identifiedcircumstances add up to custody as defined in Miranda? 1312 As earlier observed, see supra, at 105, the trial court decided Thompson's motion to suppress his September 15 statements on the papers submitted without holding an evidentiary hearing.13 Respondents observe that "reasonable person" assessments, mostprominently to gauge negligence in personal injury litigation, fall withinthe province of fact triers. See, e. g., Cooter & Gell, 496 U. S., at 402(negligence determinations "generally reviewed deferentially"); McAllister v. United States, 348 U. S. 19, 20-23 (1954) (District Court finding ofnegligence was not "clearly erroneous"); 9A C. Wright & A. Miller, FederalPractice and Procedures $ 2590 (2d ed. 1995). Traditionally, our legal system has entrusted negligence questions to jurors, inviting them to applycommunity standards. See W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen,Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts $ 37, pp. 235-237 (5th ed. 1984). Forthat reason, "[t]he question usually is said to be one of fact," although "itshould be apparent that the function of the jury in fixing the standarddiffers from that of the judge only in that it cannot be reduced to anythingapproaching a definite rule." Id., at 237.Judges alone make "in custody" assessments for Miranda purposes, andthey do so with a view to identifying recurrent patterns, and advancinguniform outcomes. If they cannot supply "a definite rule," they nonetheless can reduce the area of uncertainty. See, e. g., Illinois v. Perkins, 496U. S. 292, 296 (1990) (Miranda warnings not required prior to questioningof incarcerated individual by undercover agent because suspect, unaware516us1$$8P 10-22-98 11:00:09 PAGES OPINPGT114 THOMPSON v.

Miller, 474 U. S.,at 116-117 ("[A]ssessments of credibility and demeanor arenot crucial to the proper resolution of the ultimate issueof `voluntariness.' ").Unlike the voir dire of a juror, Patton, 467 U. S., at 1038,or the determination of a defendant's competency,Maggio,462 U. S., at 117, which "take[s] place in open court on a fullrecord," Miller, 474 U. S., at 117, the trial court does nothave a first-person vantage on whether a defendant was "incustody" for Miranda purposes. See 474 U. S., at 117 (policeinterrogations yielding confessions ordinarily occur, not incourt, but in an "inherently more coercive environment").Furthermore, in fathoming the state of mind of a potentialjuror or a defendant in order to answer the questions, "Isshe free of bias?," "Is he competent to stand trial?," the trialcourt makes an individual-specific decision, one unlikely tohave precedential value.14 In contrast, "in custody" determinations do guide future decisions.15 We thus concludeof police presence, is not coerced); Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420,436-439 (1984) (nature of suspected offense is irrelevant to duty to administer Miranda warnings); Oregon v. Mathiason, 429 U. S. 492, 495-496(1977) (per curiam) (fact that interrogation occurs at police station doesnot, in itself, require Miranda warnings).14 In other contexts, we have similarly concluded that the likely absenceof precedential value cuts against requiring plenary appellate review of adistrict court's determination. For example, in Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., a decision confirming that the abuse-of-discretion standardapplies to appellate review of sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, we observed that plenary review would likely " `fail to producethe normal law-clarifying benefits that come from an appellate decision ona question of law . . . .' " 496 U. S., at 404 (quoting Pierce v. Underwood,487 U. S. 552, 561 (1988)).15 See, e. g., Stansbury v. California, 511 U. S. 318, 322-324 (1994) (percuriam) (review of precedent demonstrated a "well settled" principle:officer's undisclosed, subjective belief that person questioned is a suspectis irrelevant to objective "in custody" determination); Pennsylvania516us1$$8P 10-22-98 11:00:09 PAGES OPINPGT115Cite as: 516 U.

See 474 U. S., at 117.Notably, we have treated the "in custody" question as oneof law when States complained that their courts had errone-ously expanded the meaning of "custodial interrogation."See Beheler, 463 U. S., at 1121-1125 (summarily reversingCalifornia Court of Appeal's judgment that respondent was"in custody"); Mathiason, 429 U. S., at 494-496 (summarilyreversing Oregon Supreme Court's determination that respondent was "in custody"); cf. Oregon v. Hass, 420 U. S. 714,719 (1975) ("[A] State may not impose . . . greater restrictions[on police activity] as a matter of federal constitutional lawwhen this Court specifically refrains from imposing them.").It would be anomalous to type the question differently whenan individual complains that the state courts had erroneously constricted the circumstances that add up to an "incustody" conclusion.Classifying "in custody" as a determination qualifying forindependent review should serve legitimate law enforcementinterests as effectively as it serves to ensure protection ofthe right against self-incrimination. As our decisions bearout, the law declaration aspect of independent review poten-tially may guide police, unify precedent, and stabilize thelaw. See, e. g., Berkemer, 468 U. S., at 436-439 (routine traf-fic stop--typically temporary, brief, and public--does notplace driver "in custody" for Miranda warning purposes);see also Monaghan, Constitutional Fact Review, 85 Colum.L.
