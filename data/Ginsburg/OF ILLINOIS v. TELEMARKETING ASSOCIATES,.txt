This case concerns the amenability of for-profit fundraisingcorporations to suit by the Attorney General of Illinois forfraudulent charitable solicitations. The controversy arisesfrom the fundraisers' contracts with a charitable nonprofitcorporation organized to advance the welfare of Vietnam veterans; under the contracts, the fundraisers were to retain 85percent of the proceeds of their fundraising endeavors. TheState Attorney General's complaint alleges that the fundraisers defrauded members of the public by falsely representing that "a significant amount of each dollar donatedwould be paid over to [the veterans organization] for its[charitable] purposes while in fact the [fundraisers] knewthat . . . 15 cents or less of each dollar would be available"for those purposes. App. 9, || 34. Complementing that allegation, the complaint states that the fundraisers falsely represented that "the funds donated would go to further . . .charitable purposes," id., at 8, || 29, when in fact "the amount. . . paid over to charity was merely incidental to the fundJerry W.

Those decisions held that certain regulations ofcharitable subscriptions, barring fees in excess of a pre-scribed level, effectively imposed prior restraints on fundraising, and were therefore incompatible with the FirstAmendment.We reverse the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court.Our prior decisions do not rule out, as supportive of a fraudclaim against fundraisers, any and all reliance on the per-centage of charitable donations fundraisers retain for themselves. While bare failure to disclose that information di-rectly to potential donors does not suffice to establish fraud,when nondisclosure is accompanied by intentionally mislead-ing statements designed to deceive the listener, the FirstAmendment leaves room for a fraud claim.IDefendants below, respondents here, Telemarketing Asso-ciates, Inc., and Armet, Inc., are Illinois for-profit fundraisingcorporations wholly owned and controlled by defendant-respondent Richard Troia. 198 Ill. 2d, at 347-348, 763538US2 Unit: $U49 [11-02-04 17:58:23] PAGES PGT: OPLG607Cite as: 538 U.

Ibid. Under theagreements, donor lists developed by Telemarketers wouldremain in their "sole and exclusive" control. App. 24, 93-94,102, || 65. Telemarketers also brokered contracts on behalfof VietNow with out-of-state fundraisers; under those contracts, out-of-state fundraisers retained between 70 percentand 80 percent of donated funds, Telemarketers received between 10 percent and 20 percent as a finder's fee, and VietNow received 10 percent. 198 Ill. 2d, at 348, 763 N.

One affiant asked what percentage ofher contribution would be used for fundraising expenses; she"was told 90% or more goes to the vets." Ibid. (capitalization omitted). Another affiant stated she was told her donation would not be used for "labor expenses" because "allmembers are volunteers."

E. 2d 289, 291(2001)); see Letter from William E. Raney to William K. Suter, Clerk ofthe Court (Mar. 4, 2003). In so stating, the Illinois court overlooked, mostobviously, the two affidavits attesting to Telemarketers' representationsthat "90% or more goes to the vets," and that there would be no "labor538US2 Unit: $U49 [11-02-04 17:58:23] PAGES PGT: OPLG609Cite as: 538 U.

Id., at 9,|||| 34, 35.Telemarketers moved to dismiss the fraud claims, urgingthat they were barred by the First Amendment. The trialcourt granted the motion,5 and the dismissal order wasaffirmed, in turn, by the Illinois Appellate Court and theIllinois Supreme Court. The Illinois courts placed heavyweight on three decisions of this Court:Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U. S. 620 (1980); Secretary of State of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U. S.expenses." See App. 111, 169 (capitalization omitted). In any event, thesentence fragment counsel identified falls short of showing, in the face ofestablished Illinois case law, that the court "found" the affidavits annexedby the Illinois Attorney General dehors the complaint. Counsel's contention is further clouded by the Illinois Supreme Court's explicit notationthat "the Attorney General ha[d] attached to his complaint the affidavitsof 44 VietNow donors." 198 Ill. 2d, at 352, 763 N.

National Federation of Blind ofN. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781 (1988). Each of the three decisionsinvalidated state or local laws that categorically restrainedsolicitation by charities or professional fundraisers if a highpercentage of the funds raised would be used to cover ad-ministrative or fundraising costs.Schaumburg, 444 U. S., at620; Munson, 467 U. S., at 947; and Riley, 487 U. S., at 781;see 198 Ill. 2d, at 359, 763 N. E. 2d, at 297.The Illinois Supreme Court acknowledged that this case,unlike Schaumburg, Munson, and Riley, involves no pro-phylactic provision proscribing any charitable solicitation iffundraising costs exceeded a prescribed limit. Instead, theAttorney General sought to enforce the State's generally applicable antifraud laws against Telemarketers for "specific instances of deliberate deception." 198 Ill. 2d, at 358, 763 N. E.2d, at 296 (quoting Riley, 487 U. S., at 803 (Scalia, J., concurring)). "However," the court said, "the statements made by[Telemarketers] during solicitation are alleged to be `false'only because [Telemarketers] retained 85% of the grossreceipts and failed to disclose this information to donors."198 Ill. 2d, at 359, 763 N. E. 2d, at 297. The Attorney General's complaint, in the Illinois Supreme Court's view, was"in essence, an attempt to regulate [Telemarketers'] abilityto engage in a protected activity based upon a percentagerate limitation"--"the same regulatory principle that was rejected in Schaumburg[,] Munson, and Riley." Ibid."[H]igh solicitation costs," the Illinois Supreme Courtstressed, "can be attributable to a number of factors." Ibid.In this case, the court noted, Telemarketers contracted toprovide a "wide range" of services in addition to telephonesolicitation. Ibid. For example, they agreed to publish anewsletter and to maintain a toll-free information hotline.Id., at 359-360, 763 N. E. 2d, at 297-298. Moreover, thecourt added, VietNow received "nonmonetary benefits byhaving [its] message disbursed by the solicitation process,"and Telemarketers were directed to solicit "in a manner that538US2 Unit: $U49 [11-02-04 17:58:23] PAGES PGT: OPLG611Cite as: 538 U. S. 600 (2003)Opinion of the Courtwould `promote goodwill' on behalf of VietNow." Id., at 361,763 N. E. 2d, at 298. Taking these factors into account, thecourt concluded that it would be "incorrect to presume . . .[any] nexus between high solicitation costs and fraud." Id.,at 360, 763 N. E. 2d, at 298.The Illinois Supreme Court further determined that,under Riley, "fraud cannot be defined in such a way that itplaces on solicitors the affirmative duty to disclose to potential donors, at the point of solicitation, the net proceeds tobe returned to the charity."Id., at 361, 763 N. E. 2d, at298.6 Finally, the court expressed the fear that if the complaint were allowed to proceed, all fundraisers in Illinoiswould be saddled with "the burden of defending the reasonableness of their fees, on a case-by-case basis, whenever inthe Attorney General's judgment the public was being deceived about the charitable nature of a fund-raising campaignbecause the fund-raiser's fee was too high." Id., at 362, 763N. E. 2d, at 299. The threatened exposure to litigation costsand penalties, the court said, "could produce a substantialchilling effect on protected speech." Ibid. We granted cer-tiorari. 537 U. S. 999 (2002).IIThe First Amendment protects the right to engage incharitable solicitation. SeeSchaumburg, 444 U.

TELEMARKETINGASSOCIATES, INC.Opinion of the Courtcauses--that are within the protection of the First Amend-ment");Riley, 487 U. S., at 788-789. But the First Amendment does not shield fraud. See, e. g., Donaldson v. ReadMagazine, Inc., 333 U. S. 178, 190 (1948) (the government'spower "to protect people against fraud" has "always beenrecognized in this country and is firmly established");Gertzv. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323, 340 (1974) (the "intentional lie" is "no essential part of any exposition of ideas"(internal quotation marks omitted)). Like other forms ofpublic deception, fraudulent charitable solicitation is un-protected speech. See,e. g., Schneider v. State (Town ofIrvington), 308 U. S. 147, 164 (1939) ("Frauds," including"fraudulent appeals . . . made in the name of charity andreligion," may be "denounced as offenses and punished bylaw."); Donaldson, 333 U. S., at 192 ("A contention cannot beseriously considered which assumes that freedom of thepress includes a right to raise money to promote circulationby deception of the public.").The Court has not previously addressed the First Amendment's application to individual fraud actions of the kind atissue here. It has, however, three times considered prophylactic statutes designed to combat fraud by imposing priorrestraints on solicitation when fundraising fees exceeded aspecified reasonable level. Each time, the Court held theprophylactic measures unconstitutional.In Schaumburg, decided in 1980, the Court invalidated avillage ordinance that prohibited charitable organizationsfrom soliciting contributions unless they used at least 75percent of their receipts "directly for the charitable purposeof the organization." 444 U. S., at 624 (internal quotationmarks omitted). The ordinance defined "charitable purposes" to exclude salaries and commissions paid to solicitors,and the administrative expenses of the charity, includingsalaries. Ibid. The village of Schaumburg's "principal justification" for the ordinance was fraud prevention: "[A]ny organization using more than 25 percent of its receipts on fund538US2 Unit: $U49 [11-02-04 17:58:23] PAGES PGT: OPLG613Cite as: 538 U. S. 600 (2003)Opinion of the Courtraising, salaries, and overhead," Schaumburg submitted, "isnot a charitable, but a commercial, for-profit enterprise"; "topermit [such an organization] to represent itself as a charity,"the village urged, "is fraudulent." Id., at 636.The Court agreed with Schaumburg that fraud preventionranks as "a substantial governmental interes[t]," ibid., butconcluded that "the 75-percent requirement" promoted thatinterest "only peripherally." Ibid. Spending "more than25 percent of [an organization's] receipts on fundraising, salaries, and overhead," the Court explained, does not reliablyindicate that the enterprise is "commercial" rather than"charitable." Ibid. Such spending might be altogether appropriate, Schaumburg noted, for a charitable organization"primarily engaged in research, advocacy, or public education [that uses its] own paid staff to carry out these functionsas well as to solicit financial support." Id., at 636-637."The Village's legitimate interest in preventing fraud," theCourt stated, "can be better served by measures less intrusive than a direct prohibition on solicitation," id., at 637:"Fraudulent misrepresentations can be prohibited and thepenal laws used to punish such conduct directly," ibid.Four years later, in Munson, the Court invalidated aMaryland law that prohibited charitable organizations fromsoliciting if they paid or agreed to pay as expenses morethan 25 percent of the amount raised. Unlike the inflexibleordinance in Schaumburg, the Maryland law authorized awaiver of the 25 percent limitation "where [it] would effectively prevent the charitable organization from raising contributions." 467 U. S., at 950-951, n. 2. The Court heldthat the waiver provision did not save the statute. Id.,at 962. "[No] reaso[n] other than financial necessity warrant[ed] a waiver," Munson observed. Id., at 963. Thestatute provided no shelter for a charity that incurred highsolicitation costs because it chose to disseminate informationas part of its fundraising. Ibid. Nor did it shield a charity538US2 Unit: $U49 [11-02-04 17:58:23] PAGES PGT: OPLG614 ILLINOIS ex rel. MADIGAN v. TELEMARKETINGASSOCIATES, INC.Opinion of the Courtwhose high solicitation costs stemmed from the unpopularityof its cause.Id., at 967."[N]o doubt [there] are organizations that have high fund-raising costs not due to protected First Amendment activity," the Court recognized; it concluded, however, thatMaryland's statute was incapable of "distinguish[ing] thoseorganizations from charities that have high costs due toprotected First Amendment activities." Id., at 966. Thestatute's fatal flaw, the Court said, was that it "operate[d] on[the] fundamentally mistaken premise that high solicitationcosts are an accurate measure of fraud."Ibid. As inSchaumburg, the Court noted, fraud could be checked by"measures less intrusive than a direct prohibition on solicitation": Fraud could be punished directly and the State"could require disclosure of the finances of a charitable organization so that a member of the public could make an informed decision about whether to contribute." 467 U. S., at961, and n. 9.Third in the trilogy of cases on which the Illinois SupremeCourt relied was our 1988 decision in Riley. The villageordinance in Schaumburg and the Maryland law in Munsonregulated charities; the North Carolina charitable solicitation controls at issue in Riley directly regulated professionalfundraisers. North Carolina's law prohibited professionalfundraisers from retaining an "unreasonable" or "excessive"fee. 487 U. S., at 784 (internal quotation marks omitted).Fees up to 20 percent of the gross receipts collected weredeemed reasonable; fees between 20 percent and 35 percentwere deemed unreasonable if the State showed that the solicitation did not involve advocacy or dissemination of information. Id., at 784-785. Fees exceeding 35 percent were presumed unreasonable, but the fundraiser could rebut thepresumption by showing either that the solicitation involvedadvocacy or information dissemination, or that, absent thehigher fee, the charity's "ability to raise money or communicate would be significantly diminished." Id., at 785-786.538US2 Unit: $U49 [11-02-04 17:58:23] PAGES PGT: OPLG615Cite as: 538 U. S. 600 (2003)Opinion of the CourtRelying on Schaumburg and Munson, the Court's decisioninRiley invalidated North Carolina's endeavor to rein incharitable solicitors' fees. The Court held, once again, thatfraud may not be inferred simply from the percentage ofcharitable donations absorbed by fundraising costs. See 487U. S., at 789 ("solicitation of charitable contributions is protected speech"; "using percentages to decide the legality ofthe fundraiser's fee is not narrowly tailored to the State'sinterest in preventing fraud").The opportunity to rebut the unreasonableness presump-tion attending a fee over 35 percent did not bring North Carolina's scheme within the constitutional zone, the Court explained. Under the State's law, "even where a prima facieshowing of unreasonableness ha[d] been rebutted, the factfinder [still had to] make an ultimate determination, on acase-by-case basis, as to whether the fee was reasonable--ashowing that the solicitation involved . . . advocacy or [the]dissemination of information [did] not alone establish thatthe total fee was reasonable." Id., at 786.Training on that aspect of North Carolina's regulation, theCourt stated: "Even if we agreed that some form of apercentage-based measure could be used, in part, to test forfraud, we could not agree to a measure that requires thespeaker to prove `reasonableness' case by case based uponwhat is at best a loose inference that the fee might be toohigh." Id., at 793. "[E]very campaign incurring fees in excess of 35% . . . [would] subject [fundraisers] to potentiallitigation over the `reasonableness' of the fee," the Court observed; that litigation risk, the Court concluded, would "chillspeech in direct contravention of the First Amendment's dictates." Id., at 794. Especially likely to be burdened, theRiley opinion noted, were solicitations combined with advocacy or the communication of information, and fundraising bysmall or unpopular charities. Ibid. The Court cautioned,however, as it did in Schaumburg and Munson, that Statesneed not "sit idly by and allow their citizens to be de538US2 Unit: $U49 [11-02-04 17:58:23] PAGES PGT: OPLG616 ILLINOIS ex rel. MADIGAN v. TELEMARKETINGASSOCIATES, INC.Opinion of the Courtfrauded." 487 U. S., at 795. We anticipated that NorthCarolina law enforcement officers would be "ready and able"to enforce the State's antifraud law. Ibid.Riley presented a further issue. North Carolina law required professional fundraisers to disclose to potential do-nors, before asking for money, the percentage of the prioryear's charitable contributions the fundraisers had actuallyturned over to charity. Ibid. The State defended this dis-closure requirement as a proper means to dispel public misperception that the money donors gave to professional fund-raisers went in greater-than-actual proportion to benefitcharity. Id., at 798.This Court condemned the measure as an "unduly burdensome" prophylactic rule, an exaction unnecessary to achievethe State's goal of preventing donors from being misled.Id., at 800. The State's rule, Riley emphasized, conclusivelypresumed that "the charity derive[d] no benefit from fundscollected but not turned over to it." Id., at 798. This was"not necessarily so," the Court said, for charities might wellbenefit from the act of solicitation itself, when the requestfor funds conveyed information or involved cause-orientedadvocacy. Ibid.The Court noted in Riley that North Carolina (like Illinoishere) required professional fundraisers to disclose their professional status. Id., at 799; see Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 225,$ 460/17(a) (2001); supra, at 609, n. 4, 611, n. 6. That disclosure, the Court said, effectively notified contributors that aportion of the money they donated would underwrite solicitation costs. A concerned donor could ask how much of thecontribution would be turned over to the charity, and underNorth Carolina law, fundraisers would be obliged to providethat information. Riley, 487 U. S., at 799 (citing N. C. Gen.Stat. $ 131C-16 (1986)). But upfront telephone disclosure ofthe fundraiser's fee, the Court believed, might end as well asbegin the conversation: A potential contributor who thoughtthe fee too high might simply hang up. 487 U. S., at 799-538US2 Unit: $U49 [11-02-04 17:58:23] PAGES PGT: OPLG617Cite as: 538 U. S. 600 (2003)Opinion of the Court800. "[M]ore benign and narrowly tailored options" thatwould not chill solicitation altogether were available; for example, the Court suggested, "the State may itself publishthe detailed financial disclosure forms it requires professional fundraisers to file," and "[it] may vigorously enforceits antifraud laws to prohibit professional fundraisers fromobtaining money on false pretenses or by making false state-ments."Ibid. IIIAThe Court's opinions in Schaumburg, Munson, and Rileytook care to leave a corridor open for fraud actions to guardthe public against false or misleading charitable solicitations.See Schaumburg, 444 U. S., at 637; Munson, 467 U. S., at 961,and n. 9; Riley, 487 U. S., at 795, 800.7 As those decisionsrecognized, and as we further explain below, there are differences critical to First Amendment concerns between fraudactions trained on representations made in individual casesand statutes that categorically ban solicitations when fund-raising costs run high. See Part III-B,infra. Simply la-beling an action one for "fraud," of course, will not carry theday. For example, had the complaint against Telemarketerscharged fraud based solely on the percentage of donationsthe fundraisers would retain, or their failure to alert poten-tial donors to their fee arrangements at the start of eachtelephone call, Riley would support swift dismissal.8 AState's Attorney General surely cannot gain case-by-caseground this Court has declared off limits to legislators.7 We are therefore unpersuaded by Telemarketers' plea that they lackedfair notice of their vulnerability to fraud actions. See Brief for Respondents 46, 49-50.8 Although fundraiser retention of 85 percent of donations is significantlyhigher than the 35 percent limit in Riley, this Court has not yet acceptedany percentage-based measure as dispositive. See supra, at 615 (quotingRiley v. National Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 793(1988)).538US2 Unit: $U49 [11-02-04 17:58:24] PAGES PGT: OPLG618 ILLINOIS ex rel. MADIGAN v. TELEMARKETINGASSOCIATES, INC.Opinion of the CourtPortions of the complaint in fact filed by the Attorney Gen-eral are of this genre. See,e. g., App. 103, || 72 (assertingthat Telemarketers' charge "is excessive" and "not justifiedby expenses [they] paid");id., at 86, |||| 67H-67I (allegingstatutory violations based on failure to disclose to prospec-tive donors Telemarketers' percentage fee). As we earliernoted, however, see supra, at 608-609, the complaint and annexed affidavits, in large part, alleged not simply what Tele-marketers failed to convey; they also described what Telemarketers misleadingly represented.Under Illinois law, similar to the Federal Rules of CivilProcedure, "[w]hen the legal sufficiency of a complaint ischallenged by a . . . motion to dismiss, all well-pleaded factsin the complaint are taken as true and [the court] must determine whether the allegations . . . , when interpreted in thelight most favorable to the plaintiff, are sufficient to establish a cause of action upon which relief may be granted."Connick v. Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd., 174 Ill. 2d 482, 490, 675N. E. 2d 584, 588 (1997) (emphasis added). Dismissal isproper "only if it clearly appears that no set of facts can beproved under the pleadings which will entitle the plaintiff torecover." 198 Ill. 2d, at 351, 763 N. E. 2d, at 293.Taking into account the affidavits, and reading the complaint in the light most favorable to the Attorney General,that pleading described misrepresentations our precedentdoes not place under the First Amendment's cover. First, itasserted that Telemarketers affirmatively represented that"a significant amount of each dollar donated would be paidover to Viet[N]ow" to be used for specific charitable purposes--rehabilitation services, job training, food baskets,and assistance for rent and bills, App. 9, || 34; id., at 124, 131,145, 163, 169, 187, 189--while in reality Telemarketers knewthat "15 cents or less of each dollar" was "available to Viet[N]ow for its purposes." Id., at 9, || 34. Second, the complaint alleged, essentially, that the charitable solicitation wasa fac,ade: Although Telemarketers represented that donated538US2 Unit: $U49 [11-02-04 17:58:24] PAGES PGT: OPLG619Cite as: 538 U. S. 600 (2003)Opinion of the Courtfunds would go to VietNow's specific "charitable purposes,"id., at 8, || 29, the "amount of funds being paid over to charitywas merely incidental to the fund raising effort," which wasmade "for the private pecuniary benefit of [Telemarketers]and their agents," id., at 9, || 35. Cf., e. g., Voices for Free-dom, CCH Trade Reg. || 23,080 (1993) [1987-1993 TransferBinder] (complaint against fundraisers who, inter alia, repre-sented that "substantial portions of the funds from [the saleof commemorative bracelets] would be used to support amessage center for the troops stationed in the Persian Gulf,"but "did not use substantial portions of the bracelet-salesproceeds to support the message center").Fraud actions so tailored, targeting misleading affirmativerepresentations about how donations will be used, are plainlydistinguishable, as we next discuss, from the measures inval-idated inSchaumburg, Munson, and Riley: So long as theemphasis is on what the fundraisers misleadingly convey, andnot on percentage limitations on solicitors' fees per se, suchactions need not impermissibly chill protected speech.BIn Schaumburg, Munson, and Riley, the Court invalidatedlaws that prohibited charitable organizations or fundraisers from engaging in charitable solicitation if they spenthigh percentages of donated funds on fundraising--whetheror not any fraudulent representations were made to potentialdonors. Truthfulness even of all representations was nota defense. See supra, at 612-616. In contrast to the priorrestraints inspected in those cases, a properly tailored fraudaction targeting fraudulent representations themselves em-ploys no "[b]road prophylactic rul[e],"Schaumburg, 444U. S., at 637 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted),lacking any "nexus . . . [to] the likelihood that the solicitationis fraudulent," Riley, 487 U. S., at 793. Such an action thusfalls on the constitutional side of the line the Court's casesdraw "between regulation aimed at fraud and regulation538US2 Unit: $U49 [11-02-04 17:58:24] PAGES PGT: OPLG620 ILLINOIS ex rel. MADIGAN v. TELEMARKETINGASSOCIATES, INC.Opinion of the Courtaimed at something else in the hope that it would sweepfraud in during the process." Munson, 467 U. S., at 969-970. The Illinois Attorney General's complaint, in this light,has a solid core in allegations that home in on affirmativestatements Telemarketers made intentionally misleading do-nors regarding the use of their contributions. See supra,at 608-609.Of prime importance, and in contrast to a prior restrainton solicitation, or a regulation that imposes on fundraisersan uphill burden to prove their conduct lawful, in a properlytailored fraud action the State bears the full burden of proof.False statement alone does not subject a fundraiser to fraudliability. As restated in Illinois case law, to prove a defend-ant liable for fraud, the complainant must show that thedefendant made a false representation of a material factknowing that the representation was false; further, the complainant must demonstrate that the defendant made the rep-resentation with the intent to mislead the listener, and succeeded in doing so. See In re Witt, 145 Ill. 2d 380, 391, 583N. E. 2d 526, 531 (1991). Heightening the complainant's burden, these showings must be made by clear and convincingevidence. See Hofmann v. Hofmann, 94 Ill. 2d 205, 222, 446N. E. 2d 499, 506 (1983).9Exacting proof requirements of this order, in other contexts, have been held to provide sufficient breathing roomfor protected speech. See New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,376 U. S. 254, 279-280 (1964) (action for defamation of public9 In Riley, this Court expressed concern that case-by-case litigation overthe reasonableness of fundraising fees would inhibit speech. 487 U. S., at793-794. That concern arose in large measure because the North Carolina statute there at issue placed the burden of proof on the fundraiser.The Court has long cautioned that, to avoid chilling protected speech, thegovernment must bear the burden of proving that the speech it seeks toprohibit is unprotected. See Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U. S. 51, 58(1965); Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513, 525-526 (1958). The governmentshoulders that burden in a fraud action.538US2 Unit: $U49 [11-02-04 17:58:24] PAGES PGT: OPLG621Cite as: 538 U. S. 600 (2003)Opinion of the Courtofficial); Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States,Inc., 466 U. S. 485, 502, and n. 19 (1984) (noting "kinship"between New York Times standard and "motivation thatmust be proved to support a common-law action for deceit").10 As an additional safeguard responsive to FirstAmendment concerns, an appellate court could independently review the trial court's findings. Cf. Bose Corp., 466U. S., at 498-511 (de novo appellate review of findings regarding actual malice). What the First Amendment and ourcase law emphatically do not require, however, is a blanketexemption from fraud liability for a fundraiser who intentionally misleads in calls for donations.The Illinois Supreme Court in the instant case correctlyobserved that "the percentage of [fundraising] proceedsturned over to a charity is not an accurate measure of theamount of funds used `for' a charitable purpose." 198 Ill. 2d,at 360, 763 N. E. 2d, at 298 (citing Munson, 467 U. S., at 967,n. 16). But the gravamen of the fraud action in this case isnot high costs or fees, it is particular representations madewith intent to mislead. If, for example, a charity conductedan advertising or awareness campaign that advanced charitable purposes in conjunction with its fundraising activity, itsrepresentation that donated funds were going to "charitablepurposes" would not be misleading, much less intentionallyso. Similarly, charitable organizations that engage primarily in advocacy or information dissemination could get andspend money for their activities without risking a fraud10 Although this case does not present the issue, the Illinois AttorneyGeneral urges that a constitutional requirement resembling "actual malice" does not attend "every form of liability by charitable solicitors whomisrepresent the use of donations." Reply Brief 16-17, n. 11 (internalquotation marks omitted). We confine our consideration to the complaintin this case, which alleged that Telemarketers "acted with knowledge ofthe falsity of their representations."

S., at 636-637; Munson,467 U. S., at 963; Riley, 487 U. S., at 798-799.11The Illinois Attorney General here has not suggested thata charity must desist from using donations for informationdissemination, advocacy, the promotion of public awareness,the production of advertising material, the development orenlargement of the charity's contributor base,12 and the like.Rather, she has alleged that Telemarketers attracted donations by misleading potential donors into believing that asubstantial portion of their contributions would fund specificprograms or services, knowing full well that was not thecase. See supra, at 608-609, 618-619. Such representations remain false or misleading, however legitimate theother purposes for which the funds are in fact used.We do not agree with Telemarketers that the Illinois Attorney General's fraud action is simply an end run aroundRiley's holding that fundraisers may not be required,in every telephone solicitation, to state the percentage ofreceipts the fundraiser would retain. See Brief for Respondents 14-19. It is one thing to compel every fundraiserto disclose its fee arrangements at the start of a telephoneconversation, quite another to take fee arrangements into11 Amicus Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), for example, statesthat its mission is "to communicate the message `Don't Drink and Drive.' "Brief for Public Citizen, Inc., et al. as Amici Curiae 13. Telephone solicitors retained by MADD "reach millions of people a year, and each calleducates the public about the tragedy of drunk driving, provides statisticsand asks the customer to always designate a sober driver." Ibid. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Solicitations that describedMADD's charitable mission would not be fraudulent simply becauseMADD devotes a large proportion of its resources to fundraising calls,for those calls themselves fulfill its advocacy/information disseminationmission.12 This Court has consistently recognized that small or unpopular charities would be hindered by limitations on the portion of receipts they coulddevote to subscription building.

S. 600 (2003)Opinion of the Courtaccount in assessing whether particular affirmative repre-sentations designedly deceive the public.COur decisions have repeatedly recognized the legitimacyof government efforts to enable donors to make informedchoices about their charitable contributions. In Schaum-burg, the Court thought it proper to require "disclosure ofthe finances of charitable organizations," thereby to preventfraud "by informing the public of the ways in which theircontributions will be employed." 444 U. S., at 638. InMunson, the Court reiterated that "disclosure of the financesof a charitable organization" could be required "so that amember of the public could make an informed decision aboutwhether to contribute." 467 U. S., at 961-962, n. 9. Andin Riley, the Court said the State may require profes-sional fundraisers to file "detailed financial disclosure forms"and may communicate that information to the public. 487U. S., at 800; see also id., at 799, n. 11 (State may requirefundraisers "to disclose unambiguously [their] professionalstatus").In accord with our precedent, as Telemarketers and theiramici acknowledge, in "[a]lmost all of [the] states and manylocalities," charities and professional fundraisers must "reg-ister and file regular reports on activities[,] particularlyfundraising costs." Brief for Respondents 37; see Brief forIndependent Sector et al. asAmici Curiae 6-8. These re-ports are generally available to the public; indeed, "[m]anystates have placed the reports they receive from charitiesand professional fundraisers on the Internet." Brief for Respondents 39; see Brief for Independent Sector et al. asAmici Curiae 9-10. Telemarketers do not object on FirstAmendment grounds to these disclosure requirements.

TELEMARKETINGASSOCIATES, INC.Scalia, J., concurring"vigorously enforce . . . antifraud laws to prohibit profes-sional fundraisers from obtaining money on false pretensesor by making false statements." Riley, 487 U. S., at 800.High fundraising costs, without more, do not establish fraud.See id., at 793. And mere failure to volunteer the fund-raiser's fee when contacting a potential donee, without more,is insufficient to state a claim for fraud. Id., at 795-801.But these limitations do not disarm States from assuringthat their residents are positioned to make informed choicesabout their charitable giving. Consistent with our precedent and the First Amendment, States may maintain fraudactions when fundraisers make false or misleading representations designed to deceive donors about how their donationswill be used.* * *For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Illinois Su-preme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
