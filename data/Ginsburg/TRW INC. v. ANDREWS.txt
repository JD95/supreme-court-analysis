Theexception covers willful misrepresentation of "any information required under [the Act] to be disclosed to [the plaintiff]": When such a representation is material to a claimunder the Act, suit may be brought "within two years after[the plaintiff 's] discovery . . . of the misrepresentation."Section 1681p's exception is not involved in this case; thecomplaint does not allege misrepresentation of informationthat the FCRA "require[s] . . . to be disclosed to [the plaintiff]."

She filled out a new pa-tient form listing certain basic information, including hername, birth date, and Social Security number. Andrewshanded the form to the office receptionist, one Andrea Andrews (the Impostor), who copied the information and there-after moved to Las Vegas, Nevada.

ANDREWSOpinion of the Courttor attempted on numerous occasions to open credit accountsusing Andrews' Social Security number and her own lastname and address.On four of those occasions, the company from which theImpostor sought credit requested a report from TRW. Eachtime, TRW's computers registered a match between Andrews' Social Security number, last name, and first initialand therefore responded by furnishing her file. TRW thusdisclosed Andrews' credit history at the Impostor's requestto a bank on July 25, 1994; to a cable television company onSeptember 27, 1994; to a department store on October 28,1994; and to another credit provider on January 3, 1995. Allrecipients but the cable company rejected the Impostor's applications for credit.Andrews did not learn of these disclosures until May 31,1995, when she sought to refinance her home mortgage andin the process received a copy of her credit report reflecting the Impostor's activity. Andrews concedes that TRWpromptly corrected her file upon learning of its mistake.She alleges, however, that the blemishes on her report notonly caused her inconvenience and emotional distress, theyalso forced her to abandon her refinancing efforts and settlefor an alternative line of credit on less favorable terms.On October 21, 1996, almost 17 months after she discovered the Impostor's fraudulent conduct and more than twoyears after TRW's first two disclosures, Andrews filed suitin the United States District Court for the Central Districtof California.

Andrews asserted that byprocessing requests that matched her profile on Social Security number, last name, and first initial but did not correspond on other key identifiers, notably birth date, address,and first name, TRW had facilitated the Impostor's identitytheft. According to Andrews, TRW's verification failureconstituted a willful violation of $ 1681e(a), which requirescredit reporting agencies to maintain "reasonable procedures" to avoid improper disclosures. She sought injunctiverelief, punitive damages, and compensation for the "expenditure of time and money, commercial impairment, inconvenience, embarrassment, humiliation and emotional distress"that TRW had allegedly inflicted upon her. App. 15-16.TRW moved for partial summary judgment, arguing, interalia, that the FCRA's statute of limitations had expired onAndrews' claims based on the July 25 and September 27,1994, disclosures because both occurred more than two yearsbefore she brought suit. Andrews countered that her claimsas to all four disclosures were timely because the limitationsperiod did not commence until May 31, 1995, the date shelearned of TRW's alleged wrongdoing.

The court rejectedthe District Court's conclusion that the text of $ 1681p, andin particular the limited exception set forth in that section,precluded judicial attribution of such a rule to the FCRA."[U]nless Congress has expressly legislated otherwise," theNinth Circuit declared, "the equitable doctrine of discoveryis read into every federal statute of limitations."

Accordingly, the court reinstated Andrews' improper disclosure claims and remanded them for trial.In holding that $ 1681p incorporates a general discoveryrule, the Ninth Circuit parted company with four other Circuits; those courts have concluded that a discovery exceptionother than the one Congress expressed may not be read intothe Act. See Clark v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Ins. Co.,54 F. 3d 669 (CA10 1995); Rylewicz v. Beaton Servs., Ltd.,888 F. 2d 1175 (CA7 1989); Houghton v.

S. 19 (2001)Opinion of the CourtIIThe Court of Appeals rested its decision on the premisethat all federal statutes of limitations, regardless of context,incorporate a general discovery rule "unless Congress hasexpressly legislated otherwise." 225 F. 3d, at 1067. To theextent such a presumption exists, a matter this case does notoblige us to decide, the Ninth Circuit conspicuously overstated its scope and force.The Appeals Court principally relied on our decision inHolmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392 (1946). See 225 F. 3d,at 1067. In that case, we instructed with particularity that"where a plaintiff has been injured by fraud and remains inignorance of it without any fault or want of diligence or careon his part, the bar of the statute does not begin to rununtil the fraud is discovered." Holmberg, 327 U. S., at 397(internal quotation marks omitted). Holmberg thus standsfor the proposition that equity tolls the statute of limitationsin cases of fraud or concealment; it does not establish a gen-eral presumption applicable across all contexts. The onlyother cases in which we have recognized a prevailing discov-ery rule, moreover, were decided in two contexts, latent disease and medical malpractice, "where the cry for [such a] ruleis loudest," Rotella v. Wood, 528 U. S. 549, 555 (2000). SeeUnited States v. Kubrick, 444 U. S. 111 (1979); Urie v.Thompson, 337 U. S. 163 (1949).We have also observed that lower federal courts "generally apply a discovery accrual rule when a statute is silenton the issue." Rotella, 528 U. S., at 555; see also Klehr v.A. O. Smith Corp., 521 U. S. 179, 191 (1997) (citing Connorsv. Hallmark & Son Coal Co., 935 F. 2d 336, 342 (CADC 1991),for the proposition that "federal courts generally apply [a]discovery accrual rule when [the] statute does not call for adifferent rule"). But we have not adopted that position asour own. And, beyond doubt, we have never endorsed theNinth Circuit's view that Congress can convey its refusal toadopt a discovery rule only by explicit command, rather than534US1 Unit: $$U2 [04-10-03 14:24:28] PAGES PGT: OPLG28 TRW INC. v. ANDREWSOpinion of the Courtby implication from the structure or text of the particularstatute.The Ninth Circuit thus erred in holding that a generallyapplied discovery rule controls this case. The FCRA doesnot govern an area of the law that cries out for applicationof a discovery rule, nor is the statute "silent on the issue" ofwhen the statute of limitations begins to run. Section 1681paddresses that precise question; the provision reads:"An action to enforce any liability created under [theAct] may be brought . . . within two years from the dateon which the liability arises, except that where a defend-ant has materially and willfully misrepresented any information required under [the Act] to be disclosed toan individual and the information so misrepresented ismaterial to the establishment of the defendant's liabilityto that individual under [the Act], the action may bebrought at any time within two years after discovery bythe individual of the misrepresentation."We conclude that the text and structure of $ 1681p evinceCongress' intent to preclude judicial implication of a discovery rule."Where Congress explicitly enumerates certain exceptionsto a general prohibition, additional exceptions are not to beimplied, in the absence of evidence of a contrary legislativeintent."Andrus v. Glover Constr. Co., 446 U. S. 608, 616-617 (1980). Congress provided in the FCRA that the two-year statute of limitations runs from "the date on which theliability arises," subject to a single exception for cases in-volving a defendant's willful misrepresentation of materialinformation. $ 1681p. The most natural reading of $ 1681pis that Congress implicitly excluded a general discovery ruleby explicitly including a more limited one. See Leathermanv. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and CoordinationUnit, 507 U. S. 163, 168 (1993) ("Expressio unius est exclusioalterius."). We would distort $ 1681p's text by converting534US1 Unit: $$U2 [04-10-03 14:24:28] PAGES PGT: OPLG29Cite as: 534 U. S. 19 (2001)Opinion of the Courtthe exception into the rule. Cf. United States v. Brockamp,519 U. S. 347, 352 (1997) ("explicit listing of exceptions"to running of limitations period considered indicative ofCongress' intent to preclude "courts [from] read[ing] otherunmentioned, open-ended, `equitable' exceptions into thestatute").At least equally telling, incorporating a general discoveryrule into $ 1681p would not merely supplement the explicitexception contrary to Congress' apparent intent; it would inpractical effect render that exception entirely superfluous inall but the most unusual circumstances. A consumer willgenerally not discover the tortious conduct alleged here--the improper disclosure of her credit history to a potentialuser--until she requests her file from a credit reportingagency. If the agency responds by concealing the offendingdisclosure, both a generally applicable discovery rule and themisrepresentation exception would operate to toll the statute of limitations until the concealment is revealed. Oncetriggered, the statute of limitations would run under eitherfor two years from the discovery date. In this paradigmaticsetting, then, the misrepresentation exception would have nowork to do.Both Andrews and the Government, appearing as amicusin her support, attempt to generate some role for the expressexception independent of that filled by a general discoveryrule. They conceive of the exception as a codification ofthe judge-made doctrine of equitable estoppel, which, theyargue, operates only after the discovery rule has triggeredthe limitations period, preventing a defendant from benefiting from its misrepresentation by tolling that period untilthe concealment is uncovered.To illustrate this supposed separate application, Andrewsand the Government frame the following scenario: A creditreporting agency injures a consumer by disclosing her filefor an improper purpose. The consumer has no reason tosuspect the violation until a year later, when she applies for534US1 Unit: $$U2 [04-10-03 14:24:28] PAGES PGT: OPLG30 TRW INC. v. ANDREWSOpinion of the Courtand is denied credit as a result of the agency's wrongdoing.At that point, the Government asserts, "the consumer wouldpresumably be put on inquiry notice of the violation, and thediscovery rule would start the running of the normal limitation period." Brief for United States et al. as Amici Curiae22 (emphasis deleted); see Tr. of Oral Arg. 35-36 (argumentin accord by Andrews' counsel). Some days or months later,the consumer follows up on her suspicions by requesting acopy of her credit report, to which the agency responds byconcealing the initial improper disclosure. According to An-drews and the Government, the misrepresentation exceptionwould then operate to toll the already-commenced limitations period until the agency reveals its wrongdoing.We reject this argument for several reasons. As an initialmatter, we are not persuaded by this effort to distinguishthe practical function of a discovery rule and the expressexception, because we doubt that the supporting scenario islikely to occur outside the realm of theory. The fatal weakness in the narrative is its assumption that a consumer wouldbe charged with constructive notice of an improper disclosure upon denial of a credit application. If the consumerhabitually paid her bills on time, the denial might well leadher to suspect a prior credit agency error. But the creditdenial would place her on "inquiry notice," and the discoveryrule would trigger the limitations period at that point, onlyif a reasonable person in her position would have learnedof the injury in the exercise of due diligence. See Stone v.Williams, 970 F. 2d 1043, 1049 (CA2 1992) ("The duty ofinquiry having arisen, plaintiff is charged with whateverknowledge an inquiry would have revealed."); 2 C. Corman,Limitation of Actions $ 11.1.6, p. 164 (1991) ("It is obviouslyunreasonable to charge the plaintiff with failure to search forthe missing element of the cause of action if such elementwould not have been revealed by such search.").In the usual circumstance, the plaintiff will gain knowledge of her injury from the credit reporting agency.

S. 19 (2001)Opinion of the Courtscenario put forth by Andrews and the Government, how-ever, requires the assumption that, even if the consumer exercised reasonable diligence by requesting her credit reportwithout delay, she would not in fact learn of the disclosurebecause the credit reporting agency would conceal it. Theuncovering of that concealment would remain the triggeringevent for both the discovery rule and the express exception.In this scenario, as in the paradigmatic one, the misrepresentation exception would be superfluous.In any event, both Andrews and the Government concedethat the independent function one could attribute to the ex-press exception would arise only in "rare and egregiouscase[s]." Brief for Respondent 32-33; see Brief for UnitedStates et al. asAmici Curiae 24 (implied discovery rulewould apply in "vast majority" of cases). The result is thata rule nowhere contained in the text of $ 1681p would do thebulk of that provision's work, while a proviso accounting formore than half of that text would lie dormant in all but themost unlikely situations.It is "a cardinal principle of statutory construction" that"a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, ifit can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall besuperfluous, void, or insignificant."Duncan v. Walker, 533U. S. 167, 174 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted); seeUnited States v. Menasche, 348 U. S. 528, 538-539 (1955) ("Itis our duty `to give effect, if possible, to every clause andword of a statute.' " (quoting Montclair v. Ramsdell, 107U. S. 147, 152 (1883))). "[W]ere we to adopt [Andrews'] construction of the statute," the express exception would berendered "insignificant, if not wholly superfluous." Duncan, 533 U. S., at 174. We are "reluctant to treat statutoryterms as surplusage in any setting,"ibid. (internal alterationand quotation marks omitted), and we decline to do so here.55 Similarly, even if we agreed that the discovery and equitable estoppeldoctrines could comfortably coexist in this setting, we would rejectthe contention that we are therefore free to incorporate both into the534US1 Unit: $$U2 [04-10-03 14:24:28] PAGES PGT: OPLG32 TRW INC. v. ANDREWSOpinion of the CourtAndrews advances two additional arguments in defense ofthe decision below, neither of which we find convincing. Shecontends, first, that the words "date on which the liabilityarises"--the phrase Congress used to frame the general rulein $ 1681p--"literally expres[s]" a discovery rule because liability does not "arise" until it "present[s] itself " or comes tothe attention of the potential plaintiff. Brief for Respondent13. The dictionary definition of the word "arise" does notcompel such a reading; to the contrary, it can be used to support either party's position. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 117 (1966) (arise defined as "to comeinto being"; "to come about"; or "to become apparent in sucha way as to demand attention"); Black's Law Dictionary 138(rev. 4th ed. 1968) ("to come into being or notice"). AndTRW offers a strong argument that we have in fact construed that word to imply the result Andrews seeks to avoid.See Brief for Petitioner 16-20 (citing, inter alia, McMahonv. United States, 342 U. S. 25 (1951) (statute of limitations triggered on date "cause of action arises" incorporates injury-occurrence rule)). On balance, we conclude, thephrase "liability arises" is not particularly instructive, muchless dispositive of this case.Similarly unhelpful, in our view, is Andrews' reliance onthe legislative history of $ 1681p. She observes that earlyversions of that provision, introduced in both the House andSenate, keyed the start of the limitations period to "the dateof the occurrence of the violation." S. 823, 91st Cong., 1stSess., $ 618 (1969); H. R. 16340, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., $ 27(1970); H. R. 14765, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., $ 617 (1969). Fromthe disappearance of that language in the final version of$ 1681p, Andrews infers a congressional intent to reject therule that the deleted words would have plainly established.FCRA. As we have explained, see supra, at 28-29, we read Congress'codification of one judge-made doctrine not as a license to imply others,but rather as an intentional rejection of those it did not codify.534US1 Unit: $$U2 [04-10-03 14:24:28] PAGES PGT: OPLG33Cite as: 534 U.

Hearings before the Subcommittee on Consumer Affairsof the House Committee on Banking and Currency, 91stCong., 2d Sess., 188 (1970). In addition, the very change to$ 1681p's language on which Andrews relies could be read torefute her position. The misrepresentation exception wasadded at the same time Congress changed the language"date of the occurrence of the violation" to "liability arises."Compare S. 823, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., $ 618 (1969); H.

We doubt that Congress, when it inserted acarefully worded exception to the main rule, intended simul-taneously to create a general discovery rule that would render that exception superfluous. In sum, the evidence of theearly incarnations of $ 1681p, like the "liability arises" language on which Congress ultimately settled, fails to convinceus that Congress intended sub silentio to adopt a generaldiscovery rule in addition to the limited one it expresslyprovided.IIIIn this Court, Andrews for the first time presents an alter-native argument based on the "liability arises" language of$ 1681p. Brief for Respondent 22-25. She contends thateven if $ 1681p does not incorporate a discovery rule, "liability" under the FCRA does not necessarily "arise" when aviolation of the Act occurs. Noting that the FCRA's substantive provisions tie "liability" to the presence of "actualdamages," $$ 1681n, 1681o, and that "arise" means at least"to come into existence," Andrews concludes that "liabilityarises" only when actual damages materialize. Not untilthen, she maintains, will all the essential elements of a claimcoalesce: "duty, breach, causation, and injury." Brief forRespondent 23; seeHyde v. Hibernia Nat.
