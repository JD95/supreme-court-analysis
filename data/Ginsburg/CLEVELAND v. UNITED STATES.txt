This case presents the question whether the federal mailfraud statute, 18 U. S. C. $ 1341, reaches false statementsmade in an application for a state license. Section 1341 pro-scribes use of the mails in furtherance of "any scheme orartifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property bymeans of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, orpromises." Petitioner Carl W. Cleveland and others wereprosecuted under this federal measure for making falsestatements in applying to the Louisiana State Police for per-mission to operate video poker machines. We conclude thatpermits or licenses of this order do not qualify as "property"within $ 1341's compass. It does not suffice, we clarify, thatthe object of the fraud may become property in the recipi-ent's hands; for purposes of the mail fraud statute, the thingobtained must be property in the hands of the victim. Stateand municipal licenses in general, and Louisiana's videopoker licenses in particular, we hold, do not rank as "prop-erty," for purposes of $ 1341, in the hands of the officiallicensor. ILouisiana law allows certain businesses to operate videopoker machines. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. $$ 27:301 to 27:324(West Supp. 2000). The State itself, however, does not runsuch machinery. The law requires prospective owners ofvideo poker machines to apply for a license from the State.$ 27:306. The licenses are not transferable, $ 27:311(G), andmust be renewed annually, La. Admin. Code, tit. 42,$ 2405(B)(3) (2000). To qualify for a license, an applicantmust meet suitability requirements designed to ensure thatlicensees have good character and fiscal integrity. La. Rev.Stat.

(TSG), in order to par-ticipate in the video poker business at their truck stop inSlidell, Louisiana. Cleveland, a New Orleans lawyer, as531US1 Unit: $$U3 [04-13-02 14:36:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN16 CLEVELAND v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtsisted Goodson in preparing TSG's application for a videopoker license. The application required TSG to identify itspartners and to submit personal financial statements for allpartners. It also required TSG to affirm that the listedpartners were the sole beneficial owners of the business andthat no partner held an interest in the partnership merelyas an agent or nominee, or intended to transfer the interestin the future.TSG's application identified Goodson's adult children, Alexand Maria, as the sole beneficial owners of the partnership.It also showed that Goodson and Cleveland's law firm hadloaned Alex and Maria all initial capital for the partnershipand that Goodson was TSG's general manager. In May 1992,the State approved the application and issued a license.TSG successfully renewed the license in 1993, 1994, and 1995pursuant to La. Admin. Code, tit. 42, $ 2405(B)(3) (2000).Each renewal application identified no ownership interestsother than those of Alex and Maria.In 1996, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) dis-covered evidence that Cleveland and Goodson had participated in a scheme to bribe state legislators to vote in amanner favorable to the video poker industry. The Government charged Cleveland and Goodson with multiple countsof money laundering under 18 U. S. C. $ 1957, as well as racketeering and conspiracy under $ 1962. Among the predicateacts supporting these charges were four counts of mail fraudunder $ 1341.1 The indictment alleged that Cleveland and1 Title 18 U. S.

See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 27:310(B)(1)(West Supp. 2000) (suitability requirements).Before trial, Cleveland moved to dismiss the mail fraudcounts on the ground that the alleged fraud did not deprivethe State of "property" under $ 1341. The District Courtdenied the motion, concluding that "licenses constitute property even before they are issued." 951 F. Supp. 1249, 1261(ED La. 1997). A jury found Cleveland guilty on two countsof mail fraud (based on the 1994 and 1995 license renewals)and on money laundering, racketeering, and conspiracycounts predicated on the mail fraud. The District Courtsentenced Cleveland to 121 months in prison.On appeal, Cleveland again argued that Louisiana had noproperty interest in video poker licenses, relying on severalCourt of Appeals decisions holding that the government doesnot relinquish "property" for purposes of $ 1341 when it issues a permit or license. See United States v. Shotts, 145F. 3d 1289, 1296 (CA11 1998) (license to operate a bail bondsbusiness); United States v. Schwartz, 924 F. 2d 410, 418 (CA21991) (arms export license); United States v.

Two other Circuits have concluded that the issuing authority has a prop-erty interest in unissued licenses under $ 1341.UnitedStates v.

Id., at 352. Atthe time McNally was decided, federal prosecutors had beenusing $ 1341 to attack various forms of corruption that de-prived victims of "intangible rights" unrelated to money orproperty.2 Reviewing the history of $ 1341, we concludedthat "the original impetus behind the mail fraud statute was2 E. g., United States v.

S. 12 (2000)Opinion of the Courtto protect the people from schemes to deprive them of theirmoney or property."Id., at 356.As first enacted in 1872, $ 1341 proscribed use of the mailsto further " `any scheme or artifice to defraud.' "Ibid. In1896, this Court held in Durland v. United States, 161 U. S.306, 313, that the statute covered fraud not only by "representations as to the past or present," but also by "suggestions and promises as to the future." In 1909, Congressamended $ 1341 to add after "any scheme or artifice to defraud" the phrase "or for obtaining money or property bymeans of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, orpromises." McNally, 483 U. S., at 357. We explained inMcNally that the 1909 amendment "codified the holding ofDurland," ibid., and "simply made it unmistakable that thestatute reached false promises and misrepresentations as tothe future as well as other frauds involving money or property," ibid. Rejecting the argument that "the money-orproperty requirement of the latter phrase does not limitschemes to defraud to those aimed at causing deprivation ofmoney or property," id., at 358, we concluded that the 1909amendment signaled no intent by Congress to "depar[t] from[the] common understanding" that "the words `to defraud'commonly refer `to wronging one in his property rights,' "id., at 358-359 (quoting Hammerschmidt v. United States,265 U. S. 182, 188 (1924)).Soon after McNally, in Carpenter v. United States, 484U. S. 19, 25 (1987), we again stated that $ 1341 protects property rights only. Carpenter upheld convictions under $ 1341and the federal wire fraud statute, 18 U. S. C. $ 1343, ofdefendants who had defrauded the Wall Street Journal ofconfidential business information. Citing decisions of thisCourt as well as a corporate law treatise, we observed that"[c]onfidential business information has long been recognizedas property." 484 U. S., at 26.The following year, Congress amended the law specificallyto cover one of the "intangible rights" that lower courts had531US1 Unit: $$U3 [04-13-02 14:36:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN20 CLEVELAND v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtprotected under $ 1341 prior to McNally: "the intangibleright of honest services." Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988,$ 7603(a), 18 U. S. C. $ 1346. Significantly, Congress coveredonly the intangible right of honest services even though federal courts, relying on McNally, had dismissed, for want ofmonetary loss to any victim, prosecutions under $ 1341 fordiverse forms of public corruption, including licensing fraud.3IIIIn this case, there is no assertion that Louisiana's videopoker licensing scheme implicates the intangible right ofhonest services. The question presented is whether, forpurposes of the federal mail fraud statute, a government regulator parts with "property" when it issues a license. Forthe reasons we now set out, we hold that $ 1341 does notreach fraud in obtaining a state or municipal license of thekind here involved, for such a license is not "property" in thegovernment regulator's hands. Again, as we said in Mc-Nally, "[i]f Congress desires to go further, it must speakmore clearly than it has." 483 U. S., at 360.To begin with, we think it beyond genuine dispute thatwhatever interests Louisiana might be said to have in itsvideo poker licenses, the State's core concern isregulatory.Louisiana recognizes the importance of "public confidenceand trust that gaming activities . . . are conducted honestly3 For example, in United States v. Murphy, 836 F. 2d 248, 254 (CA61988), the court overturned the mail fraud conviction of a state officialcharged with using false information to help a charitable organization obtain a state bingo license. Acknowledging "the McNally limitations" on$ 1341, the court said that the issue "distills to a consideration of whetherTennessee's `right to control or object' with respect to the issuance of abingo permit to a charitable organization constitutes `property.' " Id., at253. It then held that "the certificate of registration or the bingo licensemay well be `property' once issued, insofar as the charitable organizationis concerned, but certainly an unissued certificate of registration is notproperty of the State of Tennessee and once issued, it is not the propertyof the State of Tennessee." Id., at 253-254.531US1 Unit: $$U3 [04-13-02 14:36:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN21Cite as: 531 U. S. 12 (2000)Opinion of the Courtand are free from criminal and corruptive elements." La.Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 27:306(A)(1) (West Supp. 2000). The videopoker licensing statute accordingly asserts the State's "legit-imate interest in providing strict regulation of all persons,practices, associations, and activities related to the operationof . . . establishments licensed to offer video draw poker devices." Ibid. The statute assigns the Office of State Police,a part of the Department of Public Safety and Corrections,the responsibility to promulgate rules and regulations concerning the licensing process. $ 27:308(A). It also author-izes the State Police to deny, condition, suspend, or revokelicenses, to levy fines of up to $1,000 per violation of any rule,and to inspect all premises where video poker devices areoffered for play. $$ 27:308(B), (E)(1). In addition, the statute defines criminal penalties for unauthorized use of videopoker devices, $ 27:309, and prescribes detailed suitabilityrequirements for licensees, $ 27:310.In short, the statute establishes a typical regulatory program. It licenses, subject to certain conditions, engagementin pursuits that private actors may not undertake withoutofficial authorization. In this regard, it resembles other licensing schemes long characterized by this Court as exercises of state police powers. E. g., Ziffrin, Inc. v. Reeves,308 U. S. 132, 138 (1939) (license to transport alcoholic beverages); Hall v. Geiger-Jones Co., 242 U. S. 539, 558 (1917)(license to sell corporate stock); Fanning v. Gregoire, 16How. 524, 534 (1854) (ferry license); License Cases, 5 How.504, 589 (1847) (license to sell liquor) (opinion of McLean,J.), overruled on other grounds, Leisy v. Hardin, 135 U. S.100 (1890).Acknowledging Louisiana's regulatory interests, the Government offers two reasons why the State also has a property interest in its video poker licenses. First, the Statereceives a substantial sum of money in exchange for eachlicense and continues to receive payments from the licenseeas long as the license remains in effect. Second, the State531US1 Unit: $$U3 [04-13-02 14:36:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN22 CLEVELAND v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courthas significant control over the issuance, renewal, suspension, and revocation of licenses.Without doubt, Louisiana has a substantial economic stakein the video poker industry. The State collects an upfront"processing fee" for each new license application, La. Rev.Stat. Ann. $ 27:311(H)(2) (West Supp. 2000) ($10,000 for truckstops), a separate "processing fee" for each renewal application, $ 27:311(H)(4) ($1,000 for truck stops), an "annual fee"from each device owner, $ 27:311(A)(4) ($2,000), an additional"device operation" fee, $ 27:311(A)(5)(c) ($1,000 for truckstops), and, most importantly, a fixed percentage of net revenue from each video poker device, $ 27:311(D)(1)(b) (32.5% fortruck stops). It is hardly evident, however, why these tollsshould make video poker licenses "property" in the hands ofthe State. The State receives the lion's share of its expected revenue not while the licenses remain in its ownhands, but only after they have been issued to licensees. Licenses pre-issuance do not generate an ongoing stream ofrevenue. At most, they entitle the State to collect a processing fee from applicants for new licenses. Were an entitlement of this order sufficient to establish a state propertyright, one could scarcely avoid the conclusion that Stateshave property rights in any license or permit requiring anupfront fee, including drivers' licenses, medical licenses, andfishing and hunting licenses. Such licenses, as the Government itself concedes, are "purely regulatory." Tr. of OralArg. 24-25.Tellingly, as to the character of Louisiana's stake in itsvideo poker licenses, the Government nowhere alleges thatCleveland defrauded the State of any money to which theState was entitled by law. Indeed, there is no dispute thatTSG paid the State of Louisiana its proper share of revenue,which totaled more than $1.2 million, between 1993 and 1995.If Cleveland defrauded the State of "property," the natureof that property cannot be economic.531US1 Unit: $$U3 [04-13-02 14:36:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN23Cite as: 531 U. S. 12 (2000)Opinion of the CourtAddressing this concern, the Government argues thatCleveland frustrated the State's right to control the issuance,renewal, and revocation of video poker licenses under La.Rev. Stat. Ann. $$ 27:306, 27:308 (West Supp. 2000). TheFifth Circuit has characterized the protected interest as"Louisiana's right to choose the persons to whom it issuesvideo poker licenses." Salvatore, 110 F. 3d, at 1140. Butfar from composing an interest that "has long been recognized as property," Carpenter, 484 U. S., at 26, these intangible rights of allocation, exclusion, and control amount to nomore and no less than Louisiana's sovereign power to regulate. Notably, the Government overlooks the fact that theserights include the distinctively sovereign authority to imposecriminal penalties for violations of the licensing scheme, La.Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 27:309 (West Supp. 2000), including makingfalse statements in a license application, $ 27:309(A). Evenwhen tied to an expected stream of revenue, the State's rightof control does not create a property interest any more thana law licensing liquor sales in a State that levies a sales taxon liquor. Such regulations are paradigmatic exercises ofthe States' traditional police powers.The Government compares the State's interest in videopoker licenses to a patent holder's interest in a patent thatshe has not yet licensed. Although it is true that both involve the right to exclude, we think the congruence endsthere. Louisiana does not conduct gaming operations itself,it does not hold video poker licenses to reserve that prerogative, and it does not "sell" video poker licenses in the ordinary commercial sense. Furthermore, while a patent holdermay sell her patent, see 35 U. S. C. $ 261 ("patents shall havethe attributes of personal property"), the State may not sellits licensing authority. Instead of a patent holder's interestin an unlicensed patent, the better analogy is to the FederalGovernment's interest in an unissued patent. That interest,like the State's interest in licensing video poker operations,531US1 Unit: $$U3 [04-13-02 14:36:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN24 CLEVELAND v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtsurely implicates the Government's role as sovereign, not asproperty holder. See U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 8.The Government also compares the State's licensing powerto a franchisor's right to select its franchisees. On this view,Louisiana's video poker licensing scheme represents theState's venture into the video poker business. Although theState could have chosen to run the business itself, the Government says, it decided to franchise private entities to carryout the operations instead. However, a franchisor's right toselect its franchisees typically derives from its ownership ofa trademark, brand name, business strategy, or other product that it may trade or sell in the open market. Louisiana'sauthority to select video poker licensees rests on no similarasset. It rests instead upon the State's sovereign right toexclude applicants deemed unsuitable to run video poker operations. A right to exclude in that governing capacity isnot one appropriately labeled "property." See Tr. of OralArg. 25. Moreover, unlike an entrepreneur or businesspartner who shares both losses and gains arising from a business venture, Louisiana cannot be said to have put its laboror capital at risk through its fee-laden licensing scheme. Inshort, the State did not decide to venture into the videopoker business; it decided typically to permit, regulate, andtax private operators of the games.We reject the Government's theories of property rightsnot simply because they stray from traditional concepts ofproperty. We resist the Government's reading of $ 1341 aswell because it invites us to approve a sweeping expansionof federal criminal jurisdiction in the absence of a clear statement by Congress. Equating issuance of licenses or permitswith deprivation of property would subject to federal mailfraud prosecution a wide range of conduct traditionally regulated by state and local authorities. We note in this regardthat Louisiana's video poker statute typically and unambiguously imposes criminal penalties for making false statementson license applications. La. Rev. Stat.

As we reiterated last Term, " `unlessCongress conveys its purpose clearly, it will not be deemedto have significantly changed the federal-state balance' in theprosecution of crimes." Jones v. United States, 529 U. S.848, 858 (2000) (quoting United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336,349 (1971)).Moreover, to the extent that the word "property" is ambig-uous as placed in $ 1341, we have instructed that "ambiguityconcerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolvedin favor of lenity."Rewis v. United States, 401 U. S. 808,812 (1971). This interpretive guide is especially appropriatein construing $ 1341 because, as this case demonstrates, mailfraud is a predicate offense under RICO, 18 U. S. C. $ 1961(1)(1994 ed., Supp. IV), and the money laundering statute,$ 1956(c)(7)(A). In deciding what is "property" under $ 1341,we think "it is appropriate, before we choose the harsheralternative, to require that Congress should have spoken inlanguage that is clear and definite." United States v. Universal C. I. T. Credit Corp., 344 U. S. 218, 222 (1952).Finally, in an argument not raised below but urged as analternate ground for affirmance, the Government contendsthat $ 1341, as amended in 1909, defines two independent offenses: (1) "any scheme or artifice to defraud" and (2) "anyscheme or artifice . . . for obtaining money or property bymeans of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, orpromises." Because a video poker license is property in thehands of the licensee, the Government says, Cleveland "ob-tain[ed] . . . property" and thereby committed the secondoffense even if the license is not property in the hands ofthe State.Although we do not here question that video poker licens-ees may have property interests in their licenses,4 we never4 Notwithstanding the State's declaration that "[a]ny license issued orrenewed . . . is not property or a protected interest under the constitutionsof either the United States or the state of Louisiana," La.

S., at 358. But we rejected that construction of thestatute, instead concluding that the second phrase simplymodifies the first by "ma[king] it unmistakable that the stat-ute reached false promises and misrepresentations as to thefuture as well as other frauds involving money or property."Id., at 359. Indeed, directly contradicting the Government'sview, we said that "the mail fraud statute . . . had its originin the desire to protect individual property rights, and anybenefit which the Government derives from the statute mustbe limited to the Government's interests as property holder."Id., at 359, n. 8 (emphasis added). We reaffirm our readingof $ 1341 in McNally. See Hilton v. South Carolina PublicRailways Comm'n, 502 U. S. 197, 205 (1991) ("stare decisisis most compelling" where "a pure question of statutory con-struction" is involved). Were the Government correct thatthe second phrase of $ 1341 defines a separate offense, thestatute would appear to arm federal prosecutors with powerto police false statements in an enormous range of submis-sions to state and local authorities. For reasons alreadystated, see supra, at 24-25, we decline to attribute to $ 1341a purpose so encompassing where Congress has not madesuch a design clear. IVWe conclude that $ 1341 requires the object of the fraud tobe "property" in the victim's hands and that a Louisianaconstitutes `property' or `rights to property' is a matter of federal law,"Drye v. United States, 528 U. S. 49, 58 (1999) (citing United States v. National Bank of Commerce, 472 U. S. 713, 727 (1985)). In some contexts,we have held that individuals have constitutionally protected propertyinterests in state-issued licenses essential to pursuing an occupation orlivelihood. See, e. g., Bell v. Burson, 402 U. S. 535, 539 (1971) (driver'slicense).531US1 Unit: $$U3 [04-13-02 14:36:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN27Cite as: 531 U.

Absent clear statement by Congress, we willnot read the mail fraud statute to place under federal super-intendence a vast array of conduct traditionally policed bythe States.

Accordingly, the judgment of theUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is re-versed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.
