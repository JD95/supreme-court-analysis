Under a rule adopted by the Commissioner of Social Security, in determining whether a claimant is entitled to SocialSecurity disability benefits, special weight is accorded opinions of the claimant's treating physician. See 20 CFR$$ 404.1527(d)(2), 416.927(d)(2) (2002). This case presentsthe question whether a similar "treating physician rule" applies to disability determinations under employee benefitsplans covered by the Employee Retirement Income SecurityAct of 1974 (ERISA or Act), 88 Stat. 832, as amended, 29U. S. C. $ 1001 et seq. We hold that plan administrators arenot obliged to accord special deference to the opinions oftreating physicians.ERISA and the Secretary of Labor's regulations under theAct require "full and fair" assessment of claims and clearcommunication to the claimant of the "specific reasons" forbenefit denials. See 29 U. S. C. $ 1133; 29 CFR $ 2560.503-1(2002). But these measures do not command plan administrators to credit the opinions of treating physicians overother evidence relevant to the claimant's medical condition.Because the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit erroneously applied a "treating physician rule" to a disability plangoverned by ERISA, we vacate that court's judgment andremand for further proceedings.IPetitioner Black & Decker Disability Plan (Plan), anERISA-governed employee welfare benefit plan, covers employees of Black & Decker Corporation (Black & Decker) andcertain of its subsidiaries. The Plan provides benefits foreligible employees with a "disability." As relevant here, thePlan defines "disability" to mean "the complete inability . . .of a Participant to engage in his regular occupation with538US2 Unit: $U60 [10-27-04 17:16:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN826 BLACK & DECKER DISABILITY PLAN v. NORDOpinion of the Courtthe Employer." 1 296 F. 3d 823, 826, n. 2 (CA9 2002).Black & Decker both funds the Plan and acts as plan administrator, but it has delegated authority to Metropolitan LifeInsurance Company (MetLife) to render initial recommendations on benefit claims. Disability determinations, theBlack & Decker Plan provides, "[are to] be made by the [planadministrator] based on suitable medical evidence and a re-view of the Participant's employment history that the [planadministrator] deems satisfactory in its sole and absolute dis-cretion."Id., at 826, n. 1.Respondent Kenneth L. Nord was formerly employed bya Black & Decker subsidiary as a material planner. His job,classed "sedentary," required up to six hours of sitting andtwo hours of standing or walking per day. Id., at 826.In 1997, Nord consulted Dr. Leo Hartman about hip andback pain. Dr. Hartman determined that Nord suffers froma mild degenerative disc disease, a diagnosis confirmed by aMagnetic Resonance Imaging scan. After a week's trial onpain medication prescribed by Dr. Hartman, Nord's conditionremained unimproved. Dr. Hartman told Nord to ceasework temporarily, and recommended that he consult an orthopedist while continuing to take the pain medication.Nord submitted a claim for disability benefits under thePlan, which MetLife denied in February 1998. Nord nextexercised his right to seek further consideration by MetLife's "Group Claims Review." Id., at 827. At that stage,Nord submitted letters and supporting documentation fromDr. Hartman and a treating orthopedist to whom Hartmanhad referred Nord. Nord also submitted a questionnaireform, drafted by Nord's counsel, headed "Work CapacityEvaluation." Black & Decker human resources representa1 The Plan sets out a different standard for determining whether anemployee is entitled to benefits for a period longer than 30 months. Because respondent Nord sought benefits "for up to 30 months," 296 F. 3d823, 826 (CA9 2002), the standard for longer term disability is not in playin this case.538US2 Unit: $U60 [10-27-04 17:16:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN827Cite as: 538 U.

Forwardmarked a space labeled "no."During the MetLife review process, Black & Decker referred Nord to neurologist Antoine Mitri for an independentexamination. Dr. Mitri agreed with Nord's doctors thatNord suffered from a degenerative disc disease and chronicpain. But aided by pain medication, Dr. Mitri concluded,Nord could perform "sedentary work with some walking interruption in between." Id., at L-45. MetLife thereaftermade a final recommendation to deny Nord's claim.Black & Decker accepted MetLife's recommendation and,on October 27, 1998, so informed Nord. The notification letter summarized the conclusions of Nord's doctors, the resultsof diagnostic tests, and the opinion of Dr. Mitri. See id., atL-155 to L-156. It also recounted that Black & Decker hadforwarded Dr. Mitri's report to Nord's counsel with a requestfor comment by Nord's attending physician. Although Nordhad submitted additional information, the letter continued,he had "provided . . . no new or different information thatwould change [MetLife's] original decision." Id., at L-156.The letter further stated that the Work Capacity Evaluationform completed by Black & Decker human resources representative Forward was "not sufficient to reverse [the Plan's]decision."

On cross-motions for summary judgment,the District Court granted judgment for the Plan, concludingthat Black & Decker's denial of Nord's claim was not anabuse of the plan administrator's discretion.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit roundly re-versed and itself "grant[ed] Nord's motion for summary judgment." 296 F. 3d, at 832. Nord's appeal, the Ninth Circuitexplained, was controlled by that court's recent decision inRegula v. Delta Family-Care Disability Survivorship Plan,266 F. 3d 1130 (2001). 296 F. 3d, at 829. The Ninth Circuithad held inRegula that, when making benefit determinations, ERISA plan administrators must follow a "treatingphysician rule." See 266 F. 3d, at 1139-1144. As describedby the appeals court, the rule required an administrator"who rejects [the] opinions [of a claimant's treating physician]to come forward with specific reasons for his decision, basedon substantial evidence in the record." Id., at 1139. Declaring that Nord was entitled to judgment as a matter oflaw, the Ninth Circuit emphasized that Black & Decker fellshort under the treating physician rule: The plan administrator had not provided adequate justification, the Court of Appeals said, for rejecting opinions held by Dr. Hartman andothers treating Nord on Hartman's recommendation. 296F. 3d, at 830-832.We granted certiorari, 537 U. S. 1098 (2002), in view ofthe division among the Circuits on the propriety of judicialinstallation of a treating physician rule for disability claimswithin ERISA's domain. Compare Regula, 266 F. 3d, at1139; Donaho v. FMC Corp., 74 F. 3d 894, 901 (CA8 1996),with Elliott v.

Con-cluding that courts have no warrant to order application ofa treating physician rule to employee benefit claims madeunder ERISA, we vacate the Ninth Circuit's judgment andremand the case for further proceedings.2IIThe treating physician rule at issue here was originallydeveloped by Courts of Appeals as a means to control disability determinations by administrative law judges under theSocial Security Act, 49 Stat. 620, 42 U. S. C. $ 231 et seq. SeeMaccaro, The Treating Physician Rule and the Adjudicationof Claims for Social Security Disability Benefits, 41 Soc. Sec.Rep. Serv. 833, 833-834 (1993). In 1991, the Commissionerof Social Security adopted regulations approving and formalizing use of the rule in the Social Security disability pro-gram. See 56 Fed. Reg. 36961, 36968 (codified at 20 CFR$$ 404.1527(d)(2), 416.927(d)(2) (2002)). The Social SecurityAdministration, the regulations inform, will generally "givemore weight to opinions from . . . treating sources," and "willalways give good reasons in our notice of determination ordecision for the weight we give your treating source's opin-ion." $$ 404.1527(d)(2), 416.927(d)(2).Concluding that a treating physician rule should similarlygovern private benefit plans under ERISA, the Ninth Circuitsaid in Regula that its "reasons ha[d] to do with commonsense as well as consistency in [ judicial] review of disabilitydeterminations where benefits are protected by federal law."266 F. 3d, at 1139. "Just as in the Social Security context,"the court observed, "the disputed issue in ERISA disabilitydeterminations concerns whether the facts of the beneficiary's case entitle him to benefits." Ibid. The Ninth Circuit2 The Plan sought review only of the Court of Appeals' holding "that anERISA disability plan administrator's determination of disability is subject to the `treating physician rule.'

Bruch, 489 U. S. 101, 113 (1989) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The Act furthers theseaims in part by regulating the manner in which plans processbenefits claims. Plans must "provide adequate notice inwriting to any participant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the plan has been denied, setting forth the specificreasons for such denial, written in a manner calculated tobe understood by the participant." 29 U. S. C. $ 1133(1).ERISA further requires that plan procedures "afford a rea3 The treating physician rule has not attracted universal adherence outside the Social Security context. Some courts have approved a rule similar to the Social Security Commissioner's for disability determinationsunder the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 33 U. S. C.$ 901 et seq., see, e. g., Pietrunti v. Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, 119 F. 3d 1035, 1042 (CA2 1997), and the Secretary ofLabor has adopted a version of the rule for benefit determinations underthe Black Lung Benefits Act, 30 U. S. C. $ 901 et seq., see 20 CFR$ 718.104(d)(5) (2002). One Court of Appeals, however, has rejected atreating physician rule for the assessment of claims of entitlement to veterans' benefits for service-connected disabilities, see White v. Principi,243 F. 3d 1378, 1381 (CA Fed. 2001), and another has rejected such a rulefor disability determinations under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974,45 U. S. C. $ 231 et seq., see Dray v. Railroad Retirement Bd., 10 F. 3d1306, 1311 (CA7 1993). Furthermore, there appears to be no uniformpractice regarding application of a treating physician rule under stateworkers' compensation statutes. See Conradt v. Mt. Carmel School, 197Wis. 2d 60, 69, 539 N. W. 2d 713, 717 (Ct.

Nothing in theAct itself, however, suggests that plan administrators mustaccord special deference to the opinions of treating physicians. Nor does the Act impose a heightened burden of ex-planation on administrators when they reject a treating physician's opinion.ERISA empowers the Secretary of Labor to "prescribesuch regulations as he finds necessary or appropriate tocarry out" the statutory provisions securing employee bene-fit rights. $ 1135; see $ 1133 (plans shall process claims "[i]naccordance with regulations of the Secretary"). The Secretary's regulations do not instruct plan administrators to accord extra respect to treating physicians' opinions. See 29CFR $ 2560.503-1 (1997) (regulations in effect when Nordfiled his claim); 29 CFR $ 2560.503-1 (2002) (current regulations). Notably, the most recent version of the Secretary'sregulations, which installs no treating physician rule, issuedmore than nine years after the Social Security Administration codified a treating physician rule in that agency's regulations. Compare 56 Fed. Reg. 36932, 36961 (1991), with 65Fed. Reg. 70265 (2000).If the Secretary of Labor found it meet to adopt a treating physician rule by regulation, courts would examine thatdetermination with appropriate deference. See ChevronU. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467U. S. 837 (1984). The Secretary has not chosen that course,however, and an amicus brief reflecting the position of theDepartment of Labor opposes adoption of such a rule fordisability determinations under plans covered by ERISA.See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 7-27. Although Congress "expect[ed]" courts would develop "a federal common law of rights and obligations under ERISAregulated plans," Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S.41, 56 (1987), the scope of permissible judicial innovation isnarrower in areas where other federal actors are engaged,538US2 Unit: $U60 [10-27-04 17:16:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN832 BLACK & DECKER DISABILITY PLAN v. NORDOpinion of the Courtcf. Milwaukee v. Illinois, 451 U. S. 304, 317-332 (1981) (be-cause Congress had enacted a comprehensive regulatory program dealing with discharge of pollutants into the Nation'swaters, the State could not maintain a federal common-lawnuisance action against the city based on the latter's pollu-tion of Lake Michigan).The question whether a treating physician rule would "increas[e] the accuracy of disability determinations" underERISA plans, as the Ninth Circuit believed it would,Regula,266 F. 3d, at 1139, moreover, seems to us one the Legislatureor superintending administrative agency is best positionedto address. As compared to consultants retained by a plan,it may be true that treating physicians, as a rule, "ha[ve] agreater opportunity to know and observe the patient as anindividual." Ibid. (internal quotation marks and citationomitted). Nor do we question the Court of Appeals' concernthat physicians repeatedly retained by benefits plans mayhave an "incentive to make a finding of `not disabled' in orderto save their employers money and to preserve their ownconsulting arrangements." Id., at 1143. But the assumption that the opinions of a treating physician warrant greatercredit than the opinions of plan consultants may make scantsense when, for example, the relationship between the claimant and the treating physician has been of short duration, orwhen a specialist engaged by the plan has expertise thetreating physician lacks. And if a consultant engaged by aplan may have an "incentive" to make a finding of "not disabled," so a treating physician, in a close case, may favor afinding of "disabled." Intelligent resolution of the questionwhether routine deference to the opinion of a claimant'streating physician would yield more accurate disability determinations, it thus appears, might be aided by empiricalinvestigation of the kind courts are ill equipped to conduct.Finally, and of prime importance, critical differences between the Social Security disability program and ERISAbenefit plans caution against importing a treating physician538US2 Unit: $U60 [10-27-04 17:16:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN833Cite as: 538 U. S. 822 (2003)Opinion of the Courtrule from the former area into the latter. The Social Se-curity Act creates a nationwide benefits program fundedby Federal Insurance Contributions Act payments, see 26U. S. C. $$ 3101(a), 3111(a), and superintended by the Commissioner of Social Security. To cope with the "more than2.5 million claims for disability benefits [filed] each year,"Cleveland v. Policy Management Systems Corp., 526 U. S.795, 803 (1999), the Commissioner has published detailed reg-ulations governing benefits adjudications. See,e. g., id., at803-804. Presumptions employed in the Commissioner'sregulations "grow out of the need to administer a large benefits system efficiently." Id., at 804. By accepting and codifying a treating physician rule, the Commissioner sought toserve that need. Along with other regulations, the treatingphysician rule works to foster uniformity and regularity inSocial Security benefits determinations made in the first instance by a corps of administrative law judges.In contrast to the obligatory, nationwide Social Securityprogram, "[n]othing in ERISA requires employers to establish employee benefits plans. Nor does ERISA mandatewhat kind of benefits employers must provide if they chooseto have such a plan." Lockheed Corp. v. Spink, 517 U. S.882, 887 (1996). Rather, employers have large leeway to design disability and other welfare plans as they see fit. Indetermining entitlement to Social Security benefits, the adjudicator measures the claimant's condition against a uniformset of federal criteria. "[T]he validity of a claim to benefitsunder an ERISA plan," on the other hand, "is likely to turn,"in large part, "on the interpretation of terms in the plan atissue." Firestone Tire, 489 U. S., at 115. It is the Secretary of Labor's view that ERISA is best served by "preserv[ing] the greatest flexibility possible for . . . operating claimsprocessing systems consistent with the prudent administration of a plan."

NORDOpinion of the Court(available in Clerk of Court's case file). Deference is duethat view.Plan administrators, of course, may not arbitrarily refuseto credit a claimant's reliable evidence, including the opinionsof a treating physician. But, we hold, courts have no war-rant to require administrators automatically to accord specialweight to the opinions of a claimant's physician; nor maycourts impose on plan administrators a discrete burden ofexplanation when they credit reliable evidence that conflictswith a treating physician's evaluation.4 The Court of Appeals therefore erred when it employed a treating physicianrule lacking Department of Labor endorsement in holdingthat Nord was entitled to summary judgment.* * *For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United StatesCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is vacated, and thecase is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.
