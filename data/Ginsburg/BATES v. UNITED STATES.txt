This case concerns the meaning of $ 490(a) (Pub. L. 99-498), 100 Stat. 1491, as added, 20 U. S. C. $ 1097(a) (1988 ed.),which declared it a felony "knowingly and willfully" tomisapply student loan funds insured under Title IV of theHigher Education Act of 1965. The United States acknowl-edges that $ 1097(a) demanded allegation and proof of thedefendant's intentional conversion of loan funds to his ownuse or the use of a third party. The question presented iswhether $ 1097(a) demanded, in addition, allegation and proofthat the defendant specifically intended to injure or defraudsomeone--either the United States as loan guarantor, as theDistrict Court read the measure, or another. We hold, inaccord with the Court of Appeals, that specific intent toinjure or defraud someone, whether the United States oranother, is not an element of the misapplication of fundsproscribed by $ 1097(a).IThe indictment in this case, App. 2-12, alleged the follow-ing facts.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtEducation America, Inc., a for-profit consulting and management firm for technical and vocational schools. In December 1986, the Jacksons acquired the Acme Institute of Technology, a not-for-profit technical school located in SouthBend, Indiana, which offered associate degree programs inelectronic engineering, and tool, die, and plastics mold design. After the acquisition, the Jacksons appointed Bates--then the vice president of Education America--to serve astreasurer of Acme's board of trustees.On April 30, 1987, James Jackson, as president of Acme,signed a program participation agreement with the Department of Education that authorized the school to receive student loan checks through the Title IV federal GuaranteedStudent Loan (GSL) program. See 20 U. S. C. $ 1070 et seq.(1988 ed.).1 Acme's participation hinged upon both its continued accreditation by an approved accrediting associationand Jackson's promise to comply with all applicable statutesand regulations.Under the GSL program, banks and other private institutions lent money to Acme students for tuition and othereducational expenses. The Federal Government administered the program and guaranteed payment if a studentborrower defaulted. Acme would receive a loan check directly from the lender, endorse the check, and credit theamount of the check against the student's tuition debt. If aGSL student withdrew from Acme before the term ended,the governing regulations, 34 CFR $$ 668.22 and 682.606(1990), required Acme to return to the lender a portion of theloan proceeds, based upon how late in the term the student1 In 1992, Congress amended the GSL program and renamed it the Federal Family Education Loan Program.

Because the indictmentin this case concerns only pre-1992 conduct, we refer to the program asthe GSL program.522US1 Unit: $$U3 [01-27-00 18:58:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN27Cite as: 522 U.

The lenderwould then deduct the refund from the amount that the stu-dent owed. If Acme did not refund the loans to the lender,the student--and if she defaulted, the Government--wouldremain liable for the full amount of the loan.Around the end of 1987, pursuant to decisions made by theJacksons and Bates, Acme initiated a pattern and practice ofnot making GSL refunds. On April 14, 1988, James Jacksonsent a letter to Acme's director ordering him, effective thefollowing month, to "tally [Acme's] receipts for the precedingmonth and remit a management fee of 10% of [the] total receipts to Education America, Inc." App. 4. The letter alsotold the director to pay the Jacksons a monthly salary. Theletter further stated: "If the above creates a cash shortfallin your school, money will be loaned back to you to cover theshortfall." See ibid. Bates, serving as Acme's chief finan-cial officer, permitted these fee and salary payments to takepriority over the GSL refunds, and specifically instructedother Acme employees not to make the required GSL refunds. In late 1988 or early 1989, Education America offi-cials ordered Acme to stop using a special bank account thatsegregated the unearned student-loaned tuition from thegeneral account. Acme's former owners had used this special account to ensure that funds were always available fortimely refunds to lenders.By October 1988, Acme had amassed roughly $55,000 inunmade GSL refunds. Acme's financial aid director sentJames Jackson a letter in January 1989 to draw Jackson'sattention to the gravity of the unmade refunds, which then2 The Department of Education since has consolidated the requirementsof $$ 668.22 and 682.606 into the current $ 668.22.

By March 1989, Acme's refund liability hadgrown to approximately $85,000. In a letter dated March13, 1989, Bates, as Education America's vice president, re-leased Acme's financial aid director from all responsibilityconcerning GSL refunds, as she had requested. The letterstated that unmade refunds were "solely the responsibilityand decision of the corporate office." Seeid., at 5.In April 1989, the National Association of Trade and Tech-nical Schools, a national accrediting association, conducted anon-site audit of Acme to determine whether it should con-tinue to accredit the school. A month later, the Associationreported to the Department of Education that Acme had "inadequately demonstrated its ability to make appropriate andtimely refunds," and had "loaned substantial amounts ofmoney to [James Jackson,] the chief trustee." The reportalso noted evidence that management fees had been "upstream[ed]" to Education America. See ibid. Acme subsequently lost its accreditation, and the Department of Education notified the school on April 7, 1990, that effective March8, 1990, Acme was no longer eligible to participate in theGSL program. On June 5, 1990, Acme ceased operations.During Bates's tenure as Acme's chief financial officer, theschool amassed $139,649 in unmade refunds, not includinginterest and certain special allowances.On September 8, 1994, a federal grand jury indicted Bateson twelve counts of "knowingly and willfully misapply[ing],"id., at 11, federally insured student loan funds between January 15, 1990, and June 15, 1990, in violation of 20 U. S. C.$ 1097(a) (1988 ed.) and 18 U. S. C. $ 2 (1988 ed.). On February 7, 1995, Bates filed a motion to dismiss the indictment.He argued, and the District Court agreed, that convictionunder $ 1097(a) for willful misapplication required an allegation of the defendant's "intent to injure or defraud theUnited States." 96 F. 3d 964, 967 (CA7 1996). Because theindictment lacked such an allegation, the District Court dismissed it.522US1 Unit: $$U3 [01-27-00 18:58:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN29Cite as: 522 U. S. 23 (1997)Opinion of the CourtOn appeal, the Seventh Circuit vacated the DistrictCourt's judgment and reinstated the prosecution. 96 F. 3d964 (1996). The Court of Appeals concluded that $ 1097(a)required the Government to prove only that "the defendantmisapplied--i. e., converted--Title IV funds and that he didso knowingly and willfully."Id., at 970. The Seventh Cir-cuit's decision conflicts with the Eleventh Circuit's decisionin United States v. Kammer, 1 F. 3d 1161, 1165-1166 (1993),which held that $ 1097(a) requires the Government to allegeand prove that the defendant had an "intent to defraud" theUnited States. We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict, 519 U. S. 1108 (1997), and now affirm the Seventh Cir-cuit's judgment.IIOur inquiry begins with the text of 20 U. S. C. $ 1097(a)(1988 ed.). At the time of the offenses charged in the indictment, the measure provided in relevant part: "Any personwho knowingly and willfully embezzles, misapplies, steals, orobtains by fraud, false statement, or forgery any funds,assets, or property provided or insured under this subchapter . . . shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisonedfor not more than 5 years, or both."3The text of $ 1097(a) does not include an "intent to de-fraud" state of mind requirement, and we ordinarily resistreading words or elements into a statute that do not appearon its face. In contrast, $ 1097(d), enacted at the same timeas $ 1097(a), makes it a felony "knowingly and willfully" to"destro[y] or concea[l] any record relating to the provision ofassistance under [Title IV] with intent to defraud the UnitedStates" (emphasis added). As this Court has reiterated:" `[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the sameAct, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intention3 Higher Education Amendments of 1986, Pub.

"Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (quotingUnited States v. Wong Kim Bo, 472 F. 2d 720, 722 (CA51972)).Despite the contrasting language of $$ 1097(a) and (d),Bates urges that an "intent to defraud" is an essential, albeitunexpressed, element of the offenses charged against him.For this argument, Bates relies primarily upon the DistrictCourt's reasoning in this case. The District Court, like theEleventh Circuit in United States v. Kammer, 1 F. 3d, at1165, looked to decisions interpreting 18 U. S. C. $ 656, whichproscribes willful misapplication of bank funds. The Courtsof Appeals unanimously agree that $ 656 requires the Government to prove that the defendant acted with an intentto "injure or defraud" the bank or "deceive" a bank officer,4even though the statute, on its face, contains no such element.5 In another case involving a different defendantnamed Bates, the Seventh Circuit explained why $ 656 included an "intent to injure or defraud" element:"The current statutory language does not expressly require any proof of [fraudulent or injurious] intent.4 United States v.

S. 23 (1997)Opinion of the CourtOriginally the statute did require proof of intent to `in-jure or defraud' the bank or `deceive' a bank officer butthese words were inadvertently dropped in the courseof a technical revision of the criminal code. To avoidmaking every unauthorized loan by a bank officer a will-ful misapplication of bank funds, courts . . . read themissing words back into the section." United States v.Bates, 852 F. 2d 212, 215 (1988).Assuming, without deciding, that the Seventh Circuit'sreading of $ 656 is correct, $ 1097(a) never contained, as $ 656did, an "intent to defraud" requirement, a requirement pres-ent from the start and still contained in $ 1097(d). In short,there is here neither text nor history warranting the con-struction of $ 1097(a) that Bates urges us to adopt.6Nor does $ 1097(a) set a "trap for the unwary," as the Sev-enth Circuit suggested $ 656 would if read to render felonious"every unauthorized loan by a bank officer." See Bates, 852F. 2d, at 215. Under the Seventh Circuit's construction,$ 1097(a) catches only the transgressor who intentionally ex-ercises unauthorized dominion over federally insured student loan funds for his own benefit or for the benefit of athird party. "[I]nnocent . . . maladministration of a businessenterprise" or a use of funds that is simply "unwise," seeBrief for Petitioner 5, does not fit within that construction.76 Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U. S. 135 (1994), does not bear on ourdecision today. Ratzlaf decided only, in the particular statutory contextof currency structuring, that knowledge of illegality was an element of 31U. S. C. $ 5322(a) as that provision was then framed. Ratzlaf did not involve the question presented here regarding $ 1097(a), which is whether,in addition to a knowledge requirement, the Government must allege andprove an "intent to injure or defraud."7 The Seventh Circuit's "working definition" of $ 1097(a) reads:"[W]illful misapplication under $ 1097(a) requires the government to allegeand prove that the defendant consciously, voluntarily, and intentionallyexercised unauthorized control or dominion over federally provided orguaranteed Title IV funds that interfered with the rights of the funds'true owner(s), for the use and benefit of the defendant or a third person,522US1 Unit: $$U3 [01-27-00 18:58:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN32 BATES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtBates also relies on a 1992 amendment to $ 1097(a), whichadded "fails to refund" to the provision's text.8 This change,Bates argues, establishes that the deliberate failure to return GSL funds, without an intent to defraud, was not previously an offense within $ 1097(a)'s compass, but became oneonly under the statute's current text. Congress' 1992amendment hardly means that $ 1097(a) did not previouslycover the conduct in question. Cf. Commissioner v. Estateof Sternberger, 348 U. S. 187, 194 (1955) ("Subsequent amendments have clarified and not changed th[e earlier] principle."). The three added words--"fails to refund"--simplyforeclose any argument that $ 1097(a) does not reach the failure to make refunds; those words do not make the argumenta persuasive one. See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 102-630, p. 513(1992) ("[F]ailure to pay refunds does constitute criminalmisapplication under current law. Language is added inthis bill merely as a clarification.").Bates finally urges that, to the extent $ 1097(a) is ambiguous, the rule of lenity supports interpretation of the provision to include fraudulent intent as an essential element ofthe offense of knowing and willful misapplication of funds.As we have explained, however, nothing in the text, strucwhile knowing that such an exercise of control or dominion over the fundswas a violation of the law." 96 F. 3d, at 970.The Government argues that the Seventh Circuit erred in reading$ 1097(a) to require proof that a defendant knew his misapplication violatedthe law. Brief for United States 21-22. However, the Government didnot challenge by cross-petition any part of the Seventh Circuit's decision,so the question whether the defendant must know his conduct was a violation of the law is not before us.8 As amended in 1992, $ 1097(a) reads in relevant part:"Any person who knowingly and willfully embezzles, misapplies, steals,obtains by fraud, false statement, or forgery, or fails to refund any funds,assets, or property provided or insured under this subchapter . . . shall befined not more than $20,000 or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both."Higher Education Amendments of 1992, Pub.

S. 23 (1997)Opinion of the Courtture, or history of $ 1097(a) warrants importation of an "in-tent to defraud" requirement into the misapplication proscription. The rule of lenity, therefore, does not come intoplay. See United States v. Wells, 519 U. S. 482, 499 (1997).The Government need not charge or prove that Bates aimedto injure or defraud anyone, nor is it a defense that Bateshoped the Jacksons, the students, or someone else would paythe amount due the lenders so that the federal fisc wouldsuffer no loss. * * *For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals for the Seventh Circuit is
