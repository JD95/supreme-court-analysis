S. 415 (1996)Opinion of the CourtThe compatibility of these provisions, in an action based onNew York law but tried in federal court by reason of theparties' diverse citizenship, is the issue we confront in thiscase. We hold that New York's law controlling compensation awards for excessiveness or inadequacy can be giveneffect, without detriment to the Seventh Amendment, if thereview standard set out in CPLR $ 5501(c) is applied by thefederal trial court judge, with appellate control of the trialcourt's ruling limited to review for "abuse of discretion."IPetitioner William Gasperini, a journalist for CBS Newsand the Christian Science Monitor, began reporting onevents in Central America in 1984. He earned his livingprimarily in radio and print media and only occasionally soldhis photographic work. During the course of his seven-yearstint in Central America, Gasperini took over 5,000 slidetransparencies, depicting active war zones, political leaders,and scenes from daily life. In 1990, Gasperini agreed tosupply his original color transparencies to The Center forHumanities, Inc. (Center) for use in an educational videotape,Conflict in Central America. Gasperini selected 300 of hisslides for the Center; its videotape included 110 of them.The Center agreed to return the original transparencies, butupon the completion of the project, it could not find them.Gasperini commenced suit in the United States DistrictCourt for the Southern District of New York, invoking thecourt's diversity jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 1332.1He alleged several state-law claims for relief, includingbreach of contract, conversion, and negligence. See App.5-6. The Center conceded liability for the lost transparen-cies and the issue of damages was tried before a jury.1 Plaintiff Gasperini, petitioner here, is a citizen of California; defendantCenter, respondent here, is incorporated, and has its principal place ofbusiness, in New York.518us2$82P 05-18-99 18:37:58 PAGES OPINPGT420 GASPERINI v. CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.Opinion of the CourtAt trial, Gasperini's expert witness testified that the "in-dustry standard" within the photographic publishing community valued a lost transparency at $1,500. See id., at 227.This industry standard, the expert explained, representedthe average license fee a commercial photograph could earnover the full course of the photographer's copyright, i. e., inGasperini's case, his lifetime plus 50 years. Seeid., at 228;see also 17 U. S. C. $ 302(a). Gasperini estimated that hisearnings from photography totaled just over $10,000 for theperiod from 1984 through 1993. He also testified that heintended to produce a book containing his best photographsfrom Central America. See App. 175.After a three-day trial, the jury awarded Gasperini$450,000 in compensatory damages. This sum, the jury foreperson announced, "is [$]1500 each, for 300 slides." Id., at313. Moving for a new trial under Federal Rule of CivilProcedure 59, the Center attacked the verdict on variousgrounds, including excessiveness. Without comment, theDistrict Court denied the motion. See App. to Pet. forCert. 12a.The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated thejudgment entered on the jury's verdict. 66 F. 3d 427 (1995).Mindful that New York law governed the controversy, theCourt of Appeals endeavored to apply CPLR $ 5501(c), whichinstructs that, when a jury returns an itemized verdict, asthe jury did in this case, the New York Appellate Division"shall determine that an award is excessive or inadequate ifit deviates materially from what would be reasonable compensation." The Second Circuit's application of $ 5501(c) asa check on the size of the jury's verdict followed Circuit precedent elaborated two weeks earlier in Consorti v. ArmstrongWorld Industries, Inc., 64 F. 3d 781, superseded, 72 F. 3d1003 (1995). Surveying Appellate Division decisions thatreviewed damage awards for lost transparencies, the SecondCircuit concluded that testimony on industry standard alonewas insufficient to justify a verdict; prime among other fac518us2$82P 05-18-99 18:37:58 PAGES OPINPGT421Cite as: 518 U. S. 415 (1996)Opinion of the Courttors warranting consideration were the uniqueness of theslides' subject matter and the photographer's earning level.2Guided by Appellate Division rulings, the Second Circuitheld that the $450,000 verdict "materially deviates fromwhat is reasonable compensation." 66 F. 3d, at 431. Someof Gasperini's transparencies, the Second Circuit recognized,were unique, notably those capturing combat situations inwhich Gasperini was the only photographer present. Id., at429. But others "depicted either generic scenes or eventsat which other professional photojournalists were present."Id., at 431. No more than 50 slides merited a $1,500 award,the court concluded, after "[g]iving Gasperini every benefitof the doubt." Ibid. Absent evidence showing significantearnings from photographic endeavors or concrete plans topublish a book, the court further determined, any damageaward above $100 each for the remaining slides would beexcessive. Remittiturs "presen[t] difficult problems for appellate courts," the Second Circuit acknowledged, for courtof appeals judges review the evidence from "a cold paperrecord." Ibid. Nevertheless, the Second Circuit set asidethe $450,000 verdict and ordered a new trial, unless Gasperini agreed to an award of $100,000.2 See Blackman v.

CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.Opinion of the CourtThis case presents an important question regarding thestandard a federal court uses to measure the alleged excessiveness of a jury's verdict in an action for damages basedon state law. We therefore granted certiorari. 516 U. S.1086 (1996). IIBefore 1986, state and federal courts in New York gener-ally invoked the same judge-made formulation in respondingto excessiveness attacks on jury verdicts: courts would notdisturb an award unless the amount was so exorbitant thatit "shocked the conscience of the court." See Consorti, 72F. 3d, at 1012-1013 (collecting cases). As described by theSecond Circuit:"The standard for determining excessiveness and theappropriateness of remittitur in New York is somewhatambiguous. Prior to 1986, New York law employed thesame standard as the federal courts,see Matthews v.CTI Container Transport Int'l Inc., 871 F. 2d 270, 278(2d Cir. 1989), which authorized remittitur only if thejury's verdict was so excessive that it `shocked the conscience of the court.' " Id., at 1012.See also D. Siegel, Practice Commentaries C5501:10, re-printed in 7B McKinney's Consolidated Laws of New YorkAnn., p. 25 (1995) ("conventional standard for altering theverdict was that its sum was so great or so small that it`shocked the conscience' of the court").In both state and federal courts, trial judges made theexcessiveness assessment in the first instance, and appellatejudges ordinarily deferred to the trial court's judgment.See, e. g., McAllister v. Adam Packing Corp., 66 App. Div.2d 975, 976, 412 N. Y. S. 2d 50, 52 (3d Dept. 1978) ("The trialcourt's determination as to the adequacy of the jury verdictwill only be disturbed by an appellate court where it canbe said that the trial court's exercise of discretion was notreasonably grounded."); Martell v.

Placed in CPLR $ 5501(c), the prescriptionreads:"In reviewing a money judgment . . . in which it is con-tended that the award is excessive or inadequate andthat a new trial should have been granted unless a stipu-lation is entered to a different award, the appellate division shall determine that an award is excessive or in-adequate if it deviates materially from what would bereasonable compensation." 4As stated in Legislative Findings and Declarations accom-panying New York's adoption of the "deviates materially"formulation, the lawmakers found the "shock the conscience"test an insufficient check on damage awards; the legislaturetherefore installed a standard "invit[ing] more careful appel-late scrutiny." Ch. 266, 1986 N. Y. Laws 470 (McKinney).At the same time, the legislature instructed the AppellateDivision, in amended $ 5522, to state the reasons for thecourt's rulings on the size of verdicts, and the factors the3 The legislature sought, particularly, to curtail medical and dental malpractice, and to contain "already high malpractice premiums."

CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.Opinion of the Courtcourt considered in complying with $ 5501(c).5 In his signingstatement, then-Governor Mario Cuomo emphasized that theCPLR amendments were meant to rachet up the reviewstandard: "This will assure greater scrutiny of the amountof verdicts and promote greater stability in the tort sys-tem and greater fairness for similarly situated defendantsthroughout the State."

Newman eds. 1990) (review standardprescribed in $ 5501(c) "was intended to . . . encourage Appellate Division modification of excessive awards").New York state-court opinions confirm that $ 5501(c)'s "deviates materially" standard calls for closer surveillance than"shock the conscience" oversight. See,e. g., O'Connor v.Graziosi, 131 App. Div. 2d 553, 554, 516 N. Y. S. 2d 276, 277(2d Dept. 1987) ("apparent intent" of 1986 legislation was "tofacilitate appellate changes in verdicts"); Harvey v.

S. 415 (1996)Opinion of the CourtAlthough phrased as a direction to New York's intermediate appellate courts, $ 5501(c)'s "deviates materially" standard, as construed by New York's courts, instructs state trialjudges as well. See, e. g., Inya v. Ide Hyundai, Inc., 209App. Div. 2d 1015, 619 N. Y. S. 2d 440 (4th Dept. 1994) (errorfor trial court to apply "shock the conscience" test to motionto set aside damages; proper standard is whether award"materially deviates from what would be reasonable compensation"); Cochetti v. Gralow, 192 App. Div. 2d 974, 975, 597N. Y. S. 2d 234, 235 (3d Dept. 1993) ("settled law" that trialcourts conduct "materially deviates" inquiry); Shurgan v.Tedesco, 179 App. Div. 2d 805, 806, 578 N. Y. S. 2d 658, 659 (2dDept. 1992) (approving trial court's application of "materiallydeviates" standard); see also Lightfoot v. Union CarbideCorp., 901 F. Supp. 166, 169 (SDNY 1995) (CPLR 5501(c)'s"materially deviates" standard "is pretty well established asapplicable to [state] trial and appellate courts."). Application of $ 5501(c) at the trial level is key to this case.To determine whether an award "deviates materially fromwhat would be reasonable compensation," New York statecourts look to awards approved in similar cases. See, e. g.,Leon v. J & M Peppe Realty Corp., 190 App. Div. 2d 400,416, 596 N. Y. S. 2d 380, 389 (1st Dept. 1993) ("These awards. . . are not out of line with recent awards sustained by appellate courts."); Johnston v. Joyce, 192 App. Div. 2d 1124, 1125,596 N. Y. S. 2d 625, 626 (4th Dept. 1993) (reducing award tomaximum amount previously allowed for similar type ofharm). Under New York's former "shock the conscience"test, courts also referred to analogous cases. See, e. g.,Senko v. Fonda, 53 App. Div. 2d 638, 639, 384 N. Y. S. 2d849, 851 (2d Dept. 1976). The "deviates materially" standard, however, in design and operation, influences outcomesby tightening the range of tolerable awards. See, e. g.,Consorti, 72 F. 3d, at 1013, and n. 10, 1014-1015, andn. 14.518us2$82P 05-18-99 18:37:58 PAGES OPINPGT426 GASPERINI v. CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.Opinion of the CourtIIIIn cases like Gasperini's, in which New York law governsthe claims for relief, does New York law also supply the testfor federal-court review of the size of the verdict? The Cen-ter answers yes. The "deviates materially" standard, it argues, is a substantive standard that must be applied by fed-eral appellate courts in diversity cases. The Second Circuitagreed. See 66 F. 3d, at 430; see also Consorti, 72 F. 3d,at 1011 ("[CPLR $ 5501(c)] is the substantive rule providedby New York law."). Gasperini, emphasizing that $ 5501(c)trains on the New York Appellate Division, characterizes theprovision as procedural, an allocation of decisionmaking au-thority regarding damages, not a hard cap on the amountrecoverable. Correctly comprehended, Gasperini urges,$ 5501(c)'s direction to the Appellate Division cannot be giveneffect by federal appellate courts without violating the Sev-enth Amendment's Reexamination Clause.As the parties' arguments suggest, CPLR $ 5501(c), ap-praised underErie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938),and decisions in Erie's path, is both "substantive" and "procedural": "substantive" in that $ 5501(c)'s "deviates materi-ally" standard controls how much a plaintiff can be awarded;"procedural" in that $ 5501(c) assigns decisionmaking author-ity to New York's Appellate Division. Parallel applicationof $ 5501(c) at the federal appellate level would be out of syncwith the federal system's division of trial and appellate courtfunctions, an allocation weighted by the Seventh Amend-ment. The dispositive question, therefore, is whether federal courts can give effect to the substantive thrust of$ 5501(c) without untoward alteration of the federal schemefor the trial and decision of civil cases.AFederal diversity jurisdiction provides an alternativeforum for the adjudication of state-created rights, but it doesnot carry with it generation of rules of substantive law. As518us2$82P 05-18-99 18:37:58 PAGES OPINPGT427Cite as: 518 U. S. 415 (1996)Opinion of the CourtErie read the Rules of Decision Act: 6 "Except in mattersgoverned by the Federal Constitution or by Acts of Congress, the law to be applied in any case is the law of theState." 304 U. S., at 78. Under the Erie doctrine, federalcourts sitting in diversity apply state substantive law andfederal procedural law.Classification of a law as "substantive" or "procedural"forErie purposes is sometimes a challenging endeavor.7G uaranty Tr ust Co. v. York, 326 U.

C. $ 1652, reads: "The laws of the several states,except where the Constitution or treaties of the United States or Acts ofCongress otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in civil actions in the courts of the United States, in cases wherethey apply."7 Concerning matters covered by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,the characterization question is usually unproblematic: It is settled that ifthe Rule in point is consonant with the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S. C.$ 2072, and the Constitution, the Federal Rule applies regardless of contrary state law. See Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S. 460, 469-474 (1965); Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1, 4-5 (1987). Federal courtshave interpreted the Federal Rules, however, with sensitivity to important state interests and regulatory policies. See, e. g., Walker v. ArmcoSteel Corp., 446 U. S. 740, 750-752 (1980) (reaffirming decision in Ragan v.Merchants Transfer & Warehouse Co., 337 U.

CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.Opinion of the Courtanty Trust: "[W]here a federal court is exercising jurisdiction solely because of the diversity of citizenship of the parties, the outcome of the litigation in the federal court shouldbe substantially the same, so far as legal rules determine theoutcome of a litigation, as it would be if tried in a Statecourt." Ibid.; see also Ragan v. Merchants Transfer &Warehouse Co., 337 U. S. 530, 533 (1949) (when local law thatcreates the cause of action qualifies it, "federal court mustfollow suit," for "a different measure of the cause of actionin one court than in the other [would transgress] the principle of Erie"). A later pathmarking case, qualifying Guaranty Trust, explained that the "outcome-determination" testmust not be applied mechanically to sweep in all manner ofvariations; instead, its application must be guided by "thetwin aims of the Erie rule: discouragement of forumshopping and avoidance of inequitable administration of thelaws." Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S. 460, 468 (1965).Informed by these decisions, we address the questionwhether New York's "deviates materially" standard, codifiedin CPLR $ 5501(c), is outcome affective in this sense: Would"application of the [standard] . . . have so important an effectupon the fortunes of one or both of the litigants that failureto [apply] it would [unfairly discriminate against citizens ofthe forum State, or] be likely to cause a plaintiff to choosethe federal court"? Id., at 468, n. 9.8We start from a point the parties do not debate. Gasperini acknowledges that a statutory cap on damages would supply substantive law for Erie purposes. See Reply Brief for8 Hanna keyed the question to Erie's "twin aims"; in full, Hanna instructed federal courts to ask "whether application of the [State's] rulewould make so important a difference to the character or result of thelitigation that failure to enforce it would unfairly discriminate against citizens of the forum State, or whether application of the rule would have soimportant an effect upon the fortunes of one or both of the litigants thatfailure to enforce it would be likely to cause a plaintiff to choose the federalcourt." 380 U.

See supra, at 422-423.More rigorous comparative evaluations attend applicationof $ 5501(c)'s "deviates materially" standard. See supra, at423-425. To foster predictability, the legislature requiredthe reviewing court, when overturning a verdict under$ 5501(c), to state its reasons, including the factors it considered relevant. See CPLR $ 5522(b); supra, at 423-424. Wethink it a fair conclusion that CPLR $ 5501(c) differs froma statutory cap principally "in that the maximum amountrecoverable is not set forth by statute, but rather is determined by case law." Brief for City of New York as AmicusCuriae 11. In sum, $ 5501(c) contains a procedural instruction, see supra, at 426, but the State's objective is manifestlysubstantive. Cf. S. A. Healy Co. v.

Post, at 465-466 (collectingvarious formulations of review standard). If there is a federal districtcourt standard, it must come from the Court of Appeals, not from the over40 district court judges in the Southern District of New York, each ofwhom sits alone and renders decisions not binding on the others. Indeed,in Ismail v. Cohen, 899 F. 2d 183 (1990), the authority upon which JusticeScalia relies, the Second Circuit stated that district courts test damageawards for excessiveness under the "shock the conscience" standard. Seeid., at 186 ("A remittitur, in effect, is a statement by the court that it isshocked by the jury's award of damages."); see also Scala v.

(internal quotation marks and citationomitted).11 Justice Scalia questions whether application of CPLR $ 5501(c), inlieu of the standard generally used by federal courts within the SecondCircuit, see supra, at 422, will in fact yield consistent outcome differentials, see post, at 465, 466. The numbers, as the Second Circuit believed,are revealing. See 66 F. 3d 427, 430 (1995). Is the difference betweenan award of $450,000 and $100,000, see supra, at 421, or between $1,500per transparency and $500, see supra, at 421, n. 2, fairly described asinsubstantial? We do not see how that can be so.12 For rights that are state created, state law governs the amount properly awarded as punitive damages, subject to an ultimate federal constitutional check for exorbitancy. See BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore,517 U. S. 559, 568 (1996); Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. KelcoDisposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 278-279 (1989). An evenhanded approachwould require federal-court deference to endeavors like New York's tocontrol compensatory damages for excessiveness.

S., at 533-534, so Erie precludes a recovery in federalcourt significantly larger than the recovery that would havebeen tolerated in state court.BCPLR $ 5501(c), as earlier noted, see supra, at 425, 426, isphrased as a direction to the New York Appellate Division.Acting essentially as a surrogate for a New York appellateforum, the Court of Appeals reviewed Gasperini's award todetermine if it "deviate[d] materially" from damage awardsthe Appellate Division permitted in similar circumstances.The Court of Appeals performed this task without benefit ofan opinion from the District Court, which had denied "without comment" the Center's Rule 59 motion. 66 F. 3d, at 428.Concentrating on the authority $ 5501(c) gives to the Appellate Division, Gasperini urges that the provision shifts fact-finding responsibility from the jury and the trial judge to theappellate court. Assigning such responsibility to an appel-late court, he maintains, is incompatible with the SeventhAmendment's Reexamination Clause, and therefore, Gasper-ini concludes, $ 5501(c) cannot be given effect in federal court.Brief for Petitioner 19-20. Although we reach a differentconclusion than Gasperini, we agree that the Second Circuitdid not attend to "[a]n essential characteristic of [the federalcourt] system," Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Cooperative,Inc., 356 U. S. 525, 537 (1958), when it used $ 5501(c) as "thestandard for [federal] appellate review," Consorti, 72 F. 3d,at 1013; see also 66 F. 3d, at 430.That "essential characteristic" was described inByrd, adiversity suit for negligence in which a pivotal issue of factwould have been tried by a judge were the case in statecourt. The Byrd Court held that, despite the state practice,13 the plaintiff was entitled to a jury trial in federal court.13 The defendant argued in Byrd that although the personal injury plaintiff was employed by an independent contractor, the work plaintiff wasengaged to perform was the same as work done by defendant's own em518us2$82P 05-18-99 18:37:58 PAGES OPINPGT432 GASPERINI v. CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.Opinion of the CourtIn so ruling, the Court said that the Guaranty Trust"outcome-determination" test was an insufficient guide incases presenting countervailing federal interests. SeeByrd, 356 U. S., at 537. The Court described the countervailing federal interests present in Byrd this way:"The federal system is an independent system for administering justice to litigants who properly invoke itsjurisdiction. An essential characteristic of that systemis the manner in which, in civil common-law actions, itdistributes trial functions between judge and jury and,under the influence--if not the command--of the Seventh Amendment, assigns the decisions of disputedquestions of fact to the jury." Ibid. (footnote omitted).The Seventh Amendment, which governs proceedings infederal court, but not in state court,14 bears not only on theallocation of trial functions between judge and jury, the issuein Byrd; it also controls the allocation of authority to reviewverdicts, the issue of concern here. The Amendment reads:"In Suits at common law, where the value in controversyshall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by juryshall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall beotherwise re-examined in any Court of the UnitedStates, than according to the rules of the common law."U. S. Const., Amdt. 7.Byrd involved the first Clause of the Amendment, the"trial by jury" Clause. This case involves the second, the"re-examination" Clause. In keeping with the historic unployees. Therefore, defendant maintained, the plaintiff ranked as a "statutory employee" whose sole remedy was under the State's workers' compensation law. The sameness of the work plaintiff and defendant's ownemployees performed presented a fact question, but in state court, a jurytrial would not have been available to resolve it.14 See Walker v. Sauvinet, 92 U. S. 90, 92 (1876).518us2$82P 05-18-99 18:37:58 PAGES OPINPGT433Cite as: 518 U.

Fed.Rule Civ. Proc. 59(a). That authority is large. See 6AMoore's Federal Practice || 59.05[2], pp. 59-44 to 59-46 (2ded. 1996) ("The power of the English common law trial courtsto grant a new trial for a variety of reasons with a view tothe attainment of justice was well established prior to theestablishment of our Government."); see alsoAetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Yeatts, 122 F. 2d 350, 353 (CA4 1941)("The exercise of [the trial court's power to set aside thejury's verdict and grant a new trial] is not in derogation ofthe right of trial by jury but is one of the historic safeguards of that right."); Blunt v. Little, 3 F. Cas. 760, 761-762(No. 1,578) (CC Mass. 1822) (Story, J.) ("[I]f it should clearlyappear that the jury have committed a gross error, or haveacted from improper motives, or have given damages excessive in relation to the person or the injury, it is as much theduty of the court to interfere, to prevent the wrong, as inany other case."). "The trial judge in the federal system,"we have reaffirmed, "has . . . discretion to grant a new trialif the verdict appears to [the judge] to be against the weightof the evidence." Byrd, 356 U. S., at 540. This discretionincludes overturning verdicts for excessiveness and orderinga new trial without qualification, or conditioned on the ver-dict winner's refusal to agree to a reduction (remittitur).See Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U. S. 474, 486-487 (1935) (rec-ognizing that remittitur withstands Seventh Amendmentattack, but rejecting additur as unconstitutional).1615 See 6A Moore's Federal Practice || 59.05[1], pp. 59-38 to 59-40 (2d ed.1996) (common-law origin of trial court power to grant or deny a newtrial).16 Inviting rethinking of the additur question on a later day, JusticeStone, joined by Chief Justice Hughes and Justices Brandeis and Cardozo,found nothing in the history or language of the Seventh Amendment forc518us2$82P 05-18-99 18:37:58 PAGES OPINPGT434 GASPERINI v. CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.Opinion of the CourtIn contrast, appellate review of a federal trial court's de-nial of a motion to set aside a jury's verdict as excessive is arelatively late, and less secure, development. Such reviewwas once deemed inconsonant with the Seventh Amendment's Reexamination Clause. See, e. g., Lincoln v. Power,151 U. S. 436, 437-438 (1894);Williamson v. Osenton, 220 F.653, 655 (CA4 1915); see also 6A Moore's Federal Practice|| 59.08[6], at 59-167 (collecting cases). We subsequentlyrecognized that, even in cases in which the Erie doctrinewas not in play--cases arising wholly under federal law--the question was not settled; we twice granted certiorari todecide the unsettled issue, but ultimately resolved the caseson other grounds. SeeGrunenthal v. Long Island R. Co.,393 U. S. 156, 158 (1968); Neese v. Southern R. Co., 350 U. S.77 (1955).17Before today, we have not "expressly [held] that the Seventh Amendment allows appellate review of a district court'sdenial of a motion to set aside an award as excessive."Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal,Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 279, n. 25 (1989). But in successive reminders that the question was worthy of this Court's atten-tion, we noted, without disapproval, that courts of appealsengage in review of district court excessiveness determinaing the "incongruous position" that "a federal trial court may deny a motion for a new trial where the plaintiff consents to decrease the judgmentto a proper amount," but may not condition denial of the motion on "thedefendant's consent to a comparable increase in the recovery." Dimick v.Schiedt, 293 U. S., at 495.17 Dissenting from the Court's professed refusal to answer the questionpresented in Grunenthal v. Long Island R. Co., Justices Harlan and Stewart observed that in Grunenthal itself, this Court indeed had reviewedthe refusal of the District Court to set aside a jury verdict for excessiveness. 393 U. S., at 163 (Harlan, J., dissenting); id., at 164-165 (Stewart,J., dissenting). Justice Harlan commented: "Like my Brother Stewart,I am at an utter loss to understand how the Court manages to review theDistrict Court's decision and find it proper while at the same time proclaiming that it has avoided decision of the issue whether appellate courtsever may review such actions."

We noted the Circuit decisions in point, id., at 157, n. 3, and, in Browning-Ferris, weagain referred to appellate court abuse-of-discretion review:"[T]he role of the district court is to determine whetherthe jury's verdict is within the confines set by state law,and to determine, by reference to federal standards developed under Rule 59, whether a new trial or remittiturshould be ordered. The court of appeals should thenreview the district court's determination under anabuse-of-discretion standard." 492 U. S., at 279.18As the Second Circuit explained, appellate review forabuse of discretion is reconcilable with the Seventh Amendment as a control necessary and proper to the fair administration of justice: "We must give the benefit of every doubtto the judgment of the trial judge; but surely there must bean upper limit, and whether that has been surpassed is nota question of fact with respect to which reasonable men maydiffer, but a question of law." Dagnello v. Long Island R.Co., 289 F. 2d 797, 806 (CA2 1961) (quoted in Grunenthal, 393U. S., at 159). All other Circuits agree. See, e. g., Holmesv. Elgin, Joliet & Eastern R.

Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 2820, p. 209 (2d ed. 1995) ("[E]very circuit has said that there are circumstances in which it canreverse the denial of a new trial if the size of the verdictseems to be too far out of line."); 6A Moore's Federal Practice18 Browning-Ferris concerned punitive damages. We agree with theSecond Circuit, however, that "[f]or purposes of deciding whether state orfederal law is applicable, the question whether an award of compensatorydamages exceeds what is permitted by law is not materially different fromthe question whether an award of punitive damages exceeds what is permitted by law."

S., at 164 (Stewart, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks and footnoteomitted).20CIn Byrd, the Court faced a one-or-the-other choice: trialby judge as in state court, or trial by jury according to thefederal practice.21 In the case before us, a choice of that19 Justice Scalia disagrees. Ready to "destroy the uniformity of federal practice" in this regard, cf. post, at 467, he would render a judgmentdescribed as "astonishing" by the very authority upon which he relies.Compare post, at 460, with 11 C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, FederalPractice and Procedure $ 2820, p. 212 (2d ed. 1995) ("it would be astonishing if the Court, which has passed up three opportunities to do so, shouldultimately reject" the unanimously held view of the courts of appeals).20 If the meaning of the Seventh Amendment were fixed at 1791, ourcivil juries would remain, as they unquestionably were at common law,"twelve good men and true," 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *349; seeCapital Traction Co. v. Hof, 174 U. S. 1, 13 (1899) (" `Trial by jury,' in theprimary and usual sense of the term at the common law and in the American constitutions . . . is a trial by a jury of twelve men."). But see Colgrove v. Battin, 413 U. S. 149, 160 (1973) (six-member jury for civil trialssatisfies Seventh Amendment's guarantee). Procedures we have regarded as compatible with the Seventh Amendment, although not in conformity with practice at common law when the Amendment was adopted,include new trials restricted to the determination of damages, GasolineProducts Co. v. Champlin Refining Co., 283 U. S. 494 (1931), and FederalRule of Civil Procedure 50(b)'s motion for judgment as a matter of law,see 9A C. Wright & A.

S. 415 (1996)Opinion of the Courtorder is not required, for the principal state and federal in-terests can be accommodated. The Second Circuit correctlyrecognized that when New York substantive law governs aclaim for relief, New York law and decisions guide the allowable damages. See 66 F. 3d, at 430; see also Consorti, 72 F.3d, at 1011. But that court did not take into account thecharacteristic of the federal court system that caused us toreaffirm: "The proper role of the trial and appellate courtsin the federal system in reviewing the size of jury verdictsis . . . a matter of federal law."Donovan v. Penn ShippingCo., 429 U. S. 648, 649 (1977) (per curiam); see alsoBrowning-Ferris, 492 U. S., at 279 ("[T]he role of the districtcourt is to determine whether the jury's verdict is within theconfines set by state law . . . . The court of appeals shouldthen review the district court's determination under anabuse-of-discretion standard.").New York's dominant interest can be respected, withoutdisrupting the federal system, once it is recognized that thefederal district court is capable of performing the checkingfunction, i. e., that court can apply the State's "deviates ma-terially" standard in line with New York case law evolvingunder CPLR $ 5501(c).22 We recall, in this regard, that theElec. Cooperative, Inc., 356 U. S. 525, 537 (1958). We discern no disagreement on such examples among the many federal judges who have considered this case.22 Justice Scalia finds in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59 a "federalstandard" for new trial motions in " `direct collision' " with, and " `leavingno room for the operation of,' " a state law like CPLR $ 5501(c). Post, at468 (quoting Burlington Northern R. Co., 480 U. S., at 4-5). The relevantprescription, Rule 59(a), has remained unchanged since the adoption of theFederal Rules by this Court in 1937. 302 U. S. 783. Rule 59(a) is asencompassing as it is uncontroversial. It is indeed "Hornbook" law thata most usual ground for a Rule 59 motion is that "the damages are excessive." See C. Wright, Law of Federal Courts 676-677 (5th ed. 1994).Whether damages are excessive for the claim-in-suit must be governed bysome law. And there is no candidate for that governance other than thelaw that gives rise to the claim for relief--here, the law of New York.See 28 U. S. C. $$ 2072(a) and (b) ("Supreme Court shall have the power toprescribe general rules of . . . procedure"; "[s]uch rules shall not abridge,518us2$82P 05-18-99 18:37:58 PAGES OPINPGT438 GASPERINI v. CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.Opinion of the Court"deviates materially" standard serves as the guide to beapplied in trial as well as appellate courts in New York.See supra, at 425.Within the federal system, practical reasons combine withSeventh Amendment constraints to lodge in the districtcourt, not the court of appeals, primary responsibility forapplication of $ 5501(c)'s "deviates materially" check. Trialjudges have the "unique opportunity to consider the evidencein the living courtroom context," Taylor v. Washington Terminal Co., 409 F. 2d 145, 148 (CADC 1969), while appellatejudges see only the "cold paper record," 66 F. 3d, at 431.District court applications of the "deviates materially"standard would be subject to appellate review under thestandard the Circuits now employ when inadequacy or excessiveness is asserted on appeal: abuse of discretion. See 11Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 2820, at212-214, and n. 24 (collecting cases); see 6A Moore's FederalPractice || 59.08[6], at 59-177 to 59-185 (same). In light ofErie's doctrine, the federal appeals court must be guided bythe damage-control standard state law supplies,23 but as theSecond Circuit itself has said: "If we reverse, it must be because of an abuse of discretion. . . . The very nature of theproblem counsels restraint. . . . We must give the benefit ofenlarge or modify any substantive right"); Browning-Ferris, 492 U. S., at279 ("standard of excessiveness" is a "matte[r] of state, and not federal,common law"); see also R. Fallon, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart andWechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System 729-730 (4th ed.1996) (observing that Court "has continued since [Hanna v. Plumer, 380U. S. 460 (1965),] to interpret the federal rules to avoid conflict with important state regulatory policies," citing Walker v. Armco Steel Corp., 446U. S. 740 (1980)).23 If liability and damage-control rules are split apart here, as JusticeScalia says they must be to save the Seventh Amendment, then Gasperini's claim and others like it would be governed by a most curious "law."The sphinx-like, damage-determining law he would apply to this controversy has a state forepart, but a federal hindquarter. The beast may notbe brutish, but there is little judgment in its creation.518us2$82P 05-18-99 18:37:58 PAGES OPINPGT439Cite as: 518 U.

Dagnello,289 F. 2d, at 806.IVIt does not appear that the District Court checked thejury's verdict against the relevant New York decisions demanding more than "industry standard" testimony to sup-port an award of the size the jury returned in this case. Asthe Court of Appeals recognized, see 66 F. 3d, at 429, theuniqueness of the photographs and the plaintiff 's earningsas photographer--past and reasonably projected--are fac-tors relevant to appraisal of the award. See, e. g., Blackmanv. Michael Friedman Publishing Group, Inc., 201 App. Div.2d 328, 607 N. Y. S. 2d 43, 44 (1st Dept. 1994); Nierenberg v.Wursteria, Inc., 189 App. Div. 2d 571, 571-572, 592 N. Y. S.2d 27, 27-28 (1st Dept. 1993). Accordingly, we vacate thejudgment of the Court of Appeals and instruct that court toremand the case to the District Court so that the trial judge,revisiting his ruling on the new trial motion, may test thejury's verdict against CPLR $ 5501(c)'s "deviates materially" standard.
