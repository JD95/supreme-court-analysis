Because Reed failed tomake the requisite showing of prejudice, he cannot tenably maintainthat his Sixth Amendment speedy trial right was violated. See Barkerv. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514, 530.

S. 424, 428. Reed urges that the Hill standard appliesonly to federal prisoners under $ 2255, not to state prisoners under$ 2254. This Court's decisions have recognized, however, that, at leastwhere only statutory violations are at issue, $$ 2254 and 2255 mirroreach other in operative effect, see Davis v. United States, 417 U. S. 333,344; Hill controls collateral review--under both $$ 2254 and 2255--whena federal statute, but not the Constitution, is the basis for the postconviction attack. See, e. g., Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 477, n. 10. Thereis no reason to afford habeas review to a state prisoner like Reed, wholet a time clock run without alerting the trial court, yet deny collateralreview to a federal prisoner similarly situated. Pp. 341-346, 353-355.Justice Ginsburg, joined by The Chief Justice and JusticeO'Connor, concluded in Part II and the final paragraph of Part IV thathabeas review is not available to check the trial court's failure to complywith Article IV(c). That failure does not qualify as a "fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice, [o]r anomission inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure."Hill, 368 U. S., at 428. When a defendant obscures Article IV(c)'s timeprescription and avoids clear objection until the clock has run, an unwitting judicial slip of the kind involved here ranks with similar nonconstitutional lapses that are not cognizable in a postconviction proceeding.See, e. g., id., at 429. Because Reed did not alert the trial judge to the120-day period until four days after the period expired, the Court hasno cause to consider whether an omission of the kind contemplated inHill would occur if a state court, presented with a timely request to seta trial date within the IAD's 120-day period, nonetheless refused tocomply with Article IV(c). The reservation of that question, togetherwith the IAD's status as both federal law and the law of Indiana, mutesReed's concern that state courts might be hostile to the federal law hereat stake. Pp. 347-352, 355.Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, agreed that the "fundamental defect" test of Hill v. United States, 368 U. S. 424, 428, is theappropriate standard for evaluating alleged statutory violations underboth $$ 2254 and 2255, but concluded that the standard's application isbroader than the principal opinion suggests. The class of nonconstitutional procedural rights that are inherently necessary to avoid "a complete miscarriage of justice," or numbered among "the rudimentary demands of fair procedure," is no doubt a small one, if it is not a null set.If there was ever a technical rule, it is the 120-day limit set forth inArticle IV(c) of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers. Declining tostate the obvious produces confusion: Violation of that technicality,whether intentional or unintentional, is no basis for federal habeasrelief.

FARLEYOpinion of the Courthaving jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary orreasonable continuance." IAD Article V(c) states that whentrial does not occur within the time prescribed, the chargesshall be dismissed with prejudice.The petitioner in this case, Orrin Scott Reed, was trans-ferred in April 1983 from a federal prison in Indiana to statecustody pursuant to an IAD request made by Indiana offi-cials. Reed was tried in October of that year, followingpostponements made and explained in his presence in opencourt. Reed's petition raises the question whether a stateprisoner, asserting a violation of IAD Article IV(c)'s 120-daylimitation, may enforce that speedy trial prescription in afederal habeas corpus action under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254.We hold that a state court's failure to observe the 120-dayrule of IAD Article IV(c) is not cognizable under $ 2254 whenthe defendant registered no objection to the trial date at thetime it was set, and suffered no prejudice attributable to thedelayed commencement. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.IIn December 1982, while petitioner Reed was servingtime in a Terre Haute, Indiana, federal prison, the State ofIndiana charged him with theft and habitual offender status.Indiana authorities lodged a detainer1 against Reed and, onApril 27, 1983, took custody of him. The 120-day rule ofIAD Article IV(c) thus instructed that, absent any continuance, Reed's trial was to commence on or before August25, 1983.At two pretrial conferences, one on June 27, the other onAugust 1, the trial judge discussed with Reed (who chose torepresent himself) and the prosecutor the number of daysneeded for the trial and the opening date. At the June 271 A detainer is "a request filed by a criminal justice agency with theinstitution in which a prisoner is incarcerated, asking . . . either to holdthe prisoner for the agency or to notify the agency when release of theprisoner is imminent."

S. 339 (1994)Opinion of the Courtconference, the court set a July 18 deadline for submissionof the many threshold motions Reed said he wished to file,and September 13 as the trial date. That trial date ex-ceeded IAD Article IV(c)'s 120-day limit, but neither theprosecutor nor Reed called the IAD limit to the attention ofthe judge, and neither asked for a different trial date. Reeddid indicate a preference for trial at a time when he wouldbe out of jail on bond (or on his own recognizance); he informed the court that he would be released from federalcustody two weeks before September 13, unless federalauthorities revoked his "good days" credits, in which casehe would be paroled on September 14. App. 39; seeid.,at 76.At the August 1 pretrial conference, Reed noted his immi-nent release from federal custody and asked the court to setbond. Id., at 76-79. In response, the court set bond at$25,000. Also, because of a calendar conflict, the court resetthe trial date to September 19. Id., at 79-81.2 Reed in-quired about witness subpoenas and requested books on procedure, but again, he said nothing at the conference to alertthe judge to Article IV(c)'s 120-day limit, nor did he expressany other objection to the September 19 trial date.Interspersed in Reed's many written and oral pretrial motions are references to IAD provisions other than ArticleIV(c). Seeid., at 28-31, 44 (alleging illegality of transferfrom federal to state custody without a pretransfer hearing);id., at 46 (asserting failure to provide hygienic care in viola-tion of IAD Article V). Reed did refer to the IAD prescription on trial commencement in three of the written motionshe filed during the 120-day period; indeed, one of these motions was filed on the very day of the August 1 pretrial con-ference.3 In none of the three motions, however, did Reed2 Reed posted bond by corporate surety on September 28 and was thereupon released from pretrial incarceration.

In contrast, on August 29, four days after the120-day period expired, Reed presented a clear statementand citation. In a "Petition for Discharge," he alleged thatIndiana had failed to try him within 120 days of his transferto state custody, and therefore had violated Article IV(c);4consequently, he urged, the IAD mandated his immediaterelease.5 The trial judge denied the petition, explaining:"Today is the first day I was aware that there was a120 day limitation on the Detainer Act. The Courtmade its setting and while there has been a request formoving the trial forward, there has not been any speedytrial request filed, nor has there been anything in thenature of an objection to the trial setting, but only anurging that it be done within the guidelines that havebeen set out."Id., at 113-114.The morning trial was to commence, September 19, Reedfiled a motion for continuance, saying he needed additionaltime for trial preparation.

Specifically, Reed wrote: "That petitioner is being detainedcontrary to Indiana law and procedure: 35-33-10-4, Article 4(c) . . . trialshall be commenced within one hundred twenty (120) days of arrival ofthe prisoner in the receiving state . . . ."5 The prosecutor, in response, pointed out that Article IV(c) permits"any necessary or reasonable continuance," and that Reed had not objected at the time the trial court set the date. Id., at 113. He also expressed confusion about the effect of the 120-day rule and its relationshipto the 180-day time limit prescribed by a different IAD provision. Id., at114; see n. 6, infra.512us2$80P 12-24-97 11:11:50 PAGES OPINPGT345Cite as: 512 U. S. 339 (1994)Opinion of the Courtcalled for jury duty and the 1954 to 1980 time frame of Reed'salleged prior felony convictions. Concerned that the articlemight jeopardize the fairness of the trial, the judge offeredReed three options: (1) start the trial on schedule; (2) postpone it for one week; or (3) continue it to a late October date.Reed chose the third option, id., at 134, 142, and the trialbegan on October 18; the jury convicted Reed of theft, andfound him a habitual offender. He received a sentence of 4years in prison on the theft conviction, and 30 years on thehabitual offender conviction, the terms to run consecutively.The Indiana Supreme Court affirmed the convictions.Reed v. State, 491 N. E. 2d 182 (1986). Concerning Reed'sobjection that the trial commenced after the 120-day periodspecified in IAD Article IV(c), the Indiana Supreme Courtstressed the timing of Reed's pleas in court: Reed had vigorously urged at the August 1 pretrial conference other allegedIAD violations (particularly, his asserted right to a hearingin advance of the federal transfer to state custody), but hedid not then object to the trial date. Id., at 184-185; seeApp. 67-74. "The relevant times when [Reed] should haveobjected were on June 27, 1983, the date the trial was set,and August 1, 1983, the date the trial was reset," the IndianaSupreme Court concluded. 491 N. E. 2d, at 185.Reed unsuccessfully sought postconviction relief in the Indiana courts, and then petitioned under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 fora federal writ of habeas corpus. The District Court deniedthe petition. Examining the record, that court concludedthat "a significant amount of the delay of trial is attributableto the many motions filed . . . by [Reed] or filed on [Reed's]behalf "; delay chargeable to Reed, the court held, wasexcludable from the 120-day period. Reed v. Clark, Civ.No. S 90-226 (ND Ind., Sept. 21, 1990), App. 195-196.The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed.Reed v. Clark, 984 F. 2d 209 (1993). Preliminarily, the Courtof Appeals recognized that the IAD, although state law, isalso a "law of the United States" within the meaning of512us2$80P 12-24-97 11:11:50 PAGES OPINPGT346 REED v. FARLEYOpinion of the Court$ 2254(a). Id., at 210. Nonetheless, that court held collat-eral relief unavailable because Reed's IAD speedy trial arguments and remedial contentions had been considered andrejected by the Indiana courts. Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S.465 (1976), the Court of Appeals concluded, "establishesthe proper framework for evaluating claims under the IAD."984 F. 2d, at 213. InStone, this Court held that the exclusionary rule, devised to promote police respect for theFourth Amendment rights of suspects, should not be appliedon collateral review unless the state court failed to considerthe defendant's arguments. We granted certiorari, 510 U. S.963 (1993), to resolve a conflict among the Courts of Appealson the availability of habeas review of IAD speedy trialclaims.66 The IAD's other speedy trial provision, Article III(a), requires that aprisoner against whom a detainer has been lodged be tried within 180days of the prosecuting State's receipt of the prisoner's notice requestingspeedy disposition of the charges. Fex v. Michigan, 507 U. S. 43 (1993).The Seventh Circuit's rationale is one of several approaches taken byCourts of Appeals addressing the availability of habeas review for violations of Articles IV(c) and III(a). Some courts have denied relief withoutregard to whether the petitioner alerted the trial court to the IAD'sspeedy trial provisions. In this category, some decisions state that IADspeedy trial claims are never cognizable under $ 2254, because IAD speedytrial violations do not constitute a "fundamental defect which inherentlyresults in a complete miscarriage of justice," under Hill v. United States,368 U. S. 424, 428 (1962). See, e. g., Reilly v. Warden, FCI Petersburg,947 F. 2d 43, 44-45 (CA2 1991) (per curiam); Fasano v. Hall, 615 F. 2d555, 558-559 (CA1 1980). Other courts applying the Hill standard havesaid $ 2254 is not available for failure to meet IAD speedy trial specifications unless the petitioner shows actual prejudice. See, e. g., Seymore v.Alabama, 846 F. 2d 1355, 1359-1360 (CA11 1988); Kerr v. Finkbeiner, 757F. 2d 604, 607 (CA4 1985). Still other courts have reached the merits ofIAD speedy trial contentions raised in habeas actions under $ 2254. See,e. g., Birdwell v. Skeen, 983 F. 2d 1332 (CA5 1993) (affirming DistrictCourt's grant of the writ, where state court failed to comply with IADArticle III(a) in spite of petitioner's repeated request for compliance withthe 180-day rule); Cody v.

S. C. $ 2254(a) (emphasis added). Respondent Indiana ini-tially argues that the IAD is a voluntary interstate agreement, not a "la[w] . . . of the United States" within the mean-ing of $ 2254(a). Our precedent, however, has settled thatissue: While the IAD is indeed state law, it is a law of theUnited States as well. SeeCarchman v. Nash, 473 U. S.716, 719 (1985) ($ 2254 case, holding that the IAD "is acongressionally sanctioned interstate compact within theCompact Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 10, cl. 3, and thusis a federal law subject to federal construction"); Cuyler v.Adams, 449 U. S. 433, 438-442 (1981) ("congressional consenttransforms an interstate compact . . . into a law of theUnited States").The Court of Appeals recognized that the IAD is both alaw of Indiana and a federal statute. 984 F. 2d, at 210.Adopting Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465 (1976), as its framework, however, that court held relief under $ 2254 unavailable to Reed. 984 F. 2d, at 213. Stone holds that a federalcourt may not, under $ 2254, consider a claim that evidencefrom an unconstitutional search was introduced at a stateprisoner's trial if the prisoner had "an opportunity for fulland fair litigation of [the] claim in the state courts." 428U. S., at 469. Our opinion in Stone concentrated on "thenature and purpose of the Fourth Amendment exclusionaryrule." Id., at 481.

Williams, 507 U.

S. 436 (1966)).7 Because precedent alreadyin place suffices to resolve Reed's case, we do not adopt theSeventh Circuit's Stone-based rationale.We have stated that habeas review is available to checkviolations of federal laws when the error qualifies as "a fun-damental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice [or] an omission inconsistent with the rudi-mentary demands of fair procedure." Hill v. United States,368 U. S. 424, 428 (1962); accord, United States v. Timmreck,441 U. S. 780, 783 (1979);Davis v. United States, 417 U. S.333, 346 (1974). The IAD's purpose--providing a nationallyuniform means of transferring prisoners between jurisdic-tions--can be effectuated only by nationally uniform interpretation. See 984 F. 2d, at 214 (Ripple, J., dissenting fromdenial of rehearing in banc). Therefore, the argument that7 See also Kimmelman v. Morrison, 477 U.

Powell, 428 U. S., at526 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (institutional constraints preclude Supreme Court from overseeing adequately whetherstate courts have properly applied federal law). This case,however, gives us no cause to consider whether we wouldconfront an omission of the kind contemplated in Hill,Timmreck, or Davis, if a state court, presented with a timelyrequest to set a trial date within the IAD's 120-day period,nonetheless refused to comply with Article IV(c).When a defendant obscures Article IV(c)'s time prescription and avoids clear objection until the clock has run, causefor collateral review scarcely exists. An unwitting judicialslip of the kind involved here ranks with the nonconstitutional lapses we have held not cognizable in a postconvictionproceeding. In Hill, for example, a federal prisoner soughtcollateral relief, under 28 U. S. C. $ 2255,8 based on the trialcourt's failure at sentencing to afford him an opportunity tomake a statement and present information in mitigation ofpunishment, as required by Rule 32(a) of the Federal Rulesof Criminal Procedure. The petitioner, however, had notsought to assert his Rule 32(a) rights at the time of sentencing, a point we stressed:"[W]e are not dealing here with a case where the defendant was affirmatively denied an opportunity tospeak during the hearing at which his sentence wasimposed. Nor is it suggested that in imposing thesentence the District Judge was either misinformed oruninformed as to any relevant circumstances. Indeed,there is no claim that the defendant would have hadanything at all to say if he had been formally invitedto speak." 368 U. S., at 429.8 The text of $ 2255, in relevant part, is set out at n. 12, infra.512us2$80P 12-24-97 11:11:50 PAGES OPINPGT350 REED v.

But we left open the questionwhether "[collateral] relief would be available if a violationof Rule 32(a) occurred in the context of other aggravatingcircumstances." Ibid.Hill controlled our decision in United States v. Timmreck,441 U. S. 780 (1979), where a federal prisoner sought collateral review, under $ 2255, to set aside a conviction based ona guilty plea. The complainant in Timmreck alleged thatthe judge who accepted his plea failed to inform him, in violation of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,that he faced a mandatory postincarceration special paroleterm. We rejected the collateral attack, observing that theviolation of Rule 11 was technical, and did not "resul[t] ina `complete miscarriage of justice' or in a proceeding `inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.' "Id., at 784, quoting Hill, 368 U. S., at 428. "As in Hill," wefound it unnecessary to consider whether "[postconviction]relief would be available if a violation of Rule 11 occurred inthe context of other aggravating circumstances." 441 U. S.,at 784-785.Reed's case similarly lacks "aggravating circumstances"rendering " `the need for the remedy afforded by the writ ofhabeas corpus . . . apparent.' " Hill, 368 U. S., at 428, quoting Bowen v. Johnston, 306 U. S. 19, 27 (1939). Reed hadtwo clear chances to alert the trial judge in open court if heindeed wanted his trial to start on or before August 25, 1993.He let both opportunities pass by. At the pretrial hearingsat which the trial date was set and rescheduled, on June 27and August 1, Reed not only failed to mention the 120-daylimit; he indicated a preference for holding the trial after hisrelease from federal imprisonment, which was due to occurafter the 120 days expired. See supra, at 342. Then, onthe 124th day, when it was no longer possible to meet Article512us2$80P 12-24-97 11:11:50 PAGES OPINPGT351Cite as: 512 U. S. 339 (1994)Opinion of Ginsburg, J.IV(c)'s deadline, Reed produced his meticulously precise"Petition for Discharge." See supra, at 344, and n. 4.9As the Court of Appeals observed, had Reed objected tothe trial date on June 27 or August 1 "instead of burying hisdemand in a flood of other documents, the [trial] court couldhave complied with the IAD's requirements." 984 F. 2d, at209-210. The Court of Appeals further elaborated:"During the pretrial conference of August 1, 1983, Reedpresented several arguments based on the IAD, including claims that the federal government should have helda hearing before turning him over to the state and thathis treatment in Indiana fell short of the state's obliga-tions under Art. V(d) and (h). Reed did not mentionthe fact that the date set for trial would fall outside the120 days allowed by Art. IV(c). Courts often requirelitigants to flag important issues orally rather than buryvital (and easily addressed) problems in reams of paper,as Reed did. E. g., Fed. R. Crim. P. 30 (requiring a distinct objection to jury instructions); cf. Fed. R. Crim. P.12(b) (a district judge may require motions to be madeorally). It would not have been difficult for the judgeto advance the date of the trial or make a finding onthe record of good cause, either of which would havesatisfied Art. IV(c). Because the subject never cameup, however, the trial judge overlooked the problem."Id., at 213.Reed regards the Court of Appeals' description of his liti-gation conduct, even if true, as irrelevant. He maintains9 In contrast, the defendant in United States v. Ford, 550 F. 2d 732 (CA21977), aff'd sub nom. United States v. Mauro, 436 U.

Referring to those guides, and particularlytheHill and Timmreck decisions, we conclude that a statecourt's failure to observe the 120-day rule of IAD ArticleIV(c) is not cognizable under $ 2254 when the defendantregistered no objection to the trial date at the time it wasset, and suffered no prejudice attributable to the delayedcommencement.IIIReed argues that he is entitled to habeas relief becausethe IAD's speedy trial provision "effectuates a constitutionalright," the Sixth Amendment guarantee of a speedy trial.Brief for Petitioner 26. Accordingly, he maintains, the alleged IAD violation should be treated as a constitutional vio-lation or as a "fundamental defect" satisfying the Hill standard, not as a mere technical error. Reed's argument isinsubstantial for, as he concedes, his constitutional right to aspeedy trial was in no way violated. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 7.10 Article V(c) provides in relevant part:"[I]n the event that an action on the indictment, information, or complainton the basis of which the detainer has been lodged is not brought to trialwithin the period provided in article III or article IV hereof, the appropriate court of the jurisdiction where the indictment, information, or complaint has been pending shall enter an order dismissing the same withprejudice, and any detainer based thereon shall cease to be of any forceor effect."512us2$80P 12-24-97 11:11:50 PAGES OPINPGT353Cite as: 512 U.

Nor could he plausiblymake such a claim.11 Indeed, asserting a need for more timeto prepare for a trial that would be "fair and meaningful,"App. 128, Reed himselfrequested a delay beyond the scheduled September 19 opening. A showing of prejudice is required to establish a violation of the Sixth AmendmentSpeedy Trial Clause, and that necessary ingredient is entirely missing here. See Barker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514, 530(1972) (four factors figure in the determination of SixthAmendment speedy trial claims; one of the four is "prejudiceto the defendant").IVMore strenuously, Reed argues that Hill and similar decisions establish a standard for federal prisoners seeking reliefunder 28 U. S. C. $ 2255,12 not for state prisoners seeking relief under $ 2254. But it is scarcely doubted that, at leastwhere mere statutory violations are at issue, "$ 2255 wasintended to mirror $ 2254 in operative effect." Davis v.United States, 417 U. S. 333, 344 (1974). Far from suggesting that the Hill standard is inapplicable to $ 2254 cases, ourdecisions assume that Hill controls collateral review--underboth $$ 2254 and 2255--when a federal statute, but not the11 As the Court of Appeals noted:"Had Indiana put Reed to trial within 120 days of his transfer from federalprison, everything would have proceeded as it did.

Large, 332 U. S. 174, 178 (1947) (emphasis added).The same "general rule," however, applies to $ 2254. Wherethe petitioner--whether a state or federal prisoner--failedproperly to raise his claim on direct review, the writ is available only if the petitioner establishes "cause" for the waiverand shows "actual prejudice resulting from the alleged . . .violation." Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.

But concern that state courts mightbe hostile to the federal law here at stake is muted by twoconsiderations. First, we have reserved the questionwhether federal habeas review is available to check violations of the IAD's speedy trial prescriptions when the statecourt disregards timely pleas for their application. Seesupra, at 349. Second, the IAD is both federal law and thelaw of Indiana. Ind. Code $ 35-33-10-4 (1993).
