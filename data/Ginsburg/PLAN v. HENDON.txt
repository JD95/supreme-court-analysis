This case presents a question on which federal courts havedivided: Does the working owner of a business (here, thesole shareholder and president of a professional corporation)qualify as a "participant" in a pension plan covered by theEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISAor Act), 88 Stat. 832, as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 1001 et seq.The answer, we hold, is yes: If the plan covers one or moreemployees other than the business owner and his or herspouse, the working owner may participate on equal termswith other plan participants. Such a working owner, incommon with other employees, qualifies for the protectionsERISA affords plan participants and is governed by therights and remedies ERISA specifies. In so ruling, we reject the position, taken by the lower courts in this case, thata business owner may rank only as an "employer" and notalso as an "employee" for purposes of ERISA-shelteredplan participation.IAEnacted "to protect . . . the interests of participants inemployee benefit plans and their beneficiaries," 29 U. S. C.$ 1001(b), ERISA comprises four titles. Title I, 29 U. S.

"Employee," under Title I's definition section, means "any indi-vidual employed by an employer," $ 1002(6), and "employer"includes "any person acting directly as an employer, or in-directly in the interest of an employer, in relation to anemployee benefit plan," $ 1002(5).BDr. Raymond B.

S. 318, 323 (1992) ("ERISA's nominal defini-tion of `employee' as `any individual employed by an employer' is completely circular and explains nothing." (citationomitted)). We therefore look to other provisions of the Actfor instruction. See ibid. ERISA's text contains multipleindications that Congress intended working owners to qualify as plan participants. Because these indications combineto provide "specific guidance," ibid., there is no cause in thiscase to resort to common law.3Congress enacted ERISA against a backdrop of IRC provisions that permitted corporate shareholders, partners, andsole proprietors to participate in tax-qualified pension plans.Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19-20.

Two decades later, still prior to ERISA'sadoption, Congress permitted partners and sole proprietorsto establish tax-favored pension plans, commonly known as"H. R. 10" or "Keogh" plans. Self-Employed IndividualsTax Retirement Act of 1962, 76 Stat. 809; Brief for UnitedStates as Amicus Curiae 19. Thus, by 1962, working owners of all kinds could contribute to tax-qualified retirementplans.ERISA's enactment in 1974 did not change that situation.4Rather, Congress' objective was to harmonize ERISA withlongstanding tax provisions. Title I of ERISA and relatedIRC provisions expressly contemplate the participation ofworking owners in covered benefit plans. Id., at 14-16.Most notably, several Title I provisions partially exempt certain plans in which working owners likely participate fromotherwise mandatory ERISA provisions. Exemptions ofthis order would be unnecessary if working owners couldnot qualify as participants in ERISA-protected plans in thefirst place.To illustrate, Title I frees the following plans from theAct's fiduciary responsibility requirements:"(1) a plan which is unfunded and is maintained by anemployer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of managementor highly compensated employees; or"(2) any agreement described in section 736 of [theIRC], which provides payments to a retired partner ordeceased partner or a deceased partner's successor ininterest." 29 U. S. C. $ 1101(a).The IRC defines the term "highly compensated employee"to include "any employee who . . . was a 5-percent owner atany time during the year or the preceding year." 26 U. S. C.4 A particular employee benefit plan may be covered by one title ofERISA, but not by another. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 18, n. 9.541US1 Unit: $U27 [05-20-06 18:15:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN14 RAYMOND B. YATES, M. D., P. C. PROFIT SHARINGPLAN v. HENDONOpinion of the Court$ 414(q)(1)(A). A "5-percent owner," the IRC further speci-fies, is "any person who owns . . . more than 5 percent of theoutstanding stock of the corporation or stock possessingmore than 5 percent of the total combined voting power ofall stock of the corporation" if the employer is a corporation,or "any person who owns more than 5 percent of the capitalor profits interest in the employer" if the employer is nota corporation. $ 416(i)(1)(B)(i). Under these definitions,some working owners would fit the description "highly compensated employees." Similarly, agreements that makepayments to retired partners, or to deceased partners' successors in interest, surely involve plans in which workingpartners participate.Title I also contains more limited exemptions fromERISA's fiduciary responsibility requirements. These exemptions, too, cover plans that ordinarily include workingowners as participants. To illustrate, assets of an employeebenefit plan typically must be held in trust. See 29 U. S. C.$ 1103(a). That requirement, however, does not apply, interalia, "to a plan . . . some or all of the participants of whichare employees described in section 401(c)(1) of [the IRC]."$ 1103(b)(3)(A). IRC $ 401(c)(1)(A) defines an "employee" toinclude "a self-employed individual"; and IRC $$ 401(c)(1)(B)and (2)(A)(i), in turn, define "a self-employed individual" tocover an individual with "earned income" from "a trade orbusiness in which personal services of the taxpayer are amaterial income-producing factor." This definition no doubtencompasses working sole proprietors and partners. 26U. S. C. $$ 1402(a) and (c).Title I also contains exemptions from ERISA's prohibitedtransaction provisions. Like the fiduciary responsibility exemptions, these exemptions indicate that working ownersmay participate in ERISA-qualified plans. For example, although Title I generally bars transactions between a planand a party in interest, 29 U. S. C. $ 1106, the Act permits,among other exceptions, loans to plan participants if certain541US1 Unit: $U27 [05-20-06 18:15:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN15Cite as: 541 U. S. 1 (2004)Opinion of the Courtconditions are satisfied, $ 1108(b)(1). One condition is thatloans must not be "made available to highly compensatedemployees . . . in an amount greater than the amount madeavailable to other employees." $ 1108(b)(1)(B). As just observed, see supra, at 13-14, some working owners, includingshareholder-employees, qualify as "highly compensated employees." Title I goes on to exclude "owner-employees," asdefined in the IRC, from the participant loan exemption.$ 1108(d)(1). Under the IRC's definition, owner-employeesinclude partners "who ow[n] more than 10 percent of eitherthe capital interest or the profits interest in [a] partnership"and sole proprietors, but not shareholder-employees. 26U. S. C. $ 401(c)(3). In sum, Title I's provisions involvingloans to plan participants, by explicit inclusion or exclusion,assume that working owners--shareholder-employees, partners, and sole proprietors--may participate in ERISAqualified benefit plans.Provisions of Title IV of ERISA are corroborative. Brieffor United States as Amicus Curiae 17, and n. 8. Title IVdoes not apply to plans "established and maintained exclusively for substantial owners," 29 U. S. C. $ 1321(b)(9)(emphasis added), a category that includes sole proprietors and shareholders and partners with a ten percent orgreater ownership interest, $ 1322(b)(5)(A). But Title IVdoes cover plans in which substantial owners participatealong with other employees. See $ 1322(b)(5)(B). In addition, Title IV does not cover plans established by "professional service employer[s]" with 25 or fewer active participants. $ 1321(b)(13). Yates's medical practice was set up asa professional service employer. See $ 1321(c)(2)(A) (a "professional service employer" is "any proprietorship, partnership, corporation . . . owned or controlled by professionalindividuals . . . the principal business of which is the performance of professional services").

HENDONOpinion of the Courtby a professional service employer would presumably qualifyfor protection.Particularly instructive, Title IV and the IRC, as amendedby Title II, clarify a key point missed by several lowercourts: Under ERISA, a working owner may have dual sta-tus, i. e., he can be an employee entitled to participate in aplan and, at the same time, the employer (or owner ormember of the employer) who established the plan. BothTitle IV and the IRC describe the "employer" of a sole pro-prietor or partner. See 29 U. S. C. $ 1301(b)(1) ("An individual who owns the entire interest in an unincorporated tradeor business is treated as his own employer, and a partnershipis treated as the employer of each partner who is an em-ployee within the meaning of section 401(c)(1) of [the IRC].");26 U. S. C. $ 401(c)(4) ("An individual who owns the entireinterest in an unincorporated trade or business shall betreated as his own employer. A partnership shall be treatedas the employer of each partner who is an employee withinthe meaning of [$ 401(c)(1)]."). These descriptions expresslyanticipate that a working owner can wear two hats, as anemployer and employee. Cf. Clackamas GastroenterologyAssociates, P. C. v. Wells, 538 U. S. 440, 453 (2003) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) ("Clackamas readily acknowledges thatthe physician-shareholders are `employees' for ERISApurposes.").In sum, because the statute's text is adequately informative, we need not look outside ERISA itself to conclude withsecurity that Congress intended working owners to qualifyas plan participants.5Congress' aim is advanced by our reading of the text.The working employer's opportunity personally to partici5 We do not suggest that each provision described supra, at 13-15 andthis page, in isolation, would compel the Court's reading. But cf. post, at25-26 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). In combination, however,the provisions supply "specific guidance" adequate to obviate any need toexpound on common law. See Darden, 503 U. S., at 323.541US1 Unit: $U27 [05-20-06 18:15:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN17Cite as: 541 U. S. 1 (2004)Opinion of the Courtpate and gain ERISA coverage serves as an incentive to thecreation of plans that will benefit employer and nonowneremployees alike. See Brief for United States as AmicusCuriae 21-22. Treating working owners as participants notonly furthers ERISA's purpose to promote and facilitate em-ployee benefit plans. Recognizing the working owner as anERISA-sheltered plan participant also avoids the anomalythat the same plan will be controlled by discrete regimes:federal-law governance for the nonowner employees; state-law governance for the working owner. See,e. g., Agrawal,205 F. 3d, at 302 (because sole shareholder does not rank asa plan participant under ERISA, his state-law claims againstinsurer are not preempted). ERISA's goal, this Court hasemphasized, is "uniform national treatment of pension bene-fits." Patterson v. Shumate, 504 U. S. 753, 765 (1992). Excepting working owners from the federal Act's coveragewould generate administrative difficulties and is hardly consistent with a national uniformity goal. Cf. Madonia, 11F. 3d, at 450 ("Disallowing shareholders . . . from being plan`participants' would result in disparate treatment of corpo-rate employees' claims, thereby frustrating the statutorypurpose of ensuring similar treatment for all claims relatingto employee benefit plans.").We note finally that a 1999 Department of Labor advisoryopinion accords with our comprehension of Title I's definitionand coverage provisions. Pension and Welfare BenefitsAdmin., U. S. Dept. of Labor, Advisory Opinion 99-04A, 26BNA Pension and Benefits Rep. 559 (hereinafter AdvisoryOpinion 99-04A). Confirming that working owners mayqualify as participants in ERISA-protected plans, the De-partment's opinion concludes:"In our view, the statutory provisions of ERISA,taken as a whole, reveal a clear Congressional design toinclude `working owners' within the definition of `partici-pant' for purposes of Title I of ERISA.

Such a result wouldcause an intolerable conflict between the separate titlesof ERISA, leading to the sort of `absurd results' that theSupreme Court warned against in Nationwide MutualInsurance Co. v. Darden, 503 U. S. 318 (1992)." Id., at560-561 (footnote omitted).This agency view on the qualification of a self-employed indi-vidual for plan participation reflects a "body of experienceand informed judgment to which courts and litigants mayproperly resort for guidance." Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323U. S. 134, 140 (1944). BThe Sixth Circuit's leading decision in point--its 1992 de-termination in Fugarino--relied, in large part, on an incorrect reading of a Department of Labor regulation, 29 CFR$ 2510.3-3.

YATES, M. D., P. C. PROFIT SHARINGPLAN v. HENDONOpinion of the CourtAlmost eight years after its decision in Fugarino, in Agrawal, the Sixth Circuit implied that it may have misreadthe regulation: "Th[e] limiting definition of employee [in$ 2510.3-3(c)] addresses the threshold issue of whether anERISA plan exists. It is not consistent with the purpose ofERISA to apply this limiting definition of employee to thestatutory definitions of participant and beneficiary." 205F. 3d, at 303. The Circuit, however, did not overrule itsearlier interpretation. See 287 F. 3d, at 525 (case below)("[T]he three judge panel before which this appeal is cur-rently pending has no authority to overruleFugarino.");Agrawal, 205 F. 3d, at 302 ("the decision in the present caseis preordained by theFugarino holding").The Department of Labor's 1999 advisory opinion, seesupra, at 17, interprets the "Employee benefit plan" regulation as follows:"In its regulation at 29 C. F. R. 2510.3-3, the Department clarified that the term `employee benefit plan' asdefined in section 3(3) of Title I does not include a planthe only participants of which are `[a]n individual andhis or her spouse . . . with respect to a trade of business, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which iswholly owned by the individual or by the individual andhis or her spouse' or `[a] partner in a partnership andhis or her spouse.' The regulation further specifies,however, that a plan that covers as participants `one ormore common law employees, in addition to the self-employed individuals' will be included in the definitionof `employee benefit plan' under section 3(3). The conclusion of this opinion, that such `self-employed individuals' are themselves `participants' in the coveredplan, is fully consistent with that regulation." Advisory Opinion 99-04A, at 561, n. 7 (emphasis added).This agency view, overlooked by the Sixth Circuit, see Brieffor United States as Amicus Curiae 26, merits the Judicia541US1 Unit: $U27 [05-20-06 18:15:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN21Cite as: 541 U. S. 1 (2004)Opinion of the Courtry's respectful consideration. Cf. Clackamas Gastroenterology Associates, P. C., 538 U. S., at 449 (Equal EmploymentOpportunity Commission guidelines under the Americanswith Disabilities Act of 1990 are persuasive).The Department's regulation itself reveals the definitionalprescription's limited scope. The prescription describes"employees" only "[f]or purposes of this section," supra, at19 (emphasis deleted), i. e., the section defining "employeebenefit plans." Accordingly, the regulation addresses onlywhat plans qualify as "employee benefit plans" under Title Iof ERISA. Plans that cover only sole owners or partnersand their spouses, the regulation instructs, fall outside TitleI's domain.6 Plans covering working owners and their nonowner employees, on the other hand, fall entirely withinERISA's compass.7 See Vega, 188 F. 3d, at 294 ("We . . .interpret the regulatio[n] to define employee only for purposes of determining the existence of an ERISA plan."); Ma6 Courts agree that if a benefit plan covers only working owners, it isnot covered by Title I. See, e. g., Slamen v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co.,166 F. 3d 1102, 1105 (CA11 1999) (sole shareholder is not a participantwhere disability plan covered only him); In re Watson, 161 F. 3d 593, 597(CA9 1998) (sole shareholder is not a participant where retirement plancovered only him); SEC v. Johnston, 143 F. 3d 260, 262-263 (CA6 1998)(owner is not a participant where pension plan covered only owner and"perhaps" his wife); Schwartz v. Gordon, 761 F. 2d 864, 867 (CA2 1985)(self-employed individual is not a participant where he is the only contributor to a Keogh plan). Such a plan, however, could qualify for favorabletax treatment. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 18, n. 9.7 Section 2510.3-3's preamble supports this interpretation. The preamble states, in relevant part:"According to the comments [concerning proposed $ 2510.3-3], a definitionof `employee' excluding self-employed individuals might raise problemsunder section 404(a)(1) with respect to disbursements to self-employedindividuals from `Keogh' or `H. R. 10' plans covering both self-employedindividuals and `common law' employees. Therefore, the definition of`employee' formerly appearing in proposed $ 2510.3-6 has been insertedinto $ 2510.3-3 and restricted in scope to that section." 40 Fed. Reg.34528 (1975) (emphasis added).541US1 Unit: $U27 [05-20-06 18:15:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN22 RAYMOND B. YATES, M. D., P. C. PROFIT SHARINGPLAN v. HENDONOpinion of the Courtdonia, 11 F. 3d, at 449-450 ("[T]he regulation does not govern the issue of whether someone is a `participant' in anERISA plan, once the existence of that plan has been established. This makes perfect sense: once a plan has been established, it would be anomalous to have those persons benefitting from it governed by two disparate sets of legalobligations.").Also in common with other Courts of Appeals that havedenied participant status to working owners, the Sixth Circuit's leading decision mistakenly relied, in addition, onERISA's "anti-inurement" provision, 29 U. S. C. $ 1103(c)(1),which prohibits plan assets from inuring to the benefit ofemployers. See Fugarino, 969 F. 2d, at 186 ("A fundamentalrequirement of ERISA is that `the assets of a plan shallnever inure to the benefit of any employer . . . .' "); Kwatcher,879 F. 2d, at 960 ("Once a person has been found to fit withinthe `employer' integument, [$ 1103(c)(1)] prohibits paymentsto him from a qualified plan."); Giardono, 867 F. 2d, at 411("It is a fundamental requirement of ERISA that `. . . theassets of a plan shall never inure to the benefit of anyemployer . . . .' ").Correctly read, however, the anti-inurement provisiondoes not preclude Title I coverage of working owners as planparticipants. It states that, with enumerated exceptions,"the assets of a plan shall never inure to the benefit of anyemployer and shall be held for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to participants in the plan and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering theplan." 29 U. S. C. $ 1103(c)(1). The provision demands onlythat plan assets be held for supplying benefits to plan participants. Like the Department of Labor regulation, see supra,at 18-19, the anti-inurement provision does not address thediscrete question whether working owners, along with nonowner employees, may be participants in ERISA-shelteredplans. As the Fifth Circuit observed in Vega:541US1 Unit: $U27 [05-20-06 18:15:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN23Cite as: 541 U. S. 1 (2004)Opinion of the Court"Th[e] [anti-inurement] provision refers to the congres-sional determination that funds contributed by the employer (and, obviously, by the [nonowner] employees . . .)must never revert to the employer; it does not relate toplan benefits being paid with funds or assets of the planto cover a legitimate pension or health benefit claim byan employee who happens to be a stockholder or eventhe sole shareholder of a corporation." 188 F. 3d, at293, n. 5.ERISA's anti-inurement provision is based on the anal-ogous exclusive benefit provision in the IRC, 26 U. S. C.$ 401(a)(2), which has never been understood to bar tax-qualified plan participation by working owners. See H. R.Conf. Rep. No. 93-1280, pp. 302-303 (1974); Brief for UnitedStates as Amicus Curiae 29. The purpose of the antiinurement provision, in common with ERISA's other fiduci-ary responsibility provisions, is to apply the law of trusts todiscourage abuses such as self-dealing, imprudent invest-ment, and misappropriation of plan assets, by employers andothers. See, e. g., Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. v. Doe, 76 F. 3d206, 209 (CA8 1996). Those concerns are not implicated bypaying benefits to working owners who participate on anequal basis with nonowner employees in ERISA-protectedplans.In sum, the anti-inurement provision, like the Departmentof Labor regulation, establishes no categorical barrier toworking owner participation in ERISA plans. WhetherYates himself, in his handling of loan repayments, see supra,at 8, engaged in conduct inconsistent with the anti-inurementprovision is an issue not yet reached by the courts below,one on which we express no opinion.* * *For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Ap-peals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion,541US1 Unit: $U27 [05-20-06 18:15:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN24 RAYMOND B.
