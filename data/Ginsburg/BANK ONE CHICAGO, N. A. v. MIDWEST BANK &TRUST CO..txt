This case concerns the Expedited Funds Availability Act,12 U. S. C. $$ 4001-4010, a 1987 law designed to acceleratethe availability of funds to bank depositors and to improvethe Nation's check payment system. We confront a jurisdictional question regarding the Act's civil liability provisions,in particular $$ 4010(a), (d), and (f ): Is federal-court subjectmatter jurisdiction under those provisions confined to suitsinitiated by bank customers against banks, as the Court ofAppeals held, or do federal courts have jurisdiction, as well,over suits brought by one bank against another depositoryinstitution? We hold that the Act provides for federal-courtjurisdiction not only in suits between customers and banks,but also in cases initiated by one bank against another bank.IHistorically, the Nation's check payment system has beencontrolled primarily by state law, particularly, in recent decades, by articles 3 and 4 of the Uniform Commercial Code(UCC). Although federal regulations have long supplemented state law in this area, see most notably RegulationJ, 12 CFR pt. 210 (1995), the UCC has supplied the basiclegal framework for bank deposits and check collections.But despite UCC controls, the check-clearing process toooften lagged, taking days or even weeks to complete. Toprotect themselves against the risk that a deposited checkwould be returned unpaid, banks typically placed lengthy"holds" on deposited funds. Bank customers, encounteringlong holds, complained that delayed access to deposited funds*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the ElectronicCheck Clearing House Organization by Robert G. Ballen, Gilbert T.Schwartz, and Dina J. Moskowitz; and for the New York Clearing HouseAssociation by Philip L. Graham, Jr., and Norman R.

The Act requires banks 1to make deposited funds available for withdrawal withinspecified time periods, subject to stated exceptions. See$$ 4002, 4003.

Subsection4010(a) addresses a bank's liability to persons other than an-other depository institution. It provides, in pertinent part:"Except as otherwise provided in this section, any de-pository institution which fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this chapter or any regulationprescribed under this chapter with respect to any person other than another depository institution is liable tosuch person in an amount equal to the sum of [a specifiedmeasure of damages]."Subsection 4010(f) governs a bank's liability to another bankfor violation of the Act's provisions.

Subpart C of Regulation CC contains rules to expedite thecollection and return of checks. It requires banks, amongother things, to return checks "in an expeditious manner,"$ 229.30(a); provide prompt notice of nonpayment of certainchecks, $ 229.33(a); and include in the notice the reason fornonpayment, $ 229.33(b)(8). Section 229.38 states standardsgoverning interbank liability. It instructs banks to "exer-cise ordinary care and act in good faith in complying withthe requirements of [Subpart C]," and further prescribes (inrelevant part): "A bank that fails to exercise ordinary careor act in good faith . . . may be liable to" other depositoryinstitutions. $ 229.38(a).

Petitioner Bank One Chicago suedrespondent Midwest Bank & Trust Co. in Federal DistrictCourt, alleging that Midwest had failed to comply with its516us2$19P 10-24-98 18:12:56 PAGES OPINPGT269Cite as: 516 U. S. 264 (1996)Opinion of the Courtobligations under Regulation CC. The facts underlying thesuit are uncontested. A customer of Bank One deposited acheck for $64,294.27 drawn on an account at Midwest. BankOne forwarded the check through the Federal Reserve System for collection, but Midwest returned it unpaid becauseBank One's endorsement stamp was illegible. Bank Oneproperly endorsed the check, resubmitted it for collection,and made the funds available to the Bank One customer.Midwest again returned the check unpaid, this time statingthat the payor's account lacked sufficient funds to cover thecheck. By then, however, Bank One's customer had withdrawn most of the funds from its account. Bank One soughtto recover the amount it paid out to its customer againstfunds that remain uncollected.On cross-motions for summary judgment, the DistrictCourt ruled for Bank One. That court centrally determined: "Midwest did not act with ordinary care [when it]return[ed] the check for guarantee of endorsement withoutfirst checking the sufficiency of the funds in support of thecheck." App. to Pet. for Cert. 12. To satisfy the payorbank's obligation under 12 CFR $ 229.38(a) (1995), the courtexplained, Midwest should have notified Bank One of the insufficient funds problem the first time Midwest returned thecheck. By failing to do so, the court concluded, Midwest hadcaused Bank One to lose $43,912.06. The court accordinglyentered judgment for Bank One in that amount. App. toPet. for Cert. 15. Midwest appealed.The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit did not reachthe merits of the appeal. Instead, the appellate court raisedat oral argument, on its own motion, a threshold question ofsubject-matter jurisdiction. After affording the parties anopportunity to file memoranda, the Court of Appeals vacatedthe judgment for Bank One and ordered the District Courtto dismiss the action for lack of jurisdiction.

MIDWEST BANK &TRUST CO.Opinion of the CourtExamining the civil liability provisions of 12 U. S. C.$ 4010, the Court of Appeals concluded that the EFA Actprovides for federal-court jurisdiction only when a "personother than [a] depository institution" sues a "depository institution," see 12 U. S. C. $ 4010(a), i. e., principally, when a de-positor sues a bank. 30 F. 3d, at 65. "Disputes such as[Bank One's complaint against Midwest], between membersof the Federal Reserve System," the Seventh Circuit stated,"are to be handled administratively before the Board of Gov-ernors of the Federal Reserve System . . . (or perhaps instate court)." Ibid. The court added, in response to a sub-mission by the Federal Reserve Board: "Although the Boardof Governors has informed us that no mechanism is currentlyavailable for administrative resolution of such [interbank]disputes, the Board's differing interpretation of this statutecannot confer jurisdiction upon the Court." Ibid.We granted certiorari. 515 U. S. 1157 (1995). Satisfiedthat the District Court had adjudicatory authority in thiscase, we now reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.IIIThe Court of Appeals and the parties advance diversereadings of 12 U. S. C. $ 4010. According to the Seventh Circuit, $ 4010 authorizes original federal-court jurisdiction onlyin actions between a bank and a person other than a bank.Subsection 4010(a) alone, in the Court of Appeals' view, pro-vides for rights immediately enforceable in federal court, andthat subsection excludes interbank suits, for it applies onlyto "disputes between `any depository institution' and `anyperson other than another depository institution.' " 30 F.3d, at 65 (quoting $ 4010(a)). Although $ 4010(f) provides forinterbank liability, the Court of Appeals read that subsectionto authorize only administrative adjudication. In the Seventh Circuit's words:"The purpose of the [EFA] Act is to require banks tomake funds available to depositors quickly. Thus the516us2$19P 10-24-98 18:12:56 PAGES OPINPGT271Cite as: 516 U. S. 264 (1996)Opinion of the Courtdepositors have rights, enforceable in court, while thebanks have obligations, which the Federal ReserveBoard may establish by regulation and enforce in admin-istrative proceedings." Ibid.The Court of Appeals did not say whether its readingof the statute encompassed an ultimate role for federalcourts, as judicial reviewers of the Board's administrativeadjudications.Midwest agrees with the Seventh Circuit that $ 4010(a)alone describes court-enforceable EFA Act rights--rightsthat depositors can assert against banks. But unlike theCourt of Appeals, Midwest is uncertain whether $ 4010(f) authorizes administrative adjudication by the Federal ReserveBoard. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33-34. Remaining neutral onthe Board's competence as a forum for resolving controver-sies between private parties, Midwest urges that the issuebefore this Court "is not whether the Board may adjudicatethe interbank dispute between petitioner and respondent,"but whether "the EFA Act confers on the federal districtcourt jurisdiction to decide this dispute." Brief for Respondent 23. In Midwest's view, Congress intended inter-bank disputes to be resolved primarily in state rather thanfederal courts. Id., at 5-6.2Both Bank One and the United States, as amicus curiae,agree with Midwest that state courts have jurisdiction overinterbank check payment disputes. But Bank One and theUnited States maintain that $ 4010(f), by providing for inter-bank "liability" up to the amount of the check as well as"other damages" in certain cases, authorizes interbank ac-tions for violations of liability regulations prescribed by the2 Midwest observes that UCC $ 4-103, 2B U. L. A. $ 4-103 (1991), treatsFederal Reserve Board regulations as "agreements" between participantsin the check payment system; damages for violation of the terms of suchagreements, Midwest further asserts, would be recoverable as a matter ofstate law. See, e. g., United Postal Savings Assn. v. Royal Bank MidCounty, 784 S. W. 2d 906 (Mo. App. 1990).516us2$19P 10-24-98 18:12:56 PAGES OPINPGT272 BANK ONE CHICAGO, N. A. v. MIDWEST BANK &TRUST CO.Opinion of the CourtFederal Reserve Board. And they regard $ 4010(d), whichspeaks of "[a]ny action under [$ 4010]," as instructing thatsuits under $ 4010(f), as well as those under $ 4010(a), "maybe brought in any United States district court."We hold that the District Court, in the instant case, cor-rectly comprehended its adjudicatory authority, and that theCourt of Appeals erred when it ordered dismissal of the ac-tion for lack of jurisdiction. The language of $ 4010, reinforced by the title of the provision and its drafting history,impel reading both subsections (a) and (f) as authorizingclaims for relief enforceable in federal court as prescribed insubsection (d).IVSection 4010 is entitled "Civil liability"; its purpose is toafford private parties a claim for relief based on violationsof the statute and its implementing regulations. Subsection(a) affords a claim for relief by making banks liable to "anyperson other than another depository institution." It refersto both individual and class actions, and specifies the measure of damages recoverable in such actions. All agree thatsuits described in subsection (a) may be brought in federalcourt under $ 4010(d).Subsection (f ) governs the area of liability not covered bysubsection (a): banks' liability inter se. It authorizes theFederal Reserve Board to "impose on or allocate among depository institutions the risks of loss and liability in connec-tion with any aspect of the [check] payment system," andstates that "[l]iability under this subsection" shall be limitedto the amount of the check, except in cases involving badfaith. In our view, subsection (f), like subsection (a), pro-vides a statutory basis for claims for relief cognizable in federal court under $ 4010(d). Both subsections impose civil li-ability for violation of the EFA Act and its implementingregulations. Though the two prescriptions are not paral-lel--most prominently, subsection (f ) vests the Board withauthority to establish the governing liability standards--516us2$19P 10-24-98 18:12:56 PAGES OPINPGT273Cite as: 516 U. S. 264 (1996)Opinion of the Courtthey serve the same key purpose: Both permit recovery ofdamages caused by a regulated party's failure to comply withthe Act.The drafting history of $ 4010 casts some light on the discrete composition and separate placement of subsections (a)and (f ). Under the versions of the statute originally passedby each House of Congress, subsection (a) encompassed actions between banks and persons other than banks, as wellas interbank actions. The Conference Committee narrowedsubsection (a) by excluding interbank actions, but simultane-ously inserted, still under the section heading "Civil liability," a new subsection (f). Compare H. R. Rep. No. 100-52,p. 10 (1987), and S. 790, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., $ 609(a) (1987),with H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 100-261, pp. 105-106 (1987).These changes reflect recognition that interbank disputesarising out of the check payment system may be more complex than those involving banks and depositors; such disputes, therefore, may warrant regulatory standards, set byan expert agency, to fill statutory interstices. Thus, in subsection (f ), Congress delegated to the Federal Reserve Boardauthority to establish rules allocating among depositoryinstitutions "the risks of loss and liability" relating to thepayment and collection of checks. 12 U. S. C. $ 4010(f).Having conferred this authority on the Board, Congresssensibly consolidated in subsection (f ) aspects of $ 4010 thatrelate to interbank disputes--liability limits as well as rulemaking authority.Congress no doubt intended rules regarding interbanklosses and liability to be developed administratively. Butnothing in $ 4010(f )'s text suggests that Congress meant theFederal Reserve Board to function as both regulator andadjudicator in interbank controversies. Rather, subsections(f) and (d) fit a familiar pattern: agency regulates, court adjudicates. See, e. g., Securities Act of 1933, 15 U. S. C. $ 77j(c)(mandating compliance with disclosure requirements established by Securities and Exchange Commission); $ 77k (creat516us2$19P 10-24-98 18:12:56 PAGES OPINPGT274 BANK ONE CHICAGO, N. A. v. MIDWEST BANK &TRUST CO.Opinion of the Courting right of action in "any court of competent jurisdiction"for violation of those requirements). As the United Statespersuasively contends: "Congress left it to the Board to determine the liability standards for losses in the inter-bankpayment system because of the greater complexity of thatsubject, and not because Congress intended to create remedies that would be adjudicated in different fora." Brief forUnited States as Amicus Curiae 13.We find implausible the Court of Appeals' interpretationof $ 4010, under which interbank disputes would be "handledadministratively" before the Federal Reserve Board. See30 F. 3d, at 65. Our cases have not been quick to inferagency authority to adjudicate private claims. In Coit Independence Joint Venture v. FSLIC, 489 U. S. 561 (1989), forexample, we held that the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) lacked statutory authority to adjudicate creditors' claims against insolvent savings and loanassociations. Id., at 572. We observed in Coit, after examining the relevant statutory provisions, that "when Congressmeant to confer adjudicatory authority on FSLIC it did soexplicitly and set forth the relevant procedures in considerable detail." Id., at 574.Similarly, in American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens, 513 U. S.219 (1995), we rejected American Airlines' argument thatCongress intended the Department of Transportation (DOT)to serve as the exclusive adjudicator of air carrier contractdisputes. Id., at 230-232. We noted that the DOT had"neither the authority nor the apparatus required to superintend a contract dispute resolution regime," id., at 232, andaccordingly declined to "foist on the DOT work Congress hasneither instructed nor funded the Department to do." Id.,at 234.As in Coit and Wolens, we find no secure signal here thatCongress intended to assign to the Federal Reserve Boardresponsibility for the adjudication of private claims.

C. $ 4010, does notexplicitly confer adjudicatory authority on the Board, nor"set forth the relevant procedures" for resolution of privatedisputes. See Coit, 489 U. S., at 574.3 Section 4010, westress, contrasts conspicuously with statutes in which Congress has given the Board adjudicatory authority. See, e. g.,Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, 12 U. S. C. $ 1843(c)(8)(authorizing Board to determine whether bank holding company may acquire shares in nonbanking entity); $ 1848(providing for judicial review of such determinations); cf.Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U. S. C. $ 18 (specifying detailedprocedures governing adjudication of private disputes by theCommodity Futures Trading Commission).Finally, we note that the interpretation of $ 4010 offeredby Bank One and the United States is a sensible one. Allcheck-related claims arising out of the same transaction maybe brought in a single forum--either in federal court (whichwould have supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims,see 28 U. S. C. $ 1367), or in state court. The reading of thestatute proposed by the Seventh Circuit, in contrast, wouldyield an incoherent jurisdictional scheme. Bank-depositorclaims would be adjudicated in one forum (state or federalcourt), while interbank claims under the EFA Act wouldoriginate in another (before the Federal Reserve Board).And interbank claims under state law would presumablyhave to be raised in a separate state-court proceeding.Even if the text of $ 4010 could plausibly be read to create3 The Court of Appeals cited 12 U. S. C. $ 4009(c)(1) as a potential sourceof the Board's authority to adjudicate private disputes. First IllinoisBank & Trust v. Midwest Bank & Trust Co., 30 F. 3d 64, 65 (CA7 1994).But as the United States points out, that section merely authorizes theBoard to use traditional administrative enforcement tools in securing compliance with the EFA Act.
