BLUMEROpinion of the Courtspousal impoverishment provisions permit a spouse livingat home (called the "community spouse") to reserve certainincome and assets to meet the minimum monthly mainte-nance needs he or she will have when the other spouse (the"institutionalized spouse") is institutionalized, usually in anursing home, and becomes eligible for Medicaid.The Act shelters from diminution a standard amount ofassets (called the "community spouse resource allowance,""CSRA," or "resource allowance"). The MCCA allows anincrease in the standard allowance if either spouse shows,at a state-administered hearing, that the community spousewill not be able to maintain the statutorily defined minimumlevel of income on which to live after the institutionalizedspouse gains Medicaid eligibility.In determining whether the community spouse is entitledto a higher CSRA, i. e., to shelter assets in excess of thestandard resource allowance, Wisconsin, like a majority ofother States, uses an "income-first" method. Under thatmethod, the State considers first whether potential incometransfers from the institutionalized spouse, which the MCCAexpressly permits, will suffice to enable the communityspouse to meet monthly needs once the institutionalizedspouse qualifies for Medicaid.Respondent Irene Blumer, whose Medicaid eligibility wasdelayed by the application of petitioner Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services' income-first method,challenges that method as inconsistent with the MCCA provision governing upward revision of the community spouseresource allowance, $ 1396r-5(e)(2)(C) (1994 ed.). The Wisconsin Court of Appeals upheld her challenge. We reversethat court's judgment. Neither the text of $ 1396r-5(e)(2)(C)nor the structure of the MCCA, we conclude, forbids Wisconsin's chosen approach. Consistent with the position adoptedby the Secretary of Health and Human Services, we holdthat the income-first method represents a permissible interpretation of the Act.534US2 Unit: $U23 [04-10-03 19:42:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN479Cite as: 534 U.

OF HEALTH AND FAMILY SERVS.v. BLUMEROpinion of the CourtSimilarly, assets held jointly by the couple were commonlydeemed "available" in full to the institutionalized spouse.At the same time, States generally did not treat resourcesheld individually by the community spouse as available to theinstitutionalized spouse. Accordingly, assets titled solelyin the name of the community spouse often escaped consideration in determining the institutionalized spouse's Medicaid eligibility. See H. R. Rep. No. 100-105, pt. 2, pp. 66-67(1987).As Congress later found when it enacted the MCCA in1988, these existing practices for determining a married applicant's income and resources produced unintended consequences. Many community spouses were left destitute bythe drain on the couple's assets necessary to qualify the institutionalized spouse for Medicaid and by the diminutionof the couple's income posteligibility to reduce the amountpayable by Medicaid for institutional care. See id., at 66-68.Conversely, couples with ample means could qualify for assistance when their assets were held solely in the communityspouse's name.In the MCCA, Congress sought to protect communityspouses from "pauperization" while preventing financiallysecure couples from obtaining Medicaid assistance. See id.,at 65 (bill seeks to "end th[e] pauperization" of the community spouse "by assuring that the community spouse hasa sufficient--but not excessive--amount of income and resources available"). To achieve this aim, Congress installeda set of intricate and interlocking requirements with whichStates must comply in allocating a couple's income andresources.Income allocation is governed by $$ 1396r-5(b) and (d).Covering any month in which "an institutionalized spouseis in the institution," $ 1396r-5(b)(1) provides that "no income of the community spouse shall be deemed availableto the institutionalized spouse." The community spouse'sincome is thus preserved for that spouse and does not affect534US2 Unit: $U23 [04-10-03 19:42:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN481Cite as: 534 U. S. 473 (2002)Opinion of the Courtthe determination whether the institutionalized spouse qual-ifies for Medicaid. In general, such income is also disregarded in calculating the amount Medicaid will pay for theinstitutionalized spouse's care after eligibility is established.Other provisions specifically address income allocation inthe period after the institutionalized spouse becomes Medicaid eligible. Section 1396r-5(b)(2)(A) prescribes, as a mainrule, that if payment of income is made solely in the nameof one spouse, that income is treated as available only tothe named spouse (the "name-on-the-check" rule). Section1396r-5(d) provides a number of exceptions to that mainrule designed to ensure that the community spouse and otherdependents have income sufficient to meet basic needs.Among the exceptions, $ 1396r-5(d)(3) establishes for thecommunity spouse a "minimum monthly maintenance needsallowance," or MMMNA. The MMMNA is calculated bymultiplying the federal poverty level for a couple by a percentage set by the State. Since 1992, that percentage mustbe at least 150%, $$ 1396r-5(d)(3)(A)-(B), but the resultingMMMNA may not exceed $1,500 per month in 1988 dollars($2,175 in 2001 dollars), $$ 1396r-5(d)(3)(C), (g).2If the income of the community spouse determined under$ 1396r-5(b)(2), which states the "name-on-the-check" rule,is insufficient to yield income equal to or above the MMMNA,$ 1396r-5(d)(1)(B) comes into play. Under that provision,the amount of the shortfall is "deducted" from the incomeof the institutionalized spouse--reducing the amount of in-come that would otherwise be considered available for theinstitutionalized spouse's care--so long as that income isactually made available to the community spouse. The2 The State must also provide for an "excess shelter allowance" if necessary to cover, inter alia, unusually high rent or mortgage payments.$$ 1396r-5(d)(3)(A)(ii), (d)(4). Either spouse may request a hearing toseek a higher MMMNA for the community spouse; such an increase willbe allowed if the couple establishes "exceptional circumstances resultingin significant financial duress." $ 1396r-5(e)(2)(B).534US2 Unit: $U23 [04-10-03 19:42:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN482 WISCONSIN DEPT.

BLUMEROpinion of the Courtamount thus reallocated from the institutionalized spouseto the community spouse is called the "community spousemonthly income allowance," or CSMIA, $ 1396r-5(d)(1)(B).The provision for this allowance ensures that income transferred from the institutionalized spouse to the communityspouse to meet the latter's basic needs is not also consideredavailable for the former's care. As a result, Medicaid willpay a greater portion of the institutionalized spouse's medical expenses than it would absent the CSMIA provision.Resource allocation is controlled by $$ 1396r-5(c) and (f).3For purposes of establishing the institutionalized spouse'sMedicaid eligibility,4 a portion of the couple's assets is reserved for the benefit of the community spouse. $ 1396r-5(c)(2). To determine that reserved amount (the CSRA),the total of all of the couple's resources (whether ownedjointly or separately) is calculated as of the time the in-stitutionalized spouse's institutionalization commenced; halfof that total is then allocated to each spouse (the "spousalshare"). $ 1396r-5(c)(1)(A). The spousal share allocated tothe community spouse qualifies as the CSRA, subject to aceiling of $60,000 indexed for inflation (in 2001, the ceil-ing was $87,000) and a floor, set by the State, between$12,000 and $60,000 (also indexed for inflation; in 2001, theamounts were $17,400 and $87,000). $$ 1396r-5(c)(2)(B),(f)(2)(A), (g).5 The CSRA is considered unavailable to the3 The Act excludes from the definition of "resources" the couple's home,one automobile, personal belongings, and certain other forms of property.$$ 1382b(a) (1994 ed. and Supp. V), 1396r-5(c)(5) (1994 ed.).4 Once the institutionalized spouse is determined to be eligible, "no resources [gained by] the community spouse shall be deemed available tothe institutionalized spouse." $ 1396r-5(c)(4).5 As the United States points out, Brief for United States as AmicusCuriae 8, n. 4, the MCCA technically defines the CSRA as only a portionof the assets protected for the benefit of the community spouse. Under$ 1396r-5(f)(2), the CSRA denotes the amount by which the communityspouse's "spousal share" of the couple's resources falls below the resourceallowance set by the State pursuant to $ 1396r-5(f)(2)(A).

The dispute in this case centers on $ 1396r-5(e)(2)(C),which allows a couple to request a higher CSRA. That sec-tion provides in relevant part:"If either . . . spouse establishes that the [CSRA](in relation to the amount of income generated by suchan allowance) is inadequate to raise the communityspouse's income to the [MMMNA], there shall be substituted, for the [CSRA] under subsection (f )(2) of this sec-tion, an amount adequate to provide [the MMMNA]."If the couple succeeds in obtaining a higher CSRA, theinstitutionalized spouse may reserve additional resourcesfor posteligibility transfer to the community spouse. Theenhanced CSRA will reduce the resources the statute deemsering this shortfall are automatically excluded from consideration in theeligibility determination and transferred to the community spouse aftereligibility is achieved. $$ 1396r-5(f)(1), (2).We observe, however, that the parties here, like the court below, referto the CSRA as the total resources the community spouse is permitted toretain, an amount generally equal to the spousal share.

The Secretary of Healthand Human Services employs the same broad definition: According to theSecretary, the CSRA means "the amount of a couple's combined jointlyand separately-owned resources . . . allocated to the community spouseand considered unavailable to the institutionalized spouse when determining his or her eligibility for Medicaid." 66 Fed.

BLUMEROpinion of the Courtavailable for the payment of medical expenses; accordingly,the institutionalized spouse will become eligible for Medicaid sooner.In allocating income and resources between spouses forpurposes of $ 1396r-5(e)(2)(C), the States have employed twodivergent methods: an "income-first" method, used by mostStates; and a "resources-first" method, preferred by theothers. The two methods differ in their construction of theterm "community spouse's income" in subsection (e)(2)(C).Under the income-first method, "community spouse's in-come" is defined to include not only the community spouse'sactual income at the time of the $ 1396r-5(e) fair hearing,but also a potential posteligibility income transfer from theinstitutionalized spouse--the CSMIA authorized by $ 1396r-5(d)(1)(B), see supra, at 481-482. Thus, only if the community spouse's preeligibility income plus the CSMIA will fallbelow the MMMNA may the couple reserve a greater portionof assets through an enhanced CSRA.The resources-first method, by contrast, excludes theCSMIA from consideration. "Community spouse's income"under that approach includes only income actually receivedby the community spouse at the time of the $ 1396r-5(e) hearing, not any anticipated posteligibility income transfer fromthe institutionalized spouse pursuant to $ 1396r-5(d)(1)(B).If the community spouse's income so defined will fall belowthe MMMNA, the CSRA will be raised to reserve additionalassets sufficient to generate income meeting the shortfall,whether or not the CSMIA could also accomplish that task.In sum, the income-first method, because it takes accountof the potential CSMIA, makes it less likely that the CSRAwill be increased; it therefore tends to require couplesto expend additional resources before the institutionalizedspouse becomes Medicaid eligible.The Secretary of Health and Human Services has issuedseveral statements supporting the income-first method. Initially, the Secretary interpreted the MCCA as requiring534US2 Unit: $U23 [04-10-03 19:42:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN485Cite as: 534 U.

More recently, the Secretary hasconcluded that the Act permits both income-first and "someother reasonable interpretation of the law." HCFA, Chi-cago Regional State Letter No. 22-94, p. 2 (July 1994), App.to Pet. for Cert. 89a.The Secretary has circulated for comment a proposedrule "allow[ing] States the threshold choice of using eitherthe income-first or resources-first method when determiningwhether the community spouse has sufficient income to meetminimum monthly maintenance needs." 66 Fed. Reg. 46763,46765 (2001). The proposed rule details the Secretary's rea-sons for concluding that the Act does not "clearly requir[e]the use of either [method] to the exclusion of the other."Id., at 46767. Accordingly, "in view of the cooperative fed-eralism considerations embodied in the Medicaid program,"id., at 46765, the Secretary found it appropriate to "leaveto States the decision as to which alternative to use,"id.,at 46767.6BThe facts of this case illustrate the operation of the Actand the different consequences of the income-first andresources-first approaches. Irene Blumer was admitted toa Wisconsin nursing home in 1994 and applied for Medicaidassistance in 1996 through her husband Burnett. In accordwith $ 1396r-5(c), the Green County Department of HumanServices (County) determined that as of Irene's institutional-ization in 1994, the couple's resources amounted to $145,644.Dividing this amount evenly between the Blumers, the6 Comments on the proposed rule were to be submitted by November 6,2001. As the Government related at oral argument, however, the Secretary fears that comments have not reached the agency due to the disruption of the Nation's postal system in October and November 2001.See Tr. of Oral Arg. 16-17. It remains unclear when the Secretary willtake further action on the proposed rule. See 66 Fed. Reg. 61625 (2001).534US2 Unit: $U23 [04-10-03 19:42:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN486 WISCONSIN DEPT.

Burnett was allo-cated this $72,822 share as his CSRA,7 and Irene was entitledto reserve a personal allowance of $2,000, 20 CFR $ 416.1205(2001). Combining these sums, the County determined thatthe Blumers could retain $74,822 in assets.The County next found that, as of the date of Irene's application, the Blumers' resources had been reduced from$145,644 to $89,335. That amount exceeded by $14,513 thecouple's resource eligibility threshold. The County accord-ingly concluded that Irene would not be eligible for Medicaiduntil the couple's assets were spent down to the $74,822 limit.Seeking to obtain a higher CSRA, Irene requested a hearing. For purposes of the hearing, Burnett's monthly incomeamounted to $1,639, consisting of $1,015 in Social Securitybenefits, $309 from an annuity, and $315 generated by theassets protected in his CSRA.8 Irene argued that becauseBurnett's monthly income fell below the applicable MMMNAof $1,727, the examiner was obliged to increase his CSRA,thereby protecting additional assets capable of covering theincome shortfall.Excluding Irene's $2,000 personal allowance, the Blumers'total remaining assets exceeded Burnett's $72,822 standard CSRA, as just noted, by $14,513, an amount generatingroughly $63 in monthly income. Attributing that incometo Burnett would have raised his monthly income to $1,702,7 Wisconsin sets the CSRA floor at $50,000. Wis. Stat. $ 49.455(6)(b)1m(1999-2001). Because Burnett's $72,822 spousal share exceeded thatamount but fell below the federally imposed ceiling, which was then$79,020 ($60,000 indexed for inflation to 1996), the spousal share becamehis CSRA. App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a.8 The hearing examiner incorrectly calculated Burnett's relevantmonthly income to be $1,702, mistakenly attributing to him all of the$378 in income generated by the full $87,355 in the couple's remainingavailable resources, rather than the $315 yielded by the $72,822 in assetsreserved in his CSRA. See id., at 25a; Tr. 8 (Apr. 29, 1997). Althoughthe error does not affect our decision, we use the correct figures (roundedto the nearest dollar) for illustrative purposes.534US2 Unit: $U23 [04-10-03 19:42:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN487Cite as: 534 U. S. 473 (2002)Opinion of the Courtstill $25 short of the MMMNA. Thus, had the hearing of-ficer applied the resources-first method--addressing Burnett's income shortfall by first reserving additional assetsfor his benefit--the examiner would have increased Burnett's CSRA to encompass all of the Blumers' remainingavailable resources, and Irene would have become immediately eligible for Medicaid. The remaining $25 deficit inBurnett's income could then have been covered posteligi-bility by a monthly transfer of income (or CSMIA) fromIrene, who at the time of the hearing received $927 permonth in Social Security and $336 from a pension.Wisconsin, however, has adopted the income-first rule bystatute:"If either spouse establishes at a fair hearing that thecommunity spouse resource allowance determined undersub. (6)(b) without a fair hearing does not generateenough income to raise the community spouse's incometo the [MMMNA] . . . , the department shall establish anamount to be used under sub.

Stat. $ 49.455(8)(d) (1999-2000) (emphasis added).Applying this rule, the hearing examiner concluded that hewas without authority to increase Burnett's CSRA: The difference between Burnett's monthly income and the MMMNAcould be erased if, after achieving eligibility, Irene madeavailable to Burnett $88 per month from her own income.This, the examiner concluded, Irene would be able to do; ac534US2 Unit: $U23 [04-10-03 19:42:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN488 WISCONSIN DEPT.

We disagree.Congress' use of the possessive case does not demand construction of "community spouse's income" to mean only income actually possessed by, rather than available or attributable to, the community spouse; to the contrary, the useof the possessive is often indeterminate. See J.

See Brief for Respondent 18.Because the Wisconsin statute requires imputation of theCSMIA to the community spouse before additional assetsmay be reserved, Blumer concludes, the statute reversesthe priority established by the MCCA.In accord with the Secretary, we do not agree that Congress circumscribed the (e)(2)(C) hearing in the mannerBlumer urges. Although that hearing is conducted preeligibility,9 its purpose is to anticipate the posteligibilityfinancial situation of the couple. The procedure seeks toproject what the community spouse's income will be whenthe institutionalized spouse becomes eligible. See Tr. ofOral Arg. 14 (officer conducting (e)(2)(C) hearing makes acalculation that "concerns the post eligibility period"; question is will "the at-home spouse . . . have sufficient incomein the post eligibility period, or does the resource allowance need to be jacked up in order to provide that additionalincome"). The hearing officer must measure that projectedincome against the MMMNA, a standard that, like theCSMIA, is operative only posteligibility. $$ 1396r-5(b)(2),(d)(3).In short, if the (e)(2)(C) hearing is properly comprehendedas a preeligibility projection of the couple's posteligibilitysituation, as we think it is, we do not count it unreasonablefor a State to include in its estimation of the "community9 That the hearing must occur preeligibility is dictated by the mechanicsof the process; in order to preserve the assets, if any, that will be necessaryfor the community spouse's support in the posteligibility period, a couplemust know in advance what resources it need not and should not expendbefore the institutionalized spouse becomes Medicaid eligible.534US2 Unit: $U23 [04-10-03 19:42:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN492 WISCONSIN DEPT.

BLUMEROpinion of the Courtspouse's income" in that posteligibility period an incometransfer that may then occur.10Blumer's skewed view of the (e)(2)(C) hearing also under-lies the contention, advanced at oral argument, see Tr. ofOral Arg. 6-10, that the income-first method renders mean-ingless the Act's key prohibition against deeming incomeof the community spouse available to the institutionalizedone. $ 1396r-5(b)(1). According to this argument, including the CSMIA as part of the "community spouse's income"under subsection (e)(2)(C) effectively converts some incomeof the institutionalized spouse into income of the communityspouse. And prior to eligibility, the argument continues,all of the institutionalized spouse's income is consideredavailable for medical expenses. $ 1396a(a)(10)(A); 42 CFR$ 435.120 (2000). Thus, the theory concludes, under income-first the CSMIA would, as a logical matter, be considered10 Taking issue with this characterization of the (e)(2)(C) hearing, thedissent emphasizes the Wisconsin statute's prescription that no CSRAenhancement will be allowed "unless the institutionalized spouse makesavailable to the community spouse the maximum monthly income allowance permitted," post, at 503 (quoting Wis. Stat. $ 49.455(8)(d) (1993-1994))(emphasis supplied by dissent). Only by omitting essential language fromthe Wisconsin provision can the dissent construe the statute as "requir[ing] a preeligibility transfer of income from the institutionalized spouseto the community spouse," post, at 503 (emphasis added). The state statute in fact provides that the CSRA may not be enhanced "unless the institutionalized spouse makes available to the community spouse the maximum monthly income allowance permitted under sub. (4)(b)." Wis. Stat.$ 49.455(8)(d) (emphasis added). Subsection (4)(b) is substantially identical to $ 1396r-5(d)(1), the very provision of the MCCA that the dissentfinds in conflict with $ 49.455(8)(d). Like $ 1396r-5(d)(1), subsection (4)(b)directs that any income transfer from the institutionalized spouse to thecommunity spouse may occur only "after [the] institutionalized spouse isdetermined . . . to be eligible." Wis. Stat. $ 49.455(4)(b) (1999-2000). Because subsection (4)(b) of the Wisconsin statute therefore would not "permit" a preeligibility income transfer from the institutionalized spouse,$ 49.455(8)(d) by its terms does not do so either. In drawing a contraryinference based on an incomplete reading, the dissent, not the Court, "neglects to consider the text of the state statute in issue," post, at 502.534US2 Unit: $U23 [04-10-03 19:42:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN493Cite as: 534 U. S. 473 (2002)Opinion of the Courtboth "community spouse's income" and "available" for theinstitutionalized spouse's medical expenses in clear contravention of subsection (b)(1).This argument confuses the inclusi on of a projectedCSMIA in the preeligibility calculation of the communityspouse's posteligibility income with the actualtransfer of income contemplated by the CSMIA provision. The (e)(2)(C)hearing is, again, simply a projection of the state of affairsthat will exist posteligibility. The theoretical incorporationof a CSMIA into the community spouse's future income atthat hearing has no effect on the preeligibility allocationof income between the spouses. A CSMIA becomes part ofthe community spouse's income only when it is in fact transferred to that spouse, $ 1396r-5(d)(1)(B), which may not occuruntil "[a]fter [the] institutionalized spouse is determined . . .to be eligible." $ 1396r-5(d)(1). At that point, the actualCSMIA is deducted from the institutionalized spouse's income, ibid., and is no longer available for medical expenses.Thus, at all times the rule of subsection (b)(1) is honored, forat no time is any income of the community spouse simultaneously deemed available to the institutionalized spouse.11Far from precluding Wisconsin's chosen approach, theMCCA's design offers affirmative support for the permissibility of the income-first method. Subsection (b)(1), pro11 Blumer also contends that $ 1396r-5(a)(3) forbids the income-firstmethod because that provision expressly leaves in place the existing Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program rules for determining what constitutes income and resources, including the standards and methods usedin such determinations. See Brief for Respondent 19-22. In particular,Blumer emphasizes that subsection (a)(3) imposes the SSI requirement,codified at $ 1396a(r)(2)(B), that States may not adopt income-assessmentstandards that reduce the number of people eligible for SSI. See id.,at 21. As Wisconsin points out, however, the issue carved out by $ 1396r-5(a)(3)--what qualifies as income or resources--is not implicated by thiscase. Reply Brief 5; see supra, at 490. At issue here is the differentquestion, governed entirely by the MCCA, of whether money that is indisputably "income" may be attributed to the community spouse.534US2 Unit: $U23 [04-10-03 19:42:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN494 WISCONSIN DEPT. OF HEALTH AND FAMILY SERVS.v. BLUMEROpinion of the Courthibiting attribution of the community spouse's income to theinstitutionalized spouse, has no counterpart running in theopposite direction. Indeed, the Act specifically provides fora transfer of income from the institutionalized spouse to thecommunity spouse through the CSMIA. $ 1396r-5(d)(1)(B).Mindful of the Medicaid program's background principle that"it is proper to expect spouses to support each other," GrayPanthers, 453 U. S., at 45 (quoting S. Rep. No. 404, pt. 1, at78) (internal quotation marks omitted), we are satisfied thata State reasonably interprets the MCCA by anticipating theCSMIA in the (e)(2)(C) hearing.1212 According to the dissent, anticipating the CSMIA in this manner effectively "mandates an income transfer that Congress left optional," post,at 503-504. The dissent presumably means that the CSMIA, once projected as part of the "community spouse's income" in the (e)(2)(C) hearing,must in fact be transferred posteligibility lest the community spouse receive income below the statutorily guaranteed MMMNA. As this caseillustrates, however, application of the resources-first method may yieldthe same situation. If the hearing examiner had granted Irene's requestto increase Burnett's CSRA without regard to a potential CSMIA, Burnett's income would still have fallen $25 short of the MMMNA, see supra,at 486-487. A posteligibility income transfer in that amount would therefore have been "mandatory" as the dissent understands that term, post,at 504. Thus, the dissent's issue is not with the income-first method, butrather with the friction between Congress' decision to guarantee a minimum level of income for the community spouse and its failure to mandatethe transfer of income necessary in many cases to realize that guarantee.Similarly, in faulting the income-first method for the possibility thatits projections may prove inaccurate, see ibid., the dissent attacks a problem inherent in the design of the Act itself. As long as the (e)(2)(C) hearing is conducted preeligibility, see supra, at 491, n. 9, the hearing examinermust inevitably make predictions, and those predictions "may not ultimately come to fruition," post, at 504. Under the resources-first method,just as under income-first, the examiner must decide whether to enhancethe CSRA based on speculation about the community spouse's income inthe posteligibility period. If that income diminishes unexpectedly, thecommunity spouse may be left without the level of income that the examiner "predicted" at the (e)(2)(C) hearing, and on the basis of which theexaminer denied a CSRA enhancement.534US2 Unit: $U23 [04-10-03 19:42:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN495Cite as: 534 U. S. 473 (2002)Opinion of the CourtWe further note that subsection (e), governing fair hear-ings in general, is not limited to a redetermination of theCSRA. It also permits a hearing if the couple is dissatis-fied with:"(i) the [CSMIA];"(ii) the amount of monthly income otherwise availableto the community spouse . . . ;"(iii) the computation of the spousal share of resourcesunder subsection (c)(1) of this section; [and]"(iv) the attribution of resources under subsection (c)(2)of this section." $ 1396r-5(e)(2)(A).Given that the CSMIA itself may be adjusted in a fair hear-ing under subsection (e)(2)(A)(i), we cannot conclude thatthe States are forbidden to consider the projected CSMIAin the related hearing, authorized by subsection (e)(2)(A)(v),to increase the CSRA. Accord, Cleary, 167 F. 3d, at 810.IIIWe thus hold that the income-first method is a permissiblemeans of implementing the Act. The parties here have notalso disputed the permissibility of the resources-first ap-proach. We therefore do not definitively resolve that matter, although we note that the leeway for state choices urgedby both Wisconsin and the United States is characteristicof Medicaid.The Medicaid statute, in which the MCCA is implanted,is designed to advance cooperative federalism. See Harrisv.McRae, 448 U. S. 297, 308 (1980). When interpretingother statutes so structured, we have not been reluctantto leave a range of permissible choices to the States, atleast where the superintending federal agency has concludedthat such latitude is consistent with the statute's aims. InBatterton v. Francis, 432 U. S. 416, 429 (1977), for example,we upheld a regulation promulgated by the Secretary ofHealth, Education, and Welfare affording the States dis534US2 Unit: $U23 [04-10-03 19:42:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN496 WISCONSIN DEPT. OF HEALTH AND FAMILY SERVS.v. BLUMEROpinion of the Courtcretion in the implementation of the Aid to Families withDependent Children (AFDC) unemployed parent program.The challenged regulation allowed States to cover or excludefrom coverage persons whose unemployment resulted fromparticipation in a labor dispute or whose conduct would dis-qualify them for benefits under the State's compensation law.Noting that the AFDC program involved the "concept ofcooperative federalism," id., at 431, we concluded that theSecretary had the authority to "recognize some local optionsin determining . . . eligibility," id., at 430. Similarly, inLukhard v. Reed, 481 U. S. 368 (1987), a plurality of thisCourt concluded that Virginia's policy of treating personalinjury awards as income rather than resources under theAFDC program was reasonable and consistent with federallaw, seeid., at 377-381. The superintending federal agency,the plurality pointed out, had for many years permittedVirginia's choice while allowing other States to treat suchawards as resources. Id., at 378.The Secretary of Health and Human Services, who possesses the authority to prescribe standards relevant to theissue here, $ 1396a(a)(17),13 has preliminarily determinedthat the MCCA permits both the income-first and resourcesfirst methods. See 66 Fed. Reg. 46763, 46767 (2001); HCFA,Chicago Regional State Letter No. 22-94, at 2, App. to Pet.13 Blumer argues that $ 1396r-5(a)(1) divests the Secretary of the authority granted under $ 1396a(a)(17) to prescribe standards governing the allocation of income and resources for Medicaid purposes. See Brief for Respondent 39. Subsection (a)(1) states that the eligibility provisions of theMCCA "supersede any other provision of this subchapter (including sections 1396a(a)(17) and 1396a(f) of this title) which is inconsistent withthem," but says nothing about the regulatory authority of the Secretaryunder $ 1396a(a)(17). We have long noted Congress' delegation of extremely broad regulatory authority to the Secretary in the Medicaid area,see Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, 453 U. S. 34, 43 (1981); Batterton v. Francis, 432 U. S. 416, 425 (1977), and we will not conclude that Congress implicitly withdrew that authority here.534US2 Unit: $U23 [04-10-03 19:42:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN497Cite as: 534 U.
