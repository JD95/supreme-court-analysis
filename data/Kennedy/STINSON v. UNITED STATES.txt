UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtSentencing Guidelines is not binding on the federal courts.We decide that commentary in the Guidelines Manual thatinterprets or explains a guideline is authoritative unless itviolates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.Petitioner Terry Lynn Stinson entered a plea of guilty toa five-count indictment resulting from his robbery of a Florida bank. The presentence report recommended that peti-tioner be sentenced as a career offender under the Sentencing Guidelines. See United States Sentencing Commission,Guidelines Manual $ 4B1.1 (Nov. 1989). Section 4B1.1 provided that a defendant is a career offender if:"(1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at thetime of the instant offense, (2) the instant offense of con-viction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or acontrolled substance offense, and (3) the defendant hasat least two prior felony convictions of either a crime ofviolence or a controlled substance offense."All concede that petitioner was at least 18 years old whenthe events leading to the indictment occurred and that hethen had at least two prior felony convictions for crimes ofviolence, thereby satisfying the first and third elements inthe definition of career offender. It is the second element inthis definition, the requirement that the predicate offense bea crime of violence, that gave rise to the ultimate problemin this case. At the time of his sentencing, the Guidelinesdefined "crime of violence" as, among other things, "any of-fense under federal or state law punishable by imprisonmentfor a term exceeding one year that . . . involves conduct thatpresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another." $ 4B1.2(1). The United States District Court forthe Middle District of Florida found that petitioner's conviction for the offense of possession of a firearm by a convictedfelon, 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g), was a crime of violence, satisfyingthe second element of the career offender definition. Al508us1$66Z 02-13-97 13:36:06 PAGES OPINPGT39Cite as: 508 U. S. 36 (1993)Opinion of the Courtthough the indictment contained other counts, the DistrictCourt relied only upon the felon-in-possession offense inapplying the career offender provision of the Guidelines. Inaccord with its conclusions, the District Court sentencedpetitioner as a career offender.On appeal, petitioner maintained his position that the offense relied upon by the District Court was not a crime ofviolence under USSG $$ 4B1.1 and 4B1.2(1). The Court ofAppeals affirmed, holding that possession of a firearm by afelon was, as a categorical matter, a crime of violence. 943F. 2d 1268, 1271-1273 (CA11 1991). After its decision, how-ever, Amendment 433 to the Guidelines Manual, which addeda sentence to the commentary to $ 4B1.2, became effective.The new sentence stated that "[t]he term `crime of violence'does not include the offense of unlawful possession of a fire-arm by a felon."1 USSG App. C, p. 253 (Nov. 1992). See$ 4B1.2, comment., n. 2. Petitioner sought rehearing, ar-guing that Amendment 433 should be given retroactiveeffect, but the Court of Appeals adhered to its earlier inter-pretation of "crime of violence" and denied the petition forrehearing in an opinion. 957 F. 2d 813 (CA11 1992) (percuriam).Rather than considering whether the amendment shouldbe given retroactive application, the Court of Appeals heldthat commentary to the Guidelines, though "persuasive," isof only "limited authority" and not "binding" on the federalcourts. Id., at 815. It rested this conclusion on the fact1 Amendment 433 was contrary to a substantial body of Circuit precedent holding that the felon-in-possession offense constituted a crime ofviolence in at least some circumstances. See, e. g., United States v.Williams, 892 F. 2d 296, 304 (CA3 1989), cert. denied, 496 U. S. 939 (1990);United States v. Goodman, 914 F. 2d 696, 698-699 (CA5 1990); UnitedStates v.

The Commission executed this function bypromulgating the Guidelines Manual. The Manual containstext of three varieties. First is a guideline provision itself.The Sentencing Reform Act establishes that the Guidelinesare "for use of a sentencing court in determining the sentenceto be imposed in a criminal case." 28 U. S. C. $ 994(a)(1).The Guidelines provide direction as to the appropriate type ofpunishment--probation, fine, or term of imprisonment--andthe extent of the punishment imposed. $$ 994(a)(1)(A) and(B). Amendments to the Guidelines must be submitted toCongress for a 6-month period of review, during which Congress can modify or disapprove them. $ 994(p). The secondvariety of text in the Manual is a policy statement. TheSentencing Reform Act authorizes the promulgation of "general policy statements regarding application of the guidelines" or other aspects of sentencing that would further thepurposes of the Act. $ 994(a)(2). The third variant of textis commentary, at issue in this case. In the Guidelines Manual, both guidelines and policy statements are accompaniedby extensive commentary. Although the Sentencing Reform Act does not in express terms authorize the issuanceof commentary, the Act does refer to it. See 18 U. S. C.$ 3553(b) (in determining whether to depart from a guidelines range, "the court shall consider only the sentencingguidelines, policy statements, and official commentary of theSentencing Commission"). The Sentencing Commission hasprovided in a Guideline that commentary may serve thesefunctions: commentary may "interpret [a] guideline or explain how it is to be applied," "suggest circumstances which. . . may warrant departure from the guidelines," or "providebackground information, including factors considered inpromulgating the guideline or reasons underlying promulgation of the guideline." USSG $ 1B1.7.508us1$66Z 02-13-97 13:36:06 PAGES OPINPGT42 STINSON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtAs we have observed, "the Guidelines bind judges andcourts in the exercise of their uncontested responsibilityto pass sentence in criminal cases." Mistretta v. UnitedStates, supra, at 391. See also Burns v. United States, 501U. S. 129, 133 (1991). The most obvious operation of thisprinciple is with respect to the Guidelines themselves. TheSentencing Reform Act provides that, unless the sentencingcourt finds an aggravating or mitigating factor of a kind, orto a degree, not given adequate consideration by the Commission, a circumstance not applicable in this case, "[t]hecourt shall impose a sentence of the kind, and within therange," established by the applicable guidelines. 18 U. S. C.$$ 3553(a)(4), (b). The principle that the Guidelines Manualis binding on federal courts applies as well to policy statements. In Williams v. United States, 503 U. S. 193, 201(1992), we said that "[w]here . . . a policy statement prohibitsa district court from taking a specified action, the statementis an authoritative guide to the meaning of the applicableGuideline." There, the District Court had departed upwardfrom the Guidelines' sentencing range based on prior arreststhat did not result in criminal convictions. A policy statement, however, prohibited a court from basing a departureon a prior arrest record alone. USSG $ 4A1.3, p. s. Weheld that failure to follow the policy statement resulted in asentence "imposed as a result of an incorrect application ofthe sentencing guidelines" under 18 U. S. C. $ 3742(f)(1) thatshould be set aside on appeal unless the error was harmless.503 U. S., at 201, 203.In the case before us, the Court of Appeals determinedthat these principles do not apply to commentary. 957 F. 2d,at 814-815. Its conclusion that the commentary now beingconsidered is not binding on the courts was error. The commentary added by Amendment 433 was interpretive andexplanatory of the Guideline defining "crime of violence."Commentary which functions to "interpret [a] guideline orexplain how it is to be applied," USSG $ 1B1.7, controls, and508us1$66Z 02-13-97 13:36:06 PAGES OPINPGT43Cite as: 508 U. S. 36 (1993)Opinion of the Courtif failure to follow, or a misreading of, such commentaryresults in a sentence "select[ed] . . . from the wrong guideline range," Williams v. United States, supra, at 203, thatsentence would constitute "an incorrect application of thesentencing guidelines" under 18 U. S. C. $ 3742(f )(1). AGuideline itself makes this proposition clear. See USSG$ 1B1.7 ("Failure to follow such commentary could constitutean incorrect application of the guidelines, subjecting the sen-tence to possible reversal on appeal"). Our holding inWilliams dealing with policy statements applies with equalforce to the commentary before us here. Cf. USSG $ 1B1.7(commentary regarding departures from the Guidelinesshould be "treated as the legal equivalent of a policy statement"); $ 1B1.7, comment. ("Portions of [the Guidelines Manual] not labeled as guidelines or commentary . . . are to beconstrued as commentary and thus have the force of policystatements").It does not follow that commentary is binding in all instances. If, for example, commentary and the guideline itinterprets are inconsistent in that following one will resultin violating the dictates of the other, the Sentencing ReformAct itself commands compliance with the guideline. See 18U. S. C. $$ 3553(a)(4), (b). Some courts have refused to follow commentary in situations falling short of such flat inconsistency. Thus, we articulate the standard that governs thedecision whether particular interpretive or explanatory commentary is binding.Different analogies have been suggested as helpful characterizations of the legal force of commentary. Some we reject. We do not think it helpful to treat commentary as acontemporaneous statement of intent by the drafters or issuers of the guideline, having a status similar to that of, forexample, legislative committee reports or the advisory committee notes to the various federal rules of procedure andevidence. Quite apart from the usual difficulties of attributing meaning to a statutory or regulatory command by refer508us1$66Z 02-13-97 13:36:06 PAGES OPINPGT44 STINSON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtence to what other documents say about its proposers' initialintent, here, as is often true, the commentary was issued wellafter the guideline it interprets had been promulgated. Theguidelines of the Sentencing Commission, moreover, cannotbecome effective until after the 6-month review period forcongressional modification or disapproval. It seems incon-sistent with this process for the Commission to announcesome statement of initial intent well after the review processhas expired. To be sure, much commentary has been issuedat the same time as the guideline it interprets. But neitherthe Guidelines Manual nor the Sentencing Reform Act indicates that the weight accorded to, or the function of, commentary differs depending on whether it represents a contemporaneous or ex post interpretation.We also find inapposite an analogy to an agency's construction of a federal statute that it administers. Under ChevronU. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467U. S. 837 (1984), if a statute is unambiguous the statute governs; if, however, Congress' silence or ambiguity has "left agap for the agency to fill," courts must defer to the agency'sinterpretation so long as it is "a permissible construction ofthe statute." Id., at 842-843. Commentary, however, hasa function different from an agency's legislative rule. Commentary, unlike a legislative rule, is not the product of delegated authority for rulemaking, which of course must yieldto the clear meaning of a statute. Id., at 843, n. 9. Rather,commentary explains the guidelines and provides concreteguidance as to how even unambiguous guidelines are to beapplied in practice.Although the analogy is not precise because Congress hasa role in promulgating the guidelines, we think the Government is correct in suggesting that the commentary betreated as an agency's interpretation of its own legislativerule. Brief for United States 13-16. The Sentencing Commission promulgates the guidelines by virtue of an expresscongressional delegation of authority for rulemaking, see508us1$66Z 02-13-97 13:36:06 PAGES OPINPGT45Cite as: 508 U. S. 36 (1993)Opinion of the CourtMistretta v. United States, 488 U. S., at 371-379, and throughthe informal rulemaking procedures in 5 U. S. C. $ 553, see28 U. S. C. $ 994(x). Thus, the guidelines are the equivalentof legislative rules adopted by federal agencies. The functional purpose of commentary (of the kind at issue here) isto assist in the interpretation and application of those rules,which are within the Commission's particular area of concernand expertise and which the Commission itself has the firstresponsibility to formulate and announce. In these respectsthis type of commentary is akin to an agency's interpretationof its own legislative rules. As we have often stated, provided an agency's interpretation of its own regulations doesnot violate the Constitution or a federal statute, it must begiven "controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous orinconsistent with the regulation." Bowles v. SeminoleRock & Sand Co., 325 U. S. 410, 414 (1945). See, e. g., Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U. S. 332, 359(1989); Lyng v. Payne, 476 U. S. 926, 939 (1986); UnitedStates v. Larionoff, 431 U. S. 864, 872-873 (1977); Udall v.Tallman, 380 U. S. 1, 16-17 (1965). See also 2 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise $ 7:22, pp. 105-107 (2d ed. 1979).According this measure of controlling authority to thecommentary is consistent with the role the Sentencing Reform Act contemplates for the Sentencing Commission. TheCommission, after all, drafts the guidelines as well as thecommentary interpreting them, so we can presume that theinterpretations of the guidelines contained in the commentary represent the most accurate indications of how the Commission deems that the guidelines should be applied to beconsistent with the Guidelines Manual as a whole as well asthe authorizing statute. The Commission has the statutoryobligation "periodically [to] review and revise" the guidelinesin light of its consultation with authorities on and representatives of the federal criminal justice system. See 28U. S. C. $ 994(o). The Commission also must "revie[w] thepresentence report, the guideline worksheets, the tribunal's508us1$66Z 02-13-97 13:36:06 PAGES OPINPGT46 STINSON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtsentencing statement, and any written plea agreement,"Mistretta v. United States, supra, at 369-370, with respectto every federal criminal sentence. See 28 U. S. C. $ 994(w).In assigning these functions to the Commission, "Congressnecessarily contemplated that the Commission would periodically review the work of the courts, and would make what-ever clarifying revisions to the Guidelines conflicting judicialdecisions might suggest." Braxton v. United States, 500U. S. 344, 348 (1991). Although amendments to guidelinesprovisions are one method of incorporating revisions, an-other method open to the Commission is amendment of thecommentary, if the guideline which the commentary inter-prets will bear the construction. Amended commentary isbinding on the federal courts even though it is not reviewedby Congress, and prior judicial constructions of a particularguideline cannot prevent the Commission from adopting aconflicting interpretation that satisfies the standard we setforth today.It is perhaps ironic that the Sentencing Commission's owncommentary fails to recognize the full significance of interpretive and explanatory commentary. The commentary tothe Guideline on commentary provides:"[I]n seeking to understand the meaning of the guidelines courts likely will look to the commentary for guidance as an indication of the intent of those who wrotethem. In such instances, the courts will treat the commentary much like legislative history or other legal material that helps determine the intent of a drafter."USSG $ 1B1.7, comment.We note that this discussion is phrased in predictive terms.To the extent that this commentary has prescriptive content,we think its exposition of the role of interpretive and explanatory commentary is inconsistent with the uses to which theCommission in practice has put such commentary and the508us1$66Z 02-13-97 13:36:06 PAGES OPINPGT47Cite as: 508 U. S. 36 (1993)Opinion of the Courtcommand in $ 1B1.7 that failure to follow interpretive andexplanatory commentary could result in reversible error.We now apply these principles to Amendment 433. Werecognize that the exclusion of the felon-in-possession offense from the definition of "crime of violence" may not becompelled by the guideline text. Nonetheless, Amendment433 does not run afoul of the Constitution or a federal statute, and it is not "plainly erroneous or inconsistent" with$ 4B1.2, Bowles v. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., supra, at 414.As a result, the commentary is a binding interpretation ofthe phrase "crime of violence." Federal courts may not usethe felon-in-possession offense as the predicate crime of violence for purposes of imposing the career offender provisionof USSG $ 4B1.1 as to those defendants to whom Amendment433 applies.The Government agrees that the Court of Appeals erredin concluding that commentary is not binding on the federalcourts and in ruling that Amendment 433 is not of controllingweight. See Brief for United States 11-19. It suggests,however, that we should affirm the judgment on an alternative ground. It argues that petitioner's sentence conformedwith the Guidelines Manual in effect when he was sentenced,id., at 22-29, and that the sentence may not be reversed onappeal based upon a postsentence amendment to the provisions in the Manual, id., at 19-22. The Government claimsthat petitioner's only recourse is to file a motion in DistrictCourt for resentencing, pursuant to 18 U. S. C. $ 3582(c)(2).Brief for United States 33-35. It notes that after the Courtof Appeals denied rehearing in this case, the SentencingCommission amended USSG $ 1B1.10(d), p. s., to indicate thatAmendment 433 may be given retroactive effect under$ 3582(c)(2). See Amendment 469, USSG App. C, p. 296(Nov. 1992).We decline to address this argument. In refusing to upsetpetitioner's sentence, the Court of Appeals did not consider508us1$66Z 02-13-97 13:36:06 PAGES OPINPGT48 STINSON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtthe nonretroactivity theory here advanced by the Govern-ment; its refusal to vacate the sentence was based only onits view that commentary did not bind it. This issue, more-over, is not "fairly included" in the question we formulatedin the grant of certiorari, see 506 U. S. 972 (1992). Cf. thisCourt's Rule 14.1(a). We leave the contentions of the parties on this aspect of the case to be addressed by the Courtof Appeals on remand.The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals forthe Eleventh Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded forfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.
