ENTERGY OPERATIONS, INC.Opinion of the Courtation, she received severance pay in installments. The re-lease, however, did not comply with specific federal statutoryrequirements for a release of claims under the Age Discrimi-nation in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 81 Stat. 602, 29U. S. C. $ 621 et seq. After receiving the last payment, theemployee brought suit under the ADEA. The employerclaims the employee ratified and validated the nonconform-ing release by retaining the moneys paid to secure it. Theemployer also insists the release bars the action unless, as aprecondition to filing suit, the employee tenders back themoneys received. We disagree and rule that, as the releasedid not comply with the statute, it cannot bar the ADEAclaim. IPetitioner Dolores Oubre worked as a scheduler at a powerplant in Killona, Louisiana, run by her employer, respondentEntergy Operations, Inc. In 1994, she received a poor per-formance rating. Oubre's supervisor met with her on January 17, 1995, and gave her the option of either improving herperformance during the coming year or accepting a voluntary arrangement for her severance. She received a packetof information about the severance agreement and had 14days to consider her options, during which she consultedwith attorneys. On January 31, Oubre decided to accept.She signed a release, in which she "agree[d] to waive, settle,release, and discharge any and all claims, demands, damages,actions, or causes of action . . . that I may have against En-tergy . . . ." App. 61. In exchange, she received six installment payments over the next four months, totaling $6,258.The Older Workers Benefit Protection Act (OWBPA) imposes specific requirements for releases covering ADEAclaims. OWBPA, $ 201, 104 Stat. 983, 29 U. S. C. $$ 626(f)(1)(B), (F), (G). In procuring the release, Entergy did not com-ply with the OWBPA in at least three respects: (1) Entergydid not give Oubre enough time to consider her options.(2) Entergy did not give Oubre seven days after she signed522US2 Unit: $U23 [01-28-00 16:52:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN425Cite as: 522 U. S. 422 (1998)Opinion of the Courtthe release to change her mind. And (3) the release madeno specific reference to claims under the ADEA.Oubre filed a charge of age discrimination with the EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission, which dismissed hercharge on the merits but issued a right-to-sue letter. Shefiled this suit against Entergy in the United States DistrictCourt for the Eastern District of Louisiana, alleging con-structive discharge on the basis of her age in violation of theADEA and state law. Oubre has not offered or tried to re-turn the $6,258 to Entergy, nor is it clear she has the meansto do so. Entergy moved for summary judgment, claimingOubre had ratified the defective release by failing to returnor offer to return the moneys she had received. The Dis-trict Court agreed and entered summary judgment for Entergy. The Court of Appeals affirmed, 112 F. 3d 787 (CA51996) (per curiam), and we granted certiorari, 520 U. S.1185 (1997). IIThe employer rests its case upon general principles ofstate contract jurisprudence. As the employer recites therule, contracts tainted by mistake, duress, or even fraud arevoidable at the option of the innocent party. See 1 Restatement (Second) of Contracts $ 7, and Comment b (1979); e. g.,Ellerin v. Fairfax Sav. Assn., 78 Md. App. 92, 108-109, 552A. 2d 918, 926-927 (Md. Spec. App.), cert. denied, 316 Md.210, 557 A. 2d 1336 (1989). The employer maintains, how-ever, that before the innocent party can elect avoidance, shemust first tender back any benefits received under the con-tract. See, e. g., Dreiling v. Home State Life Ins. Co., 213Kan. 137, 147-148, 515 P. 2d 757, 766-767 (1973). If she failsto do so within a reasonable time after learning of her rights,the employer contends, she ratifies the contract and so makesit binding. 1 Restatement (Second) of Contracts,supra,$ 7, Comments d, e; see, e. g., Jobe v. Texas Util. Elec. Co.,No. 05-94-01368-CV, 1995 WL 479645, *3 (Tex. App.-Dallas,Aug. 14, 1995) (unpublished). The employer also invokes the522US2 Unit: $U23 [01-28-00 16:52:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN426 OUBRE v. ENTERGY OPERATIONS, INC.Opinion of the Courtdoctrine of equitable estoppel. As a rule, equitable estoppelbars a party from shirking the burdens of a voidable transaction for as long as she retains the benefits received under it.See,e. g., Buffum v. Peter Barceloux Co., 289 U. S. 227, 234(1933) (citing state case law from Indiana and New York).Applying these principles, the employer claims the employeeratified the ineffective release (or faces estoppel) by retaining all the sums paid in consideration of it. The employer,then, relies not upon the execution of the release but upon alater, distinct ratification of its terms.These general rules may not be as unified as the employerasserts. See generally Annot., 76 A. L. R. 344 (1932) (collecting cases supporting and contradicting these rules);Annot., 134 A. L. R. 6 (1941) (same). And in equity, a personsuing to rescind a contract, as a rule, is not required to restore the consideration at the very outset of the litigation.See 3 Restatement (Second) of Contracts, supra, $ 384, andComment b; Restatement of Restitution $ 65, Comment d(1936); D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies $ 4.8, p. 294 (1973). Evenif the employer's statement of the general rule requiringtender back before one files suit were correct, it would beunavailing. The rule cited is based simply on the course ofnegotiation of the parties and the alleged later ratification.The authorities cited do not consider the question raised bystatutory standards for releases and a statutory declarationmaking nonconforming releases ineffective. It is the latterquestion we confront here.In 1990, Congress amended the ADEA by passing theOWBPA. The OWBPA provides: "An individual may notwaive any right or claim under [the ADEA] unless thewaiver is knowing and voluntary. . . . [A] waiver may not beconsidered knowing and voluntary unless at a minimum" itsatisfies certain enumerated requirements, including thethree listed above. 29 U. S. C. $ 626(f)(1).The statutory command is clear: An employee "may notwaive" an ADEA claim unless the waiver or release satisfies522US2 Unit: $U23 [01-28-00 16:52:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN427Cite as: 522 U. S. 422 (1998)Opinion of the Courtthe OWBPA's requirements. The policy of the OWBPA islikewise clear from its title: It is designed to protect therights and benefits of older workers. The OWBPA imple-ments Congress' policy via a strict, unqualified statutorystricture on waivers, and we are bound to take Congress atits word. Congress imposed specific duties on employerswho seek releases of certain claims created by statute. Congress delineated these duties with precision and withoutqualification: An employee "may not waive" an ADEA claimunless the employer complies with the statute. Courts can-not with ease presume ratification of that which Congressforbids.The OWBPA sets up its own regime for assessing the effect of ADEA waivers, separate and apart from contract law.The statute creates a series of prerequisites for knowing andvoluntary waivers and imposes affirmative duties of disclosure and waiting periods. The OWBPA governs the effectunder federal law of waivers or releases on ADEA claimsand incorporates no exceptions or qualifications. The textof the OWBPA forecloses the employer's defense, notwithstanding how general contract principles would apply tonon-ADEA claims.The rule proposed by the employer would frustrate thestatute's practical operation as well as its formal command.In many instances a discharged employee likely will havespent the moneys received and will lack the means to tendertheir return. These realities might tempt employers to risknoncompliance with the OWBPA's waiver provisions, knowing it will be difficult to repay the moneys and relying onratification. We ought not to open the door to an evasion ofthe statute by this device.Oubre's cause of action arises under the ADEA, and therelease can have no effect on her ADEA claim unless it complies with the OWBPA. In this case, both sides concede therelease the employee signed did not comply with the requirements of the OWBPA. Since Oubre's release did not comply522US2 Unit: $U23 [01-28-00 16:52:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN428 OUBRE v. ENTERGY OPERATIONS, INC.Appendix to opinion of the Courtwith the OWBPA's stringent safeguards, it is unenforceableagainst her insofar as it purports to waive or release herADEA claim. As a statutory matter, the release cannot barher ADEA suit, irrespective of the validity of the contractas to other claims.In further proceedings in this or other cases, courts mayneed to inquire whether the employer has claims for restitu-tion, recoupment, or setoff against the employee, and thesequestions may be complex where a release is effective as tosome claims but not as to ADEA claims. We need not decide those issues here, however. It suffices to hold that therelease cannot bar the ADEA claim because it does not conform to the statute. Nor did the employee's mere retentionof moneys amount to a ratification equivalent to a valid release of her ADEA claims, since the retention did not complywith the OWBPA any more than the original release did.The statute governs the effect of the release on ADEAclaims, and the employer cannot invoke the employee's failure to tender back as a way of excusing its own failure tocomply.We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and re-mand the case for further proceedings consistent with thisopinion.
