Section 330(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U. S. C.$ 330(a)(1), regulates court awards of professional fees, including fees for services rendered by attorneys in connectionwith bankruptcy proceedings. Petitioner, a bankruptcy attorney, sought compensation under the section for legal serv-ices he provided to a bankrupt debtor after the proceedingwas converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. His applicationfor fees was denied by the Bankruptcy Court, the DistrictCourt, and the United States Court of Appeals for theFourth Circuit. Each court held that in a Chapter 7 proceeding $ 330(a)(1) does not authorize payment of attorney'sfees unless the attorney has been appointed under $ 327 ofthe Code. See 11 U. S. C. $$ 327 and 701 et seq. Petitionerwas not so appointed, and his fee request was denied. Having granted the petition for certiorari to review this holding,we now affirm.IIn 1994 Congress amended the Bankruptcy Code. Bank-ruptcy Reform Act of 1994 (Act), 108 Stat. 4106. The subject of professional fees was addressed and comprehen-sive changes were made. See 3 Collier on Bankruptcy|| 330.LH[5], pp. 330-75 to 330-76 (rev. 15th ed. 2003). Mostof the changes served to clarify the standards for the awardof professional fees; but various courts disagree over theproper interpretation of the portion of the statute relevantto this dispute, concerning attorney's fees.The Act replaced the predecessor section to the one inissue here. Compare 108 Stat. 4130-4131 ($ 224(b) of theAct amending 11 U. S. C. $ 330(a)) with 11 U. S. C. $ 330(a)(1988 ed.).

(emphasis added to highlight text later deleted).Pursuant to the 1994 Act, 11 U. S. C. $ 330(a)(1) now readsas follows:"(a)(1) After notice to the parties in interest and theUnited States Trustee and a hearing, and subject to sections 326, 328, and 329, the court may award to a trustee,an examiner, a professional person employed under section 327 or 1103--"(A) reasonable compensation for actual, necessaryservices rendered by the trustee, examiner, professionalperson, or attorney and by any paraprofessional personemployed by any such person; and"(B) reimbursement for actual, necessary expenses."As can be noted, the 1994 enactment's principal, substantivealteration was its deletion of the five words at the end ofwhat was $ 330(a) and is now $ 330(a)(1): "or to the debtor'sattorney."The deletion created an apparent legislative drafting error.It left current $ 330(a)(1) with a missing "or" that infects itsgrammar (i. e., "an examiner, [or] a professional person . . .").Furthermore, the Act's inclusion of the word "attorney" in$ 330(a)(1)(A) defeats the neat parallelism that otherwisemarks the relationship between $$ 330(a)(1) and 330(a)(1)(A)(i. e., in $ 330(a)(1): "trustee, . . . examiner, [or] professionalperson"; in $ 330(a)(1)(A): "trustee, examiner, professional540US2 Unit: $U17 [10-28-05 12:57:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN531Cite as: 540 U.

That the pre-1994 text had nogrammatical error and was parallel in its structure strength-ens the sense that error exists in the new text.The Courts of Appeals for the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits,when asked to interpret current $ 330(a)(1), concluded thatits language was plain irrespective of these quirks and history. Under the statutory language as written, those courtsheld, fees may be awarded to attorneys for services renderedonly to the extent they are payments to "a professional per-son employed under section 327," see,e. g., $ 327(a) (authorizing an appointed trustee in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy actionto "employ one or more attorneys . . . to represent or assistthe trustee in carrying out the trustee's duties under thistitle"); $ 327(e) (authorizing an appointed trustee in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy action to "employ, for a specified specialpurpose, other than to represent the trustee in conductingthe case, an attorney that has represented the debtor, . . .").See In re Pro-Snax Distributors, Inc., 157 F. 3d 414 (CA51998); In re American Steel Product, Inc., 197 F. 3d 1354(CA11 1999). The Courts of Appeals for the Second, Third,and Ninth Circuits, in contrast, concluded that the text's apparent errors rendered the section ambiguous, requiring consideration of the provision's legislative history. That history, those courts held, shows Congress intended $ 330(a)(1)to continue to allow compensation of Chapter 7 debtors'attorneys, irrespective of qualification under $ 327. In reAmes Dept. Stores, Inc., 76 F. 3d 66 (CA2 1996); In re TopGrade Sausage, Inc., 227 F. 3d 123 (CA3 2000); In re CenturyCleaning Services, Inc., 195 F. 3d 1053 (CA9 1999). See also3 Collier on Bankruptcy, supra, || 330.LH[5], at 330-75 to330-76.This interpretive divide became relevant to petitioner inhis representation of Equipment Services, Inc. (ESI). ESIretained petitioner to prepare, file, and prosecute a Chapter11 bankruptcy proceeding on its behalf. He did so, all the540US2 Unit: $U17 [10-28-05 12:57:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN532 LAMIE v. UNITED STATES TRUSTEEOpinion of the Courtwhile representing ESI with the approval of the court under$ 327. SeeIn re Equipment Services, Inc., 290 F. 3d 739,742 (CA4 2002) (case below). See also 11 U. S. C. $ 1107(a)(authorizing debtor-in-possession to exercise the statutoryrights and powers of an estate trustee, including to retaincounsel under $ 327). Three months into the Chapter 11reorganization, the United States Trustee (Government)filed a motion to convert the action into a Chapter 7 liquida-tion proceeding. The court granted the Government's motion and appointed an estate trustee pursuant to $ 701, 11U. S. C. $ 701(a). This terminated ESI's status as debtor-inpossession and so terminated petitioner's service under $ 327as an attorney for the debtor-in-possession. Yet petitionercontinued to provide legal services to ESI, the debtor, eventhough he did not have the trustee's authorization to do so.He prepared reports detailing debts incurred and propertyacquired since the initial filing; he amended asset schedules;and he appeared at a hearing on an adversary complaint.In due course petitioner filed an application seeking feesunder $ 330(a)(1) for the time he spent on ESI's behalf afterthe Chapter 7 conversion. The Government objected to theapplication. It argued that $ 330(a)(1) makes no provisionfor the estate to compensate an attorney not authorizedunder $ 327. The court agreed and denied the fees. In reEquipment Services, Inc., 253 B. R. 724 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Va.2000). (Petitioner was paid fees for the services he providedto ESI before conversion of the proceeding to Chapter 7 andwhen ESI was the debtor-in-possession. The parties do notcontest those fees.)Petitioner unsuccessfully sought reversal of the Bankruptcy Court's determination, first from the District Court,see In re Equipment Services, Inc., 260 B. R. 273 (WD Va.2001), then from the Court of Appeals, see 290 F. 3d 739(CA4 2002). Both courts concluded the plain language of$ 330(a)(1) controlled and that attorneys who provide services to debtors in Chapter 7 proceedings must be hired by540US2 Unit: $U17 [10-28-05 12:57:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN533Cite as: 540 U. S. 526 (2004)Opinion of the Courtthe trustee under $ 327 to be eligible for compensation. TheCourt of Appeals acknowledged that its holding deepenedthe divide among the various Circuits, but held fast to thestatute's plain language, "particularly because application ofthat plain language supports a reasonable interpretation ofthe Bankruptcy Code," id., at 745. We granted the petitionfor certiorari, 538 U. S. 905 (2003), and now resolve the issue.IIPetitioner argues that the existing statutory text is am-biguous and so requires us to consult legislative historyto determine whether Congress intended to allow fees forservices rendered by a debtor's attorney in a Chapter 7proceeding, where that attorney is not authorized under$ 327. He makes the case for ambiguity, for the most part,by comparing the present statute with its predecessor.Thus, he says the statute is ambiguous because subsection(A)'s "attorney" is "facially irreconcilable" with the section'sfirst part since"[e]ither Congress inadvertently omitted the `debtor'sattorney' from the `payees' list, on which the court ofappeals relied, or it inadvertently retained the referenceto the attorney in the latter, `payees' list." Brief forPetitioner 17.Similarly, with respect to the missing conjunction "or" hesays,"[t]here is no apparent reason, other than a draftingerror, that Congress would have rewritten the statuteto produce a grammatically incorrect provision." Ibid.This is the analysis followed by the Courts of Appeals thathold the statute is ambiguous. SeeIn re Top Grade Sau-sage, supra, at 129 (noting in its search for ambiguity that"[p]rior to amendment, it was undisputed that the repetitionof officers in $ 330(a)(1)(A) was meant to parallel the officers540US2 Unit: $U17 [10-28-05 12:57:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN534 LAMIE v. UNITED STATES TRUSTEEOpinion of the Courtpreviously listed in $ 330(a)(1)"); see also In re CenturyCleaning Services, 195 F. 3d, at 1057-1058 (engaging in sameresort to previous enactment to inquire as to the currenttext's ambiguity). One determines ambiguity, under thiscontention, by relying on the grammatical soundness of theprior statute. That contention is wrong.The starting point in discerning congressional intent is theexisting statutory text, seeHughes Aircraft Co. v. Jacobson,525 U. S. 432, 438 (1999), and not the predecessor statutes.It is well established that "when the statute's language isplain, the sole function of the courts--at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd--is to enforce itaccording to its terms." Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v.Union Planters Bank, N. A., 530 U. S. 1, 6 (2000) (internalquotation marks omitted) (quoting United States v. Ron PairEnterprises, Inc., 489 U. S. 235, 241 (1989), in turn quotingCaminetti v. United States, 242 U. S. 470, 485 (1917)). Sowe begin with the present statute.AThe statute is awkward, and even ungrammatical; but thatdoes not make it ambiguous on the point at issue. In itsfirst part, the statute authorizes an award of compensationto one of three types of persons: trustees, examiners, and$ 327 professional persons. A debtor's attorney not engagedas provided by $ 327 is simply not included within the classof persons eligible for compensation. In subsection (A) thestatute further defines what type of compensation may beawarded: compensation that is reasonable; and for actual,necessary services; and rendered by four types of persons(the same three plus attorneys). Unless the applicant forcompensation is in one of the named classes of persons in thefirst part, the kind of service rendered is irrelevant.The missing conjunction "or" does not change our conclusion. The Government points to numerous federal statutesthat inadvertently lack a conjunction. They are read, none540US2 Unit: $U17 [10-28-05 12:57:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN535Cite as: 540 U. S. 526 (2004)Opinion of the Courttheless, for their plain meaning. See Brief for Respondent17, n. 4. Here, the missing conjunction neither alters thetext's substance nor obscures its meaning. This is not a casewhere a "not" is missing or where an "or" inadvertently substitutes for an "and." The sentence may be awkward; yet itis straightforward.Subsection (A)'s nonparalleled fourth category of personswho can render compensable services does not cloud the statute's meaning. Petitioner reasons that since the section is asingle sentence, and since it appears to strive for parallelismbetween those authorized to receive fees and those whoseservices are compensable, there is an ambiguity as to what"attorney" in $ 330(a)(1)(A) refers to in $ 330(a)(1). He alsopoints to neighboring $ 331, which provides for both debtors'attorneys and $ 327 professional persons to receive interimcompensation after an order for relief is entered but beforean application for $ 330 fees is filed. He argues that since$ 331 contemplates debtors' attorneys' receiving interimcompensation there is reason to conclude that "attorney"in $ 330(a)(1)(A) refers to debtors' attorneys in $ 330(a)(1),though they go unmentioned in that clause.Subsection (A)'s "attorney," however, can be read in astraightforward fashion to refer to those attorneys whosefees are authorized by $ 330(a)(1): attorneys qualified as $ 327professional persons, that is, in a Chapter 7 context, thoseemployed by the trustee and approved by the court. See$ 327(a) (appointed trustee may "employ one or more attorneys . . . to represent or assist the trustee in carrying outthe trustee's duties under this title); $ 327(e) (appointedtrustee may "employ, for a specified special purpose, otherthan to represent the trustee in conducting the case, an attorney that has represented the debtor, . . ."). Likewise,$ 331's reference to interim compensation for debtors' attorneys most straightforwardly refers to debtors' attorneys authorized under $ 327.540US2 Unit: $U17 [10-28-05 12:57:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN536 LAMIE v. UNITED STATES TRUSTEEOpinion of the CourtIt must be acknowledged that, under our reading of thetext, the word "attorney" in subsection (A) may well be surplusage. Subsection (A)'s reference to $ 327 professionalpersons undoubtedly includes attorneys, as much as does$ 330(a)(1)'s reference to professional persons. That is notcontrolling, however. Surplusage does not always produceambiguity and our preference for avoiding surplusage con-structions is not absolute. SeeChickasaw Nation v. UnitedStates, 534 U. S. 84, 94 (2001) (the preference "is sometimesoffset by the canon that permits a court to reject words `assurplusage' if `inadvertently inserted or if repugnant to therest of the statute' "). Where there are two ways to readthe text--either attorney is surplusage, in which case thetext is plain; or attorney is nonsurplusage (i. e., it refers toan ambiguous component in $ 330(a)(1)), in which case thetext is ambiguous--applying the rule against surplusage is,absent other indications, inappropriate. We should preferthe plain meaning since that approach respects the words ofCongress. In this manner we avoid the pitfalls that plaguetoo quick a turn to the more controversial realm of legisla-tive history.BThe plain meaning that $ 330(a)(1) sets forth does not leadto absurd results requiring us to treat the text as if it wereambiguous. See supra, at 534 (citing Hartford Underwrit-ers). Petitioner disagrees and argues that our interpretation will "entail an inexplicable, wholesale departure from. . . the guiding principle of the `prompt and effectual administration' of federal bankruptcy law." Brief for Petitioner30. He says that our reading "attribute[s] to Congress anillogical, penny-wise and pound-foolish determination toeliminate entirely--as a purportedly asset-preserving measure--compensation that is essential to debtors' receipt oflegal services." Id., at 35.These arguments overstate the effect of $ 330(a)(1). Un-der the text's instruction compensation remains available to540US2 Unit: $U17 [10-28-05 12:57:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN537Cite as: 540 U. S. 526 (2004)Opinion of the Courtdebtors' attorneys through various permitted means. First,while $ 330(a)(1) requires proper authorization for paymentto attorneys from estate funds in Chapter 7 filings, it doesnot extend throughout all bankruptcy law. Compensationfor debtors' attorneys in Chapter 12 and 13 bankruptcies,for example, is not much disturbed by $ 330 as a whole.See, e. g., 11 U. S. C. $ 330(a)(4)(B) ("In a chapter 12 orchapter 13 case in which the debtor is an individual, thecourt may allow reasonable compensation to the debtor'sattorney").Compensation for debtors' attorneys working on Chapter7 bankruptcies, moreover, is not altogether prohibited. Sections 327 and 330, taken together, allow Chapter 7 trusteesto engage attorneys, including debtors' counsel, and allowcourts to award them fees. See $$ 327(a) and (e). Section327's limitation on debtors' incurring debts for professionalservices without the Chapter 7 trustee's approval is not absurd. In the context of a Chapter 7 liquidation it advancesthe trustee's responsibility for preserving the estate.If we add to all this the apparent sound functioning ofthe bankruptcy system under the plain meaning approach,petitioner 's arguments become unconvincing. Seemingorder has attended the rule's application for five years in theFifth Circuit and for four years in the Eleventh Circuit. SeeIn re American Steel Product, Inc., 197 F. 3d 1354 (CA111999); In re Pro-Snax Distributors, Inc., 157 F. 3d 414 (CA51998). It appears to be routine for debtors to pay reasonable fees for legal services before filing for bankruptcy toensure compliance with statutory requirements. See generally Collier Compensation, Employment and Appointment ofTrustees and Professionals in Bankruptcy Cases || 3.02[1],p. 3-2 (2002) ("In the majority of cases, the debtor's counselwill accept an individual or a joint consumer chapter 7 caseonly after being paid a retainer that covers the `standard fee'and the cost of filing the petition"). So our interpretationaccords with common practice. Section 330(a)(1) does not540US2 Unit: $U17 [10-28-05 12:57:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN538 LAMIE v. UNITED STATES TRUSTEEOpinion of the Courtprevent a debtor from engaging counsel before a Chapter 7conversion and paying reasonable compensation in advanceto ensure that the filing is in order. Indeed, the Code antici-pates these arrangements. See, e. g., $ 329 (debtors' attorneys must disclose fees they receive from a debtor in theyear prior to its bankruptcy filing and courts may order excessive payments returned to the estate).CPetitioner's argument stumbles on still harder ground inthe face of another canon of interpretation. His interpretation of the Act--reading the word "attorney" in $ 330(a)(1)(A) to refer to "debtors' attorneys" in $ 330(a)(1)--wouldhave us read an absent word into the statute. That is, hisargument would result "not [in] a construction of [the] statute, but, in effect, an enlargement of it by the court, so thatwhat was omitted, presumably by inadvertence, may be included within its scope." Iselin v. United States, 270 U. S.245, 251 (1926). With a plain, nonabsurd meaning in view,we need not proceed in this way. "There is a basic differ-ence between filling a gap left by Congress' silence and rewriting rules that Congress has affirmatively and specificallyenacted." Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, 436 U. S. 618,625 (1978).Our unwillingness to soften the import of Congress' chosen words even if we believe the words lead to a harsh out-come is longstanding. It results from "deference to thesupremacy of the Legislature, as well as recognition thatCongressmen typically vote on the language of a bill."United States v. Locke, 471 U. S. 84, 95 (1985) (citing Richards v. United States, 369 U. S. 1, 9 (1962)).Adhering to conventional doctrines of statutory interpretation, we hold that $ 330(a)(1) does not authorize compensa-tion awards to debtors' attorneys from estate funds, unlessthey are employed as authorized by $ 327. If the attorneyis to be paid from estate funds under $ 330(a)(1) in a Chapter540US2 Unit: $U17 [10-28-05 12:57:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN539Cite as: 540 U. S. 526 (2004)Opinion of the Court7 case, he must be employed by the trustee and approved bythe court.IIIThough we find it unnecessary to rely on the legislativehistory behind the 1994 enactment of $ 330(a)(1), we find itinstructive that the history creates more confusion than clar-ity about the congressional intent. History and policy considerations lend support both to petitioner's interpretationand to the holding we reach based on the plain language ofthe statute.Petitioner, for instance, cites evidence supporting the conclusion that a scrivener's error obscures what was Congress'real intent. For over 100 years debtors' attorneys havebeen considered by Congress and the courts to be an integralpart of the bankruptcy process. See Bankruptcy Act of1898, ch. 541, $$ 59(d) and 64(b), 30 Stat. 561, 563. See alsoIn re Kross, 96 F. 816 (SDNY 1899). It is fair to doubt thatCongress would so rework their longstanding role with-out announcing the change in the congressional record.Cf. Cohen v. de la Cruz, 523 U. S. 213, 221 (1998) ("We . . .will not read the Bankruptcy Code to erode past bankruptcypractice absent a clear indication that Congress intendedsuch a departure" (internal quotation marks and citationomitted)).The legislative processes behind the change also lend somesupport to petitioner's claim. In 1994 the original proposeddraft of new $ 330(a)(1) featured two changes: stylisticchanges throughout the section and the addition of a newprovision giving the Government a right to object to feeapplications. See S. 540, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. (1993), re-printed in S. Rep. No. 103-168 (1993). The right to objectprovision was added at $ 330(a)(1)'s end. Thus it came im-mediately after the critical text "or to the debtor's attorney,"which the draft edited to read "or the debtors [sic] attor-ney."Ibid. Before voting the Act into law, however, Con-gress amended the proposed draft. See 140 Cong. Rec. 8383540US2 Unit: $U17 [10-28-05 12:57:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN540 LAMIE v. UNITED STATES TRUSTEEOpinion of the Court(1994) (setting out amendment 1645 to S. 540). Amendment1645 made only two changes to $ 330(a)(1): It deleted theGovernment's right to object provision and the critical words("or the debtors[sic] attorney"). The rest of the originalproposed draft remained intact. Legislative history ex-plains the first deletion, for the provision was installed elsewhere, as new $ 330(a)(2). Nothing, however, explains thesecond. That the Government's right to object was deletedand reinstated (i. e., reorganized), while the words at issue,which had preceded the moved provision, were deleted withno notation in the legislative history suggests the scrivenerjust reached too far in his deletion. These factors combinedto convince a leading treatise on bankruptcy law, Collier, thatthe deletion was a scrivener's error and ought not have anyeffect. See 3 Collier on Bankruptcy || 330.LH[5], at 330-75to 330-76.There are other aspects of the legislative record, however,that undermine this interpretation. These considerationssuggest Congress may have intended the change the scrivener worked. For example, amendment 1645 was part ofa reform Act designed to curtail abuses in fee awards, according to statements by the amendment's sponsor. See140 Cong. Rec., at 28753 (statement of Sen. Metzenbaum).These abuses were not ghosts seen only by Congress. Somebankruptcy courts had reached the same conclusion. See,e. g., In re NRG Resources, Inc., 64 B. R. 643 (Bkrtcy. Ct.WD La. 1986). The deletion at issue furthered this reformby ensuring that Chapter 7 debtors' attorneys would receiveno estate compensation absent the trustee's authorization oftheir work. This objective is not inconsistent with the interest of involving debtors' attorneys in bankruptcy proceedings. As noted, the Act still allows debtors' attorneys to becompensated in different ways. See supra, at 536-539.Amendment 1645, viewed in its entirety, gives further reason to think Congress may have intended the change. Theamendment added a new section that authorizes fee awards540US2 Unit: $U17 [10-28-05 12:57:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN541Cite as: 540 U. S. 526 (2004)Opinion of the Courtto debtors' attorneys in Chapter 12 and 13 bankruptcies.140 Cong. Rec., at 8383 (setting out new 11 U. S. C. $ 330(a)(4)(B)). Since the amendment's deletion of "or the debtors[sic] attorney" from the original proposed draft affectedChapter 12 and 13 debtors' attorneys as much as Chapter 7debtors' attorneys, $ 330(a)(4)(B) shows a special intent toauthorize the formers' fee awards in the face of the new,broad exclusion.If Congress' action does not prove the point, the House ofRepresentatives' inaction may. The House passed the Actafter having the deletion, as well as its impact, called to itsattention. See Bankruptcy Reform: Hearing before theSubcommittee on Economic and Commercial Law of theHouse Committee on the Judiciary, 103d Cong., 2d Sess., 551(1994). The National Association of Consumer BankruptcyAttorneys (NACBA), which represents those lawyers mostlikely to be affected by $ 330(a)(1)'s change, declined to objectto the deletion. Ibid. (noting the deletion but stating thatthe NACBA did "not oppose" amendment 1645's passage).This alert, followed by the Legislature's nonresponse, shouldsupport a presumption of legislative awareness and intention. The Act may now contain surplusage, along withgrammatical error; but that may have been the result of trying to make the substantive change with the fewest possibletextual alterations or of an error by the scrivener in carryingout the change.These competing interpretations of the legislative historymake it difficult to say with assurance whether petitioner orthe Government lays better historical claim to the congressional intent. The alert to the change in policy was given,to be sure, before the House passed the final version, butthat particular circumstance cannot bear too much weight.The alert was not the subject of testimony from any witnessat the congressional hearing. It consisted of but two sentences contained within 472 pages of written statements delivered to the legislative subcommittee for its August 17,540US2 Unit: $U17 [10-28-05 12:57:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN542 LAMIE v. UNITED STATES TRUSTEEStevens, J., concurring in judgment1994, hearing day. Those 472 pages were added to 236pages of prepared statements and testimony transcribedfrom the day's testifying witnesses. Within the NACBA'sfiling, the two relevant sentences appear on the 18th page ofthe 27-page report. Nothing in the legislative history confirms that this particular point bore on the congressional deliberations or was given specific consideration.These uncertainties illustrate the difficulty of relying onlegislative history here and the advantage of our determination to rest our holding on the statutory text.* * *If Congress enacted into law something different fromwhat it intended, then it should amend the statute to conform it to its intent. "It is beyond our province to rescueCongress from its drafting errors, and to provide for whatwe might think . . . is the preferred result." United Statesv. Granderson, 511 U. S. 39, 68 (1994) (concurring opinion).This allows both of our branches to adhere to our respected,and respective, constitutional roles. In the meantime, wemust determine intent from the statute before us. Thejudgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
