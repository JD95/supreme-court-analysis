It is well established that the Due Process Clause of theFourteenth Amendment prohibits the criminal prosecutionof a defendant who is not competent to stand trial. Dropev.Missouri, 420 U. S. 162 (1975); Pate v. Robinson, 383 U. S.375 (1966). The issue in this case is whether the Due Process Clause permits a State to require a defendant who al-leges incompetence to stand trial to bear the burden of proving so by a preponderance of the evidence.IIn 1984, petitioner Teofilo Medina, Jr., stole a gun from apawnshop in Santa Ana, California. In the weeks that followed, he held up two gas stations, a drive-in dairy, and amarket, murdered three employees of those establishments,attempted to rob a fourth employee, and shot at two passers-by who attempted to follow his getaway car. Petitioner wasapprehended less than one month after his crime spree*Edward M. Chikofsky and William J.

CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtbegan and was charged with a number of criminal offenses,including three counts of first-degree murder. Before trial,petitioner's counsel moved for a competency hearing underCal. Penal Code Ann. $ 1368 (West 1982), on the ground thathe was unsure whether petitioner had the ability to partici-pate in the criminal proceedings against him. 1 Record 320.Under California law, "[a] person cannot be tried or ad-judged to punishment while such person is mentally incompetent." Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 1367 (West 1982). A de-fendant is mentally incompetent "if, as a result of mentaldisorder or developmental disability, the defendant is unableto understand the nature of the criminal proceedings or toassist counsel in the conduct of a defense in a rational man-ner." Ibid. The statute establishes a presumption that thedefendant is competent, and the party claiming incompetencebears the burden of proving that the defendant is incompetent by a preponderance of the evidence. $ 1369(f) ("It shallbe presumed that the defendant is mentally competent unless it is proved by a preponderance of the evidence that thedefendant is mentally incompetent").The trial court granted the motion for a hearing and thepreliminary issue of petitioner's competence to stand trialwas tried to a jury. Over the course of the 6-day hearing,in addition to lay testimony, the jury heard conflicting experttestimony about petitioner's mental condition. The Su-preme Court of California gives this summary:"Dr. Gold, a psychiatrist who knew defendant whilehe was in the Arizona prison system, testified that defendant was a paranoid schizophrenic and was incompe-tent to assist his attorney at trial. Dr. Echeandia, aclinical psychologist at the Orange County jail, doubtedthe accuracy of the schizophrenia diagnosis, and couldnot express an opinion on defendant's competence tostand trial. Dr. Sharma, a psychiatrist, likewise expressed doubts regarding the schizophrenia diagnosisand leaned toward a finding of competence. Dr. Pierce,505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT441Cite as: 505 U. S. 437 (1992)Opinion of the Courta psychologist, believed defendant was schizophrenic,with impaired memory and hallucinations, but nevertheless was competent to stand trial. Dr. Sakurai, a jailpsychiatrist, opined that although defendant sufferedfrom depression, he was competent, and that he mayhave been malingering. Dr. Sheffield, who treated defendant for knife wounds he incurred in jail, could giveno opinion on the competency issue." 51 Cal. 3d 870,880, 799 P. 2d 1282, 1288 (1990).During the competency hearing, petitioner engaged in sev-eral verbal and physical outbursts. App. 62, 81-82; 3 Record 671, 699, 916. On one of these occasions, he overturnedthe counsel table. App. 81-82.The trial court instructed the jury in accordance with$ 1369(f) that "the defendant is presumed to be mentallycompetent and he has the burden of proving by a preponder-ance of the evidence that he is mentally incompetent as aresult of mental disorder or developmental disability." App.87. The jury found petitioner competent to stand trial.Id., at 89. A new jury was empaneled for the criminal trial,4 Record 1020, and petitioner entered pleas of not guilty andnot guilty by reason of insanity, 51 Cal. 3d, at 899, 799 P. 2d,at 1300. At the conclusion of the guilt phase, petitioner wasfound guilty of all three counts of first-degree murder and anumber of lesser offenses. Id., at 878-879, 799 P. 2d, at 1287.He moved to withdraw his insanity plea, and the trial courtgranted the motion. Two days later, however, petitionermoved to reinstate his insanity plea. Although his counselexpressed the view that reinstatement of the insanity pleawas "tactically unsound," the trial court granted petitioner'smotion.Id., at 899, 799 P. 2d, at 1300-1301. A sanity hear-ing was held, and the jury found that petitioner was sane atthe time of the offenses. At the penalty phase, the juryfound that the murders were premeditated and deliberateand returned a verdict of death. The trial court imposedthe death penalty for the murder convictions and sentenced505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT442 MEDINA v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtpetitioner to a prison term for the remaining offenses. Id.,at 878-880, 799 P. 2d, at 1287-1288.On direct appeal to the California Supreme Court, peti-tioner did not challenge the standard of proof set forth in$ 1369(f), but argued that the statute violated his right todue process by placing the burden of proof on him to establish that he was not competent to stand trial. In addition,he argued that $ 1369(f) violates due process by establishinga presumption that a defendant is competent to stand trialunless proven otherwise. The court rejected both of thesecontentions. Relying upon our decision in Leland v. Oregon,343 U. S. 790 (1952), which rejected a due process challengeto an Oregon statute that required a criminal defendant toprove the defense of insanity beyond a reasonable doubt, thecourt observed that "the states ordinarily have great lati-tude to decide the proper placement of proof burdens." 51Cal. 3d, at 884, 799 P. 2d, at 1291. In its view, $ 1369(f ) "doesnot subject the defendant to hardship or oppression," because "one might reasonably expect that the defendant andhis counsel would have better access than the People to thefacts relevant to the court's competency inquiry." Id., at885, 799 P. 2d, at 1291. The court also rejected petitioner'sargument that it is "irrational" to retain a presumption ofcompetence after sufficient doubt has arisen as to a defendant's competence to warrant a hearing and "decline[d] to holdas a matter of due process that such a presumption mustbe treated as a mere presumption affecting the burden ofproduction, which disappears merely because a preliminary,often undefined and indefinite, `doubt' has arisen that justi-fies further inquiry into the matter." Id., at 885, 799 P. 2d,at 1291-1292. We granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 924 (1991),and now affirm.IIPetitioner argues that our decision in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319 (1976), provides the proper analyticalframework for determining whether California's allocation of505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT443Cite as: 505 U. S. 437 (1992)Opinion of the Courtthe burden of proof in competency hearings comports withdue process. We disagree. InMathews, we articulated athree-factor test for evaluating procedural due processclaims which requires a court to consider"[f]irst, the private interest that will be affected by theofficial action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, andthe probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government's inter-est, including the function involved and the fiscal andadministrative burdens that the additional or substituteprocedural requirement would entail." Id., at 335.In our view, the Mathews balancing test does not providethe appropriate framework for assessing the validity of stateprocedural rules which, like the one at bar, are part of thecriminal process. E. g., People v. Fields, 62 Cal. 2d 538, 542,399 P. 2d 369, 371 (competency hearing "must be regardedas part of the proceedings in the criminal case") (internalquotation marks omitted), cert. denied, 382 U. S. 858 (1965).In the field of criminal law, we "have defined the categoryof infractions that violate `fundamental fairness' very narrowly" based on the recognition that, "[b]eyond the specificguarantees enumerated in the Bill of Rights, the Due Process Clause has limited operation." Dowling v. UnitedStates, 493 U. S. 342, 352 (1990); accord, United States v. Lovasco, 431 U. S. 783, 790 (1977). The Bill of Rights speaksin explicit terms to many aspects of criminal procedure, andthe expansion of those constitutional guarantees under theopen-ended rubric of the Due Process Clause invites undueinterference with both considered legislative judgments andthe careful balance that the Constitution strikes between liberty and order. As we said in Spencer v. Texas, 385 U. S.554, 564 (1967), "it has never been thought that [decisionsunder the Due Process Clause] establish this Court as a rulemaking organ for the promulgation of state rules of criminal505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT444 MEDINA v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtprocedure." Accord, Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 70(1991);Marshall v. Lonberger, 459 U. S. 422, 438, n. 6 (1983).Mathews itself involved a due process challenge to the ade-quacy of administrative procedures established for the purpose of terminating Social Security disability benefits, andthe Mathews balancing test was first conceived to addressdue process claims arising in the context of administrativelaw. Although we have since characterized the Mathewsbalancing test as "a general approach for testing challengedstate procedures under a due process claim," Parham v.J. R., 442 U. S. 584, 599 (1979), and applied it in a variety of contexts, e. g., Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U. S. 745(1982) (standard of proof for termination of parental rightsover objection); Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418 (1979)(standard of proof for involuntary civil commitment to mental hospital for indefinite period), we have invoked Mathewsin resolving due process claims in criminal law cases on onlytwo occasions.In United States v. Raddatz, 447 U. S. 667 (1980), we citedto the Mathews balancing test in rejecting a due processchallenge to a provision of the Federal Magistrates Actwhich authorized magistrates to make findings and recommendations on motions to suppress evidence. In Ake v.Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68 (1985), we relied upon Mathews inholding that, when an indigent capital defendant has made apreliminary showing that his sanity at the time of the offenseis likely to be a significant factor at trial, due process requires that the defendant be provided access to the assistance of a psychiatrist. Without disturbing the holdings ofRaddatz and Ake, it is not at all clear that Mathews wasessential to the results reached in those cases. In Raddatz,supra, at 677-681, the Court adverted to the Mathews balancing test, but did not explicitly rely upon it in conductingthe due process analysis. Raddatz, supra, at 700 (Marshall,J., dissenting) ("The Court recites th[e] test, but it does noteven attempt to apply it"). The holding in Ake can be un505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT445Cite as: 505 U. S. 437 (1992)Opinion of the Courtderstood as an expansion of earlier due process cases holdingthat an indigent criminal defendant is entitled to the minimum assistance necessary to assure him "a fair opportunityto present his defense" and "to participate meaningfully in[the] judicial proceeding." Ake, supra, at 76.The proper analytical approach, and the one that we adopthere, is that set forth inPatterson v. New York, 432 U. S.197 (1977), which was decided one year after Mathews. InPatterson, we rejected a due process challenge to a NewYork law which placed on a criminal defendant the burdenof proving the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance. Rather than relying upon the Mathews balancingtest, however, we reasoned that a narrower inquiry wasmore appropriate:"It goes without saying that preventing and dealingwith crime is much more the business of the States thanit is of the Federal Government,Irvine v. California,347 U. S. 128, 134 (1954) (plurality opinion), and that weshould not lightly construe the Constitution so as to in-trude upon the administration of justice by the individual States. Among other things, it is normally `withinthe power of the State to regulate procedures underwhich its laws are carried out, including the burden ofproducing evidence and the burden of persuasion,' andits decision in this regard is not subject to proscriptionunder the Due Process Clause unless `it offends someprinciple of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.'Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513, 523 (1958); Leland v.Oregon, 343 U. S. 790, 798 (1952); Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97, 105 (1934)." Patterson v. New York,supra, at 201-202.Accord, Martin v. Ohio, 480 U. S. 228, 232 (1987). As Patterson suggests, because the States have considerable expertisein matters of criminal procedure and the criminal process is505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT446 MEDINA v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtgrounded in centuries of common-law tradition, it is appro-priate to exercise substantial deference to legislative judgments in this area. The analytical approach endorsed inPatterson is thus far less intrusive than that approved inMathews.Based on our review of the historical treatment of the bur-den of proof in competency proceedings, the operation of thechallenged rule, and our precedents, we cannot say that theallocation of the burden of proof to a criminal defendant toprove incompetence "offends some principle of justice sorooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to beranked as fundamental." Patterson v. New York, supra, at202 (internal quotation marks omitted). Historical practiceis probative of whether a procedural rule can be characterized as fundamental. See 432 U. S., at 202; In re Winship,397 U. S. 358, 361 (1970). The rule that a criminal defendantwho is incompetent should not be required to stand trial hasdeep roots in our common-law heritage. Blackstone acknowledged that a defendant "who became `mad' after thecommission of an offense should not be arraigned for it `because he is not able to plead to it with that advice and cautionthat he ought,' " and "if he became `mad' after pleading, heshould not be tried, `for how can he make his defense?' "Drope v. Missouri, 420 U. S., at 171 (quoting 4 W. Blackstone,Commentaries *24); accord, 1 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown*34-*35.By contrast, there is no settled tradition on the properallocation of the burden of proof in a proceeding to determinecompetence. Petitioner concedes that "[t]he common lawrule on this issue at the time the Constitution was adopted isnot entirely clear." Brief for Petitioner 36. Early Englishauthorities either express no view on the subject, e. g.,Firth's Case (1790), 22 Howell St. Tr. 307, 311, 317-318 (1817);Kinloch's Case (1746), 18 Howell St. Tr. 395, 411 (1813), orare ambiguous. E. g., King v. Steel, 1 Leach 452, 168 Eng.Rep. 328 (1787) (stating that, once a jury had determined505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT447Cite as: 505 U. S. 437 (1992)Opinion of the Courtthat the defendant was "mute by the visitation of God" (i. e.,deaf and dumb) and not "mute of malice," there arose a "presumption of ideotism" that the prosecution could rebut bydemonstrating that the defendant had the capacity "to understand by signs and tokens").Nineteenth century English decisions do not take a con-sistent position on the allocation of the burden of proof. Compare R. v. Turton, 6 Cox C. C. 385 (1854) (burden on defend-ant), withR. v. Davies, 3 Carrington & Kirwan 328, 175 Eng.Rep. 575 (1853) (burden on prosecution); see generally R. v.Podola, 43 Crim. App. 220, 235-236, 3 All E. R. 418, 429-430(1959) (collecting conflicting cases). American decisions dating from the turn of the century also express divergentviews on the subject. E. g., United States v. Chisolm, 149F. 284, 290 (SD Ala. 1906) (defendant bears burden of raisinga reasonable doubt as to competence); State v. Helm, 69 Ark.167, 170-171, 61 S. W. 915, 916 (1901) (burden on defendantto prove incompetence).Contemporary practice, while of limited relevance to thedue process inquiry, see Martin v. Ohio, supra, at 236; Patterson v. New York, supra, at 211, demonstrates that thereremains no settled view of where the burden of proof shouldlie. The Federal Government and all 50 States haveadopted procedures that address the issue of a defendant'scompetence to stand trial. See 18 U. S. C. $ 4241; S. Brakel,J. Parry, & B. Weiner, The Mentally Disabled and the Law,Table 12.1, pp. 744-754 (3d ed. 1985). Some States have enacted statutes that, like $ 1369(f), place the burden of proofon the party raising the issue. E. g., Conn. Gen. Stat. $ 54-56d(b) (1991); Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 50, $ 7403(a) (Purdon Supp.1991). A number of state courts have said that the burdenof proof may be placed on the defendant to prove incompetence. E. g., Wallace v. State, 248 Ga. 255, 258-259, 282 S. E.2d 325, 330 (1981), cert. denied, 455 U. S. 927 (1982); State v.Aumann, 265 N. W. 2d 316, 319-320 (Iowa 1978); State v.Chapman, 104 N. M. 324, 327-328, 721 P. 2d 392, 395-396505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT448 MEDINA v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Court(1986); Barber v. State, 757 S. W. 2d 359, 362-363 (Tex. Crim.App. 1988) (en banc), cert. denied, 489 U. S. 1091 (1989).Still other state courts have said that the burden rests withthe prosecution.E. g., Diaz v. State, 508 A. 2d 861, 863-864(Del. 1986); Commonwealth v. Crowley, 393 Mass. 393, 400-401, 471 N. E. 2d 353, 357-358 (1984); State v. Bertrand, 123N. H. 719, 727-728, 465 A. 2d 912, 916 (1983);State v. Jones,406 N. W. 2d 366, 369-370 (S. D. 1987).Discerning no historical basis for concluding that the allocation of the burden of proving incompetence to the defend-ant violates due process, we turn to consider whether therule transgresses any recognized principle of "fundamentalfairness" in operation. Dowling v. United States, 493 U. S.,at 352. Respondent argues that our decision in Leland v.Oregon, 343 U. S. 790 (1952), which upheld the right of theState to place on a defendant the burden of proving the defense of insanity beyond a reasonable doubt, compels the conclusion that $ 1369(f ) is constitutional because, like a findingof insanity, a finding of incompetence has no necessary relationship to the elements of a crime, on which the State bearsthe burden of proof. See also Rivera v. Delaware, 429 U. S.877 (1976). This analogy is not convincing, because thereare significant differences between a claim of incompetenceand a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. See Drope v.Missouri, supra, at 176-177; Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U. S.715, 739 (1972).In a competency hearing, the "emphasis is on [the defendant's] capacity to consult with counsel and to comprehend theproceedings, and . . . this is by no means the same test asthose which determine criminal responsibility at the time ofthe crime." Pate v. Robinson, 383 U. S., at 388-389 (Harlan,J., dissenting). If a defendant is incompetent, due processconsiderations require suspension of the criminal trial untilsuch time, if any, that the defendant regains the capacity toparticipate in his defense and understand the proceedingsagainst him. See Dusky v. United States, 362 U. S. 402505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:36 PAGES OPINPGT449Cite as: 505 U. S. 437 (1992)Opinion of the Court(1960) (per curiam). The entry of a plea of not guilty byreason of insanity, by contrast, presupposes that the defendant is competent to stand trial and to enter a plea. More-over, while the Due Process Clause affords an incompetentdefendant the right not to be tried, Drope v. Missouri,supra, at 172-173; Pate v. Robinson, supra, at 386, we havenot said that the Constitution requires the States to recognize the insanity defense. See, e. g., Powell v. Texas, 392U. S. 514, 536-537 (1968).Under California law, the allocation of the burden of proofto the defendant will affect competency determinations onlyin a narrow class of cases where the evidence is in equipoise;that is, where the evidence that a defendant is competent isjust as strong as the evidence that he is incompetent. SeeUnited States v. DiGilio, 538 F. 2d 972, 988 (CA3 1976), cert.denied, 429 U. S. 1038 (1977). Our cases recognize that adefendant has a constitutional right "not to be tried whilelegally incompetent," and that a State's "failure to observeprocedures adequate to protect a defendant's right not to betried or convicted while incompetent to stand trial depriveshim of his due process right to a fair trial." Drope v. Missouri, 420 U. S., at 172, 173. Once a State provides a defendant access to procedures for making a competency evaluation, however, we perceive no basis for holding that dueprocess further requires the State to assume the burden ofvindicating the defendant's constitutional right by persuading the trier of fact that the defendant is competent tostand trial.Petitioner relies upon federal- and state-court decisionswhich have said that the allocation of the burden of proof tothe defendant in these circumstances is inconsistent with therule of Pate v. Robinson, supra, at 384, where we held thata defendant whose competence is in doubt cannot be deemedto have waived his right to a competency hearing. E. g.,United States v. DiGilio, supra, at 988; People v. McCullum,66 Ill. 2d 306, 312-314, 362 N. E. 2d 307, 310-311 (1977); State505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:36 PAGES OPINPGT450 MEDINA v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtv. Bertrand, supra, at 727-728, 465 A. 2d, at 916. Because" `it is contradictory to argue that a defendant may be incompetent, and yet knowingly or intelligently "waive" his rightto have the court determine his capacity to stand trial,' " ithas been said that it is also "contradictory to argue that adefendant who may be incompetent should be presumed topossess sufficient intelligence that he will be able to adduceevidence of his incompetency which might otherwise bewithin his grasp."United States v. DiGilio, supra, at 988(quoting Pate v. Robinson, supra, at 384).In our view, the question whether a defendant whose competence is in doubt may waive his right to a competencyhearing is quite different from the question whether the burden of proof may be placed on the defendant once a hearingis held. The rule announced in Pate was driven by our concern that it is impossible to say whether a defendant whosecompetence is in doubt has made a knowing and intelligentwaiver of his right to a competency hearing. Once a competency hearing is held, however, the defendant is entitled tothe assistance of counsel, e. g., Estelle v. Smith, 451 U. S. 454,469-471 (1981), and psychiatric evidence is brought to bearon the question of the defendant's mental condition, see, e. g.,Cal. Penal Code Ann. $$ 1369(a), 1370 (West 1982 and Supp.1992); see generally Brakel, Parry, & Weiner, The MentallyDisabled and the Law, at 697-698. Although an impaireddefendant might be limited in his ability to assist counselin demonstrating incompetence, the defendant's inability toassist counsel can, in and of itself, constitute probative evidence of incompetence, and defense counsel will often havethe best-informed view of the defendant's ability to participate in his defense. E. g., United States v. David, 167 U. S.App. D. C. 117, 122, 511 F. 2d 355, 360 (1975); United Statesex rel. Roth v. Zelker, 455 F. 2d 1105, 1108 (CA2), cert. denied, 408 U. S. 927 (1972). While reasonable minds may differ as to the wisdom of placing the burden of proof on thedefendant in these circumstances, we believe that a State505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:36 PAGES OPINPGT451Cite as: 505 U. S. 437 (1992)Opinion of the Courtmay take such factors into account in making judgments asto the allocation of the burden of proof, and we see no basisfor concluding that placing the burden on the defendant vio-lates the principle approved inPate.Petitioner argues that psychiatry is an inexact science, andthat placing the burden of proof on the defendant violatesdue process because it requires the defendant to "bear therisk of being forced to stand trial as a result of an erroneousfinding of competency." Brief for Petitioner 8. Our casesrecognize that "[t]he subtleties and nuances of psychiatricdiagnosis render certainties virtually beyond reach in mostsituations," because "[p]sychiatric diagnosis . . . is to a largeextent based on medical `impressions' drawn from subjectiveanalysis and filtered through the experience of the diagnostician." Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S., at 430. The DueProcess Clause does not, however, require a State to adoptone procedure over another on the basis that it may produceresults more favorable to the accused. See, e. g., Pattersonv. New York, 432 U. S., at 208 ("Due process does not requirethat every conceivable step be taken, at whatever cost, toeliminate the possibility of convicting an innocent person");Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97, 105 (1934) (a stateprocedure "does not run foul of the Fourteenth Amendmentbecause another method may seem to our thinking to befairer or wiser or to give a surer promise of protection tothe prisoner at the bar"). Consistent with our precedents,it is enough that the State affords the criminal defendant onwhose behalf a plea of incompetence is asserted a reasonableopportunity to demonstrate that he is not competent tostand trial.Petitioner further contends that the burden of proof shouldbe placed on the State because we have allocated the burdento the State on a variety of other issues that implicate acriminal defendant's constitutional rights. E. g., Colorado v.Connelly, 479 U. S. 157, 168-169 (1986) (waiver of Mirandarights); Nix v. Williams, 467 U. S. 431, 444-445, n. 5 (1984)505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:36 PAGES OPINPGT452 MEDINA v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Court(inevitable discovery of evidence obtained by unlawfulmeans);United States v. Matlock, 415 U. S. 164, 177-178,n. 14 (1974) (voluntariness of consent to search); Lego v. Twomey, 404 U. S. 477, 489 (1972) (voluntariness of confession).The decisions upon which petitioner relies, however, do notcontrol the result here, because they involved situationswhere the government sought to introduce inculpatory evidence obtained by virtue of a waiver of, or in violation of,a defendant's constitutional rights. In such circumstances,allocating the burden of proof to the government furthersthe objective of "deterring lawless conduct by police andprosecution." Ibid. No such purpose is served by allocating the burden of proof to the government in a competencyhearing.In light of our determination that the allocation of the burden of proof to the defendant does not offend due process,it is not difficult to dispose of petitioner's challenge to thepresumption of competence imposed by $ 1369(f). UnderCalifornia law, a defendant is required to make a thresholdshowing of incompetence before a hearing is required and,at the hearing, the defendant may be prevented from makingdecisions that are normally left to the discretion of a competent defendant. E. g., People v. Samuel, 29 Cal. 3d 489, 495-496, 629 P. 2d 485, 486-487 (1981). Petitioner argues that,once the trial court has expressed a doubt as to the defendant's competence, a hearing is held, and the defendant is deprived of his right to make determinations reserved to competent persons, it is irrational to retain the presumption thatthe defendant is competent.In rejecting this contention below, the California SupremeCourt observed that "[t]he primary significance of the presumption of competence is to place on defendant (or the People, if they contest his competence) the burden of rebuttingit" and that, "[b]y its terms, the presumption of competenceis one which affects the burden of proof." 51 Cal. 3d, at 885,799 P. 2d, at 1291.

S. 437 (1992)O'Connor, J., concurring in judgmentnia Supreme Court's conclusion that, in essence, the chal-lenged presumption is a restatement of the burden of proof,and it follows from what we have said that the presumptiondoes not violate the Due Process Clause.Nothing in today's decision is inconsistent with our long-standing recognition that the criminal trial of an incompetent defendant violates due process. Drope v. Missouri, 420U. S., at 172-173;Pate v. Robinson, 383 U. S., at 386; see alsoRiggins v. Nevada, 504 U. S. 127, 139 (1992) (Kennedy, J.,concurring in judgment). Rather, our rejection of petitioner's challenge to $ 1369(f) is based on a determination thatthe California procedure is "constitutionally adequate" toguard against such results, Drope v. Missouri, supra, at 172,and reflects our considered view that "[t]raditionally, dueprocess has required that only the most basic proceduralsafeguards be observed; more subtle balancing of society'sinterests against those of the accused ha[s] been left to thelegislative branch," Patterson v. New York, supra, at 210.The judgment of the Supreme Court of California is
