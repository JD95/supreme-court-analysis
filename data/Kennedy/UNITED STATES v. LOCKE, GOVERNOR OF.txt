The maritime oil transport industry presents ever-present,all too real dangers of oil spills from tanker ships, spillswhich could be catastrophes for the marine environment.After the supertanker Torrey Canyon spilled its cargo of120,000 tons of crude oil off the coast of Cornwall, England,in 1967, both Congress and the State of Washington enactedmore stringent regulations for these tankers and providedfor more comprehensive remedies in the event of an oil spill.The ensuing question of federal pre-emption of the State'slaws was addressed by the Court in Ray v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 435 U. S. 151 (1978).In 1989, the supertankerExxon Valdez ran aground inPrince William Sound, Alaska, and its cargo of more than 53million gallons of crude oil caused the largest oil spill inUnited States history. Again, both Congress and the Stateof Washington responded. Congress enacted new statutoryprovisions, and Washington adopted regulations governingtanker operations and design. Today we must determinewhether these more recent state laws can stand despite thecomprehensive federal regulatory scheme governing oiltankers. Relying on the same federal statute that controlled the analysis in Ray, we hold that some of the State'sregulations are pre-empted; as to the balance of the regulations, we remand the case so their validity may be assessedin light of the considerable federal interest at stake and inconformity with the principles we now discuss.E.

S. 89 (2000)Opinion of the CourtIThe State of Washington embraces some of the Nation'smost significant waters and coastal regions. Its PacificOcean seacoast consists, in large part, of wave-exposed rockyheadlands separated by stretches of beach. Washingtonborders as well on the Columbia River estuary, dividingWashington from Oregon. Two other large estuaries, GraysHarbor and Willapa Bay, are also within Washington's wa-ters. Of special significance in these cases is the inland seaof Puget Sound, a 2,500 square mile body of water consistingof inlets, bays, and channels. More than 200 islands are located within the sound, and it sustains fisheries and plantand animal life of immense value to the Nation and to theworld.Passage from the Pacific Ocean to the quieter Puget Soundis through the Strait of Juan de Fuca, a channel 12 mileswide and 65 miles long which divides Washington from theCanadian Province of British Columbia. The internationalboundary is located midchannel. Access to Vancouver, Canada's largest port, is through the strait. Traffic inboundfrom the Pacific Ocean, whether destined to ports in theUnited States or Canada, is routed through Washington'swaters; outbound traffic, whether from a port in Washingtonor Vancouver, is directed through Canadian waters. Thepattern had its formal adoption in a 1979 agreement enteredinto by the United States and Canada. Agreement for a Co-operative Vessel Traffic Management System for the Juan deFuca Region, 32 U. S. T. 377, T. I. A. S. No. 9706.In addition to holding some of our vital waters, Washington is the site of major installations for the Nation's oil indus-try and the destination or shipping point for huge volumesof oil and its end products. Refineries and product termi-nals are located adjacent to Puget Sound in ports includingCherry Point, Ferndale, Tacoma, and Anacortes. Canadianrefineries are found near Vancouver on Burrard Inlet andthe lower Fraser River. Crude oil is transported by sea to529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN96 UNITED STATES v. LOCKEOpinion of the CourtPuget Sound. Most is extracted from Alaska's North Slopereserve and is shipped to Washington on United States flagvessels. Foreign-flag vessels arriving from nations suchas Venezuela and Indonesia also call at Washington's oilinstallations.The bulk of oil transported on water is found in tankers,vessels which consist of a group of tanks contained in a shipshaped hull, propelled by an isolated machinery plant at thestern. The Court described the increase in size and numbers of these ships close to three decades ago in Askew v.American Waterways Operators, Inc., 411 U. S. 325, 335(1973), noting that the average vessel size increased from16,000 tons during World War II to 76,000 tons in 1966.(The term "tons" refers to "deadweight tons," a way of measuring the cargo-carrying capacity of the vessels.) Between1955 and 1968, the world tanker fleet grew from 2,500 vesselsto 4,300. Ibid. By December 1973, 366 tankers in theworld tanker fleet were in excess of 175,000 tons, see 1M. Tusiani, The Petroleum Shipping Industry 79 (1996), andby 1998 the number of vessels considered "tankers" in themerchant fleets of the world numbered 6,739, see U. S. Dept.of Transp., Maritime Administration, Merchant Fleets of theWorld 1 (Oct. 1998).The size of these vessels, the frequency of tanker operations, and the vast amount of oil transported by vessels withbut one or two layers of metal between the cargo and thewater present serious risks. Washington's waters havebeen subjected to oil spills and further threatened by nearmisses. In December 1984, for example, the tanker ARCOAnchorage grounded in Port Angeles Harbor and spilled239,000 gallons of Alaskan crude oil. The most notorious oilspill in recent times was in Prince William Sound, Alaska,where the grounding of the Exxon Valdez released morethan 11 million gallons of crude oil and, like the Torrey Canyon spill before it, caused public officials intense concernover the threat of a spill.529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN97Cite as: 529 U.

The organization represents approximately 80% of the world's independently ownedtanker fleet; and an estimated 60% of the oil imported intothe United States is carried on Intertanko vessels. Theassociation brought this suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against state and local officials responsible forenforcing the BAP regulations. Groups interested in environmental preservation intervened in defense of the laws.Intertanko argued that Washington's BAP standards invaded areas long occupied by the Federal Government andimposed unique requirements in an area where national uniformity was mandated. Intertanko further contended thatif local political subdivisions of every maritime nation wereto impose differing regulatory regimes on tanker operations,the goal of national governments to develop effective international environmental and safety standards would bedefeated.529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN98 UNITED STATES v.

Intertanko lodged acopy of the note with the District Court. The concernedgovernments represented that "legislation by the State ofWashington on tanker personnel, equipment and operationswould cause inconsistency between the regulatory regime ofthe US Government and that of an individual State of theUS.

The appeal followed, andat that stage the United States intervened on Intertanko'sbehalf, contending that the District Court's ruling failed togive sufficient weight to the substantial foreign affairs interests of the Federal Government. The United States Courtof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the State couldenforce its laws, save the one requiring the vessels to installcertain navigation and towing equipment. 148 F. 3d 1053(1998).

S. 1063 (1999). IIThe State of Washington has enacted legislation in an areawhere the federal interest has been manifest since the beginning of our Republic and is now well established. The au-thority of Congress to regulate interstate navigation, without embarrassment from intervention of the separate Statesand resulting difficulties with foreign nations, was cited inthe Federalist Papers as one of the reasons for adopting theConstitution.E. g., The Federalist Nos. 44, 12, 64. In 1789,the First Congress enacted a law by which vessels with afederal certificate were entitled to "the benefits granted byany law of the United States." Act of Sept. 1, 1789, ch. 11,$ 1, 1 Stat. 55. The importance of maritime trade and theemergence of maritime transport by steamship resulted infurther federal licensing requirements enacted to promotetrade and to enhance the safety of crew members and passengers. See Act of July 7, 1838, ch. 191, 5 Stat. 304; Act ofMar. 3, 1843, ch. 94, 5 Stat. 626. In 1871, Congress enacteda comprehensive scheme of regulation for steam poweredvessels, including provisions for licensing captains, chiefmates, engineers, and pilots. Act of Feb. 28, 1871, ch. 100,16 Stat. 440.The Court in Cooley v. Board of Wardens of Port of Philadelphia ex rel. Soc. for Relief of Distressed Pilots, 12 How.299 (1852), stated that there would be instances in whichstate regulation of maritime commerce is inappropriate evenabsent the exercise of federal authority, although in the casebefore it the Court found the challenged state regulationswere permitted in light of local needs and conditions.Where Congress had acted, however, the Court had littledifficulty in finding state vessel requirements were pre529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN100 UNITED STATES v. LOCKEOpinion of the Courtempted by federal laws which governed the certification ofvessels and standards of operation. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9Wheat. 1 (1824), invalidated a New York law that attemptedto grant a monopoly to operate steamboats on the ground itwas inconsistent with the coasting license held by the vesselowner challenging the exclusive franchise. And in Sinnot v.Davenport, 22 How. 227 (1859), the Court decided that thefederal license held by the vessel contained "the only guardsand restraints, which Congress has seen fit to annex to theprivileges of ships and vessels engaged in the coastingtrade." Id., at 241. The Court went on to explain that insuch a circumstance, state laws on the subject must yield:"In every such case, the act of Congress or treaty is supreme;and the law of the State, though enacted in the exercise ofpowers not controverted, must yield to it." Id., at 243.Against this background, Congress has enacted a series ofstatutes pertaining to maritime tanker transports and hasratified international agreements on the subject. We beginby referring to the principal statutes and international instruments discussed by the parties.1. The Tank Vessel Act.The Tank Vessel Act of 1936, 49 Stat. 1889, enacted specificrequirements for operation of covered vessels. The Act provided that "[i]n order to secure effective provisions againstthe hazards of life and property," additional federal rulescould be adopted with respect to the "design and construction, alteration, or repair of such vessels," "the operation ofsuch vessels," and "the requirements of the manning of suchvessels and the duties and qualifications of the officers andcrews thereof." The purpose of the Act was to establish "areasonable and uniform set of rules and regulations concerning . . . vessels carrying the type of cargo deemed dangerous." H. R. Rep. No. 2962, 74th Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1936).The Tank Vessel Act was the primary source for regulating529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN101Cite as: 529 U. S. 89 (2000)Opinion of the Courttank vessels for the next 30 years, until the Torrey Canyongrounding led Congress to take new action.2. The Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972.Responding to the Torrey Canyon spill, Congress enactedthe Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972 (PWSA). TheAct, as amended by the Port and Tanker Safety Act of 1978,92 Stat. 1471, contains two somewhat overlapping titles, bothof which may, as theRay Court explained, preclude enforcement of state laws, though not by the same pre-emption anal-ysis. Title I concerns vessel traffic "in any port or placeunder the jurisdiction of the United States." 110 Stat. 3934,33 U. S. C. $ 1223(a)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. III). Under Title I,the Coast Guard may enact measures for controlling vesseltraffic or for protecting navigation and the marine environment, but it is not required to do so. Ibid.Title II does require the Coast Guard to issue regulations,regulations addressing the "design, construction, alteration,repair, maintenance, operation, equipping, personnel qualification, and manning of vessels . . . that may be necessary forincreased protection against hazards to life and property, fornavigation and vessel safety, and for enhanced protection ofthe marine environment." 46 U. S. C. $ 3703(a).The critical provisions of the PWSA described above remain operative, but the Act has been amended, most significantly by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), 104 Stat. 484.OPA, enacted in response to the Exxon Valdez spill, requiresseparate discussion.3. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990.The OPA contains nine titles, two having the most significance for these cases. Title I is captioned "Oil Pollution Liability, and Compensation" and adds extensive new provisionsto the United States Code. See 104 Stat. 2375, 33 U. S. C.$ 2701 et seq. (1994 ed. and Supp. III). Title I imposes liability (for both removal costs and damages) on parties re529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN102 UNITED STATES v. LOCKEOpinion of the Courtsponsible for an oil spill. $ 2702. Other provisions providedefenses to, and limitations on, this liability. 33 U. S. C.$$ 2703, 2704. Of considerable importance to these cases areOPA's saving clauses, found in Title I of the Act, $ 2718, andto be discussed below.Title IV of OPA is entitled "Prevention and Removal."For the most part, it amends existing statutory provisionsor instructs the Secretary of Transportation (whose depart-ments include the Coast Guard) to take action under previous grants of rulemaking authority. For example, Title IVinstructs the Coast Guard to require reporting of marine casualties resulting in a "significant harm to the environment."46 U. S. C. $ 6101(a)(5) (1994 ed. and Supp. V). Title IV further requires the Secretary to issue regulations to definethose areas, including Puget Sound, on which single hulledtankers shall be escorted by other vessels. 104 Stat. 523.By incremental dates specified in the Act, all covered tankervessels must have a double hull. 46 U. S. C. $ 3703a.4. Treaties and International Agreements.The scheme of regulation includes a significant and intricate complex of international treaties and maritime agreements bearing upon the licensing and operation of vessels.We are advised by the United States that the internationalregime depends upon the principle of reciprocity. That is tosay, the certification of a vessel by the government of itsown flag nation warrants that the ship has complied withinternational standards, and vessels with those certificatesmay enter ports of the signatory nations. Brief for UnitedStates 3.Illustrative of treaties and agreements to which theUnited States is a party are the International Conventionfor the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, 32 U. S. T. 47, T. I. A. S.No. 9700, the International Convention for Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, S. Exec. Doc. C, 93-1, 12 I. L. M.1319, as amended by 1978 Protocol, S. Exec. Doc.

A.No. 7624.The United States argues that these treaties, as the supreme law of the land, have pre-emptive force over the stateregulations in question here. We need not reach that issueat this stage of the case because the state regulations weaddress in detail below are pre-empted by federal statuteand regulations. The existence of the treaties and agreements on standards of shipping is of relevance, of course, forthese agreements give force to the longstanding rule thatthe enactment of a uniform federal scheme displaces statelaw, and the treaties indicate Congress will have demandednational uniformity regarding maritime commerce. SeeRay, 435 U. S., at 166 (recognizing Congress anticipated "arriving at international standards for building tank vessels"and understanding "the Nation was to speak with one voice"on these matters). In later proceedings, if it is deemed necessary for full disposition of the case, it should be open tothe parties to argue whether the specific international agreements and treaties are of binding, pre-emptive force. We donot reach those questions, for it may be that pre-emptionprinciples applicable to the basic federal statutory structurewill suffice, upon remand, for a complete determination.IIIIn Ray v. Atlantic Richfield, supra, the Court was askedto review, in light of an established federal and internationalregulatory scheme, comprehensive tanker regulations imposed by the State of Washington. The Court held that thePWSA and Coast Guard regulations promulgated under thatAct pre-empted a state pilotage requirement, Washington'slimitation on tanker size, and tanker design and construction rules.529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN104 UNITED STATES v. LOCKEOpinion of the CourtIn these cases, petitioners relied on Ray to argue thatWashington's more recent state regulations were preempted as well. The Court of Appeals, however, concludedthat Ray retained little validity in light of subsequent actionby Congress. We disagree. The Ray Court's interpretation of the PWSA is correct and controlling. Its basic analytic structure explains why federal pre-emption analysis applies to the challenged regulations and allows scope and duerecognition for the traditional authority of the States andlocalities to regulate some matters of local concern.At the outset, it is necessary to explain that the essentialframework of Ray, and of the PWSA which it interpreted,are of continuing force, neither having been superseded bysubsequent authority relevant to these cases. In narrowingthe pre-emptive effect given the PWSA in Ray, the Court ofAppeals relied upon OPA's saving clauses, finding in theirlanguage a return of authority to the States. Title I of OPAcontains two saving clauses, stating:"(a) Preservation of State authorities . . ."Nothing in this Act or the Act of March 3, 1851shall--"(1) affect, or be construed or interpreted as preempting, the authority of any State or political subdivision thereof from imposing any additional liabilityor requirements with respect to--"(A) the discharge of oil or other pollution by oilwithin such State . . . .. . . . ."(c) Additional requirements and liabilities; penalties"Nothing in this Act, the Act of March 3, 1851 (46U. S. C. 183 et seq.), or section 9509 of [the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U. S. C. 9509)], shall in any wayaffect, or be construed to affect, the authority of theUnited States or any State or political subdivisionthereof--529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN105Cite as: 529 U. S. 89 (2000)Opinion of the Court"(1) to impose additional liability or additionalrequirements. . . . ."relating to the discharge, or substantial threat of adischarge, of oil." 33 U. S. C. $ 2718.The Court of Appeals placed more weight on the savingclauses than those provisions can bear, either from a textualstandpoint or from a consideration of the whole federal regu-latory scheme of which OPA is but a part.The saving clauses are found in Title I of OPA, captionedOil Pollution Liability and Compensation and creating a liability scheme for oil pollution. In contrast to the Washing-ton rules at issue here, Title I does not regulate vessel operation, design, or manning. Placement of the saving clausesin Title I of OPA suggests that Congress intended to preserve state laws of a scope similar to the matters containedin Title I of OPA, not all state laws similar to the matterscovered by the whole of OPA or to the whole subject of mari-time oil transport. The evident purpose of the savingclauses is to preserve state laws which, rather than imposingsubstantive regulation of a vessel's primary conduct, establish liability rules and financial requirements relating to oilspills. See Gutierrez v. Ada, 528 U. S. 250, 255 (2000) (wordsof a statute should be interpreted consistent with theirneighbors to avoid giving unintended breadth to an Act ofCongress).Our conclusion is fortified by Congress' decision to limitthe saving clauses by the same key words it used in declaringthe scope of Title I of OPA. Title I of OPA permits recoveryof damages involving vessels "from which oil is discharged,or which pos[e] the substantial threat of a discharge of oil."33 U. S. C. $ 2702(a). The saving clauses, in parallel manner,permit States to impose liability or requirements "relatingto the discharge, or substantial threat of a discharge, of oil."$ 2718(c). In its titles following Title I, OPA addresses matters including licensing and certificates of registry, 104 Stat.529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN106 UNITED STATES v. LOCKEOpinion of the Court509; duties of senior licensed officers to relieve the master,id., at 511; manning standards for foreign vessels, id., at 513;reporting of marine casualties, ibid.; minimum standards forplating thickness,id., at 515; tank vessel manning requirements, id., at 517; and tank vessel construction standards,id., at 517-518, among other extensive regulations. If Congress had intended to disrupt national uniformity in all ofthese matters, it would not have done so by placement of thesaving clauses in Title I.The saving clauses are further limited in effect to "thisAct, the Act of March 3, 1851 . . . , or section 9509 of [theInternal Revenue Code]." $$ 2718(a) and (c). These explicit qualifiers are inconsistent with interpreting the savingclauses to alter the pre-emptive effect of the PWSA or regulations promulgated thereunder. The text of the statute indicates no intent to allow States to impose wide-ranging regulation of the at-sea operation of tankers. The clauses maypreserve a State's ability to enact laws of a scope similar toTitle I, but do not extend to subjects addressed in the othertitles of the Act or other acts.Limiting the saving clauses as we have determined respects the established federal-state balance in matters ofmaritime commerce between the subjects as to which theStates retain concurrent powers and those over which thefederal authority displaces state control. We have upheldstate laws imposing liability for pollution caused by oil spills.See Askew v. American Waterways Operators, Inc., 411U. S., at 325. Our view of OPA's saving clauses preservesthis important role for the States, which is unchallengedhere. We think it quite unlikely that Congress would use ameans so indirect as the saving clauses in Title I of OPA toupset the settled division of authority by allowing States toimpose additional unique substantive regulation on the atsea conduct of vessels. We decline to give broad effect tosaving clauses where doing so would upset the careful regulatory scheme established by federal law. See, e. g., Morales529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN107Cite as: 529 U. S. 89 (2000)Opinion of the Courtv. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 385 (1992);American Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Central Office Telephone, Inc., 524 U. S. 214, 227-228 (1998).From the text of OPA and the long-established understanding of the appropriate balance between federal andstate regulation of maritime commerce, we hold that thepre-emptive effect of the PWSA and regulations promulgated under it are not affected by OPA. We doubt Congresswill be surprised by our conclusion, for the ConferenceReport on OPA shared our view that the statute "does notdisturb the Supreme Court's decision inRay v. AtlanticRichfield Co., 435 U. S. 151 (1978)." H. R. Conf. Rep.No. 101-653, p. 122 (1990). The holding inRay also survivesthe enactment of OPA undiminished, and we turn to a de-tailed discussion of that case.As we mentioned above, the Ray Court confronted a claimby the operator of a Puget Sound refinery that federal lawprecluded Washington from enforcing laws imposing certainsubstantive requirements on tankers. TheRay Court prefaced its analysis of the state regulations with the followingobservation:"The Court's prior cases indicate that when a State'sexercise of its police power is challenged under the Supremacy Clause, `we start with the assumption that thehistoric police powers of the States were not to be su-perseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clearand manifest purpose of Congress.' Rice v. Santa FeElevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947)." 435 U. S.,at 157.The fragmentary quote from Rice v. Santa Fe ElevatorCorp., 331 U. S. 218 (1947), does not support the scope givento it by the Court of Appeals or by respondents.Ray quoted but a fragment of a much longer paragraphfound in Rice. The quoted fragment is followed by extensive and careful qualifications to show the different ap529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN108 UNITED STATES v. LOCKEOpinion of the Courtproaches taken by the Court in various contexts. We neednot discuss that careful explanation in detail, however. Toexplain the full intent of the Rice quotation, it suffices toquote in full the sentence in question and two sentences preceding it. The Rice opinion stated: "The question in eachcase is what the purpose of Congress was. Congress legislated here in a field which the States have traditionally occupied. So we start with the assumption that the historic po-lice powers of the States were not to be superseded by theFederal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purposeof Congress." 331 U. S., at 230 (citations omitted).The qualification given by the word "so" and by the preceding sentences in Rice are of considerable consequence.As Rice indicates, an "assumption" of nonpre-emption is nottriggered when the State regulates in an area where therehas been a history of significant federal presence. See alsoJones v. Rath Packing Co., 430 U. S. 519, 525 (1977) ("assumption" is triggered where "the field which Congress issaid to have pre-empted has been traditionally occupied bythe States"); Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 485 (1996)(citing Rice in case involving medical negligence, a subjecthistorically regulated by the States). In Ray, and in thecase before us, Congress has legislated in the field from theearliest days of the Republic, creating an extensive federalstatutory and regulatory scheme.The state laws now in question bear upon national andinternational maritime commerce, and in this area there isno beginning assumption that concurrent regulation by theState is a valid exercise of its police powers. Rather, wemust ask whether the local laws in question are consistentwith the federal statutory structure, which has as one of itsobjectives a uniformity of regulation for maritime commerce.No artificial presumption aids us in determining the scope ofappropriate local regulation under the PWSA, which, as wediscuss below, does preserve, in Title I of that Act, the historic role of the States to regulate local ports and waters529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN109Cite as: 529 U. S. 89 (2000)Opinion of the Courtunder appropriate circumstances. At the same time, as wealso discuss below, uniform, national rules regarding generaltanker design, operation, and seaworthiness have been man-dated by Title II of the PWSA.The Ray Court confirmed the important proposition thatthe subject and scope of Title I of the PWSA allows a Stateto regulate its ports and waterways, so long as the regulation is based on "the peculiarities of local waters that call forspecial precautionary measures." 435 U. S., at 171. Title Iallows state rules directed to local circumstances and prob-lems, such as water depth and narrowness, idiosyncratic toa particular port or waterway. Ibid. There is no preemption by operation of Title I itself if the state regulationis so directed and if the Coast Guard has not adopted regulations on the subject or determined that regulation is unnecessary or inappropriate. This principle is consistent withrecognition of an important role for States and localities inthe regulation of the Nation's waterways and ports. E. g.,Cooley, 12 How., at 319 (recognizing state authority to adoptplans "applicable to the local peculiarities of the ports withintheir limits"). It is fundamental in our federal structurethat States have vast residual powers. Those powers, unless constrained or displaced by the existence of federal authority or by proper federal enactments, are often exercisedin concurrence with those of the National Government. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819).As Ray itself made apparent, the States may enforce rulesgoverned by Title I of the PWSA unless they run counter toan exercise of federal authority. The analysis under Title Iof the PWSA, then, is one of conflict pre-emption, whichoccurs "when compliance with both state and federal lawis impossible, or when the state law `stands as an obstacleto the accomplishment and execution of the full purposesand objective of Congress.' " California v. ARC AmericaCorp., 490 U. S. 93, 100-101 (1989) (citations omitted). Inthis context, Coast Guard regulations are to be given pre529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN110 UNITED STATES v. LOCKEOpinion of the Courtemptive effect over conflicting state laws. City of New Yorkv.FCC, 486 U. S. 57, 63-64 (1988) (" `[A] federal agency actingwithin the scope of its congressionally delegated authoritymay pre-empt state regulation' and hence render unenforceable state or local laws that are otherwise not inconsistentwith federal law").Ray defined the relevant inquiry forTitle I pre-emption as whether the Coast Guard has promulgated its own requirement on the subject or has decided thatno such requirement should be imposed at all. 435 U. S., at171-172; see also id., at 178 (" `[W]here failure of . . . federalofficials affirmatively to exercise their full authority takes onthe character of a ruling that no such regulation is appropriate or approved pursuant to the policy of the statute,'States are not permitted to use their police power to enactsuch a regulation. Bethlehem Steel Co. v. New York StateLabor Relations Board, 330 U. S. 767, 774 (1947)"). Rayalso recognized that, even in the context of a regulation related to local waters, a federal official with an overview ofall possible ramifications of a particular requirement mightbe in the best position to balance all the competing interests.Id., at 177.While Ray explained that Congress, in Title I of thePWSA, preserved state authority to regulate the peculiarities of local waters if there was no conflict with federal regulatory determinations, the Court further held that Congress,in Title II of the PWSA, mandated federal rules on the subjects or matters there specified, demanding uniformity. Id.,at 168 ("Title II leaves no room for the States to imposedifferent or stricter design requirements than those whichCongress has enacted with the hope of having them internationally adopted or has accepted as the result of internationalaccord. A state law in this area . . . would frustrate thecongressional desire of achieving uniform, internationalstandards"). Title II requires the Coast Guard to imposenational regulations governing the general seaworthiness oftankers and their crews. Id., at 160. Under Ray's inter529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN111Cite as: 529 U. S. 89 (2000)Opinion of the Courtpretation of the Title II PWSA provision now found at 46U. S. C. $ 3703(a), only the Federal Government may regulatethe "design, construction, alteration, repair, maintenance, op-eration, equipping, personnel qualification, and manning" oftanker vessels.InRay, this principle was applied to hold that Washington's tanker design and construction rules were pre-empted.Those requirements failed because they were within a fieldreserved for federal regulation under 46 U. S. C. $ 391a (1982ed.), the predecessor to $ 3703(a). We reaffirm Ray's holdingon this point. Contrary to the suggestion of the Court ofAppeals, the field of pre-emption established by $ 3703(a)cannot be limited to tanker "design" and "construction,"terms which cannot be read in isolation from the other subjects found in that section. Title II of the PWSA covers"design, construction, alteration, repair, maintenance, operation, equipping, personnel qualification, and manning" oftanker vessels. Ibid. Congress has left no room for stateregulation of these matters. See Fidelity Fed. Sav. & LoanAssn. v. De la Cuesta, 458 U. S. 141 (1982) (explaining fieldpre-emption). As the Ray Court stated: "[T]he SupremacyClause dictates that the federal judgment that a vessel issafe to navigate United States waters prevail over the contrary state judgment. Enforcement of the state requirements would at least frustrate what seems to us to be theevident congressional intention to establish a uniform federalregime controlling the design of oil tankers." 435 U. S., at165.The existence of some overlapping coverage between thetwo titles of the PWSA may make it difficult to determinewhether a pre-emption question is controlled by conflict preemption principles, applicable generally to Title I, or by fieldpre-emption rules, applicable generally to Title II. The RayCourt acknowledged the difficulty, but declined to resolveevery question by the greater pre-emptive force of Title II.We follow the same approach, and conflict pre-emption under529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN112 UNITED STATES v. LOCKEOpinion of the CourtTitle I will be applicable in some, although not all, cases.We recognize that the terms used in $ 3703(a) are quitebroad. In defining their scope, and the scope of the result-ing field pre-emption, it will be useful to consider the typeof regulations the Secretary has actually promulgated underthe section, as well as the section's list of specific types ofregulation that must be included. Useful inquiries includewhether the rule is justified by conditions unique to a particular port or waterway. See id., at 175 (a Title I regulationis one "based on water depth in Puget Sound or on otherlocal peculiarities"). Furthermore, a regulation within theState's residual powers will often be of limited extraterritorial effect, not requiring the tanker to modify its primaryconduct outside the specific body of water purported to justify the local rule. Limited extraterritorial effect explainswhyRay upheld a state rule requiring a tug escort for cer-tain vessels, id., at 171, and why state rules requiring a registered vessel (i. e., one involved in foreign trade) to take ona local pilot have historically been allowed,id., at 159-160.Local rules not pre-empted under Title II of the PWSA posea minimal risk of innocent noncompliance, do not affect ves-sel operations outside the jurisdiction, do not require adjustment of systemic aspects of the vessel, and do not impose asubstantial burden on the vessel's operation within the localjurisdiction itself. IVThe field pre-emption rule surrounding Title II and$ 3703(a) and the superseding effect of additional federalstatutes are illustrated by the pre-emption of four of Wash-ington's tanker regulations. We address these because theattempted reach of the state rules is well demonstrated bythe briefs and record before us; other parts of the state regulatory scheme can be addressed on remand.First, Washington imposes a series of training requirements on a tanker's crew. WAC $ 317-21-230; see also Ap-pendix,infra, at 118. A covered vessel is required to certify529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN113Cite as: 529 U. S. 89 (2000)Opinion of the Courtthat its crew has "complete[d] a comprehensive training pro-gram approved by the [State]." The State requires the vessel's master to "be trained in shipboard management" andlicensed deck officers to be trained in bridge resource management, automated radar plotting aids, shiphandling, crudeoil washing, inert gas systems, cargo handling, oil spill prevention and response, and shipboard fire fighting. The statelaw mandates a series of "weekly," "monthly," and "quar-terly" drills.This state requirement under WAC $ 317-21-230 does notaddress matters unique to the waters of Puget Sound. Onthe contrary, it imposes requirements that control thestaffing, operation, and manning of a tanker outside of Washington's waters. The training and drill requirements pertain to "operation" and "personnel qualifications" and so arepre-empted by 46 U. S. C. $ 3703(a). Our conclusion thattraining is a field reserved to the Federal Government receives further confirmation from the circumstance that theSTCW Convention addresses "training" and "qualification"requirements of the crew, Art. VI, and that the UnitedStates has enacted crew training requirements. E. g., 46CFR pts. 10, 12, 13, 15 (1999).The second Washington rule we find pre-empted is WAC$ 317-21-250; see also Appendix, infra, at 119. Washingtonimposes English language proficiency requirements on atanker's crew. This requirement will dictate how a tankeroperator staffs the vessel even from the outset of the voyage,when the vessel may be thousands of miles from PugetSound. It is not limited to governing local traffic or localpeculiarities. The State's attempted rule is a "personnelqualification" pre-empted by $ 3703(a) of Title II. Inaddition, there is another federal statute, 33 U. S. C.$ 1228(a)(7), on the subject. It provides: "[N]o vessel . . .shall operate in the navigable waters of the UnitedStates . . . , if such vessel . . . while underway, does not haveat least one licensed deck officer on the navigation bridge529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN114 UNITED STATES v. LOCKEOpinion of the Courtwho is capable of clearly understanding English." The stat-ute may not be supplemented by laws enacted by the Stateswithout compromising the uniformity the federal rule itselfachieves.The third Washington rule we find invalid under field pre-emption is a navigation watch requirement in WAC $ 317-21-200; see also Appendix, infra, at 118. Washington has different rules for navigation watch, depending on whetherthe tanker is operating in restricted visibility or not. Wemention the restricted visibility rule below, but now evaluatethe requirement which applies in general terms and reads:"[T]he navigation watch shall consist of at least two licenseddeck officers, a helmsman, and a lookout." The generalwatch requirement is not tied to the peculiarities of PugetSound; it applies throughout Washington's waters and at alltimes. It is a general operating requirement and is preempted as an attempt to regulate a tanker's "operation" and"manning" under 46 U. S. C. $ 3703(a).We have illustrated field pre-emption under $ 3703(a) bydiscussing three of Washington's rules which, under the current state of the record, we can determine cannot be enforced due to the assertion of federal authority found in thatsection. The parties discuss other federal statutory provisions and international agreements which also governspecific aspects of international maritime commerce. In appropriate circumstances, these also may have pre-emptiveeffect.For example, the record before us reveals that a fourthstate rule cannot stand in light of other sources of federalregulation of the same subject. Washington requires vessels that ultimately reach its waters to report certain marinecasualties. WAC $ 317-21-130; see also Appendix, infra, at117-118. The requirement applies to incidents (defined asa "collision," "allision," "near-miss incident," "marine casualty" of listed kinds, "accidental or intentional grounding,""failure of the propulsion or primary steering systems,"529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN115Cite as: 529 U. S. 89 (2000)Opinion of the Court"failure of a component or control system," "fire, flood, orother incident that affects the vessel's seaworthiness," and"spills of oil"), regardless of where in the world they mighthave occurred. A vessel operator is required by the stateregulation to make a detailed report to the State on eachincident, listing the date, location, and weather conditions.The report must also list the government agencies to whomthe event was reported and must contain a "brief analysis ofany known causes" and a "description of measures taken toprevent a reoccurrence." WAC $ 317-21-130.The State contends that its requirement is not pre-emptedbecause it is similar to federal requirements. This is an incorrect statement of the law. It is not always a sufficientanswer to a claim of pre-emption to say that state rules supplement, or even mirror, federal requirements. The Courtobserved this principle when Commerce Clause doctrine wasbeginning to take shape, holding in Sinnot v. Davenport, 22How. 227 (1859), that Alabama could not require vessel owners to provide certain information as a condition of operatingin state waters even though federal law also required theowner of the vessel "to furnish, under oath, . . . all the information required by this State law." Id., at 242. The appropriate inquiry still remains whether the purposes and objectives of the federal statutes, including the intent to establisha workable, uniform system, are consistent with concurrentstate regulation. On this point, Justice Holmes' later observation is relevant: "When Congress has taken the particularsubject-matter in hand coincidence is as ineffective as opposition, and a state law is not to be declared a help because itattempts to go farther than Congress has seen fit to go."Charleston & Western Carolina R. Co. v. Varnville Furniture Co., 237 U. S. 597, 604 (1915).We hold that Congress intended that the Coast Guard regulations be the sole source of a vessel's reporting obligationswith respect to the matters covered by the challenged statestatute. Under 46 U. S. C. $ 6101, the Coast Guard "shall529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN116 UNITED STATES v. LOCKEOpinion of the Courtprescribe regulations on the marine casualties to be reportedand the manner of reporting," and the statute lists the kindsof casualties that the regulations must cover. See also$ 3717(a)(4) (requiring the Secretary of Transportation to"establish a marine safety information system"). Congressdid not intend its reporting obligations to be cumulative tothose enacted by each political subdivision whose jurisdictiona vessel enters. The State's reporting requirement is a significant burden in terms of cost and the risk of innocent non-compliance.The Roanoke, 189 U. S. 185, 195 (1903) (themaster of a vessel is in a position "such that it is almostimpossible for him to acquaint himself with the laws of eachindividual State he may visit"). Furthermore, it affects avessel operator's out-of-state obligations and conduct, wherea State's jurisdiction and authority are most in doubt. Thestate reporting requirement under WAC $ 317-21-130 ispre-empted.VAs to conflict pre-emption under Title I, Washington ar-gues that certain of its regulations, such as its watch requirement in times of restricted visibility, are of limited extrater-ritorial effect and necessary to address the peculiarities ofPuget Sound. On remand, the Court of Appeals or DistrictCourt should consider whether the remaining regulationsare pre-empted under Title I conflict pre-emption or Title IIfield pre-emption, or are otherwise pre-empted by thesetitles or under any other federal law or international agree-ment raised as possible sources of pre-emption.We have determined that Washington's regulations re-garding general navigation watch procedures, English language skills, training, and casualty reporting are pre-empted. Petitioners make substantial arguments that theremaining regulations are pre-empted as well. It is prefera-ble that the remaining claims be considered by the Court ofAppeals or by the District Court within the framework wehave discussed. The United States did not participate in529US1 Unit: $U35 [09-26-01 09:32:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN117Cite as: 529 U. S. 89 (2000)Appendix to opinion of the Courtthese cases until appeal. Resolution of these cases wouldbenefit from the development of a full record by all interested parties.We infer from the record that Washington is not now enforcing its regulations. If, pending adjudication of thesecases on remand, a threat of enforcement emerges, the Courtof Appeals or the District Court would weigh any applicationfor stay under the appropriate legal standards in light ofthe principles we have discussed and with recognition of thenational interests at stake.When one contemplates the weight and immense mass ofoil ever in transit by tankers, the oil's proximity to coastallife, and its destructive power even if a spill occurs far uponthe open sea, international, federal, and state regulation maybe insufficient protection. Sufficiency, however, is not thequestion before us. The issue is not adequate regulation butpolitical responsibility; and it is, in large measure, for Congress and the Coast Guard to confront whether their regulatory scheme, which demands a high degree of uniformity, isadequate. States, as well as environmental groups and localport authorities, will participate in the process. See 46U. S. C. $ 3703(a) (requiring the Coast Guard to consider theviews of "officials of State and local governments," "representative of port and harbor authorities," and "representatives of environmental groups" in arriving at nationalstandards).The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, andthese cases are remanded for further proceedings consistentwith this opinion. It is so ordered.APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT"1. Event Reporting--WAC 317-21-130.

BROWN& WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP. et al.certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuitNo. 98-1152. Argued December 1, 1999--Decided March 21, 2000The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA or Act), 21 U. S. C. $ 301 et seq.,grants the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as the designee of theSecretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), the authority to regulate, among other items, "drugs" and "devices," $$ 321(g)-(h), 393. In1996, the FDA asserted jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products, concluding that, under the FDCA, nicotine is a "drug" and cigarettes andsmokeless tobacco are "devices" that deliver nicotine to the body. Pursuant to this authority, the FDA promulgated regulations governingtobacco products' promotion, labeling, and accessibility to children andadolescents. The FDA found that tobacco use is the Nation's leadingcause of premature death, resulting in more than 400,000 deaths annually, and that most adult smokers begin when they are minors. Theregulations therefore aim to reduce tobacco use by minors so as to substantially reduce the prevalence of addiction in future generations, andthus the incidence of tobacco-related death and disease. Respondents,a group of tobacco manufacturers, retailers, and advertisers, filed thissuit challenging the FDA's regulations. They moved for summaryjudgment on the ground, inter alia, that the FDA lacked jurisdictionto regulate tobacco products as customarily marketed, that is, withoutmanufacturer claims of therapeutic benefit. The District Court upheldthe FDA's authority, but the Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that Congress has not granted the FDA jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products. The court concluded that construing the FDCA to include tobacco products would lead to several internal inconsistencies in the Act.It also found that evidence external to the FDCA--that the FDA consistently stated before 1995 that it lacked jurisdiction over tobacco, thatCongress has enacted several tobacco-specific statutes fully cognizant ofthe FDA's position, and that Congress has considered and rejected manybills that would have given the agency such authority--confirms thisconclusion.Held: Reading the FDCA as a whole, as well as in conjunction with Congress' subsequent tobacco-specific legislation, it is plain that Congresshas not given the FDA the authority to regulate tobacco products ascustomarily marketed. Pp. 131-161.529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN121Cite as: 529 U. S. 120 (2000)Syllabus(a) Because this case involves an agency's construction of a statute itadministers, the Court's analysis is governed by Chevron U. S. A. Inc.v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, under whicha reviewing court must first ask whether Congress has directly spokento the precise question at issue, id., at 842. If so, the court must giveeffect to Congress' unambiguously expressed intent. E. g., id., at 843.If not, the court must defer to the agency's construction of the statuteso long as it is permissible. See, e. g., INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U. S.415, 424. In determining whether Congress has specifically addressedthe question at issue, the court should not confine itself to examining aparticular statutory provision in isolation. Rather, it must place theprovision in context, interpreting the statute to create a symmetricaland coherent regulatory scheme. Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S.561, 569. In addition, the meaning of one statute may be affected byother Acts, particularly where Congress has spoken subsequently andmore specifically to the topic at hand. See, e. g., United States v. Estateof Romani, 523 U. S. 517, 530-531. Finally, the court must be guidedto a degree by common sense as to the manner in which Congressis likely to delegate a policy decision of such economic and politicalmagnitude to an administrative agency. Cf. MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 512 U. S. 218, 231.Pp. 131-133.(b) Considering the FDCA as a whole, it is clear that Congress intended to exclude tobacco products from the FDA's jurisdiction. A fundamental precept of the FDCA is that any product regulated by theFDA that remains on the market must be safe and effective for its intended use. See, e. g., $ 393(b)(2). That is, the potential for inflictingdeath or physical injury must be offset by the possibility of therapeuticbenefit. United States v. Rutherford, 442 U. S. 544, 556. In its rulemaking proceeding, the FDA quite exhaustively documented that tobacco products are unsafe, dangerous, and cause great pain and suffering from illness. These findings logically imply that, if tobacco productswere "devices" under the FDCA, the FDA would be required to removethem from the market under the FDCA's misbranding, see, e. g., $ 331(a),and device classification, see, e. g., $ 360e(d)(2)(A), provisions. In fact,based on such provisions, the FDA itself has previously asserted that iftobacco products were within its jurisdiction, they would have to beremoved from the market because it would be impossible to prove theywere safe for their intended use. Congress, however, has foreclosed aban of such products, choosing instead to create a distinct regulatoryscheme focusing on the labeling and advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. Its express policy is to protect commerce and the nationaleconomy while informing consumers about any adverse health effects.529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN122 FDA v. BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP.SyllabusSee 15 U. S. C. $ 1331. Thus, an FDA ban would plainly contradict congressional intent. Apparently recognizing this dilemma, the FDA hasconcluded that tobacco products are actually "safe" under the FDCAbecause banning them would cause a greater harm to public health thanleaving them on the market. But this safety determination--focusingon the relative harms caused by alternative remedial measures--is nota substitute for those required by the FDCA. Various provisions inthe Act require the agency to determine that, at least for some consumers, the product's therapeutic benefits outweigh the risks of illness orserious injury. This the FDA cannot do, because tobacco products areunsafe for obtaining any therapeutic benefit. The inescapable conclusion is that there is no room for tobacco products within the FDCA'sregulatory scheme. If they cannot be used safely for any therapeutic purpose, and yet they cannot be banned, they simply do not fit.Pp. 133-143.(c) The history of tobacco-specific legislation also demonstrates thatCongress has spoken directly to the FDA's authority to regulate tobaccoproducts. Since 1965, Congress has enacted six separate statutes addressing the problem of tobacco use and human health. Those statutes,among other things, require that health warnings appear on all packaging and in all print and outdoor advertisements, see 15 U. S. C. $$ 1331,1333, 4402; prohibit the advertisement of tobacco products through anyelectronic communication medium regulated by the Federal Communications Commission, see $$ 1335, 4402(f); require the Secretary of HHSto report every three years to Congress on research findings concerning tobacco's addictive property, 42 U. S. C. $ 290aa-2(b)(2); and makeStates' receipt of certain federal block grants contingent on their prohibiting any tobacco product manufacturer, retailer, or distributor fromselling or distributing any such product to individuals under age 18,$ 300x-26(a)(1). This tobacco-specific legislation has created a specificregulatory scheme for addressing the problem of tobacco and health.And it was adopted against the backdrop of the FDA consistently andresolutely stating that it was without authority under the FDCA toregulate tobacco products as customarily marketed. In fact, Congressseveral times considered and rejected bills that would have given theFDA such authority. Indeed, Congress' actions in this area have evidenced a clear intent to preclude a meaningful policymaking role for anyadministrative agency. Further, Congress' tobacco legislation prohibitsany additional regulation of tobacco product labeling with respect totobacco's health consequences, a central aspect of regulation under theFDCA. Under these circumstances, it is evident that Congress has ratified the FDA's previous, long-held position that it lacks jurisdiction toregulate tobacco products as customarily marketed. Congress has529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN123Cite as: 529 U. S. 120 (2000)Syllabuscreated a distinct scheme for addressing the subject, and that schemeexcludes any role for FDA regulation. Pp. 143-159.(d) Finally, the Court's inquiry is shaped, at least in some measure,by the nature of the question presented. Chevron deference is premised on the theory that a statute's ambiguity constitutes an implicit delegation from Congress to the agency to fill in the statutory gaps. See467 U. S., at 844. In extraordinary cases, however, there may be reasonto hesitate before concluding that Congress has intended such an implicit delegation. This is hardly an ordinary case. Contrary to theagency's position from its inception until 1995, the FDA has now asserted jurisdiction to regulate an industry constituting a significant portion of the American economy. In fact, the FDA contends that, were itto determine that tobacco products provide no "reasonable assurance ofsafety," it would have the authority to ban cigarettes and smokelesstobacco entirely. It is highly unlikely that Congress would leave thedetermination as to whether the sale of tobacco products would be regulated, or even banned, to the FDA's discretion in so cryptic a fashion.See MCI Telecommunications, supra, at 231. Given tobacco's uniquepolitical history, as well as the breadth of the authority that the FDAhas asserted, the Court is obliged to defer not to the agency's expansiveconstruction of the statute, but to Congress' consistent judgment todeny the FDA this power. Pp. 159-161.(e) No matter how important, conspicuous, and controversial theissue, and regardless of how likely the public is to hold the ExecutiveBranch politically accountable, an administrative agency's power to regulate in the public interest must always be grounded in a valid grant ofauthority from Congress.

S. 120 (2000)Opinion of the CourtJustice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.This case involves one of the most troubling public healthproblems facing our Nation today: the thousands of premature deaths that occur each year because of tobacco use. In1996, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), after havingexpressly disavowed any such authority since its inception,asserted jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products. See 61Fed. Reg. 44619-45318. The FDA concluded that nicotine isa "drug" within the meaning of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA or Act), 52 Stat. 1040, as amended, 21U. S. C. $ 301 et seq., and that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are "combination products" that deliver nicotine to thebody. 61 Fed. Reg. 44397 (1996). Pursuant to this authority, it promulgated regulations intended to reduce tobaccoconsumption among children and adolescents. Id., at 44615-44618. The agency believed that, because most tobaccoconsumers begin their use before reaching the age of 18,curbing tobacco use by minors could substantially reducethe prevalence of addiction in future generations and thusthe incidence of tobacco-related death and disease. Id., at44398-44399.Regardless of how serious the problem an administrativeagency seeks to address, however, it may not exercise itsauthority "in a manner that is inconsistent with the adminis-trative structure that Congress enacted into law."ETSIPipeline Project v. Missouri, 484 U. S. 495, 517 (1988).

Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.837, 842-843 (1984). In this case, we believe that Congresshas clearly precluded the FDA from asserting jurisdictionto regulate tobacco products. Such authority is inconsistentwith the intent that Congress has expressed in the FDCA'soverall regulatory scheme and in the tobacco-specific legisla-tion that it has enacted subsequent to the FDCA. In lightof this clear intent, the FDA's assertion of jurisdiction isimpermissible.IThe FDCA grants the FDA, as the designee of the Secre-tary of Health and Human Services (HHS), the authority toregulate, among other items, "drugs" and "devices." See 21U. S. C. $$ 321(g)-(h), 393 (1994 ed. and Supp. III). The Actdefines "drug" to include "articles (other than food) intendedto affect the structure or any function of the body." 21U. S. C. $ 321(g)(1)(C). It defines "device," in part, as "aninstrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, . . .or other similar or related article, including any component,part, or accessory, which is . . . intended to affect the structure or any function of the body." $ 321(h). The Act alsogrants the FDA the authority to regulate so-called "combination products," which "constitute a combination of a drug,device, or biological product." $ 353(g)(1). The FDA hasconstrued this provision as giving it the discretion to regu-late combination products as drugs, as devices, or as both.See 61 Fed. Reg. 44400 (1996).On August 11, 1995, the FDA published a proposed ruleconcerning the sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco tochildren and adolescents. 60 Fed. Reg. 41314-41787. Therule, which included several restrictions on the sale, distribu-tion, and advertisement of tobacco products, was designed toreduce the availability and attractiveness of tobacco productsto young people.Id., at 41314. A public comment periodfollowed, during which the FDA received over 700,000 sub529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN127Cite as: 529 U. S. 120 (2000)Opinion of the Courtmissions, more than "at any other time in its history on anyother subject." 61 Fed. Reg. 44418 (1996).On August 28, 1996, the FDA issued a final rule entitled"Regulations Restricting the Sale and Distribution of Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco to Protect Children and Ado-lescents."Id., at 44396. The FDA determined that nicotine is a "drug" and that cigarettes and smokeless tobaccoare "drug delivery devices," and therefore it had jurisdictionunder the FDCA to regulate tobacco products as customarilymarketed--that is, without manufacturer claims of therapeu-tic benefit.Id., at 44397, 44402. First, the FDA found thattobacco products " `affect the structure or any function ofthe body' " because nicotine "has significant pharmacologicaleffects." Id., at 44631. Specifically, nicotine "exerts psychoactive, or mood-altering, effects on the brain" that causeand sustain addiction, have both tranquilizing and stimulating effects, and control weight. Id., at 44631-44632. Second, the FDA determined that these effects were "intended"under the FDCA because they "are so widely known andforeseeable that [they] may be deemed to have been intendedby the manufacturers," id., at 44687; consumers use tobaccoproducts "predominantly or nearly exclusively" to obtainthese effects, id., at 44807; and the statements, research, andactions of manufacturers revealed that they "have `designed'cigarettes to provide pharmacologically active doses of nicotine to consumers," id., at 44849. Finally, the agency concluded that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are "combination products" because, in addition to containing nicotine,they include device components that deliver a controlledamount of nicotine to the body, id., at 45208-45216.Having resolved the jurisdictional question, the FDA nextexplained the policy justifications for its regulations, detailing the deleterious health effects associated with tobaccouse. It found that tobacco consumption was "the singleleading cause of preventable death in the United States."Id., at 44398. According to the FDA, "[m]ore than 400,000529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN128 FDA v. BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the Courtpeople die each year from tobacco-related illnesses, suchas cancer, respiratory illnesses, and heart disease."Ibid.The agency also determined that the only way to reduce theamount of tobacco-related illness and mortality was to reduce the level of addiction, a goal that could be accomplishedonly by preventing children and adolescents from starting touse tobacco. Id., at 44398-44399. The FDA found that 82%of adult smokers had their first cigarette before the age of18, and more than half had already become regular smokersby that age. Id., at 44398. It also found that children werebeginning to smoke at a younger age, that the prevalenceof youth smoking had recently increased, and that similarproblems existed with respect to smokeless tobacco. Id., at44398-44399. The FDA accordingly concluded that if "thenumber of children and adolescents who begin tobacco usecan be substantially diminished, tobacco-related illness canbe correspondingly reduced because data suggest that anyone who does not begin smoking in childhood or adolescenceis unlikely ever to begin." Id., at 44399.Based on these findings, the FDA promulgated regulationsconcerning tobacco products' promotion, labeling, and accessibility to children and adolescents. See id., at 44615-44618.The access regulations prohibit the sale of cigarettes orsmokeless tobacco to persons younger than 18; require retailers to verify through photo identification the age of all purchasers younger than 27; prohibit the sale of cigarettes inquantities smaller than 20; prohibit the distribution of freesamples; and prohibit sales through self-service displays andvending machines except in adult-only locations. Id., at44616-44617. The promotion regulations require that anyprint advertising appear in a black-and-white, text-only format unless the publication in which it appears is read almostexclusively by adults; prohibit outdoor advertising within1,000 feet of any public playground or school; prohibit thedistribution of any promotional items, such as T-shirts orhats, bearing the manufacturer's brand name; and prohibit a529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN129Cite as: 529 U. S. 120 (2000)Opinion of the Courtmanufacturer from sponsoring any athletic, musical, artistic,or other social or cultural event using its brand name.Id.,at 44617-44618. The labeling regulation requires that thestatement, "A Nicotine-Delivery Device for Persons 18 orOlder," appear on all tobacco product packages. Id., at44617.The FDA promulgated these regulations pursuant to itsauthority to regulate "restricted devices." See 21 U. S. C.$ 360j(e). The FDA construed $ 353(g)(1) as giving it thediscretion to regulate "combination products" using the Act'sdrug authorities, device authorities, or both, depending on"how the public health goals of the act can be best accomplished." 61 Fed. Reg. 44403 (1996). Given the greaterflexibility in the FDCA for the regulation of devices, theFDA determined that "the device authorities provide themost appropriate basis for regulating cigarettes and smokeless tobacco." Id., at 44404. Under 21 U. S. C. $ 360j(e), theagency may "require that a device be restricted to sale, distribution, or use . . . upon such other conditions as [the FDA]may prescribe in such regulation, if, because of its potentiality for harmful effect or the collateral measures necessary toits use, [the FDA] determines that there cannot otherwisebe reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness."The FDA reasoned that its regulations fell within the authority granted by $ 360j(e) because they related to the saleor distribution of tobacco products and were necessary forproviding a reasonable assurance of safety. 61 Fed. Reg.44405-44407 (1996).Respondents, a group of tobacco manufacturers, retailers,and advertisers, filed suit in United States District Court forthe Middle District of North Carolina challenging the regulations. See Coyne Beahm, Inc. v. FDA, 966 F. Supp. 1374(1997). They moved for summary judgment on the groundsthat the FDA lacked jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products as customarily marketed, the regulations exceeded theFDA's authority under 21 U. S. C. $ 360j(e), and the advertis529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN130 FDA v. BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the Courting restrictions violated the First Amendment.

The District Courtgranted respondents' motion in part and denied it in part.966 F. Supp., at 1400. The court held that the FDCA au-thorizes the FDA to regulate tobacco products as customarily marketed and that the FDA's access and labeling regu-lations are permissible, but it also found that the agency'sadvertising and promotion restrictions exceed its authority under $ 360j(e). Id., at 1380-1400. The court stayed implementation of the regulations it found valid (except theprohibition on the sale of tobacco products to minors) andcertified its order for immediate interlocutory appeal. Id.,at 1400-1401.The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed,holding that Congress has not granted the FDA jurisdictionto regulate tobacco products. See 153 F. 3d 155 (1998). Examining the FDCA as a whole, the court concluded that theFDA's regulation of tobacco products would create a numberof internal inconsistencies. Id., at 162-167. Various provisions of the Act require the agency to determine that anyregulated product is "safe" before it can be sold or allowed toremain on the market, yet the FDA found in its rulemakingproceeding that tobacco products are "dangerous" and "unsafe." Id., at 164-167. Thus, the FDA would apparentlyhave to ban tobacco products, a result the court found clearlycontrary to congressional intent. Ibid. This apparentanomaly, the Court of Appeals concluded, demonstrates thatCongress did not intend to give the FDA authority to regulate tobacco. Id., at 167. The court also found that evidence external to the FDCA confirms this conclusion. Importantly, the FDA consistently stated before 1995 that itlacked jurisdiction over tobacco, and Congress has enacted529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN131Cite as: 529 U. S. 120 (2000)Opinion of the Courtseveral tobacco-specific statutes fully cognizant of the FDA'sposition. See id., at 168-176. In fact, the court reasoned,Congress has considered and rejected many bills that wouldhave given the agency such authority. See id., at 170-171.This, along with the absence of any intent by the enactingCongress in 1938 to subject tobacco products to regulationunder the FDCA, demonstrates that Congress intended towithhold such authority from the FDA.Id., at 167-176.Having resolved the jurisdictional question against theagency, the Court of Appeals did not address whether theregulations exceed the FDA's authority under 21 U. S. C.$ 360j(e) or violate the First Amendment. See 153 F. 3d, at176, n. 29.We granted the federal parties' petition for certiorari, 526U. S. 1086 (1999), to determine whether the FDA has authority under the FDCA to regulate tobacco products as custom-arily marketed.IIThe FDA's assertion of jurisdiction to regulate tobaccoproducts is founded on its conclusions that nicotine is a"drug" and that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are "drugdelivery devices." Again, the FDA found that tobacco products are "intended" to deliver the pharmacological effectsof satisfying addiction, stimulation and tranquilization, andweight control because those effects are foreseeable to anyreasonable manufacturer, consumers use tobacco productsto obtain those effects, and tobacco manufacturers have de-signed their products to produce those effects. 61 Fed. Reg.44632-44633 (1996). As an initial matter, respondents takeissue with the FDA's reading of "intended," arguing that itis a term of art that refers exclusively to claims made by themanufacturer or vendor about the product. See Brief forRespondent Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. 6. That is,a product is not a drug or device under the FDCA unless themanufacturer or vendor makes some express claim concern-ing the product's therapeutic benefits. Seeid., at 6-7. We529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN132 FDA v. BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the Courtneed not resolve this question, however, because assuming,arguendo, that a product can be "intended to affect the structure or any function of the body" absent claims of therapeuticor medical benefit, the FDA's claim to jurisdiction contravenes the clear intent of Congress.A threshold issue is the appropriate framework for analyzing the FDA's assertion of authority to regulate tobaccoproducts. Because this case involves an administrativeagency's construction of a statute that it administers, ouranalysis is governed by Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984). UnderChevron, a reviewing court must first ask "whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue."Id., at 842. If Congress has done so, the inquiry is at anend; the court "must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress." Id., at 843; see also UnitedStates v. Haggar Apparel Co., 526 U. S. 380, 392 (1999); HollyFarms Corp. v. NLRB, 517 U. S. 392, 398 (1996). But if Congress has not specifically addressed the question, a reviewingcourt must respect the agency's construction of the statuteso long as it is permissible. See INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre,526 U. S. 415, 424 (1999); Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 457(1997). Such deference is justified because "[t]he responsibilities for assessing the wisdom of such policy choices andresolving the struggle between competing views of the public interest are not judicial ones," Chevron, supra, at 866, andbecause of the agency's greater familiarity with the everchanging facts and circumstances surrounding the subjectsregulated, see Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173, 187 (1991).In determining whether Congress has specifically addressed the question at issue, a reviewing court should notconfine itself to examining a particular statutory provisionin isolation. The meaning--or ambiguity--of certain wordsor phrases may only become evident when placed in context.See Brown v. Gardner, 513 U. S. 115, 118 (1994) ("Ambiguityis a creature not of definitional possibilities but of statutory529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN133Cite as: 529 U. S. 120 (2000)Opinion of the Courtcontext"). It is a "fundamental canon of statutory construc-tion that the words of a statute must be read in their contextand with a view to their place in the overall statutoryscheme." Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S.803, 809 (1989). A court must therefore interpret the stat-ute "as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme,"Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 569 (1995), and "fit, ifpossible, all parts into an harmonious whole,"FTC v. MandelBrothers, Inc., 359 U. S. 385, 389 (1959). Similarly, themeaning of one statute may be affected by other Acts, partic-ularly where Congress has spoken subsequently and morespecifically to the topic at hand. See United States v. Estateof Romani, 523 U. S. 517, 530-531 (1998); United States v.Fausto, 484 U. S. 439, 453 (1988). In addition, we must beguided to a degree by common sense as to the manner inwhich Congress is likely to delegate a policy decision of sucheconomic and political magnitude to an administrativeagency. Cf. MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. AmericanTelephone & Telegraph Co., 512 U. S. 218, 231 (1994).With these principles in mind, we find that Congress hasdirectly spoken to the issue here and precluded the FDA'sjurisdiction to regulate tobacco products.AViewing the FDCA as a whole, it is evident that one of theAct's core objectives is to ensure that any product regulatedby the FDA is "safe" and "effective" for its intended use.See 21 U. S. C. $ 393(b)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. III) (defining theFDA's mission); More Information for Better Patient Care:Hearing before the Senate Committee on Labor and HumanResources, 104th Cong., 2d Sess., 83 (1996) (statement ofFDA Deputy Comm'r Schultz) ("A fundamental precept ofdrug and device regulation in this country is that these prod-ucts must be proven safe and effective before they can besold"). This essential purpose pervades the FDCA. Forinstance, 21 U. S. C. $ 393(b)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. III) defines529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN134 FDA v. BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the Courtthe FDA's "[m]ission" to include "protect[ing] the publichealth by ensuring that . . . drugs are safe and effective"and that "there is reasonable assurance of the safety andeffectiveness of devices intended for human use." TheFDCA requires premarket approval of any new drug, withsome limited exceptions, and states that the FDA "shallissue an order refusing to approve the application" of a newdrug if it is not safe and effective for its intended purpose.$$ 355(d)(1)-(2), (4)-(5). If the FDA discovers after approvalthat a drug is unsafe or ineffective, it "shall, after due noticeand opportunity for hearing to the applicant, withdraw approval" of the drug. 21 U. S. C. $$ 355(e)(1)-(3). The Actalso requires the FDA to classify all devices into one of threecategories. $ 360c(b)(1). Regardless of which category theFDA chooses, there must be a "reasonable assurance ofthe safety and effectiveness of the device." 21 U. S. C.$$ 360c(a)(1)(A)(i), (B), (C) (1994 ed. and Supp. III); 61 Fed.Reg. 44412 (1996). Even the "restricted device" provisionpursuant to which the FDA promulgated the regulations atissue here authorizes the agency to place conditions on thesale or distribution of a device specifically when "there cannot otherwise be reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness." 21 U. S. C. $ 360j(e). Thus, the Act generally requires the FDA to prevent the marketing of any drug ordevice where the "potential for inflicting death or physicalinjury is not offset by the possibility of therapeutic benefit."United States v. Rutherford, 442 U. S. 544, 556 (1979).In its rulemaking proceeding, the FDA quite exhaustivelydocumented that "tobacco products are unsafe," "dangerous," and "cause great pain and suffering from illness." 61Fed. Reg. 44412 (1996). It found that the consumption oftobacco products presents "extraordinary health risks," andthat "tobacco use is the single leading cause of preventabledeath in the United States." Id., at 44398. It stated that"[m]ore than 400,000 people die each year from tobaccorelated illnesses, such as cancer, respiratory illnesses, and529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN135Cite as: 529 U. S. 120 (2000)Opinion of the Courtheart disease, often suffering long and painful deaths," andthat "[t]obacco alone kills more people each year in theUnited States than acquired immunodeficiency syndrome(AIDS), car accidents, alcohol, homicides, illegal drugs, suicides, and fires, combined." Ibid. Indeed, the FDA charac-terized smoking as "a pediatric disease,"id., at 44421, because "one out of every three young people who becomeregular smokers . . . will die prematurely as a result," id.,at 44399.These findings logically imply that, if tobacco productswere "devices" under the FDCA, the FDA would be requiredto remove them from the market. Consider, first, theFDCA's provisions concerning the misbranding of drugs ordevices. The Act prohibits "[t]he introduction or deliveryfor introduction into interstate commerce of any food, drug,device, or cosmetic that is adulterated or misbranded." 21U. S. C. $ 331(a). In light of the FDA's findings, two distinctFDCA provisions would render cigarettes and smokeless tobacco misbranded devices. First, $ 352( j) deems a drug ordevice misbranded "[i]f it is dangerous to health when usedin the dosage or manner, or with the frequency or durationprescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labelingthereof." The FDA's findings make clear that tobacco products are "dangerous to health" when used in the manner prescribed. Second, a drug or device is misbranded under theAct "[u]nless its labeling bears . . . adequate directions foruse . . . in such manner and form, as are necessary forthe protection of users," except where such directions are"not necessary for the protection of the public health."$ 352(f)(1). Given the FDA's conclusions concerning thehealth consequences of tobacco use, there are no directionsthat could adequately protect consumers. That is, there areno directions that could make tobacco products safe for obtaining their intended effects. Thus, were tobacco productswithin the FDA's jurisdiction, the Act would deem them misbranded devices that could not be introduced into interstate529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN136 FDA v. BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the Courtcommerce. Contrary to the dissent's contention, the Act admits no remedial discretion once it is evident that the deviceis misbranded.Second, the FDCA requires the FDA to place all devicesthat it regulates into one of three classifications. See$ 360c(b)(1). The agency relies on a device's classification indetermining the degree of control and regulation necessaryto ensure that there is "a reasonable assurance of safety andeffectiveness." 61 Fed. Reg. 44412 (1996). The FDA hasyet to classify tobacco products. Instead, the regulations atissue here represent so-called "general controls," which theAct entitles the agency to impose in advance of classification.See id., at 44404-44405. Although the FDCA prescribes nodeadline for device classification, the FDA has stated that itwill classify tobacco products "in a future rulemaking" asrequired by the Act. Id., at 44412. Given the FDA's findings regarding the health consequences of tobacco use, theagency would have to place cigarettes and smokeless tobaccoin Class III because, even after the application of the Act'savailable controls, they would "presen[t] a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury." 21 U. S. C. $ 360c(a)(1)(C).As Class III devices, tobacco products would be subject tothe FDCA's premarket approval process. See 21 U. S. C.$ 360c(a)(1)(C) (1994 ed., Supp. III); 21 U. S. C. $ 360e; 61Fed. Reg. 44412 (1996). Under these provisions, the FDAwould be prohibited from approving an application for premarket approval without "a showing of reasonable assurancethat such device is safe under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labelingthereof." 21 U. S. C. $ 360e(d)(2)(A). In view of the FDA'sconclusions regarding the health effects of tobacco use, theagency would have no basis for finding any such reasonableassurance of safety. Thus, once the FDA fulfilled its statutory obligation to classify tobacco products, it could not allowthem to be marketed.529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN137Cite as: 529 U. S. 120 (2000)Opinion of the CourtThe FDCA's misbranding and device classification provi-sions therefore make evident that were the FDA to regulatecigarettes and smokeless tobacco, the Act would require theagency to ban them. In fact, based on these provisions, theFDA itself has previously taken the position that if tobaccoproducts were within its jurisdiction, "they would have tobe removed from the market because it would be impossible to prove they were safe for their intended us[e]." Pub-lic Health Cigarette Amendments of 1971: Hearings beforethe Commerce Subcommittee on S. 1454, 92d Cong., 2d Sess.,239 (1972) (hereinafter 1972 Hearings) (statement of FDAComm'r Charles Edwards).

A provision of the United StatesCode currently in force states that "[t]he marketing of tobacco constitutes one of the greatest basic industries of theUnited States with ramifying activities which directly affectinterstate and foreign commerce at every point, and stableconditions therein are necessary to the general welfare." 7U.

BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the CourtHealth Administration Reorganization Act, Pub. L. 102-321,$ 202, 106 Stat. 394. When Congress enacted these statutes,the adverse health consequences of tobacco use were wellknown, as were nicotine's pharmacological effects. See,e. g.,U. S. Dept. of Health, Education, and Welfare, U. S. SurgeonGeneral's Advisory Committee, Smoking and Health 25-40,69-75 (1964) (hereinafter 1964 Surgeon General's Report)(concluding that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer, coro-nary artery disease, and chronic bronchitis and emphysema,and that nicotine has various pharmacological effects, includ-ing stimulation, tranquilization, and appetite suppression);U. S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Public HealthService, Health Consequences of Smoking for Women 7-12(1980) (finding that mortality rates for lung cancer, chroniclung disease, and coronary heart disease are increased forboth women and men smokers, and that smoking duringpregnancy is associated with significant adverse health effects on the unborn fetus and newborn child); U.

R. 1824 before the Subcommitteeon Health and the Environment of the House Committee onEnergy and Commerce, 98th Cong., 1st Sess., 32-37 (1983)(hereinafter 1983 House Hearings) (stating that smoking is"the most widespread example of drug dependence in ourcountry," and that cigarettes "affect the chemistry of thebrain and nervous system"); U.

Nonetheless, Congress stopped well short of orderinga ban. Instead, it has generally regulated the labeling andadvertisement of tobacco products, expressly providing thatit is the policy of Congress that "commerce and the national529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN139Cite as: 529 U. S. 120 (2000)Opinion of the Courteconomy may be . . . protected to the maximum extent con-sistent with" consumers "be[ing] adequately informed aboutany adverse health effects." 15 U. S. C. $ 1331. Congress'decisions to regulate labeling and advertising and to adoptthe express policy of protecting "commerce and the nationaleconomy . . . to the maximum extent" reveal its intent thattobacco products remain on the market. Indeed, the collective premise of these statutes is that cigarettes and smoke-less tobacco will continue to be sold in the United States. Aban of tobacco products by the FDA would therefore plainlycontradict congressional policy.The FDA apparently recognized this dilemma and concluded, somewhat ironically, that tobacco products are actually "safe" within the meaning of the FDCA. In promulgating its regulations, the agency conceded that "tobaccoproducts are unsafe, as that term is conventionally understood." 61 Fed. Reg. 44412 (1996). Nonetheless, the FDAreasoned that, in determining whether a device is safe underthe Act, it must consider "not only the risks presented by aproduct but also any of the countervailing effects of use ofthat product, including the consequences of not permittingthe product to be marketed." Id., at 44412-44413. Applying this standard, the FDA found that, because of the highlevel of addiction among tobacco users, a ban would likely be"dangerous." Id., at 44413. In particular, current tobaccousers could suffer from extreme withdrawal, the health caresystem and available pharmaceuticals might not be able tomeet the treatment demands of those suffering from withdrawal, and a black market offering cigarettes even moredangerous than those currently sold legally would likely develop. Ibid. The FDA therefore concluded that, "whiletaking cigarettes and smokeless tobacco off the market couldprevent some people from becoming addicted and reducedeath and disease for others, the record does not establishthat such a ban is the appropriate public health responseunder the act." Id., at 44398.529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN140 FDA v. BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the CourtIt may well be, as the FDA asserts, that "these factorsmust be considered when developing a regulatory schemethat achieves the best public health result for these products." Id., at 44413. But the FDA's judgment that leavingtobacco products on the market "is more effective in achieving public health goals than a ban," ibid., is no substitute forthe specific safety determinations required by the FDCA'svarious operative provisions. Several provisions in the Actrequire the FDA to determine that the product itself is safeas used by consumers. That is, the product's probable therapeutic benefits must outweigh its risk of harm. See UnitedStates v. Rutherford, 442 U. S., at 555 ("[T]he Commissionergenerally considers a drug safe when the expected therapeutic gain justifies the risk entailed by its use"). In contrast,the FDA's conception of safety would allow the agency, withrespect to each provision of the FDCA that requires theagency to determine a product's "safety" or "dangerousness,"to compare the aggregate health effects of alternative administrative actions. This is a qualitatively different inquiry.Thus, although the FDA has concluded that a ban would be"dangerous," it has not concluded that tobacco products are"safe" as that term is used throughout the Act.Consider 21 U. S. C. $ 360c(a)(2), which specifies those factors that the FDA may consider in determining the safetyand effectiveness of a device for purposes of classification,performance standards, and premarket approval. For alldevices regulated by the FDA, there must at least be a "reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device." See 21 U. S. C. $$ 360c(a)(1)(A)(i), (B), (C) (1994 ed.and Supp. III); 61 Fed. Reg. 44412 (1996). Title 21 U. S. C.$ 360c(a)(2) provides that"the safety and effectiveness of a device are to bedetermined--"(A) with respect to the persons for whose use thedevice is represented or intended,529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN141Cite as: 529 U. S. 120 (2000)Opinion of the Court"(B) with respect to the conditions of use prescribed,recommended, or suggested in the labeling of the device, and"(C) weighing any probable benefit to health from theuse of the device against any probable risk of injury orillness from such use."A straightforward reading of this provision dictates that theFDA must weigh the probable therapeutic benefits of thedevice to the consumer against the probable risk of injury.Applied to tobacco products, the inquiry is whether theirpurported benefits--satisfying addiction, stimulation andsedation, and weight control--outweigh the risks to healthfrom their use. To accommodate the FDA's conception ofsafety, however, one must read "any probable benefit tohealth" to include the benefit to public health stemming fromadult consumers' continued use of tobacco products, eventhough the reduction of tobacco use is the raison d'e^tre ofthe regulations. In other words, the FDA is forced to contend that the very evil it seeks to combat is a "benefit tohealth." This is implausible.The FDA's conception of safety is also incompatible withthe FDCA's misbranding provision. Again, $ 352( j) provides that a product is "misbranded" if "it is dangerous tohealth when used in the dosage or manner, or with the frequency or duration prescribed, recommended, or suggestedin the labeling thereof." According to the FDA's understanding, a product would be "dangerous to health," andtherefore misbranded under $ 352( j), when, in comparison toleaving the product on the market, a ban would not produce"adverse health consequences" in aggregate. Quite simply,these are different inquiries. Although banning a particularproduct might be detrimental to public health in aggregate,the product could still be "dangerous to health" when usedas directed. Section 352( j) focuses on dangers to the consumer from use of the product, not those stemming from theagency's remedial measures.529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN142 FDA v. BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the CourtConsequently, the analogy made by the FDA and the dis-sent to highly toxic drugs used in the treatment of variouscancers is unpersuasive. See 61 Fed. Reg. 44413 (1996);post, at 177 (opinion of Although "dangerous"in some sense, these drugs are safe within the meaning ofthe Act because, for certain patients, the therapeutic benefitsoutweigh the risk of harm. Accordingly, such drugs cannotproperly be described as "dangerous to health" under 21U. S. C. $ 352( j). The same is not true for tobacco products.As the FDA has documented in great detail, cigarettes andsmokeless tobacco are an unsafe means to obtaininganypharmacological effect.The dissent contends that our conclusion means that "theFDCA requires the FDA to ban outright `dangerous' drugsor devices," post, at 174, and that this is a "perverse" readingof the statute, post, at 174, 180. This misunderstands ourholding. The FDA, consistent with the FDCA, may clearlyregulate many "dangerous" products without banning them.Indeed, virtually every drug or device poses dangers undercertain conditions. What the FDA may not do is concludethat a drug or device cannot be used safely for any therapeutic purpose and yet, at the same time, allow that product toremain on the market. Such regulation is incompatible withthe FDCA's core objective of ensuring that every drug ordevice is safe and effective.Considering the FDCA as a whole, it is clear that Congress intended to exclude tobacco products from the FDA'sjurisdiction. A fundamental precept of the FDCA is thatany product regulated by the FDA--but not banned--mustbe safe for its intended use. Various provisions of the Actmake clear that this refers to the safety of using the productto obtain its intended effects, not the public health ramifications of alternative administrative actions by the FDA.That is, the FDA must determine that there is a reasonableassurance that the product's therapeutic benefits outweighthe risk of harm to the consumer. According to this stand529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN143Cite as: 529 U. S. 120 (2000)Opinion of the Courtard, the FDA has concluded that, although tobacco productsmight be effective in delivering certain pharmacological effects, they are "unsafe" and "dangerous" when used for thesepurposes. Consequently, if tobacco products were withinthe FDA's jurisdiction, the Act would require the FDA toremove them from the market entirely. But a ban wouldcontradict Congress' clear intent as expressed in its morerecent, tobacco-specific legislation. The inescapable conclusion is that there is no room for tobacco products within theFDCA's regulatory scheme. If they cannot be used safelyfor any therapeutic purpose, and yet they cannot be banned,they simply do not fit.BIn determining whether Congress has spoken directly tothe FDA's authority to regulate tobacco, we must also consider in greater detail the tobacco-specific legislation thatCongress has enacted over the past 35 years. At the time astatute is enacted, it may have a range of plausible meanings.Over time, however, subsequent acts can shape or focusthose meanings. The "classic judicial task of reconcilingmany laws enacted over time, and getting them to `makesense' in combination, necessarily assumes that the implica-tions of a statute may be altered by the implications of alater statute." United States v. Fausto, 484 U. S., at 453.This is particularly so where the scope of the earlier statuteis broad but the subsequent statutes more specifically ad-dress the topic at hand. As we recognized recently inUnited States v. Estate of Romani, "a specific policy embod-ied in a later federal statute should control our constructionof the [earlier] statute, even though it ha[s] not been ex-pressly amended." 523 U. S., at 530-531.Congress has enacted six separate pieces of legislationsince 1965 addressing the problem of tobacco use and humanhealth. See supra, at 137-138. Those statutes, amongother things, require that health warnings appear on allpackaging and in all print and outdoor advertisements, see529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN144 FDA v. BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the Court15 U. S. C. $$ 1331, 1333, 4402; prohibit the advertisement oftobacco products through "any medium of electronic communication" subject to regulation by the Federal Communica-tions Commission (FCC), see $$ 1335, 4402(f); require theSecretary of HHS to report every three years to Congresson research findings concerning "the addictive property oftobacco," 42 U. S. C. $ 290aa-2(b)(2); and make States' receiptof certain federal block grants contingent on their makingit unlawful "for any manufacturer, retailer, or distributor oftobacco products to sell or distribute any such product to anyindividual under the age of 18," $ 300x-26(a)(1).In adopting each statute, Congress has acted against thebackdrop of the FDA's consistent and repeated statementsthat it lacked authority under the FDCA to regulate tobaccoabsent claims of therapeutic benefit by the manufacturer.In fact, on several occasions over this period, and after thehealth consequences of tobacco use and nicotine's pharmacological effects had become well known, Congress consideredand rejected bills that would have granted the FDA suchjurisdiction. Under these circumstances, it is evident thatCongress' tobacco-specific statutes have effectively ratifiedthe FDA's long-held position that it lacks jurisdiction underthe FDCA to regulate tobacco products. Congress hascreated a distinct regulatory scheme to address the problemof tobacco and health, and that scheme, as presently constructed, precludes any role for the FDA.On January 11, 1964, the Surgeon General released thereport of the Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health.That report documented the deleterious health effects ofsmoking in great detail, concluding, in relevant part, "thatcigarette smoking contributes substantially to mortalityfrom certain specific diseases and to the overall death rate."1964 Surgeon General's Report 31. It also identified thepharmacological effects of nicotine, including "stimulation,""tranquilization," and "suppression of appetite." Id., at 74-75. Seven days after the report's release, the Federal Trade529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN145Cite as: 529 U. S. 120 (2000)Opinion of the CourtCommission (FTC) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking,see 29 Fed. Reg. 530-532 (1964), and in June 1964, the FTCpromulgated a final rule requiring cigarette manufacturers"to disclose, clearly and prominently, in all advertising andon every pack, box, carton or other container . . . that ciga-rette smoking is dangerous to health and may cause deathfrom cancer and other diseases," id., at 8325. The rule wasto become effective January 1, 1965, but, on a request fromCongress, the FTC postponed enforcement for six months.See Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, 513-514(1992).In response to the Surgeon General's report and the FTC'sproposed rule, Congress convened hearings to consider legislation addressing "the tobacco problem." 1964 Hearings 1.During those deliberations, FDA representatives testifiedbefore Congress that the agency lacked jurisdiction underthe FDCA to regulate tobacco products. Surgeon GeneralTerry was asked during hearings in 1964 whether HEW hadthe "authority to brand or label the packages of cigarettes orto control the advertising there." Id., at 56. The SurgeonGeneral stated that "we do not have such authority in existing laws governing the . . . Food and Drug Administration."Ibid. Similarly, FDA Deputy Commissioner Rankin testified in 1965 that "[t]he Food and Drug Administration has nojurisdiction under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act overtobacco, unless it bears drug claims." Cigarette Labelingand Advertising--1965: Hearings on H. R. 2248 before theHouse Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 89thCong., 1st Sess., 193 (hereinafter 1965 Hearings). See alsoLetter to Directors of Bureaus, Divisions and Directors ofDistricts from FDA Bureau of Enforcement (May 24, 1963),in 1972 Hearings 240 ("[T]obacco marketed for chewing orsmoking without accompanying therapeutic claims, does notmeet the definitions in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act forfood, drug, device or cosmetic"). In fact, HEW SecretaryCelebrezze urged Congress not to amend the FDCA to cover529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN146 FDA v. BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the Court"smoking products" because, in light of the findings in theSurgeon General's report, such a "provision might well completely outlaw at least cigarettes. This would be contraryto what, we understand, is intended or what, in the light ofour experience with the 18th amendment, would be accept-able to the American people." 1964 Hearings 18.The FDA's disavowal of jurisdiction was consistent withthe position that it had taken since the agency's inception.As the FDA concedes, it never asserted authority to regulatetobacco products as customarily marketed until it promul-gated the regulations at issue here. See Brief for Petitioners 37; see also Brief for Appellee (FDA) in Action on Smoking and Health v. Harris, 655 F. 2d 236 (CADC 1980), in 9Rec. in No. 97-1604 (CA4), Tab No. 4, pp. 14-15 ("In the 73years since the enactment of the original Food and Drug Act,and in the 41 years since the promulgation of the modernFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the FDA has repeatedly informed Congress that cigarettes are beyond the scope of thestatute absent health claims establishing a therapeutic intenton behalf of the manufacturer or vendor").The FDA's position was also consistent with Congress'specific intent when it enacted the FDCA. Before the Act'sadoption in 1938, the FDA's predecessor agency, the Bureauof Chemistry, announced that it lacked authority to regulatetobacco products under the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906,ch. 3915, 34 Stat. 768, unless they were marketed with therapeutic claims. See U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, Bureau ofChemistry, 13 Service and Regulatory Announcements 24(Apr. 1914) (Feb. 1914 Announcements || 13, Opinion of Chiefof Bureau C. L. Alsberg). In 1929, Congress considered andrejected a bill "[t]o amend the Food and Drugs Act of June30, 1906, by extending its provisions to tobacco and tobaccoproducts." S. 1468, 71st Cong., 1st Sess., 1. See also 71Cong. Rec. 2589 (1929) (remarks of Sen. Smoot). And, as theFDA admits, there is no evidence in the text of the FDCA orits legislative history that Congress in 1938 even considered529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN147Cite as: 529 U. S. 120 (2000)Opinion of the Courtthe applicability of the Act to tobacco products. See Brieffor Petitioners 22, n. 4. Given the economic and politicalsignificance of the tobacco industry at the time, it is ex-tremely unlikely that Congress could have intended to placetobacco within the ambit of the FDCA absent any discussionof the matter. Of course, whether the Congress thatenacted the FDCA specifically intended the Act to cover tobacco products is not determinative; "it is ultimately the pro-visions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of ourlegislators by which we are governed." Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 79 (1998); seealso TVA v. Hill, 437 U. S. 153, 185 (1978) ("It is not for usto speculate, much less act, on whether Congress would havealtered its stance had the specific events of this case beenanticipated"). Nonetheless, this intent is certainly relevantto understanding the basis for the FDA's representationsto Congress and the background against which Congressenacted subsequent tobacco-specific legislation.Moreover, before enacting the FCLAA in 1965, Congressconsidered and rejected several proposals to give the FDAthe authority to regulate tobacco. In April 1963, Representative Udall introduced a bill "[t]o amend the FederalFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act so as to make that Act applicable to smoking products." H. R. 5973, 88th Cong., 1st Sess.,1. Two months later, Senator Moss introduced an identicalbill in the Senate. S. 1682, 88th Cong., 1st Sess. (1963). Indiscussing his proposal on the Senate floor, Senator Mossexplained that "this amendment simply places smoking products under FDA jurisdiction, along with foods, drugs, andcosmetics." 109 Cong. Rec. 10322 (1963). In December1963, Representative Rhodes introduced another bill thatwould have amended the FDCA "by striking out `food, drug,device, or cosmetic, each place where it appears therein andinserting in lieu thereof `food, drug, device, cosmetic, orsmoking product.' " H. R. 9512, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., $ 3(1963). And in January 1965, five months before passage of529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN148 FDA v. BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the Courtthe FCLAA, Representative Udall again introduced a bill toamend the FDCA "to make that Act applicable to smokingproducts." H. R. 2248, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 1. None ofthese proposals became law.Congress ultimately decided in 1965 to subject tobaccoproducts to the less extensive regulatory scheme of theFCLAA, which created a "comprehensive Federal programto deal with cigarette labeling and advertising with respectto any relationship between smoking and health." Pub. L.89-92, $ 2, 79 Stat. 282. The FCLAA rejected any regula-tion of advertising, but it required the warning, "Caution:Cigarette Smoking May Be Hazardous to Your Health," toappear on all cigarette packages. Id., $ 4, 79 Stat. 283. Inthe FCLAA's "Declaration of Policy," Congress stated thatits objective was to balance the goals of ensuring that "thepublic may be adequately informed that cigarette smokingmay be hazardous to health" and protecting "commerce andthe national economy . . . to the maximum extent." Id., $ 2,79 Stat. 282 (codified at 15 U. S. C. $ 1331).Not only did Congress reject the proposals to grant theFDA jurisdiction, but it explicitly pre-empted any other regulation of cigarette labeling: "No statement relating to smoking and health, other than the statement required by . . . thisAct, shall be required on any cigarette package." Pub. L.89-92, $ 5(a), 79 Stat. 283. The regulation of product labeling, however, is an integral aspect of the FDCA, both as itexisted in 1965 and today. The labeling requirements currently imposed by the FDCA, which are essentially identicalto those in force in 1965, require the FDA to regulate thelabeling of drugs and devices to protect the safety of consumers. See 21 U. S. C. $ 352; 21 U. S. C. $ 352 (1964 ed. andSupp. IV). As discussed earlier, the Act requires that allproducts bear "adequate directions for use . . . as are necessary for the protection of users," 21 U. S. C. $ 352(f )(1); 21U. S. C. $ 352(f )(1) (1964 ed.); requires that all products provide "adequate warnings against use in those pathological529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN149Cite as: 529 U.

S. C. $ 352( j); 21 U. S. C.$ 352( j) (1964 ed.). In this sense, the FCLAA was--and remains--incompatible with FDA regulation of tobacco prod-ucts. This is not to say that the FCLAA's pre-emption provision by itself necessarily foreclosed FDA jurisdiction. SeeCipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S., at 518-519. Butit is an important factor in assessing whether Congressratified the agency's position--that is, whether Congressadopted a regulatory approach to the problem of tobacco andhealth that contemplated no role for the FDA.Further, the FCLAA evidences Congress' intent to preclude any administrative agency from exercising significantpolicymaking authority on the subject of smoking and health.In addition to prohibiting any additional requirements forcigarette labeling, the FCLAA provided that "[n]o statementrelating to smoking and health shall be required in the advertising of any cigarettes the packages of which are labeledin conformity with the provisions of this Act." Pub. L. 89-92, $ 5(b), 79 Stat. 283. Thus, in reaction to the FTC's attempt to regulate cigarette labeling and advertising, Congress enacted a statute reserving exclusive control over bothsubjects to itself.Subsequent tobacco-specific legislation followed a similarpattern. By the FCLAA's own terms, the prohibition onany additional cigarette labeling or advertising regulationsrelating to smoking and health was to expire July 1, 1969.See $ 10, 79 Stat. 284. In anticipation of the provision's expiration, both the FCC and the FTC proposed rules governingthe advertisement of cigarettes. See 34 Fed. Reg. 1959(1969) (FCC proposed rule to "ban the broadcast of cigarettecommercials by radio and television stations"); id., at 7917529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN150 FDA v.

After debating theproper role for administrative agencies in the regulation oftobacco, see generally Cigarette Labeling and Advertising--1969: Hearings before the House Committee on Interstateand Foreign Commerce, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 2 (1969),Congress amended the FCLAA by banning cigarette adver-tisements "on any medium of electronic communication subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission" and strengthening the warning required to appearon cigarette packages. Public Health Cigarette SmokingAct of 1969, Pub. L. 91-222, $$ 4, 6, 84 Stat. 88-89. Importantly, Congress extended indefinitely the prohibition on anyother regulation of cigarette labeling with respect to smoking and health (again despite the importance of labeling regulation under the FDCA). $ 5(a), 84 Stat. 88 (codified at 15U. S. C. $ 1334(a)). Moreover, it expressly forbade the FTCfrom taking any action on its pending rule until July 1, 1971,and it required the FTC, if it decided to proceed with its rulethereafter, to notify Congress at least six months in advanceof the rule's becoming effective. $ 7(a), 84 Stat. 89.

Staggers).Four years later, after Congress had transferred the authority to regulate substances covered by the HazardousSubstances Act (HSA) from the FDA to the Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC), the American Public HealthAssociation, joined by Senator Moss, petitioned the CPSC toregulate cigarettes yielding more than 21 milligrams of tar.See Action on Smoking and Health v.

Kluger, Ashes to Ashes 375-376 (1996).After the CPSC determined that it lacked authority underthe HSA to regulate cigarettes, a District Court held thatthe HSA did, in fact, grant the CPSC such jurisdictionand ordered it to reexamine the petition. See AmericanPublic Health Association v. Consumer Product SafetyCommission, [1972-1975 Transfer Binder] CCH ConsumerProd. Safety Guide || 75,081 (DC 1975), vacated as moot,No. 75-1863 (CADC 1976). Before the CPSC could take anyaction, however, Congress mooted the issue by adopting leg-islation that eliminated the agency's authority to regulate"tobacco and tobacco products." Consumer Product SafetyCommission Improvements Act of 1976, Pub. L. 94-284,$ 3(c), 90 Stat. 503 (codified at 15 U. S. C. $ 1261(f)(2)). Senator Moss acknowledged that the "legislation, in effect, reverse[d]" the District Court's decision, 121 Cong. Rec. 23563(1975), and the FDA later observed that the episode was"particularly" "indicative of the policy of Congress to limitthe regulatory authority over cigarettes by Federal Agencies," Letter to Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) Executive Director Banzhaf from FDA Comm'r Goyan (Nov. 25,1980), App. 59. A separate statement in the Senate Reportunderscored that the legislation's purpose was to "unmistakably reaffirm the clear mandate of the Congress that thebasic regulation of tobacco and tobacco products is governedby the legislation dealing with the subject, . . . and that anyfurther regulation in this sensitive and complex area mustbe reserved for specific Congressional action." S. Rep.No. 94-251, p. 43 (1975) (additional views of Sens. Hartke,Hollings, Ford, Stevens, and Beall).Meanwhile, the FDA continued to maintain that it lackedjurisdiction under the FDCA to regulate tobacco products ascustomarily marketed. In 1972, FDA Commissioner Edwards testified before Congress that "cigarettes recommended for smoking pleasure are beyond the Federal Food,Drug, and Cosmetic Act." 1972 Hearings 239, 242. He fur529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN152 FDA v. BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the Courtther stated that the FDA believed that the Public HealthCigarette Smoking Act "demonstrates that the regulation ofcigarettes is to be the domain of Congress," and that "label-ing or banning cigarettes is a step that can be take[n] onlyby the Congress. Any such move by FDA would be incon-sistent with the clear congressional intent."Ibid.In 1977, ASH filed a citizen petition requesting that theFDA regulate cigarettes, citing many of the same groundsthat motivated the FDA's rulemaking here. See Citizen Petition, No. 77P-0185 (May 26, 1977), 10 Rec. in No. 97-1604(CA4), Tab No. 22, pp. 1-10. ASH asserted that nicotinewas highly addictive and had strong physiological effects onthe body; that those effects were "intended" because consumers use tobacco products precisely to obtain those effects; and that tobacco causes thousands of premature deathsannually. Ibid. In denying ASH's petition, FDA Commissioner Kennedy stated that "[t]he interpretation of the Actby FDA consistently has been that cigarettes are not a drugunless health claims are made by the vendors." Letter toASH Executive Director Banzhaf (Dec. 5, 1977), App. 47.After the matter proceeded to litigation, the FDA argued inits brief to the Court of Appeals that "cigarettes are notcomprehended within the statutory definition of the term`drug' absent objective evidence that vendors represent orintend that their products be used as a drug." Brief for Appellee in Action on Smoking and Health v. Harris, 655 F. 2d236 (CADC 1980), 9 Rec. in No. 97-1604 (CA4), Tab No. 4,at 27-28. The FDA also contended that Congress had "longbeen aware that the FDA does not consider cigarettes to bewithin its regulatory authority in the absence of healthclaims made on behalf of the manufacturer or vendor," andthat, because "Congress has never acted to disturb theagency's interpretation," it had "acquiesced in the FDA's interpretation of the statutory limits on its authority to regulate cigarettes." Id., at 23, 27, n. 23. The Court of Appealsupheld the FDA's position, concluding that "[i]f the statute529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN153Cite as: 529 U. S. 120 (2000)Opinion of the Courtrequires expansion, that is the job of Congress." Action onSmoking and Health v. Harris, 655 F. 2d, at 243. In 1980,the FDA also denied a request by ASH to commence rule-making proceedings to establish the agency's jurisdiction toregulate cigarettes as devices. See Letter to ASH Execu-tive Director Banzhaf from FDA Comm'r Goyan (Nov. 25,1980), App. 50-51. The agency stated that "[i]nsofar asrulemaking would relate to cigarettes or attached filters ascustomarily marketed, we have concluded that FDA has nojurisdiction under section 201(h) of the Act [21 U. S. C.$ 321(h)]."Id., at 67.In 1983, Congress again considered legislation on thesubject of smoking and health. HHS Assistant SecretaryBrandt testified that, in addition to being "a major cause ofcancer," smoking is a "major cause of heart disease" andother serious illnesses, and can result in "unfavorable pregnancy outcomes." 1983 House Hearings 19-20. He alsostated that it was "well-established that cigarette smoking is a drug dependence, and that smoking is addictive formany people." Id., at 20. Nonetheless, Assistant Secretary Brandt maintained that "the issue of regulation oftobacco . . . is something that Congress has reserved to itself,and we do not within the Department have the authority toregulate nor are we seeking such authority." Id., at 74. Healso testified before the Senate, stating that, despite the evidence of tobacco's health effects and addictiveness, the Department's view was that "Congress has assumed the responsibility of regulating . . . cigarettes." Smoking Preventionand Education Act: Hearings on S. 772 before the SenateCommittee on Labor and Human Resources, 98th Cong., 1stSess., 56 (1983) (hereinafter 1983 Senate Hearings).Against this backdrop, Congress enacted three additionaltobacco-specific statutes over the next four years that incrementally expanded its regulatory scheme for tobacco products. In 1983, Congress adopted the Alcohol and DrugAbuse Amendments, Pub. L. 98-24, 97 Stat. 175 (codified at529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN154 FDA v. BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the Court42 U. S. C. $ 290aa et seq.), which require the Secretary ofHHS to report to Congress every three years on the "addictive property of tobacco" and to include recommendations foraction that the Secretary may deem appropriate. A yearlater, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Smoking Educa-tion Act, Pub. L. 98-474, 98 Stat. 2200, which amended theFCLAA by again modifying the prescribed warning. Notably, during debate on the Senate floor, Senator Hawkinsargued that the FCLAA was necessary in part because"[u]nder the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Congressexempted tobacco products." 130 Cong. Rec. 26953 (1984).And in 1986, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986 (CSTHEA), Pub.L. 99-252, 100 Stat. 30 (codified at 15 U. S. C. $ 4401 et seq.),which essentially extended the regulatory provisions of theFCLAA to smokeless tobacco products. Like the FCLAA,the CSTHEA provided that "[n]o statement relating to theuse of smokeless tobacco products and health, other than thestatements required by [the Act], shall be required by anyFederal agency to appear on any package . . . of a smokelesstobacco product." $ 7(a), 100 Stat. 34 (codified at 15 U. S. C.$ 4406(a)). Thus, as with cigarettes, Congress reserved foritself an aspect of smokeless tobacco regulation that is particularly important to the FDCA's regulatory scheme.In 1988, the Surgeon General released a report summarizing the abundant scientific literature demonstrating that"[c]igarettes and other forms of tobacco are addicting," andthat "nicotine is psychoactive" and "causes physical dependence characterized by a withdrawal syndrome that usuallyaccompanies nicotine abstinence." 1988 Surgeon General'sReport 14. The report further concluded that the "pharmacologic and behavioral processes that determine tobacco addiction are similar to those that determine addiction to drugssuch as heroin and cocaine." Id., at 15. In the same year,FDA Commissioner Young stated before Congress that "itdoesn't look like it is possible to regulate [tobacco] under the529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN155Cite as: 529 U. S. 120 (2000)Opinion of the CourtFood, Drug and Cosmetic Act even though smoking, I think,has been widely recognized as being harmful to humanhealth." Rural Development, Agriculture, and RelatedAgencies Appropriations for 1989: Hearings before a Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations, 100thCong., 2d Sess., 409 (1988). At the same hearing, the FDA'sGeneral Counsel testified that "what is fairly important inFDA law is whether a product has a therapeutic purpose,"and "[c]igarettes themselves are not used for a therapeuticpurpose as that concept is ordinarily understood." Id., at410. Between 1987 and 1989, Congress considered threemore bills that would have amended the FDCA to grant theFDA jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products. See H. R.3294, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. (1987); H. R. 1494, 101st Cong.,1st Sess. (1989); S. 769, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. (1989). Asbefore, Congress rejected the proposals. In 1992, Congressinstead adopted the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental HealthAdministration Reorganization Act, Pub. L. 102-321, $ 202,106 Stat. 394 (codified at 42 U. S. C. $ 300x et seq.), whichcreates incentives for States to regulate the retail sale oftobacco products by making States' receipt of certain blockgrants contingent on their prohibiting the sale of tobaccoproducts to minors.Taken together, these actions by Congress over the past35 years preclude an interpretation of the FDCA that grantsthe FDA jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products. We donot rely on Congress' failure to act--its consideration andrejection of bills that would have given the FDA this authority--in reaching this conclusion. Indeed, this is not a caseof simple inaction by Congress that purportedly representsits acquiescence in an agency's position. To the contrary,Congress has enacted several statutes addressing the particular subject of tobacco and health, creating a distinct regulatory scheme for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. In doingso, Congress has been aware of tobacco's health hazards andits pharmacological effects. It has also enacted this legisla529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN156 FDA v. BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the Courttion against the background of the FDA repeatedly and con-sistently asserting that it lacks jurisdiction under the FDCAto regulate tobacco products as customarily marketed. Fur-ther, Congress has persistently acted to preclude a meaningful role for any administrative agency in making policy onthe subject of tobacco and health. Moreover, the substanceof Congress' regulatory scheme is, in an important respect,incompatible with FDA jurisdiction. Although the super-vision of product labeling to protect consumer health is asubstantial component of the FDA's regulation of drugs anddevices, see 21 U. S. C. $ 352 (1994 ed. and Supp. III), theFCLAA and the CSTHEA explicitly prohibit any federalagency from imposing any health-related labeling requirements on cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products, see 15U. S. C. $$ 1334(a), 4406(a).Under these circumstances, it is clear that Congress'tobacco-specific legislation has effectively ratified the FDA'sprevious position that it lacks jurisdiction to regulate tobacco. As in Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461 U. S. 574(1983), "[i]t is hardly conceivable that Congress--and in thissetting, any Member of Congress--was not abundantlyaware of what was going on." Id., at 600-601. Congresshas affirmatively acted to address the issue of tobacco andhealth, relying on the representations of the FDA that it hadno authority to regulate tobacco. It has created a distinctscheme to regulate the sale of tobacco products, focused onlabeling and advertising, and premised on the belief that theFDA lacks such jurisdiction under the FDCA. As a result,Congress' tobacco-specific statutes preclude the FDA fromregulating tobacco products as customarily marketed.Although the dissent takes issue with our discussion of theFDA's change in position, post, at 186-189, our conclusion doesnot rely on the fact that the FDA's assertion of jurisdictionrepresents a sharp break with its prior interpretation of theFDCA. Certainly, an agency's initial interpretation of astatute that it is charged with administering is not "carved529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN157Cite as: 529 U. S. 120 (2000)Opinion of the Courtin stone." Chevron, 467 U. S., at 863; see also Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 742 (1996). Aswe recognized in Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States,Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29(1983), agencies "must be given ample latitude to `adapt theirrules and policies to the demands of changing circumstances.' " Id., at 42 (quoting Permian Basin Area RateCases, 390 U. S. 747, 784 (1968)). The consistency of theFDA's prior position is significant in this case for a differentreason: It provides important context to Congress' enact-ment of its tobacco-specific legislation. When the FDA repeatedly informed Congress that the FDCA does not grantit the authority to regulate tobacco products, its statementswere consistent with the agency's unwavering position sinceits inception, and with the position that its predecessoragency had first taken in 1914. Although not crucial, theconsistency of the FDA's prior position bolsters the conclusion that when Congress created a distinct regulatoryscheme addressing the subject of tobacco and health, it understood that the FDA is without jurisdiction to regulatetobacco products and ratified that position.The dissent also argues that the proper inference to bedrawn from Congress' tobacco-specific legislation is "critically ambivalent." Post, at 182. We disagree. In that series of statutes, Congress crafted a specific legislative response to the problem of tobacco and health, and it did sowith the understanding, based on repeated assertions by theFDA, that the agency has no authority under the FDCA toregulate tobacco products. Moreover, Congress expresslypre-empted any other regulation of the labeling of tobaccoproducts concerning their health consequences, even thoughthe oversight of labeling is central to the FDCA's regulatoryscheme. And in addressing the subject, Congress consistently evidenced its intent to preclude any federal agencyfrom exercising significant policymaking authority in thearea. Under these circumstances, we believe the appro529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN158 FDA v. BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the Courtpriate inference--that Congress intended to ratify the FDA'sprior position that it lacks jurisdiction--is unmistakable.The dissent alternatively argues that, even if Congress'subsequent tobacco-specific legislation did, in fact, ratify theFDA's position, that position was merely a contingent dis-avowal of jurisdiction. Specifically, the dissent contendsthat "the FDA's traditional view was largely premised ona perceived inability to prove the necessary statutory `in-tent' requirement."Post, at 189-190. A fair reading of theFDA's representations prior to 1995, however, demonstratesthat the agency's position was essentially unconditional.See, e. g., 1972 Hearings 239, 242 (statement of Comm'r Edwards) ("[R]egulation of cigarettes is to be the domain ofCongress," and "[a]ny such move by FDA would be inconsistent with the clear congressional intent"); 1983 House Hearings 74 (statement of Assistant Secretary Brandt) ("[T]heissue of regulation of tobacco . . . is something that Congresshas reserved to itself "); 1983 Senate Hearings 56 (statementof Assistant Secretary Brandt) ("Congress has assumed theresponsibility of regulating . . . cigarettes"); Brief for Appellee in Action on Smoking and Health v. Harris, 655 F. 2d236 (CADC 1980), 9 Rec. in No. 97-1604 (CA4), Tab No. 4,at 27, n. 23 (because "Congress has never acted to disturbthe agency's interpretation," it "acquiesced in the FDA's interpretation"). To the extent the agency's position could becharacterized as equivocal, it was only with respect to thewell-established exception of when the manufacturer makesexpress claims of therapeutic benefit. See, e. g., 1965 Hearings 193 (statement of Deputy Comm'r Rankin) ("The Foodand Drug Administration has no jurisdiction under the Food,Drug, and Cosmetic Act over tobacco, unless it bears drugclaims"); Letter to ASH Executive Director Banzhaf fromFDA Comm'r Kennedy (Dec. 5, 1977), App. 47 ("The interpretation of the Act by FDA consistently has been that cigarettes are not a drug unless health claims are made by thevendors"); Letter to ASH Executive Director Banzhaf from529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN159Cite as: 529 U. S. 120 (2000)Opinion of the CourtFDA Comm'r Goyan (Nov. 25, 1980), id., at 67 ("Insofar asrulemaking would relate to cigarettes or attached filters ascustomarily marketed, we have concluded that FDA has nojurisdiction"). Thus, what Congress ratified was the FDA'splain and resolute position that the FDCA gives the agencyno authority to regulate tobacco products as customarilymarketed. CFinally, our inquiry into whether Congress has directlyspoken to the precise question at issue is shaped, at leastin some measure, by the nature of the question presented.Deference underChevron to an agency's construction of astatute that it administers is premised on the theory that astatute's ambiguity constitutes an implicit delegation fromCongress to the agency to fill in the statutory gaps. SeeChevron, supra, at 844. In extraordinary cases, however,there may be reason to hesitate before concluding that Congress has intended such an implicit delegation. Cf. Breyer,Judicial Review of Questions of Law and Policy, 38 Admin.L. Rev. 363, 370 (1986) ("A court may also ask whether thelegal question is an important one. Congress is more likelyto have focused upon, and answered, major questions, whileleaving interstitial matters to answer themselves in thecourse of the statute's daily administration").This is hardly an ordinary case. Contrary to its representations to Congress since 1914, the FDA has now assertedjurisdiction to regulate an industry constituting a significantportion of the American economy. In fact, the FDA con-tends that, were it to determine that tobacco products provide no "reasonable assurance of safety," it would have theauthority to ban cigarettes and smokeless tobacco entirely.See Brief for Petitioners 35-36; Reply Brief for Petitioners14. Owing to its unique place in American history and society, tobacco has its own unique political history. Congress,for better or for worse, has created a distinct regulatoryscheme for tobacco products, squarely rejected proposals to529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN160 FDA v. BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the Courtgive the FDA jurisdiction over tobacco, and repeatedly actedto preclude any agency from exercising significant policymaking authority in the area. Given this history and thebreadth of the authority that the FDA has asserted, we areobliged to defer not to the agency's expansive constructionof the statute, but to Congress' consistent judgment to denythe FDA this power.Our decision in MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 512 U. S. 218 (1994), is instructive. That case involved the proper construction of theterm "modify" in $ 203(b) of the Communications Act of 1934.The FCC contended that, because the Act gave it the discretion to "modify any requirement" imposed under the statute,it therefore possessed the authority to render voluntary theotherwise mandatory requirement that long distance carriers file their rates. Id., at 225. We rejected the FCC's construction, finding "not the slightest doubt" that Congress haddirectly spoken to the question. Id., at 228. In reasoningeven more apt here, we concluded that "[i]t is highly unlikelythat Congress would leave the determination of whetheran industry will be entirely, or even substantially, rateregulated to agency discretion--and even more unlikely thatit would achieve that through such a subtle device as permission to `modify' rate-filing requirements." Id., at 231.As in MCI, we are confident that Congress could not haveintended to delegate a decision of such economic and politicalsignificance to an agency in so cryptic a fashion. To findthat the FDA has the authority to regulate tobacco products,one must not only adopt an extremely strained understanding of "safety" as it is used throughout the Act--a conceptcentral to the FDCA's regulatory scheme--but also ignorethe plain implication of Congress' subsequent tobaccospecific legislation. It is therefore clear, based on theFDCA's overall regulatory scheme and the subsequent tobacco legislation, that Congress has directly spoken to the529US1 Unit: $U36 [09-26-01 08:36:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN161Cite as: 529 U. S. 120 (2000)dissentingquestion at issue and precluded the FDA from regulatingtobacco products.* * *By no means do we question the seriousness of the problem that the FDA has sought to address. The agency hasamply demonstrated that tobacco use, particularly amongchildren and adolescents, poses perhaps the single most significant threat to public health in the United States. Nonetheless, no matter how "important, conspicuous, and controversial" the issue, and regardless of how likely the public isto hold the Executive Branch politically accountable, post, at190, an administrative agency's power to regulate in the public interest must always be grounded in a valid grant of authority from Congress. And " `[i]n our anxiety to effectuatethe congressional purpose of protecting the public, we musttake care not to extend the scope of the statute beyond thepoint where Congress indicated it would stop.' " UnitedStates v. Article of Drug . . . Bacto-Unidisk, 394 U. S. 784,800 (1969) (quoting 62 Cases of Jam v. United States, 340U. S. 593, 600 (1951)). Reading the FDCA as a whole, aswell as in conjunction with Congress' subsequent tobaccospecific legislation, it is plain that Congress has not giventhe FDA the authority that it seeks to exercise here. Forthese reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for theFourth Circuit is affirmed.
