S. 87 (1993)Opinion of the CourtStates Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 3C1.1(Nov. 1989), if the court finds the defendant committed perjury at trial. We answer in the affirmative.IRespondent, Sharon Dunnigan, was charged in a singlecount indictment with conspiracy to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U. S. C. $ 846. After entering a plea of notguilty, she stood trial.The case in chief for the United States consisted of fivewitnesses who took part in, or observed, respondent's cocaine trafficking during the summer of 1988. The first witness was Freddie Harris, a cocaine dealer in Charleston,West Virginia. Harris testified that respondent traveled between Charleston and Cleveland, Ohio, numerous times during the summer in question to purchase cocaine for him. Hefurther stated that either he or his associate John Dean accompanied respondent on several of these trips. Dean wasthe second witness, and he recounted his trips to Clevelandwith respondent during the same period to purchase cocaine.He also described meetings with both respondent and Harrisfor the purpose of delivering cocaine.Three more Government witnesses followed. AndreCharlton testified that respondent, at her own apartment,delivered several ounces of cocaine to Charlton and Harris.Charlton also attested to receiving cocaine from Dean whichDean said he and respondent had bought in Cleveland.Tammy Moore testified next. She described conversationsduring which respondent vouched for the high quality of thecocaine in Cleveland and suggested Moore accompany her ona trip to Cleveland. Then came the testimony of WynemaBrown, who repeated respondent's admissions of trips toCleveland to purchase cocaine for Harris. Brown alsostated she saw cocaine powder at respondent's apartmentand witnessed respondent and her daughter convert the507US1$32z 11-18-96 18:45:39 PAGES OPINPGT90 UNITED STATES v. DUNNIGANOpinion of the Courtpowder into crack cocaine for the daughter to sell. Thisended the Government's case in chief.Respondent elected to take the stand and was the solewitness in her own defense. She denied all criminal actsattributed to her. She admitted going to Cleveland withHarris once but claimed it was for an innocent purpose, notto buy or sell cocaine. She admitted knowing John Dean butdenied traveling with him to Cleveland. Last, she deniedknowing that cocaine was brought into or sold from herapartment. On cross-examination, the Government ques-tioned respondent regarding the testimony of the five prosecution witnesses. Respondent denied their inculpatorystatements and said she had not possessed or distributed cocaine during the summer in question or at any other time.The Government also asked whether Edward Dickerson hadbeen in her apartment or bought crack cocaine from her.Respondent answered no.The defense rested, and the Government began its rebuttal with the testimony of Dickerson. He testified to purchasing crack cocaine from respondent on July 12, 1988, in atransaction monitored by law enforcement authorities. TheGovernment also recalled Moore, who claimed respondentsold her crack cocaine about five times and provided cocainepowder to her and respondent's daughter to convert intocrack cocaine for resale. According to Moore, the moneyfrom the resale was paid over to respondent. The jury returned a verdict of guilty.Respondent was sentenced pursuant to the United StatesSentencing Guidelines. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (Nov. 1989). Her base offenselevel was set at 22, and the Government requested that thebase be increased by two offense levels under USSG $ 3C1.1,entitled "willfully obstructing or impeding proceedings," because respondent perjured herself at trial. After arguments from both sides, the District Court ruled on therequest:507US1$32z 11-18-96 18:45:39 PAGES OPINPGT91Cite as: 507 U. S. 87 (1993)Opinion of the Court"The court finds that the defendant was untruthful attrial with respect to material matters in this case. Thedefendant denied her involvement when it is clear fromthe evidence in the case as the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that she was involved in the conspiracyalleged in the indictment, and by virtue of her failure togive truthful testimony on material matters that weredesigned to substantially affect the outcome of the case,the court concludes that the false testimony at trial war-rants an upward adjustment by two levels." App. 29.Based upon the enhanced offense level 24 and a criminal his-tory category I, the District Court sentenced respondent to51 months' incarceration, which was at the low end of theGuidelines range.Respondent appealed her sentence, and the Court of Ap-peals reversed the District Court's decision to increase respondent's offense level under USSG $ 3C1.1. 944 F. 2d 178(CA4 1991). The Court of Appeals did not take issue withthe District Court's factual findings or rule that further find-ings were necessary to support a $ 3C1.1 enhancement. Instead, the court held that a $ 3C1.1 enhancement based on adefendant's alleged perjury at trial would be unconstitutional. The court reasoned that "every defendant who takesthe stand and is convicted [would] be given the obstructionof justice enhancement." Id., at 183. Citing some of theincentives for an accused to elect not to testify, including therisk of impeachment by prior convictions, the court ruledthat a mechanical sentencing enhancement for testifying wasunconstitutional: "With an automatic $ 3C1.1 enhancementadded to the ante, the defendant may not think testifyingworth the risk." Id., at 184.Referring to United States v. Grayson, 438 U. S. 41 (1978),where we upheld a sentence increase based on an accused'sfalse testimony at trial, the Court of Appeals found thatprecedent distinguishable on two grounds. First, in Gray-son we justified the sentence increase as based on the507US1$32z 11-18-96 18:45:39 PAGES OPINPGT92 UNITED STATES v. DUNNIGANOpinion of the CourtDistrict Court's assessment of the defendant's greater needfor rehabilitation.Id., at 51-53. The Court of Appealsthought this justification was inapplicable, viewing the$ 3C1.1 enhancement as a punishment for obstructing justicewithout the time and expense of a separate perjury prosecution. 944 F. 2d, at 184. Second, the Grayson Court cau-tioned that "[n]othing we say today requires a sentencingjudge to enhance, in some wooden or reflex fashion, the sen-tences of all defendants whose testimony is deemed false."438 U. S., at 55. According to the Court of Appeals, "[t]heguidelines supply precisely the `wooden or reflex' enhancement disclaimed by the Court," 944 F. 2d, at 184, and thisrigidity "makes the $ 3C1.1 enhancement for a disbelieveddenial of guilt under oath an intolerable burden upon thedefendant's right to testify in his own behalf," id., at 185.Over a dissent by four of its judges, the Court of Appealsdeclined to rehear the case en banc. 950 F. 2d 149 (CA41991). We granted certiorari. 504 U. S. 940 (1992).IIASentencing Guideline $ 3C1.1 states in full: "If the defendant willfully impeded or obstructed, or attempted to impedeor obstruct the administration of justice during the investigation or prosecution of the instant offense, increase the[defendant's] offense level by 2 levels." USSG $ 3C1.1 (Nov.1989). See also USSG $ 3C1.1 (Nov. 1992). Both partiesassume the phrase "impede or obstruct the administrationof justice" includes perjury, and the commentary to $ 3C1.1is explicit in so providing. In pertinent part, the commen-tary states:"This section provides a sentence enhancement for adefendant who engages in conduct calculated to misleador deceive authorities or those involved in a judicial proceeding, or otherwise to willfully interfere with the dis507US1$32z 11-18-96 18:45:39 PAGES OPINPGT93Cite as: 507 U. S. 87 (1993)Opinion of the Courtposition of criminal charges, in respect to the instantoffense.. . . . ."1. The following conduct, while not exclusive, may pro-vide a basis for applying this adjustment:. . . . ."(c) testifying untruthfully or suborning untruthful tes-timony concerning a material fact, . . . during a preliminary or grand jury proceeding, trial, sentencing proceed-ing, or any other judicial proceeding." USSG $ 3C1.1,comment., n. 1(c) (Nov. 1989).See also USSG $ 3C1.1, comment., n. 3(b) (Nov. 1992) ("Thefollowing is a non-exhaustive list of examples of the types ofconduct to which this enhancement applies: . . . (b) commit-ting, suborning, or attempting to suborn perjury").Were we to have the question before us without referenceto this commentary, we would have to acknowledge thatsome of our precedents do not interpret perjury to constitutean obstruction of justice unless the perjury is part of somegreater design to interfere with judicial proceedings. In reMichael, 326 U. S. 224, 228 (1945); Ex parte Hudgings, 249U. S. 378, 383 (1919). Those cases arose in the context ofinterpreting early versions of the federal criminal contemptstatute, which defined contempt, in part, as "misbehavior ofany person . . . as to obstruct the administration of justice."28 U. S. C. $ 385 (1940 ed.) (Judicial Code $ 268), derived fromthe Act of Mar. 2, 1831, Rev. Stat. $ 725. See also 18 U. S. C.$ 401(1) (same).In Hudgings and Michael, we indicated that the ordinarytask of trial courts is to sift true from false testimony, sothe problem caused by simple perjury was not so much anobstruction of justice as an expected part of its administration. See Michael, 326 U. S., at 227-228. Those cases,however, were decided against the background rule that thecontempt power was to be confined to " `the least possiblepower adequate' " to protect "the administration of justice507US1$32z 11-18-96 18:45:39 PAGES OPINPGT94 UNITED STATES v. DUNNIGANOpinion of the Courtagainst immediate interruption of its business." Id., at 227(quotingAnderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204, 231 (1821)). Inthe present context, on the other hand, the enhancement pro-vision is part of a sentencing scheme designed to determinethe appropriate type and extent of punishment after theissue of guilt has been resolved. The commission of perjuryis of obvious relevance in this regard, because it reflects ona defendant's criminal history, on her willingness to acceptthe commands of the law and the authority of the court, andon her character in general. Even on the assumption thatwe could construe a sentencing guideline in a manner inconsistent with its accompanying commentary, the fact that themeaning ascribed to the phrase "obstruction of justice" differs in the contempt and sentencing contexts would not be areason for rejecting the Sentencing Commission's interpretation of that phrase. In all events, the Commission's interpretation is contested by neither party to this case.In determining what constitutes perjury, we rely upon thedefinition that has gained general acceptance and commonunderstanding under the federal criminal perjury statute, 18U. S. C. $ 1621. A witness testifying under oath or affirmation violates this statute if she gives false testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide falsetestimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, orfaulty memory. See $ 1621(1); United States v. Debrow, 346U. S. 374, 376 (1953); United States v. Norris, 300 U. S. 564,574, 576 (1937). This federal definition of perjury by a witness has remained unchanged in its material respects forover a century. See United States v. Smull, 236 U. S. 405,408, and n. 1 (1915) (tracing history of $ 1621's predecessor,Act of Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, $ 125, 35 Stat. 1111). It parallelstypical state-law definitions of perjury, see American LawInstitute, Model Penal Code $ 241.1 (1985); 4 C. Torcia, Wharton's Criminal Law $ 601 (14th ed. 1981), and has roots in thelaw dating back to at least the Perjury Statute of 1563, 5Eliz. I, ch. 9, see Gordon, The Invention of a Common Law507US1$32z 11-18-96 18:45:39 PAGES OPINPGT95Cite as: 507 U. S. 87 (1993)Opinion of the CourtCrime: Perjury and the Elizabethan Courts, 24 Am. J. LegalHist. 145 (1980). See also 1 Colonial Laws of New York,1664-1719, ch. 8, pp. 129-130 (reprinting "An Act to preventwilfull Perjury," enacted Nov. 1, 1683).Of course, not every accused who testifies at trial and isconvicted will incur an enhanced sentence under $ 3C1.1 forcommitting perjury. As we have just observed, an accusedmay give inaccurate testimony due to confusion, mistake, orfaulty memory. In other instances, an accused may testifyto matters such as lack of capacity, insanity, duress, or selfdefense. Her testimony may be truthful, but the jury maynonetheless find the testimony insufficient to excuse criminalliability or prove lack of intent. For these reasons, if a defendant objects to a sentence enhancement resulting fromher trial testimony, a district court must review the evidenceand make independent findings necessary to establish a willful impediment to, or obstruction of, justice, or an attemptto do the same, under the perjury definition we have setout. See USSG $ 6A1.3 (Nov. 1989); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.32(c)(3)(D). See also Burns v. United States, 501 U. S. 129,134 (1991). When doing so, it is preferable for a districtcourt to address each element of the alleged perjury in aseparate and clear finding. The district court's determination that enhancement is required is sufficient, however, if,as was the case here, the court makes a finding of an obstruction of, or impediment to, justice that encompasses all of thefactual predicates for a finding of perjury. See App. 29("The court finds that the defendant was untruthful at trialwith respect to material matters in this case. [B]y virtueof her failure to give truthful testimony on material mattersthat were designed to substantially affect the outcome of thecase, the court concludes that the false testimony at trialwarrants an upward adjustment by two levels" (emphasisadded)). Given the numerous witnesses who contradictedrespondent regarding so many facts on which she could not507US1$32z 11-18-96 18:45:39 PAGES OPINPGT96 UNITED STATES v. DUNNIGANOpinion of the Courthave been mistaken, there is ample support for the DistrictCourt's finding.BWe turn next to the contention that an enhanced sentencefor the willful presentation of false testimony underminesthe right to testify. The right to testify on one's own behalfin a criminal proceeding is made explicit by federal statute,18 U. S. C. $ 3481, and, we have said, it is also a right implicitin the Constitution, seeRock v. Arkansas, 483 U. S. 44, 51-53(1987);Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U. S. 157, 164 (1986).Respondent cannot contend that increasing her sentencebecause of her perjury interferes with her right to testify,for we have held on a number of occasions that a defendant'sright to testify does not include a right to commit perjury.Id., at 173; United States v. Havens, 446 U. S. 620, 626 (1980);Grayson, 438 U. S., at 54. Nor can respondent contend$ 3C1.1 is unconstitutional on the simple basis that it distortsher decision whether to testify or remain silent. Our au-thorities do not impose a categorical ban on every governmental action affecting the strategic decisions of an accused,including decisions whether or not to exercise constitutionalrights. See Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U. S. 357, 365(1978);McGautha v. California, 402 U. S. 183, 216-217(1971);United States v. Knox, 396 U. S. 77, 82-83 (1969).No doubt to avoid these difficulties, respondent's argumentcomes to us in a different form. It is that $ 3C1.1 carries arisk that a district court will order enhancement even whena defendant's testimony is truthful, either because the courtacts without regard to the truth or makes an erroneous finding of falsity. That $ 3C1.1 creates such a risk, respondentclaims, makes the enhancement unconstitutional. This argument does not survive scrutiny.The concern that courts will enhance sentences as a matterof course whenever the accused takes the stand and is foundguilty is dispelled by our earlier explanation that if an accused challenges a sentence increase based on perjured testi507US1$32z 11-18-96 18:45:39 PAGES OPINPGT97Cite as: 507 U. S. 87 (1993)Opinion of the Courtmony, the trial court must make findings to support all theelements of a perjury violation in the specific case. And asto the risk of incorrect findings of perjury by district courts,that risk is inherent in a system which insists on the valueof testimony under oath. To uphold the integrity of our trialsystem, we have said that the constitutionality of perjurystatutes is unquestioned.Grayson, supra, at 54. See alsoNix, supra, at 173-174; Havens, supra, at 626-627. Therequirement of sworn testimony, backed by punishmentfor perjury, is as much a protection for the accused asit is a threat. All testimony, from third-party witnesses andthe accused, has greater value because of the witness' oathand the obligations or penalties attendant to it. Cf. G. Neilson, Trial By Combat 5 (1891) ("A means of ensuring thetruth in human testimony has been a thing desired in everyage").Neither can we accept respondent's argument that the$ 3C1.1 sentence enhancement advances only "the impermissible sentencing practice of incarcerating for the purpose ofsaving the Government the burden of bringing a separateand subsequent perjury prosecution." Grayson, supra, at53. A sentence enhancement based on perjury does deterfalse testimony in much the same way as a separate prosecution for perjury. But the enhancement is more than a meresurrogate for a perjury prosecution. It furthers legitimatesentencing goals relating to the principal crime, includingthe goals of retribution and incapacitation. See 18 U. S. C.$ 3553(a)(2); Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 367(1989). It is rational for a sentencing authority to concludethat a defendant who commits a crime and then perjuresherself in an unlawful attempt to avoid responsibility is morethreatening to society and less deserving of leniency than adefendant who does not so defy the trial process. The perjuring defendant's willingness to frustrate judicial proceedings to avoid criminal liability suggests that the need forincapacitation and retribution is heightened as compared507US1$32z 11-18-96 18:45:39 PAGES OPINPGT98 UNITED STATES v. DUNNIGANOpinion of the Courtwith the defendant charged with the same crime who allowsjudicial proceedings to progress without resorting to perjury.Weighed against these considerations, the argumentsmade by the Court of Appeals to distinguish Grayson arewide of the mark. The court is correct that rehabilitation isno longer a goal of sentencing under the Guidelines. 28U. S. C. $ 994(k); Mistretta, supra, at 367. Our lengthy dis-cussion inGrayson of how a defendant's perjury was rele-vant to the potential for rehabilitation, however, was notmeant to imply that rehabilitation was the only permissiblejustification for an increased sentence based on perjury. Aswe have said, the $ 3C1.1 enhancement serves other legiti-mate sentencing goals. Neither does our cautionary remarkthat the enhancement in Grayson need not be imposed "insome wooden or reflex fashion" compel invalidation of$ 3C1.1, as the Court of Appeals believed. When contested,the elements of perjury must be found by the district courtwith the specificity we have stated, so the enhancement isfar from automatic. And that the enhancement stems froma congressional mandate rather than from a court's discre-tionary judgment cannot be grounds, in these circumstances,for its invalidation. See Chapman v. United States, 500U. S. 453, 467 (1991); McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S.79, 92 (1986).Upon a proper determination that the accused has committed perjury at trial, an enhancement of sentence is re-quired by the Sentencing Guidelines. That requirement isconsistent with our precedents and is not in contravention ofthe privilege of an accused to testify in her own behalf. Thejudgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.
