The question before us is whether an employee dischargedin violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of1967 is barred from all relief when, after her discharge, theemployer discovers evidence of wrongdoing that, in anyevent, would have led to the employee's termination on lawful and legitimate grounds. IFor some 30 years, petitioner Christine McKennon workedfor respondent Nashville Banner Publishing Company. Shewas discharged, the Banner claimed, as part of a work forcereduction plan necessitated by cost considerations. McKennon, who was 62 years old when she lost her job, thoughtanother reason explained her dismissal: her age. She filedsuit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, alleging that her discharge violated theAge Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA orAct), 81 Stat. 602, as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 621 et seq.

The ADEA makes it unlawful for anyemployer:"to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminateagainst any individual with respect to his compensation,terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, becauseof such individual's age." 29 U. S. C. $ 623(a)(1).McKennon sought a variety of legal and equitable remedies available under the ADEA, including backpay. App.10a-11a.In preparation of the case, the Banner took McKennon'sdeposition. She testified that, during her final year of em-ployment, she had copied several confidential documentsbearing upon the company's financial condition. She had ac-cess to these records as secretary to the Banner's comptroller. McKennon took the copies home and showed them toher husband. Her motivation, she averred, was an appre-hension she was about to be fired because of her age. Whenshe became concerned about her job, she removed and copiedthe documents for "insurance" and "protection." Deposition, Dec. 18, 1991, Record, Docket Entry No. 39, Vol. 2,p. 241. A few days after these deposition disclosures, theBanner sent McKennon a letter declaring that removal andcopying of the records was in violation of her job responsibilities and advising her (again) that she was terminated. TheBanner's letter also recited that had it known of McKennon'smisconduct it would have discharged her at once for thatreason.For purposes of summary judgment, the Banner concededits discrimination against McKennon. The District Courtgranted summary judgment for the Banner, holding thatMcKennon's misconduct was grounds for her termination andthat neither backpay nor any other remedy was available toher under the ADEA. 797 F. Supp. 604 (MD Tenn. 1992).The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuitaffirmed on the same rationale. 9 F. 3d 539 (1993). We513us2$20L 04-04-98 13:55:16 PAGES OPINPGT356 McKENNON v.

We now reverse.IIWe shall assume, as summary judgment procedures re-quire us to assume, that the sole reason for McKennon's initial discharge was her age, a discharge violative of theADEA. Our further premise is that the misconduct revealed by the deposition was so grave that McKennon's im-mediate discharge would have followed its disclosure in anyevent. The District Court and the Court of Appeals foundno basis for contesting that proposition, and for purposes ofour review we need not question it here. We do questionthe legal conclusion reached by those courts that afteracquired evidence of wrongdoing which would have resultedin discharge bars employees from any relief under theADEA. That ruling is incorrect.The Court of Appeals considered McKennon's misconduct,in effect, to be supervening grounds for termination. That513us2$20L 04-04-98 13:55:16 PAGES OPINPGT357Cite as: 513 U. S. 352 (1995)Opinion of the Courtmay be so, but it does not follow, as the Court of Appealssaid in citing one of its own earlier cases, that the misconductrenders it " `irrelevant whether or not [McKennon] was dis-criminated against.' " 9 F. 3d, at 542, quotingMilliganJensen v. Michigan Technological Univ., 975 F. 2d 302, 305(CA6 1992), cert. granted, 509 U. S. 943, cert. dism'd, 509U. S. 903 (1993). We conclude that a violation of the ADEAcannot be so altogether disregarded.The ADEA, enacted in 1967 as part of an ongoing congressional effort to eradicate discrimination in the workplace, re-flects a societal condemnation of invidious bias in employment decisions. The ADEA is but part of a wider statutoryscheme to protect employees in the workplace nationwide.See Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C.$ 2000e et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. V) (race, color, sex, national origin, and religion); the Americans with DisabilitiesAct of 1990, 42 U. S. C. $ 12101 et seq. (1988 ed., Supp. V)(disability); the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U. S. C.$ 158(a) (union activities); the Equal Pay Act of 1963, 29U. S. C. $ 206(d) (sex). The ADEA incorporates some features of both Title VII and the Fair Labor Standards Act of1938, which has led us to describe it as "something of a hybrid." Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 578 (1978). Thesubstantive, antidiscrimination provisions of the ADEA aremodeled upon the prohibitions of Title VII. See TransWorld Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 121 (1985);Lorillard v. Pons, supra, at 584. Its remedial provisionsincorporate by reference the provisions of the Fair LaborStandards Act of 1938. 29 U. S. C. $ 626(b). When confronted with a violation of the ADEA, a district court is authorized to afford relief by means of reinstatement, backpay,injunctive relief, declaratory judgment, and attorney's fees.Ibid.; see also Lorillard v. Pons, supra, at 584. In the caseof a willful violation of the Act, the ADEA authorizes anaward of liquidated damages equal to the backpay award.29 U. S. C. $ 626(b). The Act also gives federal courts the513us2$20L 04-04-98 13:55:16 PAGES OPINPGT358 McKENNON v. NASHVILLE BANNER PUBLISHING CO.Opinion of the Courtdiscretion to "grant such legal or equitable relief as may beappropriate to effectuate the purposes of [the Act]."Ibid.The ADEA and Title VII share common substantivefeatures and also a common purpose: "the elimination ofdiscrimination in the workplace." Oscar Mayer & Co. v.Evans, 441 U. S. 750, 756 (1979). Congress designed theremedial measures in these statutes to serve as a "spur orcatalyst" to cause employers "to self-examine and to self-evaluate their employment practices and to endeavor to eliminate, so far as possible, the last vestiges" of discrimination.Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 417-418 (1975)(internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see alsoFranks v. Bowman Transp. Co., 424 U. S. 747, 763 (1976).Deterrence is one object of these statutes. Compensationfor injuries caused by the prohibited discrimination isanother. Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, supra, at 418;Franks v. Bowman Transp. Co., supra, at 763-764. TheADEA, in keeping with these purposes, contains a vital element found in both Title VII and the Fair Labor StandardsAct: It grants an injured employee a right of action to obtainthe authorized relief. 29 U. S. C. $ 626(c). The private litigant who seeks redress for his or her injuries vindicates boththe deterrence and the compensation objectives of theADEA. See Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U. S. 36,45 (1974) ("[T]he private litigant [in Title VII] not only redresses his own injury but also vindicates the important congressional policy against discriminatory employment practices"); see also Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324,364 (1977). It would not accord with this scheme if afteracquired evidence of wrongdoing that would have resultedin termination operates, in every instance, to bar all relieffor an earlier violation of the Act.The objectives of the ADEA are furthered when even asingle employee establishes that an employer has discriminated against him or her. The disclosure through litigationof incidents or practices that violate national policies re513us2$20L 04-04-98 13:55:16 PAGES OPINPGT359Cite as: 513 U. S. 352 (1995)Opinion of the Courtspecting nondiscrimination in the work force is itself impor-tant, for the occurrence of violations may disclose patterns ofnoncompliance resulting from a misappreciation of the Act'soperation or entrenched resistance to its commands, eitherof which can be of industry-wide significance. The efficacyof its enforcement mechanisms becomes one measure of thesuccess of the Act.The Court of Appeals in this case relied upon two of itsearlier decisions,Johnson v. Honeywell Information Systems, Inc., 955 F. 2d 409 (CA6 1992); Milligan-Jensen v.Michigan Technological Univ., 975 F. 2d 302 (CA6 1992), andthe opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit inSummers v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., 864F. 2d 700 (1988). Consulting those authorities, it declaredthat it had "firmly endorsed the principle that after-acquiredevidence is a complete bar to any recovery by the formeremployee where the employer can show it would have firedthe employee on the basis of the evidence." 9 F. 3d, at 542.Summers, in turn, relied upon our decision in Mt. HealthyCity Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274 (1977), but that decision is inapplicable here.In Mt. Healthy we addressed a mixed-motives case, inwhich two motives were said to be operative in the employer's decision to fire an employee. One was lawful, the other(an alleged constitutional violation) unlawful. We held thatif the lawful reason alone would have sufficed to justify thefiring, the employee could not prevail in a suit against theemployer. The case was controlled by the difficulty, andwhat we thought was the lack of necessity, of disentanglingthe proper motive from the improper one where both playeda part in the termination and the former motive would suffice to sustain the employer's action. Id., at 284-287.That is not the problem confronted here. As we havesaid, the case comes to us on the express assumption that anunlawful motive was the sole basis for the firing. McKennon's misconduct was not discovered until after she had been513us2$20L 04-04-98 13:55:16 PAGES OPINPGT360 McKENNON v. NASHVILLE BANNER PUBLISHING CO.Opinion of the Courtfired. The employer could not have been motivated byknowledge it did not have and it cannot now claim that theemployee was fired for the nondiscriminatory reason.Mixed-motive cases are inapposite here, except to the important extent they underscore the necessity of determining theemployer's motives in ordering the discharge, an essentialelement in determining whether the employer violated thefederal antidiscrimination law. See Price Waterhouse v.Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228, 252 (1989) (plurality opinion) (employer's legitimate reason for discharge in mixed-motive casewill not suffice "if that reason did not motivate it at the timeof the decision"); id., at 260-261 (White, J., concurring injudgment); id., at 261 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). As has been observed, "proving that the same decision would have been justified . . . is not the same as provingthat the same decision would have been made." Id., at 252(plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks and citationsomitted); see also id., at 260-261 (White, J., concurring injudgment).Our inquiry is not at an end, however, for even though theemployer has violated the Act, we must consider how theafter-acquired evidence of the employee's wrongdoing bearson the specific remedy to be ordered. Equity's maxim thata suitor who engaged in his own reprehensible conduct in thecourse of the transaction at issue must be denied equitablerelief because of unclean hands, a rule which in conventionalformulation operated in limine to bar the suitor from invoking the aid of the equity court, 2 S. Symons, Pomeroy's Equity Jurisprudence $ 397, pp. 90-92 (5th ed. 1941), has notbeen applied where Congress authorizes broad equitable relief to serve important national policies. We have rejectedthe unclean hands defense "where a private suit serves important public purposes." Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp., 392 U. S. 134, 138 (1968) (Shermanand Clayton Antitrust Acts). That does not mean, however,the employee's own misconduct is irrelevant to all the reme513us2$20L 04-04-98 13:55:16 PAGES OPINPGT361Cite as: 513 U. S. 352 (1995)Opinion of the Courtdies otherwise available under the statute. The statute con-trolling this case provides that "the court shall have jurisdiction to grant such legal or equitable relief as may beappropriate to effectuate the purposes of this chapter, including without limitation judgments compelling employment,reinstatement or promotion, or enforcing the liability for[amounts owing to a person as a result of a violation of thischapter]." 29 U. S. C. $ 626(b); see also $ 216(b). In givingeffect to the ADEA, we must recognize the duality betweenthe legitimate interests of the employer and the importantclaims of the employee who invokes the national employmentpolicy mandated by the Act. The employee's wrongdoingmust be taken into account, we conclude, lest the employer'slegitimate concerns be ignored. The ADEA, like Title VII,is not a general regulation of the workplace but a law whichprohibits discrimination. The statute does not constrainemployers from exercising significant other prerogatives anddiscretions in the course of the hiring, promoting, and discharging of their employees. See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, supra, at 239 ("Title VII eliminates certain bases fordistinguishing among employees while otherwise preservingemployers' freedom of choice"). In determining appropriateremedial action, the employee's wrongdoing becomes relevant not to punish the employee, or out of concern "for therelative moral worth of the parties," Perma Life Mufflers,Inc. v. International Parts Corp., supra, at 139, but to takedue account of the lawful prerogatives of the employer in theusual course of its business and the corresponding equitiesthat it has arising from the employee's wrongdoing.The proper boundaries of remedial relief in the generalclass of cases where, after termination, it is discovered thatthe employee has engaged in wrongdoing must be addressedby the judicial system in the ordinary course of further decisions, for the factual permutations and the equitable considerations they raise will vary from case to case. We do conclude that here, and as a general rule in cases of this type,513us2$20L 04-04-98 13:55:16 PAGES OPINPGT362 McKENNON v. NASHVILLE BANNER PUBLISHING CO.Opinion of the Courtneither reinstatement nor front pay is an appropriate rem-edy. It would be both inequitable and pointless to order thereinstatement of someone the employer would have termi-nated, and will terminate, in any event and upon lawfulgrounds.The proper measure of backpay presents a more difficultproblem. Resolution of this question must give proper recognition to the fact that an ADEA violation has occurredwhich must be deterred and compensated without undue infringement upon the employer's rights and prerogatives.The object of compensation is to restore the employee to theposition he or she would have been in absent the discrimination, Franks v. Bowman Transp. Co., 424 U. S., at 764, butthat principle is difficult to apply with precision where thereis after-acquired evidence of wrongdoing that would haveled to termination on legitimate grounds had the employerknown about it. Once an employer learns about employeewrongdoing that would lead to a legitimate discharge, wecannot require the employer to ignore the information, evenif it is acquired during the course of discovery in a suitagainst the employer and even if the information might havegone undiscovered absent the suit. The beginning point inthe trial court's formulation of a remedy should be calculation of backpay from the date of the unlawful discharge tothe date the new information was discovered. In determining the appropriate order for relief, the court can considertaking into further account extraordinary equitable circumstances that affect the legitimate interests of either party.An absolute rule barring any recovery of backpay, however,would undermine the ADEA's objective of forcing employers to consider and examine their motivations, and of penalizing them for employment decisions that spring from agediscrimination.Where an employer seeks to rely upon after-acquired evidence of wrongdoing, it must first establish that the wrongdoing was of such severity that the employee in fact would513us2$20L 04-04-98 13:55:16 PAGES OPINPGT363Cite as: 513 U. S. 352 (1995)Opinion of the Courthave been terminated on those grounds alone if the employerhad known of it at the time of the discharge. The concernthat employers might as a routine matter undertake exten-sive discovery into an employee's background or performance on the job to resist claims under the Act is not an insub-stantial one, but we think the authority of the courts toaward attorney's fees, mandated under the statute, 29U. S. C. $$ 216(b), 626(b), and to invoke the appropriate provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure will determost abuses.The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded to theCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.513us2$21z 03-30-98 12:50:52 PAGES OPINPGT364 OCTOBER TERM, 1994Per CuriamDUNCAN, WARDEN v.

The District Court granted the petition andthe Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. Henryv. Estelle, 33 F. 3d 1037 (1994). The court held that respondent had exhausted his state remedies even though he had notclaimed a violation of any federal constitutional right in thestate proceedings:"In his direct appeal in state court, Henry did not labelhis claim a federal due process violation; he arguedrather that Hackett's testimony was erroneously admitted because irrelevant and inflammatory, and that itsadmission resulted in a `miscarriage of justice' under theCalifornia Constitution. However, to state a federaldue process claim it is not necessary to invoke `the talismanic phrase "due process of law" ' or cite `book andverse on the federal constitution' . . . ." Id., at 1040(citations omitted).In Picard v. Connor, 404 U.

If state courts are to be given theopportunity to correct alleged violations of prisoners' federalrights, they must surely be alerted to the fact that the pris513us2$21H 03-30-98 12:50:52 PAGES OPINPGT366 DUNCAN v. HENRYSouter, J., concurring in judgmentoners are asserting claims under the United States Constitu-tion. If a habeas petitioner wishes to claim that an evidentiary ruling at a state court trial denied him the due processof law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, he mustsay so, not only in federal court, but in state court. Accord,Anderson v. Harless, 459 U. S. 4 (1982).Picard and Harless control the outcome in this case. Respondent did not apprise the state court of his claim that theevidentiary ruling of which he complained was not only aviolation of state law, but denied him the due process of lawguaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The failure isespecially pronounced in that respondent did specificallyraise a due process objection before the state court based ona different claim--that the pleading was uncertain as towhen the offense occurred. App. D to Pet. for Cert. 8. TheCalifornia Court of Appeal analyzed the evidentiary error byasking whether its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value, not whether it was so inflammatory as to preventa fair trial. 33 F. 3d, at 1046. As recognized by dissentingJudge Brunetti, those standards are no more than " `somewhat similar,' " id., at 1047, not "virtually identical" asclaimed by Justice Stevens, post, at 369. Both Picardand Harless emphasized that mere similarity of claims is insufficient to exhaust. Picard, supra, at 276; Harless, supra,at 6. The state court, when presented with respondent'sclaim of error under the California Evidentiary Code, understandably confined its analysis to the application of state law.Accordingly, the petition for a writ of certiorari is grantedand the judgment of the Court of Appeals is
