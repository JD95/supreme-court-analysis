Section 22 of the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Com-pensation Act (LHWCA or Act), 44 Stat. 1437, as amended,33 U. S. C. $ 922, allows for modification of a disability award*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for Industrial Indemnity Insurance Co. by Roger A. Levy; and for the National Association ofWaterfront Employers et al. by Charles T. Carroll, Jr., Thomas D. Wilcox,and Franklin W. Losey.515us1$72l 08-25-98 19:20:20 PAGES OPINPGT293Cite as: 515 U. S. 291 (1995)Opinion of the Court"on the ground of a change in conditions or because of a mis-take in a determination of fact." The question in this caseis whether a party may seek modification on the ground of"change in conditions" when there has been no change in theemployee's physical condition but rather an increase in theemployee's wage-earning capacity due to the acquisition ofnew skills. IIn 1980, respondent John Rambo injured his back and legwhile working as a longshore frontman for petitioner Metropolitan Stevedore Company. Rambo filed a claim with theDepartment of Labor that was submitted to an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). After Rambo and petitioner stipu-lated that Rambo sustained a 221/2% permanent partial disability and a corresponding $120.24 decrease in his $534.38weekly wage, the ALJ, pursuant to LHWCA $ 8(c)(21),awarded Rambo 662/3% of that figure, or $80.16 per week.App. 5. Because the ALJ also found that Rambo's disabilitywas not due solely to his work-related injury and was "mate-rially and substantially greater than that which would haveresulted from the subsequent injury alone," LHWCA$ 8(f )(1), 33 U. S. C. $ 908(f )(1), he limited the period of petitioner's liability to pay compensation to 104 weeks. Ibid.;App. 6. Later payments were to issue from the special fundadministered by respondent Director of the Office of Work-ers' Compensation Programs (OWCP), LHWCA $ 8(f)(2),33 U. S. C. $ 908(f)(2). Employers (or their insurance carri-ers) contribute to the fund based on their outstanding liabilities. See LHWCA $ 44(c)(2)(B), 33 U. S. C. $ 944(c)(2)(B).After the award, Rambo began attending crane school.With the new skills so acquired, he obtained longshore workas a crane operator. He also worked in his spare time as aheavy lift truck operator. Between 1985 and 1990, Rambo'saverage weekly wages ranged between $1,307.81 and$1,690.50, more than three times his preinjury earnings,though his physical condition remained unchanged. In light515us1$72l 08-25-98 19:20:20 PAGES OPINPGT294 METROPOLITAN STEVEDORE CO. v. RAMBOOpinion of the Courtof the increased wage-earning capacity, petitioner, whichmay seek modification even when the special fund has assumed responsibility for payments, see LHWCA $ 22, 33U. S. C. $ 922; 20 CFR $ 702.148(b) (1994), filed an applicationto modify the disability award under LHWCA $ 22. Peti-tioner asserted there had been a "change in conditions" sothat Rambo was no longer "disabled" under the Act. TheALJ agreed that an award may be modified based on changesin the employee's wage-earning capacity, even absent achange in physical condition. After discounting wage increases due to inflation and considering Rambo's risk of jobloss and other employment prospects, the ALJ concludedRambo "no longer has a wage-earning capacity loss" and ter-minated his disability payments. App. 68. The BenefitsReview Board affirmed, relying on Fleetwood v. NewportNews Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., 16 BRBS 282 (1984),aff 'd, 776 F. 2d 1225 (CA4 1985), which held that "change incondition[s]" means change in wage-earning capacity, as wellas change in physical condition. App. 73. A panel of theCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.Rambo v.Director, OWCP, 28 F. 3d 86 (1994). Rejecting the FourthCircuit's approach in Fleetwood, the Ninth Circuit held thatLHWCA $ 22 authorizes modification of an award only wherethere has been a change in the claimant's physical condition.We granted certiorari to resolve this split, 513 U. S. 1106(1995), and now reverse. IIThe LHWCA is a comprehensive scheme to provide com-pensation "in respect of disability or death of an employee. . . if the disability or death results from an injury occurringupon the navigable waters of the United States." LHWCA$ 3, 33 U. S. C. $ 903(a). Section 22 of the Act provides formodification of awards "on the ground of a change in conditions or because of a mistake in a determination of fact." 33U. S. C. $ 922. In Rambo's view and that of the Ninth Circuit, "change in conditions" means change in physical condi515us1$72l 08-25-98 19:20:20 PAGES OPINPGT295Cite as: 515 U. S. 291 (1995)Opinion of the Courttion and does not include changes in other conditions rele-vant to the initial entitlement to benefits, such as a changein wage-earning capacity. In our view, this interpretationof "change in conditions" cannot stand in the face of the language, structure, and purpose of the Act.ANeither Rambo nor the Ninth Circuit has attempted tobase their position on the language of the statute, whereanalysis in a statutory construction case ought to begin, for"when a statute speaks with clarity to an issue judicial inquiry into the statute's meaning, in all but the most extraor-dinary circumstance, is finished." Estate of Cowart v.Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 475 (1992); Demarest v.Manspeaker, 498 U. S. 184, 190 (1991).Section 22 of the Act provides the only way to modify anaward once it has issued. The section states:"Upon his own initiative, or upon the application ofany party in interest (including an employer or carrierwhich has been granted relief under section 908(f) of thistitle), on the ground of a change in conditions or becauseof a mistake in a determination of fact by the deputycommissioner, the deputy commissioner may, at anytime prior to one year after the date of the last paymentof compensation, . . . or at any time prior to one yearafter the rejection of a claim, review a compensationcase . . . and . . . issue a new compensation order whichmay terminate, continue, reinstate, increase, or de-crease such compensation, or award compensation." 33U. S. C. $ 922.On two occasions we have construed the phrase "mistakein a determination of fact" and observed that nothing in thestatutory language supports attempts to limit it to particularkinds of factual errors or to cases involving new evidenceor changed circumstances. See O'Keeffe v. Aerojet-General515us1$72l 08-25-98 19:20:20 PAGES OPINPGT296 METROPOLITAN STEVEDORE CO. v. RAMBOOpinion of the CourtShipyards, Inc., 404 U. S. 254, 255-256 (1971) (per curiam);Banks v. Chicago Grain Trimmers Assn., Inc., 390 U. S. 459,465 (1968). The language of $ 22 also provides no supportfor Rambo's narrow construction of the phrase "change inconditions." The use of "conditions," a word in the plural,suggests that Congress did not intend to limit the bases formodifying awards to a single condition, such as an employee'sphysical health. See 2A N. Singer, Sutherland on StatutoryConstruction $ 47.34, p. 274 (5th rev. ed. 1992) (" `Ordinarilythe legislature by use of a plural term intends a reference tomore than one matter or thing' ") (quoting N. Y. StatutesLaw $ 252 (McKinney 1971)); cf. 1 U. S. C. $ 1 ("[W]ords importing the plural include the singular"). Rather, under the"normal" or "natural reading," Estate of Cowart, supra, at477, the applicable "conditions" are those that entitled theemployee to benefits in the first place, the same conditionson which continuing entitlement is predicated.Our interpretation is confirmed by the language ofLHWCA $$ 2(10) and 8(c)(21). Section 2(10) defines "[d]isability" as "incapacity because of injury to earn the wageswhich the employee was receiving at the time of injury inthe same or any other employment." 33 U. S. C. $ 902(10).For certain injuries the statute creates a conclusive presumption of incapacity to earn wages and sets compensationat 662/3% of the claimant's actual wage for a fixed numberof weeks, according to a statutory schedule. See LHWCA$$ 8(c)(1)-(20), (22), 33 U. S. C. $$ 908(c)(1)-20, (22). Whenthese types of scheduled injuries occur, a claimant simplyproves the relevant physical injury and compensation followsfor a finite period of time. See Bath Iron Works Corp. v.Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, 506U. S. 153, 156, n. 4 (1993); Potomac Elec. Power Co. v. Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, 449 U. S.268, 269 (1980). "In all other cases," however, the statuteprovides "the compensation shall be 662/3 per centum of thedifference between the average weekly wages of the em515us1$72l 08-25-98 19:20:20 PAGES OPINPGT297Cite as: 515 U. S. 291 (1995)Opinion of the Courtployee and the employee's wage-earning capacity thereafterin the same employment or otherwise, payable during thecontinuance of partial disability." LHWCA $ 8(c)(21), 33U. S. C. $ 908(c)(21). For these nonscheduled injuries, thetype at issue in this case, loss of wage-earning capacity isan element of the claimant's case, for without the statutorypresumption that accompanies scheduled injuries, a claimantis not "disabled" unless he proves "incapacity because ofinjury to earn the wages." LHWCA $ 2(10), 33 U. S. C.$ 902(10). See Bath Iron Works, supra, at 156; PotomacElec. Power Co., supra, at 269-270. These two sectionsmake it clear that compensation, as an initial matter, is predicated on loss of wage-earning capacity, and that such compensation should continue only "during the continuance ofpartial disability," LHWCA $ 8(c)(21), 33 U. S. C. $ 908(c)(21),i. e., during the continuance of the "incapacity . . . to earnthe wages," LHWCA $ 2(10), 33 U. S. C. $ 902(10). Section22 accommodates this statutory requirement by providingfor modification of an award on the ground of "a change inconditions." 33 U. S. C. $ 922.Rambo's insistence on what seems to us a " `narrowly technical and impractical construction' " of this phrase, O'Keeffe,supra, at 255 (quoting Luckenbach S. S. Co. v. Norton, 106F. 2d 137, 138 (CA3 1939)), does more than disregard theplain language of $$ 22, 2(10), and 8(c)(21). It also is inconsistent with the structure and purpose of the LHWCA.Like most other workers' compensation schemes, theLHWCA does not compensate physical injury alone but thedisability produced by that injury. See LHWCA $$ 3(a), 8,33 U. S. C. $$ 903(a), 908; see also 1C A. Larson, Law ofWorkmen's Compensation $ 57.11 (1994). Disability underthe LHWCA, defined in terms of wage-earning capacity,LHWCA $ 2(10), is in essence an economic, not a medical,concept. Cf. 3 Larson, supra, $ 81.31(e), p. 15-1150 (1995)("[D]isability in the compensation sense has an economic aswell as a medical component"). It may be ascertained for515us1$72l 08-25-98 19:20:20 PAGES OPINPGT298 METROPOLITAN STEVEDORE CO. v. RAMBOOpinion of the Courtnonscheduled injuries according to the employee's actualearnings, if they "fairly and reasonably represent his wageearning capacity," and if they do not, then with "due regardto the nature of [the employee's] injury, the degree of physical impairment, his usual employment and any other factorsor circumstances in the case which may affect his capacity toearn wages in his disabled condition, including the effect ofdisability as it may naturally extend into the future."LHWCA $ 8(h), 33 U. S. C. $ 908(h). The fundamental purpose of the Act is to compensate employees (or their beneficiaries) for wage-earning capacity lost because of injury;where that wage-earning capacity has been reduced, restored, or improved, the basis for compensation changes andthe statutory scheme allows for modification.BGiven that the language of $ 22 and the structure of theAct itself leave little doubt as to Congress' intent, any argument based on legislative history is of minimal, if any, relevance. See Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S.249, 254, (1992); Ardestani v. INS, 502 U. S. 129, 136 (1991);cf. Intercounty Constr. Corp. v. Walter, 422 U. S. 1, 8 (1975)(construing ambiguity in application of $ 22's 1-year limitations period). In any event, we find Rambo's argumentsthat the legislative history provides support for his viewlacking in force.From congressional Reports accompanying amendmentsto $ 22 in 1934, 1938, and 1984, Reports suggesting Congresswas unwilling to extend the 1-year limitations period inwhich a party may seek modification, Rambo would have usinfer that Congress intended a narrow construction of otherparts of $ 22, including the circumstances that would justifyreopening an award. We rejected this very argument inBanks, supra, at 465, and its logic continues to elude us.Congress' decision to maintain a 1-year limitations period515us1$72l 08-25-98 19:20:20 PAGES OPINPGT299Cite as: 515 U. S. 291 (1995)Opinion of the Courthas no apparent relevance to which changed conditions mayjustify modifying an award.Rambo next contends that following McCormick S. S. Co.v.United States Employees' Compensation Comm'n, 64F. 2d 84 (CA9 1933), the Courts of Appeals unanimously heldthat "change in conditions" refers only to changes in physicalconditions, so Congress' reenactment of the phrase "changein conditions" when it amended other parts of $ 22 as late as1984 must be understood to endorse that approach. Wehave often relied on Congress' "reenact[ment of] statutorylanguage that has been given a consistent judicial construction," Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bankof Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 185 (1994); see Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 566-567 (1988), in particular whereCongress was aware of or made reference to that judicialconstruction, see Brown v. Gardner, 513 U. S. 115, 121 (1994);United States v. Calamaro, 354 U. S. 351, 359 (1957). Thecases in the relevant period, however, were based on a misreading of McCormick, supra, which did not reject the ideathat $ 22 included a change in wage-earning capacity, butmerely expressed doubt that $ 22 "applies to a change inearnings due to economic conditions," 64 F. 2d, at 85; theyinvolved dicta, not holdings, see, e. g., Pillsbury v. AlaskaPackers Assn., 85 F. 2d 758, 760 (CA9 1936), rev'd on othergrounds, 301 U. S. 174 (1937); Burley Welding Works, Inc. v.Lawson, 141 F. 2d 964, 966 (CA5 1944); General DynamicsCorp. v. Director, OWCP, 673 F. 2d 23, 25, n. 6 (CA1 1982)(per curiam); and they were not uniform in their approach,see, e. g., Hole v. Miami Shipyards Corp., 640 F. 2d 769, 772(CA5 1981) ("[T]he compensation award may be modifiedyears later to reflect . . . greater or lesser economic injury").Under these circumstances, we are not persuaded that congressional silence in the reenactment of the phrase "changein conditions" carries any significance.In a related argument, Rambo criticizes petitioner's reading of $ 22 because it sweeps away an accumulation of more515us1$72l 08-25-98 19:20:20 PAGES OPINPGT300 METROPOLITAN STEVEDORE CO. v. RAMBOOpinion of the Courtthan 50 years of dicta. Far from counseling hesitation, how-ever, we think this step long overdue. "[A]ge is no antidoteto clear inconsistency with a statute," Brown v. Gardner,supra, at 122, and the dictum of Pillsbury and Burley Welding Works has not even aged with integrity, see, e. g., Fleetwood v. Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co., 16BRBS 282 (1984);LaFaille v. Benefits Review Board, U. S.Dept. of Labor, 884 F. 2d 54, 62 (CA2 1989); Avondale Shipyards, Inc. v. Guidry, 967 F. 2d 1039, 1042, n. 6 (CA5 1992)(dictum). Breath spent repeating dicta does not infuse itwith life. The unnecessary observations of these Courts ofAppeals "are neither authoritative nor persuasive." McLaren v. Fleischer, 256 U. S. 477, 482 (1921); cf. United Statesv. Estate of Donnelly, 397 U. S. 286, 295 (1970).Finally, Rambo argues that including a change in wageearning capacity as a change in conditions under $ 22 willflood the OWCP and the courts with litigation becauseparties will request modification every time an employee'swages change or the economy takes a turn in one directionor the other. Experience in the 11 years since the BenefitsReview Board decided Fleetwood, supra, suggests otherwise, but that argument is, in any case, better directed atCongress or the Director in her rulemaking capacity, seeLHWCA $ 39(a), 33 U. S. C. $ 939(a); Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., 514 U. S. 122, 134 (1995), than at thecourts. It is also based on a misconception of the LHWCAand our holding today. We recognize only that an award ina nonscheduled-injury case may be modified where there hasbeen a change in wage-earning capacity. A change in actualwages is controlling only when actual wages "fairly and reasonably represent . . . wage-earning capacity." LHWCA$ 8(h), 33 U. S. C $ 908(h). Otherwise, wage-earning capacitymay be determined according to the many factors identifiedin $ 8(h), including "any . . . factors or circumstances in thecase which may affect [the employee's] capacity to earn515us1$72l 08-25-98 19:20:20 PAGES OPINPGT301Cite as: 515 U. S. 291 (1995)Stevens, J., dissentingwages in his disabled condition, including the effect ofdisability as it may naturally extend into the future." Thiscircumspect approach does not permit a change in wage-earning capacity with every variation in actual wages ortransient change in the economy. There may be cases rais-ing difficult questions as to what constitutes a change inwage-earning capacity, but we need not address them here.Rambo acquired additional, marketable skills and the ALJ,recognizing that higher wages do not necessarily prove anincrease in wage-earning capacity, took care to account forinflation and risk of job loss in evaluating Rambo's new"wage-earning capacity in an open labor market under normal employment conditions." App. 66.We hold that a disability award may be modified under$ 22 where there is a change in the employee's wage-earningcapacity, even without any change in the employee's physicalcondition. Because Rambo raised other arguments beforethe Ninth Circuit that the panel did not have the opportunityto address, we reverse and remand for proceedings consist-ent with this opinion.
