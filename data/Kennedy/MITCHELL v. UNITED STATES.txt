Two questions relating to a criminal defendant's FifthAmendment privilege against self-incrimination are presented to us. The first is whether, in the federal criminalsystem, a guilty plea waives the privilege in the sentencingphase of the case, either as a result of the colloquy precedingthe plea or by operation of law when the plea is entered.We hold the plea is not a waiver of the privilege at sentenc-ing. The second question is whether, in determining facts*Peter Goldberger, Lisa Bondareff Kemler, and Kyle O'Dowd filed abrief for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. asamici curiae urging reversal.526US2 Unit: $U45 [01-03-01 13:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN317Cite as: 526 U. S. 314 (1999)Opinion of the Courtabout the crime which bear upon the severity of the sen-tence, a trial court may draw an adverse inference from thedefendant's silence. We hold a sentencing court may notdraw the adverse inference.IPetitioner Amanda Mitchell and 22 other defendants wereindicted for offenses arising from a conspiracy to distributecocaine in Allentown, Pennsylvania, from 1989 to 1994. Ac-cording to the indictment, the leader of the conspiracy, HarryRiddick, obtained large quantities of cocaine and resold thedrug through couriers and street sellers, including petitioner.Petitioner was charged with one count of conspiring to dis-tribute five or more kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21U. S. C. $ 846, and with three counts of distributing cocainewithin 1,000 feet of a school or playground, in violation of$ 860(a). In 1995, without any plea agreement, petitionerpleaded guilty to all four counts. She reserved the rightto contest the drug quantity attributable to her under theconspiracy count, and the District Court advised her thedrug quantity would be determined at her sentencinghearing.Before accepting the plea, the District Court made the in-quiries required by Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of CriminalProcedure. Informing petitioner of the penalties for her of-fenses, the District Judge advised her, "the range of punishment here is very complex because we don't know how muchcocaine the Government's going to be able to show you wereinvolved in." App. 39. The judge told petitioner she faceda mandatory minimum of one year in prison under $ 860 fordistributing cocaine near a school or playground. She alsofaced "serious punishment depending on the quantity involved" for the conspiracy, with a mandatory minimum of 10years in prison under $ 841 if she could be held responsiblefor at least 5 kilograms but less than 15 kilograms of cocaine.Id., at 42. By pleading guilty, the District Court explained,526US2 Unit: $U45 [01-03-01 13:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN318 MITCHELL v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtpetitioner would waive various rights, including "the rightat trial to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment."Id.,at 45.After the Government explained the factual basis for thecharges, the judge, having put petitioner under oath, askedher, "Did you do that?" Petitioner answered, "Some of it."Id., at 47. She indicated that, although present for one ofthe transactions charged as a substantive cocaine distribu-tion count, she had not herself delivered the cocaine to thecustomer. The Government maintained she was liable nev-ertheless as an aider and abettor of the delivery by anothercourier. After discussion with her counsel, petitioner reaffirmed her intention to plead guilty to all the charges. TheDistrict Court noted she might have a defense to one counton the theory that she was present but did not aid or abetthe transaction. Petitioner again confirmed her intention toplead guilty, and the District Court accepted the plea.In 1996, 9 of petitioner's original 22 codefendants wentto trial. Three other codefendants had pleaded guilty andagreed to cooperate with the Government. They testifiedpetitioner was a regular seller for ringleader Riddick. Atpetitioner's sentencing hearing, the three adopted their trialtestimony, and one of them furnished additional informationon the amount of cocaine petitioner sold. According to him,petitioner worked two to three times a week, selling 11/2 to 2ounces of cocaine a day, from April 1992 to August 1992.Then, from August 1992 to December 1993 she worked threeto five times a week, and from January 1994 to March 1994she was one of those in charge of cocaine distribution forRiddick. On cross-examination, the codefendant concededhe had not seen petitioner on a regular basis during the relevant period.Both petitioner and the Government referred to trial testimony by one Alvitta Mack, who had made a series of drugbuys under the supervision of law enforcement agents, including three purchases from petitioner totaling two ounces526US2 Unit: $U45 [01-03-01 13:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN319Cite as: 526 U. S. 314 (1999)Opinion of the Courtof cocaine in 1992. Petitioner put on no evidence at sentenc-ing, nor did she testify to rebut the Government's evidenceabout drug quantity. Her counsel argued, however, that thethree documented sales to Mack constituted the only evidence of sufficient reliability to be credited in determiningthe quantity of cocaine attributable to her for sentencingpurposes.After this testimony at the sentencing hearing the DistrictCourt ruled that, as a consequence of her guilty plea, petitioner had no right to remain silent with respect to the de-tails of her crimes. The court found credible the testimonyindicating petitioner had been a drug courier on a regularbasis. Sales of 11/2 to 2 ounces twice a week for a year anda half put her over the 5-kilogram threshold, thus mandatinga minimum sentence of 10 years. "One of the things" persuading the court to rely on the testimony of the codefend-ants was petitioner's "not testifying to the contrary."Id.,at 95.The District Judge told petitioner:" `I held it against you that you didn't come forwardtoday and tell me that you really only did this a coupleof times. . . . I'm taking the position that you shouldcome forward and explain your side of this issue." `Your counsel's taking the position that you have aFifth Amendment right not to. . . . If he's--if it's deter-mined by a higher Court that he's right in that regard,I would be willing to bring you back for resentencing.And if you--if--and then I might take a closer look atthe [codefendants'] testimony.' " Id., at 98-99.The District Court sentenced petitioner to the statutoryminimum of 10 years of imprisonment, 6 years of supervisedrelease, and a special assessment of $200.The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed thesentence. 122 F. 3d 185 (1997). According to the Court ofAppeals: "By voluntarily and knowingly pleading guilty to526US2 Unit: $U45 [01-03-01 13:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN320 MITCHELL v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtthe offense Mitchell waived her Fifth Amendment privilege."Id., at 189. The court acknowledged other Circuits haveheld a witness can "claim the Fifth Amendment privilege ifhis or her testimony might be used to enhance his or hersentence," id., at 190 (citing United States v. Garcia, 78 F. 3d1457, 1463, and n. 8 (CA10), cert. denied, 517 U. S. 1239(1996)), but it said this rule "does not withstand analysis,"122 F. 3d, at 191. The court thought it would be illogical to"fragment the sentencing process," retaining the privilegeagainst self-incrimination as to one or more components ofthe crime while waiving it as to others.Ibid. Petitioner'sreservation of the right to contest the amount of drugsattributable to her did not change the court's analysis. Inthe Court of Appeals' view:"Mitchell opened herself up to the full range of possiblesentences for distributing cocaine when she was toldduring her plea colloquy that the penalty for conspiringto distribute cocaine had a maximum of life imprisonment. While her reservation may have put the government to its proof as to the amount of drugs, her declination to testify on that issue could properly be heldagainst her." Ibid.The court acknowledged a defendant may plead guilty andretain the privilege with respect to other crimes, but it observed: "Mitchell does not claim that she could be implicatedin other crimes by testifying at her sentencing hearing, norcould she be retried by the state for the same offense."Ibid. (citing 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. $ 111 (1998), a statute thatbars, with certain exceptions, a state prosecution followinga federal conviction based on the same conduct).Judge Michel concurred, reasoning that any error by theDistrict Court in drawing an adverse factual inference frompetitioner's silence was harmless because "the evidenceamply supported [the judge's] finding on quantity" even with526US2 Unit: $U45 [01-03-01 13:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN321Cite as: 526 U. S. 314 (1999)Opinion of the Courtout consideration of petitioner's failure to testify. 122 F. 3d,at 192.Other Circuits to have confronted the issue have held thata defendant retains the privilege at sentencing. See, e. g.,United States v. Kuku, 129 F. 3d 1435, 1437-1438 (CA111997);United States v. Garcia, 78 F. 3d 1457, 1463 (CA101996); United States v. De La Cruz, 996 F. 2d 1307, 1312-1313(CA1 1993); United States v. Hernandez, 962 F. 2d 1152, 1161(CA5 1992); Bank One of Cleveland, N. A. v. Abbe, 916 F. 2d1067, 1075-1076 (CA6 1990); United States v. Lugg, 892 F. 2d101, 102-103 (CADC 1989); United States v. Paris, 827 F. 2d395, 398-399 (CA9 1987). We granted certiorari to resolvethe apparent Circuit conflict created by the Court of Appeals'decision, 524 U. S. 925 (1998), and we now reverse.IIThe Government maintains that petitioner's guilty pleawas a waiver of the privilege against compelled selfincrimination with respect to all the crimes comprehendedin the plea. We hold otherwise and rule that petitionerretained the privilege at her sentencing hearing.AIt is well established that a witness, in a single proceeding,may not testify voluntarily about a subject and then invokethe privilege against self-incrimination when questionedabout the details. See Rogers v. United States, 340 U. S.367, 373 (1951). The privilege is waived for the matters towhich the witness testifies, and the scope of the "waiver isdetermined by the scope of relevant cross-examination,"Brown v. United States, 356 U. S. 148, 154-155 (1958). "Thewitness himself, certainly if he is a party, determines thearea of disclosure and therefore of inquiry,"id., at 155. Nicequestions will arise, of course, about the extent of the initialtestimony and whether the ensuing questions are compre526US2 Unit: $U45 [01-03-01 13:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN322 MITCHELL v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courthended within its scope, but for now it suffices to note thegeneral rule.The justifications for the rule of waiver in the testimonialcontext are evident: A witness may not pick and choose whataspects of a particular subject to discuss without castingdoubt on the trustworthiness of the statements and dimin-ishing the integrity of the factual inquiry. As noted inRogers, a contrary rule "would open the way to distortion offacts by permitting a witness to select any stopping place inthe testimony," 340 U. S., at 371. It would, as we said inBrown, "make of the Fifth Amendment not only a humanesafeguard against judicially coerced self-disclosure but apositive invitation to mutilate the truth a party offers totell," 356 U. S., at 156. The illogic of allowing a witness tooffer only self-selected testimony should be obvious even tothe witness, so there is no unfairness in allowing crossexamination when testimony is given without invoking theprivilege.We may assume for purposes of this opinion, then, that ifpetitioner had pleaded not guilty and, having taken the standat a trial, testified she did "some of it," she could have beencross-examined on the frequency of her drug deliveries andthe quantity of cocaine involved. The concerns which justify the cross-examination when the defendant testifies areabsent at a plea colloquy, however. The purpose of a pleacolloquy is to protect the defendant from an unintelligentor involuntary plea. The Government would turn this constitutional shield into a prosecutorial sword by having thedefendant relinquish all rights against compelled selfincrimination upon entry of a guilty plea, including the rightto remain silent at sentencing.There is no convincing reason why the narrow inquiry atthe plea colloquy should entail such an extensive waiver ofthe privilege. Unlike the defendant taking the stand, who"cannot reasonably claim that the Fifth Amendment giveshim . . . an immunity from cross-examination on the matters526US2 Unit: $U45 [01-03-01 13:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN323Cite as: 526 U. S. 314 (1999)Opinion of the Courthe has himself put in dispute," id., at 155-156, the defendantwho pleads guilty puts nothing in dispute regarding the essentials of the offense. Rather, the defendant takes thosematters out of dispute, often by making a joint statementwith the prosecution or confirming the prosecution's versionof the facts. Under these circumstances, there is little dan-ger that the court will be misled by selective disclosure. Inthis respect a guilty plea is more like an offer to stipulatethan a decision to take the stand. Here, petitioner's statement that she had done "some of " the proffered conduct didnot pose a threat to the integrity of factfinding proceedings,for the purpose of the District Court's inquiry was simply toensure that petitioner understood the charges and that therewas a factual basis for the Government's case.Nor does Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11, whichgoverns pleas, contemplate the broad waiver the Government envisions. Rule 11 directs the district court, beforeaccepting a guilty plea, to ascertain the defendant understands he or she is giving up "the right to be tried by a juryand at that trial . . . the right against compelled selfincrimination." Rule 11(c)(3). The transcript of the pleacolloquy in this case discloses that the District Court tookcare to comply with this and the other provisions of Rule 11.The District Court correctly instructed petitioner: "You havethe right at trial to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment, or at your option, you can take the stand and tell thejury your side of this controversy. . . . If you plead guilty, allof those rights are gone." App. 45.Neither the Rule itself nor the District Court's explicationof it indicates that the defendant consents to take the standin the sentencing phase or to suffer adverse consequencesfrom declining to do so. Both the Rule and the DistrictCourt's admonition were to the effect that by entry of theplea petitioner would surrender the right "at trial" to invokethe privilege. As there was to be no trial, the warningwould not have brought home to petitioner that she was also526US2 Unit: $U45 [01-03-01 13:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN324 MITCHELL v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtwaiving the right to self-incrimination at sentencing. Thepurpose of Rule 11 is to inform the defendant of what sheloses by forgoing the trial, not to elicit a waiver of the privi-lege for proceedings still to follow. A waiver of a right totrial with its attendant privileges is not a waiver of the privileges which exist beyond the confines of the trial.Of course, a court may discharge its duty of ensuring afactual basis for a plea by "question[ing] the defendant underoath, on the record, and in the presence of counsel about theoffense to which the defendant has pleaded." Rule 11(c)(5).We do not question the authority of a district court to makewhatever inquiry it deems necessary in its sound discretionto assure itself the defendant is not being pressured to offera plea for which there is no factual basis. A defendant whowithholds information by invoking the privilege againstself-incrimination at a plea colloquy runs the risk the districtcourt will find the factual basis inadequate. At least oncethe plea has been accepted, statements or admissions madeduring the preceding plea colloquy are later admissibleagainst the defendant, as is the plea itself. A statement admissible against a defendant, however, is not necessarily awaiver of the privilege against self-incrimination. Rule 11does not prevent the defendant from relying upon the privilege at sentencing.Treating a guilty plea as a waiver of the privilege atsentencing would be a grave encroachment on the rights ofdefendants. At oral argument, we asked counsel for theUnited States whether, on the facts of this case, if the Government had no reliable evidence of the amount of drugs involved, the prosecutor "could say, well, we can't prove it, butwe'd like to put her on the stand and cross-examine her andsee if we can't get her to admit it." Tr. of Oral Arg. 45.Counsel answered: "[T]he waiver analysis that we have putforward suggests that at least as to the facts surroundingthe conspiracy to which she admitted, the Government coulddo that." Ibid. Over 90% of federal criminal defendants526US2 Unit: $U45 [01-03-01 13:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN325Cite as: 526 U. S. 314 (1999)Opinion of the Courtwhose cases are not dismissed enter pleas of guilty or nolocontendere. U. S. Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics 1996, p. 448(24th ed. 1997). Were we to accept the Government's position, prosecutors could indict without specifying the quantityof drugs involved, obtain a guilty plea, and then put the defendant on the stand at sentencing to fill in the drug quantity.The result would be to enlist the defendant as an instrumentin his or her own condemnation, undermining the long tradi-tion and vital principle that criminal proceedings rely on accusations proved by the Government, not on inquisitions con-ducted to enhance its own prosecutorial power.Rogers v.Richmond, 365 U. S. 534, 541 (1961) ("[O]urs is an accusator-ial and not an inquisitorial system").We reject the position that either petitioner's guilty pleaor her statements at the plea colloquy functioned as a waiverof her right to remain silent at sentencing.BThe centerpiece of the Third Circuit's opinion is the ideathat the entry of the guilty plea completes the incriminationof the defendant, thus extinguishing the privilege. Wherea sentence has yet to be imposed, however, this Court hasalready rejected the proposition that " `incrimination is com-plete once guilt has been adjudicated,' " Estelle v. Smith, 451U. S. 454, 462 (1981), and we reject it again today.The Court of Appeals cited Wigmore on Evidence for theproposition that upon conviction " `criminality ceases; andwith criminality the privilege.' " 122 F. 3d, at 191 (citing 8J. Wigmore, Evidence $ 2279, p. 481 (J. McNaughton rev.1961)). The passage relied upon does not support the ThirdCircuit's narrow view of the privilege. The full passage isas follows: "Legal criminality consists in liability to the law'spunishment. When that liability is removed, criminalityceases; and with the criminality the privilege."Ibid. Itcould be argued that liability for punishment continues until526US2 Unit: $U45 [01-03-01 13:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN326 MITCHELL v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtsentence has been imposed, and so does the privilege. Evenif the Court of Appeals' interpretation of the treatise werecorrect, however, and it means the privilege ceases upon con-viction but before sentencing, we would respond that thesuggested rule is simply wrong. A later supplement to thetreatise, indeed, states the proper rule that, "[a]lthough thewitness has pleaded guilty to a crime charged but has notbeen sentenced, his constitutional privilege remains unim-paired." J. Wigmore, Evidence $ 2279, p. 991, n. 1 (A. Bested. Supp. 1998).It is true, as a general rule, that where there can be nofurther incrimination, there is no basis for the assertion ofthe privilege. We conclude that principle applies to casesin which the sentence has been fixed and the judgment ofconviction has become final. See, e. g., Reina v. UnitedStates, 364 U. S. 507, 513 (1960). If no adverse consequencescan be visited upon the convicted person by reason of furthertestimony, then there is no further incrimination to befeared.Where the sentence has not yet been imposed a defendantmay have a legitimate fear of adverse consequences fromfurther testimony. As the Court stated in Estelle: "Any effort by the State to compel [the defendant] to testify againsthis will at the sentencing hearing clearly would contravenethe Fifth Amendment." 451 U. S., at 463. Estelle was acapital case, but we find no reason not to apply the principleto noncapital sentencing hearings as well. "The essence ofthis basic constitutional principle is `the requirement thatthe State which proposes to convict and punish an individualproduce the evidence against him by the independent laborof its officers, not by the simple, cruel expedient of forcing itfrom his own lips.' " Id., at 462 (emphasis in original) (quoting Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U. S. 568, 581-582 (1961)).The Government itself makes the implicit concession that theacceptance of a guilty plea does not eliminate the possibilityof further incrimination. In its brief to the Court, the Gov526US2 Unit: $U45 [01-03-01 13:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN327Cite as: 526 U. S. 314 (1999)Opinion of the Courternment acknowledges that a defendant who awaits sen-tencing after having pleaded guilty may assert the privilegeagainst self-incrimination if called as a witness in the trial ofa codefendant, in part because of the danger of responding"to questions that might have an adverse impact on hissentence or on his prosecution for other crimes." Brieffor United States 31.The Fifth Amendment by its terms prevents a person frombeing "compelled in any criminal case to be a witness againsthimself." U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. To maintain that sentencing proceedings are not part of "any criminal case" is con-trary to the law and to common sense. As to the law, underthe Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, a court must im-pose sentence before a judgment of conviction can issue.See Rule 32(d)(1) ("A judgment of conviction must set forththe plea . . . and the sentence"); cf. Mempa v. Rhay, 389 U. S.128, 134 (1967). As to common sense, it appears that in thiscase, as is often true in the criminal justice system, the defendant was less concerned with the proof of her guilt orinnocence than with the severity of her punishment. Petitioner faced imprisonment from one year upwards to life,depending on the circumstances of the crime. To say thatshe had no right to remain silent but instead could be com-pelled to cooperate in the deprivation of her liberty wouldignore the Fifth Amendment privilege at the precise stagewhere, from her point of view, it was most important. Ourrule is applicable whether or not the sentencing hearing isdeemed a proceeding separate from the Rule 11 hearing, anissue we need not resolve. IIIThe Government suggests in a footnote that even ifpetitioner retained an unwaived privilege against selfincrimination in the sentencing phase of her case, the Dis-trict Court was entitled, based on her silence, to draw anadverse inference with regard to the amount of drugs attrib-utable to her. Brief for United States 31-32, n. 18. The526US2 Unit: $U45 [01-03-01 13:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN328 MITCHELL v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtnormal rule in a criminal case is that no negative inferencefrom the defendant's failure to testify is permitted.Griffinv. California, 380 U. S. 609, 614 (1965). We decline to adoptan exception for the sentencing phase of a criminal case withregard to factual determinations respecting the circumstances and details of the crime.This Court has recognized "the prevailing rule that theFifth Amendment does not forbid adverse inferences againstparties to civil actions when they refuse to testify in response to probative evidence offered against them," Baxterv.Palmigiano, 425 U. S. 308, 318 (1976), at least where refusal to waive the privilege does not lead "automatically andwithout more to [the] imposition of sanctions," Lefkowitz v.Cunningham, 431 U. S. 801, 808, n. 5 (1977). In ordinarycivil cases, the party confronted with the invocation of theprivilege by the opposing side has no capacity to avoid it, say,by offering immunity from prosecution. The rule allowinginvocation of the privilege, though at the risk of suffering anadverse inference or even a default, accommodates the rightnot to be a witness against oneself while still permitting civillitigation to proceed. Another reason for treating civil andcriminal cases differently is that "the stakes are higher" incriminal cases, where liberty or even life may be at stake,and where the government's "sole interest is to convict."Baxter, 425 U. S., at 318-319.Baxter itself involved state prison disciplinary proceedingswhich, as the Court noted, "are not criminal proceedings"and "involve the correctional process and important stateinterests other than conviction for crime." Id., at 316, 319.Cf. Ohio Adult Parole Authority v. Woodard, 523 U. S. 272(1998) (adverse inference permissible from silence in clemency proceeding, a nonjudicial postconviction process whichis not part of the criminal case). Unlike a prison disciplinary proceeding, a sentencing hearing is part of the criminalcase--the explicit concern of the self-incrimination privilege.In accordance with the text of the Fifth Amendment, we526US2 Unit: $U45 [01-03-01 13:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN329Cite as: 526 U. S. 314 (1999)Opinion of the Courtmust accord the privilege the same protection in the sentenc-ing phase of "any criminal case" as that which is due in thetrial phase of the same case, see Griffin, supra.The concerns which mandate the rule against negative inferences at a criminal trial apply with equal force at sentencing. Without question, the stakes are high: Here, the infer-ence drawn by the District Court from petitioner's silencemay have resulted in decades of added imprisonment. TheGovernment often has a motive to demand a severe sentence,so the central purpose of the privilege--to protect a defend-ant from being the unwilling instrument of his or her owncondemnation--remains of vital importance.Our holding today is a product of existing precedent, notonly Griffin but also by Estelle v. Smith, in which the Courtcould "discern no basis to distinguish between the guilt andpenalty phases of respondent's capital murder trial so far asthe protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege is concerned." 451 U. S., at 462-463. Although Estelle was acapital case, its reasoning applies with full force here, wherethe Government seeks to use petitioner's silence to infercommission of disputed criminal acts. See supra, at 326.To say that an adverse factual inference may be drawn fromsilence at a sentencing hearing held to determine the specifics of the crime is to confine Griffin by ignoring Estelle.We are unwilling to truncate our precedents in this way.The rule against adverse inferences from a defendant'ssilence in criminal proceedings, including sentencing, is ofproven utility. Some years ago the Court expressed concern that "[t]oo many, even those who should be better advised, view this privilege as a shelter for wrongdoers. Theytoo readily assume that those who invoke it are either guiltyof crime or commit perjury in claiming the privilege." Ullmann v. United States, 350 U. S. 422, 426 (1956). Later, itquoted with apparent approval Wigmore's observation that" `[t]he layman's natural first suggestion would probably bethat the resort to privilege in each instance is a clear confes526US2 Unit: $U45 [01-03-01 13:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN330 MITCHELL v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtsion of crime,' " Lakeside v. Oregon, 435 U. S. 333, 340, n. 10(1978) (quoting 8 Wigmore, Evidence $ 2272, at 426). It isfar from clear that citizens, and jurors, remain today so skep-tical of the principle or are often willing to ignore the prohibition against adverse inferences from silence. Principlesonce unsettled can find general and wide acceptance in thelegal culture, and there can be little doubt that the rule prohibiting an inference of guilt from a defendant's rightful si-lence has become an essential feature of our legal tradition.This process began even before Griffin. When Griffin wasbeing considered by this Court, some 44 States did not allowa prosecutor to invite the jury to make an adverse inferencefrom the defendant's refusal to testify at trial. See Griffin,supra, at 611, n. 3. The rule against adverse inferences is avital instrument for teaching that the question in a criminalcase is not whether the defendant committed the acts ofwhich he is accused. The question is whether the Government has carried its burden to prove its allegations whilerespecting the defendant's individual rights. The Government retains the burden of proving facts relevant to thecrime at the sentencing phase and cannot enlist the defendant in this process at the expense of the self-incriminationprivilege. Whether silence bears upon the determination ofa lack of remorse, or upon acceptance of responsibility forpurposes of the downward adjustment provided in $ 3E1.1of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (1998), is a separate question. It is not before us, and we express no viewon it.By holding petitioner's silence against her in determining the facts of the offense at the sentencing hearing, theDistrict Court imposed an impermissible burden on the exercise of the constitutional right against compelled selfincrimination. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.
