The federal bribery statute prohibits defrauding organiza-tions which "receiv[e], in any one year period, benefits inexcess of $10,000 under a Federal program." 18 U. S. C.$ 666(b).

UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courttion which performed billing audits for health care organiza-tions. In 1993 petitioner, on QMC's behalf, negotiated a $1.2million loan from West Volusia Hospital Authority (WVHA),a municipal agency responsible for operating two hospitalslocated in West Volusia County, Florida. Both hospitalsparticipate in the Medicare program, and in 1993 WVHAreceived between $10 and $15 million in Medicare funds.A February 1994 audit of WVHA's financial affairs raisedquestions about the QMC loan. An investigation revealedQMC used the loan proceeds to repay creditors and to raisethe salaries of its five owner-employees, including petitioner.It was determined that petitioner had arranged for QMC toadvance at least $100,000 to a private company owned by anindividual who had assisted QMC in securing a letter ofcredit in connection with the WVHA loan. QMC, at petitioner's directive, also committed portions of the loan proceeds to speculative securities. These investments yieldedlosses of almost $400,000. The investigation further uncovered use of the loan proceeds to pay, through an intermediatetransfer, a $10,000 kickback to WVHA's chief financial officer,the individual with whom petitioner had negotiated the loanin the first instance. QMC defaulted on its obligation toWVHA and filed for bankruptcy.In 1996 petitioner was indicted by a federal grand jury on13 counts, including charges of defrauding an organizationwhich receives benefits under a federal assistance program,18 U. S. C. $ 666(a)(1)(A), and of paying a kickback to one ofits agents, $ 666(a)(2). A jury convicted petitioner on allcounts charged, and the District Court sentenced him to 65months' imprisonment and a 3-year term of supervisedrelease. Petitioner, in addition, was ordered to pay $1.2million in restitution.On appeal petitioner argued that the Government failed toprove WVHA, as the organization affected by his wrongdoing, received "benefits in excess of $10,000 under a Federalprogram," as required by 18 U.

S. C. $ 1395 et seq. (1994 ed. and Supp. III), Medicare is afederally funded medical insurance program for the elderlyand disabled. In fiscal 1997 some 38.8 million individualswere enrolled in the program, and over 6,100 hospitals wereauthorized to provide services to them. U. S. Dept. ofHealth and Human Services, Health Care Financing Admin-istration, 1998 Data Compendium 45, 75 (Aug. 1998). Medi529US3 Unit: $U55 [09-26-01 13:01:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN672 FISCHER v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtcare expenditures for hospital services exceeded $123 billionin 1998, making the Federal Government the single largestsource of funds for participating hospitals. See Cowenet al., National Health Expenditures, 1998, 21 Health CareFinancing Review 165, 208 (Winter 1999) (Table 11). Thisamount constituted 32% of the hospitals' total receipts.Ibid.Providers of health care services, such as the two hospitalsoperated by WVHA, qualify to participate in the programupon satisfying a comprehensive series of statutory andregulatory requirements, including particular accreditationstandards. Hospitals, for instance, must satisfy licensingstandards, 42 CFR $ 482.11 (1999); possess a governing bodyto "ensure that there is an effective, hospital-wide qualityassurance program to evaluate the provision of patient care,"$ 482.21; and employ a "well organized" medical staff accountable on matters relating to "the quality of the medical careprovided to patients," $ 482.22(b). Medicare's implementingregulations also require hospitals, among many other standards, to maintain and provide 24-hour nursing services,$ 482.23; complete medical record services, $ 482.24; "pharmaceutical services that meet the needs of the patients,"$ 482.25; and organized dietary services staffed with qualifiedpersonnel, $ 482.28. The regulations go further, requiringhospital facilities to "be constructed, arranged, and maintained to ensure the safety of the patient, and to providefacilities for diagnosis and treatment and for special hospital services appropriate to the needs of the community."$ 482.41. Compliance with these standards provides theGovernment with assurance that participating providers possess the capacity to fulfill their statutory obligation of providing "medically necessary" services "of a quality whichmeets professionally recognized standards of health care."42 U. S. C. $ 1320c-5(a). Peer review organizations monitorproviders' compliance with these and other obligations.$ 1320c-3(a); 42 CFR $ 466.71 (1999).

C.$ 1320c-5(b)(1).Medicare attains its objectives through an elaborate fund-ing structure. Participating health care organizations, inexchange for rendering services, receive federal funds ona periodic basis. $$ 1395g, 1395l. The amounts receivedreflect the "reasonable cost" of services rendered, definedas "the costs necessary in the efficient delivery of neededhealth services to individuals covered [by the program]."$ 1395x(v)(1)(A). Necessary costs are not limited to the im-mediate costs of an individual treatment procedure. Insteadthey are defined in broader terms: "Necessary and propercosts are costs that are appropriate and helpful in developingand maintaining the operation of patient care facilities andactivities." 42 CFR $ 413.9(b)(2) (1999). Allowable costsinclude amounts which enhance the organization's capacityto provide ongoing, quality services not only to eligible patients but also to the community at large. By way of example, amounts incurred for "certain educational programs forinterns and residents, known as [graduate medical education]programs, are `allowable cost[s]' for which a hospital (a provider) may receive reimbursement." Regions Hospital v.Shalala, 522 U. S. 448, 452 (1998) (citing 42 CFR $ 413.85(a)(1996)); see also $ 413.85(b) (1999); Thomas Jefferson Univ.v. Shalala, 512 U. S. 504, 507-508 (1994) (describing regulation of education programs). "These programs," the Medicare regulations explain, "contribute to the quality of patientcare within an institution and are necessary to meet the community's needs for medical and paramedical personnel. . . .[M]any communities have not assumed responsibility for financing these programs and it is necessary that support beprovided by those purchasing healthcare. Until communities undertake to bear these costs, the program will participate appropriately in the support of these activities." 42CFR $ 413.85(c) (1999). Medicare also permits, indeed encourages, these providers to deposit the amounts of reim529US3 Unit: $U55 [09-26-01 13:01:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN674 FISCHER v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtbursements received for depreciation costs and other cashinto sinking funds called "funded depreciation accounts."$ 413.134(e). Investment income earned on these funds doesnot operate to reduce a provider's interest expense,$ 413.153(b)(2)(iii), creating incentives to maintain modernmedical equipment and facilities.The Medicare regulations, furthermore, afford certain provider organizations "special treatment," intended to ensurethe ongoing availability of medical services for qualifyingpatients. See 42 CFR pt. 412G (1999). Providers qualify-ing as "Medicare-dependent, small rural hospital[s]," for instance, are entitled to additional, "lump sum" payments tocompensate for significant declines in demand for patientcare. $ 412.108. The additional funds enable a provider to"maintai[n] [its] necessary core staff and services" and to satisfy its "fixed (and semi-fixed) costs." $$ 412.108(d)(3)(A),(B). So too does the Medicare program authorize "specialtreatment" for, among other providers, "sole community hospitals," "renal transplantation centers," and "hospitals thatserve a disproportionate share of low-income patients." See$$ 412.92, 412.100, 412.106. The subsidies assist providers insatisfying those financial obligations necessary to continue asgoing concerns in accordance with the program's requirements. See, e. g., $ 412.92(d)(2).In the normal course Medicare disbursements occur on aperiodic basis, often in advance of a provider's renderingservices, 42 U. S. C. $ 1395g(a); 42 CFR $$ 413.60, 413.64(1999). The payment system serves to "protect providers'liquidity," Good Samaritan Hospital v. Shalala, 508 U. S.402, 406 (1993), thereby assisting in the ongoing provision ofservices. 42 CFR $ 413.5(b)(1) (1999) (requiring reimbursement method to "result in current payment so that institutions will not be disadvantaged, as they sometimes are underother arrangements, by having to put up money for the purchase of goods and services well before they receive reimbursement"); $ 413.5(b)(6) (reimbursement system must oper529US3 Unit: $U55 [09-26-01 13:01:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN675Cite as: 529 U. S. 667 (2000)Opinion of the Courtate under "recognition of the need of hospitals and otherproviders to keep pace with growing needs and to make improvements"). The program, then, establishes correlatingand reinforcing incentives: The Government has an interestin making available a high level of quality of care for theelderly and disabled; and providers, because of their financialdependence upon the program, have incentives to achieveprogram goals. The nature of the program bears on thequestion of statutory coverage.BSection 666 of Title 18 of the United States Code prohibitsacts of theft and fraud against organizations receiving fundsunder federal assistance programs. The statute in relevantpart provides as follows:"(a) Whoever, if the circumstance described in sub-section (b) of this section exists--"(1) being an agent of an organization, or of a State,local, or Indian tribal government, or any agencythereof--"(A) embezzles, steals, obtains by fraud, or otherwisewithout authority knowingly converts to the use of anyperson other than the rightful owner or intentionallymisapplies, property that--"(i) is valued at $5,000 or more, and"(ii) is owned by, or is under the care, custody, or con-trol of such organization, government, or agency; or"(B) corruptly solicits or demands for the benefit ofany person, or accepts or agrees to accept, anything ofvalue from any person, intending to be influenced orrewarded in connection with any business, transaction,or series of transactions of such organization, govern-ment, or agency involving anything of value of $5,000 ormore; or"(2) corruptly gives, offers, or agrees to give anythingof value to any person, with intent to influence or re529US3 Unit: $U55 [09-26-01 13:01:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN676 FISCHER v.

Those benefits can bein the form of "a grant, contract, subsidy, loan, guarantee,insurance, or other form of Federal assistance." Ibid. Allagree Medicare is a federal assistance program, see 42 CFR$ 400.200 (1999), and that WVHA, as the organization defrauded by petitioner's actions, received in excess of $10,000in payments under the program. The sole point in contention is whether those payments constituted "benefits" withinthe meaning of subsection (b).Petitioner argues that the Medicare program providesbenefits to the elderly and disabled but not to the health careorganizations. Provider organizations, in petitioner's view,do no more than render services in exchange for compensation. Under petitioner's submission the Medicare programenvisions a single beneficiary, the qualifying patient. TheGovernment, in opposition, urges that a determination529US3 Unit: $U55 [09-26-01 13:01:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN677Cite as: 529 U. S. 667 (2000)Opinion of the Courtwhether an organization receives "benefits" within themeaning of $ 666(b) turns on whether the Federal Government was the source of the payment. Funds received undera federal assistance program, the Government asserts, canbe traced from federal coffers, often through an intermediaryor carrier, to the health care provider. Under its view, the"federal-program source of the funds" satisfies the benefitsdefinition. Brief for United States 11.We reject petitioner's reading of the statute but withoutendorsing the Government's broader position. We concludeMedicare payments are "benefits," as the term is used in itsordinary sense and as it is intended in the statute. Thenoun "benefit" means "something that guards, aids, or promotes well-being: advantage, good"; "useful aid"; "payment,gift [such as] financial help in time of sickness, old age, orunemployment"; or "a cash payment or service providedfor under an annuity, pension plan, or insurance policy."Webster's Third New International Dictionary 204 (1971).These definitions support petitioner's assertion that qualifying patients receive benefits under the Medicare program.It is commonplace for individuals to refer to their retirementor health plans as "benefits." So it ought not to be disputedthat the elderly and disabled rank as the primary beneficiaries of the Medicare program. See 42 U. S. C. $$ 1395c, 1395j;42 CFR $ 400.202 (1999) (defining "beneficiary" as the "person who is entitled to Medicare benefits"); Shalala v. Guernsey Memorial Hospital, 514 U. S. 87, 91 (1995) ("Under theMedicare reimbursement scheme . . . participating hospitalsfurnish services to program beneficiaries and are reimbursedby the Secretary through fiscal intermediaries"); Good Samaritan Hospital, 508 U. S., at 404 (same).That one beneficiary of an assistance program can be identified does not foreclose the existence of others, however. Inthis respect petitioner's construction would give incompletemeaning to the term "benefits." Medicare operates with apurpose and design above and beyond point-of-sale patient529US3 Unit: $U55 [09-26-01 13:01:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN678 FISCHER v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtcare, and it follows that the benefits of the program extendin a broader manner as well. The argument limiting theterm "benefits" to the program's targeted or primary bene-ficiaries would exclude, for example, a Medicare intermediary (such as Blue Cross and Blue Shield), a result both par-ties disavow. For present purposes it cannot be disputedthe providers themselves derive significant advantage bysatisfying the participation standards imposed by the Gov-ernment. These advantages constitute benefits within themeaning of the federal bribery statute, a statute we havedescribed as "expansive," "both as to the [conduct] forbiddenand the entities covered." Salinas v. United States, 522U. S. 52, 56 (1997).Subsection (b) identifies several sources as providing benefits under a federal program--"a grant, contract, subsidy,loan, guarantee, insurance, or other form of Federal assistance." 18 U. S. C. $ 666(b). This language indicates thatCongress viewed many federal assistance programs as providing benefits to participating organizations. Coupled withthe broad substantive prohibitions of subsection (a), the language of subsection (b) reveals Congress' expansive, unambiguous intent to ensure the integrity of organizations participating in federal assistance programs.Subsection (c) of the statute bears on the analysis. Theprovision removes from the statute's coverage any "bona fidesalary, wages, fees, or other compensation paid, or expensespaid or reimbursed, in the usual course of business."$ 666(c). Petitioner argues that the subsection operates toexclude the payments in question because they are either"compensation" or "expenses paid or reimbursed," or somecombination of the two, and that the payments are made inthe "usual course of business." We disagree.The subsection provides that the specified sorts of payments are not ones to which the section applies. One inference from this formulation is that the described paymentswould have been benefits but for the subsection (c) exemp529US3 Unit: $U55 [09-26-01 13:01:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN679Cite as: 529 U. S. 667 (2000)Opinion of the Courttion. We need not go so far. Even assuming the examplesof subsection (c) bear upon the definition of benefits, statutory examples of nonapplicability do not necessarily give riseto the inference that absent the enumeration the statutewould otherwise apply. To define all subsection (c) pay-ments as exempted benefits would go well beyond the ordinary meaning of the word. On the other hand, the statuteis not written to say: "The term `benefits' does not includebona fide salary, wages, fees, or other compensation paid, orexpenses paid or reimbursed, in the usual course of busi-ness." We must construe the term "benefits," then, in amanner consistent with Congress' intent not to reach theenumerated class of transactions. See S. Rep. No. 98-225,p. 370 (1984) ("[N]ot every Federal contract or disbursementof funds would be covered [under $ 666]. For example, if agovernment agency lawfully purchases more than $10,000 inequipment from a supplier, it is not the intent of this sectionto make a theft of $5,000 or more from the supplier a Federal crime").We do not accept the view that the Medicare paymentshere in question are for the limited purposes of compensatingproviders or reimbursing them for ordinary course expenditures. The payments are made for significant and substantial reasons in addition to compensation or reimbursement,so that neither these terms nor the usual course of businessconditions set forth in subsection (c) are met here. The payments in question have attributes and purposes well beyondthose described in subsection (c). These attributes and purposes are consistent with the definition of "benefit." Whilethe payments might have similarities to payments an insurerwould remit to a hospital quite without regard to the Medicare program, the Government does not make the paymentunless the hospital complies with its intricate regulatoryscheme. The payments are made not simply to reimbursefor treatment of qualifying patients but to assist the hospitalin making available and maintaining a certain level and qual529US3 Unit: $U55 [09-26-01 13:01:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN680 FISCHER v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtity of medical care, all in the interest of both the hospitaland the greater community.Here, as we have explained, the provider itself is the ob-ject of substantial Government regulation. Medicare is designed to the end that the Government receives not only re-ciprocal value from isolated transactions but also long-termadvantages from the existence of a sound and effectivehealth care system for the elderly and disabled. The Gov-ernment enacted specific statutes and regulations to secureits own interests in promoting the well being and advantageof the health care provider, in addition to the patient whoreceives care. The health care provider is receiving a benefit in the conventional sense of the term, unlike the case of acontractor whom the Government does not regulate or assistfor long-term objectives or for significant purposes beyondperformance of an immediate transaction. Adequate payment and assistance to the health care provider is itself oneof the objectives of the program. These purposes and effects suffice to make the payment a benefit within the meaning of the statute.The structure and operation of the Medicare programreveal a comprehensive federal assistance enterprise aimedat ensuring the availability of quality health care forthe broader community. Participating health care organizations, as our above discussion shows, must satisfy a seriesof qualification and accreditation requirements, standardsaimed in part at ensuring the provision of a certain qualityof care. See 42 CFR pt. 482 (1999). By reimbursing participating providers for a wide range of costs and expenses,including medical treatment costs, overhead costs, and education costs, Medicare's reimbursement system furthers thisobjective. This scheme is structured to ensure that providers possess the capacity to render, on an ongoing basis, medical care to the program's qualifying patients. The structure, moreover, proves untenable petitioner's assertion thatCongress has no interest in the financial stability of pro529US3 Unit: $U55 [09-26-01 13:01:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN681Cite as: 529 U. S. 667 (2000)Opinion of the Courtviders once services are rendered to patients. Paymentsare made in a manner calculated to maintain providerstability. $ 413.5(b); Good Samaritan Hospital, 508 U. S.,at 406. Incentives are given for long-term improvements,such as capital costs and education. $$ 413.85, 413.134(e),413.153(b)(2)(iii). Subsidies, defined as "special treatment,"are awarded to certain providers. Id., pt. 412G. In short,provider organizations play a vital role and maintain a highlevel of responsibility in carrying out the program's purposes. Medicare funds, in turn, provide benefits extendingbeyond isolated, point-of-sale treatment transactions. Thefunds health care organizations receive for participating inthe Medicare program constitute "benefits" within the meaning of 18 U. S. C. $ 666(b).Our discussion should not be taken to suggest that federalfunds disbursed under an assistance program will result incoverage of all recipient fraud under $ 666(b). Any receiptof federal funds can, at some level of generality, be characterized as a benefit. The statute does not employ this broad,almost limitless use of the term. Doing so would turn almost every act of fraud or bribery into a federal offense,upsetting the proper federal balance. To determinewhether an organization participating in a federal assistanceprogram receives "benefits," an examination must be undertaken of the program's structure, operation, and purpose.The inquiry should examine the conditions under which theorganization receives the federal payments. The answercould depend, as it does here, on whether the recipient's ownoperations are one of the reasons for maintaining the program. Health care organizations participating in the Medicare program satisfy this standard.The Government has a legitimate and significant interestin prohibiting financial fraud or acts of bribery being perpetrated upon Medicare providers. Fraudulent acts threatenthe program's integrity. They raise the risk participatingorganizations will lack the resources requisite to provide the529US3 Unit: $U55 [09-26-01 13:01:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN682 FISCHER v.

S., at 61 (stating that acceptance of bribes byan official of a jail housing federal prisoners pursuant to anagreement with the Government "was a threat to the integrity and proper operation of the federal program").Other cases may present questions requiring further examination and elaboration of the term "benefits." Here itsuffices to hold that health care providers such as the onedefrauded by petitioner receive benefits within the meaningof the statute. The judgment of the Court of Appeals isaffirmed.
