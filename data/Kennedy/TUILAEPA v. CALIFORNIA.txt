In California, to sentence a defendant to death for firstdegree murder the trier of fact must find the defendantguilty and also find one or more of 19 special circumstanceslisted in Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 190.2 (West 1988 and Supp.1994). The case then proceeds to the penalty phase, wherethe trier of fact must consider a number of specified factorsin deciding whether to sentence the defendant to death.$ 190.3.* These two cases present the question whetherthree of the $ 190.3 penalty-phase factors are unconstitutionally vague under decisions of this Court construing the*Section 190.3 provides in part:"In determining the penalty, the trier of fact shall take into account anyof the following factors if relevant:"(a) The circumstances of the crime of which the defendant was convicted in the present proceeding and the existence of any special circumstances found to be true pursuant to Section 190.1."(b) The presence or absence of criminal activity by the defendantwhich involved the use or attempted use of force or violence or the expressor implied threat to use force or violence."(c) The presence or absence of any prior felony conviction."(d) Whether or not the offense was committed while the defendant wasunder the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance."(e) Whether or not the victim was a participant in the defendant's homicidal conduct or consented to the homicidal act."(f) Whether or not the offense was committed under circumstanceswhich the defendant reasonably believed to be a moral justification orextenuation for his conduct."(g) Whether or not defendant acted under extreme duress or underthe substantial domination of another person."(h) Whether or not at the time of the offense the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was impaired as a result of mental diseaseor defect, or the [e]ffects of intoxication."(i) The age of the defendant at the time of the crime."(j) Whether or not the defendant was an accomplice to the offense andhis participation in the commission of the offense was relatively minor."(k) Any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crimeeven though it is not a legal excuse for the crime."512us3$95l 12-28-97 17:51:10 PAGES OPINPGT970 TUILAEPA v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the CourtCruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the EighthAmendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. IPetitioner Tuilaepa's case arises out of a murder he com-mitted in Long Beach, California, in October 1986. Tuilaepaand an accomplice walked into the Wander Inn Bar in LongBeach, where a small crowd had gathered to watch MondayNight Football. Tuilaepa, who was carrying a .22-caliberrifle, approached the bartender, pointed the rifle at him, anddemanded money from the cash register. After the bar-tender turned over the money, Tuilaepa and his accomplicebegan robbing the bar's patrons. When the accomplice de-manded money from a man named Melvin Whiddon, Whiddon refused and knocked the accomplice to the floor. Tui-laepa shot Whiddon in the neck and next shot Whiddon'sbrother, Kelvin, who was standing nearby. Tuilaepa turnedto another man, Bruce Monroe, and shot him in the stomach.As Tuilaepa and his accomplice ran toward the back door,they confronted Kenneth Boone. Tuilaepa shot Boone in theneck. Melvin Whiddon died at the scene from the gunshotwounds; the others suffered serious and in some cases permanent injuries.The State sought the death penalty against Tuilaepa,charging him with the murder of Melvin Whiddon and onespecial circumstance under $ 190.2: murder during the commission of a robbery. The jury found Tuilaepa guilty offirst-degree murder and also found the special circumstancetrue. At the penalty phase, the trial judge instructed thejury to consider the relevant sentencing factors specified in$ 190.3. The jury was unanimous in sentencing Tuilaepa todeath.Petitioner Proctor murdered Bonnie Stendal, a 55-year-oldschoolteacher who lived in Burney, a small community inShasta County, California. On a night in April 1982, Proctorentered Mrs. Stendal's home and beat her, causing numerous512us3$95l 12-28-97 17:51:10 PAGES OPINPGT971Cite as: 512 U. S. 967 (1994)Opinion of the Courtcuts and bruises on her face. Proctor stabbed Mrs. Stendalin the neck several times and inflicted seven stab wounds inthe area of the right breast. Proctor raped Mrs. Stendaland committed further sexual assaults with a foreign object.After beating, torturing, and raping Mrs. Stendal, Proctorstrangled her to death and dumped her body on the side ofthe road near Lake Britton, 12 miles from Burney. Thebody was found late the next afternoon, clad in a nightgownwith hands tied behind the back.The State sought the death penalty against Proctor, charging him with murder and a number of special circumstancesunder $ 190.2 including murder during the commission of arape, murder during the commission of a burglary, and in-fliction of torture during a murder. The jury found Proctorguilty of murder and found the three special circumstancestrue. After a mistrial at the penalty phase, Proctor's motion for change of venue was granted, and a new sentencingjury was empaneled in Sacramento County. The trial judgeinstructed the jury to consider the sentencing factors speci-fied in $ 190.3. The jury was unanimous in sentencing Proctor to death.Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court of California,which affirmed their convictions and death sentences.No. 93-5131, 4 Cal. 4th 569, 842 P. 2d 1142 (1992), andNo. 93-5161, 4 Cal. 4th 499, 842 P. 2d 1100 (1992). Wegranted certiorari, 510 U. S. 1010 (1993), and now affirm.IIAOur capital punishment cases under the Eighth Amend-ment address two different aspects of the capital decisionmaking process: the eligibility decision and the selection de-cision. To be eligible for the death penalty, the defendantmust be convicted of a crime for which the death penalty isa proportionate punishment.Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584(1977). To render a defendant eligible for the death penalty512us3$95l 12-28-97 17:51:10 PAGES OPINPGT972 TUILAEPA v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtin a homicide case, we have indicated that the trier of factmust convict the defendant of murder and find one "aggravating circumstance" (or its equivalent) at either the guilt orpenalty phase. See, e. g., Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U. S.231, 244-246 (1988); Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 878(1983). The aggravating circumstance may be contained inthe definition of the crime or in a separate sentencing factor(or in both). Lowenfield, supra, at 244-246. As we haveexplained, the aggravating circumstance must meet two requirements. First, the circumstance may not apply to everydefendant convicted of a murder; it must apply only to a subclass of defendants convicted of murder. See Arave v.Creech, 507 U. S. 463, 474 (1993) ("If the sentencer fairlycould conclude that an aggravating circumstance applies toevery defendant eligible for the death penalty, the circumstance is constitutionally infirm"). Second, the aggravatingcircumstance may not be unconstitutionally vague. Godfreyv. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420, 428 (1980); see Arave, supra, at 471(court " `must first determine whether the statutory language defining the circumstance is itself too vague to provideany guidance to the sentencer' ") (quoting Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 654 (1990)).We have imposed a separate requirement for the selectiondecision, where the sentencer determines whether a defendant eligible for the death penalty should in fact receive thatsentence. "What is important at the selection stage is anindividualized determination on the basis of the characterof the individual and the circumstances of the crime." Zant,supra, at 879; see also Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S.280, 303-304 (1976) (plurality opinion). That requirement ismet when the jury can consider relevant mitigating evidenceof the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of the crime. Blystone v. Pennsylvania, 494 U. S.299, 307 (1990) ("requirement of individualized sentencing incapital cases is satisfied by allowing the jury to consider all512us3$95l 12-28-97 17:51:10 PAGES OPINPGT973Cite as: 512 U. S. 967 (1994)Opinion of the Courtrelevant mitigating evidence"); see Johnson v. Texas, 509U. S. 350, 361 (1993).The eligibility decision fits the crime within a defined clas-sification. Eligibility factors almost of necessity require ananswer to a question with a factual nexus to the crime orthe defendant so as to "make rationally reviewable the proc-ess for imposing a sentence of death."Arave, supra, at 471(internal quotation marks omitted). The selection decision,on the other hand, requires individualized sentencing andmust be expansive enough to accommodate relevant mitigat-ing evidence so as to assure an assessment of the defendant'sculpability. The objectives of these two inquiries can be insome tension, at least when the inquiries occur at the sametime. See Romano v. Oklahoma, ante, at 6 (referring to"two somewhat contradictory tasks"). There is one principle common to both decisions, however: The State must ensure that the process is neutral and principled so as to guardagainst bias or caprice in the sentencing decision. SeeGregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 189 (1976) ( joint opinion ofStewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.) (procedures must "minimize the risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action").That is the controlling objective when we examine eligibility and selection factors for vagueness. Indeed, it is thereason that eligibility and selection factors (at least in somesentencing schemes) may not be "too vague." Walton,supra, at 654; see Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356,361-364 (1988).Because "the proper degree of definition" of eligibility andselection factors often "is not susceptible of mathematicalprecision," our vagueness review is quite deferential. Walton, supra, at 655; see Gregg, supra, at 193-194 (factors "areby necessity somewhat general"). Relying on the basicprinciple that a factor is not unconstitutional if it has some"common-sense core of meaning . . . that criminal juriesshould be capable of understanding," Jurek v. Texas, 428U. S. 262, 279 (1976) (White, J., concurring in judgment), we512us3$95l 12-28-97 17:51:10 PAGES OPINPGT974 TUILAEPA v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courthave found only a few factors vague, and those in factare quite similar to one another. SeeMaynard, supra, at363-364 (question whether murder was "especially heinous,atrocious, or cruel");Godfrey, supra, at 427-429 (questionwhether murder was "outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman"); cf. Arave, 507 U. S., at 472 ("We are notfaced with pejorative adjectives . . . that describe a crime asa whole"). In providing for individualized sentencing, itmust be recognized that the States may adopt capital sentencing processes that rely upon the jury, in its sound judg-ment, to exercise wide discretion. That is evident from thenumerous factors we have upheld against vagueness challenges. See, e. g., id., at 472-473 (question whether the defendant was a "cold-blooded, pitiless slayer" is not unconstitutionally vague); Walton, supra, at 654 (question whether"perpetrator inflict[ed] mental anguish or physical abuse before the victim's death" with "[m]ental anguish includ[ing] avictim's uncertainty as to his ultimate fate" is not unconstitutionally vague) (internal quotation marks omitted); Proffittv. Florida, 428 U. S. 242, 255-258 (1976) ( joint opinion ofStewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.) (various "mitigating"questions not unconstitutionally vague, nor is the questionwhether the crime was a "conscienceless or pitiless crimewhich [wa]s unnecessarily torturous to the victim") (internalquotation marks omitted); Jurek, supra, at 274-276 (question"whether there is a probability that the defendant wouldcommit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society" is not unconstitutionally vague).In our decisions holding a death sentence unconstitutionalbecause of a vague sentencing factor, the State had presented a specific proposition that the sentencer had to findtrue or false (e. g., whether the crime was especially heinous,atrocious, or cruel). We have held, under certain sentencingschemes, that a vague propositional factor used in the sentencing decision creates an unacceptable risk of randomness,the mark of the arbitrary and capricious sentencing process512US3 Unit: $U95 [01-06-00 06:39:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN975Cite as: 512 U. S. 967 (1994)Opinion of the Courtprohibited by Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238 (1972). SeeStringer v. Black, 503 U. S. 222 (1992). Those concerns aremitigated when a factor does not require a yes or a noanswer to a specific question, but instead only points thesentencer to a subject matter. See Cal. Penal Code Ann.$$ 190.3(a), (k) (West 1988). Both types of factors (and thedistinction between the two is not always clear) have theirutility. For purposes of vagueness analysis, however, in examining the propositional content of a factor, our concern isthat the factor have some "common-sense core of meaning. . . that criminal juries should be capable of understanding."Jurek, supra, at 279 (White, J., concurring in judgment).BWith those principles in mind, we consider petitioners'vagueness challenge to the California scheme. A defendantin California is eligible for the death penalty when the juryfinds him guilty of first-degree murder and finds one ofthe $ 190.2 special circumstances true. See California v.Ramos, 463 U. S. 992, 1008 (1983) ( jury found that "the defendant [fell] within the legislatively defined category of per-sons eligible for the death penalty [by] determining the truthof the alleged special circumstance," commission of murderduring the course of a robbery). (Petitioners do not arguethat the special circumstances found in their cases wereinsufficient, so we do not address that part of California'sscheme save to describe its relation to the selection phase.)At the penalty phase, the jury is instructed to consider numerous other factors listed in $ 190.3 in deciding whether toimpose the death penalty on a particular defendant. Petitioners contend that three of those $ 190.3 sentencing factors areunconstitutional and that, as a consequence, it was error toinstruct their juries to consider them. Both Proctor and Tu-ilaepa challenge factor (a), which requires the sentencer toconsider the "circumstances of the crime of which the defend-ant was convicted in the present proceeding and the exist512US3 Unit: $U95 [01-06-00 06:39:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN976 TUILAEPA v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtence of any special circumstances found to be true." Tui-laepa challenges two other factors as well: factor (b), whichrequires the sentencer to consider "[t]he presence or absenceof criminal activity by the defendant which involved the useor attempted use of force or violence or the express orimplied threat to use force or violence"; and factor (i),which requires the sentencer to consider "[t]he age of thedefendant at the time of the crime." We conclude thatnone of the three factors is defined in terms that violatethe Constitution.Petitioners' challenge to factor (a) is at some odds withsettled principles, for our capital jurisprudence has established that the sentencer should consider the circumstancesof the crime in deciding whether to impose the death penalty.See, e. g., Woodson, 428 U. S., at 304 ("[C]onsideration of . . .the circumstances of the particular offense [is] a constitutionally indispensable part of the process of inflicting the penaltyof death"). We would be hard pressed to invalidate a juryinstruction that implements what we have said the law requires. In any event, this California factor instructs thejury to consider a relevant subject matter and does so inunderstandable terms. The circumstances of the crime area traditional subject for consideration by the sentencer, andan instruction to consider the circumstances is neither vaguenor otherwise improper under our Eighth Amendmentjurisprudence.Tuilaepa also challenges factor (b), which requires the sentencer to consider the defendant's prior criminal activity.The objection fails for many of the same reasons. Factor (b)is phrased in conventional and understandable terms andrests in large part on a determination whether certainevents occurred, thus asking the jury to consider matters ofhistorical fact. Under other sentencing schemes, in Texasfor example, jurors may be asked to make a predictive judgment, such as "whether there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would512us3$95l 12-28-97 17:51:10 PAGES OPINPGT977Cite as: 512 U. S. 967 (1994)Opinion of the Courtconstitute a continuing threat to society." See Jurek, 428U. S., at 269. Both a backward-looking and a forwardlooking inquiry are a permissible part of the sentencing proc-ess, however, and the States have considerable latitude indetermining how to guide the sentencer's decision in thisrespect. Here, factor (b) is not vague.Tuilaepa's third challenge is to factor (i), which requiresthe sentencer to consider "[t]he age of the defendant at thetime of the crime." This again is an unusual challenge inlight of our precedents. SeeEddings v. Oklahoma, 455U. S. 104, 115-117 (1982) (age may be relevant factor in sentencing decision). The factual inquiry is of the most rudi-mentary sort, and there is no suggestion that the term "age"is vague. Petitioner contends, however, that the age factoris equivocal and that in the typical case the prosecution argues in favor of the death penalty based on the defendant'sage, no matter how old or young he was at the time of thecrime. It is neither surprising nor remarkable that the rele-vance of the defendant's age can pose a dilemma for the sentencer. But difficulty in application is not equivalent tovagueness. Both the prosecution and the defense may present valid arguments as to the significance of the defendant'sage in a particular case. Competing arguments by adversary parties bring perspective to a problem, and thus serveto promote a more reasoned decision, providing guidance asto a factor jurors most likely would discuss in any event.We find no constitutional deficiency in factor (i).CPetitioners could not and do not take great issue with theconclusion that factors (a), (b), and (i) provide common andunderstandable terms to the sentencer. Cf. Godfrey, 446U. S., at 429 ("jury's interpretation of [outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman factor] can only be the sub-ject of sheer speculation"). Petitioners argue, however, thatselection factors must meet the requirements for eligibility512us3$95l 12-28-97 17:51:10 PAGES OPINPGT978 TUILAEPA v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtfactors, Brief for Petitioner in No. 93-5161, pp. 10-25, andtherefore must require an answer to a factual question, aseligibility factors do. According to petitioners, a capitaljury may not be instructed simply to consider an open-endedsubject matter, such as "the circumstances of the crime" or"the background of the defendant." Apart from the factthat petitioners' argument ignores the obvious utility ofthese open-ended factors as part of a neutral sentencingprocess, it contravenes our precedents. Our decisions inZant and Gregg reveal that, at the selection stage, the Statesare not confined to submitting to the jury specific propositional questions. In Zant, we found no constitutional difficulty where the jury had been told to consider " `all factsand circumstances presented in extenuation, mitigation, andaggravation of punishment as well as such arguments ashave been presented for the State and for the Defense.' "462 U. S., at 878-880, 889, n. 25. We also stated that "[n]othing in the United States Constitution prohibits a trial judgefrom instructing a jury that it would be appropriate to takeaccount of a defendant's prior criminal record in making itssentencing determination." Id., at 888. And in Gregg, werejected a vagueness challenge to that same Georgia sentencing scheme in a case in which the "judge . . . charged thejury that in determining what sentence was appropriate thejury was free to consider the facts and circumstances, if any,presented by the parties in mitigation or aggravation." 428U. S., at 161, 203-204. In both cases, therefore, the Courtfound no constitutional problem with a death sentence wherethe jury instructions directed consideration of the "facts andcircumstances" of the case. In these cases as well, we mustreject petitioners' suggestion that the Constitution prohibitssentencing instructions that require the trier of fact to consider a relevant subject matter such as the "circumstancesof the crime."Petitioners also suggest that the $ 190.3 sentencing factorsare flawed because they do not instruct the sentencer how to512us3$95l 12-28-97 17:51:10 PAGES OPINPGT979Cite as: 512 U. S. 967 (1994)Opinion of the Courtweigh any of the facts it finds in deciding upon the ultimatesentence. In this regard, petitioners claim that a single listof factors is unconstitutional because it does not guide thejury in evaluating and weighing the evidence and allows theprosecution (as well as the defense) to make wide-rangingarguments about whether the defendant deserves the deathpenalty. This argument, too, is foreclosed by our cases. Acapital sentencer need not be instructed how to weigh anyparticular fact in the capital sentencing decision. InCalifornia v. Ramos, for example, we upheld an instruction in-forming the jury that the Governor had the power to commute life sentences and stated that "the fact that the jury isgiven no specific guidance on how the commutation factoris to figure into its determination presents no constitutionalproblem." 463 U. S., at 1008-1009, n. 22. Likewise, inProffitt v. Florida, we upheld the Florida capital sentencingscheme even though "the various factors to be considered bythe sentencing authorities [did] not have numerical weightsassigned to them." 428 U. S., at 258. In Gregg, moreover,we "approved Georgia's capital sentencing statute eventhough it clearly did not channel the jury's discretion byenunciating specific standards to guide the jury's consideration of aggravating and mitigating circumstances." Zant,462 U. S., at 875. We also rejected an objection "to the widescope of evidence and argument" allowed at sentencing hearings. 428 U. S., at 203-204. In sum, "discretion to evaluateand weigh the circumstances relevant to the particular defendant and the crime he committed" is not impermissible inthe capital sentencing process. McCleskey v. Kemp, 481U. S. 279, 315, n. 37 (1987). "Once the jury finds that thedefendant falls within the legislatively defined category ofpersons eligible for the death penalty, . . . the jury then isfree to consider a myriad of factors to determine whetherdeath is the appropriate punishment." Ramos, supra, at1008. Indeed, the sentencer may be given "unbridled discretion in determining whether the death penalty should be512us3$95l 12-28-97 17:51:10 PAGES OPINPGT980 TUILAEPA v. CALIFORNIASouter, J., concurringimposed after it has found that the defendant is a memberof the class made eligible for that penalty."Zant, supra, at875; see also Barclay v. Florida, 463 U. S. 939, 948-951 (1983)(plurality opinion). In contravention of those cases, petitioners' argument would force the States to adopt a kind ofmandatory sentencing scheme requiring a jury to sentence adefendant to death if it found, for example, a certain kind ornumber of facts, or found more statutory aggravating factorsthan statutory mitigating factors. The States are not required to conduct the capital sentencing process in that fash-ion. SeeGregg, supra, at 199-200, n. 50.The instructions to the juries in petitioners' cases direct-ing consideration of factor (a), factor (b), and factor (i) didnot violate the Constitution. The judgments of the Supreme Court of California are
