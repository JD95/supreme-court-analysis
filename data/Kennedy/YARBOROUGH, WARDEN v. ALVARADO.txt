Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Actof 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, a federal court can grantan application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a per-son held pursuant to a state-court judgment if the statecourt adjudication "resulted in a decision that was contraryto, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court ofthe United States." 28 U.

Soto and Alvarado were part of alarger group of teenagers at the mall that night. Soto decided to steal the truck, and Alvarado agreed to help. Sotopulled out a .357 Magnum and approached the driver, Francisco Castaneda, who was standing near the truck emptyingtrash into a dumpster. Soto demanded money and the ignition keys from Castaneda. Alvarado, then five months shortof his 18th birthday, approached the passenger side door ofthe truck and crouched down. When Castaneda refused tocomply with Soto's demands, Soto shot Castaneda, killinghim. Alvarado then helped hide Soto's gun.Los Angeles County Sheriff 's detective Cheryl Comstockled the investigation into the circumstances of Castaneda'sdeath. About a month after the shooting, Comstock leftword at Alvarado's house and also contacted Alvarado'smother at work with the message that she wished to speakwith Alvarado. Alvarado's parents brought him to the PicoRivera Sheriff 's Station to be interviewed around lunchtime.They waited in the lobby while Alvarado went with Comstock to be interviewed. Alvarado contends that his parentsasked to be present during the interview but were rebuffed.Comstock brought Alvarado to a small interview room andbegan interviewing him at about 12:30 p.m. The interviewlasted about two hours, and was recorded by Comstock withAlvarado's knowledge. Only Comstock and Alvarado werepresent. Alvarado was not given a warning under Mirandav. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). Comstock began the interview by asking Alvarado to recount the events on the nightof the shooting. On that night, Alvarado explained, he hadbeen drinking alcohol at a friend's house with some otherfriends and acquaintances. After a few hours, part of thegroup went home and the rest walked to a nearby mall touse its public telephones. In Alvarado's initial telling, thatwas the end of it. The group went back to the friend's homeand "just went to bed." App. 101.Unpersuaded, Comstock pressed on:541US2 Unit: $U53 [05-20-06 18:30:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN657Cite as: 541 U. S. 652 (2004)Opinion of the Court"Q. Okay. We did real good up until this point and everything you've said it's pretty accurate till this point,except for you left out the shooting."A. The shooting?"Q. Uh huh, the shooting."A. Well I had never seen no shooting."Q. Well I'm afraid you did."A. I had never seen no shooting."Q. Well I beg to differ with you. I've been told quitethe opposite and we have witnesses that are sayingquite the opposite."A. That I had seen the shooting?"Q. So why don't you take a deep breath, like I told youbefore, the very best thing is to be honest. . . . You can'thave that many people get involved in a murder andexpect that some of them aren't going to tell the truth,okay? Now granted if it was maybe one person, youmight be able to keep your fingers crossed and say, godI hope he doesn't tell the truth, but the problem is isthat they have to tell the truth, okay? Now all I'm simply doing is giving you the opportunity to tell the truthand when we got that many people telling a story andall of a sudden you tell something way far fetched different." Id., at 101-102 (punctuation added).At this point, Alvarado slowly began to change his story.First he acknowledged being present when the carjackingoccurred but claimed that he did not know what happened orwho had a gun. When he hesitated to say more, Comstocktried to encourage Alvarado to discuss what happened byappealing to his sense of honesty and the need to bring theman who shot Castaneda to justice. See, e. g., id., at 106("[W]hat I'm looking for is to see if you'll tell the truth"); id.,at 105-106 ("I know it's very difficult when it comes time to`drop the dime' on somebody[,] . . .

ALVARADOOpinion of the Courtyour parent, your mother, or your brother, or your sister,you would darn well want [the killer] to go to jail 'cause noone has the right to take someone's life like that . . ."). Al-varado then admitted he had helped the other man try tosteal the truck by standing near the passenger side door.Next he admitted that the other man was Paul Soto, that heknew Soto was armed, and that he had helped hide the gunafter the murder. Alvarado explained that he had expectedSoto to scare the driver with the gun, but that he did notexpect Soto to kill anyone. Id., at 127. Toward the end ofthe interview, Comstock twice asked Alvarado if he neededto take a break. Alvarado declined. When the interviewwas over, Comstock returned with Alvarado to the lobby ofthe sheriff 's station where his parents were waiting. Alva-rado's father drove him home.A few months later, the State of California charged Sotoand Alvarado with first-degree murder and attempted robbery. Citing Miranda, supra, Alvarado moved to suppresshis statements from the Comstock interview. The trialcourt denied the motion on the ground that the interviewwas noncustodial. App. 196. Alvarado and Soto were triedtogether, and Alvarado testified in his own defense. He offered an innocent explanation for his conduct, testifying thathe happened to be standing in the parking lot of the mallwhen a gun went off nearby. The government's crossexamination relied on Alvarado's statement to Comstock.Alvarado admitted having made some of the statements butdenied others. When Alvarado denied particular statements, the prosecution countered by playing excerpts fromthe audio recording of the interview.During cross-examination, Alvarado agreed that the interview with Comstock "was a pretty friendly conversation,"id., at 438, that there was "sort of a free flow between[Alvarado] and Detective Comstock," id., at 439, and that Alvarado did not "feel coerced or threatened in any way" during the interview, ibid. The jury convicted Soto and Alvarado of first-degree murder and attempted robbery. The541US2 Unit: $U53 [05-20-06 18:30:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN659Cite as: 541 U. S. 652 (2004)Opinion of the Courttrial judge later reduced Alvarado's conviction to second-degree murder for his comparatively minor role in the offense. The judge sentenced Soto to life in prison and Alva-rado to 15-years-to-life.On direct appeal, the Second Appellate District Court ofAppeal (hereinafter state court) affirmed.People v. Soto,74 Cal. App. 4th 1099, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 688 (1999) (unpublished in relevant part). The state court rejected Alvarado'scontention that his statements to Comstock should have beenexcluded at trial because no Miranda warnings were given.The court ruled Alvarado had not been in custody duringthe interview, so no warning was required. The state courtrelied upon the custody test articulated inThompson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 99, 112 (1995), which requires a court to con-sider the circumstances surrounding the interrogation andthen determine whether a reasonable person would have feltat liberty to leave. The state court reviewed the facts ofthe Comstock interview and concluded Alvarado was not incustody. App. to Pet. for Cert. C-17. The court emphasized the absence of any intense or aggressive tactics andnoted that Comstock had not told Alvarado that he could notleave. The California Supreme Court denied discretionaryreview.Alvarado filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus inthe United States District Court for the Central District ofCalifornia. The District Court agreed with the state courtthat Alvarado was not in custody for Miranda purposes during the interview. Alvarado v. Hickman, No. ED CV-00-326-VAP(E) (2000), App. to Pet. for Cert. B-1 to B-10. "Ata minimum," the District Court added, the deferential standard of review provided by 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d) foreclosed relief. App. to Pet. for Cert. B-7.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. Alvarado v. Hickman, 316 F. 3d 841 (2002). First, the Courtof Appeals held that the state court erred in failing to account for Alvarado's youth and inexperience when evaluatingwhether a reasonable person in his position would have felt541US2 Unit: $U53 [05-20-06 18:30:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN660 YARBOROUGH v. ALVARADOOpinion of the Courtfree to leave. It noted that this Court has considered a sus-pect's juvenile status when evaluating the voluntariness ofconfessions and the waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination. See id., at 843 (citing, inter alia, Haley v.Ohio, 332 U. S. 596, 599-601 (1948), and In re Gault, 387 U. S.1, 45 (1967)). The Court of Appeals held that in light ofthese authorities, Alvarado's age and experience must be afactor in theMiranda custody inquiry. 316 F. 3d, at 843.A minor with no criminal record would be more likely to feelcoerced by police tactics and conclude he is under arrest thanwould an experienced adult, the Court of Appeals reasoned.This required extra "safeguards . . . commensurate with theage and circumstances of a juvenile defendant." See id., at850. According to the Court of Appeals, the effect of Alva-rado's age and inexperience was so substantial that it turnedthe interview into a custodial interrogation.The Court of Appeals next considered whether Alvaradocould obtain relief in light of the deference a federal courtmust give to a state-court determination on habeas review.The deference required by AEDPA did not bar relief, theCourt of Appeals held, because the relevance of juvenile status in Supreme Court case law as a whole compelled the"extension of the principle that juvenile status is relevant"to the context of Miranda custody determinations. 316F. 3d, at 853. In light of the clearly established law considering juvenile status, it was "simply unreasonable to con-clude that a reasonable 17-year-old, with no prior history ofarrest or police interviews, would have felt that he was atliberty to terminate the interrogation and leave."Id., at854-855 (internal quotation marks omitted).We granted certiorari. 539 U. S. 986 (2003).IIWe begin by determining the relevant clearly establishedlaw. For purposes of 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1), clearly established law as determined by this Court "refers to the hold-ings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Court's decisions as of541US2 Unit: $U53 [05-20-06 18:30:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN661Cite as: 541 U. S. 652 (2004)Opinion of the Courtthe time of the relevant state-court decision." Williams v.Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 412 (2000). We look for "the governing legal principle or principles set forth by the SupremeCourt at the time the state court renders its decision."Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 71-72 (2003).Miranda itself held that preinterrogation warnings are required in the context of custodial interrogations given "thecompulsion inherent in custodial surroundings." 384 U. S.,at 458. The Court explained that "custodial interrogation"meant "questioning initiated by law enforcement officersafter a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way." Id.,at 444. TheMiranda decision did not provide the Courtwith an opportunity to apply that test to a set of facts.AfterMiranda, the Court first applied the custody test inOregon v. Mathiason, 429 U. S. 492 (1977) (per curiam). InMathiason, a police officer contacted the suspect after a burglary victim identified him. The officer arranged to meetthe suspect at a nearby police station. At the outset of thequestioning, the officer stated his belief that the suspect wasinvolved in the burglary but that he was not under arrest.During the 30-minute interview, the suspect admitted hisguilt. He was then allowed to leave. The Court held thatthe questioning was not custodial because there was "no indication that the questioning took place in a context where [thesuspect's] freedom to depart was restricted in any way."Id., at 495. The Court noted that the suspect had come voluntarily to the police station, that he was informed that hewas not under arrest, and that he was allowed to leave atthe end of the interview. Ibid.In California v. Beheler, 463 U. S. 1121 (1983) (per curiam), the Court reached the same result in a case with factssimilar to those in Mathiason. In Beheler, the state courthad distinguished Mathiason based on what it described asdifferences in the totality of the circumstances. The policeinterviewed Beheler shortly after the crime occurred; Beheler had been drinking earlier in the day; he was emotion541US2 Unit: $U53 [05-20-06 18:30:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN662 YARBOROUGH v. ALVARADOOpinion of the Courtally distraught; he was well known to the police; and he wasa parolee who knew it was necessary for him to cooperatewith the police. 463 U. S., at 1124-1125. The Court agreedthat "the circumstances of each case must certainly influence" the custody determination, but reemphasized that "theultimate inquiry is simply whether there is a formal arrestor restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest." Id., at 1125 (internal quotationmarks omitted). The Court found the case indistinguishablefrom Mathiason. It noted that how much the police knewabout the suspect and how much time had elapsed after thecrime occurred were irrelevant to the custody inquiry. 463U. S., at 1125.Our more recent cases instruct that custody must be determined based on how a reasonable person in the suspect'ssituation would perceive his circumstances. In Berkemer v.McCarty, 468 U. S. 420 (1984), a police officer stopped a suspected drunk driver and asked him some questions. Although the officer reached the decision to arrest the driverat the beginning of the traffic stop, he did not do so until thedriver failed a sobriety test and acknowledged that he hadbeen drinking beer and smoking marijuana. The Court heldthe traffic stop noncustodial despite the officer's intent toarrest because he had not communicated that intent to thedriver. "A policeman's unarticulated plan has no bearing onthe question whether a suspect was `in custody' at a particular time," the Court explained. Id., at 442. "[T]he only relevant inquiry is how a reasonable man in the suspect's position would have understood his situation." Ibid. In afootnote, the Court cited a New York state case for the viewthat an objective test was preferable to a subjective test inpart because it does not " `place upon the police the burdenof anticipating the frailties or idiosyncrasies of every personwhom they question.' " Id., at 442, n. 35 (quoting People v.P., 21 N. Y. 2d 1, 9-10, 233 N. E. 2d 255, 260 (1967)).541US2 Unit: $U53 [05-20-06 18:30:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN663Cite as: 541 U. S. 652 (2004)Opinion of the CourtStansbury v. California, 511 U. S. 318 (1994) (per curiam), confirmed this analytical framework. Stansbury explained that "the initial determination of custody depends onthe objective circumstances of the interrogation, not on thesubjective views harbored by either the interrogating offi-cers or the person being questioned."Id., at 323. Courtsmust examine "all of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation" and determine "how a reasonable person in theposition of the individual being questioned would gauge thebreadth of his or her freedom of action." Id., at 322, 325(internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).Finally, in Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 99 (1995), theCourt offered the following description of theMiranda custody test:"Two discrete inquiries are essential to the determination: first, what were the circumstances surrounding theinterrogation; and second, given those circumstances,would a reasonable person have felt he or she was notat liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.Once the scene is set and the players' lines and actionsare reconstructed, the court must apply an objective testto resolve the ultimate inquiry: was there a formal ar-rest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degreeassociated with a formal arrest." 516 U. S., at 112 (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted).We turn now to the case before us and ask if the state-court adjudication of the claim "involved an unreasonableapplication" of clearly established law when it concluded thatAlvarado was not in custody. 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1). SeeWilliams, 529 U. S., at 413 ("Under the `unreasonable application' clause, a federal habeas court may grant the writ ifthe state court identifies the correct governing principlefrom this Court's decisions but unreasonably applies thatprinciple to the facts of the prisoner's case"). The term" `unreasonable' " is "a common term in the legal world and,541US2 Unit: $U53 [05-20-06 18:30:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN664 YARBOROUGH v. ALVARADOOpinion of the Courtaccordingly, federal judges are familiar with its meaning."Id., at 410. At the same time, the range of reasonable judgment can depend in part on the nature of the relevant rule.If a legal rule is specific, the range may be narrow. Applications of the rule may be plainly correct or incorrect. Otherrules are more general, and their meaning must emerge inapplication over the course of time. Applying a generalstandard to a specific case can demand a substantial elementof judgment. As a result, evaluating whether a rule application was unreasonable requires considering the rule'sspecificity. The more general the rule, the more leewaycourts have in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations. Cf. Wright v. West, 505 U. S. 277, 308-309 (1992)(Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).Based on these principles, we conclude that the statecourt's application of our clearly established law was reasonable. Ignoring the deferential standard of $ 2254(d)(1)for the moment, it can be said that fairminded jurists coulddisagree over whether Alvarado was in custody. On onehand, certain facts weigh against a finding that Alvarado wasin custody. The police did not transport Alvarado to thestation or require him to appear at a particular time.Cf. Mathiason, 429 U. S., at 495. They did not threaten himor suggest he would be placed under arrest. Ibid. Alvarado's parents remained in the lobby during the interview, suggesting that the interview would be brief. See Berkemer,supra, at 441-442. In fact, according to trial counsel for Alvarado, he and his parents were told that the interview was" `not going to be long.' " App. 186. During the interview,Comstock focused on Soto's crimes rather than Alvarado's.Instead of pressuring Alvarado with the threat of arrest andprosecution, she appealed to his interest in telling the truthand being helpful to a police officer. Cf. Mathiason, supra,at 495. In addition, Comstock twice asked Alvarado ifhe wanted to take a break. At the end of the interview,Alvarado went home. App. 186. All of these objective541US2 Unit: $U53 [05-20-06 18:30:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN665Cite as: 541 U. S. 652 (2004)Opinion of the Courtfacts are consistent with an interrogation environment inwhich a reasonable person would have felt free to terminatethe interview and leave. Indeed, a number of the facts echothose ofMathiason, a per curiam summary reversal inwhich we found it "clear from these facts" that the suspectwas not in custody. 494 U. S., at 495.Other facts point in the opposite direction. Comstock interviewed Alvarado at the police station. The interviewlasted two hours, four times longer than the 30-minuteinterview in Mathiason. Unlike the officer in Mathiason,Comstock did not tell Alvarado that he was free to leave.Alvarado was brought to the police station by his legalguardians rather than arriving on his own accord, makingthe extent of his control over his presence unclear. Counselfor Alvarado alleges that Alvarado's parents asked to bepresent at the interview but were rebuffed, a fact that--ifknown to Alvarado--might reasonably have led someone inAlvarado's position to feel more restricted than otherwise.These facts weigh in favor of the view that Alvarado wasin custody.These differing indications lead us to hold that the statecourt's application of our custody standard was reasonable.The Court of Appeals was nowhere close to the mark whenit concluded otherwise. Although the question of what an"unreasonable application" of law might be is difficult insome cases, it is not difficult here. The custody test is general, and the state court's application of our law fits withinthe matrix of our prior decisions. We cannot grant reliefunder AEDPA by conducting our own independent inquiryinto whether the state court was correct as a de novo matter."[A] federal habeas court may not issue the writ simplybecause that court concludes in its independent judgmentthat the state-court decision applied [the law] incorrectly."Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 24-25 (2002) (per curiam). Relief is available under $ 2254(d)(1) only if the statecourt's decision is objectively unreasonable. See Williams,541US2 Unit: $U53 [05-20-06 18:30:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN666 YARBOROUGH v. ALVARADOOpinion of the Court529 U. S., at 410; Andrade, 538 U. S., at 75. Under thatstandard, relief cannot be granted.IIIThe Court of Appeals reached the opposite result by plac-ing considerable reliance on Alvarado's age and inexperiencewith law enforcement. Our Court has not stated that a sus-pect's age or experience is relevant to the Miranda custodyanalysis, and counsel for Alvarado did not press the impor-tance of either factor on direct appeal or in habeas proceedings. According to the Court of Appeals, however, ourCourt's emphasis on juvenile status in other contexts demanded consideration of Alvarado's age and inexperiencehere. The Court of Appeals viewed the state court's failureto " `extend a clearly established legal principle [of the rele-vance of juvenile status] to a new context' " as objectivelyunreasonable in this case, requiring issuance of the writ.316 F. 3d, at 853 (quotingAnthony v. Cambra, 236 F. 3d 568,578 (CA9 2000)).The petitioner contends that if a habeas court must extenda rationale before it can apply to the facts at hand then therationale cannot be clearly established at the time of thestate-court decision. Brief for Petitioner 10-24. See alsoHawkins v. Alabama, 318 F. 3d 1302, 1306, n. 3 (CA11 2003)(asserting a similar argument). There is force to this argument. Section 2254(d)(1) would be undermined if habeascourts introduced rules not clearly established under theguise of extensions to existing law. Cf. Teague v. Lane, 489U. S. 288 (1989). At the same time, the difference betweenapplying a rule and extending it is not always clear. Cer-tain principles are fundamental enough that when new factual permutations arise, the necessity to apply the earlierrule will be beyond doubt.This is not such a case, however. Our opinions applyingtheMiranda custody test have not mentioned the suspect'sage, much less mandated its consideration. The only indica541US2 Unit: $U53 [05-20-06 18:30:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN667Cite as: 541 U. S. 652 (2004)Opinion of the Courttions in the Court's opinions relevant to a suspect's experi-ence with law enforcement have rejected reliance on suchfactors. See Beheler, 463 U. S., at 1125 (rejecting a lowercourt's view that the defendant's prior interview with thepolice was relevant to the custody inquiry); Berkemer, 468U. S., at 442, n. 35 (citingPeople v. P., 21 N. Y. 2d, at 9-10,233 N. E. 2d, at 260, which noted the difficulties of a subjective test that would require police to " `anticipat[e] the frail-ties or idiosyncrasies of every person whom they question' ");468 U. S., at 430-432 (describing a suspect's criminal past andpolice record as a circumstance "unknowable to the police").There is an important conceptual difference between theMiranda custody test and the line of cases from other contexts considering age and experience. The Miranda custody inquiry is an objective test. As we stated in Keohane,"[o]nce the scene is set and the players' lines and actionsare reconstructed, the court must apply an objective test toresolve the ultimate inquiry." 516 U. S., at 112 (internalquotation marks omitted). The objective test furthers "theclarity of [Miranda's] rule," Berkemer, 468 U. S., at 430, ensuring that the police do not need "to make guesses as to[the circumstances] at issue before deciding how they mayinterrogate the suspect," id., at 431. To be sure, the linebetween permissible objective facts and impermissible subjective experiences can be indistinct in some cases. It ispossible to subsume a subjective factor into an objective testby making the latter more specific in its formulation. Thusthe Court of Appeals styled its inquiry as an objective testby considering what a "reasonable 17-year-old, with no priorhistory of arrest or police interviews," would perceive. 316F. 3d, at 854-855 (case below).At the same time, the objective Miranda custody inquirycould reasonably be viewed as different from doctrinal teststhat depend on the actual mindset of a particular suspect,where we do consider a suspect's age and experience. Forexample, the voluntariness of a statement is often said to541US2 Unit: $U53 [05-20-06 18:30:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN668 YARBOROUGH v. ALVARADOOpinion of the Courtdepend on whether "the defendant's will was overborne,"Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U. S. 528, 534 (1963), a question thatlogically can depend on "the characteristics of the accused,"Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U. S. 218, 226 (1973). Thecharacteristics of the accused can include the suspect's age,education, and intelligence, seeibid., as well as a suspect'sprior experience with law enforcement, see Lynumn, supra,at 534. In concluding that there was "no principled reason"why such factors should not also apply to theMiranda custody inquiry, 316 F. 3d, at 850, the Court of Appeals ignoredthe argument that the custody inquiry states an objectiverule designed to give clear guidance to the police, while consideration of a suspect's individual characteristics--includinghis age--could be viewed as creating a subjective inquiry.Cf. Mathiason, 429 U. S., at 495-496 (noting that facts arguably relevant to whether an environment is coercive may have"nothing to do with whether respondent was in custody forpurposes of the Miranda rule"). For these reasons, thestate court's failure to consider Alvarado's age does not provide a proper basis for finding that the state court's decisionwas an unreasonable application of clearly established law.Indeed, reliance on Alvarado's prior history with law enforcement was improper not only under the deferentialstandard of 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1), but also as a de novo matter. In most cases, police officers will not know a suspect'sinterrogation history. See Berkemer, supra, at 430-431.Even if they do, the relationship between a suspect's pastexperiences and the likelihood a reasonable person with thatexperience would feel free to leave often will be speculative.True, suspects with prior law enforcement experience mayunderstand police procedures and reasonably feel free toleave unless told otherwise. On the other hand, they mayview past as prologue and expect another in a string of arrests. We do not ask police officers to consider these contingent psychological factors when deciding when suspectsshould be advised of their Miranda rights. See Berkemer,541US2 Unit: $U53 [05-20-06 18:30:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN669Cite as: 541 U. S. 652 (2004)Breyer, J., dissentingsupra, at 431-432. The inquiry turns too much on the sus-pect's subjective state of mind and not enough on the "objective circumstances of the interrogation." Stansbury, 511U. S., at 323.The state court considered the proper factors and reacheda reasonable conclusion. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
