In this case we must decide whether the Federal Employ-ers' Liability Act (FELA), 53 Stat. 1404, 45 U. S. C. $$ 51-60,creates a cause of action against a state-owned railroad, en-forceable in state court. We hold that it does, reaffirmingin part our decision in Parden v. Terminal Railway of Alabama Docks Dept., 377 U. S. 184 (1964).IPetitioner Kenneth Hilton was an employee of the SouthCarolina Public Railways Commission. The commission,which has some 300 employees, is a common carrier engagedin interstate commerce by railroad and is an agency of theState of South Carolina, having been created by statute in1969. Hilton alleges he was injured in the scope and courseof his employment and that the negligence of the commissionwas the cause of the accident. In the case now before usthe commission is the respondent.To recover for his injuries, petitioner first filed a FELAaction in United States District Court. That case was pend-ing when we announced our decision inWelch v. Texas Dept.of Highways and Public Transportation, 483 U. S. 468(1987), which held that the Jones Act, $ 33, 41 Stat. 1007, 46U. S. C. App. $ 688, does not abrogate the States' EleventhAmendment immunity. The Jones Act incorporates the re-medial scheme of FELA; and, based on his understandingthat Eleventh Amendment immunity from Jones Act suitswould apply as well to FELA, petitioner dismissed his*Robert M.

SOUTH CAROLINA PUBLICRAILWAYS COMM'NOpinion of the Courtfederal-court action. He refiled his FELA suit in a SouthCarolina state court, and this is the case now before us.The state trial court dismissed Hilton's complaint on theground that FELA does not authorize an action for moneydamages against an agency of the State, even if suit is maintained in a state forum. Though acknowledging that in Parden v. Terminal Railway of Alabama Docks Dept., supra,we interpreted FELA to permit those actions, the trial courtsaid thatParden "has been severely limited by subsequentdecisions of the Supreme Court." App. to Pet. for Cert. 22.The court held thatParden "is no longer good law," id., at23, and ordered the action dismissed, whereupon Hilton appealed to the South Carolina Supreme Court.While his appeal was pending, the South Carolina Supreme Court decided Freeman v. South Carolina PublicRailways Commission, 302 S. C. 51, 393 S. E. 2d 383 (1990).Addressing the same issue raised by this case, Freeman heldthat FELA does not subject States to liability in state-courtsuits. As did the trial court, the State Supreme Court acknowledged our Parden holding but concluded that in effectit had been overruled by our subsequent course of decisions.In Parden we held that FELA authorizes suits for damages against state-owned railroads, and that by entering thebusiness of operating a railroad a State waives its EleventhAmendment immunity from suit in federal court. The latterholding was overruled in Welch, to accord with our more recent Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence, 483 U. S., at 478;but the Welch Court was explicit in declining to decidewhether in the Jones Act (or in FELA) Congress intendedto create a cause of action against the States. Id., at 476,n. 6 (plurality opinion); see also id., at 495 (White, J., concurring). In other words, the Welch decision did not disturbthe statutory-construction holding of Parden.In addressing the latter issue, the South Carolina courtfound "dispositive" our decision in Will v. Michigan Dept. ofState Police, 491 U. S. 58 (1989). Will was a suit brought in502us1$16L 08-21-96 15:27:13 PAGES OPINPGT201Cite as: 502 U. S. 197 (1991)Opinion of the Courtstate court under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 against Michigan stateofficials. We held that a State is not a "person" as that termis used in $ 1983, and is not suable under the statute, regard-less of the forum where the suit is maintained. In so holding, we relied in part on the lack of any "clear statement" inthe statute of a congressional intent to impose liability onthe State. In its Freeman decision that controlled its rulingin the instant case, the South Carolina court readWill tohold that a statute will not be interpreted to create a cause ofaction for money damages against a State unless it contains"unmistakably clear language" showing that Congress intended to do so. Deciding that the text of FELA does nothave language conforming to this standard, theFreemancourt held that FELA does not subject the States to liability.When petitioner's case reached the South Carolina Su-preme Court, it affirmed dismissal of the action in a onesentence per curiam opinion, citing Freeman. We grantedcertiorari, 498 U. S. 1081 (1991), and now reverse.IIOur analysis and ultimate determination in this case arecontrolled and informed by the central importance ofstaredecisis in this Court's jurisprudence. Respondent asks usto overrule a 28-year-old interpretation, first enunciated inParden, that when Congress enacted FELA and used thephrase "[e]very common carrier by railroad," 45 U. S. C. $ 51,to describe the class of employers subject to its terms, itintended to include state-owned railroads. 377 U. S., at 187-188.1 Just two Terms ago, in Port Authority Trans-HudsonCorp. v. Feeney, 495 U. S. 299 (1990), we assumed the applica-bility of FELA to state-owned railroads in finding that thedefendant, a bistate compact corporation, had waived any1 Section 1 of FELA, 45 U. S. C. $ 51, in pertinent part, provides:"Every common carrier by railroad while engaging in commerce . . .shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce . . . ."502us1$16L 08-21-96 15:27:13 PAGES OPINPGT202 HILTON v. SOUTH CAROLINA PUBLICRAILWAYS COMM'NOpinion of the CourtEleventh Amendment immunity that it may have had. Theissue here is whether we should reexamine this longstandingstatutory construction. Because of the strong considera-tions favoring adherence tostare decisis in these circumstances, the answer to that question must be no. Time andtime again, this Court has recognized that "the doctrine ofstare decisis is of fundamental importance to the rule of law."Welch, supra, at 494; see also Patterson v. McLean CreditUnion, 491 U. S. 164, 172 (1989); Burnet v. Coronado Oil &Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).Adherence to precedent promotes stability, predictability,and respect for judicial authority. Vasquez v. Hillery, 474U. S. 254, 265-266 (1986). For all of these reasons, we willnot depart from the doctrine of stare decisis without somecompelling justification. Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203,212 (1984).In the case before us the policies in favor of following staredecisis far outweigh those suggesting departure. "Considerations of stare decisis have special force in the area of statutory interpretation, for here, unlike in the context of constitutional interpretation, the legislative power is implicated,and Congress remains free to alter what we have done."Patterson, supra, at 172-173. Congress has had almost 30years in which it could have corrected our decision in Pardenif it disagreed with it, and has not chosen to do so. Weshould accord weight to this continued acceptance of our earlier holding. Stare decisis has added force when the legislature, in the public sphere, and citizens, in the private realm,have acted in reliance on a previous decision, for in this instance overruling the decision would dislodge settled rightsand expectations or require an extensive legislative response. This is so in the case before us.Workers' compensation laws in many States specificallyexclude railroad workers from their coverage because of theassumption that FELA provides adequate protection forthose workers. See, e. g., Colo. Rev. Stat. $ 8-41-201 (Supp.502us1$16L 08-21-96 15:27:13 PAGES OPINPGT203Cite as: 502 U. S. 197 (1991)Opinion of the Court1990); D. C. Code Ann. $ 36-301(9)(D) (1981); Ind. Code $ 22-3-79(d) (Supp. 1991); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 23:1037 (West1985); Neb. Rev. Stat. $ 48-106(1) (1988). Counsel for respondent in this case conceded during oral argument thatpetitioner may be precluded from seeking an alternativeremedy under state law for his injuries, because of a likeexclusion in South Carolina law. S. C. Code Ann. $ 42-1-350(1976). Our overruling Parden would require these Statesto reexamine their statutes, meanwhile putting at risk allemployees and employers who have been acting on the assumption that they are protected in the event of injuriescaused by an employer's negligence. Overruling Pardenwould also throw into doubt previous decisions from thisCourt, cases holding that the entire federal scheme of railroad regulation applies to state-owned railroads. UnitedStates v. California, 297 U. S. 175 (1936) (Safety ApplianceAct); California v. Taylor, 353 U. S. 553 (1957) (RailwayLabor Act); see also Transportation Union v. Long IslandR. Co., 455 U. S. 678, 688 (1982). These factors all weigh infavor of adhering to stare decisis, and we cannot find heresufficient, countervailing justifications for departing fromour precedents.IIIRespondent argues that the Court has already consideredand rejected these arguments for following stare decisis inWelch, 483 U. S., at 478. That is not accurate; and even if itwere, Welch is not controlling here. The characterization ofWelch is inaccurate because the most vital consideration ofour decision today, which is that to confer immunity fromstate-court suit would strip all FELA and Jones Act protection from workers employed by the States, was not addressed or at all discussed in the Welch decision. Indeed,that omission can best be explained by the assumption, madeexpress in the concurring opinion of Justice White, that502us1$16L 08-21-96 15:27:13 PAGES OPINPGT204 HILTON v. SOUTH CAROLINA PUBLICRAILWAYS COMM'NOpinion of the Courtthe Jones Act (and so too FELA 2) by its terms extends tothe States. This coverage, and the jurisdiction of statecourts to entertain a suit free from Eleventh Amendmentconstraints, is a plausible explanation for the absence inWelch of any discussion of the practical adverse effects ofoverruling that portion ofParden which pertained only tothe Eleventh Amendment, since continued state-court jurisdiction made those effects minimal.Further, we cannot treat the holding of Welch as determinative of the issue now presented for our decision. As weexplained in Welch, supra, at 471, our Eleventh Amendmentcases do indeed hold that "Congress may abrogate theStates' constitutionally secured immunity from suit in federal court only by making its intention unmistakably clearin the language of the statute."Atascadero State Hospitalv.Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 242 (1985) (emphasis added).Congressional intent to abrogate Eleventh Amendment im-munity must be expressed in the text of the statute; theCourt will not look to legislative history in making its inquiry. Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U. S. 223, 230 (1989). Thesecases establish a rule of constitutional law based on the Eleventh Amendment. That rule was developed after the Parden decision, and was found in Welch to have undercut thereasoning of Parden and to require Parden's EleventhAmendment holding to be overruled. But as we have stated2 The specific statutory construction issue reserved in Welch was not theprecise issue before the Court today, but rather whether the language ofthe Jones Act ("Any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the courseof his employment," 46 U. S. C. App. $ 688) was correctly interpreted bythe Court in Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm'n, 359 U. S. 275,282-283 (1959), to afford a remedy against the States. Justice White'sconcurrence, Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transportation, 483 U. S., at 495, focused on this question, stating that "Congresshas not disturbed this construction, and the Court, as I understand it,does not now purport to do so." The parties, however, agree that theresolution of this issue should be the same for the Jones Act and FELA.We thus assume so for the purposes of this decision.502us1$16L 08-21-96 15:27:13 PAGES OPINPGT205Cite as: 502 U. S. 197 (1991)Opinion of the Courton many occasions, "the Eleventh Amendment does notapply in state courts." Will, 491 U. S., at 63-64, citingMaine v. Thiboutot, 448 U. S. 1, 9, n. 7 (1980); Nevada v. Hall,440 U. S. 410, 420-421 (1979).The issue becomes, then, a pure question of statutory construction, where the doctrine of stare decisis is most compelling. Respondent argues, and the state courts in this casesaid, that the statutory-construction holding of Parden is nolonger good law because of our later opinion in Will, supra.Respondent would make the result in Will solely a functionof our Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence, reading the caseto adopt a per se rule prohibiting the interpretation of general liability language to include the States, absent a clearstatement by Congress to the effect that Congress intendsto subject the States to the cause of action. Respondentargues that in light of Will, the same considerations whichled us to a partial overruling of Parden in Welch should govern here.We think the argument misconstrues the Will decision.Will did not import the entirety of our Eleventh Amendmentjurisprudence into the area of statutory construction. Ittreated the Eleventh Amendment as a relevant consideration. 491 U. S., at 66-67; Hafer v. Melo, 502 U. S. 21, 30(1991). The primary focus of Will was, as it should havebeen, on the language and history of $ 1983. 491 U. S., at64, 68-70; cf. Dellmuth v. Muth, supra, at 229-230. If Willhad adopted a per se rule of the sort advocated by respondent, that entire discussion would have been unnecessary.The issue in Will and in this case is different from theissue in our Eleventh Amendment cases in a fundamentalrespect: The latter cases involve the application of a rule ofconstitutional law, while the former cases apply an "ordinaryrule of statutory construction." Will, supra, at 65. This502us1$16L 08-21-96 15:27:13 PAGES OPINPGT206 HILTON v. SOUTH CAROLINA PUBLICRAILWAYS COMM'NOpinion of the Courtconclusion is evident from our discussions in EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226, 244, n. 18 (1983), and in Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 470 (1991), last Term. Both cases describe the plain statement rule as "a rule of statutoryconstruction to be applied where statutory intent is ambiguous," ibid., rather than as a rule of constitutional law; andneither case implicated the Eleventh Amendment. The distinction we draw is also supported by the Court's decision inWelch, and in particular by the fact that Welch in explicitterms reserved the statutory construction issue we resolvetoday. 483 U. S., at 476, n. 6.When the issue to be resolved is one of statutory construction, of congressional intent to impose monetary liability onthe States, the requirement of a clear statement by Congressto impose such liability creates a rule that ought to be ofassistance to the Congress and the courts in drafting andinterpreting legislation. The requirement also serves tomake parallel two separate inquiries into state liability:Eleventh Amendment doctrine and canons of statutory interpretation. In most cases, as in Will and Gregory v. Ashcroft, the rule can be followed. The resulting symmetry,making a State's liability or immunity, as the case may be,the same in both federal and state courts, has much to commend it. It also avoids the federalism-related concerns thatarise when the National Government uses the state courtsas the exclusive forum to permit recovery under a congressional statute. This is not an inconsequential argument.Symmetry in the law is more than esthetics. It is predictability and order. But symmetry is not an imperative thatmust override just expectations which themselves rest uponthe predictability and order of stare decisis.In the case before us the clear statement inquiry need notbe made and we need not decide whether FELA satisfiesthat standard, for the rule in any event does not prevail overthe doctrine of stare decisis as applied to a longstanding502us1$16L 08-21-96 15:27:13 PAGES OPINPGT207Cite as: 502 U. S. 197 (1991)O'Connor, J., dissentingstatutory construction implicating important reliance inter-ests. And when the rule is either overcome or inapplicableso that a federal statute does impose liability upon theStates, the Supremacy Clause makes that statute the lawin every State, fully enforceable in state court. Howlett v.Rose, 496 U. S. 356, 367-368 (1990).IVFor the reasons we have stated, the judgment of the SouthCarolina Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with thisopinion.
