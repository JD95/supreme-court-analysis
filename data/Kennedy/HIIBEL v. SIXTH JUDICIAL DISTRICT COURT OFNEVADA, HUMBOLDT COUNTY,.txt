The officer asked him if he had "any identifica-tion on [him]," which we understand as a request to producea driver's license or some other form of written identifica-tion. The man refused and asked why the officer wanted tosee identification. The officer responded that he was con-ducting an investigation and needed to see some identification. The unidentified man became agitated and insisted hehad done nothing wrong. The officer explained that hewanted to find out who the man was and what he was doingthere. After continued refusals to comply with the officer'srequest for identification, the man began to taunt the officerby placing his hands behind his back and telling the officerto arrest him and take him to jail. This routine kept up forseveral minutes: The officer asked for identification 11 timesand was refused each time. After warning the man that hewould be arrested if he continued to refuse to comply, theofficer placed him under arrest.We now know that the man arrested on Grass Valley Roadis Larry Dudley Hiibel. Hiibel was charged with "willfullyresist[ing], delay[ing] or obstruct[ing] a public officer in discharging or attempting to discharge any legal duty of hisoffice" in violation of Nev. Rev. Stat. (NRS) $ 199.280 (2003).The government reasoned that Hiibel had obstructed the of-ficer in carrying out his duties under $ 171.123, a Nevadastatute that defines the legal rights and duties of a policeofficer in the context of an investigative stop.

Rev. 1057 (1984).Stop and identify statutes often combine elements of tradi-tional vagrancy laws with provisions intended to regulatepolice behavior in the course of investigatory stops. Thestatutes vary from State to State, but all permit an officerto ask or require a suspect to disclose his identity. A fewStates model their statutes on the Uniform Arrest Act, amodel code that permits an officer to stop a person reasonably suspected of committing a crime and "demand of himhis name, address, business abroad and whither he is going."Warner, The Uniform Arrest Act, 28 Va. L. Rev. 315, 344(1942). Other statutes are based on the text proposed bythe American Law Institute as part of the Institute's ModelPenal Code. See ALI, Model Penal Code $ 250.6, Comment4, pp. 392-393 (1980). The provision, originally designated$ 250.12, provides that a person who is loitering "under circumstances which justify suspicion that he may be engagedor about to engage in crime commits a violation if he refusesthe request of a peace officer that he identify himself andgive a reasonably credible account of the lawfulness of hisconduct and purposes." $ 250.12 (Tent. Draft No. 13) (1961).In some States, a suspect's refusal to identify himself is amisdemeanor offense or civil violation; in others, it is a factorto be considered in whether the suspect has violated loitering laws. In other States, a suspect may decline to identifyhimself without penalty.Stop and identify statutes have their roots in early Englishvagrancy laws that required suspected vagrants to face arrest unless they gave "a good Account of themselves," 15Geo. 2, ch. 5, $ 2 (1744), a power that itself reflected commonlaw rights of private persons to "arrest any suspicious nightwalker, and detain him till he give a good account ofhimself . . . ." 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, ch. 13, $ 6,p. 130 (6th ed. 1787). In recent decades, the Court hasfound constitutional infirmity in traditional vagrancy laws.542US1 Unit: $U64 [10-31-06 13:51:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN184 HIIBEL v. SIXTH JUDICIAL DIST. COURT OF NEV.,HUMBOLDT CTY.Opinion of the CourtIn Papachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U. S. 156 (1972), theCourt held that a traditional vagrancy law was void forvagueness. Its broad scope and imprecise terms deniedproper notice to potential offenders and permitted police officers to exercise unfettered discretion in the enforcement ofthe law. Seeid., at 167-171.The Court has recognized similar constitutional limitationson the scope and operation of stop and identify statutes. InBrown v. Texas, 443 U. S. 47, 52 (1979), the Court invalidateda conviction for violating a Texas stop and identify statuteon Fourth Amendment grounds. The Court ruled that theinitial stop was not based on specific, objective facts establishing reasonable suspicion to believe the suspect was involved in criminal activity. See id., at 51-52. Absent thatfactual basis for detaining the defendant, the Court held, therisk of "arbitrary and abusive police practices" was too greatand the stop was impermissible. Id., at 52. Four Termslater, the Court invalidated a modified stop and identify statute on vagueness grounds. See Kolender v. Lawson, 461U. S. 352 (1983). The California law in Kolender required asuspect to give an officer " `credible and reliable' " identification when asked to identify himself. Id., at 360. The Courtheld that the statute was void because it provided no standard for determining what a suspect must do to comply withit, resulting in " `virtually unrestrained power to arrest andcharge persons with a violation.' " Ibid. (quoting Lewis v.New Orleans, 415 U. S. 130, 135 (1974) (Powell, J., concurringin result)).The present case begins where our prior cases left off.Here there is no question that the initial stop was based onreasonable suspicion, satisfying the Fourth Amendment requirements noted in Brown. Further, the petitioner has notalleged that the statute is unconstitutionally vague, as in Kolender. Here the Nevada statute is narrower and more precise. The statute in Kolender had been interpreted to require a suspect to give the officer "credible and reliable"542US1 Unit: $U64 [10-31-06 13:51:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN185Cite as: 542 U. S. 177 (2004)Opinion of the Courtidentification. In contrast, the Nevada Supreme Court hasinterpreted NRS $ 171.123(3) to require only that a suspectdisclose his name. See 118 Nev., at 875, 59 P. 3d, at 1206(opinion of Young, C. J.) ("The suspect is not required to provide private details about his background, but merely tostate his name to an officer when reasonable suspicion exists"). As we understand it, the statute does not require asuspect to give the officer a driver's license or any otherdocument. Provided that the suspect either states his nameor communicates it to the officer by other means--a choice,we assume, that the suspect may make--the statute is satis-fied and no violation occurs. Seeid., at 876-877, 59 P. 3d,at 1206-1207.IIIHiibel argues that his conviction cannot stand because theofficer's conduct violated his Fourth Amendment rights.We disagree.Asking questions is an essential part of police investigations. In the ordinary course a police officer is free to aska person for identification without implicating the FourthAmendment. "[I]nterrogation relating to one's identity or arequest for identification by the police does not, by itself,constitute a Fourth Amendment seizure." INS v. Delgado,466 U. S. 210, 216 (1984). Beginning withTerry v. Ohio, 392U. S. 1 (1968), the Court has recognized that a law enforcement officer's reasonable suspicion that a person may be in-volved in criminal activity permits the officer to stop theperson for a brief time and take additional steps to inves-tigate further.Delgado, supra, at 216; United States v.Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U. S. 873, 881 (1975). To ensure thatthe resulting seizure is constitutionally reasonable, a Terrystop must be limited. The officer's action must be " `justified at its inception, and . . . reasonably related in scope tothe circumstances which justified the interference in the firstplace.' " United States v. Sharpe, 470 U. S. 675, 682 (1985)(quotingTerry, supra, at 20). For example, the seizure can542US1 Unit: $U64 [10-31-06 13:51:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN186 HIIBEL v. SIXTH JUDICIAL DIST. COURT OF NEV.,HUMBOLDT CTY.Opinion of the Courtnot continue for an excessive period of time, see UnitedStates v. Place, 462 U. S. 696, 709 (1983), or resemble a traditional arrest, see Dunaway v. New York, 442 U. S. 200, 212(1979).Our decisions make clear that questions concerning a sus-pect's identity are a routine and accepted part of manyTerrystops. See United States v. Hensley, 469 U. S. 221, 229(1985) ("[T]he ability to briefly stop [a suspect], ask ques-tions, or check identification in the absence of probable causepromotes the strong government interest in solving crimesand bringing offenders to justice");Hayes v. Florida, 470U. S. 811, 816 (1985) ("[I]f there are articulable facts supporting a reasonable suspicion that a person has committed acriminal offense, that person may be stopped in order toidentify him, to question him briefly, or to detain him brieflywhile attempting to obtain additional information"); Adamsv. Williams, 407 U. S. 143, 146 (1972) ("A brief stop of a suspicious individual, in order to determine his identity or tomaintain the status quo momentarily while obtaining moreinformation, may be most reasonable in light of the factsknown to the officer at the time").Obtaining a suspect's name in the course of a Terry stopserves important government interests. Knowledge ofidentity may inform an officer that a suspect is wanted foranother offense, or has a record of violence or mental disorder. On the other hand, knowing identity may help cleara suspect and allow the police to concentrate their effortselsewhere. Identity may prove particularly important incases such as this, where the police are investigating whatappears to be a domestic assault. Officers called to investigate domestic disputes need to know whom they are dealingwith in order to assess the situation, the threat to their ownsafety, and possible danger to the potential victim.Although it is well established that an officer may ask asuspect to identify himself in the course of a Terry stop, ithas been an open question whether the suspect can be ar542US1 Unit: $U64 [10-31-06 13:51:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN187Cite as: 542 U. S. 177 (2004)Opinion of the Courtrested and prosecuted for refusal to answer. See Brown,443 U. S., at 53, n. 3. Petitioner draws our attention tostatements in prior opinions that, according to him, answerthe question in his favor. InTerry, Justice White stated ina concurring opinion that a person detained in an investiga-tive stop can be questioned but is "not obliged to answer,answers may not be compelled, and refusal to answer furnishes no basis for an arrest." 392 U. S., at 34. The Courtcited this opinion in dicta inBerkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S.420, 439 (1984), a decision holding that a routine traffic stopis not a custodial stop requiring the protections ofMirandav. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). In the course of explainingwhy Terry stops have not been subject to Miranda, theCourt suggested reasons why Terry stops have a "nonthreatening character," among them the fact that a suspect detained during a Terry stop "is not obliged to respond" toquestions. See Berkemer, supra, at 439, 440. Accordingto petitioner, these statements establish a right to refuse toanswer questions during a Terry stop.We do not read these statements as controlling. The passages recognize that the Fourth Amendment does not imposeobligations on the citizen but instead provides rights againstthe government. As a result, the Fourth Amendment itselfcannot require a suspect to answer questions. This caseconcerns a different issue, however. Here, the source of thelegal obligation arises from Nevada state law, not the FourthAmendment. Further, the statutory obligation does not gobeyond answering an officer's request to disclose a name.See NRS $ 171.123(3) ("Any person so detained shall identifyhimself, but may not be compelled to answer any other inquiry of any peace officer"). As a result, we cannot view thedicta in Berkemer or Justice White's concurrence in Terry asanswering the question whether a State can compel a suspect to disclose his name during a Terry stop.The principles of Terry permit a State to require a suspectto disclose his name in the course of a Terry stop. The rea542US1 Unit: $U64 [10-31-06 13:51:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN188 HIIBEL v. SIXTH JUDICIAL DIST. COURT OF NEV.,HUMBOLDT CTY.Opinion of the Courtsonableness of a seizure under the Fourth Amendment is de-termined "by balancing its intrusion on the individual'sFourth Amendment interests against its promotion of legiti-mate government interests."Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S.648, 654 (1979). The Nevada statute satisfies that standard.The request for identity has an immediate relation to thepurpose, rationale, and practical demands of a Terry stop.The threat of criminal sanction helps ensure that the requestfor identity does not become a legal nullity. On the otherhand, the Nevada statute does not alter the nature of thestop itself: it does not change its duration,Place, supra, at709, or its location, Dunaway, supra, at 212. A state lawrequiring a suspect to disclose his name in the course of avalid Terry stop is consistent with Fourth Amendment prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures.Petitioner argues that the Nevada statute circumvents theprobable-cause requirement, in effect allowing an officer toarrest a person for being suspicious. According to petitioner, this creates a risk of arbitrary police conduct that theFourth Amendment does not permit. Brief for Petitioner28-33. These are familiar concerns; they were central tothe opinion in Papachristou, and also to the decisions limiting the operation of stop and identify statutes in Kolenderand Brown. Petitioner's concerns are met by the requirement that a Terry stop must be justified at its inception and"reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified" the initial stop. 392 U. S., at 20. Under these principles, an officer may not arrest a suspect for failure to identifyhimself if the request for identification is not reasonably related to the circumstances justifying the stop. The Courtnoted a similar limitation in Hayes, where it suggested thatTerry may permit an officer to determine a suspect's identityby compelling the suspect to submit to fingerprinting only ifthere is "a reasonable basis for believing that fingerprintingwill establish or negate the suspect's connection with thatcrime." 470 U. S., at 817. It is clear in this case that the542US1 Unit: $U64 [10-31-06 13:51:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN189Cite as: 542 U. S. 177 (2004)Opinion of the Courtrequest for identification was "reasonably related in scope tothe circumstances which justified" the stop. Terry, supra,at 20. The officer's request was a commonsense inquiry, notan effort to obtain an arrest for failure to identify after aTerry stop yielded insufficient evidence. The stop, the re-quest, and the State's requirement of a response did not contravene the guarantees of the Fourth Amendment.IVPetitioner further contends that his conviction violatesthe Fif th Amendment's prohibiti on on compelled selfincrimination. The Fifth Amendment states that "[n]o per-son . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself." To qualify for the Fifth Amendmentprivilege, a communication must be testimonial, incriminating, and compelled. See United States v. Hubbell, 530 U. S.27, 34-38 (2000).Respondents urge us to hold that the statements NRS$ 171.123(3) requires are nontestimonial, and so outside theClause's scope. We decline to resolve the case on that basis."[T]o be testimonial, an accused's communication must itself,explicitly or implicitly, relate a factual assertion or discloseinformation." Doe v. United States, 487 U. S. 201, 210(1988). See also Hubbell, 530 U. S., at 35. Stating one'sname may qualify as an assertion of fact relating to identity.Production of identity documents might meet the definitionas well. As we noted inHubbell, acts of production mayyield testimony establishing "the existence, authenticity, andcustody of items [the police seek]." Id., at 41. Even ifthese required actions are testimonial, however, petitioner'schallenge must fail because in this case disclosure of hisname presented no reasonable danger of incrimination.The Fifth Amendment prohibits only compelled testimonythat is incriminating. See Brown v. Walker, 161 U. S. 591,598 (1896) (noting that where "the answer of the witness willnot directly show his infamy, but onlytend to disgrace him,542US1 Unit: $U64 [10-31-06 13:51:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN190 HIIBEL v. SIXTH JUDICIAL DIST. COURT OF NEV.,HUMBOLDT CTY.Opinion of the Courthe is bound to answer"). A claim of Fifth Amendment priv-ilege must establish" `reasonable ground to apprehend danger to the witnessfrom his being compelled to answer . . . . [T]he dangerto be apprehended must be real and appreciable, withreference to the ordinary operation of law in the ordinary course of things,--not a danger of an imaginaryand unsubstantial character, having reference to someextraordinary and barely possible contingency, so im-probable that no reasonable man would suffer it to influence his conduct.' " Id., at 599-600 (quoting Queen v.Boyes, 1 B. & S. 311, 330, 121 Eng. Rep. 730, 738 (Q. B.1861) (Cockburn, C. J.)).As we stated in Kastigar v. United States, 406 U. S. 441, 445(1972), the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsoryself-incrimination "protects against any disclosures that thewitness reasonably believes could be used in a criminalprosecution or could lead to other evidence that might beso used." Suspects who have been granted immunity fromprosecution may, therefore, be compelled to answer; with thethreat of prosecution removed, there can be no reasonablebelief that the evidence will be used against them. See id.,at 453.In this case petitioner's refusal to disclose his name wasnot based on any articulated real and appreciable fear thathis name would be used to incriminate him, or that it "wouldfurnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute"him. Hoffman v. United States, 341 U. S. 479, 486 (1951).As best we can tell, petitioner refused to identify himselfonly because he thought his name was none of the officer'sbusiness. Even today, petitioner does not explain how thedisclosure of his name could have been used against him in acriminal case. While we recognize petitioner's strong beliefthat he should not have to disclose his identity, the Fifth542US1 Unit: $U64 [10-31-06 13:51:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN191Cite as: 542 U. S. 177 (2004)Stevens, J., dissentingAmendment does not override the Nevada Legislature'sjudgment to the contrary absent a reasonable belief that thedisclosure would tend to incriminate him.The narrow scope of the disclosure requirement is also important. One's identity is, by definition, unique; yet it is,in another sense, a universal characteristic. Answering arequest to disclose a name is likely to be so insignificant inthe scheme of things as to be incriminating only in unusualcircumstances. See Baltimore City Dept. of Social Servs.v.Bouknight, 493 U. S. 549, 555 (1990) (suggesting that"fact[s] the State could readily establish" may render "anytestimony regarding existence or authenticity [of them] in-sufficiently incriminating"); cf. California v. Byers, 402 U. S.424, 432 (1971) (opinion of Burger, C. J.). In every criminalcase, it is known and must be known who has been arrestedand who is being tried. Cf. Pennsylvania v. Muniz, 496U. S. 582, 601-602 (1990) (principal opinion of Brennan, J.).Even witnesses who plan to invoke the Fifth Amendmentprivilege answer when their names are called to take thestand. Still, a case may arise where there is a substantialallegation that furnishing identity at the time of a stop wouldhave given the police a link in the chain of evidence neededto convict the individual of a separate offense. In that case,the court can then consider whether the privilege applies,and, if the Fifth Amendment has been violated, what remedymust follow. We need not resolve those questions here.The judgment of the Nevada Supreme Court is
