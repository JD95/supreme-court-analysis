S. 469 (1992)Opinion of the Courtsate workers injured or killed while employed upon the navi-gable waters of the United States. The Act allows injuredworkers, without forgoing compensation under the Act, topursue claims against third parties for their injuries. But$ 33(g) of the LHWCA, 33 U. S. C. $ 933(g), provides thatunder certain circumstances if a third-party claim is settledwithout the written approval of the worker's employer, allfuture benefits including medical benefits are forfeited. Thequestion we must decide today is whether the forfeiture pro-vision applies to a worker whose employer, at the time theworker settles with a third party, is neither paying compen-sation to the worker nor yet subject to an order to pay underthe Act. IThe injured worker in this case was Floyd Cowart, andhis estate is now the petitioner. Cowart suffered an injuryto his hand on July 20, 1983, while working on an oil drillingplatform owned by Transco Exploration Company (Transco).The platform was located on the Outer Continental Shelf, anarea subject to the Act. 43 U. S. C. $ 1333(b). Cowart wasan employee of the Nicklos Drilling Company (Nicklos), whoalong with its insurer Compass Insurance Co. (Compass) arerespondents before us. Nicklos and Compass paid Cowarttemporary disability payments for 10 months following hisinjury. At that point Cowart's treating physician releasedhim to return to work, though he found Cowart had a 40%permanent partial disability. App. 75. The Department ofLabor notified Compass that Cowart was owed permanentdisability payments in the total amount of $35,592.77, pluspenalties and interest. This was an informal notice whichdid not constitute an award. No payments were made.Cowart, meanwhile, had filed an action against Transco alleging that Transco's negligence caused his injury. On July1, 1985, Cowart settled the action for $45,000, of which hereceived $29,350.60 after attorney's fees and expenses.Nicklos funded the entire settlement under an indemnifica505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:05 PAGES OPINPGT472 ESTATE OF COWART v. NICKLOS DRILLING CO.Opinion of the Courttion agreement with Transco, and it had prior notice of thesettlement amount. But Cowart made a mistake: He did notsecure from Nicklos a formal, prior, written approval of theTransco settlement.After settling, Cowart filed an administrative claim withthe Department of Labor seeking disability payments fromNicklos. Nicklos denied liability on the grounds that underthe terms of $ 33(g)(2) of the LHWCA, Cowart had forfeitedhis benefits by failing to secure approval from Nicklos andCompass of his settlement with Transco, in the manner required by $ 33(g)(1).Section 33(g) provides in pertinent part:"(g) Compromise obtained by person entitled tocompensation"(1) If the person entitled to compensation (or theperson's representative) enters into a settlement with athird person referred to in subsection (a) of this sectionfor an amount less than the compensation to which theperson (or the person's representative) would be entitledunder this chapter, the employer shall be liable for compensation as determined under subsection (f) of this sec-tion only if written approval of the settlement is obtained from the employer and the employer's carrier,before the settlement is executed, and by the personentitled to compensation (or the person's representa-tive). The approval shall be made on a form providedby the Secretary and shall be filed in the office of thedeputy commissioner within thirty days after the settlement is entered into."(2) If no written approval of the settlement is obtained and filed as required by paragraph (1), or if theemployee fails to notify the employer of any settlementobtained from or judgment rendered against a thirdperson, all rights to compensation and medical benefitsunder this chapter shall be terminated, regardless ofwhether the employer or the employer's insurer has505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:05 PAGES OPINPGT473Cite as: 505 U. S. 469 (1992)Opinion of the Courtmade payments or acknowledged entitlement to benefitsunder this chapter." 33 U. S. C. $ 933(g).The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) rejected Nicklos'argument on the basis of prior interpretations of $ 33(g) bythe Benefits Review Board (Board or BRB). In the firstof those decisions, O'Leary v. Southeast Stevedoring Co., 7BRBS 144 (1977), aff 'd mem., 622 F. 2d 595 (CA9 1980), theBoard held that in an earlier version of $ 33(g) the words"person entitled to compensation" referred only to injuredemployees whose employers were making compensation payments, whether voluntary or pursuant to an award. TheO'Leary decision held that a person not yet receiving bene-fits was not a "person entitled to compensation," even thoughthe person had a valid claim for benefits.The statute was amended to its present form, the form wehave quoted, in 1984. In that year Congress redesignatedthen subsection (g) to what is now (g)(1) and modified itslanguage somewhat, but did not change the phrase "personentitled to compensation." Congress also added the currentsubsection (g)(2), as well as other provisions. Following the1984 amendments the Board decidedDorsey v. Cooper Steve-doring Co., 18 BRBS 25 (1986), app. dism'd, 826 F. 2d 1011(CA11 1987). The Board reaffirmed its interpretation inO'Leary of the phrase "person entitled to compensation,"saying that because the 1984 amendments had not changedthe specific language, Congress was presumed to haveadopted the Board's previous interpretation. It noted thatnothing in the 1984 legislative history disclosed an intent tooverrule the Board's interpretations. The Board decidedthat the forfeiture provisions of subsection (g)(2), includingthe final phrase providing that forfeiture occurs "regardlessof whether the employer . . . has made payments or acknowl-edged entitlement to benefits," was a "separate provisio[n]applicable to separate situations." 18 BRBS, at 29.The ALJ in this case held that under the reasoning ofO'Leary and Dorsey, Cowart was not a person entitled to505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT474 ESTATE OF COWART v. NICKLOS DRILLING CO.Opinion of the Courtcompensation because he was not receiving payments at thetime of the Transco settlement. Thus, the written-approvalprovision did not apply and Cowart was entitled to benefits.Cowart's total disability award was for $35,592.77, less Cowart's net recovery from Transco of $29,350.60, for a net awardof $6,242.17. In addition, Cowart was awarded interest, at-torney's fees, and future medical benefits, the last constituting, we think, a matter of great potential consequence. TheBoard affirmed in reliance onDorsey. 23 BRBS 42 (1989)(per curiam).On review, a panel of the Court of Appeals for the FifthCircuit reversed. 907 F. 2d 1552 (1990). Without addressing the Board's specific statutory interpretation, it held that$ 33(g) contains no exceptions to its written-approval requirement. Because this holding, and a decision by a panelin a different case, Petroleum Helicopters, Inc. v. Barger, 910F. 2d 276 (CA5 1990), conflicted with a previous unpublisheddecision in the same Circuit, Kahny v. O. W. C. P., 729 F. 2d777 (CA5 1984), the Court of Appeals granted rehearing enbanc. The Director of the Office of Workers' CompensationPrograms (OWCP), a part of the Department of Labor, 20CFR $ 701.201 (1991), appeared as a respondent before thefull Court of Appeals to defend the interpretation and decision of the Board.In a per curiam opinion, the en banc Court of Appealsconfirmed the panel's decision reversing the BRB in its Cowart case. 927 F. 2d 828 (CA5 1991). The Court of Appeals'majority held that $ 33(g) is unambiguous in providing forforfeiture whenever an LHWCA claimant fails to get writtenapproval from his employer of a third-party settlement.The majority acknowledged the well-established principle requiring judicial deference to reasonable interpretations byan agency of the statute it administers, but concluded thatthe plain language of $ 33(g) leaves no room for interpretation. Judge Politz, joined by Judges King and Johnson, dissented on the ground that the OWCP's was a reasonable505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT475Cite as: 505 U. S. 469 (1992)Opinion of the Courtagency interpretation of the phrase "person entitled to compensation," to which the Court of Appeals should havedeferred.We granted certiorari because of the large number ofLHWCA claimants who might be affected by the Court ofAppeals' decision. 502 U. S. 1003 (1991). We now affirm.IIIn a statutory construction case, the beginning point mustbe the language of the statute, and when a statute speakswith clarity to an issue judicial inquiry into the statute'smeaning, in all but the most extraordinary circumstance, isfinished. Demarest v. Manspeaker, 498 U. S. 184, 190 (1991).The question is whether Cowart, at the time of the Transcosettlement, was a "person entitled to compensation" underthe terms of $ 33(g)(1) of the LHWCA. Cowart concedesthat he did not comply with the written-approval requirements of the statute, while Nicklos and Compass do not claimthat they lacked notice of the Transco settlement. By theterms of $ 33(g)(2), Cowart would have forfeited his LHWCAbenefits if, and only if, he was subject to the written-approvalprovisions of $ 33(g)(1). Cowart claims that he is not subjectto the approval requirement because in his view the phrase"person entitled to compensation," as long interpreted byboth the BRB and the OWCP, limits the reach of $ 33(g)(1)to injured workers who are either already receiving compensation payments from their employer, or in whose favor anaward of compensation has been entered. Nicklos and Compass, supported by the United States, defend the holding ofthe Court of Appeals that $ 33(g) cannot support that reading. We agree with these respondents and hold that underthe plain language of $ 33(g), Cowart forfeited his right tofurther LHWCA benefits by failing to obtain the writtenapproval of Nicklos and Compass prior to settling withTransco.505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT476 ESTATE OF COWART v. NICKLOS DRILLING CO.Opinion of the CourtThe controlling principle in this case is the basic and unex-ceptional rule that courts must give effect to the clear meaning of statutes as written. The principle can at times comeinto some tension with another fundamental principle of ourlaw, one requiring judicial deference to a reasonable statutory interpretation by an administering agency. ChevronU. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467U. S. 837 (1984); National Railroad Passenger Corporationv.Boston & Maine Corp., 503 U. S. 407, 417 (1992). Ofcourse, a reviewing court should not defer to an agency posi-tion which is contrary to an intent of Congress expressed inunambiguous terms. K mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 U. S.281, 291 (1988); Chevron, supra, at 842-843. In any event,we need not resolve any tension of that sort here, becausethe Director of the OWCP and the Department of Laborhave altered their position regarding the best interpretationof $ 33(g). The Director appears as a respondent before us,arguing in favor of the Court of Appeals' statutory interpretation, and contrary to his previous position. See Brief forFederal Respondent 8, n. 6. If the Director asked us todefer to his new statutory interpretation, this case mightpresent a difficult question regarding whether and underwhat circumstances deference is due to an interpretation formulated during litigation. See Bowen v. Georgetown Univ.Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 212-213 (1988); Martin v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm'n, 499 U. S. 144, 158(1991). The agency does not ask this, however. Instead,the federal respondent argues that the Court of Appeals wascorrect in saying the language of $ 33(g) is plain and cannotsupport the interpretation given it by the Board. Becausewe agree with the federal respondent and the Court of Appeals, and because Cowart concedes that the position of theBRB is not entitled to any special deference, see Brief forPetitioner 25; see also Potomac Electric Power Co. v. Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, 449 U. S.268, 278, n. 18 (1980); Martin v. Occupational Safety and505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT477Cite as: 505 U. S. 469 (1992)Opinion of the CourtHealth Review Comm'n, supra, we need not resolve the dif-ficult issues regarding deference which would be lurking inother circumstances.As a preliminary matter, the natural reading of the statutesupports the Court of Appeals' conclusion that a person entitled to compensation need not be receiving compensation orhave had an adjudication in his favor. Both in legal and general usage, the normal meaning of entitlement includes aright or benefit for which a person qualifies, and it does notdepend upon whether the right has been acknowledged oradjudicated. It means only that the person satisfies the prerequisites attached to the right. See generally Board ofRegents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 577 (1972)(discussing property interests protected by the Due ProcessClause and contrasting an entitlement to an expectancy);Black's Law Dictionary 532 (6th ed. 1990) (defining "entitle"as "To qualify for; to furnish with proper grounds for seekingor claiming"). Cowart suffered an injury which by theterms of the LHWCA gave him a right to compensation fromhis employer. He became a person entitled to compensationat the moment his right to recovery vested, not when hisemployer admitted liability, an event even yet to happen.If the language of $ 33(g)(1), in isolation, left any doubt,the structure of the statute would remove all ambiguity.First, and perhaps most important, when Congress amended$ 33(g) in 1984, it added the explicit forfeiture features of$ 33(g)(2), which specify that forfeiture occurs "regardless ofwhether the employer or the employer's insurer has madepayments or acknowledged entitlement to benefits under thischapter." We read that phrase to modify the entirety ofsubsection (g)(2), including the beginning part discussing thewritten-approval requirement of paragraph (1). The BRBdid not find this amendment controlling because the quotedlanguage is not an explicit modification of subsection (1).This is a strained reading of what Congress intended. Subsection (g)(2) leaves little doubt that the contemplated for505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT478 ESTATE OF COWART v. NICKLOS DRILLING CO.Opinion of the Courtfeiture will occur whether or not the employer has made pay-ments or acknowledged liability.The addition of subsection (g)(2) in 1984 also precludesthe primary argument made by the BRB in favor of its decisions in Dorsey and this case, and repeated by Cowart to us:That Congress in 1984, by reenacting the phrase "personentitled to compensation," adopted the Board's reading ofthat language in O'Leary. The argument might have hadsome force if $ 33(g) had been reenacted without changes,but that was not the case. In 1984 Congress did more thanreenact $ 33(g); it added new provisions and new languagewhich on their face appear to have the specific purpose ofoverruling the prior administrative interpretation. In lightof the clear import of $ 33(g)(2), the Board erred in relyingon the purported lack of legislative history showing an explicit intent to reject the O'Leary decision. Even were itrelevant, the Board's reading of the legislative history issuspect because as the federal respondent demonstrates, thelegislative history of predecessor bills to the eventual 1984enactment do indicate an intent to overturn O'Leary. SeeLongshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation ActAmendments of 1981: Hearings on S. 1182 before the Subcommittee on Labor of the Senate Committee on Labor andHuman Resources, 97th Cong., 1st Sess., 209, 210-211, 396(1981). In any event, administrative interpretation followedby congressional reenactment cannot overcome the plain language of a statute. Demarest v. Manspeaker, 498 U. S., at190. And the language of $ 33(g) is plain.Our interpretation of $ 33(g) is reinforced by the fact thatthe phrase "person entitled to compensation" appears elsewhere in the statute in contexts in which it cannot bear themeaning placed on it by Cowart. For example, $ 14(h) of theLHWCA, 33 U. S. C. $ 914(h), requires an official to conductan investigation upon the request of a person entitled to compensation when, inter alia, the claim is controverted andpayments are not being made. For that provision, the inter505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT479Cite as: 505 U. S. 469 (1992)Opinion of the Courtpretation championed by Cowart would be nonsensical. An-other difficulty would be presented for the provision preceding $ 33(g), $ 33(f). It mandates that an employer's liabilitybe reduced by the net amount a person entitled to compensation recovers from a third party. Under Cowart's reading,the reduction would not be available to employers who hadnot yet begun payment at the time of the third-party recovery. That result makes no sense under the LHWCA struc-ture. Indeed, when a litigant before the BRB made this argument, the Board rejected it, acknowledging in so doingthat it had adopted differing interpretations of the identicallanguage in $$ 33(f) and 33(g). Force v. Kaiser Aluminumand Chemical Corp., 23 BRBS 1, 4-5 (1989). This result iscontrary to the basic canon of statutory construction thatidentical terms within an Act bear the same meaning. Sullivan v. Stroop, 496 U. S. 478, 484 (1990); Sorenson v. Secretaryof Treasury, 475 U. S. 851, 860 (1986). The Board's willingness to adopt such a forced and unconventional approachdoes not convince us we should do the same. And we oweno deference to the BRB, see supra, at 476.Yet another reason why we are not convinced by theBoard's position is that the Board's interpretation of "personentitled to compensation" has not been altogether consistent;and Cowart's interpretation may not be the same as theBoard's in precise respects. At times the Board has saidthis language refers to an employee whose "employer is actually paying compensation either pursuant to an award or voluntarily when claimant enters into a third party settlement."Dorsey, 18 BRBS, at 28; 23 BRBS, at 44 (case below). Atother times, sometimes within the same opinion, the Boardhas spoken in terms of the employer either making paymentsor acknowledging liability. O'Leary, 7 BRBS, at 147-149;Dorsey, supra, at 29; see also In re Wilson, 17 BRBS 471,480 (ALJ 1985). Cowart, on the other hand, would includewithin the phrase both employees receiving compensationbenefits and employees who have a judicial award of compen505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT480 ESTATE OF COWART v. NICKLOS DRILLING CO.Opinion of the Courtsation but are not receiving benefits. Brief for Petitioner 6.This distinction is an important part of Cowart's response tothe position of the United States. Reply Brief for Petitioner8. It may be that the gap between the Board's and Cowart'spositions can be explained by the Board's inconsistency; butthat in itself weakens any argument that the Board's inter-pretation is entitled to some weight.We do not believe that Congress' use of the word "em-ployee" in subsection (g)(2), rather than the phrase "personentitled to compensation," undercuts our reading of thestatute. The plain meaning of subsection (g)(1) cannot bealtered by the use of a somewhat different term in anotherpart of the statute. Subsection (g)(2) does not purport tospeak to the question of who is required under subsection(g)(1) to obtain prior written approval.Cowart's strongest argument to the Court of Appeals wasthat any ambiguity in the statute favors him because of thedeference due the OWCP Director's statutory construction,a deference which Nicklos and Compass concede is appropriate. Brief for Private Respondents 7. As we have said,we are not faced with this difficult issue because the viewsof the OWCP Director have changed since we granted certiorari. Supra, at 476. It seems apparent to us that it wouldbe quite inappropriate to defer to an interpretation whichhas been abandoned by the policymaking agency itself. Itis noteworthy, moreover, that even prior to this case the position of the Department of Labor has not been altogetherconsistent. It is true that the Director has twice, albeit ina somewhat equivocal manner, endorsed the Board's rulingsin O'Leary and Dorsey. First, in a 1986 circular discussingthe Board's Dorsey case a subordinate of the Director stated:"While the Board's position may not be totally consistentwith the amended language of Section 33(g), we think it is arational approach and have advised the Associate Solicitorthat we will support this position." United States Dept. ofLabor, LHWCA Circular No. 86-3, p. 1 (May 30, 1986).505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT481Cite as: 505 U. S. 469 (1992)Opinion of the CourtNext, in a manual published in 1989 the Director againadopted the Board's position that written approval of a settlement is required only from employers who are payingcompensation; but the statement ends with a qualifyingcomment, that "[t]he issue of consent to a settlement can bea complex matter. Judicial interpretation may be necessaryto resolve the issue. (See LHWCA CIRCULAR 86-03, 5-30-86)." U. S. Dept. of Labor, Longshore and Harbor Work-ers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) Procedure Manual, ch. 3-600, || 9 (Sept. 1989). On the other hand, the Department ofLabor has issued regulations (effective in their current formsince 1986) which are explicit that the written-approval requirement of $ 33(g) applies to a settlement for less than theamount of compensation due under the LHWCA, "regardlessof whether the employer or carrier has made payments of[sic] acknowledged entitlement to benefits under the Act."20 CFR $ 702.281(b) (1991). So the Department of Laborhas not been speaking with one voice on this issue. Thisfurther diminishes the persuasive power of the Director'searlier decision to endorse the BRB's questionable interpretation, a decision he has since reconsidered.The history of the Department of Labor regulation goesfar toward confirming our view of the significance of the 1984amendments. The original $ 702.281, proposed in 1976 andenacted in final form in 1977, required only that an employeenotify his employer and the Department of any third-partyclaim, settlement, or judgment. 41 Fed. Reg. 34297 (1976);42 Fed. Reg. 45303 (1977). The sole reference to the forfeiture provisions was a closing parenthetical: "Caution:See 33 U. S. C. $ 933(g)." In 1985, in response to the 1984congressional amendments, the Department proposed toamend $ 702.281 by replacing the closing parenthetical witha subsection (b), stating that failure to obtain written approval of settlements for amounts less than the compensationdue under the Act would lead to forfeiture of future benefits.50 Fed. Reg. 400 (1985). In response to comments, the final505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT482 ESTATE OF COWART v. NICKLOS DRILLING CO.Opinion of the Courtrulemaking modified $ 702.281(b) to clarify that the forfeiture provision applied regardless of whether the employerwas paying compensation. 51 Fed. Reg. 4284-4285 (1986).Thus the evolution of $ 702.281 suggests that at least someelements within the Department of Labor read the 1984 statutory amendments to adopt a rule different from the Board'sprevious decisions.We also reject Cowart's argument that our interpretationof $ 33(g) leaves the notification requirements of $ 33(g)(2)without meaning. An employee is required to provide notification to his employer, but is not required to obtain writtenapproval, in two instances: (1) Where the employee obtainsa judgment, rather than a settlement, against a third party;and (2) Where the employee settles for an amount greaterthan or equal to the employer's total liability. Under ourconstruction the written-approval requirement of $ 33(g)(1)is inapplicable in those instances, but the notification requirement of $ 33(g)(2) remains in force. That is why subsection (g)(2) mandates that an employer be notified of "anysettlement."This view comports with the purposes and structure of$ 33. Section 33(f) provides that the net amount of damagesrecovered from any third party for the injuries sustainedreduces the compensation owed by the employer. So theemployer is a real party in interest with respect to any settlement that might reduce but not extinguish the employer'sliability. The written-approval requirement of $ 33(g) "protects the employer against his employee's accepting too littlefor his cause of action against a third party." Banks v. Chicago Grain Trimmers Assn., Inc., 390 U. S. 459, 467 (1968).In cases where a judgment is entered, however, the employee does not determine the amount of his recovery, andemployer approval, even if somehow feasible, would serve nopurpose. And in cases where the employee settles forgreater than the employer's liability, the employer is pro505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT483Cite as: 505 U. S. 469 (1992)Opinion of the Courttected regardless of the precise amount of the settlementbecause his liability for compensation is wiped out. Notification provides full protection to the employer in these situations because it ensures against fraudulent double recoveryby the employee.As a final line of defense, Cowart's attorney suggested atoral argument that Nicklos' participation in the Transco settlement brought this case outside the terms of $ 33(g)(1).Tr. of Oral Arg. 4-7. Relying on the recent decision of theCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in I. T. O. Corporation of Baltimore v. Sellman, 954 F. 2d 239, 242-243 (1992),counsel argued that $ 33(g)(1) requires written approval onlyof "settlement[s] with a third person," and that Nicklos' participation in the Transco settlement meant it was not witha third person. Without indicating any view on the meritsof this contention, we do not address it because it is notfairly included within the question on which certiorariwas granted. See this Court's Rule 14.1(a).We need not today decide the retroactive effect of our decision, nor the relevance of res judicata principles for otherLHWCA beneficiaries who may be affected by our decision.Cf. Pittston Coal Group v. Sebben, 488 U. S. 105, 121-123(1988). We do recognize the stark and troubling possibilitythat significant numbers of injured workers or their familiesmay be stripped of their LHWCA benefits by this statute,and that its forfeiture penalty creates a trap for the unwary.It also provides a powerful tool to employers who resist liability under the Act. Counsel for respondents stated duringoral argument that he had used the Transco settlement as ameans of avoiding Nicklos' liability under the LHWCA. Tr.of Oral Arg. 23-26. These harsh effects of $ 33(g) may beexacerbated by the inconsistent course followed over theyears by the federal agencies charged with enforcing the Act.But Congress has spoken with great clarity to the precisequestion raised by this case. It is the duty of the courts to505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT484 ESTATE OF COWART v. NICKLOS DRILLING CO.Blackmun, J., dissentingenforce the judgment of the Legislature, however much wemight question its wisdom or fairness. Often we have urgedthe Congress to speak with greater clarity, and in this stat-ute it has done so. If the effects of the law are to be alleviated, that is within the province of the Legislature. It isCongress that has the authority to change the statute, notthe courts.For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals is
