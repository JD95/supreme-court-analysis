We must decide whether a white criminal defendant hasstanding to object to discrimination against black persons inthe selection of grand jurors. Finding he has the requisitestanding to raise equal protection and due process claims, wereverse and remand. IA grand jury in Evangeline Parish, Louisiana, indictedpetitioner Terry Campbell on one count of second-degree*Joshua L. Dratel, Lisa Kemler, and Richard A. Greenberg filed abrief for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as amicuscuriae urging reversal.523US2 Unit: $U51 [04-29-00 17:25:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN395Cite as: 523 U. S. 392 (1998)Opinion of the Courtmurder. Campbell, who is white, filed a timely pretrial mo-tion to quash the indictment on the grounds the grand jurywas constituted in violation of his equal protection and dueprocess rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and in violation of the Sixth Amendment's fair-cross-section requirement. Campbell alleged a longstanding practice of racialdiscrimination in the selection of grand jury forepersons inthe parish. His sole piece of evidence is that, between Janu-ary 1976 and August 1993, no black person served as a grandjury foreperson in the parish, even though more than 20 per-cent of the registered voters were black persons. See Brieffor Petitioner 16. The State does not dispute this evidence.The trial judge refused to quash the indictment because"Campbell, being a white man accused of killing anotherwhite man," lacked standing to complain "where all of theforepersons were white." App. to Pet. for Cert. G-33.After Campbell's first trial resulted in a mistrial, he wasretried, convicted of second-degree murder, and sentenced tolife in prison without possibility of parole. Campbell renewed his challenge to the grand jury foreperson selectionprocedures in a motion for new trial, which was denied. Seeid., at I-2. The Louisiana Court of Appeal reversed, because, under our decision in Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400(1991), Campbell had standing to object to the alleged discrimination even though he is white. 651 So. 2d 412 (1995).The Court of Appeal remanded the case for an evidentiaryhearing because it found Campbell's evidence of discrimination inadequate. Id., at 413.The Louisiana Supreme Court reversed. It distinguishedPowers as turning on the "considerable and substantial impact" that a prosecutor's discriminatory use of peremptorychallenges has on a defendant's trial as well as on the integrity of the judicial system. See 661 So. 2d 1321, 1324 (1995).The court declined to extend Powers to a claim of discrimination in the selection of a grand jury foreperson. It alsofound Hobby v. United States, 468 U. S. 339 (1984), did not523US2 Unit: $U51 [04-29-00 17:25:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN396 CAMPBELL v. LOUISIANAOpinion of the Courtafford Campbell standing to raise a due process objection.In Hobby, this Court held no relief could be granted to awhite defendant even if his due process rights were violatedby discrimination in the selection of a federal grand juryforeperson. Noting that Hobby turned on the ministerialnature of the federal grand jury foreperson's duties, the Louisiana Supreme Court held "[t]he role of the grand jury fore-man in Louisiana appears to be similarly ministerial" suchthat any discrimination "has little, if any, effect on the de-fendant's due process right of fundamental fairness." 661So. 2d, at 1324. Because the Court of Appeal had not ad-dressed Campbell's other asserted points of error, the Louisiana Supreme Court remanded the case. After the Court ofAppeal rejected Campbell's remaining claims, 673 So. 2d1061 (1996), the Louisiana Supreme Court refused to recon-sider its ruling on the grand jury issue, 685 So. 2d 140 (1997).We granted certiorari to address the narrow question ofCampbell's standing to raise equal protection, due process,and fair-cross-section claims. 521 U. S. 1151 (1997).IIAs an initial matter, we note Campbell complains aboutmore than discrimination in the selection of his grand juryforeperson; he alleges that discrimination shaped the compo-sition of the grand jury itself. In the federal system and inmost States which use grand juries, the foreperson is se-lected from the ranks of the already seated grand jurors.See 1 S. Beale, W. Bryson, J. Felman, & M. Elston, GrandJury Law and Practice $ 4:6, pp. 4-20 to 4-21 (2d ed. 1997)(either the judge selects the foreperson or fellow grandjurors elect him or her). Under those systems, the title"foreperson" is bestowed on one of the existing grand jurorswithout any change in the grand jury's composition. InLouisiana, by contrast, the judge selects the foreperson fromthe grand jury venire before the remaining members of thegrand jury have been chosen by lot. La. Code Crim. Proc.523US2 Unit: $U51 [04-29-00 17:25:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN397Cite as: 523 U. S. 392 (1998)Opinion of the CourtAnn., Art. 413(B) (West Supp. 1997); see also 1 Beale, supra,at 4-22, n. 11 (Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Virginia useprocedures similar to Louisiana's). In addition to his otherduties, the foreperson of the Louisiana grand jury has thesame full voting powers as other grand jury members. Asa result, when the Louisiana judge selected the foreperson,he also selected one member of the grand jury outside of thedrawing system used to compose the balance of that body.These considerations require us to treat the case as one al-leging discriminatory selection of grand jurors.IIIStanding to litigate often turns on imprecise distinctionsand requires difficult line-drawing. On occasion, however,we can ascertain standing with relative ease by applyingrules established in prior cases. SeeAllen v. Wright, 468U. S. 737, 751 (1984). Campbell's equal protection claim issuch an instance.InPowers v. Ohio, supra, we found a white defendant hadstanding to challenge racial discrimination against black persons in the use of peremptory challenges. We determinedthe defendant himself could raise the equal protection rightsof the excluded jurors. Recognizing our general reluctanceto permit a litigant to assert the rights of a third party, wefound three preconditions had been satisfied: (1) the defend-ant suffered an "injury in fact"; (2) he had a "close relationship" to the excluded jurors; and (3) there was some hin-drance to the excluded jurors asserting their own rights.Powers, supra, at 411 (citing Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U. S.106 (1976)). We concluded a white defendant suffers a serious injury in fact because discrimination at the voir direstage " `casts doubt on the integrity of the judicial process'. . . and places the fairness of a criminal proceeding in doubt."499 U. S., at 411. This cloud of doubt deprives the defendantof the certainty that a verdict in his case "is given in accord-ance with the law by persons who are fair." Id., at 413.523US2 Unit: $U51 [04-29-00 17:25:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN398 CAMPBELL v. LOUISIANAOpinion of the CourtSecond, the excluded juror and criminal defendant have aclose relationship: They share a common interest in eliminating discrimination, and the criminal defendant has an in-centive to serve as an effective advocate because a victorymay result in overturning his conviction. Id., at 413-414.Third, given the economic burdens of litigation and the smallfinancial reward available, "a juror dismissed because of raceprobably will leave the courtroom possessing little incentiveto set in motion the arduous process needed to vindicate hisown rights." Id., at 415. Upon consideration of these fac-tors, we concluded a white defendant had standing to bringan equal protection challenge to racial discrimination againstblack persons in the petit jury selection process.Although Campbell challenges discriminatory selection ofgrand jurors, rather than petit jurors, Powers' reasoning applies to this case on the question of standing. Our priorcases have not decided whether a white defendant's ownequal protection rights are violated when the compositionof his grand jury is tainted by discrimination against blackpersons. We do not need to address this issue becauseCampbell seeks to assert the well-established equal protection rights of black persons not to be excluded from grandjury service on the basis of their race. See Tr. 9 (Dec. 2,1993); see also Carter v. Jury Comm'n of Greene Cty., 396U. S. 320, 329-330 (1970) (racial exclusion of prospectivegrand and petit jurors violates their constitutional rights).Campbell satisfies the three preconditions for third-partystanding outlined in Powers.Regardless of his or her skin color, the accused suffers asignificant injury in fact when the composition of the grandjury is tainted by racial discrimination. "[D]iscriminationon the basis of race in the selection of members of a grandjury . . . strikes at the fundamental values of our judicialsystem" because the grand jury is a central component of thecriminal justice process. Rose v. Mitchell, 443 U. S. 545, 556(1979). The Fifth Amendment requires the Federal Gov523US2 Unit: $U51 [04-29-00 17:25:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN399Cite as: 523 U. S. 392 (1998)Opinion of the Courternment to use a grand jury to initiate a prosecution, and 22States adopt a similar rule as a matter of state law. See 1Beale, supra, $ 1:2, at 1-3; see also Hurtado v. California,110 U. S. 516 (1884) (Fifth Amendment's grand jury requirement is not binding on the States). The grand jury, like thepetit jury, "acts as a vital check against the wrongful exer-cise of power by the State and its prosecutors."Powers,supra, at 411. It controls not only the initial decision to in-dict, but also significant decisions such as how many countsto charge and whether to charge a greater or lesser offense,including the important decision to charge a capital crime.See Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 263 (1986). The integrity of these decisions depends on the integrity of the processused to select the grand jurors. If that process is infectedwith racial discrimination, doubt is cast over the fairness ofall subsequent decisions. See Rose, supra, at 555-556 ("Selection of members of a grand jury because they are of onerace and not another destroys the appearance of justice andthereby casts doubt on the integrity of the judicial process").Powers emphasized the harm inflicted when a prosecutordiscriminates by striking racial minorities in open court andin front of the entire jury pool. The Court expressed concern that this tactic might encourage the jury to be lawlessin its own actions. See 499 U. S., at 412-413. The Statesuggests this sort of harm is not inflicted when a singlegrand juror is selected based on racial prejudice because thediscrimination is invisible to the grand jurors on that panel;it only becomes apparent when a pattern emerges over thecourse of years. See Brief for Respondent 16. This argument, however, underestimates the seriousness of the allegations. In Powers, even if the prosecutor had been motivatedby racial prejudice, those responsible for the defendant'sfate, the judge and the jury, had shown no actual bias. If,by contrast, the allegations here are true, the impartialityand discretion of the judge himself would be called intoquestion.523US2 Unit: $U51 [04-29-00 17:25:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN400 CAMPBELL v. LOUISIANAOpinion of the CourtThe remaining two preconditions to establish third-partystanding are satisfied with little trouble. We find no reasonwhy a white defendant would be any less effective as an ad-vocate for excluded grand jurors than for excluded petit jurors. See Powers, supra, at 413-414. The defendant andthe excluded grand juror share a common interest in eradicating discrimination from the grand jury selection process,and the defendant has a vital interest in asserting the excluded juror's rights because his conviction may be over-turned as a result. SeeVasquez, supra, at 264; Rose, supra,at 551; Cassell v. Texas, 339 U. S. 282 (1950). The State contends Campbell's connection to "the excluded class of . . .jurors . . . who were not called to serve . . . for the prior161/2 years is tenuous, at best." Brief for Respondent 22.This argument confuses Campbell's underlying claim withthe evidence needed to prove it. To assert the rights ofthose venirepersons who were excluded from serving on thegrand jury in his case, Campbell must prove their exclusionwas on account of intentional discrimination. He seeks todo so based on past treatment of similarly situated venire-persons in other cases, seeCastaneda v. Partida, 430 U. S.482, 494 (1977), but this does not mean he seeks to assertthose venirepersons' rights. As a final matter, excludedgrand jurors have the same economic disincentives to asserttheir own rights as do excluded petit jurors. See Powers,supra, at 415. We find Campbell, like any other white de-fendant, has standing to raise an equal protection challengeto discrimination against black persons in the selection of hisgrand jury.IVIt is axiomatic that one has standing to litigate his or herown due process rights. We need not explore the natureand extent of a defendant's due process rights when he al-leges discriminatory selection of grand jurors, and confineour holding to his standing to raise the issue. Our decisionin Peters v. Kiff addressed the due process question, al523US2 Unit: $U51 [04-29-00 17:25:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN401Cite as: 523 U. S. 392 (1998)Opinion of the Courtthough a majority of Justices could not agree on a comprehensive statement of the rule or an appropriate remedy forany violation. See 407 U. S. 493, 504 (1972) (opinion of Marshall, J.) ("[W]hatever his race, a criminal defendant hasstanding to challenge the system used to select his grand . . .jury, on the ground that it arbitrarily excludes . . . membersof any race, and thereby denies him due process of law"); id.,at 507 (White, J., joined by Brennan and Powell, JJ., concurring in judgment) ("[T]he strong statutory policy of [18U. S. C.] $ 243, which reflects the central concern of the Fourteenth Amendment" permits a white defendant to challengediscrimination in grand jury selection). Our more recentdecision in Hobby v. United States proceeded on the impliedassumption that a white defendant had standing to raise adue process objection to discriminatory appointment of a federal grand jury foreperson and skipped ahead to the questionwhether a remedy was available. 468 U. S., at 350. It isunnecessary here to discuss the nature and full extent of dueprocess protection in the context of grand jury selection.That issue, to the extent it is still open based upon our earlierprecedents, should be determined on the merits, assuming acourt finds it necessary to reach the point in light of theconcomitant equal protection claim. The relevant assumption of Hobby, and our holding here, is that a defendant hasstanding to litigate whether his conviction was procured bymeans or procedures which contravene due process.The Louisiana Supreme Court erred in reading Hobby toforeclose Campbell's standing to bring a due process challenge. 661 So. 2d, at 1324. In Hobby, we held discrimination in the selection of a federal grand jury foreperson didnot infringe principles of fundamental fairness because theforeperson's duties were "ministerial." See Hobby, supra,at 345-346. In this case, the Louisiana Supreme Court decided a Louisiana grand jury foreperson's duties were ministerial too, but then couched its decision in terms of Camp523US2 Unit: $U51 [04-29-00 17:25:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN402 CAMPBELL v. LOUISIANAOpinion of the Courtbell's lack of standing to litigate a due process claim. 661So. 2d, at 1324.The Louisiana Supreme Court was wrong on both counts.Its interpretation ofHobby is inconsistent with the implicitassumption of standing we have just noted and with our explicit reasoning in that case. In Hobby, a federal grand juryforeperson was selected from the existing grand jurors, sothe decision to pick one grand juror over another, at leastarguably, affected the defendant only if the foreperson wasgiven some significant duties that he would not have hadas a regular grand juror. Seesupra, at 396. Against thisbackground, the Court rejected the defendant's claim because the ministerial role of a federal grand jury foreperson"is not such a vital one that discrimination in the appointment of an individual to that post significantly invades" dueprocess. Hobby, supra, at 346. Campbell's challenge is different in kind and degree because it implicates the impermissible appointment of a member of the grand jury. Seesupra, at 396-397. What concerns Campbell is not the foreperson's performance of his duty to preside, but performanceas a grand juror, namely, voting to charge Campbell withsecond-degree murder.The significance of this distinction was acknowledged byHobby's discussion of a previous case, Rose v. Mitchell, 443U. S. 545 (1979). In Rose, we assumed relief could begranted for a constitutional challenge to discrimination in theappointment of a state grand jury foreperson. See id., at556. Hobby distinguished Rose in part because it involvedTennessee's grand jury system. Under the Tennessee lawthen in effect, 12 members of the grand jury were selectedat random, and then the judge appointed a 13th member whoalso served as foreperson. See Hobby, 468 U. S., at 347. Asa result, Hobby pointed out discrimination in selection ofthe foreperson in Tennessee was much more serious thanin the federal system because the former can affect the composition of the grand jury whereas the latter cannot: "So523US2 Unit: $U51 [04-29-00 17:25:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN403Cite as: 523 U. S. 392 (1998)Opinion of Thomas, J.long as the grand jury itself is properly constituted, thereis no risk that the appointment of any one of its membersas foreman will distort the overall composition of the arrayor otherwise taint the operation of the judicial process."Id., at 348. By its own terms, then, Hobby does not addressa claim like Campbell's.VOne of the questions raised on certiorari is whether Camp-bell also has standing to raise a fair-cross-section claim. Itappears neither the Louisiana Supreme Court nor the Louisi-ana Court of Appeal discussed this contention. "With `veryrare exceptions,' . . . we will not consider a petitioner's fed-eral claim unless it was either addressed by or properly presented to the state court that rendered the decision we havebeen asked to review."Adams v. Robertson, 520 U. S. 83,86 (1997) (per curiam). Campbell has made no effort tomeet his burden of showing this issue was properly pre-sented to the Louisiana appellate courts, even after the Statepointed out this omission before this Court. See Brief forRespondent 29-30. In fact, Campbell devotes no more thanone page of text in his brief to his fair-cross-section claim.See Brief for Petitioner 31-32. We decline to address theissue.The judgment of the Louisiana Supreme Court is reversed.The case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsist-ent with this opinion.
