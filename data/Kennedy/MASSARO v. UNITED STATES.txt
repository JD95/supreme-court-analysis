Petitioner, Joseph Massaro, was indicted on federal rack-eteering charges, including murder in aid of racketeering, 18U. S. C. $ 1962(d), in connection with the shooting death ofJoseph Fiorito. He was tried in the United States DistrictCourt for the Southern District of New York. The day be-fore Massaro's trial was to begin, prosecutors learned ofwhat appeared to be a critical piece of evidence: a bullet al-legedly recovered from the car in which the victim's bodywas found. They waited for several days, however, to in-form defense counsel of this development. Not until thetrial was underway and the defense had made its openingstatement did they make this disclosure. After the trialcourt and the defense had been informed of the developmentbut still during the course of trial, defense counsel more thanonce declined the trial court's offer of a continuance so thebullet could be examined. Massaro was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.On direct appeal new counsel for Massaro argued the District Court had erred in admitting the bullet in evidence, buthe did not raise any claim relating to ineffective assistance oftrial counsel. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuitaffirmed the conviction. Judgt. order reported at 57 F. 3d1063 (1995).Massaro later filed a motion under 28 U. S. C. $ 2255, seek-ing to vacate his conviction. As relevant here, he claimedthat his trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance infailing to accept the trial court's offer to grant a continuance.The United States District Court for the Southern Districtof New York found this claim procedurally defaulted becauseMassaro could have raised it on direct appeal.The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.27 Fed. Appx. 26 (1995). The court acknowledged thatineffective-assistance claims usually should be excused fromprocedural-default rules because an attorney who handlesboth trial and appeal is unlikely to raise an ineffective538US2 Unit: $U46 [11-02-04 17:53:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN503Cite as: 538 U. S. 500 (2003)Opinion of the Courtassistance claim against himself. Nevertheless, it adheredto its decision inBilly-Eko v. United States, 8 F. 3d 111(1993). Under Billy-Eko, when the defendant is repre-sented by new counsel on appeal and the ineffectiveassistance claim is based solely on the record made at trial,the claim must be raised on direct appeal; failure to do soresults in procedural default unless the petitioner showscause and prejudice. Finding that Massaro was representedby new counsel on appeal, that his trial counsel's ineffectiveness was evident from the record, and that he had failed toshow cause or prejudice, the Court of Appeals held him procedurally barred from bringing the ineffective-assistanceclaim on collateral review.We granted certiorari. 536 U. S. 990 (2002). Petitionernow urges us to hold that claims of ineffective assistance ofcounsel need not be raised on direct appeal, whether or notthere is new counsel and whether or not the basis for theclaim is apparent from the trial record. The Federal Courtsof Appeals are in conflict on this question, with the SeventhCircuit joining the Second Circuit, see Guinan v. UnitedStates, 6 F. 3d 468 (CA7 1993), and 10 other Federal Courtsof Appeals taking the position that there is no proceduraldefault for failure to raise an ineffective-assistance claim ondirect appeal, see, e. g., United States v. Cofske, 157 F. 3d 1,2 (CA1 1998), cert. denied, 526 U. S. 1059 (1999); UnitedStates v. Jake, 281 F. 3d 123, 132, n. 7 (CA3 2002); UnitedStates v. King, 119 F. 3d 290, 295 (CA4 1997); United Statesv. Rivas, 157 F. 3d 364, 369 (CA5 1998); United States v.Neuhausser, 241 F. 3d 460, 474 (CA6), cert. denied, 534 U. S.879 (2001); United States v. Evans, 272 F. 3d 1069, 1093 (CA82001), cert. denied, 535 U. S. 1029 (2002); United States v.Rewald, 889 F. 2d 836, 859 (CA9 1989), cert. denied, 498 U. S.819 (1990); United States v. Galloway, 56 F. 3d 1239, 1240(CA10 1995) (en banc); United States v. Griffin, 699 F. 2d1102, 1107-1109 (CA11 1983); United States v. Richardson,167 F. 3d 621, 626 (CADC), cert. denied, 528 U. S. 895 (1999).538US2 Unit: $U46 [11-02-04 17:53:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN504 MASSARO v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtWe agree with the majority of the Courts of Appeals, andwe reverse.The background for our discussion is the general rule thatclaims not raised on direct appeal may not be raised on collateral review unless the petitioner shows cause and preju-dice. SeeUnited States v. Frady, 456 U. S. 152, 167-168(1982); Bousley v. United States, 523 U. S. 614, 621-622(1998). The procedural-default rule is neither a statutorynor a constitutional requirement, but it is a doctrine adheredto by the courts to conserve judicial resources and to respectthe law's important interest in the finality of judgments.We conclude that requiring a criminal defendant to bringineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims on direct appeal doesnot promote these objectives.As Judge Easterbrook has noted, "[r]ules of procedureshould be desig ned to induce litigants to present theircontenti ons to the right tribunal at the right time. "Guinan, supra, at 474 (concurring opinion). Applying theusual procedural-default rule to ineffective-assistance claimswould have the opposite effect, creating the risk that defendants would feel compelled to raise the issue before there hasbeen an opportunity fully to develop the factual predicate forthe claim. Furthermore, the issue would be raised for thefirst time in a forum not best suited to assess those facts.This is so even if the record contains some indication ofdeficiencies in counsel's performance. The better-reasonedapproach is to permit ineffective-assistance claims to bebrought in the first instance in a timely motion in the districtcourt under $ 2255. We hold that an ineffective-assistanceof-counsel claim may be brought in a collateral proceedingunder $ 2255, whether or not the petitioner could have raisedthe claim on direct appeal.In light of the way our system has developed, in most casesa motion brought under $ 2255 is preferable to direct appeal for deciding claims of ineffective assistance. When anineffective-assistance claim is brought on direct appeal, ap538US2 Unit: $U46 [11-02-04 17:53:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN505Cite as: 538 U. S. 500 (2003)Opinion of the Courtpellate counsel and the court must proceed on a trial recordnot developed precisely for the object of litigating or preserving the claim and thus often incomplete or inadequatefor this purpose. UnderStrickland v. Washington, 466U. S. 668 (1984), a defendant claiming ineffective counselmust show that counsel's actions were not supported bya reasonable strategy and that the error was prejudicial.The evidence introduced at trial, however, will be devoted toissues of guilt or innocence, and the resulting record in manycases will not disclose the facts necessary to decide eitherprong of theStrickland analysis. If the alleged error isone of commission, the record may reflect the action takenby counsel but not the reasons for it. The appellate courtmay have no way of knowing whether a seemingly unusualor misguided action by counsel had a sound strategic motiveor was taken because the counsel's alternatives were evenworse. See Guinan, supra, at 473 (Easterbrook, J., concurring) ("No matter how odd or deficient trial counsel'sperformance may seem, that lawyer may have had a reasonfor acting as he did. . . . Or it may turn out that counsel'soverall performance was sufficient despite a glaring omission . . ."). The trial record may contain no evidence of alleged errors of omission, much less the reasons underlyingthem. And evidence of alleged conflicts of interest might befound only in attorney-client correspondence or other documents that, in the typical criminal trial, are not introduced.See, e. g., Billy-Eko, supra, at 114. Without additional factual development, moreover, an appellate court may not beable to ascertain whether the alleged error was prejudicial.Under the rule we adopt today, ineffective-assistanceclaims ordinarily will be litigated in the first instance in thedistrict court, the forum best suited to developing the factsnecessary to determining the adequacy of representationduring an entire trial. The court may take testimony fromwitnesses for the defendant and the prosecution and from thecounsel alleged to have rendered the deficient performance.538US2 Unit: $U46 [11-02-04 17:53:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN506 MASSARO v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtSee, e. g., Griffin, 699 F. 2d, at 1109 (In a $ 2255 proceeding,the defendant "has a full opportunity to prove facts establishing ineffectiveness of counsel, the government has a fullopportunity to present evidence to the contrary, the districtcourt hears spoken words we can see only in print and seesexpressions we will never see, and a factual record bearingprecisely on the issue is created"); Beaulieu v. United States,930 F. 2d 805 (CA10 1991) (partially rev'd on other grounds,United States v. Galloway, 56 F. 3d 1239 (CA10 1995). Inaddition, the $ 2255 motion often will be ruled upon by thesame district judge who presided at trial. The judge, having observed the earlier trial, should have an advantageousperspective for determining the effectiveness of counsel'sconduct and whether any deficiencies were prejudicial.The Second Circuit's rule creates inefficiencies for courtsand counsel, both on direct appeal and in the collateral proceeding. On direct appeal it puts counsel into an awkwardposition vis-a` -vis trial counsel. Appellate counsel oftenneed trial counsel's assistance in becoming familiar witha lengthy record on a short deadline, but trial counsel willbe unwilling to help appellate counsel familiarize himselfwith a record for the purpose of understanding how it reflects trial counsel's own incompetence.Subjecting ineffective-assistance claims to the usual causeand-prejudice rule also would create perverse incentivesfor counsel on direct appeal. To ensure that a potentialineffective-assistance claim is not waived--and to avoid incurring a claim of ineffective counsel at the appellate stage--counsel would be pressured to bring claims of ineffectivetrial counsel, regardless of merit.Even meritorious claims would fail when brought on directappeal if the trial record were inadequate to support them.Appellate courts would waste time and resources attemptingto address some claims that were meritless and other claimsthat, though colorable, would be handled more efficiently ifaddressed in the first instance by the district court on col538US2 Unit: $U46 [11-02-04 17:53:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN507Cite as: 538 U. S. 500 (2003)Opinion of the Courtlateral review. See, e. g., United States v. Galloway, supra,at 1241 ("threat of . . . procedural bar has doubtless resultedin many claims being asserted on direct appeal only to pro-tect the record . . . unnecessarily burden[ing] both the parties and the court . . ."). This concern is far from spec-ulative. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, inlight of its rule applying procedural default to ineffectiveassistance claims, has urged counsel to "err on the side ofinclusion on direct appeal,"Billy-Eko, 8 F. 3d, at 116.On collateral review, the Second Circuit's rule would causeadditional inefficiencies. Under that rule a court on collateral review must determine whether appellate counsel is"new." Questions may arise, for example, about whether adefendant has retained new appellate counsel when differentlawyers in the same law office handle trial and appeal. Thehabeas court also must engage in a painstaking review of thetrial record solely to determine if it was sufficient to supportthe ineffectiveness claim and thus whether it should havebeen brought on direct appeal. A clear rule allowing theseclaims to be brought in a proceeding under $ 2255, by contrast, will eliminate these requirements. Although we could"require the parties and the district judges to search for needles in haystacks--to seek out the rare claim that could havebeen raised on direct appeal, and deem it waived," Guinan,6 F. 3d, at 475 (Easterbrook, J., concurring)--we do not seethe wisdom in requiring a court to spend time on exercisesthat, in most instances, will produce no benefit. It is a better use of judicial resources to allow the district court oncollateral review to turn at once to the merits.The most to be said for the rule in the Second Circuit isthat it will speed resolution of some ineffective-assistanceclaims. For the reasons discussed, however, we think fewsuch claims will be capable of resolution on direct appeal andthus few will benefit from earlier resolution. And the benefits of the Second Circuit's rule in those rare instances areoutweighed by the increased judicial burden the rule would538US2 Unit: $U46 [11-02-04 17:53:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN508 MASSARO v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtimpose in many other cases, where a district court on col-lateral review would be forced to conduct the cause-andprejudice analysis before turning to the merits. The SecondCircuit's rule, moreover, does not produce the benefits ofother rules requiring claims to be raised at the earliestopportunity--such as the contemporaneous objection rule--because here, raising the claim on direct appeal does not permit the trial court to avoid the potential error in the firstplace.A growing majority of state courts now follow the rule weadopt today. For example, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania recently changed its position to hold that "a claim raising trial counsel ineffectiveness will no longer be consideredwaived because new counsel on direct appeal did not raise aclaim related to prior counsel's ineffectiveness." Commonwealth v. Grant, 572 Pa. 48, 67, 813 A. 2d 726, 738 (2002); seealso id., at 62-67, and n. 13, 813 A. 2d, at 735-738, and n. 13(cataloging other States' case law adopting this position).Although the Government now urges us to adopt the ruleof the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the Government took the opposite approach in some previous cases, arguing not only that claims of ineffective assistance of counselcould be brought in the first instance in a motion under$ 2255, but that they must be brought in such a motion proceeding and not on direct appeal. See, e. g., United Statesv. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 667, n. 42 (1984). We do not gothis far. We do not hold that ineffective-assistance claimsmust be reserved for collateral review. There may be casesin which trial counsel's ineffectiveness is so apparent fromthe record that appellate counsel will consider it advisable toraise the issue on direct appeal. There may be instances,too, when obvious deficiencies in representation will beaddressed by an appellate court sua sponte. In those cases,certain questions may arise in subsequent proceedings under$ 2255 concerning the conclusiveness of determinations madeon the ineffective-assistance claims raised on direct ap538US2 Unit: $U46 [11-02-04 17:53:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN509Cite as: 538 U. S. 500 (2003)Opinion of the Courtpeal; but these matters of implementation are not before us.We do hold that failure to raise an ineffective-assistanceof-counsel claim on direct appeal does not bar the claimfrom being brought in a later, appropriate proceedi ngunder $ 2255.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, andthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.
