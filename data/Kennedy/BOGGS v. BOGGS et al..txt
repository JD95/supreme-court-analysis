Giventhe pervasive significance of pension plans in the nationaleconomy, the congressional mandate for their uniform andcomprehensive regulation, and the fundamental importanceof community property law in defining the marital partnership in a number of States, the question is of undoubted im-portance. We hold that ERISA pre-empts the state law.IIsaac Boggs worked for South Central Bell from 1949 untilhis retirement in 1985. Isaac and Dorothy, his first wife,were married when he began working for the company, andthey remained husband and wife until Dorothy's death in1979. They had three sons. Within a year of Dorothy'sdeath, Isaac married Sandra, and they remained marrieduntil his death in 1989.Upon retirement, Isaac received various benefits from hisemployer's retirement plans. One was a lump-sum distribu-tion from the Bell System Savings Plan for Salaried Employees (Savings Plan) of $151,628.94, which he rolled over intoan Individual Retirement Account (IRA). He made no withdrawals and the account was worth $180,778.05 when he died.He also received 96 shares of AT&T stock from the BellSouth Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). In addi-tion, Isaac enjoyed a monthly annuity payment during hisretirement of $1,777.67 from the Bell South Service Retire-ment Program.The instant dispute over ownership of the benefits is be-tween Sandra (the surviving wife) and the sons of the firstmarriage. The sons' claim to a portion of the benefits isbased on Dorothy's will. Dorothy bequeathed to Isaac onethird of her estate, and a lifetime usufruct in the remainingtwo-thirds. A lifetime usufruct is the rough equivalent of acommon-law life estate. See La. Civ. Code Ann., Art. 535(West 1980). She bequeathed to her sons the naked owner520US3 Unit: $U64 [09-11-99 18:44:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN837Cite as: 520 U. S. 833 (1997)Opinion of the Courtship in the remaining two-thirds, subject to Isaac's usufruct.All agree that, absent pre-emption, Louisiana law controlsand that under it Dorothy's will would dispose of her commu-nity property interest in Isaac's undistributed pension planbenefits. A Louisiana state court, in a 1980 order entitled"Judgment of Possession," ascribed to Dorothy's estate acommunity property interest in Isaac's Savings Plan accountvalued at the time at $21,194.29.Sandra contests the validity of Dorothy's 1980 testamentary transfer, basing her claim to those benefits on her in-terest under Isaac's will and 29 U. S. C. $ 1055. Isaac bequeathed to Sandra outright certain real property includingthe family home. His will also gave Sandra a lifetime usufruct in the remainder of his estate, with the naked ownership interest being held by the sons. Sandra argues thatthe sons' competing claim, since it is based on Dorothy's 1980purported testamentary transfer of her community propertyinterest in undistributed pension plan benefits, is pre-emptedby ERISA. The Bell South Service Retirement Programmonthly annuity is now paid to Sandra as the survivingspouse.After Isaac's death, two of the sons filed an action in statecourt requesting the appointment of an expert to computethe percentage of the retirement benefits they would be entitled to as a result of Dorothy's attempted testamentarytransfer. They further sought a judgment awarding them aportion of: the IRA; the ESOP shares of AT&T stock; themonthly annuity payments received by Isaac during hisretirement; and Sandra's survivor annuity payments, bothreceived and payable.In response, Sandra Boggs filed a complaint in the UnitedStates District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana,seeking a declaratory judgment that ERISA pre-empts theapplication of Louisiana's community property and succession laws to the extent they recognize the sons' claim to aninterest in the disputed retirement benefits. The District520US3 Unit: $U64 [09-11-99 18:44:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN838 BOGGS v. BOGGSOpinion of the CourtCourt granted summary judgment against Sandra Boggs.849 F. Supp. 462 (1994). It found that, under Louisiana community property law, Dorothy had an ownership interest inher husband's pension plan benefits built up during theirmarriage. The creation of this interest, the court explained,does not violate 29 U. S. C. $ 1056(d)(1), which prohibits pen-sion plan benefits from being "assigned" or "alienated," sinceCongress did not intend to alter traditional familial and sup-port obligations. In the court's view, there was no assignment or alienation because Dorothy's rights in the benefitswere acquired by operation of community property law andnot by transfer from Isaac. Turning to Dorothy's testamentary transfer, the court found it effective because "[ERISA]does not display any particular interest in preserving maximum benefits to any particular beneficiary." 849 F. Supp.,at 465.A divided panel of the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 82 F. 3d 90(1996). The court stressed that Louisiana law affects onlywhat a plan participant may do with his or her benefits afterthey are received and not the relationship between the pension plan administrator and the plan beneficiary. Id., at 96.For the reasons given by the District Court, it foundERISA's pension plan anti-alienation provision, $ 1056(d)(1),inapplicable to Louisiana's creation of Dorothy Boggs' community property interest in the pension plan benefits. Itconcluded that the transfer of the interest from Dorothy toher sons was not a prohibited assignment or alienation, asthis transfer was "two steps removed from the disbursementof benefits." Id., at 97.Six members of the Court of Appeals dissented from thefailure to grant rehearing en banc. 89 F. 3d 1169 (1996). Intheir view, a testamentary transfer of an interest in undistributed retirement benefits frustrates ERISA's goals ofsecuring national uniformity in pension plan administrationand of ensuring that retirees, and their dependents, are theactual recipients of retirement income. They believed that520US3 Unit: $U64 [09-11-99 18:44:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN839Cite as: 520 U. S. 833 (1997)Opinion of the CourtCongress' creation of the qualified domestic relations order(QDRO) mechanism in $ 1056(d)(3), whose requirements werenot met by the 1980 judgment of possession, further sup-ported their position. (A QDRO is a limited exception tothe pension plan anti-alienation provision and allows courtsto recognize a nonparticipant spouse's community propertyinterest in pension plans under specific circumstances.)The reasoning and holding of the Fifth Circuit's decisionis in substantial conflict with the decision of the Court ofAppeals for the Ninth Circuit inAblamis v. Roper, 937 F. 2d1450 (1991), which held that ERISA pre-empts a testamentary transfer by a nonparticipant spouse of her communityproperty interest in undistributed pension plan benefits.The division between the Circuits is significant, for the FifthCircuit has jurisdiction over the community property Statesof Louisiana and Texas, while the Ninth Circuit includes thecommunity property States of Arizona, California, Idaho,Nevada, and Washington. Having granted certiorari to re-solve the issue, 519 U. S. 957 (1996), we now reverse.IIERISA pre-emption questions are recurrent, two othercases on the subject having come before the Court in thecurrent Term alone, see California Div. of Labor StandardsEnforcement v. Dillingham Constr., N. A., Inc., 519 U. S.316 (1997); De Buono v. NYSA-ILA Medical and ClinicalServices Fund, ante, p. 806. In large part the number ofERISA pre-emption cases reflects the comprehensive natureof the statute, the centrality of pension and welfare plans inthe national economy, and their importance to the financialsecurity of the Nation's work force. ERISA is designed toensure the proper administration of pension and welfareplans, both during the years of the employee's active serviceand in his or her retirement years.This case lies at the intersection of ERISA pension lawand state community property law. None can dispute the520US3 Unit: $U64 [09-11-99 18:44:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN840 BOGGS v. BOGGSOpinion of the Courtcentral role community property laws play in the nine com-munity property States. It is more than a property regime.It is a commitment to the equality of husband and wife andreflects the real partnership inherent in the marital relationship. State community property laws, many of ancient lin-eage, "must have continued to exist through such lengths oftime because of their manifold excellences and are not lightlyto be abrogated or tossed aside." 1 W. de Funiak, Principlesof Community Property 11 (1943). The community propertyregime in Louisiana dates from 1808 when the territorial legislature of Orleans drafted a civil code that adopted Spanishprinciples of community property.Id., at 85-89. Louisi-ana's community property laws, and the community propertyregimes enacted in other States, implement policies and val-ues lying within the traditional domain of the States. Theseconsiderations inform our pre-emption analysis. See Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo, 439 U. S. 572, 581 (1979).The nine community property States have some 80 millionresidents, with perhaps $1 trillion in retirement plans. SeeBrief for Estate Planning, Trust and Probate Law Section ofthe State Bar of California as Amicus Curiae 1. This caseinvolves a community property claim, but our ruling will affect as well the right to make claims or assert interests basedon the law of any State, whether or not it recognizes community property. Our ruling must be consistent with the con-gressional scheme to assure the security of plan participantsand their families in every State. In enacting ERISA, Con-gress noted the importance of pension plans in its findingsand declaration of policy, explaining:"[T]he growth in size, scope, and numbers of employeebenefit plans in recent years has been rapid andsubstantial; . . . the continued well-being and security ofmillions of employees and their dependents are directlyaffected by these plans; . . . they are affected with anational public interest [and] they have become an important factor affecting the stability of employment and520US3 Unit: $U64 [09-11-99 18:44:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN841Cite as: 520 U. S. 833 (1997)Opinion of the Courtthe successful development of industrial relations . . . ."29 U. S. C. $ 1001(a).ERISA is an intricate, comprehensive statute. Its federalregulatory scheme governs employee benefit plans, whichinclude both pension and welfare plans. All employee bene-fit plans must conform to various reporting, disclosure, andfiduciary requirements, see $$ 1021-1031, 1101-1114, whilepension plans must also comply with participation, vesting,and funding requirements, see $$ 1051-1086. The survivingspouse annuity and QDRO provisions, central to the disputehere, are part of the statute's mandatory participation andvesting requirements. These provisions provide detailedprotections to spouses of plan participants which, in somecases, exceed what their rights would be were communityproperty law the sole measure.ERISA's express pre-emption clause states that the Act"shall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they maynow or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan . . . ."$ 1144(a). We can begin, and in this case end, the analysisby simply asking if state law conflicts with the provisions ofERISA or operates to frustrate its objects. We hold thatthere is a conflict, which suffices to resolve the case. Weneed not inquire whether the statutory phrase "relate to"provides further and additional support for the pre-emptionclaim. Nor need we consider the applicability of field pre-emption, seeFidelity Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. De laCuesta, 458 U. S. 141, 153 (1982).We first address the survivor's annuity and then turn tothe other pension benefits.IIISandra Boggs, as we have observed, asserts that federallaw pre-empts and supersedes state law and requires thesurviving spouse annuity to be paid to her as the sole beneficiary. We agree.520US3 Unit: $U64 [09-11-99 18:44:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN842 BOGGS v. BOGGSOpinion of the CourtThe annuity at issue is a qualified joint and survivor annuity mandated by ERISA. Section 1055(a) provides:"Each pension plan to which this section applies shallprovide that--"(1) in the case of a vested participant who does notdie before the annuity starting date, the accrued benefitpayable to such participant shall be provided in the formof a qualified joint and survivor annuity."ERISA requires that every qualified joint and survivor annuity include an annuity payable to a nonparticipant surviving spouse. The survivor's annuity may not be less than50% of the amount of the annuity which is payable duringthe joint lives of the participant and spouse. $ 1055(d)(1).Provision of the survivor's annuity may not be waived by theparticipant, absent certain limited circumstances, unless thespouse consents in writing to the designation of another beneficiary, which designation also cannot be changed withoutfurther spousal consent, witnessed by a plan representativeor notary public. $ 1055(c)(2). Sandra Boggs, as the surviving spouse, is entitled to a survivor's annuity under theseprovisions. She has not waived her right to the survivor'sannuity, let alone consented to having the sons designated asthe beneficiaries.Respondents say their state-law claims are consistent withthese provisions. Their claims, they argue, affect only thedisposition of plan proceeds after they have been disbursedby the Bell South Service Retirement Program, and thusnothing is required of the plan. ERISA's concern for securing national uniformity in the administration of employeebenefit plans, in their view, is not implicated. They argueSandra's community property obligations, after she receivesthe survivor annuity payments, "fai[l] to implicate the regulatory concerns of ERISA." Fort Halifax Packing Co. v.Coyne, 482 U. S. 1, 15 (1987).520US3 Unit: $U64 [09-11-99 18:44:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN843Cite as: 520 U. S. 833 (1997)Opinion of the CourtWe disagree. The statutory object of the qualified jointand survivor annuity provisions, along with the rest of$ 1055, is to ensure a stream of income to surviving spouses.Section 1055 mandates a survivor's annuity not only wherea participant dies after the annuity starting date but alsoguarantees one if the participant dies before then. See$$ 1055(a)(2), (e). These provisions, enacted as part of theRetirement Equity Act of 1984 (REA), Pub. L. 98-397, 98Stat. 1426, enlarged ERISA's protection of surviving spousesin significant respects. Before REA, ERISA only requiredthat pension plans, if they provided for the payment of benefits in the form of an annuity, offer a qualified joint and survivor annuity as an option entirely within a participant's discretion. 29 U. S. C. $$ 1055(a), (e) (1982 ed.). REA modifiedERISA to permit participants to designate a beneficiary forthe survivor's annuity, other than the nonparticipant spouse,only when the spouse agrees. $ 1055(c)(2). Congress' concern for surviving spouses is also evident from the expansivecoverage of $ 1055, as amended by REA. Section 1055's requirements, as a general matter, apply to all "individual account plans" and "defined benefit plans." $ 1055(b)(1). Theterms are defined, for $ 1055 purposes, so that all pensionplans fall within those two categories. See $ 1002(35).While some individual account plans escape $ 1055's surviving spouse annuity requirements under certain conditions,Congress still protects the interests of the surviving spouseby requiring those plans to pay the spouse the nonforfeitableaccrued benefits, reduced by certain security interests, in alump-sum payment. $ 1055(b)(1)(C).ERISA's solicitude for the economic security of survivingspouses would be undermined by allowing a predeceasingspouse's heirs and legatees to have a community propertyinterest in the survivor's annuity. Even a plan participantcannot defeat a nonparticipant surviving spouse's statutoryentitlement to an annuity. It would be odd, to say the least,if Congress permitted a predeceasing nonparticipant spouse520US3 Unit: $U64 [09-11-99 18:44:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN844 BOGGS v. BOGGSOpinion of the Courtto do so. Nothing in the language of ERISA supports con-cluding that Congress made such an inexplicable decision.Testamentary transfers could reduce a surviving spouse'sguaranteed annuity below the minimum set by ERISA (defined as 50% of the annuity payable during the joint lives ofthe participant and spouse). In this case, Sandra's annuitywould be reduced by approximately 20%, according to thecalculations contained in the sons' state-court filings. Thereis no reason why testamentary transfers could not reduce asurvivor's annuity by an even greater amount. Perhapseven more troubling, the recipient of the testamentary trans-fer need not be a family member. For instance, a surviving spouse's $ 1055 annuity might be substantially reducedso that funds could be diverted to support an unrelatedstranger.In the face of this direct clash between state law and theprovisions and objectives of ERISA, the state law cannotstand. Conventional conflict pre-emption principles requirepre-emption "where compliance with both federal and stateregulations is a physical impossibility, . . . or where state lawstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and executionof the full purposes and objectives of Congress."Gade v.National Solid Wastes Management Assn., 505 U. S. 88, 98(1992) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Itwould undermine the purpose of ERISA's mandated survivor's annuity to allow Dorothy, the predeceasing spouse, byher testamentary transfer to defeat in part Sandra's entitlement to the annuity $ 1055 guarantees her as the survivingspouse. This cannot be. States are not free to changeERISA's structure and balance.Louisiana law, to the extent it provides the sons with aright to a portion of Sandra Boggs' $ 1055 survivor's annuity,is pre-empted.IVBeyond seeking a portion of the survivor's annuity, re-spondents claim a percentage of: the monthly annuity pay520US3 Unit: $U64 [09-11-99 18:44:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN845Cite as: 520 U. S. 833 (1997)Opinion of the Courtments made to Isaac Boggs during his retirement; the IRA;and the ESOP shares of AT&T stock. As before, the claimis based on Dorothy Boggs' attempted testamentary transferto the sons of her community property interest in Isaac'sundistributed pension plan benefits. Respondents arguefurther--and somewhat inconsistently--that their claimagain concerns only what a plan participant or beneficiarymay do once plan funds are distributed, without imposingany obligations on the plan itself. Both parties agree thatthe ERISA benefits at issue here were paid after Dorothy'sdeath, and thus this case does not present the questionwhether ERISA would permit a nonparticipant spouse to obtain a devisable community property interest in benefits paidout during the existence of the community between the participant and that spouse.A brief overview of ERISA's design is necessary to putrespondents' contentions in the proper context. The principal object of the statute is to protect plan participants andbeneficiaries. See Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S.85, 90 (1983) ("ERISA is a comprehensive statute designedto promote the interests of employees and their beneficiariesin employee benefit plans"). Section 1001(b) states that thepolicy of ERISA is "to protect . . . the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries."Section 1001(c) explains that ERISA contains certain safeguards and protections which help guarantee the "equitablecharacter and the soundness of [private pension] plans" inorder to protect "the interests of participants in private pension plans and their beneficiaries." The general policy is implemented by ERISA's specific provisions. Apart from afew enumerated exceptions, a plan fiduciary must "dischargehis duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of theparticipants and beneficiaries." $ 1104(a)(1). The assets ofa plan, again with certain exceptions, are "held for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to participants in the planand their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of520US3 Unit: $U64 [09-11-99 18:44:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN846 BOGGS v. BOGGSOpinion of the Courtadministering the plan." $ 1103(c)(1). The Secretary ofLabor has authority to create exemptions to ERISA's prohibition on certain plan holdings, acquisitions, and transac-tions, but only if doing so is in the interests of the plan's"participants and beneficiaries." $ 1108(a)(2). Persons withan interest in a pension plan may bring a civil suit underERISA's enforcement provisions only if they are either aparticipant or beneficiary. Section 1132(a)(1)(B), for in-stance, provides that a civil action may be brought "by aparticipant or beneficiary . . . to recover benefits due to himunder the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under theterms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefitsunder the terms of the plan."ERISA confers beneficiary status on a nonparticipantspouse or dependent in only narrow circumstances delineated by its provisions. For example, as we have discussed,$ 1055(a) requires provision of a surviving spouse annuity incovered pension plans, and, as a consequence, the spouse is abeneficiary to this extent. Section 1056's QDRO provisionslikewise recognize certain pension plan community propertyinterests of nonparticipant spouses and dependents. AQDRO is a type of domestic relations order that creates orrecognizes an alternate payee's right to, or assigns to an alternate payee the right to, a portion of the benefits payablewith respect to a participant under a plan. $ 1056(d)(3)(B)(i).A domestic relations order, in turn, is any judgment, decree,or order that concerns "the provision of child support,alimony payments, or marital property rights to a spouse,former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant"and is "made pursuant to a State domestic relations law (including a community property law)." $ 1056(d)(3)(B)(ii). Adomestic relations order must meet certain requirementsto qualify as a QDRO. See $$ 1056(d)(3)(C)-(E). QDRO's,unlike domestic relations orders in general, are exemptfrom both the pension plan anti-alienation provision,$ 1056(d)(3)(A), and ERISA's general pre-emption clause,520US3 Unit: $U64 [09-11-99 18:44:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN847Cite as: 520 U. S. 833 (1997)Opinion of the Court$ 1144(b)(7). In creating the QDRO mechanism Congresswas careful to provide that the alternate payee, the "spouse,former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant,"is to be considered a plan beneficiary. $$ 1056(d)(3)(K), (J).These provisions are essential to one of REA's central purposes, which is to give enhanced protection to the spouse anddependent children in the event of divorce or separation, andin the event of death the surviving spouse. Apart fromthese detailed provisions, ERISA does not confer beneficiarystatus on nonparticipants by reason of their marital or de-pendent status.Even outside the pension plan context and its antialienation restriction, Congress deemed it necessary to enactdetailed provisions in order to protect a dependent's interestin a welfare benefit plan. Through a $ 1169 "qualified medical child support order" a child's interest in his or her parent's group health care plan can be enforced. A "medicalchild support order" is defined as any judgment, decree, ororder that concerns the provision of child support "made pursuant to a State domestic relations law (including a community property law) and relates to benefits under such plan."$ 1169(a)(2)(B)(i). As with a QDRO, a "medical child supportorder" must satisfy certain criteria in order to qualify. See$$ 1169(a)(3)-(4). In accordance with ERISA's care in conforming entitlements to benefits with participant or beneficiary status, the statute treats a child subject to such a qualifying order as a participant for ERISA's reporting anddisclosure requirements and as a beneficiary for other purposes. $ 1169(a)(7).The surviving spouse annuity and QDRO provisions,which acknowledge and protect specific pension plan community property interests, give rise to the strong implicationthat other community property claims are not consistentwith the statutory scheme. ERISA's silence with respect tothe right of a nonparticipant spouse to control pension planbenefits by testamentary transfer provides powerful support520US3 Unit: $U64 [09-11-99 18:44:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN848 BOGGS v. BOGGSOpinion of the Courtfor the conclusion that the right does not exist. Cf. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U. S. 134, 147-148(1985). It should cause little surprise that Congress choseto protect the community property interests of separatedand divorced spouses and their children, a traditional subjectof domestic relations law, but not to accommodate testamen-tary transfers of pension plan benefits. As a general matter,"[t]he whole subject of the domestic relations of husband andwife, parent and child, belongs to the laws of the States andnot to the laws of the United States." In re Burrus, 136U. S. 586, 593-594 (1890). Support obligations, in particular,are "deeply rooted moral responsibilities" that Congress isunlikely to have intended to intrude upon. See Rose v.Rose, 481 U. S. 619, 632 (1987); see also id., at 636-640(O'Connor, J., concurring). In accord with these principles,Congress ensured that state domestic relations orders, aslong as they meet certain statutory requirements, are notpre-empted.We conclude the sons have no claim under ERISA to ashare of the retirement benefits. To begin with, the sonsare neither participants nor beneficiaries. A "participant"is defined as an "employee or former employee of an employer, or any member or former member of an employeeorganization, who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit." $ 1002(7). A "beneficiary" is a "person designated bya participant, or by the terms of an employee benefit plan,who is or may become entitled to a benefit thereunder."$ 1002(8). Respondents' claims are based on Dorothy Boggs'attempted testamentary transfer, not on a designation byIsaac Boggs or under the terms of the retirement plans.They do not even attempt to argue that they are beneficiaries by virtue of the judgment of possession qualifying as aQDRO.An amicus, the Estate Planning, Trust and Probate LawSection of the State Bar of California, in support of respondents' position, points to pre-REA case law holding that520US3 Unit: $U64 [09-11-99 18:44:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN849Cite as: 520 U. S. 833 (1997)Opinion of the CourtERISA does not pre-empt spousal community property in-terests in pension benefits, regardless of who is the plan participant or beneficiary. As did the District Court below, theamicus relies in particular upon In re Marriage of Campa,89 Cal. App. 3d 113, 152 Cal. Rptr. 362 (1979), in which theCalifornia Court of Appeal for the First District held thatERISA does not bar California courts from joining pensionfunds in marriage dissolution proceedings and ordering thepension plan to divide pension payments between the employee and his or her former nonparticipant spouse. We dis-missed the pension plan's appeal for want of a substantialfederal question, 444 U. S. 1028 (1980), and, although notentitled to full precedential weight, see Edelman v. Jordan,415 U. S. 651, 670-671 (1974), that disposition constitutes adecision on the merits, see Hicks v. Miranda, 422 U. S. 332,344 (1975). The state court in Marriage of Campa was notalone in refusing to find ERISA pre-emption in the divorcecontext. See, e. g., Stone v. Stone, 450 F. Supp. 919 (ND Cal.1978), aff 'd, 632 F. 2d 740 (CA9 1980), cert. denied, 453 U. S.922 (1981); Savings and Profit Sharing Fund of Sears Employees v. Gago, 717 F. 2d 1038 (CA7 1983); Eichelberger v.Eichelberger, 584 F. Supp. 899 (SD Tex. 1984). This judicialconsensus, amicus argues, was codified by the QDRO provisions which were contained in the 1984 REA amendments.The amicus contends that since REA, or the pre-REA caselaw which it allegedly adopted, did not consider the community property rights of a nonparticipant spouse in the testamentary context, it should not be construed to pre-emptstate law governing this different subject.We disagree with this reasoning. It is true that the subject of testamentary transfers is somewhat removed fromdomestic relations law. The QDRO provisions address therights of divorced and separated spouses, and their dependent children, which are the traditional concern of domesticrelations law. The pre-REA federal common-law extensionof $ 1002(8)'s definition of "beneficiary" by courts in the con520US3 Unit: $U64 [09-11-99 18:44:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN850 BOGGS v. BOGGSOpinion of the Courttext of marital dissolution was in part based on an apprecia-tion of the fact that domestic relations law is primarily anarea of state concern, see Marriage of Campa, supra, at 124,152 Cal. Rptr., at 367-368, and the basic principle that a beneficiary's interest in a spendthrift trust, despite otherwiseapplicable protections, can be reached in the context of di-vorce and separation. See E. Griswold, Spendthrift Trusts389-391 (2d ed. 1947) (summarizing state case law); Restate-ment (Second) of Trusts $ 157 (1959). The state court inMarriage of Campa took its implicit determination that thenonparticipant spouse was a beneficiary to its logical conclusion, forcing the pension plan to join the marital dissolutionproceedings as a party and compelling it to pay the spouseher share of the pension benefits. Whether or not this extension of the definition of "beneficiary" was consistent withthe statute then in force, these authorities are not applicablein light of the REA amendments. The QDRO and the surviving spouse annuity provisions define the scope of a nonparticipant spouse's community property interests in pensionplans consistent with ERISA.Respondents and their amicus in effect ask us to ignore$ 1002(8)'s definition of "beneficiary" and, through case law,create a new class of persons for whom plan assets are to beheld and administered. The statute is not amenable to thissweeping extratextual extension. It is unpersuasive tosuggest that third parties could assert their claims without being counted as "beneficiaries." A plan fiduciary'sresponsibilities run only to participants and beneficiaries.$ 1104(a)(1). Assets of a plan are held for the exclusivepurposes of providing benefits to participants and beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administration.$ 1103(c)(1). Reading ERISA to permit nonbeneficiary interests, even if not enforced against the plan, would resultin troubling anomalies. Either pension plans would be runfor the benefit of only a subset of those who have a stake inthe plan or state law would have to move in to fill the appar520US3 Unit: $U64 [09-11-99 18:44:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN851Cite as: 520 U. S. 833 (1997)Opinion of the Courtent gaps between plan administration responsibilities andownership rights, resulting in a complex set of requirementsvarying from State to State. Neither result accords withthe statutory scheme.The conclusion that Congress intended to pre-empt respondents' nonbeneficiary, nonparticipant interests in theretirement plans is given specific and powerful reinforcement by the pension plan anti-alienation provision. Section1056(d)(1) provides that "[e]ach pension plan shall providethat benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned oralienated." Statutory anti-alienation provisions are potentmechanisms to prevent the dissipation of funds. In Hisquierdo we interpreted an anti-alienation provision to bar adivorced spouse's interest in her husband's retirement benefits. See 439 U. S., at 583-590. ERISA's pension plan antialienation provision is mandatory and contains only two explicit exceptions, see $$ 1056(d)(2), (d)(3)(A), which are notsubject to judicial expansion. See Guidry v. Sheet MetalWorkers Nat. Pension Fund, 493 U. S. 365, 376 (1990). Theanti-alienation provision can "be seen to bespeak a pensionlaw protective policy of special intensity: Retirement fundsshall remain inviolate until retirement." J. Langbein & B.Wolk, Pension and Employee Benefit Law 547 (2d ed. 1995).Dorothy's 1980 testamentary transfer, which is the sourceof respondents' claimed ownership interest, is a prohibited"assignment or alienation." An "assignment or alienation"has been defined by regulation, with certain exceptions notat issue here, as "[a]ny direct or indirect arrangementwhereby a party acquires from a participant or beneficiary"an interest enforceable against a plan to "all or any partof a plan benefit payment which is, or may become, payable to the participant or beneficiary." 26 CFR $ 1.401(a)-13(c)(1)(ii) (1997). Those requirements are met. UnderLouisiana law community property interests are enforceableagainst a plan. See Eskine v. Eskine, 518 So. 2d 505, 508(La. 1988). If respondents' claims were allowed to succeed520US3 Unit: $U64 [09-11-99 18:44:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN852 BOGGS v. BOGGSOpinion of the Courtthey would have acquired, as of 1980, an interest in Isaac'spension plan at the expense of plan participants andbeneficiaries.As was true with survivors' annuities, it would be inimicalto ERISA's purposes to permit testamentary recipients toacquire a competing interest in undistributed pension bene-fits, which are intended to provide a stream of income toparticipants and their beneficiaries. See Guidry, supra, at376 ("[The anti-alienation provision] reflects a consideredcongressional policy choice, a decision to safeguard a streamof income for pensioners . . . and their dependents . . .").Pension benefits support participants and beneficiaries intheir retirement years, and ERISA's pension plan safeguardsare designed to further this end. See $ 1001(c). Besidesthe anti-alienation provision, Congress has enacted otherprotective measures to guarantee that retirement funds arethere when a plan's participants and beneficiaries expectthem. There are, for instance, minimum funding standardsfor pension plans and a pension plan termination insuranceprogram which guarantees benefits in the event a plan isterminated before being fully funded. See $$ 1082, 1301-1461. Under respondents' approach, retirees could findtheir retirement benefits reduced by substantial sums because they have been diverted to testamentary recipients.Retirement benefits and the income stream provided for byERISA-regulated plans would be disrupted in the name ofprotecting a nonparticipant spouses' successors over planparticipants and beneficiaries. Respondents' logic wouldeven permit a spouse to transfer an interest in a pensionplan to creditors, a result incompatible with a spendthriftprovision such as $ 1056(d)(1).Community property laws have, in the past, been preempted in order to ensure the implementation of a federalstatutory scheme. See, e. g., McCune v. Essig, 199 U. S. 382(1905); Wissner v. Wissner, 338 U. S. 655 (1950); Free v.Bland, 369 U. S. 663 (1962); Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo, 439520US3 Unit: $U64 [09-11-99 18:44:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN853Cite as: 520 U. S. 833 (1997)Opinion of the CourtU. S. 572 (1979); McCarty v. McCarty, 453 U. S. 210 (1981);Mansell v. Mansell, 490 U. S. 581 (1989); cf. Ridgway v.Ridgway, 454 U. S. 46 (1981). Free v. Bland, supra, is ofparticular relevance here. A husband had purchased UnitedStates savings bonds with community funds in the name ofboth spouses. Under Treasury regulations then in effect,when a co-owner of the bonds died, the surviving co-ownerreceived the entire interest in the bonds. After the wifedied, her son--the principal beneficiary of her will--demanded either one-half of the bonds or reimbursement forloss of the community property interest. The Court heldthat the regulations pre-empted the community propertyclaim, explaining:"One of the inducements selected by the Treasury is thesurvivorship provision, a convenient method of avoiding complicated probate proceedings. Notwithstandingthis provision, the State awarded full title to the coowner but required him to account for half of the valueof the bonds to the decedent's estate. Viewed realisti-cally, the State has rendered the award of title meaningless." Id., at 669.The same reasoning applies here. If state law is not pre-empted, the diversion of retirement benefits will occurregardless of whether the interest in the pension plan is enforced against the plan or the recipient of the pension benefit.The obligation to provide an accounting, moreover, as withthe probate proceedings referred to in Free, is itself a burdenof significant proportions. Under respondents' view, a pension plan participant could be forced to make an accountingof a deceased spouse's community property interest yearsafter the date of death. If the couple had lived in severalStates, the accounting could entail complex, expensive, andtime-consuming litigation. Congress could not have intended that pension benefits from pension plans would begiven to accountants and attorneys for this purpose.520US3 Unit: $U64 [09-11-99 18:44:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN854 BOGGS v. BOGGSBreyer, J., dissentingRespondents contend it is anomalous and unfair that a di-vorced spouse, as a result of a QDRO, will have more controlover a portion of his or her spouse's pension benefits thana predeceasing spouse. Congress thought otherwise. TheQDRO provisions, as well as the surviving spouse annuityprovisions, reinforce the conclusion that ERISA is concernedwith providing for the living. The QDRO provisions protectthose persons who, often as a result of divorce, might notreceive the benefits they otherwise would have had availableduring their retirement as a means of income. In the caseof a predeceased spouse, this concern is not implicated. Thefairness of the distinction might be debated, but Congresshas decided to favor the living over the dead and we mustrespect its policy.The axis around which ERISA's protections revolve is theconcepts of participant and beneficiary. When Congress haschosen to depart from this framework, it has done so in acareful and limited manner. Respondents' claims, if allowedto succeed, would depart from this framework, upsetting thedeliberate balance central to ERISA. It does not matterthat respondents have sought to enforce their rights onlyafter the retirement benefits have been distributed sincetheir asserted rights are based on the theory that they hadan interest in the undistributed pension plan benefits. Theirstate-law claims are pre-empted. The judgment of the FifthCircuit is
