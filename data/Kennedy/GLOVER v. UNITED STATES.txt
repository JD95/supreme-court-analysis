The issue presented rests upon the initial assumption,which we accept for analytic purposes, that the trial court*David M. Zlotnick, Peter Goldberger, and Kyle O'Dowd filed a brieffor the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. as amicicuriae urging reversal.531US1 Unit: $U11 [04-13-02 15:12:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN200 GLOVER v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courterred in a Sentencing Guidelines determination after peti-tioner's conviction of a federal offense. The legal error,petitioner alleges, increased his prison sentence by at least6 months and perhaps by 21 months. We must decidewhether this would be "prejudice" under Strickland v.Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). The Government is notready to concede error in the sentencing determination butnow acknowledges that if an increased prison term did flowfrom an error the petitioner has established Strickland prej-udice. In agreement with the Government and petitioner onthis point, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.IIn the 1980's and early 1990's, petitioner Paul Glover wasthe Vice President and General Counsel of the Chicago TruckDrivers, Helpers, and Warehouse Workers Union (Independ-ent). The evidence showed Glover used his control over theunion's investments to enrich himself and his co-conspiratorsthrough kickbacks. When the malfeasance was discovered,he was tried in the United States District Court for theNorthern District of Illinois. His first trial ended when thejury could not agree, but a second jury convicted him. Thepresentence investigation report prepared by the probationoffice recommended that the convictions for labor racketeer-ing, money laundering, and tax evasion be grouped togetherunder United States Sentencing Commission, GuidelinesManual $ 3D1.2 (Nov. 1994), which allows the grouping of"counts involving substantially the same harm." The Gov-ernment, insisting that the money laundering counts couldnot be grouped with the other counts, objected to that rec-ommendation, and the District Court held a hearing on thematter. The money laundering counts, it ruled, should notbe grouped with Glover's other offenses. The ruling, as thetrial court viewed it, was in conformance with decisions inthose Courts of Appeals which had refused to group moneylaundering counts with other counts for various reasons.531US1 Unit: $U11 [04-13-02 15:12:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN201Cite as: 531 U. S. 198 (2001)Opinion of the CourtSee, e. g., United States v. Lombardi, 5 F. 3d 568 (CA1 1993);United States v. Porter, 909 F. 2d 789 (CA4 1990); UnitedStates v. Taylor, 984 F. 2d 298 (CA9 1993); United States v.Johnson, 971 F. 2d 562 (CA10 1992); United States v. Harper,972 F. 2d 321 (CA11 1992). In the trial court, Glover's attor-neys did not submit papers or offer extensive oral argumentscontesting the no-grouping argument advanced by the Government. When the District Court decided not to group themoney laundering counts with the other counts, Glover'soffense level was increased by two levels, yielding a con-comitant increase in the sentencing range. Glover wassentenced to 84 months in prison, which was in the middleof the Guidelines range of 78 to 97 months.On appeal to the Seventh Circuit, Glover's counsel (thesame attorneys who represented him in District Court) didnot raise the grouping issue; instead, they concentrated onclaims that certain testimony from his first trial should nothave been admitted at his second trial and that he shouldnot have been assessed a two-level increase for perjury athis first trial. A short time after argument on Glover's appeal, a different panel of the Seventh Circuit held that, undersome circumstances, grouping of money laundering offenseswith other counts was proper under $ 3D1.2. United Statesv. Wilson, 98 F. 3d 281 (1996). A month and a half later,the Seventh Circuit rejected both of Glover's arguments andaffirmed his conviction and sentence. 101 F. 3d 1183 (1996).Glover filed a pro se motion to correct his sentence under28 U. S. C. $ 2255 (1994 ed., Supp. III). The failure of hiscounsel to press the grouping issue, he argued, was ineffective assistance, a position confirmed, in his view, by theCourt of Appeals' decision in Wilson. The performance ofcounsel, he contended, fell below a reasonable standard bothat sentencing, when his attorneys did not with any clarity orforce contest the Government's argument, and on appeal,when they did not present the issue in their briefs or call theWilson decision to the panel's attention following the oral531US1 Unit: $U11 [04-13-02 15:12:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN202 GLOVER v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtargument. He further argued that absent the ineffective as-sistance, his offense level would have been two levels lower,yielding a Guidelines sentencing range of 63 to 78 months.Under this theory, the 84-month sentence he received wasan unlawful increase of anywhere between 6 and 21 months.The District Court denied Glover's motion, determiningthat under Seventh Circuit precedent an increase of 6 to 21months in a defendant's sentence was not significant enoughto amount to prejudice for purposes of Strickland v. Washington, supra. As a result, the District Court did not decidethe issue whether the performance of Glover's counsel fellbelow a reasonable standard of competence. On appealto the Seventh Circuit, the Government argued only thatGlover had not suffered prejudice within the meaning ofStrickland. See App. to Reply Brief for Petitioner 1a-22a.Citing Durrive v. United States, 4 F. 3d 548 (CA7 1993), theGovernment contended that even were the performance ofGlover's counsel ineffective, the resulting additional 6 to 21months, under the law as established in the Seventh Circuit,would not constitute prejudice. App. to Reply Brief forPetitioner 21a. The Court of Appeals affirmed, relyingon that theory. 182 F. 3d 921 (1999) (table). We grantedGlover's petition for certiorari. 530 U. S. 1261 (2000).IIThe Government no longer puts forth the proposition thata 6- to 21-month prison term increase is not prejudice underStrickland. It now acknowledges that such a rule, withoutmore, would be "inconsistent with this Court's cases and unworkable." Brief for United States 18.It appears the Seventh Circuit drew the substance of itsno-prejudice rule from our opinion in Lockhart v. Fretwell,506 U. S. 364 (1993).Lockhart holds that in some circum-stances a mere difference in outcome will not suffice to establish prejudice. Id., at 369. The Seventh Circuit extractedfrom this holding the rule at issue here, which denies relief531US1 Unit: $U11 [04-13-02 15:12:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN203Cite as: 531 U. S. 198 (2001)Opinion of the Courtwhen the increase in sentence is said to be not so significantas to render the outcome of sentencing unreliable or fundamentally unfair. See Durrive, supra, at 550-551. TheCourt explained last Term that our holding inLockhart doesnot supplant the Strickland analysis. See Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 393 (2000) ("Cases such as Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U. S. 157 (1986), and Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U. S.364 (1993), do not justify a departure from a straightforwardapplication ofStrickland when the ineffectiveness of counseldoes deprive the defendant of a substantive or proceduralright to which the law entitles him");id., at 414 (opinion ofO'Connor, J.) ("As I explained in my concurring opinion in[Lockhart], `in the vast majority of cases . . . [t]he determinative question--whether there is "a reasonable probabilitythat, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result ofthe proceeding would have been different"--remains unchanged' "). The Seventh Circuit was incorrect to rely onLockhart to deny relief to persons attacking their sentencewho might show deficient performance in counsel's failure toobject to an error of law affecting the calculation of a sentence because the sentence increase does not meet somebaseline standard of prejudice. Authority does not suggestthat a minimal amount of additional time in prison cannotconstitute prejudice. Quite to the contrary, our jurisprudence suggests that any amount of actual jail time has SixthAmendment significance. Compare Argersinger v. Hamlin,407 U. S. 25 (1972) (holding that the assistance of counselmust be provided when a defendant is tried for a crime thatresults in a sentence of imprisonment), with Scott v. Illinois,440 U. S. 367 (1979) (holding that a criminal defendant hasno Sixth Amendment right to counsel when his trial does notresult in a sentence of imprisonment). Our decisions on theright to jury trial in a criminal case do not suggest that thereis no prejudice in the circumstances here. Those cases havelimited the right to jury trial to offenses where the potentialpunishment was imprisonment for six months or more. See531US1 Unit: $U11 [04-13-02 15:12:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN204 GLOVER v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtArgersinger, supra, at 29 (citing Duncan v. Louisiana, 391U. S. 145 (1968)). But they do not control the questionwhether a showing of prejudice, in the context of a claim forineffective assistance of counsel, requires a significant increase in a term of imprisonment.The Seventh Circuit's rule is not well considered in anyevent, because there is no obvious dividing line by which tomeasure how much longer a sentence must be for the in-crease to constitute substantial prejudice. Indeed, it is noteven clear if the relevant increase is to be measured in abso-lute terms or by some fraction of the total authorized sentence. See Martin v. United States, 109 F. 3d 1177, 1183(CA7 1996) (Rovner, J., dissenting from denial of rehearingen banc). Although the amount by which a defendant's sentence is increased by a particular decision may be a factorto consider in determining whether counsel's performance infailing to argue the point constitutes ineffective assistance,under a determinate system of constrained discretion suchas the Sentencing Guidelines it cannot serve as a bar to ashowing of prejudice. Compare Spriggs v. Collins, 993 F. 2d85, 88 (CA5 1993) (requiring a showing that a sentence wouldhave been "significantly less harsh" under the Texas discretionary sentencing scheme), with United States v. Phillips,210 F. 3d 345 (CA5 2000) (finding prejudice under the Sentencing Guidelines when an error by counsel led to an increased sentence). We hold that the Seventh Circuit erredin engrafting this additional requirement onto the prejudicebranch of the Strickland test. This is not a case where trialstrategies, in retrospect, might be criticized for leading to aharsher sentence. Here we consider the sentencing calculation itself, a calculation resulting from a ruling which, if ithad been error, would have been correctable on appeal. Weexpress no opinion on the ultimate merits of Glover's claimbecause the question of deficient performance is not beforeus, but it is clear that prejudice flowed from the assertederror in sentencing.531US1 Unit: $U11 [04-13-02 15:12:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN205Cite as: 531 U. S. 198 (2001)Opinion of the CourtIIIThe Government makes various arguments for alternativegrounds to affirm the Court of Appeals. Among other contentions, the Government suggests that the failure of Glov-er's counsel to argue for grouping of the money launderingcounts was not deficient; that Glover's grouping claim has nolegal merit in any event; and that even if Glover had prevailed on his grouping claim, his sentence in fact would haveincreased as a result. Glover disputes these contentions.We need not describe the arguments in great detail, becausedespite the fact the parties have joined issue at least in parton these points, they were neither raised in nor passed uponby the Court of Appeals. In the ordinary course we do notdecide questions neither raised nor resolved below. SeeTaylor v. Freeland & Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 646 (1992). Asa general rule, furthermore, we do not decide issues outsidethe questions presented by the petition for certiorari. ThisCourt's Rule 14.1(a). Whether these issues remain open,and if so whether they have merit, are questions for theCourt of Appeals or the District Court to consider and deter-mine in the first instance.The judgment of the Seventh Circuit is reversed. Thecase is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.
