This case stems from a market struggle that erupted inthe domestic cigarette industry in the mid-1980's. Petitioner Brooke Group Ltd., whom we, like the parties to thecase, refer to as Liggett because of its former corporatename, charges that to counter its innovative development ofgeneric cigarettes, respondent Brown & Williamson TobaccoCorporation introduced its own line of generic cigarettes inan unlawful effort to stifle price competition in the economysegment of the national cigarette market. Liggett contendsthat Brown & Williamson cut prices on generic cigarettesbelow cost and offered discriminatory volume rebates towholesalers to force Liggett to raise its own generic cigarette prices and introduce oligopoly pricing in the economysegment. We hold that Brown & Williamson is entitled tojudgment as a matter of law.IIn 1980, Liggett pioneered the development of the econ-omy segment of the national cigarette market by introducinga line of "black and white" generic cigarettes. The economysegment of the market, sometimes called the generic segment, is characterized by its bargain prices and comprises avariety of different products: black and whites, which aretrue generics sold in plain white packages with simple blacklettering describing their contents; private label generics,which carry the trade dress of a specific purchaser, usually aretail chain; branded generics, which carry a brand name butwhich, like black and whites and private label generics, aresold at a deep discount and with little or no advertising; and"Value-25s," packages of 25 cigarettes that are sold to theconsumer some 12.5% below the cost of a normal 20-cigarettepack. By 1984, when Brown & Williamson entered the ge-neric segment and set in motion the series of events givingrise to this suit, Liggett's black and whites represented 97%of the generic segment, which in turn accounted for a little509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT213Cite as: 509 U. S. 209 (1993)Opinion of the Courtmore than 4% of domestic cigarette sales. Prior to Liggett'sintroduction of black and whites in 1980, sales of generic cigarettes amounted to less than 1% of the domestic cigarettemarket.Because of the procedural posture of this case, we viewthe evidence in the light most favorable to Liggett. Theparties are in basic agreement, however, regarding the central, historical facts. Cigarette manufacturing has longbeen one of America's most concentrated industries, see F.Scherer & D. Ross, Industrial Market Structure and Economic Performance 250 (3d ed. 1990) (hereinafter Scherer &Ross); App. 495-498, and for decades, production has beendominated by six firms: R. J. Reynolds, Philip Morris, American Brands, Lorillard, and the two litigants involved here,Liggett and Brown & Williamson. R. J. Reynolds and PhilipMorris, the two industry leaders, enjoyed respective marketshares of about 28% and 40% at the time of trial. Brown &Williamson ran a distant third, its market share never exceeding 12% at any time relevant to this dispute. Liggett'sshare of the market was even less, from a low of just over2% in 1980 to a high of just over 5% in 1984.The cigarette industry also has long been one of America'smost profitable, in part because for many years there wasno significant price competition among the rival firms. SeeScherer & Ross 250-251; R. Tennant, American CigaretteIndustry 86-87 (1950); App. 128, 500-509, 531. List pricesfor cigarettes increased in lockstep, twice a year, for a number of years, irrespective of the rate of inflation, changesin the costs of production, or shifts in consumer demand.Substantial evidence suggests that in recent decades, the industry reaped the benefits of prices above a competitivelevel, though not through unlawful conduct of the type thatonce characterized the industry. See Tennant, supra, at275, 342; App. 389-392, 514-519, 658-659; cf. American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U. S. 781 (1946); United States509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT214 BROOKE GROUP LTD. v. BROWN & WILLIAMSONTOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the Courtv. American Tobacco Co., 221 U. S. 106 (1911); Scherer &Ross 451.By 1980, however, broad market trends were workingagainst the industry. Overall demand for cigarettes in theUnited States was declining, and no immediate prospect ofrecovery existed. As industry volume shrank, all firmsdeveloped substantial excess capacity. This decline in demand, coupled with the effects of nonprice competition, hada severe negative impact on Liggett. Once a major force inthe industry, with market shares in excess of 20%, Liggett'smarket share had declined by 1980 to a little over 2%. Withthis meager share of the market, Liggett was on the vergeof going out of business.At the urging of a distributor, Liggett took an unusualstep to revive its prospects: It developed a line of black andwhite generic cigarettes. When introduced in 1980, blackand whites were offered to consumers at a list price roughly30% lower than the list price of full-priced, branded cigarettes. They were also promoted at the wholesale level bymeans of rebates that increased with the volume of cigarettes ordered. Black and white cigarettes thus represented a new marketing category. The category's principalcompetitive characteristic was low price. Liggett's blackand whites were an immediate and considerable success,growing from a fraction of a percent of the market at theirintroduction to over 4% of the total cigarette market byearly 1984.As the market for Liggett's generic cigarettes expanded,the other cigarette companies found themselves unable toignore the economy segment. In general, the growth of generics came at the expense of the other firms' profitable salesof branded cigarettes. Brown & Williamson was hardesthit, because many of Brown & Williamson's brands were favored by consumers who were sensitive to changes in cigarette prices. Although Brown & Williamson sold only 11.4%of the market's branded cigarettes, 20% of the converts to509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT215Cite as: 509 U. S. 209 (1993)Opinion of the CourtLiggett's black and whites had switched from a Brown &Williamson brand. Losing volume and profits in its brandedproducts, Brown & Williamson determined to enter thegeneric segment of the cigarette market. In July 1983,Brown & Williamson had begun selling Value-25s, and in thespring of 1984, it introduced its own black and whitecigarette.Brown & Williamson was neither the first nor the onlycigarette company to recognize the threat posed by Liggett'sblack and whites and to respond in the economy segment.R. J. Reynolds had also introduced a Value-25 in 1983. Andbefore Brown & Williamson introduced its own black andwhites, R. J. Reynolds had repriced its "Doral" branded cigarette at generic levels. To compete with Liggett's black andwhites, R. J. Reynolds dropped its list price on Doral about30% and used volume rebates to wholesalers as an incentiveto spur orders. Doral was the first competition at Liggett'sprice level.Brown & Williamson's entry was an even graver threat toLiggett's dominance of the generic category. Unlike R. J.Reynolds' Doral, Brown & Williamson's product was also ablack and white and so would be in direct competition withLiggett's product at the wholesale level and on the retailshelf. Because Liggett's and Brown & Williamson's blackand whites were more or less fungible, wholesalers had littleincentive to carry more than one line. And unlike R. J.Reynolds, Brown & Williamson not only matched Liggett'sprices but beat them. At the retail level, the suggested listprice of Brown & Williamson's black and whites was thesame as Liggett's, but Brown & Williamson's volume discounts to wholesalers were larger. Brown & Williamson'srebate structure also encompassed a greater number of volume categories than Liggett's, with the highest categoriescarrying special rebates for orders of very substantial size.Brown & Williamson marketed its black and whites to Liggett's existing distributors as well as to its own full list of509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT216 BROOKE GROUP LTD. v. BROWN & WILLIAMSONTOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the Courtbuyers, which included a thousand wholesalers who had notyet carried any generic products.Liggett responded to Brown & Williamson's introductionof black and whites in two ways. First, Liggett increasedits own wholesale rebates. This precipitated a price war atthe wholesale level, in which Liggett five times attempted tobeat the rebates offered by Brown & Williamson. At theend of each round, Brown & Williamson maintained a realadvantage over Liggett's prices. Although it is undisputedthat Brown & Williamson's original net price for its blackand whites was above its costs, Liggett contends that by theend of the rebate war, Brown & Williamson was selling itsblack and whites at a loss. This rebate war occurred beforeBrown & Williamson had sold a single black and whitecigarette.Liggett's second response was to file a lawsuit. Twoweeks after Brown & Williamson announced its entry intothe generic segment, again before Brown & Williamson hadsold any generic cigarettes, Liggett filed a complaint in theUnited States District Court for the Middle District of NorthCarolina alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition. Liggett later amended its complaint to add an antitrust claim under $ 2(a) of the Clayton Act, as amended bythe Robinson-Patman Act, 49 Stat. 1526, 15 U. S. C. $ 13(a),which alleged illegal price discrimination between Brown& Williamson's full-priced branded cigarettes and its lowpriced generics. See Liggett Group, Inc. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 1989-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) || 68,583,p. 61,099 (MDNC 1988). These claims were either dismissedon summary judgment, see ibid., or rejected by the jury.They were not appealed.Liggett also amended its complaint to add a secondRobinson-Patman Act claim, which is the subject of the present controversy. Liggett alleged that Brown & Williamson'svolume rebates to wholesalers amounted to price discrimination that had a reasonable possibility of injuring competition,509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT217Cite as: 509 U. S. 209 (1993)Opinion of the Courtin violation of $ 2(a). Liggett claimed that Brown & Wil-liamson's discriminatory volume rebates were integral toa scheme of predatory pricing, in which Brown & William-son reduced its net prices for generic cigarettes below average variable costs. According to Liggett, these below-costprices were not promotional but were intended to pressureit to raise its list prices on generic cigarettes, so that thepercentage price difference between generic and brandedcigarettes would narrow. Liggett explained that it wouldhave been unable to reduce its wholesale rebates withoutlosing substantial market share to Brown & Williamson; itsonly choice, if it wished to avoid prolonged losses on its principal product line, was to raise retail prices. The resultingreduction in the list price gap, it was said, would restrainthe growth of the economy segment and preserve Brown& Williamson's supracompetitive profits on its brandedcigarettes.The trial began in the fall of 1989. By that time, all sixcigarette companies had entered the economy segment.The economy segment was the fastest growing segment ofthe cigarette market, having increased from about 4% of themarket in 1984, when the rebate war in generics began, toabout 15% in 1989. Black and white generics had declinedas a force in the economy segment as consumer interestshifted toward branded generics, but Liggett's overall volume had increased steadily to 9 billion generic cigarettessold. Overall, the 2.8 billion generic cigarettes sold in 1981had become 80 billion by 1989.The consumer price of generics had increased along withoutput. For a year, the list prices for generic cigarettes established at the end of the rebate war remained stable. Butin June 1985, Liggett raised its list price, and the other firmsfollowed several months later. The precise effect of the listprice increase is difficult to assess, because all of the cigarette firms offered a variety of discounts, coupons, andother promotions directly to consumers on both generic and509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT218 BROOKE GROUP LTD. v. BROWN & WILLIAMSONTOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the Courtbranded cigarettes. Nonetheless, at least some portion ofthe list price increase was reflected in a higher net price tothe consumer.In December 1985, Brown & Williamson attempted to increase its list prices, but retracted the announced increasewhen the other firms adhered to their existing prices. Thus,after Liggett's June 1985 increase, list prices on generics didnot change again until the summer of 1986, when a patternof twice yearly increases in tandem with the full-pricedbranded cigarettes was established. The dollar amount ofthese increases was the same for generic and full-priced cigarettes, which resulted in a greater percentage price increasein the less expensive generic cigarettes and a narrowing ofthe percentage gap between the list price of branded andblack and white cigarettes, from approximately 38% at thetime Brown & Williamson entered the segment to approximately 27% at the time of trial. Also by the time of trial,five of the six manufacturers, including Liggett, had introduced so-called "subgenerics," a category of branded genericcigarettes that sold at a discount of 50% or more off the listprice of full-priced branded cigarettes.After a 115-day trial involving almost 3,000 exhibits andover a score of witnesses, the jury returned a verdict in favorof Liggett, finding on the special verdict form that Brown &Williamson had engaged in price discrimination that had areasonable possibility of injuring competition in the domesticcigarette market as a whole. The jury awarded Liggett$49.6 million in damages, which the District Court trebledto $148.8 million. After reviewing the record, however, theDistrict Court held that Brown & Williamson was entitledto judgment as a matter of law on three separate grounds:lack of injury to competition, lack of antitrust injury to Liggett, and lack of a causal link between the discriminatoryrebates and Liggett's alleged injury. Liggett Group, Inc. v.Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 748 F. Supp. 344(MDNC 1990). With respect to the first issue, which is the509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT219Cite as: 509 U. S. 209 (1993)Opinion of the Courtonly one before us, the District Court found that no slowingof the growth rate of generics, and thus no injury to competition, was possible unless there had been tacit coordination ofprices in the economy segment of the cigarette market bythe various manufacturers. Id., at 354-355. The DistrictCourt held that a reasonable jury could come to but one conclusion about the existence of such coordination among thefirms contending for shares of the economy segment: it didnot exist, and Brown & Williamson therefore had no reason-able possibility of limiting the growth of the segment.Id.,at 356-358.The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuitaffirmed.Liggett Group, Inc. v. Brown & Williamson To-bacco Corp., 964 F. 2d 335 (1992). The Court of Appeals heldthat the dynamic of conscious parallelism among oligopolistscould not produce competitive injury in a predatory pricingsetting, which necessarily involves a price cut by one of theoligopolists. Id., at 342. In the Court of Appeals' view,"[t]o rely on the characteristics of an oligopoly to assure re-coupment of losses from a predatory pricing scheme afterone oligopolist has made a competitive move is . . . economi-cally irrational."Ibid.We granted certiorari, 506 U. S. 984 (1992), and now affirm.IIAPrice discrimination is made unlawful by $ 2(a) of the Clay-ton Act, 38 Stat. 730, as amended by the Robinson-PatmanAct, which provides:"It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in com-merce, in the course of such commerce, either directlyor indirectly, to discriminate in price between differentpurchasers of commodities of like grade and quality . . .where the effect of such discrimination may be substan-tially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopolyin any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT220 BROOKE GROUP LTD. v. BROWN & WILLIAMSONTOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the Courtcompetition with any person who either grants or know-ingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or withcustomers of either of them." 15 U. S. C. $ 13(a).Although we have reiterated that " `a price discriminationwithin the meaning of [this] provision is merely a price difference,' " Texaco Inc. v. Hasbrouck, 496 U. S. 543, 558 (1990)(quotingFTC v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 363 U. S. 536, 549(1960)), the statute as a practical matter could not, and doesnot, ban all price differences charged to "different purchas-ers of commodities of like grade and quality." Instead, thestatute contains a number of important limitations, one ofwhich is central to evaluating Liggett's claim: By its terms,the Robinson-Patman Act condemns price discriminationonly to the extent that it threatens to injure competition.The availability of statutory defenses permitting price dis-crimination when it is based on differences in costs, $ 13(a),"changing conditions affecting the market for or the market-ability of the goods concerned," ibid., or conduct undertaken"in good faith to meet an equally low price of a competitor,"$ 13(b); Standard Oil Co. v. FTC, 340 U. S. 231, 250 (1951),confirms that Congress did not intend to outlaw price differ-ences that result from or further the forces of competition.Thus, "the Robinson-Patman Act should be construed con-sistently with broader policies of the antitrust laws."GreatAtlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. FTC, 440 U. S. 69, 80, n. 13(1979). See also Automatic Canteen Co. of America v. FTC,346 U. S. 61, 63, 74 (1953).Liggett contends that Brown & Williamson's discrimina-tory volume rebates to wholesalers threatened substantialcompetitive injury by furthering a predatory pricing schemedesigned to purge competition from the economy segmentof the cigarette market. This type of injury, which harmsdirect competitors of the discriminating seller, is known asprimary-line injury. See FTC v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc.,supra, at 538. We last addressed primary-line injury over25 years ago, in Utah Pie Co. v. Continental Baking Co.,509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT221Cite as: 509 U. S. 209 (1993)Opinion of the Court386 U. S. 685 (1967). In Utah Pie, we reviewed the suffi-ciency of the evidence supporting jury verdicts against threenational pie companies that had engaged in a variety of pred-atory practices in the market for frozen pies in Salt LakeCity, with the intent to drive a local pie manufacturer out ofbusiness. We reversed the Court of Appeals and held thatthe evidence presented was adequate to permit a jury to finda likelihood of injury to competition. Id., at 703.Utah Pie has often been interpreted to permit liability forprimary-line price discrimination on a mere showing that thedefendant intended to harm competition or produced a declining price structure. The case has been criticized on theground that such low standards of competitive injury are atodds with the antitrust laws' traditional concern for consumer welfare and price competition. See Bowman, Restraint of Trade by the Supreme Court: The Utah Pie Case,77 Yale L. J. 70 (1967); R. Posner, Antitrust Law: An Economic Perspective 193-194 (1976); L. Sullivan, Antitrust 687(1977); 3 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law || 720c (1978)(hereinafter Areeda & Turner); R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 386-387 (1978); H. Hovenkamp, Economics and FederalAntitrust Law 188-189 (1985). We do not regard the UtahPie case itself as having the full significance attributed toit by its detractors. Utah Pie was an early judicial inquiryin this area and did not purport to set forth explicit, general standards for establishing a violation of the RobinsonPatman Act. As the law has been explored since Utah Pie,it has become evident that primary-line competitive injuryunder the Robinson-Patman Act is of the same general character as the injury inflicted by predatory pricing schemesactionable under $ 2 of the Sherman Act. See, e. g., Henry v.Chloride, Inc., 809 F. 2d 1334, 1345 (CA8 1987); D. E. RogersAssociates, Inc. v. Gardner-Denver Co., 718 F. 2d 1431, 1439(CA6 1983), cert. denied, 467 U.

There are, to besure, differences between the two statutes. For example,we interpret $ 2 of the Sherman Act to condemn predatorypricing when it poses "a dangerous probability of actual monopolization," Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U. S.447, 455 (1993), whereas the Robinson-Patman Act requiresonly that there be "a reasonable possibility" of substantial injury to competition before its protections are trig-gered,Falls City Industries, Inc. v. Vanco Beverage, Inc.,460 U. S. 428, 434 (1983). But whatever additional flexibilitythe Robinson-Patman Act standard may imply, the essenceof the claim under either statute is the same: A businessrival has priced its products in an unfair manner with anobject to eliminate or retard competition and thereby gainand exercise control over prices in the relevant market.Accordingly, whether the claim alleges predatory pricingunder $ 2 of the Sherman Act or primary-line price discrimi-nation under the Robinson-Patman Act, two prerequisites torecovery remain the same. First, a plaintiff seeking to es-tablish competitive injury resulting from a rival's low pricesmust prove that the prices complained of are below an appro-priate measure of its rival's costs.1 See, e. g., Cargill, Inc.v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U. S. 104, 117 (1986); Mat1 Because the parties in this case agree that the relevant measure of costis average variable cost, however, we again decline to resolve the conflictamong the lower courts over the appropriate measure of cost. See Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U. S. 104, 117-118, n. 12 (1986);Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.

S. 29 (1963) (holding that below-cost prices mayconstitute "unreasonably low" prices for purposes of $ 3 ofthe Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 13a). AlthoughCargill and Matsushita reserved as a formal matter the ques-tion " `whether recovery shouldever be available . . . whenthe pricing in question is above some measure of incrementalcost,' "Cargill, supra, at 117-118, n. 12 (quoting Matsushita,supra, at 585, n. 9), the reasoning in both opinions suggeststhat only below-cost prices should suffice, and we have rejected elsewhere the notion that above-cost prices that arebelow general market levels or the costs of a firm's competitors inflict injury to competition cognizable under the antitrust laws. See Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA PetroleumCo., 495 U. S. 328, 340 (1990). "Low prices benefit consumers regardless of how those prices are set, and so long asthey are above predatory levels, they do not threatencompetition. . . . We have adhered to this principle regardlessof the type of antitrust claim involved." Ibid. As a generalrule, the exclusionary effect of prices above a relevant measure of cost either reflects the lower cost structure of thealleged predator, and so represents competition on the merits, or is beyond the practical ability of a judicial tribunal tocontrol without courting intolerable risks of chilling legitimate price cutting. See Areeda & Hovenkamp |||| 714.2,714.3. "To hold that the antitrust laws protect competitorsfrom the loss of profits due to such price competition would,in effect, render illegal any decision by a firm to cut pricesin order to increase market share. The antitrust laws require no such perverse result." Cargill, supra, at 116.Even in an oligopolistic market, when a firm drops itsprices to a competitive level to demonstrate to a maverickthe unprofitability of straying from the group, it would be509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT224 BROOKE GROUP LTD. v. BROWN & WILLIAMSONTOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the Courtillogical to condemn the price cut: The antitrust laws thenwould be an obstacle to the chain of events most conduciveto a breakdown of oligopoly pricing and the onset of competi-tion. Even if the ultimate effect of the cut is to induce orreestablish supracompetitive pricing, discouraging a pricecut and forcing firms to maintain supracompetitive prices,thus depriving consumers of the benefits of lower prices inthe interim, does not constitute sound antitrust policy. Cf.Areeda & Hovenkamp |||| 714.2d, 714.2f; Areeda & Turner,Predatory Pricing and Related Practices under Section 2 ofthe Sherman Act, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 697, 708-709 (1975);Posner, Antitrust Law: An Economic Perspective, at 195,n. 39.The second prerequisite to holding a competitor liableunder the antitrust laws for charging low prices is a demonstration that the competitor had a reasonable prospect, or,under $ 2 of the Sherman Act, a dangerous probability, ofrecouping its investment in below-cost prices. See Matsushita, supra, at 589; Cargill, supra, at 119, n. 15. "For theinvestment to be rational, the [predator] must have a reasonable expectation of recovering, in the form of later monopolyprofits, more than the losses suffered." Matsushita, supra,at 588-589. Recoupment is the ultimate object of an unlawful predatory pricing scheme; it is the means by which apredator profits from predation. Without it, predatory pricing produces lower aggregate prices in the market, and consumer welfare is enhanced. Although unsuccessful predatory pricing may encourage some inefficient substitutiontoward the product being sold at less than its cost, unsuccessful predation is in general a boon to consumers.That below-cost pricing may impose painful losses on itstarget is of no moment to the antitrust laws if competition isnot injured: It is axiomatic that the antitrust laws werepassed for "the protection of competition, not competitors."Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U. S. 294, 320 (1962).Earlier this Term, we held in the Sherman Act $ 2 context509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT225Cite as: 509 U. S. 209 (1993)Opinion of the Courtthat it was not enough to inquire "whether the defendant hasengaged in `unfair' or `predatory' tactics"; rather, we insistedthat the plaintiff prove "a dangerous probability that [thedefendant] would monopolize a particular market." Spectrum Sports, 506 U. S., at 459. Even an act of pure maliceby one business competitor against another does not, withoutmore, state a claim under the federal antitrust laws; thoselaws do not create a federal law of unfair competition or"purport to afford remedies for all torts committed by oragainst persons engaged in interstate commerce." Hunt v.Crumboch, 325 U. S. 821, 826 (1945).For recoupment to occur, below-cost pricing must be capable, as a threshold matter, of producing the intended effectson the firm's rivals, whether driving them from the market,or, as was alleged to be the goal here, causing them to raisetheir prices to supracompetitive levels within a disciplinedoligopoly. This requires an understanding of the extent andduration of the alleged predation, the relative financialstrength of the predator and its intended victim, and theirrespective incentives and will. See 3 Areeda & Turner|| 711b. The inquiry is whether, given the aggregate lossescaused by the below-cost pricing, the intended target wouldlikely succumb.If circumstances indicate that below-cost pricing couldlikely produce its intended effect on the target, there is stillthe further question whether it would likely injure competition in the relevant market. The plaintiff must demonstratethat there is a likelihood that the predatory scheme allegedwould cause a rise in prices above a competitive level thatwould be sufficient to compensate for the amounts expendedon the predation, including the time value of the money invested in it. As we have observed on a prior occasion, "[i]norder to recoup their losses, [predators] must obtain enoughmarket power to set higher than competitive prices, and thenmust sustain those prices long enough to earn in excess509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT226 BROOKE GROUP LTD. v. BROWN & WILLIAMSONTOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the Courtprofits what they earlier gave up in below-cost prices."Matsushita, 475 U. S., at 590-591.Evidence of below-cost pricing is not alone sufficient topermit an inference of probable recoupment and injury tocompetition. Determining whether recoupment of predatory losses is likely requires an estimate of the cost of thealleged predation and a close analysis of both the schemealleged by the plaintiff and the structure and conditions ofthe relevant market. Cf.,e. g., Elzinga & Mills, Testing forPredation: Is Recoupment Feasible?, 34 Antitrust Bull. 869(1989) (constructing one possible model for evaluating recoupment). If market circumstances or deficiencies in proofwould bar a reasonable jury from finding that the schemealleged would likely result in sustained supracompetitivepricing, the plaintiff 's case has failed. In certain situations--for example, where the market is highly diffuse andcompetitive, or where new entry is easy, or the defendantlacks adequate excess capacity to absorb the market sharesof his rivals and cannot quickly create or purchase newcapacity--summary disposition of the case is appropriate.See, e. g., Cargill, 479 U. S., at 119-120, n. 15.These prerequisites to recovery are not easy to establish,but they are not artificial obstacles to recovery; rather, theyare essential components of real market injury. As we havesaid in the Sherman Act context, "predatory pricing schemesare rarely tried, and even more rarely successful," Matsushita, supra, at 589, and the costs of an erroneous finding ofliability are high. "[T]he mechanism by which a firm engages in predatory pricing--lowering prices--is the samemechanism by which a firm stimulates competition; because`cutting prices in order to increase business often is the veryessence of competition . . . [;] mistaken inferences . . . areespecially costly, because they chill the very conduct the antitrust laws are designed to protect.' " Cargill, supra, at122, n. 17 (quoting Matsushita, supra, at 594). It would beironic indeed if the standards for predatory pricing liability509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT227Cite as: 509 U. S. 209 (1993)Opinion of the Courtwere so low that antitrust suits themselves became a tool forkeeping prices high.BLiggett does not allege that Brown & Williamson soughtto drive it from the market but that Brown & Williamsonsought to preserve supracompetitive profits on branded ciga-rettes by pressuring Liggett to raise its generic cigaretteprices through a process of tacit collusion with the other cig-arette companies. Tacit collusion, sometimes called oligopolistic price coordination or conscious parallelism, describesthe process, not in itself unlawful, by which firms in a concentrated market might in effect share monopoly power, settingtheir prices at a profit-maximizing, supracompetitive level byrecognizing their shared economic interests and their inter-dependence with respect to price and output decisions. See2 Areeda & Turner || 404; Scherer & Ross 199-208.InMatsushita, we remarked upon the general implausibil-ity of predatory pricing. See 475 U. S., at 588-590. Matsushita observed that such schemes are even more improbablewhen they require coordinated action among several firms.Id., at 590. Matsushita involved an allegation of an expressconspiracy to engage in predatory pricing. The Court notedthat in addition to the usual difficulties that face a singlefirm attempting to recoup predatory losses, other problemsrender a conspiracy "incalculably more difficult to execute."Ibid. In order to succeed, the conspirators must agree onhow to allocate present losses and future gains among thefirms involved, and each firm must resist powerful incentivesto cheat on whatever agreement is reached. Ibid.However unlikely predatory pricing by multiple firms maybe when they conspire, it is even less likely when, as here,there is no express coordination. Firms that seek to recouppredatory losses through the conscious parallelism of oligopoly must rely on uncertain and ambiguous signals to achieveconcerted action. The signals are subject to misinterpretation and are a blunt and imprecise means of ensuring smooth509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT228 BROOKE GROUP LTD. v. BROWN & WILLIAMSONTOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the Courtcooperation, especially in the context of changing or un-precedented market circumstances. This anticompetitiveminuet is most difficult to compose and to perform, even fora disciplined oligopoly.From one standpoint, recoupment through oligopolisticprice coordination could be thought more feasible than re-coupment through monopoly: In the oligopoly setting, thevictim itself has an economic incentive to acquiesce in thescheme. If forced to choose between cutting prices and sustaining losses, maintaining prices and losing market share,or raising prices and enjoying a share of supracompetitiveprofits, a firm may yield to the last alternative. Yet on thewhole, tacit cooperation among oligopolists must be considered the least likely means of recouping predatory losses.In addition to the difficulty of achieving effective tacit coordination and the high likelihood that any attempt to discipline will produce an outbreak of competition, the predator'spresent losses in a case like this fall on it alone, while thelater supracompetitive profits must be shared with everyother oligopolist in proportion to its market share, includingthe intended victim. In this case, for example, Brown &Williamson, with its 11-12% share of the cigarette market,would have had to generate around $9 in supracompetitiveprofits for each $1 invested in predation; the remaining $8would belong to its competitors, who had taken no risk.Liggett suggests that these considerations led the Courtof Appeals to rule out its theory of recovery as a matterof law. Although the proper interpretation of the Court ofAppeals' opinion is not free from doubt, there is some indication that it held as a matter of law that the Robinson-PatmanAct does not reach a primary-line injury claim in which tacitcoordination among oligopolists provides the alleged basisfor recoupment. The Court of Appeals' opinion does notcontain the traditional apparatus of fact review; rather, itfocuses on theoretical and legal arguments. The final paragraph appears to state the holding: Brown & Williamson509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT229Cite as: 509 U. S. 209 (1993)Opinion of the Courtmay not be held liable because oligopoly pricing does not" `provide an economically rational basis' " for recoupingpredatory losses. 964 F. 2d, at 342.To the extent that the Court of Appeals may have heldthat the interdependent pricing of an oligopoly may neverprovide a means for achieving recoupment and so may notform the basis of a primary-line injury claim, we disagree.A predatory pricing scheme designed to preserve or createa stable oligopoly, if successful, can injure consumers in thesame way, and to the same extent, as one designed to bringabout a monopoly. However unlikely that possibility may beas a general matter, when the realities of the market and therecord facts indicate that it has occurred and was likely tohave succeeded, theory will not stand in the way of liability.See Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc.,504 U. S. 451, 466-467 (1992).The Robinson-Patman Act, which amended $ 2 of the original Clayton Act, suggests no exclusion from coverage whenprimary-line injury occurs in an oligopoly setting. Unlikethe provisions of the Sherman Act, which speak only of various forms of express agreement and monopoly, see 15 U. S. C.$$ 1, 2, the Robinson-Patman Act is phrased in broader, disjunctive terms, prohibiting price discrimination "where theeffect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessencompetition or tend to create a monopoly," 15 U. S. C. $ 13(a).For all the words of the Act to carry adequate meaning, competitive injury under the Act must extend beyond the monopoly setting. Cf. Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330,339 (1979) ("Canons of construction ordinarily suggest thatterms connected by a disjunctive be given separate meanings, unless the context dictates otherwise"). The languagereferring to a substantial lessening of competition was partof the original Clayton Act $ 2, see Act of Oct. 15, 1914, ch.322, 38 Stat. 730, and the same phrasing appears in $ 7 ofthat Act.

We adhere to "the normal ruleof statutory construction that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the samemeaning."Sullivan v. Stroop, 496 U. S. 478, 484 (1990) (in-ternal quotation marks omitted). See also J. Truett PayneCo. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 451 U. S. 557, 562 (1981) (evalu-ating the competitive injury requirement of RobinsonPatman Act $ 2(a) in light of analogous interpretations ofClayton Act $ 7). We decline to create a per se rule of nonliability for predatory price discrimination when recoupmentis alleged to take place through supracompetitive oligopolypricing. Cf. Cargill, 479 U. S., at 121.IIIAlthough Liggett's theory of liability, as an abstract mat-ter, is within the reach of the statute, we agree with theCourt of Appeals and the District Court that Liggett wasnot entitled to submit its case to the jury. It is not customary for this Court to review the sufficiency of the evidence,but we will do so when the issue is properly before us andthe benefits of providing guidance concerning the proper ap-plication of a legal standard and avoiding the systemic costsassociated with further proceedings justify the required ex-penditure of judicial resources. See, e. g., Aspen Skiing Co.v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U. S. 585, 605-611(1985); Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U. S.752, 765-768 (1984); United States v. Pabst Brewing Co., 384U. S. 546, 550-552 (1966). The record in this case demonstrates that the anticompetitive scheme Liggett alleged,when judged against the realities of the market, does notprovide an adequate basis for a finding of liability.ALiggett's theory of competitive injury through oligopolisticprice coordination depends upon a complex chain of cause509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT231Cite as: 509 U. S. 209 (1993)Opinion of the Courtand effect: Brown & Williamson would enter the generic seg-ment with list prices matching Liggett's but with massive,discriminatory volume rebates directed at Liggett's biggestwholesalers; as a result, the net price of Brown & Williamson's generics would be below its costs; Liggett would sufferlosses trying to defend its market share and wholesale cus-tomer base by matching Brown & Williamson's rebates; toavoid further losses, Liggett would raise its list prices ongenerics or acquiesce in price leadership by Brown & Williamson; higher list prices to consumers would shrink thepercentage gap in retail price between generic and brandedcigarettes; and this narrowing of the gap would make generics less appealing to the consumer, thus slowing the growthof the economy segment and reducing cannibalization ofbranded sales and their associated supracompetitive profits.Although Brown & Williamson's entry into the genericsegment could be regarded as procompetitive in intent aswell as effect, the record contains sufficient evidence fromwhich a reasonable jury could conclude that Brown &Williamson envisioned or intended this anticompetitivecourse of events. See, e. g., App. 57-58, 67-68, 89-91, 99,112-114, 200, 241, 253, 257, 262-263, 279-280, 469-470, 664-666. There is also sufficient evidence in the record fromwhich a reasonable jury could conclude that for a period ofapproximately 18 months, Brown & Williamson's prices onits generic cigarettes were below its costs, see id., at 338-339, 651, 740, and that this below-cost pricing imposed losseson Liggett that Liggett was unwilling to sustain, given itscorporate parent's effort to locate a buyer for the company,see id., at 74, 92, 200, 253, 596-597. Liggett has failed todemonstrate competitive injury as a matter of law, however,because its proof is flawed in a critical respect: The evidenceis inadequate to show that in pursuing this scheme, Brown &Williamson had a reasonable prospect of recovering its lossesfrom below-cost pricing through slowing the growth of generics. As we have noted, "[t]he success of any predatory509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT232 BROOKE GROUP LTD. v. BROWN & WILLIAMSONTOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the Courtscheme depends on maintaining monopoly power for longenough both to recoup the predator's losses and to harvestsome additional gain." Matsushita, 475 U. S., at 589 (em-phasis omitted).No inference of recoupment is sustainable on this record,because no evidence suggests that Brown & Williamson--whatever its intent in introducing black and whites may havebeen--was likely to obtain the power to raise the prices forgeneric cigarettes above a competitive level. Recoupmentthrough supracompetitive pricing in the economy segment ofthe cigarette market is an indispensable aspect of Liggett'sown proffered theory, because a slowing of growth in theeconomy segment, even if it results from an increase ingeneric prices, is not itself anticompetitive. Only if thosehigher prices are a product of nonmarket forces has compe-tition suffered. If prices rise in response to an excess ofdemand over supply, or segment growth slows as patterns ofconsumer preference become stable, the market is functioning in a competitive manner. Consumers are not injuredfrom the perspective of the antitrust laws by the price increases; they are in fact causing them. Thus, the linchpinof the predatory scheme alleged by Liggett is Brown &Williamson's ability, with the other oligopolists, to raiseprices above a competitive level in the generic segment ofthe market. Because relying on tacit coordination amongoligopolists as a means of recouping losses from predatorypricing is "highly speculative," Areeda & Hovenkamp|| 711.2c, at 647, competent evidence is necessary to allow areasonable inference that it poses an authentic threat to com-petition. The evidence in this case is insufficient to demonstrate the danger of Brown & Williamson's alleged scheme.BBased on Liggett's theory of the case and the record itcreated, there are two means by which one might infer that509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT233Cite as: 509 U. S. 209 (1993)Opinion of the CourtBrown & Williamson had a reasonable prospect of producingsustained supracompetitive pricing in the generic segmentadequate to recoup its predatory losses: first, if generic out-put or price information indicates that oligopolistic price coordination in fact produced supracompetitive prices in thegeneric segment; or second, if evidence about the market andBrown & Williamson's conduct indicate that the allegedscheme was likely to have brought about tacit coordinationand oligopoly pricing in the generic segment, even if it didnot actually do so.1In this case, the price and output data do not support areasonable inference that Brown & Williamson and the othercigarette companies elevated prices above a competitive levelfor generic cigarettes. Supracompetitive pricing entails arestriction in output. See National Collegiate AthleticAssn. v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468 U. S. 85,104-108 (1984);Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U. S. 1, 19-20 (1979); P. Samuel-son & W. Nordhaus, Economics 516 (12th ed. 1985); Sullivan,Antitrust, at 32; Bork, The Antitrust Paradox, at 178-179; 2Areeda & Turner || 403a; Easterbrook, The Limits of Antitrust, 63 Texas L. Rev. 1, 20, 31 (1984). In the present set-ting, in which output expanded at a rapid rate followingBrown & Williamson's alleged predation, output in the generic segment can only have been restricted in the sensethat it expanded at a slower rate than it would have absentBrown & Williamson's intervention. Such a counterfactualproposition is difficult to prove in the best of circumstances;here, the record evidence does not permit a reasonable infer-ence that output would have been greater without Brown &Williamson's entry into the generic segment.Following Brown & Williamson's entry, the rate at whichgeneric cigarettes were capturing market share did not slow;indeed, the average rate of growth doubled. During the509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT234 BROOKE GROUP LTD. v. BROWN & WILLIAMSONTOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the Courtfour years from 1980 to 1984 in which Liggett was alone inthe generic segment, the segment gained market share at anaverage rate of 1% of the overall market per year, from 0.4%in 1980 to slightly more than 4% of the cigarette market in1984. In the next five years, following the alleged predation, the generic segment expanded from 4% to more than15% of the domestic cigarette market, or greater than 2%per year.While this evidence tends to show that Brown & Williamson's participation in the economy segment did not restrictoutput, it is not dispositive. One could speculate, for example, that the rate of segment growth would have tripled, instead of doubled, without Brown & Williamson's alleged predation. But there is no concrete evidence of this. Indeed,the only industry projection in the record estimating whatthe segment's growth would have been without Brown &Williamson's entry supports the opposite inference. In 1984,Brown & Williamson forecast in an important planning document that the economy segment would account for 10% ofthe total cigarette market by 1988 if it did not enter thesegment. App. 133, 135. In fact, in 1988, after what Liggett alleges was a sustained and dangerous anticompetitivecampaign by Brown & Williamson, the generic segment accounted for over 12% of the total market. Id., at 354-356.Thus the segment's output expanded more robustly thanBrown & Williamson had estimated it would had Brown &Williamson never entered.Brown & Williamson did note in 1985, a year after introducing its black and whites, that its presence withinthe generic segment "appears to have resulted in . . . aslowing in the segment's growth rate." Id., at 257. Butthis statement was made in early 1985, when Liggettitself contends the below-cost pricing was still in effect andbefore any anticompetitive contraction in output is allegedto have occurred.509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT235Cite as: 509 U. S. 209 (1993)Opinion of the CourtWhatever it may mean,2 this statement has little value inevaluating the competitive implications of Brown & Williamson's later conduct, which was alleged to provide the basisfor recouping predatory losses.In arguing that Brown & Williamson was able to exertmarket power and raise generic prices above a competitivelevel in the generic category through tacit price coordinationwith the other cigarette manufacturers, Liggett places itsprincipal reliance on direct evidence of price behavior. Thisevidence demonstrates that the list prices on all cigarettes,generic and branded alike, rose to a significant degree duringthe late 1980's.Id., at 325. From 1986 to 1989, list priceson both generic and branded cigarettes increased twice ayear by similar amounts. Liggett's economic expert testi-fied that these price increases outpaced increases in costs,taxes, and promotional expenditures. Id., at 525. The listprices of generics, moreover, rose at a faster rate than theprices of branded cigarettes, thus narrowing the list pricedifferential between branded and generic products.Id., at325. Liggett argues that this would permit a reasonablejury to find that Brown & Williamson succeeded in bringingabout oligopolistic price coordination and supracompetitiveprices in the generic category sufficient to slow its growth,thereby preserving supracompetitive branded profits and recouping its predatory losses.A reasonable jury, however, could not have drawn the inferences Liggett proposes. All of Liggett's data are basedupon the list prices of various categories of cigarettes. Yetthe jury had before it undisputed evidence that during theperiod in question, list prices were not the actual prices paidby consumers. 100 Tr. 227-229. As the market became un2 This statement could well have referred to the rate at which the segment was growing relative to prior years' generic volume; this "internal"rate of growth would inevitably slow as the base volume against which itwas measured grew.509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT236 BROOKE GROUP LTD. v. BROWN & WILLIAMSONTOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the Courtsettled in the mid-1980's, the cigarette companies investedsubstantial sums in promotional schemes, including coupons,stickers, and giveaways, that reduced the actual cost of ciga-rettes to consumers below list prices. 33 Tr. 206-209, 51Tr. 130. This promotional activity accelerated as the decadeprogressed. App. 509, 672. Many wholesalers also passedportions of their volume rebates on to the consumer, whichhad the effect of further undermining the significance of theretail list prices.Id., at 672, 687-692, 761-763. Especiallyin an oligopoly setting, in which price competition is mostlikely to take place through less observable and less regulable means than list prices, it would be unreasonable to drawconclusions about the existence of tacit coordination or supracompetitive pricing from data that reflect only list prices.Even on its own terms, the list price data relied upon byLiggett to demonstrate a narrowing of the price differentialbetween generic and full-priced branded cigarettes could notsupport the conclusion that supracompetitive pricing hadbeen introduced into the generic segment. Liggett's gapdata ignore the effect of "subgeneric" cigarettes, which werepriced at discounts of 50% or more from the list prices ofnormal branded cigarettes. See, e. g., id., at 682-686. Liggett itself, while supposedly under the sway of oligopolypower, pioneered this development in 1988 with the introduction of its "Pyramid" brand. Id., at 326. By the time oftrial, five of the six major manufacturers offered a cigarettein this category at a discount from the full list price of atleast 50%. Id., at 685-686; 147 Tr. 107. Thus, the price difference between the highest priced branded cigarette andthe lowest price cigarettes in the economy segment, insteadof narrowing over the course of the period of alleged predation as Liggett would argue, grew to a substantial extent.In June 1984, before Brown & Williamson entered the generic segment, a consumer could obtain a carton of black andwhite generic cigarettes from Liggett at a 38% discount fromthe list price of a leading brand; after the conduct Liggett509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT237Cite as: 509 U. S. 209 (1993)Opinion of the Courtcomplains of, consumers could obtain a branded generic fromLiggett for 52% off the list price of a leading brand. SeeApp. 325-326, 685.It may be that a reasonable jury could conclude that thecumulative discounts attributable to subgenerics and thevarious consumer promotions did not cancel out the full effect of the increases in list prices, see id., at 508-509, andthat actual prices to the consumer did indeed rise, but risingprices do not themselves permit an inference of a collusivemarket dynamic. Even in a concentrated market, the occurrence of a price increase does not in itself permit a rationalinference of conscious parallelism or supracompetitive pricing. Where, as here, output is expanding at the same timeprices are increasing, rising prices are equally consistentwith growing product demand. Under these conditions, ajury may not infer competitive injury from price and outputdata absent some evidence that tends to prove that outputwas restricted or prices were above a competitive level. Cf.Monsanto, 465 U. S., at 763.Quite apart from the absence of any evidence of that sort,an inference of supracompetitive pricing would be particu-larly anomalous in this case, as the very party alleged tohave been coerced into pricing through oligopolistic coordi-nation denied that such coordination existed: Liggett's ownofficers and directors consistently denied that they or otherfirms in the industry priced their cigarettes through tacitcollusion or reaped supracompetitive profits. App. 394-399,623-631; 11 Tr. 170-174, 64 Tr. 51-56. Liggett seeks to explain away this testimony by arguing that its officers anddirectors are businesspeople who do not ascribe the samemeaning to words like "competitive" and "collusion" that aneconomist would. This explanation is entitled to little, ifany, weight. As the District Court found:"This argument was considered at the summary judg-ment stage since these executives gave basically thesame testimony at their depositions. The court allowed509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT238 BROOKE GROUP LTD. v. BROWN & WILLIAMSONTOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the Courtthe case to go to trial in part because the Liggett execu-tives were not economists and in part because of affidavits from the Liggett executives stating that they wereconfused by the questions asked by B[rown] & W[illiamson] lawyers and did not mean to contradict the testi-mony of [their economic expert] Burnett. However, attrial, despite having consulted extensively with Burnettand having had adequate time to familiarize themselveswith concepts such as tacit collusion, oligopoly, andmonopoly profits, these Liggett executives again contradicted Burnett's theory." 748 F. Supp., at 356.2Not only does the evidence fail to show actual supracom-petitive pricing in the generic segment, it also does not demonstrate its likelihood. At the time Brown & Williamsonentered the generic segment, the cigarette industry as awhole faced declining demand and possessed substantial ex-cess capacity. App. 82-84. These circumstances tend tobreak down patterns of oligopoly pricing and produce pricecompetition. See Scherer & Ross 294, 315; 2 Areeda &Turner || 404b2, at 275-276; 6 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law|| 1430e, p. 181 (1986). The only means by which Brown &Williamson is alleged to have established oligopoly pricing inthe face of these unusual competitive pressures is throughtacit price coordination with the other cigarette firms.Yet the situation facing the cigarette companies in the1980's would have made such tacit coordination unmanage-able. Tacit coordination is facilitated by a stable marketenvironment, fungible products, and a small number of vari-ables upon which the firms seeking to coordinate their pricing may focus. See generally Scherer & Ross 215-315; 6 P.Areeda,supra, |||| 1428-1430. Uncertainty is an oligopoly'sgreatest enemy. By 1984, however, the cigarette marketwas in an obvious state of flux. The introduction of genericcigarettes in 1980 represented the first serious price com509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT239Cite as: 509 U. S. 209 (1993)Opinion of the Courtpetition in the cigarette market since the 1930's. SeeScherer & Ross 250-251; App. 128. This development wasbound to unsettle previous expectations and patterns of mar-ket conduct and to reduce the cigarette firms' ability to predict each other's behavior.The larger number of product types and pricing variablesalso decreased the probability of effective parallel pricing.When Brown & Williamson entered the economy segment in1984, the segment included Value-25s, black and whites, andbranded generics. With respect to each product, the netprice in the market was determined not only by list prices,but also by a wide variety of discounts and promotions toconsumers and by rebates to wholesalers. In order to coordinate in an effective manner and eliminate price competition, the cigarette companies would have been required,without communicating, to establish parallel practices withrespect to each of these variables, many of which, like consumer stickers or coupons, were difficult to monitor. Liggett has not even alleged parallel behavior with respect tothese other variables, and the inherent limitations of tacitcollusion suggest that such multivariable coordination isimprobable. See R. Dorfman, The Price System 99-100,and n. 10 (1964); Scherer & Ross 279.In addition, R. J. Reynolds had incentives that, in somerespects, ran counter to those of the other cigarette companies. It is implausible that without a shared interest in retarding the growth of the economy segment, Brown & Williamson and its fellow oligopolists could have engaged inparallel pricing and raised generic prices above a competitivelevel. "[C]oordination will not be possible when any significant firm chooses, for any reason, to `go it alone.' " 2Areeda & Turner || 404b2, at 276. It is undisputed--indeedit was conceded by Liggett's expert--that R. J. Reynoldsacted without regard to the supposed benefits of oligopolisticcoordination when it repriced Doral at generic levels in thespring of 1984 and that the natural and probable consequence509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT240 BROOKE GROUP LTD. v. BROWN & WILLIAMSONTOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the Courtof its entry into the generic segment was procompetitive.55 Tr. 15-16; 51 Tr. 128. Indeed, Reynolds' apparent objective in entering the segment was to capture a significantamount of volume in order to regain its number one salesposition in the cigarette industry from Philip Morris. App.75, 130, 209-211. There is no evidence that R. J. Reynoldsaccomplished this goal during the period relevant to thiscase, or that its commitment to achieving that goal changed.Indeed, R. J. Reynolds refused to follow Brown & Williamson's attempt to raise generic prices in June 1985. The jurythus had before it undisputed evidence that contradicts thesuggestion that the major cigarette companies shared a goalof limiting the growth of the economy segment; one of theindustry's two major players concededly entered the segment to expand volume and compete.Even if all the cigarette companies were willing to participate in a scheme to restrain the growth of the genericsegment, they would not have been able to coordinate theiractions and raise prices above a competitive level unless theyunderstood that Brown & Williamson's entry into the segment was not a genuine effort to compete with Liggett. Ifeven one other firm misinterpreted Brown & Williamson'sentry as an effort to expand share, a chain reaction of competitive responses would almost certainly have resulted, andoligopoly discipline would have broken down, perhaps irretrievably. "[O]nce the trust among rivals breaks down, it isas hard to put back together again as was Humpty-Dumpty,and non-collusive behavior is likely to take over." Samuelson & Nordhaus, Economics, at 534.Liggett argues that the means by which Brown & Williamson signaled its anticompetitive intent to its rivals wasthrough its pricing structure. According to Liggett, maintaining existing list prices while offering substantial rebatesto wholesalers was a signal to the other cigarette firms thatBrown & Williamson did not intend to attract additionalsmokers to the generic segment by its entry. But a reason509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT241Cite as: 509 U. S. 209 (1993)Opinion of the Courtable jury could not conclude that this pricing structure elimi-nated or rendered insignificant the risk that the other firmsmight misunderstand Brown & Williamson's entry as a com-petitive move. The likelihood that Brown & Williamson'srivals would have regarded its pricing structure as an important signal is low, given that Liggett itself, the purportedtarget of the predation, was already using similar rebates,as was R. J. Reynolds in marketing its Doral branded ge-neric. A Reynolds executive responsible for Doral testifiedthat given its and Liggett's use of wholesaler rebates,Brown & Williamson could not have competed effectivelywithout them. App. 756. And despite extensive discoveryof the corporate records of R. J. Reynolds and Philip Morris,no documents appeared that indicated any awareness ofBrown & Williamson's supposed signal by its principal rivals.Without effective signaling, it is difficult to see how thealleged predation could have had a reasonable chance ofsuccess through oligopoly pricing.Finally, although some of Brown & Williamson's corporateplanning documents speak of a desire to slow the growth ofthe segment, no objective evidence of its conduct permits areasonable inference that it had any real prospect of doing sothrough anticompetitive means. It is undisputed that whenBrown & Williamson introduced its generic cigarettes, it offered them to a thousand wholesalers who had never beforepurchased generic cigarettes. Record, Plaintiff 's Exh. No.4079; 87 Tr. 191; 88 Tr. 143-147. The inevitable effect ofthis marketing effort was to expand the segment, as the newwholesalers recruited retail outlets to carry generic cigarettes. Even with respect to wholesalers already carryinggenerics, Brown & Williamson's unprecedented volume rebates had a similar expansionary effect. Unlike manybranded cigarettes, generics came with no sales guaranteeto the wholesaler; any unsold stock represented pure lossto the wholesaler. By providing substantial incentives forwholesalers to place large orders, Brown & Williamson cre509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT242 BROOKE GROUP LTD. v. BROWN & WILLIAMSONTOBACCO CORP.Opinion of the Courtated strong pressure for them to sell more generic cigarettes.In addition, as we have already observed, seesupra, at 236,many wholesalers passed portions of the rebates about whichLiggett complains on to consumers, thus dropping the retailprice of generics and further stimulating demand. Brown &Williamson provided a further, direct stimulus, through some$10 million it spent during the period of alleged predationplacing discount stickers on its generic cartons to reduceprices to the ultimate consumer. 70 Tr. 246. In light ofthese uncontested facts about Brown & Williamson's con-duct, it is not reasonable to conclude that Brown & Williamson threatened in a serious way to restrict output, raiseprices above a competitive level, and artificially slow thegrowth of the economy segment of the national cigarettemarket.To be sure, Liggett's economic expert explained Liggett'stheory of predatory price discrimination and testified thathe believed it created a reasonable possibility that Brown& Williamson could injure competition in the United Statescigarette market as a whole. App. 600-614. But this doesnot alter our analysis. When an expert opinion is not supported by sufficient facts to validate it in the eyes of the law,or when indisputable record facts contradict or otherwiserender the opinion unreasonable, it cannot support a jury'sverdict. Cf. J. Truett Payne Co., Inc., 451 U. S., at 564-565(referring to expert economic testimony not based on "documentary evidence as to the effect of the discrimination onretail prices" as "weak" at best). Expert testimony is usefulas a guide to interpreting market facts, but it is not a substitute for them. As we observed in Matsushita, "expert opinion evidence . . . has little probative value in comparison withthe economic factors" that may dictate a particular conclusion. 475 U. S., at 594, n. 19. Here, Liggett's expert basedhis opinion that Brown & Williamson had a reasonable prospect of recouping its predatory losses on three factors:Brown & Williamson's black and white pricing structure, cor509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT243Cite as: 509 U. S. 209 (1993)Stevens, J., dissentingporate documents showing an intent to shrink the price dif-ferential between generic and branded cigarettes, and evidence of below-cost pricing. App. 601-602. Because, as wehave explained, this evidence is insufficient as a matter oflaw to support a finding of primary-line injury under theRobinson-Patman Act, the expert testimony cannot sustainthe jury's verdict. IVWe understand that the chain of reasoning by which wehave concluded that Brown & Williamson is entitled to judgment as a matter of law is demanding. But a reasonablejury is presumed to know and understand the law, the factsof the case, and the realities of the market. We hold thatthe evidence cannot support a finding that Brown & Williamson's alleged scheme was likely to result in oligopolistic pricecoordination and sustained supracompetitive pricing in thegeneric segment of the national cigarette market. Withoutthis, Brown & Williamson had no reasonable prospect of recouping its predatory losses and could not inflict the injuryto competition the antitrust laws prohibit. The judgment ofthe Court of Appeals is Affirmed.Justice Stevens, with whom Justice White andJustice Blackmun join, dissenting.For a period of 18 months in 1984 and 1985, respondentBrown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation (B&W) waged aprice war against petitioner, known then as Liggett & Myers(Liggett). Liggett filed suit claiming that B&W's pricingpractices violated the Robinson-Patman Act.1 After a 115-1 "It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the courseof such commerce, either directly or indirectly, to discriminate in pricebetween different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality . . .where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessencompetition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or toinjure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT244 BROOKE GROUP LTD. v. BROWN & WILLIAMSONTOBACCO CORP.Stevens, J., dissentingday trial, the jury agreed, and awarded Liggett substantialdamages. The Court of Appeals, however, found that Liggett could not succeed on its claim, because B&W, as an independent actor controlling only 12% of the national cigarettemarket, could not injure competition. Liggett Group, Inc. v.Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 964 F. 2d 335, 340-342(CA4 1992).Today, the Court properly rejects that holding. See ante,at 229-230. Instead of remanding the case to the Court ofAppeals to resolve the other issues raised by the parties,however, the Court goes on to review portions of the voluminous trial record, and comes to the conclusion that the evidence does not support the jury's finding that B&W's pricediscrimination "had a reasonable possibility of injuring competition." 2 In my opinion the evidence is plainly sufficientto support that finding.or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them . . . ." 15 U. S. C. $ 13(a).2 The jury gave an affirmative answer to the following special issue:"1. Did Brown & Williamson engage in price discrimination that had areasonable possibility of injuring competition in the cigarette market as awhole in the United States?" App. 27.The jury made its finding after being instructed that "injury to competition" means "the injury to consumer welfare which results when a competitor is able to raise and to maintain prices in a market or well-definedsubmarket above competitive levels. In order to injure competition inthe cigarette market as a whole, Brown & Williamson must be able tocreate a real possibility of both driving out rivals by loss-creating pricecutting and then holding on to that advantage to recoup losses by raisingand maintaining prices at higher than competitive levels."You must remember that the Robinson-Patman Act was designed toprotect competition rather than just competitors and, therefore, injury tocompetition does not mean injury to a competitor. Liggett & Myers cannot satisfy this element simply by showing that they were injured byBrown & Williamson's conduct. To satisfy this element, Liggett & Myersmust show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Brown & Williamson'sconduct had a reasonable possibility of injuring competition in the cigarette market and not just a reasonable possibility of injuring a competitorin the cigarette market."

For decades, the industry has beenmarked by the same kind of supracompetitive pricing that ischaracteristic of the textbook monopoly.4 Without the ne-cessity of actual agreement among the six major manufacturers, "prices for cigarettes increased in lockstep, twice a year,for a number of years, irrespective of the rate of inflation,changes in the costs of production, or shifts in consumer de-mand."Ibid. Notwithstanding the controversy over thehealth effects of smoking and the increase in the federal excise tax, profit margins improved "handsomely" during theperiod between 1972 and 1983.53 As the majority notes, the procedural posture of this case requires thatwe view the evidence in the light most favorable to Liggett. Ante, at213. On review of a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the partyagainst whom the judgment is entered "must be given the benefit of everylegitimate inference that can be drawn from the evidence." See C.Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 2528, pp. 563-564(1971).4 When the Court states that "[s]ubstantial evidence suggests that inrecent decades, the industry reaped the benefits of prices above a competitive level," ante, at 213, I assume it accepts the proposition that a reasonable jury could find abnormally high prices characteristic of this industry.5 An internal B&W memorandum, dated May 15, 1984, states in part:"Manufacturer's price increases generally were below the rate of inflation but margins improved handsomely due to favorable leaf prices and509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:23 PAGES OPINPGT246 BROOKE GROUP LTD. v. BROWN & WILLIAMSONTOBACCO CORP.Stevens, J., dissentingThe early 1980's brought two new developments to the cigarette market. First, in 1980, when its share of the markethad declined to 2.3%, Liggett introduced a new line of generic cigarettes in plain black and white packages, offered atan effective price of approximately 30% less than brandedcigarettes. Ante, at 214. A B&W memorandum describedthis action as "the first time that a [cigarette] manufacturerhas used pricing as a strategic marketing weapon in the U. S.since the depression era." App. 128. This novel tacticproved successful; by 1984, Liggett's black and whites represented about 4% of the total market and generated substantial profits. The next development came in 1984, when R. J.Reynolds (RJR), the second largest company in the industry,"repositioned" one of its established brands, Doral, by sellingit at discount prices comparable to Liggett's black andwhites. App. 117-118; ante, at 215.B&W executives prepared a number of internal memoranda planning responses to these two market developments.See App. 120, 127, 157, 166. With respect to RJR, B&Wdecided to "follo[w] precisely the pathway" of that company,id., at 121, reasoning that "introduction of a branded genericby B&W now appears to be feasible as RJR has the cloutand sales force coverage to maintain the price on brandedgenerics," id., at 145. Accordingly, B&W planned to introduce a new "branded generic" of its own, known as Hallmark, to be sold at the same prices as RJR's Doral.

In 1982, the industry became much moreaggressive on the pricing front, fueled by a 100% increase in the FederalExcise Tax. Brown & Williamson's variable margin increased from$10.78/M in 1982 and [sic] to $12.61/M in 1983."The impact of these pricing activities on the smoking public was dramatic. The weighted average retail price of a pack of cigarettes increased56% between 1980 and 1983 (from $.63 to $.98)." App. 127.509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:23 PAGES OPINPGT247Cite as: 509 U. S. 209 (1993)Stevens, J., dissentingB&W took a more aggressive approach to Liggett's blackand whites. It decided to launch its own line of black andwhite cigarettes with the "[s]ame style array" and list priceas Liggett's, but with "[s]uperior discounts/allowances."Id., at 124. B&W estimated that its own black and whiteswould generate a "trading profit" of $5.1 million for the sec-ond half of 1984 and $43.6 million for 1985.Id., at 125. Atthe same time, however, B&W, anticipating "competitivecounterattacks," was "prepared to redistribute this entireamount in the form of additional trade allowances." Ibid.B&W's competitive stance was confined to Liggett; the memorandum outlining B&W's plans made no reference to thepossibility of countermoves by RJR, or to the use of B&W'strading profits to increase allowances on any product otherthan black and whites.This "dual approach" was designed to "provide B&W moreinfluence to manage up the prices of branded generics to improve profitability," id., at 123, and also the opportunity toparticipate in the economy market, with a view toward"manag[ing] down generic volume," id., at 109. Notwithstanding its ultimate aim to "limit generic segment growth,"id., at 113, B&W estimated an aggregate potential tradingprofit on black and whites of $342 million for 1984 to 1988,id., at 146. Though B&W recognized that it might be required to use "some or all of this potential trading profit" tomaintain its market position, it also believed that it wouldrecoup its losses as the segment became "more profitable,particularly as it approaches maturity." Ibid.B&W began to implement its plan even before it made itsfirst shipment of black and whites in July 1984, with a seriesof price announcements in June of that year. When B&Wannounced its first volume discount schedule for distributors,Liggett responded by increasing its own discounts. ThoughLiggett's discounts remained lower than B&W's, B&W responded in turn by increasing its rebates still further.After four or five moves and countermoves, the dust settled509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:23 PAGES OPINPGT248 BROOKE GROUP LTD. v.

Id., at 338-339.Assessing the pre-July 1984 evidence tending to prove thatB&W was motivated by anticompetitive intent, the DistrictCourt observed that the documentary evidence was "morevoluminous and detailed than any other reported case.

On June 21, B&Wincreased its rebate to $0.50, and a day later, Liggett went to $0.43. Afterthree more increases, B&W settled at $0.80 per carton, while Liggett remained at $0.73. See App. 327, 420-421.7 That quantity discounts are covered by the Act, and prohibited whenthey have the requisite effect on competition, has been firmly establishedsince our decision in FTC v.

Seesupra, at 247. To inflict this injury,B&W sustained a substantial loss. During the full 18-monthperiod, B&W's revenues ran consistently below its total variable costs, with an average deficiency of approximately $0.30per carton and a total loss on B&W black and whites of almost $15 million. App. 338-339. That B&W executiveswere willing to accept losses of this magnitude during theentire 18 months is powerful evidence of their belief thatprices ultimately could be "managed up" to a level that wouldallow B&W to recoup its investment.The AftermathAt the end of 1985, the list price of branded cigarettes was$33.15 per carton, and the list price of black and whites,$19.75 per carton.

The June 1989increases brought the price of branded cigarettes to $46.15per carton, and the price of black and whites to $33.75--anamount even higher than the price for branded cigaretteswhen the war ended in December 1985. Ibid.11 Becausethe rate of increase was higher on black and whites thanon brandeds, the price differential between the two types ofcigarettes narrowed,ibid., from roughly 40% in 1985 to 27%in 1989. See 964 F. 2d, at 338.The expert economist employed by Liggett testified thatthe post-1985 price increases were unwarranted by increasesin manufacturing or other costs, taxes, or promotional ex-penditures. App. 525. To be sure, some portion of the volume rebates granted distributors was passed on to consum-ers in the form of promotional activity, so that consumers didnot feel the full brunt of the price increases. Nevertheless,the record amply supports the conclusion that the post-1985price increases in list prices produced higher consumerprices, as well as higher profits for the manufacturers.12The legal question presented by this evidence is whetherthe facts as they existed during and at the close of the 18-month period, and all reasonable inferences to be drawn from11 It is also true that these same years, other major manufacturers entered the generic market and expanded their generic sales. Ante, at 217.Their entry is entirely consistent with the possibility that lockstep increases in the price of generics brought them to a level that was supracompetitive, though lower than that charged on branded cigarettes.12 "Q Does this mean that the price increases, which you testified arehappening twice a year, are used up in these consumer promotions?"A Not by any stretch of the imagination. Although there has been anincrease in the use of this type of promotional activity over the last fouror five years, the increase in that promotional activity has been far outstripped by the list price increases. The prices go up by a lot; the promotional activity, indeed, does go up. But the promotional activity has notgone up by anywhere near the magnitude of the list price increases. Further, those price increases are not warranted by increasing costs, sincethe manufacturing costs of making cigarettes have remained roughly constant over the last five years."

S. 209 (1993)Stevens, J., dissentingthose facts, see n. 3, supra, justified the finding by the jurythat B&W's discriminatory pricing campaign "had a reasonable possibility of injuring competition," see supra, at 244,and n. 2.IIThe Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, enacted in 1890, the Clay-ton Act, 38 Stat. 730, enacted in 1914, and the RobinsonPatman Act, which amended the Clayton Act in 1936, allserve the purpose of protecting competition. Because theyhave a common goal, the statutes are similar in many re-spects. All three prohibit the predatory practice of deliberately selling below cost to discipline a competitor, either todrive the competitor out of business or to raise prices to alevel that will enable the predator to recover its losses and,in the long run, earn additional profits. Sales below costand anticompetitive intent are elements of the violation ofall three statutes. Neither of those elements, however, is atissue in this case. See ante, at 231 (record contains sufficientevidence of anticompetitive intent and below-cost pricing).The statutes do differ significantly with respect to one ele-ment of the violation, the competitive consequences of predatory conduct. Even here, however, the three statutes haveone thing in common: Not one of them requires proof that apredatory plan has actually succeeded in accomplishing itsobjective. Section 1 of the Sherman Act requires proof of aconspiracy. It is the joint plan to restrain trade, however,and not its success, that is prohibited by $ 1. Nash v. UnitedStates, 229 U. S. 373, 378 (1913). Section 2 of the ShermanAct applies to independent conduct, and may be violatedwhen there is a "dangerous probability" that an attempt toachieve monopoly power will succeed.Swift & Co. v. UnitedStates, 196 U. S. 375, 396 (1905). The Clayton Act goes beyond the "dangerous probability" standard to cover pricediscrimination "where the effect of such discrimination maybe to substantially lessen competition or tend to create amonopoly in any line of commerce." $ 2, 38 Stat. 730.509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:23 PAGES OPINPGT252 BROOKE GROUP LTD. v.

No.1502, 74th Cong., 2d Sess., 4 (1936) (Act substantially broadens similar clause of Clayton Act).14 The Robinson-PatmanAct was designed to reach discriminations "in their incipiency, before the harm to competition is effected. It isenough that they `may' have the prescribed effect." CornProducts Refining Co. v. FTC, 324 U. S. 726, 738 (1945) (internal quotation marks omitted). Or, as the Report of theSenate Judiciary Committee on the proposed Act explained,"to catch the weed in the seed will keep it from coming toflower." S. Rep. No. 1502, at 4.Accordingly, our leading case concerning discriminatoryvolume rebates described the scope of the Act as follows:13 See text of statute, n. 1, supra.14 One of the purposes of broadening the Clayton Act's competitive injury language in the Robinson-Patman Act was to provide more effectiveprotection against predatory price cutting. As the Attorney General'sNational Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws explained in its 1955report:"In some circumstances, to be sure, injury to even a single competitorshould bring the Act into play. Predatory price cutting designed to eliminate a smaller business rival, for example, is a practice which inevitablyfrustrates competition by excluding competitors from the market or deliberately impairing their competitive strength. The invalidation of suchdeliberate price slashes for the purpose of destroying even a single competitor, moreover, accords distinct recognition to the narrower tests of`injury' added to the price discrimination provisions of the Clayton Actthrough the 1936 Robinson-Patman amendments. The discriminationprovisions in the original Clayton Act were feared by the legislators asinadequate to check the victimization of individual businessmen by predatory price cuts that nevertheless created no general impairment of competitive conditions in a wider market. To reach such destructive pricecuts endangering the survival of smaller rivals of a powerful seller was anexpress objective of the liberalizing amendments in the `injury' clause ofthe Robinson-Patman Act."

The statute requires no more thanthat the effect of the prohibited price discriminations`may be substantially to lessen competition . . . or toinjure, destroy, or prevent competition.' After a care-ful consideration of this provision of the RobinsonPatman Act, we have said that `the statute does not re-quire that the discrimination must in fact have harmedcompetition, but only that there is a reasonable possibil-ity that they "may" have such an effect.'Corn Products Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 324 U. S. 726, 742."FTC v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U. S. 37, 46 (1948).See also Falls City Industries, Inc. v. Vanco Beverage, Inc.,460 U. S. 428, 435 (1983) ("In keeping with the RobinsonPatman Act's prophylactic purpose, $ 2(a) does not requirethat the discriminations must in fact have harmed competition" (internal quotation marks omitted)).In this case, then, Liggett need not show any actual harmto competition, but only the reasonable possibility that suchharm would flow from B&W's conduct. The evidence presented supports the conclusion that B&W's price war wasintended to discipline Liggett for its unprecedented use ofprice competition in an industry that had enjoyed handsomesupracompetitive profits for about half a century. The evidence also demonstrates that B&W executives were confi-dent enough in the feasibility of their plan that they werewilling to invest millions of company dollars in its outcome.And all of this, of course, must be viewed against a background of supracompetitive, parallel pricing, in which "pricesfor cigarettes increased in lockstep, twice a year . . . irrespective of the rate of inflation, changes in the cost of production,or shifts in consumer demand," ante, at 213, bringing withthem dramatic increases in profit margins, see n. 5, supra.In this context, it is surely fair to infer that B&W's discipli509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:23 PAGES OPINPGT254 BROOKE GROUP LTD. v. BROWN & WILLIAMSONTOBACCO CORP.Stevens, J., dissentingnary program had a reasonable prospect of persuading Lig-gett to forgo its maverick price reductions and return to parallel pricing policies, and thus to restore the same kind ofsupracompetitive pricing that had characterized the industryin the past. When the facts are viewed in the light mostfavorable to Liggett, I think it clear that there is sufficientevidence in the record that the "reasonable possibility" ofcompetitive injury required by the statute actually existed.IIIAfter 115 days of trial, during which it considered 2,884exhibits, 85 deposition excerpts, and testimony from 23 livewitnesses, the jury deliberated for nine days and then re-turned a verdict finding that B&W engaged in price discrimination with a "reasonable possibility of injuring competi-tion." 748 F. Supp., at 348, n. 4; n. 2,supra. The Court'scontrary conclusion rests on a hodgepodge of legal, factual,and economic propositions that are insufficient, alone or to-gether, to overcome the jury's assessment of the evidence.First, as a matter of law, the Court reminds us that theRobinson-Patman Act is concerned with consumer welfareand competition, as opposed to protecting individual compet-itors from harm; "the antitrust laws were passed for the protection of competition, not competitors." See ante, at 224(internal quotations marks and emphasis omitted). For thatreason, predatory price cutting is not unlawful unless thepredator has a reasonable prospect of recouping his investment from supracompetitive profits. Ibid. The jury, ofcourse, was so instructed, see n. 2, supra, and no one questions that proposition here.As a matter of fact, the Court emphasizes the growth inthe generic segment following B&W's entry. As the Courtnotes, generics' expansion to over 12% of the total marketby 1988 exceeds B&W's own forecast that the segment wouldgrow to only about 10%, assuming no entry by B&W.Ante,at 234. What these figures do not do, however, is answer the509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:23 PAGES OPINPGT255Cite as: 509 U. S. 209 (1993)Stevens, J., dissentingrelevant question: whether the prices of generic cigarettesduring the late 1980's were competitive or supracompetitive.On this point, there is ample, uncontradicted evidence thatthe list prices on generic cigarettes, as well as the prices onbranded cigarettes, rose regularly and significantly duringthe late 1980's, in a fashion remarkably similar to the pricechange patterns that characterized the industry in the 1970'swhen supracompetitive, oligopolistic pricing admittedly prevailed. See supra, at 245; ante, at 213. Given its knowl-edge of the industry's history of parallel pricing, I think thejury plainly was entitled to draw an inference that these in-creased prices were supracompetitive.The Court responds to this evidence dismissively, suggest-ing that list prices have no bearing on the question becausepromotional activities of the cigarette manufacturers mayhave offset such price increases. Ante, at 235-236. Thatresponse is insufficient for three reasons. First, the promo-tions to which the majority refers related primarily tobranded cigarettes; accordingly, while they narrowed the dif-ferential between branded prices and black and white prices,they did not reduce the consumer price of black and whites.See 33 Tr. 208-210. Second, the Court's speculation is inconsistent with record evidence that the semiannual listprice increases were not offset by consumer promotions.See n. 12, supra. See also ante, at 218 ("at least some por-tion of the list price increase was reflected in a higher netprice to the consumer"). Finally, to the extent there is adispute regarding the effect of promotional activities on consumer prices for generics, the jury presumably resolved thatdispute in Liggett's favor, and the Court's contrary speculation is an insufficient basis for setting aside that verdict.1515 In finding an absence of actual supracompetitive pricing, the Courtalso relies on the testimony of Liggett executives, who stated that industry prices were fair. Illustrative is the following exchange:"Q I want to know--yes or no--sir, whether or not you say that theprice you charged for branded cigarettes, which is the same price you say509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:23 PAGES OPINPGT256 BROOKE GROUP LTD. v.

This is true, however, onlyso long as reduced prices do not fall below cost, as thecases cited by the majority make clear.16 When a predatordeliberately engages in below-cost pricing targeted at a particular competitor over a sustained period of time, thenprice cutting raises a credible inference that harm to compeeverybody else charged, was a fair and equitable price for that product tothe American consumer."A It's what the industry set, and based on that it's a fair price."App. 396.The problem with this testimony, and testimony like it, is that it relatesto the period before the price war, as well as after, see id., at 392, whenthere is no real dispute but that prices were supracompetitive. ("[T]heprofits in the cigarette industry are the best of any industry I've beenassociated with, very much so." Ibid.) Some of the testimony cited bythe Court, for instance, is that of an outside director who served only from1977 or 1978 until 1980, see 64 Tr. 51-56, cited ante, at 237; his belief in thecompetitiveness of his industry must be viewed against the "[s]ubstantialevidence suggest[ing] that in recent decades, the industry reaped the benefits of prices above a competitive level" to which the majority itself refers,ante, at 213.The jury was, of course, entitled to discount the probative force of testimony from executives to the effect that there was no collusion amongtobacco manufacturers, App. 397-398, and that they had appeared beforea congressional committee to vouch for the competitive nature of theirindustry, id., at 623-631. The jury was also free to give greater weightto the documentary evidence presented, the inferences to be drawn therefrom, and the testimony of experts who agreed with the textbook characterization of the industry. See App. 640-645; R. Tennant, American Cigarette Industry 342 (1950).16 In Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., 495 U. S. 328, 339-340(1990), for example, we noted that low prices benefit consumers "so longas they are above predatory levels." In Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U. S. 104, 118 (1986), we recognized that price cutting of apredatory nature is "inimical" to competition, and limited our approvingcomments to pricing that is "above some measure of incremental costs."Id., at 117-118, and n. 12 (internal quotation marks omitted).509us1u104 05-04-97 17:18:23 PAGES OPINPGT257Cite as: 509 U.

Though it has rejected asomewhat stronger version of this proposition as a rule ofdecision, see ante, at 229-230, the Court comes back to thesame economic theory, relying on the supposition that an "anticompetitive minuet is most difficult to compose and to per-form, even for a disciplined oligopoly,"ante, at 228. Seeante, at 238-243 (implausibility of tacit coordination amongcigarette oligopolists in 1980's).

See ante, at 233-237 (finding absence of actualsupracompetitive pricing), 238-243 (finding absence of evidence suggesting actual coordination). In my opinion, thejury was entitled to infer from the succession of price increases after 1985--when the prices for branded and genericcigarettes increased every six months from $33.15 and $19.75,respectively, to $46.15 and $33.75--that B&W's below-costpricing actually produced supracompetitive prices, with thehelp of tacit collusion among the players. See supra, at 255.But even if that were not so clear, the jury would surely beentitled to infer that B&W's predatory plan, in which itinvested millions of dollars for the purpose of achieving anadmittedly anticompetitive result, carried a "reasonablepossibility" of injuring competition.Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.509us2105K 05-04-97 17:29:13 PAGES OPINPGT259OCTOBER TERM, 1992SyllabusBUCKLEY v. FITZSIMMONS et al.certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuitNo. 91-7849. Argued February 22, 1993--Decided June 24, 1993Petitioner Buckley sought damages, under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, from respondent prosecutors for fabricating evidence during the preliminaryinvestigation of a highly publicized rape and murder in Illinois and making false statements at a press conference announcing the return of anindictment against him. He claimed that when three separate lab studies failed to make a reliable connection between a bootprint at the murder site and his boots, respondents obtained a positive identificationfrom one Robbins, who allegedly was known for her willingness to fabricate unreliable expert testimony. Thereafter, they convened a grandjury for the sole purpose of investigating the murder, and 10 monthslater, respondent Fitzsimmons, the State's Attorney, announced the indictment at the news conference. Buckley was arrested and, unable tomeet the bond, held in jail. Robbins provided the principal evidenceagainst him at trial, but the jury was unable to reach a verdict. WhenRobbins died before Buckley's retrial, all charges were dropped and hewas released after three years of incarceration. In the $ 1983 action,the District Court held that respondents were entitled to absolute immunity for the fabricated evidence claim but not for the press conferenceclaim. However, the Court of Appeals ruled that they had absoluteimmunity on both claims, theorizing that prosecutors are entitled to absolute immunity when out-of-court acts cause injury only to the extenta case proceeds in court, but are entitled only to qualified immunity ifthe constitutional wrong is complete before the case begins. On remand from this Court, it found that nothing in Burns v. Reed, 500 U. S.478--in which the Court held that prosecutors had absolute immunityfor their actions in participating in a probable-cause hearing but not ingiving advice to the police--undermined its initial holding.Held: Respondents are not entitled to absolute immunity. Pp. 267-278.(a) Certain immunities were so well established when $ 1983 was enacted that this Court presumes that Congress would have specificallyso provided had it wished to abolish them. Most public officials areentitled only to qualified immunity. However, sometimes their actionsfit within a common-law tradition of absolute immunity. Whether theydo is determined by the nature of the function performed, not the identity of the actor who performed it, Forrester v. White, 484 U. S. 219, 229,509us2105K 05-04-97 17:29:13 PAGES OPINPGT260 BUCKLEY v. FITZSIMMONSSyllabusand it is available for conduct of prosecutors that is "intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process." Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 430. Pp. 267-271.(b) Acts undertaken by a prosecutor in preparing for the initiation ofjudicial proceedings or for trial, and which occur in the course of his roleas an advocate for the State, are entitled to the protections of absoluteimmunity. However, in endeavoring to determine whether the bootprint had been made by Buckley, respondents were acting not as advocates but as investigators searching for clues and corroboration thatmight give them probable cause to recommend an arrest. Such activities were not immune from liability at common law. If performed bypolice officers and detectives, such actions would be entitled to onlyqualified immunity; the same immunity applies to prosecutors performing those actions. Convening a grand jury to consider the evidencetheir work produced does not retroactively transform that work fromthe administrative into the prosecutorial. Pp. 271-276.(c) Fitzsimmons' statements to the media also are not entitled to absolute immunity. There was no common-law immunity for prosecutor'sout-of-court statements to the press, and, under Imbler, such commentshave no functional tie to the judicial process just because they are madeby a prosecutor. Nor do policy considerations support extending absolute immunity to press statements, since this Court has no license toestablish immunities from $ 1983 actions in the interests of what itjudges to be sound public policy, and since the presumption is that qualified, rather than absolute, immunity is sufficient to protect governmentofficials in the exercise of their duties.

S. 259 (1993)Opinion of the Courtwere Solicitor General Starr, Assistant Attorney GeneralGerson, and Deputy Solicitor General Mahoney.*Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.In an action brought under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, petitionerseeks damages from respondent prosecutors for allegedlyfabricating evidence during the preliminary investigation ofa crime and making false statements at a press conferenceannouncing the return of an indictment. The questions pre-sented are whether respondents are absolutely immune fromliability on either or both of these claims.As the case comes to us, we have no occasion to considerwhether some or all of respondents' conduct may be pro-tected by qualified immunity. Moreover, we make two important assumptions about the case: first, that petitioner'sallegations are entirely true; and, second, that they allegeconstitutional violations for which $ 1983 provides a remedy.Our statement of facts is therefore derived entirely frompetitioner's complaint and is limited to matters relevant torespondents' claim to absolute immunity.IPetitioner commenced this action on March 4, 1988, follow-ing his release from jail in Du Page County, Illinois. He hadbeen incarcerated there for three years on charges growingout of the highly publicized murder of Jeanine Nicarico, an11-year-old child, on February 25, 1983. The complaintnamed 17 defendants, including Du Page County, its sheriffand seven of his assistants, two expert witnesses and theestate of a third, and the five respondents.Respondent Fitzsimmons was the duly elected Du PageCounty State's Attorney from the time of the Nicarico*Michael D.

FITZSIMMONSOpinion of the Courtmurder through December 1984, when he was succeededby respondent Ryan, who had defeated him in a Republicanprimary election on March 21, 1984. Respondent Knightwas an assistant state's attorney under Fitzsimmons andserved as a special prosecutor in the Nicarico case underRyan. Respondents Kilander (who came into office withRyan) and King were assistant prosecutors, also assigned tothe case.The theory of petitioner's case is that in order to obtainan indictment in a case that had engendered "extensive publicity" and "intense emotions in the community," the prosecutors fabricated false evidence, and that in order to gain votes,Fitzsimmons made false statements about petitioner in apress conference announcing his arrest and indictment 12days before the primary election. Petitioner claims thatrespondents' misconduct created a "highly prejudicial andinflamed atmosphere" that seriously impaired the fairness ofthe judicial proceedings against an innocent man and causedhim to suffer a serious loss of freedom, mental anguish, andhumiliation.The fabricated evidence related to a bootprint on the doorof the Nicarico home apparently left by the killer when hekicked in the door. After three separate studies by expertsfrom the Du Page County Crime Lab, the Illinois Department of Law Enforcement, and the Kansas Bureau of Identification, all of whom were unable to make a reliable connection between the print and a pair of boots that petitionerhad voluntarily supplied, respondents obtained a "positiveidentification" from one Louise Robbins, an anthropologist inNorth Carolina who was allegedly well known for her willingness to fabricate unreliable expert testimony. Her opinion was obtained during the early stages of the investigation,which was being conducted under the joint supervision anddirection of the sheriff and respondent Fitzsimmons, whose509us2105K 05-04-97 17:29:14 PAGES OPINPGT263Cite as: 509 U.

Specifically, Sheriff's detectives,including defendants Wilkosz and Kurzawa, at the direction and under thesupervision, and sometimes in the presence and with the assistance ofDefendants Knight, King, Soucek and Lepic, repeatedly interrogated alleged suspects, including Plaintiff Buckley and Alex Hernandez, who werenot represented by counsel. Despite intense pressure and intimidation,Plaintiff Buckley steadfastly maintained his innocence and demonstratedno knowledge of the crime, while Hernandez told such wild and palpablyfalse stories that his mental instability was obvious to the Defendants."33) As a result of these interrogations, at least one experienced Sheriff's detective who participated[,] concluded that Buckley and Hernandezwere not involved in the Nicarico crime. This conclusion was buttressedby his general knowledge of the bootprint `evidence.'"34) He repeatedly communicated his conclusion, and its basis, to theDefendants named herein, including Defendants Doria, Knight, King,Soucek, Lepic, and Wilkosz."35) Unable to solve the case, Defendants Doria, Fitzsimmons, Knightand King convened a special Du Page County `investigative' grand jury,devoted solely to investigating the Nicarico case."

After an 8-month investigation,during which the grand jury heard the testimony of over 100witnesses, including the bootprint experts, it was still unableto return an indictment. On January 27, 1984, respondentFitzsimmons admitted in a public statement that there wasinsufficient evidence to indict anyone for the rape and murder of Jeanine Nicarico. Although no additional evidencewas obtained in the interim, the indictment was returned inMarch, when Fitzsimmons held the defamatory press confer-ence so shortly before the primary election. Petitioner wasthen arrested, and because he was unable to meet the bond(set at $3 million), he was held in jail.Petitioner's trial began 10 months later, in January 1985.The principal evidence against him was provided by Robbins, the North Carolina anthropologist. Because the jurywas unable to reach a verdict on the charges against petitioner, the trial judge declared a mistrial. Petitioner re-mained in prison for two more years, during which a thirdparty confessed to the crime and the prosecutors preparedfor petitioner's retrial. After Robbins died, however, allcharges against him were dropped. He was released, andfiled this action.IIWe are not concerned with petitioner's actions against thepolice officers (who have asserted the defense of qualifiedimmunity), against the expert witnesses (whose trial testi-mony was granted absolute immunity by the District Court,App. 53-57), and against Du Page County (whose motion todismiss on other grounds was granted in part, id., at 57-61).At issue here is only the action against the prosecutors, whomoved to dismiss based on their claim to absolute immunity.The District Court held that respondents were entitled toabsolute immunity for all claims except the claim againstFitzsimmons based on his press conference. Id., at 53.With respect to the claim based on the alleged fabrication ofevidence, the District Court framed the question as whether509us2105K 05-04-97 17:29:14 PAGES OPINPGT265Cite as: 509 U. S. 259 (1993)Opinion of the Courtthe effort "to obtain definitive boot evidence linking [peti-tioner to the crime] was in the nature of acquisition ofevidence or in the nature of evaluation of evidence for thepurpose of initiating the criminal process." Id., at 45.The Court concluded that it "appears" that it was moreevaluative than acquisitive.Both petitioner and Fitzsimmons appealed, and a dividedpanel of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruledthat the prosecutors had absolute immunity on both claims.Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 919 F. 2d 1230 (1990). In theCourt of Appeals' view, "damages remedies are unnecessary," id., at 1240, when "[c]ourts can curtail the costs ofprosecutorial blunders . . . by cutting short the prosecutionor mitigating its effects," id., at 1241. Thus, when "out-of-court acts cause injury only to the extent a case proceeds"in court, id., at 1242, the prosecutor is entitled to absoluteimmunity and "the defendant must look to the court in whichthe case pends to protect his interests,"id., at 1241. Bycontrast, if "a constitutional wrong is complete before thecase begins," the prosecutor is entitled only to qualified im-munity.Id., at 1241-1242. Applying this unprecedentedtheory to petitioner's allegations, the Court of Appeals con-cluded that neither the press conference nor the fabricatedevidence caused any constitutional injury independent of theindictment and trial.Id., at 1243, 1244.22 With respect to an issue not before us, petitioner's claims that he wassubject to coercive interrogations by some of the respondent prosecutors,the court found that the extent of immunity depended on the nature ofthose claims. The court reasoned that, because claims based on Mirandav. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), and the Self-Incrimination Clause of theFifth Amendment depend on what happens at trial, prosecutors are entitled to absolute immunity for those claims; by contrast, only qualified immunity is available against petitioner's claims as to "coercive tactics thatare independently wrongful." 919 F. 2d, at 1244. Because it could notcharacterize the nature of those claims, the court remanded for furtherproceedings concerning Fitzsimmons, King, and Knight on this issue. Id.,at 1245.509us2105K 05-04-97 17:29:14 PAGES OPINPGT266 BUCKLEY v. FITZSIMMONSOpinion of the CourtJudge Fairchild dissented in part. He agreed with theDistrict Court that Fitzsimmons was entitled only to qualified immunity for his press statements. He noted that themajority had failed to examine the particular function thatFitzsimmons was performing, and concluded that conductinga press conference was not among "the functions that entitlejudges and prosecutors in the judicial branch to absolute immunity." Id., at 1246 (opinion dissenting in part and concur-ring in part). Responding directly to the majority's reasoning, he wrote:"It is true that procedures afforded in our system ofjustice give a defendant a good chance to avoid such re-sults of prejudicial publicity as excessive bail, difficultyor inability of selecting an impartial jury, and the like.These procedures reduce the cost of impropriety by aprosecutor, but I do not find that the courts have recog-nized their availability as a sufficient reason for conferring immunity." Ibid.We granted Buckley's petition for certiorari, vacated thejudgment, and remanded the case for further proceedings inlight of our intervening decision inBurns v. Reed, 500 U. S.478 (1991). 502 U. S. 801 (1991). On remand, the samepanel, again divided, reaffirmed its initial decision, with onemodification not relevant here. 952 F. 2d 965 (CA7 1992)(per curiam). The Court of Appeals held that "[n]othing inBurns undermine[d]" its initial holding that prosecutors areabsolutely immune for "normal preparatory steps"; unlikethe activities at issue inBurns, "[t]alking with (willing) experts is trial preparation." 952 F. 2d, at 966-967. In similar fashion, the court adhered to its conclusion that Fitzsimmons was entitled to absolute immunity for conducting thepress conference. The court recognized that the press conference bore some similarities to the conduct in Burns (advising the police as to the propriety of an arrest). It did nottake place in court, and it was not part of the prosecutor's509us2105K 05-04-97 17:29:14 PAGES OPINPGT267Cite as: 509 U. S. 259 (1993)Opinion of the Courttrial preparation. 952 F. 2d, at 967. The difference, accord-ing to the court, is that "[a]n arrest causes injury whether ornot a prosecution ensues," whereas the only constitutionalinjury caused by the press conference depends on judicialaction. Ibid.Judge Fairchild again dissented. He adhered to his earlier conclusion that Fitzsimmons was entitled to only quali-fied immunity for the press conference, but he was alsopersuaded that Burns had drawn a line between " `conductclosely related to the judicial process' " and conduct in therole of " `administrator or investigative officer.' " He agreedthat trial preparation falls on the absolute immunity side ofthat line, but felt otherwise about the search for favorableevidence that might link the bootprint to petitioner during"a year long pre-arrest and pre-indictment investigation"aggressively supervised by Fitzsimmons. 952 F. 2d, at969 (opinion dissenting in part).We granted certiorari for a second time, limited to issuesrelating to prosecutorial immunity. 506 U. S. 814 (1992).3We now reverse.IIIThe principles applied to determine the scope of immunityfor state officials sued under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, as amended,3 Although petitioner also alleged that respondents violated his constitutional rights in presenting the fabricated evidence to the grand jury andhis trial jury, see App. 10-11, 14-15, we are not presented with any question regarding those claims. The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court, see id., at 45-47, and held that those actions were protectedby absolute immunity. Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 919 F. 2d 1230, 1243(CA7 1990) ("The selection of evidence to present to the grand jurors, andthe manner of questioning witnesses, can no more be the basis of liabilitythan may the equivalent activities before the petit jury"). That decisionwas made according to traditional principles of absolute immunity under$ 1983, however, and did not depend on the original, injury-focused theoryof absolute prosecutorial immunity with which we are concerned here;nor was it included within the questions presented in petitioner's petitionfor certiorari.509us2105K 05-04-97 17:29:14 PAGES OPINPGT268 BUCKLEY v. FITZSIMMONSOpinion of the Court42 U. S. C. $ 1983, are by now familiar. Section 1983 on itsface admits of no defense of official immunity. It subjects toliability "[e]very person" who, acting under color of state law,commits the prohibited acts. In Tenney v. Brandhove, 341U. S. 367, 376 (1951), however, we held that Congress didnot intend $ 1983 to abrogate immunities "well grounded inhistory and reason." Certain immunities were so well established in 1871, when $ 1983 was enacted, that "we presume that Congress would have specifically so provided hadit wished to abolish" them. Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S. 547,554-555 (1967). See also Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453U. S. 247, 258 (1981). Although we have found immunitiesin $ 1983 that do not appear on the face of the statute, "[w]edo not have a license to establish immunities from $ 1983actions in the interests of what we judge to be sound public policy." Tower v. Glover, 467 U. S. 914, 922-923 (1984)."[O]ur role is to interpret the intent of Congress in enacting$ 1983, not to make a freewheeling policy choice." Malley v.Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 342 (1986).Since Tenney, we have recognized two kinds of immunitiesunder $ 1983. Most public officials are entitled only to qualified immunity. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 807(1982); Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S. 478, 508 (1978). Underthis form of immunity, government officials are not subject todamages liability for the performance of their discretionaryfunctions when "their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known." Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457U. S., at 818. In most cases, qualified immunity is sufficientto "protect officials who are required to exercise their discretion and the related public interest in encouraging the vigorous exercise of official authority." Butz v. Economou, 438U. S., at 506.We have recognized, however, that some officials perform"special functions" which, because of their similarity to func509us2105K 05-04-97 17:29:14 PAGES OPINPGT269Cite as: 509 U. S. 259 (1993)Opinion of the Courttions that would have been immune when Congress enacted$ 1983, deserve absolute protection from damages liability.Id., at 508. "[T]he official seeking absolute immunity bearsthe burden of showing that such immunity is justified forthe function in question." Burns v. Reed, 500 U. S., at 486;Antoine v. Byers & Anderson, Inc., 508 U. S. 429, 432, andn. 4 (1993). Even when we can identify a common-law tradition of absolute immunity for a given function, we have considered "whether $ 1983's history or purposes nonethelesscounsel against recognizing the same immunity in $ 1983actions." Tower v. Glover, 467 U. S., at 920. Not surprisingly, we have been "quite sparing" in recognizing absoluteimmunity for state actors in this context. Forrester v.White, 484 U. S. 219, 224 (1988).In determining whether particular actions of governmentofficials fit within a common-law tradition of absolute immunity, or only the more general standard of qualified immunity,we have applied a "functional approach," see, e. g., Burns,500 U. S., at 486, which looks to "the nature of the functionperformed, not the identity of the actor who performed it,"Forrester v. White, 484 U. S., at 229. We have twice appliedthis approach in determining whether the functions of contemporary prosecutors are entitled to absolute immunity.In Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409 (1976), we held thata state prosecutor had absolute immunity for the initiationand pursuit of a criminal prosecution, including presentationof the State's case at trial. Noting that our earlier caseshad been "predicated upon a considered inquiry into the immunity historically accorded the relevant official at commonlaw and the interests behind it," id., at 421, we focused onthe functions of the prosecutor that had most often invitedcommon-law tort actions. We concluded that the commonlaw rule of immunity for prosecutors was "well settled" andthat "the same considerations of public policy that underliethe common-law rule likewise countenance absolute immu509us2105K 05-04-97 17:29:14 PAGES OPINPGT270 BUCKLEY v. FITZSIMMONSOpinion of the Courtnity under $ 1983." Id., at 424. Those considerations 4 sup-ported a rule of absolute immunity for conduct of prosecutorsthat was "intimately associated with the judicial phase ofthe criminal process."Id., at 430. In concluding that "ininitiating a prosecution and in presenting the State's case,the prosecutor is immune from a civil suit for damages under$ 1983," we did not attempt to describe the line between aprosecutor's acts in preparing for those functions, some ofwhich would be absolutely immune, and his acts of investigation or "administration," which would not. Id., at 431, andn. 33.We applied the Imbler analysis two Terms ago in Burnsv.Reed, 500 U. S. 478 (1991). There the $ 1983 suit challenged two acts by a prosecutor: (1) giving legal advice tothe police on the propriety of hypnotizing a suspect and onwhether probable cause existed to arrest that suspect, and(2) participating in a probable-cause hearing. We held thatonly the latter was entitled to absolute immunity. Immunity for that action under $ 1983 accorded with the commonlaw absolute immunity of prosecutors and other attorneysfor eliciting false or defamatory testimony from witnesses orfor making false or defamatory statements during, and related to, judicial proceedings. Id., at 489-490; id., at 501(Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in4 In particular, we expressed concern that fear of potential liabilitywould undermine a prosecutor's performance of his duties by forcing himto consider his own potential liability when making prosecutorial decisionsand by diverting his "energy and attention . . . from the pressing duty ofenforcing the criminal law." Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S., at 424-425.Suits against prosecutors would devolve into "a virtual retrial of the criminal offense of a new forum," id., at 425, and would undermine the vigorousenforcement of the law by providing a prosecutor an incentive not "to goforward with a close case where an acquittal likely would trigger a suitagainst him for damages," id., at 426, and n. 24. We also expressed concern that the availability of a damages action might cause judges to bereluctant to award relief to convicted defendants in post-trial motions.Id., at 427.509us2105K 05-04-97 17:29:14 PAGES OPINPGT271Cite as: 509 U. S. 259 (1993)Opinion of the Courtpart). Under that analysis, appearing before a judge andpresenting evidence in support of a motion for a search warrant involved the prosecutor's " `role as advocate for theState.' " Id., at 491, quoting Imbler, 424 U. S., at 431, n. 33.Because issuance of a search warrant is a judicial act, appear-ance at the probable-cause hearing was " `intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process,' " Burns,500 U. S., at 492, quotingImbler, 424 U. S., at 430.We further decided, however, that prosecutors are notentitled to absolute immunity for their actions in giving legaladvice to the police. We were unable to identify any historical or common-law support for absolute immunity in theperformance of this function. 500 U. S., at 492-493. Wealso noted that any threat to the judicial process from "theharassment and intimidation associated with litigation"based on advice to the police was insufficient to overcome the"[a]bsen[ce] [of] a tradition of immunity comparable to thecommon-law immunity from malicious prosecution, whichformed the basis for the decision inImbler." Id., at 493, 494.And though we noted that several checks other than civillitigation prevent prosecutorial abuses in advising the police,"one of the most important checks, the judicial process," willnot be effective in all cases, especially when in the end thesuspect is not prosecuted.Id., at 496. In sum, we heldthat providing legal advice to the police was not a function"closely associated with the judicial process." Id., at 495.IVIn this case the Court of Appeals held that respondentsare entitled to absolute immunity because the injuries suffered by petitioner occurred during criminal proceedings.That holding is contrary to the approach we have consistently followed since Imbler. As we have noted, the Imblerapproach focuses on the conduct for which immunity isclaimed, not on the harm that the conduct may have causedor the question whether it was lawful. The location of the509us2105K 05-04-97 17:29:14 PAGES OPINPGT272 BUCKLEY v. FITZSIMMONSOpinion of the Courtinjury may be relevant to the question whether a complainthas adequately alleged a cause of action for damages (a question that this case does not present, see supra, at 261). Itis irrelevant, however, to the question whether the conductof a prosecutor is protected by absolute immunity. Accord-ingly, although the Court of Appeals' reasoning may be relevant to the proper resolution of issues that are not before us,it does not provide an acceptable basis for concluding thateither the preindictment fabrication of evidence or the post-indictment press conference was a function protected byabsolute immunity. We therefore turn to consider each ofrespondents' claims of absolute immunity.AWe first address petitioner's argument that the prosecu-tors are not entitled to absolute immunity for the claim thatthey conspired to manufacture false evidence that would linkhis boot with the bootprint the murderer left on the frontdoor. To obtain this false evidence, petitioner submits, theprosecutors shopped for experts until they found one whowould provide the opinion they sought. App. 7-9. At thetime of this witness shopping the assistant prosecutors wereworking hand in hand with the sheriff 's detectives underthe joint supervision of the sheriff and State's attorneyFitzsimmons.Petitioner argues thatImbler's protection for a prosecu-tor's conduct "in initiating a prosecution and in presentingthe State's case," 424 U. S., at 431, extends only to the act ofinitiation itself and to conduct occurring in the courtroom.This extreme position is plainly foreclosed by our opinion inImbler itself. We expressly stated that "the duties of theprosecutor in his role as advocate for the State involve actions preliminary to the initiation of a prosecution and ac-tions apart from the courtroom," and are nonetheless entitled to absolute immunity. Id., at 431, n. 33. We noted inparticular that an out-of-court "effort to control the presen509us2105K 05-04-97 17:29:14 PAGES OPINPGT273Cite as: 509 U. S. 259 (1993)Opinion of the Courttation of [a] witness' testimony" was entitled to absolute im-munity because it was "fairly within [the prosecutor's] function as an advocate." Id., at 430, n. 32. To be sure, Burnsmade explicit the point we had reserved inImbler, 424 U. S.,at 430-431, and n. 33: A prosecutor's administrative dutiesand those investigatory functions that do not relate to anadvocate's preparation for the initiation of a prosecution orfor judicial proceedings are not entitled to absolute immu-nity. SeeBurns, 500 U. S., at 494-496. We have not retreated, however, from the principle that acts undertaken bya prosecutor in preparing for the initiation of judicial proceedings or for trial, and which occur in the course of his roleas an advocate for the State, are entitled to the protectionsof absolute immunity. Those acts must include the professional evaluation of the evidence assembled by the police andappropriate preparation for its presentation at trial or beforea grand jury after a decision to seek an indictment hasbeen made.On the other hand, as the function test of Imbler recognizes, the actions of a prosecutor are not absolutely immunemerely because they are performed by a prosecutor. Qualified immunity " `represents the norm' " for executive officers,Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S., at 340, quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 807, so when a prosecutor "functions asan administrator rather than as an officer of the court" he isentitled only to qualified immunity. Imbler, 424 U. S., at431, n. 33. There is a difference between the advocate's rolein evaluating evidence and interviewing witnesses as he prepares for trial, on the one hand, and the detective's role insearching for the clues and corroboration that might givehim probable cause to recommend that a suspect be arrested,on the other hand. When a prosecutor performs the investigative functions normally performed by a detective or policeofficer, it is "neither appropriate nor justifiable that, for thesame act, immunity should protect the one and not theother." Hampton v. Chicago, 484 F. 2d 602, 608 (CA7 1973)509us2105K 05-04-97 17:29:14 PAGES OPINPGT274 BUCKLEY v. FITZSIMMONSOpinion of the Court(internal quotation marks omitted), cert. denied, 415 U. S.917 (1974). Thus, if a prosecutor plans and executes a raidon a suspected weapons cache, he "has no greater claim tocomplete immunity than activities of police officers allegedlyacting under his direction." 484 F. 2d, at 608-609.The question, then, is whether the prosecutors have carried their burden of establishing that they were functioningas "advocates" when they were endeavoring to determinewhether the bootprint at the scene of the crime had beenmade by petitioner's foot. A careful examination of the allegations concerning the conduct of the prosecutors during theperiod before they convened a special grand jury to investigate the crime provides the answer. See supra, at 263, n. 1.The prosecutors do not contend that they had probable causeto arrest petitioner or to initiate judicial proceedings duringthat period. Their mission at that time was entirely investigative in character. A prosecutor neither is, nor should consider himself to be, an advocate before he has probable causeto have anyone arrested.55 Of course, a determination of probable cause does not guarantee aprosecutor absolute immunity from liability for all actions taken afterwards. Even after that determination, as the opinion dissenting in partpoints out, post, at 290, a prosecutor may engage in "police investigativework" that is entitled to only qualified immunity.Furthermore, there is no "true anomaly," post, at 286, in denying absolute immunity for a state actor's investigative acts made before there isprobable cause to have a suspect arrested just because a prosecutor wouldbe entitled to absolute immunity for the malicious prosecution of someonewhom he lacked probable cause to indict. That criticism ignores the essence of the function test. The reason that lack of probable cause allowsus to deny absolute immunity to a state actor for the former function(fabrication of evidence) is that there is no common-law tradition of immunity for it, whether performed by a police officer or prosecutor. The reason that we grant it for the latter function (malicious prosecution) is thatwe have found a common-law tradition of immunity for a prosecutor's decision to bring an indictment, whether he has probable cause or not. Byinsisting on an equation of the two functions merely because a prosecutor509us2105K 05-04-97 17:29:14 PAGES OPINPGT275Cite as: 509 U. S. 259 (1993)Opinion of the CourtIt was well after the alleged fabrication of false evidenceconcerning the bootprint that a special grand jury was empaneled. And when it finally was convened, its immediatepurpose was to conduct a more thorough investigation of thecrime--not to return an indictment against a suspect whomthere was already probable cause to arrest. Buckley wasnot arrested, in fact, until 10 months after the grand jury hadbeen convened and had finally indicted him. Under thesecircumstances, the prosecutors' conduct occurred well beforethey could properly claim to be acting as advocates. Respondents have not cited any authority that supports an argumentthat a prosecutor's fabrication of false evidence during thepreliminary investigation of an unsolved crime was immunefrom liability at common law, either in 1871 or at any datebefore the enactment of $ 1983. It therefore remains pro-tected only by qualified immunity.After Burns, it would be anomalous, to say the least, togrant prosecutors only qualified immunity when offeringlegal advice to police about an unarrested suspect, but thento endow them with absolute immunity when conducting investigative work themselves in order to decide whether asuspect may be arrested.6 That the prosecutors later calledmight be subject to liability for one but not the other, the dissent allows itsparticular policy concerns to erase the function test it purports to respect.In general, the dissent's distress over the denial of absolute immunityfor prosecutors who fabricate evidence regarding unsolved crimes, post,at 283-285, like the holding of the Court of Appeals, seems to conflate thequestion whether a $ 1983 plaintiff has stated a cause of action with thequestion whether the defendant is entitled to absolute immunity for hisactions.6 Cf. Burns v. Reed, 500 U. S. 478, 495 (1991): "Indeed, it is incongruousto allow prosecutors to be absolutely immune from liability for giving advice to the police, but to allow police officers only qualified immunity forfollowing the advice. . . . Almost any action by a prosecutor, including hisor her direct participation in purely investigative activity, could be said tobe in some way related to the ultimate decision whether to prosecute, butwe have never indicated that absolute immunity is that expansive." Ifthe police, under the guidance of the prosecutors, had solicited the alleg509us2105K 05-04-97 17:29:14 PAGES OPINPGT276 BUCKLEY v. FITZSIMMONSOpinion of the Courta grand jury to consider the evidence this work produceddoes not retroactively transform that work from the administrative into the prosecutorial.7 A prosecutor may not shieldhis investigative work with the aegis of absolute immunitymerely because, after a suspect is eventually arrested, in-dicted, and tried, that work may be retrospectively describedas "preparation" for a possible trial; every prosecutor mightthen shield himself from liability for any constitutionalwrong against innocent citizens by ensuring that they go totrial. When the functions of prosecutors and detectives arethe same, as they were here, the immunity that protectsthem is also the same.BWe next consider petitioner's claims regarding Fitzsim-mons' statements to the press. Petitioner alleged that, during the prosecutor's public announcement of the indictment,Fitzsimmons made false assertions that numerous pieces ofevidence, including the bootprint evidence, tied Buckley to aburglary ring that committed the Nicarico murder. App. 12.Petitioner also alleged that Fitzsimmons released mug shotsof him to the media, "which were prominently and repeatedlydisplayed on television and in the newspapers."Ibid. Petiedly "fabricated" testimony, of course, they would not be entitled to anything more than qualified immunity.7 See Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 431, n. 33 (1976): "Preparation,both for the initiation of the criminal process and for a trial, may requirethe obtaining, reviewing, and evaluating of evidence. At some point, andwith respect to some decisions, the prosecutor no doubt functions as anadministrator rather than as an officer of the court. Drawing a properline between these functions may present difficult questions, but this casedoes not require us to anticipate them." Although the respondents relyon the first sentence of this passage to suggest that a prosecutor's actionsin "obtaining, reviewing, and evaluating" evidence are always protectedby absolute immunity, the sentence that follows qualifies that suggestion.It confirms that some of these actions may fall on the administrative,rather than the judicial, end of the prosecutor's activities, and thereforebe entitled only to qualified immunity.509us2105K 05-04-97 17:29:14 PAGES OPINPGT277Cite as: 509 U. S. 259 (1993)Opinion of the Courttioner's legal theory is that "[t]hese false and prejudicialstatements inflamed the populace of DuPage County against"him, ibid.; see also id., at 14, thereby defaming him, resultingin deprivation of his right to a fair trial, and causing the juryto deadlock rather than acquit, id., at 19.Fitzsimmons' statements to the media are not entitled toabsolute immunity. Fitzsimmons does not suggest that in1871 there existed a common-law immunity for a prosecutor's, or attorney's, out-of-court statement to the press. TheCourt of Appeals agreed that no such historical precedentexists. 952 F. 2d, at 967. Indeed, while prosecutors, likeall attorneys, were entitled to absolute immunity from defamation liability for statements made during the courseof judicial proceedings and relevant to them, see Burns,500 U. S., at 489-490; Imbler, 424 U. S., at 426, n. 23; id., at439 (White, J., concurring in judgment), most statementsmade out of court received only good-faith immunity. Thecommon-law rule was that "[t]he speech of a counsel is privileged by the occasion on which it is spoken . . . ." Flint v.Pike, 4 Barn. & Cress. 473, 478, 107 Eng. Rep. 1136, 1138(K. B. 1825) (Bayley, J.).8The functional approach of Imbler, which conforms to thecommon-law theory, leads us to the same conclusion. Com-ments to the media have no functional tie to the judicial process just because they are made by a prosecutor. At the8 "[Absolute immunity] does not apply to or include any publication ofdefamatory matter before the commencement, or after the termination ofthe judicial proceeding (unless such publication is an act incidental to theproper initiation thereof, or giving legal effect thereto); nor does it applyto or include any publication of defamatory matter to any person otherthan those to whom, or in any place other than that in which, such publication is required or authorized by law to be made for the proper conductof the judicial proceedings." Veeder, Absolute Immunity in Defamation:Judicial Proceedings, 9 Colum. L. Rev. 463, 489 (1909) (footnotes omitted).See, e. g., Viosca v. Landfried, 140 La. 610, 615, 73 So. 698, 700 (1916);Youmans v.

FITZSIMMONSOpinion of the Courtpress conference, Fitzsimmons did not act in " `his role asadvocate for the State,' " Burns v. Reed, 500 U. S., at 491,quoting Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S., at 431, n. 33. Theconduct of a press conference does not involve the initiationof a prosecution, the presentation of the State's case in court,or actions preparatory for these functions. Statements tothe press may be an integral part of a prosecutor's job, seeNational District Attorneys Assn., National ProsecutionStandards 107, 110 (2d ed. 1991), and they may serve a vitalpublic function. But in these respects a prosecutor is in nodifferent position than other executive officials who deal withthe press, and, as noted,supra, at 268, 277, qualified immu-nity is the norm for them.Fitzsimmons argues nonetheless that policy considerationssupport extending absolute immunity to press statements.Brief for Respondents 30-33. There are two responses tohis submissions. First, "[w]e do not have a license to establish immunities from $ 1983 actions in the interests of whatwe judge to be sound public policy."Tower v. Glover, 467U. S., at 922-923. When, as here, the prosecutorial functionis not within the advocate's role and there is no historicaltradition of immunity on which we can draw, our inquiry isat an end. Second, "[t]he presumption is that qualifiedrather than absolute immunity is sufficient to protect government officials in the exercise of their duties." Burns v.Reed, 500 U. S., at 486-487. Even if policy considerationsallowed us to carve out new absolute immunities to liabilityfor constitutional wrongs under $ 1983, we see little reasonto suppose that qualified immunity would provide adequateprotection to prosecutors in their provision of legal advice tothe police, seeid., at 494-496, yet would fail to provide suffi-cient protection in the present context.99 The Circuits other than the Seventh Circuit that have addressed thisissue have applied only qualified immunity to press statements, see, e. g.,Powers v. Coe, 728 F. 2d 97, 103 (CA2 1984); Marrero v. Hialeah, 625 F. 2d499, 506-507 (CA5 1980), cert. denied, 450 U. S. 913 (1981); Gobel v. Mari509us2105K 05-04-97 17:29:14 PAGES OPINPGT279Cite as: 509 U.

App. 9-11, 19.The precise contours of these claims are unclear, and theywere not addressed below; we leave them to be passed on inthe first instance by the Court of Appeals on remand.As we have stated, supra, at 261, 264, 265, n. 2, petitionerdoes not challenge many aspects of the Court of Appeals'decision, and we have not reviewed them; they remain undisturbed by this opinion. As to the two challenged rulings onabsolute immunity, however, the judgment of the UnitedStates Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistentwith this opinion.
