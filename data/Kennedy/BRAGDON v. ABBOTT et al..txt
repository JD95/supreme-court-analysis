We address in this case the application of the Americanswith Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 104 Stat. 327, 42 U. S. C.$ 12101 et seq., to persons infected with the human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV). We granted certiorari to review,first, whether HIV infection is a disability under the ADAwhen the infection has not yet progressed to the so-calledsymptomatic phase; and, second, whether the Court of Ap-peals, in affirming a grant of summary judgment, cited sufficient material in the record to determine, as a matter of law,that respondent's infection with HIV posed no direct threatto the health and safety of her treating dentist. 522 U.

Petitioner completed a dentalexamination, discovered a cavity, and informed respondentof his policy against filling cavities of HIV-infected patients.He offered to perform the work at a hospital with no addedfee for his services, though respondent would be responsiblefor the cost of using the hospital's facilities. Respondentdeclined.Respondent sued petitioner under state law and $ 302 ofthe ADA, 104 Stat. 355, 42 U. S. C. $ 12182, alleging discrimi-nation on the basis of her disability. The state-law claimsare not before us. Section 302 of the ADA provides:"No individual shall be discriminated against on thebasis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of thegoods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or ac-commodations of any place of public accommodation byany person who . . . operates a place of public accommo-dation." $ 12182(a).The term "public accommodation" is defined to include the"professional office of a health care provider." $ 12181(7)(F).A later subsection qualifies the mandate not to discrimi-nate. It provides:"Nothing in this subchapter shall require an entity topermit an individual to participate in or benefit from thegoods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages andaccommodations of such entity where such individualposes a direct threat to the health or safety of others."$ 12182(b)(3).The United States and the Maine Human Rights Commis-sion intervened as plaintiffs. After discovery, the partiesfiled cross-motions for summary judgment. The DistrictCourt ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, holding that respondent's HIV infection satisfied the ADA's definition of disabil-ity. 912 F. Supp. 580, 585-587 (Me. 1995). The court heldfurther that petitioner raised no genuine issue of materialfact as to whether respondent's HIV infection would have524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN630 BRAGDON v. ABBOTTOpinion of the Courtposed a direct threat to the health or safety of others during the course of a dental treatment. Id., at 587-591. Thecourt relied on affidavits submitted by Dr. Donald WayneMarianos, Director of the Division of Oral Health of theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). TheMarianos affidavits asserted it is safe for dentists to treatpatients infected with HIV in dental offices if the dentistfollows the so-called universal precautions described in theRecommended Infection-Control Practices for Dentistryissued by CDC in 1993 (1993 CDC Dentistry Guidelines).912 F. Supp., at 589.The Court of Appeals affirmed. It held respondent's HIVinfection was a disability under the ADA, even though herinfection had not yet progressed to the symptomatic stage.107 F. 3d 934, 939-943 (CA1 1997). The Court of Appealsalso agreed that treating the respondent in petitioner's officewould not have posed a direct threat to the health and safetyof others. Id., at 943-948. Unlike the District Court, however, the Court of Appeals declined to rely on the Marianosaffidavits. Id., at 946, n. 7. Instead the court relied on the1993 CDC Dentistry Guidelines, as well as the Policy onAIDS, HIV Infection and the Practice of Dentistry, promulgated by the American Dental Association in 1991 (1991American Dental Association Policy on HIV). 107 F. 3d, at945-946.IIWe first review the ruling that respondent's HIV infectionconstituted a disability under the ADA. The statute definesdisability as:"(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities ofsuch individual;"(B) a record of such an impairment; or"(C) being regarded as having such an impairment."$ 12102(2).524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN631Cite as: 524 U. S. 624 (1998)Opinion of the CourtWe hold respondent's HIV infection was a disability undersubsection (A) of the definitional section of the statute. Inlight of this conclusion, we need not consider the applicabilityof subsections (B) or (C).Our consideration of subsection (A) of the definition proceeds in three steps. First, we consider whether respondent's HIV infection was a physical impairment. Second, weidentify the life activity upon which respondent relies (reproduction and childbearing) and determine whether it constitutes a major life activity under the ADA. Third, tying thetwo statutory phrases together, we ask whether the impairment substantially limited the major life activity. In construing the statute, we are informed by interpretations ofparallel definitions in previous statutes and the views of various administrative agencies which have faced this interpretive question.AThe ADA's definition of disability is drawn almost verbatim from the definition of "handicapped individual" includedin the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 87 Stat. 361, as amended,29 U. S. C. $ 706(8)(B) (1988 ed.), and the definition of "handicap" contained in the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988,102 Stat. 1619, 42 U. S. C. $ 3602(h)(1) (1988 ed.). Congress'repetition of a well-established term carries the implication that Congress intended the term to be construed in accordance with pre-existing regulatory interpretations. SeeFDIC v. Philadelphia Gear Corp., 476 U. S. 426, 437-438(1986); Commissioner v. Estate of Noel, 380 U. S. 678, 681-682 (1965); ICC v. Parker, 326 U. S. 60, 65 (1945). In thiscase, Congress did more than suggest this construction; itadopted a specific statutory provision in the ADA directingas follows:"Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, nothingin this chapter shall be construed to apply a lesserstandard than the standards applied under title V of the524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN632 BRAGDON v. ABBOTTOpinion of the CourtRehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U. S. C. 790 et seq.) or theregulations issued by Federal agencies pursuant to suchtitle." 42 U. S. C. $ 12201(a).The directive requires us to construe the ADA to grant atleast as much protection as provided by the regulationsimplementing the Rehabilitation Act.1The first step in the inquiry under subsection (A) requiresus to determine whether respondent's condition constituted aphysical impairment. The Department of Health, Educationand Welfare (HEW) issued the first regulations interpretingthe Rehabilitation Act in 1977. The regulations are ofparticular significance because, at the time, HEW was theagency responsible for coordinating the implementation andenforcement of $ 504 of that statute.Consolidated RailCorporation v. Darrone, 465 U. S. 624, 634 (1984) (citingExec. Order No. 11914, 3 CFR 117 (1976-1980 Comp.)). Sec-tion 504 prohibits discrimination against individuals withdisabilities by recipients of federal financial assistance. 29U. S. C. $ 794. The HEW regulations, which appear withoutchange in the current regulations issued by the Departmentof Health and Human Services, define "physical or mentalimpairment" to mean:"(A) any physiological disorder or condition, cosmeticdisfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or moreof the following body systems: neurological; musculo-skeletal; special sense organs; respiratory, includingspeech organs; cardiovascular; reproductive, digestive,genito-urinary; hemic and lymphatic; skin; and endocrine; or"(B) any mental or psychological disorder, such asmental retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotionalor mental illness, and specific learning disabilities." 45CFR $ 84.3( j)(2)(i) (1997).524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN633Cite as: 524 U. S. 624 (1998)Opinion of the CourtIn issuing these regulations, HEW decided against includinga list of disorders constituting physical or mental impairments, out of concern that any specific enumeration mightnot be comprehensive. 42 Fed. Reg. 22685 (1977), reprintedin 45 CFR pt. 84, App. A, p. 334 (1997). The commentaryaccompanying the regulations, however, contains a repre-sentative list of disorders and conditions constituting physical impairments, including "such diseases and conditions asorthopedic, visual, speech, and hearing impairments, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis,cancer, heart disease, diabetes, mental retardation, emotional illness, and . . . drug addiction and alcoholism." Ibid.In 1980, the President transferred responsibility for theimplementation and enforcement of $ 504 to the AttorneyGeneral. See, e. g., Exec. Order No. 12250, 3 CFR 298(1981). The regulations issued by the Justice Department,which remain in force to this day, adopted verbatim theHEW definition of physical impairment quoted above. 28CFR $ 41.31(b)(1) (1997). In addition, the representative listof diseases and conditions originally relegated to the commentary accompanying the HEW regulations were incorporated into the text of the regulations. Ibid.HIV infection is not included in the list of specific disorders constituting physical impairments, in part because HIVwas not identified as the cause of AIDS until 1983. SeeBarre' -Sinoussi et al., Isolation of a T-Lymphotropic Retrovirus from a Patient at Risk for Acquired Immune DeficiencySyndrome (AIDS), 220 Science 868 (1983); Gallo et al., Frequent Detection and Isolation of Cytopathic Retroviruses(HTLV-III) from Patients with AIDS and at Risk for AIDS,224 Science 500 (1984); Levy et al., Isolation of Lymphocytopathic Retroviruses from San Francisco Patients with AIDS,225 Science 840 (1984). HIV infection does fall well withinthe general definition set forth by the regulations, however.The disease follows a predictable and, as of today, an unalterable course. Once a person is infected with HIV, the524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN634 BRAGDON v. ABBOTTOpinion of the Courtvirus invades different cells in the blood and in body tissues.Certain white blood cells, known as helper T-lymphocytes orCD4` cells, are particularly vulnerable to HIV. The virusattaches to the CD4 receptor site of the target cell and fusesits membrane to the cell's membrane. HIV is a retrovirus,which means it uses an enzyme to convert its own geneticmaterial into a form indistinguishable from the genetic material of the target cell. The virus' genetic material migratesto the cell's nucleus and becomes integrated with the cell'schromosomes. Once integrated, the virus can use the cell'sown genetic machinery to replicate itself. Additional copiesof the virus are released into the body and infect other cellsin turn. Young, The Replication Cycle of HIV-1, in TheAIDS Knowledge Base, pp. 3.1-2 to 3.1-7 (P. Cohen, M.Sande, & P.

CD4`cells play a critical role in coordinating the body's immuneresponse system, and the decline in their number causescorresponding deterioration of the body's ability to fight infections from many sources. Tracking the infected individual's CD4` cell count is one of the most accurate measures ofthe course of the disease.

Osmond, Classification and Staging of HIVDisease, in AIDS Knowledge Base 1.1-8; Saag, Clinical Spectrum of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Diseases, in AIDS:Etiology 204.The initial stage of HIV infection is known as acuteor primary HIV infection. In a typical case, this stagelasts three months. The virus concentrates in the blood.The assault on the immune system is immediate. The vic-tim suffers from a sudden and serious decline in the number of white blood cells. There is no latency period.Mononucleosis-like symptoms often emerge between six daysand six weeks after infection, at times accompanied by fever,headache, enlargement of the lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), muscle pain (myalgia), rash, lethargy, gastrointestinaldisorders, and neurological disorders. Usually these symptoms abate within 14 to 21 days. HIV antibodies appearin the bloodstream within 3 weeks; circulating HIV can bedetected within 10 weeks.

The term is a misnomer, in some respects, for clinical features persist throughout, includinglymphadenopathy, dermatological disorders, oral lesions, andbacterial infections. Although it varies with each individual, in most instances this stage lasts from 7 to 11 years.The virus now tends to concentrate in the lymph nodes,though low levels of the virus continue to appear in theblood.

ABBOTTOpinion of the Courtthought the virus became inactive during this period, but itis now known that the relative lack of symptoms is attributable to the virus' migration from the circulatory system intothe lymph nodes. Cohen & Volberding, AIDS KnowledgeBase 4.1-4. The migration reduces the viral presence inother parts of the body, with a corresponding diminution inphysical manifestations of the disease. The virus, however,thrives in the lymph nodes, which, as a vital point of thebody's immune response system, represents an ideal environment for the infection of other CD4` cells. Staprans &Feinberg, Medical Management of AIDS 33-34. Studieshave shown that viral production continues at a high rate.Cohen & Volberding, AIDS Knowledge Base 4.1-4; Staprans & Feinberg, Medical Management of AIDS 38.

Inmost cases, once the patient's CD4` count drops below 10524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN637Cite as: 524 U. S. 624 (1998)Opinion of the Courtcells/mm3, death soon follows. Cohen & Volberding, AIDSKnowledge Base 4.1-9; Saag, AIDS: Etiology 207-209.In light of the immediacy with which the virus begins todamage the infected person's white blood cells and the severity of the disease, we hold it is an impairment from the mo-ment of infection. As noted earlier, infection with HIVcauses immediate abnormalities in a person's blood, and theinfected person's white cell count continues to drop throughout the course of the disease, even when the attack is concen-trated in the lymph nodes. In light of these facts, HIV infection must be regarded as a physiological disorder with aconstant and detrimental effect on the infected person'shemic and lymphatic systems from the moment of infection.HIV infection satisfies the statutory and regulatory definition of a physical impairment during every stage of thedisease.2The statute is not operative, and the definition not satis-fied, unless the impairment affects a major life activity. Respondent's claim throughout this case has been that the HIVinfection placed a substantial limitation on her ability to reproduce and to bear children. App. 14; 912 F. Supp., at 586;107 F. 3d, at 939. Given the pervasive, and invariably fatal,course of the disease, its effect on major life activities ofmany sorts might have been relevant to our inquiry. Respondent and a number of amici make arguments aboutHIV's profound impact on almost every phase of the infectedperson's life. See Brief for Respondent Abbott 24-27; Brieffor American Medical Association as Amicus Curiae 20;Brief for Infectious Diseases Society of America et al. asAmici Curiae 7-11. In light of these submissions, it mayseem legalistic to circumscribe our discussion to the activityof reproduction. We have little doubt that had differentparties brought the suit they would have maintained that anHIV infection imposes substantial limitations on other majorlife activities.524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN638 BRAGDON v. ABBOTTOpinion of the CourtFrom the outset, however, the case has been treated asone in which reproduction was the major life activity limitedby the impairment. It is our practice to decide cases on thegrounds raised and considered in the Court of Appeals andincluded in the question on which we granted certiorari.See, e. g., Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U. S. 329, 340, n. 3 (1997)(citing this Court's Rule 14.1(a));Capitol Square Review andAdvisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, 760 (1995). We ask,then, whether reproduction is a major life activity.We have little difficulty concluding that it is. As theCourt of Appeals held, "[t]he plain meaning of the word`major' denotes comparative importance" and "suggest[s]that the touchstone for determining an activity's inclusionunder the statutory rubric is its significance." 107 F. 3d, at939, 940. Reproduction falls well within the phrase "majorlife activity." Reproduction and the sexual dynamics surrounding it are central to the life process itself.While petitioner concedes the importance of reproduction,he claims that Congress intended the ADA only to coverthose aspects of a person's life which have a public, economic,or daily character. Brief for Petitioner 14, 28, 30, 31; seealso id., at 36-37 (citing Krauel v. Iowa Methodist MedicalCenter, 95 F. 3d 674, 677 (CA8 1996)). The argument founders on the statutory language. Nothing in the definitionsuggests that activities without a public, economic, or dailydimension may somehow be regarded as so unimportant orinsignificant as to fall outside the meaning of the word"major." The breadth of the term confounds the attempt tolimit its construction in this manner.As we have noted, the ADA must be construed to be consistent with regulations issued to implement the Rehabilitation Act. See 42 U. S. C. $ 12201(a). Rather than enunciating a general principle for determining what is and is not amajor life activity, the Rehabilitation Act regulations insteadprovide a representative list, defining the term to include"functions such as caring for one's self, performing manual524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN639Cite as: 524 U. S. 624 (1998)Opinion of the Courttasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learn-ing, and working." 45 CFR $ 84.3( j)(2)(ii) (1997); 28 CFR$ 41.31(b)(2) (1997). As the use of the term "such as" con-firms, the list is illustrative, not exhaustive.These regulations are contrary to petitioner's attempt tolimit the meaning of the term "major" to public activities.The inclusion of activities such as caring for one's self andperforming manual tasks belies the suggestion that a taskmust have a public or economic character in order to be amajor life activity for purposes of the ADA. On the contrary, the Rehabilitation Act regulations support the inclu-sion of reproduction as a major life activity, since reproduction could not be regarded as any less important thanworking and learning. Petitioner advances no credible basisfor confining major life activities to those with a public, eco-nomic, or daily aspect. In the absence of any reason toreach a contrary conclusion, we agree with the Court of Ap-peals' determination that reproduction is a major life activityfor the purposes of the ADA.3The final element of the disability definition in subsection(A) is whether respondent's physical impairment was a substantial limit on the major life activity she asserts. The Re-habilitation Act regulations provide no additional guidance.45 CFR pt. 84, App. A, p. 334 (1997).Our evaluation of the medical evidence leads us to concludethat respondent's infection substantially limited her abilityto reproduce in two independent ways. First, a woman infected with HIV who tries to conceive a child imposes on theman a significant risk of becoming infected. The cumulativeresults of 13 studies collected in a 1994 textbook on AIDSindicates that 20% of male partners of women with HIVbecame HIV-positive themselves, with a majority of thestudies finding a statistically significant risk of infection.Osmond & Padian, Sexual Transmission of HIV, in AIDS524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN640 BRAGDON v.

(1992) (cumulative results of 16 studies indi-cated 25% risk of female-to-male transmission). (Studies report a similar, if not more severe, risk of male-to-femaletransmission. See, e. g., Osmond & Padian, AIDS Knowl-edge Base 1.9-3, tbl. 1, 1.9-6 to 1.9-7.)Second, an infected woman risks infecting her child duringgestation and childbirth,i. e., perinatal transmission. Petitioner concedes that women infected with HIV face about a25% risk of transmitting the virus to their children. 107F. 3d, at 942; 912 F. Supp., at 587, n. 6. Published reportsavailable in 1994 confirm the accuracy of this statistic. Report of a Consensus Workshop, Maternal Factors Involved inMother-to-Child Transmission of HIV-1, 5 J. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes 1019, 1020 (1992) (collecting 13studies placing risk between 14% and 40%, with most studiesfalling within the 25% to 30% range); Connor et al., Reduction of Maternal-Infant Transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 with Zidovudine Treatment, 331 NewEngland J. Med. 1173, 1176 (1994) (placing risk at 25.5%); seealso Staprans & Feinberg, Medical Management of AIDS 32(studies report 13% to 45% risk of infection, with average ofapproximately 25%).Petitioner points to evidence in the record suggesting thatantiretroviral therapy can lower the risk of perinatal transmission to about 8%. App. 53; see also Connor, supra, at1176 (8.3%); Sperling et al., Maternal Viral Load, ZidovudineTreatment, and the Risk of Transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 from Mother to Infant, 335 NewEngland J. Med. 1621, 1622 (1996) (7.6%). The United Statesquestions the relevance of the 8% figure, pointing to regulatory language requiring the substantiality of a limitation to be assessed without regard to available mitigatingmeasures. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 18,n. 10 (citing 28 CFR pt. 36, App. B, p. 611 (1997); 29 CFR pt.524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN641Cite as: 524 U. S. 624 (1998)Opinion of the Court1630, App., p. 351 (1997)). We need not resolve this disputein order to decide this case, however. It cannot be said asa matter of law that an 8% risk of transmitting a dread andfatal disease to one's child does not represent a substantiallimitation on reproduction.The Act addresses substantial limitations on major life ac-tivities, not utter inabilities. Conception and childbirth arenot impossible for an HIV victim but, without doubt, aredangerous to the public health. This meets the definition ofa substantial limitation. The decision to reproduce carrieseconomic and legal consequences as well. There are addedcosts for antiretroviral therapy, supplemental insurance, andlong-term health care for the child who must be examinedand, tragic to think, treated for the infection. The laws ofsome States, moreover, forbid persons infected with HIV tohave sex with others, regardless of consent. Iowa Code$$ 139.1, 139.31 (1997); Md. Health Code Ann. $ 18-601.1(a)(1994); Mont.

Code $ 12.1-20-17 (1997).In the end, the disability definition does not turn on personal choice. When significant limitations result from theimpairment, the definition is met even if the difficulties arenot insurmountable. For the statistical and other reasonswe have cited, of course, the limitations on reproduction maybe insurmountable here. Testimony from the respondentthat her HIV infection controlled her decision not to have achild is unchallenged. App. 14; 912 F. Supp., at 587; 107F. 3d, at 942. In the context of reviewing summary judgment, we must take it to be true. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(e).We agree with the District Court and the Court of Appealsthat no triable issue of fact impedes a ruling on the questionof statutory coverage. Respondent's HIV infection is aphysical impairment which substantially limits a major lifeactivity, as the ADA defines it. In view of our holding, we524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN642 BRAGDON v. ABBOTTOpinion of the Courtneed not address the second question presented, i. e.,whether HIV infection is a per se disability under the ADA.BOur holding is confirmed by a consistent course of agencyinterpretation before and after enactment of the ADA.Every agency to consider the issue under the RehabilitationAct found statutory coverage for persons with asymptomaticHIV. Responsibility for administering the RehabilitationAct was not delegated to a single agency, but we need notpause to inquire whether this causes us to withhold defer-ence to agency interpretations underChevron U. S. A. Inc.v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837,844 (1984). It is enough to observe that the well-reasonedviews of the agencies implementing a statute "constitute abody of experience and informed judgment to which courtsand litigants may properly resort for guidance."Skidmorev. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 139-140 (1944).One comprehensive and significant administrative prece-dent is a 1988 opinion issued by the Office of Legal Counselof the Department of Justice (OLC) concluding that the Re-habilitation Act "protects symptomatic and asymptomaticHIV-infected individuals against discrimination in any cov-ered program." Application of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act to HIV-Infected Individuals, 12 Op. Off. LegalCounsel 264, 264-265 (Sept. 27, 1988) (preliminary print)(footnote omitted). Relying on a letter from Surgeon Gen-eral C. Everett Koop stating that, "from a purely scientificperspective, persons with HIV are clearly impaired" evenduring the asymptomatic phase, OLC determined asymptomatic HIV was a physical impairment under the Rehabilita-tion Act because it constituted a "physiological disorder orcondition affecting the hemic and lymphatic systems." Id.,at 271 (internal quotation marks omitted). OLC determinedfurther that asymptomatic HIV imposed a substantial limiton the major life activity of reproduction. The opinion said:524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN643Cite as: 524 U. S. 624 (1998)Opinion of the Court"Based on the medical knowledge available to us, we be-lieve that it is reasonable to conclude that the life activity of procreation . . . is substantially limited for anasymptomatic HIV-infected individual. In light of thesignificant risk that the AIDS virus may be transmittedto a baby during pregnancy, HIV-infected individualscannot, whether they are male or female, engage in theact of procreation with the normal expectation of bringing forth a healthy child." Id., at 273.In addition, OLC indicated that "[t]he life activity of engag-ing in sexual relations is threatened and probably substantially limited by the contagiousness of the virus." Id., at274. Either consideration was sufficient to render asymptomatic HIV infection a handicap for purposes of the Rehabili-tation Act. In the course of its opinion, OLC considered,and rejected, the contention that the limitation could be dis-counted as a voluntary response to the infection. The limitation, it reasoned, was the infection's manifest physical ef-fect.Id., at 274, and n. 13. Without exception, the otheragencies to address the problem before enactment of theADA reached the same result.

We are aware of no instanceprior to the enactment of the ADA in which a court oragency ruled that HIV infection was not a handicap underthe Rehabilitation Act.Had Congress done nothing more than copy the Rehabilitation Act definition into the ADA, its action would indicate524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN645Cite as: 524 U. S. 624 (1998)Opinion of the Courtthe new statute should be construed in light of this unwavering line of administrative and judicial interpretation. All indications are that Congress was well aware of the positiontaken by OLC when enacting the ADA and intended to givethat position its active endorsement. H. R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, p. 52 (1990) (endorsing the analysis and conclusionof the OLC opinion); id., pt. 3, at 28, n. 18 (same); S. Rep. No.101-116, pp. 21, 22 (1989) (same). As noted earlier, Congressalso incorporated the same definition into the Fair HousingAmendments Act of 1988. See 42 U. S. C. $ 3602(h)(1). Wefind it significant that the implementing regulations issuedby the Department of Housing and Urban Development(HUD) construed the definition to include infection withHIV. 54 Fed. Reg. 3232, 3245 (1989) (codified at 24 CFR$ 100.201 (1997)); see also In re Williams, 2A P-H FairHousing-Fair Lending || 25,007, pp. 25,111-25,113 (HUD Off.Admin. Law Judges, Mar. 22, 1991) (adhering to this interpretation); In re Elroy R. and Dorothy Burns Trust, 2AP-H Fair Housing-Fair Lending || 25,073, p. 25,678 (HUD Off.Admin. Law Judges, June 17, 1994) (same). Again the legislative record indicates that Congress intended to ratifyHUD's interpretation when it reiterated the same definitionin the ADA. H. R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, at 50; id., pt. 3,at 27; id., pt. 4, at 36; S. Rep. No. 101-116, at 21.We find the uniformity of the administrative and judicialprecedent construing the definition significant. When administrative and judicial interpretations have settled themeaning of an existing statutory provision, repetition of thesame language in a new statute indicates, as a general matter, the intent to incorporate its administrative and judicialinterpretations as well. See, e. g., Lorillard v. Pons, 434U. S. 575, 580-581 (1978). The uniform body of administrative and judicial precedent confirms the conclusion we reachtoday as the most faithful way to effect the congressionaldesign.524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN646 BRAGDON v. ABBOTTOpinion of the CourtCOur conclusion is further reinforced by the administrativeguidance issued by the Justice Department to implement thepublic accommodation provisions of Title III of the ADA.As the agency directed by Congress to issue implementingregulations, see 42 U. S. C. $ 12186(b), to render technical as-sistance explaining the responsibilities of covered individualsand institutions, $ 12206(c), and to enforce Title III in court,$ 12188(b), the Department's views are entitled to deference.See Chevron, 467 U. S., at 844.The Justice Department's interpretation of the definitionof disability is consistent with our analysis. The regulationsacknowledge that Congress intended the ADA's definition ofdisability to be given the same construction as the definitionof handicap in the Rehabilitation Act. 28 CFR $ 36.103(a)(1997); id., pt. 36, App. B, pp. 608, 609. The regulatory defi-nition developed by HEW to implement the RehabilitationAct is incorporated verbatim in the ADA regulations.$ 36.104. The Justice Department went further, however.It added "HIV infection (symptomatic and asymptomatic)"to the list of disorders constituting a physical impairment.$ 36.104(1)(iii). The technical assistance the Department hasissued pursuant to 42 U. S. C. $ 12206 similarly concludes thatpersons with asymptomatic HIV infection fall within theADA's definition of disability. See, e. g., U. S. Dept. of Justice, Civil Rights Division, The Americans with DisabilitiesAct: Title III Technical Assistance Manual 9 (Nov. 1993); Response to Congressman Sonny Callahan, 5 Nat. Disability L.Rep. (LRP) || 360, p. 1167 (Feb. 9, 1994); Response to A. Laurence Field, 5 Nat. Disability L. Rep. (LRP) || 21, p. 80 (Sept.10, 1993). Any other conclusion, the Department reasoned,would contradict Congress' affirmative ratification of the ad-ministrative interpretations given previous versions of thesame definition. 28 CFR pt. 36, App. B, pp. 609, 610 (1997)(citing the OLC opinion and HUD regulations); 56 Fed. Reg.7455, 7456 (1991) (same) (notice of proposed rulemaking).524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN647Cite as: 524 U. S. 624 (1998)Opinion of the CourtWe also draw guidance from the views of the agencies authorized to administer other sections of the ADA.See 42 U. S. C. $ 12116 (authorizing EEOC to issue regulations implementing Title I); $ 12134(a) (authorizing the Attorney General to issue regulations implementing the publicservices provisions of Title II, subtitle A); $$ 12149, 12164,12186 (authorizing the Secretary of Transportation to issueregulations implementing the transportation-related provisions of Titles II and III); $ 12206(c) (authorizing the sameagencies to offer technical assistance for the provisions theyadminister). These agencies, too, concluded that HIV infection is a physical impairment under the ADA. 28 CFR$ 35.104(1)(iii) (1997); 49 CFR $$ 37.3, 38.3 (1997); 56 Fed.Reg. 13858 (1991); U. S. Dept. of Justice, Civil Rights Division, The Americans with Disabilities Act: Title II TechnicalAssistance Manual 4 (Nov. 1993); EEOC, A Technical Assistance Manual on the Employment Provisions (Title I) of theAmericans with Disabilities Act II-3 (Jan. 1992) (hereinafterEEOC Technical Assistance Manual); EEOC InterpretiveManual $ 902.2(d), pp. 902-13 to 902-14 (reissued Mar. 14,1995) (hereinafter EEOC Interpretive Manual), reprinted in2 BNA EEOC Compliance Manual 902:0013 (1998). Mostcategorical of all is EEOC's conclusion that "an individualwho has HIV infection (including asymptomatic HIV infection) is an individual with a disability." EEOC InterpretiveManual $ 902.4(c)(1), p. 902-21; accord, id., $ 902.2(d), p. 902-14, n. 18. In the EEOC's view, "impairments . . . such asHIV infection, are inherently substantially limiting." 29CFR pt. 1630, App., p. 350 (1997); EEOC Technical Assistance Manual II-4; EEOC Interpretive Manual $ 902.4(c)(1),p. 902-21.The regulatory authorities we cite are consistent with ourholding that HIV infection, even in the so-called asymptomatic phase, is an impairment which substantially limits themajor life activity of reproduction.524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN648 BRAGDON v. ABBOTTOpinion of the CourtIIIThe petition for certiorari presented three other questionsfor review. The questions stated:"3. When deciding under title III of the ADA whethera private health care provider must perform invasiveprocedures on an infectious patient in his office, shouldcourts defer to the health care provider's professionaljudgment, as long as it is reasonable in light of then-current medical knowledge?"4. What is the proper standard of judicial reviewunder title III of the ADA of a private health care provider's judgment that the performance of certain inva-sive procedures in his office would pose a direct threatto the health or safety of others?"5. Did petitioner, Randon Bragdon, D. M. D., raise agenuine issue of fact for trial as to whether he was war-ranted in his judgment that the performance of certaininvasive procedures on a patient in his office would haveposed a direct threat to the health or safety of others?"Pet. for Cert. i.Of these, we granted certiorari only on question three. Thequestion is phrased in an awkward way, for it conflates twoseparate inquiries. In asking whether it is appropriate todefer to petitioner's judgment, it assumes that petitioner'sassessment of the objective facts was reasonable. The cen-tral premise of the question and the assumption on which itis based merit separate consideration.Again, we begin with the statute. Notwithstanding theprotection given respondent by the ADA's definition of dis-ability, petitioner could have refused to treat her if her infectious condition "pose[d] a direct threat to the health or safetyof others." 42 U. S. C. $ 12182(b)(3). The ADA defines a direct threat to be "a significant risk to the health or safety ofothers that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies,practices, or procedures or by the provision of auxiliary aids524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN649Cite as: 524 U. S. 624 (1998)Opinion of the Courtor services." Ibid. Parallel provisions appear in the em-ployment provisions of Title I. $$ 12111(3), 12113(b).The ADA's direct threat provision stems from the recogni-tion inSchool Bd. of Nassau Cty. v. Arline, 480 U. S. 273,287 (1987), of the importance of prohibiting discriminationagainst individuals with disabilities while protecting othersfrom significant health and safety risks, resulting, for instance, from a contagious disease. In Arline, the Court rec-onciled these objectives by construing the Rehabilitation Actnot to require the hiring of a person who posed "a significantrisk of communicating an infectious disease to others."Id.,at 287, n. 16. Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act andthe Fair Housing Act to incorporate the language. See 29U. S. C. $ 706(8)(D) (excluding individuals who "would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals"); 42 U. S. C. $ 3604(f )(9) (same). It later relied on thesame language in enacting the ADA. See 28 CFR pt. 36,App. B, p. 626 (1997) (ADA's direct threat provision codifiesArline). Because few, if any, activities in life are risk free,Arline and the ADA do not ask whether a risk exists, butwhether it is significant. Arline, supra, at 287, and n. 16; 42U. S. C. $ 12182(b)(3).The existence, or nonexistence, of a significant risk mustbe determined from the standpoint of the person who refusesthe treatment or accommodation, and the risk assessmentmust be based on medical or other objective evidence. Arline, supra, at 288; 28 CFR $ 36.208(c) (1997); id., pt. 36, App.B, p. 626. As a health care professional, petitioner had theduty to assess the risk of infection based on the objective,scientific information available to him and others in his profession. His belief that a significant risk existed, even ifmaintained in good faith, would not relieve him from liability.To use the words of the question presented, petitioner receives no special deference simply because he is a health careprofessional. It is true that Arline reserved "the questionwhether courts should also defer to the reasonable medical524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN650 BRAGDON v. ABBOTTOpinion of the Courtjudgments of private physicians on which an employer hasrelied." 480 U. S., at 288, n. 18. At most, this statementreserved the possibility that employers could consult withindividual physicians as objective third-party experts. Itdid not suggest that an individual physician's state of mindcould excuse discrimination without regard to the objectivereasonableness of his actions.Our conclusion that courts should assess the objective rea-sonableness of the views of health care professionals withoutdeferring to their individual judgments does not answer theimplicit assumption in the question presented, whether petitioner's actions were reasonable in light of the available medical evidence. In assessing the reasonableness of petitioner's actions, the views of public health authorities, such asthe U. S. Public Health Service, CDC, and the National Institutes of Health, are of special weight and authority. Arline,supra, at 288; 28 CFR pt. 36, App. B, p. 626 (1997). Theviews of these organizations are not conclusive, however. Ahealth care professional who disagrees with the prevailingmedical consensus may refute it by citing a credible scientificbasis for deviating from the accepted norm. See W. Keeton,D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton onLaw of Torts $ 32, p. 187 (5th ed. 1984).We have reviewed so much of the record as necessary toillustrate the application of the rule to the facts of this case.For the most part, the Court of Appeals followed the properstandard in evaluating petitioner's position and conducted athorough review of the evidence. Its rejection of the District Court's reliance on the Marianos affidavits was a correctapplication of the principle that petitioner's actions must beevaluated in light of the available, objective evidence. Therecord did not show that CDC had published the conclusionset out in the affidavits at the time petitioner refused to treatrespondent. 107 F. 3d, at 946, n. 7.A further illustration of a correct application of the objective standard is the Court of Appeals' refusal to give weight524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN651Cite as: 524 U. S. 624 (1998)Opinion of the Courtto petitioner's offer to treat respondent in a hospital. Id.,at 943, n. 4. Petitioner testified that he believed hospitalshad safety measures, such as air filtration, ultraviolet lights,and respirators, which would reduce the risk of HIV transmission. App. 151. Petitioner made no showing, however,that any area hospital had these safeguards or even that hehad hospital privileges. Id., at 31. His expert also admitted the lack of any scientific basis for the conclusion thatthese measures would lower the risk of transmission. Id.,at 209. Petitioner failed to present any objective, medicalevidence showing that treating respondent in a hospitalwould be safer or more efficient in preventing HIV transmission than treatment in a well-equipped dental office.We are concerned, however, that the Court of Appealsmight have placed mistaken reliance upon two other sources.In ruling no triable issue of fact existed on this point, theCourt of Appeals relied on the 1993 CDC Dentistry Guidelines and the 1991 American Dental Association Policy onHIV. 107 F. 3d, at 945-946. This evidence is not definitive.As noted earlier, the CDC Guidelines recommended certainuniversal precautions which, in CDC's view, "should reducethe risk of disease transmission in the dental environment."U. S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Public HealthService, CDC, Recommended Infection-Control Practicesfor Dentistry, 41 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Rep.No. RR-8, p. 1 (May 28, 1993). The Court of Appeals determined that, "[w]hile the guidelines do not state explicitlythat no further risk-reduction measures are desirable or thatroutine dental care for HIV-positive individuals is safe, thosetwo conclusions seem to be implicit in the guidelines' detaileddelineation of procedures for office treatment of HIV-positivepatients." 107 F. 3d, at 946. In our view, the Guidelines donot necessarily contain implicit assumptions conclusive of thepoint to be decided. The Guidelines set out CDC's recommendation that the universal precautions are the best way524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN652 BRAGDON v. ABBOTTOpinion of the Courtto combat the risk of HIV transmission. They do not assessthe level of risk.Nor can we be certain, on this record, whether the 1991American Dental Association Policy on HIV carries theweight the Court of Appeals attributed to it. The Policydoes provide some evidence of the medical community'sobjective assessment of the risks posed by treating peopleinfected with HIV in dental offices. It indicates:"Current scientific and epidemiologic evidence indicatesthat there is little risk of transmission of infectiousdiseases through dental treatment if recommended infection control procedures are routinely followed. Pa-tients with HIV infection may be safely treated in private dental offices when appropriate infection controlprocedures are employed. Such infection control procedures provide protection both for patients and dentalpersonnel." App. 225.We note, however, that the Association is a professional or-ganization, which, although a respected source of informationon the dental profession, is not a public health authority. Itis not clear the extent to which the Policy was based on theAssociation's assessment of dentists' ethical and professionalduties in addition to its scientific assessment of the risk towhich the ADA refers. Efforts to clarify dentists' ethicalobligations and to encourage dentists to treat patients withHIV infection with compassion may be commendable, butthe question under the statute is one of statistical likelihood,not professional responsibility. Without more informationon the manner in which the American Dental Associationformulated this Policy, we are unable to determine the Policy's value in evaluating whether petitioner's assessment ofthe risks was reasonable as a matter of law.The court considered materials submitted by both partieson the cross-motions for summary judgment. The petitioner was required to establish that there existed a genuine524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN653Cite as: 524 U. S. 624 (1998)Opinion of the Courtissue of material fact. Evidence which was merely colorableor not significantly probative would not have been sufficient.Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U. S. 242, 249-250(1986).We acknowledge the presence of other evidence in the record before the Court of Appeals which, subject to furtherarguments and examination, might support affirmance of thetrial court's ruling. For instance, the record contains sub-stantial testimony from numerous health experts indicatingthat it is safe to treat patients infected with HIV in dentaloffices. App. 66-68, 88-90, 264-266, 268. We are unable todetermine the import of this evidence, however. The recorddoes not disclose whether the expert testimony submitted byrespondent turned on evidence available in September 1994.See id., at 69-70 (expert testimony relied in part on materials published after September 1994).There are reasons to doubt whether petitioner advancedevidence sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact on thesignificance of the risk. Petitioner relied on two principalpoints: First, he asserted that the use of high-speed drillsand surface cooling with water created a risk of airborneHIV transmission. The study on which petitioner reliedwas inconclusive, however, determining only that "[f]urtherwork is required to determine whether such a risk exists."Johnson & Robinson, Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1(HIV-1) in the Vapors of Surgical Power Instruments, 33 J.of Medical Virology 47 (1991). Petitioner's expert witnessconceded, moreover, that no evidence suggested the spraycould transmit HIV. His opinion on airborne risk was basedon the absence of contrary evidence, not on positive data.App. 166. Scientific evidence and expert testimony musthave a traceable, analytical basis in objective fact before itmay be considered on summary judgment. See GeneralElectric Co. v. Joiner, 522 U. S. 136, 144-145, 146 (1997).Second, petitioner argues that, as of September 1994, CDChad identified seven dental workers with possible occupa524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN654 BRAGDON v. ABBOTTOpinion of the Courttional transmission of HIV. See U. S. Dept. of Health andHuman Services, Public Health Service, CDC, HIV/AIDSSurveillance Report, vol. 6, no. 1, p. 15, tbl. 11 (Mid-year ed.June 1994). These dental workers were exposed to HIV inthe course of their employment, but CDC could not determine whether HIV infection had resulted from this expo-sure.Id., at 15, n. 3. It is now known that CDC could notascertain how the seven dental workers contracted the dis-ease because they did not present themselves for HIV testing at an appropriate time after this occupational exposure.Gooch et al., Percutaneous Exposures to HIV-Infected BloodAmong Dental Workers Enrolled in the CDC NeedlestickStudy, 126 J. American Dental Assn. 1237, 1239 (1995). It isnot clear on this record, however, whether this informationwas available to petitioner in September 1994. If not, theseven cases might have provided some, albeit not necessarilysufficient, support for petitioner's position. Standing alone,we doubt it would meet the objective, scientific basis forfinding a significant risk to the petitioner.Our evaluation of the evidence is constrained by the factthat on these and other points we have not had briefs andarguments directed to the entire record. In accepting thecase for review, we declined to grant certiorari on questionfive, which asked whether petitioner raised a genuine issueof fact for trial. Pet. for Cert. i. As a result, the briefs andarguments presented to us did not concentrate on the question of sufficiency in light all of the submissions in the summary judgment proceeding. "When attention has been focused on other issues, or when the court from which a casecomes has expressed no views on a controlling question, itmay be appropriate to remand the case rather than deal withthe merits of that question in this Court." Dandridge v.Williams, 397 U. S. 471, 476, n. 6 (1970). This considerationcarries particular force where, as here, full briefing directedat the issue would help place a complex factual record inproper perspective. Resolution of the issue will be of im524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN655Cite as: 524 U. S. 624 (1998)Stevens, J., concurringportance to health care workers not just for the result butalso for the precision and comprehensiveness of the reasonsgiven for the decision.We conclude the proper course is to give the Court of Appeals the opportunity to determine whether our analysis ofsome of the studies cited by the parties would change itsconclusion that petitioner presented neither objective evi-dence nor a triable issue of fact on the question of risk. Inremanding the case, we do not foreclose the possibility thatthe Court of Appeals may reach the same conclusion it didearlier. A remand will permit a full exploration of the issuethrough the adversary process.The determination of the Court of Appeals that respond-ent's HIV infection was a disability under the ADA is affirmed. The judgment is vacated, and the case is remandedfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
