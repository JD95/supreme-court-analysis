Section 1 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act) ex-cludes from the Act's coverage "contracts of employment ofseamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workersengaged in foreign or interstate commerce." 9 U. S. C. $ 1.All but one of the Courts of Appeals which have addressedthe issue interpret this provision as exempting contracts ofemployment of transportation workers, but not other em-ployment contracts, from the FAA's coverage. A differentinterpretation has been adopted by the Court of Appealsfor the Ninth Circuit, which construes the exemption so thatall contracts of employment are beyond the FAA's reach,whether or not the worker is engaged in transportation.It applied that rule to the instant case. We now decide thatthe better interpretation is to construe the statute, as mostof the Courts of Appeals have done, to confine the exemptionto transportation workers.IIn October 1995, respondent Saint Clair Adams applied fora job at petitioner Circuit City Stores, Inc., a national retailer of consumer electronics.

Circuit City filed suit in the United StatesDistrict Court for the Northern District of California, seek-ing to enjoin the state-court action and to compel arbitrationof respondent's claims pursuant to the FAA, 9 U.

Respondent, the court concluded, was obligated by the arbitra-tion agreement to submit his claims against the employer tobinding arbitration. An appeal followed.While respondent's appeal was pending in the Court ofAppeals for the Ninth Circuit, the court ruled on the keyissue in an unrelated case. The court held the FAA doesnot apply to contracts of employment. See Craft v. Campbell Soup Co., 177 F. 3d 1083 (1999). In the instant case,following the rule announced in Craft, the Court of Appealsheld the arbitration agreement between Adams and CircuitCity was contained in a "contract of employment," and sowas not subject to the FAA. 194 F. 3d 1070 (1999).

As the Court has ex-plained, the FAA was a response to hostility of Americancourts to the enforcement of arbitration agreements, a judi-cial disposition inherited from then-longstanding Englishpractice. See, e. g., Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson,513 U. S. 265, 270-271 (1995);Gilmer v. Interstate/JohnsonLane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 24 (1991). To give effect to thispurpose, the FAA compels judicial enforcement of a widerange of written arbitration agreements. The FAA's cover-age provision, $ 2, provides that"[a] written provision in any maritime transaction or acontract evidencing a transaction involving commerce tosettle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising outof such contract or transaction, or the refusal to performthe whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract, transaction, or refusal, shallbe valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such532US1 Unit: $U35 [09-05-02 19:16:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN112 CIRCUIT CITY STORES, INC. v. ADAMSOpinion of the Courtgrounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocationof any contract." 9 U. S. C. $ 2.We had occasion in Allied-Bruce, supra, at 273-277, toconsider the significance of Congress' use of the words "involving commerce" in $ 2. The analysis began with a reaf-firmation of earlier decisions concluding that the FAA wasenacted pursuant to Congress' substantive power to regulateinterstate commerce and admiralty, see Prima Paint Corp.v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U. S. 395, 405 (1967), andthat the Act was applicable in state courts and pre-emptiveof state laws hostile to arbitration, see Southland Corp. v.Keating, 465 U. S. 1 (1984). Relying upon these backgroundprinciples and upon the evident reach of the words "involving commerce," the Court interpreted $ 2 as implementingCongress' intent "to exercise [its] commerce power to thefull." Allied-Bruce, supra, at 277.The instant case, of course, involves not the basic coverageauthorization under $ 2 of the Act, but the exemption fromcoverage under $ 1. The exemption clause provides the Actshall not apply "to contracts of employment of seamen,railroad employees, or any other class of workers engagedin foreign or interstate commerce." 9 U. S. C. $ 1. MostCourts of Appeals conclude the exclusion provision is limitedto transportation workers, defined, for instance, as thoseworkers " `actually engaged in the movement of goods in interstate commerce.' " Cole, supra, at 1471. As we statedat the outset, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuittakes a different view and interprets the $ 1 exception toexclude all contracts of employment from the reach of theFAA. This comprehensive exemption had been advocatedbyamici curiae in Gilmer, where we addressed the ques-tion whether a registered securities representative's employment discrimination claim under the Age Discriminationin Employment Act of 1967, 81 Stat. 602, as amended, 29U. S. C. $ 621 et seq., could be submitted to arbitration pursu-ant to an agreement in his securities registration application.532US1 Unit: $U35 [09-05-02 19:16:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN113Cite as: 532 U. S. 105 (2001)Opinion of the CourtConcluding that the application was not a "contract of em-ployment" at all, we found it unnecessary to reach the meaning of $ 1. See Gilmer, supra, at 25, n. 2. There is no suchdispute in this case; while Circuit City argued in its petition for certiorari that the employment application signedby Adams was not a "contract of employment," we declinedto grant certiorari on this point. So the issue reserved inGilmer is presented here. BRespondent, at the outset, contends that we need not ad-dress the meaning of the $ 1 exclusion provision to decide thecase in his favor. In his view, an employment contract isnot a "contract evidencing a transaction involving interstatecommerce" at all, since the word "transaction" in $ 2 extendsonly to commercial contracts. See Craft, 177 F. 3d, at 1085(concluding that $ 2 covers only "commercial deal[s] or mer-chant's sale[s]"). This line of reasoning proves too much, forit would make the $ 1 exclusion provision superfluous. If allcontracts of employment are beyond the scope of the Actunder the $ 2 coverage provision, the separate exemption for"contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, orany other class of workers engaged in . . . interstate com-merce" would be pointless. See, e. g., Pennsylvania Dept.of Public Welfare v. Davenport, 495 U. S. 552, 562 (1990)("Our cases express a deep reluctance to interpret a statutory provision so as to render superfluous other provisionsin the same enactment"). The proffered interpretation of"evidencing a transaction involving commerce," furthermore,would be inconsistent withGilmer v. Interstate/JohnsonLane Corp., 500 U. S. 20 (1991), where we held that $ 2 required the arbitration of an age discrimination claim basedon an agreement in a securities registration application, adispute that did not arise from a "commercial deal or mer-chant's sale." Nor could respondent's construction of $ 2be reconciled with the expansive reading of those wordsadopted inAllied-Bruce, 513 U. S., at 277, 279-280. If, then,532US1 Unit: $U35 [09-05-02 19:16:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN114 CIRCUIT CITY STORES, INC. v. ADAMSOpinion of the Courtthere is an argument to be made that arbitration agreementsin employment contracts are not covered by the Act, it mustbe premised on the language of the $ 1 exclusion provisionitself.Respondent, endorsing the reasoning of the Court of Ap-peals for the Ninth Circuit that the provision excludes allemployment contracts, relies on the asserted breadth of thewords "contracts of employment of . . . any other class ofworkers engaged in . . . commerce." Referring to our construction of $ 2's coverage provision in Allied-Bruce--con-cluding that the words "involving commerce" evidence thecongressional intent to regulate to the full extent of itscommerce power--respondent contends $ 1's interpretationshould have a like reach, thus exempting all employment contracts. The two provisions, it is argued, are coterminous;under this view the "involving commerce" provision bringswithin the FAA's scope all contracts within the Congress'commerce power, and the "engaged in . . . commerce" language in $ 1 in turn exempts from the FAA all employmentcontracts falling within that authority.This reading of $ 1, however, runs into an immediate and,in our view, insurmountable textual obstacle. Unlike the"involving commerce" language in $ 2, the words "any otherclass of workers engaged in . . . commerce" constitute a residual phrase, following, in the same sentence, explicit referenceto "seamen" and "railroad employees." Construing the residual phrase to exclude all employment contracts fails togive independent effect to the statute's enumeration of thespecific categories of workers which precedes it; there wouldbe no need for Congress to use the phrases "seamen" and"railroad employees" if those same classes of workers weresubsumed within the meaning of the "engaged in . . . commerce" residual clause. The wording of $ 1 calls for theapplication of the maxim ejusdem generis, the statutorycanon that "[w]here general words follow specific words in astatutory enumeration, the general words are construed to532US1 Unit: $U35 [09-05-02 19:16:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN115Cite as: 532 U. S. 105 (2001)Opinion of the Courtembrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enu-merated by the preceding specific words." 2A N. Singer,Sutherland on Statutes and Statutory Construction $ 47.17(1991); see alsoNorfolk & Western R. Co. v. Train Dispatchers, 499 U. S. 117, 129 (1991). Under this rule of construc-tion the residual clause should be read to give effect to theterms "seamen" and "railroad employees," and should itselfbe controlled and defined by reference to the enumeratedcategories of workers which are recited just before it; theinterpretation of the clause pressed by respondent fails toproduce these results.Canons of construction need not be conclusive and areoften countered, of course, by some maxim pointing in a different direction. The application of the rule ejusdem generis in this case, however, is in full accord with other soundconsiderations bearing upon the proper interpretation of theclause. For even if the term "engaged in commerce" stoodalone in $ 1, we would not construe the provision to excludeall contracts of employment from the FAA. Congress usesdifferent modifiers to the word "commerce" in the design andenactment of its statutes. The phrase "affecting commerce"indicates Congress' intent to regulate to the outer limitsof its authority under the Commerce Clause. See, e. g.,Allied-Bruce, 513 U. S., at 277. The "involving commerce"phrase, the operative words for the reach of the basic coverage provision in $ 2, was at issue in Allied-Bruce. That particular phrase had not been interpreted before by this Court.Considering the usual meaning of the word "involving," andthe pro-arbitration purposes of the FAA, Allied-Bruce heldthe "word `involving,' like `affecting,' signals an intent toexercise Congress' commerce power to the full." Ibid. Unlike those phrases, however, the general words "in commerce" and the specific phrase "engaged in commerce" areunderstood to have a more limited reach. In Allied-Bruceitself the Court said the words "in commerce" are "oftenfound words of art" that we have not read as expressing532US1 Unit: $U35 [09-05-02 19:16:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN116 CIRCUIT CITY STORES, INC. v. ADAMSOpinion of the Courtcongressional intent to regulate to the outer limits of author-ity under the Commerce Clause.Id., at 273; see also UnitedStates v. American Building Maintenance Industries, 422U. S. 271, 279-280 (1975) (phrase "engaged in commerce" is"a term of art, indicating a limited assertion of federal juris-diction");Jones v. United States, 529 U. S. 848, 855 (2000)(phrase "used in commerce" "is most sensibly read to meanactive employment for commercial purposes, and not merelya passive, passing, or past connection to commerce").It is argued that we should assess the meaning of thephrase "engaged in commerce" in a different manner here,because the FAA was enacted when congressional authorityto regulate under the commerce power was to a large extentconfined by our decisions. See United States v. Lopez, 514U. S. 549, 556 (1995) (noting that Supreme Court decisionsbeginning in 1937 "ushered in an era of Commerce Clausejurisprudence that greatly expanded the previously definedauthority of Congress under that Clause"). When the FAAwas enacted in 1925, respondent reasons, the phrase "engaged in commerce" was not a term of art indicating a limited assertion of congressional jurisdiction; to the contrary,it is said, the formulation came close to expressing the outerlimits of Congress' power as then understood. See, e. g., TheEmployers' Liability Cases, 207 U. S. 463, 498 (1908) (holding unconstitutional jurisdictional provision in Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA) covering the employees of"every common carrier engaged in trade or commerce"); Second Employers' Liability Cases, 223 U. S. 1, 48-49 (1912);but cf. Illinois Central R. Co. v. Behrens, 233 U. S. 473 (1914)(noting in dicta that the amended FELA's application to common carriers "while engaging in commerce" did not reachall employment relationships within Congress' commercepower). Were this mode of interpretation to prevail, wewould take into account the scope of the Commerce Clause,as then elaborated by the Court, at the date of the FAA'senactment in order to interpret what the statute means now.532US1 Unit: $U35 [09-05-02 19:16:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN117Cite as: 532 U. S. 105 (2001)Opinion of the CourtA variable standard for interpreting common, jurisdic-tional phrases would contradict our earlier cases and bringinstability to statutory interpretation. The Court has de-clined in past cases to afford significance, in construing themeaning of the statutory jurisdictional provisions "in com-merce" and "engaged in commerce," to the circumstance thatthe statute predated shifts in the Court's Commerce Clausecases. In FTC v. Bunte Brothers, Inc., 312 U. S. 349 (1941),the Court rejected the contention that the phrase "in commerce" in $ 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 38 Stat.719, 15 U. S. C. $ 45, a provision enacted by Congress in 1914,should be read in as expansive a manner as "affecting commerce." See Bunte Bros., supra, at 350-351. We entertained a similar argument in a pair of cases decided in the1974 Term concerning the meaning of the phrase "engagedin commerce" in $ 7 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, 15U. S. C. $ 18, another 1914 congressional enactment. SeeAmerican Building Maintenance, supra, at 277-283; GulfOil Corp. v. Copp Paving Co., 419 U. S. 186, 199-202 (1974).We held that the phrase "engaged in commerce" in $ 7"means engaged in the flow of interstate commerce, and wasnot intended to reach all corporations engaged in activitiessubject to the federal commerce power." American Building Maintenance, supra, at 283; cf. Gulf Oil, supra, at 202(expressing doubt as to whether an "argument from the history and practical purposes of the Clayton Act" could justify"radical expansion of the Clayton Act's scope beyond thatwhich the statutory language defines").The Court's reluctance to accept contentions that Congressused the words "in commerce" or "engaged in commerce" toregulate to the full extent of its commerce power rests onsound foundation, as it affords objective and consistent significance to the meaning of the words Congress uses when itdefines the reach of a statute. To say that the statutorywords "engaged in commerce" are subject to variable interpretations depending upon the date of adoption, even a date532US1 Unit: $U35 [09-05-02 19:16:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN118 CIRCUIT CITY STORES, INC. v. ADAMSOpinion of the Courtbefore the phrase became a term of art, ignores the reasonwhy the formulation became a term of art in the first place:The plain meaning of the words "engaged in commerce" isnarrower than the more open-ended formulations "affectingcommerce" and "involving commerce." See, e. g., Gulf Oil,supra, at 195 (phrase "engaged in commerce" "appears todenote only persons or activities within the flow of interstatecommerce"). It would be unwieldy for Congress, for theCourt, and for litigants to be required to deconstruct statutory Commerce Clause phrases depending upon the year ofa particular statutory enactment.In rejecting the contention that the meaning of the phrase"engaged in commerce" in $ 1 of the FAA should be given abroader construction than justified by its evident languagesimply because it was enacted in 1925 rather than 1938, wedo not mean to suggest that statutory jurisdictional formulations "necessarily have a uniform meaning whenever usedby Congress." American Building Maintenance Industries, supra, at 277. As the Court has noted: "The judicialtask in marking out the extent to which Congress has exercised its constitutional power over commerce is not that ofdevising an abstract formula." A. B. Kirschbaum Co. v.Walling, 316 U. S. 517, 520 (1942). We must, of course, construe the "engaged in commerce" language in the FAA withreference to the statutory context in which it is found andin a manner consistent with the FAA's purpose. These considerations, however, further compel that the $ 1 exclusionprovision be afforded a narrow construction. As discussedabove, the location of the phrase "any other class of workersengaged in . . . commerce" in a residual provision, afterspecific categories of workers have been enumerated, undermines any attempt to give the provision a sweeping, openended construction. And the fact that the provision is contained in a statute that "seeks broadly to overcome judicialhostility to arbitration agreements," Allied-Bruce, 513 U. S.,at 272-273, which the Court concluded in Allied-Bruce coun532US1 Unit: $U35 [09-05-02 19:16:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN119Cite as: 532 U. S. 105 (2001)Opinion of the Courtseled in favor of an expansive reading of $ 2, gives no reasonto abandon the precise reading of a provision that exemptscontracts from the FAA's coverage.In sum, the text of the FAA forecloses the construction of$ 1 followed by the Court of Appeals in the case under re-view, a construction which would exclude all employmentcontracts from the FAA. While the historical argumentsrespecting Congress' understanding of its power in 1925 arenot insubstantial, this fact alone does not give us basis toadopt, "by judicial decision rather than amendatory legislation," Gulf Oil, supra, at 202, an expansive construction ofthe FAA's exclusion provision that goes beyond the meaningof the words Congress used. While it is of course possibleto speculate that Congress might have chosen a different jurisdictional formulation had it known that the Court wouldsoon embrace a less restrictive reading of the CommerceClause, the text of $ 1 precludes interpreting the exclusionprovision to defeat the language of $ 2 as to all employmentcontracts. Section 1 exempts from the FAA only contractsof employment of transportation workers.CAs the conclusion we reach today is directed by the text of$ 1, we need not assess the legislative history of the exclusionprovision. See Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U. S. 135, 147-148 (1994) ("[W]e do not resort to legislative history to clouda statutory text that is clear"). We do note, however, thatthe legislative record on the $ 1 exemption is quite sparse.Respondent points to no language in either Committee Re-port addressing the meaning of the provision, nor to anymention of the $ 1 exclusion during debate on the FAA onthe floor of the House or Senate. Instead, respondent placesgreatest reliance upon testimony before a Senate subcommit-tee hearing suggesting that the exception may have beenadded in response to the objections of the president of theInternational Seamen's Union of America. See Hearing on532US1 Unit: $U35 [09-05-02 19:16:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN120 CIRCUIT CITY STORES, INC. v. ADAMSOpinion of the CourtS. 4213 and S. 4214 before a Subcommittee of the SenateCommittee on the Judiciary, 67th Cong., 4th Sess., 9 (1923).Legislative history is problematic even when the attempt isto draw inferences from the intent of duly appointed committees of the Congress. It becomes far more so when we con-sult sources still more steps removed from the full Congressand speculate upon the significance of the fact that a certaininterest group sponsored or opposed particular legislation.Cf.Kelly v. Robinson, 479 U. S. 36, 51, n. 13 (1986) ("[N]oneof those statements was made by a Member of Congress, norwere they included in the official Senate and House Reports.We decline to accord any significance to these statements").We ought not attribute to Congress an official purpose basedon the motives of a particular group that lobbied for oragainst a certain proposal--even assuming the precise intentof the group can be determined, a point doubtful both as ageneral rule and in the instant case. It is for the Congress,not the courts, to consult political forces and then decide howbest to resolve conflicts in the course of writing the objectiveembodiments of law we know as statutes.Nor can we accept respondent's argument that our holdingattributes an irrational intent to Congress. "Under petitioner's reading of $ 1," he contends, "those employment contracts most involving interstate commerce, and thus mostassuredly within the Commerce Clause power in 1925 . . . areexcluded from [the] Act's coverage; while those employmentcontracts having a less direct and less certain connection tointerstate commerce . . . would come within the Act's affirmative coverage and would not be excluded." Brief forRespondent 38 (emphases in original).We see no paradox in the congressional decision to exemptthe workers over whom the commerce power was most apparent. To the contrary, it is a permissible inference thatthe employment contracts of the classes of workers in $ 1were excluded from the FAA precisely because of Congress'undoubted authority to govern the employment relationships532US1 Unit: $U35 [09-05-02 19:16:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN121Cite as: 532 U. S. 105 (2001)Opinion of the Courtat issue by the enactment of statutes specific to them. Bythe time the FAA was passed, Congress had already enactedfederal legislation providing for the arbitration of disputesbetween seamen and their employers, see Shipping Commissioners Act of 1872, 17 Stat. 262. When the FAA wasadopted, moreover, grievance procedures existed for railroademployees under federal law, see Transportation Act of 1920,$$ 300-316, 41 Stat. 456, and the passage of a more comprehensive statute providing for the mediation and arbitrationof railroad labor disputes was imminent, see Railway LaborAct of 1926, 44 Stat. 577, 46 U. S. C. $ 651 (repealed). Itis reasonable to assume that Congress excluded "seamen"and "railroad employees" from the FAA for the simple rea-son that it did not wish to unsettle established or developing statutory dispute resolution schemes covering specificworkers.As for the residual exclusion of "any other class of workersengaged in foreign or interstate commerce," Congress' demonstrated concern with transportation workers and theirnecessary role in the free flow of goods explains the linkageto the two specific, enumerated types of workers identifiedin the preceding portion of the sentence. It would be rational for Congress to ensure that workers in general wouldbe covered by the provisions of the FAA, while reserving foritself more specific legislation for those engaged in transpor-tation. See Pryner v. Tractor Supply Co., 109 F. 3d, at 358(Posner, C. J.). Indeed, such legislation was soon to follow,with the amendment of the Railway Labor Act in 1936 toinclude air carriers and their employees, see 49 Stat. 1189,45 U. S. C. $$ 181-188.IIIVarious amici, including the attorneys general of 21States, object that the reading of the $ 1 exclusion provisionadopted today intrudes upon the policies of the separateStates. They point out that, by requiring arbitration agreements in most employment contracts to be covered by the532US1 Unit: $U35 [09-05-02 19:16:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN122 CIRCUIT CITY STORES, INC. v. ADAMSOpinion of the CourtFAA, the statute in effect pre-empts those state employmentlaws which restrict or limit the ability of employees and employers to enter into arbitration agreements. It is arguedthat States should be permitted, pursuant to their traditionalrole in regulating employment relationships, to prohibit em-ployees like respondent from contracting away their right topursue state-law discrimination claims in court.It is not our holding today which is the proper target ofthis criticism. The line of argument is relevant instead tothe Court's decision in Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S.1 (1984), holding that Congress intended the FAA to applyin state courts, and to pre-empt state antiarbitration laws tothe contrary. See id., at 16.The question of Southland's continuing vitality was givenexplicit consideration in Allied-Bruce, and the Court declined to overrule it. 513 U. S., at 272; see also id., at 282(O'Connor, J., concurring). The decision, furthermore, isnot directly implicated in this case, which concerns the application of the FAA in a federal, rather than in a state, court.The Court should not chip away at Southland by indirection,especially by the adoption of the variable statutory interpretation theory advanced by the respondent in the instant case.Not all of the Justices who join today's holding agreed withAllied-Bruce, see 513 U. S., at 284 (Scalia, J., dissenting);id., at 285 (Thomas, J., dissenting), but it would be incongruous to adopt, as we did in Allied-Bruce, a conventional reading of the FAA's coverage in $ 2 in order to implement proarbitration policies and an unconventional reading of thereach of $ 1 in order to undo the same coverage. In AlliedBruce the Court noted that Congress had not moved to overturn Southland, see 513 U. S., at 272; and we now note thatit has not done so in response to Allied-Bruce itself.Furthermore, for parties to employment contracts notinvolving the specific exempted categories set forth in $ 1, itis true here, just as it was for the parties to the contractat issue in Allied-Bruce, that there are real benefits to the532US1 Unit: $U35 [09-05-02 19:16:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN123Cite as: 532 U. S. 105 (2001)Opinion of the Courtenforcement of arbitration provisions. We have been clearin rejecting the supposition that the advantages of the arbitration process somehow disappear when transferred tothe employment context. SeeGilmer, 500 U. S., at 30-32.Arbitration agreements allow parties to avoid the costs oflitigation, a benefit that may be of particular importancein employment litigation, which often involves smaller sumsof money than disputes concerning commercial contracts.These litigation costs to parties (and the accompanying burden to the courts) would be compounded by the difficultchoice-of-law questions that are often presented in disputesarising from the employment relationship, cf. Egelhoff v.Egelhoff, post, at 149 (noting possible "choice-of-law problems" presented by state laws affecting administration ofEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 plans),and the necessity of bifurcation of proceedings in those caseswhere state law precludes arbitration of certain types ofemployment claims but not others. The considerable complexity and uncertainty that the construction of $ 1 urgedby respondent would introduce into the enforceability ofarbitration agreements in employment contracts would callinto doubt the efficacy of alternative dispute resolution procedures adopted by many of the Nation's employers, in theprocess undermining the FAA's proarbitration purposes and"breeding litigation from a statute that seeks to avoid it."Allied-Bruce, supra, at 275. The Court has been quite specific in holding that arbitration agreements can be enforcedunder the FAA without contravening the policies of congressional enactments giving employees specific protectionagainst discrimination prohibited by federal law; as we notedin Gilmer, " `[b]y agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim, aparty does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by thestatute; it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral,rather than a judicial, forum.'

That matter, though, was addressedin Southland and Allied-Bruce, and we do not revisit thequestion here. * * *For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Courtof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the caseis remanded for further proceedings consistent with thisopinion.
