Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356 (1988), or Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738 (1990). The petitioner argues that the State of Mississippi committed the same errorin his case as it did in Clemons, and that under both Maynard and Clemons his sentence is unconstitutional. Thequestion presented is whether in a federal habeas corpusproceeding a petitioner is foreclosed from relying on Maynard and Clemons because either or both announced a newrule as defined in Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989).IIn June 1982, Ray McWilliams and his wife, Nell, wereshot to death in their Jackson, Mississippi, home as part ofan armed robbery. The petitioner James R. Stringer did notfire the fatal shots, but he did plan the robbery and take partin it. The killing was part of his plan from the outset. Thecrimes, and their gruesome aspects, are described in theopinion of the Mississippi Supreme Court on direct review ofthe conviction and sentence. Stringer v. State, 454 So. 2d468, 471-473 (1984).Under Mississippi law the death sentence may be imposedfor murders designated by statute as "capital murder."Miss. Code Ann. $ 97-3-19(2) (Supp. 1991). A killing in thecourse of a burglary or robbery is included within that category. Following a capital murder conviction, the jury in theMississippi system proceeds to the sentencing phase of thecase. For a defendant who has been convicted of capitalmurder to receive the death sentence, the jury must find atleast one of eight statutory aggravating factors, and then itmust determine that the aggravating factor or factors arenot outweighed by the mitigating circumstances, if any.$ 99-19-101.The jury found petitioner guilty of capital murder in thecourse of a robbery. In the sentencing phase the jury foundthat there were three statutory aggravating factors. The503us1$44L 11-13-95 23:06:07 PAGES OPINPGT226 STRINGER v. BLACKOpinion of the Courtaggravating factors as defined in the jury instructions, andfor the most part following the statutory wording, were:"1. The Defendant contemplated that life would betaken and/or the capital murder was intentionally committed and that the Defendant was engaged in an at-tempt to commit a robbery; and was committed for pecuniary gain."2. The capital murder was committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing the detection and lawfularrest of James R. Stringer, the Defendant."3. The capital murder was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel." Brief for Respondents 4.The trial court in its instructions did not further define themeaning of the third factor.On direct review the Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed.Stringer v. State, supra. With respect to the sentence, thecourt found it was not "imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor," id., at 478; "theevidence fully support[ed] the jury's finding of statutorily required aggravating circumstances," id., at 479; and the deathsentence was not disproportionate to sentences imposed inother cases, ibid. Petitioner's conviction became final whenwe denied certiorari on February 19, 1985.Stringer v. Mississippi, 469 U. S. 1230. Postconviction relief was deniedin the state courts. Stringer v. State, 485 So. 2d 274 (1986).This case comes to us from proceedings begun when petitioner filed his first federal habeas petition in the UnitedStates District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. The relevant claim is petitioner's contention that thethird aggravating factor found by the jury and considered inthe sentencing proceeding, the "heinous, atrocious or cruel"aggravating factor, was so vague as to render the sentencearbitrary, in violation of the Eighth Amendment's proscription of cruel and unusual punishment. The District Courtfound the claim subject to a procedural bar and, in the alter503us1$44L 11-13-95 23:06:07 PAGES OPINPGT227Cite as: 503 U. S. 222 (1992)Opinion of the Courtnative, ruled it had no merit. Stringer v. Scroggy, 675F. Supp. 356, 366 (1987).Without consideration of the procedural bar question, theCourt of Appeals affirmed on the merits, finding no constitutional infirmity in the jury's consideration of the third aggra-vating factor because two other aggravating factors were unchallenged. Stringer v. Jackson, 862 F. 2d 1108 (CA5 1988).When the Court of Appeals affirmed, we had not decidedClemons v. Mississippi, and we later vacated its opinion forfurther consideration. 494 U. S. 1074 (1990). On remandthe Court of Appeals held that petitioner was not entitled torely onClemons or the related case of Maynard v. Cartwright in his habeas corpus proceeding because those deci-sions announced a new rule after his sentence was final. 909F. 2d 111 (1990). The court relied upon its earlier analysisin Smith v. Black, 904 F. 2d 950 (1990), cert. pending, No.90-1164, a case that had also presented the question whetherClemons and Maynard announced a new rule. We grantedcertiorari, 500 U. S. 915 (1991), and now reverse.IISubject to two exceptions, a case decided after a petition-er's conviction and sentence became final may not be thepredicate for federal habeas corpus relief unless the decisionwas dictated by precedent existing when the judgment inquestion became final. Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407(1990); Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302 (1989); Teague v.Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989). As we explained in Butler, "[t]he`new rule' principle . . . validates reasonable, good-faith interpretations of existing precedents made by state courts eventhough they are shown to be contrary to later decisions."494 U. S., at 414. Neither one of the exceptions is at issuehere, so our inquiry is confined to the question whetherClemons, Maynard, or both announced a new rule.When a petitioner seeks federal habeas relief based upona principle announced after a final judgment, Teague and our503us1$44L 11-13-95 23:06:07 PAGES OPINPGT228 STRINGER v. BLACKOpinion of the Courtsubsequent decisions interpreting it require a federal courtto answer an initial question, and in some cases a second.First, it must be determined whether the decision reliedupon announced a new rule. If the answer is yes and neither exception applies, the decision is not available to thepetitioner. If, however, the decision did not announce a newrule, it is necessary to inquire whether granting the reliefsought would create a new rule because the prior decision isapplied in a novel setting, thereby extending the precedent.SeeButler v. McKellar, supra, at 414-415. The interests infinality, predictability, and comity underlying our new rulejurisprudence may be undermined to an equal degree by theinvocation of a rule that was not dictated by precedent as bythe application of an old rule in a manner that was not dic-tated by precedent.AA determination whether Maynard and Clemons an-nounced a new rule must begin with Godfrey v. Georgia, 446U. S. 420 (1980). In Godfrey we invalidated a death sen-tence based upon the aggravating circumstance that the killing was "outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible and inhu-man." Id., at 428-429. The formulation was deemed vagueand imprecise, inviting arbitrary and capricious applicationof the death penalty in violation of the Eighth Amendment.We later applied the same analysis and reasoning in Maynard. In Maynard the aggravating circumstance under anOklahoma statute applied to a killing that was "especiallyheinous, atrocious, or cruel." 486 U. S., at 359. We foundthe language gave no more guidance than did the statute inGodfrey, and we invalidated the Oklahoma formulation. 486U. S., at 363-364.In the case now before us Mississippi does not argue thatMaynard itself announced a new rule. To us this appears awise concession. Godfrey and Maynard did indeed involvesomewhat different language. But it would be a mistake toconclude that the vagueness ruling of Godfrey was limited503us1$44L 11-13-95 23:06:07 PAGES OPINPGT229Cite as: 503 U. S. 222 (1992)Opinion of the Courtto the precise language before us in that case. In applyingGodfrey to the language before us in Maynard, we did not"brea[k] new ground." Butler v. McKellar, supra, at 412.Maynard was, therefore, for purposes of Teague, controlledby Godfrey, and it did not announce a new rule.BOf more substance is the State's contention that it was anew rule to apply the Godfrey and Maynard holdings to theMississippi sentencing process. The State argues this musthave been an open question when petitioner's sentence became final, with Clemons yet undecided. We acknowledgethere are differences in the use of aggravating factors underthe Mississippi capital sentencing system and their use inthe Georgia system inGodfrey. In our view, however, thosedifferences could not have been considered a basis for denying relief in light of precedent existing at the time petition-er's sentence became final. Indeed, to the extent that thedifferences are significant, they suggest that application ofthe Godfrey principle to the Mississippi sentencing processfollows, a fortiori, from its application to the Georgia system.1The principal difference between the sentencing schemesin Georgia and Mississippi is that Mississippi is what we havetermed a "weighing" State, while Georgia is not. See Clem-ons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S., at 745; Parker v. Dugger, 498U. S. 308, 318 (1991). Under Mississippi law, after a jury hasfound a defendant guilty of capital murder and found theexistence of at least one statutory aggravating factor, it mustweigh the aggravating factor or factors against the mitigating evidence. By contrast, in Georgia the jury must find theexistence of one aggravating factor before imposing thedeath penalty, but aggravating factors as such have no spe-cific function in the jury's decision whether a defendant whohas been found to be eligible for the death penalty should503us1$44L 11-13-95 23:06:07 PAGES OPINPGT230 STRINGER v. BLACKOpinion of the Courtreceive it under all the circumstances of the case. Instead,under the Georgia scheme, " `[i]n making the decision as tothe penalty, the factfinder takes into consideration all cir-cumstances before it from both the guilt-innocence and thesentence phases of the trial. These circumstances relateboth to the offense and the defendant.' " Zant v. Stephens,462 U. S. 862, 872 (1983) (quoting the response of the GeorgiaSupreme Court to our certified question).That Mississippi is a weighing State only gives emphasisto the requirement that aggravating factors be defined withsome degree of precision. By express language inZant weleft open the possibility that in a weighing State infectionof the process with an invalid aggravating factor might require invalidation of the death sentence. Id., at 890. Although we later held in Clemons v. Mississippi that undersuch circumstances a state appellate court could reweighthe aggravating and mitigating circumstances or undertakeharmless-error analysis, we have not suggested that theEighth Amendment permits the state appellate court in aweighing State to affirm a death sentence without a thorough analysis of the role an invalid aggravating factor playedin the sentencing process.We require close appellate scrutiny of the import and effect of invalid aggravating factors to implement the wellestablished Eighth Amendment requirement of individualized sentencing determinations in death penalty cases. SeeZant, supra, at 879; Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104,110-112 (1982); Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 601-605 (1978)(plurality opinion); Roberts v. Louisiana, 431 U. S. 633, 636-637 (1977); Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 197 (1976) ( jointopinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.); Woodson v.North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, 303-304 (1976) (plurality opinion). In order for a state appellate court to affirm a deathsentence after the sentencer was instructed to consider aninvalid factor, the court must determine what the sentencerwould have done absent the factor. Otherwise, the defend503us1$44L 11-13-95 23:06:07 PAGES OPINPGT231Cite as: 503 U. S. 222 (1992)Opinion of the Courtant is deprived of the precision that individualized consider-ation demands under theGodfrey and Maynard line of cases.These principles of appellate review were illustrated byour decision inBarclay v. Florida, 463 U. S. 939 (1983). Florida, like Mississippi, is a weighing State, Parker v. Dugger,supra, at 318, and the trial judge imposes the sentence basedupon a recommendation from the jury. InBarclay the sentencing judge relied on an aggravating factor that was not alegitimate one under state law. We affirmed the sentence,but only because it was clear that the Florida Supreme Courthad determined that the sentence would have been the samehad the sentencing judge given no weight to the invalid factor. See 463 U. S., at 958 (plurality opinion); id., at 973-974(Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). Therefore, contraryto the dissent's suggestion, post, at 245-247, the fact thatboth principal opinions in Barclay focused on the weight thesentencer gave to an invalid aggravating factor demonstrates that a reviewing court in a weighing State may notmake the automatic assumption that such a factor has notinfected the weighing process. In short, it may not makethe automatic assumption that Stringer claims the Mississippi Supreme Court made in this case.In view of the well-established general requirement of individualized sentencing and the more specific requirementthat a sentence based on an improper factor be reassessedwith care to assure that proper consideration was given,there was no arguable basis to support the view of the Courtof Appeals that at the time petitioner's sentence became finalthe Mississippi Supreme Court was permitted to apply a ruleof automatic affirmance to any death sentence supported bymultiple aggravating factors, when one is invalid.With respect to the function of a state reviewing court indetermining whether the sentence can be upheld despite theuse of an improper aggravating factor, the difference between a weighing State and a nonweighing State is not oneof "semantics," as the Court of Appeals thought, Stringer v.503us1$44L 11-13-95 23:06:07 PAGES OPINPGT232 STRINGER v. BLACKOpinion of the CourtJackson, 862 F. 2d, at 1115, but of critical importance. In anonweighing State, so long as the sentencing body finds atleast one valid aggravating factor, the fact that it also findsan invalid aggravating factor does not infect the formal process of deciding whether death is an appropriate penalty. As-suming a determination by the state appellate court that theinvalid factor would not have made a difference to the jury'sdetermination, there is no constitutional violation resultingfrom the introduction of the invalid factor in an earlier stageof the proceedings. But when the sentencing body is told toweigh an invalid factor in its decision, a reviewing court maynot assume it would have made no difference if the thumbhad been removed from death's side of the scale. When theweighing process itself has been skewed, only constitutionalharmless-error analysis or reweighing at the trial or appel-late level suffices to guarantee that the defendant receivedan individualized sentence. This clear principle emerges notfrom any single case, as the dissent would require, post, at243-247, but from our long line of authority setting forththe dual constitutional criteria of precise and individualizedsentencing. Thus, the principal difference between the sen-tencing systems of Mississippi and Georgia, the different roleplayed by aggravating factors in the two States, underscoresthe applicability ofGodfrey and Maynard to the Mississippisystem.2Although it made no similar argument in Clemons itself,the State contends now that beforeClemons it was reason-able to believe there was no constitutional requirement todefine aggravating factors with precision in the Mississippisystem. It points to the fact that in order for a jury to finda defendant guilty of capital murder it must find that thecrime fits within the narrow and precise statutory definitionof that offense. Any additional consideration of aggravatingfactors during the sentencing phase, under this view, is of noconstitutional significance because the requisite differentia503us1$44L 11-13-95 23:06:07 PAGES OPINPGT233Cite as: 503 U. S. 222 (1992)Opinion of the Courttion among defendants for death penalty purposes has takenplace during the jury's deliberation with respect to guilt.The State cites our decision in Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484U. S. 231 (1988), in support of its analysis. ButLowenfield,arising under Louisiana law, is not applicable here and doesnot indicate that Clemons imposed a new rule.In Louisiana, a person is not eligible for the death penaltyunless found guilty of first-degree homicide, a category morenarrow than the general category of homicide. 484 U. S.,at 241. A defendant is guilty of first-degree homicide ifthe Louisiana jury finds that the killing fits one of five statutory criteria. See id., at 242 (quoting La. Rev. Stat. Ann.$ 14:30A (West 1986)). After determining that a defendantis guilty of first-degree murder, a Louisiana jury next mustdecide whether there is at least one statutory aggravatingcircumstance and, after considering any mitigating circumstances, determine whether the death penalty is appropriate.484 U. S., at 242. Unlike the Mississippi process, in Louisiana the jury is not required to weigh aggravating againstmitigating factors.In Lowenfield, the petitioner argued that his death sentence was invalid because the aggravating factor foundby the jury duplicated the elements it already had found indetermining there was a first-degree homicide. We rejectedthe argument that, as a consequence, the Louisiana sentencing procedures had failed to narrow the class of deatheligible defendants in a predictable manner. We observedthat "[t]he use of `aggravating circumstances' is not an endin itself, but a means of genuinely narrowing the class ofdeath-eligible persons and thereby channeling the jury's discretion. We see no reason why this narrowing function maynot be performed by jury findings at either the sentencingphase of the trial or the guilt phase." Id., at 244-245. Wewent on to compare the Louisiana scheme with the Texasscheme, under which the required narrowing occurs at theguilt phase. Id., at 245 (discussing Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S.503us1$44L 11-13-95 23:06:07 PAGES OPINPGT234 STRINGER v. BLACKOpinion of the Court262 (1976)). We also contrasted the Louisiana scheme withthe Georgia and Florida schemes. 484 U. S., at 245.The State's premise that the Mississippi sentencingscheme is comparable to Louisiana's is in error. The Mississippi Supreme Court itself has stated in no uncertain termsthat, with the exception of one distinction not relevant here,its sentencing system operates in the same manner as theFlorida system; and Florida, of course, is subject to the ruleforbidding automatic affirmance by the state appellate courtif an invalid aggravating factor is relied upon. In consider-ing aGodfrey claim based on the same factor at issue here,the Mississippi Supreme Court considered decisions of theFlorida Supreme Court to be the most appropriate source ofguidance. In Gilliard v. State, 428 So. 2d 576, 586 (1983),the Mississippi Supreme Court compared the claim before itto the claim inDobbert v. State, 375 So. 2d 1069 (Fla. 1979),cert. denied, 447 U. S. 912 (1980). The court stated:"In Dobbert . . . the Florida Supreme Court held thateven though the lower court considered two circum-stances which would not pass constitutional muster anddid not amount to aggravating circumstances, there wasone aggravating circumstance which existed and that itwas sufficient to uphold the death penalty. The onlydistinction betweenDobbert and the present case is thatin Dobbert, under Florida law, the judge determined thesentence without a jury."Gilliard, supra, at 586.Whether the Mississippi Supreme Court in Gilliard wasadopting the kind of harmless-error rule we approved inBarclay, 463 U. S., at 958, and if so, whether it applied thatsame rule in Stringer's case, are questions relating to themerits of Stringer's claim which we need not consider here.What is dispositive is the fact that the Mississippi SupremeCourt, which is the final authority on the meaning of Mississippi law, has at all times viewed the State's sentencingscheme as one in which aggravating factors are critical in503us1$44L 11-13-95 23:06:07 PAGES OPINPGT235Cite as: 503 U. S. 222 (1992)Opinion of the Courtthe jury's determination whether to impose the death pen-alty. See alsoEvans v. State, 422 So. 2d 737, 743 (Miss.1982) (applying Godfrey). It would be a strange rule of fed-eralism that ignores the view of the highest court of a Stateas to the meaning of its own law. See Teague v. Lane, 489U. S., at 310 (discussing federalism as one of the concernsunderlying the nonretroactivity principle).As a matter of federal law, moreover, the view of the Mis-sissippi Supreme Court thatGodfrey's dictates apply to itscapital sentencing procedure is correct. Indeed, it is so evi-dent that the issue was not even mentioned inClemons.There we took for granted, and the State did not challenge,the proposition that if a State uses aggravating factors indeciding who shall be eligible for the death penalty or whoshall receive the death penalty, it cannot use factors whichas a practical matter fail to guide the sentencer's discretion.See Clemons, 494 U. S., at 756, n. 1 (opinion of Blackmun, J.,joined by Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens, JJ., concurring inpart and dissenting in part) (noting that the unconstitutionality of the vague aggravating factor is implicit in the Court'sopinion).Even were we free to ignore the Mississippi SupremeCourt's understanding of the way its own law works, wewould reject the suggestion that Lowenfield could form thebasis for an argument that Godfrey does not apply to Mississippi. Although our precedents do not require the use ofaggravating factors, they have not permitted a State inwhich aggravating factors are decisive to use factors ofvague or imprecise content. A vague aggravating factoremployed for the purpose of determining whether a defendant is eligible for the death penalty fails to channel the sentencer's discretion. A vague aggravating factor used in theweighing process is in a sense worse, for it creates the riskthat the jury will treat the defendant as more deserving ofthe death penalty than he might otherwise be by relyingupon the existence of an illusory circumstance. Because the503us1$44L 11-13-95 23:06:07 PAGES OPINPGT236 STRINGER v. BLACKOpinion of the Courtuse of a vague aggravating factor in the weighing processcreates the possibility not only of randomness but also of biasin favor of the death penalty, we cautioned in Zant that theremight be a requirement that when the weighing process hasbeen infected with a vague factor the death sentence mustbe invalidated.Nothing inLowenfield suggests that the proscription ofvague aggravating factors does not apply to a capital sen-tencing system like Mississippi's.Lowenfield did not involve a claim that a statutory aggravating factor was ambig-uous, and its relevance toGodfrey, which it did not find itnecessary to cite, or the line of cases following from Godfrey,is slight at best.We also note that the State's reliance on Lowenfield toshow that it could not have anticipated Godfrey's applicationto Mississippi is somewhat odd. For Lowenfield, after all,was decided when the petitioner's conviction and sentencealready were final. It is a fiction for the State to contendthat in 1984 its courts relied on a 1988 decision. This is notto say that a State could not rely on a decision announcedafter a petitioner's conviction and sentence became final todefeat his claim on the merits. It could. Insofar as ournew rule jurisprudence "validates reasonable, good-faith interpretations of existing precedents," Butler v. McKellar,494 U. S., at 414, however, the State may have little cause tocomplain if in deciding to allow a petitioner to rely upon adecision the federal courts look only to those precedentswhich the state courts knew at the relevant time. In anyevent, we need not dwell on the anachronism inherent in theState's Lowenfield argument because, as we have concluded,that case does not provide a basis for concluding that it wasa new rule to apply Godfrey to the Mississippi system.The State next argues that Clemons' application of Godfrey to Mississippi could not have been dictated by precedentbecause prior to Clemons the Fifth Circuit concluded thatGodfrey did not apply to Mississippi. See Evans v. Thigpen,503us1$44L 11-13-95 23:06:07 PAGES OPINPGT237Cite as: 503 U. S. 222 (1992)Opinion of the Court809 F. 2d 239, cert. denied, 483 U. S. 1033 (1987); Johnson v.Thigpen, 806 F. 2d 1243 (1986), cert. denied, 480 U. S. 951(1987). Before addressing the merits of this argument wereiterate that the rationale of the Fifth Circuit has not beenadopted by the Mississippi Supreme Court, which, as a statecourt, is the primary beneficiary of the Teague doctrine.The Mississippi Supreme Court has recognized that it isbound by Godfrey. See, e. g., Mhoon v. State, 464 So. 2d 77,85 (1985) (requiring, based on Godfrey, that a capital sentencing jury be given a narrowing construction of the "heinous,atrocious or cruel" factor).The Fifth Circuit's pre-Clemons views are relevant to ourinquiry, see Butler, supra, at 415, but not dispositive. Thepurpose of the new rule doctrine is to validate reasonableinterpretations of existing precedents. Reasonableness, inthis as in many other contexts, is an objective standard, andthe ultimate decision whether Clemons was dictated byprecedent is based on an objective reading of the relevantcases. The short answer to the State's argument is that theFifth Circuit made a serious mistake in Evans v. Thigpenand Johnson v. Thigpen. The Fifth Circuit ignored the Mississippi Supreme Court's own characterization of its law andaccorded no significance to the fact that in Mississippi aggravating factors are central in the weighing phase of a capitalsentencing proceeding. As we have explained, when thesefacts are accorded their proper significance, the precedentseven before Maynard and Clemons yield a well-settled principle: Use of a vague or imprecise aggravating factor in theweighing process invalidates the sentence and at the veryleast requires constitutional harmless-error analysis or reweighing in the state judicial system.We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with thisopinion.
