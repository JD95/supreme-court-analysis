The case before us presents two questions: First, is thefederal bribery statute codified at 18 U. S. C. $ 666 limited tocases in which the bribe has a demonstrated effect upon fed-eral funds? Second, does the conspiracy prohibition contained in the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organiza-tions Act (RICO) apply only when the conspirator agrees tocommit two of the predicate acts RICO forbids? Rulingagainst the petitioner on both issues, we affirm the judgmentof the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.IThis federal prosecution arose from a bribery scheme op-erated by Brigido Marmolejo, the Sheriff of Hidalgo County,Texas, and petitioner Mario Salinas, one of his principaldeputies. In 1984, the United States Marshals Service andHidalgo County entered into agreements under which thecounty would take custody of federal prisoners. In exchange, the Federal Government agreed to make a grant tothe county for improving its jail and also agreed to pay thecounty a specific amount per day for each federal prisonerhoused. Based on the estimated number of federal prisoners to be maintained, payments to the county were projectedto be $915,785 per year. The record before us does not disclose the precise amounts paid. It is uncontested, however,that in each of the two periods relevant in this case the program resulted in federal payments to the county well in ex-cess of the $10,000 amount necessary for coverage under 18U. S. C. $ 666. (We denied certiorari on the question whetherthe moneys paid to the county were "benefits" under a "Fed*Joshua L. Dratel, Richard A. Greenberg, and Lisa Kemler filed a brieffor the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as amicus curiae urging reversal.522US1 Unit: $$U5 [01-27-00 19:04:02] PAGES PGT: OPLG55Cite as: 522 U. S. 52 (1997)Opinion of the Courteral program" under $ 666(b), and we assume for purposes ofthis opinion that the payments fit those definitions.)Homero Beltran-Aguirre was one of the federal prisonershoused in the jail under the arrangement negotiated betweenthe Marshals Service and the county. He was incarceratedthere for two intervals, first for 10 months and then for 5months. During both custody periods, Beltran paid Marmolejo a series of bribes in exchange for so-called "contactvisits" in which he remained alone with his wife or, on otheroccasions, his girlfriend. Beltran paid Marmolejo a fixedrate of $6,000 per month and $1,000 for each contact visit,which occurred twice a week. Petitioner Salinas was thechief deputy responsible for managing the jail and supervising custody of the prisoners. When Marmolejo was notavailable, Salinas arranged for the contact visits and on occasion stood watch outside the room where the visits tookplace. In return for his assistance with the scheme, Salinasreceived from Beltran a pair of designer watches and apickup truck.Salinas and Marmolejo were indicted and tried together,but only Salinas' convictions are before us. Salinas wascharged with one count of violating RICO, 18 U. S. C.$ 1962(c), one count of conspiracy to violate RICO, $ 1962(d),and two counts of bribery in violation of $ 666(a)(1)(B). Thejury acquitted Salinas on the substantive RICO count, butconvicted him on the RICO conspiracy count and the briberycounts. A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for theFifth Circuit affirmed, United States v. Marmolejo, 89 F. 3d1185 (1996), and we granted certiorari, 519 U. S. 1148 (1997).To resolve the case, we consider first the bribery scheme,then the conspiracy.IISalinas contends the Government must prove the bribein some way affected federal funds, for instance by diverting or misappropriating them, before the bribe violates522US1 Unit: $$U5 [01-27-00 19:04:02] PAGES PGT: OPLG56 SALINAS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court$ 666(a)(1)(B). The relevant statutory provisions are asfollows:"(a) Whoever, if the circumstance described in subsec-tion (b) of this section exists--"(1) being an agent of an organization, or of a State,local, or Indian tribal government, or any agencythereof--. . . . ."(B) corruptly . . . accepts or agrees to accept, any-thing of value from any person, intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business,transaction, or series of transactions of such organization, government, or agency involving any thing of valueof $5,000 or more; or. . . . ."shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than10 years, or both."(b) The circumstance referred to in subsection (a) ofthis section is that the organization, government, oragency receives, in any one year period, benefits inexcess of $10,000 under a Federal program involvinga grant, contract, subsidy, loan, guarantee, insurance,or other form of Federal assistance.. . . . ."(d) As used in this section--. . . . ."(5) the term `in any one-year period' means a continuous period that commences no earlier than twelvemonths before the commission of the offense or that endsno later than twelve months after the commission of theoffense. Such period may include time both before andafter the commission of the offense." 18 U. S. C. $ 666.The enactment's expansive, unqualified language, both asto the bribes forbidden and the entities covered, does notsupport the interpretation that federal funds must be af522US1 Unit: $$U5 [01-27-00 19:04:02] PAGES PGT: OPLG57Cite as: 522 U. S. 52 (1997)Opinion of the Courtfected to violate $ 666(a)(1)(B). Subject to the $5,000 thresh-old for the business or transaction in question, the statuteforbids acceptance of a bribe by a covered official who in-tends "to be influenced or rewarded in connection withany business, transaction, or series of transactions of [thedefined] organization, government or agency." $ 666(a)(1)(B).The prohibition is not confined to a business or transactionwhich affects federal funds. The word "any," which pre-faces the business or transaction clause, undercuts the attempt to impose this narrowing construction. See UnitedStates v. James, 478 U. S. 597, 604-605, and n. 5 (1986);Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 331 U. S. 519, 529(1947).Furthermore, the broad definition of the "circumstances"to which the statute applies provides no textual basis forlimiting the reach of the bribery prohibition. The statuteapplies to all cases in which an "organization, government,or agency" receives the statutory amount of benefits undera federal program. $ 666(b). The language reaches thescheme alleged, and proved, here.Neither does the statute limit the type of bribe offered.It prohibits accepting or agreeing to accept "anything ofvalue." $ 666(a)(1)(B). The phrase encompasses all transfers of personal property or other valuable considerationin exchange for the influence or reward. It includes, then,the personal property given to Salinas in exchange for thefavorable treatment Beltran secured for himself. The statute's plain language fails to provide any basis for limiting$ 666(a)(1)(B) to bribes affecting federal funds.Salinas attempts to circumscribe the statutory text bypointing to its legislative history. "Courts in applying criminal laws generally must follow the plain and unambiguousmeaning of the statutory language. `[O]nly the most extraordinary showing of contrary intentions' in the legislativehistory will justify a departure from that language."United States v. Albertini, 472 U. S. 675, 680 (1985) (citations522US1 Unit: $$U5 [01-27-00 19:04:02] PAGES PGT: OPLG58 SALINAS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtomitted) (quoting Garcia v. United States, 469 U. S. 70, 75(1984)); see alsoArdestani v. INS, 502 U. S. 129, 135 (1991)(courts may deviate from the plain language of a statute onlyin " `rare and exceptional circumstances' ").The construction Salinas seeks cannot stand when viewedin light of the statutory framework in existence before $ 666was enacted and the expanded coverage prescribed by thenew statute. Before $ 666 was enacted, the federal criminalcode contained a single, general bribery provision codified at18 U. S. C. $ 201. Section 201 by its terms applied only to"public official[s]," which the statute defined as "officer[s] oremployee[s] or person[s] acting for or on behalf of the UnitedStates, or any department, agency or branch of Governmentthereof, including the District of Columbia, in any officialfunction, under or by authority of any such department,agency, or branch." $ 201(a). The Courts of Appeals divided over whether state and local employees could be considered "public officials" under $ 201(a). Compare UnitedStates v. Del Toro, 513 F. 2d 656, 661-662 (CA2), cert. denied,423 U. S. 826 (1975), with United States v. Mosley, 659 F. 2d812, 814-816 (CA7 1981), and United States v. Hinton, 683F. 2d 195, 197-200 (CA7 1982), aff 'd sub nom. Dixson v.United States, 465 U. S. 482 (1984). Without awaiting thisCourt's resolution of the issue in Dixson, Congress enacted$ 666 and made it clear that federal law applies to bribes ofthe kind offered to the state and local officials in Del Toro,as well as those at issue in Mosley and Hinton.As this chronology and the statutory language demonstrate, $ 666(a)(1)(B) was designed to extend federal briberyprohibitions to bribes offered to state and local officials employed by agencies receiving federal funds. It would be incongruous to restrict $ 666 in the manner Salinas suggests.The facts and reasoning of Del Toro give particular instruction in this respect. In that case, the Second Circuit heldthat a city employee was not a "public official" under $ 201(a)even though federal funds would eventually cover 100% of522US1 Unit: $$U5 [01-27-00 19:04:02] PAGES PGT: OPLG59Cite as: 522 U. S. 52 (1997)Opinion of the Courtthe costs and 80% of the salaries of the program he adminis-tered. 513 F. 2d, at 662. Because the program had not yetentered a formal request for federal funding, the Second Cir-cuit reasoned, "[t]here were no existing committed federalfunds for the purpose." Ibid. The enactment of $ 666 fore-closes this type of limitation. Acceptance of Salinas' suggestion that a bribe must affect federal funds before it fallswithin $ 666(a)(1)(B) would run contrary to the statutoryexpansion that redressed the negative effects of the SecondCircuit's narrow construction of $ 201 inDel Toro. We neednot consider whether the statute requires some other kindof connection between a bribe and the expenditure of federalfunds, for in this case the bribe was related to the housingof a prisoner in facilities paid for in significant part by federalfunds themselves. And that relationship is close enough tosatisfy whatever connection the statute might require.Salinas argues in addition that our decisions inGregory v.Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452 (1991), and McNally v. United States,483 U. S. 350 (1987), require a plain statement of congres-sional intent before $ 666(a)(1)(B) can be construed to applyto bribes having no effect on federal funds. In so arguing,however, Salinas makes too much ofGregory and McNally.In each of those cases, we confronted a statute susceptible oftwo plausible interpretations, one of which would have al-tered the existing balance of federal and state powers. Weconcluded that, absent a clear indication of Congress' intentto change the balance, the proper course was to adopt a construction which maintains the existing balance. Gregory,supra, at 460-461; see also McNally, supra, at 360."No rule of construction, however, requires that a penalstatute be strained and distorted in order to exclude conductclearly intended to be within its scope . . . ." United Statesv. Raynor, 302 U. S. 540, 552 (1938). As we held in Albertini, supra, at 680:"Statutes should be construed to avoid constitutionalquestions, but this interpretative canon is not a license522US1 Unit: $$U5 [01-27-00 19:04:02] PAGES PGT: OPLG60 SALINAS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtfor the judiciary to rewrite language enacted by the leg-islature. Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U. S. 728, 741-742(1984). Any other conclusion, while purporting to bean exercise in judicial restraint, would trench upon thelegislative powers vested in Congress by Art. I, $ 1, ofthe Constitution.United States v. Locke, 471 U. S. 84,95-96 (1985)."These principles apply to the rules of statutory construc-tion we have followed to give proper respect to the federalstate balance. As we observed in applying an analogousmaxim in Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44(1996), "[w]e cannot press statutory construction to the pointof disingenuous evasion even to avoid a constitutional question." Id., at 57, n. 9 (internal quotation marks omitted).Gregory itself held as much when it noted the principle itarticulated did not apply when a statute was unambiguous.See 501 U. S., at 467. A statute can be unambiguous without addressing every interpretive theory offered by a party.It need only be "plain to anyone reading the Act" that thestatute encompasses the conduct at issue. Ibid. CompareUnited States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 349-350 (1971) (relyingon Congress' failure to make a clear statement of its intention to alter the federal-state balance to construe an ambigu-ous firearm-possession statute to apply only to firearms affecting commerce), with United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S.549, 561-562 (1995) (refusing to applyBass to read a similarlimitation into an unambiguous firearm-possession statute).The plain-statement requirement articulated in Gregoryand McNally does not warrant a departure from the statute's terms. The text of $ 666(a)(1)(B) is unambiguous onthe point under consideration here, and it does not requirethe Government to prove federal funds were involved in thebribery transaction.Furthermore, there is no serious doubt about the consti-tutionality of $ 666(a)(1)(B) as applied to the facts of thiscase. Beltran was without question a prisoner held in a jail522US1 Unit: $$U5 [01-27-00 19:04:02] PAGES PGT: OPLG61Cite as: 522 U. S. 52 (1997)Opinion of the Courtmanaged pursuant to a series of agreements with the Fed-eral Government. The preferential treatment accorded tohim was a threat to the integrity and proper operation ofthe federal program. Whatever might be said about$ 666(a)(1)(B)'s application in other cases, the application of$ 666(a)(1)(B) to Salinas did not extend federal power beyondits proper bounds. See Westfall v. United States, 274 U. S.256, 259 (1927).In so holding, we do not address $ 666(a)(1)(B)'s applicabil-ity to intangible benefits such as contact visits, because thatquestion is not fairly included within the questions on whichwe granted certiorari. SeeYee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519,533 (1992). Nor do we review the Court of Appeals' determination that the transactions at issue "involv[ed] any thingof value of $5,000 or more," since Salinas does not offer anycognizable challenge to that aspect of the Court of Appeals'decision. We simply decide that, as a matter of statutoryconstruction, $ 666(a)(1)(B) does not require the Governmentto prove the bribe in question had any particular influenceon federal funds and that under this construction the statuteis constitutional as applied in this case.IIISalinas directs his second challenge to his conviction forconspiracy to violate RICO. There could be no conspiracyoffense, he says, unless he himself committed or agreed tocommit the two predicate acts requisite for a substantiveRICO offense under $ 1962(c). Salinas identifies a conflictamong the Courts of Appeals on the point. Decisions of theFirst, Second, and Tenth Circuits require that, under theRICO conspiracy provision, the defendant must himself commit or agree to commit two or more predicate acts. SeeUnited States v. Sanders, 929 F. 2d 1466, 1473 (CA10), cert.denied, 502 U. S. 846 (1991); United States v. Ruggiero, 726F. 2d 913, 921 (CA2), cert. denied sub nom. Rabito v. UnitedStates, 469 U.

S. 1011 (1983). Eightother Courts of Appeals, including the Fifth Circuit in thiscase, take a contrary view. See United States v. Pryba, 900F. 2d 748, 760 (CA4), cert. denied, 498 U. S. 924 (1990);UnitedStates v. Kragness, 830 F. 2d 842, 860 (CA8 1987); UnitedStates v. Neapolitan, 791 F. 2d 489, 494-500 (CA7), cert. de-nied, 479 U. S. 940 (1986);United States v.

S. 819 (1984).Before turning to RICO's conspiracy provision, we notethe substantive RICO offense, which was the goal of the con-spiracy alleged in the indictment. It provides:"It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activitiesof which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to con-duct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conductof such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of rack-eteering activity or collection of unlawful debt." 18U. S. C. $ 1962(c).The elements predominant in a subsection (c) violation are:(1) the conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern ofracketeering activity. SeeSedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co.,473 U. S. 479, 496 (1985). "Pattern of racketeering activity"is a defined term and requires at least two acts of "racketeering activity," the so-called predicate acts central to our discussion. 18 U. S. C. $ 1961(5). "Racketeering activity," inturn, is defined to include "any act . . . involving . . . bribery. . . which is chargeable under State law and punishable byimprisonment for more than one year." $ 1961(1)(A). TheGovernment's theory was that Salinas himself committed asubstantive $ 1962(c) RICO violation by conducting the en522US1 Unit: $$U5 [01-27-00 19:04:02] PAGES PGT: OPLG63Cite as: 522 U. S. 52 (1997)Opinion of the Courtterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activitythat included acceptance of two or more bribes, felonies punishable in Texas by more than one year in prison. See Tex.Penal Code Ann. $ 36.02(a)(1) (1994). The jury acquitted onthe substantive count. Salinas was convicted of conspiracy,however, and he challenges the conviction because the jurywas not instructed that he must have committed or agreedto commit two predicate acts himself. His interpretation ofthe conspiracy statute is wrong.The RICO conspiracy statute, simple in formulation,provides:"It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to vio-late any of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) ofthis section." 18 U. S. C. $ 1962(d).There is no requirement of some overt act or specific act inthe statute before us, unlike the general conspiracy provisionapplicable to federal crimes, which requires that at least oneof the conspirators have committed an "act to effect the ob-ject of the conspiracy." $ 371. The RICO conspiracy provision, then, is even more comprehensive than the general con-spiracy offense in $ 371.In interpreting the provisions of $ 1962(d), we adhere to ageneral rule: When Congress uses well-settled terminologyof criminal law, its words are presumed to have their ordinary meaning and definition. See Morissette v. UnitedStates, 342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952). The relevant statutoryphrase in $ 1962(d) is "to conspire." We presume Congressintended to use the term in its conventional sense, and certain well-established principles follow.A conspiracy may exist even if a conspirator does notagree to commit or facilitate each and every part of the substantive offense. See United States v. Socony-Vacuum OilCo., 310 U. S. 150, 253-254 (1940). The partners in the criminal plan must agree to pursue the same criminal objectiveand may divide up the work, yet each is responsible for the522US1 Unit: $$U5 [01-27-00 19:04:02] PAGES PGT: OPLG64 SALINAS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtacts of each other. See Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U. S.640, 646 (1946) ("And so long as the partnership in crimecontinues, the partners act for each other in carrying it for-ward"). If conspirators have a plan which calls for someconspirators to perpetrate the crime and others to providesupport, the supporters are as guilty as the perpetrators.As Justice Holmes observed: "[P]lainly a person may conspire for the commission of a crime by a third person."United States v. Holte, 236 U. S. 140, 144 (1915). A person,moreover, may be liable for conspiracy even though he wasincapable of committing the substantive offense.UnitedStates v. Rabinowich, 238 U. S. 78, 86 (1915).The point Salinas tries to make is in opposition to theseprinciples, and is refuted by Bannon v. United States, 156U. S. 464 (1895). There the defendants were charged withconspiring to violate the general conspiracy statute, id., at464, which requires proof of an overt act. See supra, at 63.One defendant objected to the indictment because it did notallege he had committed an overt act. See Bannon, supra,at 468. We rejected the argument because it would erodethe common-law principle that, so long as they share a common purpose, conspirators are liable for the acts of their coconspirators. We observed in Bannon: "To require an overtact to be proven against every member of the conspiracy, ora distinct act connecting him with the combination to be alleged, would not only be an innovation upon established principles, but would render most prosecutions for the offencenugatory." 156 U. S., at 469. The RICO conspiracy statute,$ 1962(d), broadened conspiracy coverage by omitting the requirement of an overt act; it did not, at the same time, workthe radical change of requiring the Government to proveeach conspirator agreed that he would be the one to committwo predicate acts.Our recitation of conspiracy law comports with contemporary understanding. When Congress passed RICO in 1970,see Pub. L. 91-452, $ 901(a), 84 Stat. 941, the American Law522US1 Unit: $$U5 [01-27-00 19:04:02] PAGES PGT: OPLG65Cite as: 522 U. S. 52 (1997)Opinion of the CourtInstitute's Model Penal Code permitted a person to be con-victed of conspiracy so long as he "agrees with such otherperson or persons that they or one or more of them will en-gage in conduct that constitutes such crime." Model PenalCode $ 5.03(1)(a) (1962). As the drafters emphasized, "solong as the purpose of the agreement is to facilitate commis-sion of a crime, the actor need not agree `to commit' thecrime." American Law Institute, Model Penal Code, Tent.Draft No. 10, p. 117 (1960). The Model Penal Code still usesthis formulation. See Model Penal Code $ 5.03(1)(a), 10U. L. A. 501 (1974).A conspirator must intend to further an endeavor which, ifcompleted, would satisfy all of the elements of a substantivecriminal offense, but it suffices that he adopt the goal of furthering or facilitating the criminal endeavor. He may do soin any number of ways short of agreeing to undertake all ofthe acts necessary for the crime's completion. One can be aconspirator by agreeing to facilitate only some of the actsleading to the substantive offense. It is elementary that aconspiracy may exist and be punished whether or not thesubstantive crime ensues, for the conspiracy is a distinct evil,dangerous to the public, and so punishable in itself. SeeCallanan v. United States, 364 U. S. 587, 594 (1961).It makes no difference that the substantive offense under$ 1962(c) requires two or more predicate acts. The interplaybetween subsections (c) and (d) does not permit us to excusefrom the reach of the conspiracy provision an actor who doesnot himself commit or agree to commit the two or more predicate acts requisite to the underlying offense. True, thoughan "enterprise" under $ 1962(c) can exist with only one actorto conduct it, in most instances it will be conducted by morethan one person or entity; and this in turn may make it somewhat difficult to determine just where the enterprise endsand the conspiracy begins, or, on the other hand, whetherthe two crimes are coincident in their factual circumstances.In some cases the connection the defendant had to the al522US1 Unit: $$U5 [01-27-00 19:04:02] PAGES PGT: OPLG66 SALINAS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtleged enterprise or to the conspiracy to further it may betenuous enough so that his own commission of two predicateacts may become an important part of the Government'scase. Perhaps these were the considerations leading someof the Circuits to require in conspiracy cases that each con-spirator himself commit or agree to commit two or morepredicate acts. Nevertheless, that proposition cannot besustained as a definition of the conspiracy offense, for it iscontrary to the principles we have discussed.In the case before us, even if Salinas did not accept oragree to accept two bribes, there was ample evidence thathe conspired to violate subsection (c). The evidence showedthat Marmolejo committed at least two acts of racketeeringactivity when he accepted numerous bribes and that Salinasknew about and agreed to facilitate the scheme. This is suf-ficient to support a conviction under $ 1962(d).As a final matter, Salinas says his statutory interpretationis required by the rule of lenity. The rule does not applywhen a statute is unambiguous or when invoked to engraftan illogical requirement to its text. SeeUnited States v.Shabani, 513 U. S. 10, 17 (1994).The judgment of the Court of Appeals is Affirmed.522US1 Unit: $$U6 [01-27-00 19:07:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN67OCTOBER TERM, 1997SyllabusFOSTER, GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA, et al. v.LOVEet al.certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuitNo. 96-670. Argued October 6, 1997--Decided December 2, 1997The Elections Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, $ 4, cl. 1, invests theStates with responsibility for the mechanics of congressional elections,see Storer v. Brown, 415 U. S. 724, 730, but grants Congress "the powerto override state regulations" by establishing uniform rules for federalelections, U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U.

C. $ 1, and Representative, $ 7,and mandates holding all congressional and Presidential elections on asingle November day, 2 U. S. C. $$ 1, 7; 3 U. S. C. $ 1. Since 1978, Louisiana has held in October of a federal election year an "open primary" forcongressional offices, in which all candidates, regardless of party, appearon the same ballot and all voters are entitled to vote. If a candidatefor a given office receives a majority at the open primary, the candidate"is elected" and no further act is done on federal election day to fillthat office. Since this system went into effect, over 80% of the State'scontested congressional elections have ended as a matter of law withthe open primary. Respondents, Louisiana voters, challenged this primary as a violation of federal law. Finding no conflict between thestate and federal statutes, the District Court granted summary judgment to petitioners, the State's Governor and secretary of state. TheFifth Circuit reversed.Held: Louisiana's statute conflicts with federal law to the extent that it isapplied to select a congressional candidate in October. Pp. 71-74.(a) The issue here is a narrow one turning entirely on the meaning ofthe state and federal statutes. There is no colorable argument that $ 7goes beyond the ample limits of the Elections Clause's grant of authorityto Congress. In speaking of "the election" of a Senator or Representative, the federal statutes plainly refer to the combined actions of votersand officials meant to make the final selection of an officeholder; and byestablishing "the day" on which these actions must take place, the statutes simply regulate the time of the election, a matter on which theConstitution explicitly gives Congress the final say. Pp. 71-72.(b) A contested selection of candidates for a congressional office thatis concluded as a matter of law before the federal election day, with no522US1 Unit: $$U6 [01-27-00 19:07:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN68 FOSTER v. LOVEOpinion of the Courtact in law or in fact to take place on the date chosen by Congress,clearly violates $ 7. Louisiana's claim that its system concerns only themanner, not the time, of an election is at odds with the State's statute,which addresses timing quite as obviously as $ 7 does. A federal election takes place in Louisiana before federal election day whenever acandidate gets a majority in the open primary. Pp. 72-73.(c) This Court's judgment is buttressed by the fact that Louisiana'sopen primary has tended to foster both evils identified by Congress asreasons for passing the federal statute: the distortion of the voting process when the results of an early federal election in one State can influence later voting in other States, and the burden on citizens forced toturn out on two different election days to make final selections of federalofficers in Presidential election years.

IThe Elections Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, $ 4, cl.1, provides that "[t]he Times, Places and Manner of holdingElections for Senators and Representatives, shall be pre-scribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but theCongress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regu-lations." The Clause is a default provision; it invests theStates with responsibility for the mechanics of congressionalelections, seeStorer v. Brown, 415 U. S. 724, 730 (1974), butonly so far as Congress declines to pre-empt state legislativechoices, see Roudebush v. Hartke, 405 U. S. 15, 24 (1972)("Unless Congress acts, Art. I, $ 4, empowers the States toregulate"). Thus it is well settled that the Elections Clausegrants Congress "the power to override state regulations"by establishing uniform rules for federal elections, bindingon the States.U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514U. S. 779, 832-833 (1995). "[T]he regulations made by Congress are paramount to those made by the State legislature;and if they conflict therewith, the latter, so far as the conflictextends, ceases to be operative." Ex parte Siebold, 100U. S. 371, 384 (1880).One congressional rule adopted under the Elections Clause(and its counterpart for the Executive Branch, Art. II, $ 1,cl. 3) sets the date of the biennial election for federal offices.See 2 U. S. C. $$ 1, 7; 3 U. S. C. $ 1. Title 2 U. S. C. $ 7 wasoriginally enacted in 1872, and now provides that "[t]heTuesday next after the 1st Monday in November, in everyeven numbered year, is established as the day for the elec-tion, in each of the States and Territories of the UnitedStates, of Representatives and Delegates to the Congresscommencing on the 3d day of January next thereafter."This provision, along with 2 U. S. C. $ 1 (setting the same522US1 Unit: $$U6 [01-27-00 19:07:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN70 FOSTER v. LOVEOpinion of the Courtrule for electing Senators under the Seventeenth Amend-ment) and 3 U. S. C. $ 1 (doing the same for selecting Presidential electors), mandates holding all elections for Congressand the Presidency on a single day throughout the Union.In 1975, Louisiana adopted a new statutory scheme forelecting United States Senators and Representatives. InOctober of a federal election year, the State holds what ispopularly known as an "open primary" for congressional offices, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 18:402(B)(1) (West Supp. 1997), inwhich all candidates, regardless of party, appear on the sameballot, and all voters, with like disregard of party, are enti-tled to vote, $ 18:401(B) (West 1979). If no candidate for agiven office receives a majority, the State holds a run-off(dubbed a "general election") between the top two votegetters the following month on federal election day. $ 18:481(West 1979). But if one such candidate does get a majorityin October, that candidate "is elected," $ 18:511(A) (WestSupp. 1997), and no further act is done on federal electionday to fill the office in question. Since this system wentinto effect in 1978, over 80% of the contested congressionalelections in Louisiana have ended as a matter of law withthe open primary.1Respondents are Louisiana voters who sued petitioners,the State's Governor and secretary of state, challenging theopen primary as a violation of federal law. The DistrictCourt granted summary judgment to petitioners, finding noconflict between the state and federal statutes, whereas adivided panel of the Fifth Circuit reversed, concluding thatLouisiana's system squarely "conflicts with the federal stat-utes that establish a uniform federal election day." 90 F. 3d1026, 1031 (1996). We granted certiorari, 520 U. S. 1114(1997), and now affirm.1 A run-off election has been held on federal election day in only 9 of the57 contested elections for United States Representative and in only 1 ofthe 6 contested elections for United States Senator. See 90 F. 3d 1026,1030 (CA5 1996).522US1 Unit: $$U6 [01-27-00 19:07:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN71Cite as: 522 U. S. 67 (1997)Opinion of the CourtIIThe Fifth Circuit's conception of the issue here as a narrowone turning entirely on the meaning of the state and federalstatutes is exactly right. For all of petitioners' invocationsof state sovereignty, there is no colorable argument that $ 7goes beyond the ample limits of the Elections Clause's grantof authority to Congress.2 When the federal statutes speakof "the election" of a Senator or Representative, they plainlyrefer to the combined actions of voters and officials meant tomake a final selection of an officeholder (subject only to thepossibility of a later run-off, see 2 U. S. C. $ 8).3 See N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language 433(C. Goodrich & N. Porter eds. 1869) (defining "election" as"[t]he act of choosing a person to fill an office"). By establishing a particular day as "the day" on which these actionsmust take place, the statutes simply regulate the time of the2 The Clause gives Congress "comprehensive" authority to regulate thedetails of elections, including the power to impose "the numerous requirements as to procedure and safeguards which experience shows are necessary in order to enforce the fundamental right involved." Smiley v.Holm, 285 U. S. 355, 366 (1932). Congressional authority extends not onlyto general elections, but also to any "primary election which involves anecessary step in the choice of candidates for election as representativesin Congress." United States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299, 320 (1941).3 Title 2 U. S. C. $ 8, which was enacted along with $ 7, provides that aState may hold a congressional election on a day other than the uniformfederal election day when such an election is necessitated "by a failure toelect at the time prescribed by law." The only explanation of this provision offered in the legislative history is Senator Allen G. Thurman's statement that "there can be no failure to elect except in those States in whicha majority of all the votes is necessary to elect a member." Cong. Globe,42d Cong., 2d Sess., 677 (1872). In those States, if no candidate receivesa majority vote on federal election day, there has been a failure to electand a subsequent run-off election is required. See Public Citizen, Inc. v.Miller, 813 F. Supp. 821 (ND Ga.), aff'd, 992 F. 2d 1548 (CA11 1993) (upholding under $ 8 a run-off election that was held after federal electionday, because in the initial election on federal election day no candidatereceived the majority vote that was as required by Georgia law).522US1 Unit: $$U6 [01-27-00 19:07:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN72 FOSTER v. LOVEOpinion of the Courtelection, a matter on which the Constitution explicitly givesCongress the final say.While true that there is room for argument about justwhat may constitute the final act of selection within themeaning of the law, our decision does not turn on any nicetyin isolating precisely what acts a State must cause to be doneon federal election day (and not before it) in order to satisfythe statute. Without paring the term "election" in $ 7 downto the definitional bone, it is enough to resolve this case tosay that a contested selection of candidates for a congressional office that is concluded as a matter of law before thefederal election day, with no act in law or in fact to takeplace on the date chosen by Congress, clearly violates $ 7.4Petitioners try to save the Louisiana system by arguingthat, because Louisiana law provides for a "general election"on federal election day in those unusual instances when oneis needed, the open primary system concerns only the "man-ner" of electing federal officials, not the "time" at which theelections will take place. Petitioners say that "[a]lthoughCongress is authorized by the Constitution to alter or changethe time, place and manner the States have chosen to con-duct federal elections[,] in enacting 2 U. S. C. $$ 1 and 7, Congress sought only to alter the time in which elections wereconducted, not their manner. Conversely, the open electionssystem [changed only the manner by which Louisianachooses its federal officers; it] did not change the timing ofthe general election for Congress." Brief for Petitioners 21.Even if the distinction mattered here, the State's attemptto draw this time-manner line is merely wordplay, and word-play just as much at odds with the Louisiana statute as thatlaw is at odds with $ 7. The State's provision for an Octoberelection addresses timing quite as obviously as $ 7 does.4 This case thus does not present the question whether a State mustalways employ the conventional mechanics of an election. We hold todayonly that if an election does take place, it may not be consummated priorto federal election day.522US1 Unit: $$U6 [01-27-00 19:07:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN73Cite as: 522 U. S. 67 (1997)Opinion of the CourtState law straightforwardly provides that "[a] candidate whoreceives a majority of the votes cast for an office in a primaryelection is elected." La. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 18:511(A) (WestSupp. 1997). Because the candidate said to be "elected" hasbeen selected by the voters from among all eligible officeseekers, there is no reason to suspect that the Louisiana Legislature intended some eccentric meaning for the phrase "iselected." After a declaration that a candidate received amajority in the open primary, state law requires no furtheract by anyone to seal the election; the election has alreadyoccurred. Thus, contrary to petitioners' imaginative characterization of the state statute, the open primary does purport to affect the timing of federal elections: a federal election takes place prior to federal election day whenever acandidate gets a majority in the open primary. As the attorney general of Louisiana conceded at oral argument, "Louisiana's system certainly allows for the election of a candidatein October, as opposed to actually electing on Federal Election Day." Tr. of Oral Arg. 6.IIIWhile the conclusion that Louisiana's open primary systemconflicts with 2 U. S. C. $ 7 does not depend on discerning theintent behind the federal statute, our judgment is buttressedby an appreciation of Congress's object "to remedy morethan one evil arising from the election of members of Congress occurring at different times in the different States."Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U. S. 651, 661 (1884). As the sponsor of the original bill put it, Congress was concerned bothwith the distortion of the voting process threatened whenthe results of an early federal election in one State can influence later voting in other States, and with the burden oncitizens forced to turn out on two different election days tomake final selections of federal officers in Presidential election years:522US1 Unit: $$U6 [01-27-00 19:07:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN74 FOSTER v.

I can remem-ber, in 1840, when the news from Pennsylvania and otherStates that held their elections prior to the presidentialelection settled the presidential election as effectuallyas it was afterward done . . . . I agree . . . that Indiana,Ohio, and Pennsylvania, by voting in October, have aninfluence. But what I contend is that that is an undueadvantage, that it is a wrong, and that it is a wrong alsoto the people of those States, that once in four yearsthey shall be put to the trouble of having a double election." Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 2d Sess., 141 (1871) (re-marks of Rep. Butler).See also Busbee v. Smith, 549 F. Supp. 494, 524 (DC 1982)(recounting the purposes of $ 7), aff 'd, 459 U. S. 1166 (1983).The Louisiana open primary has tended to foster both evils,having had the effect of conclusively electing more than 80%of the State's Senators and Representatives before the elec-tion day elsewhere, and, in Presidential election years, having forced voters to turn out for two potentially conclusivefederal elections.IVWhen Louisiana's statute is applied to select from amongcongressional candidates in October, it conflicts with federal law and to that extent is void. The judgment belowis affirmed.
