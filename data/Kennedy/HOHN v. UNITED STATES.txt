S. 236 (1998)Opinion of the Courting applications for certificates of appealability. The Court,we hold, does have jurisdiction.IIn 1992, petitioner Arnold Hohn was charged with a num-ber of drug-related offenses, including the use or carrying ofa firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense,18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1). Over defense counsel's objection, theDistrict Court instructed the jury that "use" of a firearmmeant having the firearm "available to aid in the commissionof " the offense. App. 7, 32. The jury convicted Hohn on allcounts. Hohn did not challenge the instruction in his directappeal, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. United States v.Hohn, 8 F. 3d 1301 (CA8 1993).Two years after Hohn's conviction became final, we heldthe term "use" in $ 924(c)(1) required active employment ofthe firearm. Proximity and accessibility alone were not sufficient. Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137 (1995). Hohnfiled apro se motion under 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 to vacate his18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1) conviction in light of Bailey on thegrounds the evidence presented at his trial was insufficientto prove use of a firearm. Although the Government conceded the jury instruction given at Hohn's trial did not com-ply withBailey, the District Court denied relief because, inits view, Hohn had waived the claim by failing to challengethe instruction on direct appeal.While Hohn's motion was pending before the DistrictCourt, Congress enacted the Antiterrorism and EffectiveDeath Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214. Section 102 of AEDPA amends the statutory provision whichhad required state prisoners to obtain a certificate of probable cause before appealing the denial of a habeas petition.The amended provision provides:"Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate ofappealability, an appeal may not be taken to the courtof appeals from--524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN240 HOHN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court"(A) the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding inwhich the detention complained of arises out of processissued by a State court; or"(B) the final order in a proceeding under section2255." 28 U. S. C. $ 2253(c)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. II).Certificates of appealability may issue "only if the applicanthas made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right." $ 2253(c)(2).Hohn filed a notice of appeal on July 29, 1996, three monthsafter AEDPA's enactment. The Court of Appeals treatedthe notice of appeal as an application for a certificate of appealability and referred it to a three-judge panel. The paneldecided Hohn's application did not meet the standard for a$ 2253(c) certificate. In the panel's view, "Bailey did nomore than interpret a statute, and an incorrect applicationof a statute by a district court, or any other court, does notviolate the Constitution." 99 F. 3d 892, 893 (CA8 1996).Given this determination, the panel declined to issue a cer-tificate of appealability.Judge McMillian dissented. In his view, Bailey castdoubt on whether Hohn's conduct in fact violated 18 U. S. C.$ 924(c)(1). The Due Process Clause, he reasoned, does not"tolerat[e] convictions for conduct that was never criminal,"so Hohn had made a sufficient showing of a constitutionaldeprivation. 99 F. 3d, at 895. When the Court of Appealsdenied Hohn's rehearing petition and a suggestion for re-hearing en banc, four judges noted they would have grantedthe suggestion.Hohn petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari to review the denial of the certificate, seeking to invoke our juris-diction under 28 U. S. C. $ 1254(1). The Government nowfound itself in agreement with Hohn, saying his claim was,in fact, constitutional in nature. It asked us to vacate thejudgment and remand so the Court of Appeals could recon-sider in light of this concession. We may not vacate andremand, of course, unless we first have jurisdiction over the524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN241Cite as: 524 U. S. 236 (1998)Opinion of the Courtcase; and since Hohn and the Government both argue infavor of our jurisdiction, we appointed an amicus curiae toargue the contrary position. 522 U. S. 944 (1997).IITitle 28 U. S. C. $ 1254 is the statute most often invokedfor jurisdiction in this Court. It provides in relevant part:"Cases in the courts of appeals may be reviewed bythe Supreme Court by the following methods:"(1) By writ of certiorari granted upon the petition ofany party to any civil or criminal case, before or afterrendition of judgment or decree."The first phrase of the quoted statute confines our jurisdic-tion to "[c]ases in" the courts of appeals. Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731, 741-742 (1982). The question is whetheran application for a certificate meets the description.There can be little doubt that Hohn's application for acertificate of appealability constitutes a case under $ 1254(1).As we have noted, "[t]he words `case' and `cause' are con-stantly used as synonyms in statutes . . . , each meaninga proceeding in court, a suit, or action." Blyew v. UnitedStates, 13 Wall. 581, 595 (1872). The dispute over Hohn'sentitlement to a certificate falls within this definition. It isa proceeding seeking relief for an immediate and redressableinjury,i. e., wrongful detention in violation of the Constitu-tion. There is adversity as well as the other requisite qualities of a "case" as the term is used in both Article III of theConstitution and the statute here under consideration. Thisis significant, we think, for cases are addressed in the ordi-nary course of the judicial process, and, as a general rule,when the district court has denied relief and applicable re-quirements of finality have been satisfied, the next step isreview in the court of appeals. That the statute permits thecertificate to be issued by a "circuit justice or judge" doesnot mean the action of the circuit judge in denying the cer524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN242 HOHN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courttificate is his or her own action, rather than the action of thecourt of appeals to whom the judge is appointed.The course of events here illustrates the point. The appli-cation moved through the Eighth Circuit in the same manneras cases in general do. The matter was entered on thedocket of the Court of Appeals, submitted to a panel, anddecided in a published opinion, including a dissent. App.4-5. The court entered judgment on it, issued a mandate,and entertained a petition for rehearing and suggestion forrehearing en banc. Id., at 5-6. The Eighth Circuit hassince acknowledged its rejection of Hohn's application madeCircuit law. United States v. Apker, 101 F. 3d 75 (CA81996), cert. pending, No. 97-5460. One judge specificallyindicated he was bound by the decision even though hebelieved it was wrongly decided. 101 F. 3d, at 75-76 (Henley, J., concurring in result). These factors suggest Hohn'scertificate application was as much a case in the Court ofAppeals as are the other matters decided by it.We also draw guidance from the fact that every Court ofAppeals except the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has adopted Rules to govern the dispositionof certificate applications. E. g., Rules 22, 22.1 (CA1 1998);Rules 22, 27(b) and (f) (CA2 1998); Rules 3.4, 22.1, 111.3(b)and (c), 111.4(a) and (b)(vii) (CA3 1998); Rules 22(a) and(b)(3)(g), 34(b) (CA4 1998); Rules 8.1(g), 8.6, 8.10, 22, 27.2.3(CA5 1998); Rules 28(f), (g), and ( j) (CA6 1998); Rules22(a)(2), (h)(2), and (h)(3)(i), 22.1 (CA7 1998); Rules 22A(d),27B(b)(2) and (c)(2) (CA8 1998); Rules 3-1(b), 22-2, 22-3(a)(3)and (b)(4), 22-4(c), 22-5(c), (d)(1), (d)(3), and (e) (CA9 1998);Rules 11.2(b), 22.1, 22.2.3 (CA10 1998); Rules 22-1, 22-3(a)(3),(a)(4), (a)(6), and (a)(7), and (b), 27-1(d)(3) (CA11 1998). Wealso note the Internal Operating Procedures for the Court ofAppeals for the Eighth Circuit require certificate applications to be heard as a general matter by three-judge administrative panels.

S. C. $ 44, but it is true as well thecourt of appeals "consist[s] of the circuit judges of the circuitin regular active service," $ 43. In this instance, as in allother cases of which we are aware, the order denying thecertificate was issued in the name of the court and under itsseal. That is as it should be, for the order was judicial incharacter and had consequences with respect to the finalityof the order of the District Court and the continuing jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals.The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure make specificprovision for consideration of applications for certificates ofappealability by the entire court. Rule 22(b) states:"In a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detentioncomplained of arises out of process issued by a Statecourt, an appeal by the applicant for the writ may notproceed unless a district or a circuit judge issues a certificate of appealability pursuant to section 2253(c) oftitle 28, United States Code. . . . If the district judge hasdenied the certificate, the applicant for the writ maythen request issuance of the certificate by a circuit524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN244 HOHN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtjudge. If such a request is addressed to the court ofappeals, it shall be deemed addressed to the judgesthereof and shall be considered by a circuit judge orjudges as the court deems appropriate. If no expressrequest for a certificate is filed, the notice of appeal shallbe deemed to constitute a request addressed to thejudges of the court of appeals."On its face, the Rule applies only to state, and not federal,prisoners. It is nonetheless instructive on the proper construction of $ 2253(c).Rule 22(b) by no means prohibits application to an individual judge, nor could it, given the language of the statute.There would be incongruity, nevertheless, were the sameruling deemed in one instance the order of a judge actingex curia and in a second the action of the court, dependingupon the caption of the application or the style of the order.Our conclusion is further confirmed by Federal Rule ofAppellate Procedure 27(c). It states:"In addition to the authority expressly conferred bythese rules or by law, a single judge of a court of appealsmay entertain and may grant or deny any request forrelief which under these rules may properly be soughtby motion, except that a single judge may not dismissor otherwise determine an appeal or other proceeding,and except that a court of appeals may provide by orderor rule that any motion or class of motions must be actedupon by the court. The action of a single judge may bereviewed by the court."As the Rule makes clear, even when individual judges areauthorized under the Rules to entertain certain requests forrelief, the court may review their decisions. The EighthCircuit's Rules are even more explicit, specifically listinggrants of certificates of probable cause by an individual judgeas one of the decisions subject to revision by the court underFederal Rule 27(c). Rule 27B(b)(2) (CA8 1998). The recog524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN245Cite as: 524 U. S. 236 (1998)Opinion of the Courtnition that decisions made by individual circuit judges re-main subject to correction by the entire court of appeals reinforces our determination that decisions with regard to anapplication for a certificate of appealability should be regarded as an action of the court itself and not of the individual judge. We must reject the suggestion contained in theAdvisory Committee's Notes on Federal Rule of AppellateProcedure 22(b) that "28 U. S. C. $ 2253 does not authorizethe court of appeals as a court to grant a certificate of probable cause." 28 U. S. C. App., p. 609. It is more consistentwith the Federal Rules and the uniform practice of thecourts of appeals to construe $ 2253(c)(1) as conferring thejurisdiction to issue certificates of appealability upon thecourt of appeals rather than by a judge acting under his orher own seal. See In re Burwell, 350 U. S. 521, 522 (1956).Some early cases from this Court acknowledged a distinction between acting in an administrative and a judicial capacity. When judges perform administrative functions, theirdecisions are not subject to our review. United States v.Ferreira, 13 How. 40, 51-52 (1852); see also Gordon v. UnitedStates, 117 U. S. Appx. 697, 702, 704 (1864). Those opinionswere careful to say it was the nonjudicial character of thejudges' actions which deprived this Court of jurisdiction.Ferreira, supra, at 46-47 (tribunal not judicial when the proceedings were ex parte and did not involve the issuance ofprocess, summoning of witnesses, or entry of a judgment);Gordon, supra, at 699, 702 (tribunal not judicial when it lackspower to enter and enforce judgments). Decisions regarding applications for certificates of appealability, in contrast,are judicial in nature. It is typical for both parties to enterappearances and to submit briefs at appropriate times andfor the court of appeals to enter a judgment and to issue amandate at the end of the proceedings, as happened here.App. 4-6. Construing the issuance of a certificate of appealability as an administrative function, moreover, would suggest an entity not wielding judicial power might review the524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN246 HOHN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtdecision of an Article III court. In light of the constitu-tional questions which would surround such an arrangement,see Gordon, supra; Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409 (1792), weshould avoid any such implication.We further disagree with the contention, advanced by thedissent and by Court-appointed amicus, that a request toproceed before a court of appeals should be regarded as athreshold inquiry separate from the merits which, if denied,prevents the case from ever being in the court of appeals.Precedent forecloses this argument. In Ex parte Quirin,317 U. S. 1 (1942), we confronted the analogous questionwhether a request for leave to file a petition for a writ ofhabeas corpus was a case in a district court for the purposesof the then-extant statute governing court of appeals reviewof district court decisions. See 28 U. S. C. $ 225(a) First(1940 ed.) (courts of appeals had jurisdiction to review finaldecisions "[i]n the district courts, in all cases save where adirect review of the decision may be had in the SupremeCourt"). We held the request for leave constituted a case inthe district court over which the court of appeals could assert jurisdiction, even though the district court had deniedthe request. We reasoned, "[p]resentation of the petitionfor judicial action is the institution of a suit. Hence the denial by the district court of leave to file the petitions in thesecauses was the judicial determination of a case or controversy, reviewable on appeal to the Court of Appeals." 317U. S., at 24.We reached a similar conclusion in Nixon v. Fitzgerald.There President Nixon sought to appeal an interlocutoryDistrict Court order rejecting his claim of absolute immunity. The Court of Appeals summarily dismissed the appealbecause, in its view, the order failed to present a "seriousand unsettled question" of law sufficient to bring the casewithin the collateral order doctrine announced in Cohen v.Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, 547 (1949).Because the Court of Appeals had dismissed for failure to524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN247Cite as: 524 U. S. 236 (1998)Opinion of the Courtsatisfy this threshold jurisdictional requirement, respondentFitzgerald argued, "the District Court's order was not anappealable `case' properly `in' the Court of Appeals withinthe meaning of $ 1254." 457 U. S., at 742. Turning asidethis argument, we ruled "petitioner did present a `seriousand unsettled' and therefore appealable question to theCourt of Appeals. It follow[ed] that the case was `in' theCourt of Appeals under $ 1254 and properly within ourcertiorari jurisdiction."Id., at 743. We elaborated: "Therecan be no serious doubt concerning our power to review acourt of appeals' decision to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. . . . If we lacked authority to do so, decisions to dismissfor want of jurisdiction would be insulated entirely fromreview by this Court." Id., at 743, n. 23; see also UnitedStates v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 692 (1974) (holding appeal ofDistrict Court's denial of motion to quash subpoena ducestecum was in the Court of Appeals for purposes of $ 1254(1)).We have shown no doubts about our jurisdiction to reviewdismissals by the Courts of Appeals for failure to file a timelynotice of appeal under $ 1254(1). The filing of a propernotice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional. Torres v.Oakland Scavenger Co., 487 U. S. 312, 315 (1988); UnitedStates v. Robinson, 361 U. S. 220, 224 (1960); Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule App. Proc. 3, 28 U. S. C. App.,p. 589. The failure to satisfy this jurisdictional prerequisitehas not kept the case from entering the Court of Appeals,however. We have reviewed these dismissals often andwithout insisting the petitioner satisfy the requirements foran extraordinary writ and without suggesting our lack ofjurisdiction to do so. E. g., Houston v. Lack, 487 U. S. 266(1988); Torres, supra; Fallen v. United States, 378 U. S. 139(1964); United States v. Robinson, supra; Leishman v. Associated Wholesale Elec. Co., 318 U. S. 203 (1943).We have also held that $ 1254(1) permits us to review denials of motions for leave to intervene in the Court of Appealsin proceedings to review the decision of an administra524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN248 HOHN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courttive agency. Automobile Workers v. Scofield, 382 U. S. 205,208-209 (1965); see alsoIzumi Seimitsu Kogyo KabushikiKaisha v. U. S. Philips Corp., 510 U. S. 27, 30 (1993) (percuriam). Together these decisions foreclose the propositionthat the failure to satisfy a threshold prerequisite for courtof appeals jurisdiction, such as the issuance of a certificateof appealability, prevents a case from being in the court ofappeals for purposes of $ 1254(1).It would have made no difference had the Government declined to oppose Hohn's application for a certificate of appeal-ability. InScofield, we held that $ 1254(1) gave us jurisdiction to review the Court of Appeals' denial of a motion forleave to intervene despite the fact that neither the agencynor any of the other parties opposed intervention. 382 U. S.,at 207. In the same manner, petitions for certiorari to thisCourt are often met with silence or even acquiescence; yetno one would suggest this deprives the petitions of the adversity needed to constitute a case. Assuming, of course,the underlying action satisfies the other requisites of a case,including injury in fact, the circumstance that the questionbefore the court is a preliminary issue, such as the denial ofa certificate of appealability or venue, does not oust appellatecourts of the jurisdiction to review a ruling on the matter.For instance, a case does not lack adversity simply becausethe remedy sought from a particular court is dismissal forimproper venue rather than resolution of the merits. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3) specifically permits aparty to move to dismiss for improper venue before joiningissue on any substantive point through the filing of a responsive pleading, and we have long treated appeals of dismissalsfor improper venue as cases in the courts of appeals, see,e. g., Radzanower v. Touche Ross & Co., 426 U. S. 148, 151(1976); Brunette Machine Works, Ltd. v. Kockum Industries,Inc., 406 U. S. 706, 707 (1972); Schnell v. Peter Eckrich &Sons, Inc., 365 U. S. 260, 261 (1961); Fourco Glass Co. v.Transmirra Products Corp., 353 U. S. 222, 223 (1957); Mis524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN249Cite as: 524 U. S. 236 (1998)Opinion of the Courtsissippi Publishing Corp. v. Murphree, 326 U. S. 438, 440(1946). It is true we have held appellate jurisdiction improper when district courts have denied, rather thangranted, motions to dismiss for improper venue. The jurisdictional problem in those cases, however, was the interlocutory nature of the appeal, not the absence of a proper case.Lauro Lines s.r.l. v. Chasser, 490 U. S. 495 (1989); VanCauwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U. S. 517 (1988). In any event,concerns about adversity are misplaced in this case. Herethe Government entered an appearance in response to theinitial application and filed a response opposing Hohn's petition for rehearing and suggestion for rehearing en banc.App. 4, 5.The argument that this Court lacks jurisdiction under$ 1254(1) to review threshold jurisdictional inquiries isfurther refuted by the recent amendment to 28 U. S. C.$ 2244(b)(3). The statute requires state prisoners filing second or successive habeas applications under $ 2254 to first"move in the appropriate court of appeals for an orderauthorizing the district court to consider the application."28 U. S. C. $ 2244(b)(3)(A) (1994 ed., Supp. II). The statutefurther provides "[t]he grant or denial of an authorizationby a court of appeals to file a second or successive application shall not be appealable and shall not be the subjectof a petition for rehearing or for a writ of certiorari."$ 2244(b)(3)(E). It would have been unnecessary to includea provision barring certiorari review if a motion to file asecond or successive application would not otherwise haveconstituted a case in the court of appeals for purposes of28 U. S. C. $ 1254(1). We are reluctant to adopt a construction making another statutory provision superfluous. See,e. g., Kawaauhau v. Geiger, 523 U. S. 57, 62 (1998); UnitedStates v. Menasche, 348 U. S. 528, 538-539 (1955).Inclusion of a specific provision barring certiorari reviewof denials of motions to file second or successive applicationsis instructive for another reason. The requirements for cer524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN250 HOHN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courttificates of appealability and motions for second or successiveapplications were enacted in the same statute. The clearlimit on this Court's jurisdiction to review denials of motionsto file second or successive petitions by writ of certioraricontrasts with the absence of an analogous limitation to certiorari review of denials of applications for certificates of ap-pealability. True, the phrase concerning the grant or denialof second or successive applications refers to an action "bya court of appeals"; still, we think a Congress concernedenough to bar our jurisdiction in one instance would havebeen just as explicit in denying it in the other, were that itsintention. See, e. g., Bates v. United States, 522 U. S. 23,29-30 (1997) (" `[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congressacts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion orexclusion' ") (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16,23 (1983) (other internal quotation marks omitted)). Thedissent claims the absence of similar language in $ 2253(c)can be explained by Congress' reliance on the rule holdingcertificate applications unreviewable under $ 1254(1). Post,at 261-262. As we later discuss, any such reliance is lessened by the Court's consistent practice of treating denialsof certificate applications as falling within its statutory certiorari jurisdiction. See infra, at 252.Today's holding conforms our commonsense practice to thestatutory scheme, making it unnecessary to invoke our extraordinary jurisdiction in routine cases, which present important and meritorious claims. The United States does notdispute that Hohn's claim has considerable merit and acknowledges that the trial court committed an error of constitutional magnitude. The only contested issue is whether theconstitutional violation was a substantial one. Brief in Opposition 7-8. Were we to adopt the position advanced bythe dissent, the only way we could consider his meritoriousclaim would be through the All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C.524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN251Cite as: 524 U. S. 236 (1998)Opinion of the Court$ 1651(a). Our rule permits us to carry out our normal func-tion of reviewing possible misapplications of law by thecourts of appeals without having to resort to extraordinaryremedies.Our decision, we must acknowledge, is in direct conflictwith the portion of our decision in House v. Mayo, 324 U. S.42, 44 (1945)(per curiam), holding that we lack statutorycertiorari jurisdiction to review refusals to issue certificatesof probable cause. Given the number and frequency of thecases, and the difficulty of reconciling our practice with arequirement that only an extraordinary writ can be used toaddress them, we do not think stare decisis concerns requireus to adhere to that decision. Its conclusion was erroneous,and it should not be followed.Stare decisis is "the preferred course because it promotesthe evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development oflegal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, andcontributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process." Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991)."Considerations of stare decisis have special force in the areaof statutory interpretation, for here, unlike in the context ofconstitutional interpretation, the legislative power is implicated, and Congress remains free to alter what we havedone." Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164,172-173 (1989).We have recognized, however, that stare decisis is a "principle of policy" rather than "an inexorable command."Payne, supra, at 828. For example, we have felt less constrained to follow precedent where, as here, the opinion wasrendered without full briefing or argument. Gray v. Mississippi, 481 U. S. 648, 651, n. 1 (1987) (questioning the precedential value of Davis v. Georgia, 429 U. S. 122 (1976) (percuriam)). The role of stare decisis, furthermore, is "somewhat reduced . . . in the case of a procedural rule . . . whichdoes not serve as a guide to lawful behavior." United Statesv. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 521 (1995) (citing Payne, supra, at524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN252 HOHN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court828). Here we have a rule of procedure that does not alterprimary conduct. And what is more, the rule of procedureannounced in House v. Mayo has often been disregarded inour own practice. Both Hohn and the United States citenumerous instances in which we have granted writs ofcertiorari to review denials of certificate applications with-out requiring the petitioner to move for leave to file for anextraordinary writ, as previously required by our rules, andwithout requiring any extraordinary showing or exhibitingany doubts about our jurisdiction to do so. 17 C. Wright, A.Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 4036,pp. 15-16 (2d ed. 1988) (collecting cases). Included amongthese examples are several noteworthy decisions which resolved significant issues of federal law. See, e. g., Allen v.Hardy, 478 U. S. 255, 257-258 (1986) (per curiam) (refusingto permit retroactive application of Batson v. Kentucky, 476U. S. 79 (1986), on collateral attack); Lynce v. Mathis, 519U. S. 433, 436 (1997) (holding the cancellation of early releasecredits violated the Ex Post Facto Clause). These deviations have led litigants and the legal community to question the vitality of the rule announced in House v. Mayo. Ascommentators have observed: "More recent cases . . . haveregularly granted certiorari following denial of leave toproceed in forma pauperis, or refusal to certify probablecause, without any indication that review was by commonlaw writ rather than statutory certiorari. At least as tothese two questions, statutory certiorari should be available." Wright, Miller, & Cooper, supra, at 15-16 (footnotesomitted). Our frequent disregard for the rule announced inHouse v. Mayo weakens the suggestion that Congress couldhave placed significant reliance on it, especially in light ofthe commentary on our practice in the legal literature.This is not to say opinions passing on jurisdictional issuessub silentio may be said to have overruled an opinion addressing the issue directly. See, e. g., United States v. More,3 Cranch 159, 172 (1805) (Marshall, C. J.). Our decisions re524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN253Cite as: 524 U. S. 236 (1998)Souter, J., concurringmain binding precedent until we see fit to reconsider them,regardless of whether subsequent cases have raised doubtsabout their continuing vitality. Rodriguez de Quijas v.Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 484 (1989).Once we have decided to reconsider a particular rule, however, we would be remiss if we did not consider the consistency with which it has been applied in practice. Swift & Co.v. Wickham, 382 U. S. 111, 116 (1965); see also Brown ShoeCo. v. United States, 370 U. S. 294, 307 (1962). This consideration, when combined with our analysis of the legal issuein question, convinces us the contrary holding of House v.Mayo cannot stand.We hold this Court has jurisdiction under $ 1254(1) to review denials of applications for certificates of appealabilityby a circuit judge or a panel of a court of appeals. The portion of House v. Mayo holding this Court lacks statutory certiorari jurisdiction over denials of certificates of probablecause is overruled. In light of the position asserted by theSolicitor General in the brief for the United States filed August 18, 1997, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further considerationconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.Justice Souter, concurring.I would be content to decide this case on the authority ofHouse v. Mayo, 324 U. S. 42 (1945) (per curiam), thatcommon-law certiorari is available to review the denial ofthe certificate, leaving House's precarious future for anotherday when its precedential value might have to be facedsquarely. But that course would command no more than aminority of one, and there is good reason to deny it even thatsupport. House's holding on what may be " `in' the court ofappeals," id., at 44, was virtually unreasoned, and the Courtcorrectly notes our subsequent practice of honoring this rulein the breach. Given the weakness of the precedent, the524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN254 HOHN v. UNITED STATESScalia, J., dissentingadvantage of having a clear majority for a rule governingour jurisdiction to reverse erroneous denials of certificatesof appealability persuades me to join the others in overrulingHouse insofar as it would bear on issuance of a statutorywrit of certiorari under 28 U. S. C. $ 1254(1).Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice O'Connor, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.Today's opinion permits review where Congress, with un-mistakable clarity, has denied it. To reach this result, theCourt ignores the obvious intent of the Antiterrorism andEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub. L. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, distorts the meaning of our own juris-dictional statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 1254(1), and overrules a 53-year-old precedent, House v. Mayo, 324 U. S. 42 (1945) (percuriam). I respectfully dissent.IThis Court's jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. $ 1254(1) is lim-ited to "[c]ases in the courts of appeals." Section 102 ofAEDPA provides that "[u]nless a circuit justice or judge is-sues a certificate of appealability, an appeal may not be takento the court of appeals from . . . the final order in a habeascorpus proceeding under section 2255," that is, a districtcourt habeas proceeding challenging federal custody. Peti-tioner, who is challenging federal custody under 28 U. S. C.$ 2255, did not obtain a certificate of appealability (COA).By the plain language of AEDPA, his appeal "from" the district court's "final order" "may not be taken to the courtof appeals." Because it could not be takento the Court ofAppeals, it quite obviously was never in the Court of Appeals; and because it was never in the Court of Appeals, welack jurisdiction under $ 1254(1) to entertain it.We have already squarely and explicitly endorsed thisstraightforward interpretation. InHouse v. Mayo, 324U. S., at 44, involving the predecessors to $$ 1254(1) and524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN255Cite as: 524 U. S. 236 (1998)Scalia, J., dissenting2253(c)(1), the statutorily required certificate was called a"certificate of probable cause" rather than a certificate of appealability, but the effect of failure to obtain it was preciselythe same: The case could not proceed to the court of appeals.On an attempt to obtain review of denial of the certificate inthis Court, we held that since petitioner's "case was never`in' the court of appeals, for want of a certificate," we lackedjurisdiction under $ 1254(1). Ibid.The Court concedes that House is squarely on point butopts to overrule it because its "conclusion was erroneous,"ante, at 251. The Court does not dispute that petitioner's$ 2255 action was never in the Court of Appeals; its overruling of House is instead based on the proposition that petitioner's request for a COA is, in and of itself, a "case" withinthe meaning of $ 1254(1), see ante, at 241-242, 246-249, andthat that case was "in" the Court of Appeals and hence canbe reviewed here, ante, at 241-246. Most of the Court'sanalysis is expended in the effort to establish that petitionermade his request for a COA to the Court of Appeals as such,rather than to the circuit judges in their individual capacity,ibid. Even that effort is unsuccessful, since it comes upagainst the pellucid language of AEDPA to the contrary.Section 102 does not permit application for a COA to a courtof appeals; it states that the application must be made to a"circuit justice or judge." That this means precisely what itsays is underscored by $ 103 of AEDPA, which amends Rule22 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure: "If [a COA]request is addressed to the court of appeals, it shall bedeemed addressed to the judges thereof and shall be considered by a circuit judge or judges as the court deems appropriate." As though drafted in anticipatory refutation of theCourt's countertextual holding today, the Advisory Committee's Notes on Rule 22 explicitly state that "28 U. S. C. $ 2253does not authorize the court of appeals as a court to grant acertificate of probable cause." 28 U. S. C. App., p. 609.524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN256 HOHN v. UNITED STATESScalia, J., dissentingProclaiming the request for a COA to be "in" the Court ofAppeals is the most obvious of the Court's statutory distortions, but not the one with the most serious collateral conse-quences. The latter award goes to the Court's virtually unanalyzed pronouncement (also essential to its holding) thatthe request for a COA was itself a "case" within the meaningof $ 1254(1). The notion that a request pertaining to a caseconstitutes its own "case" for purposes of $ 1254 is a jaw-dropper. To support that remarkable assertion, the Courtrelies upon circumstantial evidence--that the "applicationmoved through the Eighth Circuit in the same manner ascases in general do." Ante, at 242. Does this mean that arequest for a COA would not be a "case" in those Circuitsthat treated it differently--that permitted it to be disposedof by a single judge as Rule 22 specifically allows? Does itmean that a motion for recusal, or a request for televisedcoverage, or a motion to file under seal would be a "case" ifthe court of appeals chose to treat it in the manner theEighth Circuit treated the request for a COA here? Surelynot.An application for a COA, standing alone, does not havethe requisite qualities of a legal "case" under any knowndefinition. It does not assert a grievance against anyone,does not seek remedy or redress for any legal injury, anddoes not even require a "party" on the other side. It isnothing more than a request for permission to seek review.Petitioner's grievance is with respondent for unlawful custody, and the remedy he seeks is release from that custodypursuant to $ 2255. The request for a COA is not some separate "case" that can subsist apart from that underlying suit;it is merely a procedural requirement that must be fulfilledbefore petitioner's $ 2255 action--his "case" or "cause"--canadvance to the appellate court. The adversity which theCourt acknowledges is needed for a "case" under $ 1254, seeante, at 241, is not satisfied by the dispute between petitionerand respondent as to whether the COA should be granted--524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN257Cite as: 524 U. S. 236 (1998)Scalia, J., dissentingany more than a "case or controversy" for purposes of initialfederal-court jurisdiction is created by a dispute over venue,between parties who agree on everything else.1As is true with most erroneous theories, a logical and consistent application of the Court's reasoning yields strangeresults. If dispute over the propriety of granting a COAcreates a "case," the denial of a COA request that has beenunopposed (or, better yet, has been supported by the Government) will be unreviewable, whereas denial of a request thatis vigorously opposed will be reviewed--surely an upsidedown result. And the "case" concerning the COA will sub-sist even when the $ 2255 suit has been mooted by the petitioner's release from prison. These bizarre consequencesfollow inevitably from the Court's "separate case" theory,which has been fabricated in order to achieve a result thatis fundamentally at odds with the purpose of the statute.For the Court insists upon assuming, contrary to the plainimport of the statute, that Congress wanted petitioner's$ 2255 action to proceed "in the ordinary course of the judi-cial process" and to follow the "general rule" that permits anappeal from a final district court order, ibid. If this wereCongress's wish, there would have been no need for $ 102 ofAEDPA. The whole point of that provision is to divergefrom the ordinary course of the judicial process and to keeppetitioner's case against respondent out of the Court of Ap-peals unless petitioner obtains a COA. "The certificate is ascreening device, helping to conserve judicial (and prosecuto-rial) resources." Young v. United States, 124 F. 3d 794, 7991 The Court has no response to this. Its observation that a dispute overvenue is not unreviewable simply because it is preliminary, ante, at 248-249, is accurate but irrelevant. The issue is not whether a venue disputemay be reviewed at all, but whether it may be reviewed in isolation fromsome case of which it is a part. It may not, because a venue dispute,standing alone--like a request for a COA, standing alone--lacks the requisite qualities of a case. If the entire $ 2255 proceeding was not "in" theCourt of Appeals, the COA request alone was not a "case" that $ 1254authorizes us to review.524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN258 HOHN v. UNITED STATESScalia, J., dissenting(CA7 1997). It is this unique screening function that distin-guishes a COA from the jurisdictional issues discussed bythe Court: Section 102 of AEDPA prevents petitioner's casefrom entering the Court of Appealsat all in the absence of aCOA, whereas other jurisdictional determinations are madeafter a case is in the Court of Appeals (even if the case islater dismissed because of jurisdictional defects),ante, at 246-249. See Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U. S. 397, 403, n. 3 (1970)(a court always has jurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction).The Court's only response to these arguments is that theyare foreclosed by our precedent, since we decided an analogous issue in Ex parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1 (1942). Ante, at246. (The Court displays no appreciation of the deliciousirony involved in its insistence upon hewing to an allegedlyanalogous decision while overruling the case directly inpoint, House.) Quirin held that a petition for habeas corpusconstituted the institution of a suit, and that it was not necessary for the writ to issue for the matter to be considered acase or controversy. 317 U. S., at 24. Quirin relied uponour decision in Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, 110-113 (1866),which reasoned that a petition for habeas corpus is a suitbecause the petitioner seeks " `that remedy which the lawaffords him' " to recover his liberty. Id., at 113 (quotingWeston v. City Council of Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, 464 (1829)).Petitioner's request for $ 2255 relief is analogous to a petitionfor habeas corpus, but his request for a COA is of a whollydifferent nature. That is no "remedy" for any harm, but athreshold procedural requirement that petitioner must meetin order to carry his $ 2255 suit to the appellate stage. Thatis why the Court in House, decided less than three yearsafter Quirin, did not treat the application for a certificate asa separate case but did recognize the petition for habeas corpus as a case even though it was decided without a hearingor a call for a return. 324 U. S., at 43.I have described above why House was entirely correct,but a few words are in order concerning the inappropriate524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN259Cite as: 524 U. S. 236 (1998)Scalia, J., dissentingness of overruling House, regardless of its virtue as an origi-nal matter. "[T]he burden borne by the party advocatingabandonment of an established precedent is greater wherethe Court is asked to overrule a point of statutory construction." Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164,172-173 (1989); see also Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431U. S. 720, 736 (1977);Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285U. S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). The Courtacknowledges this principle, but invokes cases of ours thatsay that stare decisis concerns are " `somewhat reduced' " inthe case of a procedural rule.Ante, at 251. The basis forthat principle, of course, is that procedural rules do not ordinarily engender detrimental reliance--and in this case, as Ishall discuss, detrimental reliance by the Congress of theUnited States is self-evident. In any event, even thosecases cited by the Court as applying the "somewhat reduced"standard to procedural holdings still felt the need to set forthspecial factors justifying the overruling. United States v.Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 521 (1995), concluded that "the decision in question had been proved manifestly erroneous, andits underpinnings eroded, by subsequent decisions of thisCourt"; and Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828-830(1991), noted that the overruled cases had been "decided bythe narrowest of margins, over spirited dissents challenging [their] basic underpinnings," had been "questioned byMembers of the Court in later decisions," and had "defiedconsistent application by the lower courts."The Court's next excuse is that House was decided withoutfull briefing or argument. The sole precedent it cites for theproposition that this makes a difference is Gray v. Mississippi, 481 U. S. 648, 651, n. 1 (1987). Gray, however, did notdeny stare decisis effect to an opinion rendered without fullbriefing and argument--it accorded stare decisis effect. Id.,at 666-667. What the Court relies upon is the mere dictum,rendered in the course of this opinion (and dictum in a footnote, at that), that "summary action here does not have the524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN260 HOHN v. UNITED STATESScalia, J., dissentingsame precedential effect as does a case decided upon fullbriefing and argument."Id., at 651, n. 1. But the sole authority cited for that dictum was Edelman v. Jordan, 415U. S. 651 (1974), which declined to givestare decisis effect,not to opinions that had been issued without briefing andargument, but to judgments that had been issued withoutopinion--"summary affirmances" that did not "contain anysubstantive discussion" of the point at issue or any otherpoint, id., at 670-671. Such judgments, affirming withoutcomment the disposition appealed from, were common in thedays when this Court had an extensive mandatory jurisdiction; they carried little more weight than denials of certiorari. House, by contrast, was a six-page opinion with substantive discussion on the point at issue here. It reasoned:(1) "Our authority . . . extends only to cases `in a circuit courtof appeals . . . .' " (2) "Here the case was never `in' the courtof appeals," because of (3) "want of a certificate of probablecause." 324 U. S., at 44.2 And it cited as authority Ferguson v. District of Columbia, 270 U. S. 633 (1926). The newrule that the Court today announces--that our opinions rendered without full briefing and argument (hitherto thoughtto be the strongest indication of certainty in the outcome)have a diminished stare decisis effect--may well turn out tobe the principal point for which the present opinion will beremembered. It can be expected to affect the treatment ofmany significant per curiam opinions by the lower courts,and the willingness of Justices to undertake summary disposition in the future.2 The concurrence asserts that this analysis was "virtually unreasoned."Ante, at 253 (opinion of Souter, J.). It seems to me, to the contrary, thatthere was virtually nothing more to be said. Not until today has anyonethought that a "case" could consist of a disembodied request to appeal.The concurrence joins the Court in relying upon a truly eccentric argument, and then blames the House Court for not discussing this eccentricityat length.524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN261Cite as: 524 U. S. 236 (1998)Scalia, J., dissentingOf course even if one accepts that the two factors theCourt alludes to (procedural ruling plus absence of fullbriefing or argument) reduce House's stare decisis effect, onemust still acknowledge that its stare decisis effect is increased by the fact that it was a statutory holding. TheCourt does not contend that stare decisis is utterly inapplicable, and so it must come up with some reason for ignoringit. Its reason is that we have "disregarded" House in practice. Ante, at 252. The opinions it cites for this proposition, however, not only fail to mention House; they fail tomention the jurisdictional issue to which House pertains.And "we have repeatedly held that the existence of unaddressed jurisdictional defects has no precedential effect."Lewis v. Casey, 518 U. S. 343, 352, n. 2 (1996) (emphasisadded). Surely it constitutes "precedential effect" to reducethe stare decisis effect of one of the Court's holdings. It issignificant, moreover, that when Members of the Court havediscussed House or the jurisdictional effect of a COA denial,they have agreed that jurisdiction is not available under$ 1254. See Davis v. Jacobs, 454 U. S. 911, 912 (1981) (Stevens, J., respecting denial of certiorari); id., at 916-917(Rehnquist, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Powell, J., dissenting); Jeffries v. Barksdale, 453 U. S. 914, 915-916 (1981)(Rehnquist, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Powell, J., dissenting). The Court's new approach to unaddressed jurisdictional defects is perhaps the second point for which thepresent opinion will be remembered.While there is scant reason for denying stare decisis effectto House, there is special reason for according it: the relianceof Congress upon an unrepudiated decision central to theprocedural scheme it was creating. Section 102 of AEDPAcontinues a long tradition of provisions enacted by Congressthat limit appellate review of petitions. In 1908, Congressrequired a certificate of probable cause in habeas corpuscases involving state prisoners before an appeal would lie to524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN262 HOHN v. UNITED STATESScalia, J., dissentingthis Court, see Act of Mar. 10, 1908, ch. 76, 35 Stat. 40. In1925, this requirement was extended to intermediate appellate proceedings, see Act of Feb. 13, 1925, ch. 229, $$ 6(d), 13,43 Stat. 940, 942. Before 1925, this Court readily concludedit had no jurisdiction over appeals brought before it in theabsence of a certificate, see, e. g., Bilik v. Strassheim, 212U. S. 551 (1908);Ex parte Patrick, 212 U. S. 555 (1908), andHouse interpreted the 1925 amendment to produce the sameeffect in the courts of appeals and, consequently, in thisCourt under the predecessor to $ 1254(1). Quite obviously,withHouse on the books--neither overruled nor even citedin the later opinions that the Court claims "disregarded" it--Congress presumably anticipated that $ 102 of AEDPAwould be interpreted in the same manner.3 In yet anotherstriking departure from our ordinary practice, the Courtqualifies the rule that statutes are deemed to adopt the ex-tant holdings of this Court, seeKeene Corp. v. United States,508 U. S. 200, 212 (1993): They will not be deemed to adoptthem, the Court says, when legal commentators "question3 The Court points to the fact that another provision of AEDPA, whichrequires court of appeals authorization before a state prisoner can file asecond or successive habeas petition in district court, specifically statesthat the denial of the authorization "shall not be appealable and shall notbe the subject of a petition . . . for a writ of certiorari." 28 U. S. C.$ 2244(b)(3)(E) (1994 ed., Supp. II). This provision, the Court says, wouldbe rendered "superfluous" if we followed House, ante, at 249. That isnot so. Section 2244(b)(3) addresses whether there will be district-courtconsideration of a second or successive petition at all, not whether thedistrict court's consideration may be reviewed by an appellate court.Only the latter is covered by the holding of House. It is true enough thatthe reasoning of House, if carried over to the other question, wouldproduce the same result; but Congress's specification of that result whenthere is no Supreme Court holding precisely in point would more accurately be described as cautious than superfluous. Indeed, the greaterrelevance of $ 2244(b)(3) to the question before us is this: It would be exceedingly strange to foreclose certiorari review of the denial of all federalintervention, as that provision does, while according certiorari review ofthe denial of appeal from the federal district court to the court of appeals.524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN263Cite as: 524 U. S. 236 (1998)Scalia, J., dissentingthe vitality" of the holdings. Ante, at 252. The confusionthat will be introduced by this new approach is obvious.At bottom, the only justification for the Court's holding--and the only one that prompts the concurrence to overruleHouse--is convenience: it "permits us to carry out our nor-mal function" of appellate review.Ante, at 251. Our "nor-mal" function of appellate review, however, is no more andno less than what Congress says it is. U. S. Const., Art. III,$ 2. The Court's defiance of the scheme created by Congressin evident reliance on our precedent is a display not of "com-mon sense," ante, at 250, but of judicial willfulness. And adoctrine of stare decisis that is suspended when five Justicesfind it inconvenient (or indeed, as the concurrence suggests,even four Justices in search of a fifth) is no doctrine at all,but simply an excuse for adhering to cases we like and abandoning those we do not. IISince I find no jurisdiction under $ 1254(1), I must addressthe Government's further argument that we can issue acommon-law writ of certiorari under the All Writs Act, 28U. S. C. $ 1651. The All Writs Act provides that "[t]heSupreme Court . . . may issue all writs necessary or appro-priate in aid of [its] jurisdictio[n] and agreeable to the usagesand principles of law." As expressly noted in this Court'sRule 20.1, issuance of a writ under $ 1651 "is not a matter ofright, but of discretion sparingly exercised," and "[t]o justifythe granting of any such writ, the petition must show thatthe writ will be in aid of the Court's appellate jurisdiction,that exceptional circumstances warrant the exercise of theCourt's discretionary powers, and that adequate relief cannotbe obtained in any other form or from any other court."Petitioner (who filed a petition for a writ of certiorariunder $ 1254(1), not under the All Writs Act, Pet. for Cert.1) has failed to establish that he meets these requirements.To begin with, he has not shown that adequate relief is unobtainable in any form or from any other court. AEDPA dif524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN264 HOHN v. UNITED STATESScalia, J., dissentingfers from the gatekeeping statute at issue in House in a cru-cial respect: when House was decided, claimants could seekcertificates of probable cause only from "the United Statescourt by which the final decision was rendered or a judge ofthe circuit court of appeals," 28 U. S. C. $ 466 (1940 ed.),whereas $ 102 of AEDPA permits claimants to seek COA'sfrom a "circuitjustice or judge." Because petitioner mayobtain the relief he seeks from a circuit justice, relief underthe All Writs Act is not "necessary."Relief under the Act is also not "appropriate." The onlycircumstance alleged by petitioner to justify relief is that theEighth Circuit erroneously concluded that he failed to pre-sent a substantial constitutional question. There is nothing"exceptional" about this claim; it is in fact the same claimavailable to every petitioner when a COA is denied, and en-tertaining it would render application for this "extraordinary" writ utterly routine. Issuance of the writ is not "ap-propriate" for another reason as well: It would frustrate thepurpose of AEDPA, which is to prevent review unless a COAis granted. "Where a statute specifically addresses the particular issue at hand, it is that authority, and not the AllWrits Act, that is controlling. Although that Act empowersfederal courts to fashion extraordinary remedies when theneed arises, it does not authorize them to issue ad hoc writswhenever compliance with statutory procedures appears inconvenient or less appropriate." Pennsylvania Bureau ofCorrection v. United States Marshals Service, 474 U. S. 34,43 (1985).4 * * *The purpose of AEDPA is not obscure. It was to eliminate the interminable delays in the execution of state andfederal criminal sentences, and the shameful overloading of4 Because petitioner has not demonstrated that issuance of the writ is"necessary" or "appropriate" under $ 1651, I need not discuss whether itfails the further requirement that it be "in aid of" our jurisdiction.524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN265Cite as: 524 U. S. 236 (1998)Scalia, J., dissentingour federal criminal justice system, produced by various as-pects of this Court's habeas corpus jurisprudence.

APFEL, COMMISSIONER OFSOCIAL SECURITYcertiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuitNo. 97-5737. Argued April 22, 1998--Decided June 15, 1998Petitioner Forney sought judicial review of a Social Security Administration final determination denying her disability benefits. When the District Court found that determination inadequately supported by the evidence and remanded the case to the agency for further proceedingspursuant to sentence four of 42 U. S. C. $ 405(g), Forney appealed, contending that the agency's denial of benefits should be reversed outright.The Ninth Circuit, however, decided that she did not have the legalright to appeal. Before this Court, both Forney and the Solicitor General agree that she had the right to appeal, so an amicus has beenappointed to defend the Ninth Circuit's decision.Held: A Social Security disability claimant seeking court reversal of anagency decision denying benefits may appeal a district court order remanding the case to the agency for further proceedings pursuant tosentence four of 42 U. S. C. $ 405(g). This Court has previously heldthat the language of the Social Security Act's "judicial review" provision--"district courts" (reviewing, for example, agency denials of disability claims) "have the power to enter . . . a judgment affirming, modifying or reversing [an agency] decision . . . with or without remandingthe cause for a rehearing," and such "judgment . . . shall be final exceptthat it shall be subject to review in the same manner as" other civilaction judgments, 42 U. S. C. $ 405(g) (emphases added)--means that adistrict court order remanding a Social Security disability claim to theagency for further proceedings is a "final judgment" appealable under28 U. S. C. $ 1291. Sullivan v. Finkelstein, 496 U. S. 617. Finkelsteindiffers from this case in that it involved an appeal by the Government.However, Finkelstein's logic makes that feature irrelevant here. Thatcase reasoned, primarily from $ 405(g)'s language, that a district courtjudgment remanding a Social Security disability case fell within the"class of orders" that are appealable under $ 1291. Neither the statutenor Finkelstein suggests that such an order could be final for purposesof an appeal by the Government, but not a claimant, or permits an inference that finality turns on the order's importance, or the availabilityof an avenue for appeal from the agency determination that mightemerge after remand. The Ninth Circuit erred in concluding that For524us1$86Z 02-17-99 18:23:51 PAGES OPINPGT267Cite as: 524 U. S. 266 (1998)Opinion of the Courtney could not appeal because she was the prevailing party. A party is"aggrieved" and ordinarily can appeal a decision granting in part anddenying in part the remedy requested, United States v. Jose, 519 U. S.54, 56; Forney, who sought reversal of the administrative decision denying benefits and, in the alternative, a remand, received some, but notall, of the relief requested. The Solicitor General disputes the NinthCircuit's assertion that a rule permitting appeals in these circumstanceswould impose additional, and unnecessary, burdens upon federal appealscourts. If the Solicitor General proves wrong in his prediction, theremedy must be legislative, for the statutes at issue do not give thecourts the power to redefine or subdivide the classes of cases whereappeals will (or will not) lie.

With her on the briefs were Solicitor General Waxman, Assistant Attorney General Hunger,Deputy Solicitor General Kneedler, and William Kanter.Allen R. Snyder, by invitation of the Court, 522 U.

We conclude that the law authorizes such an appeal.ISandra K. Forney, the petitioner, applied for Social Secu-rity disability benefits under $ 223 of the Social Security Act,as added, 70 Stat. 815, and as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 423. ASocial Security Administration Administrative Law Judge(ALJ) determined (1) that Forney had not worked since the524us1$86Q 02-17-99 18:23:51 PAGES OPINPGT268 FORNEY v. APFELOpinion of the Courtonset of her medical problem, and (2) that she was more thanminimally disabled, but (3) that she was not disabled enoughto qualify for benefits automatically. Moreover, her disabil-ity, (4) while sufficiently serious to prevent her return to herformer work (cook, kitchen manager, or baker), (5) was notserious enough to prevent her from holding other jobs avail-able in the economy (such as order clerk or telephone answering service operator). App. 12-28. The ALJ conse-quently denied her disability claim,id., at 28, and theAdministration's Appeals Council denied Forney's requestfor review, App. to Pet. for Cert. 39-40; see generallyBowenv. Yuckert, 482 U. S. 137, 140-142 (1987) (setting forth fivepart "disability" test); 20 CFR $ 404.1520 (1997) (same).Forney then sought judicial review in Federal DistrictCourt. The court found the agency's final determination--that Forney could hold other jobs--inadequately supportedbecause those jobs "require frequent or constant reaching,"but the record showed that Forney's "ability to reach isimpaired." Forney v. Secretary, Civ. No. 94-6357 (D. Ore.,May 1, 1995); App. 127-128. The District Court then entered a judgment, which remanded the case to the agency forfurther proceedings (pursuant to sentence four of 42 U. S. C.$ 405(g)). Id., at 128.Forney sought to appeal the remand order. She contended that, because the agency had already had sufficientopportunity to prove the existence of other relevant employment (and for other reasons), its denial of benefits shouldbe reversed outright. The Court of Appeals for the NinthCircuit did not hear her claim, however, for it decidedthat Forney did not have the legal right to appeal. Forneyv. Chater, 108 F. 3d 228, 234 (1997).Forney sought certiorari. Both she and the Solicitor General agreed that Forney had the legal right to appeal fromthe District Court's judgment. The Solicitor General suggested that we reverse the Ninth Circuit and remand thecase so that it could hear Forney's appeal. We granted cer524us1$86Q 02-17-99 18:23:51 PAGES OPINPGT269Cite as: 524 U. S. 266 (1998)Opinion of the Courttiorari to consider the merits of this position, and we ap-pointed an amicus to defend the Ninth Circuit's decision.We now agree with Forney and the Solicitor General thatthe Court of Appeals should have heard Forney's appeal.IISection 1291 of Title 28 of the United States Code grantsthe "courts of appeals . . . jurisdiction of appeals from allfinal decisions of the district courts." (Emphasis added.)Forney's appeal falls within the scope of this jurisdictionalgrant. That is because the District Court entered its judg-ment under the authority of the special "judicial review" provision of the Social Security Act, which says, in its fourthsentence, that "district court[s]" (reviewing, for example,agency denials of Social Security disability claims)"shall have power to enter . . . a judgment affirming,modifying, or reversing the decision of the [agency] withor without remanding the cause for a rehearing," 42U. S. C. $ 405(g) (emphasis added),and which adds, in its eighth sentence, that the"judgment of the court shall be final except that it shallbe subject to review in the same manner as a judgmentin other civil actions," ibid. (emphases added).This Court has previously held that this statutory languagemeans what it says, namely, that a district court order remanding a Social Security disability benefit claim to theagency for further proceedings is a "final judgment" forpurposes of $ 1291 and it is, therefore, appealable. Sullivanv. Finkelstein, 496 U. S. 617 (1990); see also Shalala v.Schaefer, 509 U. S. 292, 294 (1993) (statute that requiresattorney's fees application to be filed within "thirty days offinal judgment" requires filing within 30 days of entry of$ 405(g) "sentence four" district court remand order, notwithin 30 days of final agency decision after remand).524us1$86Q 02-17-99 18:23:51 PAGES OPINPGT270 FORNEY v. APFELOpinion of the CourtFinkelstein is not identical to the case before us. It involved an appeal by the Government; this case involves anappeal by a disability benefits claimant. Moreover, the needfor immediate appeal in Finkelstein was arguably greaterthan that here. The District Court there had invalidated aset of Health and Human Services regulations, and the Government might have found it difficult to obtain appellate review of this matter of general importance. Further, theCourt, in Finkelstein, said specifically that it would "expressno opinion about appealability" where a party seeks to "appeal on the ground that" the district court should havegranted broader relief. 496 U. S., at 623, n. 3.Finkelstein's logic, however, makes these features of thatcase irrelevant here. Finkelstein focused upon a "class oforders" that Congress had made "appealable under $ 1291."Id., at 628. It reasoned, primarily from the language of$ 405(g), that a district court judgment remanding a SocialSecurity disability benefit case fell within that class. Nothing in the language, either of the statute or the Court's opinion, suggests that such an order could be "final" for purposesof appeal only when the Government seeks to appeal but notwhen the claimant seeks to do so. Nor does the opinion'sreasoning permit an inference that "finality" turns on theorder's importance or the availability (or lack of availability)of an avenue for appeal from the different, later, agency determination that might emerge after remand.The Ninth Circuit itself recognized that the DistrictCourt's judgment was "final" for purposes of appeal, for itsaid that any effort "to conclude" that a judgment remandingthe case is "not final for the claimant" was "inconsistent"with Finkelstein. 108 F. 3d, at 232. The court added thatit would be "error for the district court to attempt to retainjurisdiction" after remanding the case; and it wrote that theremand judgment, which ended the "civil action," must be" `final' in a formalistic sense . . . for all parties to it." Ibid.524us1$86Q 02-17-99 18:23:51 PAGES OPINPGT271Cite as: 524 U. S. 266 (1998)Opinion of the CourtThe Court of Appeals nonetheless reached a "no appeal"conclusion--but on a different ground. It pointed out thata "party normally may not appeal [a] decision in its favor."Ibid. (citing Electrical Fittings Corp. v. Thomas & Betts Co.,307 U. S. 241, 242 (1939)). And it said that Forney had obtained a decision in her favor here. Because Forney "may,on remand, secure all of the relief she seeks," the courtwrote, she is a "prevailing" party and therefore cannot ap-peal. 108 F. 3d, at 232-233.We do not agree. We concede that this Court has heldthat a "party who receives all that he has sought generallyis not aggrieved by the judgment affording the relief andcannot appeal from it."Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank v.Roper, 445 U. S. 326, 333 (1980). But this Court also hasclearly stated that a party is "aggrieved" and ordinarily canappeal a decision "granting in part and denying in part theremedy requested." United States v. Jose, 519 U. S. 54, 56(1996)(per curiam). And this latter statement determinesthe outcome of this case.Forney's complaint sought as relief:"1. That this court reverse and set aside the decision . . .denying [the] claim for disability benefits;"2. In the alternative, that this court remand the caseback to the Secretary for proper evaluation of the evidence or a hearing de novo." App. 37.The context makes clear that, from Forney's perspective, thesecond "alternative," which means further delay and risk,is only half a loaf. Thus, the District Court's order givespetitioner some, but not all, of the relief she requested; andshe consequently can appeal the District Court's order insofar as it denies her the relief she has sought. Indeed, tohold to the contrary would deny a disability claimant theright to seek reversal (instead of remand) through a crossappeal in cases where the Government itself appeals a re524us1$86Q 02-17-99 18:23:51 PAGES OPINPGT272 FORNEY v. APFELOpinion of the Courtmand order, as the Government has every right to do. SeeFinkelstein, supra, at 619.The Solicitor General points to many cases that find a rightto appeal in roughly comparable circumstances. See Brieffor Respondent 21, n. 12 (citing Gargoyles, Inc. v. UnitedStates, 113 F. 3d 1572 (CA Fed. 1997) (permitting appealwhere prevailing party recovered reasonable royalty but wasdenied lost profits); Castle v. Rubin, 78 F. 3d 654 (CADC1996)(per curiam) (permitting appeal where prevailingparty awarded partial backpay but denied reinstatement andfront pay);La Plante v. American Honda Motor Co., 27 F.3d 731 (CA1 1994) (permitting appeal where prevailing partyawarded compensatory but not punitive damages); Grazianov. Harrison, 950 F. 2d 107 (CA3 1991) (permitting appealwhere prevailing party awarded damages but denied attorney's fees); Ragen Corp. v. Kearney & Trecker Corp., 912F. 2d 619 (CA3 1990) (permitting appeal where prevailingparty denied consequential damages); Carrigan v. ExxonCo., U. S. A., 877 F. 2d 1237 (CA5 1989) (permitting appealwhere prevailing party awarded damages but not injunctive relief)).The contrary authority that amicus, through diligent efforts, has found arose in less closely analogous circumstancesand consequently does not persuade us.

S. 266 (1998)Opinion of the CourtOccupational Safety and Health Review Comm'rs, 643 F. 2d230, 233 (CA5 1981) (same).Finally, we recognize that the Ninth Circuit expressedconcern that a rule of law permitting appeals in these circumstances would impose additional, and unnecessary, bur-dens upon federal appeals courts. The Solicitor General,while noting that the federal courts reviewed nearly 10,000Social Security Administration decisions in 1996, says thatthe "[p]ractical [c]onsequences" of permitting appeals "[a]relimited." Brief for Respondent 26; Reply Brief for Respondent 17, n. 13. Except for unusual cases, he believes, aclaimant obtaining a remand will prefer to return to theagency rather than to appeal immediately seeking outrightagency reversal--because appeal means further delay, because the chance of obtaining reversal should be small, andbecause the appeal (if it provokes a Government crossappeal) risks losing all. Brief for Respondent 26-29.Regardless, as we noted in Finkelstein, congressional statutes governing appealability normally proceed by defining"classes" of cases where appeals will (or will not) lie. 496U. S., at 628. The statutes at issue here do not give courtsthe power to redefine, or to subdivide, those classes, according to whether or not they believe, in a particular case, fur-ther agency proceedings might obviate the need for an immediate appeal. Thus, if the Solicitor General proves wrong inhis prediction, the remedy must be legislative in nature.For these reasons, the judgment of the Ninth Circuit isreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.524US2 Unit: $U87 [09-15-00 14:31:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN274 OCTOBER TERM, 1997SyllabusGEBSER et al. v. LAGO VISTA INDEPENDENTSCHOOL DISTRICTcertiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuitNo. 96-1866. Argued March 25, 1998--Decided June 22, 1998Petitioner Gebser, a high school student in respondent Lago Vista Independent School District, had a sexual relationship with one of her teachers. She did not report the relationship to school officials. After thecouple was discovered having sex and the teacher was arrested, LagoVista terminated his employment. During this time, the district hadnot distributed an official grievance procedure for lodging sexual harassment complaints or a formal antiharassment policy, as required by federal regulations. Gebser and her mother, also a petitioner here, filedsuit raising, among other things, a claim for damages against Lago Vistaunder Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which providesin pertinent part that a person cannot "be subjected to discriminationunder any education program or activity receiving Federal financialassistance," 20 U. S. C. $ 1681(a). The Federal District Court grantedLago Vista summary judgment. In affirming, the Fifth Circuit heldthat school districts are not liable under Title IX for teacher-studentsexual harassment unless an employee with supervisory power over theoffending employee actually knew of the abuse, had the power to endit, and failed to do so, and ruled that petitioners could not satisfy thatstandard.Held: Damages may not be recovered for teacher-student sexual harassment in an implied private action under Title IX unless a school districtofficial who at a minimum has authority to institute corrective measureson the district's behalf has actual notice of, and is deliberately indifferent to, the teacher's misconduct. Pp. 280-293.(a) The express statutory means of enforcing Title IX is administrative, as the statute directs federal agencies who distribute educationfunding to establish requirements in furtherance of the nondiscrimination mandate and allows agencies to enforce those requirements, including ultimately by suspending or terminating federal funding. TheCourt held in Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, thatTitle IX is also enforceable through an implied private right of action.In Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U. S. 60, the Courtestablished that monetary damages are available in such an action,but made no effort to delimit the circumstances in which that remedy524US2 Unit: $U87 [09-15-00 14:31:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN275Cite as: 524 U. S. 274 (1998)Syllabusshould lie. Petitioners, relying on standards developed in the contextof Title VII, contend that damages are available in an implied actionunder Title IX based on principles of respondeat superior and constructive notice, i. e., without actual notice to officials of discrimination inschool programs. Whether an educational institution can be said to violate Title IX based on principles of respondeat superior and constructive notice has not been resolved by the Court's decisions. In this case,moreover, petitioners seek damages based on theories of respondeatsuperior and constructive notice. Unlike Title IX, Title VII containsan express cause of action for a damages remedy. Title IX's privateaction is judicially implied, however, and so contains no legislative expression of the scope of available remedies. Pp. 280-284.(b) Because the private right of action is judicially implied, this Courtmust infer how Congress would have addressed the issue of monetarydamages had the action been expressly included in Title IX. It doesnot appear that Congress contemplated unlimited damages against afunding recipient that is unaware of discrimination in its programs.When Title IX was enacted, the principal civil rights statutes containingan express right of action did not allow monetary damages, and whenTitle VII was amended to allow such damages, Congress limited theamount recoverable in any individual case. Title IX was modeled afterTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits race discrimination in programs receiving federal funds. Both statutes conditionfederal funding on a recipient's promise not to discriminate, in whatamounts essentially to a contract between the Government and therecipient. In contrast, Title VII is framed as an outright prohibition.Title IX's contractual nature has implications for the construction ofthe scope of available remedies. When Congress conditions the awardof federal funds under its spending power, the Court closely examinesthe propriety of private actions holding recipients liable in damagesfor violating the condition. It is sensible to assume that Congress didnot envision a recipient's liability in damages where the recipient wasunaware of the discrimination.Title IX contains important clues that this was Congress' intent.Title IX's express means of enforcement requires actual notice to officials of the funding recipient and an opportunity for voluntary compliance before administrative enforcement proceedings can commence.The presumable purpose is to avoid diverting education funding frombeneficial uses where a recipient who is unaware of discrimination inits programs is willing to institute prompt corrective measures. Allowing recovery of damages based on principles of respondeat superioror constructive notice in cases of teacher-student sexual harassmentwould be at odds with that basic objective, as liability would attach524US2 Unit: $U87 [09-15-00 14:31:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN276 GEBSER v. LAGO VISTA INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DIST.Syllabuseven though the district had no actual knowledge of the teacher's conduct and no opportunity to take action to end the harassment. It wouldbe unsound for a statute's express enforcement system to require notice and an opportunity to comply while a judicially implied systempermits substantial liability--including potentially an award exceeding a recipient's federal funding level--without regard to either requirement. Pp. 284-290.(c) Absent further direction from Congress, the implied damagesremedy should be fashioned along the same lines as the express remedial scheme. Thus, a damages remedy will not lie unless an official whoat a minimum has authority to address the alleged discrimination andto institute corrective measures on the recipient's behalf has actualknowledge of discrimination and fails adequately to respond. Moreover, the response must amount to deliberate indifference to discrimination, in line with the premise of the statute's administrative enforcement scheme of an official decision by the recipient not to remedy theviolation. Applying the framework to this case is fairly straightforward, as petitioners do not contend they can prevail under an actualnotice standard. Lago Vista's alleged failure to comply with federalregulations requiring it to promulgate and publicize an effective policyand grievance procedure for sexual harassment claims does not establishthe requisite actual notice and deliberate indifference, and the failureto promulgate a grievance procedure does not itself constitute discrimination in violation of Title IX.

He initiated sexual contact with Gebser in thespring, when, while visiting her home ostensibly to give hera book, he kissed and fondled her. The two had sexual in-tercourse on a number of occasions during the remainderof the school year. Their relationship continued through thesummer and into the following school year, and they oftenhad intercourse during class time, although never on schoolproperty.Gebser did not report the relationship to school officials,testifying that while she realized Waldrop's conduct wasimproper, she was uncertain how to react and she wantedto continue having him as a teacher. In October 1992, theparents of two other students complained to the high schoolprincipal about Waldrop's comments in class. The principalarranged a meeting, at which, according to the principal,Waldrop indicated that he did not believe he had made offensive remarks but apologized to the parents and said it wouldnot happen again. The principal also advised Waldrop to becareful about his classroom comments and told the schoolguidance counselor about the meeting, but he did not reportthe parents' complaint to Lago Vista's superintendent, whowas the district's Title IX coordinator. A couple of monthslater, in January 1993, a police officer discovered Waldropand Gebser engaging in sexual intercourse and arrested Waldrop. Lago Vista terminated his employment, and subsequently, the Texas Education Agency revoked his teachinglicense. During this time, the district had not promulgatedor distributed an official grievance procedure for lodging sexual harassment complaints; nor had it issued a formal antiharassment policy.Gebser and her mother filed suit against Lago Vista andWaldrop in state court in November 1993, raising claimsagainst the school district under Title IX, Rev.

They soughtcompensatory and punitive damages from both defendants.After the case was removed, the United States DistrictCourt for the Western District of Texas granted summaryjudgment in favor of Lago Vista on all claims, and remandedthe allegations against Waldrop to state court. In rejectingthe Title IX claim against the school district, the court rea-soned that the statute "was enacted to counterpolicies ofdiscrimination . . . in federally funded education programs,"and that "[o]nly if school administrators have some type ofnotice of the gender discrimination and fail to respond ingood faith can the discrimination be interpreted as a policyof the school district." App. to Pet. for Cert. 6a-7a. Here,the court determined, the parents' complaint to the principalconcerning Waldrop's comments in class was the only oneLago Vista had received about Waldrop, and that evidencewas inadequate to raise a genuine issue on whether theschool district had actual or constructive notice that Waldropwas involved in a sexual relationship with a student.Petitioners appealed only on the Title IX claim. TheCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, Doe v. LagoVista Independent School Dist., 106 F. 3d 1223 (1997), relying in large part on two of its recent decisions, Rosa H. v.San Elizario Independent School Dist., 106 F. 3d 648 (1997),and Canutillo Independent School Dist. v.

The court then determined that LagoVista could not be liable on the basis of constructive notice,finding that there was insufficient evidence to suggest that aschool official should have known about Waldrop's relationship with Gebser.

LAGO VISTA INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DIST.Opinion of the Courtvoke the common law principle that holds an employer vicar-iously liable when an employee is "aided in accomplishing [a]tort by the existence of the agency relation," Restatement(Second) of Agency $ 219(2)(d) (1957) (hereinafter Restatement), explaining that application of that principle wouldresult in school district liability in essentially every case ofteacher-student harassment. 106 F. 3d, at 1225-1226.The court concluded its analysis by reaffirming its holdingin Rosa H. that "school districts are not liable in tort forteacher-student [sexual] harassment under Title IX unlessan employee who has been invested by the school boardwith supervisory power over the offending employee actually knew of the abuse, had the power to end the abuse, andfailed to do so," 106 F. 3d, at 1226, and ruling that petitionerscould not satisfy that standard. The Fifth Circuit's analysisrepresents one of the varying approaches adopted by theCourts of Appeals in assessing a school district's liabilityunder Title IX for a teacher's sexual harassment of a student. See Smith v. Metropolitan School Dist. Perry Twp.,128 F. 3d 1014 (CA7 1997);Kracunas v. Iona College, 119F. 3d 80 (CA2 1997); Doe v. Claiborne County, 103 F. 3d 495,513-515 (CA6 1996); Kinman v. Omaha Public School Dist.,94 F. 3d 463, 469 (CA8 1996). We granted certiorari to address the issue, 522 U. S. 1011 (1997), and we now affirm.IITitle IX provides in pertinent part: "No person . . . shall,on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, bedenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discriminationunder any education program or activity receiving Federalfinancial assistance." 20 U. S. C. $ 1681(a). The expressstatutory means of enforcement is administrative: The statute directs federal agencies that distribute education fundingto establish requirements to effectuate the nondiscriminationmandate, and permits the agencies to enforce those require-ments through "any . . . means authorized by law," including524US2 Unit: $U87 [09-15-00 14:31:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN281Cite as: 524 U. S. 274 (1998)Opinion of the Courtultimately the termination of federal funding. $ 1682. TheCourt held inCannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677(1979), that Title IX is also enforceable through an impliedprivate right of action, a conclusion we do not revisithere. We subsequently established in Franklin v. GwinnettCounty Public Schools, 503 U. S. 60 (1992), that monetarydamages are available in the implied private action.In Franklin, a high school student alleged that a teacherhad sexually abused her on repeated occasions and thatteachers and school administrators knew about the har-assment but took no action, even to the point of dissuadingher from initiating charges. See id., at 63-64. The lowercourts dismissed Franklin's complaint against the school district on the ground that the implied right of action underTitle IX, as a categorical matter, does not encompass recovery in damages. We reversed the lower courts' blanket rule,concluding that Title IX supports a private action for damages, at least "in a case such as this, in which intentionaldiscrimination is alleged." See id., at 74-75. Franklinthereby establishes that a school district can be held liablein damages in cases involving a teacher's sexual harassmentof a student; the decision, however, does not purport to define the contours of that liability.We face that issue squarely in this case. Petitioners,joined by the United States as amicus curiae, would invokestandards used by the Courts of Appeals in Title VII casesinvolving a supervisor's sexual harassment of an employeein the workplace. In support of that approach, they point toa passage in Franklin in which we stated: "Unquestionably,Title IX placed on the Gwinnett County Public Schools theduty not to discriminate on the basis of sex, and `when asupervisor sexually harasses a subordinate because of thesubordinate's sex, that supervisor "discriminate[s]" on thebasis of sex.' Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S.57, 64 (1986). We believe the same rule should apply when ateacher sexually harasses and abuses a student." Id., at 75.524US2 Unit: $U87 [09-15-00 14:31:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN282 GEBSER v. LAGO VISTA INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DIST.Opinion of the CourtMeritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57 (1986),directs courts to look to common law agency principles whenassessing an employer's liability under Title VII for sexualharassment of an employee by a supervisor. See id., at 72.Petitioners and the United States submit that, in light ofFranklin's comparison of teacher-student harassment withsupervisor-employee harassment, agency principles shouldlikewise apply in Title IX actions.Specifically, they advance two possible standards underwhich Lago Vista would be liable for Waldrop's conduct.First, relying on a 1997 "Policy Guidance" issued by the Department of Education, they would hold a school districtliable in damages under Title IX where a teacher is " `aidedin carrying out the sexual harassment of students by his orher position of authority with the institution,' " irrespectiveof whether school district officials had any knowledge of theharassment and irrespective of their response upon becomingaware. Brief for Petitioners 36 (quoting Dept. of Education,Office for Civil Rights, Sexual Harassment Policy Guidance:Harrassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties, 62 Fed. Reg. 12034, 12039 (1997)(1997 Policy Guidance)); Brief for United States as AmicusCuriae 14. That rule is an expression of respondeat superior liability, i. e., vicarious or imputed liability, see Restatement $ 219(2)(d), under which recovery in damages against aschool district would generally follow whenever a teacher'sauthority over a student facilitates the harassment. Second, petitioners and the United States submit that a schooldistrict should at a minimum be liable for damages based ona theory of constructive notice, i. e., where the district knewor "should have known" about harassment but failed to uncover and eliminate it. Brief for Petitioners 28; Brief forUnited States as Amicus Curiae 15-16; see Restatement$ 219(2)(b). Both standards would allow a damages recoveryin a broader range of situations than the rule adopted by the524US2 Unit: $U87 [09-15-00 14:31:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN283Cite as: 524 U. S. 274 (1998)Opinion of the CourtCourt of Appeals, which hinges on actual knowledge by aschool official with authority to end the harassment.Whether educational institutions can be said to violateTitle IX based solely on principles ofrespondeat superior orconstructive notice was not resolved by Franklin's citationof Meritor. That reference to Meritor was made with re-gard to the general proposition that sexual harassment canconstitute discrimination on the basis of sex under Title IX,seeOncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U. S.75, 80-81 (1998), an issue not in dispute here. In fact, theschool district's liability inFranklin did not necessarily turnon principles of imputed liability or constructive notice, asthere was evidence that school officials knew about theharassment but took no action to stop it. See 503 U. S., at63-64. Moreover, Meritor's rationale for concluding thatagency principles guide the liability inquiry under Title VIIrests on an aspect of that statute not found in Title IX:Title VII, in which the prohibition against employment discrimination runs against "an employer," 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a), explicitly defines "employer" to include "any agent,"$ 2000e(b). See Meritor, supra, at 72. Title IX containsno comparable reference to an educational institution's"agents," and so does not expressly call for application ofagency principles.In this case, moreover, petitioners seek not just to establish a Title IX violation but to recover damages based ontheories of respondeat superior and constructive notice. Itis that aspect of their action, in our view, that is most criticalto resolving the case. Unlike Title IX, Title VII contains anexpress cause of action, $ 2000e-5(f), and specifically provides for relief in the form of monetary damages, $ 1981a.Congress therefore has directly addressed the subject ofdamages relief under Title VII and has set out the particular situations in which damages are available as well as themaximum amounts recoverable. $ 1981a(b). With respectto Title IX, however, the private right of action is judicially524US2 Unit: $U87 [09-15-00 14:31:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN284 GEBSER v. LAGO VISTA INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DIST.Opinion of the Courtimplied, see Cannon, 441 U. S., at 717, and there is thus nolegislative expression of the scope of available remedies, including when it is appropriate to award monetary damages.In addition, although the general presumption that courtscan award any appropriate relief in an established cause ofaction,e. g., Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 684 (1946), coupledwith Congress' abrogation of the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity under Title IX, see 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d-7, ledus to conclude in Franklin that Title IX recognizes a damages remedy, 503 U. S., at 68-73; see id., at 78 (Scalia, J.,concurring in judgment), we did so in response to lowercourt decisions holding that Title IX does not support dam-ages relief at all. We made no effort inFranklin to delimitthe circumstances in which a damages remedy should lie.IIIBecause the private right of action under Title IX isjudicially implied, we have a measure of latitude to shape asensible remedial scheme that best comports with the stat-ute. See, e. g., Musick, Peeler & Garrett v. Employers Ins.of Wausau, 508 U. S. 286, 292-293 (1993); Virginia Bank-shares, Inc. v. Sandberg, 501 U. S. 1083, 1104 (1991). Thatendeavor inherently entails a degree of speculation, sinceit addresses an issue on which Congress has not specificallyspoken. See, e. g., Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350, 359 (1991). To guide theanalysis, we generally examine the relevant statute to ensure that we do not fashion the scope of an implied rightin a manner at odds with the statutory structure and purpose. See Musick, Peeler, 508 U. S., at 294-297; id., at 300(Thomas, J., dissenting); Virginia Bankshares, supra, at1102.Those considerations, we think, are pertinent not only tothe scope of the implied right, but also to the scope of theavailable remedies. See Transamerica Mortgage Advisors,Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U. S. 11 (1979); see also Franklin, supra,524US2 Unit: $U87 [09-15-00 14:31:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN285Cite as: 524 U. S. 274 (1998)Opinion of the Courtat 77-78 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). We sug-gested as much inFranklin, where we recognized "the general rule that all appropriate relief is available in an actionbrought to vindicate a federal right," but indicated that therule must be reconciled with congressional purpose. 503U. S., at 68. The "general rule," that is, "yields where nec-essary to carry out the intent of Congress or to avoid frustrating the purposes of the statute involved." GuardiansAssn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City, 463 U. S. 582,595 (1983) (opinion of White, J.); cf., Cannon, 441 U. S, at 703("[A] private remedy should not be implied if it would frustrate the underlying purpose of the legislative scheme").Applying those principles here, we conclude that it would"frustrate the purposes" of Title IX to permit a damagesrecovery against a school district for a teacher's sexual harassment of a student based on principles of respondeat superior or constructive notice, i. e., without actual notice to aschool district official. Because Congress did not expresslycreate a private right of action under Title IX, the statutorytext does not shed light on Congress' intent with respect tothe scope of available remedies. Franklin, 503 U. S., at 71;id., at 76 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). Instead, "weattempt to infer how the [1972] Congress would have addressed the issue had the . . . action been included as anexpress provision in the" statute. Central Bank of Denver,N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164,178 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Musick,Peeler, supra, at 294-295; North Haven Bd. of Ed. v. Bell,456 U. S. 512, 529 (1982).As a general matter, it does not appear that Congress contemplated unlimited recovery in damages against a fundingrecipient where the recipient is unaware of discrimination inits programs. When Title IX was enacted in 1972, the principal civil rights statutes containing an express right of action did not provide for recovery of monetary damages at all,instead allowing only injunctive and equitable relief. See 42524US2 Unit: $U87 [09-15-00 14:31:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN286 GEBSER v. LAGO VISTA INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DIST.Opinion of the CourtU. S. C. $ 2000a-3(a) (1970 ed.); $$ 2000e-5(e), (g) (1970 ed.,Supp. II). It was not until 1991 that Congress made damages available under Title VII, and even then, Congress care-fully limited the amount recoverable in any individual case,calibrating the maximum recovery to the size of the employer. See 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a(b)(3). Adopting petitioners'position would amount, then, to allowing unlimited recoveryof damages under Title IX where Congress has not spokenon the subject of either the right or the remedy, and in theface of evidence that when Congress expressly consideredboth in Title VII it restricted the amount of damagesavailable.Congress enacted Title IX in 1972 with two principal objectives in mind: "[T]o avoid the use of federal resources tosupport discriminatory practices" and "to provide individualcitizens effective protection against those practices." Cannon, supra, at 704. The statute was modeled after Title VIof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, see 441 U. S., at 694-696;Grove City College v. Bell, 465 U. S. 555, 566 (1984), whichis parallel to Title IX except that it prohibits race discrimination, not sex discrimination, and applies in all programsreceiving federal funds, not only in education programs.See 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d et seq. The two statutes operate inthe same manner, conditioning an offer of federal funding ona promise by the recipient not to discriminate, in whatamounts essentially to a contract between the Governmentand the recipient of funds. See Guardians, 463 U. S., at 599(opinion of White, J.); id., at 609 (Powell, J., concurring injudgment); cf. Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981).That contractual framework distinguishes Title IX fromTitle VII, which is framed in terms not of a condition but ofan outright prohibition. Title VII applies to all employerswithout regard to federal funding and aims broadly to "eradicat[e] discrimination throughout the economy." Landgrafv. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 254 (1994) (internal quo524US2 Unit: $U87 [09-15-00 14:31:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN287Cite as: 524 U. S. 274 (1998)Opinion of the Courttation marks omitted). Title VII, moreover, seeks to "makepersons whole for injuries suffered through past discrimination." Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus,whereas Title VII aims centrally to compensate victims ofdiscrimination, Title IX focuses more on "protecting" individuals from discriminatory practices carried out by re-cipients of federal funds.Cannon, supra, at 704. Thatmight explain why, when the Court first recognized the im-plied right under Title IX inCannon, the opinion referredto injunctive or equitable relief in a private action, see 441U. S., at 705, and n. 38, 710, n. 44, 711, but not to a damagesremedy.Title IX's contractual nature has implications for ourconstruction of the scope of available remedies. WhenCongress attaches conditions to the award of federal fundsunder its spending power, U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 1, asit has in Title IX and Title VI, we examine closely thepropriety of private actions holding the recipient liable inmonetary damages for noncompliance with the condition.See Franklin, supra, at 74-75; Guardians, supra, at 596-603 (White, J.); see generally Pennhurst, supra, at 28-29.Our central concern in that regard is with ensuring that "thereceiving entity of federal funds [has] notice that it will beliable for a monetary award." Franklin, supra, at 74. Justice White's opinion announcing the Court's judgment inGuardians Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City,for instance, concluded that the relief in an action under TitleVI alleging unintentional discrimination should be prospective only, because where discrimination is unintentional, "itis surely not obvious that the grantee was aware that it wasadministering the program in violation of the [condition]."463 U. S., at 598. We confront similar concerns here. If aschool district's liability for a teacher's sexual harassmentrests on principles of constructive notice or respondeat superior, it will likewise be the case that the recipient of fundswas unaware of the discrimination. It is sensible to as524US2 Unit: $U87 [09-15-00 14:31:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN288 GEBSER v. LAGO VISTA INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DIST.Opinion of the Courtsume that Congress did not envision a recipient's liability indamages in that situation. SeeRosa H., 106 F. 3d, at 654("When the school board accepted federal funds, it agreednot to discriminate on the basis of sex. We think it unlikelythat it further agreed to suffer liability whenever its employees discriminate on the basis of sex").Most significantly, Title IX contains important clues thatCongress did not intend to allow recovery in damages whereliability rests solely on principles of vicarious liability orconstructive notice. Title IX's express means of enforce-ment--by administrative agencies--operates on an assumption of actual notice to officials of the funding recipient. Thestatute entitles agencies who disburse education fundingto enforce their rules implementing the nondiscriminationmandate through proceedings to suspend or terminate funding or through "other means authorized by law." 20 U. S. C.$ 1682. Significantly, however, an agency may not initiateenforcement proceedings until it "has advised the appropriate person or persons of the failure to comply with therequirement and has determined that compliance cannotbe secured by voluntary means." Ibid. The administrativeregulations implement that obligation, requiring resolutionof compliance issues "by informal means whenever possible,"34 CFR $ 100.7(d) (1997), and prohibiting commencement ofenforcement proceedings until the agency has determinedthat voluntary compliance is unobtainable and "the recipient . . . has been notified of its failure to comply and ofthe action to be taken to effect compliance," $ 100.8(d); see$ 100.8(c).In the event of a violation, a funding recipient may berequired to take "such remedial action as [is] deem[ed]necessary to overcome the effects of [the] discrimination."$ 106.3. While agencies have conditioned continued fundingon providing equitable relief to the victim, see, e. g., NorthHaven, 456 U. S., at 518 (reinstatement of employee), theregulations do not appear to contemplate a condition order524US2 Unit: $U87 [09-15-00 14:31:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN289Cite as: 524 U. S. 274 (1998)Opinion of the Courting payment of monetary damages, and there is no indicationthat payment of damages has been demanded as a conditionof finding a recipient to be in compliance with the statute.See Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae in Franklinv. Gwinnett County School District, O. T. 1991, No. 90-918,p. 24. In Franklin, for instance, the Department of Educa-tion found a violation of Title IX but determined that theschool district came into compliance by virtue of the offend-ing teacher's resignation and the district's institution of agrievance procedure for sexual harassment complaints. 503U. S., at 64, n. 3.Presumably, a central purpose of requiring notice of theviolation "to the appropriate person" and an opportunity forvoluntary compliance before administrative enforcementproceedings can commence is to avoid diverting educationfunding from beneficial uses where a recipient was unawareof discrimination in its programs and is willing to instituteprompt corrective measures. The scope of private damagesrelief proposed by petitioners is at odds with that basicobjective. When a teacher's sexual harassment is imputedto a school district or when a school district is deemed tohave "constructively" known of the teacher's harassment,by assumption the district had no actual knowledge of theteacher's conduct. Nor, of course, did the district have anopportunity to take action to end the harassment or to limitfurther harassment.It would be unsound, we think, for a statute's express system of enforcement to require notice to the recipient andan opportunity to come into voluntary compliance while ajudicially implied system of enforcement permits substantialliability without regard to the recipient's knowledge or itscorrective actions upon receiving notice. Cf. Central Bankof Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A.,511 U. S., at 180 ("[I]t would be `anomalous to impute to Congress an intention to expand the plaintiff class for a judiciallyimplied cause of action beyond the bounds it delineated for524US2 Unit: $U87 [09-15-00 14:31:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN290 GEBSER v. LAGO VISTA INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DIST.Opinion of the Courtcomparable express causes of action' "), quoting Blue ChipStamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723, 736 (1975).Moreover, an award of damages in a particular case mightwell exceed a recipient's level of federal funding. See Tr. ofOral Arg. 35 (Lago Vista's federal funding for 1992-1993 wasroughly $120,000). Where a statute's express enforcementscheme hinges its most severe sanction on notice and un-successful efforts to obtain compliance, we cannot attributeto Congress the intention to have implied an enforcementscheme that allows imposition of greater liability withoutcomparable conditions. IVBecause the express remedial scheme under Title IX ispredicated upon notice to an "appropriate person" and anopportunity to rectify any violation, 20 U. S. C. $ 1682, weconclude, in the absence of further direction from Congress,that the implied damages remedy should be fashioned alongthe same lines. An "appropriate person" under $ 1682 is, ata minimum, an official of the recipient entity with authorityto take corrective action to end the discrimination. Consequently, in cases like this one that do not involve official pol-icy of the recipient entity, we hold that a damages remedywill not lie under Title IX unless an official who at a mini-mum has authority to address the alleged discrimination andto institute corrective measures on the recipient's behalf hasactual knowledge of discrimination in the recipient's programs and fails adequately to respond.We think, moreover, that the response must amount to deliberate indifference to discrimination. The administrativeenforcement scheme presupposes that an official who is advised of a Title IX violation refuses to take action to bringthe recipient into compliance. The premise, in other words,is an official decision by the recipient not to remedy the viola-tion. That framework finds a rough parallel in the standardof deliberate indifference. Under a lower standard, therewould be a risk that the recipient would be liable in dam524US2 Unit: $U87 [09-15-00 14:31:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN291Cite as: 524 U. S. 274 (1998)Opinion of the Courtages not for its own official decision but instead for its em-ployees' independent actions. Comparable considerationsled to our adoption of a deliberate indifference standardfor claims under $ 1983 alleging that a municipality's actionsin failing to prevent a deprivation of federal rights was thecause of the violation. See Board of Comm'rs of Bryan Cty.v.Brown, 520 U. S. 397 (1997); Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S.378, 388-392 (1989); see also Collins v. Harker Heights, 503U. S. 115, 123-124 (1992).Applying the framework to this case is fairly straight-forward, as petitioners do not contend they can prevail underan actual notice standard. The only official alleged to havehad information about Waldrop's misconduct is the highschool principal. That information, however, consisted of acomplaint from parents of other students charging only thatWaldrop had made inappropriate comments during class,which was plainly insufficient to alert the principal to thepossibility that Waldrop was involved in a sexual relationship with a student. Lago Vista, moreover, terminated Waldrop's employment upon learning of his relationship withGebser. Justice Stevens points out in his dissenting opinion that Waldrop of course had knowledge of his own actions.See post, at 299, n. 8. Where a school district's liability restson actual notice principles, however, the knowledge of thewrongdoer himself is not pertinent to the analysis. See Restatement $ 280.Petitioners focus primarily on Lago Vista's asserted failure to promulgate and publicize an effective policy and grievance procedure for sexual harassment claims. They point toDepartment of Education regulations requiring each fundingrecipient to "adopt and publish grievance procedures providing for prompt and equitable resolution" of discriminationcomplaints, 34 CFR $ 106.8(b) (1997), and to notify studentsand others that "it does not discriminate on the basis of sexin the educational programs or activities which it operates,"$ 106.9(a). Lago Vista's alleged failure to comply with the524US2 Unit: $U87 [09-15-00 14:31:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN292 GEBSER v. LAGO VISTA INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DIST.Opinion of the Courtregulations, however, does not establish the requisite actualnotice and deliberate indifference. And in any event, thefailure to promulgate a grievance procedure does not itselfconstitute "discrimination" under Title IX. Of course, theDepartment of Education could enforce the requirement ad-ministratively: Agencies generally have authority to promulgate and enforce requirements that effectuate the statute'snondiscrimination mandate, 20 U. S. C. $ 1682, even if thoserequirements do not purport to represent a definition of dis-crimination under the statute.E. g., Grove City, 465 U. S.,at 574-575 (permitting administrative enforcement of regulation requiring college to execute an "Assurance of Compli-ance" with Title IX). We have never held, however, thatthe implied private right of action under Title IX allowsrecovery in damages for violation of those sorts of administrative requirements. VThe number of reported cases involving sexual harassmentof students in schools confirms that harassment unfortunately is an all too common aspect of the educational experi-ence. No one questions that a student suffers extraordinaryharm when subjected to sexual harassment and abuse by ateacher, and that the teacher's conduct is reprehensible andundermines the basic purposes of the educational system.The issue in this case, however, is whether the independentmisconduct of a teacher is attributable to the school districtthat employs him under a specific federal statute designedprimarily to prevent recipients of federal financial assistancefrom using the funds in a discriminatory manner. Our decision does not affect any right of recovery that an individualmay have against a school district as a matter of state lawor against the teacher in his individual capacity under statelaw or under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. Until Congress speaks directly on the subject, however, we will not hold a schooldistrict liable in damages under Title IX for a teacher'ssexual harassment of a student absent actual notice and de524US2 Unit: $U87 [09-15-00 14:31:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN293Cite as: 524 U. S. 274 (1998)Stevens, J., dissentingliberate indifference. We therefore affirm the judgment ofthe Court of Appeals.
