In this case we consider whether a United States DistrictCourt may strike the filings of a claimant in a forfeiture suitand grant summary judgment against him for failing to ap-pear in a related criminal prosecution. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held this to be a proper exerciseof the District Court's inherent authority. We reverse.A federal grand jury in Nevada indicted Brian Degen fordistributing marijuana, laundering money, and relatedcrimes. On the same day in 1989 that it unsealed the indict-ment, the United States District Court for the District ofNevada also unsealed a civil forfeiture complaint. The Gov-ernment sought to forfeit properties in California, Nevada,and Hawaii, allegedly worth $5.5 million and purchased withproceeds of Degen's drug sales or used to facilitate the sales.84 Stat. 1276, as amended, 21 U. S. C. $$ 881(a)(6)-(a)(7). Anaffidavit by an agent of the Drug Enforcement Agency accompanied the complaint and recounted instances of Degen'salleged drug smuggling during the previous 20 years.*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for Public Citizen byAlan B. Morrison and Allison M. Zieve; and for Ghaith R. Pharaon byRichard F. Lawler.517us3$63L 02-05-99 16:44:37 PAGES OPINPGT822 DEGEN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtDegen is a citizen of the United States and of Switzerland,his father having been born there. Degen moved to Switzerland with his family in 1988. He has not returned to facethe criminal charges against him, and we are advised thatSwitzerland's extradition treaty with the United States doesnot oblige either country to turn its nationals over to theother. While remaining outside this country, however,Degen did file an answer in the civil action to contest theforfeiture. Among other things, he contended the Government's claims were barred by the statute of limitations, 46Stat. 758, as amended, 19 U. S. C. $ 1621, and based on anunlawful retroactive application of the forfeiture laws.The District Court in the forfeiture case did not considerany of these arguments. Instead it granted the Government's motion to strike Degen's claims and entered summaryjudgment against him. The court held Degen was not entitled to be heard in the civil forfeiture action because heremained outside the country, unamenable to criminal prosecution. United States v. Real Property Located at InclineVillage, 755 F. Supp. 308 (1990). After another two yearsconsumed by procedural matters (for the most part involvingattempts by Degen's wife to contest the forfeiture), the District Court entered a final order vesting title to the properties in the United States. The Court of Appeals forthe Ninth Circuit affirmed. United States v. Real Property Located at Incline Village, 47 F. 3d 1511 (1995). Wegranted certiorari. 516 U. S. 1070 (1996).In an ordinary case a citizen has a right to a hearing tocontest the forfeiture of his property, a right secured by theDue Process Clause, United States v. James Daniel GoodReal Property, 510 U. S. 43, 48-62 (1993); Fuentes v. Shevin,407 U. S. 67, 80 (1972); McVeigh v. United States, 11 Wall.259, 266-267 (1871), and implemented by federal rule, RuleC(6) of the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty andMaritime Claims. Nonetheless, the Government argues, the517us3$63L 02-05-99 16:44:37 PAGES OPINPGT823Cite as: 517 U. S. 820 (1996)Opinion of the CourtDistrict Court's inherent powers authorized it to strikeDegen's claims under what some courts have labeled the "fugitive disentitlement doctrine." We have sustained, to besure, the authority of an appellate court to dismiss an appealor writ in a criminal matter when the party seeking reliefbecomes a fugitive. Ortega-Rodriguez v. United States, 507U. S. 234, 239 (1993); Smith v. United States, 94 U. S. 97(1876). The question before us is whether the doctrineshould be extended to allow a court in a civil forfeiture suitto enter judgment against a claimant because he is a fugitivefrom, or otherwise is resisting, a related criminal prosecution. The Courts of Appeals to consider the question havecome to different conclusions (compare the decision here andin United States v. Eng, 951 F. 2d 461 (CA2 1991), withUnited States v. $40,877.59 in United States Currency, 32F. 3d 1151 (CA7 1994), and United States v. $83,320 in UnitedStates Currency, 682 F. 2d 573 (CA6 1982)), precipitating ourgrant of certiorari in this case.Courts invested with the judicial power of the UnitedStates have certain inherent authority to protect their proceedings and judgments in the course of discharging theirtraditional responsibilities. Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501U. S. 32, 43-46 (1991); Link v. Wabash R. Co., 370 U. S. 626,630-631 (1962); United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch 32, 34(1812). The extent of these powers must be delimited withcare, for there is a danger of overreaching when one branchof the Government, without benefit of cooperation or correction from the others, undertakes to define its own authority.Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, 447 U. S. 752, 764 (1980).In many instances the inherent powers of the courts may becontrolled or overridden by statute or rule. Carlisle v.United States, ante, at 426; Bank of Nova Scotia v. UnitedStates, 487 U. S. 250, 254 (1988). Principles of deferencecounsel restraint in resorting to inherent power, Chambers v.NASCO, supra, at 44, and require its use to be a reasonable517us3$63L 02-05-99 16:44:37 PAGES OPINPGT824 DEGEN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtresponse to the problems and needs that provoke it, OrtegaRodriguez v. United States, supra, at 244; Thomas v. Arn,474 U. S. 140, 146-148 (1985).In accord with these principles, we have held federalcourts do have authority to dismiss an appeal or writ of certiorari if the party seeking relief is a fugitive while the mat-ter is pending. Several reasons have been given for therule. First, so long as the party cannot be found, the judg-ment on review may be impossible to enforce. This was therationale of the first case to acknowledge the doctrine, Smithv.United States, supra, at 97: "It is clearly within our discretion to refuse to hear a criminal case in error, unless theconvicted party, suing out the writ, is where he can be madeto respond to any judgment we may render." See also Bohanan v. Nebraska, 125 U. S. 692 (1887); Eisler v. UnitedStates, 338 U. S. 189 (1949). Second, we have said an appellant's escape "disentitles" him "to call upon the resources ofthe Court for determination of his claims." Molinaro v.New Jersey, 396 U. S. 365, 366 (1970) (per curiam). Thecases cited so far involved the dismissal of fugitives' petitionsin this Court. In reviewing similar practices in state courtsfor conformity with the Due Process Clause, we have notedfurther reasons for them: Disentitlement "discourages thefelony of escape and encourages voluntary surrenders," and"promotes the efficient, dignified operation" of the courts.Estelle v. Dorrough, 420 U. S. 534, 537 (1975) (per curiam)(using those reasons to justify refusing to reinstate an appealeven once an escaped appellant is recaptured). See alsoAllen v. Georgia, 166 U. S. 138 (1897).Against this backdrop came our decision four Terms ago inOrtega-Rodriguez. The defendant had escaped from federalcustody after conviction but before sentencing. He was sentenced in absentia, but later was recaptured and resentenced; he then filed an appeal, which was dismissed on theauthority of Smith v. United States, supra, and the otherdisentitlement cases just described. We reversed, holding517us3$63L 02-05-99 16:44:37 PAGES OPINPGT825Cite as: 517 U. S. 820 (1996)Opinion of the Courtthose precedents did not justify dismissal of an appeal by afugitive recaptured before the appeal was filed. We notedthe judgment of the Court of Appeals would be enforceableagainst the appellant, and that his earlier absence, when noappeal was pending, did not threaten the dignity of the courtimposing the sanction. Ortega-Rodriguez v. United States,507 U. S., at 244-246. We did not rule out the possibility ofappellate disentitlement where necessary to prevent actualprejudice to the Government from a fugitive's extended absence, id., at 249, but we concluded the sanction of disentitle-ment was unjustified as a sanction applicable to all caseswhere an escape once had occurred, id., at 249-251. We conduct a similar examination of the disentitlement imposedhere, and find it likewise unjustified.There is no risk in this case of delay or frustration in determining the merits of the Government's forfeiture claimsor in enforcing the resulting judgment. The Governmenthas shown probable cause to forfeit the property, and Degenmust refute the showing or suffer its loss. Since the court'sjurisdiction over the property is secure despite Degen'sabsence, there is no danger the court in the forfeiture suitwill waste its time rendering a judgment unenforceable inpractice.The Government is on stronger ground in suggesting thecriminal prosecution against Degen might be compromisedby his participation in the forfeiture case. The problemstems from the differences between the discovery privilegesavailable to Degen in each case. See Afro-Lecon, Inc. v.United States, 820 F. 2d 1198, 1203-1204 (CA Fed. 1987);Campbell v. Eastland, 307 F. 2d 478, 487 (CA5 1962). Acriminal defendant is entitled to rather limited discovery,with no general right to obtain the statements of the Government's witnesses before they have testified. Fed. RulesCrim. Proc. 16(a)(2), 26.2. In a civil case, by contrast, aparty is entitled as a general matter to discovery of any information sought if it appears "reasonably calculated to lead517us3$63L 02-05-99 16:44:37 PAGES OPINPGT826 DEGEN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtto the discovery of admissible evidence." Fed. Rule Civ.Proc. 26(b)(1). The Government contends Degen might usethe rules of civil discovery in the forfeiture suit to gain animproper advantage in the criminal matter, prying into theprosecution's case in a manner not otherwise permitted.These problems are not uncommon when criminal and civilforfeiture suits are pending at the same time, but they aremade acute by Degen's absence. If he were in federal custody, the risk of compromising the criminal case could beavoided by staying the civil suit until the prosecution is over.21 U. S. C. $ 881(i). Cf. United States v. Kordel, 397 U. S. 1,9 (1970). Degen rendered this solution impractical by frustrating the prosecution of the criminal case against him.The criminal trial cannot begin until he returns, Crosby v.United States, 506 U. S. 255 (1993); if the civil matter weresubordinated to the criminal, the forfeiture could be held inabeyance for an indefinite time. This delay would be prejudicial to the Government, for if its forfeiture claims are good,its right to the properties is immediate. We nonetheless aresatisfied the District Court has the means to resolve thesedilemmas without resorting to a rule forbidding all participation by the absent claimant.First, the District Court has its usual authority to managediscovery in a civil suit, including the power to enter protective orders limiting discovery as the interests of justice require. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26(c). Decisions in the Courtsof Appeals have sustained protective orders to prevent parties from using civil discovery to evade restrictions on discovery in criminal cases. See, e. g., In re Ramu Corp., 903F. 2d 312, 316-317, 320-321 (CA5 1990); United States v.Stewart, 872 F. 2d 957, 962-963 (CA10 1989); Campbell v.Eastland, supra, at 487. See also Capital Engineering &Mfg. Co., Inc. v. Weinberger, 695 F. Supp. 36, 41-42 (DC 1988);Founding Church of Scientology v. Kelley, 77 F. R. D. 378,380-381 (DC 1977).517us3$63L 02-05-99 16:44:37 PAGES OPINPGT827Cite as: 517 U. S. 820 (1996)Opinion of the CourtSecond, the court can exercise its discretion to manage thecivil litigation to avoid interference with the criminal case.If, for instance, the Government were unable to rebut De-gen's arguments except by revealing confidential details ofthe criminal investigation, the court could consider controlling or limiting the form of proof, or in an extreme case eventhe theories it permits the absent party to pursue, to preventhim from exploiting the asymmetries he creates by partici-pating in one suit but not the other.Third, of course, Degen's absence entitles him to no advan-tage. If his unwillingness to appear in person results innoncompliance with a legitimate order of the court respecting pleading, discovery, the presentation of evidence, orother matters, he will be exposed to the same sanctions asany other uncooperative party. A federal court has at itsdisposal an array of means to enforce its orders, includingdismissal in an appropriate case. Again, its powers includethose furnished by federal rule, see, e. g., Fed. Rules Civ.Proc. 37, 41(b); National Hockey League v. MetropolitanHockey Club, Inc., 427 U. S. 639 (1976) (per curiam); SocieteInternationale pour Participations Industrielles et Commerciales, S. A. v. Rogers, 357 U. S. 197, 212 (1958); cf.United States v. Pole No. 3172, 852 F. 2d 636, 641-642 (CA11988), and by inherent authority, see, e. g., Chambers v.NASCO, Inc., 501 U. S., at 44-45; Link v. Wabash R. Co., 370U. S., at 630-633; Woodson v. Surgitek, Inc., 57 F. 3d 1406,1416-1417 (CA5 1995); Zebrowski v. Hanna, 973 F. 2d 1001,1006 (CA1 1992) (Breyer, C. J.).The details of these steps are committed to the discretionof the District Court; it would be premature to consider nowthe precise measures the court should adopt as the case proceeds. The existence of these alternative means of protecting the Government's interests, however, shows the lack ofnecessity for the harsh sanction of absolute disentitlement.Consideration of some of Degen's defenses, such as the statute of limitations, appears to require little discovery. If517us3$63L 02-05-99 16:44:37 PAGES OPINPGT828 DEGEN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtthey have merit, the Government should not prevail; if theyare groundless, the Government's interests will not be compromised by their consideration.We have yet to consider two other purposes said to beadvanced by disentitlement: The need to redress the indignity visited upon the District Court by Degen's absence fromthe criminal proceeding, and the need to deter flight fromcriminal prosecution by Degen and others. Both interestsare substantial, but disentitlement is too blunt an instrumentfor advancing them. Without resolving whether Degen is afugitive in all the senses of the word debated by the parties,we acknowledge disquiet at the spectacle of a criminal defendant reposing in Switzerland, beyond the reach of ourcriminal courts, while at the same time mailing papers to thecourt in a related civil action and expecting them to be honored. Cf. United States v. Sharpe, 470 U. S. 675, 681-682,n. 2 (1985). A court-made rule striking Degen's claims andentering summary judgment against him as a sanction, however, would be an arbitrary response to the conduct it is supposed to redress or discourage.The right of a citizen to defend his property against attackin a court is corollary to the plaintiff 's right to sue there.McVeigh v. United States, 11 Wall., at 267. For this reasonwe have held it unconstitutional to use disentitlement similarto this as punishment for rebellion against the United States,ibid., or, in at least one instance, for contempt of court,Hovey v. Elliott, 167 U. S. 409, 413-414 (1897). We need not,and do not, intimate a view on whether enforcement of adisentitlement rule under proper authority would violate dueprocess, cf. Blackmer v. United States, 284 U. S. 421 (1932).It remains the case, however, that the sanction of disentitlement is most severe and so could disserve the dignitary purposes for which it is invoked. The dignity of a court derivesfrom the respect accorded its judgments. That respect iseroded, not enhanced, by too free a recourse to rules foreclosing consideration of claims on the merits.517us3$63L 02-05-99 16:44:37 PAGES OPINPGT829Cite as: 517 U. S. 820 (1996)Opinion of the CourtThere would be a measure of rough justice in sayingDegen must take the bitter with the sweet, and participatein the District Court either for all purposes or none. Butthe justice would be too rough. A court's inherent power islimited by the necessity giving rise to its exercise. Therewas no necessity to justify the rule of disentitlement in thiscase; to strike Degen's filings and grant judgment againsthim would be an excessive response to the concerns hereadvanced.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, andthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.
