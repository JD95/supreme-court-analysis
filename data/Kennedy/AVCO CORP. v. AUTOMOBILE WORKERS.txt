A state-owned public television broadcaster sponsored acandidate debate from which it excluded an independent candidate with little popular support. The issue before us iswhether, by reason of its state ownership, the station had aconstitutional obligation to allow every candidate access tothe debate. We conclude that, unlike most other public television programs, the candidate debate was subject to consti-tutional constraints applicable to nonpublic fora under ourforum precedents. Even so, the broadcaster's decision toexclude the candidate was a reasonable, viewpoint-neutralexercise of journalistic discretion.IPetitioner, the Arkansas Educational Television Com-mission (AETC), is an Arkansas state agency owning andoperating a network of five noncommercial television sta-tions (Arkansas Educational Television Network or AETN).The eight members of AETC are appointed by the Governorfor 8-year terms and are removable only for good cause.Ark.

FORBESOpinion of the Courting positions. Ark. Code Ann. $ 6-3-102(a)(3) (Supp. 1997).To insulate its programming decisions from political pressure, AETC employs an executive director and professionalstaff who exercise broad editorial discretion in planning thenetwork's programming. AETC has also adopted the Statement of Principles of Editorial Integrity in Public Broadcast-ing, which counsel adherence to "generally accepted broadcasting industry standards, so that the programming serviceis free from pressure from political or financial supporters."App. to Pet. for Cert. 82a.In the spring of 1992, AETC staff began planning a seriesof debates between candidates for federal office in the November 1992 elections. AETC decided to televise a totalof five debates, scheduling one for the Senate election andone for each of the four congressional elections in Arkansas.Working in close consultation with Bill Simmons, ArkansasBureau Chief for the Associated Press, AETC staff developed a debate format allowing about 53 minutes during each1-hour debate for questions to and answers by the candidates. Given the time constraint, the staff and Simmons"decided to limit participation in the debates to the majorparty candidates or any other candidate who had strongpopular support." Record, Affidavit of Bill Simmons || 5.On June 17, 1992, AETC invited the Republican and Democratic candidates for Arkansas' Third Congressional District to participate in the AETC debate for that seat. Twomonths later, after obtaining the 2,000 signatures requiredby Arkansas law, see Ark. Code Ann. $ 7-7-103(c)(1) (Supp.1993), respondent Ralph Forbes was certified as an independent candidate qualified to appear on the ballot for the seat.Forbes was a perennial candidate who had sought, withoutsuccess, a number of elected offices in Arkansas. On August24, 1992, he wrote to AETC requesting permission to participate in the debate for his district, scheduled for October22, 1992. On September 4, AETC Executive Director SusanHowarth denied Forbes' request, explaining that AETC had523US3 Unit: $U63 [04-28-00 22:27:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN671Cite as: 523 U. S. 666 (1998)Opinion of the Court"made a bona fide journalistic judgement that our viewerswould best be served by limiting the debate" to the candidates already invited. App. 61.On October 19, 1992, Forbes filed suit against AETC, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief as well as damages.Forbes claimed he was entitled to participate in the debateunder both the First Amendment and 47 U. S. C. $ 315, whichaffords political candidates a limited right of access to tele-vision air time. Forbes requested a preliminary injunctionmandating his inclusion in the debate. The District Courtdenied the request, as did the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The District Court later dismissed Forbes' action for failure to state a claim.Sitting en banc, the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of Forbes' statutory claim, holding that he had failedto exhaust his administrative remedies. The court reversed, however, the dismissal of Forbes' First Amendmentclaim. Observing that AETC is a state actor, the court heldForbes had "a qualified right of access created by AETN'ssponsorship of a debate, and that AETN must have [had] alegitimate reason to exclude him strong enough to surviveFirst Amendment scrutiny." Forbes v. Arkansas Ed. Television Network Foundation, 22 F. 3d 1423, 1428 (CA8), cert.denied, 513 U. S. 995 (1994), 514 U. S. 1110 (1995). BecauseAETC had not yet filed an answer to Forbes' complaint, ithad not given any reason for excluding him from the debate,and the Court of Appeals remanded the action for furtherproceedings.On remand, the District Court found as a matter of lawthat the debate was a nonpublic forum, and the issue becamewhether Forbes' views were the reason for his exclusion.At trial, AETC professional staff testified Forbes was excluded because he lacked any campaign organization, had notgenerated appreciable voter support, and was not regardedas a serious candidate by the press covering the election.The jury made express findings that AETC's decision to ex523US3 Unit: $U63 [04-28-00 22:27:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN672 ARKANSAS ED. TELEVISION COMM'N v. FORBESOpinion of the Courtclude Forbes had not been influenced by political pressureor disagreement with his views. The District Court enteredjudgment for AETC.The Court of Appeals again reversed. The court acknowledged that AETC's decision to exclude Forbes "wasmade in good faith" and was "exactly the kind of journalisticjudgment routinely made by newspeople." 93 F. 3d 497, 505(CA8 1996). The court asserted, nevertheless, that AETChad "opened its facilities to a particular group--candidatesrunning for the Third District Congressional seat."Id.,at 504. AETC's action, the court held, made the debate apublic forum, to which all candidates "legally qualified to ap-pear on the ballot" had a presumptive right of access.Ibid.Applying strict scrutiny, the court determined that AETC'sassessment of Forbes' "political viability" was neither a"compelling nor [a] narrowly tailored" reason for excludinghim from the debate. Id., at 504-505.A conflict with the decision of the United States Courtof Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in Chandler v. GeorgiaPublic Telecommunications Comm'n, 917 F. 2d 486 (1990),cert. denied, 502 U. S. 816 (1991), together with the manifestimportance of the case, led us to grant certiorari. 520 U. S.1114 (1997). We now reverse.IIForbes has long since abandoned his statutory claimsunder 47 U. S. C. $ 315, and so the issue is whether his exclusion from the debate was consistent with the First Amend-ment. The Court of Appeals held it was not, applying ourpublic forum precedents. Appearing as amicus curiae insupport of petitioner, the United States argues that ourforum precedents should be of little relevance in the contextof television broadcasting. At the outset, then, it is instructive to ask whether public forum principles apply to the caseat all.Having first arisen in the context of streets and parks, thepublic forum doctrine should not be extended in a mechanical523US3 Unit: $U63 [04-28-00 22:27:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN673Cite as: 523 U. S. 666 (1998)Opinion of the Courtway to the very different context of public television broad-casting. In the case of streets and parks, the open accessand viewpoint neutrality commanded by the doctrine is"compatible with the intended purpose of the property."Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S.37, 49 (1983). So too was the requirement of viewpoint neu-trality compatible with the university's funding of studentpublications in Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ.of Va., 515 U. S. 819 (1995). In the case of television broadcasting, however, broad rights of access for outside speakerswould be antithetical, as a general rule, to the discretion thatstations and their editorial staff must exercise to fulfill theirjournalistic purpose and statutory obligations.Congress has rejected the argument that "broadcast facilities should be open on a nonselective basis to all personswishing to talk about public issues."Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee, 412U. S. 94, 105 (1973). Instead, television broadcasters enjoythe "widest journalistic freedom" consistent with their publicresponsibilities.Id., at 110; FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U. S. 364, 378 (1984). Among the broadcast-er's responsibilities is the duty to schedule programmingthat serves the "public interest, convenience, and necessity."47 U. S. C. $ 309(a). Public and private broadcasters alikeare not only permitted, but indeed required, to exercise substantial editorial discretion in the selection and presentationof their programming.As a general rule, the nature of editorial discretion counsels against subjecting broadcasters to claims of viewpointdiscrimination. Programming decisions would be particularly vulnerable to claims of this type because even principled exclusions rooted in sound journalistic judgment canoften be characterized as viewpoint based. To comply withtheir obligation to air programming that serves the publicinterest, broadcasters must often choose among speakersexpressing different viewpoints. "That editors--newspaperor broadcast--can and do abuse this power is beyond doubt,"523US3 Unit: $U63 [04-28-00 22:27:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN674 ARKANSAS ED. TELEVISION COMM'N v. FORBESOpinion of the CourtColumbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 412 U. S., at 124; but"[c]alculated risks of abuse are taken in order to preservehigher values." Id., at 125. Much like a university select-ing a commencement speaker, a public institution selectingspeakers for a lecture series, or a public school prescribingits curriculum, a broadcaster by its nature will facilitatethe expression of some viewpoints instead of others. Werethe judiciary to require, and so to define and approve, pre-established criteria for access, it would risk implicatingthe courts in judgments that should be left to the exerciseof journalistic discretion.When a public broadcaster exercises editorial discretion inthe selection and presentation of its programming, it engagesin speech activity. Cf. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v.FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 636 (1994) ("Through `original programming or by exercising editorial discretion over which stations or programs to include in its repertoire,' cable programmers and operators `see[k] to communicate messages ona wide variety of topics and in a wide variety of formats' ")(quoting Los Angeles v. Preferred Communications, Inc.,476 U. S. 488, 494 (1986)). Although programming decisionsoften involve the compilation of the speech of third parties,the decisions nonetheless constitute communicative acts.See Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and BisexualGroup of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557, 570 (1995) (a speakerneed not "generate, as an original matter, each item featuredin the communication").Claims of access under our public forum precedents couldobstruct the legitimate purposes of television broadcasters.Were the doctrine given sweeping application in this context,courts "would be required to oversee far more of the day-today operations of broadcasters' conduct, deciding such questions as whether a particular individual or group has hadsufficient opportunity to present its viewpoint and whethera particular viewpoint has already been sufficiently aired."Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., supra, at 127. "The523US3 Unit: $U63 [04-28-00 22:27:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN675Cite as: 523 U. S. 666 (1998)Opinion of the Courtresult would be a further erosion of the journalistic discre-tion of broadcasters," transferring "control over the treatment of public issues from the licensees who are accountablefor broadcast performance to private individuals" who bringsuit under our forum precedents. 412 U. S., at 124. In effect, we would "exchange `public trustee' broadcasting, withall its limitations, for a system of self-appointed editorialcommentators." Id., at 125.In the absence of any congressional command to "[r]egimen[t] broadcasters" in this manner, id., at 127, we are disin-clined to do so through doctrines of our own design. Thisis not to say the First Amendment would bar the legislativeimposition of neutral rules for access to public broadcasting.Instead, we say that, in most cases, the First Amendment ofits own force does not compel public broadcasters to allowthird parties access to their programming.Although public broadcasting as a general matter doesnot lend itself to scrutiny under the forum doctrine, candidate debates present the narrow exception to the rule. Fortwo reasons, a candidate debate like the one at issue hereis different from other programming. First, unlike AETC'sother broadcasts, the debate was by design a forum for political speech by the candidates. Consistent with the long tradition of candidate debates, the implicit representation ofthe broadcaster was that the views expressed were thoseof the candidates, not its own. The very purpose of the debate was to allow the candidates to express their views withminimal intrusion by the broadcaster. In this respect thedebate differed even from a political talk show, whose hostcan express partisan views and then limit the discussion tothose ideas.Second, in our tradition, candidate debates are of exceptional significance in the electoral process. "[I]t is of particular importance that candidates have the . . . opportunityto make their views known so that the electorate may intelligently evaluate the candidates' personal qualities and their523US3 Unit: $U63 [04-28-00 22:27:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN676 ARKANSAS ED. TELEVISION COMM'N v. FORBESOpinion of the Courtpositions on vital public issues before choosing among themon election day." CBS, Inc. v. FCC, 453 U. S. 367, 396 (1981)(internal quotation marks omitted). Deliberation on thepositions and qualifications of candidates is integral to oursystem of government, and electoral speech may have itsmost profound and widespread impact when it is disseminated through televised debates. A majority of the popu-lation cites television as its primary source of election information, and debates are regarded as the "only occasionduring a campaign when the attention of a large portion ofthe American public is focused on the election, as well asthe only campaign information format which potentiallyoffers sufficient time to explore issues and policies in depthin a neutral forum." Congressional Research Service, Campaign Debates in Presidential General Elections, summ.(June 15, 1993).As we later discuss, in many cases it is not feasible forthe broadcaster to allow unlimited access to a candidate debate. Yet the requirement of neutrality remains; a broad-caster cannot grant or deny access to a candidate debateon the basis of whether it agrees with a candidate's views.Viewpoint discrimination in this context would present nota "[c]alculated ris[k]," Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.,supra, at 125, but an inevitability of skewing the electoraldialogue.The special characteristics of candidate debates supportthe conclusion that the AETC debate was a forum of sometype. The question of what type must be answered by ref-erence to our public forum precedents, to which we now turn.IIIForbes argues, and the Court of Appeals held, that thedebate was a public forum to which he had a First Amendment right of access. Under our precedents, however, thedebate was a nonpublic forum, from which AETC could exclude Forbes in the reasonable, viewpoint-neutral exerciseof its journalistic discretion.523US3 Unit: $U63 [04-28-00 22:27:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN677Cite as: 523 U. S. 666 (1998)Opinion of the CourtAFor our purposes, it will suffice to employ the catego-ries of speech fora already established and discussed in ourcases. "[T]he Court [has] identified three types of fora: thetraditional public forum, the public forum created by government designation, and the nonpublic forum." Corneliusv.NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788,802 (1985). Traditional public fora are defined by the objective characteristics of the property, such as whether, "bylong tradition or by government fiat," the property has been"devoted to assembly and debate." Perry Ed. Assn., 460U. S., at 45. The government can exclude a speaker froma traditional public forum "only when the exclusion is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and the exclu-sion is narrowly drawn to achieve that interest." Cornelius,supra, at 800.Designated public fora, in contrast, are created by purposeful governmental action. "The government does notcreate a [designated] public forum by inaction or by permitting limited discourse, but only by intentionally opening anontraditional public forum for public discourse." 473 U. S.,at 802; accord, International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U. S. 672, 678 (1992) (ISKCON) (desig-nated public forum is "property that the State has openedfor expressive activity by part or all of the public"). Hence"the Court has looked to the policy and practice of thegovernment to ascertain whether it intended to designatea place not traditionally open to assembly and debate as apublic forum." Cornelius, 473 U. S., at 802. If the gov-ernment excludes a speaker who falls within the class towhich a designated public forum is made generally available,its action is subject to strict scrutiny. Ibid.; United Statesv. Kokinda, 497 U. S. 720, 726-727 (1990) (plurality opinionofO'Connor, J.).Other government properties are either nonpublic foraor not fora at all. ISKCON, supra, at 678-679. The gov-ernment can restrict access to a nonpublic forum "as long523US3 Unit: $U63 [04-28-00 22:27:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN678 ARKANSAS ED. TELEVISION COMM'N v. FORBESOpinion of the Courtas the restrictions are reasonable and [are] not an effort tosuppress expression merely because public officials opposethe speaker's view." Cornelius, supra, at 800 (internal quo-tation marks omitted).In summary, traditional public fora are open for expressiveactivity regardless of the government's intent. The objective characteristics of these properties require the govern-ment to accommodate private speakers. The governmentis free to open additional properties for expressive use bythe general public or by a particular class of speakers,thereby creating designated public fora. Where the prop-erty is not a traditional public forum and the governmenthas not chosen to create a designated public forum, the prop-erty is either a nonpublic forum or not a forum at all.BThe parties agree the AETC debate was not a traditionalpublic forum. The Court has rejected the view that traditional public forum status extends beyond its historic con-fines, see ISKCON, 505 U. S., at 680-681; and even had amore expansive conception of traditional public fora beenadopted, see, e. g., id., at 698-699 (Kennedy, J., concurringin judgments), the almost unfettered access of a traditionalpublic forum would be incompatible with the programmingdictates a television broadcaster must follow. See supra, at673-675. The issue, then, is whether the debate was a des-ignated public forum or a nonpublic forum.Under our precedents, the AETC debate was not a desig-nated public forum. To create a forum of this type, the government must intend to make the property "generally avail-able,"Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263, 264 (1981), to a classof speakers. Accord, Cornelius, supra, at 802. In Widmar,for example, a state university created a public forum forregistered student groups by implementing a policy that expressly made its meeting facilities "generally open" to suchgroups. 454 U. S., at 267; accord, Perry, supra, at 45 (desig523US3 Unit: $U63 [04-28-00 22:27:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN679Cite as: 523 U. S. 666 (1998)Opinion of the Courtnated public forum is "generally open"). A designated pub-lic forum is not created when the government allows selective access for individual speakers rather than general accessfor a class of speakers. InPerry, for example, the Courtheld a school district's internal mail system was not a designated public forum even though selected speakers were ableto gain access to it. The basis for the holding inPerry wasexplained by the Court in Cornelius:"In contrast to the general access policy in Widmar,school board policy did not grant general access to theschool mail system. The practice was to require permission from the individual school principal before ac-cess to the system to communicate with teachers wasgranted." 473 U. S., at 803.And in Cornelius itself, the Court held the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) charity drive was not a designatedpublic forum because "[t]he Government's consistent policyha[d] been to limit participation in the CFC to `appropriate'[i. e., charitable rather than political] voluntary agencies andto require agencies seeking admission to obtain permissionfrom federal and local Campaign officials."Id., at 804.These cases illustrate the distinction between "generalaccess,"id., at 803, which indicates the property is a designated public forum, and "selective access," id., at 805,which indicates the property is a nonpublic forum. On onehand, the government creates a designated public forumwhen it makes its property generally available to a certainclass of speakers, as the university made its facilities generally available to student groups in Widmar. On the otherhand, the government does not create a designated publicforum when it does no more than reserve eligibility for access to the forum to a particular class of speakers, whosemembers must then, as individuals, "obtain permission," 473U. S., at 804, to use it. For instance, the Federal Government did not create a designated public forum in Cornelius523US3 Unit: $U63 [04-28-00 22:27:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN680 ARKANSAS ED. TELEVISION COMM'N v. FORBESOpinion of the Courtwhen it reserved eligibility for participation in the CFCdrive to charitable agencies, and then made individual, nonministerial judgments as to which of the eligible agencieswould participate.Ibid.The Cornelius distinction between general and selectiveaccess furthers First Amendment interests. By recognizingthe distinction, we encourage the government to open itsproperty to some expressive activity in cases where, if facedwith an all-or-nothing choice, it might not open the propertyat all. That this distinction turns on governmental intentdoes not render it unprotective of speech. Rather, it reflectsthe reality that, with the exception of traditional public fora,the government retains the choice of whether to designateits property as a forum for specified classes of speakers.Here, the debate did not have an open-microphone format.Contrary to the assertion of the Court of Appeals, AETCdid not make its debate generally available to candidates forArkansas' Third Congressional District seat. Instead, justas the Federal Government in Cornelius reserved eligibilityfor participation in the CFC program to certain classes ofvoluntary agencies, AETC reserved eligibility for participation in the debate to candidates for the Third CongressionalDistrict seat (as opposed to some other seat). At that point,just as the Government in Cornelius made agency-by-agencydeterminations as to which of the eligible agencies wouldparticipate in the CFC, AETC made candidate-by-candidatedeterminations as to which of the eligible candidates wouldparticipate in the debate. "Such selective access, unsupported by evidence of a purposeful designation for public use,does not create a public forum." Id., at 805. Thus the debate was a nonpublic forum.In addition to being a misapplication of our precedents, theCourt of Appeals' holding would result in less speech, notmore. In ruling that the debate was a public forum open toall ballot-qualified candidates, 93 F. 3d, at 504, the Court ofAppeals would place a severe burden upon public broadcast523US3 Unit: $U63 [04-28-00 22:27:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN681Cite as: 523 U. S. 666 (1998)Opinion of the Courters who air candidates' views. In each of the 1988, 1992,and 1996 Presidential elections, for example, no fewer than19 candidates appeared on the ballot in at least one State.See Twentieth Century Fund Task Force on Presidential Debates, Let America Decide 148 (1995); Federal Election Commission, Federal Elections 92, p. 9 (1993); Federal ElectionCommission, Federal Elections 96, p. 11 (1997). In the 1996congressional elections, it was common for 6 to 11 candidatesto qualify for the ballot for a particular seat. See 1996 Election Results, 54 Congressional Quarterly Weekly Report3250-3257 (1996). In the 1993 New Jersey gubernatorialelection, to illustrate further, sample ballot mailings includedthe written statements of 19 candidates. See N. Y. Times,Sept. 11, 1993, section 1, p. 26, col. 5. On logistical groundsalone, a public television editor might, with reason, decidethat the inclusion of all ballot-qualified candidates would"actually undermine the educational value and quality ofdebates." Let America Decide, supra, at 148.Were it faced with the prospect of cacophony, on the onehand, and First Amendment liability, on the other, a publictelevision broadcaster might choose not to air candidates'views at all. A broadcaster might decide " `the safe courseis to avoid controversy,' . . . and by so doing diminish thefree flow of information and ideas." Turner BroadcastingSystem, Inc., 512 U. S., at 656 (quoting Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U. S. 241, 257 (1974)). In thiscircumstance, a "[g]overnment-enforced right of access inescapably `dampens the vigor and limits the variety of publicdebate.' " Ibid. (quoting New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,376 U. S. 254, 279 (1964)).These concerns are more than speculative. As a directresult of the Court of Appeals' decision in this case, theNebraska Educational Television Network canceled a scheduled debate between candidates in Nebraska's 1996 UnitedStates Senate race. See Lincoln Journal Star, Aug. 24, 1996,523US3 Unit: $U63 [04-28-00 22:27:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN682 ARKANSAS ED. TELEVISION COMM'N v. FORBESOpinion of the Courtp. 1A, col. 6. A First Amendment jurisprudence yieldingthese results does not promote speech but represses it.CThe debate's status as a nonpublic forum, however, didnot give AETC unfettered power to exclude any candidateit wished. As Justice O'Connor has observed, nonpublicforum status "does not mean that the government can restrict speech in whatever way it likes." ISKCON, 505 U. S.,at 687. To be consistent with the First Amendment, theexclusion of a speaker from a nonpublic forum must not bebased on the speaker's viewpoint and must otherwise be reasonable in light of the purpose of the property. Cornelius,473 U. S., at 800.In this case, the jury found Forbes' exclusion was notbased on "objections or opposition to his views." App. toPet. for Cert. 23a. The record provides ample support forthis finding, demonstrating as well that AETC's decision toexclude him was reasonable. AETC Executive DirectorSusan Howarth testified Forbes' views had "absolutely" norole in the decision to exclude him from the debate. App.142. She further testified Forbes was excluded because(1) "the Arkansas voters did not consider him a serious can-didate"; (2) "the news organizations also did not consider hima serious candidate"; (3) "the Associated Press and a nationalelection result reporting service did not plan to run his namein results on election night"; (4) Forbes "apparently hadlittle, if any, financial support, failing to report campaignfinances to the Secretary of State's office or to the FederalElection Commission"; and (5) "there [was] no `Forbes forCongress' campaign headquarters other than his house."Id., at 126-127. Forbes himself described his campaignorganization as "bedlam" and the media coverage of his cam-paign as "zilch." Id., at 91, 96. It is, in short, beyond dispute that Forbes was excluded not because of his viewpointbut because he had generated no appreciable public interest.523US3 Unit: $U63 [04-28-00 22:27:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN683Cite as: 523 U. S. 666 (1998)Stevens, J., dissentingCf. Perry, 460 U. S., at 49 (exclusion from nonpublic forum"based on thestatus" rather than the views of the speakeris permissible (emphasis in original)).There is no substance to Forbes' suggestion that he wasexcluded because his views were unpopular or out of themainstream. His own objective lack of support, not hisplatform, was the criterion. Indeed, the very premise ofForbes' contention is mistaken. A candidate with uncon-ventional views might well enjoy broad support by virtue ofa compelling personality or an exemplary campaign organi-zation. By the same token, a candidate with a traditionalplatform might enjoy little support due to an inept campaignor any number of other reasons.Nor did AETC exclude Forbes in an attempted manipulation of the political process. The evidence provided pow-erful support for the jury's express finding that AETC's exclusion of Forbes was not the result of "political pressurefrom anyone inside or outside [AETC]." App. to Pet. forCert. 22a. There is no serious argument that AETC did notact in good faith in this case. AETC excluded Forbes because the voters lacked interest in his candidacy, not becauseAETC itself did.The broadcaster's decision to exclude Forbes was a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral exercise of journalistic discretionconsistent with the First Amendment. The judgment of theCourt of Appeals is Reversed.Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter andJustice Ginsburg join, dissenting.The Court has decided that a state-owned television network has no "constitutional obligation to allow every candidate access to" political debates that it sponsors. Ante, at669. I do not challenge that decision. The judgment of theCourt of Appeals should nevertheless be affirmed. The official action that led to the exclusion of respondent Forbes523US3 Unit: $U63 [04-28-00 22:27:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN684 ARKANSAS ED. TELEVISION COMM'N v. FORBESStevens, J., dissentingfrom a debate with the two major-party candidates for elec-tion to one of Arkansas' four seats in Congress does not adhere to well-settled constitutional principles. The ad hocdecision of the staff of the Arkansas Educational TelevisionCommission (AETC) raises precisely the concerns addressedby "the many decisions of this Court over the last 30 years,holding that a law subjecting the exercise of First Amendment freedoms to the prior restraint of a license, withoutnarrow, objective, and definite standards to guide the licensing authority, is unconstitutional." Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, 394 U. S. 147, 150-151 (1969).In its discussion of the facts, the Court barely mentionsthe standardless character of the decision to exclude Forbesfrom the debate. In its discussion of the law, the Court understates the constitutional importance of the distinction be-tween state ownership and private ownership of broadcastfacilities. I shall therefore first add a few words about therecord in this case and the history of regulation of the broadcast media, before explaining why I believe the judgmentshould be affirmed.ITwo months before Forbes was officially certified as anindependent candidate qualified to appear on the ballot underArkansas law,1 the AETC staff had already concluded that he"should not be invited" to participate in the televised debatesbecause he was "not a serious candidate as determined bythe voters of Arkansas." 2 He had, however, been a seriouscontender for the Republican nomination for LieutenantGovernor in 1986 and again in 1990. Although he was de-feated in a runoff election, in the three-way primary raceconducted in 1990--just two years before the AETC staffdecision--he had received 46.88% of the statewide vote and1 See Ark.

Nevertheless, thestaff concluded that Forbes did not have "strong popularsupport." Record, Affidavit of Bill Simmons || 5.3Given the fact that the Republican winner in the ThirdCongressional District race in 1992 received only 50.22% ofthe vote and the Democrat received 47.20%,4 it would havebeen necessary for Forbes, who had made a strong showingin recent Republican primaries, to divert only a handful ofvotes from the Republican candidate to cause his defeat.Thus, even though the AETC staff may have correctly con-cluded that Forbes was "not a serious candidate," their decision to exclude him from the debate may have determinedthe outcome of the election in the Third District.If a comparable decision were made today by a privatelyowned network, it would be subject to scrutiny under theFederal Election Campaign Act of 1971 5 unless the net-work used "pre-established objective criteria to determinewhich candidates may participate in [the] debate." 11 CFR$ 110.13(c) (1997). No such criteria governed AETC's refusal to permit Forbes to participate in the debate. Indeed,whether that refusal was based on a judgment about "newsworthiness"--as AETC has argued in this Court--or a judg-ment about "political viability"--as it argued in the Courtof Appeals--the facts in the record presumably would have3 Simmons, a journalist working with the AETC staff on the debates,stated that "[a]t the time this decision [to invite only candidates withstrong popular support] was made . . . , there were no third party ornon-party candidates to evaluate as to the likely extent of their popularsupport." Record, Affidavit of Bill Simmons || 5. Presumably Simmonsmeant that there was no other ballot-qualified candidate, because anAETC staff member, Amy Oliver, represented that there was consideration about whether to invite Forbes before he qualified as a candidate.See text accompanying n. 2, supra.4 See App. 172.5 See 2 U.

FORBESStevens, J., dissentingprovided an adequate basis either for a decision to includeForbes in the Third District debate or a decision to excludehim, and might even have required a cancellation of two ofthe other debates.6The apparent flexibility of AETC's purported standardsuggests the extent to which the staff had nearly limitlessdiscretion to exclude Forbes from the debate based on ad hocjustifications. Thus, the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the staff 's appraisal of "political viability" was"so subjective, so arguable, so susceptible of variation inindividual opinion, as to provide no secure basis for theexercise of governmental power consistent with the FirstAmendment." Forbes v. Arkansas Educational TelevisionCommunication Network Foundation, 93 F. 3d 497, 505(CA8 1996).IIAETC is a state agency whose actions "are fairly attribut-able to the State and subject to the Fourteenth Amendment,unlike the actions of privately owned broadcast licensees."Forbes v.

Similarly, in the Second District, DemocratRay Thornton, the incumbent, defeated Republican Dennis Scott and wonwith 74.2% of the vote. Ibid.

TheCourt implicitly acknowledges these facts by subjecting thedecision to exclude Forbes to constitutional analysis. Yetthe Court seriously underestimates the importance of thedifference between private and public ownership of broad-cast facilities, despite the fact that Congress and this Courthave repeatedly recognized that difference.InColumbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. DemocraticNational Committee, 412 U. S. 94 (1973), the Court held thata licensee is neither a common carrier, id., at 107-109, nor apublic forum that must accommodate " `the right of everyindividual to speak, write, or publish,' " id., at 101 (quotingRed Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367, 388 (1969)).Speaking for a plurality, Chief Justice Burger expressedthe opinion that the First Amendment imposes no con-straint on the private network's journalistic freedom. Hesupported that view by noting that when Congress con-fronted the advent of radio in the 1920's, it "was faced witha fundamental choice between total Government ownershipand control of the new medium--the choice of most othercountries--or some other alternative." 412 U. S., at 116.77 Interestingly, many countries that formerly relied upon state controlof broadcast entities appear to be moving in the direction of deregulation and private ownership of such entities. See, e. g., Bughin & Griekspoor, A New Era for European TV, 3 McKinsey Q. 90, 92-93 (1997)("Most of Western Europe's public television broadcasters began to losetheir grip on the market in the mid-1980s.

The Court noted that Congress hadconsidered and rejected a ban that would have applied onlyto stations operated by state or local governmental entities,and reserved decision on the constitutionality of such a limited ban. See id., at 394, n. 24.TheLeague of Women Voters case implicated the rightof "wholly private stations" to express their own views ona wide range of topics that "have nothing whatever to dowith . . . government." Id., at 395. The case before ustoday involves only the right of a state-owned network toregulate speech that plays a central role in democratic government. Because AETC is owned by the State, deferenceto its interest in making ad hoc decisions about the politicalcontent of its programs necessarily increases the risk of gov-ernment censorship and propaganda in a way that protectionof privately owned broadcasters does not.IIIThe Court recognizes that the debates sponsored byAETC were "by design a forum for political speech by thecandidates." Ante, at 675. The Court also acknowledgesthe central importance of candidate debates in the electoralprocess. See ibid. Thus, there is no need to review ourcases expounding on the public forum doctrine to concludethat the First Amendment will not tolerate a state agency'sarbitrary exclusion from a debate forum based, for example,on an expectation that the speaker might be critical of theGovernor, or might hold unpopular views about abortion orthe death penalty. Indeed, the Court so holds today.1010 The Court correctly rejects the extreme position that the FirstAmendment simply has no application to a candidate's claim that he orshe should be permitted to participate in a televised debate.

TELEVISION COMM'N v. FORBESStevens, J., dissentingIt seems equally clear, however, that the First Amend-ment will not tolerate arbitrary definitions of the scope ofthe forum. We have recognized that "[o]nce it has openeda limited forum, . . . the State must respect the lawfulboundaries it has itself set." Rosenberger v. Rector andVisitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 829 (1995). It fol-lows, of course, that a State's failure to set any meaningfulboundaries at all cannot insulate the State's action fromFirst Amendment challenge. The dispositive issue in thiscase, then, is not whether AETC created a designated publicforum or a nonpublic forum, as the Court concludes, butwhether AETC defined the contours of the debate forumwith sufficient specificity to justify the exclusion of a ballot-qualified candidate.AETC asks that we reject Forbes' constitutional claim onthe basis of entirely subjective, ad hoc judgments about thedimensions of its forum.11 The First Amendment demandsmore, however, when a state government effectively wieldsthe power to eliminate a political candidate from all consid-eration by the voters. All stations must act as editors, seeante, at 673, and when state-owned stations participate inthe broadcasting arena, their editorial decisions may impact the constitutional interests of individual speakers.12 Astate-owned broadcaster need not plan, sponsor, and conductpolitical debates, however. When it chooses to do so, theFirst Amendment imposes important limitations on its control over access to the debate forum.AETC's control was comparable to that of a local government official authorized to issue permits to use publicfacilities for expressive activities.

S. 666 (1998)Stevens, J., dissentingcess to a traditional public forum, we have found an analogybetween the power to issue permits and the censorial powerto impose a prior restraint on speech. Thus, in our reviewof an ordinance requiring a permit to participate in a paradeon city streets, we explained that the ordinance, as written,"fell squarely within the ambit of the many decisions of thisCourt over the last 30 years, holding that a law subjectingthe exercise of First Amendment freedoms to the prior restraint of a license, without narrow, objective, and definitestandards to guide the licensing authority, is unconstitutional." Shuttlesworth, 394 U. S., at 150-151.We recently reaffirmed this approach when consideringthe constitutionality of an assembly and parade ordinancethat authorized a county official to exercise discretion in setting the amount of the permit fee. In Forsyth County v.Nationalist Movement, 505 U. S. 123 (1992), relying on Shuttlesworth and similar cases,13 we described the breadth ofthe administrator's discretion thusly:"There are no articulated standards either in the or-dinance or in the county's established practice. Theadministrator is not required to rely on any objectivefactors. He need not provide any explanation for hisdecision, and that decision is unreviewable. Nothing inthe law or its application prevents the official from encouraging some views and discouraging others throughthe arbitrary application of fees. The First Amendment prohibits the vesting of such unbridled discretionin a government official." 505 U. S., at 133 (footnotesomitted).13 After citing Shuttlesworth, we explained: "The reasoning is simple:If the permit scheme `involves appraisal of facts, the exercise of judgment, and the formation of an opinion,' Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S.296, 305 (1940), by the licensing authority, `the danger of censorship andof abridgment of our precious First Amendment freedoms is too great'to be permitted, Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v.

FORBESStevens, J., dissentingPerhaps the discretion of the AETC staff in controllingaccess to the 1992 candidate debates was not quite as unbridled as that of the Forsyth County administrator. Never-theless, it was surely broad enough to raise the concerns thatcontrolled our decision in that case. No written criteriacabined the discretion of the AETC staff. Their subjectivejudgment about a candidate's "viability" or "newsworthi-ness" allowed them wide latitude either to permit or to exclude a third participant in any debate.14 Moreover, in exercising that judgment they were free to rely on factors thatarguably should favor inclusion as justifications for exclusion.Thus, the fact that Forbes had little financial support wasconsidered as evidence of his lack of viability when that factor might have provided an independent reason for allowinghim to share a free forum with wealthier candidates.15The televised debate forum at issue in this case may notsquarely fit within our public forum analysis,16 but its importance cannot be denied. Given the special character of political speech, particularly during campaigns for elected office,14 It is particularly troubling that AETC excluded the only independent candidate but invited all the major-party candidates to participatein the planned debates, regardless of their chances of electoral success.See n. 6, supra. As this Court has recognized, "political figures outsidethe two major parties have been fertile sources of new ideas and newprograms; many of their challenges to the status quo have in time madetheir way into the political mainstream." Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460U. S. 780, 794 (1983) (citing Illinois Bd. of Elections v. Socialist WorkersParty, 440 U. S. 173, 186 (1979)).15 Lack of substantial financial support apparently was not a factor inthe decision to invite a major-party candidate with even less financial support than Forbes. See n. 6, supra.16 Indeed, a plurality of the Court recently has expressed reluctanceabout applying public forum analysis to new and changing contexts. SeeDenver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518U. S. 727, 741, 749 (1996) (plurality opinion) ("[I]t is not at all clear thatthe public forum doctrine should be imported wholesale into the areaof common carriage regulation").523US3 Unit: $U63 [04-28-00 22:27:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN693Cite as: 523 U. S. 666 (1998)Stevens, J., dissentingthe debate forum implicates constitutional concerns of thehighest order, as the majority acknowledges. Ante, at 675.Indeed, the planning and management of political debates bystate-owned broadcasters raise serious constitutional concerns that are seldom replicated when state-owned televisionnetworks engage in other types of programming.17 We haverecognized that "speech concerning public affairs is . . . theessence of self-government."Garrison v. Louisiana, 379U. S. 64, 74-75 (1964). The First Amendment therefore "hasits fullest and most urgent application precisely to the con-duct of campaigns for political office."Monitor Patriot Co.v. Roy, 401 U. S. 265, 272 (1971). Surely the Constitutiondemands at least as much from the government when it takesaction that necessarily impacts democratic elections as whenlocal officials issue parade permits.The reasons that support the need for narrow, objective,and definite standards to guide licensing decisions applydirectly to the wholly subjective access decisions made bythe staff of AETC.18 The importance of avoiding arbitrary17 The Court observes that "in most cases, the First Amendment of itsown force does not compel public broadcasters to allow third parties accessto their programming." Ante, at 675. A rule, such as the one promulgated by the Federal Election Commission, that requires the use of preestablished, objective criteria to identify the candidates who may participate leaves all other programming decisions unaffected. This is not tosay that all other programming decisions made by state-owned televisionnetworks are immune from attack on constitutional grounds. As longas the State is not itself a "speaker," its decisions, like employment decisions by state agencies and unlike decisions by private actors, must respect the commands of the First Amendment. It is decades of settledjurisprudence that require judicial review of state action that is challenged on First Amendment grounds. See, e. g., Widmar v. Vincent,454 U. S. 263 (1981); Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,515 U. S. 819 (1995).18 Ironically, it is the standardless character of the decision to excludeForbes that provides the basis for the Court's conclusion that the debateswere a nonpublic forum rather than a limited public forum. The Court523US3 Unit: $U63 [04-28-00 22:27:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN694 ARKANSAS ED. TELEVISION COMM'N v. FORBESStevens, J., dissentingor viewpoint-based exclusions from political debates mili-tates strongly in favor of requiring the controlling stateagency to use (and adhere to) preestablished, objective crite-ria to determine who among qualified candidates may participate. When the demand for speaking facilities exceeds sup-ply, the State must "ration or allocate the scarce resourceson some acceptable neutral principle." Rosenberger, 515U. S., at 835. A constitutional duty to use objective standards--i. e., "neutral principles"--for determining whether andwhen to adjust a debate format would impose only a modestrequirement that would fall far short of a duty to grant everymultiple-party request.19 Such standards would also havethe benefit of providing the public with some assurance thatstate-owned broadcasters cannot select debate participantson arbitrary grounds.20Like the Court, I do not endorse the view of the Courtof Appeals that all candidates who qualify for a position onthe ballot are necessarily entitled to access to any statesponsored debate. I am convinced, however, that the con-stitutional imperatives that motivated our decisions in caseslike Shuttlesworth command that access to political debatesexplains that "[a] designated public forum is not created when the government allows selective access for individual speakers rather than general access for a class of speakers." Ante, at 679. If, as AETC claims, itdid invite either the entire class of "viable" candidates, or the entire classof "newsworthy" candidates, under the Court's reasoning, it created adesignated public forum.19 The Court expresses concern that as a direct result of the Court ofAppeals' holding that all ballot-qualified candidates have a right to participate in every debate, a state-owned network canceled a 1996 Nebraskadebate. Ante, at 681. If the Nebraska station had realized that it couldhave satisfied its First Amendment obligations simply by setting out participation standards before the debate, however, it seems quite unlikelythat it would have chosen instead to cancel the debate.20 The fact that AETC and other state-owned networks have adoptedpolicy statements emphasizing the importance of shielding programmingdecisions from political influence, see ante, at 670, confirms the significanceof the risk that would be minimized by the adoption of objective criteria.523US3 Unit: $U63 [04-28-00 22:27:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN695Cite as: 523 U.

Requiring governmentemployees to set out objective criteria by which they choosewhich candidates will benefit from the significant media exposure that results from state-sponsored political debateswould alleviate some of the risk inherent in allowing government agencies--rather than private entities--to stage candi-date debates.Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Courtof Appeals.523US3 Unit: $U64 [04-28-00 22:28:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN696 OCTOBER TERM, 1997SyllabusMONTANA et al. v. CROW TRIBE OF INDIANS et al.certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuitNo. 96-1829. Argued February 24, 1998--Decided May 18, 1998In 1904, the Crow Tribe ceded part of its Montana Reservation to theUnited States for settlement by non-Indians. The United States holdsrights to minerals underlying the ceded strip in trust for the Tribe. In1972, with the approval of the Department of the Interior and pursuantto the Indian Mineral Leasing Act of 1938 (IMLA), Westmoreland Resources, Inc., a non-Indian company, entered into a mining lease with theTribe for coal underlying the ceded strip. After executing the lease,Westmoreland signed contracts with its customers, four utility companies, allowing it to pass on to the utilities the cost of valid taxes. Westmoreland and the Tribe renegotiated the lease in 1974. The amendedlease had an extendable ten-year term, and set some of the highest royalties in the United States. In 1975, Montana imposed a severance taxand a gross proceeds tax on all coal produced in the State, includingcoal underlying the reservation proper and the ceded strip. Westmoreland paid these taxes without timely pursuit of the procedures Montanalaw provides for protests and refunds. Some six months after the Stateimposed its taxes, the Crow Tribal Council adopted its own severancetax. The Department of the Interior approved the Tribe's tax as applied to coal underlying the reservation proper but, because of a limitation in the Tribe's constitution, did not approve as to coal beneath theceded strip. The Tribe again enacted a tax for coal mined on the cededstrip in 1982, and again the Department rejected the tax.In 1978, the Tribe brought a federal action for injunctive and declaratory relief against Montana and its counties, alleging that the State'sseverance and gross proceeds taxes were preempted by the IMLA andinfringed on the Tribe's right to govern itself. The District Court dismissed the complaint. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that theTribe's allegations, if proved, would establish that the IMLA preemptedthe State's taxes. The Court of Appeals noted, however, that the Tribehad paid none of Westmoreland's taxes and apparently would not beentitled to any refund in the event that the taxes were declared invalid.Crow Tribe v. Montana, 650 F. 2d 1104, 1113, n. 13 (Crow I). In 1982,the Tribe and Westmoreland entered into an agreement, with InteriorDepartment approval, under which Westmoreland agreed to pay theTribe a tax equal to the State's then-existing taxes, less any tax pay523US3 Unit: $U64 [04-28-00 22:28:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN697Cite as: 523 U. S. 696 (1998)Syllabusments Westmoreland was required to pay to the State and its subdivisions. The agreement achieved, prospectively, the federal permissionthe Tribe had long sought. It allowed the Tribe to have an approvedtax in place so that, if successful in the litigation against Montana, theTribe could claim for itself any tax amounts Westmoreland would beordered to pay into the District Court's registry pendente lite. It alsoenabled Westmoreland to avoid double taxation, and absolved the company from any tax payment obligation to the Tribe for the 1976-1982period. In 1983, the District Court granted a motion by the Tribe andWestmoreland to deposit severance tax payments into the DistrictCourt's registry, pending resolution of the controversy over Montana'staxing authority. In 1987, the court granted the same interim relief forthe gross proceeds taxes. Later that year, the United States intervened on behalf of the Tribe to protect its interests as trustee of thecoal upon which Montana's taxes were levied. After trial, the DistrictCourt determined that federal law did not preempt the State's taxeson coal mined at the ceded strip. The Ninth Circuit again reversed,concluding that the taxes were both preempted by the IMLA and voidfor interfering with tribal self-governance. Crow Tribe v. Montana,819 F. 2d 895, 903 (Crow II). The Court of Appeals stressed, interalia, that the State's taxes had at least some negative impact on themarketability of the Tribe's coal. Id., at 900. This Court summarilyaffirmed. When the case returned to the District Court in 1988, thecourt ordered distribution of the funds in its registry to the UnitedStates as trustee for the Tribe. Subsequently, the United States andthe Tribe filed amended complaints against Montana and Big HornCounty to recover taxes paid by Westmoreland prior to the 1983 and1987 orders directing deposits into the court's registry. Neither theTribe nor the United States requested, as additional or alternate relief,recovery for the Tribe's actual financial losses attributable to theState's taxes.After trial, the District Court concluded that the disgorgement remedy sought by the Tribe was not appropriate. Key to the court's decision was this Court's holding in Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico,490 U. S. 163, that both State and Tribe may impose severance taxes onon-reservation oil and gas production by a non-Indian lessee. CottonPetroleum indicated that Montana's taxes on ceded strip coal were invalidated in Crow II not because the State lacked power to tax the coalat all, but because its taxes were "extraordinarily high." 490 U. S., at186-187, n. 17. The District Court also considered that Westmorelandwould not have paid coal taxes to the Tribe before 1983, for InteriorDepartment approval was essential to allow pass-through to the company's customers. Furthermore, under the 1982 lease agreement, the523US3 Unit: $U64 [04-28-00 22:28:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN698 MONTANA v. CROW TRIBESyllabusTribe and Westmoreland stipulated that Westmoreland would have notax liability to the Tribe for the 1976-1982 period. Moreover, the deposited funds, Westmoreland's post-1982 tax payments, had been turnedover in full to the United States for the benefit of the Tribe. The courtfurther noted that Westmoreland did not timely endeavor to recovertaxes paid to the State and counties, and the Tribe did nothing toprompt Westmoreland to initiate appropriate refund proceedings. Thecourt received additional evidence concerning the effect of Montana'staxes on the marketability of Montana coal and described the parties'conflicting positions on that issue, but made no findings on the matter.The Ninth Circuit again reversed, holding that the District Court hadignored the law of the case and abused its discretion.Held: The restitution sought for the Tribe is not warranted.Pp. 713-719.(a) As a rule, a nontaxpayer may not sue for a refund of taxes paidby another. The Ninth Circuit evidently had that rule in mind when itnoted, in Crow I, that the Tribe was apparently not entitled to anyrefund of taxes Westmoreland had paid to Montana. The Tribe maintains, however, that the disgorgement remedy it gained does not fallwithin the "refund" category. The Tribe's disgorgement claim must beexamined in light of this Court's pathmarking decision in Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490 U. S. 163. There, the Court clarifiedthat neither the IMLA, nor any other federal law, categorically preempts state nondiscriminatory severance taxes on all extraction enterprises in a State, including on-reservation operations. Both State andTribe have taxing jurisdiction over on-reservation production. TheCourt in Cotton Petroleum distinguished Crow II in a footnote, indicating that Montana had the power to tax Crow coal, but not at an exorbitant rate. Pp. 713-715.(b) The Tribe first argues that it, not Montana, should have receivedWestmoreland's 1975-1982 coal tax payments; therefore the proper remedy is to require the State to turn all taxes it collected from Westmoreland over to the Tribe. However, as Cotton Petroleum makes plain,neither the State nor the Tribe enjoys authority to tax to the totalexclusion of the other. This situation differs from cases like ValleyCounty v. Thomas, 109 Mont. 345, 97 P. 2d 345, in which only one jurisdiction could tax a particular activity. Moreover, the Tribe could nothave taxed Westmoreland during the period in question, for the InteriorDepartment had withheld the essential permission, further distancingthis case from Valley County. The District Court correctly took theseand other factors into account in holding disgorgement an exorbitant,and therefore inequitable, remedy.

S. 696 (1998)Syllabus(c) The Tribe and the United States urge the negative impact of Montana's high taxes on the marketability of the Tribe's coal as an alternative justification for requiring Montana to disgorge the taxes collectedfrom Westmoreland. This claim rests on the concern that, by taxingthe coal actually mined and sold, Montana deprived the Tribe of its fairshare of the economic rent. Again, however, the Tribe could not haveexacted a tax from Westmoreland before 1983, because the Interior Department withheld approval. And no evidence suggests that Westmoreland would have agreed to pay even higher royalties to the Tribe in1974, but for Montana's tax. It merits emphasis also that under CottonPetroleum, Montana could have imposed a severance tax, albeit not oneso extraordinarily high. The District Court did not consider awardingthe Tribe, in lieu of all the 1975-1982 taxes Montana collected, damagesbased on actual losses the Tribe suffered. This was not an oversight.The complaint contained no prayer for compensatory damages. Nor didthe proof establish entitlement to such relief. The Tribe concentratedon disgorgement as the desired remedy; it deliberately sought andproved no damages attributable to coal not sold because the State's taxmade the price too high. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(c) therefore could not aid the Tribe, for the Tribe had not shown entitlement toactual damages. While not foreclosing the District Court from anycourse the Federal Rules and that court's thorough grasp on this litigation may lead it to take, this Court is satisfied that the Court of Appealsimproperly overturned the District Court's judgment.

Having succeeded in that endeavor, the Tribeand the United States now seek to recover coal-related taxesonce paid to the State and counties by Westmoreland Resources, Inc., a nontribal enterprise that mined coal under alease from the Tribe. We hold that the restitution soughtfor the Tribe is not warranted.IAJust north of the northern surface boundary of the CrowReservation in Montana lies the "ceded strip," approximately 1,137,500 acres of land that was originally part of thereservation.

Surface interests in the ceded stripwere thereafter conveyed to non-Indians, but the UnitedStates holds rights to minerals underlying the strip in trustfor the Tribe. Since 1904, the State and the Counties of BigHorn, Treasure, and Yellowstone have exercised full legalauthority and responsibility for public services on the cededstrip, and the Tribe has not exercised civil jurisdiction overthis area.

Code Ann. $$ 15-23-701 to 15-23-704, 15-35-101to 15-35-111 (1979). The severance tax rate applicable tothe ceded strip coal was 30 percent of the contract sales priceof the coal extracted;2 the gross proceeds tax rate was approximately 5 percent of the contract sales price. Duringthe relevant periods,3 Westmoreland paid approximately$46.8 million in severance taxes to the State and $11.4 millionin gross proceeds taxes to Big Horn County.4 Westmorelandpaid these taxes without timely pursuit of the proceduresMontana law provides for protests and refunds.

Id., at 153; see alsoid., at 217-218, 329.6 In 1982, the Tribe again enacted a taxfor coal mined on the ceded strip, and again the Departmentrejected the tax. See Crow Tribe v. Montana, 819 F. 2d895, 897 (CA9 1987). According to the Superintendent ofthe Crow Agency, Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Departmentcontinued to withhold permission for extension of the Tribe'stax to the ceded area because the Tribe's constitution "disclaimed jurisdiction outside the boundaries of the reservation."

CROW TRIBEOpinion of the Courtnot petition for court review of the Department's refusal toapprove extension of the Tribe's tax to the ceded strip.BThe Tribe brought a federal action against Montana andMontana counties in 1978, seeking declaratory and injunctiverelief against imposition of the State's severance and grossproceed taxes on coal belonging to the Tribe. The State'staxes, the Tribe alleged, were preempted by the IMLA andinfringed on the Tribe's right to govern itself. The DistrictCourt dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claimupon which relief could be granted.Crow Tribe v. Mon-tana, 469 F. Supp. 154 (Mont. 1979). The Court of Appealsfor the Ninth Circuit reversed. 650 F. 2d 1104 (1981),amended, 665 F. 2d 1390 (1982) (Crow I). It held that theTribe's allegations, if proved, would establish that the IMLApreempted Montana's taxes, 650 F. 2d, at 1113-1115, and thatthe taxes impermissibly infringed upon the Tribe's sover-eignty,id., at 1115-1117.While the Ninth Circuit trained on the nonmonetary claimthe Tribe was then pursuing, one for declaratory and injunc-tive relief to stop the imposition of Montana's taxes, theCourt of Appeals noted: "As to the taxes already paid byWestmoreland . . . it is true that the Tribe has not paid anyof the taxes and is apparently not entitled to any refund ifthe tax statutes are declared invalid."Id., at 1113, n. 13.The Ninth Circuit further observed that the Tribe's own attempt "to tax its lessees' coal production was partially frus-trated by the Secretary of the Interior's refusal to sanctionthe Tribe's tax ordinances insofar as they applied to coal pro-duction on the ceded strip."Id., at 1115, n. 19.In July 1982, after theCrow I decision, the Tribe andWestmoreland entered into an amended lease agreement, ap-proved by the Interior Department that September. Underthe amended arrangement, Westmoreland agreed to pay the523US3 Unit: $U64 [04-28-00 22:28:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN705Cite as: 523 U. S. 696 (1998)Opinion of the CourtTribe a tax equal to the State's then-existing taxes, less anytax payments Westmoreland was required to make to theState and its subdivisions. See App. 135-141; see also id., at329-330. The 1982 agreement achieved, prospectively, thefederal permission the Tribe had long sought. It allowedthe Tribe to have an approved tax in place so that, if successful in the litigation against Montana, the Tribe could claimfor itself any tax amounts Westmoreland might be orderedto pay into the District Court's registry pendente lite. Correspondingly, the agreement enabled Westmoreland to avoiddouble taxation, present and future, and it absolved the company from any tax payment obligation to the Tribe for the1976-1982 period. App. to Pet. for Cert. 32-35.In November 1982, in keeping with their amended leaseagreement, the Tribe and Westmoreland jointly filed a motion to deposit severance tax payments into the DistrictCourt's registry, pending resolution of the controversy overMontana's authority to tax coal mined at the ceded strip.Id., at 32. In January 1983, the District Court granted themotion. Thereafter, Westmoreland paid the Montana severance tax into the court's registry in lieu of paying the State.The District Court granted the same interim relief, in November 1987, for the gross proceeds tax. Id., at 35, 36. Inordering the registry deposits, which ultimately would bepaid over, with interest, to the prevailing party (Montana orthe Tribe), the District Court recalled the Ninth Circuit'sobservation that "the Tribe is apparently not entitled to anyrefund of taxes previously paid by Westmoreland to Montana." App. 213 (citing Crow I, 650 F. 2d, at 1113, n. 13).The provisional remedy attended to that concern; it "preserve[d the District Court's] power . . . [to give post-1982]tax moneys to their rightful owner after a trial on the merits." App. 215.In June 1983, the United States intervened on behalf ofthe Tribe to protect its interests as trustee of the coal upon523US3 Unit: $U64 [04-28-00 22:28:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN706 MONTANA v. CROW TRIBEOpinion of the Courtwhich Montana's taxes were levied. Trial took place in January 1984, after which the District Court concluded that federal law did not preempt the State's taxes on coal underlyingthe ceded strip. Crow Tribe v. United States, 657 F. Supp.573 (Mont. 1985). The Ninth Circuit again reversed. CrowTribe v. Montana, 819 F. 2d 895 (1987) (Crow II). Montana'staxes, as applied to the ceded strip coal, the Court of Appealsheld, were both "preempted by federal law and policies," asreflected in the IMLA, and "void for interfering with tribalself-government." Id., at 903. Explaining its decision, theNinth Circuit stressed these considerations: The Tribe had avital interest in the development of its coal resources, id., at899, 901; the State's taxes had "at least some negative impacton the . . . marketability [of the Tribe's coal]," id., at 900;Montana's coal tax exactions were not "narrowly tailored"to serve only the State's "legitimate" interests, id., at 902.Montana appealed, and this Court summarily affirmed. 484U. S. 997 (1988).When the case returned to the District Court in 1988, theTribe sought an order directing release of the funds held inthe court's registry. Montana did not object but, in a newtwist, Westmoreland did. The company, for the first time inthis protracted litigation, asserted that neither Montana northe Tribe qualified for receipt of the funds. Montana wasout because the Ninth Circuit had declared the State's taxespreempted. The Tribe, according to Westmoreland, did nothave a valid tax law in place even in the years following1982--the fund deposit period--for want of proper InteriorDepartment approval. Therefore, Westmoreland urged, thecompany should receive back all deposited funds.Rejecting Westmoreland's novel claim of entitlement tothe deposited funds, the District Court observed that theNinth Circuit, in Crow I, 650 F. 2d, at 1117, and Crow II, 819F. 2d, at 898, had characterized the minerals underlying theceded strip as a " `component of the Reservation land itself.'

It follows, the District Court next said, that thetax approved for the reservation proper in 1977, see supra,at 703, covered the strip as well, and the Interior Depart-ment had erred in ever opining otherwise, App. 286. As toWestmoreland's operations on the strip, the District Courtfurther stated, the Crow tax had been modified by the 1982agreement amending the lease. Id., at 287; see supra, at704-705.

Shortlythereafter, the District Court ordered distribution of fundsin its registry to the United States, as trustee for the Tribe.App. 288-291.Having secured exclusively for the Tribe's benefit Westmoreland's post-1982 tax payments once held in the DistrictCourt's registry, the United States and the Tribe commencedthe fray now before us. Filing amended complaints againstMontana and Big Horn County, they invoked theories of assumpsit and constructive trust in support of prayers to re-cover some $58.2 million in state and county taxes paid byWestmoreland prior to the 1983 and 1987 orders directingdeposits into the court's registry. App. to Pet. for Cert.243-260. These complaints alleged that, because the Stateand Big Horn County had collected taxes from Westmorelandin violation of federal law, it would be unjust and inequitableto allow them to retain the funds. In "equity and good conscience," the United States and the Tribe urged, Montanashould pay over for the benefit of the Tribe all moneys illegally collected, together with interest thereon. See id., at249-250, 258-259.7 Neither the Tribe nor the United Statesrequested, as additional or alternate relief, recovery for the7 Specifically, the amended complaints sought all moneys paid as severance taxes from 1975 through 1983, and as gross proceeds taxes from 1975through 1988, together with prejudgment interest.

Montana, 969 F. 2d 848 (Crow III).In dismissing the appeal, the Ninth Circuit commented thatthe "sole issue" presented was whether the Tribe and theUnited States, although they did not pay the Montana taxes,were nevertheless positioned to state a claim for relief inassumpsit and constructive trust. That issue, the Ninth8 An earlier amended complaint filed in November 1982, a year afterCrow I, sought in addition to the declaratory and injunctive relief originally requested, "restitutionary, tax refunds, money damages, and otherrelief," including "punitive or exemplary damages." App. 143, 158. Thecurrent complaints seek restitution, but do not refer to "refunds" or"money damages."In 1993, the Tribe sought once again to amend its complaint, inter alia,to recover from Westmoreland taxes allegedly due under the Tribe's coaltax ordinance for the period 1976-1982. In a July 1993 order, the DistrictCourt denied leave to amend, observing: "This case is now more thanfifteen years old"; "defendants have allowed . . . previous motions to amendthe complaint to be granted without objection"; "[t]his motion, however,contains additional causes of action . . . [which] could change the nature ofthe litigation." Record, Doc. No. 637, p. 4.

" 969F. 2d, at 848-849 (quotingCrow II, 819 F. 2d, at 903).CThe District Court conducted a trial in April and May 1994to determine whether coal taxes paid by Westmoreland toMontana and its counties in the years 1975-1982 unjustlyenriched the State and its subdivisions at the expense ofthe Tribe. In detailed findings and conclusions, that courtexplained why, in its judgment, the disgorgement remedysought by the Tribe was not appropriate. App. to Pet. forCert. 17-38, 42-54.The Tribe's case rested on three principal points: first, thefact, settled in Crow I, that the coal underlying the cededstrip was a mineral resource of the Tribe; second, the federalpolicy favoring tribal self-government and economic development; finally, the Ninth Circuit's preemption decision. Criti-cal to the preemption decision, the District Court recognized,was the Court of Appeals' determination that "Montana'scoal taxes burdened the Tribe's economic interests by increasing the costs of production by coal producers, whichreduced royalties received by the Tribe." App. to Pet. forCert. 45 (citing Crow II, 819 F. 2d, at 899).Counterbalancing the Tribe's case, the District Court observed first that the State and its subdivisions, not the Tribe,provided "[p]ublic services to residents and businesses on the[c]eded [s]trip, many of which facilitate the mining of coal."App. to Pet. for Cert. 47; see supra, at 701, 703, n. 5. Key tothe District Court's reasoning, however, was the respectivetaxing authority of State and Tribe.In a decision rendered two years after the Ninth Circuit'sCrow II preemption decision, this Court held that both State523US3 Unit: $U64 [04-28-00 22:28:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN710 MONTANA v. CROW TRIBEOpinion of the Courtand Tribe may impose severance taxes on on-reservation oiland gas production by a non-Indian lessee. Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490 U. S. 163 (1989). Cotton Petroleum indicated that Montana's taxes on ceded strip coalwere invalidated, not because the State lacked power to taxthe coal at all, but because the taxes at issue were "extraordinarily high." Id., at 186-187, n. 17.The Tribe's exercise of taxing authority, on the other hand,required approval from the Secretary of the Interior, andthat approval had not been obtained in the relevant period,1975-1982. See supra, at 703-704. In 1988, the DistrictCourt had determined that the Interior Department's refusalto approve the Tribe's tax on the ceded strip was an error,see supra, at 707, but the presence of the state taxes did notcause that error. App. to Pet. for Cert. 36. Rather, theDepartment initially questioned the Tribe's authority to taxon the ceded strip and later pointed to the Tribe's noncompliance with the proper procedures for amending its constitution to impose the tax.

Westmoreland's presi-dent testified that "he could not identify any utility contractslost during the relevant time period due to Montana's coaltaxes," App. to Pet. for Cert. 29, and the parties' economicexperts presented conflicting testimony on the impact ofMontana's taxes on the sale of Montana coal.

CROW TRIBEOpinion of the CourtThe Ninth Circuit again reversed the District Court'sjudgment; in a per curiam opinion, the Court of Appealsread its prior opinions to require the relief the Tribedemanded, i. e., an order directing the State and county todisgorge approximately $58.2 million in coal taxes paid byWestmoreland to Montana and its subdivisions before Westmoreland began making payments into the District Court'sregistry. 92 F. 3d 826, amended, 98 F. 3d 1194 (1996)(Crow IV). Acknowledging "the absence of traditional re-quirements for relief under theories of assumpsit or constructive trust," 92 F. 3d, at 828, the Court of Appealsremanded for entry of the disgorgement order. That courtleft to the District Court only the "unresolved request[s]for prejudgment interest [and attorney's fees]." Id., at830-831.In the Ninth Circuit's view, the District Court had not adhered to the "law of this case," id., at 828,11 and had thereforeabused its discretion, id., at 830. In particular, the Court ofAppeals faulted the District Court for giving undue weightto the fact that Westmoreland rather than the Tribe had paidthe taxes, id., at 828-829,12 and to the fact, made plain bythis Court in Cotton Petroleum, 490 U. S., at 176-187, that"similar [state] taxes are not always preempted," Crow IV,92 F. 3d, at 829. Further, the Ninth Circuit discounted thepublic services Montana provided at the ceded strip because"the State would have provided such services even if theid., at 54-57, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed that disposition. 92 F. 3d826, 830-831, amended, 98 F. 3d 1194 (1996). We denied the Tribe's crosspetition for review of the final judgment disposing of the Shell Oil claim.522 U. S. 819 (1997).11 The Court of Appeals repeatedly referred to "law of the case" madein Crow III, see 92 F. 3d, at 828, and n. 2, 829, a decision denying interlocutory review and therefore containing no "holding," see supra, at 708-709.12 But cf. Crow I, 650 F. 2d, at 1110 ("incidence of [Montana's] taxes ison the non-Indian mineral lessee"); id., at 1113, n. 13 ("[a]s to the taxesalready paid by Westmoreland, . . . [the Tribe] is apparently not entitledto any refund").523US3 Unit: $U64 [04-28-00 22:28:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN713Cite as: 523 U. S. 696 (1998)Opinion of the CourtTribal coal had not been mined." Ibid. Finally, the Courtof Appeals attributed to the District Court a finding thatWestmoreland "would have paid the tribal tax even without[the Interior Department's] approval because [Westmoreland] agreed to do so in its 1982 lease." Id., at 830; see alsoibid. ("Westmoreland was willing to pay coal taxes to theTribe as early as 1976, so there was no reason for the [District Court] to distinguish between the taxes collected beforeand after 1982.").13We granted certiorari, 522 U. S. 912 (1997), and now re-verse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.IIAThe petition for certiorari presents the question whetherthe Tribe--or the United States as its trustee--may recoverstate and county taxes imposed on and paid by the Tribe'smineral lessee, Westmoreland, a party who has forfeited entitlement to a tax refund. Taxpayer Westmoreland, it is un-disputed, did not qualify for a refund because the companyfailed to pursue protest and claim procedures within the timeMontana law prescribes. Further, Westmoreland enteredinto a settlement with the State and the county relinquishingany claim it might have had for return of the tax paymentsin question. See supra, at 702.As a rule, a nontaxpayer may not sue for a refund of taxespaid by another. See, e. g., Furman Univ. v. Livingston, 136S. E. 2d 254, 256, 244 S. C. 200, 204 (1964);Krauss Co. v.Develle, 236 La. 1072, 1077, 110 So. 2d 104, 106 (1959); Kesbec,Inc. v. McGoldrick, 278 N. Y. 293, 297, 16 N. E. 2d 288, 290(1938); cf.United States v. California, 507 U. S. 746, 752(1993). The Ninth Circuit evidently had that rule in mind13 But cf. App. to Pet. for Cert. 35 (District Court found that during the1975 through 1982 period Westmoreland "would not have paid coal taxesto the Tribe as no Department of Interior approval had been obtained toallow a pass-through to its customers").523US3 Unit: $U64 [04-28-00 22:28:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN714 MONTANA v. CROW TRIBEOpinion of the Courtwhen it noted, in Crow I, that the Tribe "is apparently notentitled to any refund" of taxes Westmoreland had paid toMontana. 650 F. 2d, at 1113, n. 13.The Tribe now maintains, however, that the disgorgementremedy approved by the Ninth Circuit does not fall withinthe "refund" category. The Tribe suggests two ways of analyzing its claim. First, Westmoreland was liable for tax pay-ments, but it paid the wrong sovereign; the Tribe, not theState, should have been the recipient of those payments.Second, the State's taxes adversely affected the Tribe's economy by reducing the demand for the Tribe's coal and theroyalties the Tribe could charge; a remedial order transferring Westmoreland's 1975-1982 tax payments from Montanato the Tribe would eliminate the enrichment unjustly gainedby the State at the Tribe's expense.Before inspecting the Tribe's justifications for the disgorgement ordered by the Court of Appeals, we place inclear view a pathmarking decision this Court rendered lessthan two years after our summary affirmance in Crow II.14In Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490 U. S. 163(1989), we held that the IMLA did not preempt New Mexico'snondiscriminatory severance taxes on the production of oiland gas on the Jicarilla Apache Reservation by Cotton Pe-troleum, a non-Indian lessee. Id., at 186-187. In so holding, we acknowledged that the same on-reservation produc-tion of oil and gas was subject to tribal severance taxes,id.,at 167-169, and that New Mexico's taxes might reducedemand for on-reservation leases, id., at 186-187. CottonPetroleum clarified that neither the IMLA, nor any otherfederal law, categorically preempts state mineral severancetaxes imposed, without discrimination, on all extraction enterprises in the State, including on-reservation operations."Unless and until Congress provides otherwise, each of the14 "A summary disposition affirms only the judgment of the court below,and no more may be read into our action than was essential to sustainthat judgment." Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 785, n. 5 (1983).523US3 Unit: $U64 [04-28-00 22:28:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN715Cite as: 523 U. S. 696 (1998)Opinion of the Court. . . two sovereigns[--State and Tribe--]has taxing jurisdic-tion over all [on-reservation production]." Id., at 189.The Court in Cotton Petroleum distinguished Crow II ina footnote referring to the Solicitor General's representationthat Montana's taxes were "extraordinarily high" and theNinth Circuit's recognition that "the state taxes had a negative effect on the marketability of coal produced in Mon-tana." 490 U. S., at 186-187, n. 17. Montana,Cotton Petro-leum thus indicates, had the power to tax Crow coal, but notat an exorbitant rate. See id., at 187, n. 17 (according to theTribe's expert, Montana's rate was " `more than twice that ofany other state's coal taxes' ").15 We examine the Tribe'sdisgorgement claim in light of Cotton Petroleum, a decisionon the books before the Tribe (and the United States) filedtheir current claims for restitution.BWe consider first the argument that the Tribe, not Mon-tana, should have received Westmoreland's 1975-1982 coaltax payments; therefore the proper remedy is to require theState to turn all taxes it collected from Westmoreland overto the Tribe. As authority, the Tribe and the United Statesrely on cases typified byValley County v. Thomas, 109 Mont.345, 97 P. 2d 345 (1939). That case involved a Montana lawproviding for the licensing of motor vehicles by the countyin which the vehicle is owned and taxable. Valley Countyclaimed that McCone County was unlawfully issuing licenses,and collecting license fees, for vehicles owned and taxablewithin Valley County. Valley sued McCone for both injunc-tive and monetary relief. The Montana Supreme Court heldthat if Montana's vehicle licensing law made Valley, not Mc-Cone, the county entitled to issue the licenses in question,15 Since 1985, the District Court observed, "the Montana legislature hasenacted production incentive credits and incrementally reduced theamount of the severance tax"; in November 1994, the rate was 15 percentof the contract sales price. App. to Pet. for Cert. 25.523US3 Unit: $U64 [04-28-00 22:28:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN716 MONTANA v. CROW TRIBEOpinion of the Courtthen Valley could recover from McCone the fees McCone improperly collected. It would make scant sense, the courtreasoned, to hold instead that Valley should "exact the . . .license fee anew from the [vehicle] owner, leaving the latterto his remedy, if any, for the illegal exaction." Id., at 385-386, 97 P. 2d, at 366.As the District Court in this case correctly recognized,App. to Pet. for Cert. 49-50, the Valley County pattern isnot the one presented here. There, the Montana licensing statute bound both counties. One, and not the other,was the sole subdivision authorized to issue the license andcollect the fee. Here, as Cotton Petroleum makes plain,neither the State nor the Tribe enjoys authority to tax tothe total exclusion of the other. Moreover, dispositivelydistancing the Tribe's situation from that of the prevailingsubdivision in Valley County, the Tribe itself could not havetaxed lessee Westmoreland during the period in question, forthe Interior Department (whether wrongly or rightly) hadwithheld the essential permission.It bears repetition that the Department did not approvethe Tribe's imposition of a coal tax on ceded strip productionuntil September 1982, see supra, at 705, that the Tribe neversought judicial review of the Department's pre-1982 disapprovals, see supra, at 703-704, that Westmoreland would payno tax to the Tribe absent Department approval, see supra,at 706, 710, 713, n. 13, that Montana's taxes did not impedethe Tribe from gaining the Department's clearance, seesupra, at 710, and that Montana received no share of thepost-1982 tax payments released from the District Court'sregistry, see supra, at 705-707. These were factors theDistrict Court correctly considered significant in holdingdisgorgement an exorbitant, and therefore inequitable,remedy.1616 In view of the evidence diligently canvassed by the District Court,including the Tribe-Westmoreland 1982 agreement that Westmorelandwould have no tax liability to the Tribe for the 1976-1982 period, see523US3 Unit: $U64 [04-28-00 22:28:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN717Cite as: 523 U. S. 696 (1998)Opinion of the CourtCThe negative impact of Montana's high taxes on the mar-ketability of the Tribe's coal, as the District Court correctlycomprehended, was the principal basis for the Ninth Circuit'sCrow II preemption decision. See supra, at 709. TheTribe and the United States urge that impact as an alternative justification for requiring Montana to disgorge taxes col-lected from Westmoreland from 1975 through 1982.At oral argument, counsel for the Tribe clarified that theimpact of concern was not coal that went unsold because theState's tax made the price too high. See Tr. of Oral Arg.37. Instead, the Tribe's disgorgement claim rested on thecoal "actually produced and sold"; by taxing that coal, coun-sel maintained, Montana "deprived [the Tribe] of its fairshare of the economic rent." Ibid.Again, however, the Tribe itself could not have exacteda tax from Westmoreland before 1983, because the InteriorDepartment withheld approval. And the royalty the Tribeand Westmoreland agreed upon in 1974 was both high andlong term, running until June 1982. See supra, at 701-702.No evidence suggests Westmoreland would have paid higherroyalties, but for Montana's tax. It merits emphasis also, asthe District Court recognized, App. to Pet. for Cert. 46, 50,that under ourCotton Petroleum decision, Montana couldhave imposed a severance tax, albeit not one so extraordinarily high. See Cotton Petroleum, 490 U. S., at 186-187(New Mexico's oil and gas severance taxes imposed on onreservation production, amounting to about 8 percent of thevalue of the taxpayer's production, were not preempted byfederal law although the taxes could be expected to have "atleast a marginal effect on the demand for on-reservationsupra, at 705, 710-711, we see no substantial basis for believing that Westmoreland "would have paid the tribal tax even without [the InteriorDepartment's] approval" or that "Westmoreland was willing to pay coaltaxes to the Tribe as early as 1976," six years before the Departmentagreed that the Tribe was positioned to tax coal mined at the ceded strip.Crow IV, 92 F. 3d, at 830.523US3 Unit: $U64 [04-28-00 22:28:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN718 MONTANA v. CROW TRIBEOpinion of the Courtleases, the value to the Tribe of those leases, and the abilityof the Tribe to increase its tax rate").The District Court did not consider awarding the Tribe, inlieu of all the 1975-1982 taxes Montana collected, damagesbased on actual losses the Tribe suffered. We cannot callthis an oversight. The complaint contained no prayer forcompensatory damages. See supra, at 707-708, and nn. 7, 8.Nor did the proof establish entitlement to such relief. Seesupra, at 711.17The only testimony homing in on Westmoreland's salescame from the company's president. He could "identify [no]utility contracts lost during the relevant time period due toMontana's coal taxes." App. to Pet. for Cert. 29. While heacknowledged that some customers "exercise[d] the paymentoption under their contracts rather than continuing to re-ceive coal and that the Montana coal taxes were probably afactor," he identified as other factors "demand, alternativesources, and transportation." Ibid. Indeed, as just noted,see supra this page, the Tribe concentrated on disgorgementas the desired remedy; it deliberately sought "no damages. . . now" for "coal that was not sold because the price wastoo high [due to] the State's tax." Tr. of Oral Arg. 37. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(c), therefore, could not aidthe Tribe. That Rule instructs that "every final judgmentshall grant the relief to which the party in whose favor it isrendered is entitled, even if the party has not demanded suchrelief in the party's pleadings." The Tribe, however, hadnot shown entitlement to actual damages.In sum, the District Court carefully and fairly determinedthat the disgorgement demanded was not warranted andshould not be granted. In so ruling, that court endeavoredto heed both Crow II and Cotton Petroleum, and closely attended to the history of and record in this tangled, long17 The Tribe attempted, unsuccessfully, to show that Montana's hightaxes caused the Tribe to lose its lease with Shell Oil Company.

Proceeding as it did,the District Court ignored no tenable "law of the case" anddid not indulge in an "abuse of discretion." See Crow IV, 92F. 3d, at 829, 830.As a result of the District Court's orders for registry de-posits, seesupra, at 705, the Tribe has displaced Montana tothis extent: With respect to ceded strip mining operations,all severance taxes have gone to the Tribe since January1983, and all gross proceeds taxes since November 1987.Montana's retention of preregistry deposit taxes must be as-sessed in light of the court-ordered distribution of all fundsin the registry to the United States, as trustee for the Tribe.Seesupra, at 707. The District Court, best positioned tomake that assessment, was obliged to do so based on the caseand proof the parties presented. The Tribe and the UnitedStates here argued for total disgorgement. They did notdevelop a case for relief of a different kind or size. Whilewe do not foreclose the District Court from any course theFederal Rules and that court's thorough grasp on this litiga-tion lead it to take, we are satisfied that the Court of Appealsimproperly overturned the District Court's judgment.* * *For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the caseis remanded for further proceedings consistent with thisopinion.
