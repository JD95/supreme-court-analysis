The principal question presented is whether, in the ab-sence of exigent circumstances, the Due Process Clause ofthe Fifth Amendment prohibits the Government in a civilforfeiture case from seizing real property without first affording the owner notice and an opportunity to be heard.We hold that it does.A second issue in the case concerns the timeliness of theforfeiture action. We hold that filing suit for forfeiturewithin the statute of limitations suffices to make the actiontimely, and that the cause should not be dismissed for failureto comply with certain other statutory directives for expedi-tious prosecution in forfeiture cases.IOn January 31, 1985, Hawaii police officers executed asearch warrant at the home of claimant James Daniel Good.The search uncovered about 89 pounds of marijuana, mari-juana seeds, vials containing hashish oil, and drug paraphernalia. About six months later, Good pleaded guilty to pro-moting a harmful drug in the second degree, in violation ofHawaii law. Haw. Rev. Stat. $ 712-1245(1)(b) (1985). Hewas sentenced to one year in jail and five years' probation,and fined $1,000. Good was also required to forfeit to theState $3,187 in cash found on the premises.On August 8, 1989, 41/2 years after the drugs were found,the United States filed an in rem action in the United StatesDistrict Court for the District of Hawaii, seeking to forfeitGood's house and the 4-acre parcel on which it was situated.The United States sought forfeiture under 21 U. S. C.$ 881(a)(7), on the ground that the property had been used tocommit or facilitate the commission of a federal drug offense.11 Title 21 U. S. C. $ 881(a)(7) provides:"(a) . . ."The following shall be subject to forfeiture to the United States andno property right shall exist in them:510us1$$7J 06-18-97 16:43:27 PAGES OPINPGT47Cite as: 510 U. S. 43 (1993)Opinion of the CourtOn August 18, 1989, in an ex parte proceeding, a UnitedStates Magistrate Judge found that the Government had established probable cause to believe Good's property was sub-ject to forfeiture under $ 881(a)(7). A warrant of arrest inrem was issued, authorizing seizure of the property. Thewarrant was based on an affidavit recounting the fact ofGood's conviction and the evidence discovered during theJanuary 1985 search of his home by Hawaii police.The Government seized the property on August 21, 1989,without prior notice to Good or an adversary hearing. Atthe time of the seizure, Good was renting his home to tenantsfor $900 per month. The Government permitted the tenantsto remain on the premises subject to an occupancy agree-ment, but directed the payment of future rents to the UnitedStates Marshal.Good filed a claim for the property and an answer to theGovernment's complaint. He asserted that the seizure de-prived him of his property without due process of law andthat the forfeiture action was invalid because it had not beentimely commenced under the statute. The District Courtgranted the Government's motion for summary judgmentand entered an order forfeiting the property.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed inpart, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings. 971 F. 2d 1376 (1992). The court was unanimous inholding that the seizure of Good's property, without priornotice and a hearing, violated the Due Process Clause.. . . . ."(7) All real property, including any right, title, and interest (includingany leasehold interest) in the whole of any lot or tract of land and anyappurtenances or improvements, which is used, or intended to be used, inany manner or part, to commit, or to facilitate the commission of, a violation of this subchapter punishable by more than one year's imprisonment,except that no property shall be forfeited under this paragraph, to theextent of an interest of an owner, by reason of any act or omission established by that owner to have been committed or omitted without theknowledge or consent of that owner."510us1$$7J 06-18-97 16:43:27 PAGES OPINPGT48 UNITED STATES v. JAMES DANIELGOOD REAL PROPERTYOpinion of the CourtIn a divided decision, the Court of Appeals further heldthat the District Court erred in finding the action timely.The Court of Appeals ruled that the 5-year statute of limitations in 19 U. S. C. $ 1621 is only an "outer limit" for filing aforfeiture action, and that further limits are imposed by 19U. S. C. $$ 1602-1604. 971 F. 2d, at 1378-1382. Those provisions, the court reasoned, impose a "series of internal notification and reporting requirements," under which "customsagents must report to customs officers, customs officers mustreport to the United States attorney, and the Attorney General must `immediately' and `forthwith' bring a forfeitureaction if he believes that one is warranted." Id., at 1379(citations omitted). The Court of Appeals ruled that failureto comply with these internal reporting rules could requiredismissal of the forfeiture action as untimely. The court remanded the case for a determination whether the Government had satisfied its obligation to make prompt reports.Id., at 1382.We granted certiorari, 507 U. S. 983 (1993), to resolve aconflict among the Courts of Appeals on the constitutionalquestion presented. Compare United States v. Premisesand Real Property at 4492 South Livonia Road, 889 F. 2d1258 (CA2 1989), with United States v. A Single Family Residence and Real Property, 803 F. 2d 625 (CA11 1986). Wenow affirm the due process ruling and reverse the ruling onthe timeliness question.IIThe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment guarantees that "[n]o person shall . . . be deprived of life, liberty,or property, without due process of law." Our precedentsestablish the general rule that individuals must receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before the Governmentdeprives them of property. See United States v. $8,850, 461U. S. 555, 562, n. 12 (1983); Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U. S. 67,82 (1972); Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp. of Bay View,510us1$$7J 06-18-97 16:43:27 PAGES OPINPGT49Cite as: 510 U. S. 43 (1993)Opinion of the Court395 U. S. 337, 342 (1969) (Harlan, J., concurring); Mullane v.Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U. S. 306, 313 (1950).The Government does not, and could not, dispute that theseizure of Good's home and 4-acre parcel deprived him ofproperty interests protected by the Due Process Clause.By the Government's own submission, the seizure gave it theright to charge rent, to condition occupancy, and even to evictthe occupants. Instead, the Government argues that it afforded Good all the process the Constitution requires. TheGovernment makes two separate points in this regard.First, it contends that compliance with the Fourth Amend-ment suffices when the Government seizes property for purposes of forfeiture. In the alternative, it argues that theseizure of real property under the drug forfeiture laws justifies an exception to the usual due process requirement ofpreseizure notice and hearing. We turn to these issues.AThe Government argues that because civil forfeitureserves a "law enforcement purpos[e]," Brief for UnitedStates 13, the Government need comply only with the FourthAmendment when seizing forfeitable property. We disagree. The Fourth Amendment does place restrictions onseizures conducted for purposes of civil forfeiture,One 1958Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania, 380 U. S. 693, 696 (1965)(holding that the exclusionary rule applies to civil forfeiture),but it does not follow that the Fourth Amendment is the soleconstitutional provision in question when the Governmentseizes property subject to forfeiture.We have rejected the view that the applicability of oneconstitutional amendment pre-empts the guarantees of another. As explained in Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U. S. 56,70 (1992):"Certain wrongs affect more than a single right and,accordingly, can implicate more than one of the Constitution's commands. Where such multiple violations510us1$$7J 06-18-97 16:43:27 PAGES OPINPGT50 UNITED STATES v. JAMES DANIELGOOD REAL PROPERTYOpinion of the Courtare alleged, we are not in the habit of identifying as apreliminary matter the claim's `dominant' character.Rather, we examine each constitutional provision inturn."Here, as in Soldal, the seizure of property implicates two" `explicit textual source[s] of constitutional protection,' " theFourth Amendment and the Fifth. Ibid. The proper question is not which Amendment controls but whether eitherAmendment is violated.Nevertheless, the Government asserts that when propertyis seized for forfeiture, the Fourth Amendment provides thefull measure of process due under the Fifth. The Government relies on Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103 (1975), andGraham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386 (1989), in support of thisproposition. That reliance is misplaced. Gerstein and Graham concerned not the seizure of property but the arrest ordetention of criminal suspects, subjects we have consideredto be governed by the provisions of the Fourth Amendmentwithout reference to other constitutional guarantees. Inaddition, also unlike the seizure presented by this case, thearrest or detention of a suspect occurs as part of the regularcriminal process, where other safeguards ordinarily ensurecompliance with due process.Gerstein held that the Fourth Amendment, rather than theDue Process Clause, determines the requisite postarrest proceedings when individuals are detained on criminal charges.Exclusive reliance on the Fourth Amendment is appropriatein the arrest context, we explained, because the Amendmentwas "tailored explicitly for the criminal justice system," andits "balance between individual and public interests alwayshas been thought to define the `process that is due' for seizures of person or property in criminal cases." 420 U. S.,at 125, n. 27. Furthermore, we noted that the protectionsafforded during an arrest and initial detention are "only thefirst stage of an elaborate system, unique in jurisprudence,510us1$$7J 06-18-97 16:43:27 PAGES OPINPGT51Cite as: 510 U. S. 43 (1993)Opinion of the Courtdesigned to safeguard the rights of those accused of criminalconduct."Ibid. (emphasis in original).So too, in Graham we held that claims of excessive forcein the course of an arrest or investigatory stop should beevaluated under the Fourth Amendment reasonablenessstandard, not under the "more generalized notion of `sub-stantive due process.' " 490 U. S., at 395. Because thedegree of force used to effect a seizure is one determinantof its reasonableness, and because the Fourth Amendmentguarantees citizens the right "to be secure in their persons. . . against unreasonable . . . seizures," we held that a claimof excessive force in the course of such a seizure is "mostproperly characterized as one invoking the protections of theFourth Amendment." Id., at 394.Neither Gerstein nor Graham, however, provides supportfor the proposition that the Fourth Amendment is the beginning and end of the constitutional inquiry whenever a seizureoccurs. That proposition is inconsistent with the approachwe took in Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., 416U. S. 663 (1974), which examined the constitutionality of exparte seizures of forfeitable property under general principles of due process, rather than the Fourth Amendment.And it is at odds with our reliance on the Due Process Clauseto analyze prejudgment seizure and sequestration of personal property. See, e. g., Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U. S. 67(1972); Mitchell v. W. T. Grant Co., 416 U. S. 600 (1974).It is true, of course, that the Fourth Amendment appliesto searches and seizures in the civil context and may serveto resolve the legality of these governmental actions withoutreference to other constitutional provisions. See Camara v.Municipal Court of City and County of San Francisco, 387U. S. 523 (1967) (holding that a warrant based on probablecause is required for administrative search of residences forsafety inspections); Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives'Assn., 489 U. S. 602 (1989) (holding that federal regulationsauthorizing railroads to conduct blood and urine tests of cer510us1$$7J 06-18-97 16:43:27 PAGES OPINPGT52 UNITED STATES v. JAMES DANIELGOOD REAL PROPERTYOpinion of the Courttain employees, without a warrant and without reasonablesuspicion, do not violate the Fourth Amendment prohibitionagainst unreasonable searches and seizures). But the pur-pose and effect of the Government's action in the presentcase go beyond the traditional meaning of search or seizure.Here the Government seized property not to preserve evidence of wrongdoing, but to assert ownership and controlover the property itself. Our cases establish that government action of this consequence must comply with the DueProcess Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.Though the Fourth Amendment places limits on the Gov-ernment's power to seize property for purposes of forfeiture,it does not provide the sole measure of constitutional protec-tion that must be afforded property owners in forfeiture proceedings. So even assuming that the Fourth Amendmentwere satisfied in this case, it remains for us to determinewhether the seizure complied with our well-settled jurispru-dence under the Due Process Clause.BWhether ex parte seizures of forfeitable property satisfythe Due Process Clause is a question we last confronted inCalero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., supra, whichheld that the Government could seize a yacht subject to civilforfeiture without affording prior notice or hearing. Cen-tral to our analysis inCalero-Toledo was the fact that a yachtwas the "sort [of property] that could be removed to anotherjurisdiction, destroyed, or concealed, if advance warning ofconfiscation were given." Id., at 679. The ease with whichan owner could frustrate the Government's interests in theforfeitable property created a " `special need for very promptaction' " that justified the postponement of notice and hear-ing until after the seizure.Id., at 678 (quoting Fuentes,supra, at 91).We had no occasion in Calero-Toledo to decide whether thesame considerations apply to the forfeiture of real property,510us1$$7J 06-18-97 16:43:27 PAGES OPINPGT53Cite as: 510 U. S. 43 (1993)Opinion of the Courtwhich, by its very nature, can be neither moved nor con-cealed. In fact, whenCalero-Toledo was decided, both thePuerto Rican statute, P. R. Laws Ann., Tit. 24, $ 2512 (Supp.1973), and the federal forfeiture statute upon which it wasmodeled, 21 U. S. C. $ 881 (1970 ed.), authorized the forfeitureof personal property only. It was not until 1984, 10 yearslater, that Congress amended $ 881 to authorize the forfeiture of real property. See 21 U. S. C. $ 881(a)(7); Pub. L. 98-473, $ 306, 98 Stat. 2050.The right to prior notice and a hearing is central to theConstitution's command of due process. "The purpose ofthis requirement is not only to ensure abstract fair play tothe individual. Its purpose, more particularly, is to protecthis use and possession of property from arbitrary encroachment--to minimize substantively unfair or mistaken deprivations of property . . . ." Fuentes, 407 U. S., at 80-81.We tolerate some exceptions to the general rule requiringpredeprivation notice and hearing, but only in " `extraordinary situations where some valid governmental interest isat stake that justifies postponing the hearing until after theevent.' " Id., at 82 (quoting Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U. S.371, 379 (1971)); United States v. $8,850, 461 U. S., at 562,n. 12. Whether the seizure of real property for purposes ofcivil forfeiture justifies such an exception requires an examination of the competing interests at stake, along with thepromptness and adequacy of later proceedings. The threepart inquiry set forth in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319(1976), provides guidance in this regard. The Mathewsanalysis requires us to consider the private interest affectedby the official action; the risk of an erroneous deprivation ofthat interest through the procedures used, as well as theprobable value of additional safeguards; and the Government's interest, including the administrative burden that additional procedural requirements would impose. Id., at 335.Good's right to maintain control over his home, and to befree from governmental interference, is a private interest of510us1$$7J 06-18-97 16:43:27 PAGES OPINPGT54 UNITED STATES v. JAMES DANIELGOOD REAL PROPERTYOpinion of the Courthistoric and continuing importance. Cf. United States v.Karo, 468 U. S. 705, 714-715 (1984); Payton v. New York, 445U. S. 573, 590 (1980). The seizure deprived Good of valuablerights of ownership, including the right of sale, the right ofoccupancy, the right to unrestricted use and enjoyment, andthe right to receive rents. All that the seizure left him, bythe Government's own submission, was the right to bring aclaim for the return of title at some unscheduled futurehearing.In Fuentes, we held that the loss of kitchen appliances andhousehold furniture was significant enough to warrant a predeprivation hearing. 407 U. S., at 70-71. And in Connecticut v. Doehr, 501 U. S. 1 (1991), we held that a state statuteauthorizing prejudgment attachment of real estate withoutprior notice or hearing was unconstitutional, in the absenceof extraordinary circumstances, even though the attachmentdid not interfere with the owner's use or possession anddid not affect, as a general matter, rentals from existingleaseholds.The seizure of a home produces a far greater deprivationthan the loss of furniture, or even attachment. It gives theGovernment not only the right to prohibit sale, but also theright to evict occupants, to modify the property, to conditionoccupancy, to receive rents, and to supersede the owner inall rights pertaining to the use, possession, and enjoymentof the property.The Government makes much of the fact that Good wasrenting his home to tenants, and contends that the tangibleeffect of the seizure was limited to taking the $900 a monthhe was due in rent. But even if this were the only deprivation at issue, it would not render the loss insignificant orunworthy of due process protection. The rent represents asignificant portion of the exploitable economic value ofGood's home. It cannot be classified as de minimis forpurposes of procedural due process. In sum, the private510us1$$7J 06-18-97 16:43:27 PAGES OPINPGT55Cite as: 510 U. S. 43 (1993)Opinion of the Courtinterests at stake in the seizure of real property weigh heav-ily in theMathews balance.The practice of ex parte seizure, moreover, creates an un-acceptable risk of error. Although Congress designed thedrug forfeiture statute to be a powerful instrument in enforcement of the drug laws, it did not intend to deprive inno-cent owners of their property. The affirmative defense ofinnocent ownership is allowed by statute. See 21 U. S. C.$ 881(a)(7) ("[N]o property shall be forfeited under this paragraph, to the extent of an interest of an owner, by reason ofany act or omission established by that owner to have beencommitted or omitted without the knowledge or consent ofthat owner").The ex parte preseizure proceeding affords little or no protection to the innocent owner. In issuing a warrant of seizure, the magistrate judge need determine only that there isprobable cause to believe that the real property was "used,or intended to be used, in any manner or part, to commit, orto facilitate the commission of," a felony narcotics offense.Ibid. The Government is not required to offer any evidenceon the question of innocent ownership or other potential defenses a claimant might have. See, e. g., Austin v. UnitedStates, 509 U. S. 602 (1993) (holding that forfeitures under 21U. S. C. $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) are subject to the limitationsof the Excessive Fines Clause). Nor would that inquiry, inthe ex parte stage, suffice to protect the innocent owner'sinterests. "[F]airness can rarely be obtained by secret,one-sided determination of facts decisive of rights. . . . Nobetter instrument has been devised for arriving at truth thanto give a person in jeopardy of serious loss notice of the caseagainst him and opportunity to meet it." Joint Anti-FascistRefugee Comm. v. McGrath, 341 U. S. 123, 170-172 (1951)(Frankfurter, J., concurring) (footnotes omitted).The purpose of an adversary hearing is to ensure the requisite neutrality that must inform all governmental decisionmaking. That protection is of particular importance here,510us1$$7J 06-18-97 16:43:27 PAGES OPINPGT56 UNITED STATES v. JAMES DANIELGOOD REAL PROPERTYOpinion of the Courtwhere the Government has a direct pecuniary interest in theoutcome of the proceeding.2 See Harmelin v. Michigan, 501U. S. 957, 979, n. 9 (1991) (opinion of Scalia, J.) ("[I]t makessense to scrutinize governmental action more closely whenthe State stands to benefit"). Moreover, the availability ofa postseizure hearing may be no recompense for lossescaused by erroneous seizure. Given the congested civildockets in federal courts, a claimant may not receive an adversary hearing until many months after the seizure. Andeven if the ultimate judicial decision is that the claimant wasan innocent owner, or that the Government lacked probablecause, this determination, coming months after the seizure,"would not cure the temporary deprivation that an earlierhearing might have prevented." Doehr, 501 U. S., at 15.This brings us to the third consideration under Mathews,"the Government's interest, including the function involvedand the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additionalor substitute procedural requirement would entail." 424U. S., at 335. The governmental interest we consider hereis not some general interest in forfeiting property but thespecific interest in seizing real property before the forfeiturehearing. The question in the civil forfeiture context iswhether ex parte seizure is justified by a pressing need forprompt action. See Fuentes, 407 U. S., at 91. We find nopressing need here.2 The extent of the Government's financial stake in drug forfeiture isapparent from a 1990 memo, in which the Attorney General urged UnitedStates Attorneys to increase the volume of forfeitures in order to meetthe Department of Justice's annual budget target:"We must significantly increase production to reach our budget target.". . . Failure to achieve the $470 million projection would expose theDepartment's forfeiture program to criticism and undermine confidence inour budget projections. Every effort must be made to increase forfeitureincome during the remaining three months of [fiscal year] 1990." Executive Office for United States Attorneys, U. S. Dept. of Justice, 38 UnitedStates Attorney's Bulletin 180 (1990).510us1$$7J 06-18-97 16:43:27 PAGES OPINPGT57Cite as: 510 U. S. 43 (1993)Opinion of the CourtThis is apparent by comparison to Calero-Toledo, wherethe Government's interest in immediate seizure of a yachtsubject to civil forfeiture justified dispensing with the usualrequirement of prior notice and hearing. Two essential considerations informed our ruling in that case: First, immediate seizure was necessary to establish the court's jurisdictionover the property, 416 U. S., at 679, and second, the yachtmight have disappeared had the Government given advancewarning of the forfeiture action,ibid. See also UnitedStates v. Von Neumann, 474 U. S. 242, 251 (1986) (no pre-seizure hearing is required when customs officials seize anautomobile at the border). Neither of these factors ispresent when the target of forfeiture is real property.Because real property cannot abscond, the court's jurisdiction can be preserved without prior seizure. It is true thatseizure of the res has long been considered a prerequisite tothe initiation of in rem forfeiture proceedings. See Republic Nat. Bank of Miami v. United States, 506 U. S. 80, 84(1992); United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465U. S. 354, 363 (1984). This rule had its origins in the Court'searly admiralty cases, which involved the forfeiture of vessels and other movable personal property. See Taylor v.Carryl, 20 How. 583, 599 (1858); The Brig Ann, 9 Cranch289 (1815); Keene v. United States, 5 Cranch 304, 310 (1809).Justice Story, writing for the Court in The Brig Ann, explained the justification for the rule as one of fixing and preserving jurisdiction: "[B]efore judicial cognizance can attachupon a forfeiture in rem, . . . there must be a seizure; foruntil seizure it is impossible to ascertain what is the competent forum." 9 Cranch, at 291. But when the res is realproperty, rather than personal goods, the appropriate judicial forum may be determined without actual seizure.As The Brig Ann held, all that is necessary "[i]n order toinstitute and perfect proceedings in rem, [is] that the thingshould be actually or constructively within the reach of theCourt." Ibid. And as we noted last Term, "[f]airly read,510us1$$7J 06-18-97 16:43:27 PAGES OPINPGT58 UNITED STATES v. JAMES DANIELGOOD REAL PROPERTYOpinion of the CourtThe Brig Ann simply restates the rule that the court musthave actual or constructive control of the res when anin remforfeiture suit is initiated." Republic Nat. Bank, supra, at87. In the case of real property, the res may be broughtwithin the reach of the court simply by posting notice on theproperty and leaving a copy of the process with the occupant.In fact, the rules which govern forfeiture proceedings under$ 881 already permit process to be executed on real propertywithout physical seizure:"If the character or situation of the property is such thatthe taking of actual possession is impracticable, the marshal or other person executing the process shall affix acopy thereof to the property in a conspicuous place andleave a copy of the complaint and process with the per-son having possession or the person's agent." RuleE(4)(b), Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty andMaritime Claims.See also United States v. TWP 17 R 4, Certain Real Property in Maine, 970 F. 2d 984, 986, and n. 4 (CA1 1992).Nor is the ex parte seizure of real property necessary toaccomplish the statutory purpose of $ 881(a)(7). The Government's legitimate interests at the inception of forfeitureproceedings are to ensure that the property not be sold, destroyed, or used for further illegal activity prior to the forfeiture judgment. These legitimate interests can be securedwithout seizing the subject property.Sale of the property can be prevented by filing a notice oflis pendens as authorized by state law when the forfeitureproceedings commence. 28 U. S. C. $ 1964; and see Haw.Rev. Stat. $ 634-51 (1985) (lis pendens provision). If thereis evidence, in a particular case, that an owner is likely todestroy his property when advised of the pending action, theGovernment may obtain an ex parte restraining order, orother appropriate relief, upon a proper showing in districtcourt. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 65; United States v. Prem510us1$$7J 06-18-97 16:43:27 PAGES OPINPGT59Cite as: 510 U. S. 43 (1993)Opinion of the Courtises and Real Property at 4492 South Livonia Road, 889F. 2d 1258, 1265 (CA2 1989). The Government's policy ofleaving occupants in possession of real property under anoccupancy agreement pending the final forfeiture rulingdemonstrates that there is no serious concern about destruc-tion in the ordinary case. See Brief for United States 13,n. 6 (citing Directive No. 90-10 (Oct. 9, 1990), Executive Of-fice for Asset Forfeiture, Office of Deputy Attorney General).Finally, the Government can forestall further illegal activitywith search and arrest warrants obtained in the ordinarycourse.In the usual case, the Government thus has various means,short of seizure, to protect its legitimate interests in forfeit-able real property. There is no reason to take the additionalstep of asserting control over the property without first af-fording notice and an adversary hearing.Requiring the Government to postpone seizure until afteran adversary hearing creates no significant administrativeburden. A claimant is already entitled to an adversaryhearing before a final judgment of forfeiture. No extrahearing would be required in the typical case, since the Gov-ernment can wait until after the forfeiture judgment to seizethe property. From an administrative standpoint it makeslittle difference whether that hearing is held before or afterthe seizure. And any harm that results from delay is mini-mal in comparison to the injury occasioned by erroneousseizure. CIt is true that, in cases decided over a century ago, wepermitted theex parte seizure of real property when theGovernment was collecting debts or revenue. See,e. g.,Springer v. United States, 102 U. S. 586, 593-594 (1881);Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18How. 272 (1856). Without revisiting these cases, it sufficesto say that their apparent rationale--like that for allowingsummary seizures during wartime, see Stoehr v. Wallace, 255510us1$$7J 06-18-97 16:43:28 PAGES OPINPGT60 UNITED STATES v. JAMES DANIELGOOD REAL PROPERTYOpinion of the CourtU. S. 239 (1921); Bowles v. Willingham, 321 U. S. 503 (1944),and seizures of contaminated food, seeNorth American ColdStorage Co. v. Chicago, 211 U. S. 306 (1908)--was one of exec-utive urgency. "The prompt payment of taxes," we noted,"may be vital to the existence of a government." Springer,supra, at 594. See also G. M. Leasing Corp. v. UnitedStates, 429 U. S. 338, 352, n. 18 (1977) ("The rationale underlying [the revenue] decisions, of course, is that the very exist-ence of government depends upon the prompt collection ofthe revenues").A like rationale justified theex parte seizure of taxdelinquent distilleries in the late 19th century, see, e. g.,United States v. Stowell, 133 U. S. 1 (1890); Dobbins's Distillery v. United States, 96 U. S. 395 (1878), since before passageof the Sixteenth Amendment, the Federal Government reliedheavily on liquor, customs, and tobacco taxes to generate operating revenues. In 1902, for example, nearly 75 percentof total federal revenues--$479 million out of a total of $653million--was raised from taxes on liquor, customs, and tobacco. See U. S. Bureau of Census, Historical Statistics ofthe United States, Colonial Times to the Present 1122 (1976).The federal income tax code adopted in the first quarterof this century, however, afforded the taxpayer notice and anopportunity to be heard by the Board of Tax Appeals beforethe Government could seize property for nonpayment oftaxes. See Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 265-266; RevenueAct of 1924, 43 Stat. 297. In Phillips v. Commissioner, 283U. S. 589 (1931), the Court relied upon the availability, andadequacy, of these preseizure administrative procedures inholding that no judicial hearing was required prior to theseizure of property.

S. 43 (1993)Opinion of the Courtmous Court, Justice Brandeis explained that under the taxlaws "[f]ormal notice of the tax liability is thus given; theCommissioner is required to answer; and there is a completehearing de novo . . . . These provisions amply protect the[taxpayer] against improper administrative action." Id., at598-599; see alsoCommissioner v. Shapiro, 424 U. S. 614,631 (1976) ("[In] the Phillips case . . . the taxpayer's assetscould not have been taken or frozen . . . until he had eitherhad, or waived his right to, a full and final adjudication of histax liability before the Tax Court (then the Board of TaxAppeals)").Similar provisions remain in force today. The current In-ternal Revenue Code prohibits the Government from levyingupon a deficient taxpayer's property without first affordingthe taxpayer notice and an opportunity for a hearing, unlessexigent circumstances indicate that delay will jeopardize thecollection of taxes due. See 26 U. S. C. $$ 6212, 6213, 6851,6861.Just as the urgencies that justified summary seizure ofproperty in the 19th century had dissipated by the time ofPhillips, neither is there a plausible claim of urgency todayto justify the summary seizure of real property under$ 881(a)(7). Although the Government relies to some extenton forfeitures as a means of defraying law enforcement ex-penses, it does not, and we think could not, justify the prehearing seizure of forfeitable real property as necessary forthe protection of its revenues.DThe constitutional limitations we enforce in this case applyto real property in general, not simply to residences. Thatsaid, the case before us well illustrates an essential principle:Individual freedom finds tangible expression in propertyrights. At stake in this and many other forfeiture cases arethe security and privacy of the home and those who takeshelter within it.510us1$$7J 06-18-97 16:43:28 PAGES OPINPGT62 UNITED STATES v. JAMES DANIELGOOD REAL PROPERTYOpinion of the CourtFinally, the suggestion that this one claimant must losebecause his conviction was known at the time of seizure, andbecause he raises an as applied challenge to the statute,founders on a bedrock proposition: Fair procedures are notconfined to the innocent. The question before us is the le-gality of the seizure, not the strength of the Government'scase.In sum, based upon the importance of the private interestsat risk and the absence of countervailing Government needs,we hold that the seizure of real property under $ 881(a)(7)is not one of those extraordinary instances that justify thepostponement of notice and hearing. Unless exigent circumstances are present, the Due Process Clause requires theGovernment to afford notice and a meaningful opportunityto be heard before seizing real property subject to civilforfeiture.3To establish exigent circumstances, the Government mustshow that less restrictive measures--i. e., a lis pendens, re-straining order, or bond--would not suffice to protect theGovernment's interests in preventing the sale, destruction,or continued unlawful use of the real property. We agreewith the Court of Appeals that no showing of exigent circum-stances has been made in this case, and we affirm its rulingthat the ex parte seizure of Good's real property violateddue process.IIIWe turn now to the question whether a court must dismissa forfeiture action that the Government filed within the stat3 We do not address what sort of procedures are required for preforfeiture seizures of real property in the context of criminal forfeiture. See,e. g., 21 U. S. C. $ 853; 18 U. S. C. $ 1963 (1988 ed. and Supp. IV). We note,however, that the federal drug laws now permit seizure before entry of acriminal forfeiture judgment only where the Government persuades a district court that there is probable cause to believe that a protective order"may not be sufficient to assure the availability of the property for forfeiture." 21 U. S. C. $ 853(f).510us1$$7J 06-18-97 16:43:28 PAGES OPINPGT63Cite as: 510 U. S. 43 (1993)Opinion of the Courtute of limitations, but without complying with certain otherstatutory timing directives.Title 21 U. S. C. $ 881(d) incorporates the "provisions of lawrelating to the seizure, summary and judicial forfeiture, andcondemnation of property for violation of the customs laws."The customs laws in turn set forth various timing require-ments. Title 19 U. S. C. $ 1621 contains the statute of limitations: "No suit or action to recover any pecuniary penalty orforfeiture of property accruing under the customs laws shallbe instituted unless such suit or action is commenced withinfive years after the time when the alleged offense was discovered." All agree that the Government filed its actionwithin the statutory period.The customs laws also contain a series of internal requirements relating to the timing of forfeitures. Title 19 U. S. C.$ 1602 requires that a customs agent "report immediately" toa customs officer every seizure for violation of the customslaws, and every violation of the customs laws. Section 1603requires that the customs officer "report promptly" such seizures or violations to the United States attorney. And$ 1604 requires the Attorney General "forthwith to cause theproper proceedings to be commenced" if it appears probablethat any fine, penalty, or forfeiture has been incurred. TheCourt of Appeals held, over a dissent, that failure to complywith these internal timing requirements mandates dismissalof the forfeiture action. We disagree.We have long recognized that "many statutory requisitionsintended for the guide of officers in the conduct of businessdevolved upon them . . . do not limit their power or renderits exercise in disregard of the requisitions ineffectual."French v. Edwards, 13 Wall. 506, 511 (1872). We have heldthat if a statute does not specify a consequence for noncompliance with statutory timing provisions, the federal courtswill not in the ordinary course impose their own coercivesanction. See United States v. Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U. S.711, 717-721 (1990); Brock v. Pierce County, 476 U. S. 253,510us1$$7J 06-18-97 16:43:28 PAGES OPINPGT64 UNITED STATES v. JAMES DANIELGOOD REAL PROPERTYOpinion of the Court259-262 (1986); see also St. Regis Mohawk Tribe v. Brock,769 F. 2d 37, 41 (CA2 1985) (Friendly, J.).In Montalvo-Murillo, for example, we considered the BailReform Act of 1984, which requires an "immediat[e]" hearingupon a pretrial detainee's "first appearance before the judicial officer." 18 U. S. C. $ 3142(f ). Because "[n]either thetiming requirements nor any other part of the Act [could] beread to require, or even suggest, that a timing error mustresult in release of a person who should otherwise be detained," we held that the federal courts could not release aperson pending trial solely because the hearing had not beenheld "immediately." 495 U. S., at 716-717. We stated that"[t]here is no presumption or general rule that for every dutyimposed upon the court or the Government and its prosecutors there must exist some corollary punitive sanction fordepartures or omissions, even if negligent." Id., at 717 (citing French, supra, at 511). To the contrary, we stated that"[w]e do not agree that we should, or can, invent a remedyto satisfy some perceived need to coerce the courts and theGovernment into complying with the statutory time limits."495 U. S., at 721.Similarly, in Brock, supra, we considered a statute requiring that the Secretary of Labor begin an investigation within120 days of receiving information about the misuse of federalfunds. The respondent there argued that failure to actwithin the specified time period divested the Secretary ofauthority to investigate a claim after the time limit hadpassed. We rejected that contention, relying on the factthat the statute did not specify a consequence for a failureto comply with the timing provision. Id., at 258-262.Under our precedents, the failure of Congress to specify aconsequence for noncompliance with the timing requirementsof 19 U. S. C. $$ 1602-1604 implies that Congress intendedthe responsible officials administering the Act to have discretion to determine what disciplinary measures are appropriate when their subordinates fail to discharge their statu510us1$$7J 06-18-97 16:43:28 PAGES OPINPGT65Cite as: 510 U. S. 43 (1993)Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.tory duties. Examination of the structure and history of theinternal timing provisions at issue in this case supports theconclusion that the courts should not dismiss a forfeiture ac-tion for noncompliance. Because $ 1621 contains a statute oflimitations--the usual legal protection against stale claims--we doubt Congress intended to require dismissal of a forfeiture action for noncompliance with the internal timing re-quirements of $$ 1602-1604. Cf.United States v. $8,850, 461U. S., at 563, n. 13.Statutes requiring customs officials to proceed with dis-patch have existed at least since 1799. See Act of Mar. 2,1799, $ 89, 1 Stat. 695-696. These directives help to ensurethat the Government is prompt in obtaining revenue fromforfeited property. It would make little sense to interpretdirectives designed to ensure the expeditious collection ofrevenues in a way that renders the Government unable, incertain circumstances, to obtain its revenues at all.We hold that courts may not dismiss a forfeiture actionfiled within the 5-year statute of limitations for noncompliance with the internal timing requirements of $$ 1602-1604.The Government filed the action in this case within the 5-year statute of limitations, and that sufficed to make ittimely. We reverse the contrary holding of the Court ofAppeals. IVThe case is remanded for further proceedings consistentwith this opinion.
