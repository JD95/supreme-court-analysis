S. 495 (2000)Opinion of the Courtpose the governing authority of a state agency known as theOffice of Hawaiian Affairs, or OHA. Haw. Const., Art. XII,$ 5. The agency administers programs designed for the ben-efit of two subclasses of the Hawaiian citizenry. The smallerclass comprises those designated as "native Hawaiians," de-fined by statute, with certain supplementary language laterset out in full, as descendants of not less than one-half partof the races inhabiting the Hawaiian Islands prior to 1778.Haw. Rev. Stat. $ 10-2 (1993). The second, larger class ofpersons benefited by OHA programs is "Hawaiians," definedto be, with refinements contained in the statute we laterquote, those persons who are descendants of people inhabiting the Hawaiian Islands in 1778. Ibid. The right to votefor trustees is limited to "Hawaiians," the second, largerclass of persons, which of course includes the smaller classof "native Hawaiians." Haw. Const., Art. XII, $ 5.Petitioner Rice, a citizen of Hawaii and thus himself a Ha-waiian in a well-accepted sense of the term, does not havethe requisite ancestry even for the larger class. He is not,then, a "Hawaiian" in terms of the statute; so he may notvote in the trustee election. The issue presented by thiscase is whether Rice may be so barred. Rejecting theState's arguments that the classification in question is notracial or that, if it is, it is nevertheless valid for other reasons, we hold Hawaii's denial of petitioner's right to vote tobe a clear violation of the Fifteenth Amendment.IWhen Congress and the State of Hawaii enacted the lawswe are about to discuss and review, they made their ownassessments of the events which intertwine Hawaii's historywith the history of America itself. We will begin with avery brief account of that historical background. Historiansand other scholars who write of Hawaii will have a differentpurpose and more latitude than do we. They may drawjudgments either more laudatory or more harsh than the528US2 Unit: $U29 [06-15-01 20:43:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN500 RICE v. CAYETANOOpinion of the Courtones to which we refer. Our more limited role, in the pos-ture of this particular case, is to recount events as understood by the lawmakers, thus ensuring that we accord properappreciation to their purposes in adopting the policies andlaws at issue. The litigants seem to agree that two worksin particular are appropriate for our consideration, and werely in part on those sources. See L. Fuchs, Hawaii Pono:An Ethnic and Political History (1961) (hereinafter Fuchs);1-3 R. Kuykendall, The Hawaiian Kingdom (1938); (1953);(1967) (hereinafter Kuykendall).The origins of the first Hawaiian people and the date theyreached the islands are not established with certainty, butthe usual assumption is that they were Polynesians who voyaged from Tahiti and began to settle the islands around A. D.750. Fuchs 4; 1 Kuykendall 3; see also G. Daws, Shoal ofTime: A History of the Hawaiian Islands xii-xiii (1968) (Marquesas Islands and Tahiti). When England's Captain Cookmade landfall in Hawaii on his expedition in 1778, the Hawaiian people had developed, over the preceding 1,000 years orso, a cultural and political structure of their own. They hadwell-established traditions and customs and practiced a polytheistic religion. Agriculture and fishing sustained thepeople, and, though population estimates vary, some modernhistorians conclude that the population in 1778 was about200,000-300,000. See Fuchs 4; R. Schmitt, Historical Statistics of Hawaii 7 (1977) (hereinafter Schmitt). The accountsof Hawaiian life often remark upon the people's capacity tofind beauty and pleasure in their island existence, but lifewas not altogether idyllic. In Cook's time the islands wereruled by four different kings, and intra-Hawaiian wars couldinflict great loss and suffering. Kings or principal chieftains, as well as high priests, could order the death or sacrifice of any subject. The society was one, however, with itsown identity, its own cohesive forces, its own history.In the years after Cook's voyage many expeditions wouldfollow. A few members of the ships' companies remained on528US2 Unit: $U29 [06-15-01 20:43:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN501Cite as: 528 U. S. 495 (2000)Opinion of the Courtthe islands, some as authorized advisers, others as deserters.Their intermarriage with the inhabitants of Hawaii was notinfrequent.In 1810, the islands were united as one kingdom under theleadership of an admired figure in Hawaiian history, Kame-hameha I. It is difficult to say how many settlers fromEurope and America were in Hawaii when the King consolidated his power. One historian estimates there were nomore than 60 or so settlers at that time. 1 Kuykendall 27.An influx was soon to follow. Beginning about 1820, mis-sionaries arrived, of whom Congregationalists from NewEngland were dominant in the early years. They sought toteach Hawaiians to abandon religious beliefs and customsthat were contrary to Christian teachings and practices.The 1800's are a story of increasing involvement of westerners in the economic and political affairs of the Kingdom.Rights to land became a principal concern, and there wasunremitting pressure to allow non-Hawaiians to use and toown land and to be secure in their title. Westerners werenot the only ones with pressing concerns, however, for thedisposition and ownership of land came to be an unsettledmatter among the Hawaiians themselves.The status of Hawaiian lands has presented issues of complexity and controversy from at least the rule of Kamehameha I to the present day. We do not attempt to interpret that history, lest our comments be thought to bear uponissues not before us. It suffices to refer to various of thehistorical conclusions that appear to have been persuasive toCongress and to the State when they enacted the laws soonto be discussed.When Kamehameha I came to power, he reasserted suzerainty over all lands and provided for control of parts of themby a system described in our own cases as "feudal."

CAYETANOOpinion of the Courttained in an 1864 opinion of the Supreme Court of the King-dom of Hawaii. The court, in turn, drew extensively uponan earlier report which recited, in part, as follows:" `When the islands were conquered by Kamehameha I.,he followed the example of his predecessors, and dividedout the lands among his principal warrior chiefs, retaining, however, a portion in his own hands to be cultivatedor managed by his own immediate servants or attendants. Each principal chief divided his lands anew andgave them out to an inferior order of chiefs or personsof rank, by whom they were subdivided again and againafter (often) passing through the hands of four, five orsix persons from the King down to the lowest class oftenants. All these persons were considered to haverights in the lands, or the productions of them, the proportions of which rights were not clearly defined, al-though universally acknowledged. . . . The same rightswhich the King possessed over the superior landlordsand all under them, the several grades of landlords possessed over their inferiors, so that there was a jointownership of the land, the King really owning the allodium, and the person in whose hands he placed the land,holding it in trust.'

Kingdom 1847)).Beginning in 1839 and through the next decade, a successive ruler, Kamehameha III, approved a series of decreesand laws designed to accommodate demands for ownershipand security of title. In the words of the Hawaiian SupremeCourt, "[t]he subject of rights in land was one of daily increasing importance to the newly formed Government, for itwas obvious that the internal resources of the country couldnot be developed until the system of undivided and undefinedownership in land should be abolished." 2 Haw., at 721.528US2 Unit: $U29 [06-15-01 20:43:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN503Cite as: 528 U. S. 495 (2000)Opinion of the CourtArrangements were made to confer freehold title in somelands to certain chiefs and other individuals. The King retained vast lands for himself, and directed that other extensive lands be held by the government, which by 1840 hadadopted the first Constitution of the islands. Thus was effected a fundamental and historic division, known as theGreat Mahele. In 1850, foreigners, in turn, were given theright of land ownership.The new policies did not result in wide dispersal of ownership. Though some provisions had been attempted by whichtenants could claim lands, these proved ineffective in manyinstances, and ownership became concentrated. In 1920, theCongress of the United States, in a Report on the bill establishing the Hawaiian Homes Commission, made an assessment of Hawaiian land policy in the following terms:"Your committee thus finds that since the institution ofprivate ownership of lands in Hawaii the native Hawaiians, outside of the King and the chiefs, were grantedand have held but a very small portion of the lands ofthe Islands. Under the homestead laws somewhatmore than a majority of the lands were homesteaded toHawaiians, but a great many of these lands have beenlost through improvidence and inability to finance farming operations. Most frequently, however, the nativeHawaiian, with no thought of the future, has obtainedthe land for a nominal sum, only to turn about and sellit to wealthy interests for a sum more nearly approaching its real value. The Hawaiians are not business menand have shown themselves unable to meet competitiveconditions unaided. In the end the speculators are thereal beneficiaries of the homestead laws. Thus the taxreturns for 1919 show that only 6.23 per centum ofthe property of the Islands is held by native Hawaiiansand this for the most part is lands in the possessionof approximately a thousand wealthy Hawaiians, the528US2 Unit: $U29 [06-15-01 20:43:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN504 RICE v. CAYETANOOpinion of the Courtdescendents of the chiefs." H. R. Rep. No. 839, 66thCong., 2d Sess., 6 (1920).While these developments were unfolding, the UnitedStates and European powers made constant efforts to protect their interests and to influence Hawaiian political andeconomic affairs in general. The first "articles of arrangement" between the United States and the Kingdom ofHawaii were signed in 1826, 8 Department of State, Treatiesand Other International Agreements of the United Statesof America 1776-1949, p. 861 (C. Bevans comp. 1968), andadditional treaties and conventions between the two coun-tries were signed in 1849, 1875, and 1887, see Treaty withthe Hawaiian Islands, 9 Stat. 977 (1849) (friendship, com-merce, and navigation); Convention between the UnitedStates of America and His Majesty the King of the HawaiianIslands, 19 Stat. 625 (1875) (commercial reciprocity); Supplementary Convention between the United States of Americaand His Majesty the King of the Hawaiian Islands, 25 Stat.1399 (1887) (same). The United States was not the onlycountry interested in Hawaii and its affairs, but by the laterpart of the century the reality of American dominance intrade, settlement, economic expansion, and political influencebecame apparent.Tensions intensified between an anti-Western, pro-nativebloc in the government on the one hand and western busi-ness interests and property owners on the other. The conflicts came to the fore in 1887. Westerners forced the resig-nation of the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Hawaii andthe adoption of a new Constitution, which, among otherthings, reduced the power of the monarchy and extended theright to vote to non-Hawaiians. 3 Kuykendall 344-372.Tensions continued through 1893, when they again peaked,this time in response to an attempt by the then-Hawaiianmonarch, Queen Liliuokalani, to promulgate a new constitution restoring monarchical control over the House of Noblesand limiting the franchise to Hawaiian subjects. A so-called528US2 Unit: $U29 [06-15-01 20:43:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN505Cite as: 528 U. S. 495 (2000)Opinion of the CourtCommittee of Safety, a group of professionals and business-men, with the active assistance of John Stevens, the UnitedStates Minister to Hawaii, acting with United States ArmedForces, replaced the monarchy with a provisional government. That government sought annexation by the UnitedStates. On December 18 of the same year, President Cleveland, unimpressed and indeed offended by the actions of theAmerican Minister, denounced the role of the Americanforces and called for restoration of the Hawaiian monarchy.Message of the President to the Senate and House of Repre-sentatives, reprinted in H. R. Rep. No. 243, 53d Cong., 2dSess., 3-15 (1893). The Queen could not resume her formerplace, however, and, in 1894, the provisional government established the Republic of Hawaii. The Queen abdicated herthrone a year later.In 1898, President McKinley signed a Joint Resolution,sometimes called the Newlands Resolution, to annex theHawaiian Islands as territory of the United States. 30Stat. 750. According to the Joint Resolution, the Republicof Hawaii ceded all former Crown, government, and publiclands to the United States. Ibid. The resolution furtherprovided that revenues from the public lands were to be"used solely for the benefit of the inhabitants of the HawaiianIslands for educational and other public purposes." Ibid.Two years later the Hawaiian Organic Act established theTerritory of Hawaii, asserted United States control over theceded lands, and put those lands "in the possession, use, andcontrol of the government of the Territory of Hawaii . . .until otherwise provided for by Congress." Act of Apr. 30,1900, ch. 339, $ 91, 31 Stat. 159.In 1993, a century after the intervention by the Committeeof Safety, the Congress of the United States reviewed thishistory, and in particular the role of Minister Stevens. Congress passed a Joint Resolution recounting the events insome detail and offering an apology to the native Hawaiianpeople. 107 Stat. 1510.528US2 Unit: $U29 [06-15-01 20:43:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN506 RICE v. CAYETANOOpinion of the CourtBefore we turn to the relevant provisions two other important matters, which affected the demographics of Hawaii,must be recounted. The first is the tragedy inflicted on theearly Hawaiian people by the introduction of western diseases and infectious agents. As early as the establishmentof the rule of Kamehameha I, it was becoming apparent thatthe native population had serious vulnerability to diseasesborne to the islands by settlers. High mortality figureswere experienced in infancy and adulthood, even from common illnesses such as diarrhea, colds, and measles. Fuchs13; see Schmitt 58. More serious diseases took even greatertolls. In the smallpox epidemic of 1853, thousands of liveswere lost. Ibid. By 1878, 100 years after Cook's arrival,the native population had been reduced to about 47,500 people. Id., at 25. These mortal illnesses no doubt were aninitial cause of the despair, disenchantment, and despondencysome commentators later noted in descendents of the earlyHawaiian people. See Fuchs 13.The other important feature of Hawaiian demographics tobe noted is the immigration to the islands by people of manydifferent races and cultures. Mostly in response to the demand of the sugar industry for arduous labor in the canefields, successive immigration waves brought Chinese, Portuguese, Japanese, and Filipinos to Hawaii. Beginning withthe immigration of 293 Chinese in 1852, the plantations alonedrew to Hawaii, in one estimate, something over 400,000men, women, and children over the next century. Id., at 24;A. Lind, Hawaii's People 6-7 (4th ed. 1980). Each of theseethnic and national groups has had its own history in Hawaii,its own struggles with societal and official discrimination, itsown successes, and its own role in creating the present society of the islands. See E. Nordyke, The Peopling of Hawai`i28-98 (2d ed. 1989). The 1990 census figures show the resulting ethnic diversity of the Hawaiian population. U.

S. 495 (2000)Opinion of the Courtlation, Supplementary Reports, Detailed Ancestry Groupsfor States (Oct. 1992).With this background we turn to the legislative enact-ments of direct relevance to the case before us.IINot long after the creation of the new Territory, Congressbecame concerned with the condition of the native Hawaiianpeople. See H. R. Rep. No. 839, at 2-6; Hearings on theRehabilitation and Colonization of Hawaiians and Other Proposed Amendments to the Organic Act of the Territory ofHawaii before the House Committee on the Territories, 66thCong., 2d Sess. (1920). Reciting its purpose to rehabilitatethe native Hawaiian population, see H. R. Rep. No. 839, at1-2, Congress enacted the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act,which set aside about 200,000 acres of the ceded public landsand created a program of loans and long-term leases for thebenefit of native Hawaiians. Act of July 9, 1921, ch. 42, 42Stat. 108. The Act defined "native Hawaiian[s]" to include"any descendant of not less than one-half part of the bloodof the races inhabiting the Hawaiian Islands previous to1778."Ibid.Hawaii was admitted as the 50th State of the Union in1959. With admission, the new State agreed to adopt theHawaiian Homes Commission Act as part of its own Constitution. Pub. L. 86-3, $$ 4, 7, 73 Stat. 5, 7 (Admission Act);see Haw. Const., Art. XII, $$ 1-3. In addition, the UnitedStates granted Hawaii title to all public lands and publicproperty within the boundaries of the State, save thosewhich the Federal Government retained for its own use.Admission Act $$ 5(b)-(d), 73 Stat. 5.

Admission Act $ 5(f), 73 Stat. 6.In the first decades following admission, the State appar-ently continued to administer the lands that had been setaside under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act for thebenefit of native Hawaiians.

The Hawaiian Legislature hascharged OHA with the mission of "[s]erving as the principalpublic agency . . . responsible for the performance, development, and coordination of programs and activities relating tonative Hawaiians and Hawaiians," "[a]ssessing the policiesand practices of other agencies impacting on native Hawai-ians and Hawaiians," "conducting advocacy efforts for nativeHawaiians and Hawaiians," "[a]pplying for, receiving, anddisbursing, grants and donations from all sources for nativeHawaiian and Hawaiian programs and services," and "[s]erving as a receptacle for reparations." $ 10-3.OHA is overseen by a nine-member board of trustees, themembers of which "shall be Hawaiians" and--presenting theprecise issue in this case--shall be "elected by qualified voters who are Hawaiians, as provided by law." Haw. Const.,Art. XII, $ 5; see Haw. Rev. Stat. $$ 13D-1, 13D-3(b)(1)(1993). The term "Hawaiian" is defined by statute:" `Hawaiian' means any descendant of the aboriginal peoples inhabiting the Hawaiian Islands which exercisedsovereignty and subsisted in the Hawaiian Islands in1778, and which peoples thereafter have continued toreside in Hawaii." $ 10-2.The statute defines "native Hawaiian" as follows:528US2 Unit: $U29 [06-15-01 20:43:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN510 RICE v. CAYETANOOpinion of the Court" `Native Hawaiian' means any descendant of not lessthan one-half part of the races inhabiting the HawaiianIslands previous to 1778, as defined by the HawaiianHomes Commission Act, 1920, as amended; providedthat the term identically refers to the descendants ofsuch blood quantum of such aboriginal peoples whichexercised sovereignty and subsisted in the HawaiianIslands in 1778 and which peoples thereafter continuedto reside in Hawaii." Ibid.Petitioner Harold Rice is a citizen of Hawaii and a descendant of preannexation residents of the islands. He is not, aswe have noted, a descendant of pre-1778 natives, and so heis neither "native Hawaiian" nor "Hawaiian" as defined bythe statute. Rice applied in March 1996 to vote in the elections for OHA trustees. To register to vote for the office oftrustee he was required to attest: "I am also Hawaiian anddesire to register to vote in OHA elections." Affidavit onApplication for Voter Registration, Lodging by Petitioner,Tab 2. Rice marked through the words "am also Hawaiianand," then checked the form "yes." The State denied hisapplication.Rice sued Benjamin Cayetano, the Governor of Hawaii, inthe United States District Court for the District of Hawaii.(The Governor was sued in his official capacity, and the Attorney General of Hawaii defends the challenged enactments. We refer to the respondent as "the State.") Ricecontested his exclusion from voting in elections for OHAtrustees and from voting in a special election relating to native Hawaiian sovereignty which was held in August 1996.After the District Court rejected the latter challenge, seeRice v. Cayetano, 941 F. Supp. 1529 (1996) (a decision notbefore us), the parties moved for summary judgment on theclaim that the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to theUnited States Constitution invalidate the law excluding Ricefrom the OHA trustee elections.528US2 Unit: $U29 [06-15-01 20:43:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN511Cite as: 528 U. S. 495 (2000)Opinion of the CourtThe District Court granted summary judgment to theState. 963 F. Supp. 1547 (Haw. 1997). Surveying thehistory of the islands and their people, the District Courtdetermined that Congress and the State of Hawaii have recognized a guardian-ward relationship with the native Hawai-ians, which the court found analogous to the relationshipbetween the United States and the Indian tribes. Id., at1551-1554. On this premise, the court examined the votingqualification with the latitude that we have applied to legisla-tion passed pursuant to Congress' power over Indian affairs.Id., at 1554-1555 (citing Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535(1974)). Finding that the electoral scheme was "rationallyrelated to the State's responsibility under the Admission Actto utilize a portion of the proceeds from the $ 5(b) lands forthe betterment of Native Hawaiians," the District Courtheld that the voting restriction did not violate the Constitution's ban on racial classifications. 963 F. Supp., at1554-1555.The Court of Appeals affirmed. 146 F. 3d 1075 (CA91998). The court noted that Rice had not challenged theconstitutionality of the underlying programs or of OHA it-self. Id., at 1079. Considering itself bound to "accept thetrusts and their administrative structure as [it found] them,and assume that both are lawful," the court held that Hawaii"may rationally conclude that Hawaiians, being the group towhom trust obligations run and to whom OHA trustees owea duty of loyalty, should be the group to decide who thetrustees ought to be." Ibid. The court so held notwithstanding its clear holding that the Hawaii Constitution andimplementing statutes "contain a racial classification on theirface." Ibid.We granted certiorari, 526 U.

IIIThe purpose and command of the Fifteenth Amendmentare set forth in language both explicit and comprehensive.528US2 Unit: $U29 [06-15-01 20:43:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN512 RICE v. CAYETANOOpinion of the CourtThe National Government and the States may not violate afundamental principle: They may not deny or abridge theright to vote on account of race. Color and previous condition of servitude, too, are forbidden criteria or classifications,though it is unnecessary to consider them in the present case.Enacted in the wake of the Civil War, the immediate concern of the Amendment was to guarantee to the emancipatedslaves the right to vote, lest they be denied the civil andpolitical capacity to protect their new freedom. Vital as itsobjective remains, the Amendment goes beyond it. Consistent with the design of the Constitution, the Amendment iscast in fundamental terms, terms transcending the particularcontroversy which was the immediate impetus for its enactment. The Amendment grants protection to all persons, notjust members of a particular race.The design of the Amendment is to reaffirm the equalityof races at the most basic level of the democratic process,the exercise of the voting franchise. A resolve so absoluterequired language as simple in command as it was comprehensive in reach. Fundamental in purpose and effect andself-executing in operation, the Amendment prohibits allprovisions denying or abridging the voting franchise of anycitizen or class of citizens on the basis of race. "[B]y theinherent power of the Amendment the word white disappeared" from our voting laws, bringing those who had beenexcluded by reason of race within "the generic grant of suffrage made by the State." Guinn v. United States, 238 U. S.347, 363 (1915); see also Neal v. Delaware, 103 U. S. 370, 389(1881). The Court has acknowledged the Amendment'smandate of neutrality in straightforward terms: "If citizensof one race having certain qualifications are permitted bylaw to vote, those of another having the same qualificationsmust be. Previous to this amendment, there was no constitutional guaranty against this discrimination: now there is."United States v. Reese, 92 U.

S. 268 (1939) ("procedural hurdles"); Terry v.Adams, 345 U. S. 461 (1953) (white primary); Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649 (1944) (same); United States v. Thomas,362 U. S. 58 (1960)(per curiam) (registration challenges);Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339 (1960) (racial gerrymandering); Louisiana v. United States, 380 U. S. 145 (1965) ("interpretation tests")). Progress was slow, particularly whenlitigation had to proceed case by case, district by district,sometimes voter by voter. See 383 U. S., at 313-315.Important precedents did emerge, however, which give instruction in the case now before us. The Fifteenth Amendment was quite sufficient to invalidate a scheme which didnot mention race but instead used ancestry in an attempt toconfine and restrict the voting franchise. In 1910, the Stateof Oklahoma enacted a literacy requirement for voting eligibility, but exempted from that requirement the " `lineal descendant[s]' " of persons who were " `on January 1, 1866, orat any time prior thereto, entitled to vote under any form ofgovernment, or who at that time resided in some foreignnation.' " Guinn, supra, at 357. Those persons whoseancestors were entitled to vote under the State's previous,discriminatory voting laws were thus exempted from theeligibility test. Recognizing that the test served only toperpetuate those old laws and to effect a transparent racialexclusion, the Court invalidated it. 238 U. S., at 364-365.More subtle, perhaps, than the grandfather device inGuinn were the evasions attempted in the white primarycases; but the Fifteenth Amendment, again by its own terms,sufficed to strike down these voting systems, systems de528US2 Unit: $U29 [06-15-01 20:43:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN514 RICE v. CAYETANOOpinion of the Courtsigned to exclude one racial class (at least) from voting. SeeTerry, supra, at 469-470; Allwright, supra, at 663-666 (overruling Grovey v. Townsend, 295 U. S. 45 (1935)). The Fif-teenth Amendment, the Court held, could not be so circumvented: "The Amendment bans racial discrimination invoting by both state and nation. It thus establishes a national policy . . . not to be discriminated against as voters inelections to determine public governmental policies or to se-lect public officials, national, state, or local."Terry, supra,at 467.Unlike the cited cases, the voting structure now before usis neither subtle nor indirect. It is specific in granting thevote to persons of defined ancestry and to no others. TheState maintains this is not a racial category at all but insteada classification limited to those whose ancestors were inHawaii at a particular time, regardless of their race. Brieffor Respondent 38-40. The State points to theories of certain scholars concluding that some inhabitants of Hawaii asof 1778 may have migrated from the Marquesas Islands andthe Pacific Northwest, as well as from Tahiti. Id., at 38-39,and n. 15. Furthermore, the State argues, the restrictionin its operation excludes a person whose traceable ancestorswere exclusively Polynesian if none of those ancestors resided in Hawaii in 1778; and, on the other hand, the votewould be granted to a person who could trace, say, one sixtyfourth of his or her ancestry to a Hawaiian inhabitant onthe pivotal date. Ibid. These factors, it is said, mean therestriction is not a racial classification. We reject this lineof argument.Ancestry can be a proxy for race. It is that proxy here.Even if the residents of Hawaii in 1778 had been of morediverse ethnic backgrounds and cultures, it is far from clearthat a voting test favoring their descendants would not bea race-based qualification. But that is not this case. Forcenturies Hawaii was isolated from migration. 1 Kuykendall 3. The inhabitants shared common physical character528US2 Unit: $U29 [06-15-01 20:43:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN515Cite as: 528 U. S. 495 (2000)Opinion of the Courtistics, and by 1778 they had a common culture. Indeed, thedrafters of the statutory definition in question emphasizedthe "unique culture of the ancient Hawaiians" in explainingtheir work. Hawaii Senate Journal, Standing CommitteeRep. No. 784, at 1354; see ibid. ("Modern scholarship alsoidentified such race of people as culturally distinguishablefrom other Polynesian peoples"). The provisions before usreflect the State's effort to preserve that commonality of peo-ple to the present day. In the interpretation of the Reconstruction era civil rights laws we have observed that "racialdiscrimination" is that which singles out "identifiable classesof persons . . . solely because of their ancestry or ethnic char-acteristics."Saint Francis College v. Al-Khazraji, 481 U. S.604, 613 (1987). The very object of the statutory definitionin question and of its earlier congressional counterpart inthe Hawaiian Homes Commission Act is to treat the earlyHawaiians as a distinct people, commanding their own recognition and respect. The State, in enacting the legislationbefore us, has used ancestry as a racial definition and for aracial purpose.The history of the State's definition demonstrates thepoint. As we have noted, the statute defines "Hawaiian" as"any descendant of the aboriginal peoples inhabiting theHawaiian Islands which exercised sovereignty and subsisted in the Hawaiian Islands in 1778, and which peo-ples thereafter have continued to reside in Hawaii."Haw. Rev. Stat. $ 10-2 (1993).A different definition of "Hawaiian" was first promulgatedin 1978 as one of the proposed amendments to the StateConstitution. As proposed, "Hawaiian" was defined as "anydescendant of the races inhabiting the Hawaiian Islands, previous to 1778." 1 Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of Hawaii of 1978, Committee of the Whole Rep. No. 13,at 1018. Rejected as not ratified in a valid manner, see Kahalekai v. Doi, 60 Haw. 324, 342, 590 P. 2d 543, 555 (1979),528US2 Unit: $U29 [06-15-01 20:43:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN516 RICE v. CAYETANOOpinion of the Courtthe definition was modified and in the end promulgated instatutory form as quoted above. See Hawaii Senate Journal, Standing Committee Rep. No. 784, at 1350, 1353-1354;id., Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 77, at 998. By the drafters' ownadmission, however, any changes to the language were atmost cosmetic. Noting that "[t]he definitions of `native Hawaiian' and `Hawaiian' are changed to substitute `peoples' for`races,' " the drafters of the revised definition "stress[ed] thatthis change is non-substantive, and that `peoples' does mean`races.' " Ibid.; see also id., at 999 ("[T]he word `peoples' hasbeen substituted for `races' in the definition of `Hawaiian'.Again, your Committee wishes to emphasize that this sub-stitution is merely technical, and that `peoples' does mean`races' ").The next definition in Hawaii's compilation of statutes incorporates the new definition of "Hawaiian" and preservesthe explicit tie to race:" `Native Hawaiian' means any descendant of not lessthan one-half part of the races inhabiting the HawaiianIslands previous to 1778, as defined by the HawaiianHomes Commission Act, 1920, as amended; providedthat the term identically refers to the descendants ofsuch blood quantum of such aboriginal peoples whichexercised sovereignty and subsisted in the HawaiianIslands in 1778 and which peoples thereafter continuedto reside in Hawaii." Haw. Rev. Stat. $ 10-2 (1993).This provision makes it clear: "[T]he descendants . . . of [the]aboriginal peoples" means "the descendants . . . of theraces."Ibid.As for the further argument that the restriction differentiates even among Polynesian people and is based simply onthe date of an ancestor's residence in Hawaii, this too is insufficient to prove the classification is nonracial in purposeand operation. Simply because a class defined by ancestrydoes not include all members of the race does not suffice to528US2 Unit: $U29 [06-15-01 20:43:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN517Cite as: 528 U. S. 495 (2000)Opinion of the Courtmake the classification race neutral. Here, the State's argument is undermined by its express racial purpose and by itsactual effects.The ancestral inquiry mandated by the State implicatesthe same grave concerns as a classification specifying a particular race by name. One of the principal reasons race istreated as a forbidden classification is that it demeans thedignity and worth of a person to be judged by ancestry instead of by his or her own merit and essential qualities. Aninquiry into ancestral lines is not consistent with respectbased on the unique personality each of us possesses, a respect the Constitution itself secures in its concern for persons and citizens.The ancestral inquiry mandated by the State is forbiddenby the Fifteenth Amendment for the further reason that theuse of racial classifications is corruptive of the whole legalorder democratic elections seek to preserve. The law itselfmay not become the instrument for generating the prejudiceand hostility all too often directed against persons whoseparticular ancestry is disclosed by their ethnic characteristics and cultural traditions. "Distinctions between citizenssolely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon thedoctrine of equality." Hirabayashi v. United States, 320U. S. 81, 100 (1943). Ancestral tracing of this sort achievesits purpose by creating a legal category which employs thesame mechanisms, and causes the same injuries, as laws orstatutes that use race by name. The State's electoral restriction enacts a race-based voting qualification.IVThe State offers three principal defenses of its voting law,any of which, it contends, allows it to prevail even if theclassification is a racial one under the Fifteenth Amendment.We examine, and reject, each of these arguments.528US2 Unit: $U29 [06-15-01 20:43:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN518 RICE v. CAYETANOOpinion of the CourtAThe most far reaching of the State's arguments is that ex-clusion of non-Hawaiians from voting is permitted under ourcases allowing the differential treatment of certain membersof Indian tribes. The decisions of this Court, interpretingthe effect of treaties and congressional enactments on thesubject, have held that various tribes retained some elements of quasi-sovereign authority, even after cession oftheir lands to the United States. SeeBrendale v. Confeder-ated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 492 U. S. 408, 425(1989) (plurality opinion); Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe, 435U. S. 191, 208 (1978). The retained tribal authority relatesto self-governance. Brendale, supra, at 425 (plurality opin-ion). In reliance on that theory the Court has sustained afederal provision giving employment preferences to personsof tribal ancestry.Mancari, 417 U. S., at 553-555. TheMancari case, and the theory upon which it rests, are invoked by the State to defend its decision to restrict votingfor the OHA trustees, who are charged so directly with protecting the interests of native Hawaiians.If Hawaii's restriction were to be sustained under Mancari we would be required to accept some beginning prem-ises not yet established in our case law. Among other postulates, it would be necessary to conclude that Congress, inreciting the purposes for the transfer of lands to the State--and in other enactments such as the Hawaiian Homes Com-mission Act and the Joint Resolution of 1993--has determined that native Hawaiians have a status like that of Indi-ans in organized tribes, and that it may, and has, delegated tothe State a broad authority to preserve that status. Thesepropositions would raise questions of considerable momentand difficulty. It is a matter of some dispute, for instance,whether Congress may treat the native Hawaiians as it doesthe Indian tribes. Compare Van Dyke, The Political Statusof the Native Hawaiian People, 17 Yale L. & Pol'y Rev. 95(1998), with Benjamin, Equal Protection and the Special Re528US2 Unit: $U29 [06-15-01 20:43:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN519Cite as: 528 U. S. 495 (2000)Opinion of the Courtlationship: The Case of Native Hawaiians, 106 Yale L. J. 537(1996). We can stay far off that difficult terrain, however.The State's argument fails for a more basic reason. Evenwere we to take the substantial step of finding authority inCongress, delegated to the State, to treat Hawaiians or na-tive Hawaiians as tribes, Congress may not authorize a Stateto create a voting scheme of this sort.Of course, as we have established in a series of cases, Con-gress may fulfill its treaty obligations and its responsibilitiesto the Indian tribes by enacting legislation dedicated to theircircumstances and needs. SeeWashington v. WashingtonState Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U. S.658, 673, n. 20 (1979) (treaties securing preferential fishingrights); United States v. Antelope, 430 U. S. 641, 645-647(1977) (exclusive federal jurisdiction over crimes committedby Indians in Indian country); Delaware Tribal BusinessComm. v. Weeks, 430 U. S. 73, 84-85 (1977) (distribution oftribal property); Moe v. Confederated Salish and KootenaiTribes of Flathead Reservation, 425 U. S. 463, 479-480(1976) (Indian immunity from state taxes); Fisher v. DistrictCourt of Sixteenth Judicial Dist. of Mont., 424 U. S. 382,390-391 (1976) (per curiam) (exclusive tribal court jurisdiction over tribal adoptions). As we have observed, "everypiece of legislation dealing with Indian tribes and reservations . . . single[s] out for special treatment a constituency oftribal Indians." Mancari, supra, at 552.Mancari, upon which many of the above cases rely, presented the somewhat different issue of a preference in hiringand promoting at the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA),a preference which favored individuals who were " `onefourth or more degree Indian blood and . . . member[s] of aFederally-recognized tribe.' " 417 U. S., at 553, n. 24 (quoting 44 BIAM 335, 3.1 (1972)). Although the classificationhad a racial component, the Court found it important thatthe preference was "not directed towards a `racial' groupconsisting of `Indians,' " but rather "only to members of `fed528US2 Unit: $U29 [06-15-01 20:43:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN520 RICE v. CAYETANOOpinion of the Courterally recognized' tribes." 417 U. S., at 553, n. 24. "In thissense," the Court held, "the preference [was] political ratherthan racial in nature." Ibid.; see also id., at 554 ("The pref-erence, as applied, is granted to Indians not as a discreteracial group, but, rather, as members of quasi-sovereigntribal entities whose lives and activities are governed by theBIA in a unique fashion"). Because the BIA preferencecould be "tied rationally to the fulfillment of Congress'unique obligation toward the Indians," and was "reasonableand rationally designed to further Indian self-government,"the Court held that it did not offend the Constitution.Id.,at 555. The opinion was careful to note, however, that thecase was confined to the authority of the BIA, an agencydescribed as "sui generis." Id., at 554.Hawaii would extend the limited exception of Mancarito a new and larger dimension. The State contends that"one of the very purposes of OHA--and the challenged voting provision--is to afford Hawaiians a measure of selfgovernance," and so it fits the model of Mancari. Brief forRespondent 34. It does not follow from Mancari, however,that Congress may authorize a State to establish a votingscheme that limits the electorate for its public officials to aclass of tribal Indians, to the exclusion of all non-Indiancitizens.The tribal elections established by the federal statutes theState cites illuminate its error. See Brief for Respondent22 (citing, e. g., the Menominee Restoration Act, 25 U. S. C.$ 903b, and the Indian Reorganization Act, 25 U. S. C. $ 476).If a non-Indian lacks a right to vote in tribal elections, it isfor the reason that such elections are the internal affair of aquasi sovereign. The OHA elections, by contrast, are theaffair of the State of Hawaii. OHA is a state agency, established by the State Constitution, responsible for the administration of state laws and obligations. See Haw. Const., Art.XII, $$ 5-6. The Hawaiian Legislature has declared thatOHA exists to serve "as the principal public agency in th[e]528US2 Unit: $U29 [06-15-01 20:43:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN521Cite as: 528 U. S. 495 (2000)Opinion of the CourtState responsible for the performance, development, and co-ordination of programs and activities relating to native Hawaiians and Hawaiians." Haw. Rev. Stat. $ 10-3(3) (1993);see also Lodging by Petitioner, Tab 6, OHA Annual Report1993-1994, p. 5 (May 27, 1994) (admitting that "OHA is tech-nically a part of the Hawai'i state government," while asserting that "it operates as a semi-autonomous entity"). Foremost among the obligations entrusted to this agency is theadministration of a share of the revenues and proceeds frompublic lands, granted to Hawaii to "be held by said State asa public trust." Admission Act $$ 5(b), (f ), 73 Stat. 5, 6; seeHaw. Const., Art. XII, $ 4.The delegates to the 1978 constitutional convention explained the position of OHA in the state structure:"The committee intends that the Office of Hawaiian Affairs will be independent from the executive branch andall other branches of government although it will assume the status of a state agency. The chairman maybe an ex officio member of the governor's cabinet. Thestatus of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs is to be uniqueand special. . . . The committee developed this officebased on the model of the University of Hawaii. In par-ticular, the committee desired to use this model so thatthe office could have maximum control over its budget,assets and personnel. The committee felt that it wasimportant to arrange a method whereby the assets ofHawaiians could be kept separate from the rest of thestate treasury." 1 Proceedings of the ConstitutionalConvention of Hawaii of 1978, Standing Committee Rep.No. 59, at 645.Although it is apparent that OHA has a unique positionunder state law, it is just as apparent that it remains an armof the State.The validity of the voting restriction is the only questionbefore us. As the Court of Appeals did, we assume the va528US2 Unit: $U29 [06-15-01 20:43:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN522 RICE v. CAYETANOOpinion of the Courtlidity of the underlying administrative structure and trusts,without intimating any opinion on that point. Nonetheless,the elections for OHA trustee are elections of the State, notof a separate quasi sovereign, and they are elections to whichthe Fifteenth Amendment applies. To extend Mancari tothis context would be to permit a State, by racial classification, to fence out whole classes of its citizens from decision-making in critical state affairs. The Fifteenth Amendmentforbids this result. BHawaii further contends that the limited voting franchiseis sustainable under a series of cases holding that the rule ofone person, one vote does not pertain to certain special pur-pose districts such as water or irrigation districts. SeeBallv. James, 451 U. S. 355 (1981); Salyer Land Co. v. TulareLake Basin Water Storage Dist., 410 U. S. 719 (1973). Justas the Mancari argument would have involved a significantextension or new application of that case, so too it is far fromclear that the Salyer line of cases would be at all applicableto statewide elections for an agency with the powers andresponsibilities of OHA.We would not find those cases dispositive in any event,however. The question before us is not the one-person,one-vote requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment, but therace neutrality command of the Fifteenth Amendment. Ourspecial purpose district cases have not suggested that com-pliance with the one-person, one-vote rule of the FourteenthAmendment somehow excuses compliance with the FifteenthAmendment. We reject that argument here. We held fourdecades ago that state authority over the boundaries of polit-ical subdivisions, "extensive though it is, is met and overcome by the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution."Gomillion, 364 U. S., at 345. The Fifteenth Amendment hasindependent meaning and force. A State may not deny orabridge the right to vote on account of race, and this lawdoes so.528US2 Unit: $U29 [06-15-01 20:43:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN523Cite as: 528 U. S. 495 (2000)Opinion of the CourtCHawaii's final argument is that the voting restriction doesno more than ensure an alignment of interests between thefiduciaries and the beneficiaries of a trust. Thus, the con-tention goes, the restriction is based on beneficiary statusrather than race.As an initial matter, the contention founders on its ownterms, for it is not clear that the voting classification is sym-metric with the beneficiaries of the programs OHA administers. Although the bulk of the funds for which OHA is re-sponsible appears to be earmarked for the benefit of "nativeHawaiians," the State permits both "native Hawaiians" and"Hawaiians" to vote for the office of trustee. The classification thus appears to create, not eliminate, a differentialalignment between the identity of OHA trustees and whatthe State calls beneficiaries.Hawaii's argument fails on more essential grounds. TheState's position rests, in the end, on the demeaning premisethat citizens of a particular race are somehow more qualifiedthan others to vote on certain matters. That reasoningattacks the central meaning of the Fifteenth Amendment.The Amendment applies to "any election in which publicissues are decided or public officials selected." Terry, 345U. S., at 468. There is no room under the Amendment forthe concept that the right to vote in a particular election canbe allocated based on race. Race cannot qualify some anddisqualify others from full participation in our democracy.All citizens, regardless of race, have an interest in selectingofficials who make policies on their behalf, even if those policies will affect some groups more than others. Under theFifteenth Amendment voters are treated not as members ofa distinct race but as members of the whole citizenry.Hawaii may not assume, based on race, that petitioner or anyother of its citizens will not cast a principled vote. To acceptthe position advanced by the State would give rise to thesame indignities, and the same resulting tensions and ani528US2 Unit: $U29 [06-15-01 20:43:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN524 RICE v. CAYETANOBreyer, J., concurring in resultmosities, the Amendment was designed to eliminate. Thevoting restriction under review is prohibited by the Fifteenth Amendment.* * *When the culture and way of life of a people are all butengulfed by a history beyond their control, their sense of lossmay extend down through generations; and their dismay maybe shared by many members of the larger community. Asthe State of Hawaii attempts to address these realities, itmust, as always, seek the political consensus that beginswith a sense of shared purpose. One of the necessary beginning points is this principle: The Constitution of the UnitedStates, too, has become the heritage of all the citizens ofHawaii.In this case the Fifteenth Amendment invalidates the electoral qualification based on ancestry. The judgment of theCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed.
