The Tax Injunction Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1341, restricts thepower of federal district courts to prevent collection or enforcement of state taxes. It states: "The district courtsshall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy orcollection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedyand efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State."The statute, on its face, yields no exception to the jurisdic-tional bar save where the state remedy is wanting, but atleast one other exception is established by our cases: Thestatute does not constrain the power of federal courts if the*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the State of Ohioet al. by Betty D.

OFCENTRAL ARK.Opinion of the CourtUnited States sues to protect itself or its instrumentalitiesfrom state taxation. Department of Employment v. UnitedStates, 385 U. S. 355, 358 (1966). The present case exploresthe limits of this judicial exception. We decide herewhether instrumentalities called Production Credit Associations, corporations chartered under federal law, are includedwithin the exception when they sue by themselves. We holdthey are not and so may not sue in federal court for an injunction against state taxation without the United States asco-plaintiff. The action must be dismissed, and, as a result,we do not reach the merits of the taxation dispute.IProduction Credit Associations (PCA's) are corporationschartered by the Farm Credit Administration under theFarm Credit Act of 1971, 85 Stat. 583, as amended, 12 U. S. C.$ 2001 et seq. A PCA is a corporate financial institution organized by 10 or more farmers and designed in large partto make loans to farmers. $$ 2071, 2075. PCA's have haddiffering tax-exempt status at different times, depending onwhether the United States owned shares of their stock.See, e. g., Farm Credit Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 267. In the period relevant here (when all PCA stock has been in privatehands) they have been exempted, by explicit federal statute,from state taxes on their "notes, debentures, and other obligations." 12 U. S. C. $ 2077.Four PCA's, respondents here, brought suit in the UnitedStates District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansasclaiming a tax exemption going beyond the express statutorylanguage of $ 2077. They assert immunity not only from thetaxes described in the exemption statute we have quoted butalso from Arkansas sales and income taxes. They seek adeclaratory judgment and an injunction prohibiting the Statefrom levying the taxes against them. The District Courtgranted the PCAs' motion for summary judgment, and a di520US3 Unit: $U63 [09-11-99 17:58:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN825Cite as: 520 U. S. 821 (1997)Opinion of the Courtvided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for theEighth Circuit affirmed. 76 F. 3d 961 (1996).Entitlement to the immunity is the underlying substantiveissue, were we to reach it. The Tax Injunction Act, however, is an initial obstacle, for by its terms it would bar therelief the PCA's seek absent some exception. Seeking toovercome the bar under the Tax Injunction Act, the PCA's,first in the trial court and now here, contended that they areinstrumentalities of the United States and so not subject tothe provisions of the Act any more than the United Statesitself. The first point is correct: PCA's are instrumentalitiesof the United States because the statute which chartersthem says so. 12 U. S. C. $$ 2071(b)(7), 2077. The PCAs'argument about what follows from the designation, however,is incorrect. Instrumentalities of the United States, by virtue of that designation alone, do not have the same right asdoes the United States to avoid the prohibitions of the TaxInjunction Act.An observation is proper respecting our consideration ofthis threshold question. Although the trial court addressedthe meaning and operation of the Tax Injunction Act, in theCourt of Appeals the whole question seemed to disappear,though it goes to the heart of judicial authority. Neitherparty, we are advised, addressed the point and neither opinion in the Court of Appeals, majority or dissent, mentions it.While the question of the Act's applicability was not raisedin the State's petition for certiorari, the United States, in anamicus brief in support of the petition, called our attentionto the point. In granting the petition, we asked the partiesto address, in addition to the merits, whether the DistrictCourt should have dismissed the case for lack of subjectmatter jurisdiction in light of the Act. 519 U. S. 805 (1997).We have interpreted and applied the Tax Injunction Actas a "jurisdictional rule" and a "broad jurisdictional barrier."Moe v. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Flathead Reservation, 425 U. S. 463, 470 (1976). In dismissing520US3 Unit: $U63 [09-11-99 17:58:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN826 ARKANSAS v. FARM CREDIT SERVS. OFCENTRAL ARK.Opinion of the Courtan action filed in a United States District Court to challengestate taxes we held that the Tax Injunction Act "deprivedthe District Court of jurisdiction to hear [the] challenges."California v. Grace Brethren Church, 457 U. S. 393, 396(1982). Further, we found no jurisdiction even though thedefendant State argued in favor of the federal court's jurisdiction. Id., at 417, n. 38. In explaining our holding inGrace Brethren that declaratory relief is as violative of theTax Injunction Act as an injunction itself, we said the Actwas first and foremost a vehicle " `to limit drastically federaldistrict court jurisdiction to interfere with so important alocal concern as the collection of taxes.' " Id., at 408-409(quotingRosewell v. LaSalle Nat. Bank, 450 U. S. 503, 522(1981)). These statements underscore the fundamental importance of the restrictions imposed by the Tax InjunctionAct, restrictions we proceed to address.IIThe federal balance is well served when the several Statesdefine and elaborate their own laws through their own courtsand administrative processes and without undue interferencefrom the Federal Judiciary. The States' interest in the integrity of their own processes is of particular moment re-specting questions of state taxation. In our constitutionalsystem, the power of the State to tax is a concurrent power."That the power of taxation is one of vital importance; thatit is retained by the States; that it is not abridged by thegrant of a similar power to the government of the Union;that it is to be concurrently exercised by the two govern-ments: are truths which have never been denied."McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 425 (1819). The power totax is basic to the power of the State to exist. Wisconsin v.J. C. Penney Co., 311 U. S. 435, 444 (1940); Rosewell, supra,at 522.Enactment of the Tax Injunction Act of 1937 reflects acongressional concern to confine federal-court intervention520US3 Unit: $U63 [09-11-99 17:58:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN827Cite as: 520 U. S. 821 (1997)Opinion of the Courtin state government, a concern prominent after the Court'sruling inEx parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908), that the Eleventh Amendment is not in all cases a bar to federal-courtinterference with individual state officers alleged to haveacted in violation of federal law. See Rosewell, supra, at522, n. 28; Perez v. Ledesma, 401 U. S. 82, 104-115 (1971)(Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).Given the systemic importance of the federal balance, andgiven the basic principle that statutory language is to beenforced according to its terms, federal courts must guardagainst interpretations of the Tax Injunction Act whichmight defeat its purpose and text.Where the Government of the United States is a party, ofcourse, the other side of the federal balance must be considered. In our constitutional system the National Government has sovereign interests of its own. The necessity torespect the authority and prerogatives of the National Government underlies the now settled rule that the Tax Injunction Act is not a constraint on federal judicial power whenthe United States sues to protect itself and its instrumentalities from state taxation. The importance of allowing theUnited States to proceed in federal court to determine taximmunity questions is no doubt one reason why the exception was established with little discussion in Department ofEmployment v. United States. There the Court indicatedthe exception was consistent with a well-settled understanding that the Government is not bound by its own legislativerestrictions on the exercise of remedial rights unless the intent to bind it is express. 385 U. S., at 358, n. 6 (citingUnited States v. Livingston, 179 F. Supp. 9, 12 (EDSC 1959)(three-judge District Court), aff 'd, 364 U. S. 281 (1960);United States v. Arlington County, 326 F. 2d 929, 931 (CA41964); United States v. Bureau of Revenue of N. M., 291 F. 2d677, 679 (CA10 1961)). See also Dollar Savings Bank v.United States, 19 Wall. 227, 239 (1874). The Court concluded, "in accord with an unbroken line of authority, and520US3 Unit: $U63 [09-11-99 17:58:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN828 ARKANSAS v. FARM CREDIT SERVS. OFCENTRAL ARK.Opinion of the Courtconvincing evidence of legislative purpose, that $ 1341 doesnot act as a restriction upon suits by the United States toprotect itself and its instrumentalities from unconstitutionalstate exactions." 385 U. S., at 358 (footnotes omitted). Inall the District Court and Court of Appeals cases cited inDepartment of Employment, the United States was eitherthe sole plaintiff or a co-plaintiff. The United States hadjoined as co-plaintiff with the Red Cross in Department ofEmployment, arguing that the Red Cross was a federal instrumentality immune from state taxation, and we held thatthe Tax Injunction Act did not deprive the District Court ofjurisdiction to decide the merits and order relief.We have not before now considered whether federal instrumentalities fall under the exception to the Tax Injunction Act when they sue without the United States as coplaintiff. In Moe v. Confederated Salish and KootenaiTribes, we reasoned that when the United States is not aparty, the mere fact that a party challenging the tax hasinterests closely related to those of the Federal Governmentis not enough, in and of itself, to avoid the bar of the Act.We considered whether the Act barred the exercise of federal judicial power when Indian tribes were challenging thelawfulness and constitutionality of certain state taxes. Although the tribes did not have formal designations as instrumentalities of the United States, we assumed the intereststhey asserted were aligned with the interests of the FederalGovernment. Reserving the question of the precise significance of a federal instrumentality designation, the Courtsaid this congruence of interests was not sufficient to givethe tribes an exemption from the Act. 425 U. S., at 471-472.We went on to find the tribes exempt from the Act only because a second federal statute granted sweeping federalcourt jurisdiction where an Indian tribe was a party. Id., at472 (citing 28 U. S. C. $ 1362 (1976 ed.)). Moe is instructivehere. As in Moe, the PCA's say their own mission is definedand controlled by federal law and that their interests are the520US3 Unit: $U63 [09-11-99 17:58:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN829Cite as: 520 U. S. 821 (1997)Opinion of the Courtsame as those of the United States. We conclude here, aswe did inMoe, that this argument is insufficient to justify anexception to the Tax Injunction Act.True, important consequences flow from the congressionaldecision to designate a PCA formed pursuant to statuteas "an instrumentality of the United States." 12 U. S. C.$ 2071(b)(7). The tax immunity a PCA has under $ 2077 is apermitted consequence of its status as a federal instrumen-tality. An instrumentality of the United States can enjoythe benefits and immunities conferred by explicit statutes,however, without the further inference that the instrumentality has all of the rights and privileges of the NationalGovernment.Respondents attempt to counter this point by arguing thatNLRB v. Nash-Finch Co., 404 U. S. 138 (1971), is applicablehere and supports their cause. Nash-Finch involved not theTax Injunction Act, but the Anti-Injunction Act, the statutewhich restricts the authority of federal courts to enjoin proceedings in state courts. 28 U. S. C. $ 2283. The AntiInjunction Act provides: "A court of the United States maynot grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State courtexcept as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or wherenecessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuateits judgments." Just as the Tax Injunction Act is inapplicable where the United States is a party, a parallel rule prevails under $ 2283. Leiter Minerals, Inc. v. United States,352 U. S. 220, 225-226 (1957) (The restrictions of $ 2283 areinapplicable in a suit brought by the National Government).The question in Nash-Finch was whether the NationalLabor Relations Board (NLRB) came within the UnitedStates' exception to $ 2283. We held it did. In so ruling,we observed the NLRB's regulatory power "pre-empts thefield." 404 U. S., at 144; see also id., at 147 ("The exclusiveness of the federal domain is clear . . ."). The case does notaid the PCA's, for their powers are far different from thoseof the NLRB. As will be discussed in more detail below, the520US3 Unit: $U63 [09-11-99 17:58:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN830 ARKANSAS v. FARM CREDIT SERVS. OFCENTRAL ARK.Opinion of the CourtPCA's more closely resemble the private entities Nash-Finchdistinguished from the Federal Government and its agencies.Id., at 146.As to the Tax Injunction Act itself, the Courts of Appealshave adopted different standards over time for decidingwhether a federal instrumentality may sue in federal courtto enjoin state taxation where the United States is not aco-plaintiff. Under the most restrictive approach, there isno exception to the Tax Injunction Act for federal instrumentalities unless the United States sues as a co-plaintiff.See,e. g., United States v. State Tax Commission, 481 F. 2d963, 975 (CA1 1973) ("It is reasonable, as a prerequisite toby-passing normal state tax collection and litigation channels, that [the instrumentalities] persuade the Attorney General of the United States . . . to join in their claim"); HousingAuthority of Seattle v. State of Washington, Dept. of Revenue, 629 F. 2d 1307, 1311 (CA9 1980) (agreeing with the FirstCircuit in State Tax Commission that "such joinder [with theUnited States as co-plaintiff] is necessary before a federalinstrumentality can overcome the restrictions" of the TaxInjunction Act). After its decision in State Tax Commission, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit modifiedwhat had seemed to be a bright-line rule to produce a different test: "[E]ach instrumentality must be examined in lightof its governmental role and the wishes of Congress as expressed in relevant legislation." Federal Reserve Bank ofBoston v. Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation ofMass., 499 F. 2d 60, 64 (1974). Federal Reserve banks, theCourt of Appeals noted, are not analogous to private corporations, but rather are "plainly and predominantly fiscalarms of the federal government" with interests "indistinguishable from those of the sovereign." Id., at 62. Thecourt also pointed to a federal statute giving a Federal Reserve bank "unrestricted access to the district courts," id., at63 (referring to 12 U. S. C. $ 632); and to the Federal ReserveSystem's unusual position "outside the executive chain of520US3 Unit: $U63 [09-11-99 17:58:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN831Cite as: 520 U. S. 821 (1997)Opinion of the Courtcommand," 499 F. 2d, at 63. See also Bank of New EnglandOld Colony v. Clark, 986 F. 2d 600, 602-603 (CA1 1993) (describing Federal Reserve bank standard as a "flexible test").Under any of the tests we have described, PCA's wouldnot be exempt from the restrictions of the Tax InjunctionAct. The United States has not joined as a co-plaintiff andindeed opposes the District Court's exercise of jurisdiction.We need not inquire whether the holding of Nash-Finch--tothe effect that an agency with broad regulatory power isexempt from $ 2283 when it sues in its own name and notthrough the Attorney General or in the name of the UnitedStates--is applicable as well to the Tax Injunction Act.Whatever may be the rule under the Tax Injunction Actwhere a federal agency or body with substantial regulatory authority brings suit, PCA's are not entities of thatdescription. PCA's are not granted the right to exercisegovernment regulatory authority but rather serve specificcommercial and economic purposes long associated with various corporations chartered by the United States. Otherexamples include the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad Company(chartered under an Act of 1866 to construct and maintaina railroad and telegraph line from Springfield, Missouri, tothe Pacific Ocean, see Smith v. Reeves, 178 U. S. 436, 436-437 (1900)); the Rural Telephone Bank (7 U. S. C. $ 941); theUnited States Enrichment Corporation (42 U. S. C. $ 2297a,repealed effective on date of privatization, Pub. L. 104-134,$ 3116, 110 Stat. 1321). Indeed, in Smith v. Reeves, wetreated the federally chartered corporation as a private citizen, not as an arm of the United States, and held it to besubject to the Eleventh Amendment bar on suits againstStates. 178 U. S., at 446-447.The PCAs' business is making commercial loans, and alltheir stock is owned by private entities. Their interests arenot coterminous with those of the Government any morethan most commercial interests. Despite their formal andundoubted designation as instrumentalities of the United520US3 Unit: $U63 [09-11-99 17:58:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN832 ARKANSAS v. FARM CREDIT SERVS. OFCENTRAL ARK.Opinion of the CourtStates, and despite their entitlement to those tax immunitiesaccorded by the explicit statutory mandate, PCA's do nothave or exercise power analogous to that of the NLRB orany of the departments or regulatory agencies of the UnitedStates. This suffices for us to conclude that instrumentalitystatus does not in and of itself entitle an entity to the sameexemption the United States has under the Tax InjunctionAct.The Tax Injunction Act is grounded in the need of Statesto administer their fiscal affairs without undue interferencefrom federal courts. As all parties concede, respondentshave a "speedy, plain, and efficient remedy" in state court.In holding that the PCA's are subject to the Act's restrictionon federal-court jurisdiction, we further the State's interestswithout sacrificing those of the Government of the UnitedStates.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.
