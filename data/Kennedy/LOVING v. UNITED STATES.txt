The case before us concerns the authority of the President,in our system of separated powers, to prescribe aggravatingfactors that permit a court-martial to impose the death pen-alty upon a member of the Armed Forces convicted ofmurder. IOn December 12, 1988, petitioner Dwight Loving, an Armyprivate stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, murdered two taxicabdrivers from the nearby town of Killeen. He attempted tomurder a third, but the driver disarmed him and escaped.Civilian and Army authorities arrested Loving the next af-ternoon. He confessed.After a trial, an eight-member general court-martial foundLoving guilty of, among other offenses, premeditated murderand felony murder under Article 118 of the Uniform Code ofMilitary Justice (UCMJ), 10 U. S. C. $$ 918(1), (4). In thesentencing phase of the trial, the court-martial found threeaggravating factors: (1) that the premeditated murder of thesecond driver was committed during the course of a robbery,Rule for Courts-Martial (RCM) 1004(c)(7)(B); (2) that Lovingacted as the triggerman in the felony murder of the firstdriver, RCM 1004(c)(8); and (3) that Loving, having beenfound guilty of the premeditated murder, had committeda second murder, also proved at the single trial, RCM1004(c)(7)(J). The court-martial sentenced Loving to death.The commander who convened the court-martial approvedthe findings and sentence. Cf. 10 U. S. C. $ 860. The UnitedStates Army Court of Military Review and the UnitedStates Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (formerly theUnited States Court of Military Appeals (CMA)) affirmed, 41M.

We granted certiorari. 515 U. S.1191 (1995). IIAlthough American courts-martial from their inceptionhave had the power to decree capital punishment, they havenot long had the authority to try and to sentence membersof the Armed Forces for capital murder committed in theUnited States in peacetime. In the early days of the Repub-lic the powers of courts-martial were fixed in the Articles ofWar. Congress enacted the first Articles in 1789 by adopt-ing in full the Articles promulgated in 1775 (and revised in1776) by the Continental Congress. Act of Sept. 29, 1789,ch. 25, $ 4, 1 Stat. 96. (Congress reenacted the Articles in1790 "as far as the same may be applicable to the constitutionof the United States," Act of Apr. 30, 1790, ch. 10, $ 13, 1Stat. 121.) The Articles adopted by the First Congressplaced significant restrictions on court-martial jurisdictionover capital offenses. Although the death penalty was au-thorized for 14 military offenses, American Articles of Warof 1776, reprinted in W. Winthrop, Military Law and Prece-dents 961 (reprint 2d ed. 1920) (hereinafter Winthrop); Comment, Rocks and Shoals in a Sea of Otherwise Deep Commit-ment: General Court-Martial Size and Voting Requirements,35 Nav. L. Rev. 153, 156-158 (1986), the Articles followedthe British example of ensuring the supremacy of civil courtjurisdiction over ordinary capital crimes that were punish-able by the law of the land and were not special militaryoffenses. 1776 Articles, $ 10, Art. 1, reprinted in Winthrop964 (requiring commanders, upon application, to exert utmost effort to turn offender over to civil authorities). Cf.British Articles of War of 1765, $ 11, Art. 1, reprinted in Winthrop 937 (same). That provision was deemed protectionenough for soldiers, and in 1806 Congress debated and re517US3$59L 02-07-99 19:16:27 PAGES OPINPGT753Cite as: 517 U. S. 748 (1996)Opinion of the Courtjected a proposal to remove the death penalty from court-martial jurisdiction. Wiener, Courts-Martial and the Bill ofRights: The Original Practice I, 72 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 20-21(1958).Over the next two centuries, Congress expanded court-martial jurisdiction. In 1863, concerned that civil courtscould not function in all places during hostilities, Congressgranted courts-martial jurisdiction of common-law capitalcrimes and the authority to impose the death penalty inwartime. Act of Mar. 3, 1863, $ 30, 12 Stat. 736, Rev. Stat.$ 1342, Art. 58 (1875); Coleman v. Tennessee, 97 U. S. 509,514 (1879). In 1916, Congress granted to the military courtsa general jurisdiction over common-law felonies committedby service members, except for murder and rape committedwithin the continental United States during peacetime.Articles of War of 1916, ch. 418, $ 3, Arts. 92-93, 39 Stat. 664.Persons accused of the latter two crimes were to be turnedover to the civilian authorities. Art. 74, 39 Stat. 662. In1950, with the passage of the UCMJ, Congress lifted eventhis restriction. Article 118 of the UCMJ describes fourtypes of murder subject to court-martial jurisdiction, two ofwhich are punishable by death:"Any person subject to this chapter who, withoutjustification or excuse, unlawfully kills a human being,when he--"(1) has a premeditated design to kill;"(2) intends to kill or inflict great bodily harm;"(3) is engaged in an act which is inherently dangerous to another and evinces a wanton disregard of humanlife; or"(4) is engaged in the perpetration or attempted per-petration of burglary, sodomy, rape, robbery, or aggravated arson;"is guilty of murder, and shall suffer such punishmentas a court-martial may direct, except that if found guiltyunder clause (1) or (4), he shall suffer death or im517US3$59L 02-07-99 19:16:27 PAGES OPINPGT754 LOVING v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtprisonment for life as a court-martial may direct." 10U. S. C. $ 918.So matters stood until 1983, when the CMA confronteda challenge to the constitutionality of the military capitalpunishment scheme in light of Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S.238 (1972), and our ensuing death penalty jurisprudence.Although it held valid most of the death penalty proceduresfollowed in courts-martial, the court found one fundamentaldefect: the failure of either the UCMJ or the RCM to requirethat court-martial members "specifically identify the aggravating factors upon which they have relied in choosing toimpose the death penalty." United States v. Matthews, 16M. J. 354, 379. The court reversed Matthews' death sentence, but ruled that either Congress or the President couldremedy the defect and that the new procedures could beapplied retroactively. Id., at 380-382.The President responded to Matthews in 1984 with an Executive Order promulgating RCM 1004. In conformity with10 U. S. C. $ 852(a)(1), the Rule, as amended, requires a unanimous finding that the accused was guilty of a capital offensebefore a death sentence may be imposed, RCM 1004(a)(2).The Rule also requires unanimous findings (1) that at leastone aggravating factor is present and (2) that any extenuating or mitigating circumstances are substantially outweighedby any admissible aggravating circumstances, 1004(b).RCM 1004(c) enumerates 11 categories of aggravating factors sufficient for imposition of the death penalty. The Rulealso provides that the accused is to have "broad latitude topresent evidence in extenuation and mitigation," 1004(b)(3),and is entitled to have the members of the court-martial instructed to consider all such evidence before deciding upona death sentence, 1004(b)(6).This is the scheme Loving attacks as unconstitutional.He contends that the Eighth Amendment and the doctrineof separation of powers require that Congress, and not the517US3$59L 02-07-99 19:16:27 PAGES OPINPGT755Cite as: 517 U. S. 748 (1996)Opinion of the CourtPresident, make the fundamental policy determination re-specting the factors that warrant the death penalty.IIIA preliminary question in this case is whether the Consti-tution requires the aggravating factors that Loving challenges. The Government does not contest the application ofour death penalty jurisprudence to courts-martial, at leastin the context of a conviction under Article 118 for murdercommitted in peacetime within the United States, and weshall assume that Furman and the case law resulting fromit are applicable to the crime and sentence in question. Cf.Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86 (1958) (analyzing court-martialpunishments under the Eighth Amendment). The EighthAmendment requires, among other things, that "a capitalsentencing scheme must `genuinely narrow the class ofpersons eligible for the death penalty and must reasonablyjustify the imposition of a more severe sentence on thedefendant compared to others found guilty of murder.' "Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U. S. 231, 244 (1988) (quoting Zantv. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 877 (1983)). Some schemes ac-complish that narrowing by requiring that the sentencer findat least one aggravating circumstance. 484 U. S., at 244.The narrowing may also be achieved, however, in the definition of the capital offense, in which circumstance the require-ment that the sentencer "find the existence of an aggravatingcircumstance in addition is no part of the constitutionallyrequired narrowing process."Id., at 246.Although the Government suggests the contrary, Brieffor United States 11, n. 6, we agree with Loving, on the as-sumption thatFurman applies to this case, that aggravatingfactors are necessary to the constitutional validity of themilitary capital punishment scheme as now enacted. Article118 authorizes the death penalty for but two of the fourtypes of murder specified: premeditated and felony murderare punishable by death, 10 U. S. C. $$ 918(1), (4), whereas517US3$59L 02-07-99 19:16:27 PAGES OPINPGT756 LOVING v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtintentional murder without premeditation and murder re-sulting from wanton and dangerous conduct are not,$$ 918(2), (3). The statute's selection of the two types ofmurder for the death penalty, however, does not narrow thedeath-eligible class in a way consistent with our cases.Article 118(4) by its terms permits death to be imposed forfelony murder even if the accused had no intent to kill andeven if he did not do the killing himself. The EighthAmendment does not permit the death penalty to be imposedin those circumstances.Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782,801 (1982). As a result, additional aggravating factors establishing a higher culpability are necessary to save Article118. We turn to the question whether it violated the principle of separation of powers for the President to prescribe theaggravating factors required by the Eighth Amendment.IVEven before the birth of this country, separation of powerswas known to be a defense against tyranny. Montesquieu,The Spirit of the Laws 151-152 (T. Nugent transl. 1949);1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *146-*147, *269-*270.Though faithful to the precept that freedom is imperiled ifthe whole of legislative, executive, and judicial power is inthe same hands, The Federalist No. 47, pp. 325-326 (J. Madi-son) (J. Cooke ed. 1961), the Framers understood that a "hermetic sealing off of the three branches of Government fromone another would preclude the establishment of a Nationcapable of governing itself effectively," Buckley v. Valeo, 424U. S. 1, 120-121 (1976)(per curiam)."While the Constitution diffuses power the better tosecure liberty, it also contemplates that practice willintegrate the dispersed powers into a workable gov-ernment. It enjoins upon its branches separateness butinterdependence, autonomy but reciprocity." Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.

S. 361, 380-381 (1989) (quoting TheFederalist No. 47, supra, at 325-326 (emphasis deleted)), itremains a basic principle of our constitutional scheme thatone branch of the Government may not intrude upon thecentral prerogatives of another. See Plaut v. SpendthriftFarm, Inc., 514 U. S. 211, 225-226 (1995) (Congress may notrevise judicial determinations by retroactive legislation re-opening judgments);Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 726(1986) (Congress may not remove executive officers exceptby impeachment); INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 954-955(1983) (Congress may not enact laws without bicameral passage and presentment of the bill to the President); UnitedStates v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128, 147 (1872) (Congress may notdeprive court of jurisdiction based on the outcome of a caseor undo a Presidential pardon). Even when a branch doesnot arrogate power to itself, moreover, the separation-ofpowers doctrine requires that a branch not impair anotherin the performance of its constitutional duties. Mistretta v.United States, supra, at 397-408 (examining whether statuterequiring participation of Article III judges in the UnitedStates Sentencing Commission threatened the integrity ofthe Judicial Branch); Nixon v. Administrator of GeneralServices, 433 U. S. 425, 445 (1977) (examining whether lawrequiring agency control of Presidential papers disrupted thefunctioning of the Executive).Deterrence of arbitrary or tyrannical rule is not the solereason for dispersing the federal power among threebranches, however. By allocating specific powers and responsibilities to a branch fitted to the task, the Framerscreated a National Government that is both effective andaccountable. Article I's precise rules of representation,member qualifications, bicameralism, and voting proceduremake Congress the branch most capable of responsive and517US3$59L 02-07-99 19:16:27 PAGES OPINPGT758 LOVING v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtdeliberative lawmaking. See Chadha, supra, at 951. Illsuited to that task are the Presidency, designed for theprompt and faithful execution of the laws and its own legiti-mate powers, and the Judiciary, a branch with tenure andauthority independent of direct electoral control. The clearassignment of power to a branch, furthermore, allows thecitizen to know who may be called to answer for making, ornot making, those delicate and necessary decisions essentialto governance.Another strand of our separation-of-powers jurisprudence,the delegation doctrine, has developed to prevent Congressfrom forsaking its duties. Loving invokes this doctrine toquestion the authority of the President to promulgate RCM1004. The fundamental precept of the delegation doctrineis that the lawmaking function belongs to Congress, U. S.Const., Art. I, $ 1, and may not be conveyed to anotherbranch or entity. Field v. Clark, 143 U. S. 649, 692 (1892).This principle does not mean, however, that only Congresscan make a rule of prospective force. To burden Congresswith all federal rulemaking would divert that branch frommore pressing issues, and defeat the Framers' design ofa workable National Government. Thomas Jefferson observed: "Nothing is so embarrassing nor so mischievous in agreat assembly as the details of execution." 5 Works ofThomas Jefferson 319 (P. Ford ed. 1904) (letter to E. Car-rington, Aug. 4, 1787). See alsoA. L. A. Schechter PoultryCorp. v. United States, 295 U. S. 495, 529-530 (1935) (recog-nizing "the necessity of adapting legislation to complex conditions involving a host of details with which the nationallegislature cannot deal directly"). This Court establishedlong ago that Congress must be permitted to delegate toothers at least some authority that it could exerciseitself. Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 42 (1825)." `The true distinction . . . is between the delegationof power to make the law, which necessarily involves adiscretion as to what it shall be, and conferring author517US3$59L 02-07-99 19:16:27 PAGES OPINPGT759Cite as: 517 U. S. 748 (1996)Opinion of the Courtity or discretion as to its execution, to be exercisedunder and in pursuance of the law. The first cannot bedone; to the latter no valid objection can be made.' "Field, supra, at 693-694, quoting Cincinnati, W. & Z.R. Co. v. Commissioners of Clinton County, 1 Ohio St.77, 88-89 (1852).Loving contends that the military death penalty schemeof Article 118 and RCM 1004 does not observe the limitsof the delegation doctrine. He presses his constitutionalchallenge on three fronts. First, he argues that Congresscannot delegate to the President the authority to prescribeaggravating factors in capital murder cases. Second, hecontends that, even if it can, Congress did not delegate theauthority by implicit or explicit action. Third, Loving believes that even if certain statutory provisions can be con-strued as delegations, they lack an intelligible principle toguide the President's discretion. Were Loving's premises tobe accepted, the President would lack authority to prescribeaggravating factors in RCM 1004, and the death sentenceimposed upon him would be unconstitutional.ALoving's first argument is that Congress lacks power toallow the President to prescribe aggravating factors in military capital cases because any delegation would be inconsist-ent with the Framers' decision to vest in Congress the power"To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of theland and naval Forces." U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 14. Atleast in the context of capital punishment for peacetimecrimes, which implicates the Eighth Amendment, this powermust be deemed exclusive, Loving contends. In his view,not only is the determination of aggravating factors a quintessential policy judgment for the Legislature, but the historyof military capital punishment in England and America refutes a contrary interpretation. He asserts that his offensewas not tried in a military court throughout most of English517US3$59L 02-07-99 19:16:27 PAGES OPINPGT760 LOVING v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtand American history. It is this historical exclusion ofcommon-law capital crimes from military jurisdiction, heurges, that must inform our understanding of whetherClause 14 reserves to Congress the power to prescribe whatconduct warrants a death sentence, even if it permits Congress to authorize courts-martial to try such crimes. SeeBrief for Petitioner 42-43; Brief for United States NavyMarine Corps Appellate Defense Division as Amicus Curiae7-12, 19-26. Mindful of the historical dangers of autocraticmilitary justice and of the limits Parliament set on the peace-time jurisdiction of courts-martial over capital crimes in thefirst Mutiny Act, 1 Wm. & Mary, ch. 5 (1689), and havingexperienced the military excesses of the Crown in colonialAmerica, the Framers harbored a deep distrust of executivemilitary power and military tribunals. See Reid v. Covert,354 U. S. 1, 23-24 (1957) (plurality); Lee v. Madigan, 358 U. S.228, 232 (1959). It follows, Loving says, that the Framersintended that Congress alone should possess the power todecide what aggravating factors justify sentencing a memberof the Armed Forces to death.We have undertaken before, in resolving other issues, thedifficult task of interpreting Clause 14 by drawing upon English constitutional history. See, e. g., Reid, supra, at 23-30;O'Callahan v. Parker, 395 U. S. 258, 268-272 (1969) (determining that courts-martial only had jurisdiction of serviceconnected crimes); Solorio v. United States, 483 U. S. 435,442-446 (1987) (overruling O'Callahan and taking issue withits historical analysis). Doing so here, we find that, although there is a grain of truth in Loving's historical arguments, the struggle of Parliament to control military tribunals and the lessons the Framers drew from it are morecomplex than he suggests. The history does not require usto read Clause 14 as granting to Congress an exclusive, nondelegable power to determine military punishments. If anything, it appears that England found security in divided authority, with Parliament at times ceding to the Crown the517US3$59L 02-07-99 19:16:27 PAGES OPINPGT761Cite as: 517 U. S. 748 (1996)Opinion of the Courttask of fixing military punishments. From the English ex-perience the Framers understood the necessity of balancingefficient military discipline, popular control of a standingarmy, and the rights of soldiers; they perceived the risksinherent in assigning the task to one part of the Governmentto the exclusion of another; and they knew the resultingparliamentary practice of delegation. The Framers' choicein Clause 14 was to give Congress the same flexibility toexercise or share power as times might demand.In England after the Norman Conquest, military justicewas a matter of royal prerogative. The rudiments of law inEnglish military justice can first be seen in the written orders issued by the King for various expeditions. Winthrop17-18. For example, in 1190 Richard I issued an ordinanceoutlining six offenses to which the crusaders would be subject, including two punishable by death: "Whoever shall slaya man on ship-board, he shall be bound to the dead man andthrown into the sea. If he shall slay him on land he shall bebound to the dead man and buried in the earth." Ordinanceof Richard I--A. D. 1190, reprinted in id., at 903. The firstcomprehensive articles of war were those declared by Richard II at Durham in 1385 and Henry V at Mantes in 1419,which decreed capital offenses that not only served militarydiscipline but also protected foreign noncombatants from theravages of war. T. Meron, Henry's Wars and Shakespeare'sLaws: Perspectives on the Law of War in the Later MiddleAges 91-93 (1993). Articles of War, sometimes issued bymilitary commanders acting under royal commission in theensuing centuries, Winthrop 19, were not fixed codes, at leastthrough the 17th century; rather, "each war, each expedition,had its own edict," which lost force after the cessation ofhostilities and the disbanding of the army that had beenformed. J. Pipon & J. Collier, Manual of Military Law 14(3d rev. ed. 1863).Thus, royal ordinances governed the conduct of war, butthe common law did not countenance the enforcement of mili517US3$59L 02-07-99 19:16:27 PAGES OPINPGT762 LOVING v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courttary law in times of peace "when the king's courts [were]open for all persons to receive justice according to the lawsof the land." 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *413. Seealso M. Hale, History of the Common Law of England 25-27(C. Gray ed. 1971) (describing efforts of Parliament and thecommon-law courts to limit the jurisdiction of the militaryCourts of the Constable and the Marshal)."The Common Law made no distinction between thecrimes of soldiers and those of civilians in time of peace.All subjects were tried alike by the same civil courts, so`if a life-guardsman deserted, he could only be sued forbreach of contract, and if he struck his officer he wasonly liable to an indictment or action of battery.' "Reid, supra, at 24, n. 44 (quoting 2 J. Campbell, Lives ofthe Chief Justices of England 91 (1849)).See also 1 T. Macaulay, History of England 272 (n. d.) (herein-after Macaulay).The triumph of civil jurisdiction was not absolute, how-ever. The political disorders of the 17th century ushered inperiods of harsh military justice, with soldiers and at timescivilian rebels punished, even put to death, under the summary decrees of courts-martial. See C. Clode, Administration of Justice Under Military and Martial Law 20-42 (1872)(hereinafter Clode). Cf. Petition of Right of 1627, 3 Car. I,ch. 1 (protesting court-martial abuses). Military justice wasbrought under the rule of parliamentary law in 1689, whenWilliam and Mary accepted the Bill of Rights requiring Parliament's consent to the raising and keeping of armies. Inthe Mutiny Act of 1689, Parliament declared the generalprinciple that "noe Man may be forejudged of Life or Limbeor subjected to any kinde of punishment by Martiall Law orin any other manner then by the Judgement of his Peeresand according to the knowne and Established Laws of thisRealme," but decreed that "Soldiers who shall Mutiny or517US3$59L 02-07-99 19:16:27 PAGES OPINPGT763Cite as: 517 U. S. 748 (1996)Opinion of the Courtstirr up Sedition or shall desert Their Majestyes Service bebrought to a more Exemplary and speedy Punishment thanthe usuall Forms of Law will allow," and "shall suffer Deathor such other Punishment as by a Court-Martiall shall beInflicted." 1 Wm. & Mary, ch. 5.In one sense, as Loving wants to suggest, the Mutiny Actwas a sparing exercise of parliamentary authority, since onlythe most serious domestic offenses of soldiers were madecapital, and the militia was exempted. See Solorio, supra,at 442. He misunderstands the Mutiny Act of 1689, however, in arguing that it bespeaks a special solicitude for therights of soldiers and a desire of Parliament to exclude Executive power over military capital punishment.The Mutiny Act, as its name suggests, came on the heels ofthe mutiny of Scottish troops loyal to James II. 3 Macaulay45-49. The mutiny occurred at a watershed time. Menaced by great continental powers, England had come to agrudging recognition that a standing army, long decried asan instrument of despotism, had to be maintained on its soil.The mutiny cast in high relief the dangers to the polity of astanding army turned bad. Macaulay describes the senti-ment of the time:"There must then be regular soldiers; and, if there wereto be regular soldiers, it must be indispensable, both totheir efficiency, and to the security of every other class,that they should be kept under a strict discipline. Anill disciplined army . . . [is] formidable only to the country which it is paid to defend. A strong line of demarca-tion must therefore be drawn between the soldiers andthe rest of the community. For the sake of public freedom, they must, in the midst of freedom, be placed undera despotic rule. They must be subject to a sharperpenal code, and to a more stringent code of procedure,than are administered by the ordinary tribunals."Id.,at 50.517US3$59L 02-07-99 19:16:27 PAGES OPINPGT764 LOVING v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtThe Mutiny Act, then, was no measure of leniency for sol-diers. With its passage, "the Army of William III. was governed under a severer Code than that made by his predeces-sors under the Prerogative authority of the Crown. TheMutiny Act, without displacing the Articles of War and thoseMilitary Tribunals under which the Army had hitherto beengoverned, gave statutory sanction to the infliction of CapitalPunishments for offences rather Political than Military, andwhich had rarely been so punished under Prerogative authority." Clode 9-10. See also Duke & Vogel, The Consti-tution and the Standing Army: Another Problem of CourtMartial Jurisdiction, 13 Vand. L. Rev. 435, 443, and n. 40(1960) (noting that the Articles of War of 1662 and 1686prohibited the infliction in peacetime of punishment costinglife or limb). Indeed, it was the Crown that later temperedthe excesses of courts-martial wielding the power of capitalpunishment. It did so by stipulating in the Articles ofWar (which remained a matter of royal prerogative) that allcapital sentences be sent to it for revision or approval.Clode 9-10.Popular suspicion of the standing army persisted, 5 Macaulay 253-273, 393, and Parliament authorized the Mutiny Actsonly for periods of six months and then a year, 3 id., at 51-53.But renewed they were time and again, and Parliamentwould alter the power of courts-martial to impose the deathpenalty for peacetime offenses throughout the next century.It withdrew the power altogether in 1713, 12 Anne, ch. 13,$ 1, only to regret the absence of the penalty during the rebellion of 1715, Clode 49. The third of the Mutiny Acts of1715 subjected the soldier to capital punishment for a widearray of peacetime offenses related to political disorder andtroop discipline. Id., at 50. And, for a short time in the18th century, Parliament allowed the Crown to investcourts-martial with a general criminal jurisdiction over soldiers even at home, placing no substantive limit on the penalties that could be imposed; until 1718, that jurisdiction was517US3$59L 02-07-99 19:16:27 PAGES OPINPGT765Cite as: 517 U. S. 748 (1996)Opinion of the Courtsuperior to civil courts. Id., at 52-53. The propriety ofthat general jurisdiction within the kingdom was questioned,and the jurisdiction was withdrawn in 1749. Id., at 53.Nevertheless, even as it continued to adjust the scope ofmilitary jurisdiction at home, Parliament entrusted broadpowers to the Crown to define and punish military crimesabroad. In 1713, it gave statutory sanction to the Crown'slongstanding practice of issuing Articles of War without lim-iting the kind of punishments that might be imposed; and, inthe same Act, it delegated the power to "erect and constituteCourts Martial with Power to try hear and determine anyCrime or Offence by such Articles of War and inflict Penalties by Sentence or Judgement of the same in any of HerMajesties Dominions beyond the Seas or elsewhere beyondthe Seas (except in the Kingdom of Ireland) . . . as mighthave been done by Her Majesties Authority beyond the Seasin Time of War." 12 Anne, ch. 13, $ 43; Winthrop 20. Cf.Duke & Vogel, supra, at 444 (noting that Parliament in 1803gave statutory authority to the Crown to promulgate Articles of War applicable to troops stationed in England as well).See Solorio, 483 U. S., at 442 (discussing a provision in theBritish Articles of War of 1774 providing court-martial jurisdiction of civilian offenses by soldiers).As Loving contends, and as we have explained elsewhere,the Framers well knew this history, and had encounteredfirsthand the abuses of military law in the colonies. SeeReid, 354 U. S., at 27-28. As many were themselves veterans of the Revolutionary War, however, they also knew theimperatives of military discipline. What they distrustedwere not courts-martial per se, but military justice dispensedby a commander unchecked by the civil power in proceedingsso summary as to be lawless. The latter was the evil thatcaused Blackstone to declare that "martial law"--by whichhe, not observing the modern distinction between militaryand martial law, meant decrees of courts-martial discipliningsoldiers in wartime--"is built upon no settled principles, but517US3$59L 02-07-99 19:16:27 PAGES OPINPGT766 LOVING v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtis entirely arbitrary in its decisions, [and] is, as Sir MatthewHale observes, in truth and reality no law, but somethingindulged rather than allowed as a law." 1 Blackstone's Com-mentaries *413. See also Hale, History of the Common Lawof England, at 26-27; Clode 21 (military law in early 17thcentury England amounted to "the arbitrary right to punishor destroy, without legal trial, any assumed delinquent").The partial security Englishmen won against such abuse in1689 was to give Parliament, preeminent guardian of theBritish constitution, primacy in matters of military law.This fact does not suggest, however, that a legislature'spower must be exclusive. It was for Parliament, as it did inthe various Mutiny Acts, to designate as the times requiredwhat peacetime offenses by soldiers deserved the punishment of death; and it was for Parliament, as it did in 1713,to delegate the authority to define wartime offenses and devise their punishments, including death. The Crown received the delegated power and the concomitant responsibility for its prudent exercise. The lesson from the Englishconstitutional experience was that Parliament must have theprimary power to regulate the Armed Forces and to determine the punishments that could be imposed upon soldiersby courts-martial. That was not inconsistent, however, withthe further power to divide authority between it and theCrown as conditions might warrant.Far from attempting to replicate the English system, ofcourse, the Framers separated the powers of the FederalGovernment into three branches to avoid dangers theythought latent or inevitable in the parliamentary structure.The historical necessities and events of the English constitutional experience, though, were familiar to them and informour understanding of the purpose and meaning of constitutional provisions. As we have observed before, with thisexperience to consult they elected not to "freeze courtmartial usage at a particular time" for all ages following,Solorio, supra, at 446, nor did they deprive Congress of the517US3$59L 02-07-99 19:16:27 PAGES OPINPGT767Cite as: 517 U. S. 748 (1996)Opinion of the Courtservices of the Executive in establishing rules for the gover-nance of the military, including rules for capital punishment.In the words of Alexander Hamilton, the power to regulatethe Armed Forces, like other powers related to the commondefense, was given to Congress"without limitation: Because it is impossible to foreseeor define the extent and variety of national exigencies,or the corresponding extent & variety of the meanswhich may be necessary to satisfy them. The circum-stances that endanger the safety of nations are infinite,and for this reason no constitutional shackles can wiselybe imposed on the power to which the care of it is com-mitted. This power ought to be co-extensive with allthe possible combinations of such circumstances; andought to be under the direction of the same councils,which are appointed to preside over the commondefence." The Federalist No. 23, at 147 (emphasisdeleted).The later-added Bill of Rights limited this power to somedegree, cf. Burns v. Wilson, 346 U. S. 137, 140 (1953) (plural-ity opinion);Chappell v. Wallace, 462 U. S. 296, 300 (1983),but did not alter the allocation to Congress of the "primaryresponsibility for the delicate task of balancing the rights ofservicemen against the needs of the military," Solorio, 483U. S., at 447-448.Under Clause 14, Congress, like Parliament, exercises apower of precedence over, not exclusion of, Executive au-thority. Cf.United States v. Eliason, 16 Pet. 291, 301 (1842)("The power of the executive to establish rules and regulations for the government of the army, is undoubted"). Thispower is no less plenary than other Article I powers, Solorio,supra, at 441, and we discern no reasons why Congressshould have less capacity to make measured and appropriatedelegations of this power than of any other, see Skinner v.Mid-America Pipeline Co., 490 U. S. 212, 220-221 (1989)517US3$59L 02-07-99 19:16:27 PAGES OPINPGT768 LOVING v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court(Congress may delegate authority under the taxing power);cf.Lichter v. United States, 334 U. S. 742, 778 (1948) (generalrule is that "[a] constitutional power implies a power of dele-gation of authority under it sufficient to effect its purposes")(emphasis deleted). Indeed, it would be contrary to precedent and tradition for us to impose a special limitation onthis particular Article I power, for we give Congress thehighest deference in ordering military affairs. Rostker v.Goldberg, 453 U. S. 57, 64-65 (1981). And it would be contrary to the respect owed the President as Commander inChief to hold that he may not be given wide discretion andauthority. We decline to import into Clause 14 a restrictivenondelegation principle that the Framers left out.There is no absolute rule, furthermore, against Congress'delegation of authority to define criminal punishments. Wehave upheld delegations whereby the Executive or an independent agency defines by regulation what conduct will becriminal, so long as Congress makes the violation of regulations a criminal offense and fixes the punishment, and theregulations "confin[e] themselves within the field covered bythe statute." United States v. Grimaud, 220 U. S. 506, 518(1911). See also Touby v. United States, 500 U. S. 160 (1991).The exercise of a delegated authority to define crimes maybe sufficient in certain circumstances to supply the notice todefendants the Constitution requires. See M. Kraus &Bros., Inc. v. United States, 327 U. S. 614, 622 (1946). In thecircumstances presented here, so too may Congress delegateauthority to the President to define the aggravating factorsthat permit imposition of a statutory penalty, with the regulations providing the narrowing of the death-eligible classthat the Eighth Amendment requires.In 1950, Congress confronted the problem of what criminaljurisdiction would be appropriate for Armed Forces of colossal size, stationed on bases that in many instances were smallsocieties unto themselves. Congress, confident in the procedural protections of the UCMJ, gave to courts-martial juris517US3$59L 02-07-99 19:16:27 PAGES OPINPGT769Cite as: 517 U. S. 748 (1996)Opinion of the Courtdiction of the crime of murder. Cf. Solorio, supra, at 450-451 (Congress may extend court-martial jurisdiction to anycriminal offense committed by a service member during hisperiod of service). It further declared the law that servicemembers who commit premeditated and felony murder maybe sentenced to death by a court-martial. There is nothingin the constitutional scheme or our traditions to prohibitCongress from delegating the prudent and proper implementation of the capital murder statute to the President actingas Commander in Chief.BHaving held that Congress has the power of delegation,we further hold that it exercised the power in Articles 18 and56 of the UCMJ. Article 56 specifies that "[t]he punishmentwhich a court-martial may direct for an offense may notexceed such limits as the President may prescribe for thatoffense." 10 U. S. C. $ 856. Article 18 states that a courtmartial "may, under such limitations as the President mayprescribe, adjudge any punishment not forbidden by [theUCMJ], including the penalty of death when specifically au-thorized by" the Code. $ 818. As the Court of Military Appeals pointed out in Curtis, for some decades the Presidenthas used his authority under these Articles to increase thepenalties for certain noncapital offenses if aggravatingcircumstances are present. For example, by regulation,deserters who are apprehended are punished more severelythan those who surrender; drunken drivers suffer a harsherfate if they cause an accident resulting in the death of a vic-tim; and the punishment of thieves is graded by the value ofthe stolen goods. See Curtis, 32 M. J., at 261. The Presi-dent has thus provided more precision in sentencing than isprovided by the statute, while remaining within statutorybounds. This past practice suggests that Articles 18 and 56support as well an authority in the President to restrict thedeath sentence to murders in which certain aggravatingcircumstances have been established.517US3$59L 02-07-99 19:16:27 PAGES OPINPGT770 LOVING v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtThere is yet a third provision of the UCMJ indicative ofcongressional intent to delegate this authority to the President. Article 36 of the UCMJ, which gives the Presidentthe power to make procedural rules for courts-martial,provides:"Pretrial, trial, and post-trial procedures, includingmodes of proof, for [courts martial] . . . may be pre-scribed by the President by regulations which shall, sofar as he considers practicable, apply the principles oflaw and the rules of evidence generally recognized inthe trial of criminal cases in the United States districtcourts, but which may not be contrary to or inconsistentwith this chapter." 10 U. S. C. $ 836(a).Although the language of Article 36 seems further afieldfrom capital aggravating factors than that of Article 18 or56, it is the provision that a later Congress identified as thesource of Presidential authority to prescribe these factors.In 1985, Congress enacted Article 106a of the UCMJ, 10U. S. C. $ 906a, which authorized the death penalty for espionage. The Article requires a finding of an aggravating fac-tor if the accused is to be sentenced to death; it enumeratesthree such factors, but allows death to be decreed on "[a]nyother factor that may be prescribed by the President byregulations under section 836 of this title (article 36)."$ 906a(c)(4). Article 106a itself, then, is premised on thePresident's having authority under Article 36 to prescribecapital aggravating factors, and " `[s]ubsequent legislationdeclaring the intent of an earlier statute is entitled to greatweight in statutory construction.' " Consumer ProductSafety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U. S. 102, 118,n. 13 (1980) (quoting Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395U. S. 367, 380-381 (1969)). Whether or not Article 36 wouldstand on its own as the source of the delegated power, wehold that Articles 18, 36, and 56 together give clear authorityto the President for the promulgation of RCM 1004.517US3$59L 02-07-99 19:16:27 PAGES OPINPGT771Cite as: 517 U. S. 748 (1996)Opinion of the CourtLoving points out that the three Articles were enacted aspart of the UCMJ in 1950, well before the need for eliminating absolute discretion in capital sentencing was establishedin Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238 (1972), and the casesthat followed. (Slight amendments to the Articles havebeen made since but are not relevant here.) In 1950, he argues, Congress could not have understood that it was givingthe President the authority to bring an otherwise invalidcapital murder statute in line with Eighth Amendment stric-tures. Perhaps so, butFurman did not somehow undo theprior delegation. What would have been an act of leniencyby the President prior to Furman may have become a con-stitutional necessity thereafter, seesupra, at 755-756, butthe fact remains the power to prescribe aggravating circumstances has resided with the President since 1950.CIt does not suffice to say that Congress announced its willto delegate certain authority. Congress as a general rulemust also "lay down by legislative act an intelligible princi-ple to which the person or body authorized to [act] is directedto conform." J. W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States,276 U. S. 394, 409 (1928);Touby, 500 U. S., at 165. Theintelligible-principle rule seeks to enforce the understandingthat Congress may not delegate the power to make laws andso may delegate no more than the authority to make policiesand rules that implement its statutes. Field, 143 U. S., at693-694. Though in 1935 we struck down two delegationsfor lack of an intelligible principle, A. L. A. Schecter PoultryCorp. v. United States, 295 U. S. 495 (1935), and PanamaRefining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U. S. 388 (1935), we have sinceupheld, without exception, delegations under standardsphrased in sweeping terms. See, e. g., National Broadcast-ing Co. v. United States, 319 U. S. 190, 216-217, 225-226(1943) (upholding delegation to the Federal CommunicationsCommission to regulate radio broadcasting according to517US3$59L 02-07-99 19:16:27 PAGES OPINPGT772 LOVING v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court"public interest, convenience, or necessity"). Had the dele-gations here called for the exercise of judgment or discretionthat lies beyond the traditional authority of the President,Loving's last argument that Congress failed to provide guiding principles to the President might have more weight. Wefind no fault, however, with the delegation in this case.InUnited States v. Curtis, the Court of Military Appealsdiscerned a principle limiting the President's discretion todefine aggravating factors for capital crimes in Article 36:namely, the directive that regulations the President pre-scribes must "apply the principles of law . . . generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts, but which may not be contrary to or inconsistentwith this chapter," 10 U. S. C. $ 836(a). We think, however,that the question to be asked is not whether there was anyexplicit principle telling the President how to select aggravating factors, but whether any such guidance was needed,given the nature of the delegation and the officer who is toexercise the delegated authority. First, the delegation is setwithin boundaries the President may not exceed. Second,the delegation here was to the President in his role as Commander in Chief. Perhaps more explicit guidance as to howto select aggravating factors would be necessary if delegation were made to a newly created entity without independent authority in the area. Cf. Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 374-379 (upholding delegation to the United States SentencingCommission because of detailed congressional directiveschanneling agency discretion). The President's duties asCommander in Chief, however, require him to take responsible and continuing action to superintend the military, including the courts-martial. The delegated duty, then, is interlinked with duties already assigned to the President byexpress terms of the Constitution, and the same limitationson delegation do not apply "where the entity exercising thedelegated authority itself possesses independent authorityover the subject matter," United States v. Mazurie, 419 U. S.517US3$59L 02-07-99 19:16:27 PAGES OPINPGT773Cite as: 517 U. S. 748 (1996)Opinion of the Court544, 556-557 (1975). See also United States v. CurtissWright Export Corp., 299 U. S. 304, 319-322 (1936). Cf.Swaim v. United States, 165 U. S. 553, 557-558 (1897) (Presi-dent has inherent authority to convene courts-martial).Like the Court of Military Appeals, Curtis, 32 M. J., at 263,n. 9, we need not decide whether the President would haveinherent power as Commander in Chief to prescribe aggravating factors in capital cases. Once delegated that powerby Congress, the President, acting in his constitutional officeof Commander in Chief, had undoubted competency toprescribe those factors without further guidance. "Themilitary constitutes a specialized community governed bya separate discipline from that of the civilian," Orloff v.Willoughby, 345 U. S. 83, 94 (1953), and the President canbe entrusted to determine what limitations and conditionson punishments are best suited to preserve that specialdiscipline.It is hard to deem lawless a delegation giving the President broad discretion to prescribe rules on this subject.From the early days of the Republic, the President has hadcongressional authorization to intervene in cases wherecourts-martial decreed death. American Articles of War of1806, Art. 65, reprinted in Winthrop 976, 982. It would becontradictory to say that Congress cannot further empowerhim to limit by prospective regulation the circumstances inwhich courts-martial can impose a death sentence. Specificauthority to make rules for the limitation of capital punishment contributes more toward principled and uniform military sentencing regimes than does case-by-case intervention,and it provides greater opportunity for congressional oversight and revision.Separation-of-powers principles are vindicated, not disserved, by measured cooperation between the two politicalbranches of the Government, each contributing to a lawfulobjective through its own processes. The delegation to thePresident as Commander in Chief of the authority to pre517US3$59L 02-07-99 19:16:27 PAGES OPINPGT774 LOVING v. UNITED STATESStevens, J., concurringscribe aggravating factors was in all respects consistent withthese precepts, and the promulgation of RCM 1004 was wellwithin the delegated authority. Loving's sentence was law-ful, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the ArmedForces is affirmed.
