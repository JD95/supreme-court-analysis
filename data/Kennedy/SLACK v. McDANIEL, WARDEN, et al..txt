McDANIELOpinion of the CourtFirst, when a habeas corpus petitioner seeks to initiatean appeal of the dismissal of a habeas corpus petition afterApril 24, 1996 (the effective date of AEDPA), the right toappeal is governed by the certificate of appealability (COA)requirements now found at 28 U. S. C. $ 2253(c) (1994 ed.,Supp. III). This is true whether the habeas corpus petitionwas filed in the district court before or after AEDPA's effec-tive date.Second, when the district court denies a habeas petitionon procedural grounds without reaching the prisoner's underlying constitutional claim, a COA should issue (and anappeal of the district court's order may be taken) if the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it de-batable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denialof a constitutional right, and that jurists of reason wouldfind it debatable whether the district court was correct in itsprocedural ruling.Third, a habeas petition which is filed after an initial petition was dismissed without adjudication on the merits forfailure to exhaust state remedies is not a "second or successive" petition as that term is understood in the habeas corpuscontext. Federal courts do, however, retain broad powersto prevent duplicative or unnecessary litigation.IPetitioner Antonio Slack was convicted of second-degreemurder in Nevada state court in 1990. His direct appealwas unsuccessful. On November 27, 1991, Slack filed a peti-tion for writ of habeas corpus in federal court under 28U. S. C. $ 2254. Early in the federal proceeding, Slack de-cided to litigate claims he had not yet presented to the Nevada courts. He could not raise the claims in federal courtbecause, under the exhaustion of remedies rule explained inRose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509 (1982), a federal court was required to dismiss a petition presenting claims not yet liti529US2 Unit: $U50 [09-26-01 10:29:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN479Cite as: 529 U. S. 473 (2000)Opinion of the Courtgated in state court. Accordingly, Slack filed a motion seeking to hold his federal petition in abeyance while he returnedto state court to exhaust the new claims. Without objectionby the State, the District Court ordered the habeas petitiondismissed "without prejudice." The order, dated February19, 1992, further stated, "Petitioner is granted leave to file anapplication to renew upon exhaustion of all State remedies."Slack v. Director, Nev. Dept. of Prisons, No. CV-N-91-561(D. Nev.), App. 22.After an unsuccessful round of state postconviction proceedings, Slack filed a new federal habeas petition on May30, 1995. The District Court later appointed counsel, directing him to file an amended petition or a notice of intentionto proceed with the current petition. On December 24, 1997,counsel filed an amended petition presenting 14 claims forrelief. The State moved to dismiss the petition. As its firstground, the State argued that Slack's petition must be dismissed because it was a mixed petition, that is to say a petition raising some claims which had been presented to thestate courts and some which had not. As its second ground,the State cited Farmer v. McDaniel, 98 F. 3d 1548 (CA91996), and contended that, under the established rule in theNinth Circuit, claims Slack had not raised in his 1991 federalhabeas petition must be dismissed as an abuse of the writ.The District Court granted the State's motion. First, thecourt relied on Farmer to hold that Slack's 1995 petition was"[a] second or successive petition," even though his 1991 petition had been dismissed without prejudice for a failure toexhaust state remedies. The court then invoked the abuseof the writ doctrine to dismiss with prejudice the claimsSlack had not raised in the 1991 petition. This left Slackwith four claims, each having been raised in the 1991 petition; but one of these, the court concluded, had not yet beenpresented to the state courts. The court therefore dismissed Slack's remaining claims because they were in a529US2 Unit: $U50 [09-26-01 10:29:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN480 SLACK v. McDANIELOpinion of the Courtmixed petition. Here, Slack seeks to challenge the dismissalof claims as abusive; he does not contend that all claims presented in the amended petition were exhausted.The District Court's dismissal order was filed March 30,1998. On April 29, 1998, Slack filed in the District Courta pleading captioned "Notice of Appeal." Consistent withCircuit practice, the court treated the notice as an application for a certificate of probable cause (CPC) under the preAEDPA version of 28 U. S. C. $ 2253; and it denied a CPC,concluding the appeal would raise no substantial issue. TheCourt of Appeals likewise denied a CPC. No. CV-95-194(CA9, July 7, 1998), App. 197. As a result, Slack was notpermitted to take an appeal of the order dismissing his petition. We granted certiorari. 525 U. S. 1138 (1999). Slackcontends that he is entitled to an appeal of the dismissal ofhis petition, arguing that the District Court was wrong tohold that his 1995 petition was "second or successive." Weagree that Slack's 1995 petition was not second or successive,but first we must resolve two preliminary questions.IIBefore AEDPA, appellate review of the dismissal of a habeas petition was governed by a version of 28 U. S. C. $ 2253enacted in 1948. Act of June 25, 1948, 62 Stat. 967. Thestatute provided no appeal could be taken from the finalorder in a habeas corpus proceeding "unless the justice orjudge who rendered the order or a circuit justice or judgeissues a certificate of probable cause." Ibid. The statutedid not explain the standards for the issuance of a CPC, butthe Court established what a prisoner must show to obtaina CPC in Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880 (1983): "a substantial showing of the denial of a federal right." Id., at 893(citation and brackets omitted).Effective April 24, 1996, AEDPA amended $ 2253. As relevant here, AEDPA added subsection (c), which provides:529US2 Unit: $U50 [09-26-01 10:29:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN481Cite as: 529 U. S. 473 (2000)Opinion of the Court"(1) Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certifi-cate of appealability, an appeal may not be taken to thecourt of appeals from--"(A) the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding inwhich the detention complained of arises out of processissued by a State court; or"(B) the final order in a proceeding under section2255."(2) A certificate of appealability may issue underparagraph (1) only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right."(3) The certificate of appealability under paragraph(1) shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfythe showing required by paragraph (2)." 28 U. S. C.$ 2253(c) (1994 ed., Supp. III).The issue we consider at the outset is whether the pre- orpost-AEDPA version of $ 2253 controls Slack's right to appeal. In Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320 (1997), the Courtheld that AEDPA's amendments to 28 U. S. C. $ 2254, thestatute governing entitlement to habeas relief in the districtcourt, applied to cases filed after AEDPA's effective date.521 U. S., at 327. Slack contends that Lindh means $ 2253(c)does not apply to him because his case was commenced inthe District Court pre-AEDPA. That position is incorrect.For purposes of implementing the holding inLindh, it mustbe recognized that $ 2254 is directed to proceedings in thedistrict courts while $ 2253 is directed to proceedings inthe appellate courts. Just as $ 2254 applies to cases filedin the trial court post-AEDPA, $ 2253 applies to appellateproceedings initiated post-AEDPA. True, Lindh requires acourt of appeals to apply pre-AEDPA law in reviewing thetrial court's ruling, for cases commenced there pre-AEDPA;but post-AEDPA law governs the right to appeal in casessuch as the one now before us.While an appeal is a continuation of the litigation startedin the trial court, it is a distinct step.Hohn v. United529US2 Unit: $U50 [09-26-01 10:29:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN482 SLACK v. McDANIELOpinion of the CourtStates, 524 U. S. 236, 241 (1998); Mackenzie v. A. Engelhard & Sons Co., 266 U. S. 131 (1924). We have describedproceedings in the courts of appeals as "appellate cases."E. g., Order of Apr. 30, 1991, 500 U. S. 1009 (amendments toFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure "shall govern all proceedings in appellate cases thereafter commenced"). UnderAEDPA, an appellate case is commenced when the application for a COA is filed. Hohn, supra, at 241. When Congress instructs us (as Lindh says it has) that application ofa statute is triggered by the commencement of a case, therelevant case for a statute directed to appeals is the one initiated in the appellate court. Thus, $ 2253(c) governs appellate court proceedings filed after AEDPA's effective date.We see no indication that Congress intended to tie application of the provisions to the date a petition was filed inthe district court. The COA statute establishes proceduralrules and requires a threshold inquiry into whether the circuit court may entertain an appeal. Hohn, supra, at 248;cf. Lindh, supra, at 327. Because Slack sought appellatereview two years after AEDPA's effective date, $ 2253(c)governs his right to appeal.We further note that we applied $ 2253 in our post-Lindhdecision in Hohn, a case which arrived in the same postureas this case. Like Slack, Hohn argued $ 2253(c) did not applybecause his petition had been filed in the District Court before AEDPA's effective date. Brief for Petitioner in Hohnv. United States, O. T. 1997, No. 96-8986, pp. 40-44. Thoughour opinion did not discuss whether $ 2253(c) applied to Hohn,we would have had no reason to reach the issue we did resolve, that we had statutory certiorari jurisdiction to reviewthe denial of a COA, if AEDPA did not apply at all. Ourdisposition today is consistent with Hohn. AEDPA governsthe conditions of Slack's appeal, and so he was required toseek a COA to obtain appellate review of the dismissal of hishabeas petition.529US2 Unit: $U50 [09-26-01 10:29:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN483Cite as: 529 U. S. 473 (2000)Opinion of the CourtIIIAs AEDPA applied, the Court of Appeals should havetreated the notice of appeal as an application for a COA.Fed. Rule App. Proc. 22(b); Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(f ); seealsoHohn, supra, at 240. To evaluate whether the Court ofAppeals should have granted a COA, we must determinewhat the habeas applicant must show to satisfy the require-ments of $ 2253(c).Citing $ 2253(c)'s requirement that a COA may issue onlyupon the "substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right," the State contends that no appeal can be takenif the District Court relies on procedural grounds to dismissthe petition. According to the State, only constitutional rul-ings may be appealed. Under this view, a state prisonerwho can demonstrate he was convicted in violation of theConstitution and who can demonstrate that the district courtwas wrong to dismiss the petition on procedural groundswould be denied relief. We reject this interpretation. Thewrit of habeas corpus plays a vital role in protecting consti-tutional rights. In setting forth the preconditions for issuance of a COA under $ 2253(c), Congress expressed no inten-tion to allow trial court procedural error to bar vindicationof substantial constitutional rights on appeal.Our conclusion follows from AEDPA's present provisions,which incorporate earlier habeas corpus principles. UnderAEDPA, a COA may not issue unless "the applicant hasmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutionalright." 28 U. S. C. $ 2253(c) (1994 ed., Supp. III). Exceptfor substituting the word "constitutional" for the word "fed-eral," $ 2253 is a codification of the CPC standard announcedin Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S., at 894. Congress had beforeit the meaning Barefoot had given to the words it selected;and we give the language found in $ 2253(c) the meaningascribed it in Barefoot, with due note for the substitutionof the word "constitutional." See Williams v. Taylor, ante,at 434. To obtain a COA under $ 2253(c), a habeas prisoner529US2 Unit: $U50 [09-26-01 10:29:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN484 SLACK v. McDANIELOpinion of the Courtmust make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitu-tional right, a demonstration that, underBarefoot, includesshowing that reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, forthat matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presentedwere " `adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.' " Barefoot, supra, at 893, and n. 4 ("sum[ming] up"the " `substantial showing' " standard).Where a district court has rejected the constitutionalclaims on the merits, the showing required to satisfy $ 2253(c)is straightforward: The petitioner must demonstrate thatreasonable jurists would find the district court's assessmentof the constitutional claims debatable or wrong. The issuebecomes somewhat more complicated where, as here, thedistrict court dismisses the petition based on proceduralgrounds. We hold as follows: When the district court deniesa habeas petition on procedural grounds without reachingthe prisoner's underlying constitutional claim, a COA shouldissue when the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reasonwould find it debatable whether the petition states a validclaim of the denial of a constitutional right and that juristsof reason would find it debatable whether the district courtwas correct in its procedural ruling. This constructiongives meaning to Congress' requirement that a prisonerdemonstrate substantial underlying constitutional claims andis in conformity with the meaning of the "substantial showing" standard provided in Barefoot, supra, at 893, and n. 4,and adopted by Congress in AEDPA. Where a plain procedural bar is present and the district court is correct to invoke it to dispose of the case, a reasonable jurist could notconclude either that the district court erred in dismissingthe petition or that the petitioner should be allowed to proceed further. In such a circumstance, no appeal would bewarranted.Determining whether a COA should issue where the petition was dismissed on procedural grounds has two compo529US2 Unit: $U50 [09-26-01 10:29:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN485Cite as: 529 U. S. 473 (2000)Opinion of the Courtnents, one directed at the underlying constitutional claimsand one directed at the district court's procedural holding.Section 2253 mandates that both showings be made beforethe court of appeals may entertain the appeal. Each component of the $ 2253(c) showing is part of a threshold inquiry,and a court may find that it can dispose of the application ina fair and prompt manner if it proceeds first to resolve theissue whose answer is more apparent from the record andarguments. The recognition that the "Court will not passupon a constitutional question although properly presentedby the record, if there is also present some other groundupon which the case may be disposed of," Ashwander v. TVA,297 U. S. 288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring), allows andencourages the court to first resolve procedural issues. TheAshwander rule should inform the court's discretion in thisregard.In this case, Slack did not attempt to make a substantialshowing of the denial of a constitutional right, instead arguing only that the District Court's procedural rulings werewrong. We will not attempt to determine whether Slackcould make the required showing of constitutional error, forthe issue was neither briefed nor presented below becauseof the view that the CPC, rather than COA, standards applied. It will be necessary to consider the matter upon anyremand for further proceedings. We will, however, addressthe second component of the $ 2253(c) inquiry, whether jurists of reason could conclude that the District Court's dismissal on procedural grounds was debatable or incorrect.The issue has been discussed in the briefs presented to us; itis the question upon which we granted certiorari; and itsresolution would end the case, were we to decide the matterin the State's favor.The District Court dismissed claims Slack failed to raisein his 1991 petition based on its conclusion that Slack's 1995petition was a second or successive habeas petition. Thisconclusion was wrong. A habeas petition filed in the district529US2 Unit: $U50 [09-26-01 10:29:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN486 SLACK v. McDANIELOpinion of the Courtcourt after an initial habeas petition was unadjudicated onits merits and dismissed for failure to exhaust state remediesis not a second or successive petition.Slack commenced this habeas proceeding in the DistrictCourt in 1995, before AEDPA's effective date. Because thequestion whether Slack's petition was second or successiveimplicates his right to relief in the trial court, pre-AEDPAlaw governs, see Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320 (1997),though we do not suggest the definition of second or successive would be different under AEDPA. See Stewart v.Martinez-Villareal, 523 U. S. 637 (1998) (using pre-AEDPAlaw to interpret AEDPA's provision governing "second orsuccessive habeas applications"). The parties point us toRule 9(b) of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in theUnited States District Courts as controlling the issue. TheRule incorporates our prior decisions regarding successivepetitions and abuse of the writ, McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S.467, 487 (1991), and states: "A second or successive petition[alleging new and different grounds] may be dismissed if . . .the judge finds that the failure of the petitioner to assertthose grounds in a prior petition constituted an abuse of thewrit." As the text demonstrates, Rule 9(b) applies only to"a second or successive petition."The phrase "second or successive petition" is a term ofart given substance in our prior habeas corpus cases. TheCourt's decision in Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S., at 510, instructsus in reaching our understanding of the term. Rose v.Lundy held that a federal district court must dismiss habeascorpus petitions containing both exhausted and unexhaustedclaims. The opinion, however, contemplated that the prisoner could return to federal court after the requisite exhaustion. Id., at 520 ("Those prisoners who . . . submit mixedpetitions nevertheless are entitled to resubmit a petitionwith only exhausted claims or to exhaust the remainder oftheir claims"). It was only if a prisoner declined to returnto state court and decided to proceed with his exhausted529US2 Unit: $U50 [09-26-01 10:29:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN487Cite as: 529 U. S. 473 (2000)Opinion of the Courtclaims in federal court that the possibility arose that a subse-quent petition would be considered second or successive andsubject to dismissal as an abuse of the writ. Id., at 520-521(plurality opinion) ("[A] prisoner who decides to proceed onlywith his exhausted claims and deliberately sets aside hisunexhausted claims risks dismissal of subsequent federalpetitions").This understanding of the second or successive rule wasconfirmed two Terms ago when we wrote as follows: "[N]oneof our cases . . . have ever suggested that a prisoner whosehabeas petition was dismissed for failure to exhaust stateremedies, and who then did exhaust those remedies andreturned to federal court, was by such action filing a successive petition. A court where such a petition was filed couldadjudicate these claims under the same standard as wouldgovern those made in any other first petition." Stewart v.Martinez-Villareal, supra, at 644. We adhere to this analysis. A petition filed after a mixed petition has been dismissed under Rose v. Lundy before the district court adjudicated any claims is to be treated as "any other first petition"and is not a second or successive petition.The State contends that the prisoner, upon his returnto federal court, should be restricted to the claims made inhis initial petition. Neither Rose v. Lundy nor MartinezVillareal requires this result, which would limit a prisonerto claims made in a pleading that is often uncounseled, handwritten, and pending in federal court only until the Stateidentifies one unexhausted claim. The proposed rule wouldbar the prisoner from raising nonfrivolous claims developedin the subsequent state exhaustion proceedings contemplated by the Rose dismissal, even though a federal courthad yet to review a single constitutional claim. This resultwould be contrary to our admonition that the complete exhaustion rule is not to "trap the unwary pro se prisoner."Rose supra, at 520 (internal quotation marks omitted). Itis instead more appropriate to treat the initial mixed petition529US2 Unit: $U50 [09-26-01 10:29:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN488 SLACK v. McDANIELOpinion of the Courtas though it had not been filed, subject to whatever condi-tions the court attaches to the dismissal.Rose v. Lundydictated that, whatever particular claims the petition con-tained, none could be considered by the federal court.Slack's 1991 petition was dismissed under the procedureestablished inRose v. Lundy. No claim made in Slack's 1991petition was adjudicated during the three months it waspending in federal court. As such, the 1995 petition shouldnot have been dismissed on the grounds that it was secondor successive. Reasoning to the contrary found in the Courtof Appeals'Farmer decision, rendered before MartinezVillareal, is incorrect. See also In re Turner, 101 F. 3d 1323(CA9 1997) (refusing to apply rules governing second or successive petitions to a petitioner whose prior habeas petitionhad been dismissed for failure to exhaust). Our view thatestablished practice demonstrates that Slack's 1995 petitionis not second or successive is confirmed as well by opinionsof the Courts of Appeals which have addressed the pointunder similar circumstances. E. g., Carlson v. Pitcher, 137F. 3d 416, 420 (CA6 1998) ("We join with every other courtto consider the question, and hold that a habeas petition filedafter a previous petition has been dismissed on exhaustiongrounds is not a `second or successive' petition"); Turner,supra; Christy v. Horn, 115 F. 3d 201, 208 (CA3 1997); Dickinson v. Maine, 101 F. 3d 791 (CA1 1996); Camarano v. Irvin,98 F. 3d 44, 45-46 (CA2 1996).The State complains that this rule is unfair. The filing ofa mixed petition in federal court requires it to appear andto plead failure to exhaust. The petition is then dismissedwithout prejudice, allowing the prisoner to make a returntrip through the state courts to exhaust new claims. TheState expresses concern that, upon exhaustion, the prisonerwould return to federal court but again file a mixed petition,causing the process to repeat itself. In this manner, theState contends, a vexatious litigant could inject undue delayinto the collateral review process. To the extent the tactic529US2 Unit: $U50 [09-26-01 10:29:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN489Cite as: 529 U. S. 473 (2000)Opinion of the Courtwould become a problem, however, it can be countered with-out upsetting the established meaning of a second or successive petition.First, the State remains free to impose proper proceduralbars to restrict repeated returns to state court for postcon-viction proceedings. Second, provisions of AEDPA maybear upon the question in cases to which the Act applies.AEDPA itself demonstrates that Congress may address matters relating to exhaustion and mixed petitions throughmeans other than rules governing "second or successive" petitions. E. g., 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. III).Third, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, applicable as ageneral matter to habeas cases, vest the federal courts withdue flexibility to prevent vexatious litigation. As Slack concedes, in the habeas corpus context it would be appropriatefor an order dismissing a mixed petition to instruct an applicant that upon his return to federal court he is to bring onlyexhausted claims. See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 41(a) and (b).Once the petitioner is made aware of the exhaustion require-ment, no reason exists for him not to exhaust all potentialclaims before returning to federal court. The failure to com-ply with an order of the court is grounds for dismissal withprejudice. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 41(b). In this case, how-ever, the initial petition was dismissed without condition andwithout prejudice. We reject the State's argument that re-fusing to give a new meaning to the established term "secondor successive" opens the door to the abuses described.IVSlack has demonstrated that reasonable jurists could con-clude that the District Court's abuse of the writ holding waswrong, for we have determined that a habeas petition filedafter an initial petition was dismissed underRose v. Lundywithout an adjudication on the merits is not a "second orsuccessive" petition. Whether Slack is otherwise entitled tothe issuance of a COA is a question to be resolved first upon529US2 Unit: $U50 [09-26-01 10:29:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN490 SLACK v.
